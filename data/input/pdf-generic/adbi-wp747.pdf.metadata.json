INTRODUCTION \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nAs  part  of  their  continuous  efforts  to  harness  international  trade  for  sustainable \ndevelopment,  Asia  and  the  Pacific  economies  have  long  strived  to  make  trade \nprocedures as efficient as possible, in particular through implementation of automated \ncustoms  systems,  electronic  single  windows  and  other  digital  customs  and  trade \nfacilitation  initiatives. These  paperless trade  measures are  rapidly  becoming  essential \nnot  only  to  maintain  trade  competitiveness,  but  also  to  address  the  trade  control  and \nlogistics  challenges  associated  with  an  increase  in  small  shipments  and  cross-border  \ne-commerce.1 \n\nPaperless trade generally refers to the conduct of international trade transactions using \nelectronic rather than paper-based data and documents.2 It is more formally defined as \ntrade  \u201ctaking  place  on  the  basis  of  electronic  communications,  including  exchange  of \ntrade-related data and documents in electronic form\u201d in the Framework Agreement on \nFacilitation  of  Cross-border  Paperless  Trade  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (FA-PT)  adopted \nby Member States of United Nations ESCAP in May 2016.3 While the ultimate goal of \npaperless  trade  is  to  dematerialize  all  information  flows  associated  with  a  given \ntransaction for all stakeholders, paperless trade initiatives generally focus on facilitating \ndata  and  documents  flows  between  businesses  and  government  (BtoG)  and/or \nbetween governments (GtoG).4 \n\nPaperless  trade  generates  significant  economy-wide  savings,  including  direct  savings \nto traders in the form of lower compliance costs, as well as indirect savings from faster \nmovement  of  goods  and  lower  inventory  costs. 5 It  also  enhances  opportunities  for \nSMEs  to  participate  in  cross-border  trade,  affords  timely  availability  of  shipping \ndocuments and reduces errors associated with re-keying of data.6 In addition, through \nreduction in clearance times, it can increase port efficiency and reduce port congestion \nand  related  problems. 7 Potential  annual  export  gains  associated  with  moving  from \nmanual  paper-based  trade  to  paperless  trade  have  been  estimated  at  between  USD \n36 billion and 257 billion in Asia and the Pacific, depending on the extent of automation \nand dematerialization of procedures and documents.8  \n\n                                                \n1   UNCTAD (2015), among others, indicate that cross-border e-commerce has led to a 48% growth in the \nvolume  of  international  deliveries  of  small  packets  between  2011  and  2014.  The  etradeforall.org \ninitiative identifies trade logistics and facilitation as one of seven key areas for e-trade development. \n\n2   Sung Heun Ha and Sang Won Lim (2014). \n3   This  new  United  Nations  treaty,  dedicated  to  enabling  paperless  trade  among  Asia  and  the  Pacific \nmember States opened for signature and ratification or accession in New York on 1 October 2016. See: \nhttp://www.unescap.org/resources/framework-agreement-facilitation-cross-border-paperless-trade-asia-\nand-pacific \n\n4   This is in contrast to e-commerce, where the focus is generally on facilitating exchange of information \nbetween business and consumers (BtoC) and/or between businesses (BtoB). In the international trade \ncontext, paperless trade is seen as an enabler of cross-border e-commerce, with general provisions on \n\u201cpaperless trade\u201d or \u201cpaperless trading\u201d increasingly included in e-commerce chapters of regional trade \nor economic partnership agreements (e.g., in the TPP). \n\n5   See  for  example,  UNNExT  Briefs  on  single  window  implementation  in  Republic  of  Korea,  as  well  as \n\nSenegal, Singapore and Thailand. http://unnext.unescap.org \n\n6   See for example, Laryea (2005). \n7   See Laryea (2002). \n8   Shepherd  and  Duval  (2015).  This  is  made  possible  by  the  very  significant  time  and  cost  savings \nassociated with the digitalization of the entire trade process, with direct cost savings alone estimated at \nUSD 7 billion annually in Asia and the Pacific - and time savings in the export process of at least 24%. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nImportantly, the use of electronic rather than paper documents can also help enhance \nregulatory control and compliance by governments, especially when relevant data and \ndocuments  can  be  exchanged  among  agencies  and  across  borders.  In  particular,  the \navailability or more accurate and timely data in electronic form can enable trade control \nagencies  to  more  efficiently  evaluate  the  compliance  risks  associated  with  individual \nshipments,  enabling  them  to  identify  high-risk  transactions,  ultimately  boosting \nCustoms revenue while also speeding up the trade of compliant traders.9  \n\nOverall,  the  significant  benefits  for  both  Governments  and  traders  have  led  an \nincreasing  number  of  countries  to  promote  paperless  trade,  including  as  part  of \nmultilateral  and  preferential  trade  agreements.  Accordingly,  this  paper  analyzes  the \nextent  to  which  recent  preferential  trade agreements  have  included  provisions  related \nto paperless trade globally, also using the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) as \na reference. Results provide insights and models for future negotiations in this area, as \nwell as for implementation of the FA-PT. \n\nOur analysis reveals that more than half of the trade agreements which have entered \ninto  force  since  2005  globally  (90  of  138)  include  paperless  trade  measures  or \nprovisions.  Thirty  (30)  of  these  RTAs  reviewed  in  this  study  contain  a  dedicated \nprovision titled \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d or \u201cPaperless Trade Administration\u201d, typically found \neither in the Chapter on e-commerce, or the one dealing with Customs procedures and \ntrade facilitation (See Annex 1 for the list of RTAs examined). As shown in Figure 1, the \ndetailed  analysis  presented  in  this  paper  reveals  that  the  number  of  paperless  trade \nmeasures included in RTAs almost doubled between 2005\u20132008 and 2013\u201316. While \nthe impact of including such measures and provisions in trade agreements is difficult to \nmeasure, the willingness of Governments to systematically include commitments in this \narea is a welcome development. \n\nFigure 1: Number of Paperless Trade Measures in RTAs (2005\u20132016) \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n                                                \n9   For  example,  Ghana  Customs  reports  that  its  electronic  Single  Window  launched  in  2015  helped  \nboost  revenue  collection  by  almost  15%  in  one  year,  while  cutting  down  waiting  time  and  approval  \nfor  classification  of  goods  from  2  weeks  to  2  days  \u2013  See  more  at:  http://thebftonline.com/business/ \neconomy/21250/single-window-boosts-revenue-collection-148-in-one-year.html#sthash.bASAWHGE \n.dpuf  \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  the  next  section  presents  a  typology  of  paperless \ntrade  measures  and  provisions  in  RTAs,  providing  a  basis  for  the  evaluation  of  the \npaperless  trade  coverage  of  such  agreements.  The  results  of  the  evaluation  are  then \npresented,  highlighting  differences  in  coverage  by  geographic  regions  and  identifying \nthe  least  and  most  common  measures  included  in  RTAs.  This  is  followed  by  a  more \ndetailed  analysis  of  selected  RTAs  in  the  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region,  including  a \ncomparative  analysis  of \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d/\u201dPaperless Trade  Administration\u201d  Articles \nand  an  assessment  of  relevant  paperless  trade  measures  in  terms  of  substance  and \nnature (binding vs. best endeavour). Linkages to provisions featured in the new FA-PT \nare then discussed, followed by conclusions. \n\n2.  TYPOLOGY OF PAPERLESS TRADE  \n\nRELATED PROVISIONS  \n\nAn  initial  starting  point for  the  development  of  a  list  of  paperless  trade measures  and \nprovisions  is  the  United  Nations  Regional  Commissions  (UNRCs)  Global  Survey  on \nTrade  Facilitation  and  Paperless  Trade  Implementation  (TFPI).10 The  paperless  trade \nand cross-border paperless trade measures included in the 2015 UNRCs TFPI Survey \nare shown in Table 1. \n\nPaperless  trade  measures  featured  in  the  TFPI  Survey  include  the  establishment  \nof  electronic  automated  customs  system  and  electronic  single  window  system, \nelectronic  submission  of  trade-related  documents  including  trade  licenses,  sea/air \ncargo manifests and customs declarations, and electronic application and issuance of \ntrade licenses and preferential certificate of origin. Furthermore, there are six measures \nrelated to cross-border paperless trade in the survey. Apart from the general measure \n\u201cEngagement  of  the  country  in  trade-related  cross-border  electronic  data  exchange \nwith  other  countries\u201d,  the  measures  aiming  at  exchanging  specific  documents  such  \nas  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  (SPS)  Certificates  and  Certificates  of  Origin  (COO) \nelectronically are included. In addition, two of the measures, Laws and regulations for \nelectronic transactions and Recognized certification authority issuing digital certificates \nto traders to conduct electronic transactions, are basic building blocks towards enabling \nthe  exchange  and  mutual  recognition  of  trade-related  data  and  documents  among \nstakeholders within a country and also along the entire international supply chain.11  \n\nFollowing  an  initial  review  of  preferential  trade  agreements,  however,  most  of  the \nmeasures  listed  in  the  TFPI  Survey  were  not  frequently  found  in  RTA  provisions, \nprobably  because  such  measures  were  too  \u201capplied\u201d  and  specific  to  be  included  in \nsuch \u2013generally quite broad - legal instruments. We therefore further developed the list \nof paperless trade measures and provisions based on an iterative review of the text of \nagreements  included  in  the  WTO  Regional  Trade  Agreements  Information  System \n(RTA-IS). \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n10  Available  at:  https://unnext.unescap.org/content/global-survey-trade-facilitation-and-paperless-trade-\n\nimplementation-2015  \n\n11  Id \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nTable 1: Paperless Trade Measures included in the UNRC Global Survey  \non Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation 2015 \n\nPaperless trade  \n\n15.

The  WTO  Trade  Facilitation \nAgreement (TFA) is also used as a benchmark in the analysis. The complete list of the \nRTAs reviewed is available in Annex 1. \n\nIn  line  with  the  TFPI  Survey,  we  adopted  a  broad  definition  of  paperless  trade  in \nidentifying relevant measures and provisions, looking for mentions of related keywords, \nin  particular  \u201cinformation  and  communication  technologies\u201d,  \u201cinternet\u201d  \u201celectronic\u201d, \n\u201cautomation\u201d,  and  \u201cpaperless\u201d,  in  chapters  of  the  agreement  covering  not  only  trade \nfacilitation  and  customs  procedures  but  also  those  covering  rules  of  origin,  technical \nbarriers  to  trade,  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures,  financial  services,  as  well  as \nelectronic  commerce.  However,  the  scope  of  paperless  trade  was  not  extended  to \nchapters or sections related to transport and logistics services liberalization, mobility of \nbusiness people, government procurement and intellectual property. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n12  The WTO RTA-IS included 156 RTAs which had entered into force on or after 2005, but RTAs whose \n\ntexts are only available in Spanish and Russian were not reviewed. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nA  typology  of  27  paperless  trade  measures  and  provisions  was  ultimately  developed, \nas  shown  in  Table  2.  While  some  of  the  measures  and  provisions  included  are \nrelatively general (e.g. \u201cE-submission/processing of trade-related data/documents\u201d), we \nalso included much more specific and sometimes overlapping measures and provisions  \nin  order  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  content  and  depth  of  the  various \nAgreements.  Specific  measures  and  provisions  related  to  a  more  general  measure \nincluded in table 2 are specified in italic immediately under such measure. We also try \nto distinguish between paperless trade measures and provisions focusing on exchange \nof  information  in  electronic  form  between  stakeholders  domestically  (measures  and \nprovisions  No.  1\u201314)  from  those  more  directly  related  to  cross-border  electronic  data \nand  document  exchanges  (measures  No.  15\u201327).  Finally,  in  line  with  the  content  of \nsome  of  the  most  recent  agreements  and  their  e-commerce  chapters,  the  typology \nemphasizes  provisions  related  to  e-certificates  and  e-signatures  (16\u201321),  focusing  on \ntheir mutual recognition and interoperability in particular.13 \n\nTable 2: Typology of Paperless Trade Measures and Provisions in PTAs \n\nE-submission of Air Cargo \nManifests \n\nRefers to the submission of a manifest covering all goods contained in an express \nshipment through electronic means.

In addition, making a claim for preferential tariff treatment by \nelectronic means. (e.g., Australia-The PRC FTA Art.3.16) and the issuance of CO in \nelectronic format also implies the need for e-system of COO (e.g., India-Malaysia \nECA Annex 3-3 7(a)). E-Systems for verification of COOs (e.g., The PRC-Chile FTA \nAnnex 6) come under e-exchange of COOs.  \n\nThe documents to be maintained are related to exportation, importation, and  \nmay include copies of COO and other documentary evidence of origin.  \n(e.g., The PRC-Singapore FTA Art.31). \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\nE-payment system \n\nSee, e.g., TPP Chapter 11 Section D. \n\nE-application for customs \nrefunds \n\nMeasure included in the TFPI Survey \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n \n\nTable 2 continued \n\n                                                \n13  To  make  the  list  of  paperless  trade  measures  as  comprehensive  as  possible,  two  specific  measures \nincluded  in  the  UNRCs  Survey,  namely  E-submission of  sea  cargo manifest  (no.  4) and E-application  \nof  customs  refund  (no.10),  are  kept  in  the  list  although  none  of  the  trade  agreements  reviewed  \nincluded them. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\n \n11 \n\nMeasure/Provision \n\nE-Customs System/ \nCustoms Automation \n\n12 \n\nAutomated System for Risk \nManagement and targeting  \n\n13 \n14 \n\nSingle Window System \nE-system for  \ninter-organization \ncommunication \n\n15 \n\nLaws for electronic \ntransactions \n\n16  Use of electronic \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\ncertificates and electronic \nsignatures \n(Mutual) determination of \nauthentication technologies \nProving in court legal \ncompliance of  \nE-authentication \n19  Meeting standards for \n E-signature and  \nE-authentication \n\n21 \n\n20  Mutual recognition of digital \ncertificates and E-signature \nInteroperability of digital \ncertificates used by \nbusiness \nTrade-related electronic \ndata exchange \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\nE-exchange of COO \nrelated information \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n26 \n\nE-exchange of SPS related \ninformation \n\nE-exchange of TBT related \ninformation \nE-transmission of financial \ninformation \n\n27  Use of international \n\nstandards for paperless \ntrade \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nNote \nThis measure includes electronic focal point, provided by customs administration, \nthrough which its traders may submit all required regulatory information in order to \nobtain clearance of goods (e.g., The PRC-Peru FTA Art.54.4).

PAPERLESS TRADE COVERAGE OF REGIONAL \n\nTRADE AGREEMENTS  \n\nIn order to provide an overall picture of the paperless trade coverage in recent RTAs, \nwe review how many of the 27 measures identified above are included in each of the \nRTAs included in the study.14 For each measure in table 2, an agreement gets a \u201c1\u201d if \nthe  measure  is  mentioned  in  any  form  or  language,  i.e.,  regardless  of  whether  it  is \nsimply authorized or encouraged, or whether it is formulated as a binding or exclusive \ncommitment  \u2013  and  a  \u201c0\u201d  otherwise.  Ninety  RTAs  (66%)  are  found  to  contain  at  least \none paperless trade measure.15  \n\nFigure  2  shows  how  many  paperless  trade  measures  are  mentioned  in  each  of  the \nRTAs  which  are  signed  by  East  Asian  economies  \u2013  Similar  figures  for  other  Asian \nsubregions and other world regions are available in Annex 2.  \n\nAs  illustrated  in  figure  2,  among  all  agreements  considered,  the  Trans-Pacific \nPartnership  (TPP)  Agreement  has  the  highest  number  of  paperless  trade  measures;  \nIts text refers to 21 of the 27 measures and provisions considered in our analysis. This \nagreement  is  not  only  the  largest  but  also  the  newest  of  the  regional  agreements \nconsidered  in  this  study  \u2013  and  the  only  one  that  has  not  yet  entered  into  force  \n\u2013,  providing  further  evidence  of  the  growing  interest  in  cross-border  paperless  trade. \nThe  second  most  comprehensive  agreement  on  paperless  trade  is  the  United  States \n(US)-Republic  of  Korea  (RoK)  agreement  (\u201cKOR-US\u201d),  with  15  measures  included, \nfollowed  by  the  bilateral  agreements  between  Republic  of  Korea  and  Viet  Nam  \n(\u201cKOR-VN\u201d)  featuring  14). 16 As  a  reference,  the  WTO  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement \n(TFA) only features 5 measures and provisions on paperless trade. \n\nFigure  3  shows  the  average  number  of  paperless  trade  measures  in  RTAs  signed  by \ncountries from different world regions. Within Asia and the Pacific, Australia and New-\nZealand  seem  to  have  the  RTAs  featuring  the  largest  number  of  paperless  trade \nmeasures (9.2), followed by East Asian economies (7.1), led by Republic of Korea. \n\nThe  average  number  of  paperless  trade  shown  in  the  agreements  signed  by  South-\nEast Asian economies is 6.8. Singapore, as the economy which has signed the highest \nnumber  of  RTAs  containing  paperless  trade  measures,  leads  South-East  Asia  in  this \narea (see Figure A2.1 in Annex 2). In general, ASEAN plays an active role in including \npaperless trade measures in RTA rule-making. For instance, Intra-ASEAN agreements \ncontain 10 paperless trade measures. But the content of its ASEAN+ agreements vary \nwidely, from 12 measures featured in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA to only 1 \nin the case, for example, of the ASEAN-India FTA. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n14  More information on the RTAs included is available in Annex 1. \n15  The same weight is given to all 27 measures, although arguments could be made that some measures \nare more important or far reaching than others. It is worth noting, however, that the same RTAs emerge \nas  paperless  trade  \u201cleaders\u201d  when  only  general  measures  are  counted  (i.e.,  the  12  sub  measures \nshown in italic in table 2 are excluded from the analysis). \n\n16  Many of the most comprehensive RTAs in terms of paperless trade are between Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) member economies. APEC, through its Electronic Commerce Steering Group and \nPaperless  Trade  Subgroup  (ECSG),  has  actively  promoted  paperless  trading  among  its  members,  in \nparticular between 2002 and 2012. See, e.g., ECSG (2004).  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nFigure 2: Paperless Trade Coverage in RTAs of East Asian  \nEconomies since 2005 \n\nNote: the figure shows the number of paperless trade measures mentioned in each agreement (out of 27). \n\n \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nFigure 3: Paperless Trade Coverage of RTAs in Different World Regions  \nsince 2005 \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\nThe  average  number  of  paperless  trade  measures  mentioned  in  RTAs  signed  \nby  Central  and  South  Asian  as  well  as  Middle-East  economies  is  merely  4  (see \nFigure A2.2).  India  leads  that  region  with  the  highest  number  of  RTAs  involving \npaperless  trade  measures  (5),  three  of  which  have  the  same  or  higher  number  of \npaperless trade measures than that in the WTO TFA. \n\nInterestingly,  while  the  European  Union  (EU)  has  strived  to  develop  paperless  trade \nsystems among its members,17 our analysis suggests that it has put limited emphasis \non paperless trade in its RTAs, with an average number of paperless trade measures \n(4)  barely  on  par  with  that  of  the  WTO  TFA  (Figure  A2.3).  In  contrast,  many  \nRTAs  signed  by  North  American  economies,  in  particular  United  States  and  Canada, \nfeature 8 or more paperless trade measures (Figure A2.4). RTAs signed by Caribbean, \nCentral American and South American Economies also feature a significant number of \npaperless  trade  measures,  in  part  because  many  of  these  agreements  involve  the \nUnited  States  or  other  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  member  countries \n(Figure  A2.5).  Peru  leads  other  developing  American  economies  in  this  area,  being \nboth the country with the highest number of RTAs containing paperless trade measures \nand member of one of the most comprehensive RTA in this area (US-Peru FTA). \n\n3.1  Frequency of Paperless Trade Measures in RTAs \n\nThe  paperless  trade  content  of  RTAs  appear  to  be  relatively  diverse,  with  no  single \nmeasure included in our typology mentioned in more than half of the 90 RTAs featuring \nat  least  one  paperless  trade  related  measure  or  provision.  As  shown  in  Figure  4,  the \nuse of International standards for electronic exchange of data and documents is most \nfrequently mentioned in RTAs (47%), along with provisions on Promoting e-certification \nand e-signatures (47%) and the need for laws to enable electronic transactions (44%). \nOther  more  frequently  mentioned  general  measures  in  the  RTAs  include  general \n\n                                                \n17 See,  e.g.,  Decision  on  a  Paperless  Environment  for  Customs  and  Trade  by  the  European  Parliament \n\nand the Council of the Council of the European Union (2008).  \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nprovisions  encouraging  Electronic  submission  of  trade-related  data  and  documents, \nElectronic record keeping, and Acceptance of electronic copies. \n\nInterestingly,  several  specific  measures  are  also  frequently  mentioned.  Measures \nrelated  to  Electronic  exchange  of  information  on  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  (TBT) \nacross  borders  are  mentioned  in  more  than  44%  of  the  RTAs  with  at  least  one \npaperless trade measures,18 while 38% of these RTAs mention electronic or automated \ncustoms  systems  (37%).  Measures  related  to  the  Electronic  transmission  of  financial \ninformation across border between banks or private parties are also found in more than \n27% of the RTAs. \n\nFigure 4: Frequency of Paperless Trade Measures and Provision in Regional \nTrade Agreements since 2005 \n\n \nNote: the figure shows the percentage of RTAs (among the 90 containing at least one paperless trade measures) which \nfeature provisions related to each of the paperless trade measures considered. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n                                                \n18  As  mentioned  in  table  2,  e-exchange  of  TBT  related  information  includes  such  methods  as  electronic \n\nmail, teleconferencing, videoconferencing (e.g., Australia-Rep. of Korea FTA Art. 5.10). \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nThe  notion  of  electronic  systems  to  facilitate  inter-agency  communications  and \ncollaboration  is  featured  in  some  form  in  nearly  25%  of  the  RTAs  with  at  least  one \npaperless trade measure. However, \u201cSingle Window\u201d facilities, which are the subject of \na  dedicated  provision  in  the  WTO  TFA,  are  specifically  mentioned  in  only  5%  of  the \nRTAs. Various other specific measures which can, in principle, be integrated to either \nthe national single window or the e-customs systems are mentioned in less than 5% of \nthe RTAs, including e-payment systems or electronic systems for SPS certification or to \nobtain relevant import/export permit or licenses. Aside from electronic exchange of TBT \nand  financial  information,  our  analysis  shows  that  indeed  \u201ccross-border\u201d  paperless \ntrade measures and provisions tend to be less readily featured in RTAs than \u201cdomestic\u201d \npaperless  trade  measures.  Provisions  calling  for  Mutual  recognition  of  digital \ncertificates  and  electronic  signature,  as  well  as  Promoting  the  cross-border  electronic \nexchange  of  trade-related  data  and  documents  are  featured  in  roughly  20%  of  the \nRTAs  with  at  least  one  paperless  trade  measure.  Specific  provisions  related  to \nelectronic exchange of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) information and to certificates \nof origins (COOs) are featured in 16% and 12% of these RTAs, respectively. \n\n4.  A CLOSER LOOK: PAPERLESS TRADE  \n\nIN SELECTED RTAS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC  \n\nThe  analysis  presented  above  provided  an  overview  of  the  type  of  paperless  trade \nmeasures  that  are  covered  in  RTAs  and  the  extent  to  which  RTAs  signed  by  various \ncountries  emphasize  paperless  trade.  In  an  effort  to  get  deeper  insights,  we  take  a \ncloser  look  at  a  small  sample  of  recent  bilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements, \nselected  for  their  particular  emphasis  of  paperless  trade  issues  and  involving  leading \neconomies in South, South-East and East Asia and the Pacific (see Table 3). The WTO \nTFA and the TPP are also included in the comparative analysis for reference. \n\nTable 3: Status and Membership of Selected RTAs in Asia and the Pacific \n\nYear of Entry \ninto Force \n\n2010 (ASW since \n2005; ATIGA \nsince 2010) \n\nAgreement Name/Abbreviation \n\nSingapore-India Comprehensive Economic \nCooperation Agreement/SING-IND \nAustralia-Chile Free Trade Agreement/AUS-CHI \nJapan-Switzerland Economic Partnership \nAgreement/JAP-SWI \nIntra-ASEAN Agreements (including The ASEAN \nTrade in Goods Agreement, The ASEAN \nAgreement on Customs, Single Window \nAgreement)/ASEAN (ATIGA, AAC and SWA)  \nASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade \nAgreement/AANZFTA \nThe United States- Rep. of Korea Free Trade \nAgreement/US-KOR \nRep. of Korea-Viet Nam Free Trade \nAgreement/KOR-VN \nTrans-pacific Partnership/TPP \n\n2005 \n\n2009 \n2009 \n\n2010  \n\n2012 \n\n2015 \n\nMembership \n\nSingapore, India \n\nAustralia, Chile \nJapan, Switzerland \n\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, Philippines, \nThailand, Viet Nam, Singapore \nASEAN members, Australia, \nNew Zealand \nThe United States,  \nRep. of Korea \nRep. of Korea, Viet Nam \n\nNot yet in force \n(signed by all TPP \nmembers in 2015) \n\nThe United States, Australia, \nBrunei Darussalam, Chile, \nMalaysia, New Zealand, Peru, \nSingapore, and Viet Nam \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\n4.1  \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Articles \n\nAs noted earlier, paperless trade measures are found in different chapters of an RTA, \noften  as  part  of  other  substantive  Articles  or  provisions.  However,  most  recent  \nRTAs  also  include  one  specific  Article  titled  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  or  \u201cPaperless  Trade \nAdministration\u201d.  Before  looking  in  more  detail  at  the  paperless  trade  coverage  of  our \nselected  sample  of  RTAs  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  it  is  useful  to  review  such  Articles. \nTable 4 shows the actual text of these Articles in the RTAs under review. All RTAs in \nour  sample,  with  the  exception  of  the  intra-ASEAN  agreements,  include  at  least  one \narticle  titled  as  such.  These  articles  are  generally  found  in  e-commerce  chapters,  but \nnot  always.  For  example,  the  SING-IND  places  its  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  Article  in  the \nCustoms Administration chapter, while the AUS-CHI Agreement features such Article in \nboth  the  chapters  of  Customs  Administration  and  Electronic  Commerce.  Regardless  \nof  the  RTA  considered,  these  Articles  consistently  promote  the  development  and \nimplementation of paperless trade systems among member states. However, details of \ncommitments differ somewhat in substance and level of binding. \n\nTable 4: List of Paperless Trading Provisions Containing a Binding Framework \n\nCommitment \nLevel \n\nNon-binding \n \nBinding \n \nBinding \n \nNon-binding \n\nNon-binding \n \nNon-binding \n \n \nBinding \n\nNon-Binding \n\nRTAs \nAANZ \n\nJAP-\nSWI \n\nAUS-\nCHI \n\nText of Provisions Entitled \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d  \nor \u201cPaperless Trade Administration\u201d \nArt. 8 (1) \u201cEach Party shall, where possible, work towards the implementation \nof initiatives which provide for the use of paperless trading. \nArt. 8(2) \u201cThe Parties shall co-operate in international fora to enhance \nacceptance of electronic versions of trade administration documents.\u201d \nArt. 8(3) \u201cThe Parties shall exchange views and information on realizing, \npromoting and developments in paperless trading.\u201d \nArt. 8(4) \u201cEach Party shall endeavour to make electronic versions of its trade \nadministration documents publicly available.\u201d \nArt. 79 \u201c1.

The  two  most  commonly  found  provisions  in  the  Articles  are  that  parties  will \nendeavor  to  (1)  make  electronic  versions  of  their  trade  administration  documents \navailable publicly, and (2) accept trade documents submitted electronically as the legal \nequivalent  of  their  paper  version.  Another  provision  often  found  is  that  they  will  (3) \nexchange views and/or cooperate with each other as well as internationally to enhance \nthe acceptance of electronic documents. Interestingly, such cooperation provisions are \noften formulated as binding commitments. KOR-VN and AANZ also specifically commit \n\u201cto  work  towards  the  implementation  of  initiatives  which  provide  for  the  use  of \npaperless  trading\u201d,  which  may  be  interpreted  as  commitment  to  implement  joint  pilot \nprojects in paperless trade. \n\nAUS-CHI  is  the  only  agreement  where  the  development  of  a  single  window  for  trade \ndocuments is specifically included under a \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Article. One of the two \nsuch  Articles  featured  in  AUS-CHI  also  specifically  refer  to  engaging  in  paperless \ntrading  taking  into  account  the  \u201cmethods  agreed  by  the  World  Customs  Organization, \nincluding adoption of the World Customs Organization data model for the simplification \nand harmonisation of data\u201d. \n\n4.2  Paperless Trade Measures and Commitments \n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  typology  of  paperless  trade  measures  developed  earlier,  Table  5 \nprovides an overview of the paperless trade coverage of each of the 8 selected RTAs, \nincluding  in  terms  of  the  level  of  commitment  and  details  attached  to  each  of  the \npaperless  trade  measures  featured.  The  table  shows  that  paperless  trade  measures \nvary  significantly  across  RTAs,  both  in  substance  and  nature.  However,  with  the \nexception  of  the  India-Singapore  agreement,  which  entered  into  force  over  a  decade \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nago  (2005),  all  other  RTAs  included  in  the  table  have  deeper  coverage  of  paperless \ntrade than the WTO TFA. The Australia-Chile (2009) agreement appears to have been \nparticularly  pioneering  for  its  time  and  still  features  some  of  the  most  binding  and \ndetailed paperless trade measures found in any RTAs, including the TPP. \n\nTable 5: Paperless Trade Coverage in Selected Agreements in Asia and the \nPacific \n\nSING- \nIND \n2005 \n* \n \n\nAUS- \nCHI \n2009 \n** \n \n\nJAP-\nSWI \n2009 \n** \n \n\nIntra \nASEAN \n2010 \n** \n \n\nAANZ \nFTA \n2010 \n*** \n \n\nKOR- \nUS \n2012 \n** \n* \n\nKOR- \nVN \n2015 \n** \n* \n\nTPP \n\u2013 \n** \n* \n\nWTO \nTFA \n\u2013 \n* \n* \n\nAgreement: \nPaperless Trade Measures \nYear of Entry into Force: \nAcceptance of electronic copies \nE-submission of trade-related \ndocuments \nE-Submission of Air Cargo \nManifests \nE-system of Export or Import \nPermits \nE-system for SPS certification \nE-system of COO \nElectronic record-keeping \nE-payment system \nElectronic/Automated Customs \nSystem/Customs Automation \nAutomated System for Risk \nManagement and targeting \nElectronic Single Window System \nE-system for inter-organization \ncommunication \nLaws for electronic transactions \nPromoting e-certification and  \ne-signatures \nMutual determination of \nauthentication technologies \nProving in court legal compliance of \nE-authentication \nMeeting standards for E-signature \nand E-authentication \nMutual recognition of digital \ncertificates and E-signature \nInteroperability of digital certificates \nused by business \nTrade-related electronic data \nexchange \nE-exchange of COO related \ninformation \nE-exchange of SPS related \ninformation \nE-exchange of TBT related \ninformation \nE-transmission of financial \ninformation \nInternational standards for \npaperless trade \nTotal number of paperless trade \nmeasures: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n* \n \n \n\n \n\n \n* \n\n* \n \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n*** \n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n* \n\n \n\n \n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n*i \n\n*i \n\n*i \n\n \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n* \n \n** \n\n** \n\n** \n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n** \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n* \n* \n \n*** \n\n*** \n\n \n \n\n \n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n** \n\n** \n\n* \n\n*** \n\n*** \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n** \n\n \n \n\n** \n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n** \n\n* \n\n** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n* \n* \n* \n*** \n*** \n\n** \n \n\n*** \n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n\n* \n\n** \n\n* \n\n* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n* \n \n\n \n\n* \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* \n\n5 \n\n***i \n\n** \n\n*** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n*** \n \n* \n\n*** \n \n\n*** \n* \n\n*** \n\n* \n\n \n\n* \n\n*** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n** \n\n* \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n** \n* \n\n \n\n* \n\n** \n\n** \n\n* \n\n* \n\n8 \n\n14 \n \n\n10 \n\n12 \n\n15 \n\n14 \n\n21 \n\nNotes:  1  star  (*)  indicates the measure  is  only mentioned,  generally  as  an  option,  without  further clarification;  2 stars  \n(**) indicate the measure is encouraged (e.g., Shall endeavour to; or Shall, to the extent possible, to) with clarification on \nhow  it  is  to  be  provided/implemented  (e.g.  complying  with  relevant  international  standards);  3  stars  (***)  indicate  that \nimplementation  of the measures  is  required  and  binding  (e.g.,  shall)  with  details included  on  how  to do  so.  i  indicates \nthat commitment to these measures is implied by the existence of the regional ASEAN Single Window Agreement itself. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\na.  Measures Related to Acceptance of Electronic Copies \n\nAs  noted  earlier,  this  type  of  measure  is  commonly  found  in  RTA  articles  titled \n\u201cPaperless Trading\u201d (see table 4). Referring to table 5, all eight RTAs examined have \none  or  more  dedicated  provisions  encouraging  development  and  acceptance  of \nelectronic  versions  of  trade  administration  documents.  In  contrast,  the  WTO  TFA \nincludes  a  specific  provision  on  Acceptance  of  Copies  (Art.  10.2),  with  all  parties \nexpected  to  \u201c,  where  appropriate,  endeavor  to  accept  paper  or  electronic  copies  of \nsupporting documents required for import, export or transit formalities.\u201d  \n\nGoing beyond simple encouragements, the ASEAN Single Window Agreement and its \nProtocol on the Legal Framework to Implement the ASEAN Single Window do provide \nfor  a  framework  for  acceptance  and  legal  recognition  of  electronic  documents  among \nMember  States.  Such  framework  is  indeed  more  elaborate  and  binding  than  those \nfound in provisions of the other RTAs. In particular, Article 15 (Legal Effect of Electronic \nDocuments,  Data,  and  Information)  of  the  Protocol  indicate  that  \u201cEach  Member  State \nshall  adopt  procedures  for  authentication  of  NSW  electronic  documents,  data,  and \ninformation  that  shall  be  used  or  processed  within  the  NSW  and  transmitted  in  an \nelectronic form in the ASW environment.\u201d and that \u201cSubject to national laws, rules and \nregulations  of  each  Member  State,  authenticated  electronic  documents  produced  in \nconnection with transactions under this Protocol may be admissible as evidence of any \nfact stated therein.\u201d \n\nb.  Measures Related to E-submission of Trade-related Documents \n\nSuch measures are typically found in the articles on \u201cRelease of Goods\u201d and \u201cExpress \nShipment\u201d  under  chapters  titled  \u201cCustoms  Administration  and  Trade  Facilitation\u201d  or \n\u201cCustoms  Procedures\u201d.  Two  of  the  eight  RTAs  include  non-binding  commitments  to \nelectronic submission of trade-related documents.  \n\nElectronic  submission  is  urged  in  KOR-US  and  TPP,  and  is  encouraged  in  WTO  \nTFA.  For  example,  KOR-US  Article  7.2  requires  members  to  \u201cprovide  for  customs \ninformation  to  be  submitted  and  processed  electronically  before  the  goods  arrive  in \norder for them to be released on their arrival\u201d. In WTO TFA, the country\u2019s situation and \ncapacity is considered through the words \u201cas appropriate\u201d when encouraging states to \n\u201cprovide for advance lodging of documents in electronic formats\u201d. \n\nElectronic submission of (air cargo) manifest is specifically promoted in several of the \nagreements.  For  instance,  in  the  article  on  \u201cExpress  Shipment\u201d  in  TPP,  parties  shall \n\u201callow  a  single  submission  of  information  covering  all  goods  contained  in  an  express \nshipment, such as a manifest, through, if possible, electronic means\u201d. \n\nc.  Measures Related to E-system for SPS Certification \n\nSuch  measures  are  usually  found  in  RTA  chapters  dedicated  to  \u201cSanitary  and \nPhytosanitary  Measures\u201d,  when  they  exist.  Only  one  of  the  eight  RTAs  specifically \nrefers to the potential goal of developing an electronic system for SPS certification.  \n\nTPP  indicates  that  \u201cthe  Parties  shall  promote  the  implementation  of  electronic \ncertification and other technologies to facilitate trade\u201d in its Article 7.12 on Certification. \n\nd.  Measures Related to E-system for Certificates of Origin (COO) \n\nPaperless trade  measures  related to  COO  are  usually  found  in  chapters  on  \u201cRules of \nOrigin and Origin Procedures\u201d. Development of electronic systems for COO is implied \nin two of the agreements.  \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nSpecifically,  KOR-US  provides  for  electronic  certification  as  one  option.  Specifically,  \nan  importer  under  KOR-US  can  claim  preferential  tariff  treatment  based  on  \u201ceither  \na  written  or  electronic  certification  by  the  importer,  exporter,  or  producer\u201d.  In  TPP,  a \nCommittee  on  Rules  of Origin  and Origin  Procedures  will  be  established  and  \u201cconsult \non  the  technical  aspects  of  submission  and  the  format  of  the  electronic  certification  \nof origin\u201d. \n\ne.  Measures Related to Electronic Record-keeping \n\nThis type  of  measure  is usually  found  in  the  Article  on  \u201cRecords\u201d  or \u201cRecord  Keeping \nRequirements\u201d  under  the  chapter  of  \u201cRules  of  Origin  and  Origin  Procedures\u201d,  as \ndocuments  subject  to  electronic  record-keeping  requirements  in  RTAs  are  related  to \nCOO  issues  in  most  cases.  Five  of  the  RTAs  provide  for  electronic-record  keeping,  \nbut  only  three  have  specific  provisions  related  to  this  measure  in  their  Rules  of  \nOrigin chapters. \n\nIn  AUS-CHI,  the  members  are  obliged  to  keep  electronic  records  (Article  4.20). \nHowever,  in  KOR-US  (Article  6.17  on  \u201cRecord  Keeping  Requirements\u201d)  and  TPP \n(Article  3.26),  e-record  keeping  is  only  one  of  several  options:  \u201cany  medium  that  \nallows  for  prompt  retrieval,  including  electronic,  optical,  magnetic  or  written  form  in \naccordance  with  that  Party\u2019s  law\u201d  could  be  chosen  by  members.  WTO  TFA  does  not \ninclude any mention of electronic record-keeping. \n\nf.  Measures Related to E-payment System \n\nThis type of measure is not generally featured in RTAs. While the WTO TFA Article 7.2 \nhas  a  separate  provision  on  electronic  payment  indicating  that,  \u201cto  the  extent \npracticable\u201d,  members  shall  \u201cadopt  or  maintain  procedures  allowing  the  option  of \nelectronic payment for duties, taxes, fees, and charges collected by customs incurred \nupon  importation  and  exportation\u201d,  such  specific  measure  related  to  payment  to \ncustoms is absent from any of the eight RTAs reviewed. \n\nHowever,  electronic  payment  is  provided  for  in  a  very  detailed  way  in  TPP  in  the \nChapter  on  \u201cFinancial  Services\u201d  \u2013  with  no  particular focus  on  BtoG transactions. TPP \nmember  states  are  committed  to  providing  the  supply  of  electronic  payment  services \nfor payment card transactions among members. It not only conditions the cross-border \nsupply of this electronic payment service, but also sets clear limits to the supply scope, \nwith  the  exclusion  of  the  transfer  of  funds  to  and  from  transactors\u2019  accounts,  the \nexclusive use of proprietary networks to process, and on business to business basis. In \naddition,  the  section  also  provides  for  public  policy  exception  to  the  supply  of  such \nelectronic payment. \n\ng.  Measures Related to Electronic/Automated Customs System \n\nThe  measures  \u201celectronic/automated  customs  system\u201d  and  \u201cautomated  system  for  \nrisk  management  and  targeting\u201d  are  often  found  in  the  article  of  \u201cAutomation\u201d  under  \nthe  chapter  of  \u201cCustoms  Procedures\u201d.  The  majority  of  the  agreements  reviewed  \n(6  of  8  RTAs)  encourages  establishing  or  developing  electronic/automated  customs \nsystems, while 4 provide specifically for risk management.  \n\nAs can be seen in Box 1, making electronic systems accessible to customs users is a \nbinding commitment in both KOR-VN (Article 4.3) and KOR-US (Article 7.3), as well as \nin TPP (Article 5.6). In contrast, the related provision in AUS-CHI (Article 5.11), which \nis  included  in  an  Article  on  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  has  greater  scope  but  is  of  a  \u201cbest \nendeavour\u201d  nature.  It  also  has  the  particularity  to  stress  the  importance  of  consulting \nwith stakeholders in developing the electronic systems, including businesses. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nWith  regard  to  Automated  System  for  Risk  Management  and  targeting,  it  is  made  \na  requirement  in  the  two  KOR  agreements  as  well  as  the  TPP.  However,  the  TPP \nlanguage  is  more  concise  and  the  measure  is  included  as  part  of  the  Article  on \n\u201cAutomation\u201d (Article 5.6), which also covers the setting up of a single window. \n\nBox 1: Selected Articles Relating to E-Customs System/Customs Automation \n\nKOR-US  \nArticle 7.3: Automation \nEach Party shall use information technology that expedites procedures for the release of \ngoods and shall:  \n(a)  make electronic systems accessible to customs users;  \n(b)  endeavour to use international standards;  \n(c)  endeavour to develop electronic systems that are compatible with the other Party\u2019s \nsystems, in order to facilitate bilateral exchange of international trade data; and \u2028 \n(d)  endeavour to develop a set of common data elements and processes in accordance  \nwith World Customs Organization (WCO) Customs Data Model and related WCO \nrecommendations and guidelines.  \n\n \nArticle 7.4: Risk Management \nEach Party shall adopt or maintain electronic or automated risk management systems for \nassessment and targeting that enable its customs authority to focus its inspection activities \non high-risk goods and that simplify the clearance and movement of low-risk goods. \n \nTPP \nArticle 5.6: Automation \n1.  Each Party shall: \n\n(a)  endeavour to use international standards with respect to procedures for the release  \n\nof goods; \n\n(b)  make electronic systems accessible to customs users; \n(c)  employ electronic or automated systems for risk analysis and targeting; \n(d)  endeavour to implement common standards and elements for import and export data \n\nin accordance with the World Customs Organization (WCO) Data Model; \n\n(e)  take into account, as appropriate, WCO standards, recommendations, models and \n\nmethods developed through the WCO or APEC; and \n\n(f)   work toward developing a set of common data elements that are drawn from the WCO \nData Model and related WCO recommendations as well as guidelines to facilitate \ngovernment to government electronic sharing of data for purposes of analyzing  \ntrade flows. \n\n2.  Each Party shall endeavour to provide a facility that allows importers and exporters to \nelectronically complete standardised import and export requirements at a single entry \npoint. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nh. \n\nMeasures Related to Electronic Single window \n\nMeasures  on  single  window  are  most  commonly  found  in  chapters  dedicated  to \ncustoms  procedures  and  trade  facilitation,  although  at  least  one  RTA  mentions  such \nmeasures  in  its  e-commerce  chapter.  Three  of  the  eight  RTAs  refer  to  the  need  to \nestablish single window facilities. \n\nAUS-CHI  mentions  the  establishment  of  single  window  in  Article  16.9  (\u201cPaperless \nTrading\u201d) under the chapter of Electronic Commerce. In TPP, the term \u201csingle window\u201d \nis not used but the need to develop such facility is specified in the last provision of the \nArticle  on  \u201cAutomation\u201d  (Art.  5.6)  of  the  Customs  and  trade  facilitation  chapter:  \u201cEach \nParty  shall  endeavour  to  provide  a  facility  that  allows  importers  and  exporters  to \nelectronically  complete  standardised  import  and  export  requirements  at  a  single  entry \npoint.\u201d  In  contrast,  the  WTO  TFA  features  a  dedicated  \u201cSingle  Window\u201d  Article,  with \nMembers  expected  to  endeavour  to  maintain  such  facility  and  use  information \ntechnology to support it \u201cto the extent possible and practicable\u201d. \n\nAmong  all  RTAs,  intra-ASEAN  agreements  have  a  special  emphasis  on  electronic \nsingle  window.  Article  49  of  the  ATIGA  indeed  binds  ASEAN  members  to  take \nmeasures  to  establish  not  only  a  national  but  a  regional  single  window,  with  specific \nimplementation  agreements  and  protocols  providing  details  of  what  is  to  be  done  \n(see Box 2). \n\nBox 2: Selected Articles Relating to Single Window \n\nASEAN Trade in Good Agreement \nArticle 49: Establishment of the ASEAN Single Window \nMember States shall undertake necessary measures to establish and operate their \nrespective National Single Windows and the ASEAN Single Window in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement to Establish and Implement the ASEAN Single Window and the \nProtocol to Establish and Implement the ASEAN Single Window. \n \nWTO TFA \nArticle 10.4: Single Window \n4.1 Members shall endeavour to establish or maintain a single window, enabling traders to \nsubmit documentation and/or data requirements for importation, exportation, or transit of \ngoods through a single entry point to the participating authorities or agencies. After the \nexamination by the participating authorities or agencies of the documentation and/or data, \nthe results shall be notified to the applicants through the single window in a timely manner.  \n[..] \n \n4.4 Members shall, to the extent possible and practicable, use information technology to \nsupport the single window. \n\ni.  Measures Related to Laws for Electronic Transactions \n\nProvisions related to establishment of laws for electronic transactions are consistently \nfound  in  Electronic  Commerce  chapters  of  RTAs,  typically  under  a  specific  Article \nfocusing  on  domestic  regulations.  Six  of  the  RTAs  reviewed  include  such  provisions, \nalthough they differ in substance. \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nAs can be seen in Box 3, the JAP-SWI agreement (Article 77 on Domestic Regulation) \nprovides  for  the  most  general  provision,  only  calling  for  transparent  administration  of  \ne-commerce  and  the  need  for  regulations  not  be  burdensome,  on  a  best  endeavour \nbasis.  Other  RTAs  are  more  specific  and  both  KOR-VN  and  TPP  provisions  refer \nspecifically to UNCITRAL instruments.  \n\nBox 3: Selected Articles Relating to Laws for Electronic Transactions \n\nJAP-SWI  \nArticle 77: Domestic Regulation \nEach Party shall endeavour to ensure that all its measures affecting electronic commerce \nare administered in a transparent, objective, reasonable and impartial manner, and are not \nmore burdensome than necessary.  \n \nKOR-VN  \nArticle 10.4: Domestic Regulatory Framework \nEach Party shall endeavour to adopt or maintain its domestic laws and regulations governing \nelectronic transactions taking into account the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic \nCommerce 1996.  \n \nAUS-CHI  \nArticle 16.5: Domestic Electronic Transaction Frameworks \n1.  Each Party shall adopt or maintain measures regulating electronic transactions based on \n\nthe following principles:  \n(a)  a transaction including a contract shall not be denied legal effect, validity or \nenforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of an electronic \ncommunication; and  \n\n(b)  laws should not discriminate arbitrarily between different forms of technology. \n2.  Nothing in paragraph 1 prevents the Parties from making exceptions in their domestic \n\nlaws to the general principles outlined in that paragraph.  \n\n3.  Each Party shall:  \n\n(a)  minimize the regulatory burden on electronic commerce; and  \n(b)  ensure that its measures regulating electronic commerce support industry-led \n\ndevelopment of electronic commerce. \n\n \nTPP  \nArticle 14.5: Domestic Electronic Transactions Framework \n1.  Each Party shall maintain a legal framework governing electronic transactions consistent \nwith the principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 or the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International \nContracts, done at New York, November 23, 2005. \n\n2.  Each Party shall endeavour to:  \n\n(a)  avoid any unnecessary regulatory burden on electronic transactions; and  \n(b)  facilitate input by interested persons in the development of its legal framework for \n\nelectronic transactions. \n\nWhile the KOR-VN only encourages parties to take such instruments into account, the \nTPP requires that member states\u2019 domestic regulations regarding electronic transaction \n\u201cshall  be  consistent  with\u201d  the  principles  of  the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  Electronic \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nCommerce 1996 or the United Nations Electronic Communications Convention, 2005. \nA similar reference to the e-CC is contained in the ASEAN Legal Protocol to the Single \nWindow. The provisions regarding laws on electronic transactions in AUS-CHI are also \nstated  in  a  more  detailed  way,  setting  various  principles  to  be  followed  by  parties  in \ndeveloping  legislation  in  this  area.  The  special  emphasis  on  supporting  \u201cindustry-led \ndevelopment of electronic commerce\u201d is worth noting in this regard. \n\nj.  Measures Related to Promoting E-certification and E-signature \n\nThese  measures  are  typically  found  in  the  articles  titled  \u201cElectronic  Authentication\u201d \nand/or  \u201cElectronic  Signature\u201d 19 under  the  chapter  of  Electronic  Commerce.  All  eight \nRTAs reviewed feature some more or less specific provisions in this area. \n\nSING-IND  does  not  feature  detailed  provisions  on  electronic  authentication  and \nelectronic signature, nor does the WTO TFA. In contrast, other RTAs generally seek to \npromote  acceptance  and  mutual  recognition  of  electronic  authentication  and \nsignatures,  including  by  encouraging  the  parties  to  maintain  flexible  and  technology \nneutral  laws  and  regulations  in  this  area.  In  KOR-US  and  TPP,  this  is  done  by \nspecifying  what  type  of  legislation  parties  should  not  adopt,  e.g.,  laws  that  would \n\u201cprohibit parties to an electronic transaction from mutually determining the appropriate \nauthentication  methods  for  that  transaction\u201d  (TPP  Article  14.6)  or  \u201cdeny  a  signature \nlegal  validity  solely  on  the  basis  that  the  signature  is  in  electronic  form\u201d  (KOR-US \nArticle 15.4). \n\nKOR-VN and AUS-CHI agreements take a more \u201cpositive\u201d approach with the relevant \nArticles instead indicating that \u201cshall adopt or maintain measures regulating electronic \nauthentication\u201d  (AUS-CHI  Article  16.6)  that  would,  for  example,  permit  parties  to \nmutually  determine  the  appropriate  authentication  methods  and  \u201cnot  limit  the \nrecognition of authentication technologies or implementation models\u201d (KOR-VN Article \n10.3).20 Both agreements also commit parties to work towards the mutual recognition of \ndigital  certificates  and  electronic  signature  at  the  governmental  level,  and  based  on \ninternational  standards,  suggesting  a  higher  level  of  overall  commitment  that  in  many \nother RTAs. Interoperability of electronic authentication and/or digital certificates is also \nencouraged in both the agreements, as well as in the TPP. \n\nk.  Measures Related to Trade-related Electronic Data Exchange \n\n\u201cTrade-related  electronic  data  exchange\u201d  among  parties,  or  cross-border  paperless \ntrade,  is  often  promoted  under  the  Articles  of  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  in  E-commerce \nchapters  or  \u201cAutomation\u201d  in  Customs  chapters.  Five  of  the  RTAs  reviewed  include \nrelated provisions. \n\nCommitments  in  this  area  are  typically  on  a  best  endeavour  basis,  with  the  notable \nexception  of  ASEAN,  which  features  binding  and  detailed  commitments  on  electronic \nexchange  of  data  among  members  under  its  ASEAN  Single  Window  (ASW) \nAgreement. \n\nAmong the other agreements reviewed, KOR-US, KOR-VN and TPP stand out in terms \nof making reference to specific international standards \u201cto facilitate bilateral exchange \nof  international  trade  data\u201d  (KOR-US  Article  7.3).  For  example,  in  Article  5.6  on \n\n                                                \n19  Articles  on  e-transaction  laws  which  reference  UNCITRAL  instruments  also  indirectly  cover  these \nissues.  In  many  cases,  the  RTA  Articles  on  \u201ce-signature\u201d  simply  restate  key  underlying  principles  of \nUNCITRAL texts. \n\n20  This provision reflects the principle of \u201ctechnology neutrality\u201d featured in UNCITRAL text as well as the \n\nnew FA-PT text. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nAutomation, TPP  Parties  are  committed  to \u201cwork  toward  developing  a  set  of  common \ndata  elements  that  are  drawn  from  the  WCO  Data  Model  and  related  WCO \nrecommendations  as  well  as  guidelines  to  facilitate  government  to  government \nelectronic sharing of data for purposes of analysing trade flows\u201d. While JAP-SWI, AUS-\nCHI  and  AANZ  may  not  feature  direct  provisions  on  exchanging  trade-related  data \nelectronically,  an  implicit  commitment  to  it  is  made  in  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  Articles, \nwhich all include a provision that \u201cParties shall cooperate bilaterally [\u2026] to enhance the \nacceptance of electronic versions of trade administration documents.\u201d \n\nWith  regard  to  the  four  sub-measures,  they  are  often  specified  under  the  specific \nchapters  of  \u201cRules  of  Origin  and  Origin  Procedures\u201d,  \u201cSanitary  and  Phytosanitary \nMeasures\u201d,  \u201cBarriers  to  Trade\u201d  and  \u201cFinancial  Service\u201d  respectively.  TPP  is  the  only \nAgreement which has a specific commitment to exchange of information on SPS issues \nby  electronic  means,  although  it  is  limited  to  \u201cpossible\u201d  cases.  In  contrast,  electronic \nexchange  of  TBT-related  information  is  discussed  in  several  agreements,  although \nagain on a \u201cbest endeavour\u201d basis. \n\nAmong the RTAs reviewed in details, four agreements (US-KOR, JAP-SWI, AANZ and \nTPP) cover the electronic exchange of financial information. JAP-SWI uses \u201cnegative\u201d \nlanguage and states that: \u201cNeither party shall take measures that prevent transfers of \ninformation  into  or  out  of  its  Area  or  the  processing  of  financial  information,  including \ntransfers of data by electronic means\u201d where such transfers [...] are necessary for the \nconduct  of  the  ordinary  business  of  a  financial  supplier  of  the  other  party\u201d.  In  the \nchapter of financial services, the TPP urges members to allow electronic exchange of \nfinancial  information,  with  an  exception  for  protecting  personal  information  and  a \nrequirement of obtaining prior authorization. \n\nl.  Measures Related to International Standards for Paperless Trade \n\nMeasures related to the use of international standards for paperless trade are normally \nfound either in Articles on \u201cAutomation\u201d in Customs chapters, or in \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d \nArticles in e-commerce chapters. All but one of the RTAs reviewed, as well as the WTO \nTFA,  refer  to  and/or  take  into  account  international  standards  when  implementing \nvarious paperless trade measures. \n\nFor  example,  parties  in  TPP  and  KOR-VN  shall  \u201cendeavour  to  use  international \nstandards\u201d  when  automating  customs  systems.  The  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  Article  in \nAUS-CHI  refers  to  the  need  to  establish  single  window  by  \u201cincorporating  relevant \ninternationals standards\u201d. The ASEAN ATIGA Article 58 on \u201cApplication of Information \nTechnology\u201d also states that \u201cMember States, where applicable, shall apply information \ntechnology  in  customs  operations  based  on  internationally  accepted  standards  for \nexpeditious customs clearance and release of goods.\u201d \n\nAs  noted  earlier,  some  paperless  trade  provisions  go  a  step  further  and  mention \nspecific  standards  or  conventions  and  recommendations  to  guide  implementation  \n\u2013 in particular in the TPP. In contrast, while the WTO TFA has a dedicated Article on \n\u2018Use  of  International  Standards\u2019  (Article  10.3)  in  regulating  formalities  of  importation, \nexportation,  and  transit,  it  is  not  specifically  related  to  application  of  information \ntechnology  and  does  not  specify  a  set  of  standards  or  recommendations.  It  does, \nhowever,  encourage  parties  to  use  and  prepare  and  review  periodically  relevant \ninternational  standards  and  establish  a  committee  which  works \nthe \nimplementation of international standards. \n\ntowards \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\n4.3  Linkages with the Framework Agreement on Facilitation  \nof Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific \n\nThe  \u201cFramework  Agreement  on  Facilitation  of  Cross-Border  Paperless  Trade  in  Asia \nand  the  Pacific\u201d  (FA-PT)  opened  for  signature  on  1  October  2016,  as  the  newest  UN \ntreaty  in  the  area  of  trade  and  development. 21 The  FA-PT  is  not  a  regional  trade \nagreement  in  the  common  sense  of  the  term,  as  it  does  not  include  any  trade \nliberalization  commitments  and  focuses  solely  on  enabling  cross-border  trade-related \nelectronic  data  exchange  among  parties.  It  has  been  described  as  a  regional  \u201cdigital \ncomplement\u201d  to  the  WTO  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement.22 Developed  and  negotiated  \nby  ESCAP  Member  States  following  adoption  of  a  resolution  on  Enabling  Paperless \nTrade  [\u2026]  for  inclusive  and  sustainable  intraregional  trade  facilitation  in  2012,  it  can  \nbe  expected  to  provide  a  supportive  and  dedicated  framework  to  accelerate  the \nharmonized  implementation  of  paperless  trade  commitments  made  by  ESCAP \nMembers with each other through RTAs. \n\nBox 4: Objective of the Framework Agreement on Facilitation  \nof Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific \n\nArticle 1 Objective  \nThe  objective  of  the  present  Framework  Agreement  is  to  promote  cross-border  paperless \ntrade by enabling the exchange and mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents \nin  electronic  form  and  facilitating  interoperability  among  national  and  subregional  single \nwindows and/or other paperless trade systems, for the purpose of making international trade \ntransactions more efficient and transparent while improving regulatory compliance. \n\nA  review  of  the  provisions  of  the  FA-PT  against  the  paperless  trade  measures  and \nprovisions in the selected RTAs confirms indeed that the FA-PT guiding principles are \nnot  only  consistent  with those found  in  RTA,  but  that  participation  in  the FA-PT  could \nindeed help countries fulfil or better implement several of their RTA commitments. For \nexample, as noted earlier, a common provision in \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Articles in RTAs \nis  that  parties  will  exchange  views  and/or  cooperate  with  each  other  as  well  as \ninternationally to enhance the acceptance of electronic documents; Participation in the \nFA-PT  would  readily  meet  RTA  partners\u2019  commitment  to  cooperate  internationally  on \npaperless trade. In particular, one of the most far reaching components of the FA-PT is \nArticle  8  on  \u201cCross-border  mutual  recognition  of  trade-related  data  and  documents  in \nelectronic form.\u201d Implementation of this provision is expected to potentially enable the \nelectronic exchange and legal recognition of various trade-related data and documents \nsuch  as  electronic  COO,  SPS  certificates  and  TBT  certificates,  as  envisaged  in  \nvarious RTAs. \n\nSome  RTAs  (e.g.,  KOR-VN  and  AANZ)  also  commit  parties  to  \u201cwork  towards  the \nimplementation  of  initiatives  which  provide  for  the  use  of  paperless  trading\u201d.  FA-PT \nArticle  13  on  \u201cPilot  projects  and  sharing  of  lessons  learned\u201d,  where  \u201cThe  Parties  \nshall  endeavour  to  initiate  and  launch  pilot  projects  on  cross-border  exchange  of  \n\n                                                \n21  Any of the 53 Member States of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific  (ESCAP)  may  become  a  party.  See:  http://www.unescap.org/resources/framework-agreement-\nfacilitation-cross-border-paperless-trade-asia-and-pacific  \n\n22  http://www.tfafacility.org/new-un-treaty-facilitate-paperless-trade-asia-and-pacific-support-trade-\n\nfacilitation-agreement \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\ntrade-related  data  and  documents  in  electronic  form\u201d  would  certainly  support \nimplementation of such RTA commitments. \n\nImportantly,  our  analysis  of  RTAs  revealed  that  implementation  of  paperless  trade  on \nthe  basis  of  international  standards  was  one  of  the  most  common  features  and \nprovisions  among  agreements  that  did  address  paperless  trade  issues.  Such  an \napproach is also consistent with that of the FA-PT Article 9 on \u201cInternational Standards \nfor  exchange  of  trade-related  data  and  documents  in  electronic  form\u201d,  stating  that \nParties  \u201cshall  endeavour  to  apply  international  standards  and  guidelines  in  order  to \nensure  interoperability  in  paperless  trade  and  to  develop  safe,  secure  and  reliable \nmeans of communication for the exchange of data\u201d, as well as \u201cendeavour to become \ninvolved  in  the  development  of  international  standards  and  best  practices  related  \nto  cross-border  paperless  trade.\u201d  The  first  four  \u201cGeneral  Principles\u201d  (Article  5)  of  the  \nFA-PT  \u2013  (a)  Functional  equivalence;  (b)  Non-discrimination  of  the  use  of  electronic \ncommunications; (c) Technological neutrality; (d) Promotion of interoperability \u2013 are in \nparticular directly related to those established and promoted in UNCITRAL instruments \nreferred  to  in  several  RTA  provisions  related  to  legislation  on  electronic  transaction \nand/or e-signatures. \n\nBuilding on these intentional standards and principles, the FA-PT provides more details \non  how  some  of  the  paperless  trade  provisions  in  RTAs  may  be  implemented.  For \nexample,  on  single  window,  the  FA-PT  does  not  only  encourage  Parties  to  establish \nsingle  windows,  as  the WTO TFA  and  several RTAs  already  do,  but  encourage them  \nto  \u201cuse  them  for  cross-border  paperless  trade\u201d.  It  also  provides  an  intergovernmental \nand institutional framework to do so, with establishment of a Paperless Trade Council \nand  working  groups,  and  the  development  of  individual  and  regional  action  plans. \nLooking  forward,  Parties  may  reflect  relevant  commitments  made  through  RTAs  in \nthese action plans. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nThe  analysis  presented  in  this  paper  reveals  that  the  number  of  paperless  trade \nmeasures  in  RTAs  entered  into  force  globally  since  2005  essentially  doubled,  with  \na  large  majority  of  RTAs  now  featuring  one  more  measures  aiming  to  exchange  \ntrade-related  data  and  information  electronically.  In  many  cases,  recent  RTAs  are \nfound  to  go  further  than  the  WTO  TFA  in  promoting  digital  trade  facilitation  and  \nthe  application  of  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  to  trade \nprocedures \u2013 with the possible exception of e-payment of duties and fees, which is not \nspecifically  mentioned  in  any  of  the  RTAs  reviewed.  While  30  of  the  138  RTAs \nreviewed feature  one  or more  Articles  dedicated to \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d  or \u201cPaperless \nTrade  Administration\u201d,  provisions  related  to  more  specific  paperless  trade  measures \nare  found  in  different  chapters,  including  but  not  limited  to  chapters  on  Customs  and \ntrade facilitation as well as on e-commerce. \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nMany  of  the  recent  RTAs  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  implicitly  or  explicitly  call  upon  the \nparties to develop electronic exchange of trade-related data and documents and work \ntowards  interoperability of  paperless trade  systems.  However, they  provide  little  detail \non  how  to  do  so  beyond  recommending  cooperation  among  the  Parties  taking  into \naccount existing international standards and tools. In this context, the new UN treaty on \nfacilitation  of  cross-border  paperless  trade  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific (FA-PT)  provides  a \nuseful multilateral framework through which paperless trade-related RTA commitments \nmay be concretized. \n\nLooking  forward,  more  research  may  be  undertaken  on  the  extent  to  which  countries \nhave  implemented  the  various  paperless  trade  measures  they  have  committed  to \nthrough  RTAs.  Preliminary  evidence  points  to  countries  having  achieved  partial \nimplementation at best. Even in the case of ASEAN, which has shown strong (binding) \ncommitments  to  cross-border  paperless  trade  through  ATIGA  and  its  related  ASEAN \nSingle  Window  Agreement,  implementation  has  been  much  slower  than  expected.  In \nthis  context,  the  new  FA-PT  stands  as  a  potentially  useful  tool  for  RTA  members  \nto  share  experience  and  cooperate  with  a  wider  set  of  trade  partners  committed  \nto  paperless  trade,  providing  new  knowledge  and  renewed  impetus  to  accelerate \nimplementation of RTA commitments. \n\nFurther efforts may also be useful in refining the typology of paperless trade measures \nand provisions proposed in this paper. Similarly, more work may be needed to improve \nthe  accuracy  of  the  RTA  ratings  in  terms  of  depth  of  coverage  and  commitments  to \npaperless trade,  in  particular  by more fully  taking  into  account  the  nature  and  level  of \nbindings of each provision across a larger set of agreements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 747 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nDuval and Mengjing \n\nECSG Chair. 2004. \u201cAPEC's Strategies and Actions Toward A Cross-Border Paperless \n\nTrading Environment\u201d.

It  is  rapidly \nbecoming essential to maintaining trade competitiveness and enabling effective participation \nin  cross-border  e-commerce.  This  paper  examines  the  extent  to  which  measures  aimed  \nat  dematerializing  trade  data  and  documents  and  enabling  their  electronic  exchange, \ncommonly  referred  to  as  paperless  trade  measures,  are  included  in  regional  trade \nagreements  (RTAs),  including  in  the  Trans-Pacific  Partnership  and  ASEAN  agreements. \nSuch  measures  are  most  commonly  found  in  RTA  chapters  on  e-commerce  or  in  those \ndedicated to Customs and trade facilitation. Their number is found to have doubled in RTAs \nbetween  2005-8  and  2013-16  at  the  global  level.  Most  recent  RTAs  also  contain  more  \nand  deeper  paperless  trade  provisions  than  those  featured  in  the  WTO  Trade  Facilitation \nAgreement.  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  paperless  trade  measures  included  in  selected  \nRTAs in Asia and the Pacific confirms that the coverage of RTAs of paperless trade issues \nhas become extensive, covering increasingly specific areas such as electronic certificates of \norigins  and  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  certificates.  In  that  context,  the  new  Framework \nAgreement  on  Facilitation  of  Cross-Border  Paperless  Trade  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  can  be \nexpected to provide a useful tool for harmonized implementation of many of these provisions. \n \nKeywords:  regional  trade  agreements,  paperless  trade,  trade  facilitation,  digital  trade, \nelectronic  certificates,  trade  integration,  regional  cooperation,  free  trade  agreements,  \ncross-border paperless trade, e-commerce, treaty, RTAs, WTO, ESCAP, Asia, Pacific \n \nJEL Classification: F10, F13, F15, O14 \n \n", " \n", " \n"]}
