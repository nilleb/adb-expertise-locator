INTRODUCTION \nAs  part  of  their  continuous  efforts  to  harness  international  trade  for  sustainable \ndevelopment,  Asia  and  the  Pacific  economies  have  long  strived  to  make  trade \nprocedures as efficient as possible, in particular through implementation of automated \ncustoms  systems,  electronic  single  windows  and  other  digital  customs  and  trade \nfacilitation initiatives. These paperless trade measures are rapidly becoming essential \nnot only to maintain trade competitiveness, but also to address the trade control and \nlogistics challenges associated with an increase in small shipments and cross-border  \ne-commerce.1 \nPaperless trade generally refers to the conduct of international trade transactions using \nelectronic rather than paper-based data and documents.2 It is more formally defined as \ntrade \u201ctaking place on the basis of electronic communications, including exchange of \ntrade-related data and documents in electronic form\u201d in the Framework Agreement on \nFacilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific (FA-PT) adopted \nby Member States of United Nations ESCAP in May 2016.3 While the ultimate goal of \npaperless  trade  is  to  dematerialize  all  information  flows  associated  with  a  given \ntransaction for all stakeholders, paperless trade initiatives generally focus on facilitating \ndata  and  documents  flows  between  businesses  and  government  (BtoG)  and/or \nbetween governments (GtoG).4 \nPaperless trade generates significant economy-wide savings, including direct savings \nto traders in the form of lower compliance costs, as well as indirect savings from faster \nmovement of goods and lower inventory costs.5 It also enhances opportunities for \nSMEs  to  participate  in  cross-border  trade,  affords  timely  availability  of  shipping \ndocuments and reduces errors associated with re-keying of data.6 In addition, through \nreduction in clearance times, it can increase port efficiency and reduce port congestion \nand related problems.7 Potential annual export gains associated with moving from \nmanual paper-based trade to paperless trade have been estimated at between USD \n36 billion and 257 billion in Asia and the Pacific, depending on the extent of automation \nand dematerialization of procedures and documents.8  \n                                                \n1  UNCTAD (2015), among others, indicate that cross-border e-commerce has led to a 48% growth in the \nvolume of international deliveries of small packets between 2011 and 2014. The etradeforall.org \ninitiative identifies trade logistics and facilitation as one of seven key areas for e-trade development. \n2  Sung Heun Ha and Sang Won Lim (2014). \n3  This new United Nations treaty, dedicated to enabling paperless trade among Asia and the Pacific \nmember States opened for signature and ratification or accession in New York on 1 October 2016. See: \nhttp://www.unescap.org/resources/framework-agreement-facilitation-cross-border-paperless-trade-asia-\nand-pacific \n4  This is in contrast to e-commerce, where the focus is generally on facilitating exchange of information \nbetween business and consumers (BtoC) and/or between businesses (BtoB). In the international trade \ncontext, paperless trade is seen as an enabler of cross-border e-commerce, with general provisions on \n\u201cpaperless trade\u201d or \u201cpaperless trading\u201d increasingly included in e-commerce chapters of regional trade \nor economic partnership agreements (e.g., in the TPP). \n5  See for example, UNNExT Briefs on single window implementation in Republic of Korea, as well as \nSenegal, Singapore and Thailand. http://unnext.unescap.org \n6  See for example, Laryea (2005). \n7  See Laryea (2002). \n8  Shepherd and Duval (2015). This is made possible by the very significant time and cost savings \nassociated with the digitalization of the entire trade process, with direct cost savings alone estimated at \nUSD 7 billion annually in Asia and the Pacific - and time savings in the export process of at least 24%. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nImportantly, the use of electronic rather than paper documents can also help enhance \nregulatory control and compliance by governments, especially when relevant data and \ndocuments can be exchanged among agencies and across borders. In particular, the \navailability or more accurate and timely data in electronic form can enable trade control \nagencies to more efficiently evaluate the compliance risks associated with individual \nshipments,  enabling  them  to  identify  high-risk  transactions,  ultimately  boosting \nCustoms revenue while also speeding up the trade of compliant traders.9  \nOverall,  the  significant  benefits  for  both  Governments  and  traders  have  led  an \nincreasing  number  of  countries  to  promote  paperless  trade,  including  as  part  of \nmultilateral and preferential trade agreements. Accordingly, this paper analyzes the \nextent to which recent preferential trade agreements have included provisions related \nto paperless trade globally, also using the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) as \na reference. Results provide insights and models for future negotiations in this area, as \nwell as for implementation of the FA-PT. \nOur analysis reveals that more than half of the trade agreements which have entered \ninto  force  since  2005  globally  (90  of  138)  include  paperless  trade  measures  or \nprovisions.  Thirty  (30)  of  these  RTAs  reviewed  in  this  study  contain  a  dedicated \nprovision titled \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d or \u201cPaperless Trade Administration\u201d, typically found \neither in the Chapter on e-commerce, or the one dealing with Customs procedures and \ntrade facilitation (See Annex 1 for the list of RTAs examined). As shown in Figure 1, the \ndetailed analysis presented in this paper reveals that the number of paperless trade \nmeasures included in RTAs almost doubled between 2005\u20132008 and 2013\u201316. While \nthe impact of including such measures and provisions in trade agreements is difficult to \nmeasure, the willingness of Governments to systematically include commitments in this \narea is a welcome development. \nFigure 1: Number of Paperless Trade Measures in RTAs (2005\u20132016) \n \nSource: Authors. \n \n                                                \n9  For example, Ghana Customs reports that its electronic Single Window launched in 2015 helped  \nboost revenue collection by almost 15% in one year, while cutting down waiting time and approval  \nfor classification of goods from 2 weeks to 2 days \u2013 See more at: http://thebftonline.com/business/ \neconomy/21250/single-window-boosts-revenue-collection-148-in-one-year.html#sthash.bASAWHGE \n.dpuf  \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nThe paper is organized as follows: the next section presents a typology of paperless \ntrade measures and provisions in RTAs, providing a basis for the evaluation of the \npaperless trade coverage of such agreements. The results of the evaluation are then \npresented, highlighting differences in coverage by geographic regions and identifying \nthe least and most common measures included in RTAs. This is followed by a more \ndetailed analysis of selected RTAs in the Asia and the Pacific region, including a \ncomparative analysis of \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d/\u201dPaperless Trade Administration\u201d Articles \nand an assessment of relevant paperless trade measures in terms of substance and \nnature (binding vs. best endeavour). Linkages to provisions featured in the new FA-PT \nare then discussed, followed by conclusions. \n2.  TYPOLOGY OF PAPERLESS TRADE  \nRELATED PROVISIONS  \nAn initial starting point for the development of a list of paperless trade measures and \nprovisions is the United Nations Regional Commissions (UNRCs) Global Survey on \nTrade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation (TFPI).10 The paperless trade \nand cross-border paperless trade measures included in the 2015 UNRCs TFPI Survey \nare shown in Table 1. \nPaperless  trade  measures  featured  in  the  TFPI  Survey  include  the  establishment  \nof  electronic  automated  customs  system  and  electronic  single  window  system, \nelectronic  submission  of  trade-related  documents  including  trade  licenses,  sea/air \ncargo manifests and customs declarations, and electronic application and issuance of \ntrade licenses and preferential certificate of origin. Furthermore, there are six measures \nrelated to cross-border paperless trade in the survey. Apart from the general measure \n\u201cEngagement of the country in trade-related cross-border electronic data exchange \nwith other countries\u201d, the measures aiming at exchanging specific documents such  \nas Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Certificates and Certificates of Origin (COO) \nelectronically are included. In addition, two of the measures, Laws and regulations for \nelectronic transactions and Recognized certification authority issuing digital certificates \nto traders to conduct electronic transactions, are basic building blocks towards enabling \nthe exchange and mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents among \nstakeholders within a country and also along the entire international supply chain.11  \nFollowing  an  initial  review  of  preferential  trade  agreements,  however,  most  of  the \nmeasures listed in the TFPI Survey were not frequently found in RTA provisions, \nprobably because such measures were too \u201capplied\u201d and specific to be included in \nsuch \u2013generally quite broad - legal instruments. We therefore further developed the list \nof paperless trade measures and provisions based on an iterative review of the text of \nagreements included in the WTO Regional Trade Agreements Information System \n(RTA-IS). \n   \n                                                \n10  Available  at:  https://unnext.unescap.org/content/global-survey-trade-facilitation-and-paperless-trade-\nimplementation-2015  \n11  Id \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nTable 1: Paperless Trade Measures included in the UNRC Global Survey  \non Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation 2015 \nPaperless trade   15.

The  WTO  Trade  Facilitation \nAgreement (TFA) is also used as a benchmark in the analysis. The complete list of the \nRTAs reviewed is available in Annex 1. \nIn line with the TFPI Survey, we adopted a broad definition of paperless trade in \nidentifying relevant measures and provisions, looking for mentions of related keywords, \nin  particular  \u201cinformation  and  communication  technologies\u201d,  \u201cinternet\u201d  \u201celectronic\u201d, \n\u201cautomation\u201d, and \u201cpaperless\u201d, in chapters of the agreement covering not only trade \nfacilitation and customs procedures but also those covering rules of origin, technical \nbarriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, financial services, as well as \nelectronic commerce. However, the scope of paperless trade was not extended to \nchapters or sections related to transport and logistics services liberalization, mobility of \nbusiness people, government procurement and intellectual property. \n   \n                                                \n12  The WTO RTA-IS included 156 RTAs which had entered into force on or after 2005, but RTAs whose \ntexts are only available in Spanish and Russian were not reviewed. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nA typology of 27 paperless trade measures and provisions was ultimately developed, \nas  shown  in  Table  2.  While  some  of  the  measures  and  provisions  included  are \nrelatively general (e.g. \u201cE-submission/processing of trade-related data/documents\u201d), we \nalso included much more specific and sometimes overlapping measures and provisions  \nin  order  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  content  and  depth  of  the  various \nAgreements. Specific measures and provisions related to a more general measure \nincluded in table 2 are specified in italic immediately under such measure. We also try \nto distinguish between paperless trade measures and provisions focusing on exchange \nof information in electronic form between stakeholders domestically (measures and \nprovisions No. 1\u201314) from those more directly related to cross-border electronic data \nand document exchanges (measures No. 15\u201327). Finally, in line with the content of \nsome of the most recent agreements and their e-commerce chapters, the typology \nemphasizes provisions related to e-certificates and e-signatures (16\u201321), focusing on \ntheir mutual recognition and interoperability in particular.13 \nTable 2: Typology of Paperless Trade Measures and Provisions in PTAs \n  Measure/Provision  Note \n1  Acceptance of e-copies  This refers to accepting trade administration documents submitted electronically  \nas the legal equivalent of the paper version of these documents.  \n(e.g., Australia-Japan EPA Art. 13.9) \n2  E-submission/processing  This includes the provision of advance lodging of electronic documents for  \nof trade-related data/  pre-arrival processing, the electronic submission and processing of information \ndocuments   necessary for the release of an express consignment before the express \nconsignment arrives; and submission of a single document covering all  \ngoods imported in express consignment through electronic means.  \n(e.g., Rep. of Korea-New Zealand FTA Art.4.4, 4.7,4.8) \n3  E-submission of Sea  Measure included in the TFPI survey \u2013 and also covered by the WCO Revised \nCargo Manifests  Kyoto Convention and relevant International Maritime Organization (IMO) \nagreements \n4  E-submission of Air Cargo  Refers to the submission of a manifest covering all goods contained in an express \nManifests  shipment through electronic means.

PAPERLESS TRADE COVERAGE OF REGIONAL \nTRADE AGREEMENTS  \nIn order to provide an overall picture of the paperless trade coverage in recent RTAs, \nwe review how many of the 27 measures identified above are included in each of the \nRTAs included in the study.14 For each measure in table 2, an agreement gets a \u201c1\u201d if \nthe measure is mentioned in any form or language, i.e., regardless of whether it is \nsimply authorized or encouraged, or whether it is formulated as a binding or exclusive \ncommitment \u2013 and a \u201c0\u201d otherwise. Ninety RTAs (66%) are found to contain at least \none paperless trade measure.15  \nFigure 2 shows how many paperless trade measures are mentioned in each of the \nRTAs which are signed by East Asian economies \u2013 Similar figures for other Asian \nsubregions and other world regions are available in Annex 2.  \nAs  illustrated  in  figure  2,  among  all  agreements  considered,  the  Trans-Pacific \nPartnership (TPP) Agreement has the highest number of paperless trade measures;  \nIts text refers to 21 of the 27 measures and provisions considered in our analysis. This \nagreement is not only the largest but also the newest of the regional agreements \nconsidered  in  this  study  \u2013  and  the  only  one  that  has  not  yet  entered  into  force  \n\u2013, providing further evidence of the growing interest in cross-border paperless trade. \nThe second most comprehensive agreement on paperless trade is the United States \n(US)-Republic of Korea (RoK) agreement (\u201cKOR-US\u201d), with 15 measures included, \nfollowed  by  the  bilateral  agreements  between  Republic  of  Korea  and  Viet  Nam  \n(\u201cKOR-VN\u201d) featuring 14).16 As a reference, the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement \n(TFA) only features 5 measures and provisions on paperless trade. \nFigure 3 shows the average number of paperless trade measures in RTAs signed by \ncountries from different world regions. Within Asia and the Pacific, Australia and New-\nZealand  seem  to  have  the  RTAs featuring the  largest  number  of  paperless trade \nmeasures (9.2), followed by East Asian economies (7.1), led by Republic of Korea. \nThe average number of paperless trade shown in the agreements signed by South-\nEast Asian economies is 6.8. Singapore, as the economy which has signed the highest \nnumber of RTAs containing paperless trade measures, leads South-East Asia in this \narea (see Figure A2.1 in Annex 2). In general, ASEAN plays an active role in including \npaperless trade measures in RTA rule-making. For instance, Intra-ASEAN agreements \ncontain 10 paperless trade measures. But the content of its ASEAN+ agreements vary \nwidely, from 12 measures featured in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA to only 1 \nin the case, for example, of the ASEAN-India FTA. \n   \n                                                \n14  More information on the RTAs included is available in Annex 1. \n15  The same weight is given to all 27 measures, although arguments could be made that some measures \nare more important or far reaching than others. It is worth noting, however, that the same RTAs emerge \nas paperless trade \u201cleaders\u201d when only general measures are counted (i.e., the 12 sub measures \nshown in italic in table 2 are excluded from the analysis). \n16  Many of the most comprehensive RTAs in terms of paperless trade are between Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) member economies. APEC, through its Electronic Commerce Steering Group and \nPaperless Trade Subgroup (ECSG), has actively promoted paperless trading among its members, in \nparticular between 2002 and 2012. See, e.g., ECSG (2004).  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nFigure 2: Paperless Trade Coverage in RTAs of East Asian  \nEconomies since 2005 \n \nNote: the figure shows the number of paperless trade measures mentioned in each agreement (out of 27). \nSource: Authors. \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nFigure 3: Paperless Trade Coverage of RTAs in Different World Regions  \nsince 2005 \n \nSource: Authors. \nThe  average  number  of  paperless  trade  measures  mentioned  in  RTAs  signed  \nby  Central  and  South  Asian  as  well  as  Middle-East  economies  is  merely  4  (see \nFigure A2.2).  India  leads  that  region  with  the  highest  number  of  RTAs  involving \npaperless trade measures (5), three of which have the same or higher number of \npaperless trade measures than that in the WTO TFA. \nInterestingly, while the European Union (EU) has strived to develop paperless trade \nsystems among its members,17 our analysis suggests that it has put limited emphasis \non paperless trade in its RTAs, with an average number of paperless trade measures \n(4)  barely  on  par  with  that  of  the  WTO  TFA  (Figure  A2.3).  In  contrast,  many  \nRTAs signed by North American economies, in particular United States and Canada, \nfeature 8 or more paperless trade measures (Figure A2.4). RTAs signed by Caribbean, \nCentral American and South American Economies also feature a significant number of \npaperless trade measures, in part because many of these agreements involve the \nUnited States or other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member countries \n(Figure A2.5). Peru leads other developing American economies in this area, being \nboth the country with the highest number of RTAs containing paperless trade measures \nand member of one of the most comprehensive RTA in this area (US-Peru FTA). \n3.1  Frequency of Paperless Trade Measures in RTAs \nThe paperless trade content of RTAs appear to be relatively diverse, with no single \nmeasure included in our typology mentioned in more than half of the 90 RTAs featuring \nat least one paperless trade related measure or provision. As shown in Figure 4, the \nuse of International standards for electronic exchange of data and documents is most \nfrequently mentioned in RTAs (47%), along with provisions on Promoting e-certification \nand e-signatures (47%) and the need for laws to enable electronic transactions (44%). \nOther  more  frequently  mentioned  general  measures  in  the  RTAs  include  general \n                                                \n17 See, e.g., Decision on a Paperless Environment for Customs and Trade by the European Parliament \nand the Council of the Council of the European Union (2008).  \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nprovisions encouraging Electronic submission of trade-related data and documents, \nElectronic record keeping, and Acceptance of electronic copies. \nInterestingly,  several  specific  measures  are  also  frequently  mentioned.  Measures \nrelated to Electronic exchange of information on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) \nacross  borders  are  mentioned  in  more  than  44%  of  the  RTAs  with  at  least  one \npaperless trade measures,18 while 38% of these RTAs mention electronic or automated \ncustoms systems (37%). Measures related to the Electronic transmission of financial \ninformation across border between banks or private parties are also found in more than \n27% of the RTAs. \nFigure 4: Frequency of Paperless Trade Measures and Provision in Regional \nTrade Agreements since 2005 \n \nNote: the figure shows the percentage of RTAs (among the 90 containing at least one paperless trade measures) which \nfeature provisions related to each of the paperless trade measures considered. \nSource: Authors. \n                                                \n18  As mentioned in table 2, e-exchange of TBT related information includes such methods as electronic \nmail, teleconferencing, videoconferencing (e.g., Australia-Rep. of Korea FTA Art. 5.10). \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nThe  notion  of  electronic  systems  to  facilitate  inter-agency  communications  and \ncollaboration is featured in some form in nearly 25% of the RTAs with at least one \npaperless trade measure. However, \u201cSingle Window\u201d facilities, which are the subject of \na dedicated provision in the WTO TFA, are specifically mentioned in only 5% of the \nRTAs. Various other specific measures which can, in principle, be integrated to either \nthe national single window or the e-customs systems are mentioned in less than 5% of \nthe RTAs, including e-payment systems or electronic systems for SPS certification or to \nobtain relevant import/export permit or licenses. Aside from electronic exchange of TBT \nand financial  information,  our  analysis  shows  that  indeed \u201ccross-border\u201d  paperless \ntrade measures and provisions tend to be less readily featured in RTAs than \u201cdomestic\u201d \npaperless  trade  measures.  Provisions  calling  for  Mutual  recognition  of  digital \ncertificates and electronic signature, as well as Promoting the cross-border electronic \nexchange of trade-related data and documents are featured in roughly 20% of the \nRTAs  with  at  least  one  paperless  trade  measure.  Specific  provisions  related  to \nelectronic exchange of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) information and to certificates \nof origins (COOs) are featured in 16% and 12% of these RTAs, respectively. \n4.  A CLOSER LOOK: PAPERLESS TRADE  \nIN SELECTED RTAS IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC  \nThe analysis presented above provided an overview of the type of paperless trade \nmeasures that are covered in RTAs and the extent to which RTAs signed by various \ncountries emphasize paperless trade. In an effort to get deeper insights, we take a \ncloser  look  at  a  small  sample  of  recent  bilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements, \nselected for their particular emphasis of paperless trade issues and involving leading \neconomies in South, South-East and East Asia and the Pacific (see Table 3). The WTO \nTFA and the TPP are also included in the comparative analysis for reference. \nTable 3: Status and Membership of Selected RTAs in Asia and the Pacific \nYear of Entry \nAgreement Name/Abbreviation  into Force  Membership \nSingapore-India Comprehensive Economic  2005  Singapore, India \nCooperation Agreement/SING-IND \nAustralia-Chile Free Trade Agreement/AUS-CHI  2009  Australia, Chile \nJapan-Switzerland Economic Partnership  2009  Japan, Switzerland \nAgreement/JAP-SWI \nIntra-ASEAN Agreements (including The ASEAN  2010 (ASW since  Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nTrade in Goods Agreement, The ASEAN  2005; ATIGA  Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nAgreement on Customs, Single Window  since 2010)  Myanmar, Philippines, \nAgreement)/ASEAN (ATIGA, AAC and SWA)   Thailand, Viet Nam, Singapore \nASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade  2010   ASEAN members, Australia, \nAgreement/AANZFTA  New Zealand \nThe United States- Rep. of Korea Free Trade  2012  The United States,  \nAgreement/US-KOR  Rep. of Korea \nRep. of Korea-Viet Nam Free Trade  2015  Rep. of Korea, Viet Nam \nAgreement/KOR-VN \nTrans-pacific Partnership/TPP  Not yet in force  The United States, Australia, \n(signed by all TPP  Brunei Darussalam, Chile, \nmembers in 2015)  Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, \nSingapore, and Viet Nam \nSource: Authors. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \n4.1  \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Articles \nAs noted earlier, paperless trade measures are found in different chapters of an RTA, \noften  as  part  of  other  substantive  Articles  or  provisions.  However,  most  recent  \nRTAs also include one specific Article titled \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d or \u201cPaperless Trade \nAdministration\u201d. Before looking in more detail at the paperless trade coverage of our \nselected sample of RTAs in Asia and the Pacific, it is useful to review such Articles. \nTable 4 shows the actual text of these Articles in the RTAs under review. All RTAs in \nour sample, with the exception of the intra-ASEAN agreements, include at least one \narticle titled as such. These articles are generally found in e-commerce chapters, but \nnot always. For example, the SING-IND places its \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Article in the \nCustoms Administration chapter, while the AUS-CHI Agreement features such Article in \nboth the chapters of Customs Administration and Electronic Commerce. Regardless  \nof  the  RTA  considered,  these  Articles  consistently  promote  the  development  and \nimplementation of paperless trade systems among member states. However, details of \ncommitments differ somewhat in substance and level of binding. \nTable 4: List of Paperless Trading Provisions Containing a Binding Framework \nText of Provisions Entitled \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d   Commitment \nRTAs  or \u201cPaperless Trade Administration\u201d  Level \nAANZ  Art. 8 (1) \u201cEach Party shall, where possible, work towards the implementation  Non-binding \nof initiatives which provide for the use of paperless trading.   \nArt. 8(2) \u201cThe Parties shall co-operate in international fora to enhance  Binding \nacceptance of electronic versions of trade administration documents.\u201d   \nArt. 8(3) \u201cThe Parties shall exchange views and information on realizing,  Binding \npromoting and developments in paperless trading.\u201d   \nArt. 8(4) \u201cEach Party shall endeavour to make electronic versions of its trade  Non-binding \nadministration documents publicly available.\u201d \nJAP- Art. 79 \u201c1.

The two most commonly found provisions in the Articles are that parties will \nendeavor  to  (1)  make  electronic  versions  of  their  trade  administration  documents \navailable publicly, and (2) accept trade documents submitted electronically as the legal \nequivalent of their paper version. Another provision often found is that they will (3) \nexchange views and/or cooperate with each other as well as internationally to enhance \nthe acceptance of electronic documents. Interestingly, such cooperation provisions are \noften formulated as binding commitments. KOR-VN and AANZ also specifically commit \n\u201cto  work  towards  the  implementation  of  initiatives  which  provide  for  the  use  of \npaperless trading\u201d, which may be interpreted as commitment to implement joint pilot \nprojects in paperless trade. \nAUS-CHI is the only agreement where the development of a single window for trade \ndocuments is specifically included under a \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Article. One of the two \nsuch Articles featured in AUS-CHI also specifically refer to engaging in paperless \ntrading taking into account the \u201cmethods agreed by the World Customs Organization, \nincluding adoption of the World Customs Organization data model for the simplification \nand harmonisation of data\u201d. \n4.2  Paperless Trade Measures and Commitments \nOn the basis of the typology of paperless trade measures developed earlier, Table 5 \nprovides an overview of the paperless trade coverage of each of the 8 selected RTAs, \nincluding in terms of the level of commitment and details attached to each of the \npaperless trade measures featured. The table shows that paperless trade measures \nvary  significantly  across  RTAs,  both  in  substance  and  nature.  However,  with  the \nexception of the India-Singapore agreement, which entered into force over a decade \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nago (2005), all other RTAs included in the table have deeper coverage of paperless \ntrade than the WTO TFA. The Australia-Chile (2009) agreement appears to have been \nparticularly pioneering for its time and still features some of the most binding and \ndetailed paperless trade measures found in any RTAs, including the TPP. \nTable 5: Paperless Trade Coverage in Selected Agreements in Asia and the \nPacific \nAgreement:  SING-  AUS-  JAP- Intra  AANZ  KOR-  KOR-  WTO \nPaperless Trade Measures  IND  CHI  SWI  ASEAN  FTA  US  VN  TPP  TFA \nYear of Entry into Force:  2005  2009  2009  2010  2010  2012  2015  \u2013  \u2013 \nAcceptance of electronic copies  *  **  **  **  ***  **  **  **  * \nE-submission of trade-related            *  *  *  * \ndocuments \nE-Submission of Air Cargo            *  *  *   \nManifests \nE-system of Export or Import                   \nPermits \nE-system for SPS certification                *   \nE-system of COO            *    *   \nElectronic record-keeping  *  ***      *  *    *   \nE-payment system                ***  * \nElectronic/Automated Customs    *    *  **  ***  **  ***   \nSystem/Customs Automation \nAutomated System for Risk          **  ***  ***  ***   \nManagement and targeting \nElectronic Single Window System    ***    ***        **  * \nE-system for inter-organization  *      *           \ncommunication \nLaws for electronic transactions  *  ***  **    **    **  ***   \nPromoting e-certification and     *  *  *  *  *  *  *   \ne-signatures \nMutual determination of    ***      *  *  *  *   \nauthentication technologies \nProving in court legal compliance of    *  *    *  *  *  *   \nE-authentication \nMeeting standards for E-signature      **      **    *   \nand E-authentication \nMutual recognition of digital    ***  **    **    **  *   \ncertificates and E-signature \nInteroperability of digital certificates    *      *    *     \nused by business \nTrade-related electronic data  *      ***i    **  **  ***   \nexchange \nE-exchange of COO related        *i           \ninformation \nE-exchange of SPS related        *i        *   \ninformation \nE-exchange of TBT related    **    *i    **  *  **   \ninformation \nE-transmission of financial      *    *  **    *   \ninformation \nInternational standards for    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * \npaperless trade \nTotal number of paperless trade  5  12  8  10  12  15  14  21  5 \nmeasures: \nNotes: 1 star (*) indicates the measure is only mentioned, generally as an option, without further clarification; 2 stars  \n(**) indicate the measure is encouraged (e.g., Shall endeavour to; or Shall, to the extent possible, to) with clarification on \nhow it is to be provided/implemented (e.g. complying with relevant international standards); 3 stars (***) indicate that \nimplementation of the measures is required and binding (e.g., shall) with details included on how to do so. i indicates \nthat commitment to these measures is implied by the existence of the regional ASEAN Single Window Agreement itself. \nSource: Authors. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \na.  Measures Related to Acceptance of Electronic Copies \nAs  noted  earlier,  this  type  of  measure  is  commonly  found  in  RTA  articles  titled \n\u201cPaperless Trading\u201d (see table 4). Referring to table 5, all eight RTAs examined have \none  or  more  dedicated  provisions  encouraging  development  and  acceptance  of \nelectronic  versions  of  trade  administration  documents.  In  contrast,  the  WTO  TFA \nincludes  a  specific  provision  on  Acceptance  of  Copies  (Art.  10.2),  with  all  parties \nexpected to \u201c, where appropriate, endeavor to accept paper or electronic copies of \nsupporting documents required for import, export or transit formalities.\u201d  \nGoing beyond simple encouragements, the ASEAN Single Window Agreement and its \nProtocol on the Legal Framework to Implement the ASEAN Single Window do provide \nfor a framework for acceptance and legal recognition of electronic documents among \nMember States. Such framework is indeed more elaborate and binding than those \nfound in provisions of the other RTAs. In particular, Article 15 (Legal Effect of Electronic \nDocuments, Data, and Information) of the Protocol indicate that \u201cEach Member State \nshall adopt procedures for authentication of NSW electronic documents, data, and \ninformation that shall be used or processed within the NSW and transmitted in an \nelectronic form in the ASW environment.\u201d and that \u201cSubject to national laws, rules and \nregulations of each Member State, authenticated electronic documents produced in \nconnection with transactions under this Protocol may be admissible as evidence of any \nfact stated therein.\u201d \nb.  Measures Related to E-submission of Trade-related Documents \nSuch measures are typically found in the articles on \u201cRelease of Goods\u201d and \u201cExpress \nShipment\u201d under chapters titled \u201cCustoms Administration and Trade Facilitation\u201d or \n\u201cCustoms Procedures\u201d. Two of the eight RTAs include non-binding commitments to \nelectronic submission of trade-related documents.  \nElectronic  submission  is  urged  in  KOR-US  and  TPP,  and  is  encouraged  in WTO  \nTFA. For example, KOR-US Article 7.2 requires members to \u201cprovide for customs \ninformation to be submitted and processed electronically before the goods arrive in \norder for them to be released on their arrival\u201d. In WTO TFA, the country\u2019s situation and \ncapacity is considered through the words \u201cas appropriate\u201d when encouraging states to \n\u201cprovide for advance lodging of documents in electronic formats\u201d. \nElectronic submission of (air cargo) manifest is specifically promoted in several of the \nagreements. For instance, in the article on \u201cExpress Shipment\u201d in TPP, parties shall \n\u201callow a single submission of information covering all goods contained in an express \nshipment, such as a manifest, through, if possible, electronic means\u201d. \nc.  Measures Related to E-system for SPS Certification \nSuch  measures  are  usually  found  in  RTA  chapters  dedicated  to  \u201cSanitary  and \nPhytosanitary Measures\u201d, when they exist. Only one of the eight RTAs specifically \nrefers to the potential goal of developing an electronic system for SPS certification.  \nTPP  indicates  that  \u201cthe  Parties  shall  promote  the  implementation  of  electronic \ncertification and other technologies to facilitate trade\u201d in its Article 7.12 on Certification. \nd.  Measures Related to E-system for Certificates of Origin (COO) \nPaperless trade measures related to COO are usually found in chapters on \u201cRules of \nOrigin and Origin Procedures\u201d. Development of electronic systems for COO is implied \nin two of the agreements.  \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nSpecifically, KOR-US provides for electronic certification as one option. Specifically,  \nan importer under KOR-US can claim preferential tariff treatment based on \u201ceither  \na written or electronic certification by the importer, exporter, or producer\u201d. In TPP, a \nCommittee on Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures will be established and \u201cconsult \non the technical aspects of submission and the format of the electronic certification  \nof origin\u201d. \ne.  Measures Related to Electronic Record-keeping \nThis type of measure is usually found in the Article on \u201cRecords\u201d or \u201cRecord Keeping \nRequirements\u201d  under  the  chapter  of  \u201cRules  of  Origin  and  Origin  Procedures\u201d,  as \ndocuments subject to electronic record-keeping requirements in RTAs are related to \nCOO issues in most cases. Five of the RTAs provide for electronic-record keeping,  \nbut  only  three  have  specific  provisions  related  to  this  measure  in  their  Rules  of  \nOrigin chapters. \nIn  AUS-CHI,  the  members  are  obliged  to  keep  electronic  records  (Article  4.20). \nHowever,  in  KOR-US  (Article  6.17  on  \u201cRecord  Keeping  Requirements\u201d)  and  TPP \n(Article  3.26),  e-record  keeping  is  only  one  of  several  options:  \u201cany  medium  that  \nallows for prompt retrieval, including electronic, optical, magnetic or written form in \naccordance with that Party\u2019s law\u201d could be chosen by members. WTO TFA does not \ninclude any mention of electronic record-keeping. \nf.  Measures Related to E-payment System \nThis type of measure is not generally featured in RTAs. While the WTO TFA Article 7.2 \nhas  a  separate  provision  on  electronic  payment  indicating  that,  \u201cto  the  extent \npracticable\u201d,  members  shall  \u201cadopt  or  maintain  procedures  allowing  the  option  of \nelectronic payment for duties, taxes, fees, and charges collected by customs incurred \nupon  importation  and  exportation\u201d,  such  specific  measure  related  to  payment  to \ncustoms is absent from any of the eight RTAs reviewed. \nHowever, electronic payment is provided for in a very detailed way in TPP in the \nChapter on \u201cFinancial Services\u201d \u2013 with no particular focus on BtoG transactions. TPP \nmember states are committed to providing the supply of electronic payment services \nfor payment card transactions among members. It not only conditions the cross-border \nsupply of this electronic payment service, but also sets clear limits to the supply scope, \nwith  the  exclusion  of the transfer  of funds to  and from  transactors\u2019 accounts,  the \nexclusive use of proprietary networks to process, and on business to business basis. In \naddition, the section also provides for public policy exception to the supply of such \nelectronic payment. \ng.  Measures Related to Electronic/Automated Customs System \nThe  measures  \u201celectronic/automated  customs  system\u201d  and  \u201cautomated  system  for  \nrisk management and targeting\u201d are often found in the article of \u201cAutomation\u201d under  \nthe  chapter  of  \u201cCustoms  Procedures\u201d.  The  majority  of  the  agreements  reviewed  \n(6 of 8 RTAs) encourages establishing or developing electronic/automated customs \nsystems, while 4 provide specifically for risk management.  \nAs can be seen in Box 1, making electronic systems accessible to customs users is a \nbinding commitment in both KOR-VN (Article 4.3) and KOR-US (Article 7.3), as well as \nin TPP (Article 5.6). In contrast, the related provision in AUS-CHI (Article 5.11), which \nis included in an Article on \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d has greater scope but is of a \u201cbest \nendeavour\u201d nature. It also has the particularity to stress the importance of consulting \nwith stakeholders in developing the electronic systems, including businesses. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nWith regard to Automated System for Risk Management and targeting, it is made  \na requirement in the two KOR agreements as well as the TPP. However, the TPP \nlanguage  is  more  concise  and  the  measure  is  included  as  part  of  the  Article  on \n\u201cAutomation\u201d (Article 5.6), which also covers the setting up of a single window. \nBox 1: Selected Articles Relating to E-Customs System/Customs Automation \nKOR-US  \nArticle 7.3: Automation \nEach Party shall use information technology that expedites procedures for the release of \ngoods and shall:  \n(a)  make electronic systems accessible to customs users;  \n(b)  endeavour to use international standards;  \n(c)  endeavour to develop electronic systems that are compatible with the other Party\u2019s \nsystems, in order to facilitate bilateral exchange of international trade data; and \u2028 \n(d)  endeavour to develop a set of common data elements and processes in accordance  \nwith World Customs Organization (WCO) Customs Data Model and related WCO \nrecommendations and guidelines.  \n \nArticle 7.4: Risk Management \nEach Party shall adopt or maintain electronic or automated risk management systems for \nassessment and targeting that enable its customs authority to focus its inspection activities \non high-risk goods and that simplify the clearance and movement of low-risk goods. \n \nTPP \nArticle 5.6: Automation \n1.  Each Party shall: \n(a)  endeavour to use international standards with respect to procedures for the release  \nof goods; \n(b)  make electronic systems accessible to customs users; \n(c)  employ electronic or automated systems for risk analysis and targeting; \n(d)  endeavour to implement common standards and elements for import and export data \nin accordance with the World Customs Organization (WCO) Data Model; \n(e)  take into account, as appropriate, WCO standards, recommendations, models and \nmethods developed through the WCO or APEC; and \n(f)  work toward developing a set of common data elements that are drawn from the WCO \nData Model and related WCO recommendations as well as guidelines to facilitate \ngovernment to government electronic sharing of data for purposes of analyzing  \ntrade flows. \n2.  Each Party shall endeavour to provide a facility that allows importers and exporters to \nelectronically complete standardised import and export requirements at a single entry \npoint. \n \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nh.  Measures Related to Electronic Single window \nMeasures  on  single  window  are  most  commonly  found  in  chapters  dedicated  to \ncustoms procedures and trade facilitation, although at least one RTA mentions such \nmeasures in its e-commerce chapter. Three of the eight RTAs refer to the need to \nestablish single window facilities. \nAUS-CHI  mentions  the  establishment  of  single  window  in  Article  16.9  (\u201cPaperless \nTrading\u201d) under the chapter of Electronic Commerce. In TPP, the term \u201csingle window\u201d \nis not used but the need to develop such facility is specified in the last provision of the \nArticle on \u201cAutomation\u201d (Art. 5.6) of the Customs and trade facilitation chapter: \u201cEach \nParty  shall  endeavour  to  provide  a  facility  that  allows  importers  and  exporters  to \nelectronically complete standardised import and export requirements at a single entry \npoint.\u201d In contrast, the WTO TFA features a dedicated \u201cSingle Window\u201d Article, with \nMembers  expected  to  endeavour  to  maintain  such  facility  and  use  information \ntechnology to support it \u201cto the extent possible and practicable\u201d. \nAmong all RTAs, intra-ASEAN agreements have a special emphasis on electronic \nsingle  window.  Article  49  of  the  ATIGA  indeed  binds  ASEAN  members  to  take \nmeasures to establish not only a national but a regional single window, with specific \nimplementation  agreements  and  protocols  providing  details  of  what  is  to  be  done  \n(see Box 2). \nBox 2: Selected Articles Relating to Single Window \nASEAN Trade in Good Agreement \nArticle 49: Establishment of the ASEAN Single Window \nMember States shall undertake necessary measures to establish and operate their \nrespective National Single Windows and the ASEAN Single Window in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Agreement to Establish and Implement the ASEAN Single Window and the \nProtocol to Establish and Implement the ASEAN Single Window. \n \nWTO TFA \nArticle 10.4: Single Window \n4.1 Members shall endeavour to establish or maintain a single window, enabling traders to \nsubmit documentation and/or data requirements for importation, exportation, or transit of \ngoods through a single entry point to the participating authorities or agencies. After the \nexamination by the participating authorities or agencies of the documentation and/or data, \nthe results shall be notified to the applicants through the single window in a timely manner.  \n[..] \n \n4.4 Members shall, to the extent possible and practicable, use information technology to \nsupport the single window. \ni.  Measures Related to Laws for Electronic Transactions \nProvisions related to establishment of laws for electronic transactions are consistently \nfound in Electronic Commerce chapters of RTAs, typically under a specific Article \nfocusing on domestic regulations. Six of the RTAs reviewed include such provisions, \nalthough they differ in substance. \n \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nAs can be seen in Box 3, the JAP-SWI agreement (Article 77 on Domestic Regulation) \nprovides for the most general provision, only calling for transparent administration of  \ne-commerce and the need for regulations not be burdensome, on a best endeavour \nbasis. Other RTAs are more specific and both KOR-VN and TPP provisions refer \nspecifically to UNCITRAL instruments.  \nBox 3: Selected Articles Relating to Laws for Electronic Transactions \nJAP-SWI  \nArticle 77: Domestic Regulation \nEach Party shall endeavour to ensure that all its measures affecting electronic commerce \nare administered in a transparent, objective, reasonable and impartial manner, and are not \nmore burdensome than necessary.  \n \nKOR-VN  \nArticle 10.4: Domestic Regulatory Framework \nEach Party shall endeavour to adopt or maintain its domestic laws and regulations governing \nelectronic transactions taking into account the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic \nCommerce 1996.  \n \nAUS-CHI  \nArticle 16.5: Domestic Electronic Transaction Frameworks \n1.  Each Party shall adopt or maintain measures regulating electronic transactions based on \nthe following principles:  \n(a)  a transaction including a contract shall not be denied legal effect, validity or \nenforceability solely on the grounds that it is in the form of an electronic \ncommunication; and  \n(b)  laws should not discriminate arbitrarily between different forms of technology. \n2.  Nothing in paragraph 1 prevents the Parties from making exceptions in their domestic \nlaws to the general principles outlined in that paragraph.  \n3.  Each Party shall:  \n(a)  minimize the regulatory burden on electronic commerce; and  \n(b)  ensure that its measures regulating electronic commerce support industry-led \ndevelopment of electronic commerce. \n \nTPP  \nArticle 14.5: Domestic Electronic Transactions Framework \n1.  Each Party shall maintain a legal framework governing electronic transactions consistent \nwith the principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 or the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International \nContracts, done at New York, November 23, 2005. \n2.  Each Party shall endeavour to:  \n(a)  avoid any unnecessary regulatory burden on electronic transactions; and  \n(b)  facilitate input by interested persons in the development of its legal framework for \nelectronic transactions. \nWhile the KOR-VN only encourages parties to take such instruments into account, the \nTPP requires that member states\u2019 domestic regulations regarding electronic transaction \n\u201cshall be consistent with\u201d the principles of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nCommerce 1996 or the United Nations Electronic Communications Convention, 2005. \nA similar reference to the e-CC is contained in the ASEAN Legal Protocol to the Single \nWindow. The provisions regarding laws on electronic transactions in AUS-CHI are also \nstated in a more detailed way, setting various principles to be followed by parties in \ndeveloping legislation in this area. The special emphasis on supporting \u201cindustry-led \ndevelopment of electronic commerce\u201d is worth noting in this regard. \nj.  Measures Related to Promoting E-certification and E-signature \nThese measures are typically found in the articles titled \u201cElectronic Authentication\u201d \nand/or \u201cElectronic Signature\u201d19 under the chapter of Electronic Commerce. All eight \nRTAs reviewed feature some more or less specific provisions in this area. \nSING-IND  does  not  feature  detailed  provisions  on  electronic  authentication  and \nelectronic signature, nor does the WTO TFA. In contrast, other RTAs generally seek to \npromote  acceptance  and  mutual  recognition  of  electronic  authentication  and \nsignatures, including by encouraging the parties to maintain flexible and technology \nneutral  laws  and  regulations  in  this  area.  In  KOR-US  and  TPP,  this  is  done  by \nspecifying  what type  of  legislation  parties  should  not  adopt,  e.g.,  laws  that  would \n\u201cprohibit parties to an electronic transaction from mutually determining the appropriate \nauthentication methods for that transaction\u201d (TPP Article 14.6) or \u201cdeny a signature \nlegal validity solely on the basis that the signature is in electronic form\u201d (KOR-US \nArticle 15.4). \nKOR-VN and AUS-CHI agreements take a more \u201cpositive\u201d approach with the relevant \nArticles instead indicating that \u201cshall adopt or maintain measures regulating electronic \nauthentication\u201d  (AUS-CHI  Article  16.6)  that  would,  for  example,  permit  parties  to \nmutually  determine  the  appropriate  authentication  methods  and  \u201cnot  limit  the \nrecognition of authentication technologies or implementation models\u201d (KOR-VN Article \n10.3).20 Both agreements also commit parties to work towards the mutual recognition of \ndigital certificates and electronic signature at the governmental level, and based on \ninternational standards, suggesting a higher level of overall commitment that in many \nother RTAs. Interoperability of electronic authentication and/or digital certificates is also \nencouraged in both the agreements, as well as in the TPP. \nk.  Measures Related to Trade-related Electronic Data Exchange \n\u201cTrade-related electronic data exchange\u201d among parties, or cross-border paperless \ntrade, is often promoted under the Articles of \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d in E-commerce \nchapters or \u201cAutomation\u201d in Customs chapters. Five of the RTAs reviewed include \nrelated provisions. \nCommitments in this area are typically on a best endeavour basis, with the notable \nexception of ASEAN, which features binding and detailed commitments on electronic \nexchange  of  data  among  members  under  its  ASEAN  Single  Window  (ASW) \nAgreement. \nAmong the other agreements reviewed, KOR-US, KOR-VN and TPP stand out in terms \nof making reference to specific international standards \u201cto facilitate bilateral exchange \nof  international  trade  data\u201d  (KOR-US  Article  7.3).  For  example,  in  Article  5.6  on \n                                                \n19  Articles on e-transaction laws which reference UNCITRAL instruments also indirectly cover these \nissues. In many cases, the RTA Articles on \u201ce-signature\u201d simply restate key underlying principles of \nUNCITRAL texts. \n20  This provision reflects the principle of \u201ctechnology neutrality\u201d featured in UNCITRAL text as well as the \nnew FA-PT text. \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nAutomation, TPP Parties are committed to \u201cwork toward developing a set of common \ndata  elements  that  are  drawn  from  the  WCO  Data  Model  and  related  WCO \nrecommendations  as  well  as  guidelines  to  facilitate  government  to  government \nelectronic sharing of data for purposes of analysing trade flows\u201d. While JAP-SWI, AUS-\nCHI and AANZ may not feature direct provisions on exchanging trade-related data \nelectronically, an implicit commitment to it is made in \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Articles, \nwhich all include a provision that \u201cParties shall cooperate bilaterally [\u2026] to enhance the \nacceptance of electronic versions of trade administration documents.\u201d \nWith regard to the four sub-measures, they are often specified under the specific \nchapters  of  \u201cRules  of  Origin  and  Origin  Procedures\u201d,  \u201cSanitary  and  Phytosanitary \nMeasures\u201d, \u201cBarriers to Trade\u201d and \u201cFinancial Service\u201d respectively. TPP is the only \nAgreement which has a specific commitment to exchange of information on SPS issues \nby electronic means, although it is limited to \u201cpossible\u201d cases. In contrast, electronic \nexchange of TBT-related information is discussed in several agreements, although \nagain on a \u201cbest endeavour\u201d basis. \nAmong the RTAs reviewed in details, four agreements (US-KOR, JAP-SWI, AANZ and \nTPP) cover the electronic exchange of financial information. JAP-SWI uses \u201cnegative\u201d \nlanguage and states that: \u201cNeither party shall take measures that prevent transfers of \ninformation into or out of its Area or the processing of financial information, including \ntransfers of data by electronic means\u201d where such transfers [...] are necessary for the \nconduct of the ordinary business of a financial supplier of the other party\u201d. In the \nchapter of financial services, the TPP urges members to allow electronic exchange of \nfinancial  information,  with  an  exception  for  protecting  personal  information  and  a \nrequirement of obtaining prior authorization. \nl.  Measures Related to International Standards for Paperless Trade \nMeasures related to the use of international standards for paperless trade are normally \nfound either in Articles on \u201cAutomation\u201d in Customs chapters, or in \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d \nArticles in e-commerce chapters. All but one of the RTAs reviewed, as well as the WTO \nTFA,  refer  to  and/or  take  into  account  international  standards  when  implementing \nvarious paperless trade measures. \nFor  example,  parties  in  TPP  and  KOR-VN  shall  \u201cendeavour  to  use  international \nstandards\u201d  when  automating  customs  systems.  The  \u201cPaperless  Trading\u201d  Article  in \nAUS-CHI  refers to  the need  to  establish  single  window  by  \u201cincorporating  relevant \ninternationals standards\u201d. The ASEAN ATIGA Article 58 on \u201cApplication of Information \nTechnology\u201d also states that \u201cMember States, where applicable, shall apply information \ntechnology  in  customs  operations  based  on  internationally  accepted  standards  for \nexpeditious customs clearance and release of goods.\u201d \nAs  noted  earlier,  some  paperless  trade  provisions  go  a  step  further  and  mention \nspecific  standards  or  conventions  and  recommendations  to  guide  implementation  \n\u2013 in particular in the TPP. In contrast, while the WTO TFA has a dedicated Article on \n\u2018Use of International Standards\u2019 (Article 10.3) in regulating formalities of importation, \nexportation,  and  transit,  it  is  not  specifically  related  to  application  of  information \ntechnology and does not specify a set of standards or recommendations. It does, \nhowever,  encourage  parties  to  use  and  prepare  and  review  periodically  relevant \ninternational  standards  and  establish  a  committee  which  works  towards  the \nimplementation of international standards. \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \n4.3  Linkages with the Framework Agreement on Facilitation  \nof Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific \nThe \u201cFramework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia \nand the Pacific\u201d (FA-PT) opened for signature on 1 October 2016, as the newest UN \ntreaty in the area of trade and development.21 The FA-PT is not a regional trade \nagreement  in  the  common  sense  of  the  term,  as  it  does  not  include  any  trade \nliberalization commitments and focuses solely on enabling cross-border trade-related \nelectronic data exchange among parties. It has been described as a regional \u201cdigital \ncomplement\u201d to the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.22 Developed and negotiated  \nby ESCAP Member States following adoption of a resolution on Enabling Paperless \nTrade [\u2026] for inclusive and sustainable intraregional trade facilitation in 2012, it can  \nbe  expected  to  provide  a  supportive  and  dedicated  framework  to  accelerate  the \nharmonized  implementation  of  paperless  trade  commitments  made  by  ESCAP \nMembers with each other through RTAs. \nBox 4: Objective of the Framework Agreement on Facilitation  \nof Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific \nArticle 1 Objective  \nThe objective of the present Framework Agreement is to promote cross-border paperless \ntrade by enabling the exchange and mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents \nin electronic form and facilitating interoperability among national and subregional single \nwindows and/or other paperless trade systems, for the purpose of making international trade \ntransactions more efficient and transparent while improving regulatory compliance. \nA review of the provisions of the FA-PT against the paperless trade measures and \nprovisions in the selected RTAs confirms indeed that the FA-PT guiding principles are \nnot only consistent with those found in RTA, but that participation in the FA-PT could \nindeed help countries fulfil or better implement several of their RTA commitments. For \nexample, as noted earlier, a common provision in \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d Articles in RTAs \nis  that  parties  will  exchange  views  and/or  cooperate  with  each  other  as  well  as \ninternationally to enhance the acceptance of electronic documents; Participation in the \nFA-PT would readily meet RTA partners\u2019 commitment to cooperate internationally on \npaperless trade. In particular, one of the most far reaching components of the FA-PT is \nArticle 8 on \u201cCross-border mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents in \nelectronic form.\u201d Implementation of this provision is expected to potentially enable the \nelectronic exchange and legal recognition of various trade-related data and documents \nsuch  as  electronic  COO,  SPS  certificates  and  TBT  certificates,  as  envisaged  in  \nvarious RTAs. \nSome RTAs (e.g., KOR-VN and AANZ) also commit parties to \u201cwork towards the \nimplementation of initiatives which provide for the use of paperless trading\u201d. FA-PT \nArticle  13  on  \u201cPilot  projects  and  sharing  of  lessons  learned\u201d,  where  \u201cThe  Parties  \nshall  endeavour  to  initiate  and  launch  pilot  projects  on  cross-border  exchange  of  \n                                                \n21  Any of the 53 Member States of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific (ESCAP) may become a party.

Such  an \napproach is also consistent with that of the FA-PT Article 9 on \u201cInternational Standards \nfor exchange of trade-related data and documents in electronic form\u201d, stating that \nParties \u201cshall endeavour to apply international standards and guidelines in order to \nensure interoperability in paperless trade and to develop safe, secure and reliable \nmeans of communication for the exchange of data\u201d, as well as \u201cendeavour to become \ninvolved  in  the  development  of  international  standards  and  best  practices  related  \nto cross-border paperless trade.\u201d The first four \u201cGeneral Principles\u201d (Article 5) of the  \nFA-PT \u2013 (a) Functional equivalence; (b) Non-discrimination of the use of electronic \ncommunications; (c) Technological neutrality; (d) Promotion of interoperability \u2013 are in \nparticular directly related to those established and promoted in UNCITRAL instruments \nreferred to in several RTA provisions related to legislation on electronic transaction \nand/or e-signatures. \nBuilding on these intentional standards and principles, the FA-PT provides more details \non how some of the paperless trade provisions in RTAs may be implemented. For \nexample, on single window, the FA-PT does not only encourage Parties to establish \nsingle windows, as the WTO TFA and several RTAs already do, but encourage them  \nto \u201cuse them for cross-border paperless trade\u201d. It also provides an intergovernmental \nand institutional framework to do so, with establishment of a Paperless Trade Council \nand working groups, and the development of individual and regional action plans. \nLooking forward, Parties may reflect relevant commitments made through RTAs in \nthese action plans. \n5.  CONCLUSION \nThe  analysis  presented  in  this  paper  reveals  that  the  number  of  paperless  trade \nmeasures in RTAs entered into force globally since 2005 essentially doubled, with  \na  large  majority  of  RTAs  now  featuring  one  more  measures  aiming  to  exchange  \ntrade-related  data  and  information  electronically. In  many  cases,  recent  RTAs  are \nfound  to  go  further  than  the  WTO  TFA  in  promoting  digital  trade  facilitation  and  \nthe  application  of  modern  information  and  communication  technologies  to  trade \nprocedures \u2013 with the possible exception of e-payment of duties and fees, which is not \nspecifically  mentioned  in  any  of  the  RTAs  reviewed.  While  30  of  the  138  RTAs \nreviewed feature one or more Articles dedicated to \u201cPaperless Trading\u201d or \u201cPaperless \nTrade Administration\u201d, provisions related to more specific paperless trade measures \nare found in different chapters, including but not limited to chapters on Customs and \ntrade facilitation as well as on e-commerce. \n   \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nMany of the recent RTAs in Asia and the Pacific implicitly or explicitly call upon the \nparties to develop electronic exchange of trade-related data and documents and work \ntowards interoperability of paperless trade systems. However, they provide little detail \non how to do so beyond recommending cooperation among the Parties taking into \naccount existing international standards and tools. In this context, the new UN treaty on \nfacilitation of cross-border paperless trade in Asia and the Pacific (FA-PT) provides a \nuseful multilateral framework through which paperless trade-related RTA commitments \nmay be concretized. \nLooking forward, more research may be undertaken on the extent to which countries \nhave  implemented  the  various  paperless  trade  measures  they  have  committed  to \nthrough  RTAs.  Preliminary  evidence  points  to  countries  having  achieved  partial \nimplementation at best. Even in the case of ASEAN, which has shown strong (binding) \ncommitments to cross-border paperless trade through ATIGA and its related ASEAN \nSingle Window Agreement, implementation has been much slower than expected. In \nthis context, the new FA-PT stands as a potentially useful tool for RTA members  \nto  share  experience  and  cooperate  with  a  wider  set  of  trade  partners  committed  \nto  paperless  trade,  providing  new  knowledge  and  renewed  impetus  to  accelerate \nimplementation of RTA commitments. \nFurther efforts may also be useful in refining the typology of paperless trade measures \nand provisions proposed in this paper. Similarly, more work may be needed to improve \nthe accuracy of the RTA ratings in terms of depth of coverage and commitments to \npaperless trade, in particular by more fully taking into account the nature and level of \nbindings of each provision across a larger set of agreements.  \n   \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 747  Duval and Mengjing \n \nREFERENCES \nECSG Chair. 2004. \u201cAPEC's Strategies and Actions Toward A Cross-Border Paperless \nTrading Environment\u201d.

It is becoming essential to maintaining trade competitiveness and enabling effective participation in cross-border e-commerce.  We examine the extent to which measures aimed at dematerializing trade data and documents and enabling their electronic exchange, commonly referred to as paperless trade measures, are included in regional trade agreements (RTAs), including in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and ASEAN agreements. Such measures are most commonly found in RTA chapters on e-commerce or in those dedicated to customs and trade facilitation. Their number has doubled in RTAs between 2005\u20132008 and 2013\u20132016 at the global level. Most recent RTAs also contain more and deeper paperless trade provisions than those featured in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.  A more detailed analysis of paperless trade measures included in selected Asia-Pacific RTAs confirms that the coverage of RTAs of paperless trade issues has become extensive, covering increasingly specific areas such as electronic certificates of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary certificates. In that context, the new Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific will be a useful tool for the harmonized implementation of many of these provisions.", "Title": "Digital Trade Facilitation: Paperless Trade in Regional Trade Agreements"}}
