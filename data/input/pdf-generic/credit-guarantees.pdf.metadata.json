These reforms have \nunlocked the value in \u201cmovable\u201d assets such as machinery, inventory, and accounts receivable for use as \ncollateral in borrowing. They have the potential to benefit businesses and financial institutions that offer \nbusiness loans.\n\nYet, despite these reforms, financial institutions remain unwilling to lend. Businesses still find it hard to access \nthe credit they need to grow, which in turn creates jobs and drives the economic activity so desperately \nneeded in the Pacific. Credit guarantees are often proposed as an instrument to overcome this problem. \nHowever, as this publication demonstrates, there is no strong theoretical justification for their use.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to half of the world\u2019s extreme poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nCREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE  \nIN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\fCREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN \nIMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n\n\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n\nSome rights reserved.

Its expert team provides support services in policy and program development, advocacy, \nlegislative and administrative reform, and capacity building.\n\nAll PSDI publications can be downloaded from www.adbpsdi.org.\n\nThis paper draws on the background research by Saumya Mitra. PSDI thanks Erik Aelbers for \npreparing Appendix 2: Credit Guarantee Schemes in the Pacific, and Melissa Dayrit and Amanda \nLucas-Frith for helpful comments and editorial support.\n\n\f\f1\n\n1.\u2002iNTrODUCTiON\n\nBanking sectors across Pacific island countries have \nnot yet reached the point where they effectively \nintermediate between savers and borrowers. \nDespite adequate liquidity, commercial banks are \noften reluctant to extend business credit, which \nis a serious constraint to business operations and \nbroader economic development. In quantitative \nterms, the ratio of private sector credit to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in Pacific countries is less \nthan 50%,1 with the exception of Fiji and Vanuatu. \nIn faster growing and more developed economies, \nthis ratio typically approaches or exceeds 100% \n(Appendix\u00a01).\n\nSECURED TRANSACTIONS: \nSOLVING THE PROBLEM OF \nCOLLATERAL\n\nThe difficulty in using real assets as collateral has \nundoubtedly been a major factor affecting banks\u2019 \nwillingness to lend, but this excess liquidity has \nremained pervasive despite widespread secured \ntransactions reform across Pacific countries over \nthe last decade.2 Secured transactions reforms3 \naddress the problems with collateral: the new \nsecured transactions laws allow security interests to \nbe created in various forms of moveable property, \nsuch as equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, \ncrops, livestock, and shares. This enables businesses \n\nto pledge moveable assets, making it easier for \nbanks to take on additional forms of collateral as an \nalternative to real property and reducing the risks of \nlosses in the event of default. \n\nCredit guarantees are often promoted as an \ninstrument to overcome the lack of lending. Credit \nguarantee schemes have existed for over two \ncenturies, having emerged first in Europe. Today, \nthey are widely prevalent in both the developed \nand developing worlds.3 Credit guarantee schemes \ncan take several forms, with the main variants being \nguarantees of individual loans and guarantees of a \nportfolio of loans. Within these variants, there are \nmany alternatives for allocating risk, ranging from \na 100% guarantee of a loan or portfolio, to a lesser \nproportion, depending on the types of loans, risks, \nand maturities. \n\nSeveral credit guarantee schemes already exist in \nthe Pacific (Appendix 2), and proponents advocate \nfor the introduction of schemes, where they \ncurrently do not exist. This paper aims to increase \nawareness of the policy issues surrounding credit \nguarantees. In so doing, it challenges the arguments \nfor using guarantees and, furthermore, argues that \ncredit guarantees are unlikely to provide an effective \nsolution to the lack of access to credit faced by \nbusinesses.\n\n1  The ratio of private sector credit is the most commonly used indicator of access to finance and generally considered to be the best indicator of \nfinancial sector development.

Reform is also under way in the Cook Islands, Fiji, and Samoa  \n\n3  A 2003 United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) report noted the existence of around 2,250 schemes in almost 100 \n\ncountries.

Vienna: UNIDO. \n\n\f2\n\nCREDIT GUARANTEES: CHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE IN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nQUESTIONING THE CASE FOR \nCREDIT GUARANTEES\n\nThere is no strong theoretical justification for \nthe use of credit guarantees. However, especially \nwhen the reasons for the failure of banks to \nprovide business finance have more to do with \nan unwillingness to lend than risk aversion. \nFurthermore, finance theory suggests that when a \nguarantee is priced correctly to incorporate the risk \nof non-repayment, a guarantee will have negligible \nimpact on lending. This is because the default risk \nwill be reflected in the cost of any guarantee and \nultimately the interest rate charged to a borrower.4  \n\nPractical experience also suggests that there is a \nweak case for using credit guarantees to increase \nbusiness access to finance. There are isolated \nexamples of success, but few rigorous evaluations \nof guarantee schemes have been undertaken. \nWhere the schemes have been deemed successful, \nthey do not demonstrate an increase in lending \nrelative to what would have occurred without any \nguarantee. None of the active credit schemes in the \nPacific have resulted in any appreciable increase in \nlending and several have suffered significant losses. \nMoreover, to make a substantial difference to the \namount of credit granted, guarantee schemes would \nhave to be very large, and well beyond the scale of \nthe schemes operating in the Pacific region.\n\nThe activities of nonbank credit institutions, such \nas finance companies and development banks in \nthe Pacific also call into question the case for credit \nguarantees. In contrast to commercial banks, these \ninstitutions, and even some large wholesalers, have \neither actively embraced the opportunities afforded \nby secured transactions reforms\u2014the Credit \n\nCorporation Group is one such example\u2014 \nor are actively exploring opportunities to introduce \nnew instruments, such as agriculture supply \nchain financing, secured against buyer contracts, \ninventory, and accounts receivable. Provident \nfunds\u2014an important source of credit in the \nPacific\u2014have also been also been actively searching \nfor lending opportunities. Governments have come \nto see both development banks and provident funds \nas essential to financing growth opportunities when \ncommercial banks have been reluctant to do so.\n\nThese actions undermine the case for a more \nextensive use of credit guarantee schemes in the \nPacific. Furthermore, and even more troubling, is \nthe real prospect that resorting to credit guarantees \nwill stifle the development of credit assessment \nand risk management capabilities in Pacific banks, \nincluding the development of credit assessment \nmethodologies better suited to the reality of Pacific \nbusiness conditions. Rather than seeing credit \nguarantees as the solution to access to credit \nconstraints, the paper promotes a comprehensive \nreform of the business environment, alongside a \ngreater use of secured transactions frameworks, and \nthe promotion of other nonbank credit instruments, \nsuch as trade credit. \n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 1 \ngives a brief introduction of the issues. Section 2 \nprovides the starting point for the discussion with \nan outline of a conceptual approach to barriers \nto lending. Section\u00a03 provides an overview of the \ndesign features of credit guarantees. The Pacific \nexperience with credit guarantees is addressed in \nSection 4, and this is followed by a discussion of the \nwider international experience in Section 5. These \nexperiences with the use of credit guarantees in the \n\n4  M. Gudger. 1998. Credit Guarantees: An Assessment of the State of Knowledge and New Avenues of Research.

THE CHALLENgES OF LENDiNg\n\nIn order to lend profitably to businesses, lenders \nneed to be confident that loans will be repaid \nin a timely fashion, in accordance with lending \ncovenants. In any financial system, lenders face \nthree critical problems in making lending decisions:\n\n(i)  Asymmetric information. Recipients \nof loans always know more about their \nbusinesses than lenders ever can. (This is \none of the main sources of lending risk).\n\n(ii)  Moral hazard. Since borrowers are using \nanother party\u2019s finance, their incentives to \ntake risks increase.\n\n(iii)  Adverse selection. If lenders overprice risk, \n\nthe only borrowers to which they can lend are \nthose who earn very high rates of return on \ntheir investments. The risk of nonrepayment \nof loans increases in these cases.\n\nLenders have typically dealt with these problems \nby requiring borrowers to pledge collateral as security \nagainst nonrepayment of loans. The fact that default \nleads to the forfeiture of the collateral reduces the \nchances of risky behavior or fraud. In almost all \nlending to smaller businesses, lenders also require a \npersonal guarantee from borrowers so that business \nowners risk not only their business assets but also \ntheir personal assets.\n\nensure that assets have not been pledged to \nanother lender, and repossess them in the event of \ndefault. Pacific lenders have traditionally preferred \nreal estate as collateral. Two problems with using \nreal estate exist, however. First, much of the land \nin the Pacific is communally owned, which makes \npledging difficult, even for those who hold land \nleases. Second, it is costly and time-consuming to \nrepossess real estate in the event of default.\n\nREVOLUTIONIzING BUSINESS \nLENDING THROUGH SECURED \nTRANSACTIONS\n\nTo address the problems of using real estate as \ncollateral, extensive reforms of secured transactions \nframeworks have been undertaken in many of \nthe Pacific island economies in recent years \n(footnote\u00a02). These reforms have implemented a \ncollateral framework for lending against movable \nassets that is among the most modern in the \nworld.5 Since lenders place substantial reliance on \ncollateral in managing risk, these reforms have the \npotential to revolutionize business lending in the \nregion. While the reforms have led to a significant \nnumber of new loans, they have not yet resulted in \na substantial expansion in the availability of finance \nfor businesses.\n\nEffectively dealing with these problems requires \na sound legal framework for lending, which makes it \nsimple and inexpensive to pledge assets as security, \n\nMany bankers have failed to appreciate how \nthe reforms bring legal certainty to the priority \nsurrounding a security interest and the ease of \n\n5  P. Holden et al. 2014. Unlocking Finance for Growth: Secured Transactions Reforms in Pacific Island Economies. Manila: Asian Development Bank.\n\n\fTHE CHALLENGES OF LENDING\n\n5\n\nenforcement procedures. Not surprisingly, the \ncontinued reluctance of many commercial lenders \nto utilize the new framework has promoted a search \nfor additional instruments that will potentially lead \nto more lending,6 hence the interest in guarantees.\n\n6  An exception is the Credit Corporation in Solomon Islands, which has increased its lending by a factor of 7 using the secured transactions \n\nframework.\n\n\f6\n\n3. gUArANTEES iN PrACTiCE\n\nGuarantee schemes typically take one of three forms:\n\n(i)  Mutual guarantee associations or \n\nsocieties, which are formed by a group \nof businesses or organizations, and which \nextend collective guarantees to loans issued \nto the members of the association.\n\n(ii)  State schemes, which involve budget \n\nsupport for lending to small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs), or other target \ngroups, or for particular purposes.\n\n(iii)  Counter guarantees, which are, in effect a \nform of reinsurance, and generally found in \ndeveloped countries. Under this mechanism, \na guarantee agency reduces its risk exposures \nby buying counter-guarantees for a portion \nof the guarantees it has issued.\n\nOf interest is the rationale for these schemes, \nhow the guarantee is structured, the risks, and ways \nin which these risks can be managed.\n\nA CRITIQUE OF THE RATIONALE \nFOR CREDIT GUARANTEES\n\nCredit guarantees have been justified on three main \ngrounds:8\n\n(i)  The guarantor may have better knowledge \nof the risk of lending to certain businesses \n\nor sectors than lenders, so that providing a \nguarantee reduces information asymmetries \nand improves the access to credit of \nbusinesses.\n\n(ii)   Guarantee schemes can help diversify risks \n\namong lenders.\n\n(iii)   If the guarantor is subject to the same \n\nregulatory requirements as the lender, there \nis greater potential to advance credit to \nparticular borrowers.7\n\nIn considering the validity of these justifications \nfor Pacific island economies, an important \nconsideration is that commercial bank behavior \nin the Pacific can be characterized more as an \nunwillingness to lend, rather than risk aversion\u2014\nwhere the risk-adverse investor demands a premium \nover the market rate.8 In these circumstances, \nare guarantees an effective means to promote \nincreased lending?\n\nSome advocates of guarantees claim that, if some \n\npercentage of a bank loan is guaranteed, banks can \nbe induced to make unsecured loans. However, \nthis does not address the issues of asymmetric \ninformation, moral hazard, and adverse selection \ndiscussed above. Lending practices in most high-\nincome countries support this contention. In the \nUnited States, over 70% of business loans are \nsecured by movable property, and less than 10% of \n\n7 \n\nFor more details, see P. Honohan. 2008. Partial Credit Guarantees: Principles and Practice. A paper prepared for the Conference on Partial Credit \nGuarantees. Washington, DC. 13\u201314 March. \n\n8  Z. Bodie, A. Kane, and A. Marcus. 2005. Investments. 6th ed. Singapore: McGraw Hill. p. 168. Bodie, et al. define the risk-averse investor as \u201cone \nthat is willing to consider only risk free or speculative prospects with positive risk premia\u2026 Loosely speaking, a risk-averse investor \u2018penalizes\u2019 the \nexpected rate of return of a risky portfolio by a certain percentage (or penalizes the expected profit by a dollar amount) to account for the risk \ninvolved. The greater the risk the larger the penalty.\u201d\n\n\fGUARANTEES IN PRACTICE\n\n7\n\nall loans by commercial banks to nonpublicly listed \ncorporations are unsecured.9 In general, guarantees \nwithout any form of collateral are not a solution to a \nlack of credit for business.\n\nFurther, an often-overlooked point is that a \nguarantee scheme would, theoretically, have no \neffect on lending when the guarantee is correctly \npriced. This is because the cost charged by the \nguarantor would reflect the calculated probability \nof loan losses, and this cost would be passed on to \nborrowers by the lender.10\n\nThis point sharpens consideration of the wider \npublic policy issues surrounding credit guarantees. \nWhen the guarantee is not correctly priced, there is \nsome distortion in the allocation of finance within \nthe economy. If lending increases, the associated \nrisks have merely been transferred to another party. \nThere is no change to the probability of loan losses. \nWhere the state provides guarantees, the cost of \nany loan losses will be borne by taxpayers. If donors \nprovide guarantees, they will absorb any losses. \nHowever, the opportunity cost of so doing will still \nbe borne by the population in the recipient country \nin the form of less funding of other initiatives,  \n(e.g., for promoting health programs).\n\nTYPES OF CREDIT GUARANTEES\n\nGenerally, guarantees can take two forms: the \nguarantee of individual loans; and the guarantee of \na whole portfolio, with the proportion guaranteed \n\ndetermined by the structure of each scheme. \nHybrids of individual and portfolio guarantees also \nexist.\n\n1.  guarantees of individual loans. In the \n\ncase of guarantees of individual loans, the \nguarantee may apply pari passu, where \ncoverage applies equally and without \npreference to the principal, and where the \namount of unpaid principal repaid to the \nlender by the guarantor is determined by \nthe percentage of the loan guaranteed. \nAlternatively, the guarantee may apply to \nearly or late tranches of scheduled principal \npayments, or to longer maturities, when short \nmaturities are considered unduly risky.\n\nGuarantees may apply only to the unpaid \n\nloan balance of a defaulting borrower after \nany collateral is sold. The amount guaranteed \ncould be limited to the unpaid principal, or \ncould include unpaid interest and fees. The \ntransaction costs of repossessing and selling \ncollateral in the event of nonpayment could \nbe borne by the guarantor or the lender, or \nshared between the two.\n\n2.  guarantees of portfolios. Portfolio \n\nguarantees cover a larger number of loans. \nThis approach may carry greater deadweight \nlosses and involve less additionality, when \nlenders include loans that they would have \nmade anyway, i.e., the moral hazard is larger \nthan is the case with guarantees of individual \nloans. Moreover, there is no direct connection \n\n9 \n\nSources: United States Federal Reserve, Board of Governors. 2010.\u00a0Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Financial Accounts of the United States, \nFlow of Funds, Balance Sheets and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts, Fourth Quarter 2010.

These problems can be tempered \nby applying strict criteria for loan eligibility, \nloan size, or project activity, but care must \nbe taken not to verge into directed credit \nand to preserve the market-orientation of \nbanks\u2019 loan decisions. Portfolio guarantees \ncould result in lower transaction costs for a \nguarantee agency, although it might be hard \nto quantify, ex ante, the costs of monitoring \nthe loan criteria mentioned above.\n\n3.  Hybrid guarantees. A hybrid guarantee \n\nis a combination of individual and portfolio \nguarantees. Loans to a particular target \npopulation could be funded through a \nportfolio approach, whether in a particular \nsector or a class of borrowers (such as \nagriculture SMEs), in addition to guaranteed \nindividual loans. Alternatively, loans of up to \na certain size could be included in a portfolio \nguarantee, with individual guarantees \napplying above a certain specified loan \namount.\n\nCOVERAGE, COST, AND RISK \nALLOCATION\n\nGuarantee schemes vary in terms of the \ncoverage ratio (i.e., the proportion of a loan that \nis guaranteed), the term, and the way costs and \nrisks are shared among borrower, lender, and \nguarantor. Whatever the configuration, international \nexperience in the implementation of guarantee \nschemes shows that the risk of any particular \nscheme failing can be reduced through prudential \n\noversight, good governance, and robust risk \nmanagement systems.\n\nCoverage ratios vary depending on the type of \nthe loan, the maturity of the loan, and the riskiness \nof the loan. Many guarantee schemes in developed \ncountries, and some in developing countries, \nhave a coverage ratio of 100%.11  But moral hazard \nis high in these cases, especially if borrowers \nare not subject to any penalty in the event of \nnonrepayment. Experience shows that a 100% \nguarantee encourages strategic defaults,12 especially \nif employed in new schemes and in an environment \nof nascent or highly underdeveloped financial \nmarkets. In schemes that offer 100% coverage, the \nincentive for banks to perform due diligence, risk \nassessment, and loan recovery functions well is \nblunted, particularly if transaction costs of doing so \nare high.13\n\nGuarantors have to put correspondingly greater \neffort into these functions. The lower the guarantee \nratio, the greater the incentive for banks to \nperform due diligence, monitor loans, and pursue \nrepossession in the event of default. The higher the \ncoverage ratio, the greater the incentive for lenders \nto keep long-standing, lower risk borrowers out of a \nguarantee scheme and put riskier borrowers into the \nportion of their portfolio that is guaranteed.\n\nWhen a lender has a loan guaranteed, the interest \n\nrate charged to the borrower should be lower than \nwould be the case without a guarantee because the \nrisk of loss is lower.

In general, \nbanks have insisted on a substantial premium \nover prime interest rates, even though a \nsignificant portion of the loan is covered \nby a guarantee. Thus, the amount that the \nguarantor can charge borrowers for the \nguarantee must be limited if problems of \nadverse selection are to be avoided. If the \nguarantor charges a large amount on top \nof the banks, only very risky borrowers will \napply for loans. Therefore, it is rare that the \nguarantor can charge a sufficient premium to \ncover the risk for covering a major portion of \nthe loan.14 15\n\nThe fee level should also be consistent with a \nmarket-oriented guarantee scheme and promote a \nlevel playing field\u2014promote contestable markets\u2014\nto allow for private guarantee schemes, in addition \nto any government guarantee schemes.\n\nIt is important that some collateral pledge be part \nof any loan agreement subject to a guarantee, even \nthough a major purpose of guarantees is to reduce \nthe risk to the lender and, hence, the collateral \ndemanded by the lender. As Holden (1997) notes, \n\n\u2026 in practical terms guarantees are not a \nsubstitute for being able to secure loans \nagainst collateral. All the problems with \nunsecured lending exist with guarantees. \nAll that a guarantee does is shift the risk, or \nsome percentage of the risk, from the primary \nlenders, the banks, to the guarantors. None \nof the problems that exist in developing \nfinancial markets are solved by guarantees. \n\nThere is simply no substitute for reform of \nsecured transactions systems if financial \nmarkets are to adequately fund small and \nmedium sized businesses. The history of \nfailure of financial intermediaries is replete \nwith cases of overly aggressive pursuit of \nlending opportunities (footnote 15).\n\nIn the Pacific, guarantee schemes have not \nincreased the supply of credit materially. The risks  \nto borrowers associated with business failure \ndescribed in the preceding paragraph adversely \naffect the demand for credit. Raising the ratio \nof\u00a0private sector credit to\u00a0GDP requires\u00a0that  \nat least one, but preferably both, of the credit \ndemand and supply functions move outward.  \nCredit guarantee schemes do not appear to have \nthis impact.\n\nResponsibility for due diligence of any loan \napplication covered by a guarantee scheme can \nrest with the lender or guarantor, or both. Clearly, \nthe capability of either party is important to the \nallocation of this responsibility, as is the willingness to \nallow the other party to undertake the assessment. \nIn principle, the party with the most to lose in the \nevent of default should perform the loan assessment. \nIn practice, it is not uncommon for both parties \nto do the assessment, essentially doubling the \ntransaction costs of loan processing. An arrangement \nthat deals with this problem is one where both the \nlender and the guarantor contract due diligence to \na trusted outside party. This mechanism could also \nreduce political pressure to make loans to favored \nborrowers, if the lending or guaranteeing institution \nis government-owned. Similarly, the lender and \n\n14  P.

Banks need to be \nconfident in the financial strength and management \nof a guarantee scheme to encourage them to \nlend. Putting in place an appropriate regulatory \nand supervisory framework is one way to assure \nbanks of the credibility of any guarantee scheme. \nComponents should include minimum capital \nrequirements, safety of investments of the \nguarantee fund, leverage, solvency ratios, limits on \nexposures, connectedness, coverage, and use of risk \nmanagement tools.\n\ngovernance and management. Strong corporate \ngovernance, including the use of suitably skilled \nprivate sector personnel in government guaranteed \nschemes, is needed to ensure the proper \nadministration of a guarantee fund. Safeguards to \nensure that a scheme can be protected against \n\npolitical pressure will also be needed. The central \nbank or a financial system regulator should be \nthe supervisor. Legislation may be required to \nestablish and enforce standards. Auditors and \npossibly credit rating agencies should play a part, \nparticularly if reinsurance or securitization is being \nused. Successful schemes rely on qualified and \nexperienced staff, with credit evaluation skills and \ngood knowledge of the culture of the borrower.\n\nrisk management. Key components of a sound \nrisk management framework include capital \nadequacy ratios that depend on default history, and \nthat should be generally in the range of 10%\u201320% of \noutstanding guarantees; establishment of a risk fund \nwith proper investment and valuation standards \nand liquidity requirements; real time loan portfolio \nquality evaluation and appropriate provisioning; \nand the use of generally acceptable accounting \nstandards.\n\nGuarantee schemes must promote financial \nmarket development. It is important that they \nare not \u201cone-off\u201d interventions to encourage \na particular sector, but rather be available to \nguarantee commercial loans more generally. If \nguarantees are targeted, they risk engendering all \nthe problems associated with attempts to \u201cpick \nwinners,\u201d as well as failing to promote a more \ngeneral lending culture among financial institutions.\n\n16 \n\nJ.

COULD gUArANTEES iNCrEASE bUSiNESS \n\nCrEDiT iN THE PACiFiC?\n\nIn answering this question, it is important to keep \nin mind that the difficulty in using real assets as \ncollateral has not been the sole reason for the \ndifficulties businesses have had in accessing credit. \nThere are several other contributing factors, \nincluding:\n\n(i) \n\nfees for transactions services and \ninternational transfers are significantly more \nprofitable than interest on loans, generating \nhigh rates of return on commercial bank \nequity; \n\n(ii)  commercial banks have substantial \n\noligopolistic market power in the provision \nof financial services; \n\n(iii)  stringent prudential norms imposed by \n\nthe parents of foreign bank branches often \nmake it possible for the branch to lend only \nto larger corporations or to governments, \nreducing the incentive to take lending risks; \n\n(iv)  business have lacked the capacity to  \n\nprepare business plans and funding \nproposals, the absence of which has made \nit difficult for lenders to make credit risk \nassessments; and \n\n(v)  credit information is weak or nonexistent, \nas not all countries have credit bureaus \nand where they exist they only collect \n\u201cnegative credit information.\u201d There are \nplans, however, for existing bureaus to \ncollect \u201cpositive\u201d credit information and \nsome lenders are exploring proxies for \ncredit information, such as mobile phone \ntransactions history.\n\nThe availability of credit guarantees will not \naddress most of these issues, and may even \nimpede improvements to business plans and credit \ninformation. And, where these schemes do exist in the \nPacific, most have been directed at increasing lending \nto SMEs. Even schemes that possess many of the \n\nSome characteristics of guarantee schemes in the Pacific that our analysis has identified are:\n\n\u2022\t In general, schemes are targeted at increasing lending to small and medium-sized enterprises\u2014in \n\nsome cases by banks only, in others by a broader range of lenders.\n\n\u2022\t Most are public sector schemes, funded through the national budget, and sometimes with a \n\ncontribution from a bilateral or multilateral donor (as a loan or grant to the national government for \nthe purpose of funding the guarantee scheme).\n\n\u2022\t There is no general model for the administration of the schemes; administrators have included \n\ncentral banks (Fiji and Solomon Islands); dedicated public sector bodies (Kiribati, and Pohnpei in the \nFederated States of Micronesia); small business development centers (PNG and Samoa); contracted \nthird parties (PNG and Samoa); and a donor (the International Finance Corporation in PNG).\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\f12\n\nCREDIT GUARANTEES: CHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE IN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nBox continued\n\nand Solomon Islands).\n\n\u2022\t Coverage ratios are either 50% (two schemes in PNG and one in Samoa), or 80% plus (PNG, Samoa, \n\n\u2022\t The schemes are pari passu (coverage applies equally and without preference to principal).\n\n\u2022\t Earlier schemes guaranteed individual loans (PNG, Samoa, and Solomon Islands), but several \n\nportfolio-based schemes have been introduced recently (one in Fiji and two in PNG).\n\n\u2022\t Fees vary by scheme, from 0%\u20131% to 1% to \u201ccommercial.\u201d\n\n\u2022\t There are no cases of counter-guarantees, reinsurance, or securitizations.\n\n\u2022\t Risk-weighting of guaranteed portfolio for capital adequacy requirements is not always clear.  \n\nIf, for example, a percentage of a financial institutions loan portfolio is guaranteed, does this mean \nthat the capital adequacy requirements against the portion of the portfolio that is guaranteed are \ncorrespondingly lower?\n\n\u2022\t Typically, there is no regulation and supervision of the schemes.\n\n\u2022\t The only scheme in which \u201cprivate\u201d (nongovernment) money is at risk is the World Bank\u2019s risk share \nfacility in PNG, where the International Finance Corporation provides second-loss cover. However, \nthis facility also includes first-loss cover through a World Bank grant-financed project, which \nreduced the fees payable on the commercial portion of the guarantee to levels acceptable to the \nbanks, and significant technical assistance grants. It is, therefore, best characterized as a blended \npublic\u2013private scheme.\n\nPNG = Papua New Guinea.\n\nfeatures outlined in the previous section have failed to \nmake much difference to access credit in the Pacific \nregion, as the following discussion demonstrates.\n\nPACIFIC EXPERIENCE WITH \nGUARANTEES\n\nAlthough comprehensive information can be \ndifficult to obtain, it appears there are at least seven \nactive credit guarantee schemes in the Pacific, \nalthough a number of others have been established, \nclosed, and/or revived since the 1990s (Appendix \n\n2). The overall performance of these schemes \nhas not been encouraging and suggests that any \nproposals for further schemes be treated with great \ncaution. Loan losses in two schemes\u2014in Papua New \nGuinea (PNG) and Samoa\u2014have been substantial. \nOther schemes have failed to guarantee many loans. \nAn ongoing scheme in Solomon Islands has issued \nguarantees on only 59 loans over 5 years. (Two \nschemes in Fiji and PNG have been underway for \nless than 3 years, so drawing conclusions from any \nevaluation would be premature.)\n\n\f COULD GUARANTEES INCREASE BUSINESS CREDIT IN THE PACIFIC?\n\n13\n\nTHE LIMITS OF INCREASING \nPRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT IN THE \nPACIFIC THROUGH GUARANTEES\n\nGuarantee schemes cannot support more than \na very small proportion of credit granted in an \neconomy. Even Pacific island economies, where the \namount of credit to the private sector is relatively \nlow, new credit granted each year amounts to over \n$100 million. Table 1 illustrates this point based on \nthe assumption that credit turnover or loan renewal \noccurs on average every year.17 \n\nEven in Tonga, the smallest country in the \n\nexample, any credit guarantee scheme would have \n\nto total over $5 million under the assumption that \ncredit turnover occurs every 2 years, or $11\u00a0million \non the assumption that it occurs every year. For \nPNG, the amount would need to be $116.5 million \nfor a credit turnover every 2 years, and $333 million \nfor every year. Clearly, these amounts are larger \nthan even the most ambitious donor-sponsored \nguarantee schemes.\n\nThis discussion also begs the question of the \ncost effectiveness of guarantee schemes. Simply \nsaying that \u201cthere is additionality\u201d is not sufficient \njustification for the time that designing and \nimplementing a small credit guarantee scheme would \ntake, even before allowing for expected losses.\n\n17  These assumptions lie at the low end of loan turnover. Since most bank credits to the private sector are supplied by commercial banks, the average \nterm of loans is significantly less than 2 years, and could even be less than 1 year, which would imply that total renewed credit to the private sector \ncould be at least total private sector credit at any particular moment in time.\n\n\f14\n\n5.\u2002 iNTErNATiONAL ExPEriENCE wiTH  \n\nCrEDiT gUArANTEE SCHEMES\n\nA more complete assessment of the potential \nrole for credit guarantees in the Pacific needs to \nincorporate international experience with credit \nguarantee schemes. A comprehensive review of \nguarantee schemes beyond the Pacific is outside \nthe scope of this paper, however, and unfortunately \nthere is only minimal literature that addresses \nthe effectiveness of guarantee schemes. Further, \nsince the size of guarantees can be large and the \nnumber of participants in any scheme relatively \nsmall, evaluation does not lend itself to randomized \ncontrolled trials. A further major drawback  \nto rigorous evaluation is that counterfactuals  \nare not available.\n\nFor the most part, then, only general conclusions \ncan be drawn. Earlier sections of this paper pointed \n\nto the weak theoretical foundations of guarantee \nschemes, and the general experience with the \nimplementation of these schemes is not positive, as \nin the Pacific. While there may be a few examples \nof apparently successful schemes, the practical \nimplementation of good design, risk management, \nand prudential oversight is too demanding to \nachieve more than isolated success.\n\nThe review of a widely heralded credit guarantee \nscheme in Colombia reinforces this point.18 It states \nthat, although risks factors were kept low, the \nadministrative costs of ensuring a strong portfolio \nwere over 10%, with the result that the scheme \ncould not generate sufficient revenue to be self-\nsustaining. Generalizing, the author concludes, \n\u201cthe experience of all guarantee funds, whether in \n\nTable 1: The Value of Credit Guarantees Necessary to Increase the Private Sector to Gross Domestic \nProduct Ratio by 5 Percentage Points Assuming an 80% Guaranteea\n\nTotal  \nPrivate Sector Credit\n($ million)\n\nRatio of  \nPrivate Sector Credit  \nto GDP\n(%)\n\nGuarantee Scheme Size Necessary to \nIncrease the Ratio of Private Sector Credit to \nGDP by 5 Percentage Points\n($ million)\n\nCountry\n\nFiji\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nSamoa\n\nTonga\n\nSolomon Islands\n\n2,552\n\n4,660\n\n327\n\n210\n\n130\n\n62\n\n29\n\n47\n\n18\n\n27\n\n102\n\n186\n\n13\n\n8.5\n\n5\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\na\u2002 The amount of new credit granted per year is calculated in the following way. If the average term of credit granted is 1 year, then assuming total \n\nprivate sector credit neither increases nor decreases, renewed loans will equal the amount of total credit to the private sector. Thus, in the case of Fiji, \nit would amount to $2,552 million. To increase credit to the private sector by 5 percentage points, an 80% guarantee scheme would have to amount \nto $102 million (5% of $2,552 million*.8).\n\nSource: Based on calculations taken from International Monetary Fund.

The Small Firms Loan guarantee Scheme \n(SFLg) in the United Kingdom. Under this \nsubstantial small business guarantee scheme, \nwhich commenced in 1981, banks could \nlend up to \u00a3250,00019 to eligible businesses \nand have 75% of any default losses met by \nthe government. However, as the scheme \nmatured, losses mounted. In 2004, the \nGraham Report20 documented bad debt \nlosses of approximately 20%.\n\nHowever, an ex post review published in \n2010 commissioned by SFLG concluded \nthat it had been highly successful, with a \nsubstantial amount of additionality and that \nthe positive effects of the \u201cloans obtained \nin 2006 show the overall benefits outweigh \nthe cost to the economy in terms of [gross \nvalue added] GVA.\u201d21 The report did not \nfully analyze the cost of the defaults of the \nscheme against the purported benefits. 22 23 24\n\nIn 2009, SFLG was replaced by the \nEnterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, \nwhich increased the size of eligible loans to \n\u00a31 million. However, only 3 years later, an \ninvestigation by The Guardian concluded \n\nthat the scheme had misused over \n\u00a3200\u00a0million ($300\u00a0million) of the funds that \nhad been used for the guarantees.23 Further \ninvestigations reached similar conclusions,24  \nand there were reports that the scheme was \nbeing investigated by public prosecutors for \nmisuse of funds by the banks.\n\n2.  The United States Small business \n\nAdministration Loan guarantee Program. \nThis is the largest guarantee fund in the world, \nguaranteeing about $16 billion per year.  \nA review of the scheme concluded that  \n\u201c[t]he average sales and employment numbers \nsuggest that financing did not give a big \nboost to firms in terms of level of sales or \nemployment; in most cases, a greater increase \nwas found in the prefinancing years than in \nthe post-financing years.\u201d25 Further, although \nheralded in some circles, the $16\u00a0billion of \nSmall Business Administration loans per year \nneed to be seen in the context of the more \nthan $1 trillion new credit granted to the \nprivate sector annually in the United States.\n\nThe experience with the loan guarantee \nprograms in the United Kingdom and in \nthe United States reinforces the point \nmade above regarding the difficulty and \ncost of monitoring such programs. Close \nmonitoring results in high transactions costs \nfor guarantee schemes, which frequently \ncompromise their sustainability, as the \nexample of Columbia illustrates.\n\n19  Approximately $400,000.\n\n20  T.

These\u00a0 \nfactors would weigh especially heavily  \nin the Pacific, where capacity for close \nmonitoring is limited.\n\n\f17\n\n6.\u2002 TrADE CrEDiT AND bUSiNESS \n\nENvirONMENT rEFOrM FOr SMALL  \nAND MEDiUM-SiZED ENTErPriSES\n\nCredit guarantees are often proposed as a solution \nto the difficulty SMEs have in accessing finance \nin the Pacific. Any associated policy discussion \nneeds to be clear on the policy objective behind \nthe proposed support, and whether a guarantee \non lending is the appropriate way to meet this \nobjective.\n\nLending to SMEs is inherently risky. Reducing \nrisk to lenders is the primary reason for the interest \nin guarantees. Banks often cite risk aversion, \npoor business practices, and a lack of financial \ninformation as reasons for their reluctance to lend. \nThe fundamental reason why lending to SMEs is \nrisky is that small businesses fail in large numbers, \nwith the failure for start-ups being particularly high. \nWhile it is true that SMEs create large numbers of \njobs, the durability of this employment growth is \nnot assured, given that SMEs also close down in \ndisproportionate numbers. The net contribution to \nemployment and growth is often, therefore, small.\n\nPacific SMEs are no different and the lessons \n\nlearned elsewhere apply in the region. SMEs \neverywhere struggle to fund their businesses. \nLenders in high-income countries also do not \nreadily provide funding for some of the same \nreasons that lenders in the Pacific refuse to lend \nto SMEs. Similarly, for funding start-ups, which \nare often given as justification for guarantees, it is \nrare even in high-income countries for commercial \nlenders to fund new businesses. The typical sources \nof new business finance are savings, investments \n\nfrom friends and family, and, in some cases, \ninvestments from \u201cangel\u201d investors. There is a good \nbusiness reason for commercial banks not to fund \nstart-ups, so guarantees should not try to address a \nperceived market failure that does not really exist.\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT \nREFORM AND SMALL AND \nMEDIUM-SIzED ENTERPRISES\n\nThe implication of the previous discussion is that \nthe main economic benefits accrue from the \ngrowth of individual SMEs\u2014from a small to a larger \nbusiness with the consequent employment and \ngrowth impacts\u2014and that any assistance is best \ndirected to those firms that will grow, as opposed \nto all SMEs, or those that are struggling. The policy \nimplication is that government intervention should \nbe directed toward removing broad constraints to \nbusiness growth through business environment \nreform and the development of financing \ninstruments suited to the typical balance sheet \nstructures of SMEs. A policy that targets providing \nearly-stage small businesses with credit guarantees \nrisks losing a significant portion of the guaranteed \nfunds.\n\nFrom this perspective, SME policy differs in \n\nno essential way from more general business \nenvironment policy. One of the best explanations \nof this point is by Hallberg in her evaluation of the \nWorld Bank\u2019s SME policy:25\n\n25  K. Hallberg. 2000. A Market Oriented Strategy for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises. Washington, DC: World Bank.\n\n\f18\n18\n\nCREDIT GUARANTEES: CHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE IN THE PACIFIC REGION\nCREDIT GUARANTEES: CHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE IN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nMany of the often-repeated justifications for \nscale-based enterprise promotion have little \nempirical support. But whether their actions \nare based on myth or reality, governments in \nboth developing and industrialized countries \ndo intervene to promote SMEs. Their SME \nassistance strategies often try to achieve a \ncombination of equity objectives (alleviating \npoverty and addressing social, ethnic, and \ngender inequalities) and efficiency objectives \n(raising the productivity and profitability of \nfirms). The confusion created by multiple \nobjectives often leads governments to \nover-subsidize services that could be \nprovided by the market. Direct provision of \ncredit and nonfinancial assistance to SMEs \ntend to substitute for markets rather than \ndeal with the underlying causes of market \nunderdevelopment.\n\nThus, a guiding principle for effective financial \n\nmarket development is that the reform of the \nbusiness environment is paramount. Hallberg sums \nup the issue well:\n\nThis report suggests that the overall \nbusiness environment is the most important \ndeterminant of SME competitiveness and \ngrowth, as well as a necessary condition for \nthe success of targeted assistance programs. \nNecessary reforms to improve the business \nenvironment go beyond macroeconomic and \nstructural adjustment to the alleviation of \nmicroeconomic and institutional constraints \nthat discriminate against small firms and \nreduce their growth and competitiveness.\n\nWith respect to the means of financing that are \n\nconsistent with financial market development, \nthe importance of secured transactions reforms \nhas been emphasized. In addition, a greater use of \n\nnonbank financing instruments, such as trade credit, \nwould significantly alleviate the access to finance \nconstraint that businesses face in the Pacific.\n\nTRADE CREDIT: PART OF THE \nSOLUTION TO INCREASING \nBUSINESS FINANCE\n\nEffective financial systems intermediate between \nsavers and borrowers. On the savings side, this \nis done through financial institutions that can \nsafely and effectively hold savings and pay \ninterest on those balances. On the lending side, \nfinancial institutions provide credit to investors \nand consumers to enable them either to invest in \nprojects that will bring future returns, or finance \nconsumption. For economies to grow, financial \ninstitutions need to focus on longer term, business \norientated investments.\n\nHowever, it is not only financial institutions that \n\nhave the potential to extend credit. Businesses \nthemselves can do so and, in advanced economies, \nthis type of credit, known as trade credit, plays a \ncrucial role in business financing. It arises when \nsuppliers deliver goods and services to their \ncustomers on credit terms, only requiring payment 15, \n30, or 60 days after delivery. Essentially, this amounts \nto short-term financing of their customers, and the \nfinancing differs from bank credit in three ways:\n\n\u2022\t Suppliers are not lending cash, but are \n\nfinancing the purchase of the goods or services \nthat they have supplied\u2014they are lending \ngoods and services.\n\n\u2022\t There is rarely a formal loan contract involved \n\nbeyond the terms that are listed on the  \ninvoice.\n\n\u2022\t Suppliers are not part of the finance sector.\n\n\f TRADE CREDIT AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REFORM FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES\n\n1919\n\nEssentially, trade credit extends total credit \nadvanced in an economy because, when suppliers \ngive credit terms to their customers, their trade \ncredit recipients can, in turn, provide credit down \ntheir supply line. This, therefore, \u201clengthens the \ncredit chain.\u201d\n\nThe amounts involved are often large. One study \nof a sample of 48 countries found that about 20% of \nall non-equity investment is provided through trade \ncredit.26 Other studies also show the importance of \ntrade credit. For example, the analysis of a sample of \nsmall firms\u2019 financial positions in Portugal revealed \nthat trade credit exceeded other short-term credit, \nincluding that supplied by banks, by a factor of up to \nthree.27 Even large firms make extensive use of trade \ncredit. A study of stock exchange-listed firms in the \nUnited States revealed that trade credit is their most \nimportant type of short-term debt, amounting to \ntwice that of other short-term debt.28\n\nTrade credit has several advantages for \n\nbusinesses in general, and for SMEs in particular:\n\n\u2022\t It serves as a substitute for bank credit for \nproviding finance to credit-constrained \nbusinesses.\n\n\u2022\t Suppliers providing trade credit have, in \n\ngeneral, a much better knowledge of their \ncustomers than do commercial banks.

It \nis well-suited to the financing needs of Pacific \nSMEs, and offers a powerful alternative to credit \nguarantees.\n\n\f21\n\n7.\u2002CONCLUSiON\n\nThis paper has assessed the case for using credit \nguarantees as a means to increase access to credit \nin Pacific island countries. It reviewed the use of \nguarantees in the Pacific region and the wider \ninternational experience. Neither in the Pacific, nor \nin other parts of the world, can compelling examples \nof successful guarantee schemes be identified. Their \npopularity in the political arena is not matched by \nevidence of making a significant difference to credit \naccess.\n\nThe paper also noted that there was no \ntheoretical case for guarantees. The guarantee \nmerely changes risk allocation, not the probability \nof default. Further, if a guarantee is correctly priced, \nthen this price will reflect the probability of default \nand will be ultimately passed on to the borrower.\n\nThe analysis also points out that the difference \nthat guarantees can make is at best marginal\u2014the \nsize of guarantees necessary to increase the ratio \nof private sector credit to gross domestic product \nby, say, 5 percentage points is too large for either \ndonor- or government-sponsored guarantee \nschemes. Even if the impact on credit was more \nencouraging, it would still be difficult to justify \n\nthe introduction of a guarantee scheme because \nimplementing a well-designed scheme\u2014that is, \none that will have minimal losses, while increasing \nlending\u2014is a demanding exercise. Issues that relate \nto sectoral targeting; the type of businesses to be \nsupported; and the length of guarantee schemes, \nmonitoring, and repossession in the event of default \nall need to be addressed.\n\nReforms of collateral frameworks of Pacific \n\nisland economies that have been completed, or are \nin process, provide a powerful new instrument to \npromote lending in the region. The disappointing \ntake-up by lenders to date does not detract from \nthe longer-term potential of secured transactions \nreforms to substantially increase access to credit  \nfor businesses of all sizes. Similarly, increasing the use \nof trade credit would also substantially alleviate the \nconstraint faced by businesses in accessing finance, \nand is a preferable alternative to guarantees.\n\nFinally, the discussion highlighted the importance \n\nof business environment reform. Attempting to \nimprove credit access in countries where it is \nextremely challenging to do business will have \nminimal lasting impact, without these reforms.\n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 1: Lending And profitAbiLity \nindicAtors for seven pAcific countries  \n(As of 31 december 2014)\n\nRatio of Private \nSector Credit to \nGross Domestic \nProduct\n(%)\n\nLoan to \nDeposit Ratio \nof Commercial \nBanks\n(%)\n\nTotal Value of Loans to \nthe Private Sector\n(millions of domestic \ncurrency units)\n\nBroad Money\n(millions of \ndomestic \ncurrency units)\n\nExcess \nLiquiditya\n(%)\n\nReturn on \nEquity\n(%)\n\nCountry\n\nFiji\n\nPalau\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nSamoa\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nTonga\n\nVanuatu\n\n62\n\n13\n\n28\n\n41\n\n21\n\n32\n\n68\n\n83\n\n17\n\n55\n\n105\n\n47\n\n63\n\n88\n\n5,264\n\n32\n\n10,264\n\n830\n\n1,703\n\n239\n\n56,747\n\n6,318\n\n . . .\n\n18,716\n\n818\n\n3,635\n\n387\n\n58,962\n\n7\n\n . . .\n\n9\n\n10\n\n27\n\n26\n\n12\n\n26\n\n . . .\n\n25\n\n11\n\n15\n\nn.a.\n\n3\n\n.\u200a.\u200a. = not available.\na\u2002Calculated as (total reserves \u2013 required reserves)/total assets.\nSource: International Monetary Fund.

It was \nestablished in 2012. Its objective is to promote and develop the local business industry, improve private sector lending \nto SMEs, and stimulate growth. The government has allocated F$4 million ($1.9 million) seed capital through the \nnational budget, with an additional allocation of F$1.5 million ($0.7 million) in the 2016 National Budget.\n\nThe guarantee scheme applies to all new loans to SMEs by financial institutions (including commercial banks, licensed \ncredit institutions, and the Fiji Development Bank) after 1 January 2012, subject to an interest rate cap (of 10% per \nannum) and eligibility criteria (all SMEs excluding the sugar cane industry, government-subsidized businesses, and \nproperty investment). Small enterprises are defined as those with turnover or total assets between F$30,000\u2013\nF$100,000 ($14,100\u2013$46,900) and 6\u201320 employees.

No guarantee fees are charged. To be covered under the scheme, financial institutions must submit \nmonthly reports to RBF, which detail all new eligible SME loans. To claim on the guarantee, a loan must have been \nin arrears for 180 days and all reasonable steps must have been taken to recover the debt.\n\nThe portfolio of loans covered increased from 187 SME loans valued at $10.7 million ($5 million) at end December \n2012, to 460 SME loans valued at F$27.2 million ($12.7 million) at end December 2013, to 708 SME loans valued \nat F$41.6 million ($19.5 million) at end December 2014.

It is funded by the Government of PNG (through IDA \ncredit) and the IFC, and is administered by the IFC. In addition to the RSF, the World Bank project \nprovides technical assistance to borrowers, financial institutions, and the government\u2019s Department of \nCommerce and Industry. The project aims to encourage commercial banks and finance companies to \nexpand lending and leasing finance to SMEs.\n\nThe RSF guarantees 50% of principal losses in portfolios of new eligible SME loans by participating \nfinancial institutions. Loans of K50,000\u2013K1.5 million ($16,800\u2013$502,600) at commercial interest rates \nwith a term of 12\u201372 months are eligible, provided the borrower is a formally registered PNG firm or \njoint venture. There are no sector limits. First-loss cover of 10% is provided through IDA funding, and \nsecond-loss cover of 40% by IFC (i.e., while IFC pays participating financial institutions up to 50% of \nprincipal losses in the portfolio, the first 10% of principal losses in the portfolio will be reimbursed to IFC \nby IDA). Participating financial institutions are charged an undisclosed commercial guarantee fee by \nIFC. BSP is now the only participating financial institution. Other financial institutions may join, subject \nto due diligence and performance criteria. The World Bank\u2019s design documents state that loans to both \nexisting businesses and start-ups are eligible, but BSP has stated that the facility will only cover loans for \nthe expansion of existing businesses, not new business start-ups.\n\nAt design, it was estimated that the total size of the RSF would be K300 million (now $100 million). \nBSP was allocated 50%, whereby its covered portfolio could grow to K150 million ($50 million), with the \nremainder to be allocated to other financial institutions.\n\nBSP\u2019s committed RSF portfolio totaled K25 million ($8.4 million) and 231 loans at end September 2013; \nK43\u00a0million ($14.4 million) and 653 loans at end June 2014; and K51 million ($17.1 million) and 1,304 loans at \nend June 2015. \n\nIn July 2013, BSP announced that it had made SME loans and advances covered by the RSF of around \nK16 million ($6 million), compared with BSP\u2019s overall lending to SMEs in excess of K480 million \n($178.9\u00a0million). It is unclear how BSP determines for which subset of new SME loans it will seek RSF \ncover.\n\nRSF uptake has been slower than forecast by the World Bank Group during design.

The Bank of PNG acts as an \nagent of the Department of Treasury in issuing the guarantee. A contracted fund manager is responsible \nfor the day-to-day management of the RSF.\n\nParticipating financial institutions sign a Portfolio Risk Sharing Agreement with the Bank of PNG, which \ndefines the loans to be covered up to a preagreed quota. All loans issued by the financial institution that \nmeet the criteria automatically fall within the guarantee issued. The RSF is funded through the ADB loan \nto the Government of PNG for the Microfinance Expansion Project.\n\nADB\u2019s PNG Microfinance Expansion Project set up an RSF in 2014, funded with $5.1 million seed \ncapital drawn from an ADB loan to the Government of PNG. The capital was placed in a trust account \ndomiciled with the Bank of PNG, which also serves as the guarantor, and executes risk share agreements \nwith participating financial institutions. A contracted fund manager is responsible for the day-to-day \nmanagement of the RSF, including due diligence of prospective participating financial institutions.  \nA Board of Trustees provides oversight.\n\nThe RSF covers 50% of materialized principal losses after offset of cash collateral and liquidation of \navailable collateral and sureties. It applies to portfolios of loans to MSEs (including natural persons) not \nexceeding K100,000 per loan/obligor and with a maximum term of 36 months by approved financial \ninstitutions. Loans to both start-ups and existing enterprises qualify.\n\nCommercial banks, microbanks, savings and loan societies, and finance companies are eligible to join, \nsubject to due diligence. Participating financial institutions sign a portfolio risk-sharing agreement with \nthe Bank of PNG, which defines the products to be covered, up to a preagreed quota. All loans issued \nthat meet the criteria automatically fall within the guarantee issued. A one-time guarantee fee based on \nthe loan term and\u00a0of\u00a0ranging from 1% to 2.2% of the principal disbursed is charged upfront.\n\nThe RSF is currently fully operationalized, and due diligence of four financial institutions have been \nfinalized and approved by the board. Three risk-sharing agreements have been signed and implemented \nas of end 2015. The fourth risk-sharing agreement is expected to be signed by early 2016.\n\nIt is too early to draw lessons from the RSF. However, it is noted that the operating model relies on \nthe services of a contracted fund manager. This overcomes potential issues around implementation \ncapacity, but will cost an estimated $1.4 million in management fees over a 5-year period, drawn from the \nADB loan. Further, as the total potential losses of the RSF may not exceed the seed capital, the potential \noutstanding portfolios covered are restricted to approximately $10 million (in kina equivalent).\n\nPNG = Papua New Guinea, RSF = Risk Share Facility.\nSource: ADB. 2013.

The scheme aims to increase access to credit by small enterprises that lack \nsufficient collateral.\n\nThe scheme guarantees up to 80% of the principal of loans of K5,000\u2013K60,000 ($1,650\u2013$19,800) \nto small businesses that are wholly owned by indigenous or naturalized citizens of PNG. Formal and \ninformal businesses are eligible, and loans can be for start-ups or expansion of existing businesses. \nBusinesses appear to be selected by the SBDC and loan proposals are forwarded to participating \nfinancial institutions. It seems that borrowers are required to provide cash collateral, so that participating \nfinancial institutions effectively bear no principal risk. SBDC signed agreements with the Rural \nDevelopment Bank (now the National Development Bank) for at least K1 million ($0.4 million), and with \nthe Australia and New Zealand Banking group Limited (ANZ) for at least K0.5 million ($0.2 million) in \n2007/2008. Committed funds were transferred upfront to participating financial institutions to cover \nfuture principal losses. It is unclear whether agreements were signed with other financial institutions.In \n2014, a representative of SBDC presented an overview of the scheme at a conference. It was reported \nthat about 100 small and medium-enterprise loans had been guaranteed to the value of $1.5 million \nsince 2005. This suggests an average loan size of $15,000.

It was \nestablished in 1995 with seed funding from the New Zealand Aid Programme (ST600,000; $231,200) and \nexpanded in 2002 through an ADB loan to the Government of Samoa for the Small Business Development \nProject (ST9 million; $3.5 million). Its objective is to facilitate access to finance for small businesses that lack \nthe collateral required for loans. The scheme covers individual loans up to ST50,000 ($19,300) to businesses \nby the Development Bank of Samoa and all four commercial banks in Samoa. It typically guarantees up to \n80% of the loan principal, while borrowers are required to secure a private guarantee or put up a term deposit \nto cover the remaining 20%. For loans of up to ST10,000 ($3,900) a 100% loan guarantee is offered. The \nSBEC plays a significant role in loan origination, appraisal, and monitoring. Loans are granted for starting \ncapital for new businesses and for working capital for existing businesses.\n\nADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department reviewed the scheme in 2011. It found that 838 guarantees were \nissued from 2002 to 2008 for ST11.6 million ($4.5 million) covering loans totaling ST15.8 million ($6.1 million). \nThe average loan value was ST18,850 ($7,300). As of 30 September 2010, 6% of guarantees had been paid \nout. A further 33% of current loans were in arrears, with arrears representing 8.5% of current loan balances \n(note: part of principal in arrears only, not total principal of loans in arrears). It conducted a survey of 100 \nrecipients of guaranteed loans, and found that 93% of sample businesses were sole proprietors. The survey \nalso found that 39% of sample businesses were engaged in services; 38% in commerce, trade, or retail; 11% in \nmanufacturing; and 2% in fishing.\n\nIn 2011, the SBEC reported that a total of 1,377 guarantees had been issued for ST16.4 million ($6.3\u00a0million) \ncovering loans totaling ST22.5 million ($8.7 million). Foreclosures amounted to ST2.1\u00a0million ($0.8 million) \nand ST6.1 million ($2.4 million) of guarantees was cleared, leaving ST8.2 million ($3.2 million) in guarantees \noutstanding. 1% of guarantees were issued for loans of <ST5,000 (<$1,900); 61% for loans of ST5,000\u2013\nST20,000 ($1,900\u2013$7,700); 38% for loans of >ST20,000 (>$7,700).\n\nADB\u2019s evaluation in 2011 found that the scheme had some success in increasing access to finance for target \nbusinesses. However, there had been insufficient incentive for the banks to be diligent in loan appraisal, \nmonitoring, and collection, given the high coverage ratio and reliance on SBEC for loan appraisal and \nmonitoring. This created moral hazard and resulted in a high level of arrears and foreclosures. Further, delays in \npayments of claims on the guarantee due to complex processes reduced bank interest in the scheme.\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ANZ = Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited.\nSources: ADB. 2011.

The project provides up to $3 million to financial institutions as:\n\nCash collateral for loans to selected agribusinesses ($2 million). Coverage is provided for up to 50% of \nthe principal of first-time loans of up to $750,000 with a maximum tenor of 7 years. Second-time loans \nare covered at 30% of the principal. Participating financial institutions receive an allocation of project \nfunds as a deposit. The participating financial institutions make independent credit decisions, although \nthe project\u2019s facility manager participates in due diligence. There is a predefined process which allows \nthe financial institution to recover the covered proportion of repayment arrears of eligible loans directly \nfrom the deposit held;\n\nSupplemental seed capital ($1 million). Participating financial institutions receive a project allocation, \nwhich they can provide to agribusinesses as an interest-free capital injection, repayable in a single \npayment with a maximum term of 7 years. The allocation per agribusiness is limited to $100,000 or 25% \nof the enterprise\u2019s financing plan.\n\nSince the AgriBusiness Support Project was approved in 2014, agreements have been signed with ANZ \nand Westpac, allocating $1.2 million to each bank\u2014$800,000 for cash collateral for loans to selected \nagribusinesses and $400,000 for supplemental seed capital. Westpac sold its entity to BSP in August \n2015.

The bank initiates legal action when the loan becomes \nnonperforming, and submits a claim if the loan remains in default for more than 90 days after a court \njudgment has been obtained.\n\nNumber of guaranteed \nloans\n\nAt the end of 2012, 55 loans were approved (36 current, 9 claims processed and paid to banks as a result of \ndefaults, and 10 guarantees cancelled as loans had been fully serviced).\n\nEstablished \n\nRationale\n\nPayout conditions\n\nDetails\n\nIn 2013, only four loans were approved for guarantee and, in 2014, only five, taking the total of individual loan \napprovals over the life of the scheme to 64.\n\nThe Solomon Islands Small Business Finance Scheme is funded by the Government of Solomon Islands and \nadministered by CBSI. It was formally established in 2007 and rolled out in 2008. Its objective is to encourage \ncommercial banks to support the SME sector, by providing security for loans to SMEs, which the bank regards \nas creditworthy but unable to provide adequate security. The government allocated SI$10 million ($1.3 \nmillion) seed capital through the national budget.\n\nThe scheme now covers 90% of the unsecured portion of bank loans of SI$50,000\u2013SI$1 million ($6,200\u2013\n$123,700) with a maximum term of 5 years, and up to a maximum guaranteed amount of SI$300,000 \n($37,100) per loan. Previously, it covered 80% of the unsecured portion of bank loans of SI$5,000\u2013SI$250,000 \n($600\u2013$30,900). Only commercial banks are eligible to participate. Finance companies are excluded. Loans for \nbusiness development in all sectors are eligible, with an emphasis on SMEs involved with rural or export business \nventures. Loans to individuals, companies, and cooperatives are eligible. The scheme focuses on business \nexpansion, although start-ups do not appear to be excluded. A flat fee of 1% of the loan principal is charged.\n\nIndividual loans are nominated by the commercial banks for inclusion in the scheme, and a separate guarantee \nagreement is entered into between the commercial bank and CBSI for each guaranteed loan. In the case of \ndefault, the bank must use its usual recovery procedures. The bank is expected to initiate legal action, and only \nafter the loan remains in default for more than 90 days after a court judgment has been obtained can the bank \nsubmit a claim to CBSI.\n\nCBSI reports that 59 loans were approved for inclusion under the scheme from 2008 to 2013. As at end \nDecember 2012, 55 loans had been approved, of which 36 were current (65%), 9 had defaulted and had \nclaims paid out to banks (16%), and 10 loans had been fully repaid and the guarantee cleared (18%). As at end \nDecember 2012, the net guaranteed portfolio was SI$3.95 million ($490,000), equivalent to a guaranteed \nresidual amount of about SI$110,000 ($13,600) per current loan.\n\nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands.

Institutions included Papua New \nGuinea Banking Corporation, Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, and Bank \nSouth Pacific. It provided coverage of 80% of principal and interest. It covered individual loans of up \nto K50,000 and group/company/joint venture loans from K50,000 to K200,000 provided there were \nat least to five national shareholders. A lack of budgetary support from the government and delays \nin payment of claims resulted in a lack of trust between the banks and the government. According to \nKavanamur, the Department of Treasury accused banks of failing to properly monitor and supervise \nloans under the scheme, and of calling upon the guarantee without fully exhausting loan recovery \nprocesses.\n\nSource: D.

Guarantee funds were placed \non term deposit with the participating financial institutions. According to a paper by David Kavanamur \nfrom 2003, the actual number of loans disbursed under the scheme was no more than 30, the default \nrate was high, and participating institutions simply called on the guarantee without exhausting loan \nrecovery processes. The banks were found to be very risk-averse, despite often facing no principal risk, \nwhile SBDC lacked the resources and expertise to support an effective scheme.\n\nSource: D. Kavanamur. 2003.

These reforms have \nunlocked the value in \u201cmovable\u201d assets such as machinery, inventory, and accounts receivable for use as \ncollateral in borrowing. They have the potential to benefit businesses and financial institutions that offer \nbusiness loans.\n\nYet, despite these reforms, financial institutions remain unwilling to lend. Businesses still find it hard to access \nthe credit they need to grow, which in turn creates jobs and drives the economic activity so desperately \nneeded in the Pacific. Credit guarantees are often proposed as an instrument to overcome this problem. \nHowever, as this publication demonstrates, there is no strong theoretical justification for their use.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to half of the world\u2019s extreme poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nCREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE  \nIN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN \nIMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n", "\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
