These reforms have \nunlocked the value in \u201cmovable\u201d assets such as machinery, inventory, and accounts receivable for use as \ncollateral in borrowing. They have the potential to benefit businesses and financial institutions that offer \nbusiness loans.\nYet, despite these reforms, financial institutions remain unwilling to lend. Businesses still find it hard to access \nthe credit they need to grow, which in turn creates jobs and drives the economic activity so desperately \nneeded in the Pacific. Credit guarantees are often proposed as an instrument to overcome this problem. \nHowever, as this publication demonstrates, there is no strong theoretical justification for their use.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to half of the world\u2019s extreme poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\nCREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE  \nIN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nwww.adb.org", "CREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE IN \nIMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK", "  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n\u00a9 2016 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\nSome rights reserved.

It was \nestablished in 2012. Its objective is to promote and develop the local business industry, improve private sector lending \nto SMEs, and stimulate growth. The government has allocated F$4 million ($1.9 million) seed capital through the \nnational budget, with an additional allocation of F$1.5 million ($0.7 million) in the 2016 National Budget.\nThe guarantee scheme applies to all new loans to SMEs by financial institutions (including commercial banks, licensed \ncredit institutions, and the Fiji Development Bank) after 1 January 2012, subject to an interest rate cap (of 10% per \nannum) and eligibility criteria (all SMEs excluding the sugar cane industry, government-subsidized businesses, and \nproperty investment). Small enterprises are defined as those with turnover or total assets between F$30,000\u2013\nF$100,000 ($14,100\u2013$46,900) and 6\u201320 employees.

It is funded by the Government of PNG (through IDA \ncredit) and the IFC, and is administered by the IFC. In addition to the RSF, the World Bank project \nprovides technical assistance to borrowers, financial institutions, and the government\u2019s Department of \nCommerce and Industry. The project aims to encourage commercial banks and finance companies to \nexpand lending and leasing finance to SMEs.\nThe RSF guarantees 50% of principal losses in portfolios of new eligible SME loans by participating \nfinancial institutions.

First-loss cover of 10% is provided through IDA funding, and \nsecond-loss cover of 40% by IFC (i.e., while IFC pays participating financial institutions up to 50% of \nprincipal losses in the portfolio, the first 10% of principal losses in the portfolio will be reimbursed to IFC \nby IDA). Participating financial institutions are charged an undisclosed commercial guarantee fee by \nIFC. BSP is now the only participating financial institution. Other financial institutions may join, subject \nto due diligence and performance criteria. The World Bank\u2019s design documents state that loans to both \nexisting businesses and start-ups are eligible, but BSP has stated that the facility will only cover loans for \nthe expansion of existing businesses, not new business start-ups.\nAt design, it was estimated that the total size of the RSF would be K300 million (now $100 million). \nBSP was allocated 50%, whereby its covered portfolio could grow to K150 million ($50 million), with the \nremainder to be allocated to other financial institutions.\nBSP\u2019s committed RSF portfolio totaled K25 million ($8.4 million) and 231 loans at end September 2013; \nK43\u00a0million ($14.4 million) and 653 loans at end June 2014; and K51 million ($17.1 million) and 1,304 loans at \nend June 2015. \nIn July 2013, BSP announced that it had made SME loans and advances covered by the RSF of around \nK16 million ($6 million), compared with BSP\u2019s overall lending to SMEs in excess of K480 million \n($178.9\u00a0million).

Three risk-sharing agreements have been signed and implemented \nas of end 2015. The fourth risk-sharing agreement is expected to be signed by early 2016.\nIt is too early to draw lessons from the RSF. However, it is noted that the operating model relies on \nthe services of a contracted fund manager. This overcomes potential issues around implementation \ncapacity, but will cost an estimated $1.4 million in management fees over a 5-year period, drawn from the \nADB loan.

It was \nestablished in 1995 with seed funding from the New Zealand Aid Programme (ST600,000; $231,200) and \nexpanded in 2002 through an ADB loan to the Government of Samoa for the Small Business Development \nProject (ST9 million; $3.5 million). Its objective is to facilitate access to finance for small businesses that lack \nthe collateral required for loans. The scheme covers individual loans up to ST50,000 ($19,300) to businesses \nby the Development Bank of Samoa and all four commercial banks in Samoa. It typically guarantees up to \n80% of the loan principal, while borrowers are required to secure a private guarantee or put up a term deposit \nto cover the remaining 20%. For loans of up to ST10,000 ($3,900) a 100% loan guarantee is offered. The \nSBEC plays a significant role in loan origination, appraisal, and monitoring. Loans are granted for starting \ncapital for new businesses and for working capital for existing businesses.\nADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department reviewed the scheme in 2011. It found that 838 guarantees were \nissued from 2002 to 2008 for ST11.6 million ($4.5 million) covering loans totaling ST15.8 million ($6.1 million). \nThe average loan value was ST18,850 ($7,300). As of 30 September 2010, 6% of guarantees had been paid \nout. A further 33% of current loans were in arrears, with arrears representing 8.5% of current loan balances \n(note: part of principal in arrears only, not total principal of loans in arrears). It conducted a survey of 100 \nrecipients of guaranteed loans, and found that 93% of sample businesses were sole proprietors. The survey \nalso found that 39% of sample businesses were engaged in services; 38% in commerce, trade, or retail; 11% in \nmanufacturing; and 2% in fishing.\nIn 2011, the SBEC reported that a total of 1,377 guarantees had been issued for ST16.4 million ($6.3\u00a0million) \ncovering loans totaling ST22.5 million ($8.7 million). Foreclosures amounted to ST2.1\u00a0million ($0.8 million) \nand ST6.1 million ($2.4 million) of guarantees was cleared, leaving ST8.2 million ($3.2 million) in guarantees \noutstanding. 1% of guarantees were issued for loans of <ST5,000 (<$1,900); 61% for loans of ST5,000\u2013\nST20,000 ($1,900\u2013$7,700); 38% for loans of >ST20,000 (>$7,700).\nADB\u2019s evaluation in 2011 found that the scheme had some success in increasing access to finance for target \nbusinesses. However, there had been insufficient incentive for the banks to be diligent in loan appraisal, \nmonitoring, and collection, given the high coverage ratio and reliance on SBEC for loan appraisal and \nmonitoring. This created moral hazard and resulted in a high level of arrears and foreclosures. Further, delays in \npayments of claims on the guarantee due to complex processes reduced bank interest in the scheme.\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ANZ = Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited.\nSources: ADB. 2011.

Previously, it covered 80% of the unsecured portion of bank loans of SI$5,000\u2013SI$250,000 \n($600\u2013$30,900). Only commercial banks are eligible to participate. Finance companies are excluded. Loans for \nbusiness development in all sectors are eligible, with an emphasis on SMEs involved with rural or export business \nventures. Loans to individuals, companies, and cooperatives are eligible. The scheme focuses on business \nexpansion, although start-ups do not appear to be excluded. A flat fee of 1% of the loan principal is charged.\nIndividual loans are nominated by the commercial banks for inclusion in the scheme, and a separate guarantee \nagreement is entered into between the commercial bank and CBSI for each guaranteed loan. In the case of \ndefault, the bank must use its usual recovery procedures. The bank is expected to initiate legal action, and only \nafter the loan remains in default for more than 90 days after a court judgment has been obtained can the bank \nsubmit a claim to CBSI.\nCBSI reports that 59 loans were approved for inclusion under the scheme from 2008 to 2013. As at end \nDecember 2012, 55 loans had been approved, of which 36 were current (65%), 9 had defaulted and had \nclaims paid out to banks (16%), and 10 loans had been fully repaid and the guarantee cleared (18%). As at end \nDecember 2012, the net guaranteed portfolio was SI$3.95 million ($490,000), equivalent to a guaranteed \nresidual amount of about SI$110,000 ($13,600) per current loan.\nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands.

Institutions included Papua New \nGuinea Banking Corporation, Westpac, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, and Bank \nSouth Pacific. It provided coverage of 80% of principal and interest. It covered individual loans of up \nto K50,000 and group/company/joint venture loans from K50,000 to K200,000 provided there were \nat least to five national shareholders. A lack of budgetary support from the government and delays \nin payment of claims resulted in a lack of trust between the banks and the government. According to \nKavanamur, the Department of Treasury accused banks of failing to properly monitor and supervise \nloans under the scheme, and of calling upon the guarantee without fully exhausting loan recovery \nprocesses.\nSource: D.

Coverage ranged from 50% to 100% of principal of loans from K1,000 \nto K100,000 (then $780\u2013$77,000) by participating financial institutions. Guarantee funds were placed \non term deposit with the participating financial institutions. According to a paper by David Kavanamur \nfrom 2003, the actual number of loans disbursed under the scheme was no more than 30, the default \nrate was high, and participating institutions simply called on the guarantee without exhausting loan \nrecovery processes. The banks were found to be very risk-averse, despite often facing no principal risk, \nwhile SBDC lacked the resources and expertise to support an effective scheme.\nSource: D. Kavanamur. 2003.

These reforms have \nunlocked the value in \u201cmovable\u201d assets such as machinery, inventory, and accounts receivable for use as \ncollateral in borrowing. They have the potential to benefit businesses and financial institutions that offer \nbusiness loans.\nYet, despite these reforms, financial institutions remain unwilling to lend. Businesses still find it hard to access \nthe credit they need to grow, which in turn creates jobs and drives the economic activity so desperately \nneeded in the Pacific. Credit guarantees are often proposed as an instrument to overcome this problem. \nHowever, as this publication demonstrates, there is no strong theoretical justification for their use.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to half of the world\u2019s extreme poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\nCREDIT GUARANTEES\nCHALLENGING THEIR ROLE  \nIN IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE  \nIN THE PACIFIC REGION\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\nwww.adb.org"], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20160915113523+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "; Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative; Secured transaction reform; Credit guarantees; Movable assets; Pacific island finance sector; Pacific island commercial banking; Pacific island banking reform; Trade credit; Pacific island landing; Access to credit", "ModDate": "D:20161025151331+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "Despite adequate liquidity, commercial banks in the Pacific are often reluctant to extend business credit, which is a serious constraint to business operations and broader economic development.", "Title": "Credit guarantees: Challenging their role in improving access to finance in the Pacific region.", "Trapped": "False"}}
