The most important and critical segments of this reform were trade and foreign \ninvestment.  India  has  felt  the  impact  of  globalization  through  increased  prosperity,  partly \ntriggered by increasing trade volumes, investment, and growth. The theme of this article is to \nmake readers aware of the impact of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) \non climate change with special reference to India\u2019s economy.  \n \nScholarly work on trade, FDI, and the environment in India with rich theoretical insight and \nsolid  empirical  evidence  is  scarce.  However,  there  is  a  good  amount  of  work  on  general \nenvironmental  issues.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  trade  liberalization  has  not  directly  or \nsubstantially affected carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, it has probably had greater \neffects through its impact on gross domestic product (GDP). In other words, we impress upon \nreaders that the direct impact of trade and FDI on environmental conditions is less of an issue \nimpact  on  GDP  growth  \ncompared  with \nand resultant prosperity. We also emphasize that enforcing regulations is a complex task given \ncorruption,  informal  markets,  and  the  inability  of  citizens  to  cooperate  and  form  effective \nlobbies.  \n \nPreliminary  calculations  using  data  from  the  World  Bank  show  that  GDP  has  a  direct, \nproportional relationship with the extent of CO2 emissions in India, and the relationship is even \nstronger after the introduction of the liberalization policy in the 1990s. However, trade seems \nto have an inversely proportional relationship, consistent with the view that Indian imports are \nmostly manufactured items that may involve polluting production process and are currently \nbeing produced outside India. \n \nWe believe more specific research is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of \npatterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better scientific \nmeasures of the damage and impact of climate change and its effect on inequality. Clearly, \nwarmer regions around the globe, including India and many developing Asian countries, will \nbe  affected  more  than  their  northern  counterparts  due  to  global  warming.  In  fact,  recent \nestimates show that climate change has increased inequality in the United States between the \nnorth and the south. Patterns of production are generally induced by the conditions of global \ntrade and investment and by physical infrastructural support and local resources. India and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the two largest countries in Asia, have very different \nGDP  compositions.  This  poses  the  question  of  whether  excessive  industrialization  coupled \nwith the usual transboundary and climate concerns make the PRC more vulnerable than India, \nwhich thrives on service sector growth and in turn benefits from the low pollution content of \ngrowth.  This  also  calls  for  serious  exploration  of  green  accounting  and  the  preparation  of \ndatabases with better environmental indicators. \n \nIt will be worthwhile to explore the effect of liberalization on other climatic aspects, such as \nwater  pollution  and  land  salinity,  with  the  help  of  large  scientific  databases.  But  the  fact \nremains that only through trade can countries replace the local production of pollution intensive \ngoods with imports and reduce CO2 emissions. Countries that can replace the production of \npollution intensive goods by imports will reduce CO2 emissions on this count. The growth effect, \nhowever,  will  go  the  other  way.  Countries  with  different  trade  patterns  may  suffer  on  both \ncounts. India is possibly a mixed case and more detailed analysis is needed to examine the \nhypothesis. \n \nKeywords: international trade, FDI, environment, corruption, informal economy \n \nJEL Classification: F18, F21, F64, D73, F26\n\n \n\n\fMarjit and Yu \n\nADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nContents \n \n \n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................................................... 1 \n\n2. \n\nTHEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE ................................................................................. 5 \n\n2.1 \n2.2 \n\nResearch on Trade and Environment............................................................ 10 \nResearch on Trade and Environment on India .............................................. 11 \n\n3. \n\nPROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL:  \nENDURING AND CONTEMPORARY POLICY ISSUES .......................................... 14 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n\nSelective Global Research on Climate Change ............................................ 15 \nIndian Literature on Climate Change ............................................................. 17 \n\n4. \n\nGOVERNMENT OF INDIA POLICIES ....................................................................... 20 \n\n4.1 \n\nIndian Initiatives for Climate Protection ......................................................... 20 \n\n5. \n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS........................................................................................ 21 \n\nREFERENCES ..................................................................................................................... 23 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nIndia embarked on a path of liberal economic reform in the 1990s after years of nurturing \nan intensively regulated and controlled economic environment that was loosened a bit in \nthe  mid-1980s.  Now  it  is  well  recognized  that  such  a  sea  change  in  policy  has  led  to \nimpressive  achievements  in  many  sectors  of  the  economy.  The  most  important  and \ncritical  segment  of  this  reform  has  been  trade  and  foreign  investment,  including \nderegulations in the well-known industrial licensing system. The theme of this chapter is \nto make readers aware of the relevant work on climate change and the impact of trade \nand  environment  on  climate  change  with  special  reference  to  India\u2019s  economy.  The \nimpact  of  globalization  on  India  has  been  felt  in  terms  of  increasing  prosperity,  partly \ntriggered by increasing volume of trade, investment, and growth.  \n\nA  cursory  look  at  the  evidence  suggests  that  the  conventional  openness  index, \nrepresented by the ratio of volume of trade to gross domestic product (GDP), increased \nsubstantially from a little over 10% in the 1990s to almost 50% in recent times. Average \ntariff rates came down drastically, leading to greater imports and exports. The foreign \ndirect  investment  (FDI)  flows  also  started  recording  impressive  levels  over  the  next  \ntwo decades. Trade and FDI in the Indian context are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. Per \n emissions have also increased in \ncapita energy consumption and carbon dioxide (\nthe post-reform period, as suggested in Figures 3 and 4; Figure 5 depicts India\u2019s GDP \ngrowth. However, as Figures 6 and 7 show, India\u2019s per capita consumption of energy \n emissions are both way below the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the \nand \nUnited States (US). \n\nCO2)\n\nCO2\n\nFigure 1: FDI, Trade, and CO2 Emissions in India \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nFigure 2.1: Trade Openness after Liberalization \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n\nFigure 2.2: Exports and Imports  \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n\nFigure 3: Energy Utilization in India  \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nFigure 4: CO2 Emissions in India after Liberalization \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n\nFigure 5: GDP Growth of Indian Economy, 1990\u20132016 \n\nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n\nFigure 6: Per Capita CO2 Emission in Selective Countries \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNote:  Bubble  width  indicates  total  emissions  between  1970  and  2014  for  the  respective  countries, \nindicated alongside the bubbles. \n\nSource: Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 (Government of India). \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nFigure 7: CO2 Emission from Different Sectors \n\nSource: Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 (Government of India). \n\n \n\nThe effects of trade and FDI, though mixed and different, are felt on growth in GDP. India \nhas jumped ahead of nations, breaking the taboo of the so-called historic \u201cHindu\u201d rate of \ngrowth of 3% per annum, averaging around 8% per annum (India\u2019s GDP growth rate in \nthe post-reform period is shown in Figure 5). \n\nIn spite of the major financial crises and crashes of 1997 and 2008, India has remained \na close second to the PRC and is currently growing at a commendable rate. After the \nhistoric demonetization episode in November 2016, when about 86% of currency was \nwithdrawn from circulation to control black market transactions and illegal liquidity, the \ngrowth rate has faltered a little. The recent work on global fiscal policy and inequality by \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  (Clements  et  al.  2015)  confirms  the  claim  that \nmillions of people have been lifted above the poverty line thanks to the historic switch to \na regime of liberal economic policies. Interestingly, while the degree of inequality in the \n2000s  shows  a  moderately  increased  level  relative  to  the  1980s,  the  increment  is  far \nlower than in the PRC and the increase itself is definitely on the lower side if compared \nwith the world average during the relevant period. \n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  it  is  hard  to  be  too  concerned  about  the  direct  environmental \nconsequences of more open trade and investment regimes. It is also extremely difficult \nto isolate effects that are exclusively due to liberal trade policies and quite independent \nof  the  growth  effect.  The  real  need  is  to  analyze  the  problems  at  various  levels  by \nfocusing  on  the  effects  of  a  significant  change  in  the  growth  regime,  reflecting  the \nincreasing level of prosperity, which has definitely been impacted by liberal trade policies. \nThe pattern of trade should itself have some effect on environmental elements such as \nfossil fuels, renewable energy, carbon emissions, etc. Further to this effect, one should \nworry about overall climate change, food supply, and food security. It is also important \nto  understand  the  pattern  of  India\u2019s  trade  and  investment  that  has  characterized  its \ngrowth path over the last few decades. On the one hand, trade and investment policies \nmay  directly  regulate  environmental  damage  and  affect  optimal  utilization  of  natural \nresources.  On  the  other  hand,  any  kind  of  regulatory  policy  or  its  emergence  will  be \nguided  by  several  critical  factors  involving  awareness,  political  lobbies,  strategic \nreactions,  and  the  massive  size  of  the  informal  sector.  Coupled  with  this,  India\u2019s \nparticipation in global policy making to control transboundary pollution, climate change, \n emission-related  factors  will  be  also  important.  We  reflect  on  all  of  these  as \nand \nmuch as possible given the limited length of the chapter. The main point of this chapter \n\nCO2\n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nis  to  argue  that,  by  global  standards,  India\u2019s  performance  has  not  been  particularly \nworrisome.  Liberal  trade  policies  and  market  integration  have  contributed  to  growth, \nresulting in pressure on the use of natural resources. However, poor regulatory control \nhas  created  sporadic  natural  and  national  disasters  in  tandem  with  factors  that  are \naffected by global warming. It is this problem of implementing regulations that requires \nspecial attention.  \n\nThere are certain global issues which involve transboundary concerns and India cannot \nbe  insulated  from  those  concerns.  Globalization  and  the  environment  in  India  are \ndependent in part on global climatic conditions and the policies of the other countries, as \none cannot ignore global negative externalities. These will be related to the policies with \nwhich the Indian government has been engaged. In this introductory section, we highlight \nresearch  on  climate  change  at  the  global  level  and  emerging  problems  that  require \nattention. We reflect upon some of these issues in the policy section. \n\nIn  the  second  section of  the  chapter,  we  discuss  the  theoretical  implications,  drawing \nfrom various contributions in the sphere of environmental regulations. In the third section, \nwe provide a panoramic view of the available academic literature on the impact of trade \non  the  environment  in  general  and  on  India  specifically,  mainly  from  an  empirical \nperspective. The fourth section highlights the global research on climate change and the \nIndian counterpart. The fifth section briefly addresses the policy strategies of the Indian \ngovernment.  The  concluding  section  will  highlight  issues  that  require  further  attention \nand  link  India\u2019s  concerns  with  the  greater  Asian  perspective  before  providing  some \nconcluding remarks. \n\n2.  THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE \n\nTrade  and  FDI-impacted  prosperity  may  potentially  have  severe,  but  sporadic, \nenvironmental  consequences,  along  with  silent  erosion  of  ecological  surroundings. \nHowever, a look at the destination of trade and FDI in various sectors shows a relatively \nbenign picture (Kar and Majumdar 2016). It is very difficult to suggest that trade and FDI \nwere singularly important in terms of environmental damage. \n\nThe  expansion  of  tourism,  an  appetite  for  real  estate  investments,  and  prosperity-led \ndemand for the construction sector can lead to excessive use of land-based resources, \ngiving rise to catastrophic events. Agriculture, with increasing use of chemical fertilizers \nand pesticides, has long affected the soil condition; however, it is very difficult to identify \nand isolate the role of trade in such a malady. India has suffered, and will continue to \nsuffer, since the regulatory framework may not function properly for institutional reasons. \nIt is generally the case that if we give up industries that generate pollution in the process \nof production and import the underlying products as trade opens up, we reduce the extent \nof environmental damage. On the other hand, if our export good has significant pollution \ncontent,  the  result  is  exactly  reversed;  given  that  India\u2019s  trade  pattern  is  not \nmanufacturing  intensive,  it  may  not  have  suffered  from  this  aspect  of  the  problem. \nHowever, the pressure of growth and prosperity on the informal sector, weak and corrupt \ninstitutional  structure,  and  social  neglect  may  have  severely  impacted  the  ability  to \nregulate  or  control  environmental  damage.  Theoretical  and  empirical  research  on  the \nproblem of such regulatory control in the context of the informal sector has been amply \ndemonstrated in Biswas, Farzanegan, and Thum (2012) and Biswas and Thum (2017). \nThe problem of regulation with a huge informal sector has been discussed in detail in \nMarjit, Ghosh, and Biswas (2007), Marjit and Kar (2011, 2012), etc. The basic idea is as \nfollows. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fMarjit and Yu \n\nADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nConsider \ntrade \n\n, with  \n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)\n\n \n\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\n\n\u2032\n\n(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47) > 0\n\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4c\n fraction  of \n\n as  the  level  of  GDP.

This  constitutes  a  major  problem  for  the \ngovernment, as the majority of the workforce is engaged in the informal sector, with no \nexception across the entire developing world. As has been elaborated in Marjit and Kar \n(2011),  this  is  the  stark  reality  for  India.  Critical  policies  have  been  discussed  in  the \ncontext of the labor market by Marjit (2003); Marjit, Kar, and Acharyya (2007); Marjit and \nKar (2012); Acharyya and Kar (2014), etc. focusing on interaction between the formal \nand informal sectors. However, such a general equilibrium exercise is rare in the context \nof environmental regulations.  \n\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\n\nTypically,  the  political  concern  seems  to  be  that  environmental  regulations  tend  to \ndepress  employment  and  wages  and  so  are  difficult  to  implement  in  democracies. \nHowever, movement of capital between formal and informal sectors, coupled with the \ninability  of  the  government  to  push  through  regulations  in  the  informal  sector,  may \nactually  prove  to  be  helpful  to  the  informal  workers  by  raising  wages.  We  provide  a \ntheoretical example drawn primarily from Marjit (2003) and Marjit and Kar (2011).  \n\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39,\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\n\n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ufffd > \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\n\n The  rest, \n\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc341\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\n\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc421\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc341\n\n,  are  hired  in  the  informal  sector  at  wage \n\nFigure 8 describes a situation where \n is hired in the formal sector with a fixed \n, \nunionized  wage \n)  are  demand  for  labor  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors \n.

The  above  example  is  based  on  the \nassumption that the informal sector produces a final good: the result will change when \nthe informal sector produces an intermediate good for the formal sector.

Economic  growth \n\nLet us move from production-related environmental concern to the problem of regulation \nin \ntrade  or  \nFDI-related prosperity often leads to excessive use of natural resources. Examples in \nIndia  are  abundant  where  the  expanding  real  estate  and  construction  business  often \nencroach upon water bodies on the one hand and lead to excessive local demand for \nwater on the other, pushing the water level further down. Lack of cooperative effort on \nthe part of citizen users for the renovation of water bodies, cleaning, dredging, etc. leads \nto  suboptimal  public  investment  in  critical  areas  of  consumption,  as  lobbying  is \ninadequate. A few years ago, in Northern India, a massive landslide caused by torrential \nrain feeding a mountain river led to a huge loss of prosperity and human lives (Kala 2014; \nSingh  et  al.  2016).  Everyone  could  see  the  problem  of  construction  of  cheap  hotels \nacross river banks that crippled the soil base and made it vulnerable to natural disaster. \nExcessive use of groundwater in India has led to serious arsenic-related diseases. This \nhas  been  documented  time  and  again  (Das  et  al.  1994).  These  point  to  an  inevitable \nfallout of excessive demand on natural resources, a hallmark of a fast-growing economy. \nIt  is  well  known  that  energy-intensive  consumption  activities  during  winter  perennially \naffect the PRC and its overuse of coal-based resources. (The National Development and \nReform Commission of the PRC said in its annual report that it would implement policies \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\naimed  at  reducing  coal  consumption  and  controlling  the  number  of  energy-intensive \nprojects in polluted regions, Aizhu et al. 2015).  \n\nThe problem arises at three levels.  \n\nFirst, the regulation priorities of the government can be lopsided, being dependent on \nthe electoral policies and economic performance of the political regime. For example, if \ntrade and FDI stimulate growth and growth relates to ecological problems at the local, \nregional, or national level, governments may not stir unless natural and national disasters \noccur through floods, droughts, landslides, etc.  \n\nSecond, people may not consider environmental degradation as a quality of life issue  \nin  a  poor  country.  While  growth  and  affluence  slowly  make  an  impact,  public \nconsciousness in this regard may turn out to be too shallow and non-existent. The recent \npolicy drive by the Indian government, known as the Clear India (Swatch Bharat) mission, \nis  an  endeavor  that  has  created  millions  of  toilets.  This  speaks  loudly  of  a  chronic \nproblem of defecation-induced health hazards and a lack of awareness among people. \nInternational trade, FDI, and other growth-augmenting avenues have very little to deliver \nin that respect, as prosperity and social awareness may not go hand in hand. \n\nThird,  lack  of  cooperation  in  public  good-related  initiatives  among  affluent  citizens  to \nresolve local problems of excessive exploitation of natural resources makes the problem \neven more complex. \n\nThe  latter  problem  can  be  related  to  a  simple  theoretical  structure.

Later, we \nreflect on the Indian scenario. \n\nNeumayer  (2000)  critically  assesses  three  ways  in  which  trade  might  harm  the \nenvironment.  First,  trade  liberalization  might  exacerbate  existing  levels  of  resource \ndepletion and environmental pollution; second, open borders might allow companies to \nmigrate  to  \u201cpollution  havens,\u201d  thus  undermining  high  environmental  standards  in  host \ncountries;  and  third,  the  dispute  settlement  system  of  the  World  Trade  Organization \n(WTO) might favor trade over environmental interests in case of conflict. It is shown that \nwhile trade liberalization can lead to an increase in environmental degradation, pollution \nhavens are not a statistically significant phenomenon.  \n\nCopeland and Taylor (2001) draw quite heavily from trade theory but develop a simple \npollution  demand  and  supply  system  featuring  marginal  abatement  cost  and  marginal \ndamage schedules familiar to environmental economists. They use a simple model to \nfacilitate extensions examining the environmental consequences of growth, the impact \nof trade liberalization, and strategic interaction between countries. One could also refer \nto Antweiler et al. (2001) in this context. \n\nChen  and  Woodland  (2013)  analyze  non-cooperative  environmental  policies  and \ninvestigate  whether  trade  undermines  the  effectiveness  of  unilateral  environmental \npolicies,  in  which  carbon  leakage  and  international  competitiveness  are  of  particular \nimportance.  They  review  the  interactions  between  trade  and  environmental  policies, \nborder  tax  adjustment  policies,  and  the  role  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  in \ncombating climate change arising from economic activities.  \n\nDellink, Hwang, Lanzi, and Chateau (2017), by building on the analysis in the OECD\u2019s \n2015  report,  The  Economic  Consequences  of  Climate  Change,  present  a  plausible \nscenario of future socioeconomic developments and climate damage to shed light on the \nmechanisms at work in explaining how climate change will affect trade.  \n\nSauvage  and  Timiliotis  (2017)  discuss  international  trade  in  environmental-related \nservices.  By  lowering  the  costs  of  these  services  and  improving  access  to  suppliers, \ntrade policy can contribute, alongside energy and environmental policy, to the prevention \nand abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in all its forms.  \n\nReaders  can  also  consult  Beghin  et  al.  (1994),  Sturm  (2003),  and  Dupuy  (2012)  for \nadditional references in this area. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\n2.2  Research on Trade and Environment on India \n\nIndia\u2019s  trade  is  typically  dominated  by  the  service  sector,  agriculture,  oil,  industrial \ncomponents,  gems  and  jewelry,  etc.  The  fact  that  wage  inequality  has  been  on  the  \nrise  in  the  country  for  quite  some  time  indicates  an  ever-growing  premium  for  \nhuman  capital,  in  particular  in  the  information  technology-led  sectors  (Marjit  and \nAcharyya 2003, 2009). India\u2019s weak link seems to be manufacturing. While the service \nsector  commands  about  60%  of  GDP,  manufacturing  contributes  only  around  25%. \nHistorically,  over  the  last  few  decades  since  reform,  India\u2019s  tradition  is  exactly  the \nopposite to the PRC\u2019s if we look at the composition of GDP. A simple exercise to trace \n emissions  has  been  attempted  in  terms  of \nthe  impact  of  trade,  FDI,  and  GDP  on \neconometric analysis. \n\nScholarly  work  on  trade,  FDI,  and  the  environment  in  India  that  offers  rich  theoretical \ninsights  and  solid  empirical  evidence  is  scarce,  although  there  is  a  good  body  of  \nwork on general environmental issues, some of which we summarize in the next section, \nalong  with  the  general  literature  on  climate  change  from  science,  technology,  and \neconomic  perspectives.  We  first  consider  an  empirical  exercise  on  the  relationship \n emissions,  growth,  trade,  and  FDI  in  India,  specifically  to  \nbetween  overall \nshow  that  it  is  more  GDP-led  prosperity  than  trade  and  FDI  that  has  led  to  a  growth  \nin emissions. \n\nCO2\n\nCO2\n\nTo  understand  the  effect  of  liberalization  on  the  extent  of  carbon  emission  in  India  in \nforms  of  a  very  simple  rudimentary  framework,  we  regress \n emissions  on  three \nvariables:  GDP  per  capita,  trade  per  capita,  and  FDI  per  capita.  However,  our \n emissions; \nexplanatory variables might not have an immediate effect on the level of \ntherefore, lagged explanatory variables might be appropriate.

This implies that the Indian economy has grown \non the extent of \nat  the  cost  of  environmental  degradation.  The  relationship  between  trade  and \nemissions  seems  to  be  inversely  proportional,  implying  that,  holding  other  factors \nemission has gone down. As an educated guess, we \n\nCO2\n\nconstant, with increased trade \nCO2\n\nCO2\n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nmay propose that Indian imports are mostly manufactured items, which may involve a \npolluting production process, and are being produced outside India. On the other hand, \ndue  to  the  import  of  these  manufacturing  items,  the  polluting  import  substitution \nmanufacturing is being closed down, possibly resulting in lower pollution in India due to \nimports.  Furthermore,  Indian  exports,  though  they  have  manufacturing  content,  also \ncomprise  growing  IT  service-oriented  activities,  which  are  almost  without  pollution. \nHence trade helps India to reduce pollution, as reflected in the negative relationship in \nour estimated equation. Like GDP, FDI is found to positively, though rather insignificantly, \nemission  in  India.  The  FDI  result  echoes  the  work  of  Acharyya  (2009), \ninfluence \nwhich we discuss later. \nCO2\n\nNow, we all know the Indian economy was opened to the rest of world in 1991 through \nthe process of liberalization. This is expected to have had some impact on pollution. After \nliberalization,  GDP,  trade,  and  FDI  all  rose  for  the  Indian  economy.  We  need  \nto ascertain whether pollution in India has increased due to liberalization.

However, there is no statistically significant shift in the slope or \nrate of increase/decrease of pollution due to trade after the liberalization policy came into \nCO2\nforce in India.  \n\nAcharyya  (2009)  provides  an  early  analysis  of  the  impact  of  FDI  on  the  environment, \nwhere  it  is  demonstrated  that  FDI  inflow  in  the  1990s  had  a  quite  large  positive  \nimpact  on \n emissions  through  output  growth,  and  FDI  had  a  positive  but  marginal \nimpact on growth. The two together imply that growth must have a very high emission \n\nCO2\n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nelasticity. This, in a way, may contradict the observations of Wei and Smarzynska (1999) \nand Hassaballa (2013) regarding the developing world and pollution havens, as reported \nin Kar and Majumdar (2016).  \n\nPapers by Kar and Majumdar (2016) have made a serious attempt to reflect on trade \nand  technology  policies  with  reference  to  the  developing  world  and  with  a  special \nemphasis on India. Before we discuss these papers, it is important to note that the better \nenvironmental standards are usually dependent on internal policies rather than on trade \nand FDI-related policies. However, the impact of market integration on the environment \nmay require trade-specific policies. Coupled with such policies, one needs to seriously \nfocus on abatement technology. Continuous upgrading of technology through diffusion \nand interlinkage across the value chain can have a profound, albeit invisible, impact on \nemission standards.  \n\nKar  and  Majumdar  (2016)  show  that  for  a  group  of  low-middle-income  countries  and \nsorted  on  the  basis  of  manufacturing  to  trade  ratios,  of  which  India  is  a  prominent \nmember,  a  rise  in  MFN  (most  favored  nation)  tariff  rates  reduces  CO2  emissions,  \nand  that  effect  is  further  reinforced  if  FDI  flows  to  non-polluting  sectors  such  as \nagriculture.  A  rise  in  MFN  tariff  rates  takes  care  of  the  trade  diversion  problem.  \nThe  paper  rigorously  demonstrates  that  further  protection  may  actually  help  lower \nemission standards. For agriculture, substitution of imports by FDI has a better effect on \nemissions.  \n\nMajumdar and Kar (2017) study the emission intensity of fifteen organized manufacturing \nand agricultural sectors in India and find the relationship between technology adoption \nand emission intensity at the industry level over 1996\u20132009. They show that when better \ntechnologies \ngoods  \nthe \nas  opposed  to  non-traded  goods,  emissions  fall  in  a  significant  way.  Typically, \ninternational  trade  and  FDI  facilitate  the  adoption  of  technology.  The  direct  effect  of \nglobalization might therefore have helped in this regard. \n\nproduction \n\nadopted \n\nexport \n\nare \n\nfor \n\nof \n\n3.  PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE GLOBAL \n\nLEVEL: ENDURING AND CONTEMPORARY  \nPOLICY ISSUES \n\nClimate  change  is  a  complex  problem  which,  though  environmental  in  nature,  has \nconsequences for all spheres of existence on our planet. It either impacts, or is impacted \nby,  global  issues,  including  poverty,  economic  development,  population  growth, \nsustainable  development,  and  resource  management.  Climate  change  is  a  global \nchallenge  and  requires  a  global  solution.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  have  the  same \nimpact  on  the  atmosphere  whether  they  originate  in  Washington,  London,  or  Beijing. \nConsequently, action by one country to reduce emissions will do little to reduce global \nwarming unless other countries act as well. Ultimately, an effective strategy will require \ncommitment and action from all the major emitting countries. Climate change poses the \nserious challenge of carbon dioxide emission reduction. Emission control by developing \ncountries  is  becoming  key  for  the  effective  mitigation  of  climate  change,  as  those \ncountries now account for more than a half of global emissions and are still expanding \ntheir energy infrastructure.  \n\nAt the very heart of the response to climate change, however, lies the need to reduce \nemissions.  In  2010,  governments  agreed  that  emissions  need  to  be  reduced  so  that \nglobal temperature increases are limited to below two degrees Celsius. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nIn  1992,  countries  joined  an  international  treaty,  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to consider what they could do to limit global \ntemperature \nto  cope  with  \nits  impacts.  By  1995,  countries  realized  that  emission  reduction  provisions  in  the \nConvention were inadequate. As a result, they launched negotiations to strengthen the \nglobal response to climate change and, in 1997, adopted the Kyoto Protocol. \n\nthe  resulting  climate  change,  and \n\nincreases  and \n\nIn  short,  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  what  \u201coperationalizes\u201d  the  Convention.  It  commits \nindustrialized countries to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions based on the principles \nof  the  Convention.  The  Convention  itself  only  encourages  countries  to  do  so.  The \nProtocol sets binding emission reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and the \nEuropean community in its first commitment period. Overall, these targets add up to an \naverage 5% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008 \nto 2012 (the first commitment period). The Protocol is structured on the principles of the \nConvention. It only binds developed countries because it recognizes that they are largely \nresponsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere, which are \nthe  result  of  more  than  150  years  of  industrial  activity.  The  Kyoto  Protocol  places  a \nheavier  burden  on  developed  nations  under  its  central  principle,  that  of  common  but \ndifferentiated  responsibility.  The  Kyoto  Protocol  legally  binds  developed  countries  to \nemission reduction targets. The Protocol\u2019s first commitment period started in 2008 and \nended in 2012. The second commitment period began on 1 January 2013 and will end \nin 2020. \n\n3.1  Selective Global Research on Climate Change \n\nin \n\nthe  globe \n\nrecent  years.  The  authors \n\nA change in climatic conditions has a diversified impact on an economy. A good climate \nhelps  a  country  to  grow  by  way  of  good  production  and  thereby  helps  in  eradicating \ninequality and poverty. To begin with, we consider the paper by Blicharska et al. (2017), \nwhich  gathers  scientists  from  around  the  world  and  deals  with  researches  on  climate \nchange  across \nlook  carefully  at  \nthe  global  North-South  divide  in  research  on  climate  change  and  its  negative \nconsequences.  They  postulate  that  the  northern  domination  of  science  in  relation  \nto  climate  change  policy  and  practice,  and  the  limited  research  led  by  southern \nresearchers \nfurther  development  and \nimplementation of global climate change agreements and nationally appropriate actions. \nThe authors illustrate the extent of the divide, review underlying issues, and analyze the \nconsequences for climate change policy development and implementation. The paper \nproposes  a  set  of  practical  steps  that  a  wide  range  of  actors  in  both  northern  and \nsouthern countries should take at global, regional, and national levels to span the North-\nSouth divide. \n\nin  southern  countries  may  hinder \n\nthe \n\nA  recent  article  by  Burke,  Hsiang,  and  Miguel  (2015)  presented  an  analysis  of  the \nrelationship between historic temperature fluctuations and macroeconomic growth. Their \nfindings can be summarized as follows. First, in contrast to past studies, they argue that \ntwenty-first century warming could lead to huge global-scale macroeconomic impacts. \nThe  best  estimate  from  Burke  and  colleagues  is  that  business-as-usual  emissions \nthroughout the 21st century will decrease per capita GDP by 23% below what it would \notherwise be, with the possibility of a much larger impact. Second, they conclude that \nboth \ntemperature  effect  depend  on  \nthe starting temperature: countries with an average yearly temperature greater than 13\u00b0C \n(55\u00b0F) will see decreased economic growth as temperatures rise. For cooler countries, \nwarming  will  be  an  economic  boon.  This  non-linear  response  creates  a  massive \nredistribution of future growth, away from hot regions and toward cool regions. Based on \n\nthe  direction  of \n\nthe  size  and \n\nthe \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nthe analysis, rich and poor countries respond similarly at any temperature, but the impact \nof warming is nonetheless much greater on poor countries because they are mostly in \nregions that are already warm. \n\nHsiang  et  al.  (2017)  developed  a  flexible  architecture  for  computing  damage  that \nintegrates  climate  science,  econometric  analyses,  and  process  models.  The  authors \nused this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived \nestimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined \nvalue of market and non-market damage across analyzed sectors\u2014agriculture, crime, \ncoastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor\u2014increases quadratically with global \nmean  temperature,  costing  on  average  roughly  1.2%  of  gross  domestic  product  per \n+1\u00b0C.  Importantly,  risk  is  distributed  unequally  across  locations,  generating  a  large \ntransfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late \n21st century, the poorest third of countries is projected to experience damage of between \n2% and 20% of income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions. \n\nAlagidede, Adu, and Frimpong(2016) contribute to the empirics of climate change and \nits  effect  on  sustainable  economic  growth  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Using  data  on  two \nclimate  variables,  temperature  and  precipitation,  and  employing  panel  cointegration \ntechniques, the authors estimate the short- and long-run effects of climate change on \ngrowth. The paper finds that an increase in temperature significantly reduces economic \nperformance  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Furthermore,  it  is  shown  that  the  relationship \nbetween real gross domestic product per capita on the one hand and climate factors on \nthe other is intrinsically non-linear. \n\nDell,  Jones,  and  Olken  (2008)  examine  the  impact  of  climatic  change  on  economic \nactivity  throughout  the  world.  The  authors  find  three  primary  results.  First,  higher \ntemperatures substantially reduce economic growth in poor countries but have little effect \nin  rich  countries.  Second,  higher  temperatures  appear  to  reduce  growth  rates  \nin  poor  countries  rather  than  just  the  level  of  output.  Third,  higher  temperatures  have \nwide-ranging  effects  in  poor  nations,  reducing  agricultural  output,  industrial  output,  \nand aggregate investment, and increasing political instability. Analysis of decade-long or \nin  \nlonger  climate  shifts  also  shows  substantial  negative  effects  on  growth \npoor countries.  \n\nCostinot, Donaldson, and Smith (2016) seek to quantify the macro-level consequences \nof some micro-level shocks. Using an extremely rich micro-level dataset that contains \ninformation about the productivity\u2014both before and after climate change\u2014of 10 crops \nfor 1.7 million fields covering the surface of the earth, the authors find that the impact of \nclimate  change  on  these  agricultural  markets  amounts  to  a  0.26%  reduction  in  global \nGDP when trade and production patterns are allowed to adjust. Since the value of output \nin  our  ten  crops  is  equal  to  1.8%  of  world  GDP,  this  corresponds  to  about  \none-sixth of the total crop value.  \n\nZhang,  Zhang,  and  Chen(2017)  explore  the  importance  of  some  additional  climatic \nvariables  other  than  temperature  and  precipitation.  Using  county-level  agricultural  \ndata  from  1980  to  2010  in  the  PRC,  we  find  that  those  additional  climatic  variables, \nespecially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those \nvariables  is  likely  to  bias  the  predicted  impacts  of  climate  change  on  crop  yields.  In \nparticular,  omitting  humidity  tends  to  over  predict  the  cost  of  climate  change  on  crop \nyields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. The paper finds that \nclimate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in the PRC by \n36.25%, 18.26%, and 45.10% respectively by the end of this century. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nZewdie  (2014)  reviews  literature  on  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  food  security \nspecifically \nto  characterize  and  synthesize  our  current \nunderstanding of the problem and identify priorities for future research. \n\nin  sub-Saharan  Africa \n\nIn sub-Saharan African countries, fast GDP growth has created a great opportunity to \nimprove  developmental  indicators, including  food  security,  but  has  shown  only  limited \nimprovements.  There  is  scientific  consensus  on  climate  change  and  it  is  expected  to \nhave substantial impact on food security. Therefore, new advocacy and a public health \nmovement are recommended to reduce the effect of climate change on food security and \nmalnutrition. Zewdie seeks to assess the impacts of climate change on food security in \nsub-Saharan Africa. \n\nDocuments  related  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  food  security  are  reviewed. \n \nLiterature  indicates  that  climate  components  like  temperature,  precipitation, \nconcentration, and extreme climate events have an effect on food security components. \nCO2\nSub-Saharan  Africa  is  one  of  the  most  severely  affected  regions  in  terms  of  climate \nchange,  where  most  of  the  population  is  dependent  on  climate-sensitive  economic \nactivities. The most direct effect and well-researched component of climate change in \nrelation  to  food  security  is  food  availability  by  reducing  net  crop  production.  It  is  also \nfound that climate change has an impact on food accessibility and utilization, but this is \nnot well studied due to its complexity. Projections indicate that this problem will be more \nsevere in the future than it is currently unless climate change mitigation and adaptation \nstrategies are undertaken. \n\nThe  review  concludes  that  climatic  conditions  are  changing  in  sub-Sahara  African \ncountries  and  this  is  affecting  food  availability,  food  accessibility,  and  utilization.  The \nproblem will be severe in the future unless the current adaptation and mitigation efforts \ndo not improve. Therefore, to reduce the problem, the region should use its potential to \ncounter climate change. \n\nThe United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) (2010) highlights \nhow climate change further exacerbates the already unacceptably high levels of hunger \nand  under-nutrition,  and  proposes  policy  directions  to  address  the  nutrition  impact  of \nclimate  change  for  consideration  by  the  16th  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  to  the \nUNFCCC. The current negotiation process offers opportunities to identify and address \nsome of the actions needed. However, great efforts will be required beyond COP16, and \nnutrition should be part of future negotiations. One could also refer to publication of World \nHealth Organization (2008) who identified major health consequences of climate change \nand devised research agenda to obtain strategies to cope these challenges.  \n\n3.2  Indian Literature on Climate Change \n\nPanda  (2009)  discusses  the  consensus  on  the  definition  of  vulnerability  to  climate \nchange and the regionally-nuanced mapping of the variable impact of climate change. \nThe  author  opines  that  despite  considerable  advances  in  the  methodologies  for \nassessing  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  ambiguities  and  uncertainties  nevertheless \nremain.  According  to  the  author,  vulnerability  research  is  facing  challenges  in  \nthree  areas.  First,  climate  change  is  not  the  only  stress  that  society  faces:  multiple \nstressors  operate  in  all  the  human  environment  systems.  It  is  therefore  a  challenging \ntask for researchers to identify and evaluate those stressors most relevant for assessing \nclimate change vulnerability. Second, vulnerability assessment requires characterization \nof the future in terms of socioeconomic and biophysical variables; however, uncertainties \nmuch  \nabout \nmore  difficult  and  challenging.  Third,  the  apparent  lack  of  consistency  in  the  use  and \nmeaning  of  the  variety  of  concepts  employed  in  vulnerability  research  contributes  to \n\nassessment \n\nvulnerability \n\nfuture \n\nmake \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nincreasing  confusion  in  this  area.  The  author  feels  that  the  research  in  India  on \nvulnerability  to  climate  change  is  still  underdeveloped.  Further  research  is  urgently \nrequired  in  several  areas.  This  research  has  to  be  based  on  an  understanding  of  the \nregional and micro-level aspects of climate change to properly address the vulnerability \nof people with more accuracy. \n\nIn  a  commentary,  Kumar  (2007)  has  discussed  the  existing  literature  on  the  effect  of \nclimate  change  on  Indian  agriculture,  covering  three  strands  of  assessment:  impact, \nvulnerability,  and  adaptation.  The  author  finds  that  the  economic  impact  of  climate \nchange on agriculture has been studied extensively the world over and it remains a hotly \ndebated  research  problem.  Papers  based  on  the  two  approaches  to  assessing  the \neconomic impact\u2014namely, the agronomic- economic and the Ricardian approach\u2014are \ndiscussed by the author. Using these approaches, it is observed that the GDP for the \nIndian  economy  is  expected  to  decline  due  to  climate  change  in  the  latter  half  of  the \ntwenty-first century.  \n\na \n\nas \n\nglobal \n\nemerge \n\nsuperpower. \n\nKapur, Khosla, and Mehta (2009) summarize extracts from the papers presented at a \nconference on climate change held in New Delhi in March 2009 focused on the different \nbargains India might have to strike, both domestically and internationally. The conference \nwas meant to address the options that India will have to exercise to maintain its growth \nsummarize  \nand \nthe  papers  presented  at  the  conference  and  conclude  that  climate  change  poses \nparticularly  difficult  challenges  for  India.  On  the  one  hand,  India  does  not  want  any \nconstraints  on  its  development  prospects;  on  the  other,  it  wants  to  be  seen  as  an \nemerging global power. While the former may be best served by its current position, the \nlatter will require it to take a leadership role on key global issues, climate change being \na critical one. It can either approach climate change as a stand-alone global negotiation, \nor  weave \nlinkages  \nwith  other  international  negotiations  that  also  involve  key  Indian  interests,  whether \nreforms  of  the  Security  Council,  World  Trade  Organization  negotiations,  the  financial \narchitecture, etc. \n\nthese  negotiations \n\n\u201cgrand  bargain\u201d \n\ninvolving \n\ninto  a \n\nauthors \n\nThe \n\nHanif et al. (2010) tried quantifying the impacts of changes in normal climate parameters \nfor the variable and sustainable development of the agricultural sector at both regional \nand  country  level.  The  study  confirms  the  premise  that  climate  change  impinges \nconsiderably upon agricultural production and the price of agricultural land. \n\nThe authors find that all the climate variables except maximum temperature have a highly \nsignificant relationship with land prices. Climate change is imposing a cost at the same \nthat it brings the benefit of an increase in land prices in Rabi season due to the increase \nin  maximum  temperature.  Benefits  show  farmers\u2019  adaptation  in  the  changing  climate, \nwhich leads to an increase in long-run net revenues.  \n\nThe increase in precipitation in Kharif season tends to increase land value. The increase \nin precipitation in Rabi season results in a loss due to the decreased production. The \nincrease  in  mean  minimum  Rabi  temperature,  being  negatively  significant,  imposes  a \ncost on the agricultural sector with increase an in temperature in this season. \n\nThe authors conclude that the aggregate global effects on agricultural productivity are \nexpected to be negative by late this century, and developing countries are expected to \nsuffer sooner and worse. \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nKumar,  Shyamsundar,  and  Nambi  (2010)  provide  a  summary  of  the  discussions  held \nduring a 2010 workshop on the economics of climate change adaptation and draw some \nconclusions for future policy analyses. Given the possibility of moderate or catastrophic \nclimate  change  in  developing  countries  and  the  failure  of  the  climate  summit  in \nCopenhagen in December 2009 to achieve any consensus on greenhouse gas mitigation \nplans, adaptation as a policy option requires careful attention. This is a report on the said \nworkshop that examined India's need to adapt to climate change. \n\nThe  article  by  Sharma  (2012)  reviewed  literature  on  the  impacts  on  human  health  of \nclimate  change  and  land  use  transition  in  the  Hindu  Kush  Himalayan  (HKH)  region, \nspecifically  dealing  with  topics  such  as  the  relationship  between  climate  change  and \nhealth;  health  sensitivity,  vulnerability,  and  adaptation;  health  determinants  related  to \nclimate change; temperature extremes and health issues; air pollution, black carbon, and \nhealth; food security, nutrition, and health; land use change and infectious diseases; and \npopulation migration and livelihood transition. The article outlines an agenda for future \nresearch on climate change and human health for the HKH region. The author suggests \nthree main agendas: first, developing methods to quantify the current impacts of climate \nand weather on a range of health outcomes for people living both in the mountains and \ndownstream; second, improving health impact models for projecting the health impacts \nof climate and land use change under different ecological and socioeconomic conditions; \nand third, evaluating the costs of the projected health impacts of climate change and the \neffectiveness of adaptation for policy inputs. \n\nThe  Joint  Global  Change  Research  Institute  and  Battelle  Memorial  Institute,  Pacific \nNorthwest Division (2009) identifies and summarizes the latest peer-reviewed research \nrelated  to  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  India,  drawing  on  both  the  literature \nsummarized  in  the  latest  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) \nassessment  reports  and  on  other  peer-reviewed  research  literature  and  relevant \nreporting. It includes such impacts as sea-level rise, water availability, agricultural shifts, \necological  disruptions  and  species  extinctions,  infrastructure  at  risk  from  extreme \nweather events (severity and frequency), and disease patterns. This paper addresses \nthe extent to which regions within India are vulnerable to climate change impact.  \n\nMenon et al. (2016) studied fishermen\u2019s perceptions of climate change from two coastal \ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh during 2011. Fishermen were interviewed to ascertain their \nperception of climate change over the last 20 years, the impact of the change in climatic \nparameters on their lives and on marine fisheries, and the adaptation measures required. \nAll fishermen contacted believed that the climate had changed in the last two decades. \nWind was ranked as the parameter that had changed the most in the last two decades, \nwhile sea status was ranked as the most problematic to fishermen. Avenues for a safe \nexit from villages and coastal protection structures in case of natural calamities were the \nhighest scoring adaptation measures. Wind was considered the most critical parameter \naffecting  marine  fishery  and  overfishing  was  identified  as  the  biggest  problem  facing \nfisheries. \n\nRuchita and Rohit (2017) estimate the impact of climate change on food grain yields in \nIndia, namely rice and millet. The authors estimate a crop-specific agricultural production \nfunction  with  exogenous  climate  variables,  namely  precipitation  and  temperature,  and \ncontrol for key inputs such as irrigation, fertilizer, and labor. The analysis is at the district \nlevel using a panel dataset for physical yield (output per hectare gross cropped area) for \nthe  period  1966\u20131999.  The  paper  finds  significant  impacts  of  climate  change \n(temperature \nagriculture.  \nFor  rice,  the  evidence  is  overwhelmingly  that  both  rainfall  and  temperature  matter,  \nbut  so  do  other  inputs\u2014labor,  fertilizer,  and  irrigation.  For  millet,  rainfall  is  the  \nsole determinant.  \n\nprecipitation) \n\nIndian \n\nand \n\non \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nKumar, Jawale, and Tandon (2008) look at the impacts of climate change on the financial \ncapital  of  India,  Mumbai.  These  include  the  impact  of  temperature  rise  on  rains  and \nfloods, and their consequent effects on health. Other consequences, such as a rise in \ndeaths  from  vector-borne  diseases,  dislocation  due  to  floods,  and  sea-level  rise,  are \nshown as projected economic losses for the years 2025 and 2050. The economic costs \nof sea-level rise in terms of loss of property along the coastline are also projected for a \n25- and 50-year timescale. The costs arising due to increases in malaria, diarrhea, and \nleptospirosis outbreaks are projected up to 2050. The conservative estimate of the total \ncost of all these impacts, including the impact of climate change on tourism, is found to \nbe enormous. \n\nSinha  and  Swaminathan  (1991)  and  Kalra  et  al.  (2008)  argue  that  crop  production  in \nIndia  is  dependent  on  temperature.  Temperature  vs.  crop  production  shows  a  funnel \nshape  for  all  seasons.  For  the  lower  temperature,  the  properties  are  almost  linearly \ncorrelated.  In  Rabi,  production  initially  shows  a  negative  trend  with  temperature  \nwhich slowly converts to a positive trend. In Kharif, that negative trend is not visible. At \nhigher temperatures, production increases for both the seasons but with large variations. \nThese  findings  may  be  helpful  for  studying  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  crop \nproduction. \n\n4.  GOVERNMENT OF INDIA POLICIES \n\n4.1  Indian Initiatives for Climate Protection \n\nVarious programs have been adopted across the globe to protect the environment. One \nsuch program is the Global Environment Facility (GEF), established as a pilot program \nfor  environmental  protection.  The  current  project  cycle  is  GEF-6,  covering  the  years \n2014\u20132018. In 1992 at Rio de Janeiro it was decided that the GEF would be adopted as \na financial mechanism to help developing countries meet their financing needs to achieve \ntheir climate change goals. As of November 2015, the GEF has directly invested a total \nof  which  \nprojects \nof \n$4.2 billion is in 1,010 projects for climate change mitigation. To date, India has received \n$516.6 million of GEF grant, of which $324.69 million is for climate change mitigation \nprojects while $10 million is for climate change adaptation projects. \n\ncountries, \n\nbillion \n\n$14.5 \n\n3,946 \n\n167 \n\nin \n\nin \n\nIn  addition,  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  was  adopted  as  a  mitigation \ninstrument under the Kyoto Protocol. At present, the CDM is facing its most severe crisis, \nhaving witnessed a steady decline in the number of projects being registered since 2013 \nowing to the crash in the price of certified emissions reduction (CER) after 2012. As of \nJanuary 2016, 1,593 of a total of 7,685 projects registered by the CDM executive board \nare  from  India,  the  second  highest  in  the  world,  the  PRC  taking  the  lead  with  3,764 \nregistered projects. Indian projects have been issued with 191 million CERs, 13.27% of \nthe total number of CERs issued. These projects are in energy efficiency, fuel switching, \nindustrial  processes,  and  the  municipal  solid  waste,  renewable  energy,  and  forestry \nsectors, and are spread across the country. Around 90%\u201395% of the CDM projects are \nbeing developed by the private sector, facilitating investments of about 583,751 crores \n($ 87.77 billion) in the country, which is more than the total of multilateral grants available \nfor climate change-related activities. \n\nApart from these international measures, the Government of India has also taken some \ninitiatives domestically. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) is known \nto  be  the  major  component  of  India\u2019s  domestic  action  against  climate  change.  The \nNAPCC  has  proposed  a  waste-to-energy  mission  which  will  incentivize  efforts  toward \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nharnessing energy from waste and is aimed at lowering India\u2019s dependence on coal, oil, \nand  gas  for  power  production.  The  National  Mission  on  Coastal  Areas  (NMCA)  will \nprepare an integrated coastal resource management plan and map vulnerabilities along \nthe entire (nearly 7,000 km long) shoreline.  \n\nThe State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) has also been introduced to create \ninstitutional capacity and implement sectoral activities to address climate change. These \nplans are focused on adaptation with mitigation as a co-benefit in sectors such as water, \nagriculture, tourism, forestry, transport, habitat, and energy.  \n\nA National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) has been established with a \nbudget provision of 1,350 crore for the year 2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017. It is meant to \nassist in meeting the cost of national and state level adaptation measures in areas that \nare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. \n\nTo reduce the consumption of coal, India has introduced carbon tax in the form of a cess \non coal. The National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) is supported by the cess on coal.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThis chapter attempts to provide an analytical description of how forces of globalization\u2014\nprimarily  trade  and  FDI\u2014have  impacted  the  environment  in  India.  Unfortunately,  as \nstated  earlier,  specific  literature  on  the  topic  does  not  contain  a  significant  number  of \nworthwhile research initiatives from an analytical and holistic perspective. We have tried \nto \nof  \ntrade and FDI on environmental conditions is less of an issue compared to its indirect \neffect  through  its  positive  impact  on  GDP  growth  and  resultant  prosperity.  We  also \nemphasize  that  enforcing  regulations  is  presently  a  hugely  complex  task  given \n\nimpress \n\nreaders \n\nimpact \n\ndirect \n\nupon \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\ncorruption, informal markets, and the inability of citizens to cooperate and form effective \nlobbies.  We  have  tried  to  give  simple,  readable  theoretical  inputs  and  examples.  We \nhave  provided  original  time  series  estimates  of  the  impact  of  trade  and  FDI  on  the \nenvironment over the last three and a half decades. We have then elaborated briefly on \nglobal climate change research and its Indian counterpart to provide a perspective for \nour  work,  followed  by  a  brief  summary  of  recent  policy  initiatives  from  the  Indian \ngovernment. \n\nWe believe that more specific research is needed to assess the environmental impact of \npatterns  of  production  and  consumption.  Recent  scientific  analysis  focuses  on  better \nscientific  measuring  of  the  damage  and  focuses  on  the  impact  of  climate  change  on \ninequality  (Hsiang  et  al.  2017;  Pizer  2017).  Clearly,  warmer  regions  in  the  globe, \nincluding India and many developing and Asian countries, are affected more than their \nnorthern counterparts by global warming. In fact, recent US estimates show that climate \nchange has increased inequality between the north and the south of the US; the pattern \nthe  conditions  of  \nof  production  specialization \nglobal trade and investment, and by the physical infrastructural support. India and the \nPRC, the two largest countries in Asia, have very different GDP composition. This poses \nthe question of whether excessive industrialization, coupled with the usual transboundary \nand  climate  concerns,  makes  the  PRC  more  vulnerable  than  India,  which  thrives \nexcessively  on  service  sector  growth  and, \nthe  benefit  of  \nlow  pollution  growth.  This  also  calls  for  serious  exploration  of  green  accounting  and \npreparation of a database with better environmental indicators, as extensively discussed \nin Sengupta (2013). \n\nis  generally \n\ninduced  by \n\nturn,  gets \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 873 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nMarjit and Yu \n\nAcharyya, J.

The most important and critical segments of this reform were trade and foreign \ninvestment.  India  has  felt  the  impact  of  globalization  through  increased  prosperity,  partly \ntriggered by increasing trade volumes, investment, and growth. The theme of this article is to \nmake readers aware of the impact of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) \non climate change with special reference to India\u2019s economy.  \n \nScholarly work on trade, FDI, and the environment in India with rich theoretical insight and \nsolid  empirical  evidence  is  scarce.  However,  there  is  a  good  amount  of  work  on  general \nenvironmental  issues.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  trade  liberalization  has  not  directly  or \nsubstantially affected carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, it has probably had greater \neffects through its impact on gross domestic product (GDP). In other words, we impress upon \nreaders that the direct impact of trade and FDI on environmental conditions is less of an issue \nimpact  on  GDP  growth  \ncompared  with \nand resultant prosperity. We also emphasize that enforcing regulations is a complex task given \ncorruption,  informal  markets,  and  the  inability  of  citizens  to  cooperate  and  form  effective \nlobbies.  \n \nPreliminary  calculations  using  data  from  the  World  Bank  show  that  GDP  has  a  direct, \nproportional relationship with the extent of CO2 emissions in India, and the relationship is even \nstronger after the introduction of the liberalization policy in the 1990s. However, trade seems \nto have an inversely proportional relationship, consistent with the view that Indian imports are \nmostly manufactured items that may involve polluting production process and are currently \nbeing produced outside India. \n \nWe believe more specific research is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of \npatterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better scientific \nmeasures of the damage and impact of climate change and its effect on inequality. Clearly, \nwarmer regions around the globe, including India and many developing Asian countries, will \nbe  affected  more  than  their  northern  counterparts  due  to  global  warming.  In  fact,  recent \nestimates show that climate change has increased inequality in the United States between the \nnorth and the south. Patterns of production are generally induced by the conditions of global \ntrade and investment and by physical infrastructural support and local resources. India and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the two largest countries in Asia, have very different \nGDP  compositions.  This  poses  the  question  of  whether  excessive  industrialization  coupled \nwith the usual transboundary and climate concerns make the PRC more vulnerable than India, \nwhich thrives on service sector growth and in turn benefits from the low pollution content of \ngrowth.  This  also  calls  for  serious  exploration  of  green  accounting  and  the  preparation  of \ndatabases with better environmental indicators. \n \nIt will be worthwhile to explore the effect of liberalization on other climatic aspects, such as \nwater  pollution  and  land  salinity,  with  the  help  of  large  scientific  databases.  But  the  fact \nremains that only through trade can countries replace the local production of pollution intensive \ngoods with imports and reduce CO2 emissions. Countries that can replace the production of \npollution intensive goods by imports will reduce CO2 emissions on this count. The growth effect, \nhowever,  will  go  the  other  way.  Countries  with  different  trade  patterns  may  suffer  on  both \ncounts. India is possibly a mixed case and more detailed analysis is needed to examine the \nhypothesis. \n \nKeywords: international trade, FDI, environment, corruption, informal economy \n \nJEL Classification: F18, F21, F64, D73, F26\n", " \n"]}
