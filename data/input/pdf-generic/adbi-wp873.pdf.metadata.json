The most important and critical segments of this reform were trade and foreign \ninvestment. India has felt the impact of globalization through increased prosperity, partly \ntriggered by increasing trade volumes, investment, and growth. The theme of this article is to \nmake readers aware of the impact of international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) \non climate change with special reference to India\u2019s economy.  \n \nScholarly work on trade, FDI, and the environment in India with rich theoretical insight and \nsolid empirical evidence is scarce. However, there is a good amount of work on general \nenvironmental  issues.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  trade  liberalization  has  not  directly  or \nsubstantially affected carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. However, it has probably had greater \n2\neffects through its impact on gross domestic product (GDP). In other words, we impress upon \nreaders that the direct impact of trade and FDI on environmental conditions is less of an issue \ncompared  with  the  indirect  effects  through  the  positive  impact  on  GDP  growth  \nand resultant prosperity. We also emphasize that enforcing regulations is a complex task given \ncorruption, informal markets, and the inability of citizens to cooperate and form effective \nlobbies.  \n \nPreliminary  calculations  using  data  from  the World  Bank  show  that  GDP  has a  direct, \nproportional relationship with the extent of CO  emissions in India, and the relationship is even \n2\nstronger after the introduction of the liberalization policy in the 1990s. However, trade seems \nto have an inversely proportional relationship, consistent with the view that Indian imports are \nmostly manufactured items that may involve polluting production process and are currently \nbeing produced outside India. \n \nWe believe more specific research is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of \npatterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better scientific \nmeasures of the damage and impact of climate change and its effect on inequality. Clearly, \nwarmer regions around the globe, including India and many developing Asian countries, will \nbe affected more than their northern counterparts due to global warming. In fact, recent \nestimates show that climate change has increased inequality in the United States between the \nnorth and the south. Patterns of production are generally induced by the conditions of global \ntrade and investment and by physical infrastructural support and local resources. India and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the two largest countries in Asia, have very different \nGDP compositions. This poses the question of whether excessive industrialization coupled \nwith the usual transboundary and climate concerns make the PRC more vulnerable than India, \nwhich thrives on service sector growth and in turn benefits from the low pollution content of \ngrowth. This also calls for serious exploration of green accounting and the preparation of \ndatabases with better environmental indicators. \n \nIt will be worthwhile to explore the effect of liberalization on other climatic aspects, such as \nwater pollution and land salinity, with the help of large scientific databases. But the fact \nremains that only through trade can countries replace the local production of pollution intensive \ngoods with imports and reduce CO  emissions. Countries that can replace the production of \n2\npollution intensive goods by imports will reduce CO  emissions on this count. The growth effect, \n2\nhowever, will go the other way. Countries with different trade patterns may suffer on both \ncounts. India is possibly a mixed case and more detailed analysis is needed to examine the \nhypothesis. \n \nKeywords: international trade, FDI, environment, corruption, informal economy \n \nJEL Classification: F18, F21, F64, D73, F26\n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nContents \n \n \n1.

INTRODUCTION \nIndia embarked on a path of liberal economic reform in the 1990s after years of nurturing \nan intensively regulated and controlled economic environment that was loosened a bit in \nthe mid-1980s. Now it is well recognized that such a sea change in policy has led to \nimpressive achievements in many sectors of the economy. The most important and \ncritical  segment  of  this  reform  has  been  trade  and  foreign  investment,  including \nderegulations in the well-known industrial licensing system. The theme of this chapter is \nto make readers aware of the relevant work on climate change and the impact of trade \nand environment on climate change with special reference to India\u2019s economy. The \nimpact of globalization on India has been felt in terms of increasing prosperity, partly \ntriggered by increasing volume of trade, investment, and growth.  \nA  cursory  look  at  the  evidence  suggests  that  the  conventional  openness  index, \nrepresented by the ratio of volume of trade to gross domestic product (GDP), increased \nsubstantially from a little over 10% in the 1990s to almost 50% in recent times. Average \ntariff rates came down drastically, leading to greater imports and exports. The foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) flows also started recording impressive levels over the next  \ntwo decades. Trade and FDI in the Indian context are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. Per \ncapita energy consumption and carbon dioxide (  emissions have also increased in \nthe post-reform period, as suggested in Figures 3 and 4; Figure 5 depicts India\u2019s GDP \ngrowth. However, as Figures 6 and 7 show, IndCiaO\u2019s2 )per capita consumption of energy \nand   emissions are both way below the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the \nUnited States (US). \nCO2\nFigure 1: FDI, Trade, and CO Emissions in India \n2 \n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org).  \n   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nFigure 2.1: Trade Openness after Liberalization \n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \nFigure 2.2: Exports and Imports  \n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \nFigure 3: Energy Utilization in India  \n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nFigure 4: CO  Emissions in India after Liberalization \n2\n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \nFigure 5: GDP Growth of Indian Economy, 1990\u20132016 \n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.worldbank.org). \nFigure 6: Per Capita CO  Emission in Selective Countries \n2\n \nNote: Bubble width indicates total emissions between 1970 and 2014 for the respective countries, \nindicated alongside the bubbles. \nSource: Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 (Government of India). \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nFigure 7: CO  Emission from Different Sectors \n2\n \nSource: Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 (Government of India). \nThe effects of trade and FDI, though mixed and different, are felt on growth in GDP. India \nhas jumped ahead of nations, breaking the taboo of the so-called historic \u201cHindu\u201d rate of \ngrowth of 3% per annum, averaging around 8% per annum (India\u2019s GDP growth rate in \nthe post-reform period is shown in Figure 5). \nIn spite of the major financial crises and crashes of 1997 and 2008, India has remained \na close second to the PRC and is currently growing at a commendable rate. After the \nhistoric demonetization episode in November 2016, when about 86% of currency was \nwithdrawn from circulation to control black market transactions and illegal liquidity, the \ngrowth rate has faltered a little. The recent work on global fiscal policy and inequality by \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Clements et al. 2015) confirms the claim that \nmillions of people have been lifted above the poverty line thanks to the historic switch to \na regime of liberal economic policies. Interestingly, while the degree of inequality in the \n2000s shows a moderately increased level relative to the 1980s, the increment is far \nlower than in the PRC and the increase itself is definitely on the lower side if compared \nwith the world average during the relevant period. \nAgainst this backdrop, it is hard to be too concerned about the direct environmental \nconsequences of more open trade and investment regimes. It is also extremely difficult \nto isolate effects that are exclusively due to liberal trade policies and quite independent \nof the growth effect. The real need is to analyze the problems at various levels by \nfocusing on the effects of a significant change in the growth regime, reflecting the \nincreasing level of prosperity, which has definitely been impacted by liberal trade policies. \nThe pattern of trade should itself have some effect on environmental elements such as \nfossil fuels, renewable energy, carbon emissions, etc. Further to this effect, one should \nworry about overall climate change, food supply, and food security. It is also important \nto understand the pattern of India\u2019s trade and investment that has characterized its \ngrowth path over the last few decades. On the one hand, trade and investment policies \nmay directly regulate environmental damage and affect optimal utilization of natural \nresources. On the other hand, any kind of regulatory policy or its emergence will be \nguided  by  several  critical  factors  involving  awareness,  political  lobbies,  strategic \nreactions,  and  the  massive  size  of  the  informal  sector.  Coupled  with  this,  India\u2019s \nparticipation in global policy making to control transboundary pollution, climate change, \nand   emission-related factors will be also important. We reflect on all of these as \nmuch as possible given the limited length of the chapter. The main point of this chapter \nCO2\n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nis to argue that, by global standards, India\u2019s performance has not been particularly \nworrisome. Liberal trade policies and market integration have contributed to growth, \nresulting in pressure on the use of natural resources. However, poor regulatory control \nhas created sporadic natural and national disasters in tandem with factors that are \naffected by global warming. It is this problem of implementing regulations that requires \nspecial attention.  \nThere are certain global issues which involve transboundary concerns and India cannot \nbe  insulated  from  those  concerns.  Globalization  and  the  environment  in  India are \ndependent in part on global climatic conditions and the policies of the other countries, as \none cannot ignore global negative externalities. These will be related to the policies with \nwhich the Indian government has been engaged. In this introductory section, we highlight \nresearch on climate change at the global level and emerging problems that require \nattention. We reflect upon some of these issues in the policy section. \nIn the second section of the chapter, we discuss the theoretical implications, drawing \nfrom various contributions in the sphere of environmental regulations. In the third section, \nwe provide a panoramic view of the available academic literature on the impact of trade \non the environment in general and on India specifically, mainly from an empirical \nperspective. The fourth section highlights the global research on climate change and the \nIndian counterpart. The fifth section briefly addresses the policy strategies of the Indian \ngovernment. The concluding section will highlight issues that require further attention \nand link India\u2019s concerns with the greater Asian perspective before providing some \nconcluding remarks. \n2.  THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE \nTrade  and  FDI-impacted  prosperity  may  potentially  have  severe,  but  sporadic, \nenvironmental  consequences,  along  with  silent  erosion  of  ecological  surroundings. \nHowever, a look at the destination of trade and FDI in various sectors shows a relatively \nbenign picture (Kar and Majumdar 2016). It is very difficult to suggest that trade and FDI \nwere singularly important in terms of environmental damage. \nThe expansion of tourism, an appetite for real estate investments, and prosperity-led \ndemand for the construction sector can lead to excessive use of land-based resources, \ngiving rise to catastrophic events. Agriculture, with increasing use of chemical fertilizers \nand pesticides, has long affected the soil condition; however, it is very difficult to identify \nand isolate the role of trade in such a malady. India has suffered, and will continue to \nsuffer, since the regulatory framework may not function properly for institutional reasons. \nIt is generally the case that if we give up industries that generate pollution in the process \nof production and import the underlying products as trade opens up, we reduce the extent \nof environmental damage. On the other hand, if our export good has significant pollution \ncontent,  the  result  is  exactly  reversed;  given  that  India\u2019s  trade  pattern  is  not \nmanufacturing intensive, it may not have suffered from this aspect of the problem. \nHowever, the pressure of growth and prosperity on the informal sector, weak and corrupt \ninstitutional structure, and social neglect may have severely impacted the ability to \nregulate or control environmental damage. Theoretical and empirical research on the \nproblem of such regulatory control in the context of the informal sector has been amply \ndemonstrated in Biswas, Farzanegan, and Thum (2012) and Biswas and Thum (2017). \nThe problem of regulation with a huge informal sector has been discussed in detail in \nMarjit, Ghosh, and Biswas (2007), Marjit and Kar (2011, 2012), etc. The basic idea is as \nfollows. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nConsider   as  the  level  of  GDP.

This  constitutes  a  major  problem  for  the \ngovernment, as the majority of the workforce is engaged in the informal sector, with no \nexception across the entire developing world. As has been elaborated in Marjit and Kar \n(2011), this is the stark reality for India. Critical policies have been discussed in the \ncontext of the labor market by Marjit (2003); Marjit, Kar, and Acharyya (2007); Marjit and \nKar (2012); Acharyya and Kar (2014), etc. focusing on interaction between the formal \nand informal sectors. However, such a general equilibrium exercise is rare in the context \nof environmental regulations.  \nTypically, the political concern seems to be that environmental regulations tend to \ndepress employment and wages and so are difficult to implement in democracies. \nHowever, movement of capital between formal and informal sectors, coupled with the \ninability of the government to push through regulations in the informal sector, may \nactually prove to be helpful to the informal workers by raising wages. We provide a \ntheoretical example drawn primarily from Marjit (2003) and Marjit and Kar (2011).  \nFigure 8 describes a situation where   is hired in the formal sector with a fixed \nunionized wage   The rest,  , are hired in the informal sector at wage  , \nwhere  .

If there is a decline in  , vote bank \npolitics will not allow such a regulatory move. The above example is based on the \nassumption that the informal sector produces a final good: the result will \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4achange when \nthe informal sector produces an intermediate good for the formal sector. A pollution tax \non the formal sector will affect the informal sector directly, even if the government cannot \ndirectly enforce an environmental stand on the informal sector. As long as the price of \nthe intermediate good is pegged by trade by a standard small economy assumption, the \nresult will not vary much, as the informal sector can find other buyers in the international \nmarket. Return to capital will fall and   will rise. If the price of the intermediate good is \nendogenously determined and/or there is a direct environmental tax on the informal \nsector,   may fall. The environmenta\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64l regulations imposed on the formal and informal \nsectors may exhibit complex policy reactions.  \n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\nLet us move from production-related environmental concern to the problem of regulation \nin  the  domain  of  public  goods.  Economic  growth  fueled  by  trade  or  \nFDI-related prosperity often leads to excessive use of natural resources. Examples in \nIndia are abundant where the expanding real estate and construction business often \nencroach upon water bodies on the one hand and lead to excessive local demand for \nwater on the other, pushing the water level further down. Lack of cooperative effort on \nthe part of citizen users for the renovation of water bodies, cleaning, dredging, etc. leads \nto  suboptimal  public  investment  in  critical  areas  of  consumption,  as  lobbying  is \ninadequate. A few years ago, in Northern India, a massive landslide caused by torrential \nrain feeding a mountain river led to a huge loss of prosperity and human lives (Kala 2014; \nSingh et al. 2016). Everyone could see the problem of construction of cheap hotels \nacross river banks that crippled the soil base and made it vulnerable to natural disaster. \nExcessive use of groundwater in India has led to serious arsenic-related diseases. This \nhas been documented time and again (Das et al. 1994). These point to an inevitable \nfallout of excessive demand on natural resources, a hallmark of a fast-growing economy. \nIt is well known that energy-intensive consumption activities during winter perennially \naffect the PRC and its overuse of coal-based resources. (The National Development and \nReform Commission of the PRC said in its annual report that it would implement policies \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \naimed at reducing coal consumption and controlling the number of energy-intensive \nprojects in polluted regions, Aizhu et al. 2015).  \nThe problem arises at three levels.  \nFirst, the regulation priorities of the government can be lopsided, being dependent on \nthe electoral policies and economic performance of the political regime. For example, if \ntrade and FDI stimulate growth and growth relates to ecological problems at the local, \nregional, or national level, governments may not stir unless natural and national disasters \noccur through floods, droughts, landslides, etc.  \nSecond, people may not consider environmental degradation as a quality of life issue  \nin  a  poor  country.  While  growth  and  affluence  slowly  make  an  impact,  public \nconsciousness in this regard may turn out to be too shallow and non-existent. The recent \npolicy drive by the Indian government, known as the Clear India (Swatch Bharat) mission, \nis an endeavor that has created millions of toilets. This speaks loudly of a chronic \nproblem of defecation-induced health hazards and a lack of awareness among people. \nInternational trade, FDI, and other growth-augmenting avenues have very little to deliver \nin that respect, as prosperity and social awareness may not go hand in hand. \nThird, lack of cooperation in public good-related initiatives among affluent citizens to \nresolve local problems of excessive exploitation of natural resources makes the problem \neven more complex. \nThe latter problem can be related to a simple theoretical structure. Cooperation may  \nfail  to  emerge  in  a  trigger  strategy-led  repeated  game-theoretic  setting  with  \nincreasing prosperity.  \nConsider a community of   persons with expenditures  ,   While higher \n delivers higher utility,   may affect a natural resource commonly used by all but \nwithout any property right \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5ba\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5bssigned.

A representative introductory sample is Copeland and Taylor \n(2004, 2013) and Chao and Yu (2004). While these works have provided rich insights \ntoward an understanding of the problem, there have been other recent papers. Later, we \nwill try to focus on the aspects that are particularly relevant for India. We now briefly \nsummarize  some  works  that  have  examined  the  relationship  between  trade  and \nenvironment  from  a  general  perspective.  This  is  very  selective,  but  the  papers \nthemselves have a plethora of references to draw from that readers can use. Later, we \nreflect on the Indian scenario. \nNeumayer  (2000)  critically  assesses  three  ways  in  which  trade  might  harm  the \nenvironment. First, trade liberalization might exacerbate existing levels of resource \ndepletion and environmental pollution; second, open borders might allow companies to \nmigrate to \u201cpollution havens,\u201d thus undermining high environmental standards in host \ncountries; and third, the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) might favor trade over environmental interests in case of conflict. It is shown that \nwhile trade liberalization can lead to an increase in environmental degradation, pollution \nhavens are not a statistically significant phenomenon.  \nCopeland and Taylor (2001) draw quite heavily from trade theory but develop a simple \npollution demand and supply system featuring marginal abatement cost and marginal \ndamage schedules familiar to environmental economists. They use a simple model to \nfacilitate extensions examining the environmental consequences of growth, the impact \nof trade liberalization, and strategic interaction between countries. One could also refer \nto Antweiler et al. (2001) in this context. \nChen  and  Woodland  (2013)  analyze  non-cooperative  environmental  policies  and \ninvestigate  whether  trade  undermines  the  effectiveness  of  unilateral  environmental \npolicies, in which carbon leakage and international competitiveness are of particular \nimportance. They review the interactions between trade and environmental policies, \nborder  tax  adjustment  policies,  and  the  role  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  in \ncombating climate change arising from economic activities.  \nDellink, Hwang, Lanzi, and Chateau (2017), by building on the analysis in the OECD\u2019s \n2015 report, The Economic Consequences of Climate Change, present a plausible \nscenario of future socioeconomic developments and climate damage to shed light on the \nmechanisms at work in explaining how climate change will affect trade.  \nSauvage  and  Timiliotis  (2017)  discuss  international  trade  in  environmental-related \nservices. By lowering the costs of these services and improving access to suppliers, \ntrade policy can contribute, alongside energy and environmental policy, to the prevention \nand abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in all its forms.  \nReaders can also consult Beghin et al. (1994), Sturm (2003), and Dupuy (2012) for \nadditional references in this area. \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \n2.2  Research on Trade and Environment on India \nIndia\u2019s trade is typically dominated by the service sector, agriculture, oil, industrial \ncomponents, gems and jewelry, etc. The fact that wage inequality has been on the  \nrise  in  the  country  for  quite  some  time  indicates  an  ever-growing  premium  for  \nhuman  capital,  in  particular  in  the  information  technology-led  sectors  (Marjit  and \nAcharyya 2003, 2009).

On the other hand, \ndue  to  the  import  of  these  manufacturing  items,  the  polluting  import  substitution \nmanufacturing is being closed down, possibly resulting in lower pollution in India due to \nimports. Furthermore, Indian exports, though they have manufacturing content, also \ncomprise growing IT service-oriented activities, which are almost without pollution. \nHence trade helps India to reduce pollution, as reflected in the negative relationship in \nour estimated equation. Like GDP, FDI is found to positively, though rather insignificantly, \ninfluence  emission in India. The FDI result echoes the work of Acharyya (2009), \nwhich we discuss later. \nCO2\nNow, we all know the Indian economy was opened to the rest of world in 1991 through \nthe process of liberalization. This is expected to have had some impact on pollution. After \nliberalization,  GDP,  trade,  and  FDI  all  rose  for  the  Indian  economy.  We  need  \nto ascertain whether pollution in India has increased due to liberalization. In Figure 9, we \nplot the level of  emissions across the years and try to see if there is any structural \nshift. \nCO2\nFigure 9: CO  Consumption in India \n2\n \nSource: World Bank Data (www.data.workbank.org). \nIt seems from the diagram that there is no structural shift but there is a change in slope \nafter liberalization.

However, there is no statistically significant shift in the slope or \nrate of increase/decrease of pollution due to trade after the liberalization policy came into \nCfoOrc2e in India.  \nAcharyya (2009) provides an early analysis of the impact of FDI on the environment, \nwhere  it  is  demonstrated  that  FDI  inflow  in  the  1990s  had  a  quite  large  positive  \nimpact on   emissions through output growth, and FDI had a positive but marginal \nimpact on growth. The two together imply that growth must have a very high emission \nCO2\n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nelasticity. This, in a way, may contradict the observations of Wei and Smarzynska (1999) \nand Hassaballa (2013) regarding the developing world and pollution havens, as reported \nin Kar and Majumdar (2016).  \nPapers by Kar and Majumdar (2016) have made a serious attempt to reflect on trade \nand technology policies with reference to the developing world and with a special \nemphasis on India. Before we discuss these papers, it is important to note that the better \nenvironmental standards are usually dependent on internal policies rather than on trade \nand FDI-related policies. However, the impact of market integration on the environment \nmay require trade-specific policies. Coupled with such policies, one needs to seriously \nfocus on abatement technology. Continuous upgrading of technology through diffusion \nand interlinkage across the value chain can have a profound, albeit invisible, impact on \nemission standards.  \nKar and Majumdar (2016) show that for a group of low-middle-income countries and \nsorted on the basis of manufacturing to trade ratios, of which India is a prominent \nmember, a rise in MFN (most favored nation) tariff rates reduces CO  emissions,  \n2\nand  that  effect  is  further  reinforced  if  FDI  flows  to  non-polluting  sectors  such  as \nagriculture.  A  rise  in  MFN  tariff  rates  takes  care  of  the  trade  diversion  problem.  \nThe  paper rigorously  demonstrates  that  further  protection  may  actually  help  lower \nemission standards. For agriculture, substitution of imports by FDI has a better effect on \nemissions.  \nMajumdar and Kar (2017) study the emission intensity of fifteen organized manufacturing \nand agricultural sectors in India and find the relationship between technology adoption \nand emission intensity at the industry level over 1996\u20132009. They show that when better \ntechnologies  are  adopted  for  the  production  of  export  goods  \nas  opposed  to  non-traded  goods,  emissions  fall  in  a  significant  way.  Typically, \ninternational trade and FDI facilitate the adoption of technology. The direct effect of \nglobalization might therefore have helped in this regard. \n3.  PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE GLOBAL \nLEVEL: ENDURING AND CONTEMPORARY  \nPOLICY ISSUES \nClimate change is a complex problem which, though environmental in nature, has \nconsequences for all spheres of existence on our planet. It either impacts, or is impacted \nby,  global  issues,  including  poverty,  economic  development,  population  growth, \nsustainable  development,  and  resource  management.  Climate  change  is  a  global \nchallenge and requires a global solution. Greenhouse gas emissions have the same \nimpact on the atmosphere whether they originate in Washington, London, or Beijing. \nConsequently, action by one country to reduce emissions will do little to reduce global \nwarming unless other countries act as well. Ultimately, an effective strategy will require \ncommitment and action from all the major emitting countries. Climate change poses the \nserious challenge of carbon dioxide emission reduction. Emission control by developing \ncountries is becoming key for the effective mitigation of climate change, as those \ncountries now account for more than a half of global emissions and are still expanding \ntheir energy infrastructure.  \nAt the very heart of the response to climate change, however, lies the need to reduce \nemissions. In 2010, governments agreed that emissions need to be reduced so that \nglobal temperature increases are limited to below two degrees Celsius. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nIn  1992,  countries  joined  an  international  treaty,  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to consider what they could do to limit global \ntemperature  increases  and  the  resulting  climate  change,  and  to  cope  with  \nits  impacts.  By  1995,  countries  realized  that  emission  reduction  provisions  in  the \nConvention were inadequate. As a result, they launched negotiations to strengthen the \nglobal response to climate change and, in 1997, adopted the Kyoto Protocol. \nIn  short,  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  what  \u201coperationalizes\u201d  the  Convention.  It  commits \nindustrialized countries to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions based on the principles \nof the Convention. The Convention itself only encourages countries to do so. The \nProtocol sets binding emission reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and the \nEuropean community in its first commitment period. Overall, these targets add up to an \naverage 5% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008 \nto 2012 (the first commitment period). The Protocol is structured on the principles of the \nConvention. It only binds developed countries because it recognizes that they are largely \nresponsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere, which are \nthe result of more than 150 years of industrial activity. The Kyoto Protocol places a \nheavier burden on developed nations under its central principle, that of common but \ndifferentiated responsibility. The Kyoto Protocol legally binds developed countries to \nemission reduction targets. The Protocol\u2019s first commitment period started in 2008 and \nended in 2012. The second commitment period began on 1 January 2013 and will end \nin 2020. \n3.1  Selective Global Research on Climate Change \nA change in climatic conditions has a diversified impact on an economy. A good climate \nhelps a country to grow by way of good production and thereby helps in eradicating \ninequality and poverty. To begin with, we consider the paper by Blicharska et al. (2017), \nwhich gathers scientists from around the world and deals with researches on climate \nchange  across  the  globe  in  recent  years.  The  authors  look  carefully  at  \nthe  global  North-South  divide  in  research  on  climate  change  and  its  negative \nconsequences.  They  postulate  that  the  northern  domination  of  science  in  relation  \nto  climate  change  policy  and  practice,  and  the  limited  research  led  by  southern \nresearchers  in  southern  countries  may  hinder  the  further  development  and \nimplementation of global climate change agreements and nationally appropriate actions. \nThe authors illustrate the extent of the divide, review underlying issues, and analyze the \nconsequences for climate change policy development and implementation. The paper \nproposes a set of practical steps that a wide range of actors in both northern and \nsouthern countries should take at global, regional, and national levels to span the North-\nSouth divide. \nA recent article by Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel (2015) presented an analysis of the \nrelationship between historic temperature fluctuations and macroeconomic growth. Their \nfindings can be summarized as follows. First, in contrast to past studies, they argue that \ntwenty-first century warming could lead to huge global-scale macroeconomic impacts. \nThe best estimate from Burke and colleagues is that business-as-usual emissions \nthroughout the 21st century will decrease per capita GDP by 23% below what it would \notherwise be, with the possibility of a much larger impact. Second, they conclude that \nboth  the  size  and  the  direction  of  the  temperature  effect  depend  on  \nthe starting temperature: countries with an average yearly temperature greater than 13\u00b0C \n(55\u00b0F) will see decreased economic growth as temperatures rise. For cooler countries, \nwarming  will  be  an  economic  boon.  This  non-linear  response  creates  a  massive \nredistribution of future growth, away from hot regions and toward cool regions. Based on \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nthe analysis, rich and poor countries respond similarly at any temperature, but the impact \nof warming is nonetheless much greater on poor countries because they are mostly in \nregions that are already warm. \nHsiang  et  al.  (2017)  developed  a  flexible  architecture  for  computing  damage  that \nintegrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. The authors \nused this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived \nestimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined \nvalue of market and non-market damage across analyzed sectors\u2014agriculture, crime, \ncoastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor\u2014increases quadratically with global \nmean temperature, costing on average roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per \n+1\u00b0C. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large \ntransfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late \n21st century, the poorest third of countries is projected to experience damage of between \n2% and 20% of income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions. \nAlagidede, Adu, and Frimpong(2016) contribute to the empirics of climate change and \nits effect on sustainable economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data on two \nclimate variables, temperature and precipitation, and employing panel cointegration \ntechniques, the authors estimate the short- and long-run effects of climate change on \ngrowth. The paper finds that an increase in temperature significantly reduces economic \nperformance  in  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Furthermore,  it  is  shown  that  the  relationship \nbetween real gross domestic product per capita on the one hand and climate factors on \nthe other is intrinsically non-linear. \nDell, Jones, and Olken (2008) examine the impact of climatic change on economic \nactivity  throughout  the  world.  The  authors  find  three  primary  results.  First,  higher \ntemperatures substantially reduce economic growth in poor countries but have little effect \nin  rich  countries.  Second,  higher  temperatures  appear  to  reduce  growth  rates  \nin poor countries rather than just the level of output. Third, higher temperatures have \nwide-ranging effects in poor nations, reducing agricultural output, industrial output,  \nand aggregate investment, and increasing political instability. Analysis of decade-long or \nlonger  climate  shifts  also  shows  substantial  negative  effects  on  growth  in  \npoor countries.  \nCostinot, Donaldson, and Smith (2016) seek to quantify the macro-level consequences \nof some micro-level shocks. Using an extremely rich micro-level dataset that contains \ninformation about the productivity\u2014both before and after climate change\u2014of 10 crops \nfor 1.7 million fields covering the surface of the earth, the authors find that the impact of \nclimate change on these agricultural markets amounts to a 0.26% reduction in global \nGDP when trade and production patterns are allowed to adjust. Since the value of output \nin  our  ten  crops  is  equal  to  1.8%  of  world  GDP,  this  corresponds  to  about  \none-sixth of the total crop value.  \nZhang, Zhang, and Chen(2017) explore the importance of some additional climatic \nvariables  other  than  temperature  and  precipitation.  Using  county-level  agricultural  \ndata from 1980 to 2010 in the PRC, we find that those additional climatic variables, \nespecially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those \nvariables is likely to bias the predicted impacts of climate change on crop yields. In \nparticular, omitting humidity tends to over predict the cost of climate change on crop \nyields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. The paper finds that \nclimate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in the PRC by \n36.25%, 18.26%, and 45.10% respectively by the end of this century. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nZewdie (2014) reviews literature on the impacts of climate change and food security \nspecifically  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  to  characterize  and  synthesize  our  current \nunderstanding of the problem and identify priorities for future research. \nIn sub-Saharan African countries, fast GDP growth has created a great opportunity to \nimprove developmental indicators, including food security, but has shown only limited \nimprovements. There is scientific consensus on climate change and it is expected to \nhave substantial impact on food security. Therefore, new advocacy and a public health \nmovement are recommended to reduce the effect of climate change on food security and \nmalnutrition. Zewdie seeks to assess the impacts of climate change on food security in \nsub-Saharan Africa. \nDocuments related to the impacts of climate change on food security are reviewed. \nLiterature  indicates  that  climate  components  like  temperature,  precipitation,   \nconcentration, and extreme climate events have an effect on food security components. \nSub-Saharan Africa is one of the most severely affected regions in terms of climCaOte2 \nchange, where most of the population is dependent on climate-sensitive economic \nactivities. The most direct effect and well-researched component of climate change in \nrelation to food security is food availability by reducing net crop production. It is also \nfound that climate change has an impact on food accessibility and utilization, but this is \nnot well studied due to its complexity. Projections indicate that this problem will be more \nsevere in the future than it is currently unless climate change mitigation and adaptation \nstrategies are undertaken. \nThe  review  concludes  that climatic  conditions  are changing  in  sub-Sahara  African \ncountries and this is affecting food availability, food accessibility, and utilization. The \nproblem will be severe in the future unless the current adaptation and mitigation efforts \ndo not improve. Therefore, to reduce the problem, the region should use its potential to \ncounter climate change. \nThe United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) (2010) highlights \nhow climate change further exacerbates the already unacceptably high levels of hunger \nand under-nutrition, and proposes policy directions to address the nutrition impact of \nclimate change for consideration by the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the \nUNFCCC. The current negotiation process offers opportunities to identify and address \nsome of the actions needed. However, great efforts will be required beyond COP16, and \nnutrition should be part of future negotiations. One could also refer to publication of World \nHealth Organization (2008) who identified major health consequences of climate change \nand devised research agenda to obtain strategies to cope these challenges.  \n3.2  Indian Literature on Climate Change \nPanda (2009) discusses the consensus on the definition of vulnerability to climate \nchange and the regionally-nuanced mapping of the variable impact of climate change. \nThe  author  opines  that  despite  considerable  advances  in  the  methodologies  for \nassessing vulnerability to climate change, ambiguities and uncertainties nevertheless \nremain.  According  to  the  author,  vulnerability  research  is  facing  challenges  in  \nthree areas. First, climate change is not the only stress that society faces: multiple \nstressors operate in all the human environment systems. It is therefore a challenging \ntask for researchers to identify and evaluate those stressors most relevant for assessing \nclimate change vulnerability. Second, vulnerability assessment requires characterization \nof the future in terms of socioeconomic and biophysical variables; however, uncertainties \nabout  the  future  make  vulnerability  assessment  that  much  \nmore difficult and challenging. Third, the apparent lack of consistency in the use and \nmeaning of the variety of concepts employed in vulnerability research contributes to \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nincreasing  confusion  in  this  area.  The  author  feels  that  the  research  in  India  on \nvulnerability to climate change is still underdeveloped. Further research is urgently \nrequired in several areas. This research has to be based on an understanding of the \nregional and micro-level aspects of climate change to properly address the vulnerability \nof people with more accuracy. \nIn a commentary, Kumar (2007) has discussed the existing literature on the effect of \nclimate change on Indian agriculture, covering three strands of assessment: impact, \nvulnerability, and adaptation. The author finds that the economic impact of climate \nchange on agriculture has been studied extensively the world over and it remains a hotly \ndebated research problem. Papers based on the two approaches to assessing the \neconomic impact\u2014namely, the agronomic- economic and the Ricardian approach\u2014are \ndiscussed by the author. Using these approaches, it is observed that the GDP for the \nIndian economy is expected to decline due to climate change in the latter half of the \ntwenty-first century.  \nKapur, Khosla, and Mehta (2009) summarize extracts from the papers presented at a \nconference on climate change held in New Delhi in March 2009 focused on the different \nbargains India might have to strike, both domestically and internationally. The conference \nwas meant to address the options that India will have to exercise to maintain its growth \nand  emerge  as  a  global  superpower.  The  authors  summarize  \nthe  papers  presented  at  the  conference  and  conclude  that  climate  change  poses \nparticularly difficult challenges for India. On the one hand, India does not want any \nconstraints on its development prospects; on the other, it wants to be seen as an \nemerging global power. While the former may be best served by its current position, the \nlatter will require it to take a leadership role on key global issues, climate change being \na critical one. It can either approach climate change as a stand-alone global negotiation, \nor  weave  these  negotiations  into  a  \u201cgrand  bargain\u201d  involving  linkages  \nwith other international negotiations that also involve key Indian interests, whether \nreforms of the Security Council, World Trade Organization negotiations, the financial \narchitecture, etc. \nHanif et al. (2010) tried quantifying the impacts of changes in normal climate parameters \nfor the variable and sustainable development of the agricultural sector at both regional \nand  country  level.  The  study  confirms  the  premise  that  climate  change  impinges \nconsiderably upon agricultural production and the price of agricultural land. \nThe authors find that all the climate variables except maximum temperature have a highly \nsignificant relationship with land prices. Climate change is imposing a cost at the same \nthat it brings the benefit of an increase in land prices in Rabi season due to the increase \nin maximum temperature. Benefits show farmers\u2019 adaptation in the changing climate, \nwhich leads to an increase in long-run net revenues.  \nThe increase in precipitation in Kharif season tends to increase land value. The increase \nin precipitation in Rabi season results in a loss due to the decreased production. The \nincrease in mean minimum Rabi temperature, being negatively significant, imposes a \ncost on the agricultural sector with increase an in temperature in this season. \nThe authors conclude that the aggregate global effects on agricultural productivity are \nexpected to be negative by late this century, and developing countries are expected to \nsuffer sooner and worse. \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nKumar, Shyamsundar, and Nambi (2010) provide a summary of the discussions held \nduring a 2010 workshop on the economics of climate change adaptation and draw some \nconclusions for future policy analyses. Given the possibility of moderate or catastrophic \nclimate  change  in  developing  countries  and  the  failure  of  the  climate  summit  in \nCopenhagen in December 2009 to achieve any consensus on greenhouse gas mitigation \nplans, adaptation as a policy option requires careful attention. This is a report on the said \nworkshop that examined India's need to adapt to climate change. \nThe article by Sharma (2012) reviewed literature on the impacts on human health of \nclimate change and land use transition in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, \nspecifically dealing with topics such as the relationship between climate change and \nhealth; health sensitivity, vulnerability, and adaptation; health determinants related to \nclimate change; temperature extremes and health issues; air pollution, black carbon, and \nhealth; food security, nutrition, and health; land use change and infectious diseases; and \npopulation migration and livelihood transition. The article outlines an agenda for future \nresearch on climate change and human health for the HKH region. The author suggests \nthree main agendas: first, developing methods to quantify the current impacts of climate \nand weather on a range of health outcomes for people living both in the mountains and \ndownstream; second, improving health impact models for projecting the health impacts \nof climate and land use change under different ecological and socioeconomic conditions; \nand third, evaluating the costs of the projected health impacts of climate change and the \neffectiveness of adaptation for policy inputs. \nThe Joint Global Change Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific \nNorthwest Division (2009) identifies and summarizes the latest peer-reviewed research \nrelated  to  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  India,  drawing  on  both  the  literature \nsummarized  in  the  latest  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) \nassessment  reports  and  on  other  peer-reviewed  research  literature  and  relevant \nreporting. It includes such impacts as sea-level rise, water availability, agricultural shifts, \necological  disruptions  and  species  extinctions,  infrastructure  at  risk  from  extreme \nweather events (severity and frequency), and disease patterns. This paper addresses \nthe extent to which regions within India are vulnerable to climate change impact.  \nMenon et al. (2016) studied fishermen\u2019s perceptions of climate change from two coastal \ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh during 2011. Fishermen were interviewed to ascertain their \nperception of climate change over the last 20 years, the impact of the change in climatic \nparameters on their lives and on marine fisheries, and the adaptation measures required. \nAll fishermen contacted believed that the climate had changed in the last two decades. \nWind was ranked as the parameter that had changed the most in the last two decades, \nwhile sea status was ranked as the most problematic to fishermen. Avenues for a safe \nexit from villages and coastal protection structures in case of natural calamities were the \nhighest scoring adaptation measures. Wind was considered the most critical parameter \naffecting marine fishery and overfishing was identified as the biggest problem facing \nfisheries. \nRuchita and Rohit (2017) estimate the impact of climate change on food grain yields in \nIndia, namely rice and millet. The authors estimate a crop-specific agricultural production \nfunction with exogenous climate variables, namely precipitation and temperature, and \ncontrol for key inputs such as irrigation, fertilizer, and labor. The analysis is at the district \nlevel using a panel dataset for physical yield (output per hectare gross cropped area) for \nthe  period  1966\u20131999.  The  paper  finds  significant  impacts  of  climate  change \n(temperature  and  precipitation)  on  Indian  agriculture.  \nFor rice, the evidence is overwhelmingly that both rainfall and temperature matter,  \nbut  so  do  other  inputs\u2014labor,  fertilizer,  and  irrigation.  For  millet,  rainfall  is  the  \nsole determinant.  \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nKumar, Jawale, and Tandon (2008) look at the impacts of climate change on the financial \ncapital of India, Mumbai. These include the impact of temperature rise on rains and \nfloods, and their consequent effects on health. Other consequences, such as a rise in \ndeaths from vector-borne diseases, dislocation due to floods, and sea-level rise, are \nshown as projected economic losses for the years 2025 and 2050. The economic costs \nof sea-level rise in terms of loss of property along the coastline are also projected for a \n25- and 50-year timescale. The costs arising due to increases in malaria, diarrhea, and \nleptospirosis outbreaks are projected up to 2050. The conservative estimate of the total \ncost of all these impacts, including the impact of climate change on tourism, is found to \nbe enormous. \nSinha and Swaminathan (1991) and Kalra et al. (2008) argue that crop production in \nIndia is dependent on temperature. Temperature vs. crop production shows a funnel \nshape for all seasons. For the lower temperature, the properties are almost linearly \ncorrelated.  In  Rabi,  production  initially  shows  a  negative  trend  with  temperature  \nwhich slowly converts to a positive trend. In Kharif, that negative trend is not visible. At \nhigher temperatures, production increases for both the seasons but with large variations. \nThese  findings  may  be  helpful  for  studying  the  effect  of  climate  change  on  crop \nproduction. \n4.  GOVERNMENT OF INDIA POLICIES \n4.1  Indian Initiatives for Climate Protection \nVarious programs have been adopted across the globe to protect the environment. One \nsuch program is the Global Environment Facility (GEF), established as a pilot program \nfor environmental protection. The current project cycle is GEF-6, covering the years \n2014\u20132018. In 1992 at Rio de Janeiro it was decided that the GEF would be adopted as \na financial mechanism to help developing countries meet their financing needs to achieve \ntheir climate change goals. As of November 2015, the GEF has directly invested a total \nof  $14.5  billion  in  3,946  projects  in  167  countries,  of  which  \n$4.2 billion is in 1,010 projects for climate change mitigation. To date, India has received \n$516.6 million of GEF grant, of which $324.69 million is for climate change mitigation \nprojects while $10 million is for climate change adaptation projects. \nIn addition, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was adopted as a mitigation \ninstrument under the Kyoto Protocol. At present, the CDM is facing its most severe crisis, \nhaving witnessed a steady decline in the number of projects being registered since 2013 \nowing to the crash in the price of certified emissions reduction (CER) after 2012. As of \nJanuary 2016, 1,593 of a total of 7,685 projects registered by the CDM executive board \nare from India, the second highest in the world, the PRC taking the lead with 3,764 \nregistered projects. Indian projects have been issued with 191 million CERs, 13.27% of \nthe total number of CERs issued. These projects are in energy efficiency, fuel switching, \nindustrial processes, and the municipal solid waste, renewable energy, and forestry \nsectors, and are spread across the country. Around 90%\u201395% of the CDM projects are \nbeing developed by the private sector, facilitating investments of about 583,751 crores \n($ 87.77 billion) in the country, which is more than the total of multilateral grants available \nfor climate change-related activities. \nApart from these international measures, the Government of India has also taken some \ninitiatives domestically. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) is known \nto be the major component of India\u2019s domestic action against climate change. The \nNAPCC has proposed a waste-to-energy mission which will incentivize efforts toward \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nharnessing energy from waste and is aimed at lowering India\u2019s dependence on coal, oil, \nand gas for power production. The National Mission on Coastal Areas (NMCA) will \nprepare an integrated coastal resource management plan and map vulnerabilities along \nthe entire (nearly 7,000 km long) shoreline.  \nThe State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) has also been introduced to create \ninstitutional capacity and implement sectoral activities to address climate change. These \nplans are focused on adaptation with mitigation as a co-benefit in sectors such as water, \nagriculture, tourism, forestry, transport, habitat, and energy.  \nA National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) has been established with a \nbudget provision of 1,350 crore for the year 2015\u20132016 and 2016\u20132017. It is meant to \nassist in meeting the cost of national and state level adaptation measures in areas that \nare particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. \nTo reduce the consumption of coal, India has introduced carbon tax in the form of a cess \non coal. The National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) is supported by the cess on coal. The \nNCEF was created for the purposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives, \nfunding research in the area of clean energy and any other related activities. \nThe  Perform,  Achieve,  and  Trade  (PAT)  scheme  under  the  National  Mission  on \nEnhanced Energy Efficiency was introduced by the Indian government as an instrument \nfor reducing specific energy consumption in energy-intensive industries with a market-\nbased mechanism that allows trading of the energy saving certificate. The first PAT cycle, \nwhich  ended  on  31  March  2015,  included  478  industrial  units  in  \neight sectors. \nIndia has also started progressing on the renewable energy front. Renewable energy \nhas become a major focus area of the government, with the ambitious target of achieving \n40% cumulative electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. \nIndia is currently undertaking the largest renewable energy capacity expansion program \nin the world. \nThe Prime Minister of India launched the ISA at COP 21 in Paris on 30 November 2015. \nThe ISA will provide a special platform for mutual cooperation among 121 solar resource-\nrich countries lying fully or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. \nThe Secretariat of the ISA will be hosted by India. \nAnother major renewable energy policy initiative is the National Offshore Wind Energy \nPolicy 2015 to help offshore wind energy development, including the setting up of \noffshore wind power projects and research and development activities in waters in or \nadjacent to the country up to the seaward distance of 200 nautical miles\u2019 exclusive \neconomic zone (EEZ) of the country from the base line. (Mainly drawn from Economic \nSurvey 2017). \n5.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nThis chapter attempts to provide an analytical description of how forces of globalization\u2014\nprimarily trade and FDI\u2014have impacted the environment in India. Unfortunately, as \nstated earlier, specific literature on the topic does not contain a significant number of \nworthwhile research initiatives from an analytical and holistic perspective. We have tried \nto  impress  upon  the  readers  that  the  direct  impact  of  \ntrade and FDI on environmental conditions is less of an issue compared to its indirect \neffect through its positive impact on GDP growth and resultant prosperity. We also \nemphasize  that  enforcing  regulations  is  presently  a  hugely  complex  task  given \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \ncorruption, informal markets, and the inability of citizens to cooperate and form effective \nlobbies. We have tried to give simple, readable theoretical inputs and examples. We \nhave provided original time series estimates of the impact of trade and FDI on the \nenvironment over the last three and a half decades. We have then elaborated briefly on \nglobal climate change research and its Indian counterpart to provide a perspective for \nour work, followed by  a brief summary of  recent policy initiatives from the Indian \ngovernment. \nWe believe that more specific research is needed to assess the environmental impact of \npatterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better \nscientific measuring of the damage and focuses on the impact of climate change on \ninequality  (Hsiang  et al.  2017;  Pizer  2017). Clearly,  warmer  regions  in  the  globe, \nincluding India and many developing and Asian countries, are affected more than their \nnorthern counterparts by global warming. In fact, recent US estimates show that climate \nchange has increased inequality between the north and the south of the US; the pattern \nof  production  specialization  is  generally  induced  by  the  conditions  of  \nglobal trade and investment, and by the physical infrastructural support. India and the \nPRC, the two largest countries in Asia, have very different GDP composition. This poses \nthe question of whether excessive industrialization, coupled with the usual transboundary \nand  climate  concerns,  makes  the  PRC  more  vulnerable  than  India,  which  thrives \nexcessively  on  service  sector  growth  and,  in  turn,  gets  the  benefit  of  \nlow pollution growth. This also calls for serious exploration of green accounting and \npreparation of a database with better environmental indicators, as extensively discussed \nin Sengupta (2013). \n \n   \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 873  Marjit and Yu \n \nREFERENCES \nAcharyya, J.

However, trade seems to have an inversely proportional relationship, consistent with the view that India\u2019s imports are mostly manufactured items that may involve polluting production process and are currently being produced outside India. We believe more specific research is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of patterns of production and consumption. Recent scientific analysis focuses on better scientific measures of the damage and impact of climate change and its effect on inequality. Clearly, warmer regions around the globe, including India and many developing Asian countries, will be affected more than their northern counterparts due to global warming. In fact, recent estimates show that climate change has increased inequality in the United States between the north and the south. Patterns of production are generally induced by the conditions of global trade and investment and by physical infrastructural support and local resources. India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the two largest countries in Asia, have very different GDP compositions. This poses the question of whether excessive industrialization coupled with the usual transboundary and climate concerns make the PRC more vulnerable than India, which thrives on service sector growth and in turn benefits from the low pollution content of growth. This also calls for serious exploration of green accounting and the preparation of databases with better environmental indicators. It will be worthwhile to explore the effect of liberalization on other climatic aspects, such as water pollution and land salinity, with the help of large scientific databases.", "Title": "Globalization and Environment in India"}}
