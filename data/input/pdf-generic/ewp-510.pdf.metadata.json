INTRODUCTION \n \nFinancial crises have been relatively frequent over the last half century, despite continual efforts\u2014\nespecially  since  the  1997/98  Asian  financial  crisis\u2014to  promote  financial  stability  and  enhance \nprudential supervision (Zamorski and Lee 2015a). The 2008/09 global financial crisis (GFC) showed \nthe inadequacy of purely prudential surveillance systems; and the need for bank supervisors to better \ndetect the buildup of systemic macroeconomic risks before they threaten the financial system (Lee, \nAsuncion, and Kim 2016). To help prevent future crises, financial authorities require a large set of \nfinancial reforms, which include both international and domestic macroprudential policies (Claessens \nand Kodres 2015). \n \nMorgan (2013) emphasized the need for a macroprudential approach that helps identify \nlooming systemwide risks. He noted that the microprudential approach in financial  regulation is \ninadequate\u2014because they focused more on individual institutions, supervisors worldwide failed to \nrecognize the interconnections across financial firms, sectors, and markets. Acting appropriately on \npredetermined financial vulnerabilities using a macroprudential approach can reduce the probability \nand severity of future financial crises (Hannoun 2010). \n \nMacroprudential policy primarily aims to identify, contain, and prevent the buildup of systemic \nrisk. In contrast with the traditional microprudential approach, macroprudential policies cover the \nfinancial system as a whole, including interactions between the financial and real sectors, as well as the \npossible spillover effects on other economies. Several macroprudential tools exist for authorities to \ncalibrate  to  address  identified  systemic  risk.  Lim  et  al.  (2011)  classified  frequently  used \nmacroprudential instruments related to three broad categories: (i) credit, (ii) liquidity, and (iii) capital. \nRecently,  Lee,  Asuncion,  and  Kim  (2016)  presented  an  empirical  framework  for  analyzing  how \neffectively  macroprudential  policies  control  credit  growth,  leverage  growth,  and  housing  price \nappreciation. Their results showed that macroprudential policies promote financial stability in Asia\u2014\nand more specifically, which types of macroprudential policies have proved effective for various \nmacroeconomic risks. Macroprudential authorities, however, need to ensure instruments are used \nappropriately given the complementarities and possible conflicts with, for example, monetary and \nfiscal policies that aim for the same end goal. Central banks, governments, and policy coordinating \nbodies all play important roles in macroprudential policy making.  \n \nThe  GFC  also  underscored  the  need  to  establish  a  stronger  macroprudential  policy \nframework\u2014one more responsive to an increasingly dynamic global financial environment. Systemic \nrisks pre-GFC were fueled, among other factors, by a lack of understanding of the risks accompanying \ninnovative  financial  products.  Over  the  last  decade,  developing  Asia  has  seen  greater  financial \nintegration as its financial interlinkages have widened. As the region becomes more interconnected, a \nkey priority is to ensure that this is supported by regulatory and supervisory regimes that adequately \ncontrol related risks to financial stability (Zamorski and Lee 2015a). More integrated economies \nrequire  better  coordinated  and  potentially  consistent  macroprudential  policies  to  avoid  negative \nspillovers that could counteract the objective of promoting financial stability (Const\u00e2ncio 2015).  \n \nWithin  the  context  of  global  financial  developments,  how  should  macroprudential  policy \nframeworks be structured and improved in developing Asian economies with high growth potential \nsuch as Cambodia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam? These will have direct implications \non their financial systems\u2014which would be expected to become more complex. Addressing key issues \nand improving existing macroprudential policy frameworks warrant careful attention. Not only do they \naim to prevent the buildup of systemic risks that could result in financial crisis, but are ultimately ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nanchored on the end goal of ensuring the financial stability required to support sustainable, inclusive \neconomic growth and development. \n \nSection II of this paper presents a general macroprudential policy framework highlighting \nvarious key aspects. Section III highlights the experiences of selected Asian economies, New Zealand \nand  the  euro  area  in  implementing  macroprudential  measures.  Section  IV  reviews  existing \nmacroprudential  policy  frameworks  in  Cambodia,  Mongolia,  Myanmar,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam, \nidentifying challenges and areas where improvements could be made, while section V concludes.  \n \n \nII.  KEY ASPECTS IN A GENERAL MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY FRAMEWORK \n \nA stable financial system boosts investments and contributes to sustainable economic growth and \ndevelopment. But a global financial environment with greater cross-border financial linkages pose \nanother challenge to developing economies with less developed financial systems\u2014where capital \nmarkets are still developing and deepening, and banks typically play an important role in providing \naffordable credit to businesses and consumers. Effective bank regulation and supervision is therefore \ncritical to ensure that sound, stable, and resilient banks are well positioned to meet the credit needs of \ntheir customers and allow depositors to accumulate savings, which also provides a stable funding \nsource for loan portfolio growth (Zamorski and Lee 2015b). \n \nTo  do  this,  economies  in  developing  Asia  need  to  strengthen  their  macroprudential \nframeworks.  A  new  legal  framework  for  macroprudential  policy  should  be  established  across \neconomies to equip macroprudential authorities with a set of concrete policy instruments. Likewise, \nthey need to ensure their macroprudential policy framework is in tune with macroeconomic policies \nand microprudential supervision. \n \nSaito  (2014)  cited  four  pillars  of  macroprudential  policy  that  should  be  strengthened: \n(i) collecting information on risks to the financial system, (ii) analyzing and assessing that information, \n(iii) designing and making institutional arrangements to manage risks, and (iv) establishing institutions \nand implementing policy to address the risks and their consequences.1  \n \nA.  Institutional Aspect \n \nThe effectiveness of macroprudential policy measures depends on an institutional structure with \nclearly defined roles and powers of relevant authorities. This can prevent conflicts or tensions while \nguaranteeing transparency and accountability. In most Asian economies, the financial stability role of \nspecific agencies has a legislative mandate with explicit objectives and powers (Table 1). Clearly, \ncentral banks typically hold the primary role of advocating and maintaining financial stability. \n \nThe lead authority or agency for macroprudential policy making, its defined objectives and \ndelineation of functions, powers, and responsibilities must all be clearly specified by law (Krishnamurti \nand Lee 2014). Macroprudential policy decisions are more binding and their accountability structure \nmore clear under a macroprudential policy framework with strong legal foundations. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   Saito (2014) emphasized the need for close cooperation and coordination among relevant agencies.

Krishnamurti and Lee (2014) emphasized that the macroprudential authority \nshould be equipped with (i) a clear mandate to promote financial stability, (ii) independence and \nadequate resources, and (iii) the power to define its oversight perimeter and to initiate or require \npolicy responses when warranted. \n \nIMF-FSB-BIS  (2016)  identified  at  least  four  prerequisite  powers  for  the  macroprudential \nauthority  to  fulfill  its  mandate:  (i)  obtain  information  from  other  authorities  and  fill  data  gaps \n(information power), (ii) influence the activation and calibration of regulatory constraints (calibration \npower), (iii) influence the designation of individual institutions as systemically important (designation \npower), and (iv) initiate changes in the regulatory perimeter to capture financial institutions whose \nactivities may increase financial stability risk. \n \nEstablishing a clear decision-making framework and flow is another important consideration in \ndesigning a macroprudential governance structure. The design should ensure that the macroprudential \nauthority can perform its functions and responsibilities independent and unbiased from financial \nmarket and political interference. \n \nEconomies may choose from two general governance structures. The first\u2014the central bank \nstructure\u2014mandates  the  central  bank  to  lead  macroprudential  policy  making  (Figure  1).  Osi\u0144ski \n(2013)  and  Duncan  and  Nolan  (2015)  both  agree  that  central  banks  should  take  the  lead  in \nmacroprudential policy. Central banks possess the necessary skills and expertise in systemic risk \nidentification; and its political independence will guarantee better and efficient use of macroprudential \ntools. This setup is common in economies where supervisory and regulatory functions or powers lie \nunder central bank authority. \n \nThis structure is adopted in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, among others. Aside from \nbank supervision, macroprudential policy making is assigned to central banks through a dedicated \ncommittee. The central bank governor chairs the committee with deputy governors responsible for \nmonetary policy, financial stability, and microprudential supervision as members. \n \n \n ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nFigure 1: The Central Bank Structure\n \nGovernor\nDeputy  Deputy \nGovernor - Governor -\nMonetary  Financial \nStability A Central  Stability\nBank Board \nCommittee as \nmacroprudential \nauthority\nDeputy \nMinistry of  Governor -\nFinance Banking \nSupervision\nIndependent \nmembers of \nthe Board\n \n \nSource: Krishnamurti, Damodaran, and Yejin Carol Lee. 2014. \u201cMacroprudential \nPolicy Framework: A Practice Guide.\u201d Washington, DC: World Bank. \n \nThe  second  structure  uses  a  governance  model  where  the  central  bank  is  not  the \nmicroprudential supervisor, but nonetheless is in a better position to carry out the role  of lead \nmacroprudential agency (Figure 2). This model, however, requires closer coordination and cooperation \nbetween the central bank and the prudential supervisor (Krishnamurti and Lee 2014). An interagency \nbody  is  typically  established  within  the  central  bank,  and  allows  the  participation  of  separate \nsupervisory agencies and external experts on the decision-making committee, drawing on different \npolicy-making perspectives (IMF-FSB-BIS 2016). The People\u2019s Republic of China, the Republic of \nKorea, Japan, and Australia are among the countries using this kind of institutional setup. \n \nFigure 2: The Committee or Council Structure\n \nCentral \nBank\nCapital \nBank \nmarkets \nsupervisor\nsupervisor\nA committee of \nrepresentatives as \nDeposit  macroprudential  Insurance \ninsurer or  authority and \nresolution  pensions \nauthority supervisor\nOther \nMinistry of  financial \nFinance sector \nsupervisors\n \n \nSource: Krishnamurti, Damodaran, and Yejin Carol Lee. 2014. \u201cMacroprudential \nPolicy Framework: A Practice Guide.\u201d Washington, DC: World Bank. ", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   5 \nEgawa,  Otani,  and  Sakiyama  (2015)  explained  that  the  choice  of  governance  structure \ndepends on various factors such as economic and financial characteristics, exchange rate regime, and \ndegree of democracy. Their quantitative analysis shows that advanced economies are more likely to \nadopt the committee structure (where coordination is done by government), while the central bank \nstructure is the majority choice among emerging market economies.  \n \nHow macroprudential policy is carried out depends on the institutional arrangement as well as \nthe powers each component wields. One must consider whether the macroprudential policy will be \nsubject to a rule-based framework for effective implementation or will be conducted under the sole \ndiscretion  of  the  macroprudential  authority.  Gadanecz  and  Jayaram  (2015)  note  that,  though \ntransparent and easy to communicate, a rule-based approach may not be appropriate when changes in \nthe institutional setup result from new policies. Authorities may need some policy discretion, especially \nwhen information is rather limited.  \n \nRegardless of institutional structure, macroprudential authorities should ensure that mitigation \nmeasures against possible pitfalls are in place and should be accountable for any decisions made to \ncorresponding legislative bodies or the general public. \n \nB.  Macroprudential Indicators: Risk Detection and Assessment \n \nCentral to the foundation of a macroprudential policy framework is to be able to identify risks and \nprevent any buildup that may harm financial stability. These risks include disruptions to financial \nservices such as credit intermediation, risk management, and payment services that reflect deficiencies \nin the financial system.  \n \nRisks can be amplified by financial cycles as well as the increasing complexity of financial \ninstitutions and markets. Macroprudential policy must be able to address the tendency of financial \nvariables to fluctuate around a trend throughout a financial system\u2019s cycle\u2014its time dimension. And it \nmust aim to address common exposures and interlinkages among financial institutions in addressing \naggregate risk as the structure of the financial system deepens\u2014its cross-sectional dimension.  \n \nThere is no better approach to macroprudential policy than to ensure early detection of \nemerging systemic risks. That way the macroprudential authority will be able to act quickly to mitigate \nor contain risk and prevent a crisis developing. Building the capability for early risk detection is not \neasy, however. Macroprudential surveillance requires monitoring the behavior of broad aggregate \nnumbers to identify potential vulnerabilities that might affect the whole financial system (Yam 2006). \nIt requires a great deal of information and data from various sources that can be continuously analyzed \nand  assessed.  Aside  from  identifying  looming  risks,  these  early  warning  indicators  also  guide \nmacroprudential policy makers on the timing of when to apply and when to remove macroprudential \nmeasures. \n \nWolken (2013) identified five features of a good indicator. It must be relevant, accurate, \ncollectable, comprehensive and dynamic, and forward looking. Authorities should prioritize identifying \nand monitoring indicators that reflect their financial system structure, and ensure the required data is \nboth readily available and accurate. Indicators that allow monitoring nonbank segments of the financial \nsystem are essential to form a more holistic view of the system. Caruana (2010) suggested expanding \nthe  scope  of  macroprudential  surveillance  to  cover  unregulated  state-owned  financial  entities, \ndevelopment finance institutions, finance companies, and hedge funds, among others; as well as those \nless regulated, like credit unions, microfinance institutions, cooperative banks, mutual funds, and \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \npension funds. Meanwhile, an indicator must be forward looking to provide an early warning of budding \nfinancial stress that may require policy action. \n \n1.  Database Construction and Management for Macroprudential Indicators \n \nMacroprudential policy decisions must be based on relevant, and reliable information. Thus, building a \ndatabase  covering  several  financial  and  macroeconomic  indicators  is  needed  for  quick,  in-depth \nassessment and analysis. \n \nIn  the  euro  area,  for  example,  the  European  Central  Bank  maintains  a  macroprudential \ndatabase  handling  a  comprehensive  and  harmonized  data  set  of  indicators  that  cover  various \nsubmodules of variables relevant for macroprudential analysis.2 In New Zealand, the Reserve Bank of \nNew Zealand updates key macroprudential indicators quarterly\u2014known as chart pack\u2014to aid in its \nassessment of the financial system and its policy actions. The chart pack includes information on credit \nand asset prices, bank leverage and risk taking, funding and liquidity, financial market conditions, \nhousing  market  imbalances,  household  balance  sheet  stretch,  lending  standards,  farm  market \nimbalances, farm balance sheet stretch, commercial property imbalances, business balance sheet \nstretch, and some aggregate indicators such as credit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) gaps, among \nothers. \n \n2.  Creating a Structured List of Macroprudential Indicators \n \nIndicators must be able to determine the type of risks that could threaten financial system soundness. \nFor the banking sector, the elements of solvency risk, funding risk, and currency risk are among the \nleading indicators monitored. To get a broader view, authorities also monitor elements of risks outside \nbanking, including household and corporate indebtedness or leverage, mortgage, securitization, and \ncredit derivatives markets, along with the size of unhedged foreign currency exposure outside the \nfinancial system. Appendix 1 presents a list of indicators authorities might track, categorized by source \nof risk. \n \nOnce indicators are chosen and monitored, the next step is to set warning thresholds to \nidentify risk buildup and trigger thresholds that signal when to activate macroprudential measures. In \nsetting thresholds, policy makers need to consider the inherent trade-off between missing crises (if \nthresholds are set too high) and receiving false alarms (if thresholds are set too low) (ESRB 2014). \n \n3.  Quantitative Methods for Analyzing Macroprudential Indicators \n \nWhile individual indicators may partially reflect certain imbalances in the financial system, it helps to \nassess the system\u2019s soundness using a composite of related indicators. Combining information from \nmultiple indicators can provide better and stronger signals of a buildup of vulnerabilities and risks \n(ESRB 2014). Authorities often construct risk maps based on composite indexes of relevant indicators \ncovering  several  dimensions  of  financial  soundness\u2014such  as  profitability,  leverage,  liquidity,  and \nturnover, among others. To construct a composite index of related indicators, individual indicators are \nfirst converted into standard normal variables. The standardized variables are then bounded between \n                                                 \n2   These  include  variables  covering  macroeconomic  and  financial  markets,  debt  and  credit,  residential  real  estate, \ncommercial real estate, banks, nonbanks and those that define interconnectedness (for example, banks' interbank \nliabilities and derivative positions).

", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   7 \n0  and  1  using  relative  distance  transformation.  Related  indicators  are  aggregated  using  principal \ncomponent analysis. \n \nAside  from  risk  maps,  there  are  also  several  analytical  approaches  and  models  that  use \nmonitored  macroprudential  indicators.  Holopainen  and  Sarlin  (2016)  document  all  existing  early \nwarning models ranging from simple univariate and bivariate signaling to advanced machine-learning \nmethods such as k-nearest neighbors and neural networks, and the use of a model aggregation \napproach.3 An aggregation of bank-level logit model uses 11 indicators: leverage ratio, reserves to \nassets, interest expenses to liabilities, pretax income to assets, short-term investments to liabilities, \nfinancial assets to GDP, loans to deposits, issued debt to liabilities, house price gap, net international \ninvestment position, and 10-year yield. These kinds of formal procedures for quantitative analysis of \nsystemic  risks  remain  at  an  early  stage  in  developing  Asian  countries  like  Cambodia,  Mongolia, \nMyanmar, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Lack of data availability and technical capacity\u2014 macroprudential \nsurveillance remains in its infancy in these countries\u2014are major challenges in creating similar formal \nquantitative analysis. \n \nFor transparency, many economies publish financial stability reports that provide general \nassessments of the whole financial system, including any need for policy action. This is a biannual \nassessment of a country\u2019s financial soundness that identifies any potential risks to stability. Sri Lanka \nprepares a Financial System Stability Review that details the country\u2019s credit, liquidity, interest rate, \nand foreign exchange risks, along with capital adequacy, profitability, resilience to shocks, and the \ninsurance sector, among other general financial system conditions. Viet Nam\u2019s Financial Stability \nAssessment Program provides a comprehensive review of its financial system, specifically the banking \nsector, with accompanied policy recommendations that aim to improve financial system infrastructure \nand health. Mongolia is being assisted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in assessing the \ncountry\u2019s financial system through its Financial System Stability Assessment publication. Cambodia \nand Myanmar have yet to publish their own reports on general financial system conditions. \n \nC.  Systemically Important Financial Institutions \n \nIn terms of controlling and lowering the cross-sectional dimension of risk, systemically important \nfinancial institutions (SIFIs) play an important role. Bank examinations and offsite monitoring of bank \nsafety and soundness enable bank supervisors to detect and act to curtail excessive risk-taking, which \ncould threaten the stability of an individual bank (Zamorski and Lee 2015b). If a bank is large or \nprovides critical services, it may be considered an SIFI\u2014meaning problems at that institution could \nescalate or be of sufficient magnitude to affect the overall stability of the financial system. \n \nHannoun (2010) suggested several criteria that define SIFIs (sometimes referred to as the \u201ctoo \nbig to fail\u201d): \n \n(i)  size; \n(ii)  interconnectedness; \n(iii)  substitutability\u2014where services are critical to the smooth operation of the financial \nsystem, such as clearing and settlement; \n(iv)  concentration\u2014that indicates few, large players dominate a market for financial services; \nand \n                                                 \n3 See Holopainen and Sarlin (2016) for a more detailed discussion. \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \n(v)  common exposures\u2014where financial institutions may hold positions similar to \ncompetitors, suggesting a common shock could create distress at multiple institutions \nsimultaneously. \n \nThese characteristics stress the need for macroprudential policy to effectively handle SIFIs. \nHannoun (2010) also notes the associated moral hazard, suggesting the need to \u201cbail in\u201d shareholders \nand creditors rather than bail out SIFIs. \n \nD.  Macroprudential Stress Tests \n \nThe GFC spurred interest in conducting stress tests. But many consider microprudential stress tests \ninsufficient  to  expose  financial  system  vulnerabilities.  Thus,  general  principles  for  designing  and \nconducting macroprudential stress tests must be developed. This requires a more holistic view of the \nfinancial system. \n \nMacro  stress  testing  became  a  vital  component  of  macroprudential  surveillance  in  Asia \nthrough a joint program of the IMF and World Bank known as the Financial Sector Assessment \nProgram (FSAP).4 Macro stress testing enables economies to assess how the financial sector as a \nwhole responds to significant shocks such as interest rate and exchange rate movements. Gradually, \ncentral banks and monetary authorities in Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines modified some FSAP \ncomponents and conduct stress tests independently. In 2009, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka officially \nstarted quarterly stress tests (Siregar 2011). \n \nGreenlaw et al. (2012) lists essential elements of a macroprudential stress test (Table 2). To \ndesign more effective macroprudential stress tests, Demekas (2015) stressed the need to incorporate \ngeneral equilibrium dimensions where the outcome depends not only on the size of the shock and \nbuffers of individual institutions, but also on their behavioral responses and interactions with each \nother and other economic agents. \n \nTable 2: Elements of a Macroprudential Stress Test \n \nPurpose  The goal is to limit the likelihood and costs of aggregate fire sales, credit \ncrunches and systemic defaults. \nScope  The test examines the entire financial system. Any entity that contributes to \nfire sales, whose default has follow-on effects, or which can exacerbate a credit \ncrunch should be included. \nLiability considerations  Because a run can lead to a credit crunch or fire sale, the scale of wholesale \nfunding that is run-prone is paramount. Capital adequacy depends on the \nhealth of the overall financial system. \nAsset considerations  The test indicates whether the financial system is vulnerable to deleveraging \nthat might amplify adverse shocks. \nOutput  Develop guidance about whether to close a bank and when to sell its assets to \nmaximize taxpayer recovery. \nSource: Greenlaw, David, Anil K.

Macroprudential Policy Instruments \n \nAn effective macroprudential policy framework ensures the use of appropriate macroprudential policy \ninstruments  or  tools.  The  choice  of  measures  mainly  depends  on  the  risks  identified  and  its \nconsequences, notwithstanding other factors, including macroeconomic policies already in place. \n \nMacroprudential  policy  instruments  fall  into  three  broad  categories  depending  on \nmacroprudential objectives. First, to reduce risks from excessive credit or credit growth, authorities can \napply credit controls\u2014such as caps on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, caps on the debt-to-income \n(DTI) ratio, caps on foreign currency lending, and ceilings on credit or credit growth. Second, to \nconstrain funding or liquidity risks, liquidity-related instruments include limits on net open currency \npositions or currency mismatches, limits on maturity mismatches, and reserve requirements. And third, \nto build sufficient buffers to withstand the cycle, capital-related tools can include countercyclical \ncapital requirements, time-varying/dynamic positioning, and restrictions on profit distribution. Lim et \nal.  (2011)  summarize  a  conceptual  basis  for  different  macroprudential  policy  instruments \n(Appendix 2).  \n \nEssentially, authorities know financial stability cannot be achieved by macroprudential policy \nalone.  Macroprudential  policy  is  more  effective  when  complemented  by  other  macroeconomic \npolicies.  In  short,  macroprudential  policy  will  not  be  effective  if  it  compromises  existing \nmacroeconomic policies. For example, to constrain rapid real estate credit growth and asset price \ninflation, Singapore and Hong Kong, China imposed taxes on real estate transactions in conjunction \nwith lowering the LTV ratio (Lim et al. 2011). Hannoun (2011) offers a matrix on how to effectively \nintegrate policies (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Policy Areas and Contributions to Financial Stability \n \nPolicy Area  Primary Objective Financial Stability Objective \nPrudential  Limit distress of individual financial  Address systemic risk (cross section, \ninstitutions  over time) \nMonetary  Stabilize prices Lean against boom\u2013bust cycles in \ncredit and asset prices \nExchange rate  Stabilize exchange rate Reduce capital flow volatility \nFiscal  Manage demand countercyclically Maintain fiscal buffers that allow a \nresponse to financial system stress \nSource: Hannoun, Herv\u00e9. 2010. \u201cTowards a Global Financial Stability Framework.\u201d Speech delivered at the 45th SEACEN \nGovernors\u2019 Conference.

Hannoun (2010) emphasized symmetry in implementing policies, including \nmacroprudential policy\u2014which has an effect during both boom and bust phases of financial and \nbusiness cycles. This is particularly important when applying countercyclical macroprudential tools\u2014\nto build up capital buffers in good times that can be run down during bad times. To improve timing, \nauthorities need to develop a comprehensive framework to monitor macroprudential conditions and \nestablish appropriate warning and trigger thresholds. \n \nOther  considerations  in  choosing  macroprudential  tools  are  country  specific.  One  must \nconsider  the  structure  of  the  financial  system  and  its  complexity,  along  with  levels  of  financial \nintegration and openness, for example. Authorities may find different and better ways of implementing \npolicy measures. There is no single workable solution; no one size fits all measure. \n ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nIII.  MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY EXPERIENCES OF SELECTED COUNTRIES  \nAND REGIONS \n \nThis  section  describes  the  experiences  of  several  economies  and  regions  in  implementing \nmacroprudential policy measures that could offer some useful lessons for developing Asian economies \nin the process of building and improving their respective frameworks. \n \nA.  Republic of Korea \n \nThe Bank of Korea (BOK) is mandated to ensure financial stability in the revised 2011 Bank of Korea \nAct. This strengthens the BOK role in macroprudential policy making aside from its traditional role in \nsetting monetary policy. In response, the BOK established the Macroprudential Analysis Department \nwhich formulated a framework for monitoring macroprudential conditions. \n \nThe general macroprudential policy framework of the Republic of Korea requires an in-depth \nunderstanding of macroprudential conditions. Authorities take a holistic view of macroprudential \nconditions by considering both vulnerabilities and resilience\u2014the system\u2019s capacity to absorb shocks. \nThis approach helps define the policy direction macroprudential authorities take, particularly when \nactivating specific measures. The BOK\u2019s choice of tools to use is anchored on the assessment of \nmacroprudential conditions. \n \nThe  BOK  monitors  macroprudential  conditions  and  assesses  the  resilience  of  the  entire \nfinancial system through its Financial Stability Report (FSR) and Systematic risk assessment model for \nmacroprudential  policy  (SAMP).  The  FSR  provides  relevant  agencies  and  all  financial  market \nparticipants with essential information on the financial system. The FSR (i) analyzes and evaluates \npotential risk factors in the financial system, (ii) provides early warnings of increasing risks to policy \nauthorities and market participants, and (iii) enables the BOK to respond early to the accumulation of \nsystemic risk by suggesting policy alternatives as needed (Kim 2014). The BOK continues to refine the \navailable macroprudential tools to better reflect country-specific circumstances and advances in the \ncountry\u2019s financial structure. In addition, the BOK encourages feedback from external experts to \nfurther develop the quality of its reporting. \n \nMeanwhile, SAMP was developed to monitor financial resilience against external shocks by \nestimating macrorisk factors, bank profits and losses, and default and liquidity contagion losses from \nbank interconnectedness over multiple periods (Kim 2014) (Table 4). SAMP also analyzes the effects \nstemming  from  Basel III  regulations,  liquidity  provision  and  recapitalization  requirements;  and \nevaluates  domestic  systemically  important  banks by  measuring  individual  bank  contributions  to \nsystemic risk. The BOK has improved on the SAMP by, for example, adding an assessment module \nrelated to foreign currency liquidity risk, and is planning to develop a macrofinancial linkage module \nand expand coverage to nonbanks. \n \nThe  country\u2019s  macroprudential  policy  measures  are  designed  and  applied  in  response  to \nvarious sources of economic risks\u2014such as procyclicality of household and corporate lending and \nvolatility of capital flows, among others (Kim 2014). \n \nIn 2002, the Republic of Korea introduced an LTV ratio cap to counter risks associated with \ngrowth in mortgage loans; and after noting the limitations of LTV ratio regulation, a DTI ratio regulation \nwas introduced in 2005 (Appendix 3). Both measures are used flexibly depending on developments in \nhousing prices and mortgage lending. According to simulations by Kim (2013), LTV ratio and DTI ratio ", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   11 \nregulations  effectively  curb  increases  in  mortgage  loans  and  housing  prices  during  expansionary \nphases;5 and  by  empirical  analysis,  Lee,  Asuncion,  and  Kim  (2016)  showed  that  credit-related \nmacroprudential tightening such as caps on LTV and DTI ratios effectively reduce housing price \ninflation with lags, leverage growth, as well as dampened credit expansion.  \n \nTable 4: Elements of Systematic Risk Assessment Model for Macroprudential Policy \n \nModule  Activities/Elements \nMacrorisk factor module Estimation of joint probability distribution of macrorisk factors\nMacroeconomic model (BVAR) \nTime-varying volatility (GARCH) \nComovement and dependence (Copula) \nRisk modeling based on EVT \nBank profit and loss module  Credit or market losses\nInterest or noninterest income \nLoan loss provisions \nFundamental default \nDefault contagion module  Fire sale losses\nCredit crunch losses \nInterbank credit losses \nDefaults due to loss contagion \nFunding liquidity contagion module  Deleveraging or liquidity withdrawals\nFire sale losses \nCredit crunch losses \nHigher funding costs \nDefaults due to funding liquidity contagion \nMultiperiod module  Repeat measurement process until t+4period \nSystemic risk measurement module  Estimation of number of defaulting or distressed banks \nEstimation of loss distributions of individual banks or banking system \nBVAR = Bayesian vector autoregressive model, EVT = extreme value theory, GARCH =  generalized autoregressive \nconditional heteroskedasticity.  \nSource: Choongsoo, Kim. 2014. \u201cMacroprudential Policies in Korea: Key Measures and Experiences.\u201d https://www.banque-france.fr/ \nfileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/publications/Financial-Stability-Review-18_2014-04_Kim.pdf \n \nIn October 2010, the country introduced a foreign exchange-related measure by placing \nleverage  caps  on  banks\u2019  forex  derivatives  positions\u2014to  curb  risks  from  currency  and  maturity \nmismatches arising from excessive forex forward sales by companies. The leverage caps were initially \nset at 250% of capital for foreign bank branches and 50% for domestic banks, and were tightened later \nto  200%  and  40%,  respectively,  in  July  2011,  and  further  to  150%  and  30%  in  January  2013 \n(Appendix 3).

Thus, authorities developed its macroprudential policies to moderate financial stability risks, \nrecently with special focus on the housing market. \n \n  Singapore follows central structure approach where macroprudential policy making is assigned \nto  central  banks  through  a  dedicated  committee.  The  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS) \nregulates and supervises the financial system of Singapore and is responsible for both microprudential \nand macroprudential policies thru the Board-level Chair\u2019s Meeting, which the MAS Chair presides. \nMacroprudential  policy  making  in  Singapore  requires  a  great  deal  of  collaboration  with  relevant \nagencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Urban  Redevelopment  Authority  and  the  Housing \nDevelopment Board (IMF 2013). \n \nThe  MAS  has  developed  a  risk  assessment  methodology  for  all  financial  institutions\u2014the \nCommon Risk Assessment Framework and Techniques\u2014to evaluate institutional risk regardless of the \nfinancial services it provides. Common Risk Assessment Framework and Technique uses the main \nbusiness activities of the financial institution as basic units of risk assessment, which can be applied \nflexibly, yet consistently, to all types of financial institutions (MAS 2007). \n \nThe MAS conducts stress testing that measures portfolio, institution, or financial system \nsensitivity to exceptional but plausible shocks affecting banks and insurance. Also, the MAS applies \nmeasures to mitigate risk posed by the island\u2019s myriad foreign branches. For approving foreign entrants, \nit applies the same prudential qualifications as domestically incorporated banks. The MAS limits the \nnumber of foreign branches permitted to accept retail deposits and recently adopted a program that \nrequires qualifying banks with large retail operations to locally incorporate their business (IMF 2013). \n \nAlthough well regulated, some financial stability risks have emerged in recent years\u2014stemming \nfrom surging real estate prices that now surpassed their 2008 peaks (Lee, Asuncion, and Kim 2016). \nThere is concern these trends could rekindle inflation expectations and threaten financial stability, \nespecially given the ease of obtaining credit. Authorities continue to proactively respond to new \nsources of systemic risk, enhancing their surveillance and analytical frameworks for assessing the \nlikelihood and impact of emerging systemic risks (Lee, Asuncion, and Kim 2016). \n \nThe MAS has used several macroprudential instruments to mitigate systemic risks arising, in \nparticular, from the housing market (Appendix 4). Since 2009, the MAS has introduced a series of \nmeasures to ensure property market stability and to encourage financial prudence among borrowers \n(MAS 2016). Singapore tightened the limit on the ratio of mortgage service to income, capped the LTV \nratio, imposed an additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty, and increased the minimum cash down payment. \nThese measures largely target the more speculative market segments, but further tightening has been \nrecommended on the segment owned mainly by foreigners and permanent residents. The measures \n ", "16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nwere  found  to  have  been  broadly  successful  in  achieving  macroprudential  goals.  Housing  price \ninflation has moderated and housing affordability metrics remain contained. \n \nPrivate residential property prices have declined gradually\u2014overall prices declined on average \n0.9% each of 10 consecutive quarters from its peak in the third quarter of 2013. Transaction volumes \non new sales, resales and subsales dropped, improving the risk profile of housing loans. The stress tests \nconducted  by  the  MAS  reflect  the  resilience  of  the  general  banking  system  for  potential  sharp \ncorrections in property prices (MAS 2016). The effectiveness of its macroprudential policies can be \naffected by the degree of international financial integration. Singapore\u2019s highly developed and globally \ninterconnected  financial  system  with  a  large  foreign  bank  presence  makes  it  more  difficult  to \ncircumvent some macroprudential policies, but most measures have focused primarily on the property \nmarket\u2014that smoothed housing prices and credit expansion without damaging leverage growth. \n \nD.  Indonesia \n \nMacroprudential policy in Indonesia centers on monitoring vulnerabilities in the financial sector and \ndetecting potential shocks to financial system stability. Holding the macroprudential role, the Bank of \nIndonesia (BI) continuously develops early warning indicators using in-house research. Monitoring \nexercises support relevant authorities\u2019 decisions on which actions can best address identified potential \nfinancial disturbances. \n \nThe  Financial  Services  Authority  (Otoritas  Jasa  Keuangan,  or  OJK)  Law  provides  the \nmacroprudential policy framework and specifies that macroprudential supervision falls under the BI \n(FSB 2014).6 The OJK supervises financial institutions (including Indonesian banks and domestic \nbranch offices of foreign banks) and is mandated for microprudential assessments (Utari and Arimurti \n2012) (Table 8). \n \nTable 8: Agency Roles in Financial Stability \n \nAgency  Role\nBank Indonesia  Monetary policy and financial stability (macroprudential) \nFinancial Services Authority  Supervision of banks, nonbank financial institutions and capital \nmarkets (microprudential) \nIndonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation Deposit insurance system\nMinistry of Finance  Fiscal policy\nSource: Batunanggar, Sukarela. 2013. \u201cMacroprudential Framework and Measures: The Indonesian Experience.\u201d In \nMacroprudential Frameworks in Asia, edited by Rodolfo Maino, and Steven A.

The key question is how to balance price \nstability for sustainable growth while maintaining external and financial system stability\u2014all taking into \naccount highly volatile capital flows, exchange rates, and global commodity prices. This tripartite \nmacroeconomic challenge meant more efficient coordination to avoid conflicts between policies that \nmight weaken domestic demand (Lee, Asuncion, and Kim 2016). A mix of macroprudential and other \nmacroeconomic policies has helped deal with the multiple challenges of preserving monetary and \nfinancial system stability. Macroprudential measures alongside monetary and exchange rate policies \nhave  been  frequently  applied  since  2009.  Utari  and  Arimurti  (2012)  described  Indonesia\u2019s \nmacroprudential policy tools as measures (i)  imposed on a particular credit market, (ii) addressing \ncapital  flow  volatility,  (iii)  managing  domestic  liquidity,  and  (iv)  targeting  balance  sheet  size  or \ncomposition of banks and other financial institutions. \n \nTo help contain credit growth, the BI introduced macroprudential measures on property \nlending by tightening LTV ratio limits on mortgages for second and third residential properties in \nSeptember 2013 (Appendix 5). This was followed by the introduction of tighter regulations on motor \nvehicles. Phased increases in secondary and loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR)-linked reserve requirements \nwere also implemented (Batunanggar 2013).7  \n \nCaps on LTV ratios and minimum down payments for vehicle purchases slowed growth in \nhousing and auto loans. However, Batunanggar (2013) noted the potential diversion of credit to \nmultipurpose  loans.  Meanwhile,  Lee,  Asuncion,  and  Kim  (2016)  found  that  credit-related \nmacroprudential tightening measures had an immediate effect on credit expansion, while they had a \nlagged impact on leverage growth. On the other hand, liquidity-related macroprudential tightening \nmeasures had no effect on dampening housing prices, but they had an instantaneous effect on credit \nexpansion.  \n \nWhile current macroprudential measures appear adequate, Batunanggar (2013) recommends \nthat banks with large restructured loans or heavy exposure to export-related and property sectors be \nmore strictly monitored. \n \nE.  Euro Area \n \nThe GFC hit the euro area with huge economic losses (current GDP remains below its precrisis level \nand remains about 13% below its precrisis trend). Many important lessons were gleaned from the \ncrisis\u2014primarily shortcomings in financial supervision.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7   In September, the BI raised the secondary reserve requirement\u2014bank holdings of treasury and BI securities\u2014from 2.5% \nto 4%, to be phased in by December 2013; it also tightened the LDR-linked reserve requirement by lowering its \napplicability to banks with an LDR in excess of 92% (from 100%) and with a capital adequacy ratio of less than 14%.  \n ", "18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nAmid the crisis, the European Commission created the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) \nin 2009 to conduct macroprudential oversight. In 2010, the ESRB formed part of a new European \nSystem of Financial Supervision together with European Supervisory Authorities.8 The framework \nrequires participation of the European Central Bank and national central banks to ensure complete and \naccurate ESRB assessment of risks and information about financial system developments.  \n \nIn 2012, the ESRB proposed establishing national authorities with macroprudential mandates. \nIn  2013,  it  recommended  that  members  should  provide  macroprudential  authorities  the \nmacroprudential  instruments  capable  of  reaching  each  of  the  intermediate  objectives  of \nmacroprudential policy. The ESRB outlined four objectives of macroprudential policy to prevent or \nmitigate systemic risks: arising from (i) excessive credit growth and leverage, (ii) excessive maturity \nmismatch and market liquidity, (iii) direct and indirect exposure concentration, and (iv) misaligned \nincentives and moral hazard.   \n \nInstruments are identified by mapping them against the intermediate objectives (Table 9).

MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY FOR SELECT DEVELOPING ASIAN COUNTRIES \n \nAccording to IMF (2011), macroprudential policies had been successfully used in several emerging \nmarket economies well before crisis episodes. Lee (2015) summarized four Asian countries that \neffectively prevented or addressed threats to financial stability by applying macroprudential measures, \npointing  out  that  macroprudential  policies  were  specific  to  each  economy  given  their  different \ndomestic  circumstances.  A  set  of  different  policies  have  proven  effective  for  various  types  of \nmacroeconomic risks.  \n \nWhile the use of macroprudential policy tools is growing rapidly, some developing Asian \neconomies face greater challenges in establishing a macroprudential framework (Krishnamurti and Lee \n2014). All Asian economies should devote resources to better monitor and understand their overall \nfinancial  system  developments  (Posen  and  V\u00e9ron  2015)\u2014as  financial  instability  can  give  rise  to \neconomic  recession  (Hteik  2012).  To  complement  the  growth  potential  of  developing  Asian \neconomies,  it  is  essential  to  maintain  financial  soundness  and  sustainable  financial  growth  by \nestablishing appropriate macroprudential frameworks for each economy. \n ", "20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \n \nHere we examine  Cambodia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam, as they are \nexpected to follow a high growth path over the medium term. High growth expectations hold direct \nimplications on foreign capital flows as well as financial system requirements that may become sources \nof systemic risk. If left unchecked, growth potential may itself be at risk.  \n \nA.  Cambodia \n \nThe GFC prompted authorities to establish a higher standard of prudential regulation to better deal \nwith its developing banking operations and ultimately ensure financial stability. Several hurdles must be \ncrossed. \n \n1.  Institutional Arrangements  \n \nThere is still no formal legal basis that clearly defines the country\u2019s macroprudential policy framework. \nThe National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) proposed amendments to the Central Bank Law and Law on \nBanking  and  Financial  Institutions  to  clearly  annunciate  \ufb01nancial  stability,  including  the  role \nmacroprudential policy should play. The proposed amendment is being discussed at the council of \nministers. Once completed, the proposal will be sent to the National Assembly for endorsement (Pal \n2013). \n \nCurrently, the macroprudential policy role is shared between the NBC and the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance, with NBC playing the lead role. A \ufb01nancial stability committee and \ufb01nancial \nstability unit was established to support NBC. \n \n2.  Systemic Risks Monitored  \n \nCambodia\u2019s systemic risk assessment methodology is basic (Pal 2013). There has been no formal \nprocedure, no specific quantitative or qualitative model employed to review systemic risk, and no \nmacroprudential stress test used by the central bank.9 Currently, Cambodia monitors indicators seen \nto be the major sources of vulnerability\u2014from liquidity and solvency issues.10 Leading macroeconomic \nindicators such as financial deepening, inflation, and money supply are likewise regularly checked. The \ncountry focuses on systemically important banks  to identify systemic risk in the banking sector. \n \n3.  Instruments \n \nFor its part, the NBC acknowledges that the macroprudential measures being used are not \u201cadequately \ncomprehensive\u201d (NBC 2015b, 9). This might be partially due to the lack of better risk assessment \nmethodologies. This is an immediate concern as the country\u2019s banking system has rapidly developed \nboth in scope and scale of operations. As would be expected, credit growth has steadily increased \nsince 2013. \n \nCambodia is working to build a better macroprudential policy framework to maintain financial \nstability amid high growth expectations. Authorities are working to strengthen the implementation of \nprudential regulations, revising existing regulations, and issuing new ones (NBC 2015a). \n                                                 \n9   A sample stress test was conducted with assistance from the IMF; but there were questions about its effectiveness and \nusefulness (Pal 2013). \n10   These include liquidity coverage, sources of funds, solvency ratios, and nonperforming assets. ", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   21 \n \nPal (2013) briefly summarized macroprudential policy instruments already used: \n \n(i)  reserve requirements, which serve as both monetary policy and prudential tools, have \nproven to be effective in mitigating credit expansion and providing reserves for liquidity \nshortages within banking institutions; \n(ii)  LTV ratios to curb credit expansion and risk-taking behavior of banking institutions; \n(iii)  caps on credit to high-risk sectors were adopted in early 2008 during the credit and real \nestate bubble, but were abolished in early 2009 to ease credit flows and stimulate \ngrowth;  \n(iv)  monitoring currency and maturity mismatches as part of assessing currency and liquidity \nrisks; \n(v)  additional capital buffers and provisioning have also been adopted to improve loss-\nabsorbing  capacity  and  to  strengthen  banking  institution  positions  against  possible \nshocks, especially against the impact of the GFC.  \n \nNonetheless, Cambodia\u2019s macroprudential policy framework falls short of the fundamental \ncharacteristics  of  an  effective  framework\u2014lacking  a  formal  legal  basis  that  clearly  defines \naccountability and the improved technical capacity to apply an analytical approach to assessing the \nentire financial system and detect systemic risks. \n \nB.  Myanmar \n \nMyanmar has undergone substantial economic and financial reforms with its new government in their \npursuit to stimulate economic growth. Along this process of gearing their economy toward a market-\nbased system with a globally integrated financial sector will expose the country to external risks and \nvulnerabilities. Thus Myanmar must safeguard its financial system stability. \n \n1.  Institutional Arrangements  \n \nMyanmar\u2019s banking and nonbanking sectors are not yet fully developed (Hteik 2012).\u00a0The banking \nsystem is the most prominent and, as the core of its financial system, is the fulcrum of monetary policy. \nThe Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) is responsible for both monetary and financial stability as \nmandated  under  the  Central  Bank  of  Myanmar  Law  of  1990.  The  CBM  adopts  the  CAMELS \nframework\u2014an effective and simple supervisory framework comprising five components: (i) capital \nadequacy; (ii) asset quality; (iii) management soundness; (iv) earnings; (iv) liquidity; and (v) sensitivity \nto market risk.  \n \n2.  Instruments \n \nUnder CBM supervision, the banking department conducts onsite examinations and offsite monitoring \nto regulate banking operations. The CBM currently requires banks to (i) have minimum reserve \nrequirements of, for example, 10% of total deposits; (ii) maintain liquid assets against eligible liabilities \nof least 20%; (iii) keep risk-weighted assets less than 10 times the combined total of capital and \nreserves; and (iv) not lend more than 20% of their capital plus reserves to any single individual or \nenterprise (Hteik 2012).  \n \n \n \n ", "22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \n3.  Much Remains to Be Done \n \nFinancial stability will increasingly be an important catalyst for the country\u2019s economic development. \nThe government must continue to undertake financial sector reforms that best meet and support the \nchanging needs of the economy. \n \nC.  Viet Nam \n \nWith Viet Nam\u2019s growing international presence, increasing interconnectedness within the financial \nsystem and between banks and enterprises (ADB 2014), improving management of potential systemic \nrisk has gained urgency. \n \n1.  Institutional Arrangement \n \nSubstantial progress has been made to improve the country\u2019s macroprudential policy framework. \nDecree 156/2013/ND-CP, issued during the latter part of 2013, redefined the functions, tasks, powers, \nand organizational structure of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV). In February 2014, SBV established a \nMonetary and Financial Stability Department responsible for analyzing, assessing, and implementing \nmacroprudential policy, and introducing measures to prevent systemic risk in the financial system \n(ADB 2014). \n \n2.  Systemic Risks Monitored and Tools Implemented \n \nThe five general categories of risks being monitored include foreign currency exposure, credit, excess \nleverage, liquidity, and asset price risks. The SBV has mapped systemic risks to possible sources (Table 10). \n \nTable 10: Sources of Systemic Risks \n \nRisk  Sources\nForeign currency exposure risk Dollarization, currency mismatch\nCredit risk  Dollarization, high credit growth, interest rate \nvolatility \nExcessive leverage risk  Bank-dominant financial system, high credit \ngrowth \nLiquidity risk  Maturity mismatch, lack of confidence\nAsset price risk  Real estate loans, stocks-related loans\nSource: Nguyen, Do Quoc Tho. 2012. \u201cImplementing Macroprudential Policy: The Case of \nVietnam.\u201d https://www.imf.org/external/oap/np/seminars/2012/macroprudential/pdf/ \nIII5Tho.pdf \n \nTo contain risks from the sources identified, several macroprudential tools were used. To \naddress currency mismatches, limits or caps on open forex positions, foreign currency loans, and \ninterest rates on foreign currency-denominated deposits were implemented. To mitigate high risk-\ntaking  and  reduce  interest  rate  volatility,  SBV  sets  caps  on  interest  rates  on  Vietnamese  dong- \ndenominated deposits. Credit growth limits (particularly to preidentified sectors such as property and \nstocks) aimed to slow systemwide credit growth (Nguyen 2012). \n \nThese  macroprudential  measures,  according  to  Nguyen  (2012),  were  complemented  by \nappropriate monetary, microprudential, and structural policies. For example, to curb credit growth, \nmonetary policy on reserve requirements is applied together with selected macroprudential tool. ", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   23 \n3.  Effectiveness of Macroprudential Policy \n \nThere is limited empirical evidence of how effective macroprudential measures have been in Viet \nNam.  Nevertheless,  Nguyen  (2012)  noted  success  in  slowing  credit  expansion  (attributed  from \ndeclining  forex  loans),  decreasing  business  leverage,  deflating  asset  prices,  and  waning  currency \nmismatches, among others. \n \n4.  Further Developments Needed \n \nOther things are needed before a well-functioning framework for macroprudential policy is in place. \nThere should be a legal framework that clearly sets and defines the role macroprudential policy plays. \nImproved  systemic  risk  supervision  as  well  as  systemic  risk  detection  and  assessment  must  be \naccompanied by good available data. In addition, a clear communications strategy will be established \nas a financial stability report is prepared (IMF 2016). \n \nADB  technical  assistance  was  used  to  support  the  Monetary  and  Financial  Stability \nDepartment operations and help narrow identified gaps. The technical assistance seeks to improve the \nlegal  framework,  systemic  risk  detection  and  assessment,  mechanisms  for  intra-agency  and \ninteragency coordination and information exchange, and design options for instruments that best suit \nViet Nam\u2019s circumstances and current stage of financial sector development (ADB 2014).  \n \nThe institutional framework will benefit from a proposal to establish a Financial Stability \nCouncil, chaired by a deputy prime minister, to coordinate financial stability policies (IMF 2016). \n \nD.  Mongolia \n \nMongolia\u2019s economic reforms\u2014such as liberalizing capital flows and foreign trade, among others\u2014also \nopened the door for volatilities and possible contagion. The country faced financial vulnerabilities \nduring the GFC. The increasing procyclicality of systemic risks, rising credit growth, asset price booms \nand  banks\u2019  heightened  risk  appetite  all  point  to  the  country\u2019s  growing  need  to  improve  its \nmacroprudential policy framework. \n \n1.  Institutional Arrangement \n \nThe  current  framework  involves  close  coordination  between  the  Bank  of  Mongolia,  Financial \nRegulatory Commission, and the Ministry of Finance through a Financial Stability Council (FSC). The \nFSC holds the \u201cduty to agree on macroprudential policy measures critical for sustained long-term \neconomic growth and take coordinated measures.\u201d11 The FSC was established by a 9 May 2007 joint \ndecree by the Bank of Mongolia, the Ministry of Finance, and the Financial Regulatory Commission, \nwith the primary objective of safeguarding financial stability by determining and managing financial \nrisks. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11   It is specified under the Mongolian Parliament Resolution No. 58, \u201cApproving Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2012\u201d \neffective 30 November 2011. \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \n2.  Macroprudential Measures Implemented \n \nSukhee and Byambasuren (2016) listed several macroprudential measures introduced to avoid risks \nthat may cause financial instability. Macroprudential policy measures adopted in Mongolia are often \naimed at managing volatilities associated with capital flows. These include the following: \n \n(i)  increase in the liquidity ratio (18% to 25% in 2011), \n(ii)  increase in the capital adequacy ratio (12% to 14% for 5 systemic banks), \n(iii)  limits on exposure concentration (not to exceed 20% of a bank\u2019s capital), \n(iv)  limits on net open currency positions (not to exceed 15% of a bank\u2019s equity capital), \n(v)  limits on maturity mismatches, \n(vi)  setting a reserve requirement on all deposits, and \n(vii)  reducing provisioning in times of crisis. \n \n3.  Limitations Identified \n \nMaino, Imam, and Ojima (2013) deemed the legal foundations creating the FSC \u201crather ineffective\u201d \nand identified several shortcomings: (i) entities responsible for macroprudential policies are not clearly \nidentified; (ii) the FSC lacks a permanent secretariat, with only a limited number of persons at the \ncentral  bank  assigned  to  FSC  activities;  and  (iii)  a  weak  accountability  mechanism  as  FSC \nrecommendations and decisions will not hold the same legal stature as budget laws and the central \nbank law. \n \nE.  Sri Lanka \n \nResponsible for ensuring soundness of the country\u2019s financial system, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n(CBSL) undertakes surveillance and oversight of the entire financial system to limit systemic risks that \nmay lead to financial and economic crises (CBSL 2014). \n \nTo  effectively  carry  out  this  function,  the  Financial  System  Stability  Committee  was \nestablished in 2002, headed by the CBSL Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability, \nwith members from different CBSL departments. They meet once a month to assess the health, \nresilience, and risk landscape of the financial system, and submit a report (with recommendations) to \nthe Governor and the Monetary Board to aid in policy making. \n \n1.  Risk Assessment and Surveillance Mechanism \n \nThe country\u2019s macroprudential policy framework depends heavily on risk surveillance, monitoring \nseveral macroprudential indicators covering global and domestic developments in the macroeconomic \nand real sectors, financial markets (money, bond, foreign exchange, and equity markets), along with \nreal estate and certain commodity markets, banks, other financial institutions, and the corporate sector \n(CBSL 2014). Composite indicators such as a Financial Stability Indicator, Macroeconomic Stability \nIndicator, Financial Market Stability Indicator, and the Banking Soundness Indicator were created. \n \nGiven  the  potential  risks  associated  with  increased  interconnectedness  among  financial \ninstitutions,  a network analysis is being conducted. Banking resilience is  assessed through stress \ntesting. The country also remains watchful of the risks associated from movements in the rupee \nexchange rate (CBSL 2014). \n ", "Macroprudential Policy Frameworks in Developing Asian Economies   |   25 \n2.  Macroprudential Measures Implemented \n \nOver the years, several macroprudential tools have been activated, such as ceilings on credit growth, \ndynamic general provisions, time-varying capital requirements, time-varying margin requirements, \nreserve requirements, limits on net open foreign currency positions, caps on foreign currency lending \nand exposure limits. \n \nThe CBSL notes how effective or appropriate the policy mix of macroprudential measures with \nmonetary  or  microprudential  instruments.  Examples  include  requiring  licensed  banks  to  increase \ncapital on a staggered basis to support the economy\u2019s growth momentum and to build sufficient \nbuffers to mitigate risks. They have imposed general provisions on performing and selected categories \nof loans and advances to mitigate credit risk in addition to specific provision requirements. They have \nset limits on bank exposure to equity markets by placing limits on margin trading and issuance of \nguarantees for initial public offerings. And they promote the safety and soundness of the banking \nsystem by requiring banks to adopt appropriate risk management standards to mitigate risks arising \nfrom possible volatility and asset price bubbles (CBSL 2014). \n \n3.  Transparency and Accountability \n \nTransparency and accountability in the macroprudential policy framework is promoted through the \nannual CBSL Financial System Stability Review. It informs the public of the assessment of the whole \nfinancial  system,  identifying  potential  risks  and  vulnerabilities,  as  well  as  tools  implemented  and \npolicies taken, along with an outlook assessment (CBSL 2014). \n \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n \nEstablishing a stronger and more effective macroprudential policy framework is one of the main \nlessons learned from the GFC. Countries need a framework that is responsive to the changing global \nfinancial environment. Authorities should be able to identify new sources of systemic risk (such as \ninnovative financial products), assess their likelihood and impact, and proactively respond by designing \nnew policy instruments as they emerge (ADB 2014). \n \nIn a more complex global financial  environment, how should the macroprudential policy \nframeworks be structured and/or further improved in developing Asia? This question holds important \npolicy implications as evolving global growth trends impact Asia\u2019s emerging markets. \n \nCambodia,  Mongolia,  Myanmar,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Viet  Nam  are  among  developing  Asia\u2019s \neconomies with high growth potentials over the medium term. Consequently, these countries may \nbecome potential hotspots for increased capital flows. This requires a dedicated macroprudential \npolicy framework to safeguard against risks involved in cross-border capital flows, among others. \n \nBased on the review of current macroprudential policy practices in select developing Asian \neconomies, three common needs become apparent: \n \n(i)  Establish  a  macroprudential  institutional  framework  based  upon  strong  legal \nfoundations.  A  macroprudential  policy  framework  founded  this  way  holds  several \nadvantages.  It  gives  appropriate  powers  to  the  institution  mandated  to  build \nmacroprudential policy, allowing future policy decisions to carry weight and become \n ", "26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 510 \nbinding. Alongside defined powers, there will be a stronger accountability mechanism, \nwhich will motivate macroprudential policy makers to perform better and come up with \nintelligent decisions built upon more solid evidence. \n(ii)  Improve risk detection and assessment built on thorough analysis of the financial \nsystem as a whole, detecting and preventing the buildup of potential risks. Selected \ndeveloping Asian countries, in some ways, are constrained by data and information \nlimitations useful in macroprudential policy making. Shinohara (2014) emphasized the \nneed  for  Asian  economies  to  improve  early  warning  systems  and  build  sufficient \ntechnical capacity to analyze systemic risk. \n(iii)  Foster  close  coordination  with  other  policy-making  institutions. Macroprudential \npolicies will be more effective if complemented with appropriate monetary, fiscal, and \nother financial and structural policies. \n \nOverall, a macroprudential policy framework must be formulated to respond appropriately to \nthe latest economic developments and changing financial environment. In addition to known sources \nof systemic risks, macroprudential authorities must keep an eye on potential sources of risks\u2014such as \nexpected  vulnerabilities  associated  with  growing  cross-border  capital  flows  across  emerging \neconomies and from advanced markets. Empirically monitoring the effectiveness of macroprudential \nmeasures activated will also help countries devise more effective macroprudential policies better \nsuited to addressing systemic risks. A more integrated world and growing Asian regionalism also call for \nmore  regional  and  international  cooperation  in  the  area  of  macroprudential  policy  experience \n(Shinohara 2014). \n \n \n ", " \nAPPENDIX 1: LIST OF INDICATORS TO MONITOR \n \nCategory  Risk Sources  Indicators \nAggregate  Financial system and economy  GDP growth rate (%)\nindicators  at large  Trend in financial sector contribution to GDP \nCredit growth (%) \nAsset price growth (%) \nInflation \nCurrent account deficit to GDP (%) \nForeign currency reserves \nFiscal deficit to GDP (%) \nSovereign debt to GDP (%) \nGross external debt to GDP (%) \nShort-term external debt to foreign currency reserves (%) \nHousehold: debt to GDP (%); leverage ratio; debt service-to-\nincome ratio \nCorporate:  debt  to  GDP  (%);  leverage  ratio;  debt  service \ncoverage ratio; ROE \nIndicators  of  Aggregate risk  Credit-to-GDP ratio; deviation from long-term trend \nfinancial  sector  Solvency  Capital adequacy ratio\nconditions  Tier 1 capital ratio\nCore equity ratio\nCapital cushion (excess voluntarily maintained by banks above \nminimum requirement) \nCapital cushion after deducting NPLs \nLeverage  Nonrisk  adjusted  leverage  ratio,  including  off  balance  sheet \nitems \nLiquidity  (aggregate  and  Liquid assets to short-term liabilities (%) \ncurrencywise)  Liquid assets to total assets (%)\nLiquidity and maturity mismatches (contractual and behavioral)\nCommitted but undrawn liquidity facilities \nCosts of short-term market borrowing \nTurnover in the interbank market\nAverage borrowing from the central bank\u2019s standing liquidity \nfacilities \nFunding pattern  Reliance on wholesale funding\nReliance oninterbank market\nLoan to deposit \u201cplus\u201d capital (%)\nCost of borrowing\nMaturity pattern\nForeign currency component\nUndrawn funding facilities\nConcentration: counterparty, instrument, market \nCurrency risk  Net open positions to regulatorycapital (%) \nUnhedged currency risk in corporate and household sectors\nAsset quality  NPLs to total loans (aggregate and by sector) (%) \nProvision coverage (%)\nRescheduled or restructured loans\nExtent of delinquency within one year after sanction \nOff-balance sheet risks Activity in nontraditional off balance sheet items \ncontinued on next page", "28   |   Appendixes \nAppendix 1   continued \nCategory  Risk Sources  Indicators \n  Shadow banking  Significance  of  risks  in  unregulated  (and  lightly  regulated) \nsector/entities \nExtent of interlinkages between (i) banks and nonbanks; and (ii) \nregulated and unregulated entities \nProfitability  Return on assets\nROE\nShare of noninterest income in total income \nNet interest margin\nIndicators  of  Developments  in  financial  Market turnover (and liquidity)\nmarket conditions  markets  that  may  lead  to  Indicators of risk appetite (spreads and risk premia) \ngeneralized distress  Rating migration \nCapital flows: portfolio and long-term investments \nIndicators of asset  Real  estate  (can  be  separate  Mortgage loan growth (%)\nmarket conditions  for  housing  and  commercial  Mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio (%) \nreal estate)  Loan-to-value ratio (%) \n  Repayment term (maturity) \n(The  early  warning  system  Proportion of variable rate mortgages \n(EWS) can also include similar  Real estate prices (commercial and residential); old and new \nindicators  for  other  price  properties \nsensitive  asset  classes,  e.g.,  Price-to-rent ratio \nequity markets)  ROE vis-\u00e0-vis conventional financial savings \nIndicators  of  Cross-sectional  dimension;  Common exposures and interconnectedness among financial \nconcentration risk  channels  of  contagion  and  institutions (including nonbank financial institutions), sectors, \namplification  markets \n- Aggregate exposure to top 25 counterparties \n- Aggregate bank exposure to unregulated financial entities \n- Aggregate exposure to sensitive sectors, asset classes, markets \n- Share of large exposures to total assets \nCommon business models \nCommon risk management models \nCommon valuation models \nCommon product structures or components \nCommon risk mitigants (insurers, guarantors, collateral) \nConcentration of funding source (central counterparty; clearing \nhouses; trade repositories) \nSystemically important instruments and markets \nGDP = gross domestic product, NPL = nonperforming loan, ROE = return on equity. \nSource: Krishnamurti, Damodaran, and Yejin Carol Lee. 2014. \u201cMacroprudential Policy Framework: A Practice Guide.\u201d Washington, DC: \nWorld Bank. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0", "Appendixes   |   29 \nAPPENDIX 2: CONCEPTUAL BASIS FOR SELECT MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY TOOLS \n \nInstrument  Conceptual Basis\nCaps on the LTV ratio  The LTV ratio imposes a down payment constraint on households\u2019 capacity to borrow. In \ntheory, the constraint limits the procyclicality of collateralized lending since housing prices and \nhouseholds\u2019 capacity to borrow based on the collateralized value of the house interact in a \nprocyclical manner. Set at an appropriate level, the LTV ratio addresses systemic risk whether \nor not it is frequently adjusted. However, the adjustment of the LTV ratio makes it a more \npotent countercyclical policy instrument. \nCaps on the DTI ratio  The DTI ratio represents prudential regulation aimed at ensuring banks\u2019 asset quality when \nused alone. When used in conjunction with the LTV ratio, however, the DTI ratio can help \nfurther dampen the cyclicality of collateralized lending by adding another constraint on \nhouseholds\u2019 capacity to borrow. Like in the LTV ratio, adjustments in the DTI ratio can be \nmade in a countercyclical manner to address the time dimension of systemic risk. \nCaps on foreign   Loans in foreign currency expose the unhedged borrower to foreign exchange risks which, in \ncurrency lending  turn, subject the lender to credit risks. The risks can become systemic if the common exposure \nis large. Caps (or higher risk weights, deposit requirements, etc.) on foreign currency lending \nmay be used to address this foreign-exchange-induced systemic risk. \nCeilings on credit /  A ceiling may be imposed on either total bank lending or credit to a specific sector. The ceiling \nCredit growth  on aggregate credit or credit growth may be used to dampen the credit/asset price cycle\u2014the \ntime dimension of systemic risk. The ceiling on credit to a specific sector, such as real estate, \nmay be used to contain a specific type of asset price inflation or limit common exposure to a \nspecific risk\u2014the cross-sectional dimension of systemic risk. \nReserve requirements  This monetary policy tool may be used to address systemic risk in two ways. First, the reserve \nrequirement has a direct impact on credit growth, so it may be used to dampen the credit/asset \nprice cycle\u2014the time dimension of systemic risk; second, the required reserves provide a \nliquidity cushion that may be used to alleviate a systemic liquidity crunch when the situation \nwarrants. \nCountercyclical capital  The requirement can take the form of a ratio or risk weights raised during an upturn as a \nrequirements  restraint on credit expansion and reduced during a downturn to provide a cushion so that \nbanks do not reduce assets to meet the capital requirement. A permanent capital buffer, which \nis built up during an upturn and deleted during a downturn, serves the same purpose. Both can \naddress the cyclicality in risk weights under Basel II based on external ratings that are \nprocyclical. \nTime-varying/Dynamic  Traditional dynamic provisioning is calibrated on historical bank-specific losses, but it can also \nprovisioning  be used to dampen the cyclicality in the financial system. The provisioning requirement can be \nraised during an upturn to build a buffer and limit credit expansion and lowered during a \ndownturn to support bank lending. It may be adjusted either according to a fixed formula or at \nthe discretion of the policy maker to affect banks\u2019 lending behavior in a countercyclical manner. \nRestrictions on profit  These requirements are intended toensure the capital adequacy of banks. Since undistributed \ndistribution  profits are added to bank capital, the restrictions tend to have a countercyclical effect on bank \nlending if used in a downturn. The capital conservation buffer of Basel III has a similar role. \nLimits on net open  These tools limit banks\u2019 common exposure to foreign currency risks. In addition, the limits may \npositions/Currency  be used to address an externality\u2014sharp exchange rate fluctuations caused by a convergence \nmismatches  of purchases/sales of foreign exchange by banks. This externality increases the credit risk of \nunhedged borrowers with heavy foreign currency debt. \nLimits on maturity  These may be used to address systemic risk as the choice of asset/liability maturity creates an \nmismatch  externality\u2014asset fire sales. In a crisis, the inability of a financial institution to meet its short-\nterm obligations due to maturity mismatches may force it to liquidate assets, thus imposing a \nfire sale cost on the rest of the financial system. The funding shortages of a few institutions \ncould also result in a systemic liquidity crisis due to the contagion effect. \nDT = debt to income, LTV = loan to value. \nSource: Lim, Cheng Hoon, Francesco  Columba, Alejo Costa,  Piyabha  Kongsamut, Akira Otani, Mustafa Saiyid, Torsten Wezel, and \nXiaoyong Wu. 2011. \u201cMacroprudential Policy: What Instruments and How to Use Them?: Lessons from Country Experiences.\u201d IMF \nWorking Paper No. 11/238.  \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "30   |   Appendixes \nAPPENDIX 3: MACROPRUDENTIAL MEASURES IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA \n \nYear:Quarter  Measures\n2000:Q2  Foreign exchange banks were required to maintain short-term assets (less than 3 months) of at least \n80% (previously 70%) of short-term liabilities and long-term borrowing (more than 3 years) in excess \nof 50% of long-term assets. \n2001:Q1  The limits on deposits abroad that may be held by general corporations and individuals were \neliminated, but general corporations and individuals must notify the BOK when amounts exceed \n$50,000 a day or its equivalent.

(In February 2014, the MAS refined the TDSR framework with broader exemptions. \nBorrowers refinancing owner-occupied housing loans borrowed before the TDSR\u2019s June 2013 \nintroduction would be exempt from the 60% limits, and those refinancing public housing loans from \nlimits on the MSR. Similarly, borrowers were allowed to maintain the remaining loan tenors when \nrefinancing owner-occupied housing loans taken before the loan tenor limits were introduced.) \nAugust 2013  The maximum tenor was reduced from 30 years to 25 years, and MSR lowered from 35% to 30%, for \npublic housing loans granted by HDB; for housing loans granted by financial institutions for the \npurchase of public housing, the maximum tenor was reduced from 35 years to 30 years and loans \nwith tenors exceeding 25 years and up to 30 years were subject to tighter LTV ratio limits. \nSeptember 2013  Announced measures to be progressively implemented between December 2013 and June 2015 \ninclude prohibiting financial institutions from granting further unsecured credit to individuals whose \namount outstanding on any credit card or unsecured credit facility is 60 days or more past due or \nwith total outstanding interest-bearing unsecured debt aggregated across all financial institutions \nexceeding their annual incomes for 3 consecutive months or more. \n \nFinancial institutions were required to review a borrower\u2019s total debt and credit limits aggregated \nacross all financial institutions before granting a new credit card, unsecured credit, or credit limit \nincreases, to disclose to borrowers the potential cost of rolling over credit card debts and revolving \ncredit and how the debt would accumulate, and to obtain a borrower\u2019s express consent for the \namount of each credit limit increase. \nDecember 2013  Introduction of MSR of 30% for housing loans granted by financial institutions for executive \ncondominium units bought directly from property developers. \nABSD = Additional Buyer\u2019s Stamp Duty, HDB = Housing and Development Board, LTV = loan to value, MAS = Monetary Authority of Singapore, \nMSR = mortgage servicing ratio, SSD = seller stamp duty, TDSR = total debt serving ratio. \nSource: Darbar, Salim M., and Xiaoyong Wu. 2015. \u201cExperiences with Macroprudential Policy\u2014 Five Case Studies.\u201d IMF Working Paper No. \n123. \n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "34   |   Appendixes \nAPPENDIX 5: MACROPRUDENTIAL MEASURES IN INDONESIA \n \nYear/Quarter  Measures\n2001:Q1  BI limited forward foreign currency contracts offered by domestic banks to nonresidents was \nlowered to $3 million from $5 million for each customer at each bank.  \n2004:Q2  Deposit accounts in rupiah were made subject by BI to a reserve requirement in the range of 5% to \n8%, depending on the total amount of deposits (previously, 5% of total deposits).  \n2004:Q3  The BI regulates the magnitude of NOP allowed to be held by banks according to the foreign \ncurrency risk-based management, both seen from the composition of the foreign currency in the \nbalance sheet and administrative account, as well as from NOP time period at the end and at the \nmiddle of business day. \n2004:Q4  Banks and nonbank financial institutions (including state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and \ncooperatives) were required to report all offshore commercial borrowing, while individuals were \nrequired to report commercial offshore borrowing of the equivalent of $200,000 or higher. \n2005:Q1  Short-term borrowings by banks were limited to 30% of bank capital. Long-term borrowings \n(maturities of more than 1 year) by banks required approval by BI. \n2005:Q3  Bank Indonesia puts limit on rupiah transactions and foreign exchange lending by banks. \n  The limit on forward and swap transactions of banks with nonresidents without an underlying \ninvestment-related transaction was reduced to $1 million from $3 million. \n2009:Q4  The 2.5% secondary reserve requirement became operational after a 1-year transitional period, \nraising the total reserve requirement from 5% to 7.5%. The 2.5% secondary reserves may be met in \nthe form of BI certificates, government bonds, and/or a current account deposit at the BI. \n2010:Q3  BI imposed a 1-month minimum holding period for all investors (both domestic and foreign) for \npurchases of Bank Indonesia certificates (SBIs) in both the primary and secondary markets. \n2010:Q4  BI raised the statutory reserve ratio in rupiah from 5% to 8%.\n2011:Q1  BI raised statutory reserve requirement on foreign currency from 1% to 5%. BI (Regulation No. \n13/4/PBI/2011) revoked the facility that provided foreign exchange liquidity to domestic companies \nby conducting spot transactions through commercial banks in connection with economic activities in \nIndonesia. A high loan-to-deposit ratio but insufficient capital adequacy ratio penalized with higher \nreserve requirement ratio. \n2011:Q2  The minimum holding period for all investors (both domestic and foreign) for purchases of SBIs in \nboth the primary and secondary markets was lengthened from 1 month to 6 months. \n  BI raised statutory reserve requirement on foreign currency from 5% to 8%. \n2011:Q3  BI Regulation No. 13/21/PBI/2011 on monitoring of bank activity in foreign exchange flows require \nbanks to submit complete, accurate, and timely data on foreign exchange flows to the BI. \n2012:Q2  BI introduced the maximum LTV ratio of 70% to bank loans backed by houses over 70 square \nmeters and implementation to the sharia-compliant finance industry and ban the use of unsecured \npersonal loan for credit advances. To deepen the foreign exchange market, BI relaxed the relevant \nprovisions tenor forward to nonresident of the previous minimum of 3 months to a minimum of 1 \nweek. \n2013:Q3  Bank Indonesia amended its regulation concerning the LTV/FTV ratio for property credit and \nproperty-backed  consumer  loans.  The  LTV/FTV  ratio  is  the  ratio  between  the  value  of \ncredit/financing that can be allocated by a bank and the corresponding value of collateral in the form \nof property when the loan is allocated.
