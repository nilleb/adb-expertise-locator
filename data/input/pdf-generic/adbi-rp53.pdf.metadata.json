Introduction \nThe microfinance revolution has changed attitudes towards helping the poor in many \ncountries and in some has provided substantial flows of credit, often to very low-income \ngroups  or  households,  who  would  normally  be  excluded  by  conventional  financial \ninstitutions. Bangladesh is the starkest example of a very poor country, where currently \nroughly  one  quarter  of  rural  households  are direct  beneficiaries  of  these  programs \n(Khandker 2003). Much has been written on the rapnge of institutional arrangements \npursued in different organizations and countries and in turn a vast number studies have \nattempted  to  assess  the  outreach  and  poverty  impact  of  such  schemes.  However, \namongst the academic development community there is a recognition that perhaps we \nknow much less about the impact of these programs than might be expected given the \nenthusiasm for these activities in donor and policy-making circles. To quote a recent \nauthoritative volume on micro finance: \n\u201cMFI field operations have far surpassed the research capacity to analyze them, \nso excitement about the use of micro finance for poverty alleviation is not backed up \nwith sound facts derived from rigorous research. Given the current state of knowledge, \nit is difficult to allocate confidently public resources to microfinance development.\u201d \n(Zeller and Meyer 2002). \nThis is a very strong statement of doubt and in part reflects a lack of accurate \ndata, but also in part methodological difficulties associated with assessing exactly what \nproportion of income and other effects on the beneficiaries of micro credit can actually \nbe attributed to the programs themselves. In recognition of this uncertainty this paper \naims to bring together some of the recent evidence that has been accumulating on the \nimpact of microfinance activities on poverty reduction. In particular we ask what is the \nevidence on three specific issues.   \n \n\u2212  the extent to which microfinance initiatives have made a lasting difference in \npulling households out of poverty on a permanent basis; \n\u2212  the extent to which microfinance programs reach only the better-off amongst the \npoor, leaving the \u2018core poor\u2019 unaffected; \n\u2212  how far micro finance is a cost-effective means of transferring income to the \npoor. \n \n                                                 \n\u2020 John Weiss is Research Director and Heather Montgomery is a Research Fellow at the ADB Institute. \nAt the time of writing Elvira Kurmanalieva was a Research Associate at the ADB Institute.  This first \ndraft of this paper was presented at the 2003 ADB Institute Annual Conference on \u201cMicrofinance in Asia: \nPoverty Impact and Outreach to the Poor,\u201d Tokyo, 5 December 2003. \n  1", "These are very basic questions and the fact that they can still be posed reflects \nthe extent of uncertainty in the literature. \nThe paper is organized in four sections. The first provides a brief overview of \nsome of the features of microfinance activities in Asia, which is our region of focus. \nThe second discusses a few concepts from the poverty literature and links these with \nmicrofinance programs. The third surveys the evidence from recent research studies on \nthe first two of the three questions posed above. The fourth section addresses the third \nquestion.  Since a number of other surveys are also available we give most attention to \nevidence  produced  in  the  last  three  or  four  years.1  Finally  we  draw  some  brief \nconclusions. \n2.  Some Features of Micro Finance in Asia \n\u201cAsia  is  the  most  developed  continent  in  the  world  in  terms  of  volume  of  MFI \n(microfinance institution) activities.\u201d  This conclusion, drawn by Lapeneu and Zeller \n(2001:27),  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  over  1,500  institutions  from  85  developing \ncountries.  Comparing MFIs in Asia with those in Africa and Latin America, the study \nfound that in the 1990s Asia accounted for the majority of MFIs, retained the highest \nvolume of savings and credit, and served more members than any other continent.   \nThis  generalization  of  course  covers  up  some  wide  disparities  within  the \nregion.  East Asia is particularly well served by MFIs.  The largest number of members \nserved and the largest distribution of loans and mobilization of savings in terms of GNP \nis found in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.  In contrast, the two most \npopulated countries in Asia, India and the PRC, have very low outreach, despite a high \nconcentration  of  the  regions  poor.    Countries  such  as  Afghanistan,  Myanmar  and \nPakistan also have low outreach due to a variety of factors.   \nDespite these disparities within the region, overall it is said that MFIs have \nflourished in Asia and that  compared to other regions they exhibit good outreach and \nhigh  repayment  rates.2    Table  1  below  presents  the  most  recent  data  from  the \nMicrobanking Bulletin, which gives only data on the limited number of MFIs who \nchoose to report to the Bulletin. Those reporting to the Bulletin are thought to be \namongst the best and are therefore unlikely to be representative (Meyer 2002: 14). \nNonetheless amongst these, by various measures, Asian MFIs demonstrate relatively \ngood outreach.  They account for the largest number of borrowers (70% of which are \nwomen) and are second only to African MFIs in terms of number of voluntary savers.  \nIn terms of impact, size of loans and deposits are often taken as a simple indicator of \nimpact on the poor. By these criteria, Asian MFIs have among the lowest Loan and \nSavings Balance per Borrower, even after adjusting for GNP per capita, suggesting that \nthey are effectively reaching the poor.   \n \n                                                 \n1  An  earlier  helpful  survey  published  by  ADBI  is  Meyer  (2002).  This  draws  out  some  of  the \nmethodological problems in assessing impact and surveys a number of important studies available at the \ntime of the writing (around 2001). Morduch (1999) is an extremely authoritative earlier survey focusing \non both conceptual and empirical questions. \n2 Lapenu and Zeller (2001:28) table 16. \n  2", "Table 1.

These  include  unregulated  NGOs,  credit  unions  or  co-\noperatives (which are often regulated), registered banking institutions (either banks or \nnon-bank  financial  institutions)  and  government  organizations.  In  some  cases  the \ninstitutional forms blur into one another with government banks operating microfinance \nservices in collaboration with NGOs or credit co-operatives. \nIn recent years there has been a significant shift in both thinking and practice in \nthe microfinance sector with MFIs coming to be seen as providing a range of financial \nservices to the poor, including savings facilities, not just micro credit. The intellectual \nargument for this comes from the insight that the poor have a strong need to manage \ntheir very limited resources and that various forms of savings play an important role in \nhousehold budgeting by the poor (Rutherford 2000). The practical demonstration of this \nis the shift from the original Grameen model of micro credit for productive purposes to \nGrameen Mark II with its emphasis on a range of flexible financial products, including \nloans of varying repayment periods for consumption as well as investment and various \nshort and longer-term savings accounts (Rutherford 2003).  \nIn parallel with this reappraisal of micro finance within the NGO sector has \ngone a move towards the transformation of NGOs into regulated financial institutions \nwith a view to allowing them to tap non-donor sources of funding and to offer a wider \nrange of financial services. This trend, which has seen 39 important NGOs (15 in Asia) \ntransformed  over  the  period  1992-2003,  places  micro  finance  squarely  within  the \nconventional financial sector and raises important issues of governance and regulation \nin connection with the new institutions (Fernando 2003). Given that the failure of \ncommercial financial institutions to reach the poor provided the initial impetus for \nMFIs, this new trend is paradoxical and raises questions as to whether the initial poverty \nreduction objectives of the transformed NGOs will be subjugated to commercial criteria \n(so-called \u2018mission drift\u2019), although Fernando (2003) argues that as yet there is little \nevidence of this. \n  3", "3.  Poverty and Micro Finance \nHere we define poverty as an income (or more broadly welfare) level below a socially \nacceptable  minimum  and  micro  finance  as  one  of  a  range  of  innovative  financial \narrangements  designed  attract  the  poor  as  either  borrowers  or  savers.  In  terms  of \nunderstanding poverty a simple distinction can be drawn within the group \u2018the poor\u2019 \nbetween the long-term or \u2018chronic poor\u2019 and those who temporarily fall into poverty as \na result of adverse shocks, the \u2018transitory poor\u2019. Within the chronic poor one can further \ndistinguish between those who are either so physically or socially disadvantaged that \nwithout welfare support they will always remain in poverty (the \u2018destitute\u2019) and the \nlarger group who are poor because of their lack of assets and opportunities. Furthermore \nwithin the non-destitute category one may distinguish by the depth of poverty (how far \nhouseholds are below the poverty line) with those significantly below it representing the \n\u2018core poor\u2019, who are sometimes categorized by the irregularity of their income.  \nIn principle, micro finance can relate to the chronic (non-destitute) poor and to \nthe transitory poor in different ways. The condition of poverty has been interpreted \nconventionally as a lack of access by poor households to the assets necessary for a \nhigher standard of income or welfare, whether assets are thought of as human (access to \neducation), natural (access to land), physical (access to infrastructure), social (access to \nnetworks of obligations) or financial (access to credit) (World Bank 2000:34).  Lack of \naccess to credit is readily understandable in terms of the absence of collateral that the \npoor can offer conventional financial institutions, in addition to the various complexities \nand  high  costs  involved  in  dealing  with  large  numbers  of  small,  often  illiterate, \nborrowers. The poor thus have to rely on loans from either moneylenders, at high \ninterest  rates,  or  friends  and  family,  whose  supply  of  funds  will  be  limited. \nMicrofinance  institutions  attempt  to  overcome  these  barriers  through  innovative \nmeasures  such  as  group  lending  and  regular  savings  schemes,  as  well  as  the \nestablishment of close links between poor clients and staff of the institutions concerned. \nAs noted above, the range of possible relationships and the mechanisms employed are \nvery wide.  \nThe case for micro finance as a mechanism for poverty reduction is simple. If \naccess to credit can be improved, it is argued, the poor can finance productive activities \nthat will allow income growth, provided there are no other binding constraints. This is a \nroute out of poverty for the non-destitute chronic poor. For the transitory poor, who are \nvulnerable to fluctuations in income that can bring them close to or below the poverty \nline, micro finance provides the possibility of credit at times of need and in some \nschemes the opportunity of regular savings by a household itself can be drawn on. The \navoidance of sharp declines in family expenditures by drawing on such credit or savings \nallows \u2018consumption smoothing.\u2019 In practice the distinction between the needs of the \nchronic and transitory poor for credit for \u2018promotional\u2019 (that is income creating) and \n\u2018protectional\u2019 (consumption smoothing) purposes, respectively, is over-simplified, since \nthe chronic poor will also have short term needs that have to be met, whether it is due to \nincome shortfalls or unexpected expenditures like medical bills or social events like \nweddings or funerals. In fact, it is one of the most interesting generalizations to emerge \nfrom the micro finance and poverty literature that the poorest of the chronic poor (the \ncore poor) will borrow essentially for protectional purposes given both the low and \nirregular nature of their income. This group it is suggested will be too risk averse to \n  4", "borrow for promotional measures (that is investment in the future) and will therefore be \nonly a very limited beneficiary of microfinance schemes (Hulme and Mosley 1996: \n132).3  \nThe view that it is the less badly-off poor, who benefit principally from micro \nfinance, has become highly influential and, for example, was repeated in the World \nDevelopment Report on poverty  (World Bank 2000:75). Apart from the risk aversion \nargument noted above a number of other explanations for this outcome have been put \nforward. A related issue refers to the interest rates charged to poor borrowers. Most \nmicrofinance schemes charge close to market-clearing interest rates (although these will \noften not be enough to ensure full cost-recovery given the high cost per loan of small-\nscale lending).  It may be that, even setting aside risk-aversion argument, such high \nrates are unaffordable to the core poor given their lack of complementary inputs; in \nother words, despite having a smaller amount of capital, marginal returns to the core \npoor may be lower than for the better-off poor. If the core poor cannot afford high \ninterest rates they will either not take up the service or take it up and get into financial \ndifficulties. Also where group lending is used, other members of the group may exclude \nthe very poor because they are seen as a bad credit risk, jeopardizing the position of the \ngroup as a whole. Alternatively, where professional staff operate as loan officers, they \nmay exclude the very poor from borrowing, again on grounds of repayment risk. In \ncombination, these factors, it is felt by many, explain the weakness of micro finance in \nreaching the core poor.4 \nEven  where  micro  finance  does  reach  the  core  poor,  when  (as  in  many \ninstances)  donor  or  government  funds  are  required  to  subsidize  the  microfinance \ninstitutions involved, it is not inevitably the case that this is an efficient strategy. As \nfunds are fungible within households, the use of the loan is not the issue and what \nmatters is the cost of transferring the funds through a micro credit institution per dollar \nreceived by the target group, as compared with the benefit-cost ratio for alternative \nschemes  for  reaching  the  core  poor,  such  as  food  subsidies,  workfare,  integrated \nregional development initiatives and so forth. Such comparisons must take account of \nnot just the administrative costs involved, but also the leakage rate (that is the benefits \nto the non-poor).    \nGiven the new trends in the sector and their possible effect in diluting the \noriginal poverty focus of MFIs the question of their impact on the poor (and particularly \nthe core poor) is clearly of great policy interest. It might be thought that if such \ninstitutions are designed to serve only poor clients and if repayment rates are high, no \nfurther detailed analysis is needed. Such a view is misleading for a number of reasons. \nFirst, there is no guarantee that only the poor will be served unless strong eligibility \n                                                 \n3 Morduch (2003) points out that, although this argument may be true, the data in Hulme and Mosley\u2019s \nbook cannot be used to infer this since the arithmetic basis for their comparison of income changes for \ndifferent categories of borrowers, biasing their results in favor of their conclusion.  \n4 An important attempt to address this problem has been the Income Generation for Vulnerable Group \nDevelopment (IGVGD) program run by BRAC in Bangladesh, which combines measures of livelihood \nprotection (food aid) with measures of livelihood promotion (skills training and micro credit). Hence, \nmicro credit is provided as part of a package approach. Matin and Hulme (2003) survey the evidence on \nhow far the benefits of this program actually reach the core poor and conclude that although the program \nwas more successful than more conventional micro credit schemes, nonetheless many target households \nwere still missed.  \n  5", "criteria (like land ownership) are enforced. Often the aim is to dissuade the non-poor \nwith the inconvenience of frequent meetings or the stigma of being a member of a credit \ngroup of the poor. Such disincentives need not work and eligibility criteria where they \nexist may not be enforced. Second, high repayment rates may be due to social pressure \nwithin a group or family and may not reflect the capacity to repay (if for example loans \nfrom moneylenders have to be taken out to repay the micro credit). Third, even if the \npoor are genuinely served by MFIs, as long a public funds are required to finance the \nMFI there is the issue of how cost-effective this means of reaching the poor is compared \nwith alternatives. Hence for these sorts of reasons, there is a strong case for attempting \nto assess the impact of such loans on the welfare of the target group.  \nNonetheless assessing the true relationship between microfinance services and \npoverty reduction is not straightforward. It is not simply a case of looking at a group of \nborrowers,  observing  their  income  change  after  they  took  out  micro  credits  and \nestablishing  who  has  risen above  the  poverty  line.  Accurate  assessment  requires  a \nrigorous test of the counterfactual\u2014that is how income (or whatever measure is used) \nwith a micro credit compares with what it would be without it, with the only difference \nin both cases being the availability of credit. Empirically, this requires a control group \nidentical in characteristics to the recipients of credit and engaged in the same productive \nactivities, who have not received credit, and whose income (or other measure) can be \ntraced through time to compare with that of the credit recipients.5 Furthermore, to allow \nfor changes over time, in principle assessments should allow for the possibility of \nreversals,  with  households  slipping  back  below  the  poverty  line  if  the  productive \nactivities  financed  by  the  credits  are  unsustainable.  Studies  based  on  a  rigorous \ncounterfactual find much smaller gains from micro finance than simple unadjusted \n\u2018before and after\u2019 type comparisons, which erroneously attribute all gains to micro \ncredit.  \nHere we examine some of the recent \u2018scientific\u2019 studies on the impact of MFIs \nbased on various survey data. We do not report the results of work based on more \nqualitative or participatory approaches.6 Table 2 summarizes the results of the studies \nsurveyed here. \n \n \n                                                 \n5 Coleman (2001) has a useful non-technical explanation of the difficulties of applying this approach and \neliminating \u2018selection\u2019 and \u2018placement\u2019 bias in micro credit studies. \n6 See Hulme (1999) for a discussion of different approaches to impact. He points out that despite their \ncost in funds and time, such scientific studies involving detailed sample surveys are the most common \napproach where the aim is to establish impact for policy or investment purposes.  \n  6", "Table 2.

Poverty Impact  \nOne of the early and most widely cited of the poverty impact studies is Hulme and \nMosley (1996). This employed a control group approach looking at the changes in \nincome for households in villages with microfinance programs and changes for similar \nhouseholds in non-program areas. Programs in a number of countries are considered \nincluding the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). In \ngeneral a positive impact is found on borrower incomes of the poor (1988-92) with on \naverage an increase over the control groups ranging from 10-12% in Indonesia, to \naround 30% in Bangladesh and India  (Hulme and Mosley 1996, table 8.1). Gains are \nlarger  for  non-poor  borrowers,  however,  and  within  the  group  the  poor  gains  are \nnegatively correlated with income. However, despite the breadth of the study and its use \nof control group techniques, it has been criticized for a possible \u2018placement\u2019 bias, \nwhereby microfinance programs may be drawn to better placed villages, so that part of \nthe advantage relative to the control group may be due to this more favorable location. \nFurther, the quality and accuracy of some of the data, particularly in relation to the \nrepresentative nature of the control groups, has been questioned (Morduch 1999:1600). \n  10", "Another major early initiative that has provided some of the firmest empirical \nwork  were  the  surveys  conducted  in  the  1990s  by  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of \nDevelopment Studies (BIDS) and the World Bank; these provided the data for several \nmajor analyses, such as Pitt and Khandker (1998).  Khandker (1998) summarizes a \nnumber of different studies conducted in Bangladesh using the 1991/92 survey and \nfocusing on three major microfinance programs, including the Grameen Bank and the \nBangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC).  Methodologically  impact  is \nassessed using a double-difference approach between eligible and ineligible households \n(with  land  holdings  of  more  than  half  an  acre  making  households  ineligible)  and \nbetween program and non-program villages. After controlling for other factors, such as \nvarious  household  characteristics,  any  remaining  difference  was  attributed  to  the \nmicrofinance programs. The study draws a number of conclusions, but the main one is \nthat  the  program  had  a  positive  effect  on  household  consumption,  which  was \nsignificantly greater for female borrowers. On average, a loan of 100 taka to a female \nborrower, after it is repaid, allows a net consumption increases of 18 taka. In terms of \npoverty impact it is estimated that 5% of participant households are pulled above the \npoverty line annually.  \nKhandker (2003) follows up this earlier work by employing panel data. He \nuses  the  BIDS\uf8e7World  Bank  survey  conducted  in  1998-99  that  traced  the  same \nhouseholds from the 1991-92 survey.7  He finds apparently strong and positive results. \nWhilst borrowing by males appears to have no significant impact on consumption, that \nby females, who are the dominant client group, does have a positive impact. From this \nanalysis a 100 taka loan to a female client leads to a 10.5 taka increase in consumption \n(compared with 18 taka in the earlier analysis). Allowing for the impact of higher \nconsumption on poverty gives estimates of poverty impact. It is estimated that due to \nparticipation in microfinance programs moderate poverty among program participants \ndecreased 8.5 percentage points over the period of seven years and extreme poverty \ndropped about 18 points over the same period.8 He also finds evidence of positive \nspillovers on non-program participants in the villages with the impact greater for those \nin extreme poverty. Poverty for non-participants is found to decline by 1 percentage \npoint due to the programs whilst extreme poverty declines by nearly 5 percentage \npoints. This impact is due solely to female borrowing. \nThe same data set has also been used to identify health impacts as opposed to \nincome changes. Pitt et al. (2003) find that credit going to females has a large and \nsignificant impact in two out of three health measures for children. Male borrowing has \nno such effect. For example, a 10% increase in credit to females increases the arm \ncircumference of daughters by 6.3%, the height of girls by 0.36 cm annually and of boys \nby 0.50 cms. The relations are stronger for daughters than sons. Hence in Bangladesh, \nmicro credit and improved family health appear to be related. \nThese are strong and positive results and probably are the clearest evidence \nthere is that micro finance is working in the way intended to bring sustained relief from \n                                                 \n7 Technically the study is rigorous in employing a two stage instrumental variable approach along with a \nhousehold fixed-effects method to control for possible endogeneity bias, particularly for the fixed \nunobserved characteristics of households (that is the more entrepreneurial amongst the poor are those who \nborrow and these may do better anyway).   \n8 Poverty is based on a daily calorie intake of 2,112 and extreme poverty on one of 1,739. \n  11", "poverty. However a couple of caveats are in order. First, the accuracy of the original \nresults as presented in Pitt and Khandker (1998) has been disputed on the grounds that \nthe eligibility criteria of low land holdings was not enforced strictly in practice. In a \nreworking of the results focusing on what are claimed to be more directly comparable \nhouseholds,  no  impact  on  consumption  from  participation  in  a  program  is  found \n(Morduch 1999:1605).9 Second, in the BIDs-World Bank survey data, the \u2018ultra poor\u2019 \n(defined as those with less than 0.2 acres of land) form nearly 60% of participants and \nthe likelihood of participation is strongly and negatively associated with level of land \nholding.  Nonetheless,  how  much  is  borrowed  depends  principally  on  the \nentrepreneurship of households, so that the charge that the risk-averse very poor will \nbenefit less has not been totally dispelled. Furthermore, the panel data reveal a relatively \nhigh  dropout  rate  of  around  30%,  indicating  that  there  were  problems  for  many \nhouseholds. \nThere  are  examples  of  many  other  studies  that  are  either  inconclusive  or \nprovide less convincing results. Coleman (1999) and MkNelly et al. (1996) both focus \non  experiences  with  village  banking  in  Thailand.  Coleman  (1999)  utilizes  data  on \nvillages that had participated in village bank microfinance schemes and those control \nvillages that were designated as participants, but had not yet participated. This allows a \ndouble  difference  approach  that  compares  the  difference  between  income  for \nparticipants and non-participants in program villages with the same difference in the \ncontrol villages, where the programs were introduced later. From the results here, the \npoverty  impact  of  the  schemes  appears  highly  dubious.  Months  of  village  bank \nmembership have no impact on any asset or income variables and there is no evidence \nthat village bank loans were directed to productive purposes. The small sizes of loans \nmean that they were largely used for consumption, but one of the reasons there is a \nweak poverty impact is that there was a tendency for wealthier households to self-select \ninto village banks. \nColeman  (2004)  uses  the  same  survey  data  but  reconsiders  the  estimation \nstrategy to control for self-selection. He argues that the village bank methodology, \nwhich relies on self-selection by loan size and monitoring by frequent meetings, may \nnot  reach  the  poorest.  As  many  wealthy  households  tend  to  be  on  village  bank \ncommittees, the failure to control for this leads to systematic biases. The regression \nresults  of  Coleman  (2004)  indicate  that  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between \nordinary members and committee members of village banks. The impact of micro \ncredits on ordinary members\u2019 well being is either insignificantly different from zero or \nnegative. On the contrary, the impact of microfinance programs on committee members\u2019 \nmeasures of wealth, such as income, savings, productive expenses and labor time is \npositive, implying a form of program capture by the better-off in the village, even \nthough this group may not be well-off by national standards. A similar result in terms of \nrationing micro credit in favor of better-off groups or members is found by Doung and \nIzumida (2002) in a study of six villages in Viet Nam. There whilst credit availability is \nlinked with production and income, household economic position and prestige in a \n                                                 \n9 This debate, which in part centers around details of econometric estimation, has not been resolved. An \nunpublished paper by Pitt reworks the original analysis to address the concerns of Morduch and is said to \nconfirm the original results (Khandker 2003, footnote 1). \n  12", "village plus the amount of credit applied for are the main determinants of how credit is \nallocated. \nMkNelly  et  al.  (1996)  evaluated  the  Freedom  from  Hunger  credit  with \neducation  program  in  Thailand  operated  through  village  banks.  The  results  show \npositive benefits, however, although non-participants in non-program villages are used \nas controls, there are problems in accepting the results. No statistical tests are reported, \nso one cannot judge whether differences between participants and non-participants are \nsignificant.  There is also a potential measurement bias since the staff responsible for \nthe program also did the interviewing. \nChen and Snodgrass (2001) examine the operations of the Self Employed \nWomen\u2019s  Association  (SEWA)  bank  in  India,  which  provides  low-income  female \nclients in the informal sector with both saving and loan services. The study tests for the \nimpact of these services by comparing the bank\u2019s clients against a randomly selected \ncontrol group in a similar geographic area. Two surveys were conducted two years \napart.  Average  incomes  rose  over  time  for  all  groups\u2014borrowers,  savers  and  the \ncontrol\u2014although the increase was less for the latter. In terms of poverty incidence \nthere  was  little  overall  change,  although  there  was  substantial  \u2018churning\u2019,  in  that \namongst the clients of SEWA there was quite a lot of movement above or below the \npoverty line. In interpreting these results Meyer (2002) argues that the evidence on the \ncounterfactual, that is what would have happened to the clients in the absence of the \nservices of SEWA, is not sufficiently strongly established to draw any firm conclusions \non poverty impact. \nThe smoothing of consumption over time to protect the poor against adverse \nshocks  is  one  of  the  principle  objectives  of  micro  credit.  Using  data  again  for \nBangladesh, Amin et al. (2003) compute several measures of vulnerability.10 They find \nthat the micro credit participants in the two villages covered are more likely to be below \nthe poverty line than if they had been selected at random, so that the programs have \nreached  the  poor.  However,  the  vulnerable  are  more  likely  to  join  a  micro  credit \nprogram in only one of the two villages. Further, for the vulnerable below the poverty \nline in one village, there is no evidence that there are more likely to be members of a \nprogram, and in the other village there is evidence that they have either chosen not to \njoin or are actively excluded, presumably on the grounds that they are a poor credit risk. \nHence the very poor and vulnerable do not appear to be reached.  \nMore positive conclusions in terms of the ability of micro finance to reduce \nvulnerability are found for Indonesia by Gertler et al. (2003), who find that access to \nmicro finance helps households to smooth consumption in the face of declines in health \nof adult family members. Having established an empirical relationship between health \ncondition and consumption, the authors test for a relation between access to a financial \ninstitution  and  consumption  shortfalls  associated  with  ill  health.  Using  geographic \ndistance as a measure of access, they find that for households in an area with a BRI \n                                                 \n10 Unlike the Khandker studies this data picks up households before they joined a micro credit scheme. \nTheir vulnerability measure is broader than simply fluctuations in consumption. \n  13", "branch, health shocks have no effect on consumption.11  This study does not differentiate \nwithin the group of the poor. \n5.  Forms of Micro Credit Interventions and Cost-effectiveness \nExperimentation and local variation are likely to be important aspects of successful \nMFIs. A few studies have looked in detail at the impact and cost effectiveness of \ndifferent forms of intervention. For example, Park and Ren (2001) look at the Chinese \nexperience drawing on household survey data for 1997. They are able to compare three \ntypes of programs based on ownership characteristics\u2014NGO-based, mixed programs \nand government ownership. Whether in terms of conventional financial criteria like \nrepayment rates, or measures of initial impact like targeting effectiveness, the NGO \nprograms  appear  to  function  best,  with  the  government-run  programs  the  least \nsuccessful. \nDetailed mechanisms for micro lending are examined for Thailand by Kaboski \nand Townsend (2003), who look at different institutional variants such as production \ncredit groups, women\u2019s groups, rice banks and buffalo banks, as well as a variety of \nservices included training and various savings facilities. Of the forms of institutions, \nallowing for a range of other factors, the women\u2019s groups appear to have the largest \npositive impact on their members. Of the services offered, training in conjunction with \ncredit appears to work well and the availability of savings facilities appears to be \nassociated  with  asset  growth  amongst  households.  Of  the  savings  services,  regular \n\u2018pledged savings\u2019 have the largest positive impact. Explanations offered for this include \nthe use of savings as collateral for further loans either from the institution itself or from \nother  sources,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  and  risk  of  infrequent  deposits  and \nwithdrawals. However since the poorest may not be in a position of offer regular \nsavings this also provides an explanation for why they may benefit relatively less from \nMFIs.12  \nMost studies of the impact of different forms of micro finance do not conduct a \nfull cost effectiveness analysis in order to judge both the effectiveness of different \nalternatives and how microfinance interventions compare in efficiency terms with other \nways of reaching the poor. However, there is often a general expectation that MFIs are \nan effective and efficient means of reaching the poor. For example, Wright (2000) \nargues that \u201c...micro finance has a particular advantage over almost (and probably) all \nother interventions\u201d in providing cost-effective and sustainable services to the poor.  \nThe early work by Khandker (1998) attempts to assess the cost-effectiveness of \nmicro credit in Bangladesh (that is costs per taka of consumption for the poor) as \ncompared  with  more  formal  financial  institutions  and  other  poverty-targeted \ninterventions. His data are summarized in Table 3. They appear to be based on the \nassumption of a zero leakage rate to the non-poor. The interesting result that emerges is \nthat the Grameen Bank is considerably more effective than BRAC and that, as expected, \nloans to female borrowers are considerably more cost-effective than loans to males. \n                                                 \n11 Patten et al (2001) find evidence that the micro finance side of the Indonesian banking system \nperformed much more robustly during the macro crises of the late 1990s than did the commercial banking \nsector. \n12 Fujita (2000) makes this point in the context of Bangladesh. \n  14", "Further, subsidies to Grameen (but not to BRAC) appear to be a more cost effective \nmeans of reaching the poor than various \u2018food for work\u2019 programs. However, a \u2018food \nfor education\u2019 scheme appeared to be very cost effective relative to the \u2018food for work\u2019 \nprograms and to BRAC.13  Formal financial institutions are less cost-effective than \nGrameen for both female and male borrowers and less cost effective than BRAC in \nsome, but not all, cases examined (Khandker 1998:134-139). The high figure for BRAC \nis in part due to the range of services, such as training, offered in addition it micro credit \n(see footnote 4), but nonetheless if such services are essential to the success of micro \ncredit, including their cost in a cost-benefit assessment of micro credit is legitimate. \nIt is interesting to note that Khandker does not conclude from this that all \nsubsidies to other poverty interventions should be withdrawn and reallocated to micro \nfinance. Rather he points out that as participants to micro credit borrowing self-select \n(that is they judge that micro credit suits their particular needs, often for self employed \nwork) others amongst the poor may not be able to benefit. For this latter group other \nforms of targeting will still be required.  \n \nTable 3.

The  figures  for  Grameen \nsupport this view, whilst those for BRAC do not. More recently a couple of other \n                                                 \n13 The study on this scheme by Wodon (1998) appears considerably more sophisticated than the other \nstudies and compares costs with the future stream of estimated benefits to the poor in terms of gains from \neducation. The ratio for this activity may not be directly comparable with the other figures in the table. \n  15", "estimates  have  become  available.  Burgess  and  Pande  (2003)  examine  whether  the \npattern of commercial bank expansion in India into rural areas, previously not served by \nbanks, has had an impact on rural poverty and their work allows a simple comparison \nwith micro finance. Their estimates suggest that it costs 2.72 rupees to generate an \nadditional rupee of income for the poor via social banking programs. Compared with the \ndata in Table 3 this ratio is higher than the cost-effectiveness ratio for Grameen, but \nlower than that for BRAC.14  \nA further look at the effectiveness of Grameen is provided by Schreiner (2003), \nwho calculates the subsidy-lending ratio at 0.22 over the period 1983-97. This is not \ndirectly equivalent to the ratios in Table 3, but assuming the same return to borrowing \nas in Khandker (1998) these figures can be converted into a broadly equivalent ratio of \ncost to gains to the poor of 1.15. This is consistent with the figures in Table 3, which \nwould need to be averaged to give an overall return to male and female borrowing \ncombined. The result confirms Grameen as a relatively cost-effective form of poverty \nintervention, although it says nothing about how the benefits from its activities are \ndistributed between the poor, the very poor and those above the poverty line. \n6.  Conclusions \nDespite the extensive spread of micro finance, research studies on the actual impact of \nMFIs are often more ambivalent about its impact than is the aid community. In part this \nreflects the methodological problems of establishing appropriate statistical controls and \nin part no doubt also the range of variation found in practice in the way in which micro \nfinance operates.  Our view is that, despite the difficulties, more good poverty impact \nstudies are important to sharpen understanding of its role as an anti-poverty tool, to \nassess its impact in different environments and to shape the debate on ways forward for \nMFIs. \nAmongst practitioners there is widespread acceptance of the view that it is both \nnecessary  to  diversify  the  products  of  micro  finance  and  adapt  them  to  local \ncircumstances.  Any  simple  replication  of  formulae  successful  elsewhere  is  rightly \ntreated  with  suspicion.  However  the  evidence  surveyed  here  suggests  that  the \nconclusion from the early literature, that whilst micro finance clearly may have had \npositive impacts on poverty it is unlikely to be a simple panacea for reaching the core \npoor, remains broadly valid. Reaching the core poor is difficult and some of the reasons \nthat made them difficult to reach with conventional financial instruments mean that they \nmay also be high risk and therefore unattractive microfinance clients. \nThere has been an extensive debate, which we do not touch on here, on the \nfinancial sustainability of MFIs. We would simply make the point that just because an \ninstitution needs a subsidy to cover its costs in itself is not a reason for not supporting \nthe institution. The issue should be, what benefits in terms of income gains for the poor \ncan be achieved with the subsidy and how does the ratio of subsidy to benefits compare \nwith that for other interventions. Detailed cost effectiveness studies are rare and those \nthat are available show both high and low scores for MFIs in the same country. Hence \n                                                 \n14 It should be noted that the benefits from Grameen lending found in Khandker (2003), which are almost \nhalf of those found in his earlier study, imply considerably higher cost effectiveness ratios to those \nreported in Table 3, unless there has been a corresponding rise in the efficiency of operations. \n  16", "there is a need to continually improve design and outreach and to see MFIs as part of \nthe package for targeting the poor, rather than the whole solution.  \nOur view is that despite the difficulties, poverty impact studies of MFIs can \nprovide important information and that continued efforts should be made to sharpen \nunderstanding of the impacts of different forms of MFI activity on the poor, including \ntheir cost-effectiveness. \n  17", "References \n \nAmin S., Rai A.S., Ropa G.
