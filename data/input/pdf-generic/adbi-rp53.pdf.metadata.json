Introduction \n\nThe  microfinance  revolution  has  changed  attitudes  towards  helping  the  poor  in  many \ncountries and in some has provided substantial flows of credit, often to very low-income \ngroups  or  households,  who  would  normally  be  excluded  by  conventional  financial \ninstitutions. Bangladesh is the starkest example of a very poor country, where currently \nroughly  one  quarter  of  rural  households  are  direct  beneficiaries  of  these  programs \n(Khandker  2003).  Much  has  been  written  on  the  rapnge  of  institutional  arrangements \npursued in different organizations and countries and in turn a vast number studies have \nattempted  to  assess  the  outreach  and  poverty  impact  of  such  schemes.  However, \namongst  the  academic  development  community there  is  a  recognition  that  perhaps  we \nknow much less about the impact of these programs than might be expected given the \nenthusiasm  for  these  activities  in  donor  and  policy-making  circles.  To  quote  a  recent \nauthoritative volume on micro finance: \n\n\u201cMFI field operations have far surpassed the research capacity to analyze them, \nso  excitement  about  the  use  of  micro  finance  for  poverty  alleviation  is  not  backed  up \nwith sound facts derived from rigorous research. Given the current state of knowledge, \nit  is  difficult  to  allocate  confidently  public  resources  to  microfinance  development.\u201d \n(Zeller and Meyer 2002). \n\nThis is a very strong statement of doubt and in part reflects a lack of accurate \ndata, but also in part methodological difficulties associated with assessing exactly what \nproportion of income and other effects on the beneficiaries of micro credit can actually \nbe  attributed  to  the  programs  themselves.  In  recognition  of  this  uncertainty  this  paper \naims to bring  together  some of the  recent  evidence that  has been  accumulating on the \nimpact of microfinance activities on poverty reduction. In particular we ask what is the \nevidence on three specific issues.   \n \n\n\u2212 \n\n\u2212 \n\nthe  extent  to  which  microfinance  initiatives  have  made  a  lasting  difference  in \npulling households out of poverty on a permanent basis; \nthe extent to which microfinance programs reach only the better-off amongst the \npoor, leaving the \u2018core poor\u2019 unaffected; \n\n\u2212  how  far  micro  finance  is  a  cost-effective  means  of  transferring  income  to  the \n\npoor. \n\n                                                 \n\u2020 John Weiss is Research Director and Heather Montgomery is a Research Fellow at the ADB Institute. \nAt  the  time  of  writing  Elvira  Kurmanalieva  was  a  Research  Associate  at  the  ADB  Institute.    This  first \ndraft of this paper was presented at the 2003 ADB Institute Annual Conference on \u201cMicrofinance in Asia: \nPoverty Impact and Outreach to the Poor,\u201d Tokyo, 5 December 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n1\n\n\fThese are very basic questions and the fact that they can still be posed reflects \n\nthe extent of uncertainty in the literature. \n\nThe paper is organized in four sections. The first provides a brief overview of \nsome  of  the  features  of  microfinance  activities  in  Asia,  which  is  our  region  of  focus. \nThe  second  discusses  a  few  concepts  from  the  poverty  literature  and  links  these  with \nmicrofinance programs. The third surveys the evidence from recent research studies on \nthe first two of the three questions posed above. The fourth section addresses the third \nquestion.  Since a number of other surveys are also available we give most attention to \nevidence  produced  in  the  last  three  or  four  years.1  Finally  we  draw  some  brief \nconclusions. \n\n2.  Some Features of Micro Finance in Asia \n\n\u201cAsia  is  the  most  developed  continent  in  the  world  in  terms  of  volume  of  MFI \n(microfinance  institution)  activities.\u201d    This  conclusion,  drawn  by  Lapeneu  and  Zeller \n(2001:27),  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  over  1,500  institutions  from  85  developing \ncountries.  Comparing MFIs in Asia with those in Africa and Latin America, the study \nfound  that  in  the  1990s  Asia  accounted  for  the  majority  of  MFIs,  retained  the  highest \nvolume of savings and credit, and served more members than any other continent.   \n\nThis  generalization  of  course  covers  up  some  wide  disparities  within  the \nregion.  East Asia is particularly well served by MFIs.  The largest number of members \nserved and the largest distribution of loans and mobilization of savings in terms of GNP \nis found in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.  In contrast, the two most \npopulated countries in Asia, India and the PRC, have very low outreach, despite a high \nconcentration  of  the  regions  poor.    Countries  such  as  Afghanistan,  Myanmar  and \nPakistan also have low outreach due to a variety of factors.   \n\nDespite  these  disparities  within  the  region,  overall  it  is  said  that  MFIs  have \nflourished in Asia and that  compared to other regions they exhibit good outreach and \nhigh  repayment  rates.2    Table  1  below  presents  the  most  recent  data  from  the \nMicrobanking  Bulletin,  which  gives  only  data  on  the  limited  number  of  MFIs  who \nchoose  to  report  to  the  Bulletin.  Those  reporting  to  the  Bulletin  are  thought  to  be \namongst  the  best  and  are  therefore  unlikely  to  be  representative  (Meyer  2002:  14). \nNonetheless  amongst  these,  by  various  measures,  Asian  MFIs  demonstrate  relatively \ngood  outreach.    They account for  the largest number of borrowers (70% of which are \nwomen) and are second only to African MFIs in terms of number of voluntary savers.  \nIn  terms  of  impact,  size  of loans  and deposits are  often taken as a simple indicator of \nimpact  on  the  poor.  By  these  criteria,  Asian  MFIs  have  among  the  lowest  Loan  and \nSavings Balance per Borrower, even after adjusting for GNP per capita, suggesting that \nthey are effectively reaching the poor.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  An  earlier  helpful  survey  published  by  ADBI  is  Meyer  (2002).  This  draws  out  some  of  the \nmethodological problems in assessing impact and surveys a number of important studies available at the \ntime of the writing (around 2001). Morduch (1999) is an extremely authoritative earlier survey focusing \non both conceptual and empirical questions. \n2 Lapenu and Zeller (2001:28) table 16. \n\n \n\n2\n\n\fTable 1.

These  include  unregulated  NGOs,  credit  unions  or  co-\noperatives  (which  are  often  regulated),  registered  banking  institutions  (either  banks  or \nnon-bank  financial  institutions)  and  government  organizations.  In  some  cases  the \ninstitutional forms blur into one another with government banks operating microfinance \nservices in collaboration with NGOs or credit co-operatives. \n\nIn recent years there has been a significant shift in both thinking and practice in \nthe microfinance sector with MFIs coming to be seen as providing a range of financial \nservices to the poor, including savings facilities, not just micro credit. The intellectual \nargument  for  this  comes  from  the  insight  that  the  poor  have  a  strong  need  to  manage \ntheir very limited resources and that various forms of savings play an important role in \nhousehold budgeting by the poor (Rutherford 2000). The practical demonstration of this \nis the shift from the original Grameen model of micro credit for productive purposes to \nGrameen Mark II with its emphasis on a range of flexible financial products, including \nloans of varying repayment periods for consumption as well as investment and various \nshort and longer-term savings accounts (Rutherford 2003).  \n\nIn  parallel  with  this  reappraisal  of  micro  finance  within  the  NGO  sector  has \ngone  a  move  towards  the  transformation  of  NGOs  into  regulated  financial  institutions \nwith a view to allowing them to tap non-donor sources of funding and to offer a wider \nrange of financial services. This trend, which has seen 39 important NGOs (15 in Asia) \ntransformed  over  the  period  1992-2003,  places  micro  finance  squarely  within  the \nconventional financial sector and raises important issues of governance and regulation \nin  connection  with  the  new  institutions  (Fernando  2003).  Given  that  the  failure  of \ncommercial  financial  institutions  to  reach  the  poor  provided  the  initial  impetus  for \nMFIs, this new trend is paradoxical and raises questions as to whether the initial poverty \nreduction objectives of the transformed NGOs will be subjugated to commercial criteria \n(so-called  \u2018mission  drift\u2019),  although  Fernando  (2003)  argues  that  as  yet  there  is  little \nevidence of this. \n\n \n\n3\n\n\f3.  Poverty and Micro Finance \n\nHere we define poverty as an income (or more broadly welfare) level below a socially \nacceptable  minimum  and  micro  finance  as  one  of  a  range  of  innovative  financial \narrangements  designed  attract  the  poor  as  either  borrowers  or  savers.  In  terms  of \nunderstanding  poverty  a  simple  distinction  can  be  drawn  within  the  group  \u2018the  poor\u2019 \nbetween the long-term or \u2018chronic poor\u2019 and those who temporarily fall into poverty as \na result of adverse shocks, the \u2018transitory poor\u2019. Within the chronic poor one can further \ndistinguish  between  those  who  are  either  so  physically  or  socially  disadvantaged  that \nwithout  welfare  support  they  will  always  remain  in  poverty  (the  \u2018destitute\u2019)  and  the \nlarger group who are poor because of their lack of assets and opportunities. Furthermore \nwithin the non-destitute category one may distinguish by the depth of poverty (how far \nhouseholds are below the poverty line) with those significantly below it representing the \n\u2018core poor\u2019, who are sometimes categorized by the irregularity of their income.  \n\nIn principle, micro finance can relate to the chronic (non-destitute) poor and to \nthe  transitory  poor  in  different  ways.  The  condition  of  poverty  has  been  interpreted \nconventionally  as  a  lack  of  access  by  poor  households  to  the  assets  necessary  for  a \nhigher standard of income or welfare, whether assets are thought of as human (access to \neducation), natural (access to land), physical (access to infrastructure), social (access to \nnetworks of obligations) or financial (access to credit) (World Bank 2000:34).  Lack of \naccess to credit is readily understandable in terms of the absence of collateral that the \npoor can offer conventional financial institutions, in addition to the various complexities \nand  high  costs  involved  in  dealing  with  large  numbers  of  small,  often  illiterate, \nborrowers.  The  poor  thus  have  to  rely  on  loans  from  either  moneylenders,  at  high \ninterest  rates,  or  friends  and  family,  whose  supply  of  funds  will  be  limited. \nMicrofinance  institutions  attempt  to  overcome  these  barriers  through  innovative \nmeasures  such  as  group  lending  and  regular  savings  schemes,  as  well  as  the \nestablishment of close links between poor clients and staff of the institutions concerned. \nAs noted above, the range of possible relationships and the mechanisms employed are \nvery wide.  \n\nThe case for micro finance as a mechanism for poverty reduction is simple. If \naccess to credit can be improved, it is argued, the poor can finance productive activities \nthat will allow income growth, provided there are no other binding constraints. This is a \nroute out of poverty for the non-destitute chronic poor. For the transitory poor, who are \nvulnerable to fluctuations in income that can bring them close to or below the poverty \nline,  micro  finance  provides  the  possibility  of  credit  at  times  of  need  and  in  some \nschemes the opportunity of regular savings by a household itself can be drawn on. The \navoidance of sharp declines in family expenditures by drawing on such credit or savings \nallows  \u2018consumption  smoothing.\u2019  In  practice  the  distinction  between  the  needs  of  the \nchronic  and  transitory  poor  for  credit  for  \u2018promotional\u2019  (that  is  income  creating)  and \n\u2018protectional\u2019 (consumption smoothing) purposes, respectively, is over-simplified, since \nthe chronic poor will also have short term needs that have to be met, whether it is due to \nincome  shortfalls  or  unexpected  expenditures  like  medical  bills  or  social  events  like \nweddings or funerals. In fact, it is one of the most interesting generalizations to emerge \nfrom the micro finance and poverty literature that the poorest of the chronic poor (the \ncore  poor)  will  borrow  essentially  for  protectional  purposes  given  both  the  low  and \nirregular  nature  of  their  income.  This  group  it  is  suggested  will  be  too  risk  averse  to \n\n \n\n4\n\n\fborrow for promotional measures (that is investment in the future) and will therefore be \nonly  a  very  limited  beneficiary  of  microfinance  schemes  (Hulme  and  Mosley  1996: \n132).3  \n\nThe view that it is the less badly-off poor, who benefit principally from micro \nfinance,  has  become  highly  influential  and,  for  example,  was  repeated  in  the  World \nDevelopment Report on poverty  (World Bank 2000:75). Apart from the risk aversion \nargument noted above a number of other explanations for this outcome have been put \nforward.  A  related  issue  refers  to  the  interest  rates  charged  to  poor  borrowers.  Most \nmicrofinance schemes charge close to market-clearing interest rates (although these will \noften not be enough to ensure full cost-recovery given the high cost per loan of small-\nscale  lending).    It  may  be  that,  even  setting  aside  risk-aversion  argument,  such  high \nrates  are  unaffordable  to  the  core  poor  given  their  lack  of  complementary  inputs;  in \nother  words,  despite  having  a  smaller  amount  of  capital,  marginal  returns  to  the  core \npoor  may  be  lower  than  for  the  better-off  poor.  If  the  core  poor  cannot  afford  high \ninterest rates they will either not take up the service or take it up and get into financial \ndifficulties. Also where group lending is used, other members of the group may exclude \nthe very poor because they are seen as a bad credit risk, jeopardizing the position of the \ngroup as a whole. Alternatively, where professional staff operate as loan officers, they \nmay  exclude  the  very  poor  from  borrowing,  again  on  grounds  of  repayment  risk.  In \ncombination, these factors, it is felt by many, explain the weakness of micro finance in \nreaching the core poor.4 \n\nEven  where  micro  finance  does  reach  the  core  poor,  when  (as  in  many \ninstances)  donor  or  government  funds  are  required  to  subsidize  the  microfinance \ninstitutions  involved,  it  is  not  inevitably  the  case  that  this  is  an  efficient  strategy.  As \nfunds  are  fungible  within  households,  the  use  of  the  loan  is  not  the  issue  and  what \nmatters is the cost of transferring the funds through a micro credit institution per dollar \nreceived  by  the  target  group,  as  compared  with  the  benefit-cost  ratio  for  alternative \nschemes  for  reaching  the  core  poor,  such  as  food  subsidies,  workfare,  integrated \nregional  development  initiatives  and  so  forth.  Such  comparisons  must  take  account  of \nnot just the administrative costs involved, but also the leakage rate (that is the benefits \nto the non-poor).    \n\nGiven  the  new  trends  in  the  sector  and  their  possible  effect  in  diluting  the \noriginal poverty focus of MFIs the question of their impact on the poor (and particularly \nthe  core  poor)  is  clearly  of  great  policy  interest.  It  might  be  thought  that  if  such \ninstitutions are designed to serve only poor clients and if repayment rates are high, no \nfurther detailed analysis is needed. Such a view is misleading for a number of reasons. \nFirst,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  only  the  poor  will  be  served  unless  strong  eligibility \n\n                                                 \n3 Morduch (2003) points out that, although this argument may be true, the data in Hulme and Mosley\u2019s \nbook cannot be used to infer this since the arithmetic basis for their comparison of income changes for \ndifferent categories of borrowers, biasing their results in favor of their conclusion.  \n4  An  important  attempt  to  address  this  problem  has  been  the  Income  Generation  for  Vulnerable  Group \nDevelopment  (IGVGD) program  run  by  BRAC  in  Bangladesh, which  combines  measures  of  livelihood \nprotection  (food  aid)  with  measures  of  livelihood  promotion  (skills  training  and  micro  credit).  Hence, \nmicro credit is provided as part of a package approach. Matin and Hulme (2003) survey the evidence on \nhow far the benefits of this program actually reach the core poor and conclude that although the program \nwas more successful than more conventional micro credit schemes, nonetheless many target households \nwere still missed.  \n\n \n\n5\n\n\fcriteria  (like  land  ownership)  are  enforced.  Often  the  aim  is  to  dissuade  the  non-poor \nwith the inconvenience of frequent meetings or the stigma of being a member of a credit \ngroup of the poor. Such disincentives need not work and eligibility criteria where they \nexist may not be enforced. Second, high repayment rates may be due to social pressure \nwithin a group or family and may not reflect the capacity to repay (if for example loans \nfrom  moneylenders  have  to  be  taken  out  to repay the micro credit).  Third,  even if  the \npoor are genuinely served by MFIs, as long a public funds are required to finance the \nMFI there is the issue of how cost-effective this means of reaching the poor is compared \nwith alternatives. Hence for these sorts of reasons, there is a strong case for attempting \nto assess the impact of such loans on the welfare of the target group.  \n\nNonetheless assessing the true relationship between microfinance services and \npoverty reduction is not straightforward. It is not simply a case of looking at a group of \nborrowers,  observing  their  income  change  after  they  took  out  micro  credits  and \nestablishing  who  has  risen  above  the  poverty  line.  Accurate  assessment  requires  a \nrigorous test of the counterfactual\u2014that is how income (or whatever measure is used) \nwith a micro credit compares with what it would be without it, with the only difference \nin both cases being the availability of credit. Empirically, this requires a control group \nidentical in characteristics to the recipients of credit and engaged in the same productive \nactivities,  who  have  not  received  credit,  and  whose  income  (or  other  measure)  can  be \ntraced through time to compare with that of the credit recipients.5 Furthermore, to allow \nfor  changes  over  time,  in  principle  assessments  should  allow  for  the  possibility  of \nreversals,  with  households  slipping  back  below  the  poverty  line  if  the  productive \nactivities  financed  by  the  credits  are  unsustainable.  Studies  based  on  a  rigorous \ncounterfactual  find  much  smaller  gains  from  micro  finance  than  simple  unadjusted \n\u2018before  and  after\u2019  type  comparisons,  which  erroneously  attribute  all  gains  to  micro \ncredit.  \n\nHere we examine some of the recent \u2018scientific\u2019 studies on the impact of MFIs \nbased  on  various  survey  data.  We  do  not  report  the  results  of  work  based  on  more \nqualitative  or  participatory  approaches.6  Table  2  summarizes  the  results  of  the  studies \nsurveyed here. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n5 Coleman (2001) has a useful non-technical explanation of the difficulties of applying this approach and \neliminating \u2018selection\u2019 and \u2018placement\u2019 bias in micro credit studies. \n6  See  Hulme  (1999) for  a discussion of different  approaches  to  impact.  He  points out  that  despite  their \ncost  in  funds  and  time,  such  scientific  studies  involving  detailed  sample  surveys  are  the  most  common \napproach where the aim is to establish impact for policy or investment purposes.  \n\n \n\n6\n\n\fTable 2.

Poverty Impact  \n\nOne  of  the  early  and  most  widely  cited  of  the  poverty  impact  studies  is  Hulme  and \nMosley  (1996).  This  employed  a  control  group  approach  looking  at  the  changes  in \nincome for households in villages with microfinance programs and changes for similar \nhouseholds  in  non-program  areas.  Programs  in  a  number  of  countries  are  considered \nincluding  the  Grameen  Bank  in  Bangladesh  and  the  Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI).  In \ngeneral a positive impact is found on borrower incomes of the poor (1988-92) with on \naverage  an  increase  over  the  control  groups  ranging  from  10-12%  in  Indonesia,  to \naround 30% in Bangladesh and India  (Hulme and Mosley 1996, table 8.1). Gains are \nlarger  for  non-poor  borrowers,  however,  and  within  the  group  the  poor  gains  are \nnegatively correlated with income. However, despite the breadth of the study and its use \nof  control  group  techniques,  it  has  been  criticized  for  a  possible  \u2018placement\u2019  bias, \nwhereby microfinance programs may be drawn to better placed villages, so that part of \nthe advantage relative to the control group may be due to this more favorable location. \nFurther,  the  quality  and  accuracy  of  some  of  the  data,  particularly  in  relation  to  the \nrepresentative nature of the control groups, has been questioned (Morduch 1999:1600). \n\n \n\n10\n\n\fAnother major early initiative that has provided some of the firmest empirical \nwork  were  the  surveys  conducted  in  the  1990s  by  the  Bangladesh  Institute  of \nDevelopment Studies (BIDS) and the World Bank; these provided the data for several \nmajor  analyses,  such  as  Pitt  and  Khandker  (1998).    Khandker  (1998)  summarizes  a \nnumber  of  different  studies  conducted  in  Bangladesh  using  the  1991/92  survey  and \nfocusing  on  three  major  microfinance  programs,  including  the  Grameen  Bank  and  the \nBangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  (BRAC).  Methodologically  impact  is \nassessed using a double-difference approach between eligible and ineligible households \n(with  land  holdings  of  more  than  half  an  acre  making  households  ineligible)  and \nbetween program and non-program villages. After controlling for other factors, such as \nvarious  household  characteristics,  any  remaining  difference  was  attributed  to  the \nmicrofinance programs. The study draws a number of conclusions, but the main one is \nthat  the  program  had  a  positive  effect  on  household  consumption,  which  was \nsignificantly greater for female borrowers. On average, a loan of 100 taka to a female \nborrower, after it is repaid, allows a net consumption increases of 18 taka. In terms of \npoverty  impact  it  is  estimated  that  5%  of  participant  households  are  pulled  above  the \npoverty line annually.  \n\nKhandker  (2003)  follows  up  this  earlier  work  by  employing  panel  data.  He \nuses  the  BIDS\uf8e7World  Bank  survey  conducted  in  1998-99  that  traced  the  same \nhouseholds from the 1991-92 survey.7  He finds apparently strong and positive results. \nWhilst borrowing by males appears to have no significant impact on consumption, that \nby females, who are the dominant client group, does have a positive impact. From this \nanalysis a 100 taka loan to a female client leads to a 10.5 taka increase in consumption \n(compared  with  18  taka  in  the  earlier  analysis).  Allowing  for  the  impact  of  higher \nconsumption  on  poverty  gives  estimates  of  poverty  impact.  It  is  estimated  that  due  to \nparticipation  in  microfinance  programs  moderate  poverty  among  program  participants \ndecreased  8.5  percentage  points  over  the  period  of  seven  years  and  extreme  poverty \ndropped  about  18  points  over  the  same  period.8  He  also  finds  evidence  of  positive \nspillovers on non-program participants in the villages with the impact greater for those \nin  extreme  poverty.  Poverty  for  non-participants  is  found  to  decline  by  1  percentage \npoint  due  to  the  programs  whilst  extreme  poverty  declines  by  nearly  5  percentage \npoints. This impact is due solely to female borrowing. \n\nThe same data set has also been used to identify health impacts as opposed to \nincome  changes.  Pitt  et  al.  (2003)  find  that  credit  going  to  females  has  a  large  and \nsignificant impact in two out of three health measures for children. Male borrowing has \nno  such  effect.  For  example,  a  10%  increase  in  credit  to  females  increases  the  arm \ncircumference of daughters by 6.3%, the height of girls by 0.36 cm annually and of boys \nby 0.50 cms. The relations are stronger for daughters than sons. Hence in Bangladesh, \nmicro credit and improved family health appear to be related. \n\nThese  are  strong  and  positive  results  and  probably  are  the  clearest  evidence \nthere is that micro finance is working in the way intended to bring sustained relief from \n\n                                                 \n7 Technically the study is rigorous in employing a two stage instrumental variable approach along with a \nhousehold  fixed-effects  method  to  control  for  possible  endogeneity  bias,  particularly  for  the  fixed \nunobserved characteristics of households (that is the more entrepreneurial amongst the poor are those who \nborrow and these may do better anyway).   \n8 Poverty is based on a daily calorie intake of 2,112 and extreme poverty on one of 1,739. \n\n \n\n11\n\n\fpoverty.  However  a  couple  of  caveats  are  in  order.  First,  the  accuracy  of  the  original \nresults as presented in Pitt and Khandker (1998) has been disputed on the grounds that \nthe  eligibility  criteria  of  low  land  holdings  was  not  enforced  strictly  in  practice.  In  a \nreworking of the results focusing on what are claimed to be more directly comparable \nhouseholds,  no  impact  on  consumption  from  participation  in  a  program  is  found \n(Morduch  1999:1605).9  Second,  in  the  BIDs-World  Bank  survey  data,  the  \u2018ultra  poor\u2019 \n(defined as those with less than 0.2 acres of land) form nearly 60% of participants and \nthe  likelihood  of  participation  is  strongly  and  negatively  associated  with  level  of  land \nholding.  Nonetheless,  how  much \nthe \nentrepreneurship  of  households,  so  that  the  charge  that  the  risk-averse  very  poor  will \nbenefit less has not been totally dispelled. Furthermore, the panel data reveal a relatively \nhigh  dropout  rate  of  around  30%,  indicating  that  there  were  problems  for  many \nhouseholds. \n\nis  borrowed  depends  principally  on \n\nThere  are  examples  of  many  other  studies  that  are  either  inconclusive  or \nprovide less convincing results. Coleman (1999) and MkNelly et al. (1996) both focus \non  experiences  with  village  banking  in  Thailand.  Coleman  (1999)  utilizes  data  on \nvillages  that  had  participated  in  village  bank  microfinance  schemes  and  those  control \nvillages that were designated as participants, but had not yet participated. This allows a \ndouble  difference  approach  that  compares  the  difference  between  income  for \nparticipants  and  non-participants  in  program  villages  with  the  same  difference  in  the \ncontrol  villages,  where  the  programs  were  introduced  later.  From  the  results  here,  the \npoverty  impact  of  the  schemes  appears  highly  dubious.  Months  of  village  bank \nmembership have no impact on any asset or income variables and there is no evidence \nthat village bank loans were directed to productive  purposes.  The  small  sizes  of  loans \nmean  that  they  were  largely  used  for  consumption,  but  one  of  the  reasons  there  is  a \nweak poverty impact is that there was a tendency for wealthier households to self-select \ninto village banks. \n\nColeman  (2004)  uses  the  same  survey  data  but  reconsiders  the  estimation \nstrategy  to  control  for  self-selection.  He  argues  that  the  village  bank  methodology, \nwhich  relies  on  self-selection  by  loan  size  and  monitoring  by  frequent  meetings,  may \nnot  reach  the  poorest.  As  many  wealthy  households  tend  to  be  on  village  bank \ncommittees,  the  failure  to  control  for  this  leads  to  systematic  biases.  The  regression \nresults  of  Coleman  (2004)  indicate  that  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between \nordinary  members  and  committee  members  of  village  banks.  The  impact  of  micro \ncredits on ordinary members\u2019 well being is either insignificantly different from zero or \nnegative. On the contrary, the impact of microfinance programs on committee members\u2019 \nmeasures  of  wealth,  such  as  income,  savings,  productive  expenses  and  labor  time  is \npositive,  implying  a  form  of  program  capture  by  the  better-off  in  the  village,  even \nthough this group may not be well-off by national standards. A similar result in terms of \nrationing micro credit in favor of better-off groups or members is found by Doung and \nIzumida (2002) in a study of six villages in Viet Nam. There whilst credit availability is \nlinked  with  production  and  income,  household  economic  position  and  prestige  in  a \n\n                                                 \n9 This debate, which in part centers around details of econometric estimation, has not been resolved. An \nunpublished paper by Pitt reworks the original analysis to address the concerns of Morduch and is said to \nconfirm the original results (Khandker 2003, footnote 1). \n\n \n\n12\n\n\fvillage plus the amount of credit applied for are the main determinants of how credit is \nallocated. \n\nMkNelly  et  al.  (1996)  evaluated  the  Freedom  from  Hunger  credit  with \neducation  program  in  Thailand  operated  through  village  banks.  The  results  show \npositive benefits, however, although non-participants in non-program villages are used \nas controls, there are problems in accepting the results. No statistical tests are reported, \nso one cannot judge whether differences between participants and non-participants are \nsignificant.    There  is  also  a  potential  measurement  bias  since  the  staff  responsible  for \nthe program also did the interviewing. \n\nChen  and  Snodgrass  (2001)  examine  the  operations  of  the  Self  Employed \nWomen\u2019s  Association  (SEWA)  bank  in  India,  which  provides  low-income  female \nclients in the informal sector with both saving and loan services. The study tests for the \nimpact  of  these  services  by  comparing  the  bank\u2019s  clients  against  a  randomly  selected \ncontrol  group  in  a  similar  geographic  area.  Two  surveys  were  conducted  two  years \napart.  Average  incomes  rose  over  time  for  all  groups\u2014borrowers,  savers  and  the \ncontrol\u2014although  the  increase  was  less  for  the  latter.  In  terms  of  poverty  incidence \nthere  was  little  overall  change,  although  there  was  substantial  \u2018churning\u2019,  in  that \namongst  the  clients  of  SEWA  there  was  quite  a  lot  of  movement  above  or  below  the \npoverty line. In interpreting these results Meyer (2002) argues that the evidence on the \ncounterfactual,  that  is  what  would  have  happened  to  the  clients  in  the  absence  of  the \nservices of SEWA, is not sufficiently strongly established to draw any firm conclusions \non poverty impact. \n\nThe  smoothing  of  consumption  over  time  to  protect  the  poor  against  adverse \nshocks  is  one  of  the  principle  objectives  of  micro  credit.  Using  data  again  for \nBangladesh, Amin et al. (2003) compute several measures of vulnerability.10 They find \nthat the micro credit participants in the two villages covered are more likely to be below \nthe  poverty  line  than  if  they  had  been  selected  at  random,  so  that  the  programs  have \nreached  the  poor.  However,  the  vulnerable  are  more  likely  to  join  a  micro  credit \nprogram in only one of the two villages. Further, for the vulnerable below the poverty \nline in one village, there is no evidence that there are more likely to be members of a \nprogram, and in the other village there is evidence that they have either chosen not to \njoin or are actively excluded, presumably on the grounds that they are a poor credit risk. \nHence the very poor and vulnerable do not appear to be reached.  \n\nMore  positive  conclusions  in  terms  of  the  ability  of  micro  finance  to  reduce \nvulnerability  are  found  for  Indonesia  by  Gertler  et  al.  (2003),  who  find  that  access  to \nmicro finance helps households to smooth consumption in the face of declines in health \nof adult family members. Having established an empirical relationship between health \ncondition and consumption, the authors test for a relation between access to a financial \ninstitution  and  consumption  shortfalls  associated  with  ill  health.  Using  geographic \ndistance  as  a  measure  of  access,  they  find  that  for  households  in  an  area  with  a  BRI \n\n                                                 \n10 Unlike the Khandker studies this data picks up households before they joined a micro credit scheme. \nTheir vulnerability measure is broader than simply fluctuations in consumption. \n\n \n\n13\n\n\fbranch, health shocks have no effect on consumption.11  This study does not differentiate \nwithin the group of the poor. \n\n5.  Forms of Micro Credit Interventions and Cost-effectiveness \n\nExperimentation  and  local  variation  are  likely  to  be  important  aspects  of  successful \nMFIs.  A  few  studies  have  looked  in  detail  at  the  impact  and  cost  effectiveness  of \ndifferent forms of intervention. For example, Park and Ren (2001) look at the Chinese \nexperience drawing on household survey data for 1997. They are able to compare three \ntypes  of  programs  based  on  ownership  characteristics\u2014NGO-based,  mixed  programs \nand  government  ownership.  Whether  in  terms  of  conventional  financial  criteria  like \nrepayment  rates,  or  measures  of  initial  impact  like  targeting  effectiveness,  the  NGO \nprograms  appear  to  function  best,  with  the  government-run  programs  the  least \nsuccessful. \n\nDetailed mechanisms for micro lending are examined for Thailand by Kaboski \nand  Townsend  (2003),  who  look  at  different  institutional  variants  such  as  production \ncredit  groups,  women\u2019s  groups,  rice  banks  and  buffalo  banks,  as  well  as  a  variety  of \nservices  included  training  and  various  savings  facilities.  Of  the  forms  of  institutions, \nallowing  for  a  range  of  other  factors,  the  women\u2019s  groups  appear  to  have  the  largest \npositive impact on their members. Of the services offered, training in conjunction with \ncredit  appears  to  work  well  and  the  availability  of  savings  facilities  appears  to  be \nassociated  with  asset  growth  amongst  households.  Of  the  savings  services,  regular \n\u2018pledged savings\u2019 have the largest positive impact. Explanations offered for this include \nthe use of savings as collateral for further loans either from the institution itself or from \nother  sources,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  and  risk  of  infrequent  deposits  and \nwithdrawals.  However  since  the  poorest  may  not  be  in  a  position  of  offer  regular \nsavings this also provides an explanation for why they may benefit relatively less from \nMFIs.12  \n\nMost studies of the impact of different forms of micro finance do not conduct a \nfull  cost  effectiveness  analysis  in  order  to  judge  both  the  effectiveness  of  different \nalternatives and how microfinance interventions compare in efficiency terms with other \nways of reaching the poor. However, there is often a general expectation that MFIs are \nan  effective  and  efficient  means  of  reaching  the  poor.  For  example,  Wright  (2000) \nargues that \u201c...micro finance has a particular advantage over almost (and probably) all \nother interventions\u201d in providing cost-effective and sustainable services to the poor.  \n\nThe early work by Khandker (1998) attempts to assess the cost-effectiveness of \nmicro  credit  in  Bangladesh  (that  is  costs  per  taka  of  consumption  for  the  poor)  as \ninstitutions  and  other  poverty-targeted \ncompared  with  more  formal  financial \ninterventions.  His  data  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  They  appear  to  be  based  on  the \nassumption of a zero leakage rate to the non-poor. The interesting result that emerges is \nthat the Grameen Bank is considerably more effective than BRAC and that, as expected, \nloans  to  female  borrowers  are  considerably  more  cost-effective  than  loans  to  males. \n\n                                                 \n11  Patten  et  al  (2001)  find  evidence  that  the  micro  finance  side  of  the  Indonesian  banking  system \nperformed much more robustly during the macro crises of the late 1990s than did the commercial banking \nsector. \n12 Fujita (2000) makes this point in the context of Bangladesh. \n\n \n\n14\n\n\fFurther,  subsidies  to  Grameen  (but  not  to  BRAC)  appear  to  be  a  more  cost  effective \nmeans  of  reaching  the  poor  than  various  \u2018food  for  work\u2019  programs.  However,  a  \u2018food \nfor education\u2019 scheme appeared to be very cost effective relative to the \u2018food for work\u2019 \nprograms  and  to  BRAC.13    Formal  financial  institutions  are  less  cost-effective  than \nGrameen  for  both  female  and  male  borrowers  and  less  cost  effective  than  BRAC  in \nsome, but not all, cases examined (Khandker 1998:134-139). The high figure for BRAC \nis in part due to the range of services, such as training, offered in addition it micro credit \n(see  footnote  4),  but  nonetheless  if  such  services  are  essential  to  the  success  of  micro \ncredit, including their cost in a cost-benefit assessment of micro credit is legitimate. \n\nIt  is  interesting  to  note  that  Khandker  does  not  conclude  from  this  that  all \nsubsidies  to  other poverty  interventions should be withdrawn and reallocated to micro \nfinance.  Rather  he  points  out  that  as  participants  to  micro  credit  borrowing  self-select \n(that is they judge that micro credit suits their particular needs, often for self employed \nwork)  others  amongst  the  poor  may  not  be  able  to  benefit.  For  this  latter  group  other \nforms of targeting will still be required.  \n\n \nTable 3.

The  figures  for  Grameen \nsupport  this  view,  whilst  those  for  BRAC  do  not.  More  recently  a  couple  of  other \n                                                 \n13  The  study  on  this  scheme  by  Wodon  (1998)  appears  considerably  more  sophisticated  than  the  other \nstudies and compares costs with the future stream of estimated benefits to the poor in terms of gains from \neducation. The ratio for this activity may not be directly comparable with the other figures in the table. \n\n \n\n15\n\n\festimates  have  become  available.  Burgess  and  Pande  (2003)  examine  whether  the \npattern of commercial bank expansion in India into rural areas, previously not served by \nbanks, has had an impact on rural poverty and their work allows a simple comparison \nwith  micro  finance.  Their  estimates  suggest  that  it  costs  2.72  rupees  to  generate  an \nadditional rupee of income for the poor via social banking programs. Compared with the \ndata  in  Table  3  this  ratio  is  higher  than  the  cost-effectiveness  ratio  for  Grameen,  but \nlower than that for BRAC.14  \n\nA further look at the effectiveness of Grameen is provided by Schreiner (2003), \nwho  calculates  the  subsidy-lending  ratio  at  0.22  over  the  period  1983-97.  This  is  not \ndirectly equivalent to the ratios in Table 3, but assuming the same return to borrowing \nas in Khandker (1998) these figures can be converted into a broadly equivalent ratio of \ncost to gains to the poor of 1.15. This is consistent with the figures in Table 3, which \nwould  need  to  be  averaged  to  give  an  overall  return  to  male  and  female  borrowing \ncombined.  The  result  confirms  Grameen  as  a  relatively  cost-effective  form  of  poverty \nintervention,  although  it  says  nothing  about  how  the  benefits  from  its  activities  are \ndistributed between the poor, the very poor and those above the poverty line. \n\n6.  Conclusions \n\nDespite the extensive spread of micro finance, research studies on the actual impact of \nMFIs are often more ambivalent about its impact than is the aid community. In part this \nreflects the methodological problems of establishing appropriate statistical controls and \nin part no doubt also the range of variation found in practice in the way in which micro \nfinance operates.  Our view is that, despite the difficulties, more good poverty impact \nstudies  are  important  to  sharpen  understanding  of  its  role  as  an  anti-poverty  tool,  to \nassess its impact in different environments and to shape the debate on ways forward for \nMFIs. \n\nAmongst practitioners there is widespread acceptance of the view that it is both \nnecessary  to  diversify  the  products  of  micro  finance  and  adapt  them  to  local \ncircumstances.  Any  simple  replication  of  formulae  successful  elsewhere  is  rightly \ntreated  with  suspicion.  However  the  evidence  surveyed  here  suggests  that  the \nconclusion  from  the  early  literature,  that  whilst  micro  finance  clearly  may  have  had \npositive impacts on poverty it is unlikely to be a simple panacea for reaching the core \npoor, remains broadly valid. Reaching the core poor is difficult and some of the reasons \nthat made them difficult to reach with conventional financial instruments mean that they \nmay also be high risk and therefore unattractive microfinance clients. \n\nThere  has  been  an  extensive  debate,  which  we  do  not  touch  on  here,  on  the \nfinancial sustainability of MFIs. We would simply make the point that just because an \ninstitution needs a subsidy to cover its costs in itself is not a reason for not supporting \nthe institution. The issue should be, what benefits in terms of income gains for the poor \ncan be achieved with the subsidy and how does the ratio of subsidy to benefits compare \nwith that for other interventions. Detailed cost effectiveness studies are rare and those \nthat are available show both high and low scores for MFIs in the same country. Hence \n\n                                                 \n14 It should be noted that the benefits from Grameen lending found in Khandker (2003), which are almost \nhalf  of  those  found  in  his  earlier  study,  imply  considerably  higher  cost  effectiveness  ratios  to  those \nreported in Table 3, unless there has been a corresponding rise in the efficiency of operations. \n\n \n\n16\n\n\fthere is a need to continually improve design and outreach and to see MFIs as part of \nthe package for targeting the poor, rather than the whole solution.  \n\nOur  view  is  that  despite  the  difficulties,  poverty  impact  studies  of  MFIs  can \nprovide  important  information  and  that  continued  efforts  should  be  made  to  sharpen \nunderstanding of the impacts of different forms of MFI activity on the poor, including \ntheir cost-effectiveness. \n\n \n\n17\n\n\fReferences \n\n \nAmin S., Rai A.S., Ropa G.
