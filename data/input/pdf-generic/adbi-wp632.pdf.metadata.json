INTRODUCTION \n\nLi \n\nInfrastructure is defined as the provision of basic services to industries and households \n(Lee  and  Martini  1996).  It  typically  includes  energy  (power  generation  and  supply), \ntransport  (toll  roads,  light  rail  systems,  bridges, and  tunnels),  water (sewerage,  waste \nwater  treatment,  and  water  supply),  and  telecommunications  (telephones)  (Grimsey \nand Lewis 2002). To provide a broad picture of the development of infrastructure in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in this section, we first summarize its major trends \nand  features  in  the  past  2  decades.  We  then  conduct  a  cross-country  comparison  to \ngauge  the  status  of  infrastructure  in  the  PRC.  In  this  comparison,  we  pay  particular \nattention to the PRC and India in their infrastructure development progress.  \n\n1.1  Overview of Infrastructure Development in the PRC  \n\nExcept  for  waterways,  since  1978  all  types  of  transport  infrastructure  have  registered \ngrowth in the PRC, especially roads, airports, and petroleum and gas pipelines. From \n1978  to  2013,  the  length  of  the  road  network  increased  from  0.9  to  4.4  million \nkilometers (km), railways in operation increased from 51.7 to 103.1 thousand km, civil \naviation routes increased from 148.9 to 4,106.0 thousand km, and petroleum and gas \npipelines  increased  from  8.3  to  98.5  thousand  km.  Figure  1  shows  the  log  lengths  of \nalternative transportation routes and Figure 2 shows their growth rates. \n\nFigure 1: Logarithm of the Lengths of Different Transport Infrastructure \n\nSource: Statistics Yearbook of PRC. Various years. \n\n \n\nAmong highways of different grades, expressways have grown the most rapidly. Their \nlength  increased  from  100  km  in  1988  to  104,438  thousand  km  in  2013,  showing  \na  staggering  annual  compound  growth  rate  of  32.1%.  In  contrast,  the  length  of  all \nhighways (excluding village roads) grew at an annual compound rate of less than 4%. \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 2: Average Growth Rate of Infrastructure, 1978\u20132013 \n\nSource: Statistics Yearbook of the PRC. Various years. \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  differential  growth  rates  of  different  transport  infrastructure,  their \nrelative  share  in  passenger  transport  volume  has  changed  significantly,  as  highways \nhave  overtaken  railways  as  the  most  important  mode  of  passenger  transportation, \naccounting  for  nearly  55%  of  total  passenger  traffic,  while  the  share  of  railways  has \ndeclined. The importance of civil aviation has also increased dramatically (Figure 3). \n\nFigure 3: Relative Importance of Different Infrastructure in Passenger Transport, \n1978\u20132012 (%) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Statistics Yearbook of the PRC. Various years. \n\nIn terms of freight transportation, the importance of railroads has also declined steadily \nover the past 3 decades, while that of highways has increased (Figure 4). Interestingly, \nthere was a sudden and seemingly permanent shock to both waterways and highway \nshipping in 2008. It could be an impact of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, but we \nneed to treat this explanation cautiously, as it could also be due to changes in statistics \nmethodology (such as a change in the criteria for classifying transport as waterways or \nhighway shipping in the case of the mixed transport mode). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 4: Relative Importance of Different Infrastructure in Freight Transport, \n1978\u20132011 (%) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Statistics Yearbook of the PRC. Various years. \n\nOther  than  transport  infrastructure,  investment  in  electricity  generation  capacity  has \nalso  increased  steadily  and  rapidly,  registering  an  average  compound  growth  rate  of \napproximately 9.2% from 1971 to 2011 (Figure 5). \n\nFigure 5: Electricity Generation Capacity of the PRC (%), 1971\u20132011 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators. Various years. \n\nTo  provide  an  overview  of  the  relation  between  urbanization  and  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  the  PRC,  in  Figure  6,  we  compare  the  urbanization  process  with \ntelephone  ownership,  access  to  water  facilities,  and  access  to  sanitation  facilities.  In \ngeneral,  we  find  that  urban  infrastructure  in  the  PRC  has  improved  with  more \nurbanization.  The \nin \ntelecommunication  and  sanitation,  while  water  facilities  of  PRC  cities  have  improved \nafter 1990. Note that the telephone ownership rate started to decline in the mid-2000s, \nwhich  should  reflect  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  mobile  telecommunication \ntechnologies. \n\ninfrastructure  has  been  evident \n\nimprovement \n\nin  urban \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 6: Urbanization and Urban Infrastructure Development in the PRC,  \n1975\u20132013 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators. Various years. \n\n \n\n1.2  Cross-regional Distribution of Infrastructure \n\nGiven  the  vast  scope  of  the  PRC  and  uneven  natural  and  social  endowments  \nacross different regions, infrastructure investment has also been unbalanced. Cities in \nthe  more  developed  eastern  region  of  the  PRC  enjoy  higher  levels  of  services  in \ndifferent  infrastructure  types,  while  in  inland  provinces,  infrastructure  conditions  are \nmuch poorer. \n\nIf  we  take  interregional  transport  infrastructure  as  an  example,  the  majority  of  it \nconnects the central region of the PRC with the eastern regions (He and Duchin 2009). \nIn 1997, the transport infrastructure capacity between the central and eastern regions \nof the PRC was almost three times that of the central\u2013west transport capacity (Figure \n7). This implies that the density of transport infrastructure is much higher in the eastern \nregion  of  the  PRC,  which  is  endowed  with  less  than  10%  of  the  total  land  area  and  \n34% of the population. In contrast, the western region occupies 59% of the land area \nand  has  27%  of  the  population.  Nevertheless,  in  terms  of  the  economic  development  \nlevel, the higher density of transport infrastructure in the eastern region of the PRC is \nreasonable,  as  the  western  region\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita  was \nabout one-third that of the eastern region (National Statistical Bureau 1998). \n\nOver  time,  investment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  western regions  of  the  PRC  is \nexpected  to  catch  up.  According  to  the  official  plan,  the  east\u2013west  gap  in  transport \ninfrastructure is expected to significantly narrow by 2020 (Figure 7).* This is consistent \nwith the actual infrastructure investment trend, as indicated in Figure 8. The percentage \nof infrastructure investment in the western provinces increased over the period 2001\u2013\n2011,  exceeding  the  western  share  of  private  capital  investment  and  of GDP  by  wide \nmargins (Shi and Huang 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n*   Future  transportation  capacity  for  2020  is  projected  by  He  and  Duchin  (2009)  based  on  the  National \n\nTrunk Expressway Network Plan (Ministry of Communications 2004; Ministry of Railways 2005). \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 7: Relative Transport Density is Unbalanced Across the PRC,  \n1997, 2010, and 2020 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; kms = kilometers. \n\nSources: Ministry of Railways (2003); National Statistical Bureau (1998; 2004); He and Duchin (2009). \n\nFigure 8: Infrastructure versus Private Capital Investment  \nin the Western Provinces, 2001\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\nNote:  Calculations  are  based  on  the  real  value  of  provincial  infrastructure  investment,  private  capital \ninvestment, and GDP. All three lines correspond to the share of western provinces. \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Shi and Huang (2014). \n\n1.3  Cross-country Comparison of Infrastructure Development \n\nIn  this  section,  we  gauge  the  infrastructure  development  of  the  PRC  from  a  global \nperspective.  This  shows  that  the  development  of  infrastructure  in  the  PRC  has  been \nunbalanced  for  different  types  of  infrastructure.  Moreover,  it  also  provides  insight  to \nexplain  why  the  growth  rates  of  different  types  of  infrastructure  since  the  mid-1990s \nhave varied significantly. \n\nIn  Figure  9,  we  plot  the  country-level  log  electricity  capacity  against  log  GDP  using  \ndata  in  2011.  There  is  clearly  a  positive  relationship  between  electricity  infrastructure \nand  GDP.  The  electricity  capacity  level  of  the  PRC  is  higher  than  other  countries  of  \n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\ncomparable  economic  size,  including  India.  The  advantage  of  the  PRC  in  electricity \ninfrastructure  is  consistent  with  its  aggressive  investment  in  electricity  generation \ncapacity as shown in Figure 5. \n\nFigure 9: Cross-country Comparison in Electricity Generation Capacity, 2011 \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNotes: Y-axis: log(electricity generation capacity); X-axis: log(GDP); GDP in 2005 constant US$. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators.  \n\nFigure 10 plots the country-level log length of roads against log GDP using data from \n2000.  There  is  clearly  a  positive  relationship  between  roads  and  GDP.  Although  the \nroad stock of the PRC is significantly higher than that of India, it is well in line with the \nglobal  road  length\u2013GDP  relationship,  which  means  there  are  no  signs  the  PRC  has \noverinvested in roads. \n\nFigure 10: Cross-country Comparison in Roads, 2011 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNotes: Y-axis: log(road length); X-axis: log(GDP); GDP in 2005 constant US$. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators. \n\nIn  contrast,  the  railway  network  of  India  is  more  extensive  than  that  of  the  PRC \n(Figure 11).  Again,  the  railroad  stock  of  the  PRC  is  in  line  with  the  average  \nrailroad\u2013GDP relationship of the world. \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 11: Cross-country Comparison in Railways, 2011 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nNotes: Y-axis: log(rail length); X-axis: log(GDP); GDP in 2005 constant US$. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators. \n\nIn Figure 12, we plot the electricity capacity growth rate at the country level against the \nGDP  growth  rate  during  1990\u20132011.  We  find  that  electricity  growth  is  positively \nassociated with GDP growth of a country (with a correlation of 0.73). The PRC stands \nout with a high GDP growth rate of 10%. Its electricity infrastructure growth, at 10%, is \nalso  significant,  but  it  appears  in  line  with  the  electricity  supply  growth\u2013GDP  growth \nrelationship of the world. India has slower growth in electricity generation capacity, but \nit  is  consistent  with  its  GDP  growth  rate.  The  services  of  the  electricity  sector  are \nperceived to be less satisfactory in India than in the PRC according to the World Bank \nInvestment  Climate  Surveys  conducted  in  2003.  The  share  of  loss  of  sales  due  to \npower outage, as reported by surveyed managers, is 9% in India and 2% in the PRC. \nThis  indicates  that  the  service  quality  of  electricity  infrastructure  is  better  in  the  PRC  \n(Li et al. 2011). \n\nFigure 12: Electricity Generation Capacity Growth against GDP Growth,  \nCross-country \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nWe  next  turn  to  road  investment  (Figure  13).  We  find  that  road  growth  in  the  PRC  \nis  positively  associated  with  GDP  growth  (correlation:  0.39).  Despite  the  commonly \nreported  boom  in  road  investment  in  the  PRC,  we  find  that  road  growth  was  actually \nslightly below the average relationship of the world. The road length growth of India is \nalso higher than that of the PRC (Figure 10). \n\nFigure 13: Cross-country Scatter Plot of Road Growth against GDP Growth, 2011 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators.  \n\nNext, we examine railroad growth and find that it is also positively associated with GDP \ngrowth  (correlation:  0.21).  Railroad  infrastructure  growth  in  the  PRC  is  broadly  in  line \nwith  the  average  relationship  of  the  world  and  is  faster  than  that  of  India  (Figure  14). \nGiven  that  railroad  stock  in  the  PRC  is  below  that  of  India,  it  is  reasonable  that  the \nincentive for the PRC to catch up in railroad development is stronger than that of India. \n\nFigure 14: Cross-country Scatter Plot of Railroad Growth against GDP Growth, \n2011 \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: World Bank. World Development Indicators.  \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nTo summarize, the cross-country comparison of three types of infrastructure (electricity \ngeneration,  roads,  and  railways)  suggests  no  sign  that  the  PRC  has  overinvested  in \ninfrastructure, despite its active investment in the past 2 decades. \n\n2.  INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nDEVELOPMENT \n\nThe economy of the PRC has achieved high-speed growth for over 3 decades. Besides \nproductivity  growth,  investment  has  been  the  major  driving  engine  of  this  growth  \n(Zhu 2012). The investment/GDP ratio in the PRC increased substantially in the 1990s, \nfrom approximately 35% in the 1980s to above 40% in the 2000s, with the government \nhaving  a  very  high  share  of  investments.  An  important  reason  for  the  high  share  of \npublic  investment,  as  pointed  out  by  Huang  (2008),  is  the  top-down  system  of  the  \nPRC,  in  which  the  government,  not  the  private  sector  or  the  market,  has  the  main \nresponsibility  for  economic  growth.  The  main  purpose  of  infrastructure  investment  by \nthe  government  has  often  been  to  stimulate  short-run  GDP  growth.  In  addition,  GDP \ngrowth  and  investment  have  been  important  indicators  used  for  official  promotion. \nEncouragingly,  the  past  2  decades  have  seen  institutional  changes  that  have  \ngradually  weakened  the  influence  of  state  power  and  strengthened  the  role  of  the \nmarket in infrastructure investment. In this section, we summarize major policy trends \nfor  three  key  infrastructure  sectors  in  the  PRC:  electricity  generation,  transport,  \nand telecommunications. \n\n2.1  Electricity Generation Infrastructure \n\nThe  development  of  electricity  infrastructure  in  the  PRC  over  the  past  6  decades  can \nbe divided into three phases, with market forces playing a progressively more important \nrole.  The  first  phase  is  the  pre-reform  period  before  1978,  when  all  activities  were \nunder  rigid  state  plans.  Business  activities  and  government  functions,  such  as \nformulating  and  enforcing  regulations,  were  both  undertaken  by  one  government \nagency\u2014the  Ministry  of  Electricity  Industry.  The  annual  growth  rate  of  total  installed \ncapacity was 12.6% during this period. \n\nThe second period is between 1978 and 2002, in which the state plan was loosened, \nand  government  functions  and  business  activities  began  to  separate.  Nevertheless, \ncompetition  was  limited  and  the  government  agency  still  played  an  overwhelmingly \ndominant  role.  The  growth  rates  of  the  sector  fluctuated  during  this  period.  During \n1979\u20131984,  the  annual  growth  rate  of  total  installed  capacity  declined  to  4.9%.  From \n1984  to  1997,  the  growth  rate  recovered  to  9.2%.  In  1997,  the  sector  experienced \nsurplus  supply,  and  the  government  decided  not  to  approve  new  investments  in \nelectricity  generation  for  the  next  3  years.  By  2003,  22  provinces  had  experienced  \nsevere shortages of electricity supply and electricity had to be rationed again (Bai and \nQian 2010). \n\nThe third period started in 2002. More players including private investors were allowed \nto  invest  in  electricity  infrastructure,  significantly  increasing  the  number  of  players.  At \nthe  end  of  2007,  there  were  more  than  4,000  generators  with  an  installed  capacity \nabove 6 megawatts (MW). Nevertheless, the state still maintained a dominant position \nin  this  market.  Central  government-controlled  generators  accounted  for  54%  of  the \ninstalled  capacity,  while  those  controlled  by  local  governments  comprised  41%  \n(Bai and Qian 2010). The transmission and distribution sector was mainly controlled by \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\ntwo  state  grid  corporations.  Each  of  them  is  a  monopoly  transmitter,  distributor,  and \nretailer of electricity in its region. Generators sell power to the power grid companies. \n\n2.2  Highways and Railroads \n\nThe dominant role of the state has also been the key feature of highway and railroad \ninvestment  in  the  PRC.  While  investments  in  railways  are  mainly  supported  by  the \ncentral  government,  most  highways  in  the  PRC  are  supported  by  local  governments, \nwhile the central government targets strategically important national highways. \n\nSince  the  economic  reforms  started  in  1978,  the  railways  sector  has  been  gradually \nundergoing  marketization,  but  progress  has  been  slow  relative  to  other  infrastructure \nregulation reforms. From 1949 to 1982, the railways sector featured rigid planning and \nunprofitably low prices, which were uniformly set by the central authority. From 1982 to \n1985, some autonomy on planning, finance, employment, and personnel decisions was \ngiven to the local railway bureaus. At the same time, the railways system could retain \nsome  profit  according  to  an  after  tax  payment  formula.  Railway  service  prices  were \nraised,  but  still  lagged  behind  the  general  price  level.  Compared  with  1955,  the  1986 \nfreight  price  dropped  by  20.8%  relative  to  the  consumer  price  index  and  passenger \nprice by 15.7% (Bai and Qian 2010). \n\nIn  1993, \nthe  railways  system  started  experimenting  with  corporatization.  The \nGuangdong railway bureau was restructured into a corporate group in February 1993. \nThen  the  Dalian  railway  bureau  became  Dalian  Railway  Limited  in  1995.  The \nGuangzhou\u2013Shenzhou  railway  was  publicly  listed  in  Hong  Kong,  China  and  in  New \nYork in 1996. The whole system went through corporatization in 1999 with the objective \nof separating government functions from business activities in the system. In the same \nperiod,  the  price  policy  became  more  flexible.  Prices  were  allowed  to  depend  on  the \nquality, route, and season of the services. \n\nThe  marketization  trend  also  occurred  in  road  investment.  Before  1980,  road \ninvestment funds came from the state budget in the form of a grant that did not carry \nany  financial  cost.  Users  did  not  pay  tolls,  but  they  paid  a  monthly  highway \nmaintenance  fee  based  on  their  vehicle  tonnage.  In  the  next  stage,  state  investment \nfunds  in  local  projects  were  changed  from  grants  to  loans  in  1980,  and  the  cost  of \ninvestment  was  shifted  to  the  local  governments.  New  fees  were  introduced  in  the \nfollowing  years  to  increase  the  amount  of  funds  available  to  local  governments  for \nconstructing  highways.  Among  the  newly  introduced  fees  was  a  vehicle  purchase \nsurcharge, which began in 1985. The surcharge was 10% of the price for domestically \nproduced vehicles and 15% for imported vehicles. This surcharge goes into the State \nHighway Construction Fund. \n\nHighway  tolls  were  first  tried  out  in  Guangdong  province  in  1981.  Gradually,  toll \ncollection became a widespread practice in the whole country. Currently, highway tolls \nare  regulated  by  the  Highway  Law,  which  was  promulgated  in  1997  and  revised  in \n1999 and 2004. Among other aspects, the law regulates the types of highway that are \neligible  for  tolls,  the  number  of  years  in  which  tolls  can  be  collected  on  a  highway,  \nthe toll rates, the transfer of the rights for toll collection, the setting up of toll gates, and \nthe  coordination  between  provinces  when  the  highway  crosses  provincial  borders  \n(see Bai and Qian 2010 for more details on the toll regulation policy). \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\n2.3  Telecommunications Infrastructure \n\nFor a long time, the PRC\u2019s telecommunications sector was viewed as an instrument of \ngovernment control and national defense. The sector remained under tight control and \nwas not opened to foreign investors until the 1990s, when the reform process started. \nThe  State  Council  started  a  round  of  reforms  in  1998  involving  the  separation  of \ngovernment and enterprise functions, the improvement of market competition, and the \nremoval of monopoly power. The country\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in \n2001 has hastened the reform process and stimulated the development and growth of \nthe telecommunications sector. Since 2001, the PRC\u2019s telecommunications system has \nexpanded  significantly  and  the  number  of  subscribers  has  increased  rapidly.  In  2003, \nthe number of mobile phone services subscribers surpassed that of fixed-line services \nsubscribers (Shiu and Lam 2008). \n\n3.  INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING \n\nThe  rapid  growth  in  infrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC  has  been  supported  by  a \nunique financing system, which is not limited to standard fiscal resources, but utilizes a \nnumber  of  non-budgetary  sources  of  revenue.  In  this  section,  we  summarize  the \nstructure and major features of this system. \n\n3.1  Development of Infrastructure Financing System \n\nin the PRC \n\nThe  urban  infrastructure finance  system  of the  PRC  has  undergone  a  series  of major \nchanges. Between 1949 and 1978, municipality authorities collected fiscal revenue and \nremitted  it  to  the  central  government  for  reallocation;  infrastructure  investment  funds \nwere  then  allocated  to  local  governments  in  the  form  of  grants  based  on  the \nexpenditure  needs  of  local  jurisdictions  (Wu  1999).  This  period  was  characterized  \nby  a  lack  of  both  political  and  financial  support  of  urban  infrastructure  development. \nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, investment in urban infrastructure was CNY12 billion in \ntotal,  which  was  1.43%  of  total  fixed  investment  and  0.23%  of  GDP  at  the  national \nlevel.  These  proportions  are  much  lower  than  those  in  other  countries  (Chan  1998; \nHua 1993). \n\nBetween  1978  and  1994,  the  central  government  intensified  its  efforts  to  promote  \nurban  infrastructure  development  through  laws  and  regulations.  The  central\u2013local \ngovernment relationship began to change when fiscal decentralization was introduced \nand  local  governments  began  to  retain  a  higher  rate  of  revenue  and  enjoy  more \nfreedom  in  discretionary  spending.  State  investment  funds  in  local  projects  were \nchanged  from  grants  to  loans  in  1980  and  the  cost  of  investment  was  shifted  to  the \nlocal governments. \n\nThe  Urban  Maintenance  and  Construction  Tax  was \nin  1985  after \napproximately 5 years of trial (Chan 1998). The tax was the only earmarked tax in the \nfiscal system and became an important tool for infrastructure funding. \n\nimposed \n\nLand transfer fees are also a major source of funds for infrastructure investment in the \nPRC.  They  were  introduced  in  1981  in  Shenzhen  foreign  enterprise-funded  projects \nand then expanded to other cities (Chan 1998). Two laws were enforced in 1988 and \n1990  that  provided  the  legal  foundation  for  land  leasing  as  an  infrastructure-funding \ntool  by  the  PRC  municipalities  (China  State  Council  1988;  1990).  In  addition,  the \ncentral government set its share of land leasing revenue at 60% at the beginning and \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nthen  gradually  reduced  it  to  40%,  32%,  and  5%  (Peterson  2006).  By  1994,  all  land \nleasing revenue had been assigned to municipal governments. \n\nIn  the  1980s,  fees  and  user  charges  were  also  introduced,  including  wastewater \ntreatment  charges  and  user  charges  for  toll  bridges  (Chan  1998).  The  State  Council \nintroduced  infrastructure  connection  fees  in  1984.  It  was  started  in  several  cities  and \nbecame  popular  in  the  early  1990s  (Chan  1998).  Infrastructure  connection  fees  were \ncharged  on  new  construction  and  immigrants.  They  were  also  linked  with  the  sale  of \nurban residency rights (known as the Hukou system) (Chan 1998). \n\nAfter the fiscal  decentralization  reforms  of  1994, the  new fiscal  system formalized  the \nsharing  scheme  of  tax  revenue  between  the  local  and  central  governments  (Bird  \nand  Wong  2005).  As  a  result,  local  governments  gained  more  autonomy  in  urban \ninfrastructure finance, strengthening their incentive to collect revenue for infrastructure \ndevelopment (Wu 1999; Wu 2008; Chan 1998). \n\nTo summarize, sources of urban infrastructure financing in the PRC include both pay-\nas-you-go  fiscal  revenue  and  market  financing  approaches  (Table  1).  Pay-as-you-go \nfiscal revenue includes central and local budgetary allocations, the Urban Maintenance \nand  Construction  Tax,  public  utility  surcharges,  water  resource  fees,  infrastructure \nconnection  fees,  user  charges,  land  transfer  fees,  and  assets  exchange  revenue. \nMarket  financing  approaches  include  domestic  loans,  foreign  capital,  bonds,  stock \nfinancing, and self-raised funds. \n\nTable 1: Urban Infrastructure Financing Instruments \n\nNature of Fund \n\nSources of Funds \n\nPay-as-you-go fiscal revenue \nBudgetary allocation \n\nEarmarked grants from the central government for urban maintenance and \nconstruction take the form of fiscal transfers and special funds, including \nirrigation works funds, road funds, and rural construction funds.

Per  capita  funding  increased  from \nCNY33 in 1990 to CNY372 in 2005 (the exchange rate between yuan and dollars was \nabout  8  to  1  during  1990\u20132005  and,  thus,  the  per  capita  funding  increase  was \nequivalent  to  about  US$4  in  1990  and  about  US$45  in  2005)  (Figure  15).  Urban \nmaintenance and construction revenue as a percentage of GDP increased from 1.8% \nin 1999 to 2.9% in 2005. Importantly, the average annual growth rate of fiscal revenue \nfrom1990 to 2005 was 12.8%, which was less than the growth rate of market financing \nat 17.1%.  \n\nFigure 15: Per Capita Urban Infrastructure Revenue Growth by Sources \n\n \n\n \n \n\ne\nr\nu\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\na\nr\nf\nn\n\ni\n \n\n \n\nn\na\nb\nr\nu\na\nt\ni\np\na\nc\n \nr\ne\nP\n\n350 \n\n300 \n\n250 \n\n200 \n\n150 \n\n100 \n\n50 \n\n0 \n\n \n)\nn\no\ns\nr\ne\np\n/\nn\na\nu\ny\n(\n \ns\ne\nu\nn\ne\nv\ne\nr\n\n1990 \n\n1993 \n\n1996 \n\n1999 \n\n2002 \n\n2005 \n\n2007 \n\nFiscal revenues \n\nMarket financing \n\n \n\nSources: Wu (2008); Urban Construction Yearbooks of the PRC (2000\u20132008). \n\nFigure 16 breaks down fiscal revenue by different sources in 2007. The most important \nsource  of  urban  infrastructure  finance  was  the  land  transfer  fee  introduced  in  the \n1980s, accounting for over one-third of fiscal revenue for urban infrastructure financing. \nIts  annual  average  growth  rate  was  54.3%,  much  higher  than  that  of  fiscal  revenue \nfunds for infrastructure investment (Zhao and Cao 2011). Local budgetary allocation as \nwell  as  maintenance  and  construction  taxes  are  also  significant,  accounting  for  33% \nand 14% of fiscal revenue for infrastructure investment, respectively. These three items \ntogether  contribute  84%  of  the  fiscal  revenue  source  of  funds  for  infrastructure \ninvestment.  The  amount  of  central  budgetary  allocation  toward  local  infrastructure  is \nlimited compared to other resources. \n\nWe  now  turn  to  market  financing  channels  for  infrastructure  in  the  PRC  (Figure  17). \nDebt financing includes domestic loans as well as other bonds. Domestic loans include \nbank loans and nationally issued bonds. Given the underdeveloped financial market of \nthe  PRC,  bank  lending  still  plays  a  dominant  role,  accounting  for  over  a  half  of  total \nmarket financing. In terms of growth rates, domestic loans are also the major source of \ngrowth  in  market financing. Their  average  annual  growth  rate from  1990  to  2005  was \n24.0%,  while  the  growth  rate  of  overall  market  financing  was  17.1%  (Zhao  and \nCao 2011). \n\nBecause local governments are not allowed to borrow money directly from commercial \nbanks,  urban  development  and  investment  companies  are  established  to  justify  this \nway  of  financing  urban  infrastructure.  Moreover,  as  infrastructure  investment  projects \nusually  cannot  recover  costs  within  the  maturity  period  of  commercial  bank  loans,  \nlocal  governments  always  roll  over  the  loans  rather  than  repay  them  (Su  and  Zhao \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\n2006). Since the implementation of higher credit standards for commercial banks, local \ngovernments\u2019 political control over commercial banks has weakened and it has become \nharder to obtain loans from these banks (Su and Zhao 2006).  \n\nFigure 16: Pay-as-you-go Fiscal Revenue for Urban Infrastructure  \nFinancing in the PRC, 2007 \n(%) \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSources: Zhao and Cao (2011); Urban Construction Yearbook of the PRC (2008). \n\nFigure 17: Market Financing for Urban Infrastructure in the PRC, 2006 \n\n \n\n \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSources: Wu (2008); Urban Construction Yearbooks of the PRC (2000\u20132008). \n\nIn  1998,  the  Ministry  of Finance  began  to  increase  nationally  issued  bonds  and grant \nloans  to  provincial  governments  for  the  purpose  of  local  economic  and  social \ndevelopment. The local governments are responsible for repaying capital with interest, \nbut the repayment of these loans has typically  been waived in the process of political \nnegotiation with the central government (Su and Zhao 2006). \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nEquity  financing  includes  self-raised  funds,  foreign  capital,  and  stock  financing.  \nSelf-raised  funds  refer  to  those  from  the  accumulated  capital  of  enterprises  and  \npublic  institutions  for  the  purpose  of  expanded  reproduction  (Ministry  of  Housing  \nand  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  of  the  PRC  2001).  The  average  annual  growth  rate  \nof  self-raised  funds  is  14.3%,  which  is  lower  than  the  17.1%  of  market  financing. \nAccording to Wang and Zhang (2009), about two-thirds of self-raised funds come from \nthe direct investment of private enterprises. \n\nForeign investment usually takes the form of public\u2013private partnerships, in which the \nPRC  government  provides  the  land  and  foreign  companies  provide  the  funds  needed \n(Bird  and  Wong  2005;  Bellier  and  Zhou  2003).  Foreign  capital  has  a  relatively  low \nproportion in total infrastructure funding at about 1%\u20132%. \n\nCompared to other market financing approaches, the use of stock financing is minimal. \nIn  most  years,  it  accounted  for  less  than  5%  of  the  overall  urban  maintenance  and \nconstruction revenue. \n\n3.2  Decentralized Infrastructure Financing in the PRC \n\nBefore \u201creforms and opening up,\u201d transport investment in the PRC was mainly centrally \nplanned (Gao 2005).\u2020 After the reforms, the financing of infrastructure gradually shifted \nfrom central financing to local financing, but this centralization process varied widely in \ndifferent types of infrastructure. Investment in railways remains mainly controlled by the \ncentral government, accounting for around 90% of government investment in railways \nin  recent  years.  In  contrast,  road  investment  is  mainly  local,  with  local  fiscal  funds \naccounting  for  around  95%  of  total  government  investment.  This  difference  in  the \ncentral\u2013local financing structure may have a large impact on investment efficiency, as \nlocal  governments  are  less  likely  to  be  concerned  about  the  interregional  spillover \neffect of road infrastructure. Similar to road investment, local investment in waterways \ntransportation  has  been  maintained  at  about  80%\u201390%  of  total  public  investment. \nElectricity  and  heat  generation  are  slightly  more  centrally  controlled,  with  central \ngovernment  financing  accounting  for  35%  and  local  government  financing  accounting \nfor 65% of government investment (Table 2). \n\nTable 2: Transportation, Warehousing, and Postal Actual Fixed Asset Investment \n(hundred million yuan) \n\n \n\n2004 \n\n2012 \n\nRailway transportation \n\nRoad Transportation \n\nWater Transportation \n\nElectricity and Heat Generation \n\nCentral \n752.73 \n(88.9%) \n200.69 \n(4.3%) \n106.58 \n(19.9%) \n1,699 \n(35%) \n\nLocal \n93.57 \n(11.1%) \n4,464.84 \n(95.7%) \n428.05 \n(80.1%) \n3,155 \n(65%) \n\nCentral \n5,045.2 \n(85.3%) \n479.6 \n(3.5%) \n268.4 \n(14%) \n4,311.7 \n(37%) \n\nLocal \n869.7 \n(14.7%) \n13,376.7 \n(96.5%) \n1,653.3 \n(86%) \n7,291.7 \n(62%) \n\nSources: Yearbooks of Transportation and Communications of the PRC (2004; 2012). \n\n                                                \n\u2020   During  the  Great  Leap  Forward,  local  governments  became  the  main  source  of  financing.  See  Gao \n(2005),  for  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  financing  of  the  PRC\u2019s  transportation  infrastructure \ninvestment. \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nIn  the  latest  reforms  of  the  PRC  since  2013,  the  government  proposed  to  encourage \nprivate investment in the infrastructure sector. The State Council published 80 projects \nin  2014  to  invite  private  investment.  On  12  June  2014,  the  investment  director  of  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  confirmed  that  in  the  long  run  the \ngovernment would continue to encourage private investment.\u2021 \n\nIn sum, the infrastructure financing system of the PRC has made progress in allowing \nthe  participation  of  private  funds,  but  local  governments  still  play  the  most  important \nrole  in  allocating  infrastructure  capital.  This  is  helpful  for  rapid  urbanization  as  local \ngovernments  have  a  strong  incentive  to  build  transport  infrastructure  to  facilitate \nurbanization so as to increase fiscal revenue from land sales. However, due to the lack \nof a responsibility system to assess the effectiveness of local governments\u2019 investment, \noverinvestment is likely, resulting in overexpansion of urban areas. \n\n4.  INFRASTRUCTURE\u2013GROWTH\u2013URBANIZATION \n\nRELATIONSHIP \n\nThe  rapid  infrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC  is  closely  tied  to  two  other  important \ntrends\u2014economic growth and urbanization. It is crucial to understand their interrelation \nin order for policy makers, not only in the PRC but also other developing economies, to \nmake efficient infrastructure investment policies. Although empirical evidence available \nis still limited due to a lack of data and empirical research, a number of recent studies \nhave  advanced  understanding  of  this  field.  Below  we  summarize  them  and  discuss \ntheir policy implications. \n\n4.1  Infrastructure Investment and Growth in the PRC \n\nInspired  by  the  unprecedented  scale  of  infrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC,  a  rising \nnumber  of  econometric  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  effect  of  infrastructure \ninvestment on the growth of the PRC. In this section, we summarize the major findings \nof this small but rapidly growing body of research. \n\nthat \n\nshowed \n\nimportant \n\n(2001) \nfacilities  are \n\nAn  important  question  in  this  context  is  whether  infrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC \nhas  helped  to  promote  growth.  This  appears  to  be  the  case  according  to  the  studies \nand \navailable.  D\u00e9murger \ntelecommunications \nthe  growth \nperformance of provinces in the PRC (transport infrastructure is particularly important). \nMore recently, Shi and Huang (2014) improved the estimates to determine the causal \neffect  of  infrastructure  on  economic  growth,  and  their  results  suggest  that  when  the \ngeneral  infrastructure  level  increases  by  1%,  the  GDP  of  a  province  in  the  PRC  can \nincrease  by  around  0.25%.  In  contrast,  Banerjee,  Duflo,  and  Qian  (2012),  who \nexamined the effect of rail transport connections in the PRC after the mid-19th century \nadvent  of  treaty  ports,  did  not  find  any  significant  effect  on  counties  with  rail  as \ncompared with those farther off the grid. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nin  relation \n\ntransport \n\nfactors \n\nto \n\nThese  findings  lead  to  a  question:  How  has  infrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC \naffected economic growth? A number of recent studies have shed light on this question \nby  econometrically  examining  the  mechanisms  through  which  infrastructure  affects \ngrowth. Below we summarize the major findings. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n\u2021   http://www.chinairn.com/news/20140612/113418879.shtml (in Chinese). \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nMechanism 1: Transaction Cost Reduction \n\nFor  infrastructure  investment  to  affect  the  economy,  a  direct  channel  is  to  reduce \ntransaction  costs.  According  to  Li  et  al.  (2012),  who  used  survey  data  on  agricultural \ntraders  in  the  PRC  in  2004,  transport  costs  in  the  PRC  are  nontrivial,  accounting  for \naround 8% of agricultural goods\u2019 trade value. In theory, transportation investment can \nimprove the productivity of the economy by promoting trade patterns and reducing the \nprices of traded goods (Limao and Venables 2001). \n\nEvidence  from  the  PRC  indeed  supports  this  cost-reduction  effect.  In  terms  of  road \ninfrastructure,  Li  et  al.  (2012)  showed  that  road  quality  has  been  crucial  for  reducing \ntransport  costs  within  the  PRC:  by  increasing  transport  speed  by  1  km  per  hour,  the \ntotal  transport  costs  for  agricultural  traders  would  decrease  by  0.6%,  mainly  due  to \nimproved fuel-burning efficiency and reduced labor requirements. \n\nSome  evidence  is  also  available  for  cost  saving  via  railroad  investment.  Li  and  Chen \n(2013) examined the cost saving due to reduced congestion by expanding the transport \ncapacity of a thousand-mile-long railroad that connects Xinjiang and Gansu provinces, \nboth  in  the  northwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  They  find  that,  after  this  investment  in \n1994,  shipping  volume  increased  by  around  40%  and  the  between-destination  price \ndifferences  of  goods  dropped  by  about  30%.  This  implies  a  sizable  social  return  of \napproximately 30% per year for this particular investment. \n\nBesides  saving  transport  costs  for  tradable  goods,  transport  infrastructure  can  also \nsave  costs  through  facilitating  the  specialization  of  production  to  regions  with \ncomparative advantages. He and Duchin (2009) found that each dollar of investment in \nthe interregional transport infrastructure of the PRC can generate as much as US$3.90 \nof  total  benefits  through  the  cost  saving  of  the  specialization  effect.  Note  that,  unlike \nprevious  studies,  the  findings  of  He  and  Duchin  (2009)  are  derived  from  the \noptimization of a multi-region trade model based on linear programming for 1997\u20132020 \nand not econometric analysis of the actual impact of transport infrastructure. \n\nTransport  infrastructure  can  also  reduce  the  commuting  costs  of  passengers,  thus \nimproving  the  efficiency  of  spatial  distribution  in  economic  activities.  Zheng  and  Kahn \n(2013)  showed  that  the  high-speed  rail  infrastructure  has  integrated  housing  markets \nbetween the city core and the surrounding second- and third-tier cities by reducing time \ncosts for passengers. A key consequence and evidence of this cost saving is the rise of \nhousing  prices  in  the  peripheral  areas.  Hence,  investment  in  high-speed  trains  has \nplayed an important role in integrating the PRC\u2019s cities into a system of open cities. \n\nIn  sum,  econometric  evidence  available  suggests \ninfrastructure \ninvestment in the PRC has contributed to the productivity of the economy by reducing \ntransport  costs  for  goods  and  passengers,  as  well  as  further  spatial  specialization  of \nindustries.  The  evidence  available  is  far  from  comprehensive  and  representative  as  it \nlargely  focuses  on  transport  infrastructure.  Further  research  is  needed  to  assess  the \ntotal  costs  saved  for  the  PRC  by  different  types  of  infrastructure,  as  well  as  its \neconomic impact.  \n\ntransport \n\nthat \n\nMechanism 2: Spatial Redistribution of Economic Activities \n\nGiven  the  trade  costs  reduction,  as  suggested  by  the  studies  reviewed  above,  there \nshould  be  a  redistribution  effect  according  to  the  theory  of  Krugman  (1980).  Existing \nevidence  suggests  that  urban  agglomeration  of  the  PRC  is  insufficient  due  to \ninstitutional constraints, such as local protectionism. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nAlthough the available evidence is limited, it is generally in favor of the hypothesis that \nmarket integration can reinforce the concentration of economic activity, thus increasing \nthe productivity of the economy. Specifically, the National Trunk Highway System of the \nPRC  has  driven  industrial  production  activities  to  move  from  peripheral  counties  to \nmetropolitan  areas.  As  a  result,  the  industrial  output  of  metropolitan  areas  connected \nby the system has increased by around 30% (Faber 2009). The reduction of transport \ncosts,  as  well  as  the  agglomeration  effect,  has  helped  to  lower  product  prices  by \naround  1%  nationwide,  thus  increasing  aggregate  welfare.  This  price  effect  is  more \nsignificant in peripheral areas. \n\nWhat  if  the  road  does  not  directly  pass  by  a  jurisdiction?  The  empirical  evidence \navailable does not provide a clear answer. Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian (2012) estimated \nthat the effect of distance to transportation networks on local economic outcomes in the \nPRC has been positive, but the magnitude of the effect has been modest. The elasticity \nof  per  capita  GDP  with  respect  to  distance  from  historical  transportation  networks  is \napproximately \u20130.07. Moreover, the authors find no effect of proximity to roads on per \ncapita GDP growth.  \n\nAn  important  aspect  of  this  spillover  effect  is  that  between  countries,  as  shown  by \nConley  and  Ligon  (2002).  Within  the  context  of  the  PRC,  although  Shi  and  Huang \n(2014) found little spillover effect of infrastructure investment, Li and Li (2013) showed \na significant spillover effect of road investment on firms in neighboring provinces, which \ncontributed to around two-thirds of the total inventory decline. These spillover benefits \nare  likely  to  be  even  larger  if  the  PRC  can  further  remove  its  domestic  trade  barriers \ncaused by local protectionism. \n\nMechanism 3: Productivity Growth \n\nThe  aforementioned  evidence  on  the  distributional  effect  of  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment implies productivity gain through the agglomeration effect. In addition to this \nredistribution effect, transport infrastructure improvement may also be able to raise the \nproductivity of firms. Li and Li (2013) provide an example of this by examining the effect \nof road investment on the inventory holding of manufacturing firms. In particular, US$1 \nof road investment in the PRC was able to decrease input inventory by around 2 cents \neach  year  during  1998\u20132007.  The  implied  inventory  saving  is  around  one-third  of  the \nestimate for the United States in the 1970s and is well below the capital costs. These \nestimates suggest that road investments in the PRC have improved the productivity of \nfirms \nefficiency  \nwas  relatively  low.  The  results  also  indicate  that  state-owned  enterprises  responded \nlittle  to  road  improvement,  while  private  entrepreneurs  benefited  much  more.  This \nimplies  that  in  order to  improve  benefits from road  investments,  the  PRC government \nmay want to further push the market reforms and allocate more resources to the private \nsector instead of building more roads. This would allow the thriving private enterprises \nto  realize  more  benefits  from  infrastructure  investments  and  contribute  to  economic \ngrowth. \n\ninvestment \n\ninventory \n\nalthough \n\nthrough \n\nsaving, \n\nthe \n\nLi et al. (2014) provide a more comprehensive estimate of the effect of road investment \non  the  productivity  of  firms  in  the  PRC.  They  found  that  road  investment  in  the  PRC \nhas  significantly  raised  the  productivity  of  firms.  The  elasticity  of  physical  productivity \nwith respect to road investment was around 0.1 in the PRC, and the implied aggregate \nrate  of  returns  averaged  80%.  Although  these  estimates  suggest  a  significant \nproductivity gain due to the road investment, they are both less than the estimates for \nthe  United  States.  This  is  consistent  with  the  findings  in  Li  and  Li  (2013),  suggesting \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nthat road  investment  in  the  PRC  may  have  been  less  efficient than that  in  the  United \nStates.\u00a7 \n\nBy region, the productivity gain of road investment appears larger in the inland regions \nof  the  PRC  than  in  coastal  regions  (Li  et  al.  2014),  suggesting  underinvestment  in \nroads  in  the  inland.  This  is  contrary  to  the  common  criticism  that  roads  have  been \noversupplied  in  the  inland  areas.  In  contrast,  Shi  and  Huang  (2014)  found  that  most \nprovinces  in  the  PRC  exhibited  a  shortage  of  infrastructure  before  2008.  After  2008, \nmost of the western provinces already exhibited an oversupply of infrastructure relative \nto  private  capital,  whereas  some  eastern  and  central  provinces  still  showed  a  clear \nshortage  of  infrastructure.  The  seemingly  contradicting  findings  of  these  two  studies \nare due to the former study\u2019s focus on roads, while the latter study examines general \ninfrastructure.  For  some \ntelecommunications,  evidence \nsuggests that it helps to improve GDP growth in the eastern PRC, but not in the inland \nregion (Shiu and Lam 2008). \n\ninfrastructure,  such  as \n\nImportantly, both Li et al. (2014) and Li and Li (2013) also found that the social returns \nto road infrastructure investment have been declining rapidly over time. Hence, future \nroad  investment  in  the  PRC  needs  more  scientific  planning  in  order  to  achieve  an \noptimal investment scale. \n\n4.2  Infrastructure Investment and Urbanization \n\nThe  evidence  of  transport  infrastructure  investment  on  the  centralization  of  economic \nactivities,  as  discussed  above,  suggests  that  transport  infrastructure  has  facilitated \nurbanization in the PRC. In this section, we provide further evidence of the relationship \nbetween general infrastructure investment and urbanization. Evidence available on this \ntopic  is  scarce.  An  exception  is  D\u00e9murger  (2001)  who  showed  that  infrastructure \ninvestments  that  are  urban-biased  have  led  urbanized  provinces  to  grow  at  a  higher \nrate than rural provinces. A causal relationship, however, is unclear from this study. To \nshed further light on the inter-relationship between urbanization and infrastructure, we \nprovide additional evidence by analyzing city-level data for the PRC. \n\nIn  theory,  infrastructure  investment  can  facilitate  urbanization  by  increasing  the \nattractiveness  and  capacity  of  urban  areas.  On  the  other  hand,  urbanization  can  also \nincrease the demand for infrastructure investment. Below we provide a simple analysis \nof  the  relationship  between  infrastructure  investment  and  urbanization  in  the  PRC.  In \nparticular, we propose two alternative hypotheses. \n\nHypothesis 1: Infrastructure investment drives urbanization in the PRC, with decreasing \nmarginal effect. \n\nAccording  to  Hulten  (1994),  building  one  network  may  have  a  high  rate  of  return,  but \nbuilding  a  second  network  may  have  a  lower  marginal  return.  This  implies  that  the \nmarginal  effect  of  infrastructure  investment  is  likely  to  decrease,  that  is,  there  is  an \ninverse-U effect of infrastructure investment on urbanization. \n\nHypothesis  2:  Urbanization  drives  infrastructure  investment  through  a  demand-side \neffect, with decreasing marginal return. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n\u00a7   Vijverberg  et  al.  (2011)  also  examined  industrial  enterprises,  using  province-level  data  from  1993  to \n2003, but found the rate of returns to be 23%\u201325%. One possibility of this relative small rate of returns \nis the endogeneity in the infrastructure variable, such as measurement errors, which bias the estimates \nnegatively. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nWe  also  expect  the  effect  of  urbanization  on  infrastructure  investment  to  have \ndecreasing  marginal  return  (an  inverse-U  shape  pattern)  because  an  infrastructure \nnetwork requires large initial capital, but incremental investment should be less costly. \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  if  we  examine  the  reduced  form  relationship  between \ninfrastructure  investment  and  urbanization,  only  one  of  the  above  two  hypotheses  \ncan  hold,  depending  on  which  hypothesis  is  stronger  in  reality.  This  is  because  the \ninverse-U  shape  relationship  suggested  by  the  two  hypotheses  cannot  hold  at  the \nsame time.  \n\nWe  plot  the  ratio  of  infrastructure  investment  over  GDP  against  the  urbanization  rate  \nat the province level in 2007 to provide an overview of the data (Figure 18). The pattern \nappears  to  favor  the  second  hypothesis,  showing  that  the  ratio  of  infrastructure \ninvestment  over  GDP  first  increases  in  urbanization,  but  then  declines.  In  contrast, \nwhen  the  infrastructure  ratio  rises,  we  do  not  observe  a  systematic  pattern  of \nurbanization. This data pattern generally holds for other years before 2007. \n\nFigure 18: Infrastructure Investment/GDP Ratio versus Urbanization Rate, 2007 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\nInterestingly,  after  2008,  the  year  of  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  inverse-U \nrelationship between urbanization and infrastructure disappeared (Figure 19). This may \nsuggest  that  after  the  financial  crisis,  the  government  of  the  PRC  used  large-scale \nfiscal  stimulus  to  support  the  economy,  providing  easy  credit  nationwide  for \ninfrastructure investment. Hence, after 2008, infrastructure investment across the PRC \nbecame supply-driven, rather than demand-driven. This effect outweighed the strength \nof the mechanism suggested by hypothesis 2. \n\nMore  rigorous  regression  estimates  using  fixed-effect  panel  data  regressions  (robust \nstandard  errors  clustered  at  the  city  level)  support  the  graphical  patterns  presented \nabove (see Appendix). The estimates suggest that before 2007, when the urbanization \nrate  of  a  PRC  province  was  lower  than  0.47,  rising  urbanization  was  accompanied  \nby  rising  infrastructure  investment  intensity  in  GDP.  After  the  urbanization  rate \nsurpassed  0.47,  infrastructure  investment  intensity  started  declining  due  to  the \ndecreasing demand. \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nFigure 19: Infrastructure Investment/GDP Ratio versus Urbanization Rate, 2009 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\n5.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nRecommendation 1: Infrastructure investment and urbanization are mutually \nbeneficial and jointly promote economic growth. \n\nExisting  evidence  suggests  the  following  inter-relationships  between  infrastructure \ninvestment,  urbanization,  and  growth  in  the  PRC,  which  can  be  used  for  designing \nregional  development  policies.  First, urbanization  generates  demand for  infrastructure \ninvestment.  Although  this  mechanism  has  weakened  in  cities  with  high  urbanization \nrates,  such  as  Shanghai,  the  demand  for  infrastructure  in  most  cities  is  still  \nstrong  as  they  are  still  undergoing  urbanization.  Second,  empirical  evidence  also \nsuggests  that  infrastructure  investment  can  facilitate  urbanization  by  increasing \neconomic  agglomeration.  Third,  there  is  strong  evidence  in  the  literature  that \ninfrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC  has  promoted  economic  growth  through  various \nmechanisms:  market  integration,  agglomeration,  and  productivity  growth.  These  links \ntogether  suggest  that  urbanization  and  infrastructure  investment  can  jointly  promote \neconomic growth. \n\nRecommendation 2: Policy makers should encourage research on the marginal \nsocial returns to infrastructure investment to achieve efficient infrastructure \ninvestment.  \n\nDue  to  the  limited  research  available,  evidence  is  lacking  on  the  returns  to \ninfrastructure  investment  in  the  PRC  and  a  consensus  has  not  yet  been  reached. \nNevertheless, existing evidence (Li and Chen 2013; Li and Li 2013; Li et al. 2014; Shi \nand Huang 2014) suggests that the social returns to transport infrastructure investment \nhave  been  high  in  the  past  decades,  but  have  been  declining  rapidly.  Hence,  in  the \ncase  of  road  infrastructure,  future  investment  needs  to  be  carefully  studied  so  as  to \navoid  overinvestment.  Empirical  evidence  on the  social  returns to  other  infrastructure, \nincluding  railroads,  urban  infrastructure,  electronic  grids,  and  telecommunication \nnetworks  is  lacking.  As  these  infrastructure  investments  may  have  large  externalities \nand the prices are regulated, their private returns do not provide sufficient information \non  the  returns  to  their  marginal  investment.  Further  studies  are  needed  to  answer  \nthis question. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nRecommendation 3: The market or the government alone is not sufficient to \nprovide optimal infrastructure investment, and a public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP) mechanism is needed. \n\nExisting studies have a number of important implications for infrastructure financing in \nthe  PRC.  First,  infrastructure  investment  is  currently  monopolized  by  governments, \nespecially local governments. Compared with other economies, participation of private \ninvestment on infrastructure investment is limited. According to Li et al. (2014), this lack \nof private financing may be a key reason for the low productivity of road infrastructure \ninvestment, especially in the coastal regions of the PRC. Hence, reducing the barriers \nto  private  investment  in  the  infrastructure  sector  can  help  to  increase  the  efficiency  \nof investment. \n\nSecond,  infrastructure  may  have  strong  spillover  benefits  across  provinces.  For \nexample,  Li  and  Li  (2013)  found  that  road  investment  in  a  province  of  the  PRC  can \naffect  the  productivity  of  manufacturing  firms  in  other  provinces  by  reducing  their \ninventory  levels.  Road  investment,  however,  is  mainly  financed  by  local  governments \n(Table 2). Hence, local governments may have little incentive to take other provinces\u2019 \nbenefits  into  account  when  they  decide  on  road  investment.  This  issue  cannot  be \naddressed  by  allowing  private  investments.  One  possible  solution  is  to  increase  the \nshare of the central government in infrastructure financing. Alternatively, taxes may be \nlevied  on firms  in  other provinces  that  benefit from  road  investment  in  local  provinces \n(such  as  establishing  toll  stations  between  the  borders  of  provinces).  Although  the \nevidence  available  is  only  for  roads,  it  is  likely  that  a  similar  situation  may  occur  for \nother types of infrastructure. More studies are also needed in this direction. \n\nRecommendation 4: When investment incentive is distorted, infrastructure \ninvestment will be biased by local institutional quality and financing ability, and \ncorrection is needed. \n\nThere  has  been  much  discussion  on  whether  infrastructure  is  oversupplied  or \nundersupplied  in  the  inland  regions  of  the  PRC,  but  evidence  available  is  limited.  Shi \nand Huang (2014) found that before 2008, infrastructure was generally undersupplied \nacross the PRC. However, after 2008, most of the western provinces already exhibited \nan  oversupply  of  infrastructure  relative  to  private  capital,  whereas  some  eastern  \nand  central  provinces  still  showed  a  shortage  of  infrastructure.  It  is  important  to  note \nthat  this  unbalanced  investment  across  the  PRC  may  vary  across  different  types  \nof  infrastructure.  For  some  infrastructure,  such  as  telecommunications,  evidence \nsuggests  that  it  does  help  to  improve  GDP  growth  in  the  provinces  in  the  affluent \neastern region, but not in the low-income central and western provinces (Shiu and Lam \n2008).  However,  in  terms  of  road  investment,  Li  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  road \ninfrastructure  in  the  inland  regions  was  still  severely  undersupplied,  while  that  in  the \ncoastal  region  had  already  been  oversupplied  by  2007.  These  findings  suggest  that \nthere may not be a uniform policy to improve the infrastructure investment efficiency in \nthe  PRC.  Instead,  different  policies  need  to  be  designed  for  different  types  of \ninfrastructure. \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\n REFERENCES** \nBai, C., and Y.

Hence,  by \nestimating models (A.1) and (A.2), we can shed light on which of the two hypotheses \nmay hold in the PRC in reality. \n\nData on urbanization, infrastructure investment, and GDP at the city level are obtained \nfrom the City Statistics Yearbook for corresponding years.\u2020\u2020 \n\nTo  provide  a  more  rigorous  analysis,  we  conduct  fixed-effect  panel  data  regressions  \nof  models  (A.1)  and  (A.2),  with  results  summarized  in  Tables  A.1  and  A.2.  Robust \nstandard  errors  clustered  at  the  city  level  are  reported  to  test  the  significance  of  \nour estimates.  \n\nWe  find  that  hypothesis  1  is  not  supported  by  data.  In  contrast,  hypothesis  2  is \nsupported  by  data  before  the  2008\u20132009  global  financial  crisis,  but  not  afterwards. \nSpecifically, the effect of infrastructure investment on urbanization is highly insignificant \nthroughout the sample period (Table A.1).  \n\n                                                \n\u2020\u2020  As data on infrastructure investment is not available at the city level, we provide a proxy by subtracting \nreal  estate  investment  from  total  fixed-asset  investment  at  the  city  level.  Hence,  our  measure  of \ninfrastructure  investment  also  contains  fixed-asset  investment  by  firms.  Nevertheless,  we  believe  the \neffect  of  this  may  be  limited,  as  manufacturing  fixed  investment  should  not  have  an  inverse-U \nrelationship with urbanization. \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 632 \n \n\nLi \n\nIn  contrast,  before  2007,  the  effects  of  both  urbanization  rate  and  its  quadratic  term  \non  infrastructure  investment  are  significant  (Table  A.2).

In  other  words,  when  the  urbanization  rate  \nof  a  PRC  city  is  lower  than  0.47,  rising  urbanization  is  accompanied  by  rising \ninfrastructure investment intensity in GDP. After the urbanization rate surpasses 0.47, \nthe infrastructure investment intensity starts to decline due to the decreasing demand. \n\nTable A.1: Effect of Infrastructure Investment/GDP Ratio on Urbanization Rate \n\nNote: City- and year-specific fixed effects are controlled.

In  one  mechanism,  urbanization  generates  demand  for  infrastructure  investment, \nwhich then drives economic growth via various channels including reducing transaction costs \nand raising productivity. Another mechanism emphasized in this paper is that infrastructure \ninvestment  can  promote  urbanization  through  facilitating  economic  agglomeration  toward \nhub cities. This agglomeration process also raises productivity in the economy. The lessons \nfrom the PRC have implications for infrastructure financing. On the one hand, recent reforms \nhave  allowed  the  market  to  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  funding  infrastructure \ninvestment, helping improve the efficiency of infrastructure investment and the productivity of \nthe economy. On the other hand, evidence in the PRC suggests a cross-province spillover \neffect  of  road  infrastructure,  supporting  the  central  government\u2019s  role  in  infrastructure \nfinancing.  Although  the  current  infrastructure  investment  system  is  still  distorted  by  local \ngovernments\u2019  incentives  and  decisions,  there  is  no  evidence  of  over-investment  in \ninfrastructure at the aggregate level. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that the marginal \nreturn to infrastructure investment in the PRC has been rapidly declining. Hence, it is urgent \nfor  policy  makers  to  reform  the  existing  system  to  base  their  investment  decisions  on  the \neconomic returns to infrastructure. \n \nThe  interregional flow  of  goods  and  production factors  (labor  and capital)  is  a fundamental \nforce  that  drives  urbanization,  but  the  market  may  not  be  efficient  in  financing  and \ninfrastructure  construction.  This  paper  analyzes  infrastructure-related  institutions  and  the \ninterrelation between infrastructure and urbanization. It addresses the following issues: What \nis  the  relationship  between  infrastructure,  growth,  and  urbanization?  How  efficient  have \ninvestment  and  financing  been  for  infrastructure  construction?  How  can  we  evaluate  the \nperformance of infrastructure development? How and to what extent should the government \nbe involved in infrastructure construction? \n \nJEL Classification: H54, O18, R42 \n \n", " \n"]}
