The tsunami of December 26 2004 left Sri Lanka with over 30,000 people dead, \nseveral hundred thousand displaced, and massive damage to infrastructure and \ncapital  assets  (estimated  at  around  US$  1  billion  (4.5  per  cent  of  GDP)) \nparticularly in tourism and fisheries sectors. The medium-term financing needs \nwere estimated to be around US$ 1.5-1.6 billion (7.5 per cent of GDP). It is \nexpected to reduce 2005 GDP by around 0.5 - 1.0%.  \n2.  With no previous history of such disasters Sri Lanka was quite unprepared for the \ntsunami.  But with a massive community response followed by government and \ninternational action, it was able to implement an initial relief effort that, in the \ncircumstances can be termed a success \n3.  Promised external assistance - a total of US$ 2.2 billion over the next 2-3 years - \nappeared to be more than adequate to cover reconstruction costs in full. But \nproblems  have  emerged  with  relief  payments,  providing  credit  facilities, \ndistribution  of  funds,  coordination  of  reconstruction  activities,  and \nmismanagement of funds. Clearly the reconstruction phase poses complex and \ndifficult challenges. \n4.  Housing is the households\u2019 main concern. Reconstruction and repairs have been \nhampered by the \u2018no-build\u2019 coastal buffer zone, cuts to relief payments and cost \nincreases. Progress has been slow, uneven, and concentrated in the south and \nsoutheast, though the worst affected areas are in the east and northeast.  \n5.  Reconstruction spending produces a particular type of Dutch Disease\u2019 reflected in \nconstruction cost increases which have escalated rapidly (by 40-60% in some \ninstances). Overall inflation, caused primarily by policy and exogenous factors, is \nrising,  and  may  accelerate  with  election  cycle  spending,  high  oil  prices  and \nrecently promised increases in government expenditures. This implies a major \nincrease in funds required to fully meet construction targets in the private housing \nsector  and  in  public  infrastructure,  implying  a  major  funding  gap.  The \ngovernment  has  limited  options  to  address  the  funding  short  fall.    Poorer \nhouseholds and public infrastructure reconstruction will be severely affected. \n6.  The report raise issues in the following areas and presents several related policy \nrecommendations: livelihood related cash payments to households; assistance for \nrebuilding houses; titles to new houses; buffer zone rules; early warning and \ndisaster  management  systems;  coordination  of  donor  assisted  activities  and \nmacroeconomic policy issues. \n7.  A Rs 5,000 ($50) monthly grant \u2013 a modest sum that falls short of poverty line \nincomes for a household \u2013 was expected to be provided for about six months to all \naffected households. But this has been scaled back to four months, its scope \nreduced by tightening eligibility rules.  This is inequitable and counterproductive. \nThe grant should be paid to all affected households for six months using donor \nfunds earmarked for livelihood assistance.  ", "  3\n8.  The cash grants for house rebuilding and repairs are manifestly inadequate given \ncost escalations. We recommend an upward revision of the grant, at least for the \npoorer households, using designated donor funds. \n9.  Eligibility for new houses should be determined on clear criteria in a transparent \nmanner. Freehold title should be granted jointly to the husband and wife unless it \nis a single parent family, changing existing legislation as necessary. Any time \nrestrictions on sales to non-family members should be limited to minimise market \ninefficiencies and illegal transactions. \n10. A buffer zone to achieve coastal environmental protection and minimize impact \nof future natural hazards in future has intrinsic merit, and the basic concept should \nbe retained. However, limits should be set through a transparent and consultative \nprocess,  clarifying  the  underlying  scientific  and  economic  rationale  for  zone \nlimits, and regulations must be combined with incentive-based systems drawing \non international experience. \n11. The tsunami experience, the recent Pakistan-Indian earthquake, climate change, \nand scientific opinions highlight the need for greater preparedness to cope with \nnatural disasters. Building on the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act (presented \nto Parliament in February, 2005), a scientifically sound and financially feasible \ndisaster management system geared to coping with the multiple hazards must be \nformulated. Sri Lanka cannot afford a multiplicity of specialised warning systems \nbased on low probability events. Options to meet financing issues arising from \ncatastrophic risks, including purchase of insurance and setting aside reserves to \nmeet unexpected disasters should be explored. \n12. Poor coordination among domestic and external agencies have emerged as serious \nproblems, together with the sensitive issue of balancing political considerations \nand humanitarian assistance to the needy. Some international NGOs\u2019 reluctance to \ncooperate with government institutions, and competitive behaviour towards other \nagencies have hampered coordination and implementation. The modalities of aid \nspending, including procedures and mechanisms should be reviewed to improve \nquick and effective responses. . \n13. Problems  with  aid  utilisation  and  accountability  highlighted  by  the  Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department must be urgently addressed. But, despite these weaknesses \nand  inefficiencies,  the  strengths  and  positive  contributions  of  government \ninstitutions must also be recognised.. Attempts to bypass government institutions \nby  relying  primarily  on  NGOS  can  be  counterproductive,  complicating \ncoordination of reconstruction efforts. A balanced approach must be adopted to \nimprove coordination among donor, government and community groups.  \n14. Overall macroeconomic management circumstances and policies are critical to the \nsuccess of reconstruction. The tsunami hit at a time of serious macroeconomic \nimbalances, and paradoxically helped to mask them for a time. But they are re-\nemerging  now,  fuelling  inflation,  lowering  the  real  value  of  aid  funds, \nconstraining government\u2019s fiscal capacity, and adversely affecting reconstruction. \nPressure on the currency generates temptations to prop up the currency using \ntsunami aid related foreign reserves by delaying reconstruction activities.  This \nwould achieve short-term stability at the expense of reconstruction, growth and \nequity,  while  aggravating  macro  imbalances  in  the  longer  term.  Wider ", "  4\nmacroeconomic imbalances should be addressed directly targeting their sources; \ntsunami aid funds should be utilised for reconstruction purposes.  ", "  5\n1. Introduction \n \nOn 26 December 2004 Sri Lanka was hit by the tsunami caused by a massive off shore \nearthquake some 1500 km away near northern Sumatra. The earthquake, measuring 9.0 \non the Richter scale, was one of the largest ever recorded in the sea, and was produced by \nmovements in tectonic plates at the interface between the India and Burma plates.1 Over \n1000 km of the earth\u2019s crust snapped, moving the Burma plate approximately 13 metres \nover the under-thrusting Indian plate. The thrusting rapidly raised the sea floor, and the \n1500 km of open and deep ocean in the bay of Bengal enabled the ocean waves to build \nup momentum, forming a massive wall of high water on the coastlines as the sea bottom \nshallowed.  \n \nThe earthquake occurred on 26th December at 6.58 am Sri Lanka time. The first large \nwave hit the east coast at 8.35 am. Soon after waves several meters high battered many \nother parts of the coast. Within a very short time over 30,000 people were dead, and \nseveral hundred thousand had been displaced. In addition massive damage had been \ninflicted on thousands of houses and other buildings, railways, bridges, communication \nnetworks and other infrastructure and capital assets.  \n \nSri Lanka was completely unprepared for the tsunami. It experiences periodic droughts, \nfloods, landslides and the occasional cyclone. But the nation had never experienced a \ntsunami, or indeed any other type of natural disaster of this scale and magnitude in \nrecorded history. Even the tsunami generated by the Krakatoa eruption of 1883 had lost \nmuch of its power by the time it reached Sri Lanka, and it only had a barely discernible \nimpact on the east coast with no recorded casualties. While minor earth tremors are not \nuncommon, no serious earthquake has occurred for three centuries.2 Sri Lanka had no \neffective  domestic  hazard  warning  system,  and  had  not  felt  the  need  to  be  part  of \ninternational early warning systems, such as the Tsunami Warning System (TWS) in the \nPacific (with 26 member countries).  \n \nThe death and devastation that accompanied the tsunami were a huge shock to the \ncountry. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, Sri Lankans responded not only with \nshock, grief and horror but also with a massive outpouring of courage and humanity that \ntranscend barriers of race and creed.  In the days that followed, with support also arriving \nfrom international organisations, they were able to successfully ensure that survivors \nwere  fed,  clothed  and  sheltered,  the  injured  provided  with  medical  attention,  and \n                                                 \n1 \u201cShallow undersea earthquakes are responsible for most tsunamis though at times landslides triggered by \nsmaller seismic events can also generate potentially lethal waves. Strong earthquakes cause a displacement \nof the crust. When they occur underwater, this crustal movement disturbs a large volume of water like a \ngiant paddle and ripples spread out in all directions at speeds of 600-800 kilometres per hour, comparable \nto commercial aircraft. In the open ocean, they go unnoticed but once they reach shallower waters they \nslow down and begin to crest. The resulting waves are known as \"tsunamis\".  They are scientifically \ndescribed as a series of very long wavelength ocean waves caused by the sudden displacement of water by \nearthquakes, landslides, or submarine slumps and are mostly caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or \ngreater.\u201d (http://asc-india.org/menu/waves.htm) \n2 Historical records indicate that a major earthquake in 1615 had inflicted serious damage with large \nnumbers of casualties (http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/portu/earthquake.htm ) ", "  6\nthousands of bodies were cremated or buried. Despite the understandable confusion and \neven chaos that accompanied this effort at times, there can be little doubt that Sri Lanka \ncan be proud of how it responded to the immediate challenges of the tsunami impact. \n \nThe widespread devastation caused by the tsunami in Sri Lanka as well as other parts of \nAsia caught the world\u2019s attention and generated a wave of sympathy and support. It was \nperhaps fortuitous that many of the coastal areas were well known tourist destinations. \nGlobal media attention was perhaps intensified by the fact that many western tourists \nwere caught up in the tragedy, and the international media coverage was unprecedented \nfor a natural disaster that primarily affected a group of developing countries. The level of \ngovernmental and non-governmental assistance \u2013 both immediate and promises for the \nfuture \u2013 was unprecedented. For Sri Lanka, as for other affected countries that have been \nready to accept external assistance, the promised external assistance has appeared to be \nmore than adequate to cover the full costs of both immediate relief and reconstruction, \nand produced, for a while, an almost euphoric national mood. However, as the months go \nby, it is becoming clear that moving from the immediate relief effort to addressing the \nmassive reconstruction tasks poses a different and, in many ways more complex, set of \nchallenges.  \n \nThe trauma, grief and suffering associated with deaths of family members, relatives and \nfriends, destruction of houses, displacement,  loss  of  livelihoods,  savings  and  valued \nbelongings are unquantifiable. The task of rebuilding shattered lives is a difficult and \narduous task that requires both material and non-material assistance requiring a multi-\nfaceted  and  multi-pronged  strategy.  The  focus  here,  however,  is  primarily  on  the \neconomic  issues  related  to  post-tsunami  reconstruction  and  recovery,  reflecting \nconstraints imposed by time, resources and our disciplinary expertise. This report is based \non a series of studies conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, in \ncollaboration with the Asian Economics Centre at the University of Melbourne, with \ngenerous financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI). We \nhope that it will contribute to the discussions and debates on appropriate policies for the \nmedium term reconstruction effort by providing an analysis of some of the priority issues \nfrom a Sri Lankan perspective.3  \n \n2. Background \n \nThe tsunami struck at a time when the Sri Lankan macro economy was already under \npressure on several fronts, reigniting fears of a slide into the kind of crisis that was seen \nin 2001 when the economy contracted by 1.5 per cent (Table 1). Some of the same \nproblems that produced the 2001 crisis were re-emerging.  \n \nThe 2001 crisis was driven primarily by a rapidly deteriorating domestic policy and \npolitical  environment  in  the  context  of  accumulated  macroeconomic  imbalances, \n                                                 \n3 Athukorala and Resosudarmo (2005) present an early discussion of some of policy issues related to \ntsunami reconstruction in Indonesia and Sri Lanka.   \n ", "  7\naggravated by lower exports due to depressed global economic conditions and lower \nagricultural output due to adverse weather. The situation was turned around then by a \nseries of political and economic policy initiatives. The initiation of a ceasefire agreement \n(CFA) with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) was seen as a first step towards \nsolving the country\u2019s long standing ethnic conflict. The prospect of a lasting peace and a \nsubstantive set of economic reforms \u2013 including the floating of the currency \u2013 succeeded \nto  some  extent  in  garnering  donor  support  and  renewing  investor  confidence.  GDP \ngrowth resumed at an annual rate of 6 % in 2003, fiscal consolidation efforts saw the \nbudget  deficit  reduced  progressively  to  8  %  from  10.8  %  in  2001  while  inflation \nmoderated to 6.3 per cent from 14.2 per cent in 2003. There was considerable unease \nwithin the business and investor community about the direction of policy under the new \ngovernment elected in April 2004. Its programme, with the stated goal of \u2018growth with \nequity\u2019, and a strong emphasis on rural economic development, was viewed as being \npopulist and interventionist.  \n \nEconomic growth began to slow from the second quarter of 2004 and ended the year with \na growth rate of 5.4 per cent. Whilst the election related uncertainties and the ensuing \npolicy vacuum no doubt contributed to the slowdown in economic activity, some policy \nweaknesses and the slow pace of reforms contributed to the lacklustre performance. The \nmost  visible,  and  potentially  the  most  destabilizing  manifestation  of  weakening \nmacroeconomic management in 2004 was a persistent build up of inflationary pressure \nfrom mid-year onwards. Inflationary pressure was fuelled on multiple fronts, not least by \nthe conduct of government fiscal policy. A budget deficit of 8.2 per cent of GDP in 2004 \nfar exceeded the set target; current expenditures (with 85 per cent taken up in equal \nproportions by payments on wages and salaries, interest payments, and transfers and \nsubsidies) saw a sharp increase as a direct result of policy intervention. Transfers and \nsubsidies increased from 4 per cent of GDP in 2003 to 5.2 per cent 2004 as subsidy costs \nrose. Though the fiscal deficit was reined in by cutting back on capital expenditure, the \nlarge government borrowing required to finance the deficit kept credit growth high, and \ncredit to the government grew at 20 per cent in 2004.  \n \nA ballooning oil import bill saw the current account deficit on the balance of payments \n(BOP) widening to over 3.3 % of GDP from 0.4 % in 2003. This was accompanied by a \ndeceleration of capital inflows, with long-term inflows to the government (consisting \nprimarily of foreign concessional loans) declining by US$ 130 million in 2004. Foreign \nborrowings by the commercial banking sector increased significantly in 2004 raising the \ncountry\u2019s foreign private debt exposure. The currency depreciated by 8.5 per cent against \nthe US dollar despite efforts to bolster the exchange rate which contributed to the decline \nin Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves from US$ 2.3 billion at the beginning of 2004 to \nUS$ 1.9 billion by November.  \n ", "  8\nTable 1: Selected Macroeconomic Indicators: 2000-2004 \n \nNATIONAL    2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \nACCOUNTS \nGDP  $ billion  15.7 15.1 16.4 18.2  19.4\nGDP growth  %  6.0 -1.5 4.0 6.0  5.4\n  Agriculture  %  1.8 -3.4 2.5 1.6  -0.7\n  Manufacturing  %  7.5 -2.1 1.0 5.5  5.2\n  Services  %  7.0 -0.5 6.1 7.9  7.6\n     \nInvestment  % of GDP  28.0 22.0 21.2 22.1  25.0\nSavings  % of GDP  17.4 15.8 14.4 15.9  15.9\nEXTERNAL     \nSECTOR \nExports   $ million  5522 4817 4699 5133  5757\nImports  $ million  7320 5974 6105 6672  8000\nTrade balance  % of GDP  -10.7 -7.3 -8.5 -8.4  -11.2\nCurrent a/c balance   % of GDP  -6.4 -1.4 -1.4 -0.4  -3.3\nFDI  % of GDP  1.0 0.5 1.1 0.9  1.1\nTotal official reserves  $ million  1049 1338 1700 2329  2196\n     \nTourist arrivals  \u2018000 \npersons  400414 336794 393174 500642  566202\nFISCAL   \nVARIABLES   \nGovt. expenditure  % of GDP  26.7 27.5 25.4 23.7  23.5\nGovt. revenue  % of GDP  16.8 16.7 16.5 15.7  15.4\nFiscal balance  % of GDP  -9.9 -10.8 -8.9 -8.0  -8.2\nGovt. debt   % of GDP  96.9 103.2 105.4 105.8  105.5\nPRICES AND   \nMONEY   \nRate of inflation  %  6.2 14.2 9.6 6.3  7.6\nInterest rateb  %  9.89 10.78 7.47 5.27  5.31\nBroad money (M2)  % change  12.9 13.6 13.4 15.3  19.6\nExchange rate  Rs/US$  80.06 93.16 96.73 96.74  104.61\nASPIc   1985=100  447.6 621.0 815.1 1062.1  1506.9\n \nNotes: a.

Symptoms of a bubble economy began to \nemerge: a sharp increase in credit growth to the private sector in excess of 20 per cent, \nwith an estimated 40 per cent of the increase for consumption spending; and a boom in \nthe Colombo stock market unsupported by major indicators of economic fundamentals. \nThe peace process appeared to have stalled, and with privatization initiatives shelved \nconcerns over the government\u2019s ability to reduce the fiscal deficit began to increase. \nMarkets started to get jittery with the growing realization that fundamental imbalances in \nthe  economy  were  intensifying.  Though  the  external  payments  situation  improved \nmarginally  in  December  2004  the  rupee  depreciation  again  gathered  pace.  On  17 \nDecember 2004 the currency fell to a historical low of Rs.105 against the US dollar.   \n \nThus, the tsunami came at a time of bleak economic news. If there was no effective \npolicy response, a slide into crisis became a serious possibility. The tsunami diverted \nattention away from these imbalances but did not eliminate them. As we look at the post-\ntsunami recovery issues and the policy scenarios, it is important to emphasise that the \nsuccessful  post-tsunami  recovery  is  inextricably  tied  to  the  resolution  of  these \nfundamental structural imbalances. \n \n3. Tsunami: Immediate Impact and Response \nThe immediate impact of the tsunami was unprecedented. The death toll is estimated at \nover 36,000 (30,957 people listed as dead with an additional 5644 listed as missing) \naccording to the latest figures available (DCS, 2005). The majority of victims were \nwomen and children. An estimated total of 800,000 people were displaced.  In terms of \nthe dead and missing numbers, Sri Lanka\u2019s toll was second only to Indonesia (126,804, \nmissing 93,458, displaced 474,619), and greater than India (10,749; missing: 5,640; \ninjured: 6,913), and Thailand (over 5,000 dead and 3,000 missing).4 Tens of thousands of \nhouses were damaged or destroyed (including large numbers of fishermen\u2019s houses). 25 \nbeach hotels were severely damaged, and another 6 were completely washed away. 240 \nschools  were  destroyed  or  sustained  serious  damage.  Several  hospitals, \ntelecommunication networks, coastal railway network, etc., were also damaged. \n \nThe geographic impact of the tsunami was uneven. Much of the coastal belt of the \nNorthern, Eastern and Southern Provinces and some parts of the Western Province were \nseverely  damaged.  The  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces  were  particularly  hard  hit \naccounting for two-thirds of deaths and almost 60 per cent of the displacement (Figure 1). \nThe severity of the tsunami disaster in the Northern and Eastern Provinces compounded \nproblems arising from the two decades of conflict: the majority of the 360,000 internally \ndisplaced people live in these two provinces.5  \n \nThe tsunami hit on a public holiday \u2013 a Sunday after the Christmas day, which also \nhappened to be a Full Moon day (a day of religious observance for the majority Buddhist \n                                                 \n4  ADB  (http://www.adb.org/media/Articles/2005/6618_tsunami_impact_Indonesia,  accessed  10/09/05); \nfigures for Thailand are from IMF sources.  \n5 In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, average infant mortality is more than double that of the rest of the \ncountry, maternal mortality is three times as high, and almost 50 per cent of children are under-weight. ", "  10\ncommunity). Most government offices were shut or had only a skeleton staff. The initial \nand immediate response came from community groups.  This was soon followed by \ngovernment  initiatives  organized  by  the  Prime  Minister  \u2013  whose  own  constituency, \nHambantota,  suffered  significant  damage.    The  President,  who  was  in  London  on \nholidays, soon returned to Sri Lanka and assumed overall leadership of the government\u2019s \ntsunami response. Subsequently, other Ministers in charge of key sectors hit by the \ntsunami (fisheries, tourism) also returned from overseas visits and took charge of their \nrespective ministerial responsibilities.  ", "  11\nFigure 1 \n \n \n \nSource: Department of Census and Statistics.  (Permission to publish pending.) \nIn the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, the Ministry of Public Security, Law and \nOrder set up an operations centre, Centre for National Operations (CNO), to handle the ", "  12\nresponse, and the Secretary to the Ministry was appointed as the Commissioner General \nof Essential Services to oversee coordination of government agencies involved in rescue \nand  relief.    Three  Task  Forces  were  set  up  \u2013  Task  Force  for  Rescue  and  Relief \n(TAFRER), Task Force for Logistics, Law and Order (TAFLOL), and Task Force for \nRebuilding the Nation (TAFREN) to address specific aspects of the relief effort. From the \nvery early stages there were concerns about how assistance could be channelled to LTTE \ncontrolled areas. However, it appears that basic relief supplies did manage to get through \nto affected people during the early phases of the relief effort.  \n \n3.1 Immediate Relief Effort: A Success \nWhile there were hiccups and some amount of confusion in organising relief, for a \ncountry that had not previously experienced such a disaster, Sri Lankan institutions \nresponded  reasonably  well.  Essential  medical  aid,  emergency  food  and  other  relief \nsupplies were mobilized within a day. Temporary shelter was provided to the displaced in \nschools,  other  public  and  religious  buildings,  and  tents.    Communities  and  groups \ncooperated across barriers that had divided them for decades. Public and private sector \norganizations cooperated and organized relief efforts at many levels. Sri Lanka\u2019s past \ninvestments in public health paid off in this emergency: the broad-based public health \nsystem and community awareness of basic sanitary and hygienic practices ensured that \nthere were no disease outbreaks.   \n \nOnce the immediate relief and rehabilitation measures for provision of food, shelter, \nclothing, clean water, and sanitary and medical facilities to affected families had been  \nprovided, it was necessary to address community needs to cope with the trauma and start \nrebuilding their lives. A high priority was to restore at least basic education facilities to \naffected children. By mid-year 85 per cent of the children in tsunami-affected areas were \nback in school. Relief efforts included provision of finances to meets immediate needs. \nCompensation of Rs 15,000 ($ 150) was offered for victims towards funeral expenses; \nlivelihood support schemes included payment of Rs. 375 ($3.75) in cash and rations for \neach member of a family unit per week, a payment of Rs. 2,500 ($25) towards kitchen \nutensils.  These  initial  measures  were  largely  successful,  though  there  were  some \nproblems with lack of coordination. 6 \n \nIn the circumstances, the following assessment of the initial response to the tsunami, \npresented to the donor meetings held in Sri Lanka in May 2005, seems an accurate \ndescription of the situation: \n \n\u201cIn the months following the disaster, much has been accomplished. The general \nconsensus  is  that  emergency  relief  was  singularly  successful  in  meeting  the \nimmediate needs of the affected people. The unprecedented outpouring of private \nand institutional generosity meant that families were provided with a place to \nstay,  food  was  distributed,  medical  assistance  was  made  available,  orphaned \n                                                 \n6 For example, while food rations were generally available, there were problems with availability of \nadequate varieties and quality in some locations; complaints emerged about application of different rules \nfor the distribution of rations and cash grants from area to area (Sida, DFID and GTZ, 2005). ", "  13\nchildren were taken into care. Basic public services such as education, electricity \nand security were soon restored to close to pre-tsunami levels.  \n  \nAs a result, the epidemics and deaths that many feared following the disaster \nnever happened. This rapid stabilization of a traumatized population has allowed \nattention to thus quickly be turned towards the, in many ways, more difficult and \ncomplex challenge of assisting the affected areas to return to normalcy and the \naffected families to begin to rebuild their lives.\u201d 7 \n  \nHowever, tackling the next phase of reconstruction and recovery is likely to be both more \ncomplex and difficult. These challenges are discussed in the following sections. \n \n4. Impact Assessment \nIn order to develop a strategy for reconstruction it is necessary to have an assessment of \ndamage. In this respect, Sri Lanka was fortunate to get an early assessment done by end-\nJanuary 2005 through a joint effort of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JIBC), and the World Bank (WB):  \u201cSri Lanka 2005 \nPost-Tsunami Recovery Program \u2013 Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment.\u201d 8  This \nreport provided a picture of the asset damage and economic losses in each affected sector \nand provided an estimate of the overall incremental financing needs.   \n \nThe ADB-JBIC-WB assessment estimated that Sri Lanka had suffered asset damages of \naround  US$  1  billion  (4.5  per  cent  of  GDP),  and  estimated  that  the  medium-term \nfinancing needs (including immediate relief) would be around at US$ 1.5-1.6 billion (7.5 \nper cent of GDP. The largest financing needs were in the housing sector.9 The destruction \nof private assets was substantial ($ 700 million), in addition to public infrastructure and \nother assets. Loss of current output in the fisheries and tourism sectors \u2013 which were \nseverely affected \u2013 were estimated at $ 200 million and $ 130 million, respectively. Key \nindustrial,  agricultural  and  metropolitan  centres  were  relatively  unaffected  and  the \ndamage to capital assets was primarily to tourism and fisheries sectors, each of which \ncontributes only around 1.5-2 per cent of GDP.  \n \nThese aggregate figure for financing needs were quite close to the government\u2018s own \nestimate of US$ 1.8 billion presented in February 2005 though there were some important \ndifferences at the sector level damage estimates (GOSL, 2005a).10 The government of Sri \nLanka (GOSL) subsequently (May 2005) firmed up the country\u2019s total investment needs \nto be US$ 2 billion (GOSL, 2005b) (Table 2). The differences between these estimates \nreflect the government\u2019s more ambitious longer-term plans while the donor assessment \nwas largely geared to restoring the pre-tsunami situation.  \n \n                                                 \n7 http://www.erd.gov.lk/devforum/Executive%20summary%20final.htm \n8 This is available on: http://www.adb.org/Tsunami/sri-lanka-assessment.asp \n9 The significant differences between total recovery needs and damages in some sectors are due to the fact \nthat recovery strategy for those sectors focuses on long term development targets rather than merely on \nrestoration. \n10 GOSL (2005), \u201cPost Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction Strategy\u201d, May 2005.

This relatively small impact on \nGDP appears somewhat surprising given the extent of the asset and human losses. This is \npartly because only a relatively small sector of the economy was affected. It is also \nbecause the impact on current GDP measures only the loss of services from destroyed \ncapital assets and human resources during the current year. The overall impact of the \ntsunami on national income is of course much larger, being the cumulative sum of such \nannual losses incurred in future due to the absence of the destroyed assets. The overall \nimpact on national income over time will depend on how quickly asset replacement or \nrehabilitation will occur.  ", "  15\n \nFurther, spending on relief efforts will have an immediate positive effect on current GDP.  \nAffected  households  have  benefited  from  informal  transfers  by  families,  friends, \ncommunity organizations, etc., to meet their immediate basic needs, lowering the extent \nto which their overall spending would fall. In fact, a significant proportion of foreign \ncapital inflows in early 2005 reflected private transfers to tsunami affected households \nand regions by Sri Lankans domiciled abroad as well as funds generated through private \ndonations. Further, some of the affected households would \u2018smooth\u2019 their consumption \nexpenditures if they had savings or access to credit markets. The overall effect of these \nspending responses induced by the tsunami is to mitigate the fall in aggregate household \nexpenditures.11  \n \n4.2 Expectations and Expenditure Responses \nWhen discussing the immediate economic impact of the tsunami, and likely spending \neffects, it is important to factor in changes in community expectations. Spending and \nsavings decisions are strongly influenced by expectations held about future incomes and \nspending needs. A large natural catastrophe that destroys capital assets and consumer \ndurables can sharply lower expectations of all future income flows.  In other words, there \nis a reduction of the overall wealth available for consumption over their lifetime. When \npeople experience a reduction in their wealth position, a common response is to cut down \non spending to adjust to their lower wealth position. On the other hand, if the fall in \ncurrent income is not expected to be \u2019permanent\u2019, then people will dig into savings or \nborrow, in order to maintain consumption levels. 12   \n \nIn Sri Lanka\u2019s case people\u2019s expectations were dramatically affected by the immediate \nresponse of the international community which promised massive assistance to tsunami \naffected communities and countries in the form of aid flows and debt relief. The impact \nof these promises on the Sri Lankan community was immediate and tangible. There was a \ndiscernible lifting of spirits and a surge of optimism about the future. This optimism was \nfurther strengthened by hopes of an enduring peace in the country based on the cross-\nethnic community solidarity shown in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami.  \n \nThe most visible sign of this almost euphoric mood of optimism following the tsunami \nwas in foreign exchange markets (and subsequently in the Colombo stock market). The \nrupee reversed its long and sustained depreciation and sharply appreciated (figure 2) \u2013 a \nreaction seemingly so perverse and unexpected, but understandable in the context of the \nchange  in  expectations.  In  fact,  in  the  absence  of  Central  Bank  intervention,  the \nappreciation may have been even more pronounced. This issue will be taken up in more \ndetail later. \n \n                                                 \n11 Indeed, it is not impossible \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 for short term GDP to even increase in the wake of a \nmajor catastrophe. \n12 This type of behaviour is known as \u2018consumption smoothing\u2019 and is implied by the \u2018permanent income \nhypothesis\u2019 of consumer behaviour.

Damage and Recovery: A Review  \nThe task of medium term recovery involves the rehabilitation and reconstruction of \ncapital assets (both private and public) as well as the provision of the material and \ninstitutional assistance necessary for households to engage in gainful economic activities \nto  rebuild  their  livelihoods.  This  involves  not  only  the  reconstruction  of  physical \ninfrastructure and replacement of assets, but also the re-establishment of market and \nsocial networks. As indicated, domestic and international assistance enabled the country \nto cope successfully with the immediate relief tasks. Replacement of damaged assets \nessential for full recovery was estimated to require assistance close to US$ 2 billion, a \nmassive sum for Sri Lanka, though relatively minor when compared with the levels of \nassistance given to victims of natural disasters in developed economies.   \n \n5.1 International Assistance for the Recovery Effort \nThe response to Sri Lanka\u2019s request for assistance met with an overwhelming response at \na meeting of international donors held in Sri Lanka in May, 2005. A total of US$ 2.2 \nbillion was pledged over the next 2-3 years \u2013 around $ 700 million per year. US$ 853 \nmillion was promised by NGO and other private sector organizations, and the remainder \nby multilateral donors and governments (for details, see Table 3). In fact, this promised \nexternal assistance \u2013 to meet both continuing relief needs and reconstruction activities - \nwas  in  excess  of  what  the  government  had  requested.  The  task  before  Sri  Lankan \nauthorities seemed to be one of how to manage the funds that would flow in for the \nrecovery effort, rather than how to raise the necessary funds. Funding constraints on the \nrecovery effort seemed to have disappeared.  \n ", "  17\nTable 3: Donor Assistance for Post-tsunami Reconstruction Activities  \n \nDonor   Expected Assistance \n(US$ million) \nBilateral Donors  745 \nMultilateral Agencies  631 \nNGO/Private Sector  853 \nTotal   2229 \n \nSource: Cooray (2005) \n \n5.2 Aid Coordination and Distribution \nA key issue has been the coordination of the relief and reconstruction effort. In Sri Lanka \nthe  coordination  is  required  across  three  groups.  First,  activities  among  the  various \ncomponents of the government require coordination. Second, the activities of various \nagencies and NGOs - with the heavy post-tsunami influx some 180 have been operating \nin Sri Lanka \u2013 require coordination. Third, coordination is required with the LTTE which \ncontrols part of the country that was heavily affected by the tsunami. \n \nAs mentioned earlier, as part of its immediate response to the tsunami the government \nestablished the Centre for National Operations (CNO) to handle relief efforts, and three \ntask forces to address specific aspects of the relief effort.  After one month, with the \nconclusion of immediate relief operations TAFRER and TAFLOL were amalgamated to \na single entity \u2013 the Task Force for Relief (TAFOR) \u2013 to implement all relief measures \nand operations of the CNO were scaled down. In February, the CNO was dissolved and \nofficials returned to line ministries. Two Special Task Forces, namely TAFOR (Task \nForce for Relief) and TAFREN (Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation) took over CNO\u2019s \nresponsibilities. In early March, the Centre for Non-Governmental Sector (CNGS) was \nset up by the Ministry of Finance and Planning to coordinate NGO activities. With \ntransitional  housing  largely  completed,  TAFOR  is  expected  to  wind  up  and  its \nresponsibilities passed to the line Ministries.     \n \nTAFREN now has the lead role in overseeing the rebuilding of infrastructure in key areas \nwith overall responsibility for implementation of the post-tsunami recovery programme. \nWhile an overarching authority such as TAFREN is a sensible option to coordinate post-\ndisaster reconstruction, TAFREN itself lacks links to line ministries in its representation \n(dominated  as  it  is  by  private  sector  representation),  which  hampers  its  ability  to \nefficiently  coordinate  activities  among  government  agencies.  The  division  of \nreconstruction into sectors \u2013 such as housing and water and sanitation \u2013 in turn raises \ncoordination issues to ensure, for example, that housing units constructed get access to \nthe  necessary  water,  sanitation  and  electricity  provisions.  TAFREN  is  seen  to  be \nincreasingly attempting to monitor the line agencies and be a \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 but its role \nand ability to achieve this goal still remains somewhat unclear.  \n \n \n ", "  18\n5.3 Aid Coordination with Donor Agencies and NGOs \nThe second group whose activities need coordination involves the NGOs. Sri Lanka has \nlong experience working with major donor agencies and several international NGOs \n(INGOs) have long established operations in the country. Sri Lanka had seen some \nwelcome moves towards donor coordination even prior to the tsunami in the context of its \nconflict-related donor reconstruction programmes. The World Bank, ADB and the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC) had already established a partnership that \nenabled the basis for the very useful needs assessment to be done immediately after the \ntsunami. However, coordination with donor agencies and NGOs became a vastly more \ncomplicated issue due to the numbers and practices of the numerous international NGOs \n(not counting large numbers of individuals and small groups) who came in after the \ntsunami. \n \nSome of the NGOs \u2013 both INGOs and domestic NGOs who receive external funds - \ncontrol significant funds. Eith their own funding secure, they face few incentives to \nimprove coordination. In fact, some are openly hostile to any government action that \nseems to place \u2018controls\u2019 on their independence.  NGOs vary widely in experience, skills \nand operating styles. Many NGOs lack experience and local knowledge, and in their \nhaste to spend monies disregard local circumstances and community needs.  \n \nFurther, the presence of large numbers of donors/NGOs has at times led to competitive \nbehaviour. Deep mistrust has developed in several locations between local NGOs (who \nhave often been working in the area for many years) and some INGOs and agencies who \nhave come for tsunami assistance. Sri Lankan NGOs claim to have been \u2018crowded out\u2019 \nby some of the better financially endowed larger INGOs, who have \u2018poached\u2019 staff and \nresources. Certainly some INGOs and agencies have greater expertise in large scale \ndisaster relief (such as provision of transitional shelters and other relief measures), but \ndomestic NGOs (and INGOs that have operated in Sri Lanka for a long period) usually \nhave a much greater appreciation of local conditions and sensitivities. Greater interaction, \nengagement  and  coordination  between  them  would  benefit  the  overall  relief  and \nreconstruction effort. Field observations suggest that lack of coordination has led to \nconsiderable mal-distribution of aid. In recent months, mechanisms have been set in place \nto better coordinate donor activities, including NGOs, at regional and local levels through \nregular meetings and consultations held by regional administrative officers. It is too early \nto judge their overall effectiveness. \n \n5.4 Aid Coordination in LTTE Held Territory \nThe third group with whom activities need to be coordinated is the LTTE. This has been \nthe most difficult and contentious issue.  Discussions to establish a mechanism for aid \nsharing have been going on since soon after the tsunami. The spontaneous solidarity that \nunited communities immediately after tsunami rekindled hopes that the ethnic divisions \nthat have cost the country so dearly in recent years may finally be waning. However, a \nmutually acceptable arrangement for aid sharing to enable assistance to flow into the \nLTTE controlled areas has proved elusive.  \n ", "  19\nOn the one hand, sections within the government and many majority community groups \nhave been opposed to any deal that appears to provide de facto recognition to the LTTE \nas the administrative power in regions controlled by them. On the other hand, the LTTE \nhas been unwilling to accept an arrangement that dilutes their powers. After long drawn \nout negotiations a MOU setting out an aid-sharing deal between the GOSL and the \nLTTE, the Post Tsunami Operation Management Structure (P-TOMS), was signed in \nJune 2005. This was designed as a mechanism to distribute aid in LTTE-controlled areas \nin the Northern and Eastern Provinces of the country. The P-TOMS agreement envisaged \nthe setting up of a Regional Fund to allow donors to channel tsunami funds directly to the \nNorthern and Eastern Provinces. A multilateral agency (anticipated to be the World \nBank) was to be appointed as the custodian.  \n \nHowever, this agreement promptly ran into opposition from within the majority Sinhalese \ncommunity. Challenged in the courts through a fundamental rights petition, the P-TOMS \nagreement was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in July \n2005. An interim injunction was issued, putting on hold key aspects of the agreement \npending a final determination in mid-Sept 2005. In addition, many of the major donors \nwho had supported the idea of a joint mechanism for aid distribution between the GOSL \nand the LTTE declined to channel aid directly to the Regional Fund once the MOU was \nsigned claiming that the LTTE remains a \u2018proscribed terrorist organization\u2019 in their \ncountries.  The signing of the P-TOMS agreement led to the government losing its \nmajority in Parliament when one of the constituent parties of the government, the Janatha \nVimukthi Peramuna (JVP), left the government ranks. With a presidential election to be \nheld in November the future of the agreement remains unclear, as one of the leading \ncandidates, the current Prime Minister, has pledged not to implement it if he were to be \nelected.  \n \n5.5 Livelihood Issues \nThe loss of lives and infrastructure (livelihood related assets, residential houses, social \nand capital infrastructure) along two-thirds of the coastline \u2013 with many districts which \nhave poverty levels higher than the national average \u2013 has plunged large numbers of \npeople into poverty. For the affected districts in the North and East, the resulting stresses \nworsened the already heavy burden of pre-existing marginalization as a result of two \ndecades of conflict. The following sections survey developments in the main affected \nsectors as well as the main livelihood assistance programmes put in place. \n \n5.5.1 Fisheries \nThe tsunami impact was most severe in the fisheries sector. It is estimated that at least \n7,500 fishermen died while one-third of the affected households were engaged in fishing \nor fishing-related activities.  In some areas this figure is much higher. For example, in the \nnorthern Jaffna district the figure is close to 90 per cent. An estimated 16,500 boats and \none million nets were damaged or destroyed. As at June 2005, the number of boats \nrepaired or replaced stood at 13,073 (TAFREN, 2005).13  \n \n                                                 \n13 TAFREN (2005), \u201cRebuilding Sri Lanka: Post-tsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation\u201d June 2005.  ", "  20\nThe problems that have emerged in the fisheries sector highlight some of the complex \nproblems in providing livelihood assistance to match community needs in difficult post-\ndisaster conditions. Assistance to replace damaged boats has been forthcoming from \nmany donors who recognised their capacity to generate an immediate income and the \nnumber of boats is already close to pre-tsunami levels.  However, because the fishing \nindustry uses a wide range of vessels, fishing techniques and practices, including the use \nof a wide variety of nets, fishing vessels that have been provided do not always match \ncommunity requirements. This reflects inadequate dialogue with the affected fishermen \nand poor coordination among donor agencies in procurement and distribution of vessels \nand equipment. \n \nThe uncoordinated replacement of fishing vessels in some locations has resulted in a \nlarger number of smaller vessels than before the tsunami, potentially leading to over-\nfishing. Typically, the smaller boats have been repaired and replaced fastest with over 80 \nper cent restored countrywide compared to the more expensive multi-day and 3.5 ton \nboats which indicate a replacement of between 60-70 per cent.  However, replacement \nhas been quite uneven. In the southern areas such as Kalutara, Hambantota and Galle, as \nwell as Trincomalee in the east, the number of traditional craft already exceeds the pre-\ntsunami levels. Data also shows that many NGOs are planning to continue providing \nboats  which  in  some  places  could  lead  to  a  doubling  of  pre-tsunami  fishing  effort, \nespecially in the near shore coastal areas which were already subject to over-fishing prior \nto  the  tsunami.  As  a  result,  efforts  are  underway  to  encourage  a  reduction  in  the \ndistribution of small craft. Some NGOs have been responsive; Sewa Lanka, an NGO, \ncancelled an order for 2000 traditional canoes. \n \nHowever, access to engines and nets are still a problem. While the replacement of boats \nhas been generally rapid, only an estimated 50 per cent are being used due to lack of \nengines and nets. It is estimated that about 1,700 engines have been repaired. While \nanother 6,000 engines have been ordered, by end June 2005 only 450 had actually been \ndelivered. In terms of nets, an order has been issued for 46,000 nets \u2013 mostly from \ninternational suppliers \u2013 but the suppliers can only provide half the order due to the post \ntsunami surge in demand.   \n \nDomestic demand for fish has revived after plummeting after tsunami \u2013 consumers were \nreluctant to eat fish that they suspected may have fed on human bodies that were swept \nout to the sea - and market channels appear to be reviving robustly.  14 Despite the \nconsiderable loss of life, signs are that fisheries output will regain (if not exceed) pre-\ntsunami levels once equipment is replaced, and damages to small fishing ports and \nharbours  are  repaired.  The  pace  at  which  the  fisheries  sector  infrastructure  will  be \nrestored is obviously critical to sustained recovery of the sector. \n \n5.5.2 Tourism \nThe tsunami dealt yet another blow to Sri Lanka\u2019s volatile tourist industry just as it was \nbeginning to enjoy a revival in the wake of the ceasefire agreement. About a half of the \n                                                 \n14 Consumer rejection of fish immediately after the tsunami has also been observed in other tsunami-\naffected locations such as Indonesia. ", "  21\n105 large and medium scale hotels in the affected areas \u2013 which are the heart of \u2018beach \ntourism\u2019 \u2013 were partially damaged and 8 hotels were fully damaged. About a quarter (58 \nof the 242 registered hotels) in the country were affected.  In terms of rooms, about 3,500 \nout of a total of 14,000 rooms in medium to large scale hotels were out of service in late \nFebruary 2005.   \n \nMost  larger  and  medium  scale  tourist  enterprises  had  insurance  cover  for  natural \ncatastrophes  including  earthquakes,  and  this  was  interpreted  as  providing  tsunami \nliability. An estimated US$ 150 million was paid out on claims after tsunami, the bulk \ngoing to the hotel industry. This suggests that some hotels would at least partially cover \ntheir  reconstruction  costs.  However,  most  hoteliers  did  not  have  cover  for  the \nconsequential impacts of the disasters such as cancellations, etc., and have had to bear \nthese costs in full. Since the tsunami, insurance companies are including tsunami cover as \npart of their natural catastrophe cover. However, this has led to about a one-third increase \nin the cost of insurance, rising from 0.1 per cent of the value of assets to about 0.13 per \ncent. For a medium sized hotel worth about US$ 3 million, this would be an increase in \npremiums of about US$ 900 while for a large hotel worth about US$ 15 million the \nincrease in premium would be US$ 4,500. While significant, they do not appear to place \nan overly high cost burden. \n \nThe tsunami may have more significant medium-term impacts on future tourist arrivals \nand occupancy rates. In 2004 the tourism sector had a record season with arrivals topping \n565,000. Tourist arrivals were expected to reach 600,000 in 2005 with 150,000 arrivals \nduring the first 3 months of the year. This estimate has now been revised downwards to \n425,000 arrivals in 2005 and 575,000 in 2006 \u2013 although there are suggestions that this \nmay be too optimistic. Around 40 per cent of the foreign guest night stays in Sri Lanka \nare spent along the beaches of the island\u2019s southern and eastern coasts. For some of the \nundamaged hotels in the affected regions occupancies are currently high as tourists are \nreplaced with aid workers, etc., at least on a temporary basis, while in other undamaged \ncoastal hotels the occupancy rate is under 10 per cent. Hotels in the interior are also \nregistering lower occupancies due to the drastic downturn in tourist arrivals, but Colombo \nhotels are full with regular business travellers and tsunami related visitors.   \n \nFor the coastal beach industry the tsunami could provide an opportunity, as with the \nfisheries industry, to rebuild the industry in a more sustainable fashion. Most hotels have \nalready started reconstruction work. The Ministry of Tourism is assisting the tourism \nsector with a major \u2018Bounce Back Sri Lanka\u2019 campaign which combines public relations \nwith assistance to develop \u2018world class\u2019 coastal tourist facilities. The industry is also \nreceiving duty free import privileges for necessary equipment for reconstruction, and the \nCentral Bank has a loan facility for small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) which \ncovers  the  tourism  industry.  Long  term  confidence  in  the  industry  is  indicated  by \ncontinuing work on a number of luxury hotels. The Tourist Board has taken steps to offer \nnew Tourist Zones where land and other infrastructure will be provided. The Tourist \nBoard aims to develop 15 tourist zones at a cost of US$ 12 million each with donor \nfunding.  \n ", "  22\nHowever, for many affected people who gained their incomes directly or indirectly from \nthe tourism industry there are pressing livelihood issues. If the tsunami proves to have a \ndepressing effect on tourist arrivals, even with rapid reconstruction, recovery in the \ntourism  sector  can  be  delayed.  Many  hotel  employees,  though  they  may  get  their \nemployment back once hotels are reconstructed, have no immediate alternative income \nsources. The situation is similar or even worse for many small enterprises that catered to \ntourists (e.g., handicrafts such as lace making).  \n \n5.5.3 Cash grants \nFor families, particularly poorer families who have lost family members, homes, other \nassets and employment, immediate cash relief is vital. Hence the Rs 5,000 ($50) per \nmonth cash grant and the Rs. 375 ($ 3.75) cash and food ration were a welcome part of \nthe assistance package. By end June 2005, almost all the eligible 880,000 beneficiaries \nwere reportedly receiving the Rs. 375 ($ 3.75) cash and food ration (TAFREN, 2005).15  \nIn the case of the Rs. 5,000 monthly grant, all households identified as affected appear to \nhave received the initial two payments, either in January and February or sometime after. \nWhere the reach of the state banks was limited, such as the Northern Province, alternative \narrangements had been made. The grant scheme seems to have proved very effective in \nreaching most of the affected population, assisting people with little engagement in the \nformal financial sector even to start deposits (which were mandatory to receive funds).  \n \nHowever,  after  the  first  two  payments  the  Ministry  of  Finance  ordered  Divisional \nSecretaries to revise the lists of eligible beneficiaries, and reduce the number of families \nreceiving  payments.  Eligibility  criteria  have  changed  from  time  to  time,  different \ncirculars have been sent, and full information has not been placed in the public domain. \nMost tsunami affected families are not fully aware of the new criteria. The government \ncirculars announcing the revised criteria seem very broad, offering significant discretion \nto local government officers leading to wide variations in interpretation, delays and long \nback-logs  of  appeals.  Interviews  with  relevant  stakeholders,  including  both  affected \nfamilies and government officials, suggest that households having access to \u2018regular \nincome\u2019 are no longer eligible. It has taken several months took to draw up new lists of \nthose eligible to receive the grant based on changing government circulars. This has \ncreated added confusion, uncertainty and anger among the tsunami-affected households.   \n \nThe current situation with regard to this payment is somewhat unclear. According to \nTAFREN, payments were being made to 234,000 eligible beneficiaries by the end of \nJune 2005 (TAFREN, 2005).16 According to the World Bank website in early September \nonly  about  140,000  families  are  benefiting  from  the  livelihood  grant  scheme.  Its \ndistribution is being audited for both financial management and to ensure money is \nreaching genuine tsunami victims. The World Bank expects that this programme will be \nextended for a further two months \u2013 for a total of four months - before it is phased out. \n \nWhile it may seem equitable to narrow the scope of the grant so that it targets the \u2018truly \nneedy\u2019, in practice the costs of such narrow targeting may well exceed benefits. In \n                                                 \n15 TAFREN (2005), \u201cRebuilding Sri Lanka: Post-tsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation\u201d June 2005. \n16 TAFREN (2005), \u201cRebuilding Sri Lanka: Post-tsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation\u201d June 2005. ", "  23\nassessing the changes to this programme, it should be noted that even households with a \n\u2018regular\u2019 post tsunami income have suffered a major loss of wealth in terms of property \nand possessions and are cash strapped. The chances of them slipping into the pitfalls of \nhigh interest informal sector borrowings to meet many pressing needs are high. Perhaps \nmost critically, any decision to take recipients with a regular income off the list after only \ntwo monthly payments generates perverse incentives, effectively penalizing not only \nthose who have held on to previous jobs, but perhaps even more importantly, those who \nhave managed to obtain regular employment after the tsunami. If donor assistance is \navailable for this programme \u2013 and it is hard to see why funds are not available going by \nthe May 2005 pledges are being honoured \u2013 given the obvious need to provide affected \nhouseholds  with  some  income,  cutbacks  are  hard  to  justify.  Moreover,  since  bank \naccounts have been opened for the cash grant transfer, the system is extremely cost \neffective  compared  to  the  high  transactions  costs  of  many  other  tsunami  livelihood \nprojects which often incur as much as 30 per cent administrative overhead costs.    \n \nIn a number of locations, the larger international NGOs in particular have introduced cash \nfor work programmes such as clearing of rubble and rebuilding of transitional shelters. \nTypically, the daily wage rate offered is Rs. 300-350 ($ 3-3.50) for men and women; this \nis close to the average daily wage rate that has prevailed until recently for men, but is \nhigher than the usual wage rate for women (though with inflation, wages and these rates \nmay soon become unattractive). The advantages of this cash for work is that it enables \naffected people to obtain employment while addressing the shortage of labour to clear \ndebris and put up transitional shelters. However, this approach has some limitations. In \npractice, cash for work largely benefits able bodied people, primarily men. The old, \nyoung, sick and disabled and carers (typically females who find it difficult to leave their \ndependants) find it difficult to benefit from such arrangements. It has also faced some \nresistance  from  local  NGOs,  who  feel  it  undermines  the  voluntary  approach  to \ncommunity action through shramadana (\u2018gift of labour\u2019), and may also lack the funds to \npay these wage rates.  \n \n5.5.4 Micro-enterprises and Microfinance \nMany tsunami affected households were engaged in micro-enterprises with as many as \n25,000 micro-enterprises estimated to have been damaged. In addition, there are an \nestimated 15,000 tsunami survivors involved in self-employment and informal sector \nactivities  such  as  food  processing,  coir  manufacture,  carpentry,  toddy  tapping  and \ntailoring. Many of these workers urgently need funds to replace lost or destroyed assets \nsuch as equipment and stocks. While fisheries have been relatively well served by the \nrelief effort, it is clear that many other livelihood activities have received less attention. \nOften activities such as coir and lace making are more important for women so their \nslower recovery may impact more on female headed households (who comprise about a \nsixth of affected households). In some places, tension has grown between fishers and \nother livelihood groups because the latter feel that the fishing industry has received \ngreater attention.  \n \nWhile boats, nets and other equipment (supplied through the relief agencies) are central \nto recovery of fishing activities, credit is the critical input for many micro-enterprises. ", "  24\nThe problems faced by poorer communities in accessing formal sector credit are well \nknown.  Such  difficulties  are  exacerbated  when  communities  are  affected  by  natural \ndisasters which damage the few assets they may have had to offer as collateral, reduce the \nnumber of people who can act as guarantors, while sharply increasing the need for credit. \nRecovery of many micro-enterprises then depends on the availability of microfinance. 17 \n \nA  host  of  programmes  to  address  this  need  for  microfinance  is  in  the  process  of \nimplemntation. Prior to the tsunami, Sri Lanka had a relatively well served microfinance \nsector including commercial and rural banks serving smaller customers (e.g., Cooperative \nRural Banks and Regional Development Banks), and organisations adopting a grassroots \napproach  to  microfinance  where  a  group  will  operate  a  revolving  credit  fund  (e.g., \nSanasa, Sarvodya SEEDs). To support a strong repayment culture, most microfinance \norganizations are encouraged not to switch to grants. Where grants are necessary, for \nexample for housing and food, they are best provided not by microfinance organizations \nbut alternative institutional mechanisms.      \n \nWhile there is much interest in providing new loans a pressing issue is how to handle old \nloans.  In  general,  individual  banks  and  microfinance  institutions  are  being  left  to \nnegotiate this on a case-by-case basis because they have the best knowledge of a client\u2019s \nneeds and ability to repay. Typically, microfinance organizations only forgive loans in \nthe event of death or permanent disability, but many recognize that the tsunami situation \nis not one of wilful defaulting. However, there are concerns that borrowers face many \nunforeseen risks such as drought, floods or political volatility and risk. In this context, \nsome microfinance organizations prefer to avoid using the tsunami to create a precedence \nfor loan forgiveness. Instead, the preference is for loan rescheduling allowing the client \ntime to return to a normal positive cash flow. Loans can even be provided to replace lost \nassets and increase future earnings. This can often be in the long-term interest of the \nclient because loan defaults will make it harder to access future credit.  \n \nThe Central Bank has been implementing a microfinance scheme (Susahana) through the \ntwo state-owned commercial banks. The Susahana loan is provided with no repayment \nrequired for the first year and interest at a fixed rate of 6 per cent thereafter. The National \nDevelopment  Trust  Fund  (NDTF)  is  also  offering  similar  terms  through  its  partner \norganizations. By end June 2005, 4,154 applicants had received Rs. 1,940 million (US$ \n19 million) through the Susahana scheme of the state banks and another 4,437 people had \nreceived Rs. 158 million (US$ 1.58 million) through the NDTF scheme.  \n \nDespite claims to the contrary and its stated intention to also reach micro-entrepreneurs, \nthe Susahana lending schemes have been set up in a way that makes it very difficult for \nsmall  tsunami  affected  micro-entrepreneurs  to  obtain  access  to  the  scheme.  The \nconditions  for  access  were  onerous.  There  were  initial  constraints  in  passing  on \ninformation to those in the camps and helping with application forms. Guarantors are \nrequired who have a permanent income above a certain threshold level. Collateral is \nrequired, for which land within the buffer zone is not acceptable; it is not yet clear how \n                                                 \n17 The potential role of microfinance in such situations is documented in a growing literature. See, for \nexample, Mathison (2003( and ILO (2005).  ", "  25\nthis may change given changes to buffer zone building rules recently announced. Loans \nwill only be given for businesses registered before the tsunami, which rules out many \nsmaller unregistered businesses \u2013 many small enterprises were not registered \u2013 and stops \npeople  taking  up  new  livelihoods  in  response  to  their  changed  post-tsunami \ncircumstances, such as the death of the main earner, disability or new responsibilities to \ncare for some family members. The terms of the Susahana need to be urgently reviewed \nto ensure that they can start to reach the poorer micro-entrepreneurs.18  \n \nThe  ADB  has  supported  a  major  microfinance  scheme  for  Sri  Lanka  which  works \nthrough grassroots organisations. In principle this scheme has the ability to address the \nlimitations of the Susahana programme. It announced in February 2005 that US$ 7 \nmillion will be used to reach tsunami affected communities through this programme. In \nour fieldwork for this report, we were unable to determine the ground level scope and \neffectiveness of this programme. However, it is clear that a successful microfinance \nprogramme would meet an urgent need, particularly in meeting the financing needs of \ntsunami affected micro-enterprises to rebuild their livelihoods. \n \n6. Rebuilding Capital Assets and Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  of  damaged  housing  and  infrastructure  forms  the  core  of  the  capital \nexpenditure programmes associated with post-tsunami recovery. Donor funding is seen as \ncritical to this task, so funds were sought at donor meetings in May 2005 to meet assessed \nneeds. Public infrastructure rebuilding is expected to be financed almost entirely by \nforeign  donors  with  multilateral  agencies  as  well  as  individual  countries  accepting \nparticular projects for financing. Major communication and transport links have been \nrepaired, at least on a temporary basis. However, in many cases public buildings and \nother infrastructure, such as bridges, are yet to be fully repaired or rebuilt on a permanent \nbasis, particularly in the North and the East of the country.   \n \nForeign financing is also expected to fund most of the new residential dwellings planned \nfor affected households for whom new houses have been planned; NGOs (including some \nlocal  NGOs)  and  private  corporate  enterprises  are  expected  provide  a  significant \nproportion of required finances.  \n \nIn both cases, actual progress will depend not only on the extent to which promised \nassistance actually materialises but also on the extent to which funds are able to finance \nthe  actual  costs  of  rehabilitation  and  rebuilding.  As  will  be  discussed  later,  cost \nescalations and fiscal pressures are likely to place serious question marks over the extent \nto which reconstruction can be successfully implemented. \n \n6.1 Residential Housing  \nBoth the ADB-JBIC-WB needs assessment and the GOSL assessment presented to the \ndonors in May 2005 identified damage to housing as the single largest source of damage \nto  physical  assets  (Table  2).  Field  interviews  conducted  by  the  IPS  and  other \n                                                 \n18 There are also non-financial services required to help the poor develop new skills and access markets so \nthat they can put microfinance to good use. There may also be problems accessing credit for those who are \nnot already members of revolving credit societies.     ", "  26\norganizations have shown that housing is viewed by the displaced families as their main \nconcern, and regaining an acceptable permanent shelter is their priority goal. The housing \nissue in some detail below both because of its central importance, and also because it \nhighlights some of the main policy concerns that emerge from our analysis. \n \n6.2 Housing and the Buffer Zone \nFrom the very outset, the housing issue was affected by the government announcement in \nthe immediate aftermath of the tsunami that it would enforce a \u2018no-build\u2019 coastal buffer \nzone of 200 metres in the north and east coasts of the country and 100 metres elsewhere. \nIt  was  announced  that  residents  within  the  zone  would  not  be  permitted  to  rebuild \ndamaged or destroyed buildings. The larger distance in the north and east was claimed to \nbe justified by the generally more extensive intrusion of the sea on this coast and the \nhigher risk of cyclones on this coastline. In the areas controlled by the LTTE, initial \nreports suggested that a similar \u2013 or even wider \u2013 buffer zone would be put into effect.19 \nThe government promised that for people whose houses within the buffer zone were \ndamaged, new houses would be provided for them, built on lands in reasonable proximity \nthat would be acquired for the purpose.   \n \nIn the buffer zone where construction was not to be permitted, the TAFREN guidance of \n15 March 2005 stated that the government \u201cwill identify land closest to the affected \nvillage and provide houses to the affected families. As far as possible, the relocation \nprocess will attempt to keep communities intact\u201d. The following assistance policy was to \napply: \n\u2022  No reconstruction of houses (partially or fully damaged) will be allowed \nwithin the buffer zone. \n\u2022  All  affected  households  will  be  provided  with  a  house  built  with  donor \nassistance on land allocated by the state. Households will not be required to \ndemonstrate ownership to land.(Our emphasis) \n\u2022  The new homes will be built in line with guidelines issued by the UDA and \nwill have a floor area of 500 sq. ft. and would be provided with electricity, \nrunning water, sanitation and drainage facilities. \n\u2022  The proposed houses in urban and rural settlements will have facilities such as \nroad systems, recreation, etc. \n \nOwners of damaged houses were to be allowed to keep their land for agriculture and \nwould be offered free land and houses at an alternative site. Undamaged houses and \nhotels (even if damaged) would be allowed to remain in the buffer zone. For residents \nwithin the buffer zone, the government planned to assist not only landowners, but all \n                                                 \n19 Buffer and \u2018set back\u2019 zones are both ways to create space between human development and the coast. \nThey do not reduce the affects of hazards such as tsunami waves but are designed to move the population \naway from hazardous areas. Such zones facilitate costal eco-system conservation by restricting certain \ntypes of human activities, which may, among others, have beneficial effects on wave damage. A coastal \nsetback has been defined as \u201ca prescribed distance to a coastal feature, such as the line of permanent \nvegetation, within which all or certain types of development are prohibited\u201d (\u201cCoastal Zone Management \nPlan Sri Lanka 2004\u201d: Coast Conservation Department, Government of Sri Lanka). For a discussion of \nbuffer zones in developing countries, see Ebregt and De Greve (2000). ", "  27\nresidents (including encroachers) with some form of housing. This was estimated to \nrequire around 50,000 permanent houses. \n \nFor those whose damaged houses were located outside the buffer zone, the government \nagreed to provide grants and loans for households outside the buffer zone to rebuild in the \nsame place. The grants are provided through the state banks with funding from donor \nagencies. According to TAFREN guidance of 15 March 2005, the following criterion was \nto apply to households outside the buffer zone: \n \nAll  affected  households  outside  the  buffer  zone  that  are  able  to  demonstrate \nownership of land will be entitled to a grant by the state.   Households that do not \nhave ownership to the land are not entitled to this assistance. \n \nDamages are assessed on a points basis, judged by a Verification Committee.20 If a house \nis more than 40 per cent damaged, a grant of Rs. 250,000 ($ 2,500) is given in 4 \ninstalments, based on progress.  If a house is less than 40 per cent damaged, then a grant \nof Rs. 100,000 ($ 1,000) is provided, disbursed in 2 stages.21 \n \nBuffer Zones are a widely used operational approach to conservation in many different \ncontexts. The concept of a buffer zone was a reaction to the widespread damage inflicted \non communities who resided in close proximity to the coast. This approach not only \nhighlighted the potential dangers of being very close to the sea but also drew attention to \nthe considerable numbers of people who were, in effect, illegal squatters on government \nland or occupying houses that had been built in violation of law. In promulgating the \nbuffer zone, an overriding concern of the government may have been that in the event of \na similar natural catastrophe (another tsunami or cyclone) that led to loss of life or \ndestroyed rebuilt houses, the government would inevitably be blamed in the absence of a \ndesignated no-build zone.  \n \nBut there were also other considerations that probably played a part. The 1981 Coast \nConservation  Act  (1981,  as  amended  in  1988)  prohibits  any  person  to  engage  in  a \n\"development activity\" (which includes aquaculture) within the coastal zone unless such \nperson is authorized by a permit issued by the Director of Coast Conservation. According \nto the Act, no permit can be issued if the activity has any adverse effect on the stability, \nproductivity and environmental quality of the coastal zone. This Act, however, has never \nbeen strictly enforced. It appeared, however, as if this was the time, at last, to start to \nimplement  some  measures  of  coastal  conservation  that  also  ensured  that  significant \nnumbers of people would be moved away from areas where they were vulnerable to wave \ndamage.  The  Coastal  Conservation  Department  (CCD)  Chief,  Dr.  R.  A.  D.  B. \nSamaranayake, for example, was reported to have pledged that that the CCD would from \n                                                 \n20  In  addition,  households  that  have  successfully  utilized  the  grant  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for  a \nconcessionary loan of Rs 500,000 from the 2 state-owned commercial banks. \n21 Since it became clear that there is considerable inequity in providing the same sum of money to rebuild \nhouses with broken windows as against those houses that have suffered greater damage (even though the \ndamage is less than 40 per cent), a new one-off payment of Rs. 50,000 ($ 500) is being considered for those \nwhose house damage is less than 20 points according to the damage verification system.    ", "  28\nnow on strictly adhere to the buffer zone rule and no new construction or reconstruction \nwould be allowed, pointing out that many houses along the coastal line, which were \ndestroyed by the tsunami, were illegal.22  \n \nFrom the very outset the buffer zone became a politically controversial issue which \ngenerated significant opposition from community and business groups. The zone limits \nwere not based on prior community consultations and did not correspond to tsunami \ndamage. They did not take into account topographical and other relevant features of the \nland that would affect hazard risks. Hence the underlying rationale for the 100 and 200 \nmeter limits appeared arbitrary. The government\u2019s defence was that it needed to act fast \nbefore people moved back and a uniform approach was the fairest and quickest way to do \nso. There was also dissatisfaction that the rules applied only to residents whose houses \nwere damaged but not to tourist enterprises who would be permitted to rebuild, and that \nhouseholds whose houses had not suffered damage were permitted to continue living in \nthem. Indeed, much of the seaside of Galle Road in Colombo \u2013 one the most densely \npopulated strips of land in the country \u2013 falls within the buffer zone. If the rationale for \nthe buffer zone is public safety, then it should presumably be applied uniformly to all \nstructures, though it may be argued that in a period of acute housing shortages, it would \nnot be sensible to knock down undamaged houses or attempt to relocate large numbers of \npeople who already have houses to live in.   \n \nWhatever merits the government\u2019s case had \u2013 indeed the concept of a buffer zone for \ncoastal  eco-system  management  does  have  considerable  value  -  the  discriminatory \nmanner in which the no-build rules applied were bound to create dissatisfaction and raise \nsuspicions about possible ulterior motives. While many tsunami victims, particularly \nthose whose houses had been severely damaged by the tsunami and had lost family \nmembers,  were  not  enthusiastic  about  rebuilding  in  the  same  location,23  they  were \nconcerned about being relocated away from their places of employment or business and \nabout the possibility that they would lose their properties to others (such as tourist \nenterprises who could rebuild). Many tsunami victims were fishermen who need to keep \ntheir boats and supplies near the shore while some fishing activities \u2013 such as drawing in \nof large nets (Ma Del) \u2013 require community participation. In urban and densely populated \nareas, relocation of business-related buildings to an interior location could be very costly.  \n \nThe community concerns were articulated in the political sphere. The main opposition \nparty, the United National Party (UNP), declared that it was opposed to restrictions being \nplaced on citizens who wanted to rebuild their tsunami damaged houses within the buffer \nzone.  Nevertheless,  senior  government  leaders  continued  to  affirm  their  strong \ncommitment to maintaining the buffer zone limits until quite recently.  But, as pressure \nmounted, signs emerged that the government commitment may not be as firm as publicly \nstated. In some locations in the east coast, the policy had been relaxed by early August, \nthough with no public pronouncements. By the end of August the government abandoned \ntheir inflexible approach to apply buffer zone restrictions, and a relaxation of policy \n                                                 \n22 Daily News, 02/02/05. \n23 In fact, a survey conducted by the IPS found that three-quarters of households within the designated \nbuffer zone do not wish to rebuild on the same site (IPS, 2005) ", "  29\nappears to allow households within the buffer zone to repair or rebuild damaged houses, \nif they choose to do so. The full details of the new guidelines are, however, yet to be \nannounced. \n \nThe implications of these changes on government policy on the buffer zone for the house \nreconstruction strategy and funding needs remain to be spelled out. If house rebuilding or \nrepairs within the buffer zone do not attract financial assistance from the government (or \nfrom aid funds channelled through the government), the financial implications for the \npublic house building programme would depend on decisions regarding the eligibility of \nthose households to receive new alternative houses.    \n \n6.3 Housing Programme Progress \nThe housing situation for the tsunami-affected communities in Sri Lanka has made some \nprogress. The number of displaced declined to 516,000 by mid-June 2005 from the \n800,000 or so figure in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami as people returned to their \nhomes (even if they are destroyed or damaged) and were removed from the statistics. An \ninitial 169,000 people housed in schools and tents have largely been moved to transitional \nshelters (to bridge the gap between emergency accommodation and permanent housing). \nTransitional shelters were only being provided for the affected households in the buffer \nzone. By end August 2005, it was estimated by TAFREN that approximately 52,383 \ntransitional  shelters,  housing  some  250,000  tsunami  displaced  people,  have  been \nconstructed  since  February  2005  on  492  sites.  A  total  of  55,000  such  shelters  are \nexpected to be completed by end September 2005, thus completing the transitional house \nbuilding programme, and this target appears likely to be met. The need for care and \nmaintenance  of  such  shelters  becomes  increasingly  important  as  permanent  housing \nreconstruction becomes delayed. The GOSL has agreed with donor agencies and NGOs \nto a plan detailing the responsibilities for care and maintenance over the next 1-2 years.   \n \nEarly estimates suggested the total number of houses fully or partially damaged to be \naround 113,000. Revised figures published by the Department of Census and Statistics at \nend August 2005 estimate the tsunami to have destroyed over 77,561 houses (the figures \nplace the number of fully damaged housing units to be 41,393 and partially damaged \nhousing units to be 36,168).24 Of the total 77,500 houses damaged, nearly 50,000 are \nestimated  to  have  been  within  the  buffer  zone  stipulated  by  the  GOSL  requiring \nrelocation of the households to new houses.   \n \nThe government unit charged with this task is the Tsunami Housing Reconstruction Unit \n(THRU) based in the Urban Development Authority (UDA). The THRU has been signing \nMemoranda of Understanding (MOU) with donors who have offered to construct houses \n(international and national NGOs and some private companies). The MOU states that \n\u201cthe donor shall bear the cost of construction of the housing units which has been \nestimated  to  be  around  Rs.  400,000  per  single  storey  detached  type  housing  unit \nincluding the cost of basic amenities such as water, electricity and sewage within the \n                                                 \n24 The figures for total houses destroyed vary. For example, other GOSL estimates suggest that the number \nof houses destroyed is over 99,000 (GOSL (2005b). \n ", "  30\nhouse\u201d.25 The MOU also states that the house must have a minimum of 500 square feet \nwith two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and toilet; and that construction must be in \nkeeping with planning guidelines, design specification and standards given by the UDA. \nThe  donor  must  employ  a  contractor  registered  with  the  Institute  for  Construction \nTraining and Development (ICTAD) or any other government construction agency. The \ntype of pre-built housing will depend on the land available. The relatively slow progress \nin  house  construction  has  been  attributed  partly  to  problems  associated  with  the \nacquisition of suitable land for relocation.  \n \nA survey carried out by the IPS indicates that if there is adequate land, the preferred \noption of most households is single storey detached houses on individual land plots of \nabout 10 perches (IPS, 2005). As land becomes more limited, the proposals by order of \npreference  include  the  following:  (i)  single  storey  attached  houses  with  individual \ngardens; (ii) two-storey attached terraced houses with individual gardens (town-houses); \nand (iii) as a last resort, condominiums (limited to ground plus 2 or ground plus 3). \nDonors are to construct houses according to UDA guidance and site plans by the National \nHousing Development Authority (NHDA) and UDA. Many site plans, however, are \nallegedly prepared by architects visiting from Colombo with no consultation with users, \nwhich may create problems of insufficient space, and inappropriate design, and not suited \nto local conditions and requirements.  \n \nBy end-August 2005 (according to data released by the THRU) a total number of 36,126 \nhousing units had been assigned to donors through MOUs in 482 different sites (Table 4). \nThere are wide variations in the numbers of total houses damaged and housing units \nallocated to donors for construction \u2013 for example, while Hambantota has already signed \nMOUs for almost as four times as many houses as had been damaged, Ampara had \nsigned for less than half the requirements. Similarly the pace of house building is quite \nuneven. By end-August 2005, a total of 1271 houses had been completed while the \nconstruction  of  another  3,945  was  in  progress;  of  these  990  are  to  be  found  in \nHambantota, while only 31 houses had been completed in Ampara.  \n \n                                                 \n25 THRU MOU for Housing \u2018Donor\u2019 (available from the Urban Development Authority).

By end-August 2005, 13,757 had received the first instalment of Rs. 50,000 \n(US$ 500) for reconstructing fully damaged houses and 20,023 for renovating partly \ndamaged houses (Table 5).

Emerging Issues \nOptimism about the country\u2019s ability to successfully recover from tsunami has been \nbased on the pledges made at the donor meeting in May 2005, which seemed more than \nadequate to meet financing needs. In this context, three questions become important.  \n\u2022  How likely is it that pledges will be fully honoured?  \n\u2022  Can the country effectively utilize such a large amount of foreign assistance?  \n\u2022  Will the external funds be adequate to finance the reconstruction programme, and \nif not, what options are available to raise necessary funds? \n \n7.1 Aid: Pledges and Realization \nThe answer to the first question, going by historical experience of other disaster episodes \nin developing countries is a resounding \u201cNot Very Likely\u201d. For a variety of reasons, \npledges made at the time of major disasters have almost never been fully honoured. 27 As \nBenson  and  Clay  (2004,  p.  60)  point  out,  \u201c\u2026ultimately  disaster-related  external \nassistance may not be additional but instead may displace funding for development.\u201d \nSubstantial gaps emerge between pledged and actual aid disbursement following major \ndisasters despite the best intentions on the part of donors. This can reflect management \nconstraints \u2013 such as procedural difficulties, procurement delays, lack of local counterpart \nfinance, etc, \u2013 and new issues that change the political focus and divert attention. Disaster \nrelated external assistance may also not be entirely additional beyond the initial year of \n                                                 \n27 See, for example, Foreman and Patrick (eds.) (2000). Cuny (1983) for an earlier review of this issue, \nwhich suggests that this is not a new phenomenon. For some of the political economy aspects, see also \nbala-Bertrand, J.M., (1993) The Political Economy of Large Natural Disasters: With Special Reference to \nDeveloping Countries, Oxford, UK; Clarendon Press. \n ", "  33\nimpact. While the immediate response involves some new money, rehabilitation needs \nare often met by switching aid money between uses rather than by increasing total aid to \nthe affected country. Thus, total aid commitments may increase in the year of a major \ndisaster, but they tend to fall back after the crisis to reflect longer-term trends in aid \ninflows. Some of the bilateral aid that comes in is also likely to be \u2018tied\u2019 \u2013 used to buy \nanything from food products, telecommunications, transport and technical advice from \nthe donor country \u2013 estimated to cut the value of aid to recipient countries by 25-40 per \ncent because the donor country is not always the cheapest source of those services.28 \n \nHowever, judging by the extent to which pledges have been turned into commitments by \nmajor donors (multilaterals and governments) the present case may well prove to be an \nexception. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a third of the pledges made at the donor \nmeeting in May 2005 came from non-governmental sources, whose own sources of \nfunding are not always firm. There are already indications of emerging problems. Even \nthough 384 NGOs registered with the Department of Social Services had agreed to \nprovide funds amounting to US$ 1,321 million for rebuilding of assets destroyed by the \nTsunami, instances of failure to sign MOUs have been observed, while even some NGOs \nthat had signed the MOUs had failed to commence work (GOSL, 2005c). In light of the \nfrequency with which disasters \u2013 both natural and man-made \u2013 appear to strike the world \nat present, it seems prudent to prepare for some slippage in this area.  \n \n7.2 Aid Utilization \nAs far as the ability to utilize aid is concerned, Sri Lanka\u2019s past performance raises \nserious concerns. Effective management and utilization of aid can pose difficulties for \ndeveloping countries at the best of times but the problems are compounded many times \nover in the context of a significant inflow of aid following a natural disaster.  \n \nSri Lanka, like many developing countries, has been grappling with problems of under-\nutilization of aid.29 The rate of aid utilization (measured by the disbursement ratio: \ndisbursed  aid  as  a  share  of  cumulated  undisbursed  aid)  indicated  a  relatively  low \nutilization of aid of around 13-15 per cent towards the end of the 1990s (IPS, 2001). By \n2003, there was a gradual improvement in the utilization rate to a more respectable \ndisbursement ratio of around 20-22 per cent, though the cumulative undisbursed balance \n(CUB) has remained stubbornly in the region of US$ 2.5-3 billion (Annex Table A-1). \n \nMany reasons have been cited for the low levels of aid utilisation: political interference \nwith regard to planning, implementation and allocation of funds; staffing and related \nproblems  in  project  management;  implementation  delays  (including  infrastructure \nbottlenecks, complex and costly procurement procedures), and excessive conditionality \nimposed by donors have been viewed as the key constraints (IPS, 2001). Availability of \ncounterpart funds (local funds with appropriation) has also been an important factor. \nEven if budgetary allocations may have been made, cash is sometimes not available when \nneeded.  In  the  case  of  disasters,  several  factors  further  aggravate  the  capacity  for \n                                                 \n28 For example, of 506 vehicles imported for tsunami work, 290 were released to NGOs (GOSL, 2005c).  \n29 Under-utilized aid refers to commitments of aid for a particular period minus disbursements of aid for the \nsame period (in absolute terms). ", "  34\nutilisation of foreign funds. The destruction of infrastructure, disappearance of public \nrecords, the sheer number of donors and programmes can create a complex web of aid \ntransactions that are difficult for both donors and recipients to manage.  \n \nPast failures are of course not necessarily a guide to what may happen in the current \nsituation. But they do provide a warning that, unless there is a concerted effort to meet \ntargets and maintain focus, the potential for domestic slippage is ever present. An interim \nreport by the Auditor General\u2019s Department has found that of US$ 1168 million in aid \ncommitted for the reconstruction of six major sectors, the disbursement as of end July \n2005 stood at US$ 158 million (or a utilization rate of only 13.5 per cent).30 The role of \nTAFREN in overseeing the reconstruction effort, the political imperatives driving the \nprogramme, and strong pressure from donors may assist aid utilization performance and \nenable the country to achieve a much improved performance in utilizing the tsunami aid \neffectively.  \n \n7.3 Adequacy of Funding and Cost Escalation  \nThe funds needed for rebuilding houses and other construction activities, including public \ninfrastructure, were initially estimated  on the basis of costs and prices that prevailed \nimmediately  after  the  tsunami  disaster.  However,  there  is  now  clear  evidence  that \nconstruction costs have been rising rapidly in recent months and materials (such as river \nsand).   \n \nThis is of course not surprising. The scale of construction that is envisaged is several times \nhigher than what is done in a normal year, and dramatically increases demand for labour \nand materials.31 Data obtained in late August from companies and organizations involved \nin house building and IPS field interviews show that total construction costs for the \nplanned houses for tsunami affected families have risen from the estimated Rs 400, 000 \nto  Rs  550,  000  or  more  in  cases,  and  are  continuing  to  increase  (Table  6).  Field \ninterviews indicated that these increases are driven primarily by higher wages for skilled \nlabour (such as carpenters, painters and masons) whose wages have doubled in some \nlocations.  Costs have also increased for particular building materials, but price increases \nfor importable materials have been significantly lower than overall construction cost \nincreases (see Annex Table A-2).  \n \n \n                                                 \n30 GOSL (2005), \u201cInterim Report of the Auditor General on the Rehabilitation of the Losses and Damages \nCaused to Sri Lanka by the Tsunami\u201d, September 2005. \n31 Estimates of the extra demand for house construction vary, but they all indicate a massive increase in \ndemand for scarce construction labour and materials (See TAFREN (2005), \u201cRebuilding Sri Lanka: Post \nTsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation\u201d, June 2005). According to the Chamber of Construction \nIndustry as reported the Daily Mirror, February 21, 2005, it is estimated that at least 100,000 additional \nworkers will be required; this includes about 13,000 masons, 2000 carpenters, 2500 painters and nearly \n54,000 unskilled labourers.

In fact, house building activities are still in their early stages. \nWhat these figures indicate is that if and when construction really picks up on the scale \nenvisaged in the reconstruction phase, house construction cost escalation is likely to rise \neven more sharply. Increases in house construction costs are a useful (if not quite precise) \nindicator of the extent to which other construction costs, including rehabilitation costs of \npublic infrastructure will increase.   \n \nAll groups and organisations undertaking construction activities \u2013 households attempting \nto repair or rebuild houses, donors who have taken on commitments to build houses and \nthe government which faces the task of rebuilding public infrastructure \u2013 must accept the \nreality of these cost increases. Further, the heavy demand for goods and services in the \nconstruction sector will produce \u2018localized\u2019 inflation to begin with, but later this will \ninevitably spread to the rest of the economy leading to more broadly based inflation. \nInflation for the first 8 months of 2005 has risen to 12.7 per cent, significantly above the \ncomparable period in the previous year.32 This raises the question: \n \nHow  much  in  the  way  of  extra  funds  will  be  required  to  meet  the  actual \nreconstruction costs, and where will these funds come from?  \n   \n \n8. Aid, Cost Inflation and \u2018Dutch Disease\u2019:  Effects and Implications \nThe cost increases being observed in the construction industry are obviously due to \nincreased demand for construction inputs as reconstruction activities get under way. Such \nincreases are to be expected irrespective of whether the new construction activities are \nfunded by domestic or foreign sources. However, these cost increases have a major \nbearing on the degree to which the reconstruction effort can be financed by available (or \npledged)  foreign  funds.    Given  the  importance  of  foreign  funds  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nreconstruction effort, we focus first on the link between utilisation of foreign funds and \nconstruction  cost  inflation,  and  then  go  on  to  discuss  the  implications  for  domestic \nfinancing issues. \n                                                 \n32 Monetary authorities have been slow to respond by raising interest rates for fear of further slowing down \nthe growth momentum. The benchmark rates were revised upwards only in November 2004 by 50 basis \npoints. A marginal increase of a further 25 basis points followed in May 2005 and a more appropriate \nupward  adjustment  of  50  basis  points  in  June  2005.  Despite  the  latter  adjustment,  Sri  Lanka  has \nexperienced negative real rates of interest since the second half of 2004. ", "  37\n \nDomestic cost inflation is often observed whenever there is a large inflow of foreign \nfunds. These cost increases lead to reduced profitability in industries that do not gain an \noffsetting  increase  in  their  prices  and  can  adversely  affect  a  country\u2019s  export \nperformance.  This  phenomenon  is  known  as  the  Dutch  Disease,  named  after  the \nNetherlands experienced a contraction of its industries in the wake of large inflows of \nexport revenues after discovery of North Sea Oil in the late 1970s. This is a  common \nphenomenon whereby increased demand in one sector of the economy \u2013 for whatever \nreason  \u2013  leads  to  bidding  up  of  prices  of  production  factors.  33  The  cost  increases \nobserved  in  the  construction  sector  are  a  reflection  of  these  Dutch  Disease  effects \nassociated with absorption of capital inflows into an economy. However, there are some \nunique features associated with this phenomenon in the context of aid flows to finance \nasset  replacement  as  part  of  the  reconstruction  effort.  These  have  important  policy \nimplications.  \n \nIncreases of prices and wages in response to increased demand for construction activities \nare greater the more difficult it is to increase their supply (i.e., when supply is relatively \ninelastic). This, for example, is the reason for the sharp increase in wages of skilled \nconstruction workers such as carpenters, whose skills cannot be easily acquired by others. \nIf those factors can be imported from larger world markets \u2013 some building materials fall \ninto this category \u2013 then their supply tends to be more elastic and resulting price increases \ncan be moderated. But many factors, particularly labour, must be supplied from domestic \nsources (\u2018non-traded\u2019), as for various reasons they cannot be bought from international \nmarkets. (Of course it is possible to import skilled labour from other countries, and it has \nbeen suggested that skilled labour shortages in Sri Lanka\u2019s construction sector should be \nmet by importing Indian labour. Whether this is politically feasible remains to be seen.) It \nis by offering higher rewards \u2013 higher wages, prices \u2013 that a particular sector is able to \nattract extra resources. Because this tends to increase costs for all other sectors that also \nemploy those factors, there is a negative impact on their profitability, and the other \nsectors  contract.  Sometimes  the  higher  incomes  accruing  to  factor  owners  increase \ndemand for certain goods and services, and those industries then experience an off-setting \npositive impact through price increases if their supplies are inelastic \u2013 which is normally \nthe case if they are not internationally traded (\u2018non-traded\u2019). Typically goods that enter \ninternational  trade  do  not  experience  offsetting  price  increases  because  they  can  be \nimported at more or less exogenously fixed world prices and are the hardest hit. This fall \nin the relative profitability of tradeable industries is the standard \u2018real exchange rate \nappreciation\u2019 that is a necessary and unavoidable outcome of foreign capital absorption \nby the domestic economy. This can be minimized in the short-term through foreign \nexchange market interventions, but cannot be entirely avoided. \n \n                                                 \n33 In general, when countries get large capital inflows, they tend to experience Dutch Disease effects to \nvarying degrees because some sectors and industries tend to have their profitability increase as well as \nspending effects raise prices for their outputs, while others experience only the resulting cost increases. (see \nCorden and Neary, 1982, and Corden, 1984 for expositions of the basic analytical model.) \n ", "  38\nThe rapid (\u2018localised\u2019) inflation of domestic costs (at a rate higher than average inflation \nin the economy) will spill over into the rest of the economy, as aid flows increase \nexpenditure on local non-tradeable factors. In principle, this is an unavoidable outcome of \nextra spending financed by foreign funds. However, there are several distinctive aspects \nof this phenomenon in the context of foreign aid funded capital asset replacement that are \nnot  adequately  discussed  in  the  standard  analytical  literature  (see,  for  example,  the \nreviews in Freeman, Keen and Mani (2003), and Benson and Clay (2004)).. \n \nRehabilitation or replacement of capital assets destroyed by the tsunami will yield real \nincome benefits once they are in place i.e. benefits come in the future. However, as \ndemonstrated in the case of the housing sector, replacement of the capital asset requires \nuse of not only importable materials but also domestic production factors. If all factors \nare internationally \u2018tradeable\u2019, and can be imported at fixed world prices, extra demand \nfor factors will not lead to any price or cost increases. However, this is not generally the \ncase, and certainly not the case with construction. Because the supply of some non-\ntradeable factors, such as skilled labour, is quite inelastic in the short run, their prices \nincrease as demand increases. Clearly, the more rapid is the pace of construction activity \n(whether financed by foreign or domestic sources) the greater will be the price and cost \nincreases because supply of non-tradeable factors is lower in the short run than the long \nrun. In the case of skilled workers, for example, firstly, they can offer a larger labour \nsupply over a longer time period and secondly,  it is possible for other workers to acquire \nskills thus expanding the total stock of skilled labour.  \n \nFrom a national viewpoint, higher incomes that accrue to inelastically supplied factors \nsuch as skilled labour can be seen as an income redistribution whereby part of the aid \nfunds raise their incomes at the expense of tsunami affected capital asset replacement. \nThus it is not surprising that post-tsunami reconstruction is generating something of a \nbonanza for some groups in the community. In the longer term higher expenditures by \nhouseholds  that  gain  these  higher  incomes  will  tend  to  raise  costs  throughout  the \neconomy, thereby tending to squeeze profits in export and import competing industries. \nOn the other hand, the availability of services from reconstructed infrastructure and other \nassets has an offsetting impact in the future on costs, facilitating increased supplies. Thus \ninvestment in the domestic capital stock tends to produce an initial real exchange rate \nappreciation but this is followed by improved international competitiveness once the \ncapital assets begin to provide services used in the tradeable industries.  \n \nWhat do these imply for capital asset replacement with foreign assistance? \n \n8.1 Exchange Rate and Capital Asset Replacement \nSuppose for simplicity that the tradeable (imported) amount of inputs and domestic (non-\ntradeable) inputs are required in fixed proportions for asset replacement. For given world \nprices of imported imports, a unit of foreign currency will buy a fixed quantity of \nimported inputs, irrespective of the exchange rate of the recipient country.34 But the \namount of domestic non-tradeable inputs that a unit of foreign currency can purchase \n                                                 \n34 The assumption is that the recipient country is a \u2018small\u2019 country in world markets, so its international \ntransactions do not have a significant impact on world market prices. ", "  39\ndepends on the nominal exchange rate and the domestic currency price of those domestic \ninputs.  \n \nIf the nominal exchange rate is fixed, this implies that the amount of capital assets that \ncan be replaced for a given unit of foreign assistance is lower, the higher the domestic \ncost increase. If the capital inflow produces an appreciation of the nominal exchange \nrate, this effect is aggravated because less domestic inputs can then be bought with a unit \nof foreign currency.  \n \nObviously the country\u2019s exchange rate policy becomes important here. In particular, a \npolicy of propping up the nominal exchange rate by \u2018leaning against the wind\u2019 in foreign \nexchange  markets  makes  it  much  harder  to  fund  rehabilitation/reconstruction \nprogrammes with a given amount of foreign assistance. On the other hand, domestic price \nand cost inflation can be mitigated by trade liberalisation, which tends to reduce costs of \ntradeable goods and imported intermediate goods \n \nIf replacement of capital assets is staggered over time, demand increases in a given time \nperiod  are  lower,  factor  supplies  become  more  elastic,  and  cost  increases  will  be \ncorrespondingly lower. More domestic capital assets can now be replaced for a given \namount of foreign funds. However, a slower pace of capital replacement imposes costs \nbecause it delays the generation of the flow of services from the capital asset. Ideally a \nbalance must be struck between the high costs associated with faster pace of capital asset \nreplacement, and the losses due to loss of services resulting from delayed replacement, \nand a programme of reconstruction must be formulated that takes into consideration the \ndifferent  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  different  rehabilitation  projects,  so  that \npriorities can be established on an economically sound basis. However, an important \nconsideration in relation to projects funded with foreign assistance is that, unless the \nfunds are obtained and used quickly, they may simply disappear as donors\u2019 priorities \nchange. Further, even in domestic political economy terms, delays in reconstruction may \nlead to priorities being set in a manner that is prejudicial to the interests of the needs of \nthe worst affected groups. In other words, the costs of delay in reconstruction may fall \nlargely on the poor and politically weak groups. This issue is particularly important \nbecause, as discussed below, a financing gap is emerging which may result in a rationing \nof available funds.  \n \n \n8.2 Financing the Emerging Funding Gap \nThe immediate issue for the reconstruction effort in Sri Lanka relates to the capacity of \nhouseholds and the government to meet capital asset replacement targets with a given \namount of foreign assistance. For households hit by the tsunami, particularly poorer \nhouseholds, cost increases make the task of reconstruction much more difficult. Given \n30-40 per cent plus cost inflation, the fixed cash grant of Rs 250,000 ($2,500) for a fully \ndamaged house, for example, is woefully inadequate. As cost increases escalate the real \nvalue of subsequent instalments will fall even more. When this same scenario is extended \nto  the  reconstruction  programme  for  public  infrastructure,  a  funding  gap  will  be \ninevitable.  ", "  40\n \nHow will this funding gap be addressed? More affluent households with access to savings \nand/or relatively cheap credit will draw down their savings or cut back on consumption to \nfinance  the  necessary  additional  expenditure.  Note,  however,  that  this  represents \ndomestic household financing of asset replacement, at the expense of other types of \nexpenditure.  In  other  words,  a  substantial  (and  increasing)  part  of  the  burden  of \nrehabilitation will be borne by the affected households themselves. This suggests that \nthere will be a depletion of accumulated household savings \u2013 in effect allowing some \nsubstitution to take place between consumption spending and savings. Sri Lanka may \ntherefore see a reduction in the savings rate which has remained virtually stagnant at \naround 16 per cent of GDP in recent years. \n \nThe situation will be much more difficult for the poorer households who lack both \nsavings, access to cheap credit (and capacity to repay). We have already mentioned the \noptimism expressed by the World Bank about the rebuilding programme progress in this \nsector. According to field studies by the IPS, a significant number of poorer tsunami \naffected households had already spent the first instalment of the grant (Rs 50,000 - $500) \non  pressing  immediate  needs,  including  payment  of  outstanding  loans.  They  would \nstruggle to make much progress with the construction tasks that need to be completed to \nbecome eligible for the next instalment. In the context of rapidly increasing costs, these \npoorer households will find it extremely hard to rehabilitate their damaged houses and \nother assets without substantial additional assistance.  \n \nIn the case of public infrastructure spending, a similar story can be told. It should be \nrecalled  that  the  bulk  of  reconstruction  funds  are  expected  to  come  from  external \nassistance.  If  foreign  donors  (including  NGOs)  have  made  commitments  to  rebuild \nspecific infrastructure assets, then they will need to find extra funding if they were to \nhonour those commitments. If \u2013 as is likely \u2013 such commitments are more or less fixed in \nforeign currency terms, what can be financed with them will fall, leaving gaps to be filled \nby the government from other sources. It would be highly optimistic to expect that \nsignificant extra donor assistance will be forthcoming in the future as global donor \nattention shifts to other disasters and other issues. The conclusion that there will be \nadditional demands on the government for rehabilitation funding appears compelling. \n \n8.3 Fiscal and Monetary Policy \nThis raises sharply the issue of the ability of the government to meet these new funding \nrequirements. Fiscal targets set for 2005 have been already revised following the tsunami \ndisaster  to  take  account  of  a  significant  level  of  additional  expenditures  (Table  7). \nAccording to the revised estimates, capital expenditure is expected to see a significant \nincrease, raising the overall deficit to 9.6 per cent of GDP from the pre-tsunami target of \n7.6  per  cent.  While  the  Ministry  of  Finance  has  maintained  that  the  post-tsunami \nreconstruction will be \u2018budget neutral\u2019 as much of the funding requirement is expected to \nbe met by donor commitments, the reality is likely to be quite different if initial estimates \ndid not factor in this cost escalation. If a shortfall should arise, the government will have \nquite limited options, particularly in the context of pressure on the fiscal balance due to \nthe election cycle expenses and the rising costs of the fuel subsidy.  ", "  41\n \nThe above discussion on the link between the exchange rate and the ability to finance \nrehabilitation projects with foreign funds also pin points some implications for exchange \nrate policy. Obviously the inflow of foreign funds \u2013 both private remittances and donor \nfunding - and debt relief has allowed maintenance of healthy foreign exchange reserves, \ndespite the soaring oil price and a ballooning oil import bill that has widened the trade \ndeficit. In turn this permits monetary authorities greater room to exercise influence in \nforeign exchange markets.  \n \nTable 7:  Selected Indicators of Public Finance \n \nAs % of GDP  2004a  2004  2005a  2005b \nRevenue  16.4 15.4 17.1 16.9 \nCurrent expenditure   17.6 19.2 18.4 18.5 \nCapital expenditure  5.5 4.3 6.2 8.0 \nTotal expenditure   23.2 23.5 24.6 26.5 \n   \nCurrent a/c balance  -1.3 -3.9 -1.3 -1.6 \nOverall balance  -6.8 -8.2 -7.6 -9.6 \n   \nDomestic borrowing  3.2 5.8 4.6 3.6 \nForeign financec   3.0 2.2 2.5  \n \nNotes: a.

Cost inflation in \nthe  construction  sector  is  yet  to  spill  over fully into other sectors of the economy, \nincluding the export (and more generally other tradeable) sectors. In this sense, the sector \nspecific real exchange rate relevant to the construction sector has appreciated much more \nthan that for the entire economy. Hence the immediate pressures on the export sectors \nemanating directly from the tsunami reconstruction activities are not as pressing today as \nthey will be sometime later in the future. On the other hand, independently of the tsunami \nexpenditures, other factors such as high oil prices and projected increases in government \nexpenditures aggravate external sector imbalances.  \n \nThough the Central Bank had to intervene in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami to \nminimize appreciation of the currency, this situation did not last. In recent months there \nhave been significant downward pressures on the rupee in foreign currency markets. The \ntemptation to slow down tsunami expenditures and use available foreign reserves to prop \nup the currency is certainly present. The IMF recently warned about the dangers of \nintervening in foreign exchange markets to prevent rupee depreciations, and it is difficult \nto assume that the observed stability of the Rs/US$ rate is driven entirely by market ", "  42\nforces.35 At some stage the monetary authorities will be compelled to face up to the \nimplications  of  current  exchange  rate  policies  for  the  long  term  post-tsunami \nrehabilitation issues. \n \nThe bottom line is that inability to fully fund rehabilitation of assets will mean that Sri \nLanka ends up with an inferior capital stock compared with the pre-tsunami situation. If \nfunds  are  not  diverted  from  consumption  expenditures,  the  country\u2019s  immediate \nmacroeconomic imbalances maybe sorted out by meeting current consumption needs at \nthe expense of capital stock replacement, but this will be at the expense of its longer-term \ngrowth prospects.     \n  \n9. Some Lessons and Recommendations  \nOur review of Sri Lanka\u2019s experience with the tsunami and its aftermath has highlighted \nseveral short term as well as longer term issues that need to be addressed by policy \nmakers. Some aspects of the Sri Lankan experience also hold lessons of wider relevance \nfor  governments  and  donor  agencies  in  developing  counties  grappling  with  similar \nproblems.  In  this  section,  we  present  a  series  of  conclusions  and  recommendations \nrelating to the following issues: \n1.  Livelihood related cash payments to households \n2.  Assistance for rebuilding houses \n3.  Titles to new houses \n4.  Buffer zone rules \n5.  Early warning systems and disaster management sytems \n6.  Coordination of donor assisted activities \n7.  Macroeconomic policy issues \n \n9.1 Review Livelihood-related Cash Grants for Tsunami Affected Households \nThe scaling back of the Rs 5,000 ($50) grant for affected households and the new \neligibility  rules  for  grant  entitlement  appears  to  be  both  inequitable  and \ncounterproductive in terms of encouraging affected households to re-engage in income \nearning activities. It must be emphasised that Rs 5000 for a household is a quite modest \namount even by Sri Lankan standards. must be seen in the context of Sri Lanka\u2019s poverty \nline, which was Rs 1526 per capita per month in May 2004. The scale of the disaster, the \nextent  of  price  inflation,  the  many  costs  associated  with  narrow  targeting,  and  the \nperverse incentives set up by the new rules justify the provision of the grant for all \naffected households for at least four months and preferably six months as many had \nanticipated earlier. A continuation of this grant would go someway towards easing the \nhardships faced by affected households, and also provide a transparent and simple way of \ndisbursing donor funds to all tsunami affected households. \n \n9.2 Review Cash Grants for House Repairs/Rebuilding \nThe cost escalation in house construction documented above  makes it obvious that the \namount  of  assistance  provided  to  tsunami-affected  families  for  house  repairs  and \n                                                 \n35 In Sri Lanka authorities can intervene in foreign exchange markets not only directly through Central \nBank transactions, but also using the resources of  the two state owned commercial banks which dominate \nthe commercial banking sector.  ", "  43\nrebuilding is quite inadequate and will rapidly erode further in real terms. While there is \nan  argument  for  not  providing  full  costs  so  that  households  have  to  make  some \ncontribution towards house repairs and rebuilding, the poorest households (outside the \nbuffer zone) who are not eligible for new housing will find it extremely difficult to \nrebuild their houses without getting deeply into debt, thus aggravating their present \nplight, immersing them in a long term debt-poverty trap and aggravating social tensions. \nAgain, though this too will also obviously increase the fiscal burden on the government, a \nreview and upward revision of the cash grant amount should be seen as a priority issue.  \n \n9.3 Selection of Housing Beneficiaries and Titles to New Houses \nThe selection of beneficiaries for housing grants has caused dissatisfaction in some \nplaces.  The  process  can  be  improved  by  improving  transparency.  Lists  should  be \nprepared by the government in consultation with donors, displayed in public places and \npeople should be allowed to appeal. \n \nA survey by the IPS (IPS, 2005) showed that households expecting new houses were \nunclear about their titles. Clearly, a decision is needed soon. The title may be awarded to \nthe male head of households under the existing State Lands Act. Restrictions on sale of \nthe house outside the family are also likely, as has been the case with state land (and \nhouse) allocations to settlers in irrigation settlement schemes. Restrictions of this nature \nin land markets, though well intentioned, have serious drawbacks highlighted by the \nresulting land use inefficiencies (and the numerous illegal land transactions that are \nknown to occur in practice). If restrictions were to be imposed to minimise the possibility \nthat undesirable distress sales in the immediate future may occur, such restrictions should \nnevertheless be of relatively short duration, and transfers outside the family after, say, at \nmost 10 years should be permitted.   \n \nWe believe that the case of title transfers also gives an opportunity to implement gender \nequality in state transfers. When houses are allocated, clear titles should be granted \njointly to the husband and wife unless it is a single parent family even though this may \nrequire changes to existing legislation.  Joint title held by both spouses is likely to be a \ndeterrent  to  land  sales  arising  from  debts  associated  with  gambling  and  excessive \ndrinking by the household head.  \n \n9.4 Buffer Zone Rules \nThe concept of buffer zones to achieve coastal environmental protection and minimize \nimpact of future natural hazards in future has intrinsic merit. However, as demonstrated \nby the failed attempt to implement a rigid and somewhat discriminatory system, the set of \nrelated issues needs to be more carefully examined and thought out for a comprehensive \nsystem to be developed. Both from a conservation and public safety point of view, a \ncomplete abandonment of the approach is not desirable. Further, it will create confusion \nfor the programme of alternative house building currently in progress. \n \nIn any case, the process of setting out a new strategy, including the specification of \nBuffer Zone limits should be a transparent and consultative process that clarifies the \nunderlying scientific and economic rationale for particular measures.  In formulating an ", "  44\neffective  coastal  management  strategy,  the  potential  for  combining  regulations  with \nincentive-based  systems  for  achieving  the  hoped  for  environmental  and  hazard \nmanagement  objectives  should  be  explored  to  avoid  over  reliance  on  regulatory \nrestrictions alone, which are often difficult and costly to enforce. There is considerable \ninternational experience that demonstrates the greater effectiveness of approaches which \nutilise both regulations and community-based incentive approaches. Even in Sri Lanka, \ncoral protection, for example, appears to have been most effective in locations where the \nlocal  tourist  industry  had  an  interest  in  its  protection,  and  tsunami  damage  was \ncorrespondingly lower.  \n \n9.5 Early Warning Systems and Disaster Management Systems \nThe tsunami, unexpected as it was, dramatically exposed the absence of an adequate \nwarning system, and appropriate civic and administrative mechanisms to cope with a \nnatural disaster in Sri Lanka. In this sense the tsunami has been a wake up call to the \ncountry. International experience has shown that the value of investing in natural disaster \ninformation  and  management  systems.  36  Since  then  there  has  been  considerable \ndiscussion about the nature of the risks faced by Sri Lanka and the kind of early warning \nsystem and related disaster management systems. Though the recent historical record \nindicates that there have been no recent major disasters of this type, there are several \nfactors that suggest that risks of natural disasters in Sri Lanka be increasing.37 This is to \nbe expected in the context of global evidence which suggests that \u201c \u2026 as a result of both \nclimate change and increasing concentration of the world\u2019s population in vulnerable areas \n\u2013 natural disasters will become more frequent, more intense and more costly in the \ncoming years\u201d (Freeman, Keen and Mani, 2003: p. 3). \n \nOf particular relevance to Sri Lanka is the scientific consensus that is emerging that the \ngeographic region in which Sri Lanka is situated can expect increasing seismic activities \nas a result of the fracturing of the tectonic plate on which the country is located. Though \nSri Lanka is not in close proximity to any of the 12 or 13 main plate boundaries that are \nprone to earthquakes, it rests on a plate that extended from Australia to India. This \nappears to be cracking up opening a fissure between the \"Australian\" and \"Indian\" plates. \nSome scientists believe that this is leading to a new plate boundary across the Southern \nIndian Ocean.38 The earthquake that hit Pakistan and parts of India in October 2005 \nserves  as  a  grim  warning  of  the  potentially  catastrophic  consequences  of  major \nearthquakes (which may also unleash tsunamis closer to the Sri Lanka, this time on the \nmore heavily populated Western side of the country). Sri Lankan scientists have also \nbeen warning about the potential for serious earthquakes, and increased seismic activity \nwere recorded in the days leading up to the tsunami. This coupled with the possibility that \nglobal warming related changes may increase the potential for cyclonic activities suggest \nthat there is a case for placing greater emphasis on the need for preparedness to cope with \nnatural disaster. Risks also emanate from the presence of several large dams that are \nvulnerable to earthquakes and movements. \n \n                                                 \n36 See Benson and Clay (2004) \n \n38 http://www.recoverlanka.net/background/hazards.html  ", "  45\nIn this context, what is needed is not a single tsunami focused warning system \u2013 based on \na single low probability event \u2013 but one that is geared to coping with the multiple \nhazards.  A  developing  country  with  severe  financial  constraints  cannot  afford  a \nmultiplicity of specialised warning systems. With international assistance, steps have \nbeen taken to link Sri Lanka to regional disaster warning systems. Although the Sri \nLanka Disaster Management Act (presented to Parliament in February, 2005) makes a \nuseful start, the preparation of a comprehensive disaster management system for the \ncountry that is scientifically sound and financially feasible remains to be formulated. 39  \n \nThere are other longer term issues that need to be explored, such as the how a developing \ncountry like Sri Lanka can prepare itself to meet the financing issues arising from low \nprobability catastrophic risks, and the benefits and costs of different options such as \npurchasing such insurance in global insurance markets versus setting aside reserves to \nmeet such needs. It has been noted that countries tend to be \u2018reluctant to divert resources \ntowards mitigation measures and the purchase of insurance, especially if the event is of \nsufficiently low probability that the consequences of under-preparation are likely to be \nborne by a subsequent government\u201d. 40  \n  \n9.5 Aid Coordination  \nPoor  coordination  across  the  many  agencies  and  groups  involved  in  the  tsunami \nassistance effort has emerged as a serious constraint in the post-tsunami environment. \nSince the tsunami, slow decision-making processes have been criticized for keeping aid \nfrom those who need it while poor coordination has reduced the effectiveness of some of \nthe assistance. The setting up of TAFREN as a single coordinating agency is a welcome \nstep, but concerns about its composition, links to line agencies, and overall effectiveness \nmust be evaluated and lesson drawn. \n \nThe  reluctance  to  engage  with  government  administrative  structures  by  certain \ninternational NGOs (and their \u2018competitive\u2019 behaviour in relation to local NGOS) has \nalso been a major problem in Sri Lanka hampering coordination.  \n \nThe mechanism for aid disbursement has run into further controversy in the context of the \nconflict  affected  North  and  East  of  the  country.  Balancing  political  realities  and \nhumanitarian concerns is a difficult but unavoidable task. The failures in Sri Lanka \nhighlight the both the need for international facilitation and assistance as well as their \ninherent limitations. These are not issues confined to Sri Lanka alone but should be taken \nup by donors and NGOS. They emphasise the need to re-examine the modalities of aid \n                                                 \n39  A  detailed  discussion  of  the  requirements  of  an  early  warning  system  co-authored  by  Rohan \nSamarajeewa and Malathy Knight-John (IPS) is available on  \nhttp://www.lirneasia.net/wp-content/PresComm15Mar05.pdf. \n40 Freeman, Keen and Mani (2003: p.24). They go on to point out that this reluctance will be stronger if \ndonor\u2019s are expected to bear part of the costs if a disaster does occur. There is a large and growing literature \non economic issues related to managing disaster risk, following the seminal contribution of Dacy and \nKunreuther. (1969). See also Kunreuther and Roth Sr. (1998). Some of the literature relevant to  developing \ncountries is reviewed and discussed in Freeman, Paul K., Michael Keen and Muthukumara Mani (2003) \nand Benson and Clay (2004). \n ", "  46\nspending,  including  procedures  and  mechanisms,  so  that  assistance  can  be  provided \nquickly in response to disasters. \n \n9.6  Transparency and Accountability in Aid Disbursement \nTransparency  and  accountability  in  aid  disbursement  are  obviously  desirable  but  in \npractice not an easy task. In the immediate relief phase of a natural disaster, humanitarian \nassistance inevitably takes precedence over formal aid accountability mechanisms. This \ncan open avenues for various forms of corruption. The significant lapses in the clearance \nof relief goods, management of aid goods received, management of funds, payment of \ncash  allowances,  etc.,  highlighted  in  the  interim  report  by  the  Auditor  General\u2019s \nDepartment  must  be  urgently  addressed  and  those  responsible  for  deliberate \nmismanagement made accountable (GOSL, 2005c).   \n \nDonor governments, as well as some international agencies, are influenced by the view \nthat developing country governments are too corrupt and/or inefficient to be trusted to \ndistribute aid funds effectively. This leads to a search for more efficient means of aid \ndelivery, and NGOs have been often favoured. It is not clear that this is necessarily a \nmore efficient delivery path in all developing countries. The extent to which domestic \ncorruption may lead to leakages must be weighed against the high overheads of INGOs, \nand the fact they are not always in touch with the ground realities. Further, with financial \nbacking from large donors, INGOs who are tempted to act overly independently of local \ngovernment  administrative  systems  can  complicate  the  already  difficult  task  of \ncoordination of complex relief and reconstruction efforts. At times this can lead to severe \ntensions  between  INGOs  and  local  organisations.  It  should  be  recognised  that  local \ngovernment institutions, despite their real and perceived inadequacies, often can and do \nplay  a  positive  role  in  disaster  situations.  A  balanced  approach  that  recognises  the \nsignificant  differences  among  developing  country  local  government  institutions  is \nneeded. Attempts to totally by pass them based on a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 attitude can be \ncounterproductive in many circumstances.   \n \n9.7  Macroeconomic Policies \nMacroeconomic management in the post-tsunami environment is going to be critical to \nthe effectiveness of medium-term recovery of the Sri Lankan economy. Ironically, the \ntsunami itself provided a measure of stability to an economy that had been straining \nunder growing macroeconomic imbalances, most visibly by averting a growing currency \ncrisis by providing an unanticipated source of foreign capital inflows for the relief and \nreconstruction effort.  \n \nHowever, several critical issues are posed. First, cost blowouts will almost certainly \ncreate funding gaps, make reconstruction tasks difficult and impose further strains on \ngovernment fiscal expenditures. Second, the tsunami reconstruction process it self places \nfurther strains on existing macroeconomic imbalances, and raises the costs of policy \nerrors. Third, the success of the reconstruction effort cannot be divorced from the overall \nmacroeconomic circumstances and policies.  \n ", "  47\nWe  note  in  particular  that  inflationary  pressures  arising  from  policies  unrelated  to \ntsunami reconstruction will adversely impact the reconstruction effort both by reducing \nthe  real  value  of  donor  contributions  and  by  reducing  the  fiscal  capacity  of  the \ngovernment  to  meet  required  funding  gaps.  Given  the  understandable  community \nsensitivity  to  rising  inflation,  there  are  political  imperatives  to  resist  exchange  rate \ndepreciation.  If,  as  discussed  earlier,  external  sector  developments  exert  downward \npressure on the exchange rate, there is likely to be increasing temptation to use currency \nreserves to maintain the nominal exchange rate to control inflation in the short term. This \nwould imply postponement of reconstruction activities for which the foreign funds were \nprovided  in  the  first  place.    Such  policies  will  this  will  not  only  aggravate  other \nimbalances but be costly for the reconstruction effort. As attention shifts over time from \nthe tsunami victims, the poorest households in particular are likely to be losers from such \ndelays. Tsunami reconstruction should remain a fundamental high priority issue both \nfrom  a  growth  and  equity  point  of  view.  Tsunami  funds  should  be  utilised  for  the \npurposes for which they were intended, and wider macroeconomic imbalances should be \naddressed by targeting their direct sources.  \n \nWe hope that our discussion and suggestions made in this report will make a useful \ncontribution to the policy formulation process and assist the country to recover from its \ntsunami inflicted damage and moves on to a path of sustainable and equitable growth \npath.
