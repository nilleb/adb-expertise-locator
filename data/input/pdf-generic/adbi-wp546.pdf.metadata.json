INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  \n\nMore  than  40  years  have  passed  since  the  first  oil  price  shock  of  1973.  During  this  period, \nglobal  demand  for  oil  has  risen  drastically,  while  at  the  same  time,  new  energy-related \ntechnologies  and  new  energy  resources  have  made  global  consumers  more  resistant  to  oil \nshocks.  Since  the  oil  shocks  of  the  1970s,  emerging  economies  have  come  to  play  a  much \nlarger  role  in  global  energy  consumption.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  (PRC)  share,  for \nexample,  is  5  times  larger  than  it  was  in  the  1970s. On the  other  hand,  the  shares  of the two \nlargest  developed  oil  consumers,  the  US  and  Japan,  decreased  from  about  32%  and  10%  to \n21% and 5%, respectively.  \n\nFollowing the oil crises of the 1970s and the economic recessions that followed, several studies \nhave found that oil price shocks played a significant role in economic downturns. In recent years, \nboth the sharp increase in oil prices that began in 2001 and the sharp decline that followed in \n2008 following the subprime mortgage crisis have renewed interest in the effects of oil prices on \nthe  Macroeconomy.  Following  the financial  crisis  of  2007\u20132008,  crude  oil  prices  dropped from \n$133.11  in  July  2008  to  below  $42.01  in  December  2008,  due  to  decreased  global  demand. \nShortly after this drop, however, they started to rise sharply again. \n\nIn this research we will assess and compare the impact of oil price fluctuations on the following \nmacroeconomic  factors:  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate  and  consumer  price \nindex  (CPI)  inflation.  We  look  at  these  factors  in  the  three  largest  crude  oil  consumers:  the \nUnited  States  (US)  and Japan  (developed  economies),  and the  PRC (an  emerging  economy). \nWe will answer the question of whether these economies are still elastic to oil price movements, \nor  whether  new,  energy-related  technologies  and  resources,  like  renewables  and  shale  gas, \nhave  completely  sheltered  them  from  shocks.  If  they  are  still  elastic,  are  emerging  and \ndeveloped economies influenced to the same degree? \n\nReviewing the literature of oil prices since 1970s until now, several studies have assessed the \nimpacts of oil prices on various economic variables. \n\nBlanchard  and  Gali  (2007)  characterized  the  macroeconomic  performance  of  a  set  of \nindustrialized  economies  in  the  aftermath  of  the  oil  price  shocks  of  the  1970s  and  of  the  last \ndecade, using a six-variable vector autoregression (VAR) model. They found a significant role of \noil prices in the economic downturns. The variables used in their survey were the nominal price \nof  oil  (in  US  dollars),  three  inflation  measures  (CPI,  GDP  deflator,  and  wages)  and  two \nquantities  (GDP  and  employment).  Kilian  (2008a)  addressed  a  numbers  of  issues,  including \nhow  energy  price  shocks  affect  US  real  output,  inflation,  and  stock  prices. The  variables  used \nwere the nominal oil price, real oil price, and GDP. The study found that it is critical to account \nfor  the  endogeneity  of  energy  prices  and  to  differentiate  between  the  effects  of  demand  and \nsupply shocks in energy markets. Levent and Acar (2011) analyzed the economic effects of oil \nprice  shocks  for  Turkey  as  a  small,  open  oil-  and  gas-importing  country.  They  analyzed  the \npotential long-term effects of oil price shocks on macroeconomic variables of interest\u2014including \nGDP, consumer price inflation, indirect tax revenue, the trade balance, and carbon emissions\u2014\nusing  a  dynamic,  multi-sectoral  general  equilibrium  model  for  the  Turkish  economy.  Their \nsimulation results showed that oil prices have significant effects on macro indicators. In a more \nrecent  study,  Taghizadeh-Hesary  et  al.  (2013)  evaluated  the  impact  of  oil  price  shocks  on  oil \nproducing  and  consuming  economies;  the  study  used  a  simultaneous  equation  framework  for \ndifferent  countries  with  business  relations.  As  expected,  the  results  showed  that  oil  producers \n(Iran and the Russian Federation) benefit from oil price shocks. For oil-consuming economies, \nthe effects are more diverse. In some countries, output falls in response to an oil price shock, \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nwhile others seem to be relatively immune. Variables used in the survey were GDP, trade share, \nand oil prices. \n\nHowever,  the  advantage  of  our  survey  compared  with  the  aforementioned  papers  and  other \nresearch  that  has  been  done  in  the  field  of  oil  prices  is  that  we  include  monetary  variables \n(money  supply  and  exchange  rate).  Monetary  policy  has  a  significant  impact  on  inflating  the \nprice of oil and other commodities (see, inter alia, Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino [2014, 2015] \nand Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary [2014a]). On the other hand, monetary policy has a crucial \nrole in general price determination and on economic growth movement (e.g., Sims [1980, 1992]; \nRomer and Romer [1989]; Yoshino et al. [2014]; and Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary [2015]). \nBernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) argue that much of the decline in output and employment \nin the US was due to the rise in interest rates. Hence, due to the above reasons it is essential to \ninclude monetary variables (money supply and the exchange rate) in our survey. \n\nOur  analysis  shows  that  the  impact  of  oil  price  movements  on  developed  oil  importers\u2019  GDP \ngrowth  is  much milder  than  on  the GDP growth  of  an  emerging  economy.  On the  other  hand, \nthe impact of oil price fluctuations on the PRC\u2019s inflation rate was found to be milder than in the \ntwo developed countries. \n\nThis paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present an overview of oil and energy \nin the PRC, Japan, and the US. In the third section we provide theoretical framework including: \nthe relationship between energy prices and economic growth, the relationship between energy \nprices and general price levels, and the impact of higher energy prices on supply and demand in \nthe economy.  Our model is explained in the fourth section, and in the fifth section we describe \nour empirical analysis. The sixth section concludes the paper. \n\n2.  OVERVIEW OF OIL AND ENERGY IN THE PRC, JAPAN, \n\nAND THE US  \n\n2.1  People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nThe PRC has quickly risen to the top ranks in global energy demand over the past few years. It \nis the world\u2019s second largest oil consumer behind the US and became the largest global energy \nconsumer  in  2010. The economy  was  a  net  oil exporter  until the  early  1990s  and  became  the \nworld\u2019s second-largest net importer of crude oil and petroleum products in 2009. The PRC\u2019s oil \nconsumption growth accounted for one-third of the world\u2019s oil consumption growth in 2013 (EIA \n2014a). Natural gas use in the PRC has also increased rapidly in recent years, and the country \nhas sought to raise natural gas imports via pipelines and the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG). \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s top coal producer, consumer, and importer, and accounts for about half \nof  global  coal  consumption\u2014an  important  factor  in  world  energy-related  carbon  dioxide \nemissions. The PRC\u2019s rising coal production is the key driver behind the economy becoming the \nworld\u2019s  largest  energy  producer  in  2007.  Coal  supplied  the  vast  majority  (69%)  of  the  PRC\u2019s \ntotal  energy  consumption  in  2011.  Oil  was  the  second-largest  source,  accounting  for  18%  of \ntotal  energy  consumption.  While  the  PRC  has  made  efforts  to  diversify  its  energy  supplies, \nhydropower sources (6%), natural gas (4%), nuclear power (nearly 1%), and other renewables \n(1%) account for small shares of energy consumption (Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nFigure 1: Total Energy Consumption in the PRC by Type, 2011 \n\n \n\n \nNote: Percentages may not total 100% because of rounding. \n\nSource:  Energy  Information  Administration.  International  Energy  Statistics.  Washington,  DC:  United  States  Energy \nInformation Administration. \n\nAccording to  a  project carried  out  by the  Institute  of  Energy  Economics of Japan  (IEEJ  2013), \nthe PRC\u2019s oil consumption will almost double over the next 30 years, reaching 866 million tons \nof oil equivalent1 (Mtoe) by 2040. During this period, the PRC will replace the US as the world\u2019s \nlargest  oil  consumer.  Driving  the  increase  will  be  the  transportation  sector,  including  road \ntransportation.  With  the  potential  to  expand  the  vehicle  market  from  its  current  7%  vehicle \nownership  rate,  the  number  of  vehicles  in  the  PRC  is  expected  to  increase  to  360  million  in \n2040, meaning that the transportation sector will double its oil consumption. The country\u2019s share \nof  global  gasoline  consumption  is  also  expected  to  expand  from  its  current  8%  to  18%, \nexceeding  its  share  of  the  global  population. This  projection  continues  by  saying  that  by  2040 \nthe  PRC  will  have  the  world\u2019s  largest  nuclear  power  generation  capacity,  and  will  account  for \nhalf of the increase in global nuclear generation capacity between 2011 and 2040. Renewable \nenergy will account for 9.7% of the country\u2019s primary energy consumption in 2040 (Taghizadeh-\nHesary, Yoshino, and Assari-Arani 2015). \n\n2.1.1  Oil Consumption in the PRC \n\nAs  of  January  2014,  the  PRC  held  24.4  billion  barrels  of  proven  oil  reserves,  up  by  over  0.7 \nbillion barrels from the 2013 level and the highest in the Asia and the Pacific region. The PRC\u2019s \ntotal oil and liquids production, the fourth largest in the world, has risen by about 54% over the \npast 2 decades and serves only its domestic market (EIA 2014a). However, production growth \nhas  not  kept  pace  with  demand  growth  during  this  period.  In  2013,  the  country  produced  an \nestimated 4.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of total oil liquids, of which 93% was crude oil. The \nEIA forecasts oil production to rise to about 4.6 million bbl/d by the end of 2014. Over the longer \nterm,  the  EIA  projects  a  steady  growth  for  the  PRC\u2019s  oil  and  liquids  production,  to  4.6  million \n\n                                                \n1 Equal to about 6,186 million barrels of oil equivalent. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nbbl/d in 2020 and 5.6 million bbl/d by 2040. Most of the growth over the long term is from non-\npetroleum  liquids  such  as  gas-to-liquids,  coal-to-liquids,  kerogen,  and  biofuels,  as  crude  oil \nproduction  remains  relatively  flat.  Oil  consumption  growth  has  eased  after  a  high  of  14%  in \n2009,  reflecting  the  effects  of  the  recent  global  financial  and  economic  downturn.  Despite  the \nslower  growth,  the  country  still  made  up  nearly  a  third  of  global  oil  demand  growth  in  2013, \naccording to EIA estimates, with an estimated consumption of 10.7 million bbl/d of oil in 2013, \nup 380 thousand bbl/d, or almost 4%, from 2012. In 2009, the PRC became the second largest \nnet oil importer in the world behind the US, and average net total oil imports reached 6.2 million \nbbl/d in 2013. Notably, for Q4 2013, the PRC actually became the largest global net importer of \noil.  The  country\u2019s  oil  demand  growth  hinges  on  several  factors,  such  as  domestic  economic \ngrowth  and  trade,  power  generation,  transportation  sector  shifts,  and  refining  capabilities.  The \nEIA  forecasts  that  oil  consumption  will  continue  growing  through  2014  at  a  moderate  pace  to \napproximately 11.1 million bbl/d, and net oil imports will reach 6.6 million bbl/d compared to 5.5 \nmillion bbl/d for the US (EIA 2014a). \n\n2.2  Japan \n\nJapan  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  importer,  the  second  largest  coal \nimporter,  and  third  largest  net  oil  importer  behind  the  US  and  the  PRC.  Japan  has  limited \ndomestic energy resources, which meet less than 15% of the country\u2019s own total primary energy \nuse.  \n\n2.2.1  Total Primary Energy Consumption in Japan \n\nIn March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a \nlarge tsunami. The damage to Japan resulted in an immediate shutdown of about 10 gigawatts \n(GW) of nuclear power generating capacity. Between the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant \ndisaster and May 2012, Japan lost all its nuclear capacity as a result of scheduled maintenance \nand lack of government approvals to return to operation. Japan replaced the significant loss of \nnuclear power with generation from imported natural gas, low-sulfur crude oil, fuel oil, and coal \n(Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  2014a).  Oil  remains  the  largest  source  of  primary  energy  in \nJapan. Coal continues to account for a significant share of total energy consumption, although \nnatural gas is increasingly important as a fuel source and is currently the preferred fuel of choice \nto replace the nuclear shortfall. The total primary consumption of natural gas rose from 19% in \n2010  to  24%  in  2012.  Before  the  2011  earthquake,  Japan  was  the  third  largest  consumer  of \nnuclear  power  in  the  world,  after  the  US  and  France,  and  nuclear  power  accounted  for  about \n13% of the country\u2019s total energy in 2010. In 2012, the nuclear energy share fell to 1% of total \nenergy consumption (and contributed a similar level to primary energy consumption in 2013 as \nonly two reactors were operating for a little more than half of the year), and in 2014 Japan did \nnot  produce  any  nuclear  power.  Hydropower  and  other  renewable  energy  comprise  a  small \npercentage of total energy consumption in Japan (EIA 2014b).  \n\nFigure  2  shows  primary  energy  consumption  in  Japan  by  type  based  on  thermal  values  from \n1990 to 2013. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nFigure 2: Primary Energy Consumption in Japan by Type Based on Thermal Values, \n1990\u20132013 \n\n \n\nNotes: Annual data were obtained by summing up the monthly data in each year. \n\nThermal values are based on General Energy Statistics (Agency of Resources and Energy). \n\nHydropower data before 1999 include geothermal power. \n\nThe data include estimated values. \n\n \n\nSources: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

As the figure shows, the US and Japan\u2019s shares are decreasing while the shares of the \nPRC and the rest of the world are on the rise. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nFigure 3: Share of the Three Major Oil Consumers in Global Oil Consumption, 1960\u20132012  \n\n \n\nRest of the \nWorld \n\nUnited States \n\nJapan \n\nPRC \n\n \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (2013). Annual Statistical Bulletin. Vienna: Organization of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.  \n\nJapan consumed nearly 4.6 million bbl/d in 2013, down from 4.7 million bbl/d in 2012, making it \nthe  third  largest  petroleum  consumer  in  the  world,  behind  the  US  and  the  PRC.  However,  oil \ndemand  in  Japan  has  declined  overall  since  2000  by  nearly  15%.  This  decline  stems  from \nstructural  factors,  such  as  fuel  substitution,  a  declining  population,  and  government-mandated \nenergy  efficiency  targets.  In  addition  to  the  shift  to  natural  gas  in  the  industrial  sector,  fuel \nsubstitution  is  occurring  in  the  residential  sector  as  high  prices  have  decreased  demand  for \nkerosene  in  home  heating.  Japan  consumes  most  of  its  oil  in  the  transportation  and  industrial \nsectors,  and  is  also  highly  dependent  on  naphtha  and  low-sulfur  fuel  oil  imports.  Demand  for \nnaphtha  has  fallen  as  ethylene  production  is  gradually  being  displaced  by  petrochemical \nproduction in other Asian economies. Demand for low-sulfur fuel oil and direct use of crude oil \nrose  substantially  in  2012  as  these  fuels  replaced  some  nuclear  power  generation  and \nsupported  the  post-disaster  reconstruction  works.  Japan\u2019s  oil  consumption  rose  by  255,000 \nbbl/d  in  2012  from  the  2011  level.  Oil  consumption  began  declining  in  2013  as  Japan  relied \nmore on natural gas and coal to substitute for the lost nuclear generation. The EIA assumes that \nnet total oil consumption will continue declining in 2015 as nuclear capacity comes back online \n(EIA 2014b). \n\nIn  the  wake  of  the  Fukushima  nuclear  incident  the  price  of  electricity  was  raised  for  the \ngovernment,  utilities,  and  consumers.  Increases  in  the  cost  of  fuel  imports  have  resulted  in \nJapan\u2019s  top  10  utilities  losing  over  $30  billion  in  the  past  2  years. Japan  spent  $250  billion  on \ntotal fuel imports in 2012, a third of its total import charge. Despite strength in export markets, \nthe  yen\u2019s  depreciation  and  soaring natural gas  and  oil  import  costs from a greater  reliance  on \nfossil fuels continued to deepen Japan\u2019s recent trade deficit throughout 2013.  \n\nOil  remains  the  largest  source  of  primary  energy  in  Japan,  although  its  share  of  total  energy \nconsumption declined from about 80 % in the 1970s to 43 % in 2011.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n\n3.1  Relationship between Energy Prices and Economic Growth \n\nOn the supply side of the economy, in addition to elements of labor and capital, energy is also \nconsidered to be a substantial element of production. Therefore, production can be shown as a \nfunction of labor, capital, and energy. Hence: \n\nQ =\nt\n\n(\n\nL\nt\n\n(\n\nW\nt\nP\nQt\n\n,\n\nQ\n\n),\n\nt\n\nK\n\nt\n\n(\n\nQi\n,\nt\n\nt\n\n),\n\nE\n\nt\n\n(\n\nP\nEt\nP\nQt\n\n)\n)\n\n,\n\nQ\n\nt\n\n                                                        (1) \n\ntL  is labor input, \n\ntQ  stands for gross output, \n\nwhere \ntE  is energy (oil, gas, and \ncoal)  input, \ntW  denotes  the  nominal  wage  rate,  ti  is  the  nominal  interest  rate,  and EtP and QtP  are \nthe  energy  price,2 and  consumer  price  index  (CPI),  respectively.  Eq.  (1)  shows  that  the  three \nelements of labor, capital, and energy lead to the alteration of levels of production. Furthermore, \nthere are direct relationships between the use of such elements and the level of production. In \nother words, a rise of each of the elements leads to an increase in production: \n\ntK  is capital input, \n\n \n\n                 \n\n\u2202\nQ\nt\n\u2202\nL\nt\n\n0,>\n\n0,>\n\n0>\n\n\u2202\nQ\nt\n\u2202\nK\n\nt\n\n\u2202\nQ\nt\n\u2202\nE\n\nt\n\n                                                                    (2)\n\nIn  addition,  the  consumption  of  each  of  the  energy  resources,  oil,  gas,  and  coal,  is  a  reverse \nfunction of their price levels: \n\n\u2202\nE\nt\n\u2202\nP\nEt\n\n\u2202\nE\nOt\n\u2202\nP\nOt\n\n\u2202\nE\nGt\n\u2202\nP\nGt\n\n\u2202\nE\nCt\n\u2202\nP\nCt\n\n  and   \n\n0<\n\n0,<\n\n0,<\n\n0<\n\n                                                (3)  \n\n,\n\n,\n\nCt\n\nGt\n\nOt\n\nEEE\n\nstands  for  oil,  gas,  and  coal  consumption,  respectively. OtP  denotes  the  oil \nwhere, \nprice,  GtP  the gas price, and CtP  the coal price. Therefore, if the general index of energy prices is \nincreased,  its  consumption  decreases.  However,  if  only  the  price  of  one  source  (given  oil) \nincreases  among  other  the  sources  of  energy,  or  if  its  price  increase  is  higher  than  other \nsources, then the increase in price of that source will partly be offset by a substitution of other \nsources. The  rates  of such  substitution  will  depend  on the technical  ability  of  other sources to \nreplace it and on the period of time available for such an adjustment. Therefore, an increase in \noil  price shall  lead to  the  substitution  of oil  by  other  sources  of  energy. Furthermore,  as  it  is a \nproduction factor, it will have short-term effects on the increase of production costs and will lead \nto the reduction of real production of oil importer countries. In the long run too, it leads to a rise \nin costs; the rate of which will depend on the ability of other sources to replace oil. If the ability \nto  substitute  exists,  such  price  increases  will  have  no  important  effect  on  costs.  Usually,  most \nresearchers  consider  the  relationship  between  \u201cenergy\u201d  and  \u201clabor  and  capital\u201d  to  be  a \nsubstitution under normal conditions. However, they consider the cross elasticity between them \nto  be  negative  in  the  short  run.  In  other  words,  \u201cenergy\u201d  and  \u201clabor  and  capital\u201d  will  be \nsupplements of each other in the short run because the structure of industries is such that they \nmay not react against a rise in costs (Bohi 1991). Hence, we may conclude that the short-term \neffect of an energy price shock will be bigger than its long-term one. This is reasonable because \nwhen  there  is  a  rise  in  energy  prices,  in  the  long  run  industries  change  the  structure  of  their \nproduction  as  much  as  possible  to  use  fewer  costly  resources.  In  industries  where  energy  is \n\n                                                \n2 Weighted average of crude oil, natural gas and coal prices. \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nused  as  an  intermediary  resource  of  production,  a  rise  in  energy  prices  drastically  affects  the \npotential production output, thereby affecting GDP. If we consider that \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201clabor and \ncapital\u201d  are  substitutable,  the  rise  in  energy  prices  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  use  of  the  two \nparameters  of  capital  and  labor,  which  makes  the  allocation  costs  of  parameters  and  relative \nshares for the two parameters of labor and capital rise (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. 2013).  \n\nThis section showed that higher energy prices as one of the production inputs, reduces the output \nlevel. On the other hand, following higher energy prices, household consumption and the demand \nside of the economy also suffer and result in a lower GDP level (see Section 3.3 of this paper). \n\n3.2  Relationship between Energy Prices and the General Price Level \n\nIn order to show the relationship between energy prices and the general price level, we adopt a \nthree-input Cobb-Douglas production function:  \n\nand assuming: \n\nQ\nt\n\n\u03b1\u03a4=\nL\nt\n\n(\n\nW\nt\nP\nQt\n\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\ntQ\n\nK\n\n)\n\nt\n\n(\n\ni\n\nt\n\n(\n\nM\n\n,\n)\n\nQ\n\n)\n\nt\n\nt\n\n\u03b3\n\nE\nt\n\n(\n\nP\nEt\nP\nQt\n\n,\n\nQ\n\n)\n\nt\n\n                                                   (4) \n\nL\n\nt\n\n1=\nL\n\nt\n\nQP\nQt\nW\n\nt\n\nK =\nt\n\nK\n\n1\n\nE\n\nt\n\n1=\nE\n\nQ\nt\n(\ni\ntMt\n\n)\n\nQP\nQt\nt\nP\nEt\n\n                                                                       (5) \n\n                                                                     (6) \n\n                                                                      (7) \n\nwhere \n\n\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 ,\n,\n\n are the output elasticities of labor, capital, and energy, respectively, and assuming \n\ntheir summation is equal to one, meaning constant returns to scale.

By substituting \nEqs.  (5)\u2013(7)  in  Eq.

AD  is  the  aggregate  demand  curve  and AS  stands  for  the  aggregate  supply  curve. \nAggregate  supply  curve  has  an  upward  sloping  curve,  which  shows  that  at  some  real  output \nlevel it becomes difficult to increase real output despite increases in the general level of prices. \nAt this output level, the economy achieves full employment.  \n\nSuppose that the initial equilibrium, point A is below the full employment level. When the relative \nprice  of  energy  resources  (crude  oil,  natural  gas,  coal,  etc.)  increases,  the  aggregate  supply \ncurve shifts to  SA \u2032 . The employment of existing labor and capital with a given nominal wage rate \nrequires  a  higher  general  price  for  output,  if  sufficient  amounts  of  the  higher-cost  energy \nresources are to be used.  \n\nThe productivity of existing capital and labor resources is reduced so that potential real output \ndeclines to 1Q . In addition, the same rate of labor employment occurs only if real wages decline \nsufficiently to match the decline in productivity. This, in turn, happens only if the general level of \nprices, \n1QP , rises sufficiently given the nominal wage rate. This moves the economy to the level \n1QP .  This  point  is  indicated  in  Figure  5  at  point B ,  which  is  a \ndisequilibrium  point.  Given  the  same  supply  of  labor  services  and  existing  plants  and \nequipment, the output associated with full employment declines as producers reduce their use \nof  relatively  more  expensive  energy  resources  and  as  plants  and  equipment  become \neconomically obsolete. \n\n1Q  and  price  level \n\nof  output \n\nOn the other hand, on the demand side of the economy, when the prices of energy resources \nrise,  their  consumption declines.  Because  of this  drop  in  consumption, the  aggregate  demand \ncurve shifts to DA \u2032, which in turn decreases prices from their previous disequilibrium level at \n1QP  \n2QP as the final equilibrium price. This lowers the output levels due to reduced \n\nand sets them tat \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nconsumption in the economy, from the previous point of \n5 at point C , which is the final equilibrium point.  \n\n1Q to 2Q . This point is indicated in Figure \n\nThe economy may not adjust instantaneously to point C , even if point  C  is the new equilibrium. \nFor  example,  price  rigidities  due  to  slow-moving  information  or  other  transactions  costs  can \nkeep  nominal  prices  from  adjusting  quickly  (Tatom  1981).  Consequently,  output  and  prices \nmove along an adjustment path such as that indicated by the arrow in Figure 5. \n\nIn  this  case,  aggregate  supply  is  the  main  chain  of  transmission  of  energy  price  shocks \ncompared  to  aggregate  demand.  This  means  that  the  supply  side  of  the  economy  is  more \naffected by oil price shocks than the demand side of the economy, resulting in higher prices and \nlower  output  levels  at  the  final  equilibrium  point,  C ,  when  compared  to  the  initial  equilibrium \npoint  A .  If  the  demand  side  of  the  economy  were  the  main  transmission  channel,  the  result \nwould be a decrease in output and lower price levels compared to the initial equilibrium point. \n\n4.  MODEL \n\nThe  main  objective  of  this  research  is  to  assess  and  compare  the  impact  of  the  price \nmovements of crude oil, the main energy resource, on GDP growth rates and CPI inflation rates \nof an emerging and two developed economies in a model incorporating monetary variables. In \ndeveloping this model we used Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino (2013a) as a reference. In their \nmodel, they assumed that oil price movements transfer to macro variables through either supply \n(the  aggregate  supply  curve)  or  demand  channels  (the  aggregate  demand  curve).  In  order  to \nexamine  the  effects  of  this  transfer,  they  used  an  IS  curve  to  look  at  the  demand  side  and  a \nPhillips curve to analyze inflationary effects from the supply side. \n\nUsing  this  aforementioned  research  as  inspiration,  we  chose  to  use  the  following  variables  in \nour  survey:  crude  oil  prices,  natural  gas  prices,  GDP,  consumer  price  index  (CPI),  money \nsupply,  and  the  exchange  rate.  We  included  the  natural  gas  price  because  it  is  the  main \nsubstitute  energy  source  for  crude  oil.  GDP  and  CPI  are  included  in  our  variables  mainly \nbecause  their  movements  have  an  impact  on  the  crude  oil  market  (Taghizadeh-Hesary  and \nYoshino  2013b,  2014),  and  also  because  our  objective  is  to  assess  the  impact  of  oil  price \nfluctuations on these two macro variables.  \n\nThe money supply and the exchange rate are monetary policy variables that have an impact on \nthe  crude  oil  market  and  on  the  whole  economy.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  include  each \ncountry\u2019s money supply and the exchange rate in our analysis (Barsky and Kilian 2002; Leduc \nand  Sill  2004;  Hamilton  and  Herrera  2004;  Taghizadeh-Hesary  and  Yoshino  2014,  2015; \nYoshino and Taghizadeh 2014a).  \n\nTaghizadeh-Hesary  and  Yoshino  (2014)  explain  that  oil  prices  accelerated  from  about \n$35/barrel in 1981 to beyond $111/barrel in 2011. At the same time, interest rates (the federal \nfunds  rate)  subsided  from  16.7%  per  annum  to  about  0.1%.  By  running  a  simultaneous \nequations  model,  they  found  that  during  the  period  1980\u20132011,  global  oil  demand  was \nsignificantly  influenced  by  monetary  policy  and  supply  actually  remained  constant.  Aggressive \nmonetary policy stimulates oil demand, while supply is inelastic. The result is skyrocketing crude \noil prices, which inhibit economic growth.3 \n\n                                                \n3 Taghizadeh  and  Yoshino  (2014),  in  order  to  define  the  determinants  of  crude  oil  prices,  used  two  substitution \nsources  for  crude  oil prices  (natural  gas  prices  and coal prices),  two  monetary  policy  factors  (the  exchange  rate \nand interest rate) and GDP growth rate, which shows economic activity growth. In this present paper since we use \nan SVAR model, in order to avoid identification problems, we must use the minimum possible number of variables. \n\n \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nYoshino  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  (2014)  examined  how  monetary  policy  affected  crude  oil \nprices  after  the  subprime  mortgage crisis. They found  that  after the  subprime mortgage  crisis, \nthe weaker exchange rate of the US dollar caused by the country\u2019s quantitative easing pushed \noil prices in US dollars upward over the period 2009\u20132012 by causing investors to invest in the \noil  market  and  other  commodity  markets  while  the  world  economy  was  in  recession  in  this \nperiod. This trend had the effect of imposing a longer recovery time on the global economy, as \noil has been shown to be one of the most important production inputs. \n\nFigure  6  depicts  two  monetary  policy  factors:  base  money  and  real  effective  exchange  rate \nmovements  along  with  crude  oil  price  movements.  It  illustrates  the  base  money  growth  rate \ntrend and the crude oil price movements during the period February 2007\u2013September 2013. As \nis clear, in most cases they tend to follow the same path. \n\nFigure 6: Base Money and Crude Oil Price, February 2007\u2013September 2013 \n\nCrude oil prices \n(left-hand scale) \n\nBase money  \ngrowth rate (right-hand scale) \n\nNotes:  Crude  oil  prices  are  in constant  dollars  obtained  using  a simple  average  of:  Dubai  crude  oil prices  in the  Tokyo \nmarket, Brent crude oil prices in the London market, and WTI crude oil prices in the New York market, deflated by the US \nconsumer  price  index  (CPI).

The  inverse  relationship  between  these  two \nvariables  is  apparent  in  this  figure.  In  most  cases,  crude  oil  prices  began  to  rise  following  a \ndepreciation of the US dollar, and dropped following an appreciation. \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nAs such, for substitution sources of crude oil, we limited our selection to natural gas, which is the main substitute \nfuel,  and  eliminated  coal  throughout  our  study.  As  for  monetary  variables  we  used  the  money  supply  and  the \nexchange  rates.

It is an extension on the traditional theoretical VAR approach in \nthat  it  combines  economic  theory  with  time-series  analysis  to  determine  the  dynamic  response  of  economic \nvariables to various disturbances. The main advantage of SVAR analysis is that the necessary restrictions on the \nestimated  reduced  form  model,  required  for  identification  of  the  underlying  structural  model,  can  be  provided  by \neconomic theory. These restrictions can be either contemporaneous or long-run in nature depending on whether \nthe  underlying  disturbances  are  considered  to  be  temporary  or  permanent  in  nature.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS \n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  the  increase  in  oil  prices  that  began  in  2001,  the  sharp  decline  that \nfollowed the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, and the immediate recovery that was experienced \nshortly after have renewed interest in the effects of oil prices on the macroeconomy.  Following \nthe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, crude oil prices dropped from $133.11 in July 2008 to below \n$42.01  in  December  2008,  due to  decreased global  demand.  Shortly  after this  drop,  however, \nprices  started  to  rise  sharply  again.  In  this  paper,  for  this  reason,  we  selected  a  period  that \ncovers  the  significant  fluctuations  mentioned  above.  Because  of  the  presence  of  a  structural \nbreak7 in  oil  prices  in  July  2008,  we  divided  our  analysis  into  two  subperiods,  January  2000\u2013\nJuly  2008  and  August  2008\u2013December  2013,  and  ran  regressions  for  our  SVAR  for  each  of \nthese three countries during the two subperiods before and after the sub-prime mortgage crisis, \nthe event that caused the recent fluctuations in crude oil prices, then compared the findings.   \n\n5.1  Data Analysis \n\nIn order to reach a more realistic analysis, we express all variables in real terms. As for the oil \nprices, because each of these three oil importers are importing crude oil from various sources, \nhence for the crude oil prices, we used the simple average of three major oil price sources as in \nKorhonen and Ledyaeva (2010) and Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. (2013): Dubai crude oil prices in \nthe Tokyo market, Brent crude oil prices in the London market, and WTI crude oil prices in the \nNew  York  market,  all  in  constant  dollars  and  seasonally  adjusted.  Natural  gas  prices  are  in \nconstant  dollars  obtained  using  a  simple  average  of  three  major  natural gas  prices:  US  Henry \nhub,  UK  National  Balancing  Point  (NBP)  and  Japanese  imported  LNG  average  prices, \nseasonally  adjusted.  The  GDP  of  all  three  countries  is  in  constant  US  dollars,  fixed  PPPs, \nseasonally adjusted. All of the three data series above were deflated by the US consumer price \nindex (CPI), as most crude oil, and natural gas markets are denominated in US dollars and the \n\n                                                \n5 For  more  information  on  exogeneity  tests  in  structural  systems  with  monetary  applications,  see  Revankar  and \n\nYoshino (1990). \n\n6 For the impact of the money supply on the exchange rates, see Yoshino, Kaji, and Asonuma (2012). \n7 In order to find the presence of structural changes throughout the period of our survey, we used the Chow test at \nvarious points  where  oil  prices  fluctuated significantly.  The results confirm a  structural break  in  July  2008,  when \nglobal oil prices dropped sharply because of lower oil demand due to the recession following the financial crisis. As \na result we can determine two subperiods for our analysis: January 2000\u2013July 2008 and August 2008\u2013December \n2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\namount  of  GDP  for  each  country  was  also  in  US  dollars.  For  the  exchange  rate  in  the  PRC\u2019s \nSVAR, we used the yuan REER, for Japan we used the yen REER and for the US, we used the \nUS dollar REER (2005=100). As for the money supply, we used M2 for the PRC, Japan, and the \nUS for each country\u2019s SVAR.  From now on, whenever we refer to the price of crude oil, natural \ngas,  and  GDP,  unless  otherwise  stated,  we  refer  to  their  real  values.  Sources  of  data  are \nInternational  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  (2013),  International  Financial  Statistics  (IFS)  2013, \nthe Energy Data and Modeling Center (EDMC) database of the Institute of Energy Economics, \nJapan (IEEJ), Monthly Energy Review of the US Department of Energy (DOE), and the Bank of \nJapan (BOJ) database. \n\nIn  order  to  evaluate  the  stationarity  of  all  series,  we  used  an  Augmented  Dickey\u2013Fuller  (ADF) \ntest for all series with intercept and trend. The results imply that with the exception of M2 for the \nUS  and  GDP  for  the  PRC,  which  were  stationary  at  the  log  level,  all  other  variables  are  non-\nstationary at log level. However, when we applied the unit root test to the first difference of log-\nlevel variables with intercept and trend, we were able to reject the null hypothesis of unit roots \nfor  each  of  the  variables.  These  results  suggest  that  the  M2  for  the  PRC  and  Japan,  the \nexchange rates of all three countries, Japanese and US GDP, crude oil prices, and natural gas \nprice  variables  all  contain  a  unit  root.  Once  the  unit  root  test  was  performed  and  it  was \ndiscovered that the variables are non-stationary in level and stationary in first differences, they \nwere integrated of order one. Hence they will appear in the SVAR model in the first differenced \nform.  This  means  that  instead  of  CPI,  we  will  have  CPI  growth  rate  or  the  inflation  rate,  and \ninstead of GDP we will have the GDP growth rate. For other variables, we will have their growth \nrates in our regressions. \n\nIn order to test whether the identification is valid, the LR test was run for each country\u2019s SVAR. \nThe  LR  test  does  not  reject  the  under-identifying  restrictions  at  the  5&  level,  implying  that  the \nidentification is valid. \n\n5.2  Empirical Result \n\nRegressions results of our SVAR model for each country are presented in Table 1. \n\nTable 1: Empirical Results \n\nCountry \nPeople\u2019s Republic of \nChina \n\nJapan \n\nUnited States \n\nJanuary 2000\u2013July 2008 \n= - 0.26  S.E.= 0.07** \n= 0.02 \n=  0.03      S.E.= 0.005** \n= 0.03       S.E.= 0.007** \n\nS.E.= 0.02 \n\nCNa64\u2212\nCNa54\u2212\nJPa64\u2212\nJPa54\u2212\n\nUSa64\u2212\n\n=  -0.06     S.E.= 0.002** \n\nAugust 2008\u2013December 2013 \n\n= -0.27    S.E.= 0.39 \n= 0.02  S.E.= 0.02 \n= -0.1  S.E.= 0.02** \n= -0.01 S.E.= 0.007 \n=  -\n\nS.E.= 0.01 \n\nCNa64\u2212\nCNa54\u2212\nJPa64\u2212\nJPa54\u2212\nUSa64\u2212\n0.01 \nUSa 54\u2212\n\nUSa54\u2212\n\n= 0.07       S.E.= 0.002** \n\n= 0.03   S.E.= 0.01* \n\nS.E. = standard error. \n\n\u2212\n\na\n\ni\n64\n\ni\n(\n\n=\n\nCN\n\n,\n\nJP\n\n,\n\nUS\n\n)\n\nNote: \n\nshows the impact of oil price fluctuations on GDP growth, \n\n\u2212\n\na\n\ni\n64\n\n(\ni\n\n=\n\nCN\n\n,\n\nJP\n\n,\n\nUS\n\n/)\n\n.\nES\n\n.\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\ni\n54\n\ni\n(\n\n=\n\nCN\n\n,\n\nJP\n\n,\n\nUS\n\n)\n\nshows the impact of \n54 =\n(\n/)\ni\n\n.\nES\n\nCN\n\nUS\n\nJP\n\ni\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\n.

However the size and magnitude of this impact varies for each country and for different \ntime periods. Below we interpret the sign, size, and magnitude of the contemporaneous impacts \nof  crude  oil  price  movements  on  GDP  growth  rates  and  on  CPI  inflation  rates  of  these  three \ncountries. \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  elasticity  of  GDP  growth  rate  and  inflation  rate  to  oil  price  movements  did  not \nchange  after  the  2008  financial  crisis.  Before  the  crisis,  the  elasticities  of  the  country\u2019s  GDP \ngrowth rate and inflation rate to crude oil price changes were -0.26 (significant) and 0.02 (non-\nsignificant),  respectively,  and  after  the  crisis  they  were  -0.27(non-significant)  and  0.02  (non-\nsignificant). The main cause for this is the appreciation of the yuan. Slightly after the sub-prime \nmortgage  crisis,  oil  prices  started  to  increase  sharply.  This  happened  because  of  a  mild \nrecovery in the global economy and huge quantitative easing (QE) policies by the US and other \ncountries\u2019 monetary authorities (Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2014a). At the same time, the \nyuan appreciated compared to other currencies, which means that the price of crude oil in the \nPRC\u2019s  domestic  market  did  not  fluctuate  much.  The  result  was  that  both  before  and  after  the \ncrisis,  the  impact  of  crude  oil  prices  on  the  PRC\u2019s  economy  (GDP  and  inflation)  was  almost \nconstant.  \n\nThere are several earlier studies on the impact of oil shocks on the PRC\u2019s economy that match \nour results (Zaouali 2007; Tang, Wu, and Zhang 2010; Du, Yanan, and Wei 2010). The PRC\u2019s \noil consumption doubled over the past decade because of the country\u2019s high economic growth, \nwhich required large amounts of energy. In addition, the PRC is the second largest consumer of \noil  in  the  world  behind  the  US.  It  has  high  energy  intensity,  and  the  energy  consumption  per \n$1,000 GDP in 2007 was 0.57 tons of oil equivalent, higher than that of Germany (0.09), Japan \n(0.12), and the US (0.17).  \n\nJapan\u2019s  elasticity  of  GDP  growth  rate  to  oil  price  fluctuations  became  negative  after  the  2008 \nfinancial  crisis,  at  \u20130.1  (significant).  The  reason  for  this  is  that  in  the  wake  of  the  Fukushima \nnuclear incident in March 2011, oil remains the largest source of primary energy in Japan. The \ndisaster  made  the  country  fully  dependent  on  imports  of  fossil  products,  especially  crude  oil. \nJapan spent $250 billion on total fuel imports in 2012, a third of the country\u2019s total import charge.  \nBefore the crisis, in the first subperiod, the elasticity of the Japanese GDP growth rate to crude \noil  price  movements  was  positive,  at  0.03  (significant). Worldwide  increases  in  oil  prices  have \nhad  a  positive  effect  on  Japan\u2019s  GDP.  These  findings  are  also  in  accordance  with  those  of \nJim\u00e9nez-Rodr\u00edguez  and  S\u00e1nchez  (2004),  Blanchard  and  Gal\u00ed  (2007),  Kilian  (2008b),  and \nTaghizadeh-Hesary  et  al.  (2013),  who  all  conclude  that  Japan  has  fared  relatively  well  in  the \nface  of  recent  exogenous  oil  price  shocks.  However  the  findings  by  Korhonen  and  Ledyaeva \n(2010) for Japan are the reverse, as they observed negative impacts of oil shocks on GDP. This \npositive  elasticity  exists  due  to  several  reasons,  such  as  increased  energy  efficiency, \naccumulating  huge  strategic  reserves  of  crude  oil,  declining  crude  oil  demand  stemming  from \nstructural factors  like fuel  substitution  (the  use  of  nuclear  electric  power  and  natural gas),  and \npopulation decline. Another reason is that in first subperiod, although crude oil prices saw huge \nincreases,  because  of  appreciation  of  the  yen,  resulting  from  accumulated  foreign  reserves  in \nthe country, energy prices in the domestic market did not increase much.  \n\nAs for the elasticity of CPI inflation to crude oil price growth rates, in the first subperiod the value \nwas 0.03 (significant), but became negative after the crisis (\u20130.01, non-significant). The reason \nfor  this  negative  impact  on  prices  is  that  in  Japan,  aggregate  supply  (AS)  is  almost  constant. \nHigher energy  prices  mainly  affect the  demand side  of the  economy. This  is  clearly  evident  in \nthe second subperiod, shortly following the uncertain situation that occurred in the country after \n\n \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nthe  Fukushima  nuclear  disaster.  This  uncertainty  caused  domestic  consumption  to  shrink, \nresulting in price deflation. \n\nOur  empirical  results  show  that  the  US  economy  in  both  periods  was  affected  by  oil  prices, \nwhich  is  in  line  with  several  papers  (Hamilton  1983,  2005;  Blanchard  and  Gali  2007;  Kilian \n2008b).  The absolute value of the US elasticity of GDP growth rate to oil price growth rate was \nreduced following the 2008 financial crisis because of lower aggregate demand in the country, \ncaused  by  recession.  Moreover,  the  impact  of  higher  oil  prices  on  inflation  decreased  in  the \nsecond period because of lower aggregate demand.  \n\nThe impact of oil price fluctuations on US and Japanese GDP is much milder than for the PRC. \nHowever, the PRC\u2019s CPI sees smoother rates of inflation in oil shocks compared to the US and \nJapan  because  of  the  higher  growth  rate  in  the  PRC\u2019s  economy,  which  shifts  the  AS  curve \nforward and avoids higher prices in oil shocks. In Japan\u2019s case, the AS curve has been almost \nconstant recently, and in the US is seeing only a small forward shift. \n\nFigure  8  compares  energy  intensities  in  the  PRC,  Japan,  and  the  US  and  is  evidence  for  our \nfinding  that  the  PRC\u2019s  GDP  is  more  responsive  to  oil  price  fluctuations  GDP  for  the  US  and \nJapan.  Energy  intensity  measures  the  amount  of  energy  (total  primary  energy  consumption) a \ncountry needs to generate a unit of GDP. \n\nFigure 8: Energy Intensity, 1980\u20132011 \n\nBtu = British thermal units.  \n\n \n\nNote: Total primary energy consumption per US dollar of GDP (Btu per year, 2005 US dollars [market exchange rates]). \nSource:  US  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA),  Independent  Statistics  &  Analysis,  International  Energy  Statistics \nhttp://www.eia.gov/beta/international/ (retrieved Sep 21, 2015). \n\nAs  is  clear,  although  for  the  case  of  the  PRC  energy  intensity  has  decreased  over  the  last  3 \ndecades, several reasons explain this decline: faster growth of GDP than energy demand, the \nservices  sector  having  a  growing  share  of  the  economy,  and  energy  efficiency  programs. \nHowever,  while  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  intensity  decreased  significantly,  it  is  still  much  higher  than \nthe US and Japan\u2019s. There are several reasons behind this large gap that can be summarized in \nenergy conservation.8 \n\n                                                \n8 Energy conservation means decreasing the quantity of energy used without any change in output. \n\n \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  analyzed  the  impact  of  oil  price  fluctuations  on  two  macro  variables  of  two \ndeveloped  countries  and  one  emerging  country.  The  purpose  is  to  compare  the  response  of \ncountries in these two groups to oil price fluctuations. For our analysis, we selected a period that \nincludes  the  most  recent  financial  crisis:  the  subprime  mortgage  crisis  of  2007\u20132008.  This \nmeans that we simultaneously compared the impacts in the period January 2000\u2013July 2008 with \nthe period following the crisis, August 2008\u2013December 2013. \n\nOur results show that the impacts of oil price fluctuations on GDP growth rates in developed oil \nimporters  (US  and  Japan)  are  much  milder  than  for  an  emerging  economy\u2019s  (PRC).  The \nreasons for the difference between the impacts on these two groups are: high fuel substitution \n(higher use of nuclear electric power, gas, and renewables), a declining population (for the case \nof  Japan),  the  shale  gas  revolution  (for  the  US),  greater  strategic  crude  oil  stocks  and \ngovernment-mandated energy efficiency targets in the two developed economies compared with \nthe emerging economy, which make them more resistant to oil shocks. On the other hand, the \nimpact of higher crude oil prices on the PRC\u2019s CPI inflation is milder than in the two advanced \neconomies.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  a  higher  economic  growth  rate  in  the  PRC  results  in  a \nlarger  forward  shift  of  aggregate  supply,  which  avoids  large  increases  in  price  levels  after  oil \nprice shocks. \n\nBy comparing the results of these two subperiods, we conclude that in the second subperiod the \nimpact of oil price fluctuations on the US GDP growth rate and inflation rate was milder than in \nthe first subperiod, because of lower crude oil and aggregate demand resulting from a recession \nin  the  economy.  For  Japan,  the  second  subperiod  coincides  with  the  Fukushima  nuclear \ndisaster  that  followed  the  massive  earthquake  and  tsunami  in  March  2011  and  raised  the \ndependency  on  oil  imports.  Hence,  the  elasticity  of  GDP  growth  to  oil  price  fluctuations  rose \ndrastically.  CPI  elasticity  decreased,  however,  because  of  diminished  consumption,  which \nresulted from  uncertainty  in  the  nation\u2019s future  after  the  devastating  disaster. The  PRC\u2019s GDP \ngrowth  and  inflation  rate  elasticities  to  oil  price  fluctuations  were  almost  constant  in  both \nsubperiods.  The  main  reason  for  this  is  appreciation  of  the  yuan.  Slightly  after  the  sub-prime \nmortgage  crisis,  oil  prices  started  to  increase  sharply  due  to  a  mild  recovery  in  the  global \neconomy  and  huge quantitative  easing (QE)  policies  in  the  US  and  by monetary  authorities  in \nother  countries.  Simultaneously,  the  yuan  appreciated  compared  to  other  currencies,  which \nmeans the price of crude oil in the PRC\u2019s domestic market did not fluctuate as much. The result \nis  that  before  and  after the  crisis, the  impact  of crude  oil  prices  on  the PRC\u2019s  economy  (GDP \nand inflation) was almost constant.  \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n\nADBI Working Paper 546 \n \n\nREFERENCES* \n\nBarsky, R.

The  main  objective  of  this  research  is  to \ninvestigate whether these economies are still reactive to oil price movements and compare \ntheir reactions. Monetary variables are included in this survey because our earlier research \nshowed that they have a significant role in oil price determination. To assess the relationship \nbetween  crude  oil  prices  and  macro  variables  we  adopt  an  N-variable  structural  vector \nautoregression (SVAR) model. The results suggest that the impact of oil price fluctuations on \ndeveloped oil importers\u2019 GDP growth is much milder than on the GDP growth of an emerging \neconomy.  On  the  other  hand,  however,  the  impact  of  oil  price  fluctuations  on  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2019s inflation rate was found to be milder than in the two developed countries \nthat were examined. \n", " \nJEL Classification: Q43, E31, O57 \n", " \n"]}
