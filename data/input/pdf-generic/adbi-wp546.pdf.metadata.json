INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  \nMore than 40 years have passed since the first oil price shock of 1973. During this period, \nglobal  demand  for  oil  has  risen  drastically,  while  at  the  same  time,  new  energy-related \ntechnologies and new energy resources have made global consumers more resistant to oil \nshocks. Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, emerging economies have come to play a much \nlarger role in global energy consumption. The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) share, for \nexample, is 5 times larger than it was in the 1970s. On the other hand, the shares of the two \nlargest developed oil consumers, the US and Japan, decreased from about 32% and 10% to \n21% and 5%, respectively.  \nFollowing the oil crises of the 1970s and the economic recessions that followed, several studies \nhave found that oil price shocks played a significant role in economic downturns. In recent years, \nboth the sharp increase in oil prices that began in 2001 and the sharp decline that followed in \n2008 following the subprime mortgage crisis have renewed interest in the effects of oil prices on \nthe Macroeconomy. Following the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, crude oil prices dropped from \n$133.11 in July 2008 to below $42.01 in December 2008, due to decreased global demand. \nShortly after this drop, however, they started to rise sharply again. \nIn this research we will assess and compare the impact of oil price fluctuations on the following \nmacroeconomic factors: the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate and consumer price \nindex (CPI) inflation. We look at these factors in the three largest crude oil consumers: the \nUnited States (US) and Japan (developed economies), and the PRC (an emerging economy). \nWe will answer the question of whether these economies are still elastic to oil price movements, \nor whether new, energy-related technologies and resources, like renewables and shale gas, \nhave  completely  sheltered  them  from  shocks.  If  they  are  still  elastic,  are  emerging  and \ndeveloped economies influenced to the same degree? \nReviewing the literature of oil prices since 1970s until now, several studies have assessed the \nimpacts of oil prices on various economic variables. \nBlanchard  and  Gali  (2007)  characterized  the  macroeconomic  performance  of  a  set  of \nindustrialized economies in the aftermath of the oil price shocks of the 1970s and of the last \ndecade, using a six-variable vector autoregression (VAR) model. They found a significant role of \noil prices in the economic downturns. The variables used in their survey were the nominal price \nof  oil  (in  US  dollars),  three  inflation  measures  (CPI,  GDP  deflator,  and  wages)  and  two \nquantities (GDP and employment). Kilian (2008a) addressed a numbers of issues, including \nhow energy price shocks affect US real output, inflation, and stock prices. The variables used \nwere the nominal oil price, real oil price, and GDP. The study found that it is critical to account \nfor the endogeneity of energy prices and to differentiate between the effects of demand and \nsupply shocks in energy markets. Levent and Acar (2011) analyzed the economic effects of oil \nprice shocks for Turkey as a small, open oil- and gas-importing country. They analyzed the \npotential long-term effects of oil price shocks on macroeconomic variables of interest\u2014including \nGDP, consumer price inflation, indirect tax revenue, the trade balance, and carbon emissions\u2014\nusing  a  dynamic,  multi-sectoral  general  equilibrium  model  for  the  Turkish  economy.  Their \nsimulation results showed that oil prices have significant effects on macro indicators. In a more \nrecent study, Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. (2013) evaluated the impact of oil price shocks on oil \nproducing and consuming economies; the study used a simultaneous equation framework for \ndifferent countries with business relations. As expected, the results showed that oil producers \n(Iran and the Russian Federation) benefit from oil price shocks. For oil-consuming economies, \nthe effects are more diverse. In some countries, output falls in response to an oil price shock, \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nwhile others seem to be relatively immune. Variables used in the survey were GDP, trade share, \nand oil prices. \nHowever, the advantage of our survey compared with the aforementioned papers and other \nresearch that has been done in the field of oil prices is that we include monetary variables \n(money supply and exchange rate). Monetary policy has a significant impact on inflating the \nprice of oil and other commodities (see, inter alia, Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino [2014, 2015] \nand Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary [2014a]). On the other hand, monetary policy has a crucial \nrole in general price determination and on economic growth movement (e.g., Sims [1980, 1992]; \nRomer and Romer [1989]; Yoshino et al. [2014]; and Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary [2015]). \nBernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) argue that much of the decline in output and employment \nin the US was due to the rise in interest rates. Hence, due to the above reasons it is essential to \ninclude monetary variables (money supply and the exchange rate) in our survey. \nOur analysis shows that the impact of oil price movements on developed oil importers\u2019 GDP \ngrowth is much milder than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. On the other hand, \nthe impact of oil price fluctuations on the PRC\u2019s inflation rate was found to be milder than in the \ntwo developed countries. \nThis paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present an overview of oil and energy \nin the PRC, Japan, and the US. In the third section we provide theoretical framework including: \nthe relationship between energy prices and economic growth, the relationship between energy \nprices and general price levels, and the impact of higher energy prices on supply and demand in \nthe economy. Our model is explained in the fourth section, and in the fifth section we describe \nour empirical analysis. The sixth section concludes the paper. \n2.  OVERVIEW OF OIL AND ENERGY IN THE PRC, JAPAN, \nAND THE US  \n2.1  People\u2019s Republic of China \nThe PRC has quickly risen to the top ranks in global energy demand over the past few years. It \nis the world\u2019s second largest oil consumer behind the US and became the largest global energy \nconsumer in 2010. The economy was a net oil exporter until the early 1990s and became the \nworld\u2019s second-largest net importer of crude oil and petroleum products in 2009. The PRC\u2019s oil \nconsumption growth accounted for one-third of the world\u2019s oil consumption growth in 2013 (EIA \n2014a). Natural gas use in the PRC has also increased rapidly in recent years, and the country \nhas sought to raise natural gas imports via pipelines and the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG). \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s top coal producer, consumer, and importer, and accounts for about half \nof  global  coal  consumption\u2014an  important  factor  in  world  energy-related  carbon  dioxide \nemissions. The PRC\u2019s rising coal production is the key driver behind the economy becoming the \nworld\u2019s largest energy producer in 2007. Coal supplied the vast majority (69%) of the PRC\u2019s \ntotal energy consumption in 2011. Oil was the second-largest source, accounting for 18% of \ntotal energy consumption. While the PRC has made efforts to diversify its energy supplies, \nhydropower sources (6%), natural gas (4%), nuclear power (nearly 1%), and other renewables \n(1%) account for small shares of energy consumption (Figure 1).  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nFigure 1: Total Energy Consumption in the PRC by Type, 2011 \n \n \nNote: Percentages may not total 100% because of rounding. \nSource: Energy Information Administration. International Energy Statistics. Washington, DC: United States Energy \nInformation Administration. \nAccording to a project carried out by the Institute of Energy Economics of Japan (IEEJ 2013), \nthe PRC\u2019s oil consumption will almost double over the next 30 years, reaching 866 million tons \n1\nof oil equivalent  (Mtoe) by 2040. During this period, the PRC will replace the US as the world\u2019s \nlargest  oil  consumer.  Driving  the  increase  will  be  the transportation  sector,  including road \ntransportation. With the potential to expand the vehicle market from its current 7% vehicle \nownership rate, the number of vehicles in the PRC is expected to increase to 360 million in \n2040, meaning that the transportation sector will double its oil consumption. The country\u2019s share \nof  global  gasoline  consumption  is  also  expected  to  expand  from  its  current  8%  to  18%, \nexceeding its share of the global population. This projection continues by saying that by 2040 \nthe PRC will have the world\u2019s largest nuclear power generation capacity, and will account for \nhalf of the increase in global nuclear generation capacity between 2011 and 2040. Renewable \nenergy will account for 9.7% of the country\u2019s primary energy consumption in 2040 (Taghizadeh-\nHesary, Yoshino, and Assari-Arani 2015). \n2.1.1  Oil Consumption in the PRC \nAs of January 2014, the PRC held 24.4 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, up by over 0.7 \nbillion barrels from the 2013 level and the highest in the Asia and the Pacific region. The PRC\u2019s \ntotal oil and liquids production, the fourth largest in the world, has risen by about 54% over the \npast 2 decades and serves only its domestic market (EIA 2014a). However, production growth \nhas not kept pace with demand growth during this period. In 2013, the country produced an \nestimated 4.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of total oil liquids, of which 93% was crude oil. The \nEIA forecasts oil production to rise to about 4.6 million bbl/d by the end of 2014. Over the longer \nterm, the EIA projects a steady growth for the PRC\u2019s oil and liquids production, to 4.6 million \n                                                \n1 Equal to about 6,186 million barrels of oil equivalent. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nbbl/d in 2020 and 5.6 million bbl/d by 2040. Most of the growth over the long term is from non-\npetroleum liquids such as gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids, kerogen, and biofuels, as crude oil \nproduction remains relatively flat. Oil consumption growth has eased after a high of 14% in \n2009, reflecting the effects of the recent global financial and economic downturn. Despite the \nslower growth, the country still made up nearly a third of global oil demand growth in 2013, \naccording to EIA estimates, with an estimated consumption of 10.7 million bbl/d of oil in 2013, \nup 380 thousand bbl/d, or almost 4%, from 2012. In 2009, the PRC became the second largest \nnet oil importer in the world behind the US, and average net total oil imports reached 6.2 million \nbbl/d in 2013. Notably, for Q4 2013, the PRC actually became the largest global net importer of \noil. The country\u2019s oil demand growth hinges on several factors, such as domestic economic \ngrowth and trade, power generation, transportation sector shifts, and refining capabilities. The \nEIA forecasts that oil consumption will continue growing through 2014 at a moderate pace to \napproximately 11.1 million bbl/d, and net oil imports will reach 6.6 million bbl/d compared to 5.5 \nmillion bbl/d for the US (EIA 2014a). \n2.2  Japan \nJapan is the world\u2019s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, the second largest coal \nimporter, and third largest net oil importer behind the US and the PRC. Japan has limited \ndomestic energy resources, which meet less than 15% of the country\u2019s own total primary energy \nuse.  \n2.2.1  Total Primary Energy Consumption in Japan \nIn March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a \nlarge tsunami. The damage to Japan resulted in an immediate shutdown of about 10 gigawatts \n(GW) of nuclear power generating capacity. Between the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant \ndisaster and May 2012, Japan lost all its nuclear capacity as a result of scheduled maintenance \nand lack of government approvals to return to operation. Japan replaced the significant loss of \nnuclear power with generation from imported natural gas, low-sulfur crude oil, fuel oil, and coal \n(Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary 2014a). Oil remains the largest source of primary energy in \nJapan. Coal continues to account for a significant share of total energy consumption, although \nnatural gas is increasingly important as a fuel source and is currently the preferred fuel of choice \nto replace the nuclear shortfall. The total primary consumption of natural gas rose from 19% in \n2010 to 24% in 2012. Before the 2011 earthquake, Japan was the third largest consumer of \nnuclear power in the world, after the US and France, and nuclear power accounted for about \n13% of the country\u2019s total energy in 2010. In 2012, the nuclear energy share fell to 1% of total \nenergy consumption (and contributed a similar level to primary energy consumption in 2013 as \nonly two reactors were operating for a little more than half of the year), and in 2014 Japan did \nnot produce any nuclear power. Hydropower and other renewable energy comprise a small \npercentage of total energy consumption in Japan (EIA 2014b).  \nFigure 2 shows primary energy consumption in Japan by type based on thermal values from \n1990 to 2013. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \n \nFigure 2: Primary Energy Consumption in Japan by Type Based on Thermal Values, \n1990\u20132013 \n \nNotes: Annual data were obtained by summing up the monthly data in each year. \nThermal values are based on General Energy Statistics (Agency of Resources and Energy). \nHydropower data before 1999 include geothermal power. \nThe data include estimated values. \nSources: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.

As the figure shows, the US and Japan\u2019s shares are decreasing while the shares of the \nPRC and the rest of the world are on the rise. \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \n \nFigure 3: Share of the Three Major Oil Consumers in Global Oil Consumption, 1960\u20132012  \nRest of the \nWorld \nUnited States \nJapan \nPRC \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (2013). Annual Statistical Bulletin. Vienna: Organization of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.  \nJapan consumed nearly 4.6 million bbl/d in 2013, down from 4.7 million bbl/d in 2012, making it \nthe third largest petroleum consumer in the world, behind the US and the PRC. However, oil \ndemand in Japan has declined overall since 2000 by nearly 15%. This decline stems from \nstructural factors, such as fuel substitution, a declining population, and government-mandated \nenergy efficiency targets. In addition to the shift to natural gas in the industrial sector, fuel \nsubstitution is occurring in the residential sector as high prices have decreased demand for \nkerosene in home heating. Japan consumes most of its oil in the transportation and industrial \nsectors, and is also highly dependent on naphtha and low-sulfur fuel oil imports. Demand for \nnaphtha  has  fallen  as  ethylene  production  is  gradually  being  displaced  by  petrochemical \nproduction in other Asian economies. Demand for low-sulfur fuel oil and direct use of crude oil \nrose  substantially  in  2012  as  these  fuels  replaced  some  nuclear  power  generation  and \nsupported the post-disaster reconstruction works. Japan\u2019s oil consumption rose by 255,000 \nbbl/d in 2012 from the 2011 level. Oil consumption began declining in 2013 as Japan relied \nmore on natural gas and coal to substitute for the lost nuclear generation. The EIA assumes that \nnet total oil consumption will continue declining in 2015 as nuclear capacity comes back online \n(EIA 2014b). \nIn  the  wake  of  the  Fukushima  nuclear  incident  the  price  of  electricity  was  raised  for  the \ngovernment, utilities, and consumers. Increases in the cost of fuel imports have resulted in \nJapan\u2019s top 10 utilities losing over $30 billion in the past 2 years. Japan spent $250 billion on \ntotal fuel imports in 2012, a third of its total import charge. Despite strength in export markets, \nthe yen\u2019s depreciation and soaring natural gas and oil import costs from a greater reliance on \nfossil fuels continued to deepen Japan\u2019s recent trade deficit throughout 2013.  \nOil remains the largest source of primary energy in Japan, although its share of total energy \nconsumption declined from about 80 % in the 1970s to 43 % in 2011. Japan consumed over 4.7 \nmillion barrels of oil per day in 2012.  \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \n2.3  United States \n2.3.1  Total Primary Energy Consumption in the US \nIn 2012, the US consumed over 94 quadrillion British thermal units (BTU) of primary energy, \nmaking it the world\u2019s second largest energy consumer after the PRC (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. \n2015).  \nFigure 4 shows US primary energy consumption by source. The share of crude oil decreased \nfrom 46% in 1973 to 36% in 2012, while the shares of natural gas (driven especially by the \nshale gas revolution), nuclear power, and renewable energy have risen drastically. \n \nFigure 4: United States Primary Energy Consumption by Source, 1973\u20132011 \n \nBTU = British thermal unit. \nNote: Natural gas consumption excludes supplemental gaseous fuels.  \nSource: EIA (2014c). \nAs for oil consumption, the US still ranks highly among global oil consumers, with consumption \nat about 18.49 million bbl/d (EIA 2014c). Although oil consumption decreased from its peak in \n2005, it is still the main energy source in the US. Today, oil meets 36% of US energy demand, \nwith 70% directed to fuels used in transportation\u2014gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Another 24 % is \nused in industry and manufacturing, 5% is used in the commercial and residential sectors, and \nless than 1% is used to generate electricity. Oil is the main mover of US national commerce and \nits use in transportation has allowed people to become more easily connected. Almost all US \ntransportation is dependent upon fuel in concentrated liquid form. The major sources of US \nimported  oil  are  Canada,  Mexico,  and  Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries \n(OPEC), particularly Saudi Arabia, including 20% coming from the Persian Gulf.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n3.1  Relationship between Energy Prices and Economic Growth \nOn the supply side of the economy, in addition to elements of labor and capital, energy is also \nconsidered to be a substantial element of production. Therefore, production can be shown as a \nfunction of labor, capital, and energy. Hence: \nQt =(Lt(PWt ,Qt),Kt(it,Qt),Et(PPEt ,Qt))                                                        (1) \nQt Qt\nwhere   stands for gross output,   is labor input,   is capital input,   is energy (oil, gas, and \nQ L K E\nt t t t\ncoal) input, W  denotes the nominal wage rate, i is the nominal interest rate, andP andP  are \nt t Et Qt\n2\nthe energy price,  and consumer price index (CPI), respectively. Eq. (1) shows that the three \nelements of labor, capital, and energy lead to the alteration of levels of production. Furthermore, \nthere are direct relationships between the use of such elements and the level of production. In \nother words, a rise of each of the elements leads to an increase in production: \n                  \u2202Qt >0,\u2202Qt >0,\u2202Qt >0                                                                    (2)\n\u2202L \u2202K \u2202E\nt t t\nIn addition, the consumption of each of the energy resources, oil, gas, and coal, is a reverse \nfunction of their price levels: \n\u2202Et <0  and   \u2202EOt <0,\u2202EGt <0,\u2202ECt <0                                                (3)  \n\u2202P \u2202P \u2202P \u2202P\nEt Ot Gt Ct\nwhere, E ,E ,E stands for oil, gas, and coal consumption, respectively. P  denotes the oil \nOt Gt Ct Ot\nprice, P  the gas price, andP  the coal price. Therefore, if the general index of energy prices is \nGt Ct\nincreased, its consumption decreases. However, if only the price of one source (given oil) \nincreases among other the sources of energy, or if its price increase is higher than other \nsources, then the increase in price of that source will partly be offset by a substitution of other \nsources. The rates of such substitution will depend on the technical ability of other sources to \nreplace it and on the period of time available for such an adjustment. Therefore, an increase in \noil price shall lead to the substitution of oil by other sources of energy. Furthermore, as it is a \nproduction factor, it will have short-term effects on the increase of production costs and will lead \nto the reduction of real production of oil importer countries. In the long run too, it leads to a rise \nin costs; the rate of which will depend on the ability of other sources to replace oil. If the ability \nto substitute exists, such price increases will have no important effect on costs. Usually, most \nresearchers  consider  the  relationship  between  \u201cenergy\u201d  and  \u201clabor  and  capital\u201d  to  be  a \nsubstitution under normal conditions. However, they consider the cross elasticity between them \nto  be  negative  in  the  short  run.  In  other  words,  \u201cenergy\u201d  and  \u201clabor  and  capital\u201d  will  be \nsupplements of each other in the short run because the structure of industries is such that they \nmay not react against a rise in costs (Bohi 1991). Hence, we may conclude that the short-term \neffect of an energy price shock will be bigger than its long-term one. This is reasonable because \nwhen there is a rise in energy prices, in the long run industries change the structure of their \nproduction as much as possible to use fewer costly resources.

If we consider that \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201clabor and \ncapital\u201d are substitutable, the rise in energy prices leads to an increase in the use of the two \nparameters of capital and labor, which makes the allocation costs of parameters and relative \nshares for the two parameters of labor and capital rise (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. 2013).  \nThis section showed that higher energy prices as one of the production inputs, reduces the output \nlevel. On the other hand, following higher energy prices, household consumption and the demand \nside of the economy also suffer and result in a lower GDP level (see Section 3.3 of this paper). \n3.2  Relationship between Energy Prices and the General Price Level \nIn order to show the relationship between energy prices and the general price level, we adopt a \nthree-input Cobb-Douglas production function:  \n \nQt =\u03a4Lt\u03b1(PWQtt ,Qt)Kt\u03b2(it(Mt),Qt)Et\u03b3(PPQEtt ,Qt)                                                   (4) \nand assuming: \nP Q                                                                        (5) \nL =L Qt t\nt 1 W\nt\nQ                                                                      (6) \nK =K t\nt 1it(Mt)\nP Q                                                                       (7) \nE =E Qt t\nt 1 P\nEt\nwhere \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 are the output elasticities of labor, capital, and energy, respectively, and assuming \ntheir summation is equal to one, meaning constant returns to scale.

AD is the aggregate demand curve and AS  stands for the aggregate supply curve. \n0\nAggregate supply curve has an upward sloping curve, which shows that at some real output \nlevel it becomes difficult to increase real output despite increases in the general level of prices. \nAt this output level, the economy achieves full employment.  \nSuppose that the initial equilibrium, pointAis below the full employment level. When the relative \nprice of energy resources (crude oil, natural gas, coal, etc.) increases, the aggregate supply \ncurve shifts to AS\u2032. The employment of existing labor and capital with a given nominal wage rate \nrequires  a  higher  general  price  for  output,  if  sufficient  amounts  of  the  higher-cost  energy \nresources are to be used.  \nThe productivity of existing capital and labor resources is reduced so that potential real output \ndeclines toQ. In addition, the same rate of labor employment occurs only if real wages decline \n1\nsufficiently to match the decline in productivity. This, in turn, happens only if the general level of \nprices, P , rises sufficiently given the nominal wage rate. This moves the economy to the level \nQ1\nof  output Q  and  price  level P . This  point  is  indicated  in  Figure  5  at  point B ,  which  is a \n1 Q1\ndisequilibrium  point.  Given  the  same  supply  of  labor  services  and  existing  plants  and \nequipment, the output associated with full employment declines as producers reduce their use \nof  relatively  more  expensive  energy  resources  and  as  plants  and  equipment  become \neconomically obsolete. \nOn the other hand, on the demand side of the economy, when the prices of energy resources \nrise, their consumption declines. Because of this drop in consumption, the aggregate demand \ncurve shifts toAD\u2032, which in turn decreases prices from their previous disequilibrium level at P  \nQ1\nand sets them tat P as the final equilibrium price. This lowers the output levels due to reduced \nQ2\n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nconsumption in the economy, from the previous point of Q toQ . This point is indicated in Figure \n1 2\n5 at pointC, which is the final equilibrium point.  \nThe economy may not adjust instantaneously to pointC, even if point C is the new equilibrium. \nFor example, price rigidities due to slow-moving information or other transactions costs can \nkeep nominal prices from adjusting quickly (Tatom 1981). Consequently, output and prices \nmove along an adjustment path such as that indicated by the arrow in Figure 5. \nIn  this  case,  aggregate  supply  is  the  main  chain  of  transmission  of  energy  price  shocks \ncompared to aggregate demand. This means that the supply side of the economy is more \naffected by oil price shocks than the demand side of the economy, resulting in higher prices and \nlower output levels at the final equilibrium point, C, when compared to the initial equilibrium \npoint A. If the demand side of the economy were the main transmission channel, the result \nwould be a decrease in output and lower price levels compared to the initial equilibrium point. \n4.  MODEL \nThe  main  objective  of  this  research  is  to  assess  and  compare  the  impact  of  the  price \nmovements of crude oil, the main energy resource, on GDP growth rates and CPI inflation rates \nof an emerging and two developed economies in a model incorporating monetary variables. In \ndeveloping this model we used Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino (2013a) as a reference. In their \nmodel, they assumed that oil price movements transfer to macro variables through either supply \n(the aggregate supply curve) or demand channels (the aggregate demand curve). In order to \nexamine the effects of this transfer, they used an IS curve to look at the demand side and a \nPhillips curve to analyze inflationary effects from the supply side. \nUsing this aforementioned research as inspiration, we chose to use the following variables in \nour survey: crude oil prices, natural gas prices, GDP, consumer price index (CPI), money \nsupply, and the exchange rate. We included the natural gas price because it is the main \nsubstitute energy source for crude oil. GDP and CPI are included in our variables mainly \nbecause their movements have an impact on the crude oil market (Taghizadeh-Hesary and \nYoshino 2013b, 2014), and also because our objective is to assess the impact of oil price \nfluctuations on these two macro variables.  \nThe money supply and the exchange rate are monetary policy variables that have an impact on \nthe  crude  oil  market  and  on  the  whole  economy.  Hence,  it  is  necessary  to  include  each \ncountry\u2019s money supply and the exchange rate in our analysis (Barsky and Kilian 2002; Leduc \nand  Sill  2004;  Hamilton  and  Herrera  2004;  Taghizadeh-Hesary  and  Yoshino  2014,  2015; \nYoshino and Taghizadeh 2014a).  \nTaghizadeh-Hesary  and  Yoshino  (2014)  explain  that  oil  prices  accelerated  from  about \n$35/barrel in 1981 to beyond $111/barrel in 2011. At the same time, interest rates (the federal \nfunds  rate)  subsided  from  16.7%  per  annum  to  about  0.1%.  By  running  a  simultaneous \nequations  model,  they  found  that  during  the  period  1980\u20132011,  global  oil  demand  was \nsignificantly influenced by monetary policy and supply actually remained constant. Aggressive \nmonetary policy stimulates oil demand, while supply is inelastic. The result is skyrocketing crude \n3\noil prices, which inhibit economic growth.  \n                                                \n3 Taghizadeh and Yoshino (2014), in order to define the determinants of crude oil prices, used two substitution \nsources for crude oil prices (natural gas prices and coal prices), two monetary policy factors (the exchange rate \nand interest rate) and GDP growth rate, which shows economic activity growth. In this present paper since we use \nan SVAR model, in order to avoid identification problems, we must use the minimum possible number of variables. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nYoshino  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  (2014)  examined  how  monetary  policy  affected  crude  oil \nprices after the subprime mortgage crisis. They found that after the subprime mortgage crisis, \nthe weaker exchange rate of the US dollar caused by the country\u2019s quantitative easing pushed \noil prices in US dollars upward over the period 2009\u20132012 by causing investors to invest in the \noil market and other commodity markets while the world economy was in recession in this \nperiod. This trend had the effect of imposing a longer recovery time on the global economy, as \noil has been shown to be one of the most important production inputs. \nFigure 6 depicts two monetary policy factors: base money and real effective exchange rate \nmovements along with crude oil price movements. It illustrates the base money growth rate \ntrend and the crude oil price movements during the period February 2007\u2013September 2013.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS \nAs mentioned earlier, the increase in oil prices that began in 2001, the sharp decline that \nfollowed the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, and the immediate recovery that was experienced \nshortly after have renewed interest in the effects of oil prices on the macroeconomy.  Following \nthe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, crude oil prices dropped from $133.11 in July 2008 to below \n$42.01 in December 2008, due to decreased global demand. Shortly after this drop, however, \nprices started to rise sharply again. In this paper, for this reason, we selected a period that \ncovers the significant fluctuations mentioned above. Because of the presence of a structural \n7\nbreak  in oil prices in July 2008, we divided our analysis into two subperiods, January 2000\u2013\nJuly 2008 and August 2008\u2013December 2013, and ran regressions for our SVAR for each of \nthese three countries during the two subperiods before and after the sub-prime mortgage crisis, \nthe event that caused the recent fluctuations in crude oil prices, then compared the findings.   \n5.1  Data Analysis \nIn order to reach a more realistic analysis, we express all variables in real terms. As for the oil \nprices, because each of these three oil importers are importing crude oil from various sources, \nhence for the crude oil prices, we used the simple average of three major oil price sources as in \nKorhonen and Ledyaeva (2010) and Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. (2013): Dubai crude oil prices in \nthe Tokyo market, Brent crude oil prices in the London market, and WTI crude oil prices in the \nNew York market, all in constant dollars and seasonally adjusted. Natural gas prices are in \nconstant dollars obtained using a simple average of three major natural gas prices: US Henry \nhub,  UK  National  Balancing  Point  (NBP)  and  Japanese  imported  LNG  average  prices, \nseasonally adjusted. The GDP of all three countries is in constant US dollars, fixed PPPs, \nseasonally adjusted. All of the three data series above were deflated by the US consumer price \nindex (CPI), as most crude oil, and natural gas markets are denominated in US dollars and the \n                                                \n5 For more information on exogeneity tests in structural systems with monetary applications, see Revankar and \nYoshino (1990). \n6 For the impact of the money supply on the exchange rates, see Yoshino, Kaji, and Asonuma (2012). \n7 In order to find the presence of structural changes throughout the period of our survey, we used the Chow test at \nvarious points where oil prices fluctuated significantly. The results confirm a structural break in July 2008, when \nglobal oil prices dropped sharply because of lower oil demand due to the recession following the financial crisis. As \na result we can determine two subperiods for our analysis: January 2000\u2013July 2008 and August 2008\u2013December \n2013. \n \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \namount of GDP for each country was also in US dollars. For the exchange rate in the PRC\u2019s \nSVAR, we used the yuan REER, for Japan we used the yen REER and for the US, we used the \nUS dollar REER (2005=100). As for the money supply, we used M2 for the PRC, Japan, and the \nUS for each country\u2019s SVAR.  From now on, whenever we refer to the price of crude oil, natural \ngas, and GDP, unless otherwise stated, we refer to their real values. Sources of data are \nInternational  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  (2013),  International  Financial  Statistics  (IFS)  2013, \nthe Energy Data and Modeling Center (EDMC) database of the Institute of Energy Economics, \nJapan (IEEJ), Monthly Energy Review of the US Department of Energy (DOE), and the Bank of \nJapan (BOJ) database. \nIn order to evaluate the stationarity of all series, we used an Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) \ntest for all series with intercept and trend. The results imply that with the exception of M2 for the \nUS and GDP for the PRC, which were stationary at the log level, all other variables are non-\nstationary at log level. However, when we applied the unit root test to the first difference of log-\nlevel variables with intercept and trend, we were able to reject the null hypothesis of unit roots \nfor each of the variables. These results suggest that the M2 for the PRC and Japan, the \nexchange rates of all three countries, Japanese and US GDP, crude oil prices, and natural gas \nprice  variables  all  contain  a  unit  root.  Once  the  unit  root  test  was  performed  and  it  was \ndiscovered that the variables are non-stationary in level and stationary in first differences, they \nwere integrated of order one.

However the size and magnitude of this impact varies for each country and for different \ntime periods. Below we interpret the sign, size, and magnitude of the contemporaneous impacts \nof crude oil price movements on GDP growth rates and on CPI inflation rates of these three \ncountries. \nThe PRC\u2019s elasticity of GDP growth rate and inflation rate to oil price movements did not \nchange after the 2008 financial crisis. Before the crisis, the elasticities of the country\u2019s GDP \ngrowth rate and inflation rate to crude oil price changes were -0.26 (significant) and 0.02 (non-\nsignificant), respectively, and after the crisis they were -0.27(non-significant) and 0.02 (non-\nsignificant). The main cause for this is the appreciation of the yuan. Slightly after the sub-prime \nmortgage  crisis,  oil  prices  started  to  increase  sharply.  This  happened  because  of  a  mild \nrecovery in the global economy and huge quantitative easing (QE) policies by the US and other \ncountries\u2019 monetary authorities (Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2014a). At the same time, the \nyuan appreciated compared to other currencies, which means that the price of crude oil in the \nPRC\u2019s domestic market did not fluctuate much. The result was that both before and after the \ncrisis, the impact of crude oil prices on the PRC\u2019s economy (GDP and inflation) was almost \nconstant.  \nThere are several earlier studies on the impact of oil shocks on the PRC\u2019s economy that match \nour results (Zaouali 2007; Tang, Wu, and Zhang 2010; Du, Yanan, and Wei 2010). The PRC\u2019s \noil consumption doubled over the past decade because of the country\u2019s high economic growth, \nwhich required large amounts of energy. In addition, the PRC is the second largest consumer of \noil in the world behind the US. It has high energy intensity, and the energy consumption per \n$1,000 GDP in 2007 was 0.57 tons of oil equivalent, higher than that of Germany (0.09), Japan \n(0.12), and the US (0.17).  \nJapan\u2019s elasticity of GDP growth rate to oil price fluctuations became negative after the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, at \u20130.1 (significant). The reason for this is that in the wake of the Fukushima \nnuclear incident in March 2011, oil remains the largest source of primary energy in Japan. The \ndisaster made the country fully dependent on imports of fossil products, especially crude oil. \nJapan spent $250 billion on total fuel imports in 2012, a third of the country\u2019s total import charge.  \nBefore the crisis, in the first subperiod, the elasticity of the Japanese GDP growth rate to crude \noil price movements was positive, at 0.03 (significant). Worldwide increases in oil prices have \nhad a positive effect on Japan\u2019s GDP. These findings are also in accordance with those of \nJim\u00e9nez-Rodr\u00edguez  and  S\u00e1nchez  (2004),  Blanchard  and  Gal\u00ed  (2007),  Kilian  (2008b),  and \nTaghizadeh-Hesary et al. (2013), who all conclude that Japan has fared relatively well in the \nface of recent exogenous oil price shocks. However the findings by Korhonen and Ledyaeva \n(2010) for Japan are the reverse, as they observed negative impacts of oil shocks on GDP. This \npositive  elasticity  exists  due  to  several  reasons,  such  as  increased  energy  efficiency, \naccumulating huge strategic reserves of crude oil, declining crude oil demand stemming from \nstructural factors like fuel substitution (the use of nuclear electric power and natural gas), and \npopulation decline. Another reason is that in first subperiod, although crude oil prices saw huge \nincreases, because of appreciation of the yen, resulting from accumulated foreign reserves in \nthe country, energy prices in the domestic market did not increase much.  \nAs for the elasticity of CPI inflation to crude oil price growth rates, in the first subperiod the value \nwas 0.03 (significant), but became negative after the crisis (\u20130.01, non-significant). The reason \nfor this negative impact on prices is that in Japan, aggregate supply (AS) is almost constant. \nHigher energy prices mainly affect the demand side of the economy. This is clearly evident in \nthe second subperiod, shortly following the uncertain situation that occurred in the country after \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nthe  Fukushima  nuclear  disaster.  This  uncertainty  caused  domestic  consumption  to  shrink, \nresulting in price deflation. \nOur empirical results show that the US economy in both periods was affected by oil prices, \nwhich is in line with several papers (Hamilton 1983, 2005; Blanchard and Gali 2007; Kilian \n2008b).  The absolute value of the US elasticity of GDP growth rate to oil price growth rate was \nreduced following the 2008 financial crisis because of lower aggregate demand in the country, \ncaused by recession. Moreover, the impact of higher oil prices on inflation decreased in the \nsecond period because of lower aggregate demand.  \nThe impact of oil price fluctuations on US and Japanese GDP is much milder than for the PRC. \nHowever, the PRC\u2019s CPI sees smoother rates of inflation in oil shocks compared to the US and \nJapan because of the higher growth rate in the PRC\u2019s economy, which shifts the AS curve \nforward and avoids higher prices in oil shocks. In Japan\u2019s case, the AS curve has been almost \nconstant recently, and in the US is seeing only a small forward shift. \nFigure 8 compares energy intensities in the PRC, Japan, and the US and is evidence for our \nfinding that the PRC\u2019s GDP is more responsive to oil price fluctuations GDP for the US and \nJapan. Energy intensity measures the amount of energy (total primary energy consumption) a \ncountry needs to generate a unit of GDP. \nFigure 8: Energy Intensity, 1980\u20132011 \n \nBtu = British thermal units.  \nNote: Total primary energy consumption per US dollar of GDP (Btu per year, 2005 US dollars [market exchange rates]). \nSource: US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Independent Statistics & Analysis, International Energy Statistics \nhttp://www.eia.gov/beta/international/ (retrieved Sep 21, 2015). \nAs is clear, although for the case of the PRC energy intensity has decreased over the last 3 \ndecades, several reasons explain this decline: faster growth of GDP than energy demand, the \nservices  sector  having  a  growing  share  of  the  economy,  and  energy  efficiency  programs. \nHowever, while the PRC\u2019s energy intensity decreased significantly, it is still much higher than \nthe US and Japan\u2019s. There are several reasons behind this large gap that can be summarized in \n8\nenergy conservation.  \n                                                \n8 Energy conservation means decreasing the quantity of energy used without any change in output. \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \n6.  CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we analyzed the impact of oil price fluctuations on two macro variables of two \ndeveloped countries and one emerging country. The purpose is to compare the response of \ncountries in these two groups to oil price fluctuations. For our analysis, we selected a period that \nincludes the most recent financial crisis: the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007\u20132008. This \nmeans that we simultaneously compared the impacts in the period January 2000\u2013July 2008 with \nthe period following the crisis, August 2008\u2013December 2013. \nOur results show that the impacts of oil price fluctuations on GDP growth rates in developed oil \nimporters  (US  and  Japan)  are  much  milder  than  for  an  emerging  economy\u2019s  (PRC).  The \nreasons for the difference between the impacts on these two groups are: high fuel substitution \n(higher use of nuclear electric power, gas, and renewables), a declining population (for the case \nof  Japan),  the  shale  gas  revolution  (for  the  US),  greater  strategic  crude  oil  stocks  and \ngovernment-mandated energy efficiency targets in the two developed economies compared with \nthe emerging economy, which make them more resistant to oil shocks. On the other hand, the \nimpact of higher crude oil prices on the PRC\u2019s CPI inflation is milder than in the two advanced \neconomies. The reason for this is that a higher economic growth rate in the PRC results in a \nlarger forward shift of aggregate supply, which avoids large increases in price levels after oil \nprice shocks. \nBy comparing the results of these two subperiods, we conclude that in the second subperiod the \nimpact of oil price fluctuations on the US GDP growth rate and inflation rate was milder than in \nthe first subperiod, because of lower crude oil and aggregate demand resulting from a recession \nin  the  economy.  For  Japan,  the  second  subperiod  coincides  with  the  Fukushima  nuclear \ndisaster that followed the massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 and raised the \ndependency on oil imports. Hence, the elasticity of GDP growth to oil price fluctuations rose \ndrastically.  CPI  elasticity  decreased,  however,  because  of  diminished  consumption,  which \nresulted from uncertainty in the nation\u2019s future after the devastating disaster. The PRC\u2019s GDP \ngrowth  and  inflation  rate  elasticities  to  oil  price  fluctuations  were  almost  constant  in  both \nsubperiods. The main reason for this is appreciation of the yuan. Slightly after the sub-prime \nmortgage crisis, oil prices started to increase sharply due to a mild recovery in the global \neconomy and huge quantitative easing (QE) policies in the US and by monetary authorities in \nother countries. Simultaneously, the yuan appreciated compared to other currencies, which \nmeans the price of crude oil in the PRC\u2019s domestic market did not fluctuate as much. The result \nis that before and after the crisis, the impact of crude oil prices on the PRC\u2019s economy (GDP \nand inflation) was almost constant.  \n \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 546                                 Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino \n \nREFERENCES* \nBarsky, R.
