Yet the global backdrop in 2012 is one of uncertainty: \nthe eurozone is grappling with its sovereign debt crisis; and more \ngenerally, stagnation in the major industrial economies of the United \nStates, Europe, and Japan\u2014developing Asia\u2019s main trading partners\u2014\nis stunting demand for Asia\u2019s products. For these reasons, the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook 2012 forecasts that growth in developing Asia will \nease to 6.9% in 2012 (from 7.2% in 2011) before coming back to 7.3% in 2013. \nDeveloping Asia will have to adjust to lower export demand from \nthe advanced economies for some time to come. These economies are \nexpected to expand by just 1.1% in 2012 and 1.7% in 2013, as austerity \nmeasures, fiscal consolidation, and weak private domestic demand stall \ntheir growth for the next 2\u00a0years\u2014at least. Increased local demand in \nAsia has offset some of this lost trade, but it will need to take up more of \nthe slack.\nFortunately, the commodity price pressures that built up in early 2011 \nare subsiding. Inflation in the region is expected to slow to 4.7% in 2012 \nand 4.4% in 2013. Political instability in the Middle East, however, could \nlead to sudden cuts in oil supplies, resulting in temporary spikes in the \nprice of this critical commodity and reviving inflation in developing Asia.\nThe greatest risk to Asia\u2019s enviable growth rates in the near term is \nthe sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. Although a second international \nbailout of Greece in March 2012 prevented a disorderly default and \ndiminished the risk of a liquidity crunch in the short run, the crisis is \nfar from over\u2014and the eurozone is teetering on the brink of recession. \nEurope\u2019s problems are having global repercussions, but Asia is fairly well \nplaced to weather the storm. \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s policy makers cannot, however, be complacent. \nThey need to be ready to respond if the eurozone deteriorates, particularly \nas global value chains\u2014Asia\u2019s growth-generating cross-border production \nnetworks\u2014and sudden reductions in trade finance can magnify an \nexternal shock.\nEven if a major external risk to the forecasts materializes, developing \nAsia has some scope for macroeconomic policy responses. Since the last \nglobal crisis eased, budget deficits have been narrowed, policy interest \nrates have been raised, and regional and global safety nets for liquidity \nsupport have been strengthened.\nThe eurozone crisis highlights the need for developing Asia to \nrebalance its economies toward domestic and regional demand and from \ndependence on exports destined for advanced countries. It also provides \nadded urgency to efforts to broaden and deepen regional cooperation, \nreduce trade barriers, and promote intraregional trade.", "vi    Foreword\nOf perhaps greater threat to developing Asia\u2019s long-term growth and \nstability is the widening disparity in the region between the \u201chaves\u201d and \n\u201chave nots\u201d\u2014an issue of growing concern explored in this year\u2019s theme \nchapter. Despite the region\u2019s rapid growth, the last two decades have \nwitnessed widening income disparities. Most people in the region\u2014about \nfour-fifths of them\u2014live in countries that are becoming more unequal.\nInequitable access to new technology, education, infrastructure, and \ninvestment are fueling the divide, particularly between rural and urban \nareas and between coastal and inland provinces. Bridging this growing \ngap is essential to promote inclusive growth, and to make growth \nsustainable. The social and political consequences of an Asia left to divide \nitself by wealth can no longer be ignored.\nIt is time for governments in Asia to focus on policies that share the \nbenefits of development fairly, and that maintain healthy growth rates. \nThese policies include fiscal policy enhancements such as increases in \nspending on education and health, conditional cash transfers for the \npoor, and more equitable revenue mobilization; more investment in \ninfrastructure to reduce imbalances between developed and lagging areas; \nand employment-friendly measures to encourage the creation of high-\nquality jobs.\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nThe Asian Development Outlook 2012 was prepared by the staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) from the Central and West Asia Department, East \nAsia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, Southeast \nAsia Department, Economics and Research Department, as well as resident \nmissions.

Regional \npolicy makers need to ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared.", "x    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\nKey messages\n\u2022\nDespite the weak global environment, developing Asia\u2019s growth momentum \ncontinues. The region\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will cool \nsomewhat to 6.9% in 2012, from 7.2% in 2011, and then edge back up to 7.3% \nin 2013. The region is generally adjusting toward a more sustainable long-run \ngrowth path. \n\u2022\nStrong domestic demand provided necessary support in 2011, and this will \nneed to continue in light of the soft export demand expected from the \nmajor industrial economies of the United States (US), eurozone, and Japan. \nCollectively, they are expected to expand by only 1.1% in 2012 and 1.7% in 2013.\n\u2022\nThe greatest risk to the outlook is the continued uncertainty over resolving \nthe sovereign debt problems in the eurozone. The \u201corderly default\u201d on Greece\u2019s \ndebt in March 2012 diminished the risk of a liquidity crunch in the short run, \nbut calls for fiscal austerity across the eurozone will act as a drag on growth. \n\u2022\nThe effects on developing Asia\u2019s financial stability and trade flows can be \nmanaged if there are no future shocks, but policy makers need to be ready \nto respond if the eurozone situation worsens. Global value chains\u2014the cross-\nborder production networks of developing Asia\u2014and sudden reductions in \ntrade finance tend to magnify external shocks.\n\u2022\nEven if a major external risk to the forecasts materializes, developing Asia \nhas some scope for a macroeconomic policy response. Although the policy \nstimulus that it adopted in response to the global economic crisis has used \nup some of its policy space, the region has since regained some of that space. \nBudget deficits have come down, policy interest rates have been raised, and \nregional and global safety nets for liquidity support have been strengthened.\n\u2022\nIn the absence of further global shocks, there is no clear case for developing Asia \nto make short-term countercyclical macroeconomic policy responses. The gap \nbetween potential production and the actual level of output in most developing \nAsian economies\u2014unlike the advanced economies\u2014is not large enough to \nwarrant aggressive stimulus measures. Instead, policy makers may need to focus \non maintaining price stability while sustaining the growth momentum. \n\u2022\nInflation is not an immediate threat for most regional economies\u2014decelerating \ninternational commodity price rises from late 2011 have eased some of the \npressures. Consumer prices in developing Asia are forecast to rise by 4.6% \nin 2012 and 4.4% in 2013, down from 5.9% in 2011. However, the unstable \ngeopolitical situation in the Middle East could trigger further oil price spikes, \nreviving inflation in developing Asia.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xi\n\u2022\nMany economies had been normalizing their accommodative monetary policy \nin early 2011, but they stopped or even reversed the process in the second half, \nas uncertainties in the major industrial countries damped global demand, and \nas pressures from international commodity price rises eased. If inflationary \npressures build again and capital inflows resume, there may be a need to \nreadjust monetary policy to maintain price stability.\n\u2022\nVolatile capital flows remain a concern. Widely shifting risk perceptions among \nforeign investors in 2011 affected capital flows to developing Asia as funds \nflowed out toward risk-free assets. If changing investor sentiment causes large \nswings in capital flows again\u2014building up inflationary pressures or making \nexchange rates more volatile\u2014policy makers have various measures of \ncapital flow management at their disposal, but such measures need regional \ncoordination to be effective. Greater exchange rate flexibility may also damp \nspeculative capital movements.\n\u2022\nFiscal policy must balance the pursuit of long-term macroeconomic stability \nand support for growth. Debt-to-GDP ratios spiked in the region after the \nmassive fiscal responses to the global crisis, but they are now trending \ndownward, although lower growth or higher interest rates could quickly \nundermine this position. Moreover, the region faces additional sources of fiscal \nstrain in the years ahead, such as adjusting to aging populations and building \nadequate social safety nets.\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s economies need to push through growth-supportive \nexpenditure policies without undermining their fiscal positions. They can \ndo this by adjusting the composition of government expenditure toward \neducation, health, and social safety nets and by expanding expenditure \nalongside revenue enhancements. Such shifts in fiscal policy will be \nincreasingly important as the region confronts rising income inequality while \nfostering continued economic expansion.\n\u2022\nIn the last two decades, income disparities widened in the \n11 economies that account for more than four-fifths of the region\u2019s population. \nRising inequality can damp the poverty impact of economic growth, and even \nundermine the basis of growth itself.\n\u2022\nThe forces of technological progress, globalization, and market-oriented \nreform\u2014the primary drivers of the region\u2019s rapid growth\u2014are putting a wedge \nbetween the incomes of the rich and poor. These factors tend to favor owners \nof capital over labor, high-skilled over low-skilled workers, and urban and \ncoastal centers over rural and inland areas.\n\u2022\nPolicy makers must meet the challenge of rising inequality without hindering \nfuture growth. They can do this through policies that put in place efficient \nfiscal measures, that promote regional balance, and that make growth more \nemployment friendly.", "xii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s outlook\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s growth is feeling the effects of weak global demand. \nExpansion in the region\u2019s GDP moderated to 7.2% in 2011 from 2010\u2019s post\u2013\nglobal crisis rebound of 9.1%. Growth in developing Asia is expected to ease \nfurther to 6.9% in 2012 before coming back to 7.3% in 2013. These growth \nprojections are still strong compared with other regions of the world, and are \npart of the adjustment toward a more sustainable long-run growth path in the \nmore advanced regional economies.\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s main trading partners have yet to return to their \nprecrisis growth rates. Growth in the major industrial countries of the US, \neurozone, and Japan was subdued in 2011, with GDP growing collectively by \na disappointing 1.2%. Their prospects are also uninspiring, with growth set to \nstall at 1.1% in 2012 before gaining some lift to 1.7% in 2013. Fiscal consolidation \nefforts and insipid private domestic demand growth will stay a drag on these \neconomies, and the slipstream from the eurozone\u2019s sovereign debt crisis is \nbuffeting that bloc back into recession. Developing Asia should expect relatively \nweak demand for its exports from these three economies in the near term.\n\u2022\nThat is why domestic demand, which is providing increasing support for \nthe region\u2019s producers, is welcome. Private consumption continues to be \na major factor in the region\u2019s growth. Yet investment weakened appreciably \ntoward end-2011, weighing on the outlook for the coming quarters, particularly \nfor export-led economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong \nKong, China; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; and Taipei,China.\n\u2022\nThe shift toward domestic demand is apparent in further declines in \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s current account surplus. The surplus continued to narrow \nto 2.6% of GDP in 2011 from 4.0% in 2010, reflecting moderating demand for \nexports, solid domestic demand pushing imports upward, and higher prices for \nimported oil and commodities. Steady, real exchange rate appreciation in many \nregional economies has supported this shift. The current account surplus is \nforecast to be trimmed further in 2012 to 1.9% of GDP, given continued growth \nin import demand in most economies while exports face soft global demand.\n\u2022\nInflation is set to recede, but volatile commodity prices are a potential \nthreat. Higher food and fuel prices drove up inflation in developing Asia to \n5.9% in 2011 from 4.4% in 2010. With relatively stable (but elevated) oil prices, \nsome respite offered by easing food prices, and lower demand for the region\u2019s \nexports, inflation in the region is forecast to slow to 4.6% in 2012 and 4.4% in \n2013. However, continued instability in the Middle East, including threats of oil \nsupply disruptions, could lead to another round of temporary price spikes, in \nturn fanning the embers of inflation in developing Asia.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xiii\n\u2022\nVolatile capital flows remain a concern. Net capital inflows to developing \nAsia increased from the second half of 2010 and into the first half of 2011. \nThe PRC was the main beneficiary of the influx, much in the form of foreign \ndirect investment. At the onset of the eurozone turmoil and the ratings \ndowngrade of US long-term sovereign credit in the second half of 2011, \nglobal investors sharply curtailed their risk appetite. Consequently, regional \ncapital inflows slowed, even switching to outflows for some countries. \nMajor industrial countries are likely to maintain accommodative monetary \npolicies over the forecast period, and so policy makers in developing Asia \nwill need to be prepared for potentially large swings in capital flows based \non fluctuations in global investors\u2019 risk appetites.\nEurozone uncertainties and developing Asia\n\u2022\nContinued uncertainties in the eurozone present the greatest risk \nto the global outlook. Despite recent progress easing the eurozone\u2019s \nsovereign debt problems somewhat, the weaker growth momentum in \nEurope poses risks. The voluntary private sector participation agreement \nreached in March 2012 helped restructure Greece\u2019s government debt, \nthus removing the immediate risk of a disorderly default that could \nhave sparked a global liquidity crisis. As the nature of the primary risk \nto developing Asia has shifted from financial contagion to slower export \ngrowth, developing Asia\u2019s policy makers need to prepare for the possibility \nof an extended period of low European demand for exports.\n\u2022\nIn the absence of any sudden shocks, the effects on developing Asia\u2019s \nfinancial stability and trade flows can be managed. The region\u2019s direct \nexposure to eurozone banks is relatively small, and reserves are sufficient to \ncover short-term external debt repayments, helping shield the region from \nfinancial contagion. The region is more vulnerable to the risk of a trade \nshock, the main channel through which Asia was affected by the global \nfinancial crisis. Europe is a key export market for Asia, and will remain so \nin the near future despite its declining share in recent years. But as long as \nthe slowdown is confined to the eurozone\u2014as opposed to a synchronized \nadvanced-country recession\u2014developing Asia should be able to absorb \nthe impact of lower export demand.\n\u2022\nIf the situation in the eurozone worsens to the extent of undermining \nglobal recovery, developing Asia\u2019s policy makers need to be prepared \nto act quickly. Recent history shows that two areas in particular\u2014global \nvalue chains and trade finance\u2014interact with an external trade shock to \nintensify its impact.\n\u00bb\nGlobal value chains\u2014the production model behind East and \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s export success\u2014amplify external shocks. The \n2008\u20132009 global trade collapse highlighted this vulnerability, as \nexternal demand for final goods dried up and the impact rippled \nthrough the region\u2019s supply chains. Asia\u2019s export production structure ", "xiv    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\nand demand sources have changed little since then, and a steep drop in \nfinal goods demand from the major industrial countries would still strongly \ncompress aggregate demand for exports throughout the region. This \nvulnerability underscores the need to diversify the destinations for the \nregion\u2019s final goods and to accelerate the shift to more reliance on domestic \ndemand.\n\u00bb \nTrade finance shortages exacerbate the impact of an export demand \nshock that is accompanied by a credit squeeze. Trade finance is generally \nshort term and low risk, and in noncrisis periods mainly takes the form of \ncredits between firms. But during a severe crisis, these interfirm credits may \ndry up, raising firms\u2019 need for bank lending. However, the deleveraging of \nEuropean banks, which are traditionally active in supporting trade in Asia, \ncould cut into the supply of trade finance. In addition, Basel III regulations \ncould skew bank incentives away from trade finance. Policy makers may \nneed to pay special attention to trade finance when credit is squeezed, \nespecially for small and medium-sized enterprises.\nResponding to the unsettled global environment\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia has some scope for a macroeconomic policy response if a \nmajor downside risk to the outlook materializes.\nThe stimulus measures adopted in response to the global crisis were \na departure from the prudent fiscal and monetary policy that regional \nauthorities had generally pursued. Budget deficits, though not back to precrisis \nlevels, have narrowed and policy interest rates have been raised, providing \nroom for a new policy response if needed. Further, regional and global safety \nnets for liquidity support have been strengthened.\n\u2022\nHowever, there is no clear case for a short-term countercyclical policy \nresponse to the current global economic environment. Although the \nslowdown in Europe is putting a brake on the region\u2019s growth, the impact \nis manageable. Output gaps of most Asian economies, unlike the advanced \neconomies\u2019, are not large enough to warrant aggressive countercyclical \nsupport. \n\u2022\nThe region can fine-tune monetary policy to support growth while \nkeeping a focus on stabilizing inflationary expectations. In the face of \ninflationary pressures, the relatively accommodative monetary policy that \nbegan in late 2008 was tightened until mid-2011. However, in the second half of \nthe year, many countries stopped\u2014and in some cases reversed\u2014the course of \nmonetary tightening as uncertainties in the major industrial countries damped \nglobal demand and pressures from international commodity price rises eased. \nIf inflationary pressures build again and capital inflows resume, there may be a \nneed to readjust monetary policy to maintain price stability.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xv\n\u2022\nForeign capital flows will need to be managed to mitigate the impact of \ntheir fluctuations. Investors\u2019 assessments of global market risks swung widely \nafter the onset of the global crisis in 2008, and the continued global economic \nuncertainty suggests that moves may be similarly volatile in the forecast \nperiod. If large swings of capital flows to the region reoccur, various measures \nof capital flow management may be deployed, but they require regional \ncoordination to be effective. Greater exchange rate flexibility may also help \ndeter speculative capital flows. \n\u2022\nFiscal policy must balance the pursuit of long-term macroeconomic \nstability with support to growth momentum. Debt-to-GDP ratios in the \nregion spiked due to the fiscal response to the global crisis, but they are \nnow generally on a downward path. However, governments have no room \nfor complacency, since sustained falling debt ratios depend on continued \nfavorable growth and interest rates, which are subject to sudden reversal in the \ncase of a renewed global economic downturn or a financial crisis. Moreover, \nthe region faces additional sources of fiscal strain in the years ahead, such as \nadjusting to aging populations and building adequate social safety nets.\n\u2022\nGrowth-supportive expenditure policies can be achieved without \nundermining fiscal positions. This can be done with budget-neutral measures \nthat shift the composition of government spending to education, health, \nand social safety nets, and by expanding expenditure alongside revenue \nenhancements. Such shifts in fiscal policy will be increasingly important as the \nregion confronts rising income inequality while fostering continued economic \nexpansion\u2014an issue analyzed in the theme chapter of Asian Development \nOutlook 2012.", "xvi    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\nOutlook by subregion\n\u2022\nGlobal factors have given way to country-specific issues in developing \nAsia\u2019s outlook. In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in \nthe third quarter of 2008, most regional economies were affected by the \nsharp drop in global demand and subsequent recovery. But as the global \nenvironment has become less volatile\u2014although growth is still slower than \nbefore the global crisis\u2014country- or subregion-specific shocks are playing a \nbigger role, leading to wider variation among economic trends at those levels. \nFactors include natural disasters, the availability of resources, and the strength \nof domestic demand.\n\u2022\nEast Asia\u2019s growth will moderate to 7.4% in 2012 but will still lead the \nother subregions. Growth has decelerated markedly since the 9.8% rebound \nin 2010, dropping to 8.0% in 2011 as the deteriorating global outlook in the \nsecond half of 2011 affected directly the contribution to growth of net exports \nand indirectly investment and consumption. An uptick to 7.7% is forecast for \n2013. Growth for the PRC is forecast to moderate to 8.5% and 8.7% in the next \n2 years (though this still exceeds the growth envisaged in the 12th Five-Year \nPlan). East Asia\u2019s inflation is forecast to slow to 3.7% in the next 2 years. \nThe exception is Mongolia, where double-digit rates will prevail as surging \ngovernment and private spending boosts domestic demand.\n\u2022\nSouth Asia will see growth improve a shade in 2012 to 6.6%. Growth in 2011 \nfell sharply to 6.4%, mainly reflecting slumping investment and India\u2019s marked \nmonetary tightening in the face of persistent inflation. Growth in Pakistan \ndeclined because of disastrous flooding, while Bangladesh and Sri Lanka did \nwell on brisk exports. The pace of India\u2019s growth is projected to edge up to \n7.0% in 2012 and 7.5% in 2013, providing most of the lift for subregional growth \nto reach 7.1% in 2013. Pakistan\u2019s growth will advance only slightly in both years \nbecause electricity will remain a bottleneck on the supply side. South Asia\u2019s \ninflation is expected to fall from 9.4% last year to 7.7% in 2012 and further to \n6.9% in 2013. Some cutbacks in the heavy fuel and electricity subsidies in most \ncountries are expected, and will set a floor to how far inflation can fall. \n\u2022\nGrowth in Southeast Asia for 2012 is seen picking up to 5.2%. Overall \nGDP growth decelerated to 4.6% in 2011, as Southeast Asia was hard hit by \nweakened export markets, domestic policy tightening, and natural disasters \nthat disrupted trade and production\u2014only partly redeemed by strong growth \nin the subregion\u2019s largest economy, Indonesia. The pickup in growth in 2012 \nlargely reflects recovery in Thailand from major flooding as its growth rate \nrebounds from 0.1% in 2011 to 5.5% in 2012. Subregional growth is forecast to \nclimb to 5.7% in 2013. Indonesia will continue its solid growth performance, \nexpanding by 6.4% in 2012 and 6.7% in 2013. Higher food and fuel prices drove \nup aggregate inflation to 5.5% in 2011, but assumed relatively steady global oil \nprices and easing food prices in 2012 seem likely to slow inflation to 4.4% over \nthe next 2 years.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xvii\n\u2022\nCentral Asia should just about keep up the momentum at 6.1% in \n2012 and 6.2% in 2013. This year\u2019s outturn reflects the combination of a \nweak eurozone and slower growth in the Russian Federation, offset by a \nbounceback in growth in Azerbaijan. In 2011, strong demand for petroleum \nboosted growth in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, but Azerbaijan\u2019s minimal \ngrowth, due to temporary closure of some oil production facilities, dragged \ndown the subregional rate. Inflation accelerated in 2011 to 9.0%, mainly on \nrapid increases in world fuel and food prices. More moderate food price \ninflation and expected stable oil prices are seen helping slow inflation to \n7.2% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013. \n\u2022\nThe Pacific economies are relatively insulated from developments in \nthe eurozone. Robust expansion in the resource-exporting economies \nof Papua New Guinea (which accounts for roughly 60% of Pacific GDP), \nTimor-Leste, and Solomon Islands, and strong growth in the tourism-\noriented economies of the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, and Vanuatu, lifted \nsubregional growth to 7.0% in 2011\u2014making this the only subregion to \npost faster growth in 2011 than 2010. Yet the Pacific is forecast to slow to \n6.0% and 4.1% over the next 2 years due to lower resource export revenue, \nthe winding down of infrastructure projects that stimulated growth in 2011 \n(Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu), lower international \nagricultural prices, and flooding impacts (Fiji). Inflation is expected to fall to \n6.6% in 2012 from 8.6% in 2011.", "xviii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\nSpecial theme: Confronting rising inequality in Asia\nAsia\u2019s rising inequality\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s impressive growth continues, but is paced by a new \nchallenge\u2014inequality on the rise. Over the last few decades, the region \nhas lifted people out of poverty at an unprecedented rate. But more recent \nexperience contrasts with the \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d story that characterized \nthe transformation of the newly industrialized economies in the 1960s and \n1970s. In the 11 economies that account for more than four-fifths of the region\u2019s \npopulation, income disparities expanded during the last two decades\u2014despite \nthe region\u2019s world-beating performance in raising average incomes and \nreducing poverty.\n\u00bb\nInequality widened in 11 of the 28 economies with comparable data, \nincluding the three most populous countries and drivers of the region\u2019s \nrapid growth\u2014the PRC, India, and Indonesia. From the early 1990s to \nthe late 2000s, the Gini coefficient\u2014a common measure of inequality\u2014\nworsened from 32 to 43 in the PRC, from 33 to 37 in India, and from 29 to 39 \nin Indonesia. Treating developing Asia as a single unit, its Gini coefficient \nwent from 39 to 46 in that period.\n\u00bb\nAlthough Asia\u2019s inequality levels are generally below those in other \ndeveloping regions\u2014the average Gini coefficient across developing Asian \neconomies was 37 compared with an average of 52 for Latin American \neconomies\u2014incomes are becoming more equitable elsewhere. \n\u2022\nInequality of opportunity is also prevalent in developing Asia. Disparities \nin the means to raise one\u2019s living standards\u2014such as physical assets (e.g., \ncapital and land), human capital (e.g., education and health), and market \naccess (e.g., labor and finance)\u2014are common. Unequal access to public \nservices, especially education and health, is central to generating inequality of \nopportunity. National household surveys conducted in the mid- to late 2000s \nrevealed many facets of diverging opportunities:\n\u00bb\nSchool-age children from households in the poorest income quintile were \nthree to five times as likely to be out of primary and secondary school as \ntheir peers in the richest quintile in some countries. The situation was even \nmore dire for tertiary education where poorer college-age individuals were \n10\u201320 times more likely not to attend college than their better-off peers.\n\u00bb\nInfant mortality rates among the poorest households in some countries \nwere double or treble the rates among the richest households. In the most \nextreme examples, the chance of a poor infant dying at birth was more \nthan 10 times higher than for an infant born to a rich family. \n\u00bb\nWith few exceptions, the region\u2019s economies have made significant progress \ntoward gender parity in primary and secondary education. Yet high gender \ndisparities in tertiary education remain in South Asia and the Pacific.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xix\n\u2022\nInequality of opportunity is a crucial factor in widening income inequality \nin developing Asia. Moreover, these two forms of inequality can lead to a \nvicious circle as unequal opportunities create income disparities, which in turn \nlead to differences in future opportunities for individuals and households.\nWhy inequality matters\n\u2022\nRising inequality can damp the poverty impact of economic growth. If \ninequality had remained stable in the Asian economies where it increased, the \nsame growth in 1990\u20132010 would have taken about 240 million more people \nout of poverty\u2014equivalent to 6.5% of developing Asia\u2019s population in 2010 \nand 8.0% of those countries with rising inequality.\n\u2022\nInequality can weaken the basis of growth itself. High and rising inequality \ncan curb medium-term growth by reducing social cohesion, undermining the \nquality of governance, and increasing pressure for inefficient populist policies.\n\u2022\nAsian policy makers are becoming more concerned about inequality. In \nan informal, web-based survey of Asian policy makers in January\u2013February \n2012, over 65% of respondents agreed that income inequality in their countries \nwas high or very high. Almost all felt that incomes in their countries were \nbecoming more unequal. Moreover, a majority believed that success in \nreducing poverty was insufficient to justify widening inequality. This concern is \nincreasingly being addressed through development plans across the region, as \nthey include explicit goals to make growth more inclusive.\nDrivers of inequality\n\u2022\nTechnological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014the \nprimary drivers of the region\u2019s growth\u2014are the key forces behind the \nrise in inequality. These forces combined have opened new opportunities \nfor economies to prosper, but have not benefited all people equally. Together, \nthese drivers explain not only the increase in overall inequality, but also the \nsharply rising incomes of the very rich in some countries.\n\u2022\nThese forces affect income differences through three channels: capital, \nskill, and spatial bias. The bias toward physical capital reduces labor\u2019s share \nof national income while increasing the income share of the owners of capital. \nSimilarly, the heightened demand for better skilled workers raises the premium \non their earnings. And spatial disparities are becoming more acute: locations \nwith superior infrastructure, market access, and scale economies\u2014such as \nurban centers and coastal areas\u2014are better able to benefit from changing \ncircumstances.\n\u00bb\nLabor\u2019s share of total income is falling in many economies in the region. \nBetween the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, labor income as a share of \nmanufacturing output in the formal sector fell from 48% to 42% in the PRC \nand from 37% to 22% in India. The employment intensity of growth in Asia \nis lower than the global average and has declined in recent decades.", "xx    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\u00bb \nDifferences in educational attainment can explain 25%\u201335% of inequality \nbetween households in many regional economies, and the earnings \npremium for skills and tertiary education has increased in recent years.\n\u00bb \nThe combined contribution of rural\u2013urban and interprovincial differences \nto total inequality ranges from 13% in Sri Lanka to 54% in the PRC. The gaps \nbetween urban and rural incomes in developing Asia have increased, as \nhave those between prosperous and lagging areas.\nPolicy priorities for confronting rising inequality\n\u2022\nBecause the forces behind rising inequality are also the engines of \nproductivity and income growth, policy makers should not hinder \ntheir progress. A distinction needs to be made between the income \ndifferences that arise as economies take advantage of the new opportunities \nof technology, trade, and efficiency-enhancing reforms; and those that are \ngenerated by unequal access to market opportunities and public services. This \nlatter source of inequality requires a policy response since it gets magnified by \nthe forces, leads to inefficiency, and undermines the sustainability of growth.\n\u2022\nGovernments can address rising inequalities through several policy \nchannels, three of which are highlighted in the theme chapter:\n\u00bb\nEfficient fiscal policies. These include: \n\u25c6 spending more on education  and health, especially for poorer \nhouseholds;\n\u25c6 developing and spending more on better targeted social protection \nschemes, including conditional cash transfers that target income to the \npoorest but also incentivize the buildup of human capital; \n\u25c6 reducing or eliminating general price subsidies (such as on fuel) and \ncompensating the impact on the poor by targeted transfers; and \n\u25c6 broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration for \ngreater and more equitable revenue mobilization.\n\u00bb\nInterventions to improve regional balance. These include:\n\u25c6 improving transport and communications networks between \ndeveloped and poor regions; \n\u25c6 creating growth poles in lagging areas; \n\u25c6 using fiscal transfers to poorer areas in order to accelerate investment \nin human capital and improve access to public services there; and\n\u25c6 removing barriers to within-country migration.\n\u00bb\nPolicies to make growth more employment friendly. These include:\n\u25c6 encouraging structural transformation to create a greater number of \nproductive jobs, and maintaining a balanced sectoral composition of \ngrowth between manufacturing, services, and agriculture;\n\u25c6 supporting development of small and medium-sized enterprises;\n\u25c6 removing factor market distortions that favor capital over labor;\n\u25c6 establishing or strengthening labor market institutions; and \n\u25c6 introducing public employment schemes as a temporary bridge to \naddress pockets of unemployment and underemployment.", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xxi\n\u2022\nDeveloping Asia must turn back the tide of rising inequality. The region has \nenjoyed a remarkable period of growth and poverty reduction, but the new \nglobal realities of technological progress, more globally integrated markets, \nand greater market orientation are magnifying the effects of inequalities in \nphysical and human capital. Asian policy makers need to redouble their efforts \nto equalize opportunities in employment, education, and health to make \ngrowth more inclusive. Without such policies of job creation and efficient \nredistribution to enhance growth, Asia may be pulled into inefficient populist \npolicies, which would help neither growth nor equity.", "xxii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n                                         Table 1  Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\nSubregion/Economy 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nCentral Asia 3.2 6.6 6.2 6.1 6.2\nAzerbaijan 9.3 5.0 0.1 4.1 3.5\nKazakhstan 1.2 7.0 7.5 6.0 6.5\nEast Asia 6.7 9.8 8.0 7.4 7.7\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 9.2 10.4 9.2 8.5 8.7\nHong Kong, China -2.6 7.0 5.0 3.0 4.5\nKorea, Rep. of 0.3 6.2 3.6 3.4 4.0\nTaipei,China -1.8 10.7 4.0 3.4 4.6\nSouth Asia 7.5 7.8 6.4 6.6 7.1\nBangladesh 5.7 6.1 6.7 6.2 6.0\nIndia 8.4 8.4 6.9 7.0 7.5\nPakistan 1.7 3.8 2.4 3.6 4.0\nSri Lanka 3.5 8.0 8.3 7.0 8.0\nSoutheast Asia 1.4 7.9 4.6 5.2 5.7\nIndonesia 4.6 6.2 6.5 6.4 6.7\nMalaysia -1.6 7.2 5.1 4.0 5.0\nPhilippines 1.1 7.6 3.7 4.8 5.0\nSingapore -1.0 14.8 4.9 2.8 4.5\nThailand -2.3 7.8 0.1 5.5 5.5\nViet Nam 5.3 6.8 5.9 5.7 6.2\nThe Pacific  4.2 5.5 7.0 6.0 4.1\nFiji -1.3 -0.2 2.1 1.0 1.2\nPapua New Guinea 6.0 7.4 8.9 7.5 4.5\nDeveloping Asia 6.0 9.1 7.2 6.9 7.3\nNotes: Developing Asia refers to 44 developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank \nand Brunei Darussalam, an unclassified regional member; East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic \nof China; Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Mongolia; and Taipei,China; Southeast Asia \ncomprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam; South Asia comprises Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka;  \n(continued on the next page)", "ADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xxiii\n                                                       Table 2  Inflation (% per year)\nSubregion/Economy 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nCentral Asia 5.9 7.0 9.0 7.2 7.3\nAzerbaijan 1.5 5.7 7.9 9.0 8.5\nKazakhstan 7.3 7.1 8.3 6.5 6.8\nEast Asia -0.1 3.1 5.0 3.7 3.7\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of -0.7 3.3 5.4 4.0 4.0\nHong Kong, China 0.6 2.3 5.3 3.8 3.3\nKorea, Rep. of 2.8 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0\nTaipei,China -0.9 1.0 1.4 1.5 1.6\nSouth Asia 5.2 9.4 9.4 7.7 6.9\nBangladesh 6.7 7.3 8.8 11.0 8.5\nIndia 3.8 9.6 9.0 7.0 6.5\nPakistan 17.0 10.1 13.7 12.0 10.0\nSri Lanka 3.5 6.2 6.7 8.0 7.0\nSoutheast Asia 2.7 4.1 5.5 4.4 4.4\nIndonesia 4.8 5.1 5.4 5.5 5.0\nMalaysia 0.6 1.7 3.2 2.4 2.8\nPhilippines 4.2 3.8 4.8 3.7 4.1\nSingapore 0.6 2.8 5.2 3.0 2.5\nThailand -0.9 3.3 3.8 3.4 3.3\nViet Nam 6.9 9.2 18.6 9.5 11.5\nThe Pacific  5.3 5.5 8.6 6.6 5.4\nFiji 3.7 7.8 8.7 5.1 3.0\nPapua New Guinea 6.9 6.0 8.7 7.0 6.0\nDeveloping Asia 1.4 4.4 5.9 4.6 4.4\n(continued from the previous page)\nCentral Asia comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan; and The Pacific comprises the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Palau, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \nData for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are recorded on a fiscal-year basis.

ADB Economics Working Paper \ndecline.\nSeries.\nInformation about trade finance and the impact of global financial \nand economic developments comes primarily from surveys of \ncommercial banks. The International Monetary Fund, for instance, has \ncollaborated with the Bankers\u2019 Association for Finance and Trade and the \nInternational Chamber of Commerce to conduct surveys during 2008\u2013\n2010, interviewing banks in supplier and buyer countries.\nIt found that data reported from banks generally show that the \ndecline in trade finance during the crisis was not as severe as the \ndecline in trade volumes. However, bank data may understate the \nimpact of the crisis on trade finance for two reasons. Monetary stimulus \nand programs from international financial institutions targeting trade \nfinance would have softened the blow. Moreover, bank surveys cannot ", "22    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nshow the impact on interfirm trade finance transactions since they do \nnot cover this segment.\nOther data on the importance of trade finance come from surveys of \nbusinesses, such as two World Bank surveys, also carried out in 2008\u2013\n2010, in 14 developing countries (two in Asia). The surveys focused on \nfirms\u2019 perceptions.\nFirm perception survey results, in contrast to bank survey results, \ndo suggest some important connections. Those interviewed felt that \nthe driving factor behind lower trade levels was the drop in demand \nduring the 2008\u20132009 global recession rather than an inability to secure \nfinancing. But there was an important shift from inter-firm transactions \nto bank intermediated trade finance as firms tried to shift counter-party \nrisk during that period of heightened uncertainty. Banks themselves \nadopted stricter risk management and greater client differentiation, \nraising both collateral requirements and margins. Those firms that were \nable to get bank financing faced higher pricing margins. This hampered \ntrade by raising transaction costs.\nThe effect of this squeeze was most pronounced in developing \ncountries. The World Bank surveys found that developing countries\u2019 \nfirms did suffer from constrained trade finance. Firms relying chiefly \non inter-firm or self-financed trade credit were most strongly affected \nby the global drop in trade, the compression of export revenues, the \ncancellation of orders, as well as payment delays. Firms relying mainly \non the banking sector for trade credit were affected by banks\u2019 risk \naversion and discrimination. For example, in the Philippines, firms \nstill felt as late of April 2010\u2014when the second of the two surveys was \nconducted\u2014that eligibility criteria imposed by banks continued to be \noverly stringent.\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises were affected more strongly \nthan large ones by the strains to trade finance. These firms faced larger \nincreases in the price of trade finance, due to their weaker capital base to \nstem against revenues compression, and their disadvantage in bargaining \nwith the larger corporations and banks in the global markets.\nLooking ahead, there are several factors that may tighten trade finance \nconditions in developing Asia. First is the ongoing bank deleveraging \nin advanced economies. The sharpening of the eurozone crisis in 2011 \nadded pressure on banks to increase their capital, reducing capacity in \nthe market. Consequently, many European banks, traditionally active in \nsupporting trade in Asia, have retrenched, leaving a larger gap for trade \nfinance. The potential impact of reduced lending by eurozone banks is \nsignificant, since they are estimated to provide about 30% of total trade \nfinance in the region.\nSecond, the Basel III accord\u2014as important as it is to help place \nthe global financial system on a more sound footing\u2014has unintended \nconsequences. By treating the cost of capital the same for a high-risk \nhigh-margin activity, compared with a relatively low-risk lower-margin \nactivity such as trade finance, Basel III encourages financial institutions \ntoward higher return (and higher risk) lending away from trade finance. \nThis is despite the strong evidence showing that trade finance carries \na relatively low probability of default and loss because it is highly \ncollateralized.", "Maintaining growth in an uncertain world    23\nFinally, for developing economies, trade finance is not just about \naccess to credit, but rather access to international liquidity. Advanced \neconomies can use expansionary monetary policy to provide liquidity to \nmarkets in currencies accepted in international transactions. The analogy \nfor developing Asian economies would be to draw down foreign reserves \nwith central banks supplying dollars to local banks through repurchasing \nagreements, but this could put the exchange rate at risk.\nThe confluence of these factors may squeeze trade finance \navailability\u2014especially if the situation in the eurozone were to worsen. \nPolicy makers need to closely monitor trade finance availability, especially \nfor small and medium-sized enterprises.\nThey need to be ready to act\u2014on a wider field than trade finance\u2014\nand have the capacity to do so.", "24    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nMacro-policy directions for \ndeveloping Asia\nEnough policy space for a major external shock\nResponding to the global economic downturn in 2008\u20132009, countries \nin developing Asia adopted policy stimulus measures, which though \neffective, absorbed some of the region\u2019s monetary and fiscal policy space \n(Box\u00a01.3.1) that was earned through earlier prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement. Many countries reduced their benchmark policy interest \nrates to record lows and saw their ratio of public debt to GDP spike as \nthey expanded government spending substantially.\n1.3.1  What is policy space?\nPolicy space refers to the scope for using fiscal and monetary policy to counter \nthe effects of shocks to the economic environment. For example, relatively low \npublic debt to GDP ratios allow governments to increase spending and cut \ntaxes without triggering adverse reactions from financial markets about fiscal \nsustainability.\nLikewise, a history of anti-inflationary policies builds credibility and \nexpands the scope for interest rate cuts. Further, the presence of a clearly \ndefined lender of last resort strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy \nduring a crisis.\nAs countries started to unwind the stimulus measures in 2010, they \nbegan to claw back some of this hard-earned policy space. But, given \nthe global outlook, can developing Asia pursue another round of such \nmeasures if the downside risks materialize?\nIn an attempt to answer this question, it is useful to look  1.3.1 Benchmark policy rates, selected Asian economies\nin more detail at the earlier measures.

Policy makers should \nconfront rising inequality through interventions that equalize opportunity \nand reduce inequality, in three areas: efficient fiscal measures that reduce \ninequality in human capital, policies that work toward more and high-\nquality jobs, and interventions that narrow spatial inequality.\nThe analysis and policy options in this theme chapter provide a \nbroad road map for policy makers to chart their own, country-specific, \npath to addressing inequality\u2014which, if unchecked, could undermine \nthe momentum for economic growth and for a better quality of life for \nall Asians. \nThis chapter was written by Juzhong Zhuang of the Economics and Research \nDepartment (ERD) and Ravi Kanbur, external advisor; with Hyun Son, Jesus Felipe, \nDalisay Maligalig, Iris Claus, Guanghua Wan, Donghyun Park, and Shikha Jha of ERD.

Equality of opportunity is not only intrinsically \nimportant, but also a critical condition for a prosperous society. \nPublic policy must be put in place to reduce or eliminate inequality of \nopportunity. As we will argue later, equality of opportunity is at the \nheart of the inclusive growth concept. In this chapter our focus will \nbe on equality of opportunity, on assuring that everybody has equal \nopportunity to participate in the growth process and benefit from its \nfruits, equitably. To the extent that inequality of parents\u2019 income leads \nto inequality of opportunity for children, this inequality needs to be \novercome by interventions to assure equal access to public services and to \nmarkets for all in society.\nIn the real world, a clear distinction between inequality of outcome \nand of opportunity is not straightforward. There could also be differences \nin opinion on what constitute circumstances and what constitute efforts \nin a society (Roemer 1998; Paes de Barros et al. 2009). Even with these \ndifficulties, in many low-income countries, it is relatively easy to observe \nextreme circumstances that severely limit opportunities for a large \nsegment of the population.\nThese circumstances include the lack of, or unequal access to, the \nhigh-quality jobs and public services to which every citizen is meant to ", "40    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nhave equal access irrespective of circumstance\u2014variations in this access \nreflect inequality of opportunity.

Those with little wealth or low income are unable to \ninvest in human capital, or wealth- and income-enhancing activities, \nand will remain poor. In principle they may be able to borrow to finance \ninvestment. But imperfect financial markets, coupled with other market \nfailures, often heavily constrain their ability to borrow and invest. \nSimilarly, much evidence shows that small enterprises have high potential \nrates of return to investment but are constrained from accessing capital \n(for example, de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2008).\nWidening inequality\u2014leaving more people at the top and bottom of the \nladder\u2014can also mean a hollowing out of the middle class. The importance \nof the middle class for stability and growth has been emphasized and \nanalyzed in recent years. Birdsall (2010, p.158), for example, has argued \nthat \u201cgrowth driven by and benefiting a middle class is more likely to \nbe sustained\u2014both economically, to the extent that the rent seeking \nand corruption associated with highly concentrated gains to growth \nare avoided, and politically, to the extent that conflict and horizontal \ninequalities between racial and ethnic groups are easier to manage\u2026.\u201d", "42    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nIn fact, there is a broad consensus among analysts on the link between \ninequality and the quality of institutions. Along several dimensions, \nranging from political stability, through institutional stability, to property \nrights, the negative impact of inequality on institutional quality seems \nto be well established, although the two-way causality is also widely \nrecognized (Zhuang et al. 2010; Nye forthcoming). At the same time, \nthere is also a literature on the effect of inequality on crime and violence \nand, through that, on the investment climate (for example, Fajnzylber, \nLederman, and Loayza 2002; \u00d6zler and Demombynes 2002).\nFinally, greater inequality may lead to a political backlash, in which \npressure grows for governments to enact populist policy measures. In \nresponse to the rising demands, the political process may favor policies \nwhich, in the short term, would benefit the lower end of the income \ndistribution, but which in the long run could hold back efficiency and \ngrowth (Alesina and Rodrik 1994). Under such conditions, the interests of \nthe political system diverge from the interests of the economy as a whole. \nThis is a widespread concern in developing and developed countries alike.\nEmpirically establishing the linkage between inequality and growth is \nnot easy, because numerous factors are at work, and economic analysis is \noften subject to data and methodological limitations. Unsurprisingly, the \nempirical evidence is itself mixed (for example, Kanbur and Lustig 2000; \nBarro 2008).\nRecent studies by Berg and Ostry (2011a, 2011b), however, provide \nconvincing evidence on the inequality\u2013growth relationship. The studies \nmake a key distinction between growth over the short run and growth \nover the long run (Box\u00a02.1.2). This corresponds to the different issues \ninvolved in \u201cigniting\u201d growth versus sustaining it over the long run. \nMany countries can ignite growth in the short run, but far fewer can \nsustain it (Hausmann, Pritchett, and Rodrik 2005). The econometric \nanalysis of Berg and Ostry confirms that inequality is a key variable \nexplaining long-run growth. Thus not only does rising inequality dent the \npoverty impact of a given growth rate, it can also affect the sustainability \nof a growth path.\nInequality on the policy agenda\nGovernments are not blind to the problem. Indeed, in recent years more \nof them have embraced the concept of inclusive growth to make income \ndistribution more equitable:\n\u2022\t In the PRC, where the Gini coefficient of per capita expenditure \nworsened from about 32.4 in 1990 to 43.4 in 2008, the government \nset about building a harmonious society as the development goal \nin its Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u22122010).

Whether the opportunity is used well must be \nconceptually separated from whether it exists in the first place. The \npolicy implications vary greatly depending upon whether the outcome \nwas the result of differences in education and health available to an \nindividual\u2014opportunity\u2014or differences in effort. A few examples will \nillustrate this point.\nFirst, consider two low-income individuals. One, despite having been \nprovided with a good education and health care, wastes this opportunity by \nnot exerting enough effort and enterprise, and ends up with a low income. \nThe other had poor education so that, despite being willing to work hard, \nends up with low income. The first individual suffers due to lack of effort, \nwhile the second one is limited by his or her circumstances (Roemer 1998). \nThe distinction here is that the first person could have applied more effort, \nwhile the second was constrained by a lack of opportunity.\nBut how do differences in opportunities arise in the first place? \nConsider two individuals with different levels of education and health \nbecause one did not have access to schools or health services. This could \nbe because of discrimination in access for social reasons, or because of \nservices not provided in certain geographic areas. Preventing individuals \nfrom enhancing their human capital to augment their earning potential\u2014\nthrough discrimination or incomplete service coverage\u2014creates \ninequality of opportunity.\nUnfortunately, that is not the only way that unequal opportunities \narise. Consider now two individuals with the same level of education and \nhealth, and the same level of effort and enterprise, but one of whom is \nsimply not allowed to exercise that effort and enterprise to earn income. \nThis exclusion could stem from discrimination in the labor or credit \nmarket, or from gender or racial bias. Such social exclusion creates \ninequality of opportunity as well.\nDifferences in opportunity can therefore arise because of differences \nin access to public services that lead to differences in human capital \nformation (education and health), or because of differences in access to \nincome earning opportunities. However, the final outcome, in this case \nincome actually earned, depends also on the effort and enterprise applied \nby the individual. Inequality of opportunity is thus a determinant of \ninequality of outcome, but not the sole factor.\nInequalities due to circumstances are ethically unacceptable because \nit is attributable to factors over which the individual has no control. In \ncontrast, inequalities due to effort may be ethically acceptable, and may \neven be desirable to reward enterprise and thereby spur productivity \nand growth. Thus inequality of opportunity is the more important for \npolicy action.", "54    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nOf course, in practice it is not easy to separate effort from \nopportunity, especially in an intergenerational context (Kanbur 2010). \nThus parental income, which may be the result of their effort, nevertheless \ndetermines the opportunity of their children. Inequality of income, even \nif it is not of direct concern in this framework, will still be important as a \ndeterminant of inequality of opportunity.\nThis connection between inequality of income and of opportunity \nmakes it important to study both, and for policy makers to address both \ndimensions of inequality. If drivers of inequality are such that any given \ninequality of opportunity is transformed into ever greater divergences \nin income, and this income inequality translates into inequality of \nopportunity in the next generation, policy makers will need to redouble \ntheir efforts to break the link between parental income and educational \nopportunity for their children.\nInequalities of education and health in Asia\nAsia has made significant strides in improving average achievements in \neducation and health. However, considerable inequalities remain, as now \ndiscussed.\nEducation\nSignificant inequality in education persists in developing Asia, discussed \nhere along three dimensions: wealth, location, and gender.11\nInequality by wealth quintile. Inequality in the proportion of out-of-\nschool children between rich and poor households was, in the late \n1990s to mid-2000s, very wide in developing Asia (UNESCO 2005). For \nexample, in Bangladesh, India, Mongolia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, \nwhere the average proportion of out-of-school primary school-age \nchildren was about 20% in 1999\u20132003, children from the poorest quintile \nwere three times as likely as those from the richest quintile to be out of \nschool. In Cambodia and the Lao PDR, with an average proportion of \nabout 35%, the children from the poorest quintile were four or five times \nas likely as those from the richest quintile to be out of school.\nResults from more \nrecent household survey \n2.3.1 Gaps in net attendance rates between top and bottom quintiles, 2000s\ndata for Bhutan, Pakistan, \nInitial year Final year\nQuintile ratio\nand the Philippines \n30\nshow that inequality in \neducation indicators persists  24\n(Figure\u00a02.3.1).

But is there a systematic way of \nmeasuring overall inequality of human opportunity? Paes de Barros, et al. \n(2009) developed an approach that starts with the overall national rate of \naccess to a public service\u2014for example, enrollment in secondary school\u2014\nthen calculates how different the access rate is across gender, location, \nparental education, household income, and other indicators capturing \ncircumstance.13 The dissimilarity in access rates across these circumstance \ndifferences is the degree of inequality of opportunity (the D-index). The \nD-index can be interpreted as the proportion of a particular opportunity \nthat needs to be redistributed to achieve equal distribution. The inequality \nof opportunity is then used to scale down the national access rate to \nestimate the human opportunity index (HOI).\nThe technical methodology outlined in Box\u00a02.3.1 is applied to \nsix developing countries in Asia (Bhutan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) with a particular focus on \ninequality of opportunity that is related to basic education and \ninfrastructure. The analysis includes five outcome variables: primary \nschool attendance among children aged 6\u201311 years; secondary school \nattendance among children aged 12\u201317 years; access to safe water; access \nto electricity; and access to sanitation.\nThe analysis used a set of circumstance variables required to estimate \nthe D-index and the HOI. These circumstance variables are gender, \nlocation of household (urban or rural), education of household head, per \ncapita household expenditure, age of household head, gender of household \nhead, and household size.\n2.3.1  Inequality of opportunity (D-index) and the human opportunity index\nEstimating the D-index1 from household survey data  to a given opportunity.2 Note also that \u03c0 may be called \ninvolves the following steps: the coverage rate.

In Bhutan, a low HOI in access to sanitation, at 15%, is due \nto both a low average opportunity at 26.5% and high inequality of \nopportunity at 43.5%.\nDeterminants of inequality of opportunity\nThe estimation of the D-index is based on seven circumstance variables, \nincluding gender of children, area of residence, per capita household \nexpenditure, gender, age and educational attainment of household head, \nand household size. The Paes de Barros et al. (2009) decomposition is \nused to show the importance of each of these variables in contributing to \nthe inequality of opportunity. The following discussion focuses only on \nsecondary education and access to sanitation.\nPer capita household expenditure is the most important contributing \nfactor to inequality of opportunity in access to secondary education \n(Table 2.3.3). For example, it explains 54.5% of the variation in Bhutan and \n96% in Sri Lanka. Location of residence (urban and rural) of children is \nalso important (for Bhutan and Indonesia). Educational attainment of the \nhousehold head also has a significant influence for Indonesia, Pakistan, \nand Viet Nam. Another important factor is gender of children. Variables \nincluding household size, and age and gender of household head, are not \nimportant contributing factors.\nIn the case of access to sanitation, per capita household expenditure \nis a major driver of inequality of opportunity, and so is residence \nlocation (Table 2.3.4), especially in Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, \nand Viet Nam. In Indonesia and Bhutan, the largest contributing factor \nis location of residence. Educational attainment of household head is \nalso an important contributing factor in Bhutan and Pakistan. Other \ncircumstance variables play insignificant roles.\nIt is well known that access to safe water and sanitation is generally \nlower in rural than urban areas. This is due to the relatively higher cost of \nbuilding water and sanitation infrastructure as well as lower income levels \nin rural than urban areas. Rural areas often lack an enabling environment \nthat encourages public or private investment in water services, leading \nto low provision of those services. This is a particular problem in \nSouth Asia where there is low overall public or private investment in \ninfrastructure particularly in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan (WaterAid \n2011). Moreover, even if investments are made, poor maintenance is an \nadditional constraint.\nSummary\nMuch needs to be done to improve the distribution of opportunities\u2014\nas measured by disparities in access to basic services\u2014in developing \ncountries in Asia. Sri Lanka\u2019s achievements in equitably providing \nbasic education opportunities demonstrate the importance and possible \neffectiveness of public policy in achieving equity of opportunity, \nparticularly in education. The need for action is urgent because, without \nit, inequality of opportunity will be magnified into greater and greater \ninequality of outcome, which will then continue the cycle of inequality of \nopportunity and outcome for the next generation.", "62    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nWhat drives inequality in \ndeveloping Asia?\nDrivers and channels of inequality\nTechnological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reform have \nbeen the key drivers of developing Asia\u2019s rapid growth in the last 2 \ndecades\u2014but they also had huge distributional consequences. Together, \nthey have favored skilled rather than unskilled labor, capital rather than \nlabor, and urban and coastal areas rather than rural and inland regions. \nThese changes can explain many of the movements in inequality in many \nregional countries.\nTechnological change can impact on the distribution of income among \ndifferent factors of production. If it favors skilled labor (more educated \nor more experienced) over unskilled labor by increasing its relative \nproductivity, we could expect the skill premium\u2014the ratio of skilled to \nunskilled wages\u2014to go up, which would most likely increase income \ninequality. Technological change could also affect the distribution of \nincome between labor and capital. If it is biased in favor of capital, it \ncould increase inequality since capital incomes, in general, are less equally \ndistributed and accrue to the rich more than to the poor.\nIn a similar fashion, globalization can affect income distribution. \nTrade integration, for example, could change relative demand for and \nhence relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers. It could also \naffect income distribution between capital and labor because capital \nand skills often work together due to their complementarity. Financial \nintegration could broaden access to finance by the poor\u2014but could also \nincrease the risk of financial crises and hurt the poor more than the rich. \nGlobalization can magnify the distributional impact of technological \nprogress.\nA large literature has emerged in recent years attempting to \nunderstand the impacts of trade integration, financial integration, and \ntechnological change on income distribution (Box\u00a02.4.1), though it has yet \nto provide a clear-cut answer. One complication is that there are several, \nclosely linked, confounding factors.14\nMarket-oriented reform is an important driver of growth, but can \nalso have significant distributional consequences. Trade policy reform is \noften part of the driving forces of globalization. Labor market reforms \ncan change the bargaining position of labor vis-\u00e0-vis capital owners, \nimpacting on wage rates and income distribution between labor and \ncapital. Economic transition from a command to a market economy can \nimprove efficiency and make returns to assets more closely reflective of \nresource scarcity, which can affect income distribution among different \nproductive assets in a significant way.\nMoreover, the impacts of the three drivers of growth\u2014technological \nprogress, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014can be ", "Confronting rising inequality in Asia     63\n2.4.1  Globalization and inequality\nThere is general consensus among researchers and policy  evidence on \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d from the Republic of \nmakers that Asia\u2019s stellar growth performance could not  Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China seems to support this \nhave been achieved without its embrace of globalization.  thesis (Wood 1999).\nAll countries in Asia are committed to greater integration  The recent evidence on trade, openness, and inequality, \nwith the global economy in coming decades.

This leads to shifts in income \ndistribution among different geographic locations.\nComplicating the analysis is that the impacts of the three drivers \nare intertwined. Although they can be disentangled conceptually, it \nis difficult to do so empirically. In the next three sections, therefore, \ninstead of trying to isolate their impacts, we will look at three channels \nthrough which the three drivers affect income inequality: shifts in income \ndistribution between skilled and unskilled labor, by examining returns \nto human capital and the skill premium; between labor and capital, \nby analyzing labor and capital income shares; and between different \nlocations, by estimating spatial inequality. This approach also facilitates \ndiscussions of policy responses.\nYet those individuals and groups excluded from the market because \nof individual circumstances beyond their control or discrimination would \ncertainly not benefit from these opportunities\u2014inequality of opportunity \nmagnifies the distributional consequences of the three drivers. One such \ngroup is women\u2014discussed in the final section.\nIncreasing skill premiums\nInequality of education is a major contributor to inequality of \nincome. There is significant global evidence that the rates of return to \nprogressively higher levels of education have been trending upward in \nrecent years. In OECD countries, for instance, those who do not complete \nan upper secondary education could earn an average of 23% less than \ntheir counterparts who do. A person with a tertiary education can \nexpect to earn over 50% more than a person with an upper secondary or \npostsecondary non-tertiary education (OECD 2011b).\nIn Asia, empirical studies find that the returns to education increase \nwith educational attainment and that the relationship has been getting \nsteeper over time. An ADB study (2007b) finds that from the mid-1990s \nto mid-2000s, real wages grew much faster for wage earners with tertiary \nor higher education than for those with lower educational attainment in \nIndia and the Philippines, leading to wider wage differentials. \nThe same study also finds that education is the single most important \nfactor among those variables that were included in analyzing wage \ninequality. In the case of India, the Gini coefficient of wages increased \nfrom 40.5 in 1993 to 47.2 in 2004. Half the increase can be explained \nby individual characteristics. Of this explained increase, about 50% is \naccounted for by education.\nMany other studies have provided direct or indirect evidence of rising \nskill/education premiums in developing Asia. Son (2010) finds that in \nthe Philippines education increases individuals\u2019 employability. In 2003, \nthe probability of being employed was 57% for individuals with tertiary \neducation, and 34% for those with primary education only. This difference \nin employability increased from 1997 to 2003. Further, the difference in ", "Confronting rising inequality in Asia     65\nemployability due to differences in educational attainment was more \npronounced among poorer households.\nA study on India, the Philippines, and Thailand finds that the rate of \nreturn to college education rose relative to that of secondary education \nbetween the mid-1990s and mid-2000s (Mehta et al. 2011). This rise was \nrelated to the expansion of high-skill services jobs: employing only 7\u201311% \nof the labor force, they contributed 40\u201370% of the rate of return to college \neducation.\nA more recent study (World Bank 2012a) reports that the \n2.4.1 Income inequality decomposition by educational \ntertiary education premium15 stood at 90% for Cambodia \nattainment of household head\n(2007), 60% for the PRC (2005), 84% for Indonesia (2007), 70% \nfor Mongolia (2007), 70% for the Philippines (2006), 120% for  Bhutan 2003\n2007\nThailand (2004), and 55% for Viet Nam (2006).

Several studies \nhave shown that in middle- and higher-income economies, technological \nimprovements have led to displacement of women from low-paying \njobs in import-competing sectors. In particular, Anker (1998) provided \nevidence that women in middle- and higher-income economies tend to \ncluster in manufacturing industries that have begun to upgrade their \ntechnologies, reduce the size of their workforce, and move production to \nlower-wage countries.\nIn the case of Taipei,China, technological upgrading and rising \ncapital intensity of export-oriented manufacturing after 1980 was \nlinked to a relative decline in employment opportunities for women \n(Berik 2000).

And spatial disparities are becoming \nmore acute: locations with superior infrastructure, market access, and \nscale economies\u2014such as urban centers and coastal areas\u2014are better \nable to benefit from changing circumstances. Empirical evidence is \nconsistent with these arguments. Inequality of opportunity magnifies the \ndistributional consequences of these driving factors.", "74    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nConfronting rising inequality: \nPolicy options\nSummary of key findings\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s rapid growth in recent decades has led to a significant \nreduction in extreme poverty, but it has also been accompanied by rising \ninequality in many countries. Income inequality has increased in 11 out \nof the 28 countries with comparable data, the 11 accounting for 82% of \nthe total population. In many countries, income inequality coexists with \nnon-income inequality in the form of unequal access to education, health, \nand basic services among different population groups classified by gender, \nlocation, and income. Asia\u2019s rising inequality contrasts with the \u201cgrowth \nwith equity\u201d story that characterized the transformation of the newly \nindustrialized economies in the 1960s and 1970s, and with recent trends \nin other parts of the developing world, in particular Latin America, where \nincome inequality has been on the decline since the 1990s.\nTechnological change, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014\nthe main drivers of Asia\u2019s rapid economic growth\u2014are the basic driving \nforces behind the rising inequality in Asia. Working together, these have \nsignificantly impacted on inequality through a number of channels, in \nparticular:\n\u2022\t Increasing skill premiums and returns to human capital. The \nemergence of vast new economic opportunities, unleashed by \ntrade and financial integration, technological progress, and \nmarket-oriented reform, has increased returns to human capital \nand the skill premium, with individuals having higher educational \nattainment and skill endowment able to benefit more from the \nnew opportunities. Our analysis shows that, in many countries, as \nhigh as 25\u201335% of the total income inequality can be explained by \ninterperson differences in human capital and skill endowments.\n\u2022\t Falling labor income shares. As in many countries in other parts of \nthe world, technological progress appears to have favored capital \nover labor. The abundance of labor relative to capital, which \ndepresses wage rates, is also a contributing factor to the declining \nlabor income share in developing Asia.

Social protection also has an \nimportant role in reducing inequality. Social safety nets mitigate the \nrisks of external and transitory livelihood shocks, as well as meeting the \nminimum needs of the chronically poor.

Social safety nets act as a coping mechanism for poor and \nvulnerable people and help improve well-being by investing in human \ncapital in the long run, which, in turn, can enhance accessibility of \nthose with limited assets and capabilities to opportunities (Ali and \nZhuang 2007).\nDespite the increasing recognition of the importance of social safety \nnets in the region, their provision remains limited. ADB (2008) shows \nthat very few developing Asian countries have adequate social safety nets, \ncompared with Japan or the Republic of Korea.

However, tax incentives can reduce \nthe progressivity of income taxation if resources are captured by high-\nincome interest groups lobbying for concessions. Moreover, they are \noften inefficient because they simply subsidize activities that firms would \nhave undertaken anyway. Tax collection could thus also be increased by \nbroadening the corporate tax base.\nValue added tax (VAT) receipts are also low as a share of GDP in \nmany Asian countries and is a potential source of additional government \nrevenue. It is true that VAT is regressive and it is not an effective tool for \nreducing income inequality, but it is less distortionary than income and \nsales taxes, and is easier to collect.\nVAT does not exist in, for example, Bhutan, Malaysia, Maldives, and \nMyanmar. For those countries where VAT exists, its collection can be \nincreased by broadening its base. VAT exemptions or reduced tax rates for \nnecessities are often used to address its potential regressivity. However, \nthese two mechanisms are costly and not well targeted at the poor. A \nmore effective policy would be direct transfer payments to those in need. \nIn countries where the VAT tax rate is low, it could be raised.\nImproving tax administration.

Migration from \npoor to prosperous areas is one of the major means for reducing \nregional inequality. Migration and labour mobility often come up \nagainst significant barriers. One comes from the bureaucratic and \nadministrative obstacles to moving from one part of the country to \nanother. For example, in the PRC, the hukou (registration) system \nconstrains rural\u2013urban migration by limiting rural migrants\u2019 access to \nbasic public services such as education, health care, and social protection \nin urban areas. Lack of necessary skills and suitable job opportunities \nin prosperous areas is another barrier. Absence of portability of pension \nbenefits also discourages individuals from seeking better opportunities \nelsewhere. Improving connectivity, as mentioned, will facilitate not only \nthe movement of goods but also of people.\nMaking growth more employment friendly\nSince the declining share of labor income is associated with rising \ninequality, a key issue is how to maintain and even raise this share during \nthe growth process. This requires shifting the labor demand curve in \nthe productive sectors of the economy as output increases. If demand \noutstrips supply, wages will rise, increasing the labor income share ", "84    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nand containing inequality.

In 2010, India\u2019s share of \nmanufacturing in GDP was close to the average of low-income countries, \nbut much lower than the average of both lower and upper middle-income \ncountries (Figure\u00a02.5.11).24 In the PRC, on the other hand, the share of \nservices in GDP was much lower than the averages of low-, lower middle \nand upper middle-income countries.25\nA country\u2019s sectoral composition is determined by its comparative \nadvantages and other factors, but development policy often \n2.5.11 Share of manufacturing and services in GDP, 2010\nplays a role.

Three ADB studies found that access to finance \nwas ranked among the top constraints to business growth by SMEs in \nthe Philippines, Indonesia and Nepal (ADB 2009b, 2010, 2011b). In the \nPRC, access to finance and human capital is also considered among major \nconstraints by SMEs, many of which are in rural areas.\nGovernments should support SME development by facilitating their \ncreation, removing unnecessary and cumbersome restrictions on their \ndevelopment, and addressing market failures in their access to finance. \nGovernments can also help SMEs adopt new technologies and access new \nmarkets (ADB 2009a).\nOn access to finance, recent international experience suggests that one \nof the most important ways governments can increase access to finance \nis to improve the institutional underpinnings of financial transactions \nby strengthening creditor rights, defining property rights so property \ncan be used as collateral for credit, and enhancing credit registries and \nsystems to screen borrowers. They can also improve the informational \ninfrastructure that underlies the workings of financial markets.\nTo help SMEs adopt technologies and enter new markets, \ngovernments can provide information on improved production methods, \nproducts, and markets, technical support services, and vocational \ntraining. They can also foster links between SMEs and large enterprises \nand encourage cluster-based development by exploiting the fact that many \nenterprises that make and sell related or complementary products are \ngrouped close together, often with their suppliers and buyers.\nRemoving factor market distortions\nOne of the reasons why developing countries with relatively abundant labor \nprefer labor-saving and capital-intensive techniques could be distortions in \nfactor markets: market prices of factors of production fail to reflect relative \nabundance, due to causes such as underdevelopment of the financial sector \nor financial repression. In the PRC, for instance, factor market reform has \nlagged behind product market reform, and interest rate control has kept \nborrowing costs low, especially for state-owned enterprises. During 1990\u2013\n2010, the PRC\u2019s real lending rate was one of the lowest among 50 middle- \nand high-income countries (ADB forthcoming). The low cost of capital has \nbeen put forward as one of the causes of the imbalances of growth sources \nin the PRC (Huang 2010; World Bank 2012b).\nIn India, the financial repression, as evidenced by persistently negative \nreal savings deposit rates, could also be a contributing factor to the low \ncost of capital relative to labor in the formal sector (RBI 2011). It has also \nbeen suggested that some of the earlier policies of industrialization, which \nwas intended to promote labor-intensive industries and adoption of labor-\nintensive techniques, had some unintended consequences of encouraging \nthe use of capital intensive technology (Kochhar et al. 2006; Felipe, \nKumar, and Abdon forthcoming).\nReducing factor market distortions could, therefore, promote job \ncreation. A key policy measure is to reduce or eliminate financial \nrepression by further developing the financial sector. This include ", "86    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nreducing and eliminating distortions in the cost of capital by gradually \nadopting market-determined interest rates; allowing greater competition \nand private sector participation in the financial sector; further \nstrengthening the regulatory framework and governance of financial \ninstitutions; carefully managing the liberalization of the capital account; \nand making the exchange rate more flexible. India liberalized deposit \ninterest rate in November 2011 (RBI 2011).\nLabor market institutions\nEmployment generation also needs to be supported by effective labor \nmarket institutions. On the one hand, labor market institutions should \nhelp improve the employability of labor through providing skill training \nand assistance with job search (such as employment services), and provide \nnecessary protection of worker rights. On the other hand, they should not \nimpose excessive costs on enterprises and hurt job creation.\nThere are significant disagreements on effects of labor market \ninterventions on job creation. Some believe that interventions such as \nemployment protection legislation, minimum wages, and collective \nbargaining are important to protect the rights of workers, while others \nthink that these interventions will raise labor costs, only protect those \nwho have already been employed (or \u201cinsiders\u201d), but make employers \nreluctant to hire new workers, or find ways to bypass these (for example, \nby replacing regular, formal jobs with contract labor that offers less \nprotection, lower wages and little social security), hence hurting job \ncreation. Empirical evidence on these is mixed (Felipe and Hasan 2006).\nIn some countries, there has been an implicit or explicit move to a \n\u201cflexicurity system,\u201d which involves giving employers greater flexibility \nin adjusting the workforce based on their needs as determined by market \nfluctuations, while the security of workers is \u201csocialized\u201d through policies \nand programs administered by or through the state, such as re-training \nor unemployment insurance (Auer 2007). This approach reduces the \nretrenchment burden on firms (making it more likely that they will hire \nand provide better security for workers. In Asia, some countries have \nmoved in this direction, including the Republic of Korea and the PRC, \nwhile others have found it hard to restructure labor market institutions \n(Vandenberg 2010).\nIn sum, while there is large room for many Asian countries to \nbuild effective labor market institutions, the exact form and approach \nto follow will have to be decided by each country on the basis of their \nspecific circumstances. For countries that have transited from a planned \neconomy to a market economy and basic labor market institutions are \nyet to be established, there is a case for moving toward establishing or \nstrengthening formal arrangements. For countries where labor market \nregulations have been seen as too restrictive and a major constraint to \ngrowth and job creation in the formal sector, there is a need to examine \nthe specific elements that are likely to be constraints and ensure that they \nare appropriately addressed.\nPublic employment schemes\nGovernments can also introduce public employment schemes to act as \na buffer stock or mechanism for employment: when the private sector ", "Confronting rising inequality in Asia     87\ndownsizes in recessions, workers who lose their job can find work in \nsuch a scheme. The government pledges to hire anyone satisfying certain \ncriteria and willing to work on projects such as small infrastructure (e.g., \nclean water and sewage projects, roads) at a basic public sector living \nsalary. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka in Asia, and Argentina, \nBrazil, Chile, Peru, and Mexico in Latin America, and developed \ncountries including Australia and France, have public employment \nprograms, many of which are temporary (Felipe 2009).\nSome countries have implemented such programs to counter the \nmajor problems associated with persistent unemployment. In Asia, a well-\nknown case is India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \n(Box\u00a02.5.4).\n2.5.4  India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment  large number of women who have sought work\u2014female \nGuarantee Scheme was launched in 2006 in the 200 most  participation increased from 41% to 49% in this period.\nbackward districts of India (of 640 districts in all).

A notable aspect of the scheme is the  Farrington (2008).\nToward inclusive growth in Asia\nDriven by globalization, technological progress, and market-oriented \nreform, developing Asia has had a remarkable period of growth and \npoverty reduction. However, the drivers of growth are also magnifying \nthe effects of inequalities in physical and human capital, leading to rising \nincome inequality. These forces require Asian policy makers to redouble \ntheir efforts to generate more productive jobs, equalize opportunities \nin employment, education and health, and address spatial inequality. \nWithout such policies, which will enhance growth further, Asia may be \npulled into inefficient populist policies, which will benefit neither growth \nnor equity.\nThe policy options outlined constitute key elements of a strategy \nfor inclusive growth. Broadly, inclusive growth can be defined as \n\u201cgrowth coupled with equality of opportunity,\u201d and it needs three policy \npillars: sustained growth to create productive jobs for a wide section \nof the population; social inclusion to equalize access to opportunity; \nand social safety nets to mitigate vulnerability and risks and prevent ", "88    Asian Development Outlook 2012\nextreme poverty (Zhuang and Ali 2010). Such a strategy would ensure \nthat all members of society can participate in the development process \nproductively and benefit equitably from the opportunities generated by \neconomic growth.\nIt is encouraging that more and more developing Asian countries are \nembracing the concept of inclusive growth, with an increasing number \nof countries\u2014including the PRC, India, and many Southeast Asian \ncountries\u2014placing inclusive growth at the heart of their development \npolicy, as reflected in their recent medium-term development plans. \nIndeed, the entire development community is embracing the concept of \ninclusive growth. These developments will go a long way toward reducing \npoverty and inequality and making the world a more equitable place.\nEndnotes\n1   A common measure of inequality, ranging from zero indicating perfect equality and 1 (or \n100) indicating perfect inequality. See Box\u00a02.2.1 for technical details.\n2   Of these countries, 25 have data for the 1990s and 2000s.\n3   The 13 comprise one in East Asia (PRC), three in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, the Philippines, \nand Thailand), one in South Asia (Sri Lanka), one in Central Asia (Georgia), and seven in \nthe Pacific (Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu). The Gini of \nthe rest of the economies ranged from 27.8 for Afghanistan to 38.9 for Indonesia. \n4   If two countries with data only in the 1990s are included, the average is 37.9.\n5   We say \u201cappears\u201d because the rural Gini had a sharp fall in 2002\u20132005 but a steep rise in \n2005\u20132008. It is unclear whether this switch reflects data problems or changes in income \ndistribution.\n6   The PRC, Fiji, Georgia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nauru, Palau, the Philippines, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Thailand, and Vanuatu.\n7   This is a simple arithmetic average.\n8   Data are not available for the Republic of Korea; Mongolia; or Taipei,China.\n9   The difference between the two measures was 4.4 percentage points for the Philippines in \n2009 and 8.9 percentage points for Viet Nam in 2008.\n10  The increases were more pronounced in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, \nLuxembourg, Spain, and Sweden.\n11  A caveat: inequality in education is difficult to measure, as the quality dimension of \neducation in particular is hard to capture through survey and census instruments.\n12  Global Health Observatory Repository Data (accessed 18 February 2012).\n13  Circumstances, as used here, are personal or family socioeconomic and demographic \ncharacteristics over which an individual has no direct control.\n14 A cross-country study by IMF (2007) finds that global trade integration helps to reduce \ninequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, global financial integration increases it, and \ntechnological progress is the most important contributor to rising inequality globally in \nthe last 2 decades. The study also finds that these impacts are particularly pronounced in \ndeveloping Asia.\n15  Tertiary education premium refers to the wage premium for workers with at least tertiary \neducation compared with workers with a lower level of education.\n16  Acemoglu (2002) notes that for the late 20th century, there has been a rise in returns to \neducation and a decrease in low-skill wages, despite an increase in the supply of college \ngraduates, which suggests that supply has not kept up with demand for high-skilled labor. \nStudies have also argued for evidence of skill-biased technological change in developing \ncountries (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007; Robbins 1996; Sanchez-Paramo and Schady 2003; \nand Attanasio, Goldberg, and Pavcnik 2004 for Latin America; Hsieh and Woo 2005 for \nHong Kong, China; and Kijima 2006 for India). However, Card and DiNardo (2002) \npoint out that wage inequality stabilized in the US despite continuing developments in \ncomputer technology. They also argue that skill-biased technological change does not ", "Confronting rising inequality in Asia     89\nfully explain wage gaps across genders, and racial and demographic structures. The debate \nbetween competing explanations for the US is ongoing (see Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2008; \nMarquis, Trehan, and Tantivong 2011).\n17  Wage employment refers to wage-earning employment, mostly in the formal sector. Wage \nemployment elasticity is the ratio of employment growth to GDP growth between two \nperiods. It thus measures the amount of employment growth required to generate each \npercentage point of GDP growth.\n18  A dual economy consists of two sectors, one a low-income, rural subsistence sector with \nsurplus population, and the other an expanding urban modern (manufacturing and \nservices) sector. The urban economy absorbs labor from rural areas, which holds down \nurban wages until rural surplus labor is exhausted. See Lewis (1954).\n19  Several decades ago, Arthur Lewis\u2014a Nobel Prize winner\u2014pointed out the tendency of \nthe development process to be inegalitarian: \u201cDevelopment must be inegalitarian because \nit does not start in every part of the economy at the same time\u2026There may be one such \nenclave in an economy, or several; but at the start, development enclaves include only a \nsmall minority of the population\u201d (Lewis 1976).\n20  See also the long-run analysis of regional inequality in the PRC by Fan, Kanbur, and Zhang \n(2011).\n21  According to the UN (2007), the cost of a universal social pension scheme designed to \nkeep the elderly out of poverty (at the $1-a-day poverty line) was estimated at 0.25% of \nGDP for Malaysia and about 0.5% of GDP for the Philippines and Thailand in 2005.\n22  The revised 2012 Budget Law gives a mandate to the government to increase fuel prices if \nthe average Indonesian crude oil price in the last 6-month period increases to $120.80 per \nbarrel (15% above the budget assumption of $105).\n23  ADB (2007a) provides a comprehensive discussion of the issues involved.\n24  Although India\u2019s share of services in GDP is high, it has been argued that jobs in the sector \nare mostly of low productivity and poorly paid. While the booming business process \noutsourcing sector has generated many productive and well-paid jobs, this has only \nbenefited a small group of the educated (ADB 2007a).\n25  Some argue that the PRC\u2019s low share of services is also related to the way the data for \nservices are collected and included in national income accounting (Pant 2007).\nBackground papers and references\nBackground papers\nAizenmann, J., M.

The \nkey to maintaining long-term growth\u2014diversifying the economy\u2014will \ndepend on developing a strong private sector. In turn this will require \naccess to financing and an improved business and investment climate. \nThus financial and regulatory reform making it easier to do business \nwill be essential. Non-oil activity needs to be promoted subnationally \nespecially, in order to reduce urban\u2013rural income disparities.\nWith the country\u2019s rich natural resources, agriculture appears the \nmost promising area for diversification, and some studies suggest that \nits productivity can be increased two- or threefold over the medium \nterm. Such gains would require a stronger legal framework, output \nreoriented toward cash crops, and improved market access, as the \nrelatively few produce-collection points and processing plants hold back \nearnings opportunities. Heavy investment is thus needed to develop \nagroprocessing, which requires cold-storage tanks and transport systems, \nsophisticated processing plants, and strong marketing.\nPublic investment in the non-oil sector should increasingly be financed \nby taxes rather than transfers from SOFAZ, to improve the sustainability \nof public finances. SOFAZ revenue should be used mainly to smooth out \npublic spending and finance large, one-time infrastructure projects.\nIn financial sector reform, the central bank\u2019s decision to privatize the \nInternational Bank of Azerbaijan, is expected to strengthen competition \namong banks, while the additional capital obtained for that bank should \nstrengthen banking generally (the bank\u2019s liquidity and capital shortages \nhave complicated privatization, however). Proposed consolidation of small \nbanks could also improve competition and increase efficiency, which \nwould benefit the private sector through lower banking costs and easier \naccess to finance.\nAzerbaijan improved its ranking in the World Bank\u2019s 2012 Doing \nBusiness survey to 66, aided by reforms simplifying tax payments. \nNevertheless, the country still rates poorly in many areas and was \ndowngraded in several, including access to electricity and trading across \nborders (although current energy projects should improve the electricity \nranking). Likewise, transport projects and regional cooperation programs \nmay well encourage Azerbaijan and other member countries to streamline \ntrading procedures and so boost cross-border trade.", "Georgia\nThe economy maintained robust growth in 2011, following its recovery in 2010 from the global recession, \nwhile annual inflation rose slightly.

Moreover, the prevalence \nof subsistence income limits the demand of the rural population for \noutputs from other sectors, constraining sectoral diversification of the \neconomy and hindering development spillovers between agricultural and \nnonagricultural activity.\nTo help narrow differences between urban and rural development, the \ngovernment has proposed a strategy to promote rural growth. This includes \nincreasing investment in, among others, manufacturing, agriculture \nand renewable energy, in part through public\u2013private partnerships. \nWell-designed public investment in infrastructure\u2014whether in roads, \npower, water supply, or irrigation\u2014would support private investment in \nagroprocessing and other industries, bolstering rural employment and \nreducing a persistent urban bias against agriculture.

The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, East \nAsia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the tables contain \nhistorical data from 2007 to 2011; some have forecasts for 2012 and 2013.\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible in order to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in statistical \nmethodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full comparability \nimpossible. The national income accounts section is based on the United \nNations System of National Accounts, while the balance-of-payments data are \nbased on International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical \ndata were obtained from official sources, statistical publications and databases, \nand documents of ADB, IMF, and World Bank. Projections for 2012 and \n2013 are generally staff estimates made on the basis of available quarterly or \nmonthly data, although some projections are from governments.\nMost countries report on a calendar-year basis.

GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value added of all \nresident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less subsidies on \nimports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. Constant factor \ncost measures differ from market price measures in that they exclude taxes \non production and include subsidies. Basic price valuation is the factor cost \nplus some taxes on production, such as property and payroll taxes, and \nless some subsidies, such as labor-related subsidies but not product-related \nsubsidies. Most countries use constant market price valuation. Fiji, India, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka use constant factor costs, while Maldives and Nepal \nuse basic prices. GDP data up to 2009 were excluded for Nauru because of \nconsistency issues.\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table provides \nthe growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as GDP at constant \nprices divided by the population.

Still, in the absence of any sudden \nshocks, developing Asia can manage the effects on its trade flows and financial markets.\nThe theme chapter looks at widening inequality: in spite of developing Asia\u2019s great success \nin raising living standards and reducing poverty, swelling income disparities threaten to \nundermine the pace of progress. Regional policy makers need to ensure that the benefits of \ngrowth are widely shared.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nISBN 978-92-9092-607-8\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nApril 2012\n9 789290 926078 >\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20121106133915+08'00'", "Keywords": "ado, asia gdp, asian economies, economic performance, indicators, economic forecasts, economic recovery, finance, economic development, growth rates, economic inequality, economic data, developing asia, import export, global value chains", "ModDate": "D:20121106144001+08'00'", "Subject": "The annual Asian Development Outlook provides a comprehensive analysis of economic performance for the past year and offers forecasts for the next 2 years for the 45 economies in Asia and the Pacific that make up developing Asia.", "Title": "Asian Development Outlook 2012: Confronting Rising Inequality in Asia"}}
