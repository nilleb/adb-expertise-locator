Yet the global backdrop in 2012 is one of uncertainty: \nthe eurozone is grappling with its sovereign debt crisis; and more \ngenerally, stagnation in the major industrial economies of the United \nStates, Europe, and Japan\u2014developing Asia\u2019s main trading partners\u2014\nis stunting demand for Asia\u2019s products. For these reasons, the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook 2012 forecasts that growth in developing Asia will \nease to 6.9% in 2012 (from 7.2% in 2011) before coming back to 7.3% in 2013. \nDeveloping Asia will have to adjust to lower export demand from \nthe advanced economies for some time to come. These economies are \nexpected to expand by just 1.1% in 2012 and 1.7% in 2013, as austerity \nmeasures, fiscal consolidation, and weak private domestic demand stall \ntheir growth for the next 2\u00a0years\u2014at least. Increased local demand in \nAsia has offset some of this lost trade, but it will need to take up more of \nthe slack.\n\nFortunately, the commodity price pressures that built up in early 2011 \n\nare subsiding. Inflation in the region is expected to slow to 4.7% in 2012 \nand 4.4% in 2013. Political instability in the Middle East, however, could \nlead to sudden cuts in oil supplies, resulting in temporary spikes in the \nprice of this critical commodity and reviving inflation in developing Asia.\nThe greatest risk to Asia\u2019s enviable growth rates in the near term is \nthe sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. Although a second international \nbailout of Greece in March 2012 prevented a disorderly default and \ndiminished the risk of a liquidity crunch in the short run, the crisis is \nfar from over\u2014and the eurozone is teetering on the brink of recession. \nEurope\u2019s problems are having global repercussions, but Asia is fairly well \nplaced to weather the storm. \n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s policy makers cannot, however, be complacent. \nThey need to be ready to respond if the eurozone deteriorates, particularly \nas global value chains\u2014Asia\u2019s growth-generating cross-border production \nnetworks\u2014and sudden reductions in trade finance can magnify an \nexternal shock.\n\nEven if a major external risk to the forecasts materializes, developing \nAsia has some scope for macroeconomic policy responses. Since the last \nglobal crisis eased, budget deficits have been narrowed, policy interest \nrates have been raised, and regional and global safety nets for liquidity \nsupport have been strengthened.\n\nThe eurozone crisis highlights the need for developing Asia to \n\nrebalance its economies toward domestic and regional demand and from \ndependence on exports destined for advanced countries. It also provides \nadded urgency to efforts to broaden and deepen regional cooperation, \nreduce trade barriers, and promote intraregional trade.\n\n\fvi    Foreword\n\nOf perhaps greater threat to developing Asia\u2019s long-term growth and \nstability is the widening disparity in the region between the \u201chaves\u201d and \n\u201chave nots\u201d\u2014an issue of growing concern explored in this year\u2019s theme \nchapter. Despite the region\u2019s rapid growth, the last two decades have \nwitnessed widening income disparities. Most people in the region\u2014about \nfour-fifths of them\u2014live in countries that are becoming more unequal.\n\nInequitable access to new technology, education, infrastructure, and \ninvestment are fueling the divide, particularly between rural and urban \nareas and between coastal and inland provinces. Bridging this growing \ngap is essential to promote inclusive growth, and to make growth \nsustainable. The social and political consequences of an Asia left to divide \nitself by wealth can no longer be ignored.\n\nIt is time for governments in Asia to focus on policies that share the \n\nbenefits of development fairly, and that maintain healthy growth rates. \nThese policies include fiscal policy enhancements such as increases in \nspending on education and health, conditional cash transfers for the \npoor, and more equitable revenue mobilization; more investment in \ninfrastructure to reduce imbalances between developed and lagging areas; \nand employment-friendly measures to encourage the creation of high-\nquality jobs.\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe Asian Development Outlook 2012 was prepared by the staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) from the Central and West Asia Department, East \nAsia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, Southeast \nAsia Department, Economics and Research Department, as well as resident \nmissions.

But in the absence of any sudden shocks, \ndeveloping Asia can manage the effects on its financial markets and trade flows. \nThere is no clear case for policy makers in the region to pursue short-term fiscal or \nmonetary stimulus measures.\n\nDeveloping  Asia  has  made  great  strides  in  raising  living  standards  and  reducing \npoverty, but swelling income disparities threaten to undermine that success. Regional \npolicy makers need to ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared.\n\n\fx    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\nKey messages\n\n\u2022 Despite the weak global environment, developing Asia\u2019s growth momentum \ncontinues. The region\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will cool \nsomewhat to 6.9% in 2012, from 7.2% in 2011, and then edge back up to 7.3% \nin 2013. The region is generally adjusting toward a more sustainable long-run \ngrowth path. \n\n\u2022 Strong domestic demand provided necessary support in 2011, and this will \nneed to continue in light of the soft export demand expected from the \nmajor industrial economies of the United States (US), eurozone, and Japan. \nCollectively, they are expected to expand by only 1.1% in 2012 and 1.7% in 2013.\n\n\u2022 The greatest risk to the outlook is the continued uncertainty over resolving \n\nthe sovereign debt problems in the eurozone. The \u201corderly default\u201d on Greece\u2019s \ndebt in March 2012 diminished the risk of a liquidity crunch in the short run, \nbut calls for fiscal austerity across the eurozone will act as a drag on growth. \n\n\u2022 The effects on developing Asia\u2019s financial stability and trade flows can be \n\nmanaged if there are no future shocks, but policy makers need to be ready \nto respond if the eurozone situation worsens. Global value chains\u2014the cross-\nborder production networks of developing Asia\u2014and sudden reductions in \ntrade finance tend to magnify external shocks.\n\n\u2022 Even if a major external risk to the forecasts materializes, developing Asia \nhas some scope for a macroeconomic policy response. Although the policy \nstimulus that it adopted in response to the global economic crisis has used \nup some of its policy space, the region has since regained some of that space. \nBudget deficits have come down, policy interest rates have been raised, and \nregional and global safety nets for liquidity support have been strengthened.\n\n\u2022 In the absence of further global shocks, there is no clear case for developing Asia \nto make short-term countercyclical macroeconomic policy responses. The gap \nbetween potential production and the actual level of output in most developing \nAsian economies\u2014unlike the advanced economies\u2014is not large enough to \nwarrant aggressive stimulus measures. Instead, policy makers may need to focus \non maintaining price stability while sustaining the growth momentum. \n\n\u2022 Inflation is not an immediate threat for most regional economies\u2014decelerating \ninternational commodity price rises from late 2011 have eased some of the \npressures. Consumer prices in developing Asia are forecast to rise by 4.6% \nin 2012 and 4.4% in 2013, down from 5.9% in 2011. However, the unstable \ngeopolitical situation in the Middle East could trigger further oil price spikes, \nreviving inflation in developing Asia.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xi\n\n\u2022 Many economies had been normalizing their accommodative monetary policy \nin early 2011, but they stopped or even reversed the process in the second half, \nas uncertainties in the major industrial countries damped global demand, and \nas pressures from international commodity price rises eased. If inflationary \npressures build again and capital inflows resume, there may be a need to \nreadjust monetary policy to maintain price stability.\n\n\u2022 Volatile capital flows remain a concern. Widely shifting risk perceptions among \nforeign investors in 2011 affected capital flows to developing Asia as funds \nflowed out toward risk-free assets. If changing investor sentiment causes large \nswings in capital flows again\u2014building up inflationary pressures or making \nexchange rates more volatile\u2014policy makers have various measures of \ncapital flow management at their disposal, but such measures need regional \ncoordination to be effective. Greater exchange rate flexibility may also damp \nspeculative capital movements.\n\n\u2022 Fiscal policy must balance the pursuit of long-term macroeconomic stability \nand support for growth. Debt-to-GDP ratios spiked in the region after the \nmassive fiscal responses to the global crisis, but they are now trending \ndownward, although lower growth or higher interest rates could quickly \nundermine this position. Moreover, the region faces additional sources of fiscal \nstrain in the years ahead, such as adjusting to aging populations and building \nadequate social safety nets.\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia\u2019s economies need to push through growth-supportive \n\nexpenditure policies without undermining their fiscal positions. They can \ndo this by adjusting the composition of government expenditure toward \neducation, health, and social safety nets and by expanding expenditure \nalongside revenue enhancements. Such shifts in fiscal policy will be \nincreasingly important as the region confronts rising income inequality while \nfostering continued economic expansion.\n\n\u2022 In the last two decades, income disparities widened in the \n\n11 economies that account for more than four-fifths of the region\u2019s population. \nRising inequality can damp the poverty impact of economic growth, and even \nundermine the basis of growth itself.\n\n\u2022 The forces of technological progress, globalization, and market-oriented \n\nreform\u2014the primary drivers of the region\u2019s rapid growth\u2014are putting a wedge \nbetween the incomes of the rich and poor. These factors tend to favor owners \nof capital over labor, high-skilled over low-skilled workers, and urban and \ncoastal centers over rural and inland areas.\n\n\u2022 Policy makers must meet the challenge of rising inequality without hindering \nfuture growth. They can do this through policies that put in place efficient \nfiscal measures, that promote regional balance, and that make growth more \nemployment friendly.\n\n\fxii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s outlook\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia\u2019s growth is feeling the effects of weak global demand. \nExpansion in the region\u2019s GDP moderated to 7.2% in 2011 from 2010\u2019s post\u2013\nglobal crisis rebound of 9.1%. Growth in developing Asia is expected to ease \nfurther to 6.9% in 2012 before coming back to 7.3% in 2013. These growth \nprojections are still strong compared with other regions of the world, and are \npart of the adjustment toward a more sustainable long-run growth path in the \nmore advanced regional economies.\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia\u2019s main trading partners have yet to return to their \n\nprecrisis growth rates. Growth in the major industrial countries of the US, \neurozone, and Japan was subdued in 2011, with GDP growing collectively by \na disappointing 1.2%. Their prospects are also uninspiring, with growth set to \nstall at 1.1% in 2012 before gaining some lift to 1.7% in 2013. Fiscal consolidation \nefforts and insipid private domestic demand growth will stay a drag on these \neconomies, and the slipstream from the eurozone\u2019s sovereign debt crisis is \nbuffeting that bloc back into recession. Developing Asia should expect relatively \nweak demand for its exports from these three economies in the near term.\n\n\u2022 That is why domestic demand, which is providing increasing support for \nthe region\u2019s producers, is welcome. Private consumption continues to be \na major factor in the region\u2019s growth. Yet investment weakened appreciably \ntoward end-2011, weighing on the outlook for the coming quarters, particularly \nfor export-led economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong \nKong, China; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; and Taipei,China.\n\n\u2022 The shift toward domestic demand is apparent in further declines in \n\ndeveloping Asia\u2019s current account surplus. The surplus continued to narrow \nto 2.6% of GDP in 2011 from 4.0% in 2010, reflecting moderating demand for \nexports, solid domestic demand pushing imports upward, and higher prices for \nimported oil and commodities. Steady, real exchange rate appreciation in many \nregional economies has supported this shift. The current account surplus is \nforecast to be trimmed further in 2012 to 1.9% of GDP, given continued growth \nin import demand in most economies while exports face soft global demand.\n\n\u2022 Inflation is set to recede, but volatile commodity prices are a potential \nthreat. Higher food and fuel prices drove up inflation in developing Asia to \n5.9% in 2011 from 4.4% in 2010. With relatively stable (but elevated) oil prices, \nsome respite offered by easing food prices, and lower demand for the region\u2019s \nexports, inflation in the region is forecast to slow to 4.6% in 2012 and 4.4% in \n2013. However, continued instability in the Middle East, including threats of oil \nsupply disruptions, could lead to another round of temporary price spikes, in \nturn fanning the embers of inflation in developing Asia.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xiii\n\n\u2022 Volatile capital flows remain a concern. Net capital inflows to developing \nAsia increased from the second half of 2010 and into the first half of 2011. \nThe PRC was the main beneficiary of the influx, much in the form of foreign \ndirect investment. At the onset of the eurozone turmoil and the ratings \ndowngrade of US long-term sovereign credit in the second half of 2011, \nglobal investors sharply curtailed their risk appetite. Consequently, regional \ncapital inflows slowed, even switching to outflows for some countries. \nMajor industrial countries are likely to maintain accommodative monetary \npolicies over the forecast period, and so policy makers in developing Asia \nwill need to be prepared for potentially large swings in capital flows based \non fluctuations in global investors\u2019 risk appetites.\n\nEurozone uncertainties and developing Asia\n\u2022 Continued uncertainties in the eurozone present the greatest risk \nto the global outlook. Despite recent progress easing the eurozone\u2019s \nsovereign debt problems somewhat, the weaker growth momentum in \nEurope poses risks. The voluntary private sector participation agreement \nreached in March 2012 helped restructure Greece\u2019s government debt, \nthus removing the immediate risk of a disorderly default that could \nhave sparked a global liquidity crisis. As the nature of the primary risk \nto developing Asia has shifted from financial contagion to slower export \ngrowth, developing Asia\u2019s policy makers need to prepare for the possibility \nof an extended period of low European demand for exports.\n\n\u2022 In the absence of any sudden shocks, the effects on developing Asia\u2019s \nfinancial stability and trade flows can be managed. The region\u2019s direct \nexposure to eurozone banks is relatively small, and reserves are sufficient to \ncover short-term external debt repayments, helping shield the region from \nfinancial contagion. The region is more vulnerable to the risk of a trade \nshock, the main channel through which Asia was affected by the global \nfinancial crisis. Europe is a key export market for Asia, and will remain so \nin the near future despite its declining share in recent years. But as long as \nthe slowdown is confined to the eurozone\u2014as opposed to a synchronized \nadvanced-country recession\u2014developing Asia should be able to absorb \nthe impact of lower export demand.\n\n\u2022 If the situation in the eurozone worsens to the extent of undermining \nglobal recovery, developing Asia\u2019s policy makers need to be prepared \nto act quickly. Recent history shows that two areas in particular\u2014global \nvalue chains and trade finance\u2014interact with an external trade shock to \nintensify its impact.\n\n\u00bb Global value chains\u2014the production model behind East and \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s export success\u2014amplify external shocks. The \n2008\u20132009 global trade collapse highlighted this vulnerability, as \nexternal demand for final goods dried up and the impact rippled \nthrough the region\u2019s supply chains. Asia\u2019s export production structure \n\n\fxiv    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\nand demand sources have changed little since then, and a steep drop in \nfinal goods demand from the major industrial countries would still strongly \ncompress aggregate demand for exports throughout the region. This \nvulnerability underscores the need to diversify the destinations for the \nregion\u2019s final goods and to accelerate the shift to more reliance on domestic \ndemand.\n\n \u00bb Trade finance shortages exacerbate the impact of an export demand \n\nshock that is accompanied by a credit squeeze. Trade finance is generally \nshort term and low risk, and in noncrisis periods mainly takes the form of \ncredits between firms. But during a severe crisis, these interfirm credits may \ndry up, raising firms\u2019 need for bank lending. However, the deleveraging of \nEuropean banks, which are traditionally active in supporting trade in Asia, \ncould cut into the supply of trade finance. In addition, Basel III regulations \ncould skew bank incentives away from trade finance. Policy makers may \nneed to pay special attention to trade finance when credit is squeezed, \nespecially for small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nResponding to the unsettled global environment\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia has some scope for a macroeconomic policy response if a \n\nmajor downside risk to the outlook materializes.\nThe stimulus measures adopted in response to the global crisis were \na departure from the prudent fiscal and monetary policy that regional \nauthorities had generally pursued. Budget deficits, though not back to precrisis \nlevels, have narrowed and policy interest rates have been raised, providing \nroom for a new policy response if needed. Further, regional and global safety \nnets for liquidity support have been strengthened.\n\n\u2022 However, there is no clear case for a short-term countercyclical policy \nresponse to the current global economic environment. Although the \nslowdown in Europe is putting a brake on the region\u2019s growth, the impact \nis manageable. Output gaps of most Asian economies, unlike the advanced \neconomies\u2019, are not large enough to warrant aggressive countercyclical \nsupport. \n\n\u2022 The region can fine-tune monetary policy to support growth while \n\nkeeping a focus on stabilizing inflationary expectations. In the face of \ninflationary pressures, the relatively accommodative monetary policy that \nbegan in late 2008 was tightened until mid-2011. However, in the second half of \nthe year, many countries stopped\u2014and in some cases reversed\u2014the course of \nmonetary tightening as uncertainties in the major industrial countries damped \nglobal demand and pressures from international commodity price rises eased. \nIf inflationary pressures build again and capital inflows resume, there may be a \nneed to readjust monetary policy to maintain price stability.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xv\n\n\u2022 Foreign capital flows will need to be managed to mitigate the impact of \n\ntheir fluctuations. Investors\u2019 assessments of global market risks swung widely \nafter the onset of the global crisis in 2008, and the continued global economic \nuncertainty suggests that moves may be similarly volatile in the forecast \nperiod. If large swings of capital flows to the region reoccur, various measures \nof capital flow management may be deployed, but they require regional \ncoordination to be effective. Greater exchange rate flexibility may also help \ndeter speculative capital flows. \n\n\u2022 Fiscal policy must balance the pursuit of long-term macroeconomic \n\nstability with support to growth momentum. Debt-to-GDP ratios in the \nregion spiked due to the fiscal response to the global crisis, but they are \nnow generally on a downward path. However, governments have no room \nfor complacency, since sustained falling debt ratios depend on continued \nfavorable growth and interest rates, which are subject to sudden reversal in the \ncase of a renewed global economic downturn or a financial crisis. Moreover, \nthe region faces additional sources of fiscal strain in the years ahead, such as \nadjusting to aging populations and building adequate social safety nets.\n\n\u2022 Growth-supportive expenditure policies can be achieved without \n\nundermining fiscal positions. This can be done with budget-neutral measures \nthat shift the composition of government spending to education, health, \nand social safety nets, and by expanding expenditure alongside revenue \nenhancements. Such shifts in fiscal policy will be increasingly important as the \nregion confronts rising income inequality while fostering continued economic \nexpansion\u2014an issue analyzed in the theme chapter of Asian Development \nOutlook 2012.\n\n\fxvi    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n\u2022 Global factors have given way to country-specific issues in developing \nAsia\u2019s outlook. In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in \nthe third quarter of 2008, most regional economies were affected by the \nsharp drop in global demand and subsequent recovery. But as the global \nenvironment has become less volatile\u2014although growth is still slower than \nbefore the global crisis\u2014country- or subregion-specific shocks are playing a \nbigger role, leading to wider variation among economic trends at those levels. \nFactors include natural disasters, the availability of resources, and the strength \nof domestic demand.\n\n\u2022 East Asia\u2019s growth will moderate to 7.4% in 2012 but will still lead the \n\nother subregions. Growth has decelerated markedly since the 9.8% rebound \nin 2010, dropping to 8.0% in 2011 as the deteriorating global outlook in the \nsecond half of 2011 affected directly the contribution to growth of net exports \nand indirectly investment and consumption. An uptick to 7.7% is forecast for \n2013. Growth for the PRC is forecast to moderate to 8.5% and 8.7% in the next \n2 years (though this still exceeds the growth envisaged in the 12th Five-Year \nPlan). East Asia\u2019s inflation is forecast to slow to 3.7% in the next 2 years. \nThe exception is Mongolia, where double-digit rates will prevail as surging \ngovernment and private spending boosts domestic demand.\n\n\u2022 South Asia will see growth improve a shade in 2012 to 6.6%. Growth in 2011 \nfell sharply to 6.4%, mainly reflecting slumping investment and India\u2019s marked \nmonetary tightening in the face of persistent inflation. Growth in Pakistan \ndeclined because of disastrous flooding, while Bangladesh and Sri Lanka did \nwell on brisk exports. The pace of India\u2019s growth is projected to edge up to \n7.0% in 2012 and 7.5% in 2013, providing most of the lift for subregional growth \nto reach 7.1% in 2013. Pakistan\u2019s growth will advance only slightly in both years \nbecause electricity will remain a bottleneck on the supply side. South Asia\u2019s \ninflation is expected to fall from 9.4% last year to 7.7% in 2012 and further to \n6.9% in 2013. Some cutbacks in the heavy fuel and electricity subsidies in most \ncountries are expected, and will set a floor to how far inflation can fall. \n\n\u2022 Growth in Southeast Asia for 2012 is seen picking up to 5.2%. Overall \n\nGDP growth decelerated to 4.6% in 2011, as Southeast Asia was hard hit by \nweakened export markets, domestic policy tightening, and natural disasters \nthat disrupted trade and production\u2014only partly redeemed by strong growth \nin the subregion\u2019s largest economy, Indonesia. The pickup in growth in 2012 \nlargely reflects recovery in Thailand from major flooding as its growth rate \nrebounds from 0.1% in 2011 to 5.5% in 2012. Subregional growth is forecast to \nclimb to 5.7% in 2013. Indonesia will continue its solid growth performance, \nexpanding by 6.4% in 2012 and 6.7% in 2013. Higher food and fuel prices drove \nup aggregate inflation to 5.5% in 2011, but assumed relatively steady global oil \nprices and easing food prices in 2012 seem likely to slow inflation to 4.4% over \nthe next 2 years.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xvii\n\n\u2022 Central Asia should just about keep up the momentum at 6.1% in \n\n2012 and 6.2% in 2013. This year\u2019s outturn reflects the combination of a \nweak eurozone and slower growth in the Russian Federation, offset by a \nbounceback in growth in Azerbaijan. In 2011, strong demand for petroleum \nboosted growth in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, but Azerbaijan\u2019s minimal \ngrowth, due to temporary closure of some oil production facilities, dragged \ndown the subregional rate. Inflation accelerated in 2011 to 9.0%, mainly on \nrapid increases in world fuel and food prices. More moderate food price \ninflation and expected stable oil prices are seen helping slow inflation to \n7.2% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013. \n\n\u2022 The Pacific economies are relatively insulated from developments in \nthe eurozone. Robust expansion in the resource-exporting economies \nof Papua New Guinea (which accounts for roughly 60% of Pacific GDP), \nTimor-Leste, and Solomon Islands, and strong growth in the tourism-\noriented economies of the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, and Vanuatu, lifted \nsubregional growth to 7.0% in 2011\u2014making this the only subregion to \npost faster growth in 2011 than 2010. Yet the Pacific is forecast to slow to \n6.0% and 4.1% over the next 2 years due to lower resource export revenue, \nthe winding down of infrastructure projects that stimulated growth in 2011 \n(Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu), lower international \nagricultural prices, and flooding impacts (Fiji). Inflation is expected to fall to \n6.6% in 2012 from 8.6% in 2011.\n\n\fxviii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\nSpecial theme: Confronting rising inequality in Asia\n\nAsia\u2019s rising inequality\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia\u2019s impressive growth continues, but is paced by a new \nchallenge\u2014inequality on the rise. Over the last few decades, the region \nhas lifted people out of poverty at an unprecedented rate. But more recent \nexperience contrasts with the \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d story that characterized \nthe transformation of the newly industrialized economies in the 1960s and \n1970s. In the 11 economies that account for more than four-fifths of the region\u2019s \npopulation, income disparities expanded during the last two decades\u2014despite \nthe region\u2019s world-beating performance in raising average incomes and \nreducing poverty.\n\n\u00bb Inequality widened in 11 of the 28 economies with comparable data, \n\nincluding the three most populous countries and drivers of the region\u2019s \nrapid growth\u2014the PRC, India, and Indonesia. From the early 1990s to \nthe late 2000s, the Gini coefficient\u2014a common measure of inequality\u2014\nworsened from 32 to 43 in the PRC, from 33 to 37 in India, and from 29 to 39 \nin Indonesia. Treating developing Asia as a single unit, its Gini coefficient \nwent from 39 to 46 in that period.\n\n\u00bb Although Asia\u2019s inequality levels are generally below those in other \n\ndeveloping regions\u2014the average Gini coefficient across developing Asian \neconomies was 37 compared with an average of 52 for Latin American \neconomies\u2014incomes are becoming more equitable elsewhere. \n\n\u2022 Inequality of opportunity is also prevalent in developing Asia. Disparities \nin the means to raise one\u2019s living standards\u2014such as physical assets (e.g., \ncapital and land), human capital (e.g., education and health), and market \naccess (e.g., labor and finance)\u2014are common. Unequal access to public \nservices, especially education and health, is central to generating inequality of \nopportunity. National household surveys conducted in the mid- to late 2000s \nrevealed many facets of diverging opportunities:\n\n\u00bb School-age children from households in the poorest income quintile were \nthree to five times as likely to be out of primary and secondary school as \ntheir peers in the richest quintile in some countries. The situation was even \nmore dire for tertiary education where poorer college-age individuals were \n10\u201320 times more likely not to attend college than their better-off peers.\n\u00bb Infant mortality rates among the poorest households in some countries \n\nwere double or treble the rates among the richest households. In the most \nextreme examples, the chance of a poor infant dying at birth was more \nthan 10 times higher than for an infant born to a rich family. \n\n\u00bb With few exceptions, the region\u2019s economies have made significant progress \ntoward gender parity in primary and secondary education. Yet high gender \ndisparities in tertiary education remain in South Asia and the Pacific.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xix\n\n\u2022 Inequality of opportunity is a crucial factor in widening income inequality \nin developing Asia. Moreover, these two forms of inequality can lead to a \nvicious circle as unequal opportunities create income disparities, which in turn \nlead to differences in future opportunities for individuals and households.\n\nWhy inequality matters\n\u2022 Rising inequality can damp the poverty impact of economic growth. If \n\ninequality had remained stable in the Asian economies where it increased, the \nsame growth in 1990\u20132010 would have taken about 240 million more people \nout of poverty\u2014equivalent to 6.5% of developing Asia\u2019s population in 2010 \nand 8.0% of those countries with rising inequality.\n\n\u2022 Inequality can weaken the basis of growth itself. High and rising inequality \ncan curb medium-term growth by reducing social cohesion, undermining the \nquality of governance, and increasing pressure for inefficient populist policies.\n\n\u2022 Asian policy makers are becoming more concerned about inequality. In \nan informal, web-based survey of Asian policy makers in January\u2013February \n2012, over 65% of respondents agreed that income inequality in their countries \nwas high or very high. Almost all felt that incomes in their countries were \nbecoming more unequal. Moreover, a majority believed that success in \nreducing poverty was insufficient to justify widening inequality. This concern is \nincreasingly being addressed through development plans across the region, as \nthey include explicit goals to make growth more inclusive.\n\nDrivers of inequality\n\u2022 Technological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014the \nprimary drivers of the region\u2019s growth\u2014are the key forces behind the \nrise in inequality. These forces combined have opened new opportunities \nfor economies to prosper, but have not benefited all people equally. Together, \nthese drivers explain not only the increase in overall inequality, but also the \nsharply rising incomes of the very rich in some countries.\n\n\u2022 These forces affect income differences through three channels: capital, \nskill, and spatial bias. The bias toward physical capital reduces labor\u2019s share \nof national income while increasing the income share of the owners of capital. \nSimilarly, the heightened demand for better skilled workers raises the premium \non their earnings. And spatial disparities are becoming more acute: locations \nwith superior infrastructure, market access, and scale economies\u2014such as \nurban centers and coastal areas\u2014are better able to benefit from changing \ncircumstances.\n\n\u00bb Labor\u2019s share of total income is falling in many economies in the region. \nBetween the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, labor income as a share of \nmanufacturing output in the formal sector fell from 48% to 42% in the PRC \nand from 37% to 22% in India. The employment intensity of growth in Asia \nis lower than the global average and has declined in recent decades.\n\n\fxx    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\n \u00bb Differences in educational attainment can explain 25%\u201335% of inequality \nbetween households in many regional economies, and the earnings \npremium for skills and tertiary education has increased in recent years.\n \u00bb The combined contribution of rural\u2013urban and interprovincial differences \n\nto total inequality ranges from 13% in Sri Lanka to 54% in the PRC. The gaps \nbetween urban and rural incomes in developing Asia have increased, as \nhave those between prosperous and lagging areas.\n\nPolicy priorities for confronting rising inequality\n\n\u2022 Because the forces behind rising inequality are also the engines of \nproductivity and income growth, policy makers should not hinder \ntheir progress. A distinction needs to be made between the income \ndifferences that arise as economies take advantage of the new opportunities \nof technology, trade, and efficiency-enhancing reforms; and those that are \ngenerated by unequal access to market opportunities and public services. This \nlatter source of inequality requires a policy response since it gets magnified by \nthe forces, leads to inefficiency, and undermines the sustainability of growth.\n\n\u2022 Governments can address rising inequalities through several policy \nchannels, three of which are highlighted in the theme chapter:\n\n\u00bb Efficient fiscal policies. These include: \n\n\u25c6 spending more on education  and health, especially for poorer \n\nhouseholds;\n\n\u25c6 developing and spending more on better targeted social protection \n\nschemes, including conditional cash transfers that target income to the \npoorest but also incentivize the buildup of human capital; \n\n\u25c6 reducing or eliminating general price subsidies (such as on fuel) and \ncompensating the impact on the poor by targeted transfers; and \n\u25c6 broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration for \n\ngreater and more equitable revenue mobilization.\n\u00bb Interventions to improve regional balance. These include:\n\n\u25c6 improving transport and communications networks between \n\ndeveloped and poor regions; \n\n\u25c6 creating growth poles in lagging areas; \n\u25c6 using fiscal transfers to poorer areas in order to accelerate investment \nin human capital and improve access to public services there; and\n\n\u25c6 removing barriers to within-country migration.\n\n\u00bb Policies to make growth more employment friendly. These include:\n\n\u25c6 encouraging structural transformation to create a greater number of \nproductive jobs, and maintaining a balanced sectoral composition of \ngrowth between manufacturing, services, and agriculture;\n\n\u25c6 supporting development of small and medium-sized enterprises;\n\u25c6 removing factor market distortions that favor capital over labor;\n\u25c6 establishing or strengthening labor market institutions; and \n\u25c6 introducing public employment schemes as a temporary bridge to \n\naddress pockets of unemployment and underemployment.\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xxi\n\n\u2022 Developing Asia must turn back the tide of rising inequality. The region has \nenjoyed a remarkable period of growth and poverty reduction, but the new \nglobal realities of technological progress, more globally integrated markets, \nand greater market orientation are magnifying the effects of inequalities in \nphysical and human capital. Asian policy makers need to redouble their efforts \nto equalize opportunities in employment, education, and health to make \ngrowth more inclusive. Without such policies of job creation and efficient \nredistribution to enhance growth, Asia may be pulled into inefficient populist \npolicies, which would help neither growth nor equity.\n\n\fxxii    ADO 2012\u2014Highlights\n\n                                         Table 1  Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\nSubregion/Economy\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nCentral Asia\nAzerbaijan\nKazakhstan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nBangladesh\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nThe Pacific \nFiji\nPapua New Guinea\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n3.2\n9.3\n1.2\n\n6.7\n9.2\n-2.6\n0.3\n-1.8\n\n7.5\n5.7\n8.4\n1.7\n3.5\n\n1.4\n4.6\n-1.6\n1.1\n-1.0\n-2.3\n5.3\n\n4.2\n-1.3\n6.0\n\n6.0\n\n6.6\n5.0\n7.0\n\n9.8\n10.4\n7.0\n6.2\n10.7\n\n7.8\n6.1\n8.4\n3.8\n8.0\n\n7.9\n6.2\n7.2\n7.6\n14.8\n7.8\n6.8\n\n5.5\n-0.2\n7.4\n\n9.1\n\n6.2\n0.1\n7.5\n\n8.0\n9.2\n5.0\n3.6\n4.0\n\n6.4\n6.7\n6.9\n2.4\n8.3\n\n4.6\n6.5\n5.1\n3.7\n4.9\n0.1\n5.9\n\n7.0\n2.1\n8.9\n\n7.2\n\n6.1\n4.1\n6.0\n\n7.4\n8.5\n3.0\n3.4\n3.4\n\n6.6\n6.2\n7.0\n3.6\n7.0\n\n5.2\n6.4\n4.0\n4.8\n2.8\n5.5\n5.7\n\n6.0\n1.0\n7.5\n\n6.9\n\n6.2\n3.5\n6.5\n\n7.7\n8.7\n4.5\n4.0\n4.6\n\n7.1\n6.0\n7.5\n4.0\n8.0\n\n5.7\n6.7\n5.0\n5.0\n4.5\n5.5\n6.2\n\n4.1\n1.2\n4.5\n\n7.3\n\nNotes: Developing Asia refers to 44 developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank \nand Brunei Darussalam, an unclassified regional member; East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic \nof China; Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Mongolia; and Taipei,China; Southeast Asia \ncomprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam; South Asia comprises Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka;  \n(continued on the next page)\n\n\fADO 2012\u2014Highlights   xxiii\n\n                                                       Table 2  Inflation (% per year)\n\nSubregion/Economy\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nCentral Asia\nAzerbaijan\nKazakhstan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nBangladesh\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nThe Pacific \nFiji\nPapua New Guinea\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n5.9\n1.5\n7.3\n\n-0.1\n-0.7\n0.6\n2.8\n-0.9\n\n5.2\n6.7\n3.8\n17.0\n3.5\n\n2.7\n4.8\n0.6\n4.2\n0.6\n-0.9\n6.9\n\n5.3\n3.7\n6.9\n\n1.4\n\n7.0\n5.7\n7.1\n\n3.1\n3.3\n2.3\n3.0\n1.0\n\n9.4\n7.3\n9.6\n10.1\n6.2\n\n4.1\n5.1\n1.7\n3.8\n2.8\n3.3\n9.2\n\n5.5\n7.8\n6.0\n\n4.4\n\n9.0\n7.9\n8.3\n\n5.0\n5.4\n5.3\n4.0\n1.4\n\n9.4\n8.8\n9.0\n13.7\n6.7\n\n5.5\n5.4\n3.2\n4.8\n5.2\n3.8\n18.6\n\n8.6\n8.7\n8.7\n\n5.9\n\n7.2\n9.0\n6.5\n\n3.7\n4.0\n3.8\n3.0\n1.5\n\n7.7\n11.0\n7.0\n12.0\n8.0\n\n4.4\n5.5\n2.4\n3.7\n3.0\n3.4\n9.5\n\n6.6\n5.1\n7.0\n\n4.6\n\n7.3\n8.5\n6.8\n\n3.7\n4.0\n3.3\n3.0\n1.6\n\n6.9\n8.5\n6.5\n10.0\n7.0\n\n4.4\n5.0\n2.8\n4.1\n2.5\n3.3\n11.5\n\n5.4\n3.0\n6.0\n\n4.4\n\n(continued from the previous page)\nCentral Asia comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan; and The Pacific comprises the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Palau, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n\nData for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are recorded on a fiscal-year basis.

The cautious optimism expressed by \npundits in the early part of the year gave way to warnings of a \u201cdouble \ndip\u201d by midyear.\n\nFirst, March\u2019s earthquake and nuclear disaster in Japan devastated \n\nits already faltering economy. Then the sovereign debt crisis in the \neurozone periphery erupted, generating inadequate responses that were \nunable to convince financial markets that the situation would not get \nout of hand. Finally, partisan brinksmanship in the United \nStates (US) over the national debt ceiling led to the first-ever \nloss of the triple-A rating on its long-term sovereign credit.\n\nIn the early months of 2012, caution rather than optimism \n\nis the more dominant sentiment for global prospects. The \nworkout of Greece\u2019s sovereign debt in March 2012 did not \nconvince investors that the crisis was fully resolved, as \nevidenced by continued elevated credit default spreads for \nother eurozone countries (Figure\u00a01.1.1).\n\nDeveloping Asia is feeling the weight of these weaknesses \n\namong the major industrial countries. Yet it has managed \nto grow, steadily. The worst of the global crisis may be past, \nbut as 2011 demonstrated, policy makers need to be prepared \nfor any eventuality. But the appropriate policy response is \nless clear than in the financial crisis years, given the current \nuncertain environment.\n\n1.1.1  Ten-year US dollar-denominated credit default swaps \n\nFrance\nItaly\n\nGermany\nPortugal \n\nIreland\nSpain\n\nBasis points\n\n1,200\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJan11\n\nJul\n\nJan\n12\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 28 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nThis chapter was written by Arief Ramayandi, Martin Bodenstein, Benno Ferrarini, \nShikha Jha, Minsoo Lee, Donghyun Park, Pilipinas Quising, Changyong Rhee, Lea \nSumulong, Akiko Terada-Hagiwara, and Joseph E.

Policy makers will need to navigate risks of \ncommodity price spikes and volatile capital flows. But more importantly, \nthey need to follow the only half-resolved eurozone debt problems closely, \nand be ready to act.\n\nMajor industrial economies: Erratic recovery\nThe disappointing growth performance of the major industrial countries \nin 2011, when growth of gross domestic product (GDP) fell to 1.2%, is \nexpected to extend further into 2012 and even 2013 (Table 1.1.1). Fiscal \nconsolidation efforts and weak private domestic demand growth will \nremain a drag on them.

Positive news for these economies has come \nonly from the US, which seems to have overcome a soft patch \nat the start of 2011 with late-year momentum expected to carry \nforward further into 2012. Yet even there, growth prospects are \nmodest for the next 2\u00a0years.\n\nThe expansion in world trade (measured by merchandise \n\nexports) is expected to be modest, at around 3.8% in 2012, \nbefore picking up to 5.4% in 2013. Weak demand in several key \neconomies remains the main factor in the slow growth. The \nanxieties felt after the global crisis hit, that economies would \nresort to protectionist measures, have largely quieted.\n\nLooking at each economy in turn, budget cuts will strongly \n\naffect the US outlook. While the recovery in private demand \nwill be able to offset them, it still lacks the momentum to take \ngrowth back up to precrisis rates. The housing market, though, is \nturning in some good news, as housing starts and permits have \nstarted to rise.\n\nAgainst this, the unemployment rate is staying stubbornly \n\nhigh (Figure\u00a01.1.2), despite some decline, and high household \ndebt is crimping private consumption spending. Similarly, firms \nare reluctant to invest, given the modest growth outlook and \nsignificant spare production capacity. Still, inflation appears \nset to stay low and stable, suggesting that the Federal Reserve \nis unlikely to change the direction of monetary policy over the \nforecast period.\n\nThe eurozone, where GDP contracted in the last quarter of \n2011, is the main global concern. Political controversy about the \nright approach to resolve the sovereign debt crisis (discussed \nin detail in Box 1.2.1, below), an interest rate increase by the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) in July, as well as deep fiscal cuts \nacross the bloc, all played a role. \n\nIn 2012, the eurozone is on course to see recession because \nof the implementation of fiscal consolidation measures, although \nwith major differences among countries. The expected loss \nin momentum is reflected in softening industrial confidence \n(Figure\u00a01.1.3). In sharp contrast to 2011, however, the ECB, by \nbringing interest rates back down and pumping about \u20ac1\u00a0trillion \ninto eurozone banks, has removed doubts about its willingness \nand ability to act as lender of last resort, easing the impact of \npolitical disagreement among member countries on the course of \nthe debt crisis.\n\nIn Japan, although reconstruction efforts started to be \nfelt in the second half of 2011, supply-chain disruptions after \nThailand\u2019s floods in August\u2013November 2011, a persistently strong \nyen (Figure\u00a01.1.4), and faltering foreign demand contributed to \nstymie any real improvement in macroeconomic conditions.\n\nJapan\u2019s 2012 performance should be somewhat better because \n\nof the low base last year (when the economy contracted) and \ncontinued reconstruction expenditure. Growth will taper off to \n1.5% in 2013, which is close to the economy\u2019s potential growth \nrate, as no further supplementary budgets are likely.\n\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    5\n\n1.1.2  Unemployment, United States \n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: US Department of Commerce.

Its growth moderated to 7.2% \nfor the full year\u2014down from the post\u2013global financial crisis \nrebound of 9.1%. This was partly the effect of the higher \nbase after the strong growth in 2010, but also the impact of \nnormalizing fiscal and monetary policy. This moderating \ntrend is expected to continue into the near future, taking \nregional growth to 6.9% in 2012, before it picks up to 7.3% in \n2013 (Figure\u00a01.1.5). Domestic private demand is driving growth, \nhelping narrow current account surpluses, while inflation \npressures are currently in check.\n\nImportance of private domestic demand\n\nAs the global recovery seemed to be taking hold in late \n2010 and early 2011, authorities in developing Asia began to \nnormalize monetary and fiscal policy. Consequently, the effects \nof the policy stimulus\u2014launched to cushion the global crisis \nimpacts\u2014dissipated, and the role of domestic private demand \nbecame more important in driving developing Asia.\n\nHowever, the slowdown in the major industrial countries in \nmid-2011 (especially the heightened uncertainty emanating from \nthe eurozone) and the deteriorating terms of trade from elevated \noil prices helped slow the region\u2019s growth. As a result, the engines \nof growth in 2011 were not as uniform and robust as those in \n2010. Among 10 leading economies, which account for 93% of \nthe region\u2019s output, investment\u2019s contribution to growth dropped \nsharply in seven (Figure\u00a01.1.6).\n\nInvestment weakened sharply toward end-2011, weighing \non the outlook for the coming quarters, particularly in open \neconomies such as Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; \nMalaysia; Taipei,China; and Thailand. The fading contribution \nof investments in 2011 is characterized by inventory destocking \nin four out of six economies (Figure\u00a01.1.7), a trend that resembles \nthe path in the immediate postcrisis year.\n\nAssuming that the global economy gradually picks up toward \n\nend-2012, private investment and restocking of inventories are \nexpected to drive capital formation this year, though moderately. \n(In Thailand, it will be public investment, to support post-flood \nreconstruction.) The PRC economy is set to make a soft landing \nafter growth averaged above 10% in the 5 years 2007\u20132011\u2014\nsteadily declining credit growth suggests investment will likely \nmoderate\u2014unless the authorities push through a further stimulus \nto mitigate the effects of the decline in trade.\n\nBacked by the steady improvement in labor markets, \n\nhowever, private consumption appeared to hold up well in 2011, \nalbeit to a lesser degree. Unlike the previous year, it became the \none common growth driver in 2011.\n\nUp-to-date unemployment data are sparse, but among nine \n\n1.1.5  GDP growth, developing Asia\n\n5-year moving average\n\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.6  GDP growth, developing Asia\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points\n20\n\nA B\n\nA B A B\n\nA B\n\nA B\n\nA B A B\n\nPRC HKG IND INO KOR MAL\n\nPHI\n\nA B\n\nSIN\n\nA B\n\nTAP\n\nA B\n\nTHA\n\nA\u00a0=\u00a02010; B\u00a0=\u00a02011.\nNote: 10 countries with available data on GDP by expenditure. \nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.7  Contribution to growth in investments\n\nTotal investment\nGFCF\nChange in stocks\n\nGFCF\u2014public  \nGFCF\u2014private  \n\nPercentage points\n\n2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011\n\nHKG\n\nTAP\n\nTHA\n\nKOR\n\nMAL\n\nSIN\n\nGFCF = Gross fixed capital formation; HKG\u00a0=\u00a0Hong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China; KOR\u00a0=\u00a0Rep. of \nKorea; MAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia; SIN\u00a0=\u00a0Singapore; TAP\u00a0=\u00a0Taipei,China; THA\u00a0=\u00a0Thailand.\nNote: Economies for which data are available.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEast and Southeast Asian economies, unemployment has declined \nto closer to pre\u2013global crisis rates, if not below (Figure\u00a01.1.8). While \nrising real wages in some countries may continue lifting consumer \nsentiment a little, the chances appear slim.\n\nIndeed, retail sales\u2014showing signs of deceleration in four \neconomies in East Asia that account for around two-thirds of \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s GDP\u2014suggest that private consumption may \nslow this year (Figure\u00a01.1.9). Of the nine economies, relatively bright \nspots for retail sales are in Southeast Asia: Indonesia and Viet Nam \nare forecast to maintain growth this year and to accelerate further \nnext year. Thailand showed a sharp deterioration in retail sales \nafter the devastating flooding, but is expected to join the relatively \nresilient economies of the subregion this year in recovery. Other \nmore open economies in Southeast Asia, however\u2014Malaysia and \nSingapore\u2014may follow the East Asian economies.\n\nVarying growth drivers across subregions\n\nFrom the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 \nthrough the initial stages of the global recovery in 2010, external \nfactors generally dominated developing Asia\u2019s outlook such that \ncountries and subregions largely moved in sync. In contrast, \n2011 has seen general factors give way to country-specific factors \ndriving the outlook.\n\nAs external demand has swung less widely\u2014although it is \nstill softer than before the global crisis\u2014country- or subregion-\nspecific shocks are playing an important role, leading to \nvariation among economic trends at those levels. Factors include \nnatural disasters, the availability of resources, and the strength \nof domestic demand.\n\nThe deteriorating global outlook in the second half of 2011 \naffected directly the contribution to growth of net exports and \nindirectly investment and consumption. The deteriorating terms \nof trade from elevated oil prices also contributed (Figure\u00a01.1.10). \nEast Asia\u2019s vulnerability to slowing external demand\u2014especially \nfrom major industrialized countries\u2014is well illustrated by the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s slump. That country\u2019s growth rate in 2011 \nfell by a full percentage point below what had been forecast but \nconsistent with altered expectations concerning the eurozone, \nthe US, and Japanese economies. Investment was flat, as \nbusinesses and investors became much more cautious. Despite \nthe uncertain global context, exports increased by 20% and \naccounted for more than 50% of GDP growth.\n\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    7\n\n1.1.8  Unemployment\n\nPRC \nSingapore\nTaipei,China\n\nKorea, Rep. of \nHong Kong, China\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\nMalaysia\nIndonesia\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n11\n\nQ3\n\n1.1.9  Retail sales\n\nEast Asia\n\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nHong Kong, China\nTaipei,China\n\nyear-on-year % change, \n3-month moving average\n\n \n\nJan\n \n2010\n\n Apr\n \n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\n \n\n Oct\n\n \n\n \n\n Apr\n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\n \n\n Oct\n\nJan\n \n11\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nSingapore\n\nyear on year % change, \n3-month moving average \n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\nThis is generally the storyline for all five countries in East \n\nAsia.

An uptick to 7.7% \nis forecast for 2013. Growth for the PRC is forecast to moderate \nto 8.5% and 8.7% in the next 2 years (though this still exceeds \nthe growth envisaged in the 12th Five-Year Plan). Hong Kong, \nChina; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China are all expected \nto experience continued growth below their potential growth, \nwhich for these countries is in the range of 4\u20135%.\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nThailand\n\nTaipei,China\n\nSingapore\n\nMalaysia\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nIn Southeast Asia, GDP growth decelerated to 4.6% in \n2011, hard hit by weakened export markets (as in East Asia), \ndomestic policy tightening, and natural disasters disrupting \ntrade and production\u2014only partly redeemed by strong growth \nin the largest economy, Indonesia. Rising inflation in the first half of 2011 \nprompted monetary policy tightening in most countries. Furthermore, \nfiscal stimulus instituted during the global recession continued to be \nwithdrawn in several countries. In particular, government outlays fell \nsteeply in the Philippines, in part because an introduction of governance \nreforms delayed decisions and disbursements, hurting GDP growth.\n\nGrowth in Southeast Asia is seen picking up to 5.2% for 2012 and to \n5.7% in 2013. The pickup in 2012 largely reflects recovery in Thailand from \nmajor flooding as growth rebounds from 0.1% in 2011 to 5.5% in 2012. The \nPhilippines will also contribute by picking up from bouts of weakness last \nyear in electronics and government investment. Indonesia will continue \nits solid performance, expanding by 6.4% in 2012 and 6.7% in 2013. \n\nEconomies in Southeast Asia would generally benefit for much of 2012 \n\nfrom space for easing monetary policies, and fiscal stimulus if \nglobal trade and financial conditions deteriorate further. Still, \nslowing world trade and international financial uncertainties will \ndamp economic activity, notably in trade-dependent Malaysia and \nSingapore, where growth is set to slow this year.\n\nFor South Asia, growth in 2011 fell sharply to 6.4% from 7.8% \nin 2010. The fall was largely determined by the marked slowdown \nin India where growth fell to 6.9% from 8.4% in 2010, mainly \nreflecting its marked monetary tightening in the face of persistent \ninflation and slumping investment. Growth in Pakistan declined \nin 2011 because of disastrous flooding, although Bangladesh and \nSri Lanka did well on brisk exports.\n\nSouth Asia will see growth improve a shade in 2012 to 6.6%. \nThe pace of India\u2019s growth is projected to edge up to 7.0% in 2012 \nand 7.5% in 2013, providing most of the lift for subregional growth \nto reach 7.1% in 2013. Despite recovery from flooding, Pakistan\u2019s growth will \nadvance only slightly in both years as electricity will remain a bottleneck \non the supply side. Growth in Bangladesh is expected to be limited to about \n6%, well below the government\u2019s objective, as policies will need to contain \ninflation and a deterioration in the balance of payments. \n\nIn Central Asia, growth declined in 2011 to 6.2% from 6.6% in 2010, \n\nas a drop in oil production led to virtually zero growth in Azerbaijan, \nwhere closure of one of its three oil platforms for safety reasons caused a \ndrop in oil output. Yet six of the eight countries saw higher growth, on \ncontinued economic recovery in the Russian Federation and the US, plus \nstronger eurozone demand for commodities. For Kazakhstan, the economy \n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    9\n\nexpanded by 7.5% as a steep rise in natural gas exports offset a decline in oil \nproduction, and good weather more than doubled its grain output.\n\nCentral Asia should just about keep up the momentum at 6.1% in \n2012 and 6.2% in 2013. This year\u2019s outturn reflects the combination of a \nweak eurozone and slower growth in the Russian Federation, offset by a \nbounceback in growth in Azerbaijan. In 2013, a more favorable outlook for \nthe global economy, including the Russian Federation, is expected to raise \ngrowth rates in five countries, balanced by declining growth in three.\n\nPacific countries are quite insulated from events in the eurozone. Robust \n\nexpansion in the resource-exporting economies of Papua New Guinea \n(accounting for roughly half of Pacific GDP), Timor-Leste, and Solomon \nIslands, and strong growth in the tourism-oriented economies of Cook \nIslands, Fiji, Palau, and Vanuatu, lifted subregional growth to 7.0% in 2011\u2014\nmaking this the only subregion to post faster growth in 2011 than 2010.\nYet the Pacific is forecast to slow to 6.0% and 4.1% over the next \n\n2 years due to lower resource export revenue, the winding \ndown of infrastructure projects that stimulated growth in 2011 \n(Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Vanuatu), lower \ninternational agricultural prices, and flooding impacts (Fiji). \nWhile tourism is expected to continue to support growth, \nremittances are not expected to recover in the near future in \nview of the weak economic outlook.\n\nNarrowing current account surplus\n\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s current account surplus continued \nnarrowing, to 2.6% of GDP in 2011 from 4.0% the previous year. \nContributing factors were a moderation in demand for exports \nand the upward impact on imports of solid domestic demand \nand higher prices for imported oil and commodities. The \nsurplus is expected to decline further in 2012 to 1.9% of GDP, \nmarking the combined impact of most regional economies\u2019 continued \ngrowth in demand for consumer and capital imports and of soft global \ndemand for exports (Figure\u00a01.1.12).\n\nGlobal imbalances further widened as a share of global GDP in 2011, \nthough they remain well below their precrisis peaks (Figure\u00a01.1.13). On the \ndeficit side, the rise in saving and fall in investment in the US \nwas offset by the widening deficit in major eurozone economies.\nOn the surplus side, resource-rich economies in the Middle \n\nEast as well as the Russian Federation expanded their current \naccount surpluses, backed by the surges in oil and commodity \nprices. Although declining as a share of its own GDP, \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s robust growth increased the relative size of \nthe region such that it continued to account for about half the \nglobal current account surplus (1.6% of world GDP) in 2011.\nThis suggests, then, that efforts for structural adjustments \nin various sectors are needed. With a more favorable growth \noutlook vis-\u00e0-vis the US, eurozone, and Japan, developing Asia \ncould take the opportunity of further strengthening its domestic \npolicies to support the structural adjustments toward a better \nbalance between domestic and external demand, leading to more \nsustainable growth.\n\n1.1.12  Current accounts, developing Asia\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n% of GDP\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n% of world GDP\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n  Central Asia\n\n  East Asia\n\n  South Asia\n\n  The Pacific\n\n  Southeast \nAsia\n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.13  World current account balance\n\nUnited States\nMiddle East\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nOther industrial countries\n\nRussian Federation\nJapan\nRest of developing Asia\nRest of the world\n\n2000 01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: ADB calculations using data from International Monetary Fund, World \nEconomic Outlook Database, September 2011; Asian Development Outlook \ndatabase.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f10    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nInflation subdued\u2014but oil could give a nasty shock\n\nThe recent rising trend in global commodity prices is expected to pause, \ntempering inflationary pressures (Box\u00a01.1.1). Despite the recent surge in \ncrude oil prices driven by Middle East political instability, the average \noil price is forecast at $111 per barrel in 2012, roughly its 2011 average.\nContinued slow recovery in industrial countries and decelerating economic \ngrowth in emerging economies will damp growth in oil demand.\n\nIn 2013, oil prices are forecast to diminish a little to $106 per barrel.\nAlthough staying high, food prices are projected to decline in 2012 and \n2013 from their 2011 peak, reflecting improved supply prospects and weak \ndemand growth.\n\nAcross subregions, higher food and fuel prices drove up \ninflation in developing Asia to 5.9% in 2011 from 4.4% in 2010 \n(Figure\u00a01.1.14). In Central Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific, \naverage inflation rates reached around 9% in 2011 while it was \nmore moderate in East and Southeast Asia, where inflation \ncontinued to be contained at around 5%. Among the five \nsubregions, though still at a relatively higher level at 9.4%, South \nAsia was the only subregion that managed to avoid the hike last \nyear. This was due to India\u2019s sustained monetary tightening (at \na cost to economic growth) to combat persistent high inflation, \nwhich damped inflation from 9.6% in 2010 to 9% 2011 and \nmanaged to offset the climb in Maldives and Pakistan.\n\nIn Central Asia during 2011, average inflation increased \n\nfrom 7.0% in 2010 to 9.0%. Prices climbed faster in every \ncountry except Armenia, where monetary tightening and an \nimproved harvest restrained them. The increases were especially sharp in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, where spikes in food prices during \nthe first half of the year caused average inflation rates roughly to double. \nFor the Pacific, the rise in inflation in Papua New Guinea and Timor-\nLeste drove up the subregional average from 5.5% to 8.6% in 2011.\n\nFor East Asia as a whole, inflation was 5% in 2011, up from 3.1% in 2010. \n\nThe rebound of growth in East Asia in 2010, tying over into the early part \nof 2011, alongside rising food, oil, and other commodity prices, sparked \nthe inflation resurgence. Highly accommodative monetary policies and the \nresidue of fiscal stimulus were other factors. Likewise in Southeast Asia, \nhigher food and fuel prices drove up inflation to 5.5% from 4.1%. Average \ninflation exceeded 5% in half the 10 countries.\n\nInflation in developing Asia is set to recede as economic \nactivity softens. Assuming relatively steady global oil prices and \neasing food prices in 2012, regional average inflation is forecast \nto slow to 4.6%. Besides the external price developments, \ndomestic policies may play a role in, for example, South Asia, \nwhere some reduction in heavy fuel and power subsidies are \nexpected, and will set a floor for any reduction in inflation. For \n2013, further deceleration is expected in South Asia and the \nPacific, while other subregions are seen continuing flat, taking \nthe regional average down to 4.4% (Figure\u00a01.1.15).\n\nStill, policy makers cannot take this favorable trend in \ninflation for granted, and among the three main risks to the \noutlook, the risk of a spike in inflation looms.\n\n1.1.14  Inflation, developing Asia\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.1.15  Inflation by subregion\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n  Central Asia\n\n  East Asia\n\n  South Asia\n\n  The Pacific\n\n  Southeast \nAsia\n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    11\n\nRisks to the outlook\n\nCommodity price spikes\n\nDespite the nominal heights discussed above, commodity prices are well \nbelow their 1970s\u2019 real terms levels\u2014even the 2007\u20132008 price spike failed \nto take them back. Recent price volatility, though, as measured by the \nstandard deviation of price movements, is higher. Indeed, commodity \nprices are becoming more volatile and, as such, disruptive, heavily affecting \npoor households (too many subsidies are mistargeted or are slow to come \ninto play), as well as low-income countries that are heavy food and fuel \nimporters.\n\nCommodity price spikes by themselves will not produce \n\nsustained inflation, but they can hinder economic growth by raising \nmacroeconomic vulnerability, eroding producer profits, or hitting \nhousehold incomes. With non-OPEC oil supply providing little cushion \nto total supply (and the ever-present possibility of unplanned outages), \nthe relatively benign view of near-term oil price movements could switch \novernight if geopolitical tensions blow up. For food, market sentiment is \naffected not so much by low production prospects but more by \nuncertainty on the sufficiency of supply to meet ever-increasing \ndemand under extreme weather disturbances. \n\nNet \n\nFood price spikes as well are a key risk to the inflation \noutlook, given the weight of food in the region\u2019s consumer \nprice indexes. In addition to the knock-on effects of oil price \nmovements, natural disasters\u2014the frequency of which has \nmultiplied 10-fold between 1960 and 2010\u2014play havoc on food \nprice expectations. With greater uncertainty about the sufficiency \nof supply to meet ever-increasing demand under extreme weather \ndisturbances, market sentiments can shift abruptly.\n\nVolatile capital flows\n\nInvestor uncertainty over the advanced economies\u2019 recovery \nprospects intensified capital-flow volatility\u2014capital tends to \nflee the region when global risk aversion intensifies, and to \nreturn when it eases. Inflows to Asia rebounded strongly after \ntheir huge drop during the last global economic downturn \n(Figure\u00a01.1.16), but the movements are erratic.\n\nThe trend slowed in the first 3 quarters of 2010, then surged \n\nagain through the first half of 2011. This pickup was driven \nby huge increase in net inflows of currency and deposits \n(Figure\u00a01.1.17), as regional policy makers raised interest rates to \ndeal with inflationary pressures. But the worsening debt crisis \nin Europe and the downgrade by Standard and Poor\u2019s of US \nlong-term sovereign credit rating in the third quarter of 2011 \ncaused investor sentiment to swing. As investors became much \nmore risk averse, net capital inflows to the region plunged \n(though just stayed positive).\n\nTrends vary among the countries of developing Asia. \nFlows to the PRC\u2014with its high inflows of FDI\u2014tend to \ndominate regional figures.

Political instability in the Middle East \nclouded oil supply expectations, adding further volatility to \nprices.

According to the International \nEnergy Agency, Saudi Arabia\u2019s was only 1.9\u00a0million barrels per \nday (mb/d) in February 2012, against 11.9 mb/d of declared \ncapacity. More widely, OPEC\u2019s spare oil production capacity \ndeclined to an average of 2.8\u00a0mb/d in the first 2\u00a0months of \n2012 from an average of 4.5\u00a0million for the same period a \nyear earlier. \n\nIn mid-March, the agency lowered its full-year 2012 \nnon-OPEC production forecast from 0.9\u00a0mb/d to 0.73\u00a0mb/d. \nStrategic petroleum reserves have not been used to mitigate \nsupply constraints as countries such as France, Germany, \nand the US are trying to boost (or maintain) their reserves. \nMoreover, output of the petroleum substitute, ethanol, is on \nthe decline.\n\nDespite this, supply conditions are expected to improve in \n2012. Global oil supply is projected to rise by about 2 mb/d, \nmore from OPEC than non-OPEC countries. Saudi Arabia \nhas increased its production to counter the reduction from \nother countries, and its output is at a 30-year high, though \nthis comes at the expense of further squeezes on spare \ncapacity. Libyan output is rapidly recovering to prewar levels. \nOutput is also expected to rise in Angola, Iraq, and Nigeria, \nas tensions ease there. Many producing countries are adopting \nmodern technology to extract more oil from the fields. These \nchanges should counter shortages arising from Iran.\n\nSupply factors drive oil price volatility\n\nDemand factors dominate the oil price outlook\n\nSupply-side constraints are the primary factors behind \nthe recent upsurge in oil prices.

Some slowing indication in \nthe strength of the net capital inflows was also apparent for the \nPRC, particularly due to much slower inflows of portfolio and \nother investments (the more volatile part of capital inflows).\n\nGiven the likely prolonged period of loose monetary policy \n\nin the major industrial countries, an easing of global risk \naversion could cause another round of strong capital flows to \ndeveloping Asia.

Generally flat after the collapse in \n2008, prices surged in 2011 to average 24% more than a year \nearlier. Although slowing by year-end, the benchmark food \nprice index of the World Bank lingered at levels seen in the \n2008 peak, especially after the pickup in early 2012.\n\nGrain prices (including corn, rice, and wheat) led other \nfood prices. From the third quarter of 2011 corn and wheat \nprices retreated, reflecting improved supply from better \nweather. Rice prices, however, gained strength, mainly due \nto policy changes in Thailand, the world\u2019s top exporter. \nRice prices rose in July as Thai farmers withheld rice from \nthe export market following a \ngovernment pledge to pay farmers \nabove the market rate.

As \nagreement was reached on an orderly solution for Greece\u2019s \ndebt, the immediate risk of disorderly default appears to be \nreceding, and with it, the risk that the situation could morph \ninto full-fledged financial instability, in tandem with a global \nliquidity crisis.\n\nAlmost all member countries of the eurozone have adopted \n\nfiscal austerity measures, to secure fiscal sustainability in the \nbloc and to affirm their long-term commitment to the euro. \nThese measures, coupled with banks\u2019 moves to repair their \nbalance sheets, have changed the nature of the eurozone\u2019s \nproblems from immediate crisis and financial instability to \nprotracted, feeble growth.\n\nFor developing Asia, the nature of the primary risk has \nchanged as well, from financial contagion to slower export \ngrowth. The eurozone\u2014and the EU more broadly\u2014is an \nimportant trade partner for the region and a major source of \nits FDI and other capital inflows. As discussed throughout this \npart of Asian Development Outlook 2012, the on-off nature of \nthe euro crisis has been a factor in developing Asia\u2019s slower \ngrowth in 2011 and is clouding its near-term outlook.\n\nAlthough continued weakness in the eurozone has been \n\nfactored into the forecasts, what if the situation worsens? \nExamining the nature of developing Asia\u2019s finance and \ntrade links with the eurozone will help identify where the \nvulnerabilities lie.\n\nVulnerability to finance and trade shocks \nfrom the eurozone\n\nDeveloping Asia is in a good position to withstand another \nexternal shock.

Similarly, other than the two financial centers, \nexternal debt is low as a share of GDP (Figure 1.2.3). Further, \nthe ratios of both short-term external debt to reserves and of \nexternal debt to GDP have fallen in several countries from \ntheir precrisis levels in 2007.

High-level \nmeetings among European policy makers, and with their US \ncounterparts and IMF representatives, were all too frequent, \nbut the markets usually felt the outcomes were inadequate, \nas reflected in rising bond yield spreads (Box figure\u00a01). \nWhenever fears about a Greek default or a contagion to \nSpain or Italy intensified, European policy makers were \nforced to embrace increasingly bold measures.\n\nBy the beginning of 2012, Greek government debt had \nbeen restructured successfully and the European banking \nsystem granted enough liquidity to weather additional market \nturmoil and to satisfy the refinancing needs of the large and \nvulnerable Spanish and Italian economies.\n\nIn addition, the European Financial Stability Facility \n(EFSF) has been strengthened, and fiscal austerity measures \nare to be implemented to help guarantee the euro\u2019s long-term \nsustainability.

As has already occurred to some extent, eurozone \nbanks would further cut bank lending abroad to repair balance sheets \nback home. This could affect developing Asia because eurozone is \nan important source of its foreign bank loans: its borrowings from \neurozone banks amounted to around $440 billion in September 2011,\nequivalent to 14% of the region\u2019s total foreign bank financing, though the \nimpact would also depend on how much an economy relies on external \nborrowing (Table\u00a01.2.1).\n\nEast Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia get about 12\u201317% of their \ntotal foreign bank borrowings from eurozone banks, Central Asia and the \nPacific around 50%. Just five economies\u2014the PRC; Hong Kong, China; \n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    17\n\n1.2.1  (continued) \n\nby the permanent European Stability Mechanism (ESM), \nwhich will have \u20ac700\u00a0billion in its armory.\n\nAlthough it was already apparent in the first half of \n2011 that Greece would need further funding and, possibly, \ndebt relief, restructuring only saw the light of day in 2012. \nGermany and other northern European countries were \nseeking active private involvement while other countries \ndemanded more support through the EFSF.\n\nIn March 2012, voluntary private sector participation in \nthe restructuring of Greek government debt reached 95.7%. \nThus about \u20ac197\u00a0billion of government debt held by private \ninvestors was exchanged into new bonds, reducing the net \npresent value of its debt by \u20ac107\u00a0billion through reduced \ninterest costs and deferred maturities.\n\nSoon after the agreement with private debt holders was \nsecured, the European Union approved the second bailout \npackage for Greece, amounting to \u20ac109\u00a0billion from the \nEFSF. The IMF subsequently approved new support to Greece \nof \u20ac28 billion in March 2012 through its Extended Fund \nFacility, a mechanism designed for countries undertaking \nreforms to address deep-seated structural weaknesses, and \ndisbursed \u20ac1.65\u00a0billion ($2.2\u00a0billion).\n\nIn light of the losses imposed on private bondholders, \n\nit will take time for Greece to regain access to bond \nmarkets. Until then, the country will depend on IMF/\nEU loans. As Greece has fallen into a deep recession \nwith high unemployment and few signs of improving \nits competitiveness, relationships with other European \ncountries\u2014who envisage pushing down Greek debt from \n164% of GDP in 2011 to 120.5% by 2020\u2014will likely remain \ntense.\n\nOver the year, pressure also built on Portugal, Spain, \nand Italy, but while news in March 2012 from Italy seems \nencouraging, that from Spain and Portugal appears more \ntroublesome.\n\nPlagued by stubbornly high budget deficits, Spain may \n\nexperience increasing pressure from its eurozone partners to \npursue stronger fiscal consolidation efforts. With the country \nalready in recession, social and economic pressure will \ncontinue to build, making further consolidation politically \ndifficult.\n\nPortugal has been in a difficult economic situation for a \nlong time. In April 2011, it lost access to financial markets \nand has received funding from the EFSF and the IMF since \nthen. Portuguese government debt has been downgraded to \njunk status, as investors have become increasingly skeptical of \nthe government\u2019s ability to rein in its fiscal deficits.\n\nAlthough the EFSF and ESM have received much \n\nattention in public discussion, the major player in this crisis \nhas been the European Central Bank (ECB). As leveraging \nthe EFSF has turned out to be difficult and direct debt \npurchases by the ECB were politically very controversial, the \nECB moved toward its own version of quantitative easing to \nmitigate pressures in European sovereign debt markets and \ndifficulties in the continent\u2019s banking sector.\n\nIn its two, 3-year, long-term refinancing operations \n\n(LTROs), the ECB pumped about \u20ac1 trillion into the banking \nsystem, which narrowed interest-rate spreads on eurozone \nsovereign debt. While LTROs have always been part of the \nECB\u2019s monetary policy tool kit, repo auctions normally \nplay the dominant role. The two LTROs in December 2011 \nand February 2012 differ from earlier ones in their time \nperiod (3\u00a0years instead of 3\u00a0months) and the conduct of the \nbidding, as the ECB decided to fix the interest rate and leave \nthe volume of the operation adjust to the liquidity demand. \nThey have been successful\u2014the credit default swap rates \non European sovereign debts fell steeply after they were \nannounced.\n\nAfter going through many phases, no one is arguing \nthe problems have been solved: a fundamental long-term \nsolution to the euro crisis will require yet stronger political \ncommitment from all member countries.\n\nRepublic of Korea; India, and Singapore\u2014account for about three-fourths \nof developing Asia\u2019s total borrowing from eurozone banks.\n\nA better measure of vulnerability is the ratio of external bank \nborrowing to domestic credit because this gives an indication of the \nimportance of outside financing in domestic financial intermediation. \nBorrowings from eurozone banks are equivalent to 4\u20138% of domestic \ncredit in India; Indonesia; Republic of Korea; Taipei,China; the \nPhilippines; and Viet Nam. The shares in Asia\u2019s two major financial \ncenters\u2014Hong Kong, China and Singapore\u2014are much higher.\n\nYet despite the likely financial impact, as in the 2008\u20132009 crisis, the \n\nmain channel of impact will be trade\u2014financial linkages between the \neurozone and the region are indeed substantial, but pale in comparison \nto the extensive trade linkages.1 The eurozone is a major market for \nthe region\u2019s exports, accounting for 12.0% of the total\u2014about the same \n\n\f18    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n1.2.1  Developing Asia\u2019s borrowings from eurozone banks, September 2011\n\nRegion/Economy\n\nAmount ($ billion)\n\nShare by each region/\neconomy (%)\n\nShare of borrowings from eurozone \nin total foreign bank borrowings\n\nBorrowings from eurozone banks \nas share of domestic credit\n\nCentral Asia\nEast Asia\nPeople\u2019s Rep. of China\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nTaipei,China\nSouth Asia\nIndia\nSoutheast Asia\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\nThe Pacific\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n13.3\n228.9\n96.4\n63.8\n44.0\n24.7\n60.4\n57.5\n114.8\n18.8\n10.2\n8.2\n63.6\n7.1\n6.4\n23.5\n\n440.9\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n3.0\n51.9\n21.9\n14.5\n10.0\n5.6\n13.7\n13.0\n26.0\n4.3\n2.3\n1.9\n14.4\n1.6\n1.5\n5.3\n\n100.0\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n49.2\n12.4\n14.1\n9.8\n13.0\n14.2\n17.2\n17.9\n14.3\n16.2\n7.0\n20.7\n16.9\n7.5\n26.2\n49.8\n\n14.3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n-\n-\n0.9\n12.4\n4.1\n4.1\n-\n4.4\n-\n6.6\n3.0\n7.7\n27.4\n1.5\n4.6\n-\n\n2.9\n\n- = data not available.\nNote: Data cover nine eurozone countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) with individual country data on \ndeveloping Asia.

During the global downturn, the \nsynchronized recession of the advanced economies had a \npronounced effect on developing Asia\u2019s exports (Figure 1.2.6), \npulling back growth (Figure 1.2.7).\n\nYes, the region is shifting its exports from the major \nindustrial economies: since 2005, developing Asia\u2019s exports to \nthe eurozone and US have declined from about 30% of the total \nto about 24% in 2011 (up to September). And it is strengthening \ntrade ties with Latin America and Africa\u2014but even combined \nthey still only account for 7.1% of total exports. The contribution \nof regional demand to export growth, too, has increased, with \nintraregional trade rising from 39.5% to 42.1% between 2005 and \n2011, but a good portion of this is still a reflection of the cross-\nborder production networks rather than final goods. So while \nthere has been a shift toward greater diversification in export \ndestinations, the eurozone is still large enough to do damage to \ndeveloping Asia.\n\nThe ratio of exports to the eurozone to GDP is another \n\nmarker of developing Asia\u2019s exposure to a recession in \nthe eurozone. The ratio varies greatly across subregions \n(Figure 1.2.8). Exposure is higher for East and Southeast \nAsia than it is for the other subregions, reflecting those two \nsubregions\u2019 role as major exporters of manufactured goods. \nExport exposure to the eurozone (and the US) declined in 2005\u2013\n2010, pointing to its diminishing vulnerability to a eurozone \nslowdown.\n\nThe industrial composition of exports is another important \n\nfactor. For example, the exports of East and Southeast Asia, \nAsia\u2019s traditional manufacturing hubs, are heavily skewed \n\n%\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n%\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\nQ3 \n\nQ1\n2007\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ3 \n\nQ3 \n\nQ3 \n\nQ3 \n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nSource: ADB calculations based on International Monetary Fund, Direction of \nTrade Statistics online database (accessed 15\u00a0March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.2.7  GDP growth, selected developing Asian economies\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nSingapore\n\nHong Kong, China\nTaipei,China\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2007\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\ftoward manufactured goods (97% and 82%, respectively) and \nhence more vulnerable to a eurozone recession (Figure\u00a01.2.9). \nDuring the global crisis, highly open exporters of manufactured \ngoods\u2014such as the four newly industrialized economies, as well \nas Malaysia and Thailand\u2014were hit harder than other groups of \ncountries. \n\nThe above data show that the eurozone is a key export \nmarket for Asia, and will remain so for the near future despite \nits declining share in recent years. But they also suggest that, \nas long as the slowdown is confined to the eurozone\u2014and does \nnot become a synchronized advanced-country recession\u2014\ndeveloping Asia should be able to absorb the impact of lower \nexport demand.\n\nThe risk, though, is that the current armistice in the \n\neurozone sovereign debt crisis may be short-lived. If the shock \nto the eurozone periphery were to spread more broadly through \nfinancial markets there and push the eurozone further into \nrecession, the global impacts would be much larger than the \nAsian Development Outlook\u2019s global baseline assumptions. And \nif matters in the eurozone worsen to the extent of undermining \nglobal recovery, developing Asia\u2019s policy makers will need to \nbe ready to act quickly. Recent history shows that two areas in \nparticular\u2014global value chains and trade finance\u2014interact with \nan external trade shock to intensify its impact.\n\nFactors intensifying external shocks\n\nGlobal value chains\n\nThe integration of emerging East and Southeast Asian economies \nand Japan in global value chains (GVCs)\u2014the division of production \nprocesses among multiple firms and countries\u2014helps explain the region\u2019s \nvulnerability to external demand shocks (Box\u00a01.2.2).2 Under this type \nof production framework, which predominate the global manufacture \nof durable goods such as electronics and automobiles, the volume of \nexports is magnified as components move multiple times across national \nboundaries before becoming final goods.\n\nBecause the import content of durable goods is larger than \n\nfor nondurable goods and services, the rise of GVCs gives \ndurable goods greater weight as a share of trade than their \nweight in GDP. One estimate shows that durable goods before \nthe 2008\u20132009 global crisis had grown to almost 40% of trade, \nbut amounted to only 10% of final demand.3 Since consumers \ntend to first cutback purchases of durables in a recession, the \ntransmission of demand shocks along GVCs can induce a \ndisproportionate drop in trade relative to GDP.\n\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    19\n\n1.2.8  Export exposure to the eurozone (% of GDP), \ndeveloping Asia\n\nIndirect\n\nDirect\n\n2005\n\n10\nCentral Asia\n\n2005\n10\nEast Asia\n\n10\n2005\nSouth Asia\n\n10\n2005\nSoutheast \nAsia\n\n2005\n10\nThe Pacific\n\n10\n\n2005\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nNotes: 1.

Currently, \ntrade in intermediate inputs accounts for roughly two-\nthirds of international trade. GVCs have expanded \nasymmetrically across industries, predominantly emerging \nin durable goods such as electronics and automobiles.\n\nEast and Southeast Asian economies (including Japan) \n\nhave taken on a key role in the GVCs of durable goods, \neffectively turning the region into the \u201cfactory of the \nworld.\u201d From 2000 to 2007, their share in world durable \ngoods exports grew from 35% to 42%. The exports of the \neconomies along GVCs are more heavily concentrated in \ndurable goods than those of the rest of the world (Box \nfigure 1). This is largely due to these economies\u2019 key role \nin the electronics GVCs: electronics constituted more than \nhalf durable goods exports in 2007 for the region (except \nfor Viet\u00a0Nam, Indonesia, and Japan).\n\n1 Share of durable goods and electronics \nproducts in total exports, selected Asian \neconomies, 2007\n\nOther durables\n\nElectronics\n\n%\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nPHI\n\nTAP\n\nMAL\n\nSIN\n\nTHA\n\nINO\n\nJPN\n\nKOR\n\nPRC\n\nHKG\n\nWorld\n\nVIE\n\nHKG\u00a0=\u00a0Hong Kong, China; INO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia; JPN\u00a0=\u00a0Japan; \nKOR\u00a0=\u00a0Rep. of Korea; MAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia; PHI\u00a0=\u00a0Philippines; \nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Rep. of China; SIN\u00a0=\u00a0Singapore; \nTAP\u00a0=\u00a0Taipei,China; THA\u00a0=\u00a0Thailand; VIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet Nam.\nSource: Ma and Van Assche (2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nWhile durable goods trade has clustered in East and \n\nSoutheast Asia, the final consumption of such goods \nremains concentrated in North America and Europe. In \n2007, 61% of their intermediate durables were traded \nwithin the East and Southeast Asian GVCs, but 55% of its \nexports of final durable goods went to non-Asian OECD \ncountries.\n\nEconomies play different roles in GVCs depending on \n\ntheir level of economic development. Box figure 2 plots \ncountries according to their position in GVCs and their \nlevel of development. Upstream stages such as design, \nR&D and production of sophisticated components \nare generally located in developed countries, while \nmanufacturing and especially final assembly activities are \nrelocated to developing countries. Finally, the downstream \nactivities marketing and consumption once again take \nplace in developed countries.\n\nJapan thus specializes in the upstream production \nand exports of sophisticated intermediate goods such as \nsemiconductors.\n\nThe high-income newly industrialized economies \neconomies (Hong Kong China; the Republic of Korea; \nSingapore; and Taipei,China) as well as Malaysia and the \nPhilippines are located in the middle of the chain where \nthey specialize in processing intermediate goods. While \nthey disproportionately import intermediate durables, \nintermediate goods also make up a larger-than-average \nshare of their durable goods exports.\n\nThe middle-income countries\u2014the PRC and Thailand\u2014\n\nspecialize in the downstream assembly of final durable \ngoods. They disproportionately import intermediate \ndurables, and specialize in the export of final durable \ngoods.\n\nFinally, the high-income Western economies\u2014mainly \nUS and EU\u2014serve as dominant markets for final goods, \nintensively importing durable goods.\n\nThe transmission of external shocks is further amplified \n\nfirms, but an estimated 40% is intermediated by banks. The availability \nof such financing is critical for the region, given the important role that \ntrade plays for many developing Asian economies. While the 2008\u20132009 \ntrade collapse coincided with a tightening of global credit conditions, the \nextent that shrinking trade finance contributed to the fall in trade is not \nclear, in part because of incomplete data.\n\nThis is because most trade finance transactions are not reported. \nInterfirm transactions (involving open accounts and cash-in-advance \ntrade finance, for example) are largely undisclosed, and the bank-\nintermediated portion of trade credits is notably an area of finance \nthat mainly involves relationship banking and does not take place in \norganized markets.\n\n\f2 Stylized structure of GVCs in durable goods\n\n1.2.2  (continued)\n\nGDP \nper capita\n\nJapan\n\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\n\nHong Kong, China\nSingapore\nTaipei,China\nRep. of Korea \n\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nPRC\nThailand\n\nMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    21\n\nThe demand shock further \n\namplifies as it moves up \nthe GVC due to inventory \nadjustments. The logic for \nsuch a \u201cbullwhip effect\u201d is \nthat businesses typically face \nforecast errors in their sales \nagainst which they try to shelter \nby building safety stocks of \ninventories. When a downstream \nfirm is confronted with a drop \nin demand for its final products, \nits first reaction is then to run \ndown its inventories, therefore \nmore than proportionally \nreducing its orders of upstream \ncomponents. \n\nAs this inventory adjustment \n\nSource: Ma and Van Assche (2012).\n\nComponent \nproduction\n\nComponent \nprocessing\n\nFinal \nassembly\n\nby the strongly synchronized, just-in-time nature of \nintermediate goods trade and the adjustment of inventories \nalong supply chains. To see this, consider Box figure 2 and \nsuppose that there is a sudden decline EU demand for \nfinal durable goods. This decreases the demand for imports \nfrom the final assembly platforms PRC and Thailand. \n\nIn turn, since these final assembly platforms heavily \nrely on imported components, they react to the negative \ndemand shock by importing fewer components from \ncountries like Malaysia or the Philippines. The latter react \nto the shock by importing fewer inputs from the next \nupstream stage, Japan. As a result, the negative demand \nshock leads to a sudden, synchronized regional trade \ndecline.\n\nConsumption\n\nValue chain stage\n\nprocess propagates upstream, \nthe demand shock continues \nto amplify. East and Southeast \nAsia\u2019s heavy involvement in \nGVCs helps explain why some \nof its economies saw their trade \ndrop up to 40% (year on year) in the trough of the global \ndownturn in first quarter of 2009.\n\nLessons can thus be drawn for the region\u2019s vulnerability \n\nto global demand shocks, such a deepening recession \namong European countries. Although Asia\u2019s reliance on \nEU demand for its exports has declined in recent years, a \nEuropean recession can yet again amplify along the GVCs, \nleading to a slowdown in regional trade. Such a demand \nshock would be further intensified if accompanied by a \ncontraction in credit markets or spikes in protectionism.\n\nSource: A. Ma and A.

ADB Economics Working Paper \nSeries.\n\nInformation about trade finance and the impact of global financial \n\nand economic developments comes primarily from surveys of \ncommercial banks. The International Monetary Fund, for instance, has \ncollaborated with the Bankers\u2019 Association for Finance and Trade and the \nInternational Chamber of Commerce to conduct surveys during 2008\u2013\n2010, interviewing banks in supplier and buyer countries.\n\nIt found that data reported from banks generally show that the \n\ndecline in trade finance during the crisis was not as severe as the \ndecline in trade volumes. However, bank data may understate the \nimpact of the crisis on trade finance for two reasons. Monetary stimulus \nand programs from international financial institutions targeting trade \nfinance would have softened the blow. Moreover, bank surveys cannot \n\n\f22    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nshow the impact on interfirm trade finance transactions since they do \nnot cover this segment.\n\nOther data on the importance of trade finance come from surveys of \n\nbusinesses, such as two World Bank surveys, also carried out in 2008\u2013\n2010, in 14 developing countries (two in Asia). The surveys focused on \nfirms\u2019 perceptions.\n\nFirm perception survey results, in contrast to bank survey results, \n\ndo suggest some important connections. Those interviewed felt that \nthe driving factor behind lower trade levels was the drop in demand \nduring the 2008\u20132009 global recession rather than an inability to secure \nfinancing. But there was an important shift from inter-firm transactions \nto bank intermediated trade finance as firms tried to shift counter-party \nrisk during that period of heightened uncertainty. Banks themselves \nadopted stricter risk management and greater client differentiation, \nraising both collateral requirements and margins. Those firms that were \nable to get bank financing faced higher pricing margins. This hampered \ntrade by raising transaction costs.\n\nThe effect of this squeeze was most pronounced in developing \ncountries. The World Bank surveys found that developing countries\u2019 \nfirms did suffer from constrained trade finance. Firms relying chiefly \non inter-firm or self-financed trade credit were most strongly affected \nby the global drop in trade, the compression of export revenues, the \ncancellation of orders, as well as payment delays. Firms relying mainly \non the banking sector for trade credit were affected by banks\u2019 risk \naversion and discrimination. For example, in the Philippines, firms \nstill felt as late of April 2010\u2014when the second of the two surveys was \nconducted\u2014that eligibility criteria imposed by banks continued to be \noverly stringent.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises were affected more strongly \nthan large ones by the strains to trade finance. These firms faced larger \nincreases in the price of trade finance, due to their weaker capital base to \nstem against revenues compression, and their disadvantage in bargaining \nwith the larger corporations and banks in the global markets.\n\nLooking ahead, there are several factors that may tighten trade finance \n\nconditions in developing Asia. First is the ongoing bank deleveraging \nin advanced economies. The sharpening of the eurozone crisis in 2011 \nadded pressure on banks to increase their capital, reducing capacity in \nthe market. Consequently, many European banks, traditionally active in \nsupporting trade in Asia, have retrenched, leaving a larger gap for trade \nfinance. The potential impact of reduced lending by eurozone banks is \nsignificant, since they are estimated to provide about 30% of total trade \nfinance in the region.\n\nSecond, the Basel III accord\u2014as important as it is to help place \nthe global financial system on a more sound footing\u2014has unintended \nconsequences. By treating the cost of capital the same for a high-risk \nhigh-margin activity, compared with a relatively low-risk lower-margin \nactivity such as trade finance, Basel III encourages financial institutions \ntoward higher return (and higher risk) lending away from trade finance. \nThis is despite the strong evidence showing that trade finance carries \na relatively low probability of default and loss because it is highly \ncollateralized.\n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    23\n\nFinally, for developing economies, trade finance is not just about \n\naccess to credit, but rather access to international liquidity. Advanced \neconomies can use expansionary monetary policy to provide liquidity to \nmarkets in currencies accepted in international transactions. The analogy \nfor developing Asian economies would be to draw down foreign reserves \nwith central banks supplying dollars to local banks through repurchasing \nagreements, but this could put the exchange rate at risk.\n\nThe confluence of these factors may squeeze trade finance \n\navailability\u2014especially if the situation in the eurozone were to worsen. \nPolicy makers need to closely monitor trade finance availability, especially \nfor small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nThey need to be ready to act\u2014on a wider field than trade finance\u2014\n\nand have the capacity to do so.\n\n\f24    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nMacro-policy directions for \ndeveloping Asia\n\nEnough policy space for a major external shock\nResponding to the global economic downturn in 2008\u20132009, countries \nin developing Asia adopted policy stimulus measures, which though \neffective, absorbed some of the region\u2019s monetary and fiscal policy space \n(Box\u00a01.3.1) that was earned through earlier prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement. Many countries reduced their benchmark policy interest \nrates to record lows and saw their ratio of public debt to GDP spike as \nthey expanded government spending substantially.\n\n1.3.1  What is policy space?\n\nPolicy space refers to the scope for using fiscal and monetary policy to counter \nthe effects of shocks to the economic environment. For example, relatively low \npublic debt to GDP ratios allow governments to increase spending and cut \ntaxes without triggering adverse reactions from financial markets about fiscal \nsustainability.\n\nLikewise, a history of anti-inflationary policies builds credibility and \nexpands the scope for interest rate cuts. Further, the presence of a clearly \ndefined lender of last resort strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy \nduring a crisis.\n\nAs countries started to unwind the stimulus measures in 2010, they \n\nbegan to claw back some of this hard-earned policy space. But, given \nthe global outlook, can developing Asia pursue another round of such \nmeasures if the downside risks materialize?\n\nIn an attempt to answer this question, it is useful to look \nin more detail at the earlier measures. Since the crisis eased, \nregional central banks have tightened their monetary policy \nstance to stem rising inflationary pressures, most of them due \nto food price increases. Benchmark policy rates in the region \nrose in the 2\u00a0years to around mid-2011 (Figure 1.3.1), as the crisis \nin the eurozone slowed global economic activity and inflation \npressures moderated in developing Asia. Unlike the advanced \neconomies (with near zero rates), developing Asia now has \nroom to cut rates, although benchmark rates in most economies \nare still lower than before the downturn, suggesting less room \nto tighten.\n\nRegional inflation\u2014reflecting normalizing monetary policy \n\nand stabilizing global commodity prices\u2014has come down \nsince the last quarter of 2011 (Figure\u00a01.3.2). As discussed much \nearlier, the risk of such prices, especially for oil, picking up \nagain remains high, however, making possible a reversal of the recent \ndownward trend in headline inflation in developing Asia.\n\n1.3.1 Benchmark policy rates, selected Asian economies\nIndia\nMalaysia\n\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nFeb\n12\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    25\n\n1.3.2  Inflation, selected Asian economies\n\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nIndia\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\n\n%\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nQ4\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.3.3  Fiscal balances, selected Asian economies\n2010\n\n2008\u22122009\n\n2011\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n%\n\n5\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\nThe region\u2019s monetary authorities have maintained enough \nforeign exchange reserves to overcome shortages of international \nliquidity if a major financial shock hits. This is costly as reserves \nare typically invested in low-interest assets at the same time \nas governments pay higher rates on their outstanding debt, \nbut uncertainties in Europe and the lack of global financial \nsafety nets have prompted most Asian economies to follow this \npractice, which also allows for exchange rate management.\n\nCommon management of pooled reserves under a regional \n\ncoordination mechanism would be the best way to use these \nreserves in combating international liquidity shortages. Thus \nstrengthening the Chiang Mai Initiative Multeralization \n(CMIM) mechanism as a regional platform\u2014with support from \nthe newly established AMRO for ASEAN+3 for harnessing \nregional macro and exchange rate policy coordination\u2014could \noffer substantial returns (Box\u00a01.3.2).\n\nDeveloping Asia also has enough fiscal space for short-term stimulus \n\nif it is hit by a shock. Although fiscal deficits are still fairly high in, \nfor example, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan, fiscal balances of many \nregional countries remain healthy as they are not likely to \nlead to increases in public debt to GDP ratios. In the PRC, \nIndia, the Republic of Korea, Philippines and Viet Nam, fiscal \npositions have also improved in 2011 from the previous 3\u00a0years \nas the stimulus put through during the global crisis was \nunwound (Figure\u00a01.3.3).

CMIM, which took effect in March 2010, \nis a US$120 billion multilateral currency swap facility \ndesigned to address short-term liquidity difficulties in the \nregion and supplement international financial arrangements.\nAs a reserve pooling arrangement, CMIM members \ncommitted their contribution to the facility but continue \nto manage their own reserves. Each member is eligible to \n\naccess the facility up to a certain approved multiple of its \ncontribution. When a member\u2019s request for a swap facility \nis approved, each of the contributing members extends its \ncontribution prorated to its commitment.\n\nTo support CMIM operations, the ASEAN+3 \n\nMacroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established \nin April 2011 to act as the regional surveillance unit of \nCMIM. AMRO monitors and analyzes regional economies. \nIt also contributes to early detection of risks and swift \nimplementation of remedial actions to ensure for an \neffective decision-making of the CMIM.\n\n\f26    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n1.3.3  Public debt in developing Asia after the global crisis\n\nFiscal intervention by governments in developing Asia \nto stem the 2008\u20132009 crisis raised regional public debt \nratios by an average of 5% in 2009, thus breaking a trend \nof fiscal consolidation that most countries had followed \nsince the late 1990s\u2019 Asian financial crisis. The 2009 spike \nin debt ratios was highest in Central and East Asia. All \nratios resumed their downward trend in 2010 and 2011, \nas fiscal stimulus measures gradually faded and economic \ngrowth in the region returned.\n\nThe outlook on debt dynamics for the region is \ngenerally benign, and most public debt ratios are \nprojected to decline in the medium term. This is shown \nin Box figure\u00a01, which shows debt ratios averaged by \nsubregion over a historical period (2000\u20132010) and \nprojected period (2011\u20132016), as well as for seven major \nAsian economies. \n\nApart from the baseline projection\u2014the lines in \nred\u2014also shown is a historical scenario\u2014the dashed \nlines in blue\u2014that projects debt ratios with key \nvariables kept at their 2000\u20132010 historical averages. A \ncomparison between the two scenarios suggests that the \nmacroeconomic and fiscal assumptions underlying the \nbaseline are not overly optimistic when compared with \n\nhistorical track records.1\n\nFavorable debt dynamics in the region in 2011\u20132016 \n\nare premised mainly on the assumption that low real \ninterest rates and high growth rates will prevail, against \nthe backdrop of a progressive strengthening of fiscal \nbalances. In line with the historical pattern observed in \nlarge parts of the region during the past 2\u00a0decades or so, \nhigher economic than interest-rate growth is expected \nto continue eroding debt ratios faster than they will \nrise because of primary deficits or other factors, such as \nexchange rate movements increasing the value of foreign \ncurrency\u2013denominated public debt.\n\nFor example, in relation to the aggregate for the seven \n\neconomies, Box figure 2 shows that strong economic \ngrowth of around 6% a year is expected to cause the debt \nratio to shrink by roughly 2% each year between 2011 \nand 2016, which will more than outweigh the increase \nin debt due to the combined impact of narrowing \nprimary deficits, a positive real interest rate, and slightly \nunfavorable exchange rate movements. As a result, the \naverage debt ratio of the seven economies is expected to \nfall to about 34% in 2016, from nearly 40% in 2011.\nPremised on these assumptions, standard debt-\n\n1 Public debt projections for developing Asia\n\nHistorical\n\nBaseline\n\nCentral Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\n% of GDP\n80\n\n% of GDP\n80\n\n% of GDP\n\n2000\n\n \n\n \n\n03\n\n \n\n \n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n09\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n2000\n\n \n\n \n\n03\n\n \n\n \n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n09\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n2000\n\n \n\n \n\n03\n\n \n\n \n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n09\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nThe Pacific\n\nSeven Asian economies\n\n% of GDP\n80\n\n% of GDP\n80\n\n% of GDP\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n \n\n \n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n03\n\n \n\n \n\n09\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \nNote: The seven Asian economies are the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.\nSource: Ferrarini and Ramayandi (2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2000\n\n03 \n\n06\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2000\n\n \n\n09\n\n06\n\n03\n\n15\n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n09\n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    27\n\n1.3.3  (continued)\n\n2 Contributions to change in public debt\nInterest rate \nPrimary deficit  \nExchange rate \nGrowth rate \n\n% \n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\nDebt stock \n\n% of GDP\n\n42\n\n40\n\n38\n\n36\n\n34\n\n32\n\n2012\nSource: Ferrarini and Ramayandi (forthcoming).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nsustainability analysis finds public debt in the region \nto be broadly sustainable, in that expected future \nmacroeconomic and fiscal performances are likely to \nenable governments to smoothly finance their budgets \nand service debt without generating explosive increases \nin public debt ratios. Moreover, falling debt ratios are \nassociated with a gradual expansion of the fiscal policy \nspace that was temporarily compressed by the global \ncrisis. To some extent, this would enable governments in \nthe region to intervene again, if necessary.\n\nBy contrast, fiscal space\u2014and with it the feasibility \n\nof heavy government intervention\u2014would quickly \nshrink in the event of a particularly severe or \nprolonged deterioration in the region\u2019s macroeconomic \nenvironment. An example is another major global crisis, \nsuch as triggered by an international financial crisis that \nwould spike interest rates, dry up international capital \nmarkets, and derail economic growth in the region.\n\nPut differently, in terms of Box figure 2, any large \ninternal or external shock that would largely invalidate \nthe key assumption as regards the continuing presence \nof a higher than interest rate growth favoring debt \ndynamics in the region would inevitably complicate debt \nmanagement and, if sufficiently severe, could jeopardize \ndebt sustainability in many countries of the region.\n\nRisks to public debt sustainability also arise out of the \n\nintrinsic vulnerabilities to macroeconomic stability, in \nsome countries particularly. Stochastic debt-sustainability \nanalyses2 discussed in Ferrarini, Jha, and Ramayandi \n(forthcoming) show that, when the frequency and entity \nof historical shocks as well as co-movements of the \nvariables affecting the debt ratio are fully accounted \nfor, debt projections for the more vulnerable Asian \neconomies display a broad range of likely outcomes, some \nof which have the potential to undermine public debt \nsustainability. \n\nFurthermore, the study emphasizes the issue of \nlocal as opposed to central government debt, as well as \ncontingent liabilities, the full extent of which typically \neludes standard debt-sustainability analysis. Finally, \nthe medium-term focus of this analysis abstracts from \nstructural factors that are likely to introduce a significant \nupward pressure on the regions\u2019 fiscal budgets and debt \nratios in the longer term. For example, health care, \npension spending, and social safety nets are likely to \nexpand. The related fiscal outlays will add significant \npressure on general government budgets across the \nregion, shifting debt ratios upward.\n\nIn sum, assessing public debt sustainability in Asia \nand the Pacific involves more rigorous analysis that goes \nbeyond simple debt-sustainability analysis projections. \nNevertheless, even a more attentive analysis of the debt \nand risk profiles for selected countries in the region \nsuggests that, by and large, public debt in these countries \nis sustainable and governments do have a degree of policy \nspace to count on for the case that fiscal intervention to \nsupport their economies should be required.\n\n1 With the main exception of East Asia (including the PRC, the \nRepublic of Korea, and Mongolia), where the historical scenario is \naffected by a debt crisis in Mongolia, which saw the country\u2019s debt \nratio spike to about 100% in the early 2000s before falling steeply in \nthe rest of the decade.\n2 VAR-based Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nReference\nB.

Abingdon, UK: Routledge.\n\n\f28    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nimprovement in investor sentiment could soon be followed by \nanother stream of volatile capital inflows to the region, which \nwas one of the factors behind the rise in inflation during the \nrecovery, as it flooded the region with additional liquidity.\n\nWhile the slowdown in Europe is putting a brake on \neconomic growth in Asian economies, the extent seems to be \nmanageable. Except for Thailand, which is still recovering after \nthe floods late last year, actual output levels in the region do \nnot appear to be substantially below trend (Figure\u00a01.3.4). This \nsuggests that the region\u2019s economies are still operating around \ntheir potential output levels and are expected to continue doing \nso in the medium run\u2014unlike the major industrial economies \n(Figure\u00a01.3.5).\n\nAlthough there is no clear case for developing Asia to deploy \n\naggressive countercyclical policy, there may still be a need for \npolicy intervention. The region accounts for a large and growing \nshare of the world\u2019s economic activity, thus such intervention \nmay help to ensure the continuation of strong domestic \ndemand, which in turn will also contribute positively to the \nglobal economic recovery.\n\nThe role of monetary policy for maintaining the growth \nmomentum seems to be more limited than that of fiscal policy. \nThe overall stance of monetary policy in the region is still fairly \naccommodative. Real interest rates are still very low\u2014slightly \nbelow zero in most cases or even highly negative (Viet Nam) \n(Figure 1.3.6). The slowdown in food price inflation has helped \ncool the headline rate, but core inflation has not slowed as \nmuch, suggesting that price pressures remain. Finally, credit \nin the region, although moderating slightly, continues to grow \nstrongly, at a two-digit rate in most cases.\n\nLooking to the longer term\nThe smaller GDP gaps, relatively low real interest rates and high \ncredit expansion, as well as persistent core inflation in Asia \nsuggest that pressures for inflation originating from aggregate \ndemand are still persistent. Recent improvement in the investor \nsentiment also entails the potential for another stream of capital \ninflows to the region, which in turn adds pressure for aggregate \ndemand to increase. In tandem with the risk of elevating price \nof oil in the international markets, and the absence of further \nshock to the global environment, there may be resumption for \ninflationary pressures to the region.\n\nIf inflationary pressures build again and capital inflows \nresume, there may be a need to readjust monetary policy to \nmaintain price stability. But until that happens (if indeed it \ndoes), the region\u2019s monetary authorities should fine tune their \npolicy stance while keeping focused on stabilizing inflation \nexpectations.\n\nTo shield against the highly volatile nature of capital flows, Asia \nneeds to be ready with measures to fend off large and rapid fluctuations \n\n1.3.4  Output gap, selected Asian economies\n\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nIndia\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.3.5  Output gap, major industrial economies\nUnited States\nEurozone\n\nJapan\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: OECD Economic Outlook November 2011.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1.3.6  Real interest rates, selected Asian economies\n\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nIndia\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\nViet Nam\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nQ4\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n%\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n%\n\n7\n\n0\n\n-7\n\n-14\n\n\fMaintaining growth in an uncertain world    29\n\nin cross-border capital movements. Strengthening domestic financial \nsystems by improving their supervision and regulatory rules should help \nenhance domestic financial stability. More flexible exchange rate regimes \nare also useful for filtering speculative short-term capital inflows. If \nlarge swings of capital flows to the region reoccur, various measures of \ncapital flow management can also be deployed, but they require regional \ncoordination to be effective.\n\nGiven the limited room for monetary policy maneuver, authorities can \n\nalso use fiscal policy. They can compensate for the slowdown in external \ndemand by boosting domestic demand to keep the growth momentum, \nbut have to do this without undermining their fiscal position. So although \ndebt-to-GDP ratios in the region have now generally resumed their \ndownward path, governments have no room for complacency. Sustaining \nthese improving debt ratios depends on continued favorable growth and \ninterest rates, which\u2014as seen repeatedly over the years\u2014can suddenly \nreverse. Moreover, the region faces further sources of fiscal strain in the \nyears ahead, such as adjusting to aging populations and building adequate \nsocial safety nets.\n\nFiscal policy should thus strike a balance between the pursuit of \nlong-term fiscal stability and support to growth. Fiscal authorities can do \nthis with budget-neutral measures through expenditure-switching policies \nthat support domestic economic rebalancing, such as increasing the share \nof spending on education, health, and social safety nets, within given \ndeficit levels. They may though at some stage need to raise tax revenue as \na share of GDP to finance the needed social spending, by broadening tax \nbases and improving tax administration.\n\nSuch fiscal shifts will be increasingly important as the region \n\nconfronts rising income inequality while fostering continued economic \nexpansion\u2014an issue further analyzed in the theme chapter.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1  A recent empirical study of the relative importance of finance and trade links between the \neurozone and developing Asia as channels of contagion comes to the same conclusion\u2014\nfinancial sector repercussions will be felt, but trade impacts are potentially larger (M.

IMF Economic Review 58(2). pp. 295-326.\n\n\f30    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nAnnex: The external environment\n\nContinuing the pattern of 2011, developments in the major industrial \neconomies of the United States (US), eurozone, and Japan will hold \nback global economic activity over the next 2 years. In particular, the \neurozone is expected to see renewed recession in 2012. Under the baseline \nassumptions, growth of the industrial economies is expected to edge even \nlower from its already slow 2011 rate of 1.2% to 1.1% in 2012 before picking \nup a shade to 1.7% in 2013. Against this dim global economic backdrop, \nworld merchandise export growth is expected to slow to 3.8% in 2012 \nbefore recovering in 2013 (see Table 1.1.1 at the start of the main text).\n\nRecent developments in major industrial \ncountries\n\nUnited States\n\nData for the first half of 2011 disappointed and spurred \nspeculation about a double-dip recession and additional policy \nstimulus. Uncertainty about the course of the economy reached \nits climax in August when long-term US sovereign credit was \ndowngraded by a major rating agency. In part owing to the \nsituation in the eurozone, however, yields on US treasuries fell \nand the dollar appreciated.\n\nGDP growth\u2014at a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted \n\nannualized rate (qoq saar)\u2014was barely positive in the first \nquarter of 2011, but picked up in the second half with a strong \nperformance in the last quarter when growth reached 3.0% qoq \nsaar, taking it to 1.7% for the year. Industrial production and \nretail sales rose only gradually (Figure A1.1.1) from the trough in \nMay 2009. \n\nThe unsteady climb in consumer confidence ended in March \n\n2011, but has recovered since December last year. The values of \nthe PMI compiled by the Institute for Supply Management lie \nabove 50 for the first 2\u00a0months of 2012, 54.1 for January and 52.4 \nfor February. Values above 50 indicate that the manufacturing \neconomy is generally expanding.\n\nModerate gains in private consumption and fixed \ninvestment accompanied the GDP growth pickup in 2011 \n(Figure A1.1.2). Cuts in government consumption have slowed \nthe recovery and are expected to continue doing so, such that \nin 2012 and 2013 the economy will extend its recovery, but at \na moderate pace only.

Inventories are still adjusting after a large decline \ntoward end-2010. External demand for US goods continued expanding \nthrough 2011. Facilitated by a weaker dollar, net exports made a modest \npositive contribution to GDP growth in 2011.\n\nBeyond the uncertainty originating from outside the country, the \nstate of public finances and the high unemployment rate pose major \nchallenges. But whether immediate progress can be made on \nthese policy fronts is questionable as the country enters another \npresidential election season. When and how policymakers will \nmove on improving future fiscal space by deciding on medium- \nand long-term fiscal reform also affects the forecast for 2012 \nand 2013. Postponing fiscal consolidation until the economy has \nstabilized appears to be desirable, but may not turn out to be \npolitically feasible.\n\nInflation remains well under control (Figure A1.1.3). As \nthe global economy recovers slowly, slow-moving food and \nenergy prices are expected to buttress the recovery. Given \nlow and stable price inflation (not exceeding 2.0% over the \nforecast horizon), monetary policy is also expected to continue \nsupporting the recovery, with the target for the Federal Funds \nrates unchanged within 0\u20130.25% at least until mid-2013, and \nslowly tightened after that.\n\nPolicy efforts are still very much geared to easing the impact \n\nof the previous downturn.

Over the course of the year, however, a raft of \nnew policy measures failed to prevent the sovereign debt crisis \nfrom engulfing Spanish and Italian government debt. Market \nplayers often viewed the timing of these measures as too late \nand kept testing the commitment of all member countries to the \ncommon currency. By year-end, growth for 2011 is estimated to \nhave reached 1.4% year on year, with a negative outlook.\n\nThis negative trend is expected to carry over into 2012, and \nmost forecasters see the eurozone falling back into recession for \nthe year of 0.5%, heavily reflecting the impact of fiscal austerity \nmeasures. The year 2013 may bring better news with GDP \ngrowth reaching 1% year on year. \n\nHowever, developments across countries differ substantially. \n\nGermany and many other core members of the eurozone \nare expected to grow slowly in 2012, whereas those countries \ndirectly affected by the European debt crisis will experience \n\nA1.1.3  Inflation, United States \n\n%, year on year\n\nOverall\n\nCore\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\n \n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 27 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nA1.1.4  Contributions to GDP growth, eurozone\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGross fixed capital formation\nChange in stocks\n\nGovernment consumption\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate \n3\n\nQ1\n2010\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n11\n\nSource: Eurostat. http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu (accessed 4 March 2012). \nClick here for figure data\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n\f32    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nmore pronounced downturns.

Although a disorderly Greek default was prevented \nand additional measures to prevent further spreading of the \ncrisis were agreed in March, July, and October 2011, sovereign \ninterest rate spreads relative to German interest rates rose \nsharply in vulnerable economies, most importantly Spain and \nItaly. Tensions eased only as the European Central Bank (ECB) \nintervened in secondary sovereign debt markets.\n\nDuring the October 2011 fall, the crisis intensified and \nnew measures were taken to calm the situation. Although \npublic attention is often directed to the European Financial \nStability Facility (EFSF) as the prime mechanism to resolve the \nGreek debt crisis, the ECB has played a key role in stabilizing \nfinancial markets. After carefully extending its mandate beyond \nguaranteeing price stability to allow for direct purchases of \ngovernment debt, it has emerged as a true lender of last resort. \n\nIn two longer-term refinancing operations in November 2011 and \nFebruary 2012 offering three year loans at historically low interest rates, \nthe ECB allocated about 1 trillion euros to the European banking sector. \nWith the ECB turning to quantitative easing, sufficient liquidity is in the \nsystem to allow for smooth debt roll-over of most European economies.\n\nJapan\n\nGDP contracted in the first half of 2011 by 2.9% (qoq saar) \n(Figure\u00a0A1.1.10), although the 1.2% second-quarter GDP decline was \nsmaller than expected given the earthquake in March, and may be a \nsign of recovery from the disaster. The contraction mostly occurred in \nexports of automobiles and electronic parts and stemmed from supply \nchain disruptions and weak private demand. Equally important was \ncontinued deflationary pressure.\n\nAlthough reconstruction efforts started to be felt in the \nsecond half of 2011 (annualized quarterly GDP rose by 7.1% in \nthe third quarter), supply-chain disruptions after the flooding in \nThailand during August\u2013November 2011, a persistently strong \nyen, and faltering foreign demand caused the GDP to contract \nby 0.7% in the last quarter of 2011 (qoq saar). GDP fell by 0.7% \nover the whole of 2011.\n\nThe recovery is expected to regain momentum in 2012, \ntouching 1.9% GDP growth before receding to 1.5% in 2013, \nreflecting the dynamics of expected government expenditure: \na sharp increase in 2012 will wear off and slow in 2013. \nReconstruction will be driven by higher government spending \nand private residential investment; private consumption growth, \nby contrast, will remain weak.\n\nThe March disaster boosted imports in 2011, and will \ncontinue to do so this year, such that net exports will not \ncontribute to GDP growth either this year or next. Consumer \nsentiment and business confidence have suffered amid fears \nrelating to the nuclear crisis and deteriorating external environment. \nSluggish wage growth and public expectations of a rise in the \n\n\f34    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nconsumption tax will depress consumer sentiment in the \ncoming years, with private consumption forecast to see almost \nno increase. Government consumption growth will be sustained \nthroughout 2012\u20132013 by relief and reconstruction work, but it \nwill fall back after that. Investment growth will also be boosted \nin 2012 by reconstruction.\n\nIndustrial production recovered from its lows after the \nearthquake at first, but has been slow since (Figure A1.1.11). \nThe floods in Thailand severely affected activity in the \nsemiconductor industry.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation is estimated to have been \n\nabove zero\u20140.3%\u2014in 2011 (Figure A1.1.12) owing to supply-\nside factors, including a loss of agricultural land. Nonetheless, \nJapan\u2019s fundamentally deflationary environment remains in \nplace, and the monetary authority is expected to preserve its \nexpansionary stance while this is the case.\n\nThe Bank of Japan increased its Asset Purchase Program \nto \u00a565 trillion in February 2012. In addition, the Bank of Japan \nintroduced an explicit inflation target of 1% in the same month, \nsuggesting more activity on the monetary policy front in the \nmonths to come.\n\nIn the next 2\u00a0years, moderate economic growth and the \nconsequent narrowing of the output gap will keep inflation in \npositive territory.\n\nInflation\n\n%, year on year\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nA1.1.11  Industrial production index, selected components, \nJapan \n\nSemiconductor parts\n\nMotor vehicle parts\n\nManufacturing\n\nIndex, 2005 = 100\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n12\nSource: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. http://www.meti.go.jp \n(accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n11\n\nApr\n\nOct\n\nJul\n\nA1.1.12  Consumer price inflation and exchange rate, Japan \n\nYen per US$\n\n% change, year on year\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n11\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n12\n\n\fConfronting rising \ninequality in Asia\n\n2\n\n\f\fConfronting rising \ninequality in Asia\n\nOver the past 2\u00a0decades, developing Asia has reduced poverty faster \nthan any other region of the world, at any time in history. But the bulk \nof developing Asia\u2019s population lives in countries with rising inequality. \nThis is in contrast both to the \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d story that marked \nthe transformation of the newly industrialized economies in the 1960s \nand 1970s, and to recent trends in other parts of the developing world, in \nparticular Latin America, where income inequality has been narrowing \nsince the 1990s.\n\nThis theme chapter presents an analysis of inequality in Asia, and \ndevelops a range of policy options to confront the rising inequality. A \nkey message emerging from the analysis is that technological change, \nglobalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014the main drivers of Asia\u2019s \nrapid growth\u2014are the basic forces behind rising inequality in the \nregion. These forces tend to favor owners of capital over labor, high-\nskilled over low-skilled workers, and urban and coastal areas over rural \nand inland regions.\n\nThe impacts of these forces have been compounded by various forms \nof unequal access to opportunity\u2014to earn income from labor and to build \nhuman capital\u2014caused by institutional weaknesses, market distortions, \nand social exclusion. Working together, these have led to a falling share of \nlabor income in total national income, rising premiums on human capital, \nand growing spatial inequality.\n\nYet these three forces should not be obstructed, because they are \nthe engines of productivity and income growth. Policy makers should \nconfront rising inequality through interventions that equalize opportunity \nand reduce inequality, in three areas: efficient fiscal measures that reduce \ninequality in human capital, policies that work toward more and high-\nquality jobs, and interventions that narrow spatial inequality.\n\nThe analysis and policy options in this theme chapter provide a \nbroad road map for policy makers to chart their own, country-specific, \npath to addressing inequality\u2014which, if unchecked, could undermine \nthe momentum for economic growth and for a better quality of life for \nall Asians. \n\nThis chapter was written by Juzhong Zhuang of the Economics and Research \nDepartment (ERD) and Ravi Kanbur, external advisor; with Hyun Son, Jesus Felipe, \nDalisay Maligalig, Iris Claus, Guanghua Wan, Donghyun Park, and Shikha Jha of ERD.

From \n1990 to 2010, the average annual growth rate of gross domestic product \n(GDP) for developing Asia reached 7.0% in 2005 purchasing power parity \n(PPP) terms, more than double the 3.4% for Latin America and the \nCaribbean (Figure\u00a02.1.1). Much of the growth was driven by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India\u2014the world\u2019s two \nmost populous countries\u2014with annual GDP growth of 9.9% \nand 6.4%, respectively.\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nThe rapid growth has dramatically improved living \n\nstandards and greatly reduced poverty. During 1990\u22122010, the \nregion\u2019s average per capita GDP in 2005 PPP terms increased \nfrom $1,633 to $5,133. The proportion of the population living\non or below the $1.25-a-day poverty line fell from 53.9% in 1990\nto 21.5% around 2008, as 716\u00a0million people were lifted out of \npoverty. Seventeen countries reduced poverty by more than \n15\u00a0percentage points in the period.\n\n\u2026 but widening inequality\n\nThis performance in growth and poverty reduction has, \nhowever, been accompanied by rising inequality in many \ncountries. Of the 28 countries that have comparative data \nbetween the 1990s and 2000s, 11\u2014accounting for about 82% \nof developing Asia\u2019s population in 2010\u2014experienced rising \ninequality of per capita expenditure or income, as measured by \nthe Gini coefficient (Figure\u00a02.1.2).1\n\nDeveloping Asia has historically been a region with \nrelatively low levels of inequality, especially compared with \nother regions such as Latin America. Unlike developing Asia, \nthough, most Latin American countries have seen narrowing \ninequality in the last 2\u00a0decades\u2014even if average inequality there \nis still much wider than in developing Asia.\n\nConcepts of inequality\n\nInequality of outcome and of opportunity\n\nIn discussing inequality, it is useful to distinguish two concepts: \ninequality of outcome and inequality of opportunity. A principal building \nblock of economics is the idea of human welfare\u2014a broad sense of an \nindividual\u2019s \u201cwell-being.\u201d Individuals will use the resources that they have \n\n2.1.1  GDP growth 1990\u20132010 and poverty reduction \n1990s\u20132000s\n\nPoverty reduction at $1.25 a day (2005 PPP$)\n\nGDP growth\n\nCumulative reduction in \npoverty rate, \npercentage points\n\nAnnualized GDP \ngrowth rate, %\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nCA\n\nPAC\n\nSA\n\nSEA\n\nEA\n\nDA\n\nMENA\n\nLAC\n\nSSA\n\nCA =Central Asia; DA = Developing Asia; EA =East Asia; LAC = Latin America \nand the Carribean; MENA = Middle East and North Africa; PAC = The Pacific; \nSA\u00a0=\u00a0South\u00a0Asia; SEA = Southeast Asia; SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa.\nNote: Cumulative reduction in poverty rate is estimated as the difference in \nthe percentage of poor people between the latest year in the 2000s and the \nearliest year in the 1990s for which data are available, weighted by 2010 and \n1990 population, respectively. For Asia and the Pacific these include Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan \n(Central Asia); People\u2019s Republic of China (East Asia); Fiji and Timor-Leste \n(Pacific); Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka \n(South Asia); and Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam (Southeast Asia). \nSource: ADB estimates using data from PovcalNet (accessed 9 March 2012) and \nWorld Development Indicators online database (accessed 7 February 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     39\n\n2.1.2  Annualized change in inequality of expenditure or \nincome, developing Asia, 1990s and 2000s\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-4\n%\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The annualized growth of the Gini coefficient refers to growth between \nthe earliest available figure in the 1990s (except for Bhutan, Fiji, and Samoa, \nwhich are in the early 2000s) and the latest available figure in the 2000s.

In the study of inequality, income \nor expenditure are commonly used to proxy the outcome of this \nprocess.\n\nFocusing solely on income or expenditure can, though, \n\nbe limiting. Non-income dimensions like education and \nhealth have come to the fore in recent years offering a \nmultidimensional perspective on inequality and poverty. Good \nhealth, for example, confers on individuals benefits that are \nnot fully captured by the increment it provides to incomes. \nInequality in education and health may manifest themselves as \ndifferences in access and coverage among population groups \ndefined by their income, gender, ethnic origin, or birth location.\n\nWhile the concept of inequality of outcome suggests \nthe endpoint of a process, one can usefully think of how to \ndistinguish between the resources that one has available and \nthe level of effort applied. Inequality of opportunity is the \nportion of the inequality of outcome that can be attributed \nto differences in \u201cindividual circumstances\u201d (Roemer 1998). \nBy circumstances we mean those features that are outside the \ncontrol of an individual, such as gender, race, ethnicity, or place \nof birth. The same is true of a child\u2019s parental characteristics, \nfor example, father\u2019s education or income.\n\nOn the other hand, given an individual\u2019s circumstances, \n\nwhat individuals choose for effort in the labor market or \nin education\u2014\u201cindividual effort\u201d\u2014will also influence their \noutcomes.\n\nMaldives\nBhutan\nUzbekistan\nTimor-Leste\nKyrgyz Rep.\nArmenia\nKazakhstan\nFiji\nSamoa\nThailand\nPakistan\nNepal\nAzerbaijan\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nCambodia\nViet Nam\nTaipei,China\nTajikistan\nIndia\nMongolia\nBangladesh\nGeorgia\nRepublic of Korea\nSri Lanka\nLao PDR\nIndonesia\nPRC\n\nApplying the concepts\n\nThe distinction between inequality of opportunity and \ninequality of outcome can be particularly useful in guiding \npublic policy. Equality of opportunity is not only intrinsically \nimportant, but also a critical condition for a prosperous society. \nPublic policy must be put in place to reduce or eliminate inequality of \nopportunity. As we will argue later, equality of opportunity is at the \nheart of the inclusive growth concept. In this chapter our focus will \nbe on equality of opportunity, on assuring that everybody has equal \nopportunity to participate in the growth process and benefit from its \nfruits, equitably. To the extent that inequality of parents\u2019 income leads \nto inequality of opportunity for children, this inequality needs to be \novercome by interventions to assure equal access to public services and to \nmarkets for all in society.\n\nIn the real world, a clear distinction between inequality of outcome \nand of opportunity is not straightforward. There could also be differences \nin opinion on what constitute circumstances and what constitute efforts \nin a society (Roemer 1998; Paes de Barros et al. 2009). Even with these \ndifficulties, in many low-income countries, it is relatively easy to observe \nextreme circumstances that severely limit opportunities for a large \nsegment of the population.\n\nThese circumstances include the lack of, or unequal access to, the \nhigh-quality jobs and public services to which every citizen is meant to \n\n\f40    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nhave equal access irrespective of circumstance\u2014variations in this access \nreflect inequality of opportunity. For children, variations in access to \neducation and health are indicators of inequality of opportunity, as these \nare outside children\u2019s control.\n\nThis distinction is something of which Asian policy makers are aware \n(Box\u00a02.1.1). Beyond the intrinsic value of equality\u2014the idea of fairness, for \nwhich most humans are hard wired\u2014does inequality make any difference \nfor a country\u2019s development?\n\n2.1.1 Opportunity vs. outcome\u2014Perceptions from Asia\n\nHow do Asians view the distinction between inequality of \nopportunity and inequality of income?

Both poverty reduction and the foundations for future \ngrowth can be strengthened by ensuring that the benefits of development \nare shared broadly.\n\nInequality and poverty reduction\n\nRising inequality hampers poverty reduction. For countries with \ncomparable data, Figure\u00a02.1.3 compares actual poverty headcount rates \n(using the $1.25-a-day poverty line in 2008) with the poverty headcount\nrates simulated keeping inequality unchanged from the 1990s to the \n2000s. The simulations highlight the degree to which rising \ninequality holds back poverty reduction. Had inequality not \nincreased, notably:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIn India, the poverty headcount rate would have been \nreduced to 29.5% in 2008, instead of the actual 32.7%;\nIn the PRC, extreme poverty would have declined to \n4.9%, instead of the actual 13.1%;\nIn Indonesia, the poverty rate would have fallen to 6.1%, \ninstead of the actual 16.3%.\n\nBangladesh\n\nLao PDR\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nGeorgia\n\nPRC\n\nTajikistan\n\nSri Lanka\n\nFor the 11 economies with rising inequality, the cost of that \n\nwidening comes to 240\u00a0million more people trapped under \nthe $1.25-a-day poverty line\u20146.5% of the region\u2019s population\ntoday. In contrast, those countries with decreasing inequality \nhad smaller poverty rates than they would have had with stable \ninequality.\n\nInequality, institutions, and growth\n\nSo, not only does inequality dampen the poverty reduction \nimpact of growth, it can also affect growth itself, through a number of \neconomic, social, and political mechanisms.\n\nInequality of wealth and income can lead to a misallocation of \nhuman capital. Those with little wealth or low income are unable to \ninvest in human capital, or wealth- and income-enhancing activities, \nand will remain poor. In principle they may be able to borrow to finance \ninvestment. But imperfect financial markets, coupled with other market \nfailures, often heavily constrain their ability to borrow and invest. \nSimilarly, much evidence shows that small enterprises have high potential \nrates of return to investment but are constrained from accessing capital \n(for example, de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2008).\n\nWidening inequality\u2014leaving more people at the top and bottom of the \nladder\u2014can also mean a hollowing out of the middle class. The importance \nof the middle class for stability and growth has been emphasized and \nanalyzed in recent years. Birdsall (2010, p.158), for example, has argued \nthat \u201cgrowth driven by and benefiting a middle class is more likely to \nbe sustained\u2014both economically, to the extent that the rent seeking \nand corruption associated with highly concentrated gains to growth \nare avoided, and politically, to the extent that conflict and horizontal \ninequalities between racial and ethnic groups are easier to manage\u2026.\u201d\n\n\f42    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nIn fact, there is a broad consensus among analysts on the link between \n\ninequality and the quality of institutions. Along several dimensions, \nranging from political stability, through institutional stability, to property \nrights, the negative impact of inequality on institutional quality seems \nto be well established, although the two-way causality is also widely \nrecognized (Zhuang et al. 2010; Nye forthcoming). At the same time, \nthere is also a literature on the effect of inequality on crime and violence \nand, through that, on the investment climate (for example, Fajnzylber, \nLederman, and Loayza 2002; \u00d6zler and Demombynes 2002).\n\nFinally, greater inequality may lead to a political backlash, in which \n\npressure grows for governments to enact populist policy measures. In \nresponse to the rising demands, the political process may favor policies \nwhich, in the short term, would benefit the lower end of the income \ndistribution, but which in the long run could hold back efficiency and \ngrowth (Alesina and Rodrik 1994). Under such conditions, the interests of \nthe political system diverge from the interests of the economy as a whole. \nThis is a widespread concern in developing and developed countries alike.\nEmpirically establishing the linkage between inequality and growth is \nnot easy, because numerous factors are at work, and economic analysis is \noften subject to data and methodological limitations. Unsurprisingly, the \nempirical evidence is itself mixed (for example, Kanbur and Lustig 2000; \nBarro 2008).\n\nRecent studies by Berg and Ostry (2011a, 2011b), however, provide \nconvincing evidence on the inequality\u2013growth relationship. The studies \nmake a key distinction between growth over the short run and growth \nover the long run (Box\u00a02.1.2). This corresponds to the different issues \ninvolved in \u201cigniting\u201d growth versus sustaining it over the long run. \nMany countries can ignite growth in the short run, but far fewer can \nsustain it (Hausmann, Pritchett, and Rodrik 2005). The econometric \nanalysis of Berg and Ostry confirms that inequality is a key variable \nexplaining long-run growth. Thus not only does rising inequality dent the \npoverty impact of a given growth rate, it can also affect the sustainability \nof a growth path.\n\nInequality on the policy agenda\n\nGovernments are not blind to the problem. Indeed, in recent years more \nof them have embraced the concept of inclusive growth to make income \ndistribution more equitable:\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t\n\nIn the PRC, where the Gini coefficient of per capita expenditure \nworsened from about 32.4 in 1990 to 43.4 in 2008, the government \nset about building a harmonious society as the development goal \nin its Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u22122010). This goal has been \nreaffirmed in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u22122015), with greater \nemphasis on the quality\u2014not just the rate\u2014of growth, and \nmaking growth inclusive.\nIn India, where the Gini coefficient deteriorated from 32.5 in 1993 \nto 37 in 2010, the government made an explicit commitment to \ninclusive growth in its Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007\u22122012). The \ncentral vision of the plan is \u201c\u2026not just faster growth but also \n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     43\n\n2.1.2  Inequality and sustained growth\n\nIn analyzing the determinants of growth, one needs to \nmake an important distinction between short-term and \nlong-term growth. The course of economic growth does \nnot run smooth. Growth over a long period is made up \nof \u201cgrowth spells,\u201d where growth accelerates to a higher \nrate then falls again. Some of this is purely cyclical, but a \nrecent literature focuses on finding policy and structural \ndeterminants of the frequency and length of these spells.\nThis literature suggests that accelerating growth in the \nshort run may be easier than sustaining it over the longer \nterm\u2014and at the very least the determinants of these two \ntypes of growth can be very different. The former can be \nachieved by a set of conventional reforms that lead to a \nburst of investment and output\u2014liberalization of trade or \nfinance, for example. But sustaining this growth requires \nlonger-term institutional underpinnings (Rodrik 2005).\n\nFurther, economies are subject to shocks, even more so \nin an era of globalization. How policy makers respond to \nthese shocks will determine the speed and sustainability of \nthe rebound and the subsequent growth path. But because \nany policy response will invariably have distributional \nconsequences, the ability of policy makers to push through \nefficient responses to shocks depends on their ability to \nmanage the distributional consequences of these responses \n(Rodrik 1999).\n\nInability to manage these shocks, and more generally \nthe distributional consequences of efficient reforms, will \nmean that growth accelerations will peter out sooner than \n\nif these shocks are managed well, and growth spells will be \nshorter. Long-run growth will therefore be lower.\n\nBerg and Ostry (2011b) argue that inequality can \ninfluence the duration of growth spells through several \nchannels:\n\u2022\t With credit market imperfections, inequality inhibits \n\nprivate investment in human capital.\n\n\u2022\t If the distribution of political power follows the \n\ndistribution of income, this may lead, on the one \nhand, to pressure for populist policies from the bottom \nend, and, on the other, to efforts by elites to resist \nthis pressure through corruption\u2014both of which are \ninefficient and detrimental to growth.\n\n\u2022\t Inequality may increase the risk of political instability.\n\nBerg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer (2008) test for the effect \n\nof inequality on growth, focusing on its impact on the \nduration of growth spells. The empirical results show that \nincome distribution survives as one of the most robust \nand important factors associated with growth duration. A \n10-percentile decrease in inequality increases the expected \nlength of a growth spell by 50%. They conclude that \ninequality is a more robust predictor of growth duration \nthan many variables widely understood to be central to \ngrowth.\n\nSources: Berg and Ostry (2011a, 2011b); Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer \n(2008); Rodrik (1999, 2005).\n\ninclusive growth, that is, a growth process which yields broad-\nbased benefits and ensures equality of opportunity for all.\u201d\n\n\u2022\t The 2010\u22122014 development plan for Indonesia, which saw its Gini \ncoefficient worsen from 29 in 1990 to 39 in 2011, offers a vision of \na society supported by five national development agendas, among \nthem inclusive and just development.\n\n\u2022\t Malaysia\u2019s 2011\u20132015 Development Plan is based on the \u201c1Malaysia: \nPeople First, Performance Now\u201d concept, and adopts an inclusive \ndevelopment approach to ensure equitable access to economic \nparticipation among all Malaysians, particularly aiming at \nimproving livelihood of the poorer 40% of households.\nIn the Philippines, the vision of the 2011\u20132016 medium-\nterm development plan is to achieve inclusive growth, create \nemployment opportunities, and reduce poverty.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t Thailand\u2019s 2012\u20132016 Development Strategy is based on \n\nthe \u201csufficiency economy\u201d philosophy and people-centered \ndevelopment, with a vision of equity, fairness, and resilience.\n\nTo gauge the extent of the rising concerns over inequality among \nAsian policy makers, in early 2012 ADB carried out a web-based survey \n\n\f44    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n(Box\u00a02.1.3).

The first is the World \nBank\u2019s PovcalNet, which provides Gini coefficients for most of the \ncountries covered. The PovcalNet also provides grouped per capita \nincome or expenditure data (by decile), from which the quintile ratios \nand growth incidence by quintile can be computed. The grouped \nexpenditure data (together with rural and urban populations) were also \nused to estimate the national Gini coefficients for the PRC and Indonesia \nfor more recent years as they are not available in PovcalNet. \n\nThe second is unit-level household survey data, which are used for \n\nestimating growth incidence curves, the top 5% and 1% income (or \nexpenditure) shares, and GE(0) indexes (in decomposition analysis) for \na selection of countries. Unit-level survey data are also used to estimate \nGini coefficients and quintile ratios when PovcalNet does not provide \nsufficient data, mostly for Pacific countries. Inequality measures for India \nare all calculated from unit-level household survey data. \n\nThe third source is official statistical publications or databases for all \n\nOECD countries, the Republic of Korea, and Taipei,China.\n\nInequality can be estimated for per capita income or per capita \n\nexpenditure. The two measures usually give different results, with income \ninequality normally higher than expenditure inequality. For example, the \nincome measure of the Gini was 47 in the Philippines in 2009 while the \nexpenditure measure was 43. Viet\u00a0Nam provides a more stark example: \nthe income measure was 46 in 2008 and the expenditure measure 37. For \nmost developing Asian countries, this theme chapter estimates inequality \nmeasures from expenditure data, with the exception of those for \nMalaysia and Taipei,China that are based on income data. Estimates for \nSub-Saharan African countries are also based on expenditure data, while \nthose for Latin American and OECD countries are based on income data. \nThese are largely determined by data availability.\n\nStandard measures of inequality are discussed in Box\u00a02.2.1.\n\nRecent trends of income inequality estimates in \ndeveloping Asia\n\nHigher growth and rising inequality\n\nOf the 36 economies with available data in 2000s (Table 2.2.1),2 13 had a \nGini coefficient at or greater than 40, widely considered the threshold for \n\u201chigh inequality.\u201d3 The average Gini for the 36 economies is 37.4 Eleven \nof the 28 economies with comparable data show an increase (worsening) \nin the coefficient in the last 2 decades. These 11 cover 82% of the region\u2019s \npopulation. On an annual basis, the increase in inequality was most \npronounced in the PRC: the Gini there worsened from 32.4 to 43.4 in \n1990\u20132008 (1.6% a year). Indonesia\u2019s increased from 29.2 in 1990 to 38.9 in \n2011 (1.4% a year).\n\n\f46    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n2.2.1  Methods for measuring inequality\n\nThe Gini coefficient is one measure of dispersion of a \nfrequency distribution, for example, of how income \nor consumption expenditures are distributed across \nhouseholds. For an income distribution, the Gini is \ncomputed as follows:\n\nGini\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\nn\n+\nn\n\n)1\n\n+\n\nn\n\n\u2211=\n\ni\n\ni\n1\n\nx\n\ni\n\n2\n2\n\u00b5\nx\n\nn\n\nwhere xi is the income (or expenditure) of individual i, \n\u00b5x is the average income of the population, and n is the \ntotal number of individuals in the population. The Gini \nwill range from 0 if all individuals have the same income \n(perfect equality) to 1 if income is held by only one person \nin the population (perfect inequality). For convenience, \nthis theme chapter cites the Gini multiplied by 100.\n\nThe quintile income (or expenditure) ratio is the ratio of \nthe total income (or expenditure) of the top (richest) 20% \nof the population to that of the bottom (poorest) 20%.\n\nGeneralized entropy GE(0) is one member of a family \n\nof measures derived from the notion of entropy in \ninformation theory. It is also known as Theil\u2019s second \nmeasure and can be computed as follows:\n\nGE(0)\n\n=\n\n1\nn\n\nn\n\u2211\n=\ni\n\n1\n\nln\n\nx\n\n\u00b5 )\n\nx\n\ni\n\n(\n\nA major attraction of this index is that it is decomposable: \nthe total inequality can be decomposed into a component \nmeasuring inequality between groups and components \nmeasuring inequality within groups.\n\nIncome (or expenditure) shares of the top 1% and 5% of \n\nthe households in the distribution focus on income (or \nexpenditure) shares of the richest households.\n\nThe growth incidence curve plots per capita income (or \nexpenditure) growth at each point of an income distribution \nbetween two periods, which can provide more detailed \ninsight into what is driving changes in the distribution over \ntime than any summary measure of inequality.\n\nThere appears to be a positive and statistically significant relationship \n\nbetween the increase in the Gini (rising inequality) and GDP growth \n(Figure\u00a02.2.1).\n\nThe trend of rising inequality is widespread in the region. \n\nYet 14 economies with data in the 2\u00a0decades recorded an \nimprovement in the Gini, five from Central Asia. Part of the \nformer Soviet Union, these five underwent dramatic economic \nand social transformation from the late 1980s, when the Gini \nsurged, but the coefficient declined in more recent years as \ntheir economies became more stable. In the Kyrgyz Republic, \nfor example, the Gini worsened from 26 in 1988 to 53.7 in 1993, \nthen declined to 36.2 in 2009.\n\nMost of the other countries that saw an improving Gini \ncoefficient (sometimes sharply) have a small economy: Bhutan, \nFiji, Maldives, Nepal, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Samoa. Some \nof them are vulnerable to shocks. Maldives, for instance, \nexperienced a devastating tsunami in 2004 and Timor-Leste \nwent through civil conflicts. These are likely to have impacted \non incomes of different classes and on income distribution.\nTo gain more insight into the pattern of inequality and \nits change over time, we look at the Gini coefficient of urban \nand rural subpopulations within a country, focusing on the \nPRC, India and Indonesia, the region\u2019s three most populous \ncountries.\n\nIn the PRC, rural and urban inequalities increased in \n1990\u20132008\u2014urban from 25.6 to 35.2 and rural from 30.6 to 39.4 \n\n2.2.1  GDP growth and change in the Gini coefficient\n\nChange in Gini coefficient, 1990s\u22122000s \n\ny = 0.668x - 4.328 \nR\u00b2 = 0.047\n\nMON\nPHI\n\nINO\n\nKOR\nAZE\nNEP\nPAK\nTHA\n\nSRI\nBAN\n\nLAO\nIND\n\nCAM\n\nVIE\n\nMAL\n\nBHU\n\nFIJ\n\nSAM\n\nARM\n\nKAZ\n\nTIM\n\nUZB\n\nKGZ\n\nMLD\n\nGEO\n\nTAJ\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-2\n\nPRC\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nAnnualized GDP growth, 1990\u22122010 (%)\n\nARM\u00a0=\u00a0Armenia (1998\u20132008); AZE\u00a0=\u00a0Azerbaijan (1995\u20132008); BAN\u00a0=\u00a0Bangladesh \n(1991\u20132010); BHU\u00a0=\u00a0Bhutan (2003\u20132007); CAM\u00a0=\u00a0Cambodia (1994\u20132008); \nFIJ\u00a0=\u00a0Fiji (2002\u20132008); GEO\u00a0=\u00a0Georgia (1996\u20132008); IND\u00a0=\u00a0India (1993\u20132010); \nINO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia (1990\u20132011); KAZ\u00a0=Kazakhstan (1993\u20132009); KOR\u00a0=\u00a0Rep. of \nKorea (1992\u20132010); KGZ\u00a0=\u00a0Kyrgyz Republic (1993\u20132009); LAO\u00a0=\u00a0Lao People\u2019s Dem. \nRep.

The pace in both was similar, leaving rural areas \nmore unequal than urban areas, a position unlike that in most \ndeveloping countries. However, the rate of increase appears to \nhave been slowing since the early 2000s, for both areas.5\n\nIn India, the urban Gini grew from 34.4 in 1993 to 39.3 in \n\n2010, much faster than the contemporaneous growth of the \nrural Gini, from 28.6 to 30.0. India\u2019s rural inequality is lower \nand urban inequality is higher than in the PRC and, unlike \nthe PRC but like most developing countries, India\u2019s urban \ninequality is higher than its rural inequality.\n\nSimilarly in Indonesia, urban inequality has been \nconsistently higher than rural inequality, respectively, in \n2011, 42.2 and 34. During 1990\u20132011, both urban and rural \ninequalities increased (but urban inequality faster).\n\nQuintile ratios\n\nThe Gini coefficient presents an aggregate measure of \ninequality in a distribution, and it may hide detailed patterns \nof differences across different levels of income. Table 2.2.1 \nabove presents the quintile ratios\u2014the ratio of the per capita \nexpenditure of the top 20% to that of the bottom 20%. In the \nlate 2000s, 126 out of the 32 economies with available data had \na quintile ratio at or above 7, that is, the average per capita \nexpenditure of the richest 20% households was at least seven \ntimes as high as that of the poorest 20%. The mean quintile \nratio for the 32 economies was 7.1.7\n\nTable 2.2.1 also shows that on an annual basis, the change \n\nin the quintile ratio is more pronounced than the change in \nthe Gini for almost all the countries. For example, the PRC\u2019s \nannualized rate of increase of the Gini was 1.6%, but 3.6% for \nthe quintile ratio (the ratio grew from 5.1 in 1990 to 9.6 in 2008). The \nlarger increase in inequality when measured by the quintile ratio than \nby the Gini suggests that rising inequality may have been driven by \nhouseholds at the top.\n\nGrowth incidence curves\n\nGrowth incidence curves provide more detail on distributional changes \nby allowing one to look at income growth between two periods at various \npoints of an income distribution. Figure\u00a02.2.3 shows the annual growth \nof mean per capita expenditure by quintile as well as for the entire \npopulation for the countries experiencing rising inequality in the last \n2\u00a0decades with available data.8\n\nAll income groups of households (apart from Georgia\u2019s) experienced \nper capita expenditure growth during the periods reviewed. This suggests \nthat economic growth has raised living standards for all people in these \ncountries. However, per capita expenditure grew much faster for the top \nquintile households than for the lower quintiles, especially than for the \nbottom quintile.\n\nIn the PRC, for example, the mean expenditure growth for the bottom \nquintile in 1990\u20132008 was only 4%, but 7.6% for the top quintile. In India, \nthe mean growth was only 0.8% for the bottom quintile but 1.9% for the \n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     49\n\n2.2.3  Growth incidence by quintile, countries with rising inequality\n\nQuintile 1\n\nQuintile 2\n\nQuintile 3\n\nQuintile 4\n\nQuintile 5\n\nPopulation mean\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\nBangladesh \n(1991\u22122010)\n\nGeorgia \n(1996\u22122008)\n\nIndia \n(1993\u22122010)\n\nIndonesia \n(1990\u22122011)\n\nLao PDR \n(1992\u22122008)\n\nPRC \n(1990\u22122008)\n\nSri Lanka \n(1990\u22122006)\n\nTajikistan \n(1999\u22122009)\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates using PovcalNet (accessed 9 March 2012) and household survey data (India).\nClick here for figure data\n\ntop quintile. (In Georgia, income fell for all quintile groups in 1996\u20132008, \nthough as the decline was more significant for the bottom quintile than \nfor the top quintile, inequality widened).\n\nFigure\u00a02.2.3 also compares mean growth of each quintile with that \nof the population. It shows that in all the countries (but the PRC and \nTajikistan), rising inequality involves a shift of income from the bottom \n80% of the population to the top 20%, as indicated by lower mean \nexpenditure growth for quintiles 1 to 4 than that for the whole \npopulation. In the PRC and Tajikistan, with mean expenditure \ngrowth for quintiles 1 to 3 lower than and for quintile 4 close \nto that of the top quintile, rising inequality involves a shift of \nincome from the bottom 60% to the top 20% of population.\n\nFigure\u00a02.2.4 shows growth incidence curves for India and \n\nIndonesia using unit-level survey data. The results largely \nconfirm the findings from mean expenditure growth by \nquintile. The growth incidence curve cuts across the line of \ngrowth of population mean per capita expenditure at close to \nthe 80th percentile, suggesting that rising inequality in the \ntwo countries has been driven by income redistribution to the \ntop 20%, at a cost to the bottom 80%. The growth incidence \ncurve increases monotonically for Indonesia. But for India, \nexpenditure growth at the lowest few percentiles was higher \nthan growth of population mean per capita expenditure.\n\nExpenditure shares of the top 5% and 1%\n\nFigure\u00a02.2.5 goes further up the income distribution, focusing \non the very top. In terms of levels, there are large variations \nin the expenditure shares of the top 5% and 1%. Except for the \nPacific countries, in the late 2000s the shares of the richest \nhouseholds are relatively close across countries, in the range of \n17\u221222% for the top 5% and 6\u22129% for the top 1%. For the Pacific \ncountries, the shares of the top 5% and 1% are higher with a \nwider variation: 15\u221228% for the top 5% and 5\u221216% for the top 1%.\nConsistent with the changes in the Gini and quintile ratios, \nmost of the countries in Figure\u00a02.2.5 show that the expenditure \nshares of the top 1% and 5% increased during the review \n\n2.2.4  Growth incidence curves, Indonesia and India\n\nIndia (1993\u22122009)\n\nGrowth incidence curve\n\nGrowth rate in mean\n\nAnnual growth rate, %\n4\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nExpenditure percentiles\n\nIndonesia (1990\u22122010)\n\nGrowth incidence curve\n\nGrowth rate in mean\n\nAnnual growth rate, %\n4.7\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n4.4\n\n4.1\n\n3.8\n\n3.5\n\n3.2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nExpenditure percentiles\n\nSource: ADB estimates using household survey data.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f2.2.5  Expenditure shares of the top 5% and 1%\n\nTop 5%\n\nTop 1%\n\nAsia\n\nBhutan\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\n2003\n\n2007\n\n1995\n\n2008\n\n1993\n\n2010\n\n1990\n\n2011\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nSri Lanka\n\n1990/91\n\n2007/08\n\n1991\n\n2009\n\n1990/91\n\n2009\n\nThe Pacific\n\nTonga\n\n2001\n\nTuvalu\n\n2004\n\nKiribati\n\n2006\n\nNauru\n\n2006\n\nFSM\n\n1998\n\nFiji\n\nSamoa\n\n2002\n\n2008\n\nSolomon\n\n2006\n\nVanuatu\n\n2006\n\nPalau\n\n2006\n\nTimor-Leste\n\n2001\n\n50    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nperiods.

In India, the shares of the top 5% and 1% increased from \n17.7% and 6.5% in 1993 to 21.3% and 9%, respectively, in 2010. \nThese results back up the earlier point that rising inequality in \ndeveloping Asia is closely associated with very rapid increases in \nthe very top income groups\u2014that is, the rich are getting richer \nmuch faster.\n\nWithin- and between-country inequality\nAlthough the focus of this chapter is on inequality within each \ncountry, it is useful both to look at Asia-wide inequality that \nconsiders developing Asian countries as one entity and to ask how \nimportant within-country inequality is, compared with between-\ncountry inequality.\n\nThe Asia-wide Gini coefficient increased from 39 in the \nmid-1990s to 46 in the late 2000s, or 1.4% a year. Both within-\ncountry and between-country inequality as measured by the \nGE(0) index (Box\u00a02.2.1 above) widened (Figure\u00a02.2.6). However, \nbetween-country inequality grew faster, as its contribution to \nAsia-wide inequality rose from about 22.6% in the mid-1990s to \n29.6% in the late 2000s, while the contribution of within-country \ninequality to Asia-wide inequality declined from 77.4% to 70.4% in \nthe same period. The between-country income differences can be \nlargely explained by much faster growth in the PRC than in the \nrest of the region.\n\nAsia\u2019s inequality in a global context\nBefore going into a detailed comparison of Asia\u2019s inequality \nvis-\u00e0-vis other groupings, a word of caution. Inequality measures \nare by and large based on per capita incomes for OECD and \nLatin American countries, while they are based on per capita \nexpenditure in most developing Asian countries (as well as \nSub-Saharan Africa). As noted earlier, income-based inequality \nmeasures tend to run higher than expenditure-based ones.9\n\nDespite recent increases, Gini coefficients in developing Asia \nare still on average lower than in other regions of the developing \nworld (Figure\u00a02.2.7). Developing Asia\u2019s range of Gini coefficients \nof 28\u221251 is tighter than that of Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 30\u221266, and \nlower than that of Latin America and the Caribbean\u2019s 45\u221260. This \nconclusion is likely to hold even if we consider the differences \nbetween income-based and expenditure-based inequalities.\n\nYet developing Asia compares less favorably when one looks at \n\nchanges in inequality. During the last decade, most Sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries and more than half of Latin American and \nCaribbean countries experienced declines in Gini. In developing \nAsia, 11 out of the 28 economies with comparable data, covering \n82% of the region\u2019s population, experienced increases in inequality \n(Figure\u00a02.2.8 below).\n\n0\n\n20\n10\nExpenditure share, %\n\n30\n\nFSM = Federated States of Micronesia; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates using household survey data.\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.2.6  Decomposition of Asia-wide inequality\n\nWithin-country inequality\n\nBetween-country inequality\n\n%\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nGE(0)  = 0.187\nShare = 77.4%\n\nGE(0)  = 0.241\nShare = 70.4%\n\nGE(0)  = 0.055\nShare = 22.6%\n\n1996\n\nGE(0)  = 0.101\nShare = 29.6%\n\n2008\n\nGE(0) = See Box 2.2.1.\nNote: Asia-wide inequality pertains to 23 countries where comparative data are \navailable for 1996 and 2008 or closest available.\nSource: ADB estimates using grouped expenditure data from PovcalNet \n(accessed 9 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     51\n\n2.2.7  Gini coefficients, 2000s\n\nOECD\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nEconomies\n\nNote: Markers indicate individual country observations for each region ranked \nby the value of the Gini coefficient.

Large, conditional cash transfer programs, \nsuch as Bolsa Familia in Brazil and Progresa/Oportunidades in \nMexico, have played a central role in the turnaround (Esquivel, \nLustig, and Scott 2010).\n\nCompared with OECD countries, however, developing Asia\u2019s \n\ninequality is much higher overall. Of the 34 OECD countries \nwith comparative data, most countries had a Gini in the range \nof 25\u221235. High taxes and transfers are key reasons for their \nlow income inequality. Twenty OECD countries had a Gini \ncoefficient before taxes and transfers greater than 40 in the \nmid-2000s (Figure\u00a02.2.9).\n\nYet even in OECD countries, as in developing Asia, \n\ninequality is on the rise: 17 OECD countries saw increases in the \nGini coefficient from the mid-1990s to late 2000s (Figure\u00a02.2.8).10\nA study by OECD (2011a) reports that in many OECD countries \nhousehold incomes increased much faster at the top income \nranges from the mid-1990s to the late 2000s, similar to the \nexperiences of many developing Asian countries. On average, \nincome growth for households in the top decile was 1.5 times as \nhigh as that for the bottom decile from the mid-1980s to late-\n2000s for 27 OECD countries. The difference in income growth \nbetween the top and bottom deciles was particularly significant \nin Germany, Sweden, the US, and the Netherlands, in the range \nof 3 to 15 times as high.\n\nThe OECD study identified various factors contributing to \n\nrising inequality, such as increased financial integration and \ntechnological change; increased imports from low-income \ncountries, reducing employment prospects for less skilled \nworkers; changes in labor market policies that tended to \nreduce income and benefits for less skilled workers; increasing \nprevalence of part-time work; greater numbers of single-headed \nhouseholds; increasing income shares for capital, benefiting \nrich households; increased incomes from self-employment, \nwhich reward the more highly skilled workers; and declining \neffectiveness of redistribution through taxes and transfers.\n\nOECD average\n\nChile\nMexico\nTurkey\nUnited States\nIsrael\nPortugal\nUnited Kingdom\nItaly\nCanada\nAustralia\nJapan\nNew Zealand\nSpain\nPoland\nGreece\nEstonia\nIceland\nGermany\nKorea, Rep. of\nNetherlands\nFrance\nLuxembourg\nSwitzerland\nIreland\nHungary\nAustria\nSweden\nFinland\nBelgium\nNorway\nCzech Republic\nSlovakia\nDenmark\nSlovenia\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nSource: OECD Stat database (accessed 24 February 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f52    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n2.2.8  Annualized change in Gini coefficient: Developing Asia and other regions, 1990s and 2000s\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nOther developing regions\n\nPRC\nIndonesia\n\nLao PDR\n\nSri Lanka\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nGeorgia\nBangladesh\nMongolia\nIndia\nTajikistan\n\nTaipei,China\n\nViet Nam\nCambodia\n\nPhilippines\nMalaysia\nAzerbaijan\n\nNepal\nPakistan\nThailand\nSamoa\n\nFiji\nKazakhstan\nArmenia\n\nKyrgyz Republic\nTimor-Leste\n\nUzbekistan\nBhutan\nMaldives\n\nSweden\nDenmark\nFinland\nSpain\nGermany\nAustria\nCanada\nLuxembourg\nIsrael\nNorway\nAustralia\nUnited States\nFrance\nUnited Kingdom\nPortugal\nJapan\nCzech Republic\nNetherlands\nRepublic of Korea\nNew Zealand\nItaly\nGreece\nChile\nHungary\nBelgium\nMexico\nIreland\nTurkey\n\n-9\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n3\n\n-3\n%\n\nOECD members\n\nMiddle East and\nNorth Africa\n\nYemen, Rep.\nMorocco\nTunisia\nEgypt, Arab Rep.\nIran, Islamic Rep.\nJordan\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\nSeychelles\nGhana\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire\nTanzania\nNigeria\nSouth Africa\nZambia\nMozambique\nUganda\nBurundi\nRwanda\nMadagascar\nCameroon\nCentral African Rep.\nGuinea\nSwaziland\nLesotho\nGambia\nMauritania\nKenya\nBurkina Faso\nNiger\nSenegal\nMali\nEthiopia\nGuinea-Bissau\nMalawi\n\nLatin America and\nthe Caribbean\n\nBolivia\nParaguay\nCosta Rica\nColombia\nVenezuela\nUruguay\nGuatemala\nHonduras\nChile\nDominican Rep.\nBrazil\nPanama\nEcuador\nEl Salvador\nMexico\nNicaragua\nPeru\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n%\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2\n\n%\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates based on PovcalNet (accessed 9 March 2012), supplemented by household survey data for mostly Pacific countries, and publications of \nofficial statistics offices (Republic of Korea and Taipei,China).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     53\n\nInequality of opportunity\n\nWhat is opportunity?\nAn important development in the recent discourse on inequality is the \nfocus on opportunity. Whether the opportunity is used well must be \nconceptually separated from whether it exists in the first place. The \npolicy implications vary greatly depending upon whether the outcome \nwas the result of differences in education and health available to an \nindividual\u2014opportunity\u2014or differences in effort. A few examples will \nillustrate this point.\n\nFirst, consider two low-income individuals. One, despite having been \nprovided with a good education and health care, wastes this opportunity by \nnot exerting enough effort and enterprise, and ends up with a low income. \nThe other had poor education so that, despite being willing to work hard, \nends up with low income. The first individual suffers due to lack of effort, \nwhile the second one is limited by his or her circumstances (Roemer 1998). \nThe distinction here is that the first person could have applied more effort, \nwhile the second was constrained by a lack of opportunity.\n\nBut how do differences in opportunities arise in the first place? \nConsider two individuals with different levels of education and health \nbecause one did not have access to schools or health services. This could \nbe because of discrimination in access for social reasons, or because of \nservices not provided in certain geographic areas. Preventing individuals \nfrom enhancing their human capital to augment their earning potential\u2014\nthrough discrimination or incomplete service coverage\u2014creates \ninequality of opportunity.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the only way that unequal opportunities \narise. Consider now two individuals with the same level of education and \nhealth, and the same level of effort and enterprise, but one of whom is \nsimply not allowed to exercise that effort and enterprise to earn income. \nThis exclusion could stem from discrimination in the labor or credit \nmarket, or from gender or racial bias. Such social exclusion creates \ninequality of opportunity as well.\n\nDifferences in opportunity can therefore arise because of differences \n\nin access to public services that lead to differences in human capital \nformation (education and health), or because of differences in access to \nincome earning opportunities. However, the final outcome, in this case \nincome actually earned, depends also on the effort and enterprise applied \nby the individual. Inequality of opportunity is thus a determinant of \ninequality of outcome, but not the sole factor.\n\nInequalities due to circumstances are ethically unacceptable because \n\nit is attributable to factors over which the individual has no control. In \ncontrast, inequalities due to effort may be ethically acceptable, and may \neven be desirable to reward enterprise and thereby spur productivity \nand growth. Thus inequality of opportunity is the more important for \npolicy action.\n\n\f54    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nOf course, in practice it is not easy to separate effort from \n\nopportunity, especially in an intergenerational context (Kanbur 2010). \nThus parental income, which may be the result of their effort, nevertheless \ndetermines the opportunity of their children. Inequality of income, even \nif it is not of direct concern in this framework, will still be important as a \ndeterminant of inequality of opportunity.\n\nThis connection between inequality of income and of opportunity \nmakes it important to study both, and for policy makers to address both \ndimensions of inequality. If drivers of inequality are such that any given \ninequality of opportunity is transformed into ever greater divergences \nin income, and this income inequality translates into inequality of \nopportunity in the next generation, policy makers will need to redouble \ntheir efforts to break the link between parental income and educational \nopportunity for their children.\n\nInequalities of education and health in Asia\nAsia has made significant strides in improving average achievements in \neducation and health. However, considerable inequalities remain, as now \ndiscussed.\n\nEducation\n\nSignificant inequality in education persists in developing Asia, discussed \nhere along three dimensions: wealth, location, and gender.11\n\nInequality by wealth quintile. Inequality in the proportion of out-of-\n\nschool children between rich and poor households was, in the late \n1990s to mid-2000s, very wide in developing Asia (UNESCO 2005). For \nexample, in Bangladesh, India, Mongolia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, \nwhere the average proportion of out-of-school primary school-age \nchildren was about 20% in 1999\u20132003, children from the poorest quintile \nwere three times as likely as those from the richest quintile to be out of \nschool. In Cambodia and the Lao PDR, with an average proportion of \nabout 35%, the children from the poorest quintile were four or five times \nas likely as those from the richest quintile to be out of school.\n\nResults from more \nrecent household survey \ndata for Bhutan, Pakistan, \nand the Philippines \nshow that inequality in \neducation indicators persists \n(Figure\u00a02.3.1). In Bhutan in \n2007, the net attendance rate \nfor primary schooling for \nthe top-quintile households \n(based on per capita \nhousehold expenditure) was \nmore than two times as \nhigh as that for the bottom \nquintile. The ratio was \neven greater for secondary \nschooling at close to five \n\n2.3.1  Gaps in net attendance rates between top and bottom quintiles, 2000s\n\nInitial year\n\nFinal year\n\nQuintile ratio\n30\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\nBhutan\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nBhutan\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nBhutan\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\nPostsecondary\n\nNote: Net attendance rate refers to the percentage of children of primary (or secondary or postsecondary) school age attending primary \n(or secondary or postsecondary) school.

Relative to 2003, the \ngap widened significantly for \npostsecondary education.\nIn Pakistan in 2008, \nthe net attendance rate for \nprimary education for the \ntop quintile was about two \ntimes as high as for the \nbottom quintile. In the case \nof secondary education, the \nratio was over five, and for \npostsecondary, it was 27, \nincreasing slightly from 2002.\nIn the Philippines in \n2010, the difference in net \nattendance between the top and bottom quintiles was not \nlarge for primary education, but much larger for secondary \neducation, even more so for postsecondary education. The \nnet attendance rate for postsecondary education for the top \nquintile was about seven times as high as for the bottom \nquintile.\n\nPhilippines\n\nPakistan\n\nPrimary\n\nBhutan\n\nInequality by location. Significant inequality in education \n\nalso exists between urban and rural areas (Figure\u00a02.3.2). \nFor example, in Bhutan in 2007 and Pakistan in 2008, the \nnet attendance rate in the rural area was only two-thirds in \nprimary education, about one-half in secondary education, \nand one-third in postsecondary education of that of the urban \narea. In the Philippines in 2010, the inequality in education \nbetween rural and urban areas was much smaller in primary \nand secondary education, but significant in postsecondary \neducation: the urban rate was 1.5 times as high as the rural \nrate.\n\nInequality by gender. Education indicators by gender are \n\nmore available (partly because they are part of the MDG \nindicators). Recent data suggest that most developing Asian \ncountries have achieved or almost achieved gender parity in \nprimary education, apart from Afghanistan and Papua New \nGuinea, where gender differences remain wide\u2014the latest \navailable data (in the 2000s) indicate that the ratio of girls\u2019 \nto boys\u2019 gross enrollment in primary education stood at 0.69 \nfor Afghanistan and 0.82 for Papua New Guinea, according \nto the World Development Indicators. While the level of \ngender equality is less uniform for secondary than primary \neducation, many countries made progress (Figure\u00a02.3.3). \nGender parity has been achieved in East Asia, Central Asia, \nand most countries in Southeast Asia, but gender gaps remain \nwide in South Asia (except Sri Lanka), and some countries \nin Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is worrying to observe \na reduction in the ratio of girls\u2019 to boys\u2019 secondary school \nenrollment rates in Afghanistan, however.\n\nCentral Asia\nUzbekistan\nGeorgia\nAzerbaijan\nKyrgyz Rep.\nKazakhstan\n\nEast Asia\nPRC\nKorea, Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\n\nSouth Asia\nNepal\nPakistan\nAfghanistan\nIndia\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nCambodia\nLao PDR\nIndonesia\nThailand\nMyanmar\nPhilippines\nMalaysia\n\nThe Pacific\n\nSolomon Islands\nVanuatu\nFiji\nTonga\n\nOthers\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\nSub-Saharan Africa\nLatin America and Caribbean\nWorld\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nRatio\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The figure is based on 1991 data and the latest available data between \n2007 and 2010.\nSource: World Bank.

In contrast, the rest of South \nAsia, except Maldives, are behind most other countries in \nthe region.\n\nHealth\n\nHealth inequality within countries remains considerable in \nAsia, despite overall improvements in the average health of \ncountries\u2019 populations throughout the region.\n\nInequality by wealth quintile. The mortality rates for the \nbottom quintile are much greater than for the top quintile in \nurban areas of all the countries in Figure\u00a02.3.5. In the worst \ncase, the chance of a poor infant dying at birth is more than \n10 times that of an infant born to a rich family. This stark \npattern of inequality in infant mortality is partly related to \ndifferences in birth attendance by skilled health personnel \nbetween rich and poor households. In all countries for which \ndata are available, the poorest do much worse than the \nrichest. In the worst case, the percentage of attended births \nin the lowest quintile is less than a fifth of the number for \nthe top quintile. In some cases the situation has worsened in \nrecent years.\n\nInequality by location. Spatial disparity in health \n\nachievements in Asia is large, especially between urban and \nrural areas. WHO data12 show that in all the Asian countries \nwith available data, the infant mortality rate in rural areas \nis much higher than that in urban areas. In Cambodia, \nKazakhstan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, the difference \nincreased during the 2000s.\n\nInequality by gender. Gender is an important dimension of \n\nhealth disparity, which is clearly seen in under-five mortality \nrates (Figure\u00a02.3.6). High mortality rates for both boys and \ngirls in Afghanistan are alarming. A number of countries in \nAsia and the Pacific also record relatively high rates relative to \nthe world average.\n\nBoys\u2019 under-five mortality rates are higher than girls\u2019 in \nmost countries in the region (and in other parts of the world), \nbut girls\u2019 rates exceed those of boys\u2019 in the PRC, most of South \nAsia, and some Pacific islands. The preference for sons in these \ncountries may be a causal factor, making the opportunity \nof life itself dependent on a predetermined characteristic\u2014\ngender. The observed greater number of male than female \ninfants in these countries is not only due to the differential \ncare after birth, but also partly due to sex-selective abortion, \nthough this cannot be captured by mortality rates.\n\nCentral Asia\nTajikistan\nUzbekistan\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nArmenia\nKyrgyz Republic\nKazakhstan\n\nEast Asia\n\nKorea, Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nPRC\nMongolia\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nNepal\nBhutan\nBangladesh\nIndia\nPakistan\nMaldives\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nCambodia\nLao PDR\nIndonesia\nViet Nam\nPhilippines\nMalaysia\nThailand\nMyanmar\n\nThe Pacific\nVanuatu\nTimor-Leste\nSamoa\nFiji\nMarshall Islands\nTonga\nPalau\n\nOthers\nSub-Saharan Africa\nMiddle East and North Africa\nLatin America and Caribbean\nWorld\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nRatio\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The figure is based on the latest available data between 2001 and 2010.\nSource: World Bank.

But is there a systematic way of \nmeasuring overall inequality of human opportunity? Paes de Barros, et al. \n(2009) developed an approach that starts with the overall national rate of \naccess to a public service\u2014for example, enrollment in secondary school\u2014\nthen calculates how different the access rate is across gender, location, \nparental education, household income, and other indicators capturing \ncircumstance.13 The dissimilarity in access rates across these circumstance \ndifferences is the degree of inequality of opportunity (the D-index). The \nD-index can be interpreted as the proportion of a particular opportunity \nthat needs to be redistributed to achieve equal distribution. The inequality \nof opportunity is then used to scale down the national access rate to \nestimate the human opportunity index (HOI).\n\nThe technical methodology outlined in Box\u00a02.3.1 is applied to \nsix developing countries in Asia (Bhutan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) with a particular focus on \ninequality of opportunity that is related to basic education and \ninfrastructure. The analysis includes five outcome variables: primary \nschool attendance among children aged 6\u201311 years; secondary school \nattendance among children aged 12\u201317 years; access to safe water; access \nto electricity; and access to sanitation.\n\nThe analysis used a set of circumstance variables required to estimate \n\nthe D-index and the HOI. These circumstance variables are gender, \nlocation of household (urban or rural), education of household head, per \ncapita household expenditure, age of household head, gender of household \nhead, and household size.\n\n2.3.1  Inequality of opportunity (D-index) and the human opportunity index\n\nEstimating the D-index1 from household survey data \ninvolves the following steps:\n\u2022\t Estimating a separable logistic model on whether child j \nhas access to a given opportunity (such as education) as \na function of his or her circumstances such as parents\u2019 \neducation, family per capita income, gender, and \nlocation of residence, which are outside the control of \nthe child (Roemer 1998).\n\n\u2022\t Given the coefficient estimates, obtaining for each child \nin the sample the predicted probability of access to the \nopportunity in consideration,  \u02c6 .\n\n\u2022\t Computing\n\nD\n\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\nn\n=\n1\n\ni w\n\ni\n\n\u2212\n\u03c0\u03c0\n\u02c6|\n\n|\n\ni\n\n \n\n1\n\u03c0\n2\n\nto a given opportunity.2 Note also that \u03c0 may be called \nthe coverage rate. D measures the degree of inequality \nof opportunity that is explained by the individual\u2019s \ncircumstances. As such, (1-D) may be interpreted as equity \nof opportunity.\n\nThe human opportunity index (HOI) is then defined as\n\nHOI\n\n= \u03c0\n\n\u2212\n1( D\n\n)\n\nwhich is a composite index of the coverage rate, and equity \nof opportunity. The policy makers\u2019 objective will be to \nmaximize HOI, which can be achieved either by enhancing \ntotal opportunity (coverage) or by increasing equity of \nopportunity (more equitably distributing opportunity) or \nby increasing both coverage and equity.\n\nwhere n is the number of sample households, wi is the \npopulation weight attached to the ith sample household, \nand \u03c0 is the proportion of the population with access \n\n1 D is also referred to in the literature as the dissimilarity index, \n\nwhich is widely used in sociology.\n\n2 Note that \u03c0 is the mean of  \u02c6  across all individuals.\nSource: Paes de Barros et al. (2009).\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     59\n\nInequality of opportunity in basic education\n\nThe average coverage rate\u2014or average opportunity\u2014for primary \neducation in various years in the 2000s was the highest for Sri Lanka \n(Table 2.3.1). It also had the lowest D-index\u2014inequality of opportunity at \nclose to zero, leading to an HOI of 99.3%. The three countries of Southeast \nAsia were moving toward universal access of basic primary education. \nFor these countries, the estimated HOIs, higher than 90%, suggest that \nmore than 90% of primary education services required for universal \ncoverage are available and distributed equitably.

This is expected \nbecause the opportunity costs of sending children to schools are higher \nat the secondary than the primary level. This also implies that financial \nincentives such as conditional cash transfer programs could be more \neffective in targeting older children if the main objective is to improve \nschool enrollment.\n\nInequality of opportunity in basic infrastructure services for health\n\nBasic services, such as safe water and sanitation (e.g., flushing toilets) \nhave a direct impact on health status and overall well-being. Access to \nservices such as electricity helps households increase their productivity \nfor income generation. Studies show that a household\u2019s access to basic \ninfrastructure services is highly and significantly correlated with a lower \nprobability of being poor (for example, Balisacan 2003; Fan, Zhang, and \nZhang 2002).\n\nDeveloping Asia faces a more serious challenge in providing basic \n\ninfrastructure services than basic education services.

In Bhutan, a low HOI in access to sanitation, at 15%, is due \nto both a low average opportunity at 26.5% and high inequality of \nopportunity at 43.5%.\n\nDeterminants of inequality of opportunity\n\nThe estimation of the D-index is based on seven circumstance variables, \nincluding gender of children, area of residence, per capita household \nexpenditure, gender, age and educational attainment of household head, \nand household size. The Paes de Barros et al. (2009) decomposition is \nused to show the importance of each of these variables in contributing to \nthe inequality of opportunity. The following discussion focuses only on \nsecondary education and access to sanitation.\n\nPer capita household expenditure is the most important contributing \n\nfactor to inequality of opportunity in access to secondary education \n(Table 2.3.3). For example, it explains 54.5% of the variation in Bhutan and \n96% in Sri Lanka. Location of residence (urban and rural) of children is \nalso important (for Bhutan and Indonesia). Educational attainment of the \nhousehold head also has a significant influence for Indonesia, Pakistan, \nand Viet Nam. Another important factor is gender of children. Variables \nincluding household size, and age and gender of household head, are not \nimportant contributing factors.\n\nIn the case of access to sanitation, per capita household expenditure \n\nis a major driver of inequality of opportunity, and so is residence \nlocation (Table 2.3.4), especially in Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, \nand Viet Nam. In Indonesia and Bhutan, the largest contributing factor \nis location of residence. Educational attainment of household head is \nalso an important contributing factor in Bhutan and Pakistan. Other \ncircumstance variables play insignificant roles.\n\nIt is well known that access to safe water and sanitation is generally \nlower in rural than urban areas. This is due to the relatively higher cost of \nbuilding water and sanitation infrastructure as well as lower income levels \nin rural than urban areas. Rural areas often lack an enabling environment \nthat encourages public or private investment in water services, leading \nto low provision of those services. This is a particular problem in \nSouth Asia where there is low overall public or private investment in \ninfrastructure particularly in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan (WaterAid \n2011). Moreover, even if investments are made, poor maintenance is an \nadditional constraint.\n\nSummary\nMuch needs to be done to improve the distribution of opportunities\u2014\nas measured by disparities in access to basic services\u2014in developing \ncountries in Asia. Sri Lanka\u2019s achievements in equitably providing \nbasic education opportunities demonstrate the importance and possible \neffectiveness of public policy in achieving equity of opportunity, \nparticularly in education. The need for action is urgent because, without \nit, inequality of opportunity will be magnified into greater and greater \ninequality of outcome, which will then continue the cycle of inequality of \nopportunity and outcome for the next generation.\n\n\f62    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nWhat drives inequality in \ndeveloping Asia?\n\nDrivers and channels of inequality\nTechnological progress, globalization, and market-oriented reform have \nbeen the key drivers of developing Asia\u2019s rapid growth in the last 2 \ndecades\u2014but they also had huge distributional consequences. Together, \nthey have favored skilled rather than unskilled labor, capital rather than \nlabor, and urban and coastal areas rather than rural and inland regions. \nThese changes can explain many of the movements in inequality in many \nregional countries.\n\nTechnological change can impact on the distribution of income among \n\ndifferent factors of production. If it favors skilled labor (more educated \nor more experienced) over unskilled labor by increasing its relative \nproductivity, we could expect the skill premium\u2014the ratio of skilled to \nunskilled wages\u2014to go up, which would most likely increase income \ninequality. Technological change could also affect the distribution of \nincome between labor and capital. If it is biased in favor of capital, it \ncould increase inequality since capital incomes, in general, are less equally \ndistributed and accrue to the rich more than to the poor.\n\nIn a similar fashion, globalization can affect income distribution. \nTrade integration, for example, could change relative demand for and \nhence relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers. It could also \naffect income distribution between capital and labor because capital \nand skills often work together due to their complementarity. Financial \nintegration could broaden access to finance by the poor\u2014but could also \nincrease the risk of financial crises and hurt the poor more than the rich. \nGlobalization can magnify the distributional impact of technological \nprogress.\n\nA large literature has emerged in recent years attempting to \n\nunderstand the impacts of trade integration, financial integration, and \ntechnological change on income distribution (Box\u00a02.4.1), though it has yet \nto provide a clear-cut answer. One complication is that there are several, \nclosely linked, confounding factors.14\n\nMarket-oriented reform is an important driver of growth, but can \nalso have significant distributional consequences. Trade policy reform is \noften part of the driving forces of globalization. Labor market reforms \ncan change the bargaining position of labor vis-\u00e0-vis capital owners, \nimpacting on wage rates and income distribution between labor and \ncapital. Economic transition from a command to a market economy can \nimprove efficiency and make returns to assets more closely reflective of \nresource scarcity, which can affect income distribution among different \nproductive assets in a significant way.\n\nMoreover, the impacts of the three drivers of growth\u2014technological \n\nprogress, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014can be \n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     63\n\n2.4.1  Globalization and inequality\n\nThere is general consensus among researchers and policy \nmakers that Asia\u2019s stellar growth performance could not \nhave been achieved without its embrace of globalization. \nAll countries in Asia are committed to greater integration \nwith the global economy in coming decades. How \ndoes greater openness of an economy influence income \ninequality? Economic analysis does not provide a clear \nanswer.\n\nThe simplest trade theory predicts that for countries \n\nwith abundant unskilled labor, opening the economy \nshould raise the wages of unskilled labor and depress the \nwages for skilled workers and returns to capital, as the \ncountry specializes in low-skill production, increasing \nequality (Stolper and Samuelson 1941). The historical \n\nEmpirical studies on globalization and inequality\n\nevidence on \u201cgrowth with equity\u201d from the Republic of \nKorea; Singapore; and Taipei,China seems to support this \nthesis (Wood 1999).\n\nThe recent evidence on trade, openness, and inequality, \n\nhowever, is mixed, especially for economies that are not \nreadily characterized as being abundant in unskilled labor, \nare resource rich, or have production structures not easily \ncaptured by the simple model. The channels between \nmarket opening and inequality are complex, and the quest \nfor clarity in results remains elusive (Box\u00a0table).\n\nEmpirically, a number of variables that affect inequality \n\ncan confound the effect of trade openness on inequality, \nmost notably financial integration, and skill-biased \ntechnological change and rising skill premiums. \n\nDecrease\n\nNo effect\n\nTrade liberalization\n\nInconclusive or varying\n\nMechanism and net effect on inequality\n\nSample or data\n\nLiterature \n\nFinancial integration can spur growth and benefit the poor\n\nMeta-survey \n\nDemirguc-Kunt and \n\nLevine (2007)\n\nSurvey of results for Mexico, Colombia, \n\nGoldberg and Pavcnik \n\nBrazil, Chile (1990s)\n\n(2007)\n\nTrade liberalization may decrease or increase wage differentials\n\nSurvey for Latin America and East Asia \n\nWood (1999)\n\nFinancial integration may increase the poor\u2019s access to finance, but gains \nmay be captured by elite: Inequality increases at low income levels; \ndecreases as income rises\n\n(1960\u22121970s, 1980s\u22121990s)\n\nMeta-survey \n\nClaessens and Perotti \n\n(2007)\n\nTrade openness benefits the rich more than the poor in very poor \n\nHousehold surveys, World Income \n\nMilanovic (2005)\n\ncountries; it benefits the poor and middle class more as income rises.\n\nDistribution (WYD) database (1988, \n1993, 1998)\n\nFinancial globalization increases Gini coefficient by about 0.04; trade \n\nGlobal dataset (1980s\u22122000s)\n\nIMF (2007)\n\nglobalization decreases Gini coefficient by about 0.05\n\nIncrease\n\ninequality\n\nFDI increases demand for high-skilled workers\n\n119 countries (1993\u22122004) from World \n\nChoi (2006)\n\nFDI increases demand for skilled workers, explains 11% of wage \n\n101 manufacturing industries in UK \n\nTaylor and Driffield \n\nDevelopment Indicators 2004\n\n(1983\u22121992)\n\n(2005)\n\n(1997)\n\nFDI increases demand for high-skilled workers, and thus explains 50% of \n\nData on foreign assembly plants in \n\nFeenstra and Hanson \n\nthe increase in share of skilled labor\n\nMexico (1975\u22121988)\n\nTrade induces skill-intensification in the traded manufacturing sector, \n\nMicro-level data from approximately \n\nCragg and Epelbaum \n\nresulting in a 0.1% change in wage premium\n\n1\u00a0million workers in Mexico (1987\u22121993)\n\n(1996)\n\nTrade index explains 10\u201312% of wage gap between workers with \n\ndifferent schooling; financial index explains 12\u201333% of the gap; capital \naccount index explains 25\u201330%\n\nFinancial integration may lead to crises which hurt the poor: poverty \nincidence increased from 1997 to 1998 in Indonesia by 11\u201319.9%; \nRepublic of Korea, 2.6\u20137.3%; Malaysia, 8.2\u201310.4%; Thailand, 9.8\u201312.9%\n\nHousehold surveys from 18 Latin \nAmerican countries (1977\u22121998)\n\nBehrman, Birdsall, and \n\nSz\u00e9kely (2003)\n\nCountry data for Indonesia, Republic \nof Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and \nsome Latin American countries (Asian \nfinancial crisis period)\n\nFallon and Lucas (2002)\n\nFinancial integration may lead to crises that hurt the poor; \n\nMacroeconomic data on various \n\nAgenor (2002)\n\nmacroeconomic volatility increases poverty index by about 0.35 to \n0.40\n\ncountries (World Bank Live Database) \n(1980s\u22121990s)\n\nSource: ADB staff compilation.\n\n\f64    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\ngeographically uneven, leading to a further channel of changing \nincome distribution: spatial inequality. This is because new economic \nopportunities, released by these drivers, are often most easily seized by \nlocations closer to the existing trade routes\u2014coastal areas, for example, \nnot inland ones\u2014and areas with better public infrastructure\u2014such \nas urban locations, not rural areas. This leads to shifts in income \ndistribution among different geographic locations.\n\nComplicating the analysis is that the impacts of the three drivers \nare intertwined. Although they can be disentangled conceptually, it \nis difficult to do so empirically. In the next three sections, therefore, \ninstead of trying to isolate their impacts, we will look at three channels \nthrough which the three drivers affect income inequality: shifts in income \ndistribution between skilled and unskilled labor, by examining returns \nto human capital and the skill premium; between labor and capital, \nby analyzing labor and capital income shares; and between different \nlocations, by estimating spatial inequality. This approach also facilitates \ndiscussions of policy responses.\n\nYet those individuals and groups excluded from the market because \nof individual circumstances beyond their control or discrimination would \ncertainly not benefit from these opportunities\u2014inequality of opportunity \nmagnifies the distributional consequences of the three drivers. One such \ngroup is women\u2014discussed in the final section.\n\nIncreasing skill premiums\nInequality of education is a major contributor to inequality of \nincome. There is significant global evidence that the rates of return to \nprogressively higher levels of education have been trending upward in \nrecent years. In OECD countries, for instance, those who do not complete \nan upper secondary education could earn an average of 23% less than \ntheir counterparts who do. A person with a tertiary education can \nexpect to earn over 50% more than a person with an upper secondary or \npostsecondary non-tertiary education (OECD 2011b).\n\nIn Asia, empirical studies find that the returns to education increase \n\nwith educational attainment and that the relationship has been getting \nsteeper over time. An ADB study (2007b) finds that from the mid-1990s \nto mid-2000s, real wages grew much faster for wage earners with tertiary \nor higher education than for those with lower educational attainment in \nIndia and the Philippines, leading to wider wage differentials. \n\nThe same study also finds that education is the single most important \n\nfactor among those variables that were included in analyzing wage \ninequality. In the case of India, the Gini coefficient of wages increased \nfrom 40.5 in 1993 to 47.2 in 2004. Half the increase can be explained \nby individual characteristics. Of this explained increase, about 50% is \naccounted for by education.\n\nMany other studies have provided direct or indirect evidence of rising \n\nskill/education premiums in developing Asia. Son (2010) finds that in \nthe Philippines education increases individuals\u2019 employability. In 2003, \nthe probability of being employed was 57% for individuals with tertiary \neducation, and 34% for those with primary education only. This difference \nin employability increased from 1997 to 2003. Further, the difference in \n\n\femployability due to differences in educational attainment was more \npronounced among poorer households.\n\nA study on India, the Philippines, and Thailand finds that the rate of \n\nreturn to college education rose relative to that of secondary education \nbetween the mid-1990s and mid-2000s (Mehta et al. 2011). This rise was \nrelated to the expansion of high-skill services jobs: employing only 7\u201311% \nof the labor force, they contributed 40\u201370% of the rate of return to college \neducation.\n\nA more recent study (World Bank 2012a) reports that the \n\ntertiary education premium15 stood at 90% for Cambodia \n(2007), 60% for the PRC (2005), 84% for Indonesia (2007), 70% \nfor Mongolia (2007), 70% for the Philippines (2006), 120% for \nThailand (2004), and 55% for Viet Nam (2006). In Cambodia, \nthe PRC, Mongolia, and Viet Nam the premium increased in \nrecent years across sectors. In Indonesia, the tertiary education \npremium increased in the manufacturing sector, and in the \nPhilippines, it increased in the services sector.\n\nHousehold survey data help reveal patterns of income \ninequality due to educational attainment (in this case, of the \nhousehold head) (Figure\u00a02.4.1). First, education inequality \nalmost always accounts for more than 20% of total income \ninequality. Second, the share of total income inequality \nexplained by educational inequality has by and large been \non the increase. The share of inequality accounted for by \ndifferences in educational attainment increased in all the \ncountries during the periods looked at, with the increase most \nsignificant in the PRC, from 8.1% in 1995 to 26.5% in 2007.\n\nAs in the rest of the world, developing Asia is facing strong \nupward pressure on the wage gap between skilled and unskilled \nlabor. Is this because of skill-biased technological progress? \nThere are empirical difficulties in isolating this factor \nbecause the wage premium depends on both demand- and \nsupply-side factors. Unsurprisingly, analysts have come down on \nboth sides of the explanation.16 To the extent that skill-biased \ntechnological change happens, its impact can be transmitted \nthrough globalization. It is unlikely that policy makers can \nreverse this trend, nor should they want to, since technological \nprogress is delivering higher levels of productivity and growth \nin the economy. The answer, rather, is to address inequality in \nhuman capital itself.\n\nBhutan\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\n1993\n2009/10\n\n2003\n2007\n\n1995\n2007\n\n1990\n2010\n\n2002\n2008\n\n1994\n2009\n\n1995\n2005\n\n2008\n\nConfronting rising inequality in Asia     65\n\n2.4.1  Income inequality decomposition by educational \nattainment of household head\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nShare of between-group inequality, %\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Estimates are based on per capita expenditure in nominal terms, except \nfor the PRC which is based on income.

A number \nof contributing factors have been identified. \n\nThe first is that technological change, especially connected \n\nwith improvements in information and communications \ntechnologies, has raised the productivity of and return to \ncapital relative to labor. The second is the decrease in the \nbargaining power of labor, due to changing labor market \npolicies and declining union membership in these countries. \nThe third is increased globalization and trade openness, that \nled to migration of relatively more labor-intensive sectors from \nadvanced economies to emerging economies\u2014with the sectors \nremaining in the advanced economies relatively less labor \nintensive and having a lower average share of labor income \n(Jacobson and Occhino 2012; Arpaia, Perez, and Pichelmann \n2009). It has also been noted that globalization and trade \nopenness increase the elasticity of labor demand, which also \nweakens labor\u2019s bargaining position (Rodrik 1997; Harrison \n2002).\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that Asia is following this \ntrend\u2014all the economies in Figure\u00a02.4.3 saw declines in labor \nincome shares during the mid-1990s to mid-2000s.\n\nWhat are the causes of these declines? Technological \nprogress in the region appears to have been labor-saving and \ncapital-using. Partly, this can be explained by a high level of \ncapital accumulation in many Asian countries (Felipe 2009; \nADB forthcoming). As a result, the wage employment elasticity \nof growth17 has been on the decline in many countries in recent \nyears (Figure\u00a02.4.4)\u2014in the PRC from 0.44 in 1991\u20132001 to 0.28 \nin 2001\u20132011 and in India from 0.53 to 0.41, for example. This \ndecline means that each percentage of employment growth \nnow requires a higher percentage of output growth than in the \npast\u2014a phenomenon sometimes referred to as \u201cjobless growth.\u201d\n\nA declining employment elasticity of growth implies \n\nincreases in labor productivity. Annual growth of manufacturing \nlabor productivity in 2000\u20132008 reached 6.7% in the PRC, \n5.5% in Malaysia, and was in the range of 3\u20134% in Indonesia, \nPakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam (APO 2011).\nThat labor productivity is increasing but the labor income \n\nSri Lanka\n\nPRC\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nBangladesh\n\nPhilippines\n\nCambodia\n\nPakistan\n\nViet Nam\n\nWorld\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nElasticity\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Simple average for world and developing Asia.\nSource: International Labour Organization. 2011.

Its importance \nhas even increased in some.\n\nThe possibility of rising inequality due to urbanization \nas part of the development process was first pointed out by \nKuznets (1955). The particular mechanisms that he highlighted \nin his contribution (Box\u00a02.4.3) starts with a two-sector model \nwith the population divided between a low mean income, low \ninequality sector (rural/agriculture) and a high mean income, \nhigh inequality sector (urban/industrial). In this model, the \ndrivers of inequality are changes in inequality within the two \nsectors, a widening of the gap between average incomes in the \ntwo sectors, and a shift of population from agriculture in the \nrural sector to industry in the urban sector.\n\nInequality changes within the two sectors will most likely be \n\naffected by the same factors discussed in the previous sections, \nin particular the widening wage premium for skills, and the \nregional disparity (to be discussed below). To the extent that the \nurban labor force has a higher level of human capital than the \nrural labor force, this factor would also tend to widen the rural\u2013\nurban gap in average incomes. But perhaps the strongest driver \nof that gap is the cumulative force of agglomeration economies \nand its impact on productivity (de Groot, Poot, and Smit 2008). \nFor whatever combination of reasons, the rural\u2013urban income \ngap in Asia has been widening in the last 2\u00a0decades, especially \nin the PRC (Figure\u00a02.4.8).\n\nThus the first two\u2014change in inequality within the two \n\nsectors and a widening of the gap in the average income \nbetween the two sectors\u2014are likely to put upward pressure on \ninequality in Asian countries. \n\nWhat about the third factor? As is well known, urbanization \n\nin Asia is rapid. Kuznets explored this with the aid of a \nnumerical example (Box\u00a02.4.3), which showed increasing \ninequality to start with as urbanization begins, followed by \na decrease at the later stages. Anand and Kanbur (1993) show \nthat if there is no inequality within the two sectors, so that the \nonly difference between them is because of the higher income \nin the urban area, then inequality will indeed follow an inverse \nU\u00a0shape, so that this driver will tend to raise inequality in the \nearly stages of urbanization. If, further, urban inequality is \nhigher than rural inequality, this effect will be reenforced. These \nsuggest that the rural\u2013urban structural divide, present in all \ndeveloping Asia, and the process of urbanization, which all Asia \nis going through, are powerful drivers of overall inequality.\n\n2.4.6  Wage employment elasticity and change in Gini \ncoefficient, Asia and the Pacific, 1991\u20132011 \n\nChange in Gini coefficient \n\ny = -13.385x + 7.263\nR\u00b2 = 0.266\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nWage employment elasticity\n\nSource: ADB estimates using International Labour Organisation, Trends \nEconometric Models, October 2011 and PovcalNet (accessed 9 March 2012), \nsupplemented by household survey data (most Pacific countries and India), and \npublications of national statistics offices (Republic of Korea).\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.4.7  Income inequality decomposition by location,  \nurban/rural \n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n1993\n2009/10\n\nBhutan\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\n2003\n2007\n\n1990\n2008\n\n1990\n2010\n\n2002\n2008\n\n1991\n2009\n\n2007\n2010\n\nViet Nam\n\n2008\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nShare of between-group inequality, %\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Estimates are based on per capita expenditure in nominal terms. \nDecomposition is based on the GE(0) inequality measure.\nSource: ADB estimates using household survey data.\nClick here for figure data\n\n2.4.8  Urban\u2013rural income gaps in selected Asian \neconomies, 1990\u20132010 \n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nRatio\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n1990s\n\nMid-1990s\n\n2000s\n\nMid-2000s\n\n2010\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Figures are for the closest available year.

The process was \nset out by Kuznets (1955, pp.\u00a012\u221215) in his classic paper as \nfollows:\n\nThe basic assumptions used throughout are that the per \ncapita income of sector B (nonagricultural) is always \nhigher than that of sector A; that the proportion of sector \nA in the total population declines; and that the inequality \nof the income distribution within sector A may be as \nwide as that within sector B but not wider. With the \nassumptions concerning three sets of factors\u2014intersector \ndifferences in per capita income, intrasector distributions, \nand sector weights\u2014varying within the limitations just \nindicated, the following conclusions are suggested: .... [E]\nven if the differential in per capita income between the two \nsectors remains constant and the intrasector distributions \nare identical for the two sectors, the mere shift in the \nproportions of populations produces slight but significant \nchanges in the distribution for the country as a whole. In \ngeneral, as the proportion of A drifts from 0.8 downwards, \nthe range tends first to widen and then to diminish.\n\nThis is the famous Kuznets inverted-U in the original: \n\n\u201cthe range tends to first widen and then to diminish.\u201d\n\nEvidence on the Kuznets inverted-U is mixed. Kuznets \n\nhimself presented evidence for his hypothesis from the \nUnited Kingdom, the US, and some other developed \neconomies in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th \ncentury. During this period, in fact, these economies \n\nwere already on the downward part of the inverse-U. \nThe possibility of a Kuznets inverse-U for developing \neconomies was tested 2 decades later, by Ahluwalia \n(1976), who found support for it using cross-sectional \ndata. However, subsequent rigorous econometric testing, \nwith better techniques and better data, did not support \nthe inverse-U in cross-country data (Anand and Kanbur \n1993).\n\nFocusing on the middle- and low middle-income \ncountries, Cornia, Addison and Kiiski (2004) find that, \nout of 34 developing countries for which they have several \nobservations between the 1950s and the mid-1990s, \ninequality is higher in the terminal period for 15 of them, \nequal for 14 and lower for 5. When data are available, a \nU-shape is observed in a number of cases where inequality \nis found to be increasing when comparing the terminal \nand the initial years. \n\nBarro (2008), on the other hand, seems to find support \n\nfor the Kuznets inverted-U in the cross-sectional data, \nalthough he recognizes that many factors are important in \nproviding a full explanation. \n\nThus the scant empirical evidence validating Kuznets \n\nhypothesis calls for a multifactor analysis, recognizing \nthat the contributions of the various factors explaining \ngrowth and inequality may change over time. There is no \nsingle overarching driver of inequality. Rather, we need to \nexplore a number of mechanisms in detail.\n\nSources: Kanbur (2011); Aizenmann et al. (forthcoming); Anand and \nKanbur (1993).\n\nRegional inequality\n\nRegional inequality has also been a key contributor to total \ninequality in many Asian countries, particularly in the PRC and \nIndia (Figure\u00a02.4.9). Notably for the PRC, in 1990\u20132003 regional \ninequality increased more or less concurrently with overall \ninequality.\n\nIn the PRC, there appears to be a general consensus \nthat increased openness contributed to sharpening income \ndisparities between coastal and interior regions. As Lin (2005)\nnotes, an important feature of that country\u2019s global integration \nis the depth of concentration of international trade along the \neast coast\u2014which has far lower transport costs to the country\u2019s \nmajor markets such as Hong Kong, China; Europe; Japan; and \nthe United States.20 The recent decline has been partly attributed \nto the government\u2019s Great Western Development Strategy (Fan, \nKanbur, and Zhang 2011).\n\nIn India, coastal states have also fared better than inland states, \n\nalthough here a set of compounding factors such as initial level of \n\n2.4.9  Inequalities in provincial per capita incomes, 1990\u2013\n2010, selected Asian economies\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nPhilippines\n\nGini coefficient\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n1990\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n10\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Gini coefficients are weighted by group population.\nSource: ADB estimates using province-level data for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and the Philippines from CEIC database (accessed 5 March 2012) and \nIndia\u2019s Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (accessed 5\u00a0March \n2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f2.4.1o  Income inequality decomposition, province/region \n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\nShare of between-group inequality, %\n\n25\n\n15\n\n20\n\n30\n\n35\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Estimates are based on per capita expenditure in nominal terms. \nDecomposition is based on the GE(0) inequality measure. \nSource: ADB estimates using household survey data.\nClick here for figure data\n\n70    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nhuman capital and public infrastructure is also important (Kanbur, \nGajwani, and Zhang 2007). New private-sector industrial \ninvestments typically take place in existing industrial and \ncoastal districts to reduce costs, and overall investments have \nbecome more concentrated.\n\nMore generally, the interplay between market-oriented \nreforms and economies of agglomeration appear to have given \ncertain regions within countries an edge when it comes to \neconomic growth. Indeed, this interplay has been linked to \nincreasing inequality in Southeast Asia and East Asia\u2019s middle-\nincome economies (Gill and Kharas 2007). Figure\u00a02.4.10 \nprovides decomposition results for regional inequality in \nselected Asian countries.

These divides \nare important in themselves, and because they account for a significant \nproportion of observed inequality in Asian countries. The driver of \ninequality in the spatial dimension is the interaction between new \nopportunities through trade, technology, and market-oriented reform, \ninteracting with the structure of geography and infrastructure.\n\nThe rise in spatial inequality is not a reason to reverse openness and \ntechnological progress, or stop the reform process, but rather to reorient \ninfrastructure investment to lagging regions, and to remove barriers to \nmigration to the fast-growing regions.\n\n2.4.11  Combined contribution of spatial inequality to overall inequality, selected Asian countries \n\nSimilarly, the process \nof urbanization cannot be \nreversed\u2014nor should it \nbe\u2014because it brings with it \nhigher national productivity \nand growth.

Social \nexclusion therefore magnifies the distributional impact of globalization, \ntechnological progress, and market-oriented reform. In this section, we \nconsider the issue of gender inequality.\n\nEconomic growth and gender inequality\n\nThe effect of economic growth on gender inequality in labor markets \nis ambiguous. Growth can narrow gender inequality through a \nnumber of channels, including the demise of traditional structures \nthat reinforce human capital differences between men and women, the \nrising opportunity cost of women\u2019s time outside of the labor force, the \nstrengthening of women\u2019s economic and property rights, technological \nprogress, and the introduction of labor-saving consumer durables.\n\nYet economic growth does not necessarily mean inequality will \ndecline, especially if unpaid work burdens, biased laws, differential \naccess to resources, and social norms continue to constrain women in \ntheir ability to take advantage of new, well-paid jobs. A growing number \nof empirical studies have indicated that economic growth \nmay improve or worsen gender inequality depending on the \ngendered indicator under consideration.\n\nIncreased openness to trade and FDI often brings \n\nincreased access to employment for women in export-oriented \nlabor-intensive manufacturing. At issue is the extent to \nwhich women have actually benefited from international \ntrade and foreign investment through new paid employment \nopportunities. Some argue that gains in women\u2019s employment \nhave been accompanied by precarious working conditions \nand an expansion of informal-sector jobs that lack basic \nlegal and social protections and are not subject to formal \neconomic regulations. As firms face pressure in international \nmarkets to keep production costs low, the jobs they offer \nbecome increasingly insecure; employment is often temporary, \ncasual, and flexible, characterized by poor working conditions \n(Bener\u00eda 2007).\n\nAnother concern is low wages for women. Economic growth \n\ngenerated through export promotion may put downward \npressure on the wages of workers in the export sector and, to \nthe extent that women workers account for a high proportion of \nemployment, contribute to wider gender wage gaps. Supporting \nthis argument, Berik, Rodgers, and Zveglich (2004) used data \nfor Taipei,China and the Republic of Korea and found that \nincreasing competition from international trade is associated \nwith larger wage gaps between men and women. Because \nthe analysis controlled for gender differences in productivity \ncharacteristics, the widening wage gap was interpreted as a sign \nof increased wage discrimination.\n\nYet others have argued that jobs in the export sector offer \n\nbetter pay than the alternatives for women workers, and the \nevaluation of wages in the export sector ought to consider \nwages in alternative jobs, wages expressed in hourly terms, and \nnonwage working conditions (Kabeer 2004).\n\nCentral Asia\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\nArmenia\nKyrgyz Republic\nGeorgia\nTajikistan\nKazakhstan\nAzerbaijan\n\nEast Asia\nRepublic of Korea\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\nPRC\n\nSouth Asia\n\nAfghanistan\nPakistan\nIndia\nSri Lanka\nBangladesh\nMaldives\nBhutan\nNepal\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nMalaysia\nIndonesia\nPhilippines\nBrunei Darussalam\nSingapore\nThailand\nViet Nam\nMyanmar\nCambodia\nLao PDR\n\nThe Pacific\nFiji\nTimor-Leste\nSamoa\nSolomon Islands\nVanuatu\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n%\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Labor force participation rate refers to age groups 15 and over.\nSource: International Labour Organization.

Several studies \nhave shown that in middle- and higher-income economies, technological \nimprovements have led to displacement of women from low-paying \njobs in import-competing sectors. In particular, Anker (1998) provided \nevidence that women in middle- and higher-income economies tend to \ncluster in manufacturing industries that have begun to upgrade their \ntechnologies, reduce the size of their workforce, and move production to \nlower-wage countries.\n\nIn the case of Taipei,China, technological upgrading and rising \n\ncapital intensity of export-oriented manufacturing after 1980 was \nlinked to a relative decline in employment opportunities for women \n(Berik 2000). Women in lower-income countries can also experience \njob displacement when technological change makes traditional female \njobs redundant and when women face barriers to training for new jobs \n(Jhabvala and Sinha 2002).\n\nWomen\u2019s labor force participation\n\nA specific dimension of opportunity is participation in the labor market. \nThis generates income through the use of what is often poor women\u2019s \nonly asset, their labor. Labor force participation is much lower for women \nthan for men in most Asia\u2013Pacific countries, averaging around 0.7 \n(Figure\u00a02.4.12 above), with wide variations (Afghanistan the lowest, the \nLao PDR the highest).\n\nWhat are the determinants of women\u2019s labor force participation? At \na macro level, a stylized fact is that economic development and women\u2019s \nparticipation in the formal labor market exhibit a fairly \npredictable and well-documented relationship. When countries \nbegin to industrialize, female labor force participation falls as \nthe household farm model becomes less common and more \nwomen engage exclusively in nonmarket activities such as child \ncare and housework. In more advanced economies, female \nparticipation rates begin to rise again as growing numbers \nof women engage in market-based economic activity, often \nin combination with raising children. This trend generates a \nU-shaped function that fits time-series and cross-sectional data \nfor a number of countries at different stages of development \n(Goldin 1994; Mammen and Paxson 2000; Tam 2011). The \npattern across Asia\u2013Pacific countries is consistent with this \nU-shaped relationship (Figure\u00a02.4.13).\n\nNEP\n\nTIM\n\nThe micro evidence can uncover various forces behind \nwomen\u2019s engagement in the labor market. An empirical study, \nbased on Demographic and Health Survey data from nine \nAsian countries spanning 2005\u20132009 estimated the likelihood \nof a woman engaging in employment, conditional on the full \nset of personal and household characteristics (Rodgers and \nZveglich forthcoming).\n\nThe results show that household wealth, in particular, \n\ncan have different effects in different countries, and the \nresults also point to important interactions between women\u2019s \nrole as caregivers to young children and their employment \ndecisions. In every country, married women are less likely \n\n2.4.13  Women\u2019s labor force participation rates and per \ncapita GDP in Asia, 2010\n\nCAM\n\nLAO\n\nVIE\n\nPNG\n\nTAJ\n\nVAN\nMON\n\nBAN\n\nKGZ\n\nPRC\n\nBHU\n\nTHA\n\nKAZ\n\nAZE\n\nMLD\n\nINO\n\nGEO\n\nARM\n\nSAM\n\nTKM\n\nMAL\n\nSOL\n\nUZB\n\nPHI\n\nFIJ\n\nIND\n\nPAK\n\nSRI\n\nAUS\n\nSIN\n\n60\n\nNZL\n\nJPN\n\nBRU\nHKG\n\nKOR\n\n80\n\n40\n\n20\n\nF\ne\nm\na\ne\n\nl\n\n \nl\n\n \n\na\nb\no\nr\n \nf\no\nr\nc\ne\np\na\nr\nt\ni\nc\ni\np\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \n(\n\n%\n\n)\n\n9.0\n\n7.0\n\n11.0\n\n10.0\n\n8.0\nLn GDP per capita (2005 PPP$)\nARM\u00a0=\u00a0Armenia; AUS\u00a0=\u00a0Australia; AZE\u00a0=\u00a0Azerbaijan; BAN\u00a0=\u00a0Bangladesh; \nBHU\u00a0=\u00a0Bhutan; BRU\u00a0=\u00a0Brunei Darussalam; CAM\u00a0=\u00a0Cambodia; PRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; FIJ\u00a0=\u00a0Fiji; GEO\u00a0=\u00a0Georgia; HKG\u00a0=\u00a0Hong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China; \nIND\u00a0=\u00a0India; INO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia; JPN\u00a0=\u00a0Japan; KAZ\u00a0=\u00a0Kazakhstan; KOR\u00a0=\u00a0Rep. \nof Korea; KGZ\u00a0=\u00a0Kyrgyz Republic; LAO\u00a0=\u00a0Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; \nMAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia; MLD\u00a0=\u00a0Maldives; MON\u00a0=\u00a0Mongolia; NEP\u00a0=\u00a0Nepal; \nNZL\u00a0=\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand; PAK\u00a0=\u00a0Pakistan; PHI\u00a0=\u00a0Philippines; PNG\u00a0=\u00a0Papua New \nGuinea; SAM\u00a0=\u00a0Samoa; SIN\u00a0=\u00a0Singapore; SOL\u00a0=\u00a0Solomon Islands; SRI\u00a0=\u00a0Sri Lanka; \nTAJ\u00a0=\u00a0Tajikistan; THA\u00a0=\u00a0Thailand; TIM\u00a0=\u00a0Timor-Leste; TKM\u00a0=\u00a0Turkmenistan; \nUZB\u00a0=\u00a0Uzbekistan; VAN\u00a0=\u00a0Vanuatu; VIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet Nam.\nNote: All data are for 2010 or the closest year available. \nSources: International Labour Organization.

And spatial disparities are becoming \nmore acute: locations with superior infrastructure, market access, and \nscale economies\u2014such as urban centers and coastal areas\u2014are better \nable to benefit from changing circumstances. Empirical evidence is \nconsistent with these arguments. Inequality of opportunity magnifies the \ndistributional consequences of these driving factors.\n\n\f74    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nConfronting rising inequality: \nPolicy options\n\nSummary of key findings\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s rapid growth in recent decades has led to a significant \nreduction in extreme poverty, but it has also been accompanied by rising \ninequality in many countries. Income inequality has increased in 11 out \nof the 28 countries with comparable data, the 11 accounting for 82% of \nthe total population. In many countries, income inequality coexists with \nnon-income inequality in the form of unequal access to education, health, \nand basic services among different population groups classified by gender, \nlocation, and income. Asia\u2019s rising inequality contrasts with the \u201cgrowth \nwith equity\u201d story that characterized the transformation of the newly \nindustrialized economies in the 1960s and 1970s, and with recent trends \nin other parts of the developing world, in particular Latin America, where \nincome inequality has been on the decline since the 1990s.\n\nTechnological change, globalization, and market-oriented reform\u2014\nthe main drivers of Asia\u2019s rapid economic growth\u2014are the basic driving \nforces behind the rising inequality in Asia. Working together, these have \nsignificantly impacted on inequality through a number of channels, in \nparticular:\n\u2022\t\n\nIncreasing skill premiums and returns to human capital. The \nemergence of vast new economic opportunities, unleashed by \ntrade and financial integration, technological progress, and \nmarket-oriented reform, has increased returns to human capital \nand the skill premium, with individuals having higher educational \nattainment and skill endowment able to benefit more from the \nnew opportunities. Our analysis shows that, in many countries, as \nhigh as 25\u201335% of the total income inequality can be explained by \ninterperson differences in human capital and skill endowments.\n\u2022\t Falling labor income shares. As in many countries in other parts of \nthe world, technological progress appears to have favored capital \nover labor. The abundance of labor relative to capital, which \ndepresses wage rates, is also a contributing factor to the declining \nlabor income share in developing Asia. Since capital is less equally \ndistributed, this has contributed to rising inequality.\nIncreasing spatial inequality. Some regions, especially urban and \ncoastal areas, are better able to respond to the new opportunities \nbecause of their advantages in infrastructure and market access, as \nwell as agglomeration economies from a self-perpetuating process \nof increasing concentration. The process of urbanization reinforces \nthe inequality effects of agglomeration. Our analysis shows that \nin many Asian countries about 30\u201350% of income inequality is \naccounted for by spatial inequality due to uneven growth.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     75\n\nThe impact of the basic driving forces of inequality has been \n\ncompounded by various forms of unequal access to opportunity\u2014to earn \nincome from labor and to build human capital\u2014caused by institutional \nweaknesses, market distortions and failures, and social exclusion.\n\nThe basic driving forces of inequality cannot\u2014and should not\u2014be \n\nreversed. They generate productivity growth, which underpins Asia\u2019s \npoverty reduction, betterment of quality of life, and prosperity. However, \nhigh inequality could undermine social cohesion, political stability, \nand sustainability of growth, and a divided and highly unequal nation \ncannot be prosperous, as shown by international experience. Rising \ninequality could also lead to demands for populist measures that would \nbe detrimental to efficiency and growth.\n\nHow should Asian governments respond to the rising inequality? Via \nthree sets of policy measures. These measures cannot eliminate inequality, \nbut will go a long way toward reducing it and, at the same time, not \nendanger development or hurt growth.\n\n\u2022\t Efficient fiscal policy. Measures include increasing spending \n\non education and health, especially for the poorer; developing \nbetter targeted social protection schemes, including conditional \ncash transfers that target income to the poorest but also \nincentivize the building of human capital; and greater revenue \nmobilization through broadening the tax base and improving tax \nadministration, and switching spending from inefficient general \nsubsidies to targeted transfers.\nInterventions to address lagging regions. Measures include \nimproving regional connectivity; developing new growth poles \nin lagging regions; strengthening fiscal transfers for greater \ninvestment in human capital and better access to public services \nin lagging regions; and removing barriers to migration from poor \nto more prosperous areas.\n\n\u2022\t\n\n\u2022\t More employment-friendly growth. Policies include facilitating \nstructural transformation and maintaining a balanced sectoral \ncomposition of growth between manufacturing, services, and \nagriculture; supporting the development of small and medium-\nsized enterprises; removing factor market distortions that favor \ncapital over labor; strengthening labor market institutions; and \nintroducing public employment schemes as a temporary bridge to \naddress pockets of unemployment and underemployment.\n\nEfficient fiscal policy\nFiscal policy is a key part of the policy responses to rising inequality \nin Asia. Both government spending and taxation can affect inequality. \nAsian governments have ample room to maneuver in using fiscal policy \nto address the challenge of rising inequality, depending on individual \ncountry circumstances. This could involve increasing human capital \ninvestment and social protection provision\u2014financing the increased \nspending on these through greater and more equitable revenue \nmobilization\u2014and switching spending on inefficient general price \nsubsidies (as for fuel) to targeted transfers.\n\n\f76    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nFiscal spending\n\nA large part of inequality in developing Asia is explained by differences \nin individual attainments in education and human capital. Returns \nto human capital are largely driven by the market, and it may not be \nefficient and or even desirable for governments to try to alter them. \nHowever, it is efficient and desirable for governments to reduce inequality \nin the distribution of human capital in the population, by making \npublic investments in education and health and by ensuring that all \nmembers of society have equal access to these basic services, regardless \nof their individual circumstances. A recent study shows that government \nspending on education and health helps reduce income inequality \n(Box\u00a02.5.1). It has also been well documented that a key contributing \nfactor to the recent decline in income inequality in many Latin American \ncountries is improved access to education by the poor (Esquivel, Lustig, \nand Scott 2010, for example).\n\nIncreasing spending on education and health. Figures 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 \n\nshow wide variations in spending on education and health as a share \nof GDP among developing Asian countries. In 2010, in 15 out of the \n33 Asian countries where comparative data are available, government \nspending on education as a share of GDP was less than 4%, including the \nPRC, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines, compared with an \nOECD average of 5.2%. In 2009, in 20 out of the 41 Asian countries with \ncomparable data, government spending on health as a share of GDP was \nless than 5%, including most economies in East Asia, South Asia, and \n\n2.5.1  Estimating the impact of fiscal policies on income inequality\n\nBoth taxation (particularly personal income taxes) and \npublic spending reduce inequality, but public spending has \na larger impact on the distribution of income, according to \na study of 150 countries with data for 1970\u20132009.\n\nThe results in the box table suggest that government \n\nexpenditures on health and education reduce income \ninequality in Asia and the rest of the world. But \nexpenditure on social protection and housing appears to \nincrease income inequality in Asia, whereas it lowers it in \nthe rest of the world.\n\nAsia has made substantial progress toward achieving \n\nthe Millennium Development Goals and targets on \neducation and health. These achievements are consistent \nwith the finding that education and health expenditures \nreduce inequality. However, social protection policies \ngenerally remain limited in Asia, and in countries where \nthey exist, they tend to have a narrow coverage, extended \nmainly to urban population and the formal sector. This \ncould explain the paradoxical finding of social protection \nspending increasing inequality in Asia. The finding \nsuggests that universal social protection that covers the \nentire population would help reduce inequality.\n\nFor taxation, the results provide evidence that \n\npersonal income taxes reduce inequality, with a greater \neffect in Asia than in the rest of the world, possibly \nbecause of a larger number of people not paying income \ntax. Although taxes by themselves are less effective in \nredistributing income, taxation is crucial to raise financing \nfor government expenditure to achieve distributional \nobjectives.\n\nEstimated marginal impact of government spending \non the Gini coefficient (percentage points)\n\nSocial protection\n\nEducation\n\nHealth\n\nHousing\n\nAsia\n\n0.490\n\n-0.486\n\n-0.241\n\n2.162\n\nRest of the world\n\n-0.276\n\n-0.034\n\n-0.330\n\n-0.614\n\nNote: A negative sign means that an increase in government \nspending reduces the Gini coefficient.

These figures \nsuggest that there is scope for developing Asian economies to increase \nspending on education and health.\n\nIn practice, even if education and health services are available, poor \nhouseholds may not able to use them because of economic pressures (such \nas losing income, by sending children to school). To address the demand-\nside constraints, the policy community has developed the instrument \nof conditional cash transfers (CCTs). They have been designed to have \nlong-term benefits by providing poor households with an incentive to \ninvest in human capital (education and health). For example, poor families \nreceive cash transfers conditional on their children attending school.\n\nCCTs have expanded rapidly in Latin America since the 1990s, and \n\nhave been found to be effective in improving education and health \n\n\f78    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nindicators for poor households in many countries (Schultz 2004; Schady \nand Araujo 2006). In Asia, CCTs have been implemented in Bangladesh, \nCambodia, Pakistan and, more recently, Indonesia and the Philippines \n(Box\u00a02.5.2). CCT programs, which are financially sustainable and \ncombined with complementary programs to improve the delivery of \nhealth care and education services, could play an important role to reduce \npoverty and inequality in Asia.\n\nIncreasing social protection spending. Social protection also has an \nimportant role in reducing inequality. Social safety nets mitigate the \nrisks of external and transitory livelihood shocks, as well as meeting the \nminimum needs of the chronically poor. Exposure to such shocks can \nhave a profound and long-lasting impact not only on economic well-\nbeing, but also on accumulation of human capital, such as education \nand health. Social safety nets act as a coping mechanism for poor and \nvulnerable people and help improve well-being by investing in human \ncapital in the long run, which, in turn, can enhance accessibility of \nthose with limited assets and capabilities to opportunities (Ali and \nZhuang 2007).\n\nDespite the increasing recognition of the importance of social safety \n\nnets in the region, their provision remains limited. ADB (2008) shows \nthat very few developing Asian countries have adequate social safety nets, \ncompared with Japan or the Republic of Korea. One reason is the limited \nresources allocated to social protection (Figure\u00a02.5.3).\n\nCountries often face many challenges in increasing social protection \n\n2.5.2  Conditional cash transfers in the Philippines: The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program\n\nThe Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) has \nrun since January 2008. It aims to provide cash grants \nto extremely poor households and allow them to meet \ncertain human development goals\u2014health, nutrition, \nand education of children below 15 years\u2014set by the \ngovernment. Around 3 million households nationwide are \ntargeted under 4Ps in 2012, out of 18.5\u00a0million households \nin 2009.\n\nThe targeting involves a number of steps, including \n\nselecting the poorest municipalities and cities within \neach selected province based on poverty incidence, and \nidentifying poor households in the selected municipalities \nand cities using a proxy means testing that assesses \nhousehold socioeconomic characteristics such as \nownership of assets, type of housing units, educational \nattainment of household head, family livelihood, and \naccess to water and sanitation facilities.\n\nTo be eligible for 4Ps, a household must have an \n\nincome equal to or below the provincial poverty threshold; \nhave children 0\u201314 years old and/or a pregnant woman \nat the time of assessment; and agree to meet the program \nconditions. \n\nThe conditions have both health and education \n\ncomponents. In particular, pregnant women must avail of \npre- and postnatal care and childbirth must be attended by \na health professional. Parents are required to attend \u201cfamily \ndevelopment sessions\u201d conducted by local governments. \nChildren aged 0\u20135 must get regular preventive health \ncheckups and vaccines, and those aged 6\u201314 must receive \ndeworming pills twice a year. Children 3\u201314 years old \nmust attend classes at least 85% of the time. Schools \nare required to report the attendance rate of program \nbeneficiaries to their municipal governments.\n\nThe program benefits include P500 (around $12) a \nmonth per household for health and nutrition expenses, \nand P300 a month per child attending school for \n10\u00a0months, up to a maximum of three children per \nhousehold. Transfers are generally handed to the most \nresponsible adult in the household, and are credited to the \n\u201ccash card facility\u201d of the government-owned Land Bank \nof the Philippines.\n\nSource: DSWD (2012).\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     79\n\nprovision, including affordability, targeting, and institutional and \nadministrative capacity.\n\nAs for affordability, while this is often raised as an issue, studies have \n\nshown that the costs of basic universal social protection are not beyond \nthe reach of most developing countries (for example, Ortiz and Yablonski \n2010). ILO (2008) shows that virtually all countries can afford basic social \nsecurity.21\n\nOn targeting, poor beneficiaries of social protection programs account \n\nfor, on average, only about 54.8% of the poor population in developing \nAsia, pointing to a clear case for improving targeting (Figure\u00a02.5.4).\nIn terms of institutional and administrative capacity, examples \ninclude better accounting, rigorous financial controls, human resource \ndevelopment, computerization, and greater disclosure to stakeholders.\nSwitching general price subsidies to targeted transfers.

A typical example is fuel \nsubsidies (Figure\u00a02.5.5). In Indonesia, for example, in 2011 fuel \nand electricity subsidies amounted to 3.4% of GDP, which was \nlarger than government spending on infrastructure that year. It \nis estimated that the richest 10% of households consumed 40% \nof the total subsidized gasoline, and the top half of households \nused almost 84% of it (Ginting and Aji 2012).\n\nEncouragingly, the Indonesian government is taking some \n\naction to tackle this issue. In March 2012, the government \nproposed a revised 2012 budget bill to reduce untargeted \nfuel subsidies and to use the saved budget resources for \ninfrastructure investment, promotion of green growth, and \ntransfers to poor regions and households.22 Although what was \npassed by the Parliament was far short of what the government \noriginally proposed, it is still welcome.\n\nGreater and more equitable revenue mobilization\n\nGiven the large need for more human capital investment and \nsocial protection provision in many developing Asian countries, \ngovernments will inevitably have to mobilize more revenue. \nThe share of government revenue in GDP is low in many Asian \ncountries. For example, in 2011, the share of central government \nrevenue in GDP was about 12\u201314% in Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nMyanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines compared with the \nworld average of close to 25% (Figure\u00a02.5.6). The majority \nof government revenues are from taxation. In many Asian \ncountries, more tax revenues can be mobilized by broadening \ntax bases and improving tax administration.\n\nBroadening the tax base. The tax base can be broadened \nby reducing various exemptions, deductions, and incentives. \nDespite tax rates comparable to the world average (though lower \nthan the OECD average), personal income tax collection is low \nin Asia (Figure\u00a02.5.7). This is partly because of relatively high \ntax free (minimum exempt) thresholds and a relatively high \nthreshold of income above which the top marginal personal \nincome tax rate applies (Figure\u00a02.5.8).\n\nAlso contributing to the lower tax collection are tax \n\nconcessions. In the PRC, for example, only 11 types of personal \nincome are liable to tax, and others not. Some of these \ncategories are taxed at progressive rates (wages and salaries), \nwhile others are taxed at a flat rate (such as incomes of personal \nservices, royalties, and rental and lease incomes).

However, tax incentives can reduce \nthe progressivity of income taxation if resources are captured by high-\nincome interest groups lobbying for concessions. Moreover, they are \noften inefficient because they simply subsidize activities that firms would \nhave undertaken anyway. Tax collection could thus also be increased by \nbroadening the corporate tax base.\n\nValue added tax (VAT) receipts are also low as a share of GDP in \nmany Asian countries and is a potential source of additional government \nrevenue. It is true that VAT is regressive and it is not an effective tool for \nreducing income inequality, but it is less distortionary than income and \nsales taxes, and is easier to collect.\n\nVAT does not exist in, for example, Bhutan, Malaysia, Maldives, and \n\nMyanmar. For those countries where VAT exists, its collection can be \nincreased by broadening its base. VAT exemptions or reduced tax rates for \nnecessities are often used to address its potential regressivity. However, \nthese two mechanisms are costly and not well targeted at the poor. A \nmore effective policy would be direct transfer payments to those in need. \nIn countries where the VAT tax rate is low, it could be raised.\n\nImproving tax administration. Government revenue can be increased \n\nby improving tax administration. In the Philippines, for example, \npoor tax administration has been identified as a critical constraint to \nincreasing government revenue (ADB 2009b). Complicated tax systems \n\n\f2.5.9  Paved roads in Asian economies\n\n82    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nwith many tax rates, exemptions, deductions, and concessions \nincrease tax administration and compliance costs as well as the \nopportunity for tax planning and tax avoidance. They are also \noften seen as unfair because higher income taxpayers generally \nhave greater scope and resources to shift income to avoid higher \ntax rates. Unfair tax systems can reduce people\u2019s and businesses\u2019 \nwillingness to pay taxes. Strengthening governance and \ninstitutions is also a key to improving tax collection.\n\nReducing regional inequality\nSpatial inequalities account for a large part of Asia\u2019s inequality. \nReducing spatial inequality should therefore be a key element of \nthe policy responses. A key component of such inequality is that \nbetween provinces or states. Four policy options for reducing \nregional inequality are discussed below.\n\nImproving regional connectivity. Poor connectivity due to \nlack of adequate transport and communication infrastructure \nis often a major constraint for interior states or provinces \nin engaging in global trade and attracting investment. The \nproportion of paved roads in total roads was close to 100% in \nThailand (as of 2000), while it was only 6.3% in Cambodia (as \nof 2004), 9.9% in the Philippines (as of 2003), 11.9% in Myanmar \n(as of 2005), 13.5% in Lao PDR (as of 2008), 47.6% in Viet Nam \n(as of 2007), and 49.3% in India (as of 2008) (Figure\u00a02.5.9). \nSeveral ADB studies have found that the lack of adequate \ninfrastructure including transport is a critical constraint to \nprivate investment in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Nepal \n(ADB 2009b, 2010, 2011b). Improving infrastructure therefore \nshould be one of the key policy measures to reduce regional \ninequality.\n\nDeveloping growth poles in lagging region.

This is an exogenous factor and no one can \nchange it. However, developments in economic theory have \nalso emphasized the importance of agglomeration economies, increasing \nreturns, and clustering in shaping regional development (Krugman 2008). \nThis means that countries can identify areas of potential growth poles \nand use policy tools and public investment to trigger growth. Countries \ncould develop strategies for generating growth in lagging regions for \nequity as well as efficiency considerations. The PRC\u2019s Great Western \nDevelopment Strategy presents a good example (Box\u00a02.5.3).\n\nFiscal transfers for greater investment in human capital and better \n\naccess to public services in poor regions. Fiscal transfers from richer \nregions to poorer regions also have an important part to play in reducing \nregional inequality. However, such transfers are likely to encounter \npolitical resistance from the richer regions, all the more so as even \nbetter-off regions in developing countries face a raft of pressing fiscal \ndemands. Further, high levels of fiscal transfers may be seen as penalizing \nsuccessful regions and rewarding unsuccessful ones, hence undermining \nincentives. Fiscal transfers should, therefore, be carefully designed and \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n % of total roads\n\nFSM\u00a0=Federated States of Micronesia; Lao PDR\u00a0=\u00a0Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic; PNG\u00a0=\u00a0Papua New Guinea; PRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The figure is based on the latest available data between 2000 and 2008.\nSource: World Development Indicators online database (accessed 21 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     83\n\n2.5.3  The PRC\u2019s Great Western Development Strategy\n\nThis strategy was adopted in 2000 to boost the PRC\u2019s less \ndeveloped western region. It covers 11 provinces (Gansu, \nGuizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, \nInner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang) and one \nmunicipality (Chongqing). This region covers nearly three-\nfourths of the area of the country, but only one-fourth of \nits population and one-fifth of its total economic output \n(as of 2010).\n\nThe main components of the strategy include the \ndevelopment of infrastructure (transport, hydropower \nplants, energy, telecommunications, and urban \ndevelopment), attraction of foreign investment, increased \nefforts on ecological protection (such as reforestation), \npromotion of education, and retention of talent flowing to \nricher provinces. \n\nDuring 2000\u20132009, total state investment in major \nprojects in the western region reached CNY2.2 trillion \n(about US$349 billion); fiscal transfers from the central \ngovernment reached more than CNY3 trillion; the region\u2019s \nvolume of imports and exports grew by nearly one-fourth \neach year on average, with its share in the national total \nincreasing from 3.8% to 4.2%; and annual average regional \n\nGDP growth reached 11.9%, higher than the national \naverage, with the region\u2019s share in national GDP increasing \nfrom 17.1% to 18.5%.\n\nWhat has been the overall impact of the strategy on \nregional inequality? This is of course difficult to estimate \nbecause the counterfactual is difficult to specify. However, \nFan, Kanbur, and Zhang (2011) argue that regional \ninequality in the PRC has begun to stabilize and perhaps \neven turn down since the mid-2000s, partly as the result of \nthis strategy. \n\nBased on primary survey data in two poor provinces\u2014\n\nGuizhou and Gansu\u2014Zhang, Yang, and Wang (2011) \nshow that real wages have risen rapidly since 2003. \nFinally, Khan and Riskin (2005) have argued that overall \ninequality has begun to level off, and have identified the \nstrategy as a key factor.\n\nSources: Fan, Kanbur, and Zhang (2011); Zhang, Yang, and Wang \n(2011); Khan and Riskin (2005); http://www.chinawest.gov.cn/web/\nNewsInfo.asp?NewsId=55943.\n\nlinked to targets and performance in improving development outcomes in \nrecipient regions, and should aim to build poor regions\u2019 own capacity for \nself-sustaining regional development, such as staving off extreme poverty, \ninvesting in human capital, and improving public services.\n\nReducing barriers to within-country migration. Migration from \n\npoor to prosperous areas is one of the major means for reducing \nregional inequality. Migration and labour mobility often come up \nagainst significant barriers. One comes from the bureaucratic and \nadministrative obstacles to moving from one part of the country to \nanother. For example, in the PRC, the hukou (registration) system \nconstrains rural\u2013urban migration by limiting rural migrants\u2019 access to \nbasic public services such as education, health care, and social protection \nin urban areas. Lack of necessary skills and suitable job opportunities \nin prosperous areas is another barrier. Absence of portability of pension \nbenefits also discourages individuals from seeking better opportunities \nelsewhere. Improving connectivity, as mentioned, will facilitate not only \nthe movement of goods but also of people.\n\nMaking growth more employment friendly\nSince the declining share of labor income is associated with rising \ninequality, a key issue is how to maintain and even raise this share during \nthe growth process. This requires shifting the labor demand curve in \nthe productive sectors of the economy as output increases. If demand \noutstrips supply, wages will rise, increasing the labor income share \n\n\f84    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nand containing inequality. Therefore, making growth more \nemployment friendly so as to create productive and well-paid \njobs for a much wider section of the population is one of \nthe keys to confronting rising inequality in developing Asia. \nVarious policies stand out.\n\nFacilitating structural transformation\n\nAgriculture is still the largest (or at least substantial) employer \nin most Asian developing countries, and its dominance in \nproviding jobs is closely associated with the high proportion \nof vulnerable employment, which contributes to inequality \n(Figure\u00a02.5.10). A key challenge for most developing Asian \ncountries is therefore to facilitate the process of structural \ntransformation to transfer large amounts of rural, agriculture \nsurplus labor to urban, manufacturing and services sectors, \nwhere most of the future\u2019s productive jobs will be generated.23\nThese include making the business environment more \nconducive to investment, improving infrastructure, reducing \nregulatory burdens on enterprises, promoting innovation, and \nupgrading industry.\n\n2.5.10  Vulnerable employment in Asia, latest year\n\nEmployment rate (2009)\nVulnerable employment rate (2000s)\n\n%\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nDeveloping \nAsia\n\nMiddle East\nand \nNorth Africa\n\nOECD\n\nEastern \nEurope\n\nLatin America \nand \nthe Caribbean\n\nSub-Saharan \nAfrica\n\nOECD\u00a0=\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nNote: Vulnerable employment refers to unpaid family workers and own-account \nworkers as a percentage of total employment.

In 2010, India\u2019s share of \nmanufacturing in GDP was close to the average of low-income countries, \nbut much lower than the average of both lower and upper middle-income \ncountries (Figure\u00a02.5.11).24 In the PRC, on the other hand, the share of \nservices in GDP was much lower than the averages of low-, lower middle \nand upper middle-income countries.25\n\nA country\u2019s sectoral composition is determined by its comparative \n\nadvantages and other factors, but development policy often \nplays a role. For instance, India is making greater efforts to \ndevelop manufacturing, while the PRC is aiming to increase \nthe share of services as a source of growth and job creation. \nInternational experiences suggest that both manufacturing and \nservices are important for growth and job creation, and the two \noften support each other during economic development.\n\nStructural transformation also involves maintaining a \nhigh pace of agricultural productivity growth. This requires \ngovernments to implement agricultural policies to produce \nmore output per hectare. Improving the access of the rural poor \nto irrigation, electricity, transport services, new technology and \nimproved seeds, agricultural extension services, and financial \nservices are all vital for raising farm productivity. If ownership \nor access to land is highly skewed, implementing mechanisms \nthat improve the access of the poor to land is also essential. In \nthe PRC, rural nonagricultural village and township enterprises \nhave played an important role in lifting income levels of the \nrural population and reducing rural poverty. Such enterprises \ncould be promoted by other Asian countries.\n\nManufacturing\nIndia\nPhilippines\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPRC\nThailand\nLow-income\nLower middle-income\nUpper middle-income\nHigh-income\n\nServices\nIndonesia\nThailand\nPRC\nMalaysia\nIndia\nPhilippines\nLow-income\nLower middle-income\nUpper middle-income\nHigh-income\n\n2.5.11  Share of manufacturing and services in GDP, 2010\n\n0\n\n20\n\n60\n\n80\n\n40\n\n %\n\nPRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: World Development Indicators online database (accessed 24 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     85\n\nSupporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises\n\nSMEs provide most jobs, in developing and developed countries alike. \nBut SMEs often face constraints, especially in accessing finance, human \ncapital, and markets. Three ADB studies found that access to finance \nwas ranked among the top constraints to business growth by SMEs in \nthe Philippines, Indonesia and Nepal (ADB 2009b, 2010, 2011b). In the \nPRC, access to finance and human capital is also considered among major \nconstraints by SMEs, many of which are in rural areas.\n\nGovernments should support SME development by facilitating their \ncreation, removing unnecessary and cumbersome restrictions on their \ndevelopment, and addressing market failures in their access to finance. \nGovernments can also help SMEs adopt new technologies and access new \nmarkets (ADB 2009a).\n\nOn access to finance, recent international experience suggests that one \n\nof the most important ways governments can increase access to finance \nis to improve the institutional underpinnings of financial transactions \nby strengthening creditor rights, defining property rights so property \ncan be used as collateral for credit, and enhancing credit registries and \nsystems to screen borrowers. They can also improve the informational \ninfrastructure that underlies the workings of financial markets.\nTo help SMEs adopt technologies and enter new markets, \n\ngovernments can provide information on improved production methods, \nproducts, and markets, technical support services, and vocational \ntraining. They can also foster links between SMEs and large enterprises \nand encourage cluster-based development by exploiting the fact that many \nenterprises that make and sell related or complementary products are \ngrouped close together, often with their suppliers and buyers.\n\nRemoving factor market distortions\n\nOne of the reasons why developing countries with relatively abundant labor \nprefer labor-saving and capital-intensive techniques could be distortions in \nfactor markets: market prices of factors of production fail to reflect relative \nabundance, due to causes such as underdevelopment of the financial sector \nor financial repression. In the PRC, for instance, factor market reform has \nlagged behind product market reform, and interest rate control has kept \nborrowing costs low, especially for state-owned enterprises. During 1990\u2013\n2010, the PRC\u2019s real lending rate was one of the lowest among 50 middle- \nand high-income countries (ADB forthcoming). The low cost of capital has \nbeen put forward as one of the causes of the imbalances of growth sources \nin the PRC (Huang 2010; World Bank 2012b).\n\nIn India, the financial repression, as evidenced by persistently negative \n\nreal savings deposit rates, could also be a contributing factor to the low \ncost of capital relative to labor in the formal sector (RBI 2011). It has also \nbeen suggested that some of the earlier policies of industrialization, which \nwas intended to promote labor-intensive industries and adoption of labor-\nintensive techniques, had some unintended consequences of encouraging \nthe use of capital intensive technology (Kochhar et al. 2006; Felipe, \nKumar, and Abdon forthcoming).\n\nReducing factor market distortions could, therefore, promote job \n\ncreation. A key policy measure is to reduce or eliminate financial \nrepression by further developing the financial sector. This include \n\n\f86    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nreducing and eliminating distortions in the cost of capital by gradually \nadopting market-determined interest rates; allowing greater competition \nand private sector participation in the financial sector; further \nstrengthening the regulatory framework and governance of financial \ninstitutions; carefully managing the liberalization of the capital account; \nand making the exchange rate more flexible. India liberalized deposit \ninterest rate in November 2011 (RBI 2011).\n\nLabor market institutions\n\nEmployment generation also needs to be supported by effective labor \nmarket institutions. On the one hand, labor market institutions should \nhelp improve the employability of labor through providing skill training \nand assistance with job search (such as employment services), and provide \nnecessary protection of worker rights. On the other hand, they should not \nimpose excessive costs on enterprises and hurt job creation.\n\nThere are significant disagreements on effects of labor market \ninterventions on job creation. Some believe that interventions such as \nemployment protection legislation, minimum wages, and collective \nbargaining are important to protect the rights of workers, while others \nthink that these interventions will raise labor costs, only protect those \nwho have already been employed (or \u201cinsiders\u201d), but make employers \nreluctant to hire new workers, or find ways to bypass these (for example, \nby replacing regular, formal jobs with contract labor that offers less \nprotection, lower wages and little social security), hence hurting job \ncreation. Empirical evidence on these is mixed (Felipe and Hasan 2006).\nIn some countries, there has been an implicit or explicit move to a \n\u201cflexicurity system,\u201d which involves giving employers greater flexibility \nin adjusting the workforce based on their needs as determined by market \nfluctuations, while the security of workers is \u201csocialized\u201d through policies \nand programs administered by or through the state, such as re-training \nor unemployment insurance (Auer 2007). This approach reduces the \nretrenchment burden on firms (making it more likely that they will hire \nand provide better security for workers. In Asia, some countries have \nmoved in this direction, including the Republic of Korea and the PRC, \nwhile others have found it hard to restructure labor market institutions \n(Vandenberg 2010).\n\nIn sum, while there is large room for many Asian countries to \nbuild effective labor market institutions, the exact form and approach \nto follow will have to be decided by each country on the basis of their \nspecific circumstances. For countries that have transited from a planned \neconomy to a market economy and basic labor market institutions are \nyet to be established, there is a case for moving toward establishing or \nstrengthening formal arrangements. For countries where labor market \nregulations have been seen as too restrictive and a major constraint to \ngrowth and job creation in the formal sector, there is a need to examine \nthe specific elements that are likely to be constraints and ensure that they \nare appropriately addressed.\n\nPublic employment schemes\n\nGovernments can also introduce public employment schemes to act as \na buffer stock or mechanism for employment: when the private sector \n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     87\n\ndownsizes in recessions, workers who lose their job can find work in \nsuch a scheme. The government pledges to hire anyone satisfying certain \ncriteria and willing to work on projects such as small infrastructure (e.g., \nclean water and sewage projects, roads) at a basic public sector living \nsalary. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka in Asia, and Argentina, \nBrazil, Chile, Peru, and Mexico in Latin America, and developed \ncountries including Australia and France, have public employment \nprograms, many of which are temporary (Felipe 2009).\n\nSome countries have implemented such programs to counter the \nmajor problems associated with persistent unemployment. In Asia, a well-\nknown case is India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \n(Box\u00a02.5.4).\n\n2.5.4  India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme\n\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme was launched in 2006 in the 200 most \nbackward districts of India (of 640 districts in all). It is a \nprogram that explicitly recognizes the \u201cright to a job.\u201d \nUnder the program, every rural adult willing to \nbe engaged in unskilled manual labor has the right \nto demand work from the state government for up to \n100\u00a0days per household annually. The core funding for the \nprogram is provided by the central government, and state \ngovernments make additional contributions.\n\nThe program has been extended and now covers the \n\nentire country (apart from 100% urban districts). The \nnumber of households who were provided employment \nincreased from 21 million in 2006/07 to 38 million in \n2010/11, which amounted to more than 1,200 million \nperson-days of work. A notable aspect of the scheme is the \n\nlarge number of women who have sought work\u2014female \nparticipation increased from 41% to 49% in this period.\nThe program has several achievements, including \nlifting rural wages; reducing distress migration; creating \ncommunity assets; promoting empowerment and making \npoliticians more responsive to the demands of the \npoor; reducing unemployment and underemployment; \nencouraging growth of agricultural production; reducing \ndiscrimination; and reducing malnutrition.\n\nIt has also drawn criticism, however, including \nallegations of corruption, weakening work incentives, \nundermining fiscal sustainability, distorting the labor \nmarket, and causing wage inflation.\n\nSources: Bonner et al. (2012); Jagannathan (2011); Sjoblom and \nFarrington (2008).\n\nToward inclusive growth in Asia\nDriven by globalization, technological progress, and market-oriented \nreform, developing Asia has had a remarkable period of growth and \npoverty reduction. However, the drivers of growth are also magnifying \nthe effects of inequalities in physical and human capital, leading to rising \nincome inequality. These forces require Asian policy makers to redouble \ntheir efforts to generate more productive jobs, equalize opportunities \nin employment, education and health, and address spatial inequality. \nWithout such policies, which will enhance growth further, Asia may be \npulled into inefficient populist policies, which will benefit neither growth \nnor equity.\n\nThe policy options outlined constitute key elements of a strategy \n\nfor inclusive growth. Broadly, inclusive growth can be defined as \n\u201cgrowth coupled with equality of opportunity,\u201d and it needs three policy \npillars: sustained growth to create productive jobs for a wide section \nof the population; social inclusion to equalize access to opportunity; \nand social safety nets to mitigate vulnerability and risks and prevent \n\n\f88    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nextreme poverty (Zhuang and Ali 2010). Such a strategy would ensure \nthat all members of society can participate in the development process \nproductively and benefit equitably from the opportunities generated by \neconomic growth.\n\nIt is encouraging that more and more developing Asian countries are \n\nembracing the concept of inclusive growth, with an increasing number \nof countries\u2014including the PRC, India, and many Southeast Asian \ncountries\u2014placing inclusive growth at the heart of their development \npolicy, as reflected in their recent medium-term development plans. \nIndeed, the entire development community is embracing the concept of \ninclusive growth. These developments will go a long way toward reducing \npoverty and inequality and making the world a more equitable place.\n\nEndnotes\n1   A common measure of inequality, ranging from zero indicating perfect equality and 1 (or \n\n100) indicating perfect inequality. See Box\u00a02.2.1 for technical details.\n\n2   Of these countries, 25 have data for the 1990s and 2000s.\n3   The 13 comprise one in East Asia (PRC), three in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, the Philippines, \nand Thailand), one in South Asia (Sri Lanka), one in Central Asia (Georgia), and seven in \nthe Pacific (Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu). The Gini of \nthe rest of the economies ranged from 27.8 for Afghanistan to 38.9 for Indonesia. \n\n4   If two countries with data only in the 1990s are included, the average is 37.9.\n5   We say \u201cappears\u201d because the rural Gini had a sharp fall in 2002\u20132005 but a steep rise in \n2005\u20132008. It is unclear whether this switch reflects data problems or changes in income \ndistribution.\n\n6   The PRC, Fiji, Georgia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nauru, Palau, the Philippines, Samoa, Solomon \n\nIslands, Thailand, and Vanuatu.\n7   This is a simple arithmetic average.\n8   Data are not available for the Republic of Korea; Mongolia; or Taipei,China.\n9   The difference between the two measures was 4.4 percentage points for the Philippines in \n\n2009 and 8.9 percentage points for Viet Nam in 2008.\n\n10  The increases were more pronounced in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, \n\nLuxembourg, Spain, and Sweden.\n\n11  A caveat: inequality in education is difficult to measure, as the quality dimension of \neducation in particular is hard to capture through survey and census instruments.\n\n12  Global Health Observatory Repository Data (accessed 18 February 2012).\n13  Circumstances, as used here, are personal or family socioeconomic and demographic \n\ncharacteristics over which an individual has no direct control.\n\n14  A cross-country study by IMF (2007) finds that global trade integration helps to reduce \n\ninequality as measured by the Gini coefficient, global financial integration increases it, and \ntechnological progress is the most important contributor to rising inequality globally in \nthe last 2 decades. The study also finds that these impacts are particularly pronounced in \ndeveloping Asia.\n\n15  Tertiary education premium refers to the wage premium for workers with at least tertiary \n\neducation compared with workers with a lower level of education.\n\n16  Acemoglu (2002) notes that for the late 20th century, there has been a rise in returns to \neducation and a decrease in low-skill wages, despite an increase in the supply of college \ngraduates, which suggests that supply has not kept up with demand for high-skilled labor. \nStudies have also argued for evidence of skill-biased technological change in developing \ncountries (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007; Robbins 1996; Sanchez-Paramo and Schady 2003; \nand Attanasio, Goldberg, and Pavcnik 2004 for Latin America; Hsieh and Woo 2005 for \nHong Kong, China; and Kijima 2006 for India). However, Card and DiNardo (2002) \npoint out that wage inequality stabilized in the US despite continuing developments in \ncomputer technology. They also argue that skill-biased technological change does not \n\n\fConfronting rising inequality in Asia     89\n\nfully explain wage gaps across genders, and racial and demographic structures. The debate \nbetween competing explanations for the US is ongoing (see Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2008; \nMarquis, Trehan, and Tantivong 2011).\n\n17  Wage employment refers to wage-earning employment, mostly in the formal sector. Wage \nemployment elasticity is the ratio of employment growth to GDP growth between two \nperiods. It thus measures the amount of employment growth required to generate each \npercentage point of GDP growth.\n\n18  A dual economy consists of two sectors, one a low-income, rural subsistence sector with \nsurplus population, and the other an expanding urban modern (manufacturing and \nservices) sector. The urban economy absorbs labor from rural areas, which holds down \nurban wages until rural surplus labor is exhausted. See Lewis (1954).\n\n19  Several decades ago, Arthur Lewis\u2014a Nobel Prize winner\u2014pointed out the tendency of \n\nthe development process to be inegalitarian: \u201cDevelopment must be inegalitarian because \nit does not start in every part of the economy at the same time\u2026There may be one such \nenclave in an economy, or several; but at the start, development enclaves include only a \nsmall minority of the population\u201d (Lewis 1976).\n\n20  See also the long-run analysis of regional inequality in the PRC by Fan, Kanbur, and Zhang \n\n(2011).\n\n21  According to the UN (2007), the cost of a universal social pension scheme designed to \nkeep the elderly out of poverty (at the $1-a-day poverty line) was estimated at 0.25% of \nGDP for Malaysia and about 0.5% of GDP for the Philippines and Thailand in 2005.\n22  The revised 2012 Budget Law gives a mandate to the government to increase fuel prices if \nthe average Indonesian crude oil price in the last 6-month period increases to $120.80 per \nbarrel (15% above the budget assumption of $105).\n\n23  ADB (2007a) provides a comprehensive discussion of the issues involved.\n24  Although India\u2019s share of services in GDP is high, it has been argued that jobs in the sector \n\nare mostly of low productivity and poorly paid. While the booming business process \noutsourcing sector has generated many productive and well-paid jobs, this has only \nbenefited a small group of the educated (ADB 2007a).\n\n25  Some argue that the PRC\u2019s low share of services is also related to the way the data for \n\nservices are collected and included in national income accounting (Pant 2007).\n\nBackground papers and references\n\nBackground papers\nAizenmann, J., M.

Prudent \nfiscal  and  monetary  policies  helped  control  inflation  and  lower  the  budget  deficit,  although  public  debt \nremained high in 2011, leaving little room for fiscal maneuver. The external accounts generally improved. \nEconomic growth will continue in 2012 and 2013\u2014but with downside risks\u2014and over the medium term, \ncontinued  and  faster  structural  reforms  are  needed  to  support  growth. \n\nEconomic performance\nAfter modest growth of 2.1% in 2010, economic recovery continued \nin 2011, with growth estimated at 4.5%. On the supply side, industry, \nagriculture, and services were responsible for the stronger performance, \nas construction declined (Figure\u00a03.1.1).\n\nIndustry (excluding construction) was the driving force, growing by \nan estimated 12.3%, including 12.2% in mining and quarrying and more \nthan 16% in food processing. Agriculture expanded by an estimated \n12.6%, rebounding from a 15.7% decline in 2010 that greatly impeded the \ncountry\u2019s recovery from the 2009 recession. Agriculture was a major \nfocus of government policy and benefited from interest rate subsidies and \nfree seed distribution programs. Construction, largely household-financed \nand that had been the main driver before the crisis, remained weak, \ncontracting by about 10% despite a recovery in remittances. As overall \nactivity accelerated, services expanded by 5.8%, with the fastest growth in \nhealth and social work activities, entertainment and recreation.\n\nOn the demand side, net exports and consumption underpinned \nthe recovery, while total investment detracted from growth. Net exports \nimproved by 17%, reflecting the favorable external environment, and private \nconsumption rose by an estimated 2.3%, on higher domestic bank lending \nand sustained remittance inflows. Total investment fell by 4.1%, marking \nsluggish private investment and restraints on public capital spending.\nAverage annual inflation decreased to 7.7% from 8.2% in 2010 \n(Figure\u00a03.1.2). Monetary tightening and a slowdown in nonfood prices \noffset rapid increases in food prices, helping bring inflation closer to the \ncentral bank\u2019s target band of 4% +/-1.5%. In December 2011, year-on-year \ninflation was 4.7%, half the previous year\u2019s rate. The central bank raised \nthe refinancing rate by 125\u00a0basis points in three steps in February\u2013April to \n8.5% and kept it steady until September, when it was cut by 50\u00a0basis points \nto 8.0%, owing to diminishing inflation pressures.\n\nPropelled by increased credit activity and a continued buildup in net \n\ndomestic assets, broad money (M2X) growth doubled to 23.7% in 2011. \nHowever, net foreign assets declined, reflecting the central bank\u2019s sales \n\nThis chapter was written by Grigor Gyurjyan of the Armenia Resident Mission, ADB, \nYerevan.\n\n3.1.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\nAgriculture\nConstruction\nIndustry (excluding construction)\nServices (including indirect taxes and other items)\n\nPercentage points\n20\n\n13.7\n\n6.9\n\n-14.1\n\n2.1\n\n4.5\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am; Central Bank of Armenia. \nhttp://www.cba.am (both accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.1.2  Inflation\nOverall\n\nFood\n\nNonfood\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n%\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company; National Statistical Service \nof the Republic of Armenia. http://www.armstat.am (both \naccessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f100    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nof foreign exchange in an attempt to limit depreciation and to smooth \nlarge fluctuations.\n\nIn 2011, the government continued to pursue a prudent fiscal policy, \n\nwith the aim of gradually reducing the budget deficit and achieving \nmacroeconomic stability. The overall budget deficit is estimated to have \nnarrowed to 3.3% of GDP from 5.0% in 2010, surpassing the official target \nof 3.9% (Figure\u00a03.1.3). Fiscal consolidation efforts, combined with the \nimpact on revenues of economic expansion and some improvements in \ntax and customs administration, raised general government revenue to \n23.6% of GDP from 22.3% in 2010. Restrained capital spending enabled \ntotal outlays to fall to 26.9% of GDP from 27.3% in 2010.\n\nThe ratio of central government debt to GDP rose slightly to an \nestimated 43% at end-2011 from 39.2% the previous year, still within the \n50% ceiling stipulated by the Public Debt Law. About 86% of all public \ndebt is external, with domestic debt held mainly by banks.\n\nThe balance of payments generally improved, and the current \naccount deficit narrowed to an estimated 12.4% of GDP from 14.7% in \n2010 (Figure\u00a03.1.4). Exports surged by an estimated 20.0% to $1.4\u00a0billion,\nbenefitting from generally favorable global commodity prices that boosted \nexport values of copper, molybdenum, and other metal concentrates from \nmining. Imports climbed by an estimated 8.8% to $3.5\u00a0billion, boosted\nby domestic demand that reflected a gradual recovery in foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) and a rebound in remittances.\n\nThe large current account gap was financed primarily by donor inflows \n\nand FDI. Remittances from workers abroad rose by 20% to $1.3\u00a0billion,\nslightly below their 2008 peak of $1.4\u00a0billion; most remittances came from\nthe Russian Federation. Net FDI rose by 15.7% to an estimated $650\u00a0million,\nand most investments were directed to mining, telecommunications, and \nenergy. The Russian Federation accounted for nearly half of all investment. \nStrong export growth, successive releases of funds from Armenia\u2019s \narrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated in \n2010, and a rise in remittances lifted foreign reserves to $1.96\u00a0billion by\nDecember, equivalent to about 5.2\u00a0months of imports.\n\nIn 2011 the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 1.2% \nand the real effective exchange rate by 2.2%, though the full potential \nof exports remained constrained by low competitiveness and high \nconcentration in mining (Figure\u00a03.1.5).\n\nThe government continued implementing economic reforms to \nimprove the business environment, streamlining the permit process and \nmaking more use of electronic services and one-stop shops for investors. \nArmenia improved in five of the 10 areas in the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2012 survey and was among the top 10 reformers worldwide, \nrising six places to 55.\n\nEconomic outlook\nArmenia\u2019s economic recovery is expected to continue in 2012 and 2013, \nthough a shade less quickly than in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.1.6).\n\nWeak economic prospects in Europe (which accounts for about 60% of \n\nArmenia\u2019s exports) and their possible spillover to the Russian Federation \n(80% of remittances, Figure\u00a03.1.7) pose major risks to economic growth. \n\n3.1.3  Fiscal balance\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\n\n% of GDP\n32\n\n16\n\n0\n\n-16\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n09\n\n10\n\n3.1.4  Current account components\n\nCurrent account \nTransfers \nIncome \nGoods and services \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.1.5  Effective exchange rates and reserves\n\nGross international reserves\n\nReal\nNominal\n\n2005 = 100\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am (both \naccessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n% of GDP\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n$ billion\n2.4\n\n1.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nArmenia    101\n\nHowever, structural policy reforms under way, such as an electronic \nlisting of properties and property values as well as electronic facilities to \nissue construction permits, will help improve the investment climate.\nOn the supply side, agriculture is expected to continue to grow, \nbut moderately, mainly reflecting government support and assuming \ncontinued normal weather conditions. The forecast increases in mining \nand food processing will contribute to overall industry growth. A \nmoderate rise in construction is foreseen, mostly owing to large \ninfrastructure projects, but no major changes are expected in household-\nfinanced construction. On the demand side, remittance-backed \nconsumption is expected to be the growth driver, aided by a modest \nrecovery in public investment spending.\n\nPlanned reforms will provide additional impetus to growth and \nshould make it less volatile. Laws on free economic zones, an export-led \nstrategy, and a \u201cregulatory guillotine\u201d initiative aimed at eliminating \nexcessive regulation\u2014all adopted in 2011\u2014may lay the favorable \ngroundwork for attracting investment and diversifying the country\u2019s \nindustrial base. Early in 2012, approving the first applications from the \nRussian Federation, the government authorized the creation of two \neconomic zones, one for agricultural exports and one for high-tech goods.\nFiscal consolidation is set to continue in 2012 and 2013, given concerns \nabout the buildup of public and external debt. The government\u2019s medium-\nterm fiscal objective is to reduce the budget deficit to 3.1% of GDP in 2012 \nand 2.0% in 2013. Although a pronounced global slowdown could reduce \nrevenue, sustained reforms in tax, customs, and economic competition are \nexpected to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio. They include a strong tax package \nadopted in 2011 that raised excises on liquor, luxury vehicles, and engine \noil, the marginal rate on high-income taxpayers, and higher tax rates on \ngambling facilities and restaurants. Good revenue performance would \nenable the government to increase social security benefits and pensions, \nwhile reducing the overall budget deficit. \n\nAverage annual inflation is forecast to diminish to 4.1% in 2012 \nand rise slightly to 4.5% in 2013, as continued domestic support returns \nagricultural production to normal patterns and global food prices \nmoderate and then pick up a little. Tight monetary policy will also help \ncontain inflation. The 12-month (December\u2013December) rate is expected to \nremain in the target band in the forecast period.\n\nThe external public debt-to-GDP ratio is set to rise in the forecast period \n\n(Figure\u00a03.1.8), limiting the space for new borrowing. Still, the IMF, in its \nlatest (December 2011) debt sustainability analysis, viewed external public \ndebt as sustainable and the risk of debt distress as low, even after applying \nstress tests. The IMF judged that the 3% structural deficit target would \nmaintain the debt ratio at current levels past 2016 without large shocks \n(although history suggests considerable likelihood of shocks occurring).\nLower world demand and a fall in prices for key commodity \n\nexports, such as copper and other metals, could harm export earnings. \nHowever, given the expected outcomes of the government\u2019s export \ndiversification strategy\u2014approved in 2011 and targeted at developing \n11\u00a0industrial branches with export potential, including pharmaceuticals, \nengineering, and brandy production\u2014exports are projected to expand \nby 8.0% in 2012 and by about 11.0% in 2013 on top of the large growth \n\n3.1.6  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 15 March 2012); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.1.7  Sources of remittances\n\nUnited States\nRussian Federation\nRest of the world\n\nChange in total\n\n%, year on year\n120\n\n$ million\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n-60\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul Dec\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am \n(accessed 16 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n-16\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n3.1.8  External debt\n\n% of GDP\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f3.1.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n3.8\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n4.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance \n\n-11.2\n\n-10.0\n\n3.1.9  Current account balance\n\n5-year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n-18\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistical Service of the Republic of \nArmenia. http://www.armstat.am (accessed 12 March 2012); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n102    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nin 2011. Given recent trends in remittances and investments, imports \nare likely to continue to grow by about 4.5% in 2012 and 6.0% in 2013. \nThe large infrastructure projects will likely boost domestic demand for \nimports. The recently adopted mining code, which reset mining royalties \nconsistent with international best practices, is expected to attract further \ninvestment in the sector. \n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to widen to 11.2% of GDP in \n2012 and then shrink to 10.0% of GDP in 2013, reflecting projections for \ngradual export diversification and continued strong remittances. Loan \ninflows and a modest rise in FDI are expected to help finance the current \naccount deficit (Figure\u00a03.1.9).\n\nPolicy challenge highlights\nContinued reforms in tax and customs and in the business environment \nare needed to sustain economic growth and diversify the economic base \nfrom traditional overreliance on mining and construction, although the \nimpact of reforms may take a considerable time.\n\nThe government has committed to accelerate these reforms. Despite \n\nthe toughening of antitrust legislation, conditions for competitiveness \nremain unequal across firms of different sizes. Monopolistic practices of \nproducers and importers of certain products distort prices and contribute \nto inflation. Corruption and inefficient state governance are still serious \nobstacles to reform.\n\nFurther improvements to the business environment, especially in \n\npaying taxes, enforcing contracts, and trading across borders, are a \npriority for the government. Moreover, slow progress in legal reform \nhas hindered the effectiveness of new laws. Thus the government is \nimplementing an action plan on doing business that encompasses some \n50\u00a0activities, including reducing the cost of company registration and the \nsteps to resolve contractual disputes, and, for small and medium-sized \nenterprises, simplifying tax payments and allowing electronic payment of \ncustoms duties. \n\nMore effort to strengthen governance will likewise be important to \nimprove social policy, improve the distribution of resources, and reduce \nthe recent crisis-related increase in poverty. Private sector development, \nespecially through promoting small and medium-sized enterprises outside \nthe capital, is critical in reducing the gap in living standards between the \ncapital and the regions.\n\nDespite the monetary tightening and the central bank\u2019s policies to \ncontain dollarization of the economy, foreign currency loans and deposits \ncontinue to be dominant (60% and 70%, respectively), increasing the \ncountry\u2019s vulnerability to exchange rate shocks and making monetary \npolicy less effective.\n\nAdditional spending on roads, urban infrastructure, and water \nservices is crucial for inclusive growth over the longer term. Financing \nsuch spending without increasing the already high public debt-to-GDP \nratio will require further increases in the tax-to-GDP ratio and reductions \nin public debt. Closer public\u2013private partnership in infrastructure \ncould also help reduce the burden on government finances and meet \nburgeoning infrastructure needs.\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nGrowth was virtually nil in 2011, as safety concerns caused a stoppage in oil production at one of the main \nplatforms  for  much  of  the  year,  offsetting  gains  from  government-financed  investment  in  other  sectors. \nWith expected more normal oil production,  growth  should  strengthen in 2012 and 2013. Diversifying the \neconomy  will  be  important  to  maintain  growth  over  the  longer  term.\n\nEconomic performance\nOverall GDP grew by a mere 0.1% in 2011, as a 9.3% contraction in the \noil sector largely offset a 9.4% expansion in non-oil activity, which \nwas largely driven by public investment in infrastructure. Crude \noil production fell by 10.5%, as a review and strengthening of safety \nprocedures halted output at the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli oil platform for \nmuch of the year. Natural gas production declined by 2.2%, as Turkey, \nthe country\u2019s major importer, reduced imports of Azeri gas and no other \ncountries made offsetting purchases.\n\nThe non-oil sector recorded growth in agriculture, construction, and \n\nservices (Figure\u00a03.2.1). Agriculture grew by 5.8%, mainly from higher \ncrops and livestock production, reflecting expanded cultivation and the \nimpact of government tax credits and lending programs for improving \naccess to modern farm equipment. Construction climbed by 20%, lifted \nby non-oil government projects and foreign investment in tourism. \nIndustry contracted by 4.3% because of the lower oil output. Services rose \nby 6.5%, led by 10.3% growth in the wholesale and retail sector and some \nexpansion of communications and tourism.\n\nOn the demand side, investment\u2014mainly non-oil and largely \nfinanced from domestic resources\u2014surged by 27.3%, with machinery \nand equipment manufacturing, communications, and chemical \nproduction receiving most of it. Private consumption grew by 9.9%, \nfueled in part by a 14.2% salary increase for civil servants introduced in \nSeptember\u2013November.\n\nAverage annual inflation moved up to 7.9%, largely reflecting higher \nfood prices early in the year as a result of crop damage late in 2010 and \nprice increases for imported foodstuffs, as well as inflation in trading \npartner countries. Monthly inflation spiked in the first half as food stocks \ndeclined, and then moderated in the second half with the new harvest \n(Figure\u00a03.2.2).\n\nFiscal policy is driven largely by oil income, which accumulates in the \nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), from where transfers are made to \nthe budget to finance state spending. In 2011 such transfers constituted \n57% of total government revenue (versus 52% in 2010); they helped finance \n\nThis chapter was written by Nail Valiyev of the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, ADB, Baku.\n\n3.2.1  GDP growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\n34.5\n\n25.1\n\n10.8\n\n9.3\n\n5.0\n\n0.1\n\nServices\n%\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.2.2  Monthly inflation\n\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nJul\n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\nDec\n\n \nJan\n2009\n\n \n\nJan\n10\n\n \n\nJan\n11\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund.

The transfers \nallowed a surplus in the state (unconsolidated) budget of 0.6% of GDP; \nwithout them, the budget would have run a deficit of 17.3% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.2.3).\n\nTotal government revenue, including SOFAZ transfers, was equivalent \nto 31.4% of GDP. Non-oil receipts grew by 22%, reflecting the strong non-oil \nperformance, although they contributed less than half all budget receipts.\nHigher oil prices enabled the government to raise its spending by \n30.8%, including the steep rise of wages for civil servants, higher pensions \nand other social program spending, as well as building projects. Capital \nexpenditure accounted for more than half the government\u2019s outlays.\n\nResponding to rising inflation and concerns over capital inflows, the \n\ncentral bank tightened monetary policy, raising the refinancing rate in \nJune to 5.25% and increasing reserve requirements in May from 0.5% to \n2.0% on all deposits and, in July, to 3.0% on foreign currency deposits. To \nprevent significant real appreciation of the local currency and to create a \nmore competitive non-oil sector, the central bank also used sterilization \noperations, selling $497\u00a0million to the banks (Figure\u00a03.2.4).\n\nThe current account recorded a surplus of 28.7% of GDP, smaller than \n\nthe previous year. Because of higher imports, the trade surplus declined \nto $16.8\u00a0billion from $19.7 billion in 2010, as higher oil prices (despite\nlower oil production) helped total exports to stay at around the 2010 level \nof $26.5 billion. Non-oil exports remained small at $1.6\u00a0billion. Growing\ndomestic demand helped raise imports, mainly of machinery, electronics, \nand foodstuffs, by more than 50%.\n\nRemittances jumped by 42.7%, reflecting the revival of the Russian \nand Turkish economies, the main employment destinations for expatriate \nAzeris. Foreign direct investment remained less than 0.5% of GDP, \nreflecting little net private investment in either the oil or non-oil sectors. \nOverall reserves grew to an estimated $10.3\u00a0billion. Total external debt\nat end-2011 was estimated at 17.8% of GDP, including public and publicly \nguaranteed external debt of 8.4% of GDP.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is projected to accelerate to 4.1% in 2012 but to moderate to \n3.5% in 2013, mirroring higher oil output and continued expansion in the \nnon-oil sector (Figure\u00a03.2.5). Oil output is forecast to pick up moderately \nin 2012 after completion of upgrades on the three main oil platforms, \nwhile the expected opening of new gas platforms may increase gas \nproduction if demand also increases (Figure\u00a03.2.6). Continued recession \nin the eurozone will, however, likely limit demand for petroleum and thus \nthe rise in oil production. Similarly, a steep fall in prices might lead the \ngovernment to curb output.\n\nGrowth in the oil sector will affect transport, communications, and \nwholesale and retail trade, particularly the development of new rail and \nsea transport links for petroleum. Current road projects will stimulate \ntransport, while agricultural projects and subsidies for imported seeds \nshould help boost agricultural output. These measures will also encourage \nfarmers to shift more into cash crops.\n\n3.2.3  Fiscal indicators\n\nDeficit \nDeficit without SOFAZ\nSOFAZ\nTotal revenues excluding SOFAZ\nExpenditure\n\n10\n\n09\n\n2007\n\n08\nSOFAZ = State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan.\nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \nhttp://www.finance.gov.az\nClick here for figure data\n\n 11\n\n3.2.4  Exchange rate\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nDec\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.2.5  Oil and non-oil GDP growth\n\nTotal\n\nOil\n\nNon-oil\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan.\nClick here for figure data\n\n% of GDP\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nAZN/$\n\n0.81\n\n0.80\n\n0.79\n\n0.78\n\n%\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nAzerbaijan    105\n\nServices are expected to stay largely driven by trade and tourism \nin 2012. The government\u2019s investment program should, by expanding \ninfrastructure, support industry and construction through boosting \ndemand for local production of cement, steel pipes, and other building \nmaterials. Although the non-oil sector will remain small, its development \nand an improved business environment would improve domestic \nemployment opportunities, possibly reducing remittances over the \nmedium term.\n\nDespite the central bank\u2019s goal of reducing inflation to 7\u20137.5% in \n2012 and 2013, various factors could take inflation to 9.0% in 2012 before \nit subsequently recedes to 8.5% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.2.7). Strong domestic \ndemand fueled by oil income, rising public sector consumption (including \nplanned government salary increases), and expanded domestic credit to \nthe economy may heighten inflationary pressures in 2012. The completion \nof grain-storage and improved food-processing facilities should, however, \nreduce food imports, helping moderate inflation in 2013.\n\nThe budget envisages a deficit of 1.3% of GDP in 2012 (Figure\u00a03.2.8), \nas total government spending is planned to rise by 10%, while revenue is \nforecast to grow by only 4%, based on a very conservative assumption for \noil prices ($80 per barrel). Revenue, including SOFAZ transfers, is forecast\nat 37% of GDP in 2012, but would come in lower if petroleum prices \nplunged. Higher petroleum prices on the other hand could allow for even \nsteeper increases in salaries and pensions in 2012, although a sharp fiscal \nexpansion risks overheating the economy and stoking inflation.\n\nThe budget outlines a 22.2% expansion in social outlays in 2012. The \ngovernment\u2019s investment plan aims to keep capital spending, mainly for \ninfrastructure projects on irrigation, roads and energy, at 2011 levels.\n\nA budget deficit of 1% of GDP in 2013 is forecast, with total revenue, \n\nincluding SOFAZ transfers, of 32% of GDP. Because of limited non-oil \nsector income, the budget presumes that transfers from SOFAZ will \naccount for 61% of total government revenue in 2012, and comparable \ntransfers will likely be needed in 2013. Although SOFAZ balances, at close \nto 60% of 2010 GDP, should be sufficient to support such budget transfers \nover the next few years, global shocks and unexpected problems with oil \nproduction could affect the future sustainability of relying on SOFAZ \ntransfers to fund expenditure.\n\nMonetary policy will continue to focus on restraining inflation, so \n\nas to limit nominal interest rates and avoid a real appreciation of the \nlocal currency. The central bank plans to improve prudential and capital-\nadequacy control, as well as risk management, while strengthening \nthe interbank market. Consolidating existing, small private banks \nand privatizing the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan (the \ncountry\u2019s largest bank) should foster a more competitive environment and \ncut banking costs.\n\nThe current account surplus is expected to remain high, at 22.0% of \nGDP in 2012 and 19.0% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.2.9), in light of elevated oil prices \nand increased output. Oil-related exports are expected to remain the \ndominant export category, at about 90% of the total.\n\nServices imports, including transport, communications, and \nconstruction, are expected to grow once oil operations are back to \nstrength.

In addition, foreign investment \ncould rise sharply if petroleum reserves are found in the area covered by \nan oil exploration agreement signed between BP and SOCAR in late 2010.\nFinancing for new projects is forecast to increase public and publicly \nguaranteed debt slightly, to about 8.7% of GDP in 2012. With international \nreserves of more than $40\u00a0billion (including SOFAZ assets), Azerbaijan\u2019s\nexternal position should remain comfortable over the next several years.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversifying from petroleum\nSupporting growth in the non-oil sector and reducing dependence on \noil revenue are the most pressing long-term issues for the economy. The \nkey to maintaining long-term growth\u2014diversifying the economy\u2014will \ndepend on developing a strong private sector. In turn this will require \naccess to financing and an improved business and investment climate. \nThus financial and regulatory reform making it easier to do business \nwill be essential. Non-oil activity needs to be promoted subnationally \nespecially, in order to reduce urban\u2013rural income disparities.\n\nWith the country\u2019s rich natural resources, agriculture appears the \nmost promising area for diversification, and some studies suggest that \nits productivity can be increased two- or threefold over the medium \nterm. Such gains would require a stronger legal framework, output \nreoriented toward cash crops, and improved market access, as the \nrelatively few produce-collection points and processing plants hold back \nearnings opportunities. Heavy investment is thus needed to develop \nagroprocessing, which requires cold-storage tanks and transport systems, \nsophisticated processing plants, and strong marketing.\n\nPublic investment in the non-oil sector should increasingly be financed \n\nby taxes rather than transfers from SOFAZ, to improve the sustainability \nof public finances. SOFAZ revenue should be used mainly to smooth out \npublic spending and finance large, one-time infrastructure projects.\n\nIn financial sector reform, the central bank\u2019s decision to privatize the \nInternational Bank of Azerbaijan, is expected to strengthen competition \namong banks, while the additional capital obtained for that bank should \nstrengthen banking generally (the bank\u2019s liquidity and capital shortages \nhave complicated privatization, however). Proposed consolidation of small \nbanks could also improve competition and increase efficiency, which \nwould benefit the private sector through lower banking costs and easier \naccess to finance.\n\nAzerbaijan improved its ranking in the World Bank\u2019s 2012 Doing \n\nBusiness survey to 66, aided by reforms simplifying tax payments. \nNevertheless, the country still rates poorly in many areas and was \ndowngraded in several, including access to electricity and trading across \nborders (although current energy projects should improve the electricity \nranking). Likewise, transport projects and regional cooperation programs \nmay well encourage Azerbaijan and other member countries to streamline \ntrading procedures and so boost cross-border trade.\n\n\fGeorgia\n\nThe economy maintained robust growth in 2011, following its recovery in 2010 from the global recession, \nwhile  annual  inflation  rose  slightly.  The  current  account  deficit  remained  large,  as  nominal  imports  grew \nmore than exports. In 2012 a weaker global environment will likely reduce growth by constraining exports, \nforeign  direct  investment,  and  remittances.  A  key  policy  challenge  is  to  achieve  more  inclusive  growth, \nparticularly  for  rural  areas.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy continued to show robust growth, estimated by the \ngovernment at 7.0% (Figure\u00a03.3.1). Among the productive sectors, about \nhalf the growth came from services, which rose by 5.6% relative to the \nprevious year, because of strong increases in the financial sector, tourism, \nand communications. Another two-fifths came from industry, which \nrose by 9.7% during 2011, as strong external demand and continued \nstructural reforms boosted manufacturing, although mining declined due \nto reduced production of coal, lignite, and peat. The small balance came \nfrom agriculture, which, after 3\u00a0years of decline, rose by 5.5% during the \nyear, reflecting higher crop production as a result of good weather and \nfavorable prices.\n\nOn the demand side, private investment and private consumption \nare both estimated to have contributed to growth, with consumption \nbenefiting from higher remittance inflows, aided by the Russian \nFederation\u2019s healthy economy. Government consumption and investment \nhad little impact, as fiscal consolidation held back government spending, \nwhile net exports had a negative impact (real imports grew far more than \nreal exports).\n\nAlthough average inflation rose to 8.5% from 7.1% in 2010, the \n12-month rate slowed to 2.0% in December, after peaking at 14.3% in \nMay 2011 (Figure\u00a03.3.2), as the moderation in prices of food (domestic \nand imported) and other imports during the second half of the year \noutweighed price hikes for transport and utilities stemming from price \nliberalization.\n\nThe fiscal deficit narrowed to 2.9% of GDP from 6.6% of GDP \nin 2010, consistent with the adjustment program supported by the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Tax revenue rose by 26.0%, reflecting a \nnew tax code, enforcement of new revenue measures, and simplification \nof tax compliance and reporting requirements, all of which took effect \nat the start of the year. Relative to GDP, however, total revenue rose only \nslightly, to 28.4% from 28.3% in 2010, because of declines in grants and \nnontax revenue as a share of GDP.\n\nThis chapter was written by George Luarsabishvili of the Georgia Resident Mission, \nADB, Tbilisi.\n\n3.3.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\nAgriculture\nIndustry\n\n12.3\n\nServices\nNet indirect taxes\n\n6.3\n\n7.0\n\n2.3\n\n-3.8\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia. http://www.\ngeostat.ge (accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.3.2  Inflation \n\nFood\n\nOverall\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nDec\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia. http://www.\ngeostat.ge (accessed 9 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n%\n\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n\f108    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n Spending growth was kept to 4.7%, reflecting compression in capital \n\nexpenditure as well as tighter spending limits on public salaries and \ndefense. Total expenditure fell to 31.3% of GDP from 34.9% in 2010.\n\nTreasury securities, foreign financing, and privatization receipts all \ncontributed to budget financing. Treasury securities\u2014funding 28.4% of \nthe budget deficit in 2011\u2014have emerged in recent\u00a0years as an important \nsource of deficit coverage, and successful issues of treasury notes of up \nto 10\u00a0years\u2019 maturity have become an important step for developing the \nsecondary market for tradable domestic debt. In addition, the successful \nissue of a second sovereign Eurobond (the first was in 2008) reduced the \nrollover risk from external liabilities falling due in 2012 and 2013. Total \ngovernment debt was estimated at 36.8% of GDP at end-2011.\n\nM3 broad money grew by 17.2% (Figure\u00a03.3.3), reflecting a 19.5% rise \n\nin bank credit to the private sector. The central bank\u2019s switch to a more \naccommodative monetary policy in July lowered the policy rate in steps \nfrom 7.5% to 6.5% by January 2012, although heavy dollarization of \nthe banking system limits monetary policy effectiveness. Interest rates \ndeclined on long-term loans, despite strong growth in lari-denominated \nloans and higher credit risk premiums, although the lending rate \nremained high at 19.2%. Deposit interest rates rose slightly to 9.4%, as \nbanks moved to increase deposits by offering competitive interest rates \n(Figure\u00a03.3.4).\n\nBanking stability improved, reflecting a near doubling of banks\u2019 \nreturns on assets and on equity in light of wider profit margins and \na continued high capital-adequacy ratio of about 17%. The ratio of \nnonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 8.6%, partly due to rising \ncredit volumes.\n\nThe current account deficit worsened to an estimated 13.3% of GDP \n\nfrom 11.5% in 2010. The trade deficit widened by an estimated 25% to \n$3.6\u00a0billion (Figure\u00a03.3.5). Exports shot up by 42.3%, reflecting rapid\ngrowth in vehicle reexports to Kazakhstan (in advance of higher customs \nduties, as Kazakhstan\u2014a traditional major market\u2014entered a customs \nunion with Belarus and the Russian Federation in January 2012) and a \nnear doubling of sales of nitric fertilizers due to heavier global demand \nassociated with high food prices. Imports surged by 39.8% (from a larger \nbase than exports), mainly reflecting increased imports of intermediate \ngoods and petroleum products.\n\nStrong remittances and continued surpluses in services\u2014mainly from \n\ntourism (which rose by nearly 39% to $2.5\u00a0billion) and transport\u2014offset\nsome of the deterioration in the trade balance. A 21% rise in foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) inflows to an estimated $981\u00a0million helped finance\nthe larger current account deficit. Gross international reserves climbed \nby 23.5% to $2.8\u00a0billion, equivalent to around 4\u00a0months of imports. Total\nexternal debt, including private debt, fell to an estimated 57.5% of GDP at \nend-2011 from 61.6% the previous year.\n\nThe flexible exchange rate regime continued to provide relative \n\nstability for the external sector. The lari appreciated by 12.2% in \nnominal effective terms and by 8.4% in real effective terms during 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.3.6).\n\n3.3.3  Contributions to money supply (M3) \ngrowth \n\nBroad money (M3)\nNet foreign assets\nNet claims on government\nCredit to the economy\nOther items (net)\n\nPercentage points\n100\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund.

The expected slowdown in the eurozone and the \nRussian Federation will likely limit exports, FDI, and remittances, while \ncontinued fiscal restraint will curtail the government\u2019s ability to augment \ngrowth. Thus growth is projected to slow to 6.0% in 2012, recovering \nsomewhat to 6.3% in 2013 with the assumed improvement in the world \neconomy.\n\nYear-average inflation is projected to slow to 4.8% in 2012, reflecting \n\nthe expected moderation in global food prices. A return to modest \nincreases in global commodity prices should cause only a slight rise in \ninflation to 6.2% in 2013, predicated on limited supply-side pressures and \nthe absence of wage-price spirals.\n\nThe high level of dollarization will continue limiting the scope \nfor monetary policy such that the authorities will need time to push \nthrough with their desired move to inflation targeting. Consistent with \nits adjustment program, the government aims to reduce the budget \ndeficit further to 3.3% in 2012 and to 2.9% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.3.7). Fiscal \nconsolidation will include both current and capital expenditure, with a \ncareful review of subsidies. Total government debt is forecast to nudge up \nto 38.0% of GDP at end-2012 and to 38.2% the following year (Figure\u00a03.3.8).\nThe current account deficit is projected to narrow to 12.5% of GDP \n\nin 2012, with slowing growth expected to reduce imports more than \nexports. Both sides of the trade account are, however, expected to rise in \n2013 with a recovery in the world and domestic economies. As nominal \nGDP is forecast to grow more than the current account deficit, the \ncurrent account deficit as a share of GDP will narrow further in 2013, to \nabout 12.0%.\n\nNegotiations for a long-awaited free trade agreement with the EU \nwere launched in early 2012. An agreement would give Georgia extended \naccess to the EU\u2019s single market, which should improve trade and \ninvestment.\n\nWhile sound macro-prudential policies and fiscal restraint have \nreduced the chances of overheating and speculative bubbles, downside \nrisks remain. These include a continuing large current account deficit; a \nlimited export base with high import content and FDI focused more on \nthe nontradable sector than on exports; heavy dependence on foreign aid \nand borrowing (despite high levels of official borrowing at concessional \nrates); and low private savings. \n\nPolicy therefore needs to promote capital inflows toward productive \ninvestment, particularly in the export sector. Similarly, the government \nneeds to better leverage the country\u2019s investment resources and to \nmaximize the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. These \nmeasures are even more essential given current risks in the international \nfinancial markets, which may hinder availability of private investment \nand concessional financing from development partners.\n\n3.3.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n6.0\n\n4.8\n\n6.3\n\n6.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance \n\n-12.5\n\n-12.0\n\n3.3.7  Fiscal indicators\n\nTax collections\nOther revenue\nTotal expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

One indication of income disparities \nis Georgia\u2019s relatively high Gini coefficient of 0.41, well above 0.31 for \nArmenia and 0.34 for Azerbaijan.\n\nThe government needs to step up its efforts to address structural \nunemployment, which stems from a mismatch between existing human \ncapital and available jobs and which represents an important supply-\nside constraint. While skill inadequacies are an important part of the \nproblem, so too is the limited range of well-paying jobs, in turn reflecting \nthe small size of the tradable goods sector. Structural reforms to promote \ninvestment, particularly in export-oriented industries, could help create \ngreater demand for employment while providing a way to reduce the \nchronic current account deficit in the medium term. At the same time, \naddressing high youth unemployment (35%) by improving skills through \nmore vocational education, progress in secondary education, and \non-the-job training (including the use of new technology) will help create \na supply of employable workers to fill new jobs.\n\nAs job creation in the past was primarily skills-based and concentrated \n\nin finance and services, investing more in labor-intensive sectors such as \nindustry and agriculture would enhance the inclusiveness of economic \ngrowth. About half the workforce is employed in agriculture, which \ncontributes less than 10% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.3.9). Surplus labor in urban \nareas, however, with low levels of labor absorption in agriculture, has made \nit extremely hard for the rural unemployed to move into other sectors. \nThe narrow base of the formal economy in rural areas, where self-\nemployment is associated with subsistence income and low productivity \nin agriculture, contributes to rural poverty. Moreover, the prevalence \nof subsistence income limits the demand of the rural population for \noutputs from other sectors, constraining sectoral diversification of the \neconomy and hindering development spillovers between agricultural and \nnonagricultural activity.\n\nTo help narrow differences between urban and rural development, the \ngovernment has proposed a strategy to promote rural growth. This includes \nincreasing investment in, among others, manufacturing, agriculture \nand renewable energy, in part through public\u2013private partnerships. \nWell-designed public investment in infrastructure\u2014whether in roads, \npower, water supply, or irrigation\u2014would support private investment in \nagroprocessing and other industries, bolstering rural employment and \nreducing a persistent urban bias against agriculture. It would also promote \nthe development of a more export-oriented agricultural sector, to draw on \nGeorgia\u2019s favorable climate and natural resources.\n\nStructural reforms, too, should focus on areas that could improve \nGeorgia\u2019s attractiveness as a place to do business. Although the country \nhas improved its standing in the 2012 Doing Business report from the \nWorld Bank\u2014to 16 out of 183 countries (better than Malaysia, Thailand, \nGermany, and Japan)\u2014it could still benefit by addressing issues in \nresolving insolvency, enforcing contracts, and trading across borders. \nIn addition, improving governance and transparency in business would \npromote productivity and create greater job opportunities.\n\n\fKazakhstan\n\nGood oil sector performance and sizable public investment contributed to robust expansion and a strong \nbalance  of  payments  in  2011.  Growth  is  forecast  to  moderate  in  2012,  reflecting  the  slowdown  expected \nin  Europe  and  the  Russian  Federation,  before  recovering  somewhat  in  2013  as  the  world  economy \nstrengthens. Structurally, the economy remains dependent on oil production and constrained by financial \nsector weakness. Over time growth will depend on the success of the government\u2019s diversification efforts, \nlargely  funded  by  oil  earnings. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth since independence has turned largely on strong oil and gas \nexports. Much of the proceeds have been saved in the National Fund for \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), with portions transferred to the \nbudget to fund public investment. \n\nGlobal recovery helped growth rebound to 7.0% in 2010, and then to \nan estimated 7.5% in 2011, reflecting a surge in agricultural production, a \nstrong upturn in services, and continued government investment in some \nindustries (Figure\u00a03.4.1). Agriculture, hit by a severe drought in 2010, was \naided in 2011 by particularly favorable weather, which helped it grow by \n26.7%. Grain production more than doubled, achieving record yields. \n\nIndustrial output (excluding construction) rose by 3.5%, driven mainly \n\nby a 6.2% increase in manufacturing, due to rapid growth in chemicals, \nmetallurgy, and machinery and vehicles. Mining picked up by about 1.3%. \nOil output fell by 0.5%, affected by social unrest in a key production area, \nalthough gas condensate and natural gas output climbed by 6.1% and \n5.2%, respectively. Construction expanded by 2.7%, reflecting government \nstimulus and investment in infrastructure.\n\nServices rose by 7.7%, driven by strong growth in wholesale and retail \n\ntrade (14.5%), transport and warehousing (6.8%), and communications \n(18.7%). Financial services and insurance contracted by 4.5%, although the \ncredit market expanded for the first time since the global financial crisis. \nReal estate activity slowed to 1.4% from 3.5% in 2010, despite continued \nsupport from the government for residential construction. \n\nOn the demand side, based on 9\u00a0months\u2019 data, total consumption is \n\nestimated to have risen by almost 11%, driven by nearly 18% growth in \ngovernment consumption and a 9% rise in private consumption, as higher \nhousehold income strongly boosted retail trade (Figure\u00a03.4.2).\n\nGross fixed capital formation moved up by an estimated 4.5%, \nunderpinned by higher investment in manufacturing, transport and \nwarehousing, information and communication, and real estate.

Net exports \nrose by about 5%, reflecting higher oil prices. \n\nAverage annual inflation rose to 8.3%, slightly above the target of \n6\u20138% set by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) (Figure\u00a03.4.3). The \nacceleration reflected double-digit increases in food and fuel prices, \ndespite stringent price regulation and efforts to contain fuel prices by \nhaving the national oil and gas company sell imported fuel products at \na loss. Inflation accelerated during the first 8\u00a0months of the year, as food \nprices surged, and then slowed toward year-end. In the year through \nDecember, inflation was 7.4%. \n\nThe fiscal deficit narrowed slightly to 2.1% of GDP, from 2.4% of GDP \n\nin 2010, as revenue growth outpaced the rise in expenditure. Thanks \nto notable\u00a0increases in both tax and nontax receipts\u2014reflecting strong \neconomic growth, higher export duties for oil products and larger receipts \nfrom the Russian Federation under the Customs Union agreement, and \nincreased nontax income (penalties, fines, and dividends)\u2014revenue rose \nby 35.6%. Total revenue, including transfers from the NFRK, remained at \n19.7% of GDP. \n\nReductions in the number of government employees and more \ncareful monitoring of government spending helped limit expenditure to \n21.7% of GDP. Spending for education, health care, and social assistance \nremained at about the same share of GDP as in 2010. Public sector wages \nwere increased by 18\u201324% through November, while pensions and social \nallowances were raised by 30% and 9%, respectively.\n\nBroad money expanded by 15.0% and reserve money by 10.3% owing \nto higher net foreign assets at the NBK and commercial banks. The NBK, \nreversing the easing carried out during the crisis, raised the refinancing \nrate from 7.0% to 7.5% in March 2011 in response to higher inflation and \nmaintained it through year-end. \n\nWith the foreign exchange market supporting the tenge (the national \n\ncurrency), the NBK returned to a managed float regime in March 2011 \nwith limited intervention, buying in the first half of the year and selling \nin the second half, to minimize exchange rate fluctuations (Figure\u00a03.4.4). \nIn nominal terms, the tenge remained largely stable\u00a0against major \ncurrencies and depreciated slightly against its currency basket. The real \nexchange rate, however, appreciated by 5.7% against the dollar and by 1.0% \nagainst the euro because of relative inflation rates, but depreciated by 2.8% \nagainst the Russian ruble toward end-2011, after appreciating between \nAugust and mid-December. \n\nPositive trends in the economy led Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch \nto raise their sovereign ratings by one notch each, to \u0412\u0412\u0412+ and B\u0412\u0412, \nrespectively, in November. But the banking sector remains weak, and \nabout one-third of loans are nonperforming.\n\nIn April the NBK\u2019s role expanded to include financial supervision. \nReserve requirements for banks were increased in May, from 1.5% to 2.5% \non internal liabilities and from 2.5% to 4.5% on other liabilities, to address \nthe high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs).

The NBK will also establish a distressed assets fund to deal \nwith the banks\u2019 bad loans. \n\nThe current account surplus more than tripled to an estimated 7.3% of \nGDP, as the trade surplus surged by 62% to $46.8\u00a0billion. Exports rose by\n46.1%, reflecting high oil prices, while imports grew by 31.8%. The services \naccount improved but still recorded a deficit of $6.1\u00a0billion. In addition,\nthere was a $24.1\u00a0billion payment to direct investors (mostly in the oil and\nmineral sector) and a large outflow from net remittances, estimated at \n$1.3\u00a0billion, as Kazakhstan is a destination for foreign labor (Figure\u00a03.4.5).\nNet foreign direct investment tripled to about $8.8\u00a0billion. Gross\n\nofficial reserves of the NBK rose by $1.05\u00a0billion to $28.8\u00a0billion\nduring the year, while the NFRK\u2019s external assets rose by 43% to \n$43.7\u00a0billion. External debt fell from 79.8% of GDP at end-2010 to 66%\nat end-September, with external private sector debt estimated at 63% of \nGDP, half of which was intracompany debt of multinational subsidiaries \noperating in extractive industries. Government external debt remained \nvery low at about 2.3% of GDP. State enterprises\u2019 debt, which is not \nreported as public debt, exceeds 10% of GDP, and a June 2011 report by \nthe International Monetary Fund noted indications of growing foreign \nborrowing by some enterprises in which SK has holdings. \n\nEconomic prospects \nEconomic growth is projected to slow to 6.0% in 2012, reflecting the \nexpected slowdown in the eurozone and the Russian Federation. It \nshould accelerate to 6.5% in 2013, as the world economy strengthens \n(Figure\u00a03.4.6). Growth could turn out slower if prospects for oil and other \ncommodities worsen, the world outlook deteriorates, or domestic demand \nis weaker than expected. \n\nSizable investments under the Accelerated Program should boost \nmanufacturing and construction, while an expected resurgence of mineral \nprices and minimal decline in oil prices is seen encouraging growth in \npetroleum and mining. Implementation of the Accelerated Program, \nsupplemented by other programs aimed at improving infrastructure and \nproductivity, and at promoting industrial and social modernization, are \nlikely to support growth by easing bottlenecks and boosting domestic \nproducers\u2019 competitiveness. \n\nIntegration into the Common Economic Space (CES) with Belarus \nand the Russian Federation stands to expand trade, particularly if other \ncountries also join. Inflation is projected to decline to 6.5% in 2012 due \nto lower food prices, and then rise slightly to 6.8% in 2013 as food price \ninflation resumes (Figure\u00a03.4.7). The 20% rise in the producer price index \nduring 2011 and the need to harmonize tariffs and prices under the CES \nto higher Russian prices will contribute to inflationary pressures in 2012. \nHowever, the authorities are expected to continue using price regulation, \nsubsidies, and bans on individual products to keep observed inflation \nwithin the 6\u20138% target range.\n\nFiscal policy envisages an increase in the overall budget deficit to \nabout 2.5% of GDP in 2012, as revenue is forecast to decline to about \n19% of GDP, while expenditure as a share of GDP is forecast to fall by \n\n3.4.6  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.4.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n1.0\n\n6.5\n\n6.8\n\n1.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.4.7  Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\f114    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nless than revenue (Figure\u00a03.4.8). The authorities aim to reduce the deficit \nto 1.5% of GDP in 2013 through further tax administration reform (by \nmore extensive auditing, registering the remaining small sellers for \ntax payments, and moving toward universal tax declarations), better \nprocurement methods, and a moratorium on government hiring. \nNevertheless, pensions, social assistance, and wages for the social sector \nwill grow in real terms. \n\nIn January 2012, the President announced a policy change to \nbroaden the NFRK\u2019s objectives with a new investment function. Part \nof the NFRK\u2019s assets will be invested internally to fund government \ndevelopment programs. The NFRK will, for example, lend $4\u00a0billion\n(nearly 2% of GDP) to the national oil and gas company Kazmunaigas in \ntwo tranches, in 2013 and 2015, to accelerate production at the Kashagan \noil field, the world\u2019s largest field discovered in recent decades.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, annual transfers from the NFRK, which are \n\nbudgeted at a fixed amount of around $8\u00a0billion, will be topped up with\nT180\u00a0billion (about $1.2\u00a0billion or 0.6% of GDP) to allow more flexibility\nin meeting or expanding social expenditure without exceeding budget \ndeficit targets. In addition, $300\u00a0million\u2013500\u00a0million (roughly 0.2\u20130.3%\nof GDP) in revenue is expected from sales of shares in state enterprises \nto the population and pension funds through the proposed launch of the \nPeople\u2019s Initial Public Offering Program in 2012. Total government debt \n(excluding state enterprises\u2019 debt) is not expected to exceed 15% of GDP in \n2012 and 2013, a very low rate by international standards.\n\nIn January 2012, 12-month inflation fell to 5.9%, the lowest in \n\nmany\u00a0years. In mid-February, the NBK reduced the refinancing rate by \n0.5% and is considering another decrease in April if inflation remains \nlow. Thus interest rates generally may also decline moderately. As for the \nexchange rate, in the first 2\u00a0months of 2012 the tenge remained stable, \nslightly above 148/$1, and strengthened somewhat after February.\n\nDespite government support to the financial sector, a persistent high \nlevel of NPLs is a major concern and a key constraint to economic growth. \nAt end-2011, banking sector performance was worse (in terms of credit-\nto-GDP and asset-to-GDP ratios, share of NPLs, return on assets, and \nreturn on equity) than at end-2010. In addition, the large BTA Bank, which \nwas recapitalized and restructured in 2009\u20132010, remains in difficulty \nand in January 2012 requested approval for a second restructuring. In this \nsituation, SK\u2014a major shareholder\u2014may be forced to bail out the bank \nusing public money. Over the medium term, NPLs may also rise as a result \nof financial assistance provided through interest-rate subsidies and partial \ncredit guarantees under the government\u2019s Roadmap of Business 2020 \nprogram, which helped increase bank lending in 2011. \n\nThe poor performance of the state pension funds also presents a \nmacroeconomic risk, given the aging population. Between losses on \nexternal assets and poor returns on the more than 40% of their funds \ninvested in low-interest-rate government securities, the funds have lost \nover 20% of their real value during the past 6\u20138\u00a0years and could be hard \nhit if another crisis occurs. \n\nThe current account is forecast to record surpluses of about 1.0\u20131.5% \nof GDP in 2012 and 2013 (Figure\u00a03.4.9).

The \nservices account is set to improve, with completion of the infrastructure \ndevelopment around the Kashagan project and transition to the \nproduction phase. Income-related outflows may also increase, however, as \ncontinued mineral earnings generate higher payments to foreign investors. \nCapital inflows should average about $4\u00a0billion in 2012 and 2013, while\ngross reserves are forecast to reach $32\u00a0billion and $35\u00a0billion at the close of\n2012 and 2013. The NFRK\u2019s assets will grow more slowly than during 2011, \ngiven the government\u2019s intention to invest NFRK resources extensively in \nthe economy, but they will likely exceed $50\u00a0billion at end-2012, offering\nsubstantial resources for future development (Figure\u00a03.4.10).\n\nTotal external debt is forecast to remain at 65\u201370% of GDP at the end \nof this year and next (Figure\u00a03.4.11). The share of intracompany debt will \nremain unchanged and public external debt (excluding state enterprises\u2019 \ndebt) will maintain its traditionally low level.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversifying the economy\nKazakhstan\u2019s dependence on petroleum and mining makes it vulnerable \nto swings in international prices. And it is hard to establish a more \ninclusive growth model, as jobs in petroleum are limited, involving either \nlow-skill employment or a few highly paid, specialized positions. Thus \nsome energy earnings should be spent on developing new, competitive \nindustries that can support a shift away from oil dependence, especially as \nentry into the CES provides access to much broader markets. \n\nTo help diversify its economy, Kazakhstan needs to expand its current \n\nefforts to develop competitive projects under the Accelerated Program \nbased on its comparative advantages (mainly in agriculture, construction \nmaterials, oil and gas refining and infrastructure, metallurgy, chemicals, \npharmaceuticals, defense, and energy development). Such expansion \nwill likely require it to modernize and renovate infrastructure, which \nmay create investment opportunities for specialized private investors in \npublic\u2013private partnerships, including non-oil multinational companies. \nInvestment in infrastructure is needed to attract new technology, both to \naddress a growing electricity deficit and to modernize transport, water \nsupply, and sanitation in order to cut costs and expand services. \n\nThe careful use of government policy instruments\u2014tax incentives, \n\nsubsidies, regulations, and expenditure for activities that support \nindustry\u2014can assist private ventures with good potential, particularly \nin exporting. The experience of Asia\u2019s newly industrialized economies \nsuggests that successful industrial programs are those that have the \ngovernment serving as a facilitator and regulator rather than lead \nimplementer, leaving that function to the market. \n\nAt the same time, scarce resources must not be used to aid \npoorly performing firms or to help vested interests seeking support \nfor unprofitable\u00a0activities. State support should be limited in time, \nsupportive of competition, and terminated when projects fail. In addition, \ngovernment funding should accompany\u2014and not replace\u2014broader \nreforms in governance and regulation, as well as efforts to build human \ncapital by strengthening education and training. \n\n3.4.10  Gross official reserves and assets of \nthe National Oil Fund\nAssets \n\nReserves\n\n10\n\n08\n\n11\n\n09\n\n2007\n\n13\n12\nForecast\nSources: National Bank of Kazahkstan. http://www.\nnationalbank.kz (accessed 23 March 2012).

A  new  government  has  been  set \nup,  public  confidence  is  slowly  returning,  and  all  sectors  have  seen  growth.  Improved  tax  administration \nand  high  gold  prices  increased  government  revenue,  but  higher  civil  service  wages  and  social  spending, \nalongside  continuing  reconstruction  in  the  south,  strained  overall  finances.  Integration  into  the  customs \nunion  with  the  Russian  Federation,  Belarus,  and  Kazakhstan  may  be  a  challenge,  with  risks  of  inflation \npressures,  unemployment,  and  trade  disruptions.\n\nEconomic performance\nFollowing a sluggish first quarter, real growth picked up as the year \nprogressed, reaching 5.7% for 2011 (Figure\u00a03.5.1). All sectors showed robust \ngains, reflecting improved security and sustained public confidence after \nthe events of April 2010, which saw the ouster of the president and ethnic \nviolence in the south.\n\nAgriculture showed a modest bounceback to 2.3% growth, following \n\nits 2.6% contraction in 2010. Land under cultivation increased by 9%, \nbecause shortages of fuel and financing were less severe than in 2010, \nalthough a drought in the south kept grain production stagnant.\nIndustry expanded by 8.8%, with growth in nearly all major \n\nsubsectors (Figure\u00a03.5.2). Manufacturing grew by 9.8%, or 18.8% excluding \ngold production, which declined slightly year on year due to low gold \nconcentration in ore extracted during the year. Textile and chemical \nindustries grew especially fast, reflecting the resumption of trade with the \nRussian Federation and Kazakhstan (disrupted by the crisis). However, \nfood processing declined, reflecting the previous year\u2019s fall in agricultural \nproduction and the weak recovery in 2011. Also within industry, \nconstruction declined by 3.9%\u2014adding to the 18.5% fall in 2010\u2014\nreflecting a slow recovery of private sector confidence and the continuing \npostponement of several large projects that were put on hold in 2010.\n\nThe services sector, which fell sharply in 2010 following the political \nevents, rebounded by 5.2%, reflecting improved consumer sentiment and \nthe reopening of borders with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. (The borders \nwere closed periodically after April 2010. By October that year the border \nwith Kazakhstan was largely reopened, and in October 2011 Uzbekistan \nreopened an important border crossing.) Most of its subsectors saw \ngrowth, including trade, hotels and restaurants, and transport and \ncommunications, although real estate contracted by 1.7% on continuing \nfears of socioeconomic turbulence.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption is estimated to have grown \n\nby 4.5%, reflecting a notable rise in retail sales, despite a small increase \n\nThis chapter was written by Gulkayr Tentieva of the Kyrgyz Resident Mission, ADB, \nBishkek.\n\n3.5.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\nPercentage points \n\n8.5\n\n8.4\n\n5.7\n\n2.9\n\n-0.5\n\n09\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n11\nSource: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n10\n\n3.5.2  Growth in industry subsectors\n\nMining\nManufacturing\n\nElectricity, gas, and water\nConstruction\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n%\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKyrgyz Republic    117\n\nin unemployment. The growth in consumption was driven largely \nby returning consumer confidence and an increase in remittances to \n$1.4\u00a0billion, equivalent to 25% of GDP, reflecting more Kyrgyz migrants\nworking in the Russian Federation in 2011.\n\nPrivate investment is estimated to have fallen by a further 16%, \nafter a 23% decline in 2010. By contrast, the growth rate of government \ninvestment roughly doubled to an estimated 16%, reflecting continued \nspending to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure in the south.\n\nConsumer prices rose by 16.6% on a year-average basis, mainly \n\nbecause of rapid price increases during the first half of the year. Inflation \nslowed during the second half, and the 12-month (December over \nDecember) rise in the consumer price index was only 5.6% (Figure\u00a03.5.3).\nFood prices, which rose by 25.9%, were the main driver of inflation; \n\nnonfood prices rose by 10.3%. The slowdown in inflation during the \nsecond half of the year largely reflected good harvests in the Russian \nFederation and Kazakhstan, which lowered the cost of imported food, \nalong with the impact of tighter monetary policy.\n\nThe overall budget deficit rose slightly, to 7.6% of GDP, as increases in \ntax revenue offset higher social\u2014but not capital\u2014spending (Figure\u00a03.5.4).\nGovernment revenue rose by around 30%, reflecting strong economic \n\ngrowth, high gold prices, and reforms in tax policy and administration, \nincluding improved customs valuation, higher excise tax yields, a stronger \nlarge taxpayer unit, and more effective audit procedures. Total revenue \nand grants reached 32.2% of GDP.\n\nGovernment spending rose by 34%, reflecting higher government \ngrants, wages, and social outlays to raise pensions toward the national \nsubsistence level. Total expenditure reached 39.7% of GDP, and total \npublic and publicly guaranteed debt\u2014external and domestic\u2014declined to \n52% of GDP at end-2011.\n\nExtensive dollarization of the economy and a shallow financial sector \n\nlimit the impact of monetary policy in the country. Still, in 2011 the \nNational Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic raised its policy rate steadily over \nthe year, from 5.5% to 13.5%. Credit growth in the broad financial system \naccelerated to 19.2% from 18.2% in 2010, reflecting in part the lagged \nimpact of earlier expansionary policy and the low reserve requirement \nset by the central bank in 2010. Commercial banks were responsible for \nmost of the increased lending. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total \ncredit portfolio declined, from 13.8% to 9.8%. Higher nominal interest rates \ncontributed to the local currency\u2019s appreciation from March to August.\nThe current account deficit narrowed slightly to 6.8% of GDP from \n8.0% in 2010, despite higher imports, reflecting a less negative income \nbalance and stronger remittances, which reached 25% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.5.5).\nTrade rebounded strongly, after the fall in 2010 due to the border \n\nclosures. Exports are estimated to have grown by 31.1%, with gold \nremaining the largest item. Imports grew by an estimated 34.4%, mainly \nreflecting higher imports of gasoline and diesel fuel. The Commonwealth \nof Independent States countries remained the largest trading partners, \nwith 64% of trade volume.\n\nForeign direct investment fell by 14% reflecting continued weak \n\ninvestor confidence. Nevertheless, net international reserves rose by 7% to \n$1.8\u00a0billion.\n\n3.5.3  Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\n\nFood\n\nNonfood\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. http://www.\nnbkr.kg (accessed 15 March 2012). \nClick here for figure data\n\n3.5.4  Budget indicators\n\nBudget deficit\nGrants\nDomestic revenue\nCapital expenditure\nCurrent expenditure\n\nER\n2007\n\nER\n08\n\nER\n09\n\nER\n10\n\nER\n11\n\nR = Revenue; E = Expenditure.\nNote: Domestic revenue includes capital receipts.\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2009.

With the restoration of public confidence and political \nstability, higher domestic demand and stronger investor confidence are \nexpected to spur private sector activity in the non-gold sectors. Against \nthis, the adverse impact of the eurozone recession on Kazakhstan and \nthe Russian Federation\u2014key trading partners and sources of worker \nremittances\u2014will inhibit growth. Private transfers are expected to stay \naround 20\u201325% of GDP, however.\n\nGrowth is expected to be driven by the industry and services sectors. \n\nGovernment plans to provide subsidized loans to farmers in 2012 are \nexpected to promote growth in agriculture.\n\nLarge investment projects in infrastructure will drive construction, \n\nsuch as rehabilitating major road networks and building new power \ngrids. Many other projects, including additional power grids and \nhydropower plants, remain under negotiation.\n\nPrivate consumption growth is forecast at 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively, \n\nin 2012 and 2013, although continuing tensions in the south could \njeopardize these increases. Net exports are likely to show little growth, \nas slower growth in the country\u2019s main trading partners\u2014the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the \neurozone, point to only modest prospects for exports.\n\nYear-average inflation is expected to continue decelerating, to \n5.0% in 2012, reflecting tighter fiscal and monetary policies and likely \nmoderation in the prices for imported food (Figure\u00a03.5.7). Inflation is \nforecast to rise to 5.5% in 2013, on expected price increases for imported \nfood.\n\nThe government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 7.3% of GDP \nor less in the next 2\u00a0years, in order to improve debt sustainability and \ncontain inflation pressures. These lower deficits would likely maintain \nthe ratio of total public debt to GDP at 52\u201353% in the forecast period.\nRecent government announcements signal plans to continue \nimproving tax administration and customs collection. Revenue is \ntargeted to reach 32\u201333% of GDP over the forecast period.\n\nOn the spending side, cuts for operations, along with a planned 20% \n\nreduction in the civil service headcount this year, are forecast to offset \nthe impact of higher pensions and other socially oriented expenditures. \nTotal expenditure is forecast at 39.6% of GDP in 2012 and 38.7% in 2013.\n\nMonetary policy should remain conservative, reflecting central bank \nsupport of fiscal policy to mitigate inflation pressures. Nominal interest \nrates are likely to stay within the 13\u201315% band, contributing to further \nappreciation of the local currency this year.\n\nThe current account balance is projected to improve somewhat to \na deficit of 6.6% of GDP in 2012 before returning to and 6.8% in 2013 \n(Figure\u00a03.5.8). Following the sharp recovery in 2011, export growth is \nforecast to moderate to 11.8% and then to 7.7% in 2013, as predicted \nslower growth in Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation weaken \ndemand for the country\u2019s exports. Import growth is forecast to ease to \n10.4% and 9.2%, respectively, reflecting increasing domestic production \nof foodstuffs, continuing but slower remittance growth, and moderating \nimported food prices in 2012.\n\n3.5.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\n-6.6\n\n5.5\n\n5.5\n\n-6.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.5.6  GDP growth\n\n%\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n%\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 1 March 2012); ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.5.7  Inflation \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. http://www.\nnbkr.kg (accessed 15 March 2012); ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.5.8  Current account balance\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. http://www.\nnbkr.kg (accessed 15 March 2012); ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKyrgyz Republic    119\n\n3.5.9  External debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n08\n\n11\n\n09\n\n10\n\n2007\n\n12\n13\nForecast\nSources: The Ministry of Finance; National Statistics \nCommittee. http://www.stat.kg; National Bank of the \nKyrgyz Republic. http://www.nbkr.kg (both accessed \n15\u00a0March 2012); ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\nForeign direct investment inflows will largely depend on the \ngovernment pushing through with its proposed structural reforms, \nwhich include a reduction in business licenses as part of a broader effort \nto reduce regulatory burdens on activity. The ratio of total external debt \nto GDP is expected to remain relatively stable at around 48\u201349% in the \nforecast period (Figure\u00a03.5.9).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014joining the customs union\nAlthough economic activity is recovering after the crisis of 2010, political \nstability and investor confidence still need strengthening. As investments \nhave been falling, the government is considering providing new tax \nincentives to investors. Unless substantial new investment is generated, \nthis move could raise the fiscal deficit and increase the debt-to-GDP \nratio.\n\nOver the longer term, the planned accession of the Kyrgyz Republic \n\ninto the customs union that Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Russian \nFederation inaugurated in January 2012 poses major challenges to the \neconomy. Entry into the customs union would make the country subject \nto new common external tariffs, which are generally higher than those \nnow in force in the Kyrgyz Republic. These new tariffs would raise the \nprice, and reduce the volume, of \u201cshuttle trade\u201d products, which consist \nlargely of textiles reexported from the People\u2019s Republic of China to the \nRussian Federation and Kazakhstan. The shuttle trade was estimated to \ncontribute 3\u20134% of GDP in 2005\u20132009.\n\nThe terms of accession, including the common external tariffs, \nare being discussed. The government is concerned that premature \naccession may entail job losses and is seeking measures to mitigate \nthe possible negative economic effects. Conflicts between customs \nunion arrangements and the country\u2019s obligations as a World Trade \nOrganization member also need to be resolved.\n\n\fTajikistan\n\nUnderpinned  by  record-high  remittance  inflows  and  supported  by  expansion  in  agriculture,  services,  and \nindustry, growth accelerated in 2011, continuing the recovery to precrisis levels. Inflation remained high for \nmost  of  2011  but  gradually  eased  toward  year-end.  In  the  short  and  medium  term,  continued  moderate \ngrowth is forecast, but heavy reliance on remittances and public investment as drivers of demand-driven \ngrowth  alongside  extremely  low  private  investment  may  not  be  sustainable.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated to 7.4% (from 6.5% in 2010), reflecting strong \ndomestic demand and expanding agriculture, services, and industry, \ndespite limited electricity supply and disruptions to rail transit through \nneighboring countries that held back output in the first half (Figure\u00a03.6.1).\n\nDriven by record remittances, services were the main driver of \ngrowth, expanding by 13.5%. Agriculture grew by 7.9%, despite difficult \nclimatic conditions. Cotton production shot up by 34%, reflecting a 30% \nrise in the area devoted to cotton, as high international prices encouraged \nadditional planting. Other crops, particularly fruits and vegetables, also \nshowed double-digit growth.\n\nIndustry grew by 5.9%, encompassing a wide variation between a \nmore than 38% increase in mining and extraction industries and a 16% \ncontraction in aluminum output caused by disruptions to alumina \nimports and reduced electricity generation in the early part of the year.\n\nConsumption, reflecting higher imports, was the main source of growth \n\non the demand side. Private investment showed little expansion, and its \nshare in GDP remained extremely low at about 3%. Domestic investment \nwas dominated by the government through state-owned enterprises.\n\nRising global food and fuel prices and higher remittances (which \nboosted domestic demand for imports) nearly doubled year-average \ninflation to 12.5% from 6.5% in 2010, although core inflation (excluding \nfood and fuel) remained moderate at 5.7%.\n\nIncreases in export duties for oil products imposed by Tajikistan\u2019s \nmain supplier, the Russian Federation, in the first half of 2011 raised fuel \nprices by 59%. Food price inflation peaked in that half in response to \nrising world prices (Figure\u00a03.6.2), with staple foods rising by an average \nof 32%, before slowing in the second. Massive public expenditure on \ninfrastructure and special projects to commemorate the 20th anniversary \nof Tajikistan\u2019s independence added to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe overall budget deficit widened to 3.1% of GDP, although the \nmore narrowly defined fiscal deficit (excluding foreign-financed public \ninvestment projects) was less than 1% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.6.3).\n\nThis chapter was written by Kakhorjon Aminov of the Tajikistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nDushanbe.\n\n3.6.1  GDP growth by sector\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture \n\nIndustry\n\n7.8\n\n7.9\n\n3.9\n\n6.5\n\n7.4\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: International Monetary Fund; Tajikistan State \nStatistics Agency. http://www.stat.tj (accessed 15\u00a0March \n2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n3.6.2  Monthly inflation\n\nFood\n\nOverall\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nJan\n12\n\nSource: Tajikistan State Statistics Agency. http://www.stat.tj \n(accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nServices\n%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n%\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nTajikistan    121\n\nAlthough high dollarization and an underdeveloped financial market \n\n3.6.4  Public and publicly guaranteed debt \n\nRevenue receipts exceeded the budget target, with tax collection \nsurging by 30% from 2010, reflecting high prices for key exports and \nincreased imports. Nevertheless, a narrow tax base and heavy dependence \non import-based taxes contributed to a fragile fiscal position. Total \nrevenue equaled 24.4% of GDP.\n\nGovernment expenditure, in particular capital spending on \n\ninfrastructure, rose by close to 30%, reflecting strong revenue and heavy \nforeign financing. Government investment surged by 41%, with increased \nspending focused on energy and transport infrastructure projects, \nincluding rehabilitation of the massive Roghun hydropower plant. \nSpending for social insurance and social protection grew by about 7%, as \nthe state budget focused on capital outlays. Total expenditure amounted \nto 27.6% of GDP.\n\nAlthough the stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt \n\nclimbed, rapid GDP growth reduced the ratio of public and publicly-\nguaranteed debt to GDP to 33.3% from 36.5% in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.6.4). \nPotential contingent liabilities for state enterprises and the financial \nsector continued to raise questions about fiscal sustainability over the \nmedium term.\n\nundermined such moves\u2019 effectiveness, the National Bank of Tajikistan \n(NBT) pursued contractionary monetary policy during much of the \nyear to curb inflation, raising its refinancing rate from 8.25% to 9.0% in \nFebruary and again to 10.0% in October 2011. Yet reserve money still \ngrew by more than 27% during the year, reflecting the recovery of private \nsector credit and considerable liquidity support from the central bank to \ncommercial banks. \n\nSince late December, with inflation slowing, the NBT has relaxed \npolicy somewhat, lowering the refinancing rate in two steps to 9.0% by \nFebruary 2012, to stimulate the economy.\n\nAlthough financial sector indicators improved somewhat, more \nthan 15% of loans remained nonperforming. The sector is constrained \nby limited private investment, few deposits, and exposure to risky \nagricultural loans. The exchange rate of the somoni, the local currency, \ndepreciated by more than 8% against the US dollar and Russian ruble and \n10% against the euro in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.6.5).\n\nThe current account switched to a 4.1% of GDP deficit, after a 2.1% \nsurplus in 2010. High remittances helped boost imports by about 20%, \nbut exports picked up by only 5.2%, widening the trade deficit to over \n$2\u00a0billion. The limited production base, noncompetitive products, and\na focus on a few export commodities\u2014mainly aluminum and cotton\u2014\nlimited export growth. Import growth largely reflected surges in food \nproducts (38%) and textiles (27%), as well as industrial products (13%).\n\nAfter hitting a trough in 2009\u20132010 of less than $20\u00a0million, foreign\ndirect investment edged up to an estimated $30\u00a0million in 2011, but even\nthis was very low. The government continued borrowing for energy and \ntransport infrastructure projects. Gross reserves climbed to $582\u00a0million\nat end-2011, equivalent to 2\u00a0months of imports, from $476\u00a0million at\nend-2010. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt declined to 31.3% \nof GDP at end-2011, compared with 34.4% of GDP a year earlier.\n\n3.6.3  Fiscal balance\nIncluding PIP\n\nExcluding PIP\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nPIP = public investment program.\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2010.

Large \nremittances should boost consumption, maintaining sizable consumer \nimports and helping finance higher public investment through increased \ntax revenue. Although the overall outlook for exports is uncertain, \nconstruction of an international power line and the signing of an \nexport agreement in 2011 should boost summer exports of electricity to \nAfghanistan in 2012 and 2013.\n\nOutput projections are less certain on the supply side. Moreover, \nthe economy will remain prone to risks from recurrent shocks such as \ndrought, natural disasters, and regional trade and political disputes.\nAgriculture\u2019s performance will depend heavily on cotton output, \nwhich could expand further if global cotton prices stay high. Industry \n(including construction) and services will continue to fuel growth \nbut at slower rates than in 2011 because of continued problems in the \npower sector, limited supplies of inputs, and aging production facilities, \nparticularly in aluminum.\n\nInflation is forecast to stay around 8.5\u20139.0% in the next 2\u00a0years \n\n(Figure\u00a03.6.7), as upward pressures on nonfood prices from higher imports \nand other factors offset the impact of moderating food prices. The \nRussian Federation is considering exempting from export duties only a \nfraction of oil products exported to Tajikistan, so inflation pressures from \nhigh fuel prices will persist in 2012. Additional pressure is likely to come \nif the government proceeds with plans to raise electricity tariffs.\n\nAlthough the narrowly defined fiscal deficit is projected to remain \naround 0.5% of GDP, the overall deficit may widen beyond the forecast \n5.5% of GDP. Slowing export growth may limit revenue. On the other \nhand, any increase in revenue will likely encourage a corresponding rise \nin expenditure, mainly for infrastructure, which would add to external \nborrowing under the public debt management framework.\n\nThe government plans to expand reforms in social assistance \nprograms, which remain highly inefficient and poorly designed to the \nneeds of the most vulnerable social groups. Tajikistan is unlikely to \nmeet its Millennium Development Goal targets by 2015, although the \ngovernment aims to focus more on investment strategies for more \ninclusive growth through initiatives to improve access to health care and \neducation, including universal access to education for girls.\n\nContinuing large consolidated deficits are expected to raise the public \ndebt-to-GDP ratio to 37.3% by end-2012 and 37.8% a year later, which could \nprove risky in view of the possible recurrence of shocks to the economy.\n\nDespite persisting inflation, monetary policy may need to reflect more \n\nof a balance between supporting economic recovery and ensuring price \nstability, given the expected slowdown in growth and the limited volume \nof loanable funds for the economy. Slowing inflation has already led the \ncentral bank to reduce the refinancing rate from 9.8% in December 2011 \nto 9.0% in February 2012, and it may follow with further steps to more \nexpansionary monetary policy. Weak external performance is expected to \nput further downward pressure on the national currency.\n\n3.6.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n5.5\n\n8.5\n\n-7.0\n\n6.0\n\n9.0\n\n-6.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.6.6  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; Tajikistan State \nStatistics Agency. http://www.stat.tj (accessed 15\u00a0March \n2012); ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.6.7  Inflation\n\n09\n\n11\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n13\n12\nForecast\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2011.

Export \nreceipts are projected to fall as a result of declining international prices \nfor cotton and other exports. Imports, though, should remain at least at \nthe current level because of higher remittances (Figure\u00a03.6.9).\n\nThe government is likely to continue external borrowing to finance \n\ninfrastructure projects, mainly in energy and transport. However, \nthe above-mentioned debt management framework requires all new \ngovernment borrowings to have at least a 35% grant element and to limit \nborrowings to priority projects. Total public debt is projected to stay \nbelow 40% of GDP over the foreseeable future.\n\nForeign direct investment inflows are projected to continue rising \ngradually over the medium term, in line with current reform initiatives in \ntax administration and regulatory simplification. The bulk of investments \nwill likely go to several large infrastructure projects, such as hydropower \nstations, toll roads, and supporting facilities for mining. Public and \npublicly guaranteed external debt is forecast to reach 37.2% of GDP at \nend-2012 and 37.5% of GDP 12\u00a0months later.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014boosting investment\nA big concern remains the very limited share of private investment and \nforeign direct investment inflows, and more generally, a weak business \nenvironment and problems in the financial sector. The government relies \nextensively on public investment, an approach that may be unsustainable \ngiven the limited room for additional budget outlays. The private sector \nstill represents less than half of GDP\u2014and private investment less than \n5%\u2014reflecting an unfavorable business environment and lack of investor \nconfidence. Most private enterprises are still small or of medium size and \nrequire little capital, operating in areas such as trade and services.\n\nSerious efforts are necessary to reverse the lack of investor confidence \n\nand declining levels of private investment. Reducing risks to private \ninvestors\u2014by providing and then enforcing property rights, for example, \nby reducing corruption, and by enhancing supportive infrastructure\u2014is \ncritical. Improving the security situation at the border with Uzbekistan, \nwhere clashes between border guards have closed an important rail line, \nand maintaining macroeconomic stability would also encourage private \ninvestment inflows.\n\nDifficult business regulations also discourage private investment. \nDespite being among the top 10 reformers in the World Bank\u2019s 2010 and \n2011 Doing Business reports, in the 2012 report Tajikistan still ranks 147 \namong 183 economies in the ease of doing business. Tax administration \nis complicated and time consuming, while the tax burden is high and \nencourages tax evasion. Limited financial intermediation and costly \nbusiness financing are also major barriers. Addressing inefficiency, \neliminating directed lending, and promoting competition by allowing \ninternational banks to enter the market could facilitate more lending and \nhelp cut financing costs. \n\nOverall, understanding and eliminating key constraints to private \n\ninvestment, including deterrents to foreign investment, is critical to \nachieve sustainable economic growth in the medium term.\n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nGrowth  continued  at  nearly  double-digit  levels  in  2011,  reflecting  a  sharp  rise  in  gas  exports  and  sizable \npublic  investment.  A  similar  rate  is  expected  in  2012,  through  planned  expansion  of  gas  pipelines,  but \ngrowth may moderate in 2013. Diversifying the economy in order to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on \nenergy  exports  and  deepening  the  reform  process  remain  key  policy  challenges. \n\nEconomic performance\nTurkmenistan recorded strong growth in 2011, driven largely by \nhydrocarbon exports and an ambitious public investment program. The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) put growth at 9.9% (Figure\u00a03.7.1).\nOn the demand side, the government reported that gas exports\u2014\nthe mainstay of the economy\u2014shot up by 75.2%, reflecting a 42.5% rise \nin production and the expansion of pipeline capacity to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Total \ninvestment under the National Program of Socio-Economic Development \n2011\u201330, a long-term program to modernize the country\u2019s economy, rose \nby 23.2%, according to government estimates. The IMF estimated that \ngross investment reached 60% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.7.2).\n\nOn the supply side, the government reported all sectors showing \ngrowth. Industry grew fastest (24.2%), followed by construction (12.5%), \ntrade (8.9%), services (8.1%), and transport and communications (8.0%). \nAgriculture also expanded.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policies and higher global commodity prices \naugmented inflationary pressures, although price controls and subsidies \nfor basic goods and utilities, along with a stable exchange rate, kept \ninflation to an estimated 6.1%.\n\nAn accurate assessment of the fiscal situation is difficult because of \nsizable extrabudgetary operations, including funding for public investment. \nNevertheless, the state budget was reported to have recorded a surplus \n(Figure\u00a03.7.3). The government reported a 48% rise in revenue, reflecting \nthe growth in gas exports, while spending was reported to have climbed by \n37%, with three-fourths of budget expenditure devoted to the social sector. \nControl by the government over monetary policy and commercial bank \nactivity remains significant. Banks and the government receive central \nbank credit at concessional interest rates, and directed lending is extensive.\n\nThe IMF estimates that the surge in gas exports narrowed the external \n\ncurrent account deficit to about 2.9% of GDP from an estimated 11.7% in \n2010, despite a large rise in imports, particularly for public investment. \nAlthough the country accumulates substantial foreign exchange reserves, \nexternal debt is believed to have risen sharply, from 2.6% of GDP at \nend-2009 to 20.5% at end-2011.\n\nThis chapter was written by Jennet Hojanarazova of the Turkmenistan Resident Mission, \nADB, Ashgabat.\n\n3.7.1  GDP growth \n\n%\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2011.

GDP growth of 10.0% is forecast in 2012, \nreflecting further expansion of pipeline capacity to the PRC and large public \ninvestment. Somewhat slower growth (about 9%) is anticipated in 2013.\nThe government intends to widen its export destinations, and a \nprivate firm\u2019s audit of gas deposits, released in October 2011, confirmed \nreserves of up to 26.2\u00a0trillion cubic meters, among the world\u2019s largest. \nBesides existing pipelines to the PRC, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and \nthe Russian Federation, a new pipeline under construction since 2010 \nis intended to connect the country\u2019s eastern fields with the Caspian Sea \nand facilitate exports to Europe. Plans are also under way for a pipeline \nproject from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India agreed in \nDecember 2010, although security remains an issue.\n\nOver time Turkmenistan will benefit from enhanced cooperation \nand trade with neighboring countries. The North\u2013South railway line, \nscheduled for completion by 2014, will improve its access to Kazakhstan, \nthe Gulf, the Russian Federation, and South Asia. This line could become \nthe region\u2019s main route for transporting goods such as petroleum, \nminerals, agricultural products, and textiles.\n\nThe state budget for 2012 projects a small deficit\u2014financed \nby transferring the 2011 surplus\u2014caused by increased spending. \nExpansionary fiscal policies will likely add to inflation, which is forecast \nto reach 7.0% by 2013 (Figure\u00a03.7.4). Continued growth in gas exports is \nexpected to move the current account to a surplus of 3.4% of GDP in 2012 \nand 2013 (Figure\u00a03.7.5).\n\nPolicy challenge highlights\nHydrocarbon products account for over 90% of exports, and high \nspecialization in energy exports entails risks for sustainable economic \ndevelopment. The government has already taken some steps through \nthe National Program of Socio-Economic Development to diversify the \neconomy, aiming to develop agriculture, food processing and other agro-\nindustry, textiles, chemicals and petrochemicals, electricity generation, \ntourism, and construction materials.\n\nSubstantial diversification will require extensive supply-side reforms. \n\nNumerous structural measures will be needed to free private firms \nfrom the state planning system\u2019s disincentives. An adequate legal and \nregulatory framework for private businesses must be in place, along with \nan expanded and restructured banking sector that can provide financial \ncapital and channel profits and savings from hydrocarbons to investment \nin other sectors.\n\nEfficient resource allocation is also crucial. A long-term investment \n\nplan, with careful prioritization and sequencing of investments and \ncost-benefit analysis, must ensure that resource wealth is allocated to \nviable projects.\n\n3.7.3  General government fiscal balance \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2011.

With  lower \nnon-oil commodity prices in 2012, economic growth will be sustained by public investment and increasing \nforeign investment. The key downside risk is a deteriorating economic environment in the euro 20 and the \nRussian  Federation.  To  reduce  risks  from  reliance  on  commodity  exports,  the  economy  needs  to  diversify \nbeyond  the  natural  resources  sectors  and  expand  the  private  sector.\n\nEconomic performance\nReflecting the favorable external environment, sustained public \ninvestment, and rising private consumption bolstered by remittances, \nUzbekistan\u2019s strong economic performance continued in 2011 with GDP \ngrowth of 8.3% (Figure\u00a03.8.1). As in previous years, industry (including \nconstruction) and services were the main contributors to GDP growth, \nwith estimated growth rates of 6.7% and 12.7%, respectively.\n\nIndustrial growth declined to 6.7% from 8.3% in 2010, mainly due to a \nslowdown in the fuel subsector, where a decline in natural gas output kept \ngrowth to 0.3%. Nevertheless, all subsectors grew collectively by 11.9%, \nin particular machinery and equipment, chemicals and petrochemicals, \nconstruction materials, and the food industry, reflecting strong external \ndemand for metals and petrochemicals and continued industrial \ndevelopment. Construction grew by 8.5%, reflecting higher public \nconstruction, which offset a slowdown in foreign investment-related \nconstruction activities.\n\nAs in 2010, services were again a main source of growth, with retail \n\ntrade, communications, and financial services recording a combined \ngrowth rate of 22.3%, supported by strong domestic demand, in \nparticular, rising private consumption. The agricultural sector grew \nby 6.6%, supported by fruit and vegetable production and livestock \nbreeding.\n\nOn the demand side, rising remittances, increased domestic lending, \n\nand wage and pension hikes boosted private consumption. Gross fixed \ncapital formation increased by 11% in nominal terms, to 26% of GDP, \nas bank lending for investment rose by one-third (Figure\u00a03.8.2). Most \ninvestment went to industry, for purchases of capital goods.\n\nEstimates of inflation range from the government\u2019s 7\u20139% to 13.1% \n\nfrom the International Monetary Fund, with the latter above 2010\u2019s \noutturn of 9.4%. Inflation in 2011 reflected public sector and pension \nincreases in August and December, totaling 26.5% since December 2010, \nwith high foreign exchange inflows, rapid credit growth, local currency \ndepreciation, and increased private and public spending.\n\nThis chapter was written by Iskandar Gulamov of the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nTashkent.\n\n3.8.1  GDP growth (supply)\n\nGDP \n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n9.5\n\n9.0\n\n8.1\n\n8.5\n\n8.3\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: State Statistics Committee of Uzbekistan; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.8.2  Structure of nominal GDP \n(expenditure)\n\nFinal consumption\nFixed capital investment\nNet exports\nOthers\n\n%\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n08\n\n10\n\n11\n\n2007\n\n09\nNote: Others refer to statistical discrepancy and changes \nin stocks.\nSources: Center for Economic Research.

Revenue gains from higher commodity prices and improved tax \nadministration (taking revenue to an estimated 38.5% of GDP, from 37.1% \nin 2010) offset the impact on spending of wage and pension increases, \nhigher social outlays, and the rural development program (overall \nexpenditure climbed to 35.3% of GDP, from 34.4% in 2010).\n\nThe central bank\u2019s issuance of certificates of deposit helped reduce \n\nbroad money growth from 52.4% in 2010 to a still high 27.7%. Banks \nbenefited from heavy government injections aimed at strengthening \ntheir capital and increasing lending. Bank lending to small and medium-\nsized enterprises and private entrepreneurs reached $2.8\u00a0billion, a 50%\nincrease from 2010. In August 2011, Moody\u2019s reconfirmed its rating for the \nbanking system as stable, following an upgrade a year earlier.\n\nThe central bank continued to intervene in the foreign exchange \nmarket, with the aim of depreciating the local currency\u2014the sum\u2014to \npromote competitiveness. Depreciation of the Russian ruble and Kazakh \ntenge against the US dollar added downward pressure on the exchange \nrate. By year-end the sum depreciated by 8.6% against the dollar, more \nthan in 2009 and 2010 (Figure\u00a03.8.3).\n\nAn improved trade balance and higher remittances helped raise the \ncurrent account surplus to 8.1% of GDP from 6.6% in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.8.4). \nExports of goods and services rose by 28.6% to $15.6 billion, as\ninternational prices for gold, cotton, copper, and natural gas reached \nrecord levels, and strong consumer demand in the Russian Federation \ncontributed to a 25% rise in automobile exports by GM Uzbekistan.\nImports of goods and services rose by 26.5% to $14.0\u00a0billion, as\ncontinued state-led public infrastructure development and industrial \nmodernization required more imported capital goods. Remittances \ngrew sharply, particularly from the Russian Federation, as the Russian \neconomy improved.\n\nThe government reported foreign investment inflows of $2.9\u00a0billion,\nof which 79% was for foreign direct investment (FDI), mainly in the fuel, \nenergy, petrochemical, and automobile manufacturing sectors. External \ndebt is estimated to have risen to 17.5% of GDP from 14.7% of GDP at \nend-2010, as the public investment program is increasingly being financed \nwith foreign loans (Figure\u00a03.8.5).\n\n3.8.3  Exchange rate\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nMar\n12\n\nSource: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. http://www.cbu.uz/ \n(accessed 28 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.8.4  Current account indicators\n\nMerchandise exports\nMerchandise imports\n\nCurrent account\nbalance\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2011.

Industrial output will be supported by higher domestic lending \nand foreign investment, while services will be driven by higher domestic \ndemand, especially from the public sector. Higher vegetable and fruit \noutput should boost agriculture relative to 2011.\n\nOn the demand side, continued public investment should be a \nkey driver. Gross fixed capital formation is forecast to rise by 9.3% in \n2012 in nominal terms, with investment exceeding 30% of GDP. The \ngovernment is implementing a $47.3 billion Industrial Modernization\nand Infrastructure Development Program in 2011\u20132015, with significant \ninvestment planned in oil and gas, electricity generation, chemicals, \nmetallurgy, and other strategic sectors.\n\nDomestic consumption will be supported by expected increases in \npublic sector wages and pensions, and additional measures\u2014probably \nfurther wage increases and welfare payments\u2014are likely to be taken if \nthe slowdown in the eurozone and the Russian Federation appears to \nbe hampering growth. Nevertheless, lower remittances are expected to \nmoderate growth in private consumption, which is forecast to rise, in \nnominal terms, by 8.0% in 2012 and 9.0% in 2013.\n\nInflation is expected to come in at about 9.5% in 2012 and 9.0% in \n2013, as global commodity prices decline, although continuing currency \ndepreciation will keep import prices high (Figure\u00a03.8.6). The authorities \nare also expected to limit measured inflation through sterilization \noperations and domestic price controls.\n\nThe official government budget, adopted in November 2011, projects a \ndeficit of around 1% of GDP in 2012; the augmented budget is forecast to \nshow surpluses of 4.0% in 2012 and 3.2% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.8.7). The official \nbudget envisages substantial tax reductions, with the goal of reducing the \nratio of tax revenue to GDP by 0.7 percentage points in 2012, although \ncommodity-based revenue is expected to grow strongly, and additional \nrevenue will come from new excise taxes on imported vegetable oil and \ndomestically produced jewelry. Augmented budget revenue is forecast \nat 39.0% of GDP in 2012 and 38.3% in 2013. Almost 60% of expenditures \nwill go to social security, welfare, health care, education, and culture. \nAugmented budget expenditures are projected at 35.0% of GDP in 2012 \nand 35.1% in 2013.\n\nMoney growth is expected to accelerate to 30% in 2012 and 33.6% \n\nin 2013, as public wages and pensions rise and banks increase their \nlending. Further increases in official reserves (at least in 2012) and \ncontinued foreign exchange intervention to depreciate the currency will \nincrease reserve money, offset partly by further central bank sterilization \noperations.\n\nThe current account surplus is forecast to decrease to 7.5% of GDP in \n2012 and 6.0% of GDP in 2013, as the trade balance weakens (Figure\u00a03.8.8). \nDeclining international prices for the country\u2019s main exports, excluding \nnatural gas, coupled with weaker external demand, will hamper export \nperformance, with exports forecast to rise moderately in 2012 and decline \nin 2013. Recession in the European Union will likely lower growth in the \nRussian Federation, Uzbekistan\u2019s main trading partner, reducing exports, \nespecially for automobiles and food, and remittances. Moreover, an \nexpected growth slowdown in the People\u2019s Republic of China is expected \nto reduce key metal and cotton exports.\n\n3.8.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n8.0\n\n9.5\n\n7.5\n\n7.9\n\n9.0\n\n6.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.8.6  Inflation and money supply\n\nInflation\n\nBroad money growth\n\n%\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n30\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n%\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n36\n\n24\n\n12\n\n0\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n08\n\n10\n\n11\n\n09\n\n2007\n\n12\n13\nForecast\nSources: International Monetary Fund. 2011.

The \ngovernment has reported that small businesses accounted for 54% of \nGDP in 2011, which is at par with international averages, but the role \nof entrepreneurs in key areas of economic activity has yet to develop \n(Figure\u00a03.8.9).\n\nPolicies and investment to improve the business climate, promote \nthe private sector, and strengthen infrastructure and trade need to be \nreinforced for a more diversified and sophisticated export sector and to \naccelerate the economy\u2019s transformation.\n\nImproving the business climate is urgently required to develop the \nprivate sector, especially for the many small businesses that represent \nthe overwhelming share of legal entities and provide most national \nemployment. A more favorable business climate would promote \ndiversification and the growth of new firms. It would also facilitate private \nsector participation in the infrastructure and other strategic sectors, as \nthese are gradually opened to private firms. (The private sector is already \ninvolved in repairing and maintaining public roads, and its share in road \nfreight transport reached 72.2% in 2010 from 58.7% in 2005.)\n\nUzbekistan is ranked overall 166 out of 183 economies in the World \n\nBank\u2019s 2012 Doing Business report (and lowest in the trading across \nborders category). Accelerating regulatory reforms to attract investors, \nensuring access to finance and foreign exchange, simplifying customs \nprocedures, and continuing the efforts to offer competitive factor prices \nwould help transform the national economic landscape and sustain \neconomic growth.\n\nOther key measures include further steps to reform the tax regime, \nliberalize regulations for small firms, increase access to external financing \nin the banking and nonbank sectors, and develop the securities market. \nFinally, the country has taken steps toward decentralizing some activities \nin public administration, and further reforms in this area will multiply \nthe benefits of economic growth.\n\n3.8.9  Economic participation of small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs, 2011\n\nOthers\nPrivate enterpreneurs\nSmall businesses\n\nIndustry\n\nConstruction\n\nServices\n\nImports\n\nAgriculture\n\nTrade\n\nExports\n\nSources: State Statistics Committee; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\fEast Asia\nPeople\u2019s  Republic of China\nHong Kong, China\nRepublic of Korea\nMongolia\nTaipei,China\n\n\fPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nDomestic demand rather than exports was the driving force behind 2011\u2019s strong performance, with high \ninvestment  and  consumption.  The  outlook  for  2012  and  2013,  despite  uncertain  global  prospects,  is  for \nonly  moderately  slower  growth.  The  economy  is  gradually  diversifying,  with  imports  rising  rapidly  and \nthe trade surplus now much less as a percentage of economic output. Currency appreciation, rising wage \nrates,  increasing  income  disparities,  and  environmental  concerns  underscore  the  need  for  modifying  the \ncountry\u2019s  growth  model.  With  a  strong  fiscal  position  and  declining  inflation,  the  government  is  well \npositioned  to  implement  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  designed  to  further  transform  the  economy. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) grew at 9.2% in 2011, despite \nsubdued external demand for exports and the effects of domestic policy \ntightening. Although growth came in more than 1\u00a0percentage point \nless than in 2010, it far exceeded that in most other countries, further \nconsolidating the country\u2019s status as the world\u2019s second-largest economy. \nThe main factors continuing to drive the economy were high domestic \nand foreign investment, brisk government expenditure, and increased \ndomestic consumption.\n\nInvestment and consumption accounted for all the growth in 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.9.1). Net exports were a marginally negative contributor, as real \nimports grew faster than real exports. \n\nFixed asset investment increased by almost 24%, slightly slower \nthan in 2010 on the policy-induced slowdown in real estate investment \nto curb speculation (Figure\u00a03.9.2). Local government expenditure on \ninfrastructure also stayed strong, although again at a slower rate than in \n2010. \n\nRising urban and rural per capita incomes (up 8.4% and 11.4% in real \n\nterms) bolstered consumption, reflecting wage and pension increases. \nRetail sales (a proxy for consumption) increased by 17% in nominal terms, \nsomewhat slower than in 2010. Sales of furniture, household appliances, \nand audiovisual equipment registered the highest growth, while car sales \ngrew much more slowly, showing the impacts of restricted licensing to \ncontrol traffic congestion and of the end of subsidies and rebates.\n\nBy sector, agricultural output benefited from an abundant grain \nharvest in the second half of the year and increased overall by 4.5%, \nslightly above the pace set in 2010. Slowing investment and exports \ncaused growth of industrial output to slow to 10.6% from 12.3% the \nprevious year; the sector was still the main contributor to growth \n(Figure\u00a03.9.3). Services increased by 8.9%, slower than the 9.8% growth in \n2010, driven by retail sales and financial services.\n\nThis chapter was written by Yolanda Fernandez Lommen, Niny Khor, and Jian Zhuang \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission, ADB, Beijing.\n\n3.9.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\n14.2 \n\n9.6 \n\n9.2 \n\n10.4 \n\nInvestments\nNet exports\n\nPercentage points \n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n\n9.2 \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics of China. http://\nwww.stats.gov.cn/english/ (accessed 1 March 2012); ADB \nestimates. \nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.2  Growth in fixed asset investment\n\nNominal \n\nReal\n\nQ1\n11\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2009\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\f132    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nReflecting the turmoil in global markets, the bellwether Shanghai \n\nA-share stock index dropped by more than 20% in 2011. Investors, \nconcerned about the international outlook and earnings prospects of \nlisted companies, exited risk assets. Total market capitalization during \n2011 fell by $486 billion, or to 31% of GDP from 45% in 2010.\n\nInflation\u2014measured by the consumer price index\u2014peaked at a 3-year \n\nhigh of 6.5% in July, falling to 4.1% by December (Figure\u00a03.9.4). The \nsecond-half improvement reflected monetary tightening in the first half \nof the year, government measures to regulate the housing market, and \nfavorable harvests in the autumn that curbed hikes in food prices. Still, \nthe inflation rate in 2011 was 5.4%, up from 3.3% the prior year, reflecting \nprimarily food and fuel prices and residential housing costs. Supply \nshocks, such as surging pork prices and supply shortfalls as a result of \npoor harvests in the first half of the year, accounted for much of the food \ninflation. Residential housing prices started to grow more slowly or fall \nmarginally in some areas; transactions were fewer. \n\nFiscal policy was expansionary. Government expenditure grew by \n24.7%, revenue by 26.7%, and the government incurred a fiscal deficit \nequal to 1.8% of GDP (including local government debt). At 44% of GDP, \ntotal public debt remains manageable. Increased budget shares were made \nin support of medical reform, educational programs for migrant workers\u2019 \nchildren in urban areas, and poverty relief. The government revised the \npoverty line from about $0.50 to $1 a day, thereby classifying another\n100\u00a0million people as poor. \n\nMonetary policy tightened in 2011 to dampen inflation pressures. The \ncentral bank increased the banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio six times in \nthe first half, to 21.5% for big lenders. It raised benchmark 1-year interest \nrates three times in the year, to 6.56%. As inflation pressures eased and \nthe consumer price index fell, it started easing monetary policy first in \nDecember, by lowering the reserve requirement by 50\u00a0basis points and \nthen by another 50\u00a0basis points in February (Figure\u00a03.9.5). Money supply \ngrowth was 13.6% in 2011, below the government target of 16.0%. New \ncredit amounted to CNY7.5\u00a0trillion ($1.2\u00a0trillion) in 2011, about the same\nincrease as the year earlier. \n\nRestricted access to credit, and persistent negative real interest rates \n(bank deposit rates were lower than the inflation rate), encouraged heavy \noff-balance sheet credit activities and informal lending. This undermined \ngovernment efforts to stabilize liquidity and control inflation, prompting \nincreased supervision by regulatory agencies. Of particular focus were \nmacro-prudential measures to regulate rapidly expanding wealth \nmanagement products.\n\nAs reported by the central bank, foreign exchange reserves increased \n\nto $3.18\u00a0trillion in 2011, compared with $2.85\u00a0trillion in 2010. In a break\nfrom the seemingly continuous increase in reserves, they declined (by \n$21\u00a0billion) in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the first time since 1998, due\nto increased repatriation of foreign capital, capital flight, and valuation \nlosses. On the exchange rate, the yuan appreciated during 2011 by 4.7% \nagainst the United States (US) dollar, and by 7.9% against the euro.\nDue to the weak global economy, trade slowed: export growth \n\ndecelerated to 20% from 31% and imports to 25% from 39% (Figure\u00a03.9.6). \nThe trade surplus on a customs basis narrowed to $158\u00a0billion from\n\n3.9.3  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\nPercentage points\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics of China. http://\nwww.stats.gov.cn/english/ (accessed 1 March 2012); ADB \nestimates. \nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.4  Monthly inflation\n\nFood\n\nOverall\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.5  Interest rates and required reserves\nRequired reserves, large banks\n\nLending rates\n\n%\n7.0\n\n6.5\n\n6.0\n\n5.5\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\nJan\n2011\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nMar\n\nJan\n12\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.6  Trade indicators\n\nExport growth \n\nImport growth\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\n \n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n%\n23\n\n22\n\n21\n\n20\n\n19\n\n18\n\n%\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China    133\n\n$181\u00a0billion (2.2% of GDP in 2011 versus 3.1% in 2010, and down from a\nhigh of 7.5% in 2007). The current account surplus fell to 2.8% of GDP \nin 2011. Foreign direct investment in the PRC increased, however, from \n$106\u00a0billion in 2010 to a record $116\u00a0billion. Declining investment by US\nand European Union investors were more than offset by increased inflows \nfrom Asia.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook assumes that the US economy will continue its slow recovery, \nthat the eurozone sovereign debt crisis will not worsen, and that the \nPRC\u2019s policy stance will remain accommodative. \n\nDuring the Annual Central Economic Work Conference in December \n\n2011\u2014a major economic policy forum\u2014the government announced the \nmain policy guidelines for 2012. These include a shift in emphasis from \ncurbing inflation to maintaining stable and relatively fast economic \ngrowth, promoting restructuring, and managing inflation expectations. \nThese objectives will be addressed through fiscal and financial reforms \nsupporting domestic demand as well as emerging and strategic industries, \nand structural reform to rebalance the sources of growth, in line with the \nmain guidelines of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015).\n\nFiscal policy is expected to remain broadly expansionary in the \n\nforecast period, with higher spending on education, health care, pensions, \npublic housing, and other social security programs (including a 40% \nincrease in the 2012 budget allocation for poverty relief). The overall fiscal \ndeficit is expected to be 1.7% of GDP in 2012 and 2.0% in 2013. To ease the \ntax burden on consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises, the \ngovernment may again raise the minimum income tax exemption level \nand replicate nationwide the Shanghai pilot tax reform of shifting from \nthe business tax to a value-added tax (Box\u00a03.9.1). Plans have also been \nannounced for improved support of small businesses, including tax relief \nand easier access to capital markets. \n\nMonetary policy will accommodate a continued high rate of economic \n\ngrowth. Money supply (M2) is set to grow by 14% in 2012, with new \nlending targeted at CNY8\u00a0trillion ($1.3\u00a0trillion) and a similar target\nfor 2013. Financial sector reform will continue, including prudential \nregulation of off-balance sheet credit activities that could destabilize \nthe real economy. A cornerstone reform in this context would be a \nmore market-based approach to setting interest rates, leading to a more \neffective allocation of capital and savings.\n\nIn view of exchange rate movements in 2011 and earlier, and \nthe effects of increased labor and other domestic costs on export \ncompetitiveness, continued appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar \nmay slow. \n\nFixed asset investment is projected to remain the major engine \nof growth, increasing by 20% or more in 2012 and 2013. Investment \nin infrastructure (such as railways, rural irrigation, and urban public \ntransport) is expected to continue at a high level. As part of the current \nfive-year plan, 7\u00a0million housing units are to be constructed in 2012, \nwhich will partly offset the slowdown in real estate investment by the \nprivate sector. Consistent with government efforts to narrow regional \n\n3.9.1 Tax reforms\n\nThe authorities introduced new tax \npolicies in 2011. In a step designed \nto improve energy efficiency and \nstrengthen local government finances, \na national resource tax system \nwas launched in November 2011. \nFollowing a trial period in Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous region, oil and gas \nproducers now face a 5% tax on sales \nvalue. The reform does not cover coal, \nhowever\u2014the source of about 70% of \nthe country\u2019s total energy. \n\nA trial program for the services \n\nsector began in January 2012, in \nShanghai, to replace the business tax \n(on gross revenue) with a value-added \ntax (VAT). \n\nThe trial will focus on selected \nservice providers and will be extended \nnationwide if effective. As part of the \nprogram, the Shanghai government \nannounced new brackets of lower VAT \nrates for transport and certain service \nindustries. The reform is expected to \nlower the tax burden for the service \nsector and support development of the \ncountry\u2019s modern service industry. \nTo bolster development of small \n\nand medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs)\u2014which employ a large \nproportion of the country\u2019s work \nforce, especially in urban centers\u2014the \ngovernment raised the minimum \nthreshold of the VAT and business tax \nfor SMEs. \n\nIt also abolished the stamp tax \non loan contracts between financial \ninstitutions and micro and small \nenterprises. Government departments \nhave been requested to allocate at least \n30% of their purchasing quota to SMEs.\n\n\f134    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\ndisparities, the central and western provinces will continue to receive the \nhighest rate of public investment growth. \n\nNominal private consumption is expected to grow by almost 12% in \nboth 2012 and 2013, boosted by continued employment and wage growth \nas well as increased government social expenditure. Inclusive-growth \nmeasures under the five-year plan target the rural\u2013urban income gap \n(see below). Exports and imports are expected to increase by around 15% \nand 18% in 2012, edging up in 2013. The contribution of net exports to \nGDP growth is projected to remain negative, and the trade surplus to \ncontinue narrowing. The current account surplus is set to fall to 2.1% and \n1.7% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 (Figure\u00a03.9.7). Factors weighing on these \ntrade prospects include deteriorating terms of trade and a gloomy world \neconomic outlook, particularly for the eurozone. \n\nIn a signal that it will accommodate somewhat slower growth in \norder to make it more inclusive and environmentally sustainable, the \ngovernment announced that it has reduced the 2012 growth target from \n8.0% to 7.5%. As in previous years, though, it is expected that actual \ngrowth will exceed this target. On the above estimates, GDP growth is \nforecast at 8.5% in 2012 (Figure\u00a03.9.8) driven by robust investment and \nprivate consumption, and 8.7% in 2013, supported by stronger global \ngrowth momentum.\n\nInflation is forecast to decline to about 4.0% (Figure\u00a03.9.9), as \n\nindicated by the combined annual rate of 3.9% for January and February. \nWith world economic growth expected to remain modest, global \ncommodity prices\u2014except for oil\u2014will likely moderate, easing pressures \nfrom imported inflation. Continued policy restraint on property markets \nwill help control domestic inflation pressures, although bad weather or \nother setbacks could disproportionately affect inflation. Other inflation \nrisks stem from rising labor costs and possible increases in energy and \nutility prices, reflecting the need for stringent compliance with the \nenvironmental targets of the current five-year plan. \n\nThe main downside risk is uncertainty over external demand, \nincluding the slow recovery in the US, fiscal and debt concerns in the \nEuropean Union, and Japan\u2019s economic setbacks\u2014among the country\u2019s \nlargest trading partners. Nevertheless, progress in diversifying its export \nmarkets, and in rebalancing the sources of growth toward domestic \ndemand, should help maintain economic momentum. \n\nPotential increases in nonperforming loans of local government \n\ncould be a domestic risk, stemming from large debt issues during \nimplementation of the stimulus program introduced in 2009 to counter \nthe effects of the global financial crisis. The concern relates to the \nmismatch between short- and medium-term maturity (over 50% of debt \nwill mature within the next 3\u00a0years) and the long-term nature and limited \nprofitability of most of the infrastructure projects undertaken as part \nof the stimulus program. However, this risk is unlikely to cause major \ndisturbances to the economy given the overall soundness of the financial \nsector. \n\nIn October 2011, the Ministry of Finance announced a trial program \n\nto allow four local authorities\u2014including the city governments of \nShanghai and Shenzhen\u2014to sell bonds directly, a move to help local \ngovernments repay loans of more than $1\u00a0trillion.\n\n3.9.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n8.5\n\n4.0\n\n2.1\n\n8.7\n\n4.0\n\n1.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.9.7  Current account balance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 5 March 2012); ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.8  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics of China. http://\nwww.stats.gov.cn/english/ (accessed 1 March 2012); ADB \nestimates. \nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.9  Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n%\n6.0\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n-1.5\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics of China. http://\nwww.stats.gov.cn/english/ (accessed 1 March 2012); ADB \nestimates. \nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China    135\n\nAnother domestic consideration is the transition to a new generation \n\nof political leaders. The 12th plan focus on deemphasizing exports in \nfavor of domestic demand will require strong leadership and consensus. \nFurther, new impetus is needed for inclusive growth and environmental \nsustainability. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014tackling income inequality\nIn the transition to a more market-based economy, 3\u00a0decades of rapid \ngrowth have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, but more than a \nhundred million are still severely poor, and income inequality has sharply \nwidened. As acknowledged in the 12th plan, such inequality will hinder \nfuture growth as it undermines consumption, constrains development in \npoorer regions, and generates social tensions. \n\nDifferent measures show how much income inequality has risen. The \nwidely used Gini coefficient worsened (on a scale of 0\u2013100) from around \n25 in the mid-1980s to 41 in 2000, the last year the government published \nfindings. Since then, several independent PRC scholars, using various \nmethods and data, have placed the coefficient in a range of 45 to more \nthan 50\u2014among the highest in the world. \n\nOther research suggests that the income of the top 10% of households \nrelative to the bottom 10% in 2005 was 15.5\u00a0times, against 7.3\u00a0times in 1998. \nIn contrast, the ratio was 10 or less for Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and \nViet\u00a0Nam in 2005 or more recent years (Figure\u00a03.9.10).\n\nUrban\u2013rural income differences are very large: urban households\u2019 \nincomes are on average almost three and a half times as high than rural \nhouseholds\u2019 (Figure\u00a03.9.11). The gap persists for two main reasons. First, \nrural areas have much less investment in physical and human capital. \nSecond, the return on investment and assets is typically much lower in \nrural areas. Other overlapping factors include special economic zones \nconcentrated in coastal areas, decentralization of public services provision \nto local government without a corresponding increase in fiscal resources, \nand regressive taxes. Further, the social support network was set up \ninitially for urban households\u2014a rural pension system only started in \n2009. Finally, fiscal disparities are steep: per capita public spending in the \nrichest county is 48\u00a0times that in the poorest.\n\nThe first reason is the dominating factor in the PRC. The \nconsequences of underinvestment in rural areas are strikingly \nillustrated in the returns to education. In 1988, education and individual \ncharacteristics (other than age) explained little of the variation in \nincome among workers. Some 20 years later, household and individual \ncharacteristics accounted for 50% of the urban\u2013rural income gap, and \neducation alone for about 25% of that gap. Urban\u2013rural income disparities \nare likely to further widen. \n\nIncome redistribution and social security thus need to be \n\nstrengthened for inclusive and sustainable growth. A comprehensive \nsocial security system would help reduce income inequality. Although the \nPRC\u2019s social policies have made great strides in recent years\u2014including \nthe long-awaited Social Insurance Law in July 2011\u2014further social \nsecurity reform is vital. The social security framework is still segmented, \noperating through a complex system of insufficiently coordinated schemes \n\n3.9.10  Income share, top 10% to  \nbottom 10%\n\nPAK\nIND\nINO\n2005 2005 2009\n\nVIE\nTHA\n2008 2004\n\nPRC\n2005\n\nPHI\nMAL\n2006 2009\n\nIND\u00a0=\u00a0India; INO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia; MAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia; \nPAK\u00a0=\u00a0Pakistan; PHI\u00a0=\u00a0Philippines; PRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic \nof China; VIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet\u00a0Nam; THA\u00a0=\u00a0Thailand.\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from World Bank, \nWorld Development Indicators online database (accessed \n14 February 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.9.11  Urban\u2013rural per capita income\n\n90\n\n95\n\n85\n\n1980\n\n2000\n\n05\nSource: ADB estimates using data from China Statistical \nYearbook 2011 (Table 10.2, p.330). \nClick here for figure data\n\n08\n\n09\n\n07\n\n10\n\n06\n\nRatio\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nRatio\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n\f136    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nthat result in inadequate coverage of benefits and beneficiaries. Further, \nits dual nature\u2014parallel rural and urban programs\u2014resulting from the \nhousehold registration system or hukou, is no longer suitable. A much \nmore unified system, as envisaged under the Social Insurance Law, is \nrequired to address the needs arising from increased labor mobility \n(including those of migrant workers), the challenges of accelerated \nurbanization, and the implications of a rapidly aging population.\nCentral\u2013local fiscal arrangements must also be strengthened. \nAlthough transfer payments from the central government have been \nincreased, the capacity of local governments to provide public services \nhas not improved in tandem. Equally, revenue sharing and expenditure \nresponsibilities between the central and local governments need to be \nbetter aligned.\n\nBeyond challenges of inclusive growth and income inequality are \nmany others, notably water resource management and energy use. The \ncountry needs to manage its water better, as water scarcity and pollution \nare threatening the agricultural base. (The 12th plan aims to reduce water \nconsumption per unit of industrial value added by 30%.) \n\nThe PRC is now the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer and since 2007 \nthe largest source of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions; its energy \nintensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) is nearly double the \naverage of countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (Figure\u00a03.9.12). (The 12th plan has set a target of cutting \nenergy intensity by 17%.)\n\nAs the world\u2019s second-largest economy, the PRC will increasingly \n\ninfluence the rate and manner of world economic growth. Global \ninterdependence requires the eurozone crisis to be resolved, a repeat \nrecession in industrial countries to be avoided, trade protectionism to be \nrejected, and international consensus to be secured on actions on climate \nchange and other issues.

Provided overseas markets pick up, however, \na  rebound  should  be  experienced  in  2013.\n\nEconomic performance\nThis economy had a mixed year of yin and yang. While it slowed to 5.0% \nfor the full year (from 7.0% in 2010), growth momentum of 7.6% at the \nstart of the year moderated progressively to only 3% by the end. Further, \nmoderating growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was a \nconcern, compounded by the reemergence of the eurozone sovereign debt \ncrisis and faltering demand in advanced economies.\n\nThe dominant source of growth for Hong Kong, China was domestic \ndemand. Private consumption expenditure increased by 8.6%, buoyed by \nstrong employment and rising real incomes (Figure\u00a03.10.1). Retail sales \nand visitor spending went up by 18% and 25%, powered by a jump in \ntourist arrivals.\n\nThe other potential sources of growth\u2014government consumption, \n\ninvestment, and net exports\u2014made little impact. Government \nconsumption increased by 2% and investment by only 1%. Investment \nactually fell in the first quarter but recovered during later quarters, \nled by machinery and equipment acquisition and public sector works. \nMerchandise exports rose much less rapidly than in 2010 and slightly less \nthan merchandise imports, such that net exports subtracted from growth \nin 2011. This outcome was in marked contrast to the first quarter, when \nthe net export position was strongly positive.\n\nAccounting for nearly 90% of output, services set the pace for the \neconomy as a whole. Professional and business services grew strongly, as \ndid services related to tourism and cross-border commercial and financial \nservices. Trade-related and transport services, however, slipped with the \nslowdown in merchandise trade.\n\nFull employment characterized much of the economy. Unemployment \n\nfell to 3.3% by year-end, underemployment was less than 2%, and job \nvacancies surged. Wages and earnings scored their biggest gains since \nthe mid-1990s, boosted by the tightness in the labor market and the \nintroduction of a statutory minimum wage (Figure\u00a03.10.2).\n\nInflation climbed sharply, to 5.3% from 2.3% in 2010, due to \n\ndomestic cost pressures and imported inflation (notably for food and \n\nThis chapter was written by Arief Ramayandi and Aleli Rosario of the Economics and \nResearch Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.10.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPercentage points \n20\n\n8.0\n\n6.8 6.9\n\n7.6\n\n6.6\n\n5.3\n\n4.3\n\n3.0\n\nQ1\n2010\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4 Q1\n11\n\nQ2 Q3\n\nQ4\n\nSource: Census and Statistics Department. http://www.\ncenstatd.gov.hk/ (accessed 14 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.10.2  Unemployment and earnings\n\nGrowth in real earnings\nUnemployment, seasonally adjusted\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n%\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n Q3\n\n Q1\n2008\n\n Q1\n09\n\n Q3\n\nQ3\n\n Q1\n10\n\n Q1\n11\n\nQ4\n\nSource: Census and Statistics Department. http://www.\ncenstatd.gov.hk (accessed 28 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f138    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\noil) (Figure\u00a03.10.3). Housing prices stabilized in the second half but \nshowed steep appreciation (7.2%) for the year as a whole. Government \ninterventions, such as increased land supply and restrictions to mortgage \navailability, helped cool the property market\u00a0(Figure\u00a03.10.4).\n\nMacroeconomic policy focused on investing in the future, as well \nas fighting inflation and the risk of an asset bubble. Fiscal policy helped \nlow-income groups deal with the rising cost of living, especially food and \nhousing-related costs, as these account for two-thirds of such groups\u2019 \noverall spending. Measures to moderate the cost of living included \nelectricity subsidies and rate concessions on property taxes and public \nhousing rentals. Netting out the effects of the government\u2019s one-time \nmeasures, underlying inflation rose at the same rate as headline inflation.\nFiscal policy for FY2011 (1 April\u201331 March 2012) was consolidative. \nExpenditure was up 22% and revenue 15%, with the result that the budget \nsurplus narrowed to 3.5% of GDP (from 4.5% in FY2010). \n\nMonetary policy reflected the pegged exchange rate to the United \n\nStates (US) dollar and the accommodative policy of the US Federal \nReserve, including low interest rates that helped maintain strong domestic \ndemand. Similar to the US dollar, the nominal trade-weighted effective \nexchange rate index of the Hong Kong dollar depreciated by 2.4% in \nDecember from a year earlier.\n\nTrade activity was deflated by the eurozone crisis, the sluggish US \neconomy, and disruptions to global supply chains resulting from Japan\u2019s \nearthquake in March. Merchandise exports rose (in nominal terms) \nby only 11.2%, or less than half the rate of the previous year. Although \nthe PRC accounts for over half of Hong Kong, China\u2019s exports and \nreexports of goods, slackening demand in the advanced markets became \nincreasingly evident in Asian markets (Figure\u00a03.10.5).\n\nServices exports increased by 14%, a sharp deceleration from the gain \nof 23% the previous year. Tourism boomed but transport and trade-related \nservices weakened appreciably. Despite the 20% slump in the Hang Seng \nindex during 2011, the economy retained its rank as the world\u2019s top initial \npublic offering center.\n\nMerchandise imports climbed by 12%, again around half the rate of \n2010. Retained imports, which account for one-fourth of total imports, \nincreased by 16%, reflecting strong domestic demand and tourist spending.\nHong Kong, China continued to have a large current account surplus, \nequivalent to 5.1% of GDP. The positive balance for trade in services more \nthan offset the deficit in trade in goods. The capital account was negative, \nwith heavy portfolio investment outflows. Net foreign direct investment \nwas substantially positive, despite outflows in the latter part of the year. \nOfficial reserves increased by US$16.7\u00a0billion to US$285.4\u00a0billion.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is highly open and trade dependent, hence growth is \ncritically dependent on conditions of its major economic partners. The \nbusiness outlook is uncertain and growth of only 3.0% is forecast for \nHong Kong, China in 2012, well below the 5-year average before the global \nfinancial crisis. The forecast for 2013 is much stronger, with growth of \n4.5%.

Net exports are projected to be negative in the first half of \n2012\u2014a drag on economic growth\u2014before becoming positive toward \nyear-end.\n\nMost of the four \u201cpillar industries\u201d\u2014financial services, tourism, trade \n\nand logistics, and producer and professional services\u2014are expected to \ncontinue expanding at a healthy rate, abetted by the PRC. Trade and \nlogistics, however will slow in 2012 as a result of weak growth globally.\n\nDuring the forecast period Hong Kong, China will continue to deepen \n\nits economic integration with the PRC through the Closer Economic \nPartnership Agreement and Pan-Pearl River Delta region platforms, and \ncontinue to expand its role as an international financial and trade center. \nIt will also continue to expand its yuan business, supported by measures \nthat encourage citizens of the PRC to invest in Hong Kong, China stocks, \nthat allow repatriation of the yuan, and that increase yuan-denominated \nbond issuance in the territory (Figure\u00a03.10.6).\n\nGrowth of tourism will provide an important injection to the \n\neconomy, helping offset weakness in the trade and logistics sector. Visitor \narrivals from the PRC surged by 24% to 28.1\u00a0million in 2011, accounting \nfor 67% of the total (Figure\u00a03.10.7).\n\nExternal trade is expected to remain sluggish in 2012. In view of \nweak external demand, merchandise exports will show little growth and \ncould even decline if the PRC, US, and European Union experience an \nunexpected setback. Since advanced economies account for close to 30% \nof East Asia\u2019s total export value, their import demand directly bears on \ndemand for Hong Kong, China\u2019s exports. Service exports should remain \nbuoyant, aided by tourism and the growth of professional services to the \nPRC. The current account surplus is forecast to narrow to the equivalent \nof 5.0% of GDP in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAverage annual inflation is expected to decline to 3.8% for the year \n\nas a whole, reflecting more stable\u00a0food prices and lower commodity \nprices, except for oil. Also, the short-term price effects of government \nintervention in rental housing will have worked through, with a \nconsequent drop in the housing component in the inflation index. \nInflation is expected to drop further in 2013, to 3.3%, as food and housing \nprices continue to stabilize.\n\nFiscal policy is being realigned, from fighting inflation to ensuring \nstability of employment and income growth. For FY2012 (ending 31\u00a0March \n2013), six priority areas have been identified for budget support and \ngovernment action: supporting enterprises; preserving employment; \ncaring for people; stabilizing the financial system; increasing land supply; \nand strengthening social capital. \n\nbut a decrease in revenues in part because of one-time reductions in \ntaxes on profits and salaries, waiving of business registration fees, and \nhalving charges for import and export declarations.

Low \ninterest rates will parallel those in the US, helping to stimulate growth \nduring the weak global environment.\n\nThe main risk to the forecast for Hong Kong, China is the possibility \n\nof a marked slowdown of the PRC economy. A jump in oil prices could \nalso be highly disruptive of global recovery.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014more equitable income \ndistribution\n\nHong Kong, China has one of the highest degrees of income inequality \namong \u201cvery high human development countries,\u201d according to the \nHuman Development Report 2010. Singapore ranks closely behind. Both \neconomies compare more to developing than to developed countries.\n\nInitial results from the 2011 Population Census for Hong Kong, China \n\nprovide more up-to-date information on income distribution. There was \na decline in the absolute number of low-income households and a general \nincrease in the number of households with high incomes (Figure\u00a03.10.9). \nIn real terms, the median income of households increased by an \nestimated HK$2,564 from 2006 to 2011. Even then, the median income of\nHK$19,472 in 2011 was just a few hundred Hong Kong dollars more than\nwhat it was a decade earlier. Further analysis of the census and other data \nis needed to better discern recent income distribution trends in Hong \nKong, China. \n\nGovernment expenditure for social services as a percentage of GDP \n\nhas varied slightly over the past decade. Government expenditure for \neducation was equivalent to 4.0% of GDP in 2000 but 3.6% in 2011. \nExpenditure on health declined from 2.5% of GDP to 2.4%. Social welfare \nexpenditures, however, increased from 2.1% to 2.3%. The 2012 budget, \nwhich includes taxation and other forms of relief for low-income groups \n(e.g., public housing rental waivers), shows higher provision for social \nspending as a share of GDP except for housing and community amenities \n(Figure\u00a03.10.10).\n\nStrains on social services are illustrated by the long queue for public \n\nrental housing. Applicants for public rental apartments totaled 152,000 \nin FY2010, with an average waiting time of 2\u00a0years. According to a 2011 \nreport by the Civic Exchange, the lowest income groups experienced \ndeteriorating social services, housing, and employment conditions.\n\nConservative fiscal management and substantial accumulation of \nreserves allow for the provision of greater government expenditure for \nsocial services and housing\u2014an effective means of reducing income \ninequality.

A slowdown was expected\u2014given the exceptionally high rate in \n2010\u2014but not to this degree. The underlying cause was sluggish domestic \ndemand, particularly with respect to investment. Manufacturing output \nexpanded by 7.1% and services by 2.6%, but construction contracted by \n5.6%. The strength of manufacturing relates to exports as the mainstay \nof growth in 2011, a contrast with 2010, when high levels of consumption \nand investment spurred growth while the trade sector acted as a drag. \nMore precisely, net exports were strongly positive in 2011 (exports \nincreased faster than imports) and accounted for over half GDP growth \n(Figure\u00a03.11.1). Despite a much less rapid rise than in the previous year, \nprivate consumption added another third. Government consumption \naccounted for little, reflecting the completion of fiscal stimulus. \nInvestment contributed even less as plant and equipment expenditures \nwere relatively flat; facilities investment increased by less than 4%, down \nfrom 25% in 2010. Construction fell deeper into negative territory. \n\nGrowth momentum slowed during the year. Year on year, output \nwas up 4.2% in the first quarter but then fell to the 3.5% range in the \nsubsequent 3\u00a0quarters. Softening of growth was more evident quarter on \nquarter (Figure\u00a03.11.2): reflecting the growing weakness of the economy, \nall the main components of GDP expenditure contracted in the fourth. \nThis drop-off was especially pronounced for plant and equipment \ninvestment, but also extended to exports. The decelerating growth \nmomentum closely paralleled the deteriorating global outlook.\n\nMerchandise exports increased in nominal terms by a subdued but \nstill-healthy 20.0% in 2011 (versus 28.8% in 2010), underscoring exports\u2019 \nresilience. Export growth year on year, however, slowed steadily from \n26.5% in the first quarter to 12.1% in the fourth (Figure\u00a03.11.3). A flurry \nof ship orders and March\u2019s earthquake in Japan initially buttressed \nexports, but as the year progressed, softening demand\u2014notably from the \n\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park of the Economics and Research \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.11.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nGov\u2019t consumption\nPrivate consumption\n\n5.1\n\n0.3\n\n2.3\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points\n9\n\n6.2\n\n3.6\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: Bank of Korea.

In turn, import growth fell steadily over the \nyear, indicative of softening domestic demand. Merchandise imports \nrose by 23.8%, down from 31.5% in 2010. The pattern for services trade \nwas broadly similar. The current account surplus is estimated to be the \nequivalent of 2.5% of GDP, slightly lower than in 2010. The won exchange \nrate against the dollar remained essentially unchanged at 1,100 (it was \n1,150 in 2010).\n\nPrivate consumption climbed by only 2.2% in 2011, half the year-\nearlier rate. As was the case with the export sector, it also weakened \nprogressively during the year, starting with growth of almost 3% but \nfalling to just over 1% by the fourth quarter (Figure\u00a03.11.4). Consumer \nconfidence fell in tandem, eroded by inflation and declining real \nhousehold purchasing power. Further, gross domestic income increased \nby only 1%, as higher oil prices and a deterioration of the terms of trade \ncut into disposable income. The one positive note was a large pickup in \nemployment of some 400,000, much higher than the usual 250,000.\nThe sharp investment slowdown is reflected in the industrial \nproduction index and the ratio of producer\u2019s shipments to inventory \n(Figure\u00a03.11.5). Investment in export-oriented industries such as \nautomobiles and semiconductors fell in parallel with the global outlook. \nThe slowdown also partly reflects normalization from the exceptionally \nrapid investment growth of 2010. Construction investment contracted, \nreflecting the weak housing market and subdued public works activity. \nInflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose to 4.0%, \nthe upper limit of the Bank of Korea\u2019s inflation target band. Supply-side \nfactors included domestic food prices as well as oil and other commodity \nprices. The spike in domestic food prices was caused by bad weather. \nWhile supply-side factors were the immediate catalyst of higher inflation \nin 2011, aggregate demand pressures also played a role. The central bank \nraised the policy interest rate during the first half of the year, then held \nmonetary policy steady in light of the global outlook (Figure\u00a03.11.6). \n\nThe government continued to consolidate its financial position, which \n\nhad been sharply expansionary in response to the global financial crisis. \nThe fiscal deficit narrowed progressively, to 0.7% of GDP from 4.8% in \n2009 and 1.5% in 2010. Government expenditure rose to 21.2% of GDP and \nrevenue even more significantly to 20.5%; the ratio of public debt to GDP \nfell marginally to 35%.\n\nIn summary, the country\u2019s overall economic performance in 2011 \nwas worse than expected, largely due to the deteriorating global outlook \nas the year unfolded. Even though export growth slowed progressively \nduring the year, it remained the main driver. Private consumption was \nsupportive while investment lost steam. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth for 2012 is forecast at 3.4% (below potential), rising moderately in \n2013 to 4.0%. These rates are based on the expectation that the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s main export markets, including the European Union, the United \nStates (US), and Japan, will experience slow growth at best.

Export unit prices are expected to \nremain flat, in contrast to significant gains in 2011. The fragile state of \neconomic recovery in advanced countries is constraining demand for key \nexports from the Republic of Korea, such as automobiles, electronics, and \nother consumer durables. Demand for key ICT parts, such as memory \nchips used in personal computers, has also been affected. \n\nMore positively, exports of general machinery and other goods to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and other emerging markets in Asia are \nexpected to remain strong. Petrochemical exports will also be robust, \nincluding those to Japan. Overall export growth is projected to strengthen \ngradually during 2012 and into 2013, in line with a gradually improving \nglobal outlook. Imports will likely climb faster than exports, and the \ncurrent account surplus to decline to around 2.0% of GDP. The US dollar \nexchange rate is unlikely to change much either way. \n\nInvestment is forecast to increase by little more than 2% in 2012. \nSubdued investment, especially in the export sector, has mirrored the \nworsening external environment. Corporate investment surveys indicate \nthat major Korean firms plan to reduce investment relative to their levels \nin 2011 by 5\u201310%. Beyond weak business sentiment, an impediment to \nstronger investment is the decline in corporate profitability, notably \namong ICT firms. Another negative element for equipment investment \nis the recent fall in capacity utilization (Figure\u00a03.11.7). Construction \ninvestment, including housing, which contracted in both 2010 and 2011, is \nexpected to increase, but only moderately. Overall investment is expected \nto strengthen in the second half of 2012 as the global outlook picks up.\nPrivate consumption is projected to increase by about 3% in 2012, \nor somewhat more strongly than in 2011. Various factors constrain its \ngrowth, though. Consumer confidence is weak (Figure\u00a03.11.8) and is \nunlikely to strengthen until the global outlook improves convincingly. \nPurchases of consumer durables, especially automobiles, may be \nconstrained by the prospective free trade agreement with the US, which is \nexpected to lower prices. Further, sluggish exports will limit wage growth \nand ultimately private consumption. Real wage growth has lagged GDP \ngrowth since the mid-2000s and this trend is likely to continue. Excessive \nhousehold debt also constrains increased private consumption, especially \namong low-income groups. On the positive side, inflation pressures are \nexpected to ease and to help raise household purchasing power. \n\nInflation is forecast to decline to 3.0%, a full percentage lower than in \n2011. It is anticipated that the ratcheting down of global growth predictions \nfor 2012 and 2013 will be tracked by moderating commodity prices and help \nease core inflation. However, international oil and food prices are volatile; \nthey were high in the first part of 2011 then eased, but oil prices have again \nrisen sharply. Supply shocks\u2014such as a spike in oil prices\u2014could prove \nhighly disruptive. A firmer basis for optimism on inflation is the abatement \nof domestic demand pressures and the projected disappearance of the small \ninflationary gap that emerged in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.11.9). \n\nEmployment is forecast to increase by 250,000\u2014healthy but far short \n\nof the exceptional gain in 2011.

This, in turn, stems from the reentry of retired 50-plus \nbaby boomers into the workforce, usually self-employed, to cope with \ninsufficient retirement income. \u201cSilver workers\u201d\u2014those 60 and over\u2014\nnow constitute around 12% of the workforce. For those 65 and older, the \nemployment rate is more than double the OECD average. Except for \nprofessionals, these workers are typically unskilled, on low wages and \nwith little job security. Self-employment in small, scarcely profitable\u00a0retail \noutlets is common. Strong employment growth therefore masks questions \nabout the quality of employment. \n\nThe current basic monetary and fiscal policy framework is likely to \ncontinue\u2014that is, to lower inflation while supporting growth. The policy \ninterest rate is expected to remain largely unchanged. Although the \nadverse global environment may call for stimulus\u2014including yet lower \ninterest rates\u2014the current policy rate of 3.25% is already accommodative. \nHigh and growing household debt further weakens the case for monetary \nloosening (Figure\u00a03.11.10). The Bank of Korea will closely monitor \ndevelopments, tightening monetary policy if inflationary pressures revive \nbut loosening it if the economic outlook deteriorates further. \n\nThe fiscal position is fundamentally sound, as indicated by the public \n\ndebt-to-GDP ratio of 35%, which is far lower than the OECD average. \nThe relatively favorable fiscal conditions support continued consolidation \nwithin a medium-term fiscal framework. Public expenditure requirements \nassociated with the country\u2019s aging population, among other pressures, \ncall for a gradual buildup in the fiscal position. The government is \ntargeting fiscal balance by 2014, if not sooner. \n\nSummarizing the above considerations, GDP growth is likely to \n\nremain slightly below potential in the short term (Figure\u00a03.11.11). Although \ndomestic demand will help cushion some of the loss of momentum since \nthe exceptional growth in 2010, the recovery will be gradual\u2014tracking \nthe global outlook. \n\nThe main short-term downside risk for the economy stems from \nthe eurozone\u2019s sovereign debt issue: the speed and effectiveness of its \nresolution bear heavily on the global outlook and hence prospects \nfor Korean exporters. If the situation deteriorates into another global \nfinancial crisis, exports and GDP growth would be hard hit, as in 2008\u2013\n2009. Alternatively, if the eurozone crisis is resolved faster and better \nthan expected, growth could surprise on the upside. \n\nAnother source of external uncertainty is the potential impact on \nglobal oil prices of Middle Eastern geopolitical tensions. Concern over \nthe change of political leadership in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea has abated. A domestic risk is the high and growing level of \nhousehold debt. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014household debt\nHousehold debt has continued to climb rapidly, despite regulatory efforts. \nHowever, the current surge in household debt appears to be driven by \nfinancing of consumption rather than purchases of homes, and the \nratio of nonhousing to housing loans is rising (Figure\u00a03.11.12).

This supports the view \nthat households, in response to shrinking real disposable incomes, are \nborrowing more to finance consumption. It is expected that increases in \nhousehold debt will slow in 2012, as the financial authorities are likely \nto clamp down on household borrowing to protect the soundness of the \nfinancial sector. The weak housing market will weigh on household loans \nand should act to help constrain the growth of household debt.\n\nHigh and growing household debt may be a domestic risk for the \neconomy, but the probability of it causing a macro financial crisis is \nquite small. The ratio of nonperforming household loans stood at 0.8% \nat end-2011. The banking sector\u2019s improved profitability and stronger \ncapacity to absorb losses further reduces the likelihood of a financial \ncrisis. Stringent loan-to-value regulations minimize the risk of a vicious \ncycle of falling housing prices and rising numbers of nonperforming \nloans. Household debt repayment pressures still affect macroeconomic \nperformance though, because they crimp disposable income, private \nconsumption, and aggregate demand. \n\nHousehold debt also seriously affects certain groups of households \nand components of the financial sector. Low-income households may \nface financial difficulties for two reasons. First, slow economic and hence \nincome growth limits their repayment capacity. Second, repayment \npressures are likely to intensify owing to government efforts to rein in \nhousehold debt. Financial institutions will become more cautious in \nrolling over loans and demand quicker repayment of the principal. For \nhouseholds in the bottom 20% by income, the ratio of debt to disposable \nincome rose sharply in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.11.13). Low-income households \nearning less than 20\u00a0million won annually accounted for about 40% of \ntotal loans, and these loans are more at risk of becoming nonperforming. \nA related area of concern is the so-called secondary financial sector. \n\nThis sector consists of financial institutions that deal extensively with \nborrowers with poor credit ratings and that have only limited capacity \nto absorb losses. The ratio of subprime loans and nonperforming loans \nhas already risen sharply for these institutions. If the risk premium \nrises in response, borrowers\u2019 repayment ability will decline, setting in \ntrain a potentially intensifying cycle of nonrepayment by borrowers and \nworsening balance sheets in the secondary financial sector. \n\nIn 2011, authorities introduced several measures to address household \ndebt. These included reinstatement of debt-to-income limits for mortgage \nloans and various measures to ensure low-income households\u2019 access \nto loans through the primary financial sector. While these measures \nare encouraging, authorities will need to closely monitor the growth of \nhousehold debt, especially loans from the secondary financial sector to \nlow-income households, and to take further cautionary measures. \n\n3.11.12  Share of nonhousing loans\n\nH1\n2009\n\nH2\n\nH1\n10\n\nH2\n\nH1\n11\n\nSource: LG Economic Research Institute.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.11.13  Debt to disposable income,  \nhouseholds in the bottom 20% by income\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nSource: LG Economic Research Institute.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\nRatio\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\fMongolia\n\nMedium-term  economic  prospects  are  excellent,  with  a  very  large  mining  project  expected  to  begin \nproduction  early  next  year  and  another  in  the  initial  stage  of  development.  Growth  has  been  driven \nboth  by  the  booming  mining  sector  and  by  too  rapidly  increasing  government  expenditure.  There  are \nsigns  of  overheating,  reflected  in  double-digit  inflation.  As  already  scheduled  by  the  government,  a \nsubstantial  fiscal  reserve  needs  to  be  built  so  as  to  protect  against  contingencies,  including  a  drop  in \nglobal  commodity  prices.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew by 17.3% in 2011, driven mainly by infrastructure \nspending related to mining activity (Figure\u00a03.12.1). Gross capital formation \nincreased by about 60%, including\u00a0for equipment, buildings and \nintermediate goods, and public infrastructure. Investment in the world-\nscale Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine is projected to total $5\u00a0billion. The\nmine is nearing commercial production.\n\nDomestic consumption was another important driver, rising by 14.5% \n\nin real terms. Private consumption was up strongly, supported by rising \nemployment and incomes.\n\nA surge in exports, almost entirely to the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n(PRC), was driven by increases in the volume and value of coal output. \nImports, however, surged even more, largely reflecting the equipment and \nmachinery needs of mining. Net exports were negative and, therefore, \nheavily reduced the national accounts measure of overall growth.\n\nEconomic growth primarily originated in mining, but was quite \nbroad-based (Figure\u00a03.12.2). Domestic trade (wholesale and retail) rose \nby 42.5%, stimulated by large government cash payments to all citizens. \nMining rose by 8.7%, manufacturing by 16.0%, and construction by 14.3%. \nAgriculture, which accounts for more than a third of total employment, \nincreased by only 0.3%\u2014disappointing progress in view of the sharp \ncontraction in 2010. While official unemployment was less than 5%, labor \nforce surveys indicate that the overall rate was about 9%, down from 13% \nat end-2010.\n\nMacroeconomic management of the economy has been mixed. The \n\ngovernment completed successfully a stand-by arrangement with the \nInternational Monetary Fund in October 2010 but since then fiscal \npolicy has become more expansionary and pro-cyclical. Government \nexpenditure in fiscal 2011 (1\u00a0January\u201331\u00a0December) surged by 55.6% to the \nequivalent of 44.2% of GDP as spending on social transfers, wages and \ncash transfers surged. Government revenue jumped by 40.9%, supported \nby sharply higher receipts from import duties on mining-related \nequipment and corporate and personal income taxes.\n\nThis chapter was written by Jan Hansen and Amar Lkhagvasuren of the Mongolia \nResident Mission, ADB, Ulaanbaatar.\n\n3.12.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\nTotal consumption\nNet exports\n\nGDP\nTotal investments\n\nPercentage points \n42\n\n21\n\n0\n\n-21\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Mongolia 2011.

Compounding the inflationary effects \nof the spending increase, 20% of total budgetary expenditures were \nin December. The budget deficit was the equivalent of 3.6% of GDP, \ncompared with a small surplus in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.12.3). While excess \nmineral revenues were placed in a stabilization fund, as provided for \nby the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL) adopted in 2010, the overall budgetary \nframework was inappropriate for 2011 given the inflationary pressures.\n\nThe Bank of Mongolia (the central bank) tightened monetary policy \nthroughout the year. It increased the reserve requirement for banks from \n5% at the start of 2011 to 11% in August. It has raised the policy rate four \ntimes since early 2010 by a total of 1.75\u00a0percentage points to 12.75% by \nyear-end. Adjusting for inflation, the slightly positive real interest rate \nindicates a modest contractionary monetary policy stance, although \ninsufficient to offset excessive fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe official exchange rate of the local currency (the togrog) against \n\nthe US dollar depreciated by about 11% during August\u2013December \n2011, reflecting global risk aversion and declining commodity prices, \nwhich similarly affected the currencies of other emerging, mineral-rich \neconomies. The real effective exchange rate of the togrog was broadly \nstable\u00a0over the year (Figure\u00a03.12.4).\n\nThe institutional framework for monetary policy has been \n\nstrengthened. The broadly flexible exchange rate system adopted since \n2009 helps control inflation, provides an absorber against external \nshocks, and facilitates the real exchange rate changes that are likely \nto take place over the medium term in view of the rapid growth of \nthe mineral sector. The new Central Bank Law, enacted in early 2010, \nmandates the Bank of Mongolia to concentrate solely on price stability. \nThe real effective exchange rate does not seem to be out of line with \nmedium-term fundamentals.\n\nBroad money supply (M2) grew by nearly 40% through December \n2011, too rapidly given the need to restrain inflationary pressures. The \ncommercial banking system in Mongolia has structural weaknesses, \nwith weak supervision and regulation. Several small to medium-sized \nbanks are highly vulnerable. Year-on-year bank lending was up by more \nthan 70% in December. The rapid acceleration in bank lending is fueling \naggregate demand, heightening the vulnerability of banks and putting \nstress on the financial system.\n\nFor the year as whole, inflation was 9.2%, but varied widely with \nfluctuations in food prices and increased to 10.2% in December year on \nyear (Figure\u00a03.12.5). Inflation in Mongolia is volatile, making it hard to \ndiscern underlying inflationary pressures, which is crucial for guiding \nmacroeconomic policy. The drop in inflation in early 2011 was largely \ndue to a decline in meat prices through government-managed sales of \nmeat reserves at below-market prices. (Meat constitutes about 40% of the \nfood basket.) Core inflation (excluding food and energy) averaged 9.7%, \nindicating overheating of the economy.\n\nExternal trade soared in 2011. The value of exports, largely minerals, \n\nrose by 64.4% to $4.8\u00a0billion, attributable\u00a0to demand from the PRC\n(Figure\u00a03.12.6).

The main \nsource of financing of the current account deficit was foreign direct \ninvestment, which more than doubled to $3.7\u00a0billion. Gross international\nreserves by year-end totaled $2.5\u00a0billion, equivalent to 29% of GDP.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is forecast to continue growing at double digit rates: 15.0% \nin 2012 and 17.5% in 2013. The drivers of growth are expected to remain \nthe same, notably mining-related investment and output. Commercial \nproduction from the Oyu Tolgoi mine is scheduled to begin in early \n2013, accounting for the boost in growth that year. The time frame for \ndeveloping the Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit, one of the world\u2019s largest \nuntapped reserves, is less certain. Growth is likely to be further supported \nby strong growth in construction and services activity associated with \nmining, and by rising government spending.\n\nWith an estimated budget deficit of 1.0% in 2012, fiscal policy is \nexpected to remain pro-cyclical. Government revenue is projected to \nrise by about 40% and expenditure by about 32%. Contingent liabilities \nmay also increase significantly, reflecting the government\u2019s guarantee of \nbond issuances by the Development Bank of Mongolia and scheduled \npublic\u2013private projects. Under the amendments to the Social Welfare Law \nenacted in January 2012, a means-tested poverty benefit will be introduced \nat midyear, replacing the universal cash transfers from the Human \nDevelopment Fund. This represents a major step toward setting up a \nfiscally sustainable social protection system while supporting the poor.\nInflation is expected to remain in double digits\u201415.0% in 2012 and \n12.0% in 2013\u2014owing to very high public spending and large pay rises \nfor public-sector workers in 2012, as well as the emergence of supply \nbottlenecks in the mining industry and shortages in the labor market\n(Figure\u00a03.12.7). Adherence to the FSL, in particular the phasing out of \ncash payments in mid-2012, will put the central bank in a better position \nto contain inflation in 2013. If, however, public spending growth does not \nmoderate (as prescribed by the FSL), inflation may continue to accelerate \nbeyond 2012. The recent exchange rate depreciation will further stoke \ninflationary pressure due to the high import content of consumer goods.\nMonetary policy may need to play a more active role in countering \ninflationary pressures. The central bank\u2019s target for 2012 is an inflation \nrate below 10%, which will require further tightening of monetary policy. \nContaining credit growth, which is increasing systemic risks in the \nbanking sector, will require strict enforcement of prudential regulation.\nExport growth is projected to be robust in the forecast period, based \non strong demand from the PRC and continued high commodity prices. \nExport earnings will also be boosted when the Oyu Tolgoi mine starts \ncommercial production. \n\nImports will continue to be driven by investments linked to mining and \n\nstrong growth in private consumption. As new mines come on stream and \nmineral exports surge, the current account deficit is expected to narrow \nto an estimated 25.0% and 15.0% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 (Figure\u00a03.12.8). \n\n3.12.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n15.0\n\n15.0\n\n-25.0\n\n2013\n\n17.5\n\n12.0\n\n-15.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.12.7  Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.12.8  Current account and trade indicators\n\nCurrent account\nbalance\n\nExports\nImports\n\n$ billion\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n09\n\n2007 08\n\n13\nSources: Bank of Mongolia. 2012.

Because of the heavy dependence on mineral \ndevelopment and exports, and associated government revenue, the \ncurrent account and state finances are highly vulnerable to commodity \nprice fluctuations. Another risk is the possibility of a sharp slowdown in \nthe PRC\u2019s growth, the destination for more than 90% of exports.\nDomestically, weak corporate governance and regulation and \nsupervision have resulted in the banking sector being vulnerable to \nexternal shocks; it could\u2014as during the 2008\u20132009 crisis\u2014generate \nsevere financial stress.\n\nPolicy challenges\u2014institutional strengthening \nand public finance management\n\nWorldwide, countries have shown that, paradoxically, an abundance of \nnatural resources can hinder their long-term development by increasing \nmacroeconomic volatility, thus reducing incentives to invest in physical \nand human capital and undermining economic and political institutions. \nResource dependence often leads to widening income disparities, as \nresource extraction creates relatively few jobs and a small proportion of \nthe population may secure most of the income.\n\nMongolia, which historically had comparatively balanced income \ndistribution, has in recent years seen a clear trend toward increasing \ninequality that could undermine its social cohesion and stability. An \nimportant medium-term challenge will be to improve its economic \nand political institutions so as to ensure transparent, accountable,\u00a0and \nequitable\u00a0management of natural resource revenue.\n\nMacroeconomic management of an economy characterized by very \nrapid development of its natural resources often leads to what is called \n\u201cDutch Disease\u201d\u2014that is, high inflationary pressures, upward pressure \non the exchange rate, crowding out of the private sector, and increasing \nvulnerability to external shocks. Recognizing the possible risks, the \ngovernment strengthened the legal framework for fiscal policy and \nbudget management through enactment of the FSL (in June 2010) and the \nIntegrated Budget Law in early 2012.\n\nThe FSL aims to ensure that mining revenues are better managed \nby putting in place three complementary rules (Box\u00a03.12.1). The FSL\u2014if \nproperly enforced\u2014will make an important contribution to insulating \nfiscal policy from commodity price shocks and smoothing the economy\u2019s \nadjustment to higher mineral output. In turn, conservative management \nof fiscal resources will facilitate development of the nonmineral economy.\nWhile the 2012 government budget appears to be overly expansionary, \n\nthe authorities are expressing their commitment to the FSL. The \nIntegrated Budget Law is a comprehensive law which aims to reform the \nentire budget process, from investment planning to budget execution and \nauditing, and puts in place a new framework for fiscal decentralization. It \nis vital that both these laws be implemented in spirit and practice.\n\n3.12.1  Fiscal rules for budget \ndiscipline\n\nGood fiscal policy is critical for \nhelping to ensure that mineral wealth \ncontributes to sustainable economic \nprosperity. The Fiscal Stability Law \nwill promote needed budget discipline \nthrough three fiscal rules: \n\u2022\t Ceiling on structural budget deficit \n\nof 2% of GDP. The structural deficit \nadjusts the budget deficit to take \naccount of trends in major mineral \nprices (currently copper and coal) \nand their impact on government \nrevenues. The structural balance \nis calculated by using the moving \naverage price of major minerals \nover 16\u00a0years (past 12\u00a0years, current \nyear, and future 3\u00a0years). This \nprovision takes effect in 2013.\n\u2022\t Ceiling on expenditure growth. \n\nSpending growth that is too fast \nleads to overheating and inflation \nand, from a budget perspective, is \ndifficult to manage efficiently. The \nceiling is the greater of the non-\nmineral GDP growth rate of the \nparticular year or the average of the \nnon-mineral GDP growth rate for \nthe 12 consecutive preceding years. \nThis provision takes effect in 2013.\n\n\u2022\t Net present value of public debt \nmust not exceed 40% of GDP. \nThis provision takes effect from \n2014, with a transition period \nspecified for the preceding years. It \nexcludes any borrowing in which \nthe government has agreed to \ncontribute into the paid-in capital \nof a foreign mining entity and \nwhich is repayable from the future \nprofits of the entity.\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nForward-looking business indicators are now more positive than in late 2011 but weak global conditions will \nlimit export growth in this trade-heavy economy. Domestic demand should continue to provide a relatively \nstrong  base,  supported  by  rising  incomes  reaching  around  US$21,000  per  capita  this  year.  A  gradually \nimproving  global  outlook  will  boost  growth  in  2013,  but  longer  term,  increased  R&D  and  investment  is \nneeded  to  secure  broad-based,  stable  growth  through  diversification  and  restructuring  of  the  economy.\n\nEconomic performance\nFollowing the post-recession rebound, economic growth slowed to 4.0% \nin 2011 (Figure\u00a03.13.1). Growth decelerated to 1.9% in the fourth quarter, \nreflecting the slump in gross capital formation and investor concerns \nabout the global outlook. \n\nPositive net exports accounted for most of the increase in output, \n\ndespite weak external demand, as the slowdown in exports was less \nmarked than that for imports. \n\nDomestic demand was mixed, as domestic consumption was \n\nrelatively strong but investment declined. Private consumption rose by \n3.0% in 2011, supported by robust job growth, low unemployment (4.4%), \nand rising earnings. Government consumption picked up by about 2%. \nPrivate investment, however, fell by 2.3%, more sharply so in the second \nhalf of the year as business enterprises, especially in electronics, put their \ninvestment plans on hold. Public investment declined even faster, by \n8.4%, as stimulus-related infrastructure outlays were gradually completed \n(Figure\u00a03.13.2). \n\nGrowth was almost evenly distributed between industry and services. \n\nThe former grew by 4.4% for the year\u2014in contrast to 2010 when it \njumped by 23%\u2014slowing sharply in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing \nrose by 4.9% but construction activity was flat, in line with a slowing \nproperty market. Services saw modest gains in wholesale and retail \ntrade, finance and insurance, information and communications, and \nstrong gains in hotel and restaurant services. Agriculture grew by 1.9%, \nbut accounts for less than 2% of GDP.\n\nInflation of 1.4% was well within the central bank\u2019s target. Measures \n\nto curb mortgage lending, as in the previous year, continued to slow \nresidential property price increases. The appreciating local currency \nagainst the United States (US) dollar\u2014up 7.4% through end-December \n2011, taking it to near the rate before the global financial crisis\u2014also \nhelped curb inflation. \n\nMonetary policy continued tightening in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.13.3). \n\nHowever, from September 2011 the central bank kept the discount rate \n\nThis chapter was written by Shiela Camingue of the Economics and Research \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.13.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\n\nTotal investment\nNet exports\nPercentage points\n\n10.7\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n0.7\n\n-1.8\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and \nStatistics. http://eng.stat.gov.tw (accessed 15\u00a0March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.13.2  Investment growth\n\nPublic\n\nPrivate\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n%\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and \nStatistics. http://eng.stat.gov.tw; CEIC Data Company (both \naccessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nTaipei,China    151\n\nunchanged at 1.875%, as concerns mounted about the risk of another \nglobal economic slowdown. Money supply and bank credit expansion \nclimbed only slowly, although loans to the private sector increased faster \nthan in 2010, at 8.1%. \n\nFiscal policy remained accommodative, with a deficit of 2.5%. Overall \n\ngovernment expenditure increased by 4.4%, reflecting rising social \nwelfare payments and development-related initiatives. Revenue rose by \n10%, supported by a healthy rate of expansion in nominal GDP. Public \ndebt is projected to rise to the equivalent of 37% of GDP, still below the \nlimit of 40% set by law. \n\nTrade decelerated (Figure\u00a03.13.4). Growth of goods exports slowed to \n12.1%, on a combination of weakening external demand and adjustment \nfrom the unsustainable 34.6% postcrisis rebound of 2010. Exports to \nadvanced countries slumped while developing Asian markets remained \nrelatively strong. In particular, the Economic Cooperation Framework \nAgreement with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) resulted in \nrapid growth in exports of products included under the Early Harvest \nProgram. \n\nMerchandise import growth contracted to 13.0% from 43.1% in 2010, \n\nas imports of capital goods fell sharply. The trade surplus increased by \n4.5% to US$27.6\u00a0billion.\n\nThe services account was in surplus, boosted by strong growth in \ntourist arrivals from the PRC. The income account remained positive as \nrepatriated profits and dividends from Taipei,China\u2019s investments abroad \nexceeded its payments to nonresidents. A current account surplus of \nUS$41.3\u00a0billion was recorded, equivalent to 8.8% of GDP.\n\nDirect investment recorded a net outflow of US$14.8\u00a0billion\n\n(Figure\u00a03.13.5), due mainly to firm expansions abroad and relocation of \nless advanced parts of the manufacturing base to the PRC. Portfolio \ninvestment registered a net outflow of US$35.7\u00a0billion, much higher than\nthe previous year, reflecting both concern about the global outlook and \nsafe-haven capital flight. The decline in the capital account more than \noffset the rise in the current account, bringing foreign reserves down to \n82.6% of GDP, from 89% in 2010.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to slow further in 2012 to an annual 3.4%, on the \nuncertain world outlook and moderating rate of expansion of the PRC, \nthe island\u2019s largest trading partner. Improvement to 4.6% is forecast for \n2013, as both domestic and external demand strengthen. \n\nGrowth of exports of goods is forecast to weaken to about 4% in \n2012, or a third of the year-earlier rate. Exports of services will be more \nrobust, growing by more than 7%, supported by greater tourist arrivals \nfrom the PRC as visa restrictions are relaxed further. Continued growth \nof exports to developing Asian markets in 2012 and 2013 will compensate \nin part for the slow growth of exports to developed countries. \n\nImports of goods and services will also slow sharply, but less so than \n\nexports, in part because of the rising cost of oil imports. Net exports \nwill remain positive. Both exports and imports will strengthen as the \neconomy strengthens in the latter half of 2012 and into 2013.

Opening the semiconductor and flat-panel \nsubsectors to foreign investment (announced in March 2011) has so far \nnot met expectations. However, another round of liberalization, which \nbegan in March 2012, together with the expected gradual resurgence of \ngrowth in the US and other major markets, should lead to a pickup in \ninvestment later this year and during 2013. \n\nThe National Development Plan for 2012, announced in December \n2011, is also expected to lift investment in the second half of 2012 and in \n2013. \n\nFiscal policy, however, will be less stimulative than last year. Overall \n\nexpenditure is budgeted to drop marginally, as spending under the \nSpecial Budget will fall to almost zero\u2014with the winding up of crisis \nmeasures in response to the 2009 typhoon and the stimulus measures \nrelated to the 2008\u20132009 recession. Revenue is expected to increase \nby 5%, resulting in a narrowing of the deficit to about 1\u20132% of GDP, \nconsistent with the government\u2019s policy of gradual fiscal consolidation.\n\nInflation is expected to remain little changed in 2012 and 2013, at 1.5% \n\nand 1.6%. Oil prices are forecast to be marginally higher than last year \nbut slow growth, both domestically and internationally, will in general \nease commodity and other prices, including those for food. Property \nprices have started to decelerate, a result of the monetary authority\u2019s \npolicies on curbing speculative activities. The upsurge in consumer \nprices in December\u2013January is considered a short-term aberration, \nattributable\u00a0to bad weather and increased demand during the Chinese \nNew Year. \n\nIn January, authorities announced that investors from the PRC \nwould be allowed to acquire stakes in local banks and financial holding \ncompanies, helping the local stock market rise (by 14%) and the national \ncurrency to appreciate against the US dollar (by 2.5%) from end-2011 to \nmid-March 2012. Uncertainties about the global economy will, however, \nencourage the central bank to closely monitor exchange rate movements \nand to keep interest rates at their current levels, while ensuring that \ninflation stays in check. Monetary policy is expected to tighten in 2013.\nRisks to the economic forecast stem primarily from the eurozone \nsovereign debt crisis and the consequences for the global economy if it \nwere to deepen. Another risk is instability in the Middle East, with the \npossibility of an oil spike and derailment of economic recovery in the US \nand elsewhere.\n\n3.13.6  Consumer confidence\n\nIndex\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.13.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n3.4\n\n1.5\n\n8.1\n\n4.6\n\n1.6\n\n7.9\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nTaipei,China    153\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014industrial diversification and \ncompetitiveness\n\nA major policy challenge for Taipei,China is diversifying the economy \nand achieving a more broad-based, resilient growth model. It is \nhighly dependent on exports, which equal about 70% of total output. \nFurther, more than 40% of its exports are based on electronics products \n(Figure\u00a03.13.7). As an export-led-economy, it is highly susceptible to \nconditions in its main markets, notably the PRC; Hong Kong, China; the \nUS; European Union; and Japan (Figure\u00a03.13.8). \n\nThe competitiveness of the electronics sector is a further concern. \nAlthough the sector has evolved over several decades from pure assembly \nto a high-tech, well-integrated industry, international competition has \nincreased relentlessly, notably from the Republic of Korea. The growing \nscarcity of low-cost labor in Taipei,China over the past decade or more \nhas prompted some companies to relocate manufacturing plants to the \nPRC and elsewhere. In turn, this has raised concern that the migration \nof industry will \u201chollow out\u201d the economy. Financial difficulties of \nTaipei,China\u2019s leading memory-chip makers since the global financial \ncrisis, as indicated in their declining share prices (Figure\u00a03.13.9), have \nunderscored the need for restructuring and innovation.\n\nTaipei,China\u2019s competitive position has been further challenged by \nbilateral trade agreements. Of particular significance, the Republic of \nKorea\u2013US Free Trade Agreement signed in March 2012 poses stepped-up \ncompetition in a wide range of industries, including electronics. Beyond \nthat, the Republic of Korea is scheduled to start negotiations on free trade \nwith the PRC and Japan in May this year.\n\nRecognizing the need for industrial restructuring and strengthened \ncompetitiveness, in 2011 the government stepped up efforts to enhance \ntechnological innovation, cultural and creative industries, R&D activities, \nand traditional industries. It also includes investment incentives \nfor innovative foreign and domestic investors. Diversification into \nrising industries, such as biotechnology, renewable energy, ecological \nagriculture, and medical care, will require stronger R&D support: \naccording to IMD\u2019s World Competitiveness Yearbook, total R&D spending \nin 2009 was equal to 2.9% of GDP, less than the 3.4% for the Republic of \nKorea and 3.5% for Japan.\n\nThe response of the private sector to diversifying and making itself \nmore competitive will be critical. Innovation in products and processes \nwill be essential, as well as deciding on what products to get out of or to \navoid. From a public policy perspective, perhaps the most important focus \nshould be on improving the investment regime and on opening more \nsectors to investment, thereby creating more opportunities for domestic \nand foreign investors. \n\nOne spur may be that Taipei,China\u2019s rank in Doing Business 2012 was \n25\u2014far behind both Singapore and Hong Kong, China (first and second), \nand the Republic of Korea (eighth, up from 15 in 2010). The government, \nin partnership with the private sector, needs to improve in those areas \nwhere the economy ranks poorly and to ease regulatory impediments in \nkey sectors. \n\n3.13.7  Export shares, by product\nElectronic products and equipment\nBase metals\nRubbers and plastics\nChemicals\nMachineries\nTextiles\nOther products\n\n% share\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n% share\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n70\n\n0\n\n-70\n\n08\n\n10\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and \nStatistics. http://eng.stat.gov.tw; CEIC Data Company (both \naccessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n3.13.8  Export shares, by destination\n\nPRC and Hong Kong, China\nASEAN-6\nUnited States\nEuropean Union\nJapan\nRest of the world\n\n09\n\n08\n\n10\n\n2007\n\n11\nNote: ASEAN-6\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, \nSingapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam; PRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s \nRepublic of China.\nSources: Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and \nStatistics. http://eng.stat.gov.tw; CEIC Data Company (both \naccessed 15 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.13.9  Selected share price movements, \nelectronics \n\nSemiconductors\nOptoelectronics\nElectronic parts or components\nElectronics\nComputer and peripheral equipment\n\nyear-on-year % change\n140\n\nJan\n2010\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n11\n\nFeb\n12\n\nNote: The data refer to subindexes in TWSE.\nSources: CEIC Data Company; TWSE. http://www.twse.com.\ntw (both accessed 15\u00a0March 2012). \nClick here for figure data\n\n\fSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\n\fAfghanistan\n\nFull  responsibility  for  security  is  to  be  handed  over  to  the  government  by  end-2014  as  international \ntroops are withdrawn. Since economic development (as well as security) has depended heavily on aid and \ninternational military spending, the transition  will  require  the  country to  find  new sources of growth and \nways  to  achieve  fiscal  sustainability,  in  an  uncertain  security  environment.  These  challenges  will  require \nmajor  domestic  efforts  and  reforms  alongside  substantial  external  support  by  donors  if  development \nmomentum  is  to  be  sustained.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth is estimated to have slowed to 5.7% in FY2011 (ending \n20\u00a0March 2012)\u2014following an 8.4% expansion the previous year\u2014mainly \nbecause of a large fall in agricultural foodgrain production owing to \nunfavorable weather conditions for a second year (Figure\u00a03.14.1).\n\nPrivate consumption remained the main source of economic growth, \n\nfueled by the large aid inflows that underpin most of the demand for \ngoods and services. Growth in services activity, which accounted for \n53% of GDP, moderated during the year, reflecting lower foreign inflows. \nDomestic investment is estimated at 22.6% of GDP, including private \ninvestment of just over a third of that.\n\nOpium production increased by 61% in 2011, rebounding from a \ndisease the year earlier that wiped out much of the crop, and farmers \nresponded to high prices offered by traffickers. Farm income for opium in \n2011 is estimated to exceed $1.4\u00a0billion, equivalent to nearly 8% of GDP;\nexport value may be as much as $2.4\u00a0billion. Opium is not counted as\npart of GDP, but earnings generated by it and then retained and spent in \nthe country boost domestic demand.\n\nConsumer prices are highly volatile because of heavy import \ndependence, including food and fuel (Figure\u00a03.14.2). Overall (year-on \n-year) inflation, which peaked at 18.2% in January 2011, receded to 9.2% in \nFebruary 2012, mainly due to a fall in food inflation, which dropped from \n21.0% to 7.1% mainly because of declining global food prices. Nonfood \ninflation was fairly stable\u00a0in this period\u2014varying around 14%\u2014kept high by \nprice adjustments for electricity and fuel, construction materials, transport, \nand housing rents. Average inflation in FY2011 is estimated at 10.5%.\n\nRevenue collection is estimated to have met the FY2011 budget target \n\nof AF98.8\u00a0billion (11.5% of GDP), reflecting tax administration reforms, \nimproved tax compliance, and new tax measures such as a business \nreceipts tax (Figure\u00a03.14.3). Operating expenditure is estimated to have \nincreased by 37.0% in FY2011, mainly because of growing security \nexpenditure taken on to the budget and rapid implementation of pay \nand grading reforms for civil servants.

The \ngovernment has been struggling to meet its budgetary targets to achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals, for example.\n\nThe central bank adopted a relatively tight monetary policy during \n\nFY2011 to contain inflation pressures, although they largely stemmed \nfrom global price increases. Growth in currency in circulation was cut by \nnearly half to 17.8% from 34.2% in FY2010. The afghani remained broadly \nstable\u00a0in real effective terms; it depreciated by about 8% against the dollar \nduring FY2011 (Figure\u00a03.14.4).\n\nThe current account deficit (excluding grants) is estimated to have \nnarrowed by about 5.5% of GDP to a deficit of 34.3% of GDP in FY2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.14.5). The narrowing trend reflects the fact that grant financing \nhas remained broadly stable\u00a0in dollar terms at about $6.3\u00a0billion in\nrecent\u00a0years but is falling in relation to a growing nominal GDP. \nIncluding grants, the current account is expected to run a surplus of 0.1% \nof GDP in FY2011, down from the 1.7% surplus in FY2010 due to a much \nsmaller expansion in exports. The financial account improved slightly \non increased foreign direct investment as a result of initial investment \nin mining industry. Gross international reserves are estimated to have \nincreased to $6.1\u00a0billion, equivalent to cover 8.4\u00a0months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic activity will continue to be driven mainly by consumption \nexpenditure and is expected to pick up to 7.1% in FY2012 (assuming more \nfavorable weather for agriculture). A slowdown to 5.8% is expected in \nFY2013, though, because of declining local spending from foreign security \nforces as they gradually withdraw and waning grant-financed development \nspending that is not channeled through the government budget. An \neconomic program with the IMF under its Extended Credit Facility was \nagreed in November 2011 and it provides an overall macroeconomic \nadjustment framework for the next 3\u00a0years, as well as guidance to reform \nbanking regulations after the failure of Kabul Bank (Box\u00a03.14.1).\n\nThe government\u2019s operating budget deficit will come under pressure \nin the next 2\u00a0years because of increases in security spending, continuing \npay and grading reforms in the civil service, absorption of the public \nservants paid by donors, and operation and maintenance cost of projects \nhanded over by donors. Projections indicate that recurrent spending will \nrise to 18.6% of GDP, while domestic revenues will stay at about 11.5% of \nGDP over the next 2\u00a0years, thus domestic revenue will fall by another \n3\u00a0percentage points to finance about 62% of recurrent expenditures. \nIncreases in operating and development grants, however, are expected to \nkeep total budget expenditure higher at over 25% of GDP in FY2012 and \nFY2013, or about 1.5\u20132\u00a0percentage points above that in FY2011.\n\nMonetary policy aims to bring down inflation to about 5% in the next \n\n2\u00a0years.

The \ncentral bank initially placed the bank \nunder conservatorship, appointed \nnew management and guaranteed all \ndeposits. Subsequently, Kabul Bank \nwas placed under receivership and its \nassets have been split into \u201cgood\u201d and \n\u201cbad\u201d banks.\n\nThe bank\u2019s deposits and good \nassets are with a bridge bank called \nNew Kabul Bank, which will likely be \nprivatized in FY2012. The bad assets \nhave been retained by the receiver, \nappointed and overseen by a newly \ncreated independent Financial Dispute \nResolution Committee. Based on the \nlatest estimates, around $935\u00a0million \n(principal and interest) are receivable, \nalthough this amount is likely to \nincrease when an audit is completed. \nFormal charges have been brought \nagainst two shareholders who represent \nover 50% of the assets sought for \nrecovery and seven bank officers, but \nthe legal process is moving slowly.\nThis crisis exemplifies the risks \nof rapid banking sector growth with \nweak governance and rule of law, and \na lack of capacity and experience in \nsupervision at the central bank. In \nNovember 2011, the government and \nIMF agreed to a new 3-year Extended \nCredit Facility that includes measures \nto address corruption and strengthen \nregulation and supervision over the \nbanking system.\n\nstable\u00a0global commodity prices, indicating that this objective is attainable. \nThe monetary authorities also intend, as in the past, to operate to smooth \nout volatility in the exchange rate and strengthen international reserves. \nDonors\u2019 projected substantial, though declining, aid inflows will facilitate \nmeeting these objectives.\n\nForeign aid will continue to finance most of the balance-of-payments \n\ndeficit, though pressures here will begin to emerge in the next 2\u00a0years. \nThe current account deficit (excluding grants) as a share of GDP is \nprojected to fall to 33.2% in FY2012 to 31.5% in FY2013 as responsibility for \nsecurity is handed over to the government. Mainly because of reduced \n(export) sales to nonresidents and also some fall off in public grants, the \ncurrent account balance (including grants) will turn to a deficit estimated \nat 1.1% of GDP in FY2012 and 2.5% of GDP in FY2013. Because domestic \nexports are so small, the country has very limited debt-carrying capacity \nand will be forced to rely on foreign direct investment and highly \nconcessional loan assistance to cover these deficits.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014coping with the transition\nThe planned foreign troop pullout by end-2014 is seen lowering annual \ngrowth by at least 2\u20133\u00a0percentage points after that date, due to reduced \nlocal spending by these forces and by foreign civilian organizations with \ninternational and national staff. Unemployment will go up when local \nstaff hired by foreign security and civilian organizations are laid off.\n\nThe fiscal impact of the transition will come mainly from increasing \n\npressure on the government to take over externally financed operating \nexpenditures (security and nonsecurity); declining grants to the \ngovernment\u2019s development budget; and donors\u2019 continuously declining \nexternally financed development budgets (some of their projects will \nbe brought on budget). Over the next 10\u00a0years, fiscal policy will have to \nbalance the takeover of externally financed security spending and other \nexpenditures, while increasing propoor and development outlays within \na very tight budget constraint. The transition will lead to limited fiscal \nspace, thereby pushing back fiscal sustainability (defined as domestic \nrevenue funding the government\u2019s recurrent expenditure). Without \nsustained, high grant assistance, the concept of fiscal sustainability is \nreduced to fiscal survival.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s debt burden could rise substantially in the near future. \n\nCurrent public sector debt is around 12.1% of GDP, but with a heavy \nreliance on external grants to finance its budget, a rapid reduction in \ngrants could require the government to assume new loans to meet its \nfinancing needs. A worsening security environment could exacerbate \nthese financing requirements and reduce the government\u2019s ability even to \ncollect domestic revenue.\n\nThe external sector will be affected through pressures on the current \naccount balance and the exchange rate due to declining aid inflows. But \na weak policy, regulatory, and institutional framework seems to be more \nchallenging for Afghanistan\u2019s competitiveness than the exchange rate, \nas shown by the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Report 2012. Afghanistan \nstands at 160 out of 183 countries, showing further degradation from 154 \nthe previous year. \n\n\fBangladesh\n\nEconomic  growth  in  FY2011  continued  strong.  Macroeconomic  imbalances,  however,  have  emerged: \nthe  balance  of  payments  is  under  strain  from  high  commodity  prices,  increased  oil  imports  for  power \ngeneration, and weakened exports; rising subsidy costs, mainly for fuel, are intensifying fiscal pressures and \ndomestic borrowing, and inflation is at a multiyear high. Growth is expected to slow as the country grapples \nwith  these  imbalances.  Lifting  growth  in  the  medium  term  entails  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks, \nmobilizing  additional  budget  resources,  attracting  greater  investment,  and  upgrading  labor  skills.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth picked up slightly to 6.7% in FY2011 (ended June 2011) from 6.1% \n(Figure\u00a03.15.1). The upturn reflected a robust industrial expansion at 8.2% \nbecause of a strong rebound in export-oriented manufacturing and better \nperformance by domestic market-based industries. More reliable power \nsupply to industry helped performance, as contracted, private small plants \nbegan supplying power to the national grid. Agriculture maintained \nstrong growth of 5.0%, aided by favorable weather and better access to \ncredit and extension services. An expansion in trade activities helped \nmaintain services growth of 6.6%.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption, supported by a surge in \ncredit, was the key growth driver in FY2011. Total fixed investment rose \nonly slightly to 24.7% of GDP, from 24.4% in the previous year. Foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) remained very low, at less than $1\u00a0billion.\n\nAverage annual inflation rose to 8.8% from 7.3% in FY2010 owing to \nthe marked rise in global food and commodity prices, a strong expansion \nin domestic credit, and depreciation of the taka in the latter half of the \nfiscal year. Price pressures have intensified in FY2012 and year-on-year \ninflation climbed slightly from 10.2% in June 2011 to 10.4% in February \n2012; nonfood inflation more than doubled to 13.6% but food inflation \nedged down to 8.9% (Figure\u00a03.15.2). In addition to the rapid expansion \nin credit, stronger price pressures came from upward adjustments in \ndomestic administered fuel and electricity prices, and from sharper taka \ndepreciation because of continued high import demand, especially fuel \nimports.\n\nNet credit to government, which grew rapidly by 35.0% in FY2011, shot \n\nup to 62.4% in the 12\u00a0months to\u00a0January 2012 (Figure\u00a03.15.3), coinciding \nwith a rapid rise in the cost of subsidies financed by the budget. Credit \nto the private sector, which climbed by 25.8% in FY2011, slowed to 18.9% \nby January 2012, although it remained higher than the annual monetary \nprogram target of 18.0%. The central bank raised policy rates to rein in \nthe credit expansion and attendant domestic demand pressures, but it \n\nThis chapter was written by Mohammad Zahid Hossain, Md.

Total \ngovernment spending increased by nearly 25% to 15.9% of GDP from \n14.6% in the previous year, as current spending mounted because of a rise \nin subsidies for food, fuel, fertilizer, and electricity. The budget deficit \n(4.3% of GDP) nonetheless, remained below target (5.0%), largely because \nimplementation of the annual development program was weak, reflecting \ncontinued capacity constraints in key line agencies. The bulk of the \nbudget financing came from domestic sources (3.4% of GDP), mostly from \nthe banking system (Figure\u00a03.15.4), as sales of national saving certificates \nfell off from the high level a year earlier and foreign financing was lower \nthan expected (0.9%).\n\nExport growth jumped to 41.7% in FY2011, reflecting a sharp recovery \n\nin garment demand in the main markets in the European Union (EU) \nand the United States (US) and a pickup in garment exports to new \nmarkets though these remain a small part of total sales. Garment export \nearnings grew by 43.4%, buoyed in part by higher export prices following \nthe rise in prices of cotton, yarn, and accessories. Exports of other \nproducts also grew rapidly with a rise in demand and also reflecting the \nlow base in the previous year.\n\nImports grew in step by 41.8% owing to larger import costs of raw \nmaterials for the garment industry, higher global commodity prices\u2014\nespecially for foodgrains, fertilizer, and fuel\u2014and the generally strong \ndomestic demand conditions. Foodgrain imports rose very steeply, \nbuoyed by larger volumes as well as price, as the government sought to \nbuild large stocks to bolster food security. Because the base for imports \nis much larger than that for exports, even with similar growth rates, the \ntrade deficit widened by 2.0% of GDP. Worker remittances, the main \noffset to the trade deficit, expanded by only 6.0% however, down from \n13.4% the previous year.\n\nThe larger trade deficit and slower growth in remittances took the \ncurrent account surplus down sharply to only $995.0\u00a0million (0.9% of\nGDP) in FY2011 from $3.7\u00a0billion (3.7%) the previous year (Figure\u00a03.15.5).\nThe combined capital and financial accounts recorded a deficit of \n$984.0\u00a0million in FY2011, versus the deficit of $139.0\u00a0million in FY2010,\nbecause of the larger outflows on account of trade credit and lower net \ninflows of foreign assistance. The overall deficit was $925.0\u00a0million in\nFY2011, a sharp turnaround from the surplus of $2.9\u00a0billion in FY2010.\nBecause of rapidly growing import demand, the exchange rate \ncame under pressure, especially in the second half of FY2011, and the \ntaka depreciated by 6.3% against the dollar during the year. Balance-\nof-payments pressures continued in the first 7\u00a0months of FY2012 and \nthe taka depreciated further by 12.2% (Figure\u00a03.15.6). The real effective \nexchange rate depreciated by 9.0% in the year to January 2012, implying \nsome gain in export competitiveness, as nominal depreciation of the \ncurrency offset higher inflation than in major trading partners.\n\n3.15.3  Credit growth\n\nCredit to private sector\nCredit to government (net)\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n11\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. 2012.

It is expected that \ncredit tightening measures announced in the central bank\u2019s January \n2012 Monetary Policy Statement would more effectively damp inflation \nin FY2013. It is also assumed that the government will further raise fuel \nand electricity prices, and mobilize more foreign financing of the budget, \nas part of its efforts to eliminate external and domestic imbalances and \nput the economy on a sustainable higher growth path. Finally, political \nstability and normal weather are expected to prevail.\n\nGDP growth in FY2012 is projected to slow to 6.2%. The performance \n\nof exports, a key growth driver, is weakening as the year progresses, \nlargely because of weaknesses in its key market, the eurozone, which is in \na prolonged period of adjustment to its debt crisis. Export growth slowed \nsharply to 13.0% in the first 8\u00a0months of FY2012, from 40.3% in the year-\nearlier period, which will also affect production in export-linked domestic \nindustries. The rise in interest rates is expected to moderate domestic \ndemand. GDP growth in FY2013 is expected to slip to 6.0% as interest rates \nare raised to bring down inflation, and as export growth slows further.\nAgricultural growth in FY2012 will moderate to 4.4%, crimped by \nrising irrigation costs (reflecting higher fuel and electricity prices) and \nbecause of the high base in the previous year. In FY2013, sector growth is \nprojected to rise slightly to 4.5% in response to better procurement prices, \nas the government steps up food procurement programs and strengthens \npolicy support.\n\nIndustrial growth is expected to slow to 7.8% in FY2012, mainly \nreflecting falling export demand. Higher interest rates and labor costs \nas well as the expected increases in fuel and electricity prices will \nfurther raise the cost of production and squeeze profit margins. Higher \ninterest rates will also weaken the construction industry and investment \nactivity. Industrial growth is projected to ease to 7.5% in FY2013 reflecting \npolicies to eliminate imbalances in the economy taking greater hold, and \nweakening domestic and external demand conditions.\n\nIn FY2012, services growth will slip to 6.2%, as growth in agriculture \n\nand industry slows. With industry activity slowing further in FY2013, \nexpansion in services will ease to 6.0%.\n\nAnnual average inflation will edge up to 11.0% in FY2012. While food \n\ninflation has traditionally driven up the headline rate, the sharp rise in \nnonfood prices from July 2011 has emerged as a major policy concern. To \nrein in inflation, the central bank continued the previous year\u2019s credit-\ntightening measures and raised its policy rates in September 2011 and \nJanuary 2012 by 100 basis points each, to 7.75% and 5.75%, respectively. \nThey are expected to be raised more. In January 2012, the central bank \nabolished the cap on commercial bank lending rates to more effectively \ntransmit its policy to the private sector. Inflation is projected to slow to \n8.5% in FY2013 as monetary tightening takes greater hold.\n\nOverseas workers remitted $8.4\u00a0billion in the first 8\u00a0months of FY2012,\n12.2% more than in the equivalent period a year earlier, reflecting a steep \nrise in the number of workers leaving for overseas jobs since June 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.15.7).

Remittances are expected to grow by 10.0% \nin FY2012, from 6.0% a year earlier, and rise further by 12.0% in FY2013.\nExport growth is projected to slow to 12.0% in FY2012 and further \nto 10.0% in FY2013, mainly reflecting weak demand for garments (over \nthree-fourths of exports) from the eurozone and from the US, which is \nexperiencing a slow recovery from its financial crisis. In the first 8\u00a0months \nof FY2012, growth in knitwear exports declined sharply to 8.7%, from \n43.9% in the year-earlier period, although growth in woven fabric exports \nheld up well at 22.2% (Figure\u00a03.15.8), benefiting from the EU\u2019s relaxed rules \nof origin (from January 2011). Growth in other export items also slowed \nmarkedly. While taka depreciation should favor exporters, the benefits are \nbeing largely negated by the lower prices negotiated by garment buyers. \nAlthough garment exports to new (mainly developing country) markets are \nbecoming more important, they are yet to become major markets to offset \ndeclining exports to the EU and US, the two dominant traditional markets.\nImports grew by 15.6% in the first 7\u00a0months of FY2012. Growth in \nimports of foodgrains, consumer goods, capital machinery and industrial \nraw materials moderated from a year ago, although some intermediate \ngoods, especially fuel and fertilizer, grew very strongly. Imports are \nforecast to grow by 17.0% in FY2012 and stay robust at 15.0% in FY2013 \nto cover fuel requirements for what is becoming a more reliable power \ngeneration, even as economic growth moderates.\n\nThe current account is projected to move to a deficit of 0.5% of GDP \n\nin FY2012 and to 1.0% in FY2013 as the trade deficit widens further \n(Figure\u00a03.15.9). Foreign exchange reserves declined further in the first \n8\u00a0months of FY2012 (Figure\u00a03.15.10) as the current account surplus nearly \nhalved and a large deficit was still recorded in the capital and financial \naccounts. Net inflows of foreign assistance declined, although FDI inflows \nrose marginally. Pressure on the balance of payments is expected to \nintensify in the forecast period, with larger import payments relative \nto export and remittance receipts. The government is seeking to adopt \npolicies to address the growing imbalances, including discussing a 3-year \nprogram with the International Monetary Fund under its Extended \nCredit Facility.\n\nThe FY2012 budget aimed at revenue growth of 24.4%, although \nrevenue collection in the first 7\u00a0months of the fiscal year indicates that \nthis target is unlikely to be met. The budget set growth in public spending \nat 25.8%. While current spending is likely to greatly exceed the budgeted \namount because of the rapid rise in subsidies, utilization of the annual \ndevelopment program will again fall short of allocation, which is expected \nto keep the fiscal deficit within the budgeted 5.0% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.15.11). \nDomestic financing, mainly from banks, was set to cover 3.7% of GDP, \nwhile the remaining 1.3% was planned to come from foreign financing.\nSubsidies are putting increasing pressure on the budget. The \ngovernment has raised fuel and electricity prices in phases to cut \nthem, but these adjustments are too small to cover rising costs. Indeed, \nspending on subsidies is expected to increase from the previous year\u2019s \n2.2% of GDP to 3.4% in FY2012, or more than a quarter of projected \nrevenue collection for the year.\n\n3.15.8  Growth in exports and components\n\nTotal\nKnitwear products\n\nWoven garments\nOthers\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nJul\u2212Feb\n FY11\n\nJul\u2212Feb \nFY12\n\nSources: Bangladesh Bank. 2012.

It has obtained a \n$2.5\u00a0billion loan from the Islamic Development Bank, but unless further\ntimely adjustments in fuel prices are made, this loan will ultimately have \nto be repaid from budgetary resources.\n\nThe projections are subject to various downside risks. The global \neconomic slowdown may be more severe than expected, while policy \ntightening could be compromised by political considerations: the \ngovernment may find it politically costly to further raise fuel and \nelectricity prices.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening growth policies\nIn the short term, Bangladesh needs to reduce its growing fiscal and \nexternal imbalances. It needs to cut subsidies by adjusting fuel and \nelectricity prices, creating space for more\u2014acutely needed\u2014outlays \non infrastructure and human development, and reducing the budget\u2019s \nexcessive domestic borrowing. The effort to expand the economy\u2019s \nproductive capacity will also require higher domestic revenue, which \ncould be raised by strengthening tax reforms and attracting more \nconcessional financing. Monetary policy tightening would need to \ncontinue to reduce inflation and eliminate pressure on reserves through \nreducing import demand. Exports need to be raised through broadening \nthe export base and deepening access to new markets.\n\nOver the long term, the government needs to substantially improve \n\nthe business climate (Figure\u00a03.15.12) in order to scale up private \ninvestment, including FDI, as highlighted in the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2012. As shown in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global \nCompetitiveness Report 2011\u201312, Bangladesh lags far behind other \ncountries in South Asia in infrastructure (Table\u00a03.15.2). To mobilize \nresources needed for closing these wide infrastructure gaps, greater \nprivate participation in infrastructure development, including public\u2013\nprivate partnerships, is essential to supplement finite public resources. \nThe capital market also needs to be developed as a source of long-term \ninfrastructure financing.\n\nBangladesh has a raft of strategic advantages, including cheap labor \n\nand a location in a fast-growing region, which can help attract large \nFDI inflows into light industry. In \nseveral countries in Asia, labor costs \nare rising fast, opening up prospects \nfor foreign investors to relocate \ninvestment to Bangladesh. To attract \ngreater FDI, however, it is essential \nto remove infrastructure bottlenecks, \nmake land readily available, upgrade \nskills of the labor force, and \nremove administrative delays and \nimpediments.\n\nBangladesh\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nCountry \nrankinga\n\n129\n69\n86\n109\n48\n\n3.15.2  Comparison of infrastructure quality, 2011\n\nOverall \ninfrastructure\n\nElectricity Roads Railroads Ports\n\nAir \ntransport\n\n1\u00a0=\u00a0extremely underdeveloped, 7\u00a0=\u00a0extensive and efficient  \n(by international standards) \n\n2.8\n4.2\n3.8\n3.5\n4.7\n\n1.6\n5.5\n3.1\n2.2\n5.0\n\n2.9\n4.4\n3.4\n3.7\n4.5\n\n2.5\n4.6\n4.4\n2.8\n3.8\n\n3.4\n4.5\n3.9\n4.1\n4.9\n\n3.5\n4.6\n4.7\n4.3\n4.9\n\na  Ranking out of 142 countries, 1 = best.\nSource: 2011 World Economic Forum, The Global Competitiveness Report 2011\u20132012.\n\n\fBhutan\n\nAfter  a  solid  year,  the  outlook  remains  favorable  with  growth  staying  robust,  in  part  driven  by  the \nconstruction of large hydropower projects. Current account deficits will remain high, though, reflecting the \nprojects\u2019  import  requirements\u2014but  associated  capital  inflows  are  expected  to  keep  the  overall  balance \nof  payments  in  surplus.  A  main  challenge  for  government  is  to  implement  policies  that  would  rapidly \nexpand  private  sector  activity  to  boost  job  opportunities  and  broaden  the  country\u2019s  economic  base.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth is estimated to have moderated slightly to 8.3% in FY2011 (ended \n30\u00a0June 2011) from 9.3% a year earlier (Figure\u00a03.16.1). Reflecting the \ncountry\u2019s hydropower project cycle, the construction phase is under way \non four large projects that would more than double power capacity, thus \nconstruction and manufacturing (cement mainly) are the main drivers \nof expansion. Electricity generation capacity has not risen since 2007, so \npower production provided little impetus to growth\u2014sales to India rose \nby only about 4% during the year. Expansion in services eased solely on \ncommunity services while the rest of the components remained robust.\n\nAgriculture has been unable to record significant growth in the past \n7\u00a0fiscal\u00a0years, and is gradually losing its overall share of output, because it \nis hard to provide development services to raise productivity to the many \nsmall villages in the remote mountainous parts of the country.\n\nBroad money (M2) growth moderated\u2014along with the economy\u2014to \n\n21.2% in FY2011, mainly due to small expansion in net foreign assets. \nPrivate sector credit grew 31.9% in FY2011, broadly in line with its \nlong-term average of 32%, concentrated in housing and construction and \nin personal loans. The ratio of nonperforming loans declined to 8.5% at \nend-FY2011 from 10.2% a year earlier.\n\nLocal price movements continue to follow India\u2019s because Bhutan\u2019s \n\ncurrency is pegged to India\u2019s and because the country keeps strong \ntrading ties with its giant neighbor (taking about 90% of exports and \nproviding 75% of imports). Bhutan\u2019s average inflation, therefore, rose to \n8.6% in FY2011, almost twice the FY2010 rate. (Food prices rose by 9.3% \nand nonfood prices by 8.0%\u2014Figure\u00a03.16.2.)\n\nThe government revenue-to-GDP ratio fell to 39.1% in FY2011 from \n\n46.4% a year earlier as nontax revenue growth slowed (Figure\u00a03.16.3). \nExpenditures (43.8% of GDP) rose by 14.4% in FY2011 on the back of \nrising capital expenditures reflecting hydropower construction and a pay \nhike for public servants from January 2011. The fiscal deficit was 4.7% of \nGDP in FY2011 (from a surplus equivalent to 1.6% of GDP in FY2010) and \nwas financed mostly from domestic borrowing.\n\nThis chapter was written by Jeffry Kongoasa and Ruzette Mariano of the South Asia \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.16.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\nAgriculture\nElectricity\nOther industries\n\n12.6\n\n10.8\n\nConstruction\nServices\nTaxes net of subsidies\n\nPercentage points\n\n9.3\n\n8.3\n\n5.7\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: National Statistics Bureau. 2011.

By currency, nearly three-\nfifths was in Indian rupees; by use, just over two-fifths of the total had been \nallotted for hydropower loans and the balance for development projects.\n\nEven though the current account deficit widened from 9.9% of GDP \nin FY2010 to about 20.6% in FY2011 as trade deficit widened from 20.9% \nof GDP to 30.2%, the overall balance of payments recorded a sizable \nsurplus equivalent to 5.7% of GDP as loans and capital grants more than \ncompensated for the current account deficit (Figure\u00a03.16.4). However, \nBhutan\u2019s external position with India has weakened greatly because \nexport growth to it has slowed, given that power sales have reached \ngeneration capacity and that import demand has accelerated because \nof the power construction program and strong economic growth. At \nend-FY2011 Bhutan\u2019s rupee reserves amounted to about one week of \nimports, although convertible currency reserves were high at nearly \n$890\u00a0million, equivalent to about 9\u00a0months of total (essential and\ninessential) imports (Figure\u00a03.16.5).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast at 8.0% for FY2012 and 8.5% for FY2013 largely on \nthe account of continued hydropower construction. The FY2012 budget \nwill continue to support high growth with total planned expenditure to \nincrease by about 11%. More than half the budget is allocated to capital \nexpenditure, which rises by about 13%, with about two-thirds of it financed \nby grants. Current expenditure is slated to grow by 9%, mainly on account \nof public servants\u2019 salary revisions and higher operations and maintenance \nexpenses. The overall deficit is projected to rise to 6% of GDP.\n\nInflation is expected to moderate to 7.3% in FY2012 and 6.5% in \nFY2013, broadly in line with assumed price developments in India. The \nAsian Development Outlook baseline forecast of relative stable\u00a0global oil \nand food prices underpins a favorable outlook.\n\nThe current account deficit is projected to stay high at 20.0% and \n22.2% of GDP in FY2012 and FY2013, mainly owing to continued high \nimports for power plant construction. The overall balance of payments \nis expected to remain in surplus reflecting continued substantial project \nloans and capital grants. The tight overall balance with India is not \nexpected to improve and pressures on rupee liquidity will persist.\n\nIn recent years the RMA has borrowed through an overdraft facility \n(at relatively steep rates) with the State Bank of India and through a credit \nline with the government of India to keep an adequate working balance. \nIts borrowing from the overdraft exceeded Rs8\u00a0billion as well as reaching \nthe Rs3\u00a0billion credit line limit with the government before end-2011. The \nRMA sold $200\u00a0million of its convertible currency reserves in November\n2011 to eliminate this expensive overdraft and to partly pay other rupee \ndebt. However, liquidity pressures caused the RMA in March 2012 to clamp \ndown on import spending and to restrict the use of reserves to importing \npriority items, including fuel. Because Bhutan\u2019s constitution requires \nforeign reserves to provide 12\u00a0months of cover for essential imports and \nthey are about at this level, there is limited scope to sell additional reserves. \nTo avoid disrupting the economy, the RMA is, therefore, expected by \n\n3.16.3  Fiscal indicators\n\nTotal revenue\nOverall balance\n\nCapital expenditure\nCurrent expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: Royal Monetary Authority. 2012.

Power exports from the plants \nunder construction will, of course, provide an enduring solution.\n\nThe RMA and the Reserve Bank of India are working to establish \nguidelines to create a base-rate system for Bhutanese financial institutions, \nexpected to come in this fiscal year, which would make loan pricing more \ntransparent and foster competition in the sector. This is a precursor to the \nRMA\u2019s carrying out monetary policy by setting policy rates, a change that \nwould be a more effective mechanism for monetary policy.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014broadening the economic base\nThe private sector needs to expand to tackle rising unemployment. The \nunemployment rate has averaged 3.5% in the last 3\u00a0years, well above the \ngovernment target of 2.5% set for 2013. Unemployment is an especially \nserious problem among those aged 15 to 24\u00a0years\u2014over 45% of the \nunemployed, this group has a 9.4% jobless rate (Figure\u00a03.16.6). This stems \nfrom limited job openings and deficiencies in labor skills necessary for \nemployability in various sectors. The government is the employer of \nchoice especially among the young but the absorptive capacity of the \npublic sector to hire more staff is nearing saturation. Hydropower\u2014the \nindustrial mainstay\u2014offers very few jobs.\n\nThe government recognizes the problem. Its Economic Development \nPolicy, issued in 2010, specified fiscal incentives to attract foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI). It has, therefore, drafted new FDI regulations that \ninclude clearer provisions for owning land as well as liberalizing other \nfeatures of current regulations. The policy also identified niche business \nopportunities for cottage and small industries and tourism, where the \ngovernment believes it can promote local entrepreneurship.\n\nThe government has identified the information and communication \ntechnology industry as a promising niche sector. The country\u2019s first park \nfor this, the Thimpu Techpark, was inaugurated in 2011 and is expected to \nattract FDI and provide some high-skilled jobs. The industry is, however, \nstill at a very early stage.\n\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s 2010 Bhutan Investment Climate \n\nAssessment Report, the top constraint for small firms is access to \nfinance. In an effort to ease it, the government has recently adopted \nexpanded microfinance policies, including subsidized interest rates, new \ncredit products suitable\u00a0for small firms, and incentives for socially and \nenvironmentally friendly lending.\n\nThe same report notes that the major constraint for large firms is \ninadequate education. The 2011 Labor Force Survey Report noted that \nonly 6% of the work force has received higher secondary education (and \n3% has tertiary education) (Figure\u00a03.16.7). The government has introduced \ncompetency-based training programs for five trades, namely, auto-\nmechanics, construction carpentry, plumbing, masonry, and industrial \nelectrical.

A  combination  of  tight  monetary  policy  to  counter  persistently  high  inflation, \nstrained  global  economic  conditions,  larger  subsidies  that  pushed  up  the  budget  deficit,  and  lack  of \npolitical consensus on resolving the policy impediments to growth were factors in the downdraft. Boosting \ninvestment and growth to match the strong performance of recent\u00a0years will hinge on reaching agreement \non measures to deal with long-standing and challenging policy issues. The outlook is for a moderate pickup.\n\nInvestment growth recovered quickly from its low point in the depths \n\n9.3\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic growth fell to 6.9% in FY2011 (ended 31\u00a0March 2012) from 8.4% in \nFY2010 according to the government\u2019s advance estimates. The pace slowed \nas the year progressed (Figure\u00a03.17.1). The slowdown was concentrated in \nindustry and driven by slumping investment activity, falling exports in the \nlatter months, and attendant weakening in consumer spending.\n\nof the global financial crisis, although the trend reversed once more to \na marked decline over the past 2\u00a0fiscal\u00a0years (Figure\u00a03.17.2). Notably, in \nthe first 3\u00a0quarters of FY2011, fixed investment is estimated to have fallen \nby 0.25% from the corresponding period a year earlier, although the \ngovernment\u2019s advance estimates of GDP for the full fiscal year show an \nincrease of 5.6%.\n\nHowever the final data for the year turn out, the downward trend is \nevident\u2014as is the need to reverse it to get the country back on its recent-\nyear high growth path. The causes of investment\u2019s sharp deceleration are \nmultiple, including the slump in the global economy and trade, tighter \nmonetary policy and higher nominal interest rates (to combat persistent \nhigh inflation), a larger than expected budget deficit in FY2011 (adding to \nuncertainty over the direction of the economy), and a growing sense of \na national policy paralysis (due to political parties\u2019 inability to agree on \ncertain issues, including structural measures). \n\nIndustrial growth dropped to a decade-low 3.9%. Slumping investment \n\ntook its toll: manufacturing growth fell by half to 3.9%, largely reflecting \nweak capital goods output, and construction growth fell to 4.8% from \n8.0% a year earlier. In industry, mining contracted by 2.2%, partly due \nto uncertainty over land and environmental clearances. Coal production \ncontinued its slowing-growth trend of recent years, shrinking by 1.5%. \nThe controlling state monopoly is unable to ramp up production to meet \nrapidly growing demand from new power plants, thereby increasing \nreliance on more costly imports. Natural gas production fell by 8.8%, \nowing to technical problems at a large new field and pricing issues. \n\nThis chapter was written by Abhijit Sen Gupta of the India Resident Mission, ADB, \nNew Delhi.\n\n3.17.1  GDP growth by sector\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\n8.4\n\n8.4\n\n6.7\n\n6.9\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.2  Investment growth indicators\n\nGDP growth (at factor cost)\nInvestment growth\nReal repo rate\n\nServices\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\nQ1\n2006\n\nQ1\n07\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 24 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia    167\n\nOn a brighter note, services continued to grow rapidly, at \n9.4%, accounting for nearly 80% of overall GDP growth and \nreflecting continued strong performance in trade, hotels, transport, \ncommunications, and financial services. With good monsoons, rice and \nwheat production is estimated to have hit records. Agriculture\u2019s 2.5% \nexpansion was low compared with the previous year\u2019s weather-related \n7.0% recovery, but still came in close to trend (3%).\n\nInflation, which persisted at 9.5\u201310% through most of FY2011 despite \n\nearlier rounds of monetary tightening, eased to 7.0% by February 2012 \n(Figure\u00a03.17.3). This moderation largely reflected a drop in food prices. \nA proxy for the core rate, nonfood manufactured goods inflation \nremained at around 8% then fell to 5.5% in February 2012. Since monetary \ntightening aimed to stabilize this measure, the central bank has seen \nprogress in bringing it down to its historical average of 4%, consistent \nwith maintaining stable\u00a0inflationary expectations.\n\nAfter 13 consecutive policy rate hikes since March 2010, the Reserve \n\nBank of India (RBI) left rates on hold at its December 2011 and February \n2012 policy review meetings (Figure\u00a03.17.4). With progress on slowing \nnonfood inflation, as of late-March 2012 it was expected to relax monetary \npolicy for the new fiscal year when the deficit-reduction measures \nannounced in the FY2012 budget in mid-March are passed by Parliament. \n\nCredit growth moderated in FY2011 across a broad spectrum of \nactivities, reflecting slowing economic activity, monetary tightening, and \nbanks\u2019 risk aversion. Asset quality of banks deteriorated moderately due \nto weaker business conditions.\n\nThe RBI deregulated the savings deposit rate\u2014allowing banks to set \ndifferential interest rates on savings deposits over a minimum amount\u2014\nand, to a large degree, interest rates on the various nonresident Indian \ndeposit facilities.\n\nA revenue shortfall and expenditure overshoot, relative to target, \npushed the central government budget deficit to an estimated 5.9% of \nGDP in FY2011, as against the 4.6% budget target. Revenue was down by \n3.3% from the previous year when it was bolstered by large receipts from \nauctions of third-generation telecommunications spectrum. It was also \n5.7% short of target, about equally due to a shortfall in the planned sale of \ngovernment-held stock in public sector corporations because of weak stock \nmarket conditions and to the economic slowdown denting tax collections.\nExpenditure grew by 10.1% in FY2011 and was nearly 5% above the \nbudget target, mainly owing to greater subsidies. Higher global prices \nand a weaker currency led to an increase in fuel (190%) and fertilizer \n(34%) subsidies, while higher minimum agricultural support prices helped \nraise the cost of food subsidies (20%) over the budget targets. All these \nsubsidies amounted to 2.3% of GDP in FY2011. \n\nThe current account deficit widened to an estimated 3.6% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.17.5). The very rapid growth in exports in the first half of FY2011 \nwas not sustained in the second owing to slowing demand from advanced \neconomies, restricting growth to 21.0% at $303\u00a0billion. Higher commodity\nprices and an increase in import volume, including large imports of gold, \ngenerated a 24.0% rise in imports to $473\u00a0billion, expanding the trade\ndeficit to 9.1% of GDP (from 7.6% in FY2010), partly offset by a strong \nservices trade surplus and larger remittances. \n\n3.17.3 Wholesale price index\n\nOverall\nFuel and power\n\nFood articles\nNonfood manufactures\n\n%, year on year\n24\n\n12\n\n0\n\n-12\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\n \n\nFeb\n12\n\nSource: Ministry of Industry and Commerce.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.4  Policy interest rates\n\nReverse repo rate\n\nRepo rate\n\n1 Jan\n2008\n\n   \n\n1 Jan\n09\n\n      \n\n1 Jan\n10\n\n \n\n \n\n1 Jan\n11\n\n \n1 Jan \n12\n\nNote: The base rate was adopted to provide an accurate \nindicator of the minimum rates charged to prime \nborrowers.\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 27 March 2012); ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.5  Current account indicators\n\nCurrent account balance\nMerchandise exports\nMerchandise imports\nServices (net)\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Reserve Bank of India. \nClick here for figure data\n\nBase rate\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n21 Mar \n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n\f168    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nThe heavy current account deficit was mostly financed by financial \ninflows. With concerns over sovereign debt and fiscal prospects in the \nUnited States and eurozone, net portfolio inflows were slight for much of \nthe year but picked up after November to reach an estimated $15\u00a0billion\nin FY2011, about half that of a year earlier. Improved foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) and larger commercial borrowing and bank loans by \nthe private sector rounded out the financing. \n\nOfficial gross international reserves fell by about $10\u00a0billion (to about\n\n$295\u00a0billion), mainly in the latter months of the year (Figure\u00a03.17.6) on\nintervention by the RBI to prevent excessive downward drift (and volatility) \nin the exchange rate. Over FY2011, the rupee depreciated by about 12% \nagainst the US dollar; the real effective exchange rate weakened by about \n4% (Figure\u00a03.17.7). Stock market prices drifted lower for most of FY2011 and \nthen strengthened in early 2012, helped by a marked increase in portfolio \ninvestment. Nevertheless, the BSE Sensex was down about 10% in FY2011.\n\nEconomic prospects\nInvestment is likely to remain lackluster for some time because new \nproject announcements continued to decline during the third quarter of \nFY2011 (Figure\u00a03.17.8). Data on planned capital spending from the Centre \nfor Monitoring Indian Economy also point toward a sharp increase in \nthe number of stalled projects, reflecting a host of structural bottlenecks \nrelated to fuel and power shortages, delays in environmental clearance, \nand other policy hurdles. \n\nBusiness sentiment has deteriorated on various indicators in the \nRBI\u2019s Business Expectation Index (Figure\u00a03.17.9), and in similar surveys \nconducted by chambers of commerce. On balance, these business \nindicators suggest that investment will remain subdued in FY2012. \n\nThe impact of monetary easing and lower interest rates, improving \nexternal conditions, and some progress on stalled reforms and removal \nof the bottlenecks should lead to a revival of industrial activity starting \nin the second half of FY2012 and into FY2013. But their effect is likely \nto be limited until the government eliminates the policy issues. Recent \nsteps, such as increasing the pace of road building as well as fast-track \nclearances for coal and power projects, are encouraging, though many \nother issues remain in the wings. \n\nA normal monsoon would help agriculture expand at its trend rate \n(around 3%), in turn bolstering rural incomes and private consumption. \nThe services sector, which has so far been resilient to the domestic \nslowdown, is expected to maintain its solid growth, supported by robust \ntrends in private consumption spending and in urbanization. The global \nslowdown is, however, likely to trim growth in software and business \nservices. \n\nBased on assumptions for growth in industrial countries and oil prices, \n\nas well as expected moves toward monetary easing coupled with budget \ndeficit reduction, GDP growth in FY2012 is forecast to nudge up to 7.0%. \nRecovery in the global economy and resolution of some of the structural \nbottlenecks are expected to increase GDP growth to 7.5% in FY2013.\nSustaining the progress against inflation in FY2012 depends on \nmacroeconomic policies and structural reforms.

With rising \nincomes, demand has increased faster than supply for these, thus \nagricultural policies will need to be directed to improving the efficiency \nof the regulatory, production, and distribution systems. There is also \nconsiderable suppressed inflation, as the administered prices of diesel, \nkerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas\u2014significantly below global oil \nprices\u2014require heavy budget subsidies. Adjusting domestic prices will \npush up inflation but is necessary to align fiscal policy with the needs of \nexpanding infrastructure investment.\n\nInflation is expected to continue to decline in FY2012 due to the strong \n\nbase effect, normal monsoons in FY2011, weakening global commodity \nprices, and lagged impact of monetary policy on expectations suppressing \ndemand-side inflation. Consequently, inflation is expected to ease to 7.0% \nin FY2012. The rate in FY2013 will depend on tackling structural food price \npressures and the extent of fiscal consolidation, as FY2013 is a pre-election \nyear. An easing of crude oil prices and supply-side bottlenecks is likely to \ncontribute to inflation falling further to 6.5% in FY2013.\n\nIncreasing tax rates, widening the tax net, and capping the subsidy \n\nbill are expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.1% of GDP in FY2012, \nsignaling a return to fiscal consolidation (Figure\u00a03.17.10). The increase in \nexcise duty and service tax from 10% to 12% as well as the introduction \nof a negative list for the service tax is expected to take revenue growth \nto 23%. However, the actual realization of revenue from asset sales, such \nas disinvestment of publicly owned companies and auction of telecom \nspectrum, which are expected to generate 0.7% of GDP, will crucially \ndepend on market conditions. \n\nThe budget has expenditure rising moderately by 13.1% and subsidies \n\nfalling by 12.2%\u2014fuel\u2019s by 36.3% (Figure\u00a03.17.11). These targets seem \noptimistic, given elevated oil prices and the limited pass-through to \ndomestic retail prices. \n\nStill-high global oil prices and softening external demand will \ncontinue to exert pressure on the current account deficit in FY2012. \nHowever, sluggish investment and industrial activity will help damp \nnon-oil import growth. Moreover, gold imports, which boosted imports \nin FY2011, are expected to be trimmed by a higher tax this year. Overall, \nimports are expected to grow by 15% in FY2012. \n\nModeration of growth in the advanced economies will adversely \nimpact exports as well as receipts on account of software and business \nservices. Export growth is forecast to slip to 14.0% in FY2012. Remittances \nare expected to show strong growth as banks are now free to set rates \nin response to market forces. The current account deficit is forecast to \nimprove marginally to 3.3% of GDP in FY2012. \n\nImproved economic prospects in the advanced economies are \nexpected to boost export growth to 19.0% in FY2013. At the same time, \nan uptick in domestic growth will increase import demand, leading \nto imports growing by 18.0%. Strengthening economic activity in the \nadvanced countries is seen encouraging services exports, leading to the \ncurrent account deficit moderating to 3.0% of GDP in FY2013.\n\nPortfolio investment is expected to be relatively volatile, and be \ninfluenced by the extent of investor risk aversion, global liquidity, and \n\n3.17.9  Industrial outlook survey\n\nOrder books\nProfit margin\nCapacity utilization\n\nEmployment\nBusiness situation\nFinancial situation\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n07\n\nQ1\n2006\n\nQ4\n11\nSource: Reserve Bank of India. http://www.rbi.org.in \n(accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\n3.17.10  Central government budget \nindicators\n\nCentral balance\n\nRevenue\n\n08\n\n11\n\n09\n\n10\n\n2007\n\n12\nForecast\nSource: Ministry of Finance. http://indiabudget.nic.in \n(accessed 18\u00a0March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.17.11  Subsidies\n\nFuel\nFertilizer\nFood\nRs trillion\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\nBudget\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance. http://indiabudget.nic.in \n(accessed 18 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nIndex\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\nExpenditure\n% of GDP\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\nTotal\n% of GDP\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\f170    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nimprovement in domestic fundamentals. FDI is likely to increase only \nmodestly; however, external borrowings are set to remain healthy given \nthe interest rate differential with advanced economies. The current \naccount deficit is expected to be financed by capital flows. \n\nThe above forecasts are subject to a number of risks. The global \nenvironment remains fragile and a worsening of the situation in the \neurozone would have a significant adverse impact. A poor monsoon, \nfiscal slippage, or a continued policy logjam to resolve some of the long-\nstanding issues would also prove detrimental to growth. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014attracting FDI\nIn view of the large investment needs of the economy, especially \ninfrastructure, a reasonable current account deficit is appropriate, \nnotwithstanding India\u2019s high savings rate. The government\u2019s clear \npreference is for the deficit to be financed by equity flows rather than debt \nflows and for FDI over volatile portfolio flows. \n\nFDI has increased in recent\u00a0years from the 1990s\u2019 negligible levels, but \nremains small relative to comparable destinations: according to UNCTAD\u2019s \nWorld Investment Report 2011, in 2010 it came to only $24.6\u00a0billion,\ncompared with $105.7\u00a0billion for the People\u2019s Republic of China, $48.4\u00a0billion\nfor Brazil, and $41.2\u00a0billion for the Russian Federation (Figure\u00a03.17.12).\nA key issue confronting FDI is acquisition of land for economic \nactivity as it involves a number of complex issues. These include use of \nagricultural land for nonagricultural purposes, adequate compensation, \ndisplacement of people\u2014including indigenous tribal populations\u2014and \nthe dichotomy between state and center laws, which in many cases \nhas impeded investment. The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and \nResettlement Bill, introduced in Parliament in 2011, addresses some \nof these issues, although reaching a consensus among the various \nstakeholders is likely to be arduous.\n\nEnvironmental issues such as high ecological costs and concerns \nabout tribal rights have held up some foreign projects. In mining, for \nexample, securing licenses and clearances has become contentious, given \nthat most mineral deposits are in forested areas, home to the country\u2019s \nindigenous tribes. The draft Mining and Minerals Development and \nRegulation Bill is deemed by the industry as taxing it too heavily. \nSimilarly, government initiatives, like guidelines for the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Pollution Index and demarcation of stretches of \necologically sensitive coastline, need to ensure that they do not deter \ninvestment in critical sectors.\n\nCertain elements of labor laws deter investment, and need to be \nrevisited if India is to attract FDI into labor-intensive manufacturing. The \nneed for labor market reforms has been long recognized by policy makers \nbut the issue is highly fraught, lacking the necessary political support for \nchange. Weak infrastructure, especially in the areas of transport, power, \nand education and training, has also reduced India\u2019s attractiveness to FDI. \nFinally, inconsistent policy making can also damp investor confidence by \n\nraising transaction costs and uncertainty about the business environment. \nReducing the number of clearances and introducing single-window nodal \nagencies can help to remove regulatory hurdles and fast-track projects.\n\n3.17.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n-3.3\n\n7.5\n\n6.5\n\n-3.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.17.12  FDI inflows\n\nBrazil\nIndia\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nRussian Federation\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n10\nSource: United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment.

A  devaluation  of  the  local  currency  in \nApril  2011  should  help,  over  the  longer  term,  counter  dollar  shortages,  though  it  has  pushed  inflation \nhigher.  The  resignation  of  the  president  in  February  2012\u2014succeeded  by  the  vice  president,  from  the \nopposition\u2014was  met  with  unrest  and  has  raised  uncertainty  for  the  outlook.  The  impact  on  tourism, \nhowever,  is  expected  to  be  limited. \n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy grew by 7.5% in 2011, supported by continued buoyant \ngrowth in tourism and related sectors such as construction, transport, \nand communications (Figure\u00a03.18.1). Tourism, accounting for about 30% \nof GDP, saw a second year of strong recovery with arrivals up by 17.6% \n(Figure\u00a03.18.2). An influx of visitors from the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China \n(up by 67%) and elsewhere in Asia (up 13%) again drove the expansion, \nwhile growth of European tourists slowed to 6%. Asian visitors now make \nup a third of the market. \n\nFisheries, the main source of employment in the outer atolls, has \nsteadily declined from its peak in 2006. The total catch declined by about \n5% in 2011, although the value of fish exports posted a strong gain on \nincreases in price and volume of sales. The volume of the fish catch is not \nexpected to improve, given the continued decline of fish resources in the \nIndian Ocean.\n\nInflation in 2011 moved to double digits, reflecting a steep rise \nin prices of fish, a staple, and increases in global food and oil prices, \nexacerbated by a 16% devaluation of the local currency against the US \ndollar (Figure\u00a03.18.3). \n\nThe budget deficit improved substantially to 10.2% of GDP (16.1% in \n\n2010). Although further tax reform was delayed, the Tourist General \nService Tax (T-GST) that came into effect during the year helped lift \nrevenue by 38.9%. Growth in expenditure was kept to 12.4% in line with \nthe expansion in nominal GDP, holding expenditure to just over 40% of \nGDP. \n\nBroad money supply (M2) increased by about 20%, driven by the rise \n\nof government claims and expansion of private sector credits.

Preliminary estimates indicate that financing \nfell short of the deficit and gross international reserves went down by \nabout $15\u00a0million to $335\u00a0million.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economic outlook is of course tightly interwoven with developments \nin tourism. The political instability and unrest in the capital Mal\u00e9 and \nother atolls in early 2012, which were widely reported in the foreign \nmedia, caused some cancellations and will likely hold back the growth \nin bookings in 2012. Still, the Maldives has an established reputation as \na high-quality destination and has traditionally strong marketing links \nwith Europe and demand is fast growing among Asia\u2019s increasingly \naffluent middle class. \n\nAssuming no major incidents of unrest in the lead-up to the \npresidential election (the date has yet to be set) tourism should stay \nrobust. With the outlook underpinned by a sizable expansion in \ngovernment expenditure, economic growth is expected to moderate to \n3.5% in 2012 and then pick up to 4.5% in 2013. \n\nThe budget deficit for 2012 is set to ease slightly, but remains heavy at \n9.7% of GDP. Total budget revenue in 2012 is expected to rise substantially \ndespite reduced import tariff rates provided in the 2012 budget. Large \ndeficits have been financed both domestically, mainly by issuance of \nTreasury bills and privatization of state-owned assets over the past several \nyears, and externally by borrowings. But the privatizing approach is \nreaching a limit, and Treasury-bill financing cannot be sustained in the \nlong term. \n\nA more immediate complication for the budget is that already-\n\nprogrammed multilateral financing could be postponed due to the delays \nin completing the program because of unmet performance criteria. The \nGST Act that was approved by Parliament had a lower T-GST rate for 2013 \nand beyond. \n\nOn the expenditure side, the second phase of the redundancy plan of \nfurther downsizing the civil service will be difficult to implement in 2012 \ndue to political conditions. \n\nInflation is expected to moderate in 2012 and then move higher in \n2013 on domestic demand pressures, pacing global commodity prices. \nPressure from the persistently large fiscal deficit remains, though \ntightening of monetary policy will be partly offsetting. \n\nWith likely slower growth in tourist arrivals, earnings are expected to \nmoderate. Slower growth and an expected modest fall in global oil prices \nwill ease the import bill a little, although the current account deficit will \nwiden and as a share of GDP climb to about 38.0% in 2012 and 2013. \n\n3.18.3  Contributions to inflation in Mal\u00e9 \n\nOverall\nFood and nonalcoholic beverages\nHousing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuel\nOthers\n\nPercentage points\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJul Oct Jan\n11\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct Jan\n12\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2012.

Inflation stayed hovering around the double-digit threshold, \nand the banking system came under stress. The outlook is for a modest pickup in growth but with some \nprogress  in  bringing  down  inflation.  Timely  completion  of  the  peace  process,  including  an  agreement  on \na  federal  structure  and  on  a  new  constitution,  would  allow  political  leaders  to  focus  on  spurring  growth \nand  development.\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic growth dipped to 3.5% in FY2011 (ended 15\u00a0July 2011), restrained \nby slower growth in the worker remittances that underpin consumer \nspending, a deep correction in the real estate market, and continued \npolitical uncertainties (Figure\u00a03.19.1). Expansion in services slowed sharply \non hesitant consumer spending and a marked decline in tourism receipts. \nIndustrial growth fell by half, reflecting severe fuel and electricity \nshortages, weak construction, and the closure of several manufacturing \nplants owing to labor\u2013management disputes. Favorable weather allowed \nagricultural output to rebound, but the gain was too little to prevent \noverall GDP growth from slowing.\n\nInflation was high in FY2009\u20132011, broadly mirroring price \ndevelopments in India, with which Nepal has a pegged exchange rate \narrangement and tight trade links (Figure\u00a03.19.2). Escalating food prices \nwere the main driver in the first half of the year and, as these moderated \nin the second half, nonfood prices picked up, partly because of increases \nin fuel prices by the Nepal Oil Corporation, the state-owned monopoly \nsupplier. Prices were adjusted several times (political pressure reversed \ntwo of the increases), but were inadequate to prevent either a buildup of \narrears with the India Oil Corporation or supply disruptions, which led to \nfrequent fuel shortages and transport strikes.\n\nThe budget deficit widened from 1.9% to 2.4% of GDP in FY2011: \ncapital spending picked up, marking the government\u2019s moves to improve \nproject implementation, and revenue fell short of target. Revenue \ncollection as a share of GDP fell for a second year, mainly because of \nsharply weaker growth of customs receipts and value-added tax (VAT) \n(Figure\u00a03.19.3), damped by stagnant non-oil imports and slow growth \nin private consumption (a key source of VAT). The deficit was financed \nmainly by borrowing from banks.\n\nNepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, focused much of its effort in \nFY2011 on managing vulnerabilities in the financial sector.

As market prices of property have fallen heavily, \nthe share of nonperforming loans has increased throughout the financial \nsystem, and several small institutions required emergency assistance. \nBalance-sheet problems at banks coupled with too few attractive lending \nopportunities ensured slow growth in credit to the private sector, \ndespite abundant bank liquidity that pushed the interbank rate down \n(Figure\u00a03.19.4).\n\nWith about half the banking system\u2019s credit collateralized by property, \nthe central bank is encouraging bank consolidation through incentives (it \nhas approved six merger deals and is reviewing another six) and intends \nto use other measures to assist banks through a troublesome period.\n\nThe current account deficit slimmed to 0.9% of GDP in FY2011 after \n\nwidening to 2.7% of GDP a year earlier. Exports, having declined in \nFY2010, grew by 11.7%, thanks to a rebound in the growth of traditional \nexports such as carpets and pashmina (Figure\u00a03.19.5), items that mainly go \nto countries other than India.\n\nApart from the slower worker remittances\u2014possibly affected by the \nunsettled times in the main employment destination of the Middle East\u2014a \nkey hindrance to greater improvement in the current account was the \nhigher oil import bill, as non-oil imports were essentially unchanged from \na year earlier. The Nepal Tourism Year 2011 campaign did attract tourists \nover and above the usual numbers, but as most were budget tourists from \nneighboring countries earnings fell by nearly 10% from a year earlier.\nNet capital inflows more than covered the current deficit and \ngross international reserves increased to $3.5\u00a0billion in December 2011\n(Figure\u00a03.19.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic performance in the forecast period depends primarily on \nhow the political situation evolves. Timely completion of the peace \nprocess, including a draft of the constitution ready by the 31\u00a0May \ndeadline, will help spur growth, but will require an agreement on \nfederal restructuring\u2014one of the main contentious issues in the peace \nprocess. Such closure could allow political leaders to refocus on the \neconomic agenda, paving the way for measures ushering in much-needed \nprivate participation in development, boosting business confidence, and \nimproving labor relations. It would also allow them to pursue policies in \nthe Immediate Action Plan for Economic Development and Prosperity, \nannounced in January 2012.\n\nAssuming that the peace process shows success\u2014and that the \nweather is normal\u2014GDP is projected to grow by 4.5% in FY2012. The \nimprovement from a year earlier will come from faster growth in \nagriculture and services. Strengthening remittances and rebounding \ntourism earnings (foreshadowed in the early months of the fiscal year) \nwill buttress services. Industry is notable by its absence as a growth \ndriver: with no improvement expected in power supply, its performance \nwill remain sluggish.\n\nGDP growth will slow to 4.0% in FY2013, around the speed limit for \n\nan economy inhibited by long-standing structural bottlenecks and policy \n\n3.19.3  Revenue indicators\n\nValue-added tax\nIncome tax\nCustoms\nNontax revenue\n\nNRs billion\n80\n\nTotal revenue growth\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2012.

Agriculture\u2019s expansion \nin FY2011 and FY2012 reflects a recovery (from earlier poor weather) that \nprovided a fillip to growth in the sector and to GDP, but that upturn \nmasks deep-seated problems in raising low productivity and growth to \nthe sector\u2019s higher potential.\n\nInflation gently declined in the first half of FY2012, pointing to an \nannual average of 8.0%. Food inflation is benefiting from better harvests \nas well as mitigated global price pressures. The high base effect of the \nprevious\u00a0year and supportive monetary policies will also keep price rises \ndown. Despite pressures from needed upward revisions in fuel prices, \ninflation is expected to ease to 7.0% in FY2013, broadly in line with India\u2019s.\nOn the monetary side, the central bank will maintain its focus on \nencouraging financial sector consolidation, reforming poorly performing \nbanks, enhancing financial inclusion, and strengthening its own \nsupervisory capacity. Managing commercial banks\u2019 liquidity will remain \ntricky, given the need to strike a balance between containing inflation \nand supporting growth (for the latter, the central bank has directed \ncommercial banks to increase lending to agriculture and energy).\n\nThe trade deficit will widen over the next 2\u00a0years, with faster growth \n\nin imports than exports spurred by sustained high oil prices, and by \na rise in non-oil imports. Yet the current account is projected to move \nto a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in FY2012 and to 1.0% of GDP in FY2013 \nowing to stronger remittances and tourism receipts. Remittances will \naccelerate because of the high number of out-migrants in FY2011 and \nwage increments in destination countries; tourism receipts are on the \nrise, apparently reflecting the delayed impact of the Visit Nepal Year 2011 \ncampaign.\n\nsince the Constituent Assembly elections in 2008, targeted growth in \nrevenue and expenditure of 19% and 25%, respectively, compared with the \nestimated amounts in FY2011 (Figure\u00a03.19.7). Though ambitious, if these \ntargets are met, they would create a domestic borrowing need of about \n2% of GDP\u2014reflecting the government\u2019s continued commitment to fiscal \nprudence.\n\nYet the government still faces an uphill task in fiscal management. \nRecent\u00a0years have seen the budget increasingly stretched by subsidies, in \nparticular to public enterprises. Such payments in FY2012 are put at about \none-fifth of budget expenditure, and rolling them back in a politically \ncharged environment will be hard. Building the physical infrastructure \nand human resources for the envisaged federal structure will also require \nheavy spending.\n\nThe government needs to end such subsidies, and create a fiscal \ncushion, including bringing the informal sector into the formal tax base. \nIn addition, expanding the tax base is necessary to reduce dependence \non foreign aid, which finances about three-fifths of government capital \nspending. Public external debt as a share of GDP has stabilized in \nrecent\u00a0years primarily because the World Bank and ADB (the two largest \ndonors) have been providing a significant share of their contribution \nin the form of grants, but at more than one-third of GDP, it warrants \nprudent debt management.\n\n3.19.6  Gross international reserves\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n  Jul\n\nJan\n  \n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\n \n\nJul\n \n\n \n\nJul \n \n\nDec\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2012.

These distortions\u2014\nseen most clearly in electricity theft and technical leakages (estimated \nat 29% of total output), business cartels, fuel hoarding and frequent \nshortages, and transport syndicates\u2014are responsible for keeping prices \nhigh and for exacerbating the already-poor investment climate.\n\nFuel shortages are a direct result of the slow reform of Nepal Oil \nCorporation. It subsidizes petrol, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum \ngas. The subsidies are partly financed by profits on sales of kerosene and \naviation turbine fuel, which are sold above the international price. The \nprices of subsidized items are being adjusted upward, but there is strong \npolitical pressure to maintain high subsidies. The corporation\u2019s losses \ncame to NRs11\u00a0billion (0.8% of GDP) in FY2011.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to recruit a professional managing director \n\nfor the corporation is a step in the right direction, but wholesale reform, \naccompanied by complete deregulation of oil prices and legal provisions \nto allow private service providers in the market, is needed. (Well-directed \nsocial protection measures would, of course, be required.) Ultimately, the \ncorporation should cover its own operating costs and make a reasonable \nreturn on the government\u2019s invested capital.\n\nThe country reels under severe power shortages, lasting up to 16 hours \n\na day during the winter months of low hydropower generation, because \npotential demand is twice current supply. Fixing this situation to provide \na foundation for exploiting the country\u2019s vast water resources for power \ngeneration will be difficult as it requires huge public expenditure as well \nas public\u2013private partnerships for financing. The first step is to reform \nNepal Electricity Authority, allowing it to set tariffs that would induce \ninvestment and to tackle its arrears and power theft, without undue \npolitical friction.\n\nThe current reform of Agriculture Development Bank, which was \noriginally fully owned by the government, lends credence to the view that \nwell-sequenced reforms of human resources, information technology, \nand commercialization can turn a poorly performing institution into \na financially viable entity without impairing its development mission. \nNepal has 36 public enterprises, and 11 of them incurred heavy losses in \nFY2011. Many\u2014particularly the ones with many employees, such as the \nNepal Water Supply Corporation\u2014have losses greater than their assets, \nreflecting the urgent need for public enterprise reform.\n\n3.19.2  The most problematic factors for \ndoing business (% of responses)\n\nGovernment instability/coups\nInefficient government bureaucracy\n\nPolicy instability\nCorruption\nInadequate supply of infrastructure\nRestrictive labor regulations\nAccess to financing\n\nPoor work ethic in national labor force\nInadequately educated workforce\nInflation\nTax regulations\nCrime and theft\nForeign currency regulations\n\nTax rates\nPoor public health\n\n21.8\n11.8\n\n10.4\n10.0\n8.6\n8.1\n7.7\n\n7.2\n3.4\n3.4\n2.5\n2.3\n1.1\n\n1.1\n0.6\n\nNote: From a list of 15 factors, respondents were \nasked to select the five most problematic factors \nfor doing business in their country and to rank \nthem between 1 (most problematic) and 5.\nSource: World Economic Forum. 2011. The Global \nCompetitiveness Report 2011\u20132012. http://www.\nweforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness\n\n\fPakistan\n\nThe  economy  continues  to  be  affected  by  structural  problems,  including  a  domestic  energy  crisis,  a \nprecipitous  decline  in  investment,  persistently  high  inflation,  and  security  issues.  Budget  deficits  remain \nhigh, driven by substantial subsidies and losses at state-owned enterprises, and tax revenue below target. \nThe slow growth in recent\u00a0years was exacerbated by widespread floods in FY2011. Unless progress can be \nmade  in  resolving  these  fundamental  problems,  the  growth  outlook  will  stay  modest.\n\nEconomic assessment\nSevere floods at the start of FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0June 2011) disrupted \neconomic activity in most sectors in the first half of the year. A slight \nrecovery during the second half\u2014supported by higher prices for key \nexports and expanded services activity in part related to flood relief\u2014\nkept growth positive at 2.4% for the year (Figure\u00a03.20.1). Solid growth in \nlivestock, minor crops, and wheat and sugarcane outweighed a marked \nfall in cotton and rice harvests to allow a 1.2% expansion in agriculture.\n\nIndustry, however, stagnated under the weight of energy shortages and \n\nlow investment. Thus for the fourth year the economy was characterized \nby low growth (a period average of 3%), well below the estimated 7% \nneeded to provide a firm basis to provide jobs to new labor-force entrants, \nincrease per capita income, and reduce poverty.\n\nA surge in workers\u2019 remittances, higher civil service salaries, greater \nfarm income from increases in commodity prices, and higher outlays in \nthe wake of the floods lifted total consumption expenditure by 7%, which \naccounted for more than 90% of GDP growth in FY2011.\n\nInvestment continued to shrink, reflecting structural and security \nissues: gross fixed investment has declined for 4\u00a0years, from about 21% of \nGDP in FY2007 to 11.8% in FY2011 (Figure\u00a03.20.2), the lowest rate since \nFY1974. This trend raises concerns that production capacity is being \neroded, undermining growth prospects for the near and medium term.\nInflation, already under pressure from increasing global commodity \n\nprices, remained high, reflecting flood-related shortages, especially for \nfood, and higher costs due to damaged transport networks. Peaking at \nmore than 15% in December 2010, inflation eased modestly in the second \nhalf, and declined to 13.3% for the year to June 2011.\n\nResponding to price pressures, the central bank tightened monetary \npolicy in FY2011, raising the discount rate by 50\u00a0basis points in each of \nJuly, September, and November 2010, bringing it to 14%. As inflation \nstabilized and the balance of payments strengthened in the second half, \nthe central bank made no further increases in the rate for the rest of \nFY2011.\n\nThis chapter was written by Dawn Elizabeth Rehm and Farzana Noshab of the Pakistan \nResident Mission, ADB, Islamabad.\n\n3.20.1  GDP growth by sector\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\n6.8\n\n3.8\n\nServices\n%\n9\n\n3.7\n\n1.7\n\n2.4\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Credit to the \ngovernment increased by 23.7% and was the main factor in pushing \ngrowth in money supply up to about 16% in FY2011, from 12.5% a year \nearlier, underpinning persistent inflationary pressures.\n\nCredit to the private sector continued to expand slowly (4%), and \nwas largely directed to higher working-capital requirements in the face \nof much higher prices for cotton and textiles, sugar, and edible oils. The \nvast majority of credit to corporate entities and to small and medium-\nsized enterprises apparently went to day-to-day operations rather than \ninvestment.\n\nFiscal imbalances grew in FY2011, as revenue shortfalls and \ncurrent expenditure overruns led to a budget deficit of 6.6% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.20.4), higher than the 4% target announced in the FY2011 \nbudget. While the FY2011 deficit was boosted by outlays of PRs120\u00a0billion \n(0.6% of GDP) to partly clear accumulated debt in the energy sector, the \nbulk of the overrun from the targeted deficit reflected unrealistic revenue \ntargets and underbudgeting for current outlays, particularly for subsidies. \nRevenue rose by 15.9%, well below the 26.2% pace envisaged in the \nbudget, as enactment of planned revenue measures encountered political \nresistance. While flood-related tax surcharges (in force March\u2013June 2011) \nhelped lift receipts that quarter, general government tax revenue for \nFY2011 declined to 9.8% of GDP from 10.1% a year earlier.\n\nCurrent expenditure was reduced from 16.7% of GDP to 16.1%, but \n\nstill outstripped budgeted levels by 15.2%. Development spending\u2014\nincluding flood relief\u2014was held to 30% below target in an effort to \nnarrow the expenditure\u2013revenue gap. Within current expenditure, \nsubsidies surged by 70% from a year earlier, to three times their budgeted \nallocation.\n\nThe balance of payments benefited from a doubling of cotton prices \n\nand higher food sales (mainly surplus wheat) that underlay a 28.9% \nexpansion in exports. Imports grew by 14.9%, largely reflecting price rather \nthan volume increases. Weak investment activity was mirrored in a decline \nin imports of much needed power generation and electrical equipment. \n\nBuoyed by a strong expansion of remittances (up 25.8% to $11.2\u00a0billion),\n\nby flood-related grants, and by inflows from the United States (US) \nCoalition Support Fund, the current account posted a marginal surplus of \n0.1% of GDP. The financial account recorded a surplus of $2.1\u00a0billion.\nForeign exchange assets of the banking system strengthened to \n$18.2\u00a0billion, with reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) peaking\nat $14.8\u00a0billion at end-June 2011. Positive developments in the balance\nof payments helped stabilize the exchange rate against the US dollar: \nthe Pakistan rupee depreciated by 2.0% in FY2011, following a 6.3% \ndepreciation the year before.\n\nPublic debt continued to climb in FY2011 (Figure\u00a03.20.5). Domestic \ndebt jumped by 29.2% to PRs6.0\u00a0trillion (33.3% of GDP). External debt \nincreased to $57.9\u00a0billion but declined as a share of GDP (to 27.5%).\nTreasury debt sales were concentrated in short maturities for most of the \nyear, bringing the average maturity of domestic debt to only 18\u00a0months.\n\n3.20.3  Banking sector credit (yearly flows)\n\nCredit to private sector\nGovernment borrowing\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. 2012.

Evidence \nfrom the FY2011 Household Integrated Economic Survey indicates a \nwidening income gap between rich and poor, with income for the two \nlowest quintiles (40% of the population) growing more slowly than the \naverage. In addition, food inflation has averaged 18% a year for the past \n3\u00a0years (much higher than overall inflation), ensuring that a larger share \nof income, particularly for the lower quintiles, is required to meet this \nessential need. With low investment and economic growth below the pace \nneeded to accommodate the predominately young population, the rich\u2013 \npoor income gap is set to widen further.\n\nEnergy outages and damage to the cotton crop from floods (for the \nsecond consecutive year) in early FY2012 are expected to hold fiscal year \ngrowth to 3.6%. The impact of substantial gas and power load-shedding \nfrom December 2011 and continuing into FY2012 is holding down both \nmanufacturing output and export performance. \n\nMoreover, textile manufacturers report substantial reductions in \norders this year, as unpredictable\u00a0energy outages prevented many of them \nfrom meeting their production commitments last year. Manufacturers\u2019 \nassociations have expressed concerns that energy outages will nullify \nany potential gains from European Union tariff waiver concessions (on \n75\u00a0items, including textiles, approved in February 2012).\n\nWith little relief expected for power shortages and assuming no major \n\nfloods similar to those experienced in the past 2\u00a0years, economic growth \nin FY2013 is forecast to strengthen marginally to 4.0%. Private and \ngovernment consumption expenditure should continue to drive growth, \nas investment remains depressed.\n\nAfter slowing to 9.7% in December 2011, inflation (year on year) \npicked up to 11% in February 2012 (Figure\u00a03.20.6). Core inflation remains \nnear double digits, pointing to continued persistence of inflationary \npressures. Increases in energy prices in March 2012 and further expected \nadjustments will keep upward pressure on prices. For FY2012 as a whole, \naverage inflation is projected at 12.0%. On assumptions of a strengthened \nbudget performance and broad stability in oil and other global \ncommodity prices, inflation could ease to 10.0% in FY2013.\n\nSlower inflation and measures by the government to contain \nborrowing from the SBP supported an easing of monetary policy. In \ntwo separate steps (July and October 2011), the central bank reduced the \npolicy rate by 200 basis points to 12%. With a weakening overall balance \nof payments, however, and a decline in reserves, the SBP has kept the \nrate at 12%.\n\nFiscal developments for FY2012 present a mixed picture. Federal \nBoard of Revenue collections are much improved, running a full 33% \nahead of last year\u2019s performance for the first 6\u00a0months (Figure\u00a03.20.7). This \nreflects improved economic activity in the first half of the year, as well \nas extension of the flood-related tax surcharges and improvements to tax \nadministration. Yet it is unclear that the overall revenue target for FY2012 \nwill be achieved, as this in part depends on the sale of third-generation \ntelecoms licenses in the latter part of FY2012\u2014a sale already rescheduled \nover the past 2\u00a0years.\n\n3.20.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n3.6\n\n12.0\n\n-1.8\n\n4.0\n\n10.0\n\n-1.9\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.20.6  Inflation and policy rate\n\nFood\nCore\n\nOverall inflation\nPolicy rate\n\n%\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\nOct\n\nJul\n2010\n\nJan\n11\n\nApr\n\nJul \n\nOct\n\nJan\n12\n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

Taken together, \nuncertainties over nontax revenue and higher than targeted current \nexpenditure point to a budget deficit in excess of the 4.7% of GDP target.\n\nThe external accounts are increasingly fragile, as the current \naccount returns to deficit (Figure\u00a03.20.8), with scant cushion from the \nfinancial and capital accounts. Lower prices for key export commodities, \nparticularly cotton, combined with higher import prices, pushed the \ncurrent account from near balance for the first 7\u00a0months of FY2011 to \na deficit of $2.6\u00a0billion (1.8% of GDP) by end-January 2012. The deficit\nis expected to remain unchanged as a share of GDP over the rest of \nFY2012\u2014as strong growth in remittances continues to offset a widening \ntrade balance\u2014increasing slightly to 1.9% in FY2013.\n\nGrowth in export receipts slowed to 7.2% for the first 7\u00a0months of \nFY2012 from 20.1% for the same period the previous year, as cotton prices \ndeclined and export industries were hit by increased load-shedding. \nImports were 17.7% higher, largely reflecting substantial payments for oil. \nThe services account showed similar signs of deterioration, with services \nexports contracting by 22.0% as inflows from the US Coalition Support \nFund declined.\n\nWorkers\u2019 remittances expanded by 23.4% during July\u00a02011\u2013February \n\n2012, slightly slower than the pace for the same period a year earlier.\n\nOfficial foreign exchange reserves declined by $2.4\u00a0billion in the first\n7\u00a0months of FY2012 (Figure\u00a03.20.9), reflecting the current account deficit \nand a sharp narrowing of the capital and financial account surplus as \ninflows continued to fall and debt service payments mount. Reacting to \npressure on reserves, the Pakistan rupee depreciated by 5.7% against the \nUS dollar in the first 8\u00a0months (Figure\u00a03.20.10).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014efficiency constraints\nPower is the main constraint for economic growth, as load-shedding \nintensifies and becomes less predictable (Box\u00a03.20.1). Estimates from the \nPlanning Commission suggest that losses arising from power and gas \nshortages held down GDP growth by 3\u20134 percentage points in FY2011 \nand FY2012. Improved management of power resources could ameliorate \npredictability of load-shedding to allow the private sector to better \nschedule work and minimize costs.\n\nThe current system, with tariff and collections below cost recovery, \nis a major deterrent to investment for capacity expansion in the sector. \nCost recovery has not yet been achieved despite substantial increases in \ntariffs over the past 2 years, and measures to bring down costs have not \nbeen effective. For every unit of power sold, there is a loss to the sector \nreflected in the form of subsidies or accumulation of losses in the state-\nowned power companies. An outstanding accumulation of PRs220\u00a0billion \nwas carried into FY2012, and an additional financing of 1\u20131.5% of GDP is \nlikely to be required in FY2012. Implementation of many of the actions \ntaken by the government has been complicated by legal challenges. \n\n3.20.8  Current account components\n\nTrade balance\nIncome \nServices\nCurrent transfers\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$ million\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n2007 08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nJul\u2212\nJan \nFY11\n\nJul\u2212\nJan \nFY12\n\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

The supply-demand gap at peak \nhours reached over 5,000 megawatts (MW) in FY2011 \n(Box\u00a0figure\u00a01).

National Electric Power \nRegulatory Authority (NEPRA). State of Industry Report 2011.\nClick here for figure data\n\nThe cause of the power sector crisis can be divided into \nthree pillars: cost-efficient generation capacity not keeping \nup with demand, financial issues, and management issues. \nThe supply\u2013demand gap has widened because of a \nlack of investment in energy. The government has in fact \nadded 1,604\u00a0MW to the system by commissioning six new \nindependent power producers (1,264 MW) and a nuclear \npower plant (340 MW). A 49.5\u00a0MW wind power plant has \nrecently obtained financing. \n\nHowever, other domestic resources (hydro, gas, and \ncoal) have not grown enough to cover demand, thereby \nincreasing reliance on imported fuel oil. The energy mix \nhas changed from predominantly hydro to thermal, which \nconsists of domestic gas and imported fuel oil. \n\nIndustrial, retail, and fertilizer users are competing for \n\nthe depleting gas supply, the preferred fuel for existing \nthermal plants. Plans to increase domestic gas production, \nimport liquefied natural gas, pipe gas from neighboring \ncountries, or bring in electricity from Central Asia have \nyet to materialize.\n\nRegulatory Authority is not applied to customers. Thus \nthe government bears the differential as a subsidy. Losses \nand costs excluded from the tariff formula also accumulate \nat the public sector company level. The lack of financing \nleads to arrears for the power generation and fuel \ncompanies. \n\nTimely payment to these companies, essential for the \nsector\u2019s reliability, has become increasingly difficult, partly \nbecause of increased dependence on imported fuel, which \nis subject to wide price fluctuations. The cost of (oil-based) \npower generation in the country escalated by almost 40% \nin the 2 fiscal years ending FY2011. Despite steep increases \nin tariff and fuel price adjustments, customer tariffs remain \nbelow cost recovery, requiring large government subsidies \nto keep the system operating (Box\u00a0figure\u00a02). \n\nThe focus on massively increasing spending on power \nsubsidies, reforms, and efficiency measures has been unable \nto remedy the accumulation of arrears in the system. \n\n2  Power subsidies\n\nPRs billion\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nTarget\n\nActual\n\nTarget\n\nActual\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nTarget\n2012\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance.

Efforts \nare also ongoing to decrease commercial and technical \nlosses (around 20%). However, these efforts have been \novershadowed by the increase in costs and unwillingness \nof some customers to pay the higher tariffs. \n\nFor a sustainable and reliable power sector, a multiyear \n\nFinancial issues are rooted in the fact that the cost-\nrecovery tariff determined by the National Electric Power \n\nplan with solid support from customers and other \nstakeholders needs to be implemented.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nGrowth  stayed  high  in  2011  despite  bad  weather,  which  affected  agriculture.  A  policy  to  keep  the \nexchange  rate  stable  in  the  face  of  credit-fueled  strong  domestic  demand  led  to  a  growing  trade  deficit \nand  loss  of  official  reserves,  while  nonfood  prices  trended  sharply  higher.  The  authorities  in  response \nadopted in February 2012 more flexible exchange rate and monetary-tightening policies, and made steep \npower  and  fuel  price  adjustments.  The  outlook  is  for  moderate  but  still  strong  growth. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew at 8.3% in 2011 as the country continued to absorb \nthe benefits of the end of its long-running civil conflict in May 2009 \n(Figure\u00a03.21.1). Industrial output (accounting for a little less than one-third \nof GDP) expanded by 9.6%. Within that, manufacturing grew by 8.1%, led \nby the export-oriented readymade garment industry. Construction and \nmining came in at double-digit growth, reflecting projects started since \nthe conflict ended.\n\nServices, the largest component of GDP (three-fifths), climbed by \n8.8%. Hotel and restaurant activity was up by one-third, reflecting a \n30.8% increase in tourist arrivals. Both transport and communications \ngrew with the further integration of the northern and eastern provinces \n(former conflict areas) with the rest of the economy.\n\nAgricultural output, however, was hit by adverse weather and heavy \nflooding in early 2011 and was down in the first half, but it picked up in \nthe second to show annual growth of 2.5%.\n\nPrivate consumption remained the main driver of economic \n\nexpansion, fueled by remittances, greater demand from the northern and \neastern provinces, and salary increases for civil servants and the defense \nforces. Investment activity also strengthened owing to implementation \nof major infrastructure development initiatives (especially in transport, \nenergy, water, sanitation, and irrigation) and rising business investment, \nincluding international companies seeking a foothold in a fast-expanding \neconomy. Private investment focused on tourism, telecommunications, \nmanufacturing, and housing.\n\nOverall inflation remained in single digits in 2011, averaging 6.7% and \n\nlittle changed from a year earlier (Figure\u00a03.21.2). Food inflation, though, \nwas volatile, reflecting flood damage, crop failures, and price pressure \nearly in the year and, later, declining prices as production recovered. \nNonfood inflation trended upward, due to strong demand and price \nincreases for diesel, petrol, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, and bus \nfares late in 2011 and in February 2012, when it reached 9.2%. Fuel prices \nwere suppressed during 2011 as international oil prices shot up by 41% \n\nThis chapter was written by Tadateru Hayashi, Nimali Hasitha Wickremasinghe, and \nSavindi Jayakody of the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n3.21.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture \n\nIndustry \n\nServices \nPercentage points\n\n8.0\n\n8.3\n\n6.8\n\n6.0\n\n3.5\n\n08\n\n10\n\n09\n\n2007\n\n11\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The government kept rises in petrol and diesel \nprices to 19% and 15%, respectively. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation lost \na reported SLRs90\u00a0billion in 2011 (1.4% of GDP), mainly by selling oil to \nCeylon Electricity Board below cost.\n\nThe central bank kept monetary policy rates low in 2011 to boost \neconomic growth through rapidly expanding credit. Growth in credit to \nthe private sector has accelerated rapidly since early 2010, fueling the pace \nof economic activity: year-on-year growth reached 34% in midyear and \nthen plateaued (Figure\u00a03.21.3). Construction, agriculture, and wholesale \nand retail trade have been prominent recipients. The central bank aimed \nat maintaining inflation at mid-single-digit level and signaled a tightening \nof policy by raising its repurchase and reverse repurchase rate by 50\u00a0basis \npoints to 7.5% and 9.0%, respectively, in February 2012.\n\nThe budget deficit was narrowed in 2011 through a reduction of \nexpenditure as a share of GDP, even as the proportion of government \nrevenue in GDP fell. The deficit is estimated at 7.0% of GDP, improving \nfrom 2010\u2019s 8.0% (Figure\u00a03.21.4). Total revenue increased by 12.3% in 2011 \nfrom a year earlier (tax receipts rose by 14.2%). Revenue as a share of GDP, \nhowever, fell by 0.5\u00a0percentage points to 14.3% in 2011, despite a 16.6% rise \nin nominal GDP and strong imports. The weaker performance seems \nlargely due to tax holidays and incentives eroding the tax base. Total \nexpenditure, which rose by 9.1%, moderated to 21.4% of GDP from 22.9% \nin 2010, reflecting government efforts to rationalize recurrent spending. \nCapital expenditure was maintained at 6.0% of GDP.\n\nWhile exports expanded strongly, imports jumped because of higher \noil prices and strong domestic demand, more than doubling the current \naccount deficit to 7.3% of GDP in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.21.5). Export earnings \nrose by about 22.4% to $10.5\u00a0billion, mainly owing to a 24.6% expansion\nin garment sales, a near 60% surge in rubber and rubber products, and \nstrong prices for other agricultural products. Imports jumped by 50.4% to \n$20.2\u00a0billion, driven mainly by increases in imports of oil, intermediate\ngoods for the garment industry and other raw materials, and capital \ngoods. Export growth was weaker in the second half of 2011 than the first, \nwhile that of imports stayed high.\n\nImproved workers\u2019 remittances and an increased surplus in the \nservices account helped contain the current account deficit. Earnings \nfrom tourism shot up by 44% to $830\u00a0million, even though tourist\narrivals, especially from Europe, slowed during the second half. Workers\u2019 \nremittances, up by 25.0%, remained the single largest foreign exchange \nearner, at $5.1\u00a0billion or 8.7% of GDP.\n\nForeign direct investment inflows exceeded the government target of \n$1\u00a0billion in 2011 as there was an influx of investments into the tourism,\napparel, and information technology industries. Net inflows to the capital \nand financial accounts largely offset the current account deficit.\n\nThe central bank defended the foreign exchange rate (in a band \n\naround SLRs110/$1) against downward pressure from the current\naccount deficit for most of 2011, although the government announced \na 3% devaluation when presenting the 2012 budget in November 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.21.6). With strong demand pressures, gross official reserves \nfell continuously during the latter part of the year to $5.96\u00a0billion by\nend-December 2011, covering 3.5\u00a0months of imports (Figure\u00a03.21.7). \n\n3.21.3  Growth of private sector credit\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n12\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. http://www.cbsl.lk \n(accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\n3.21.4  Fiscal indicators\n\nFiscal balance\nRevenue including grants\nExpenditure\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nBudget\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

By end-March the rate \nreached SLRs129.6/$1, a 14% depreciation year on year.\n\nEconomic prospects\nAlthough the economy is projected to maintain its strong performance of \nthe last 2\u00a0years, growth prospects for 2012 are less favorable than in the \npast, and the pace of expansion will moderate. This easing is partly due \nto slower growth in industrial countries and attendant weaker growth \nin global demand and trade, and partly due to domestic factors: the \nrebound has largely run its course and with little slack in production \ncapacity signs of overheating have emerged that will require tighter \ndemand-management policies to forestall the buildup of serious economic \nimbalances.\n\nGrowth is expected to edge down to a still high 7.0% in 2012 as trends \n\nin investment, exports, tourism, remittances, and consumption remain \nbroadly favorable; agriculture growth should be high, assuming normal \nweather. With the expected stronger performance of the global economy \nin 2013, growth is expected to recover to 8.0%, driven mainly by domestic \nand foreign investment.\n\nFiscal policy will focus on further narrowing the budget deficit in \n2012 to 6.2% of GDP. The budget plans most of this improvement to come \nfrom an 19.8% increase in revenue and grants, based on assumptions of \nrapid growth (8.5\u20139%) and inflation in mid-single digits. But with growth \nlikely to be slower than this rate, it will be hard to reach the revenue \ntarget. Expenditure is slated to rise more slowly than revenue: planned \neconomies in current spending should allow capital outlays to rise to 6.6% \nof GDP, in line with the target in the government\u2019s Development Policy \nFramework. The government plans to bring the deficit down to 5.8% in \n2013, by improving income tax and value-added tax collection and further \nstreamlining current expenditure.\n\nThe public debt ratio has been reduced over the last few\u00a0years, \n\nalthough it was still very high at an estimated 78.9% of GDP at \nend-November 2011 (Figure\u00a03.21.8). The impact of currency depreciation \non external debt, additional budget borrowing, and slower growth is on \ncourse to worsen the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2012.\n\nMonetary policy will focus on stabilizing inflation in mid-single digits \n\nand eliminating balance-of-payments pressures and loss of reserves. In \nmoving toward this objective the central bank raised policy rates in early \nFebruary 2012 and directed commercial banks to limit credit expansion to \n18% during the year, alongside the moves to liberalize the exchange rate.\nWhile the expected global slowdown and stable\u00a0commodity prices in \n2012 should curb external inflationary pressure, diesel and petrol prices \nwere raised by 37% and 9%, respectively, and a surcharge (25\u201340%) was \nimposed on household electricity bills, all in February 2012. However, \ncurrency depreciation will also raise inflation through higher import \nprices. Inflation is forecast to be 8.0% in 2012 and fall marginally to 7.0% \nin 2013 owing to easing pressures from exchange rate depreciation and \nenergy price adjustments a year earlier.\n\n3.21.6  Exchange rate\n\nSLRs/$\n\n109\n\n115\n\n121\n\n127\n\n133\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n2009\n\nMar\n12\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. http://www.cbsl.lk \n(accessed 26 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n11\n\n \n\n3.21.7  Gross official reserves \n\nLevel\n\n$ billion\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Still, the trade gap is projected \nto stabilize, as import growth will also be much slower as higher interest \nrates, tighter credit, and a marked depreciation in the exchange rate \nare felt, especially for consumer goods. The current account deficit is \nprojected to edge down to 6.4% of GDP in 2012, reflecting the more \nstable trade gap and continued large gains in remittance receipts. \nGrowth in tourism-related inflows will take a hit but the sector will stay \na major earner.\n\nWith stronger industrial-country growth and a pickup in trade in \n\n2013, stronger export growth is projected to help narrow the current \naccount deficit to 6.0% of GDP.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014boosting private investment\nThe government\u2019s Development Policy Framework for 2010\u20132016 aims \nto raise GDP growth to above 8% in the medium term and to nearly \ndouble per capita income from $2,400 to $4,200 at the end of the\nperiod. The government has therefore embarked on an ambitious plan to \nremove infrastructure bottlenecks. It has already undertaken significant \ninvestments in some sectors, especially among the major infrastructure \ndevelopment initiatives.\n\nThe government, as seen in the framework, would like to see a \ngreater role for the private sector through increased investment by both \ndomestic and foreign investors, as investment is key for increasing supply \ncapacity and bolstering growth. The framework also seeks private investor \nparticipation (beyond the traditional areas of industry and commerce) in \ninfrastructure. The framework projects private investment to rise from \naround 21% of GDP in 2011 to about 26\u201328% in the next few\u00a0years.\n\nYet despite the improved political and economic environment, growth \n\nin private investment\u2014domestic and foreign\u2014is falling below planned \nlevels. One reason is that the government has taken only a few steps to \nreduce red tape and improve the business climate, needed to create the \nconditions for ramping up private investment. Although Sri Lanka\u2019s \nposition in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business survey has improved in 2012 \nto 89 (out of 183 countries) from 98 in 2011, some challenges still deter \nprivate investment (Figure\u00a03.21.9), especially paying taxes.\n\nInvestor confidence is a key factor in attracting investment and this \nrequires a predictable\u00a0policy environment as articulated and reinforced \nthrough the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework. Thus the \nlack of such an environment for the private sector is a major obstacle \nto private sector development. Developing that framework will reduce \nuncertainties in the business environment and avoid unplanned actions \nthat may send mixed signals to potential investors.\n\n3.21.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n-6.4\n\n8.0\n\n7.0\n\n-6.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.21.9  How Sri Lanka ranks on Doing \nBusiness indicators\n\nGetting \nelectricity \n(95) \n\nStarting a\nbusiness (38) \n\nDealing with \nconstruction \npermits (111) \n\n1\n\n51\n\n101\n\n151\n\nResolving \ninsolvency \n(42) \n\nEnforcing \ncontracts \n(136) \n\nRegistering \nproperty \n(161) \n\nGetting \ncredit (78)\n\nTrading across \nborders (53) \n\nPaying taxes (173)\n\nProtecting \ninvestors (46) \n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses show ranking out of 183 \ncountries worldwide, 1 = best.\nSource: The World Bank.

The  pace  of  inflation  lifted  last  year,  but  will  likely  ease  in  2012.  Substantial \nfiscal  and  current  account  surpluses  provide  a  cushion  against  shocks.  Diversifying  sources  of  growth  is \nthe  main  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew by an estimated 2.9% in 2011, quickening from a \nrevised 2.6% in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.22.1). Growth stemmed from production \nand exports of natural gas and crude oil, which account for two-thirds of \nGDP, and a better performance by the nonenergy sector.\n\nThe oil and gas sector expanded by 2.2% in the first 3\u00a0quarters of the \nyear, mainly owing to a 5.1% increase in production of liquefied natural \ngas (LNG). A large methanol plant, opened in May 2010, made its first \nfull-year contribution to growth in 2011.\n\nThe nonenergy sector grew by 2.8% in the 3\u00a0quarters. It comprises\u2014\nmainly government\u2014services, and small agriculture and manufacturing \noutput. Government services (about one quarter of the economy) grew by \n3.3% in the 3\u00a0quarters. Strong growth of about 20% was recorded in air \ntransport and hotels and restaurants services. Manufacture of garments \ndeclined for a fourth consecutive year.\n\nGovernment price controls and subsidies keep inflation to the 1\u20132% \n\nrange most\u00a0years\u2014a bracket again achieved for the full year (2.0% on \naverage). Higher global prices for food and other consumer goods nudged \nup inflation to 2.8% year on year in October 2011, before it receded \n(Figure\u00a03.22.2). Tobacco prices jumped after the government raised excise \nduties on tobacco in November 2010.\n\nHelping to contain inflation, the Brunei dollar appreciated against the \nUS dollar by 8.4% on average last year, a result of its peg to the Singapore \ndollar through a currency board arrangement.\n\nMerchandise exports, mostly LNG and oil, rose by an estimated \n32.5% to US$12.4\u00a0billion in 2011, propelled by higher global prices for\nhydrocarbons. According to import data from Japan and the Republic \nof Korea, the biggest LNG customers, in 2011 these countries together \nlifted their purchases from Brunei Darussalam of LNG by 39% (to \nUS$5.6\u00a0billion) and of oil by 33% (to US$1.9\u00a0billion).\n\nMerchandise imports are much lower than exports, reflecting the \n\nsmall economy (GDP of about US$17\u00a0billion in 2011) and population\n(423,000). Imports rose by an estimated 19.3% to US$2.8\u00a0billion.

Rising oil prices \nboosted revenue by 43% in FY2010 (ended 31\u00a0March 2011). Government \nspending fell slightly owing to a decline in capital outlays, leaving a fiscal \nsurplus equivalent to about 16% of GDP.\n\nThe government established the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam \n\nin January 2011 to supervise the financial sector and manage monetary \naffairs. It also set up a Deposit Protection Corporation to insure deposits \nup to B$50,000 for individual depositors. A centralized credit bureau is\nbeing formed to help banks assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\nConcerned about rising household debt and banks\u2019 high exposure to \nconsumer loans, the authorities required banks to curb consumer lending \nand they tightened limits on credit card debt. The ratio of consumer loans \nto total credit fell sharply to 39% as at September 2011. Lending to the \nprivate sector fell by 5.3% during the first 7\u00a0months of 2011. \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is expected to maintain modest growth during the forecast \nperiod (Figure\u00a03.22.1 above), based on solid demand and prices of oil, \ninvestment in oil exploration, high levels of government spending, and \ngradual development of the nonenergy sector.\n\nTwo large export-oriented projects linked to hydrocarbons received \n\ngovernment approval in 2011\u2014a US$2.8\u00a0billion natural gas\u2013based\npetrochemical complex and a US$2.5\u00a0billion oil refinery and aromatics\ncracker. (The country has only one small oil refinery.)\n\nThe complex, to be built at the Sungai Liang industrial park by \nJapanese companies, could eventually involve six downstream plants to \nproduce chemicals for fertilizers, textiles, and plastics. The refinery and \ncracker project is planned by a firm from the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the Pulau Muara Besar industrial zone. If it proceeds as proposed, it \nwill have capacity of 135,000 barrels of oil a day and produce petroleum \nproducts and chemicals for textiles. \n\nCurrent infrastructure activity includes completing the Pulau Muara \nBesar port and updating the Brunei international air terminal to double \nits capacity to 3\u00a0million passengers a year.\n\nInflation is projected to ease slightly to average 1.8% in 2012 as prices \n\nof imported food soften. It will edge up in 2013. Large current account \nsurpluses are likely to be sustained, mainly on exports of oil and gas, and \non income flows from the country\u2019s overseas investments.\n\n3.22.1  Policy challenge\u2014\ndiversifying growth\n\nHeavy reliance on oil and gas leaves \nthe economy vulnerable to swings \nin global hydrocarbon prices. It also \nexposes it to dwindling production, \nunless exploration companies find new \noil and gas fields. Oil output declined \nfrom a peak of 219,000 barrels a day in \n2006 to 170,000 barrels in 2010.\n\nMoreover, the oil and gas sector \nemploys only about 3% of the work \nforce. The government provides jobs to \nthe majority of those in work, but says \nit can no longer absorb the growing \nnumber seeking employment.\n\nA government drive to attract \npetrochemicals and other energy-\nrelated industries is having some \nsuccess. Port facilities and an export \nprocessing zone are being built to \nattract manufacturers. The authorities \nhave identified Islamic businesses \nincluding halal products, financial, \nlogistics, and telecommunications \nservices, and tourism for development, \nand have allocated funding for public\u2013\nprivate partnerships.\n\nTo redress weaknesses in the \n\nbusiness environment, the government \nplans to further cut the corporate \nincome tax rate to 20% (it was 30% in \n2006), to tax income from exports of \ndomestically produced goods at just \n1%, to lower excise duties for some \nmachinery used in industry, and to set \nup a Business Facilitation Center.\nIt might also want to consider \n\nopening more areas for private \nparticipation and better align public\u2013\nprivate remuneration packages so that \nprivate business can attract skilled \nworkers.\n\n\fCambodia\n\nDespite  the  worst  floods  in  over  a  decade,  economic  growth  remained  robust  in  2011,  underpinned  by \nexports  of  garments  and  footwear  and  by  tourism.  This  year  growth  is  forecast  to  soften,  before  picking \nup  in  2013.  Average  inflation,  lifted  by  higher  prices  for  food  and  fuel  in  2011,  is  projected  to  moderate \nthis  year.  Better  public  debt  strategies  led  to  an  upgrade  in  the  debt  sustainability  rating. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth picked up to an estimated 6.8% in 2011, largely on increased \nexports of garments, footwear, and milled rice, as well as rising numbers \nof inbound tourists.\n\nIndustry remained the primary source of growth, expanding by an \nestimated 13.9% (Figure\u00a03.23.1) and driven mainly by robust export growth \nof garments and footwear to the United States (US) and the European \nUnion (EU). US garment and footwear imports from Cambodia in 2011 \nclimbed by 17.8% to $2.7\u00a0billion (Figure\u00a03.23.2). Exports of garments and\nfootwear to the EU surged by 51.1% to $1.62\u00a0billion, largely due to relaxed\nrules of origin for imports into the EU that gave Cambodia (and some \nother developing countries) duty-free access to that market from January \n2011.\n\nThe number of jobs in the garment industry gradually recovered from \n\na little over 319,000 at end-2010 to an estimated 330,000 by end-2011. \nAlthough this was still below the 353,000 jobs at end-2007\u2014before the \nglobal recession\u2014industry sources estimate that there were also more \nthan 50,000 vacancies.\n\nThe strong growth of the industry sector was also supported by \na steady increase in milled rice exports. A doubling in the value of \napproved construction projects in 2011 suggests a welcome recovery in \nthis subsector.\n\nAgriculture, representing about a third of GDP, was disrupted in \nSeptember and October by the most severe flooding in more than a \ndecade. Damage and economic losses, mainly to infrastructure and \nagriculture, were estimated at $624\u00a0million, some 5% of GDP. The floods\nlowered wet-season rice production, though output in the dry season \nincreased, and fisheries production rose by 4.5%. Agricultural growth \noverall expanded by an estimated 3.3%.\n\nA buoyant tourism industry supported growth of 5.0% in services. \nTourist arrivals picked up by 14.8% to 2.9\u00a0million in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.23.3), \nwith arrivals from Asia particularly strong. Growth in tourism benefited \nthe hotels and restaurants, retailing, and transport and communications \nsubsectors. Greater public confidence in the financial sector underpinned \ncontinued expansion there. \n\nThis chapter was written by Peter Brimble and Poullang Doung of the Cambodia \nResident Mission, ADB, Phnom Penh.\n\n%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n$ million\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n0\n\n3.23.1  GDP growth\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: National Institute of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.23.2  Exports of garments and footwear to \nthe European Union and United States \n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nNotes: Using import data from US OTEXA and Eurostat. \nData from Eurostat were converted to US dollars using \u20ac/$ \naverage exchange rate for the year.

Inflation \nthen began to ease (Figure\u00a03.23.4), although the floods put some upward \npressure on rice prices. For the year, inflation averaged 5.5%, up from \n4.0% in 2010.\n\nReflecting the economic pickup, credit to the private sector \n\naccelerated from 27% at end-2010 to 31.7% a year later. More than 95% was \ndenominated in foreign currency, mostly US dollars. Broad money (M2, \nexcluding foreign currency outside banks) increased by 21.5% year on \nyear at end-2011, driven by growing foreign currency deposits as a result \nof increased export earnings. The riel appreciated by 2.9% against the US \ndollar during 2011.\n\nAn expansionary fiscal stance since 2009 has considerably reduced \nthe government\u2019s deposits in the banking system from about 8% of GDP \nin 2008 to around 4% in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.23.5). The overall fiscal deficit \n(excluding grants and other expenditure adjustments), though staying \nhigh, narrowed to an estimated 7.6% of GDP in 2011 from 8.1% in 2010. \nMost of the gap (6.5\u00a0percentage points of GDP) was financed by external \ngrants and concessional loans, the rest by drawdowns of government \ndeposits.\n\nDomestic revenue, estimated at 12.7% of GDP, fell short of target. \nProperty tax, introduced in July 2010, started to generate income in 2011, \nmaking a small contribution. General government spending was above \ntarget at 20.2% of GDP.\n\nConcessional assistance from the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(mainly for infrastructure) as well as private investment (especially in \nhydropower) played a greater role in financing infrastructure last year \nthan in 2010.\n\nIn the external accounts, the rise in shipments of garments, footwear, \nand milled rice propelled merchandise exports 35.8% higher in US dollar \nterms in 2011. Imports increased by an estimated 25.9%, largely reflecting \npurchases of oil, raw materials for garments, and consumer goods. The \ncurrent account deficit (excluding official transfers), at an estimated \n7.1% of GDP, was covered by inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) \nand official loans. Net FDI rose by an estimated 11% to $846.2\u00a0million,\nwith a sharp increase for the garment industry. Gross official reserves of \n$3.0\u00a0billion represented about 4.5\u00a0months of imports (Figure\u00a03.23.6).\nA debt sustainability analysis published in February 2012 by the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank upgraded Cambodia \nfrom moderate risk of debt distress to low risk. External public debt at \nend-2011 was manageable at 29% of GDP; domestic debt was less than \n1% of GDP. In recent years, the People\u2019s Republic of China has become \nan important creditor, accounting for about two-thirds of total bilateral \ndisbursements in 2010, for example.\n\nThe Ministry of Economy and Finance estimated that poverty \nincidence declined to 25% as of early 2012, from about 30% in 2007, \nalthough there are concerns over apparent increases in income inequality. \nThe government adopted a national social protection strategy in 2011, \nforeshadowing both an expansion of targeted programs such as free \nhealth care for the poor and the pilot testing of conditional cash transfers \nand labor-intensive public works.\n\nReceipts  \n\n$ billion\n2\n\nArrivals\n\nMillion persons\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n07\n\n2006\n\n08\nSource: Ministry of Tourism. \nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n3.23.4  Monthly inflation\n\nFood\n\nOverall\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n11\nSource: National Institute of Statistics. http://www.nis.gov.\nkh (accessed 21 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n12\n\nOct\n\n3.23.5  Government deposits\n\n% of GDP\n8\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.23.6  Gross international reserves\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n\nLevel\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.\nClick here for figure data\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia    191\n\nGrowth in services is expected to edge up to 5.3% in 2012 and 5.6% \n\n3.23.7  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\nEconomic prospects\nExport-led sectors will remain the main sources of growth during the \nforecast period, with some new manufacturing industries beginning to \nemerge, such as automotive parts and assembly of small electric motors. \nThe subdued economic outlook for the EU and US, Cambodia\u2019s main \nexport markets, suggests that GDP growth will edge down to 6.5% in 2012 \n(Figure\u00a03.23.7). In 2013, growth is seen picking up to 7.0%, tracking the \nexpected upturn in the global outlook.\n\nDemand for garment and footwear imports in the EU and US is \nexpected to slow this year, mitigated to some extent by Cambodia\u2019s \nprivileged import access to the EU and the development of some high \nvalue-added garment production. Given these trends, the growth in \nindustry overall is projected to slow to 11.4%, before picking up to 12.5% \nin 2013.\n\nConstruction is expected to strengthen, stimulated by FDI in \n\nproperty. The extent and timing of exploitation of oil and gas reserves in \nCambodia remain unclear, but it is not anticipated to have an impact on \nGDP before 2015.\n\nin 2013 largely on the back of continued increases in tourist arrivals \nsupported by gradual improvement in real estate.\n\nAssuming favorable weather, agriculture is forecast to register higher \n\ngrowth of 3.8% in 2012, partly a result of the base effect of last year\u2019s \nfloods on the rice crop. It also reflects government support for agriculture, \nin particular rice production.\n\nFiscal consolidation is expected to continue, as envisaged in the \n2012 budget. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants and other expenditure \nadjustments) is targeted at 5.7% of GDP, to be achieved largely by \nan ambitious domestic revenue target of 13.7% of GDP. Government \nspending is budgeted at 19.4% of GDP. The budget anticipates that \ndomestic financing of the deficit will be as low as 0.2% of GDP. This \nindicates an important step toward rebuilding fiscal flexibility, necessary \nto give the government the leeway to spur the economy if needed. \n\nAbout $150\u00a0million will be spent on flood reconstruction over the\nnext 2 or 3\u00a0years, building on an estimated $60 million of flood-related\nhumanitarian and infrastructure spending in 2011.\n\nInflation in 2012 and 2013 is forecast to ease to about 5% on a year-\naverage basis (Figure\u00a03.23.8), assuming relatively low domestic financing \nof the budget deficit. (High levels of domestic financing would involve \nthe injection of large amounts of riels that could put upward pressure on \ninflation.) Rising global oil prices early in 2012 put the inflation forecast \nfor this year at risk.\n\nThe trade deficit in 2012 is set to widen slightly due to softening \nexternal demand. Increases in tourism receipts will keep the services \naccount in surplus. The current account deficit (excluding official \ntransfers) is projected to widen to 7.6% of GDP in 2012 before narrowing a \nlittle as the global economy picks up (Figure\u00a03.23.9). \n\nAs for policy reforms, the Public Debt Strategy approved by the \nPrime Minister in February 2012 is a step forward in strengthening the \ndebt strategy and debt management capacity.

Yet despite the positive debt sustainability assessment, \nthe country remains vulnerable to uncertain contingent liabilities on \nmajor infrastructure investments, mainly public\u2013private hydropower \npartnerships.\n\nA Public Procurement Law, promulgated in January, laid the \n\nfoundation for improving this element of public financial management. \nAn overhaul is planned of policies and regulations covering public\u2013\nprivate partnerships, which should help mobilize private sector finance \nfor development projects and improve business governance and \ntransparency. Three state-owned enterprises are scheduled to be the first \nlistings on the securities exchange.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014skills shortages\nSkills shortages are hindering Cambodia\u2019s development. The share of \nfirms reporting skills as a major constraint to growth in the World Bank\u2019s \nInvestment Climate Surveys increased from 6.5% in 2003 to 15.5% in 2007. \nIn a survey of 78 employers by a consulting firm in 2011, 73% said that \nuniversity graduates do not have suitable skills and 62% said the same \nabout vocational training graduates. About one-third of the employers \nsurveyed found it difficult to train or upgrade their workforce. The \nsituation has worsened over the past few years as wage rates have risen, \npushing manufacturers up the value-added chain and requiring higher \nlevels of skills.\n\nImprovements in early childhood nutrition and better primary and \n\nlower secondary schooling would provide children with a firmer base \non which to build their educational and skills training. After that, what \nis required is a concerted approach to improving human capital, with \nall stakeholders involved\u2014businesses, the government, development \npartners, and civil society.\n\nOn the supply side, the challenge is to strengthen training programs, \n\nbuilding in responsiveness and flexibility to labor market needs. This \ncalls for expansion both of formal programs that are more relevant to \nindustry and of nonformal training that can help those with incomplete \neducation enter the job market. The overall response should aim to \nmanage resources in ways that create incentives for good performance \nand accountability for results, teach soft and technical skills, and bring \nschools and industry closer together to promote quality and relevance to \nmarket demand.\n\nOn the demand side, the focus should be on improving information \n\nflows and strengthening institutional capacity, particularly in the \nNational Training Board and Employment Agency. Employers lack \nchannels both to communicate their demands for specific skills and to \ninfluence skills development policies. \n\n\fIndonesia\n\nSoutheast  Asia\u2019s  biggest  economy  in  2011  grew  at  its  fastest  rate  since  before  the  1997\u20131998  Asian \nfinancial  crisis.  The  pace  will  likely  ease  in  2012  on  weaker  external  demand,  before  accelerating  again  in \n2013 on the expected recovery in trade. Inflation, which receded in 2011, is forecast to quicken when the \ngovernment  raises  administered  fuel  prices.  The  external  current  account  is  projected  to  slip  into  deficit \nthis  year  as  exports  soften  while  robust  investment  keeps  capital-equipment  imports  high.  Addressing  a \nmajor  challenge  to  development,  the  government  is  stepping  up  efforts  to  improve  infrastructure.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth of 6.5% in 2011, the highest in 15\u00a0years, was based on sustained \nprivate consumption, stronger investment, and expansion of net exports \n(Figure\u00a03.24.1).\n\nPrivate consumption grew by 4.7%, contributing 2.7\u00a0percentage points \nof total growth. It was driven by rising incomes and employment and by \neasing inflation. In a notably positive development, fixed investment grew \nby 8.8% and contributed 2.1\u00a0percentage points of GDP growth. Public \ninvestment was constrained by weakness in implementing capital works, \nalthough private investment in construction and machinery was robust, \nsupported by increases in foreign direct investment (FDI) and in bank \nlending. The ratio of nominal fixed capital investment to GDP rose to \n32.0% in 2011, up by 7.1\u00a0percentage points over 5\u00a0years (Figure\u00a03.24.2). Net \nexports contributed 1.5\u00a0percentage points of growth.\n\nFrom the supply side, economic growth was led by services and \nmanufacturing. Services grew by 8.5% to account for more than half the \ntotal GDP increase. Retail and wholesale trading, as well as transport and \ncommunications, showed double-digit expansions, while financial services \nbenefited from a stronger performance in banking.\n\nManufacturing registered its best performance in 7\u00a0years: expanding \n\nby 6.2% and contributing 1.6\u00a0percentage points of overall growth, this \noutturn was based on the country\u2019s large and growing domestic market, \nalongside a better performance from exports. Subsectors to report \nsignificant production gains in 2011 included iron and basic steel, food \nprocessing, textiles and footwear, and transport equipment (Figure\u00a03.24.3). \nBy contrast, mining and quarrying recorded weak growth of 1.4%, \nreflecting\u00a0years of underinvestment and production problems in crude oil \nand natural gas.\n\nAgricultural output rose by a modest 3.0%. An increase in production \nof estate crops, such as palm oil and rubber, was partly offset by a decline \nin food crops. Paddy rice output fell by 1.6% during the year, owing to dry \nweather in the second half. \n\nThis chapter was written by Edimon Ginting and Priasto Aji of the Indonesia Resident \nMission, ADB, Jakarta.\n\n3.24.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\nInvestment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.3\n\n6.0\n\n4.6\n\n6.2\n\n6.5\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.24.2  Fixed investment\n\n% of GDP\n35\n\n04\n\n05\n\n03\n\n02\n\n2001\n\n06\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n07\n\n09\n\n08\n\n10\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\f194    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nAbout 1.5\u00a0million new jobs were generated in 2011, easily exceeding \n\nthe number of new entrants to the labor force (843,000). The quality \nof employment also improved: in the 12\u00a0months through August 2011 \nformal employment climbed by 16.0%, or 5.7\u00a0million positions. Most \njobs were in construction, manufacturing, and services. Employment \nin the informal sector fell by 5.9%, or 4.2\u00a0million, as workers left the \nagricultural labor force. But 62% of the employed labor force (about \n68.2\u00a0million people) still work in the informal sector, where wages and \njob security are low.\n\nPoverty incidence fell to 12.4% in September 2011, from 13.3% in March \n\n2010. (It was 17.6% just before the Asian financial crisis.)\n\nInflation slowed from 7.0% year on year at the start of 2011 to 3.8% at \n\nyear-end as food price rises moderated (Figure\u00a03.24.4). A good harvest \nin the first half was followed by government moves to suspend import \nduties on some food items and to improve food distribution. Year-average \ninflation was 5.4%, up slightly from 2010.\n\nBank Indonesia raised its policy interest rate in February 2011 by \n25\u00a0basis points to 6.75% to damp inflation expectations. During October \n2011\u2013February 2012, after inflation trended down and the global economic \noutlook dimmed, the central bank lowered this rate by 100\u00a0basis points. \nBroad money (M2) growth accelerated to 16.4% and commercial banks\u2019 \ncredit expanded by 24.6% in 2011, slightly above Bank Indonesia\u2019s target \nof 23%. Credit for investment jumped by 33.2%, reflecting the improving \neconomic conditions and declining interest rates.\n\nMerchandise exports rose by 27.5% to $201.5\u00a0billion in 2011\n\n(Figure\u00a03.24.5), although the pace eased in the fourth quarter. Exports of \nhydrocarbons rose by nearly 34%\u2014declining oil exports were more than \noffset by rapid expansion in gas exports, reflecting rising gas prices and \noutput. Non-oil and gas exports increased by 26.1%, with large gains for \ncoal, palm oil, and rubber. In the other direction, strong demand for raw \nmaterials, machinery, and consumption goods pushed up merchandise \nimports by 30.3% to $166.1\u00a0billion.\n\nDespite the larger trade surplus (which rose because of a higher \nexport base), the surplus on the current account fell to the equivalent \nof 0.2% of GDP. That was attributable\u00a0to a smaller surplus in transfers \n(remittances from workers abroad declined) and wider deficits in \nservices (higher outlays on freight and business services) and in the \nincome balance (a result of repatriation of investment income by foreign \ncompanies).\n\nThe capital and financial account turned into deficit in the second \n\nhalf, owing to portfolio capital outflows caused by global financial \nmarket anxieties. Net portfolio investment of $4.2\u00a0billion in 2011 was\ndown sharply from 2010 (Figure\u00a03.24.6). FDI inflows, though, shot up by \n31.9% to a record $18.2\u00a0billion, reflecting improvements in the domestic\ninvestment environment. The overall balance of payments maintained \na healthy surplus and gross international reserves rose to $110.1\u00a0billion,\nequal to 6.4\u00a0months of imports and government debt payments \ncombined.\n\nIn the first 8\u00a0months of 2011, the rupiah appreciated by about 5% \n\nagainst the US dollar, but it turned weaker when global economic \nconcerns heightened, ending the year little changed.\n\n3.24.3  Growth of selected manufacturing \nsubsectors\n\nTotal manufacturing \nFood processing\nTextiles and footwear\nCement and nonmetallic minerals\nIron and basic steel\nTransport equipment\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 1 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n3.24.4  Inflation and policy rate\n\nPolicy rate\n\nOverall\n\nFood\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n11\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 13 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nFeb\n12\n\nOct\n\n \n\n3.24.5  Current account indicators\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n3\n\n%\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.24.6  Financial account indicators\n\nFDI inflows\n\nNet portfolio investment\n\n$ billion\n20\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 12 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nIndonesia    195\n\nA strengthening bond market saw the yield on 5-year rupiah \ngovernment bonds fall by 139\u00a0basis points to 5.4% during 2011. The \ngovernment stepped in to stabilize the market by buying bonds when \nforeign investors cut their holdings in August\u2013November\u2019s market \nturbulence. Over the year, the stock market edged up 3.2%.\n\nThe government aimed for a budget deficit equal to 2.1% of GDP, but \n\nthe outcome was around half that, at 1.1%. One reason was that public \ncapital spending fell short of target because of chronic weakness in \nimplementing capital projects. Another was buoyant revenue: tax receipts \nincreased to 11.8% of GDP (from 11.2% in 2010) owing to a widening tax \nnet, improving tax administration, strong economic activity, and high \ncommodity prices.\n\nSubsidies for fuel and electricity, however, remained a heavy burden \n\non the budget, at 3.4% of GDP, and their cost exceeded the amount \ninvested in public capital works. Still, the ratio of national government \ndebt to GDP fell to 24.3% in 2011, maintaining a declining trend \n(Figure\u00a03.24.7). \n\nReflecting the country\u2019s improved macroeconomic performance, two \nmajor rating agencies raised Indonesia\u2019s sovereign ratings to investment \ngrade: Fitch to BBB minus in December 2011 and Moody\u2019s to Baa3 in \nJanuary 2012.\n\nEconomic prospects\nForecasts assume the government will maintain its efforts to improve \nboth the investment climate and public financial management, especially \nfor budget execution. The forecasts also assume that the authorities \nwill pursue major policies outlined in the master plan for economic \ndevelopment 2011\u20132025 (known by its Indonesian acronym MP3EI), \npublished last year. The plan calls for raising public investment in \ninfrastructure, reducing bottlenecks, and closing the development gap \nbetween eastern and western regions of the country.\n\nPrivate consumption is forecast to remain strong this year and next. \nSurveys of households conducted by Bank Indonesia show high consumer \nconfidence (Figure\u00a03.24.8), driven mainly by optimism about growth in \njobs and incomes. Consumption is underpinned by an expanding middle \nclass (those with incomes of $2\u201320 a day in 2005 purchasing power parity\nterms, a group increasing by about 7 million a year) and rising labor force \nparticipation.\n\nPrivate investment is expected to maintain its upward trend, \ngiven the country\u2019s solid record of economic growth over recent\u00a0years \n(averaging 5.7% since 2004), upgrades in sovereign ratings, and an \nimproved investment environment. Indonesia\u2019s ranking as an investment \ndestination rose two places to seventh in the 2011 World Investment \nReport by the United Nations Commission of Trade and Development. A \nBank Indonesia Business Survey conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011 \nindicated a steady rise in planned business activity and investment in the \nfirst half of 2012, and the Business Tendency Survey conducted in that \nquarter by the statistics office also suggested optimism over the near-term \noutlook (Figure\u00a03.24.8). \n\n3.24.7  Fiscal indicators\n\nDebt ratio\n\n% of GDP\n50\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n2\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n-50\n\n2005\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: Directorate General of Debt Management. http://\nwww.dmo.or.id; Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Finance. \nhttp://www.fiskal.depkeu.go.id (both accessed 13 March \n2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.24.8  Business and consumer confidence \nindexes\n\nBusiness tendencya\nConsumer tendencyb\nConsumer confidencec\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n \n\nQ1\n2010\n\nQ1\n11\n\na\u00a0From a quarterly Statistics Indonesia survey among \nbusiness executives. b\u00a0From a quarterly Statistics Indonesia \nsurvey among middle- and upper-income households. \nc\u00a0From a monthly Bank Indonesia survey among \nhouseholds.\nNote: A score above 100 means that respondents are \noptimistic and vice versa.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 13 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.24.9  Average lending rates of commercial \nbanks\n\n% per year\n\nInvestment\n\nWorking capital\n\nJan\n2010\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n11\n\nJan\n12\n\nNote: Refers to rupiah credit.\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 13 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nIndex\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n14\n\n13\n\n12\n\n11\n\n\f196    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nThe fiscal stance will be accommodative to mitigate the impact on \neconomic growth of the global slowdown. In late March 2012, Parliament \npassed a revision to the 2012 budget, widening the fiscal deficit to 2.2% of \nGDP from an originally planned 1.5%. The revised budget contains three \nkey components: a provision to increase administered domestic fuel prices \nif the average Indonesian crude oil price exceeds $120.80 over a 6-month\nperiod; an additional $2.8\u00a0billion of social spending if fuel prices are\nraised; and a further $1.9\u00a0billion in capital spending. Public infrastructure\ninvestment is expected to surge by 48.6% in 2012 from that spent in 2011. \nA budget deficit recorded in January 2012, unlike recent years\u2019 surpluses \nfor this month, indicates improved budget execution.\n\nInvestment in infrastructure by the private sector and state-owned \n\nfirms could start to increase, as outlined in the MP3EI. A Land Law \nfor Public Use (approved by Parliament in December 2011) should help \nin acquiring land for public infrastructure, easing a serious constraint. \nDomestic commercial banks, which have excess liquidity, have expressed \ninterest in financing infrastructure development, and the sovereign \ninvestment-grade ratings are expected to facilitate a greater volume of \nlong-term financing.\n\nLending interest rates have come down (Figure\u00a03.24.9, above) since \n\nBank Indonesia lowered its policy rate. Credit to the private sector \nis projected to grow by at least 25% this year, financing increases in \ninvestment and consumption.\n\nManufacturing output looks set to increase further during the forecast \nperiod, based on announcements by companies of planned new facilities. \nThe expansion has spread to industries such as metal products and \nmachinery, which are more export oriented than transport, storage, and \ncommunications, sectors that previously attracted most investment. This \ndiversification of manufactured products contributed to the solid increase \nin output last year (Figure\u00a03.24.10).\n\nExports, though, face headwinds this year as global trade slows. GDP \n\ngrowth is therefore forecast to ease to 6.4%, before stepping up in 2013 \n(Figure\u00a03.24.11) when world trade and economic growth pick up and \ninfrastructure investment gathers momentum.\n\nInflation during the forecast period depends in part on the timing \n\nand size of increases in fuel prices. The year-average rate for 2012 is \nprojected at 5.5% (Figure\u00a03.24.12), on the assumption that fuel prices will \nbe lifted later this year. If fuel prices are increased later than anticipated, \ninflation would likely be lower than forecast this year and higher than \nprojected in 2013. \n\nSlower growth in exports will likely produce a small current account \n\ndeficit in 2012. Merchandise exports are projected to increase by about \n13.5% and imports by 18.5% (strong investment will spur imports of capital \nequipment). The income deficit will widen, consistent with strengthening \nFDI flows and related repatriation of corporate earnings. In 2013, the \ncurrent account is seen returning to a small surplus as external demand \nrecovers (Figure\u00a03.24.13).\n\nInflows of foreign direct and portfolio investment are expected to \nkeep the overall balance of payments in surplus through the forecast \nperiod.

A sharper deterioration than \nanticipated in major export markets would translate into even lower \nexport growth. Further, Indonesia is vulnerable to financial-market \nvolatility because of its relatively open capital account and heavy foreign \npresence in its stock and bond markets (about two-thirds of equities and \none-third of sovereign bonds are foreign held). \n\nThe government\u2019s gross financing needs remain high, despite its low \n\nbudget deficit and declining debt-to-GDP ratio. The share of financing \nfrom market sources is expected to increase to about 85% this year, from \n60% in 2009, in line with official policies to develop the capital market. \nThis suggests the financing of the budget could be disrupted in the event \nof large capital outflows.\n\nAnticipating such risks, the government included provisions in its \n2012 budget that enable it, in an economic emergency, to get approval \nfrom Parliament within 24\u00a0hours, to raise spending above the budgeted \nlevel, and to switch spending priorities. That is in addition to the \nadditional capital and social spending added to the budget in March \nthat should provide a buffer to weaker external demand. Contingency \nplans also include the bond stabilization program that provides for the \ngovernment to tap funds from its current budget, accumulated budget \nsurpluses, and state-owned enterprises to steady a volatile market.\n\nMoreover, the central bank has upgraded macroprudential measures \nto reduce short-term and speculative capital inflows and mitigate the risks \nof sudden outflows. These include gradually replacing short-term Bank \nIndonesia certificates with government bonds for liquidity management, \nreinstating limits on short-term offshore borrowing by banks to a \nmaximum of 30% of their capital, increasing banks\u2019 foreign currency \nreserve requirements, and requiring an underlying economic exchange for \nany foreign currency transaction above $100,000.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening infrastructure\nLagging development of infrastructure\u2014transport and \ntelecommunications networks, electricity, and water supply\u2014is a \nprime constraint on economic growth. The quality of infrastructure is \nranked below that of, for example, Malaysia and Thailand (Table\u00a03.24.2). \nIndonesia\u2019s logistics costs (including transportation, warehousing, and \ndistribution) are about 14% of total production costs, much higher than \nJapan\u2019s roughly 5%.\n\nThe government has made infrastructure development a key priority \n\nin both its Medium-Term Development Plan 2010\u20132014 and the longer-\nterm MP3EI. Several transport projects financed through the budget are \nscheduled to get under way this year, including expansion of Jakarta\u2019s \nmain airport, construction of highways and ports, and the building of \ntransport infrastructure in eastern provinces.\n\nIndeed, budget allocations for infrastructure have increased \n\nsignificantly since 2010, but the execution of capital projects has lagged \n(Figure\u00a03.24.14) because of capacity and other constraints.

Inflation,  after  speeding  up  last  year, \nis  projected  to  moderate.  The  country  signed  agreements  that  bring  it  closer  to  joining  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.  However,  generating  well-paying  jobs  remains  a  major  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance\nDespite severe flooding that damaged agriculture in 2011, the economy \ngrew by 7.8% (Figure\u00a03.25.1), mainly owing to expansion of hydropower, \nmanufacturing, mining, and services.\n\nTyphoons in the second half of the year brought floods that took \ndown rice output by 11% to about 2.9\u00a0million tons. Production of corn, \nbeans, and vegetables also fell, although sugarcane, fisheries, and \npoultry performed better than in 2010. Output of timber declined as \nthe government curbed illegal logging and restricted logging quotas. \nAgriculture as a whole, which accounts for just under one third of GDP, \nwas virtually flat in 2011.\n\nBy contrast, industry expanded by 15.6%. Production of copper \nfrom the country\u2019s two biggest mines\u2014Phu\u00a0Bia and Sepon\u2014rose by \nabout 5% to 139,000\u00a0tons. Silver production also gained, by about \n6% to 538,000\u00a0ounces, though output of gold fell by about 22% to \n128,000\u00a0ounces.\n\nHydropower output rose by 18.5% in 2011, spurred by new plants \ncoming online, including the 615\u00a0megawatt Nam Ngum\u00a02 in April 2011, \nand by heavy rainfall during parts of the year. Most of the electricity \ngenerated is exported to Thailand. Investment in mining and power \nplants contributed to growth: several mines, including the Ban Houayxai \ngold and silver mine as well as eight\u00a0hydropower plants and a lignite \npower plant were being built. Other construction focused on housing; \ncommercial buildings; and hotels in Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and \nSavannakhet. Construction overall increased by about 6%.\n\nGarment manufacturing benefited from the European Union\u2019s \nrelaxation, from January 2011, of rules of origin for imports of garments \nfrom certain developing countries, including the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (the Lao PDR) (Figure\u00a03.25.2). Garment exports to the European \nUnion and the United States, the two main markets, rose by about 17% to \n$225.6\u00a0million.\n\nThe services sector grew by 7.9% last year.

Rising global oil prices drove up \ndomestic fuel costs, and the disruption to supplies of food during the \nfloods pushed up prices of food. Higher inflation in neighboring countries \nthat supply consumer goods\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nThailand, and Viet Nam\u2014added to pressure on prices.\n\nGrowth in credit moderated from very high rates in recent\u00a0years \nto a still high 34.2% in December 2011 (Figure\u00a03.25.5). The deceleration \nstemmed from reduced direct lending by the central bank for \ninfrastructure projects and steps the bank took to curb lending for real \nestate speculation. A shortage of longer-term bank deposits constrained \ncommercial bank lending to the private sector.\n\nThe central bank also maintained its policy of keeping the kip \nbroadly stable\u00a0against the US dollar and Thai baht. During 2011 the kip \nappreciated by 2.7% against the US dollar and by 1.6% against the baht. \nDollarization has gradually declined from 79% in 1999 to about 45% last \nyear.\n\nStrong flows of revenue to the government from mining and \n\nhydropower, coupled with reduced off-budget spending, brought down the \noverall fiscal deficit to about 2.0% of GDP in FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0September \n2011) from 5% the previous year. A value-added tax introduced in 2010 \nsupported growth in total revenue, which is estimated to have reached the \nequivalent of 19.4% of GDP (including grants). Government spending is \nestimated at 21.4%.\n\nMerchandise exports, mainly minerals, hydropower, garments, and \nwood products, rose by an estimated 24.0% to $2.7\u00a0billion in 2011. Imports\nincreased by 19.4% to $4.3\u00a0billion, bolstered by purchases of capital\nequipment for the resource industries and two Airbus aircraft for Lao \nAirlines. After dividend and profit repatriation and interest payments by \nresource-based companies, the current account deficit was estimated at \n15.9% of GDP. \n\nAccounting for foreign direct investment and other capital flows, \ngross international reserves fell to $679\u00a0million in 2011, sufficient for about\n2.5\u00a0months of nonresource imports.\n\nThe Lao PDR has moved closer to joining the World Trade \n\nOrganization, after reaching bilateral agreements with major trading \npartners. (It has sought membership in that body since 1997 to foster \ntrade and investment.) Under the market access agreement signed last \nyear with Australia, for example, the government agreed to an average \nceiling on import tariffs of about 25%, and as low as 5% on some goods. It \ncommitted to allow market access for suppliers of a range of services and \nto allow majority foreign ownership of joint ventures. \n\nIn another market-opening development, the government sold \nstakes of about 30% in two state-owned companies\u2014power company \nEDL-Generation Co. and Banque Pour Le Commerce Exterieur Lao\u2014\nthrough initial public share offerings, and listed the shares on the new \nLao Securities Exchange last year.

Construction is gathering momentum on the $3.7\u00a0billion Hongsa\nlignite thermal power plant (1,878 megawatts) and associated coal mine. \nWork will get under way this year on Nam Ngum 3 (440\u00a0megawatts), \njoining eight other hydro plants under construction. Expansion of Theun \nHinboun (280 megawatts) is due to be completed in July 2012.\n\nThe Ban Houayxai mine is scheduled to start production in the first \n\nhalf of 2012, at a full-year rate of 100,000 ounces of gold and 700,000 \nounces of silver, and the Phu Kham copper\u2013gold project, one of the \nbiggest in the country, is being expanded. A potash mine and processing \nplant costing $94\u00a0million is expected to be completed this year and a\ncompany from Viet Nam has started work on a larger potash project \n(costing $450\u00a0million) to be completed by 2015. Most fertilizer from these\npotash plants will be exported.\n\nIn the capital Vientiane, the government is investing more than \n$180\u00a0million on building facilities for the 2012 Asia\u2013Europe meeting of\nsenior officials from 50 countries to be held in November 2012. The PRC is \nproviding loans for conference facilities and airport expansion.\n\nTourism will get a lift from international promotion of 2012 as \nVisit Laos Year and from the ASEAN University Games to be held in \nDecember 2012. Lao Airlines has launched flights between Vientiane and \nSingapore after acquiring the Airbus planes in late 2011.\n\nRice production is expected to recover from last year\u2019s flood-\n\nsuppressed level. Agricultural output is seen increasing by 2\u20133% in 2012, \ndepending on the weather. The government is repairing irrigation systems \ndamaged by the floods and building new irrigation systems to support \ndry-season crops.\n\nFiscal policy is more expansionary in FY2012, and the fiscal deficit \n\nis projected to widen to 4.6% of GDP. The government has budgeted \nto increase spending considerably, in part to repair the flood-damaged \ninfrastructure. The central bank is targeting 25% growth in M2 money \nsupply and aims to curtail expansion of credit to 28% (such targets have \nbeen missed in recent\u00a0years, though).\n\nInflation is forecast to moderate to average 6.7% this year and 6.0% in \n2013. Lower global food prices and a better domestic harvest will ease the \npressures on food, which has a large share in the consumer price index. \nThere will be some upward impact on prices from an increase of about \n18% in administered electricity tariffs in the first half of 2012.\n\nSluggish global economic growth is expected to weigh on prices of \ncopper, holding back merchandise export growth to about 19% in 2012. \nImports of capital equipment needed for new mining and power projects \nwill underpin an increase of about 17% in merchandise imports. The \ncurrent account deficit is forecast to widen to 21.0% of GDP.\n\nExternal public debt rose to an estimated $3.7\u00a0billion dollars in\n2011, although as a ratio to GDP it fell to about 47%. An external-debt \nsustainability analysis by the International Monetary Fund in 2011 found \nthat the country still faces a high risk of debt distress, and that the \nprojected rate of debt accumulation could increase in the next few\u00a0years, \nreflecting borrowings mainly from the PRC.\n\n3.9.1  Policy challenge\u2014generating \nmore jobs\n\nPoverty incidence declined from 46% \nof the population in 1993 to a still \nhigh 27% in 2008. Consequently, \nmajor development goals are to sustain \ngrowth of income and employment, \nand better distribute income and \nwealth.\n\nCentral to these tasks is raising \n\nproductivity and incomes in agriculture, \nwhich employs about three-fifths of \nthe workforce. Rural areas are home to \nthe majority of the poor. As improved \nproductivity reduces the number \nof workers in agriculture, however, \nindustry and services must grow if the \nsurplus workers are to find jobs.\n\nInvestment in recent years has \nfocused on mining and hydropower. \nThey have indeed driven much of the \ngrowth, but, being capital intensive, \nhave not generated enough jobs to take \nin all the workers leaving agriculture.\nIndustries that could create many \n\nwell-paid jobs include:\n\nAgribusiness. Processing crops like \n\nrice, corn, and natural rubber adds \nvalue and is labor intensive. As links \nstrengthen between the Lao PDR and \nits neighbors Cambodia, the PRC, \nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet\u00a0Nam, \nmarket access for agribusiness \nproduction will expand.\n\nTourism. This group of countries \n\nalso offers a cluster of tourism \ndestinations that could be developed \nand promoted to achieve faster growth. \nServices associated with tourism, such \nas hotels, have a strong employment \nresponse to growth in output.\n\nServices. It is efficient to cluster \ndevelopment of services in towns and \ncities to capture economies of scale and \nagglomeration. Moves in this direction \nrequire the government to address \nissues including inadequate urban \nplanning and provision of water and \nsewerage systems.\n\nMore broadly, development of \nthese and other industries depends \non bringing down the high cost of \nfinance, expanding education and \nskills training, building transport \ninfrastructure, and addressing \nweaknesses in governance.\n\n\fMalaysia\n\nStrong  private  consumption  drove  economic  growth  in  2011,  supported  by  government  spending  and,  less \nso,  by  fixed  investment.  The  weaker  global  environment  is  forecast  to  slow  growth  in  this  highly  open \neconomy  in  2012,  but  the  better  global  backdrop  next  year  should  help  lift  its  performance.  Moderating \ngrowth  this  year  suggests  that  inflation  will  also  ease.  The  external  current  account  surplus  will  remain \nbuoyant.\n\nEconomic performance\nExpansion of 5.1% in 2011 was fueled mainly by private and government \nconsumption on the demand side and by an expansion of the services \nsector on the production side. Slower global trade and growth weighed on \nexports and manufacturing.\n\nPrivate consumption rose by 6.9%, accelerating from 2010 and \n\ncontributing about two-thirds of total GDP growth in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.26.1). \nThis reflected a robust labor market (employment increased by 3.2% \nand unemployment fell to an 11-year low of 3.1%), favorable prices for \nagricultural commodities (supporting farm incomes), and availability of \ncredit (household borrowing rose by 12.5%). Government consumption, \ntoo, made a significant contribution to growth. It surged by 16.8% as the \ngovernment raised outlays on supplies and services, increased public \nservice wages, and paid a 1-month bonus.\n\nFixed capital investment growth moderated to 6.0% in 2011. While \n\nprivate investment was strong for much of the year, government \ninvestment fell, reflecting the phasing out in 2010 of a fiscal stimulus \npackage. Gross fixed capital investment as a ratio to GDP was flat at \naround 20%, well below levels seen in the mid-1990s (Figure\u00a03.26.2). This \nreflects, in large part, rising costs of production and limited progress in \nattracting higher valued-added industries.\n\nImports of goods and services in real terms rose faster than exports, \n\nholding back GDP growth from the demand perspective.\n\nIn supply-side terms, services contributed the vast bulk of growth, \nexpanding by 6.8%. The robust private consumption drove a solid gain \nin retail and wholesale trading. Finance and insurance services benefited \nfrom strength in bank lending and insurance sales, and real estate \nservices from an upturn in the housing market. \n\nManufacturing grew by only 4.5% as demand weakened in major \nindustrial countries for manufactured products, particularly electronics. \nSupply disruptions caused by the March earthquake and tsunami in \nJapan and second-half floods in Thailand also dented manufacturing \noutput (Figure\u00a03.26.3). The electronics and electrical subsector contracted \nby 2.4% last year. \n\nThis chapter was written by Gary Krishnan of the Southeast Asia Department, ADB, \nManila.\n\n3.26.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nGDP\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\n\n6.5\n\n4.8\n\n-1.6\n\nTotal investment\nNet exports\nPercentage points\n15\n\n7.2\n\n5.1\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: Department of Statistics Malaysia. http://statistics.\ngov.my; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 16 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n10\n\n11\n\n3.26.2  Fixed investment\n\n% of GDP\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n98\n\n92\n\n94\n\n96\n\n1990\n2000\n10\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n06\n\n04\n\n08\n\n02\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMalaysia    203\n\nConstruction increased by a modest 3.5%, reflecting the end of the fiscal \n\nstimulus in 2010. The mining subsector (mainly oil), contracted by 5.7%, a \nresult of maintenance shutdowns and output declines in mature fields.\nThe performance of agriculture\u20145.6% growth\u2014was the strongest \nin 8\u00a0years. This was largely based on a sharp increase in crude palm oil \nproduction, which accounts for about one-third of the sector. Palm oil \noutput rose by 11.3% to 18.9\u00a0million tons owing to good weather and firm \ninternational prices.\n\nHigher food costs and increases in administered prices of electricity, \n\nfuel, and sugar nudged up inflation to 3.5% year on year in June \n(Figure\u00a03.26.4). On a year-average basis, it accelerated to a 3-year high of \n3.2%. House prices also turned up, by 8.6% in the first 3\u00a0quarters, a pace \nmore than double the average of 2000\u20132010.\n\nTo lean against inflation, Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, \nraised its policy interest rate in May 2011 by 25\u00a0basis points to 3.0%. It also \nlifted the reserve requirement for banks from 1.0% to 4.0% to drain excess \nliquidity from the banking system.\n\nThe government boosted public expenditure by about 13% in 2011 (it \nhad declined slightly in the prior year). Revenue rose by 15%, propelled by \nthe surge in oil prices, so that the federal budget deficit narrowed slightly \nto 5.3% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.26.5). The ratio of federal government debt to \nGDP edged higher to 53.5%. \n\nGrowth in M2 money supply rose by 14.6% year on year in December \n2011, double the rate of the prior-year month. Credit to the private sector \naccelerated to 12.2% in 2011.\n\nThe external position remained strong. Merchandise exports climbed \n\nby 14.5% to US$227.5\u00a0billion, largely a result of higher prices for export\ncommodities. The value of palm oil shipments jumped by 32.6% and that \nof minerals (mainly oil) by just over 22%. By contrast, the weakness in \nglobal demand for electronics and electrical products, alongside supply \ndisruptions, took down their exports by 5.4%. After a 13.9% increase in \nimports to US$178.7\u00a0billion, the trade surplus rose to US$48.8\u00a0billion\n(Figure\u00a03.26.6). The current account surplus as a share of GDP remained \nlarge at 11.5%.\n\nIn the capital and financial accounts, net portfolio investment of \nUS$9.9\u00a0billion in 2011 was lower than in 2010 owing to global investor\nrisk aversion caused by the eurozone and the United States fiscal and debt \nconcerns in the second half of the year. Inward direct investment rose \nby nearly 19% to US$10.8\u00a0billion, exceeded by outward direct investment\nthat rose by 11% to US$14.8\u00a0billion. Other investment outflows moderated\nand the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of US$31.0\u00a0billion.\nThat lifted international reserves to $138.4\u00a0billion at end-2011, sufficient\nto finance about 8\u00a0months of retained imports and 4.1\u00a0times short-term \nexternal debt. The ringgit depreciated against the US dollar by about 3% \nduring the year.\n\nConcerned about high levels of household debt (equivalent to 76.6% \nof GDP in 2011), the central bank moved to damp speculation in housing \nand to tighten credit card issuance. For housing loans, it imposed a 70% \nloan-to-value ratio on individual borrowers with more than two housing \nloans, and ruled that housing loan approvals be based on net rather than \ngross household income.

That comes on top of a RM50 annual tax\non credit cards.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGiven the country\u2019s close integration with the world economy\u2014exports \nand imports of goods and services are equivalent to over 100% of GDP\u2014\nweakness in the global outlook clouds Malaysia\u2019s prospects in 2012. \nGrowth is seen moderating to about 4.0%, then quickening in 2013 as the \nexternal environment improves (Figure\u00a03.26.7).\n\nDomestic demand will again anchor growth. Private consumption \nwill get support from government decisions in the 2012 budget to raise \nwages for the public sector and to make a one-time cash payment to low- \nand middle-income groups (53% of all households). Government plans to \nintroduce a minimum wage in 2012 are expected to lift incomes for the \nlow paid.\n\nStill, the labor market is likely to soften, particularly in trade-exposed \nindustries. Job vacancies in January 2012 declined steeply from the prior-\nyear period. Consumer sentiment weakened late in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.26.8).\n\nPrivate investment in export-oriented industries such as electrical and \nelectronics products will be subdued by the weak global outlook this year, \nalthough investment will likely be relatively buoyant in industries that \ndepend on domestic demand.\n\nThe government is pressing ahead with its Economic Transformation \nProgramme, launched in 2010, to develop higher value-added industries \nand infrastructure in partnership with private investors. According \nto government officials, investment totaling US$58\u00a0billion has been\ncommitted through 2020 under the program. Several large projects \nassociated with this initiative will start construction during the forecast \nperiod, including an $11.5\u00a0billion mass rapid transit rail system in Kuala\nLumpur and redevelopment of the Sungai Besi military airbase and a \nlarge site near the center of the capital for residential and commercial \npurposes. \n\nThe leading index of economic activity in January 2012 suggested \n\nslower economic growth in the near term, and the forward-looking \nBusiness Conditions Index, compiled from a survey of manufacturers, fell \nlate last year (Figure\u00a03.26.8).\n\nFrom the production side, services are likely to continue to drive \ngrowth in 2012. The government is relaxing some restrictions on foreign \ninvestment in 17 services subsectors, including accounting, education, \nlegal, and medical services, following a similar easing for 27 services \nsubsectors in 2009. Tax breaks have been offered to encourage treasury \nmanagement, as well as Islamic and other financial services.\n\nConstruction will gain from work on major projects and \non a US$2.0\u00a0billion off-budget government program to upgrade\ninfrastructure.

Growth of agriculture will decelerate from the rapid \npace seen last year.\n\nFiscal policy is targeted at stimulating domestic demand again \nthis year. The federal deficit is expected to be broadly similar to that \nrecorded for 2011 as a share of GDP. The central bank has signaled that \nit has the flexibility to increase monetary stimulus if the global economy \ndeteriorates.\n\nInflation is forecast to recede to 2.4% (Figure\u00a03.26.9) in light of \nmoderating domestic demand and generally lower prices for imported \ncommodities. This forecast assumes that subsidies on electricity, food, and \nfuel will not be cut ahead of national elections due in 2013. The ringgit \nappreciated by 3.4% against the US dollar in the first quarter of 2012, \nhelping to damp inflation. In 2013, inflation is seen picking up to 2.8%, in \nline with domestic demand.\n\nGrowth in merchandise exports is expected to be subdued in 2012 \nowing to torpid global trade and softer prices for export commodities, \nincluding palm oil. Similarly, imports will increase at a modest rate, in \ntandem with weakness in manufacturing industries and more moderate \ngrowth in private domestic demand. The current account will continue to \nrecord substantial surpluses through the forecast period.\n\nLower than expected growth in global trade would put the 2012 \n\ngrowth forecast at risk, given the country\u2019s reliance on exports. \nDomestically, the high level of household debt poses a risk if the labor \nmarket is weaker than anticipated.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reining in subsidies\nThe cost of government subsidies on fuel, staple foods, electricity, health, \nand education has climbed from 1.3% of total government spending in \n1990 to 14.3% in 2011 (about 4% of GDP). Fuel subsidies alone amounted \nto 4.7% of total government spending in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.26.10). Mainly \nfor this reason, Malaysians consume 450\u00a0liters of fuel a head each year, \n4.5\u00a0times as much as Thais and nine times Indonesians, according to the \ngovernment. \n\nSubsidies suppress inflation, but also contribute to the chronic \nfiscal deficit, reduce budget funding available for social and economic \ndevelopment, and distort resource allocation. The vast bulk of the \nsubsidies benefit consumers, students, and companies in general, rather \nthan the poor, because of inadequate targeting.\n\nThe government started to gradually reduce subsidies in 2010 on \ngasoline, cooking gas, electricity, and road tolls, and committed to better \ntarget remaining subsidies to lower income groups. It offered partial \ncompensation for the upward impact on inflation, including cash rebates \nto owners of motorcycles and small cars (below 1,000cc). Budget savings \nestimated at about US$33\u00a0billion in the 5\u00a0years that subsidies were to be\nphased down were to have been applied to reining in the fiscal deficit. \nHowever the phase-down plan has since been suspended and it is unclear \nwhen it will resume.\n\n3.26.9  Inflation\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.26.10  Subsidies\n\nTotal\n\nFuel \n\n% of government expenditure\n\n94\n\n92\n\n96\n\n98\n\n06\n\n04\n\n02\n\n1990\n2000\nSources: Ministry of Finance.

That trend is forecast to continue, assisted by policy reforms and higher gas \nexports  in  2013.  Inflation  is  expected  to  quicken,  after  receding  in  2011.  The  government  has  taken  steps \nto  revitalize  the  economy,  but  the  agenda  of  required  reforms  is  long.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth edged up to an estimated 5.5% in FY2011 (ended 31\u00a0March \n2012), from an average of 4.9% over the previous 4\u00a0years, based mainly \non investment in hydropower, natural gas, and oil. Agriculture remained \nsubdued owing to flooding and currency appreciation that hurt exports.\n\nInternational tourist arrivals rose by an estimated 26% (Figure\u00a03.27.1), \nin part a response to initial political and economic reforms after national \nelections in November 2010.\n\n(Official GDP growth figures, which are considerably higher than \nthese unofficial estimates, are inconsistent with variables that are closely \ncorrelated with economic growth, such as energy use.)\n\nThe exchange rate of the kyat on the unofficial market appreciated to \n\nabout MK800/$1 in 2011, maintaining an upward trend from MK1,000\nin 2009. The appreciation was driven largely by foreign investment. (The \nofficial exchange rate was maintained at MK5.4/$1 in FY2011.)\n\nOne outcome of the stronger market exchange rate was to reduce rice \n\nexports, which created a surplus in the domestic market and brought \ndown rice prices. That helped slow inflation to 4.2% on average in FY2011, \nfrom 7.3% in the previous fiscal year.\n\nExports of gas increased by nearly 15% to an estimated $3\u00a0billion\n(Figure\u00a03.27.2). Gemstone and jade exports, however, likely declined after \ndoubling in FY2010. Higher levels of imports, particularly construction \nmaterials and machinery, widened the current account deficit to an \nestimated 2.7% of GDP in FY2011, from 0.9% in FY2010.\n\nIncreased foreign investment in energy and hydropower, estimated at \n\n$2.8\u00a0billion in FY2011, lifted international reserves to about $8\u00a0billion by\nMarch 2012, equivalent to 9.4\u00a0months of imports (Figure\u00a03.27.3). Foreign \ninvestment in other industries is insignificant owing to barriers to entry \nand a poor business environment. Total external debt is estimated at \n$11\u00a0billion, with about half in arrears.\n\nThe consolidated fiscal deficit\u2014covering the central government \nand state economic enterprises\u2014is estimated at 5.5% of GDP in FY2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.27.4).

The government\nplans to establish a formal interbank market and relax exchange \nrestrictions on current international payments and transfers. Fiscal policy \nin FY2012 targets a modest fiscal deficit equivalent to 4.6% of GDP.\n\nAmong planned reforms is a land law giving farmers the right to \nown, sell, and mortgage their land. Credit to the farm sector remains \ninadequate, even though the Myanmar Agriculture Development Bank \nhas doubled its funding for farmers in each of the past 2\u00a0years. A \nmicrofinance law was approved in November 2011 to expand microcredit \nto farmers.\n\nThe government is preparing a foreign investment law that is expected \n\nto offer tax breaks to investors and allow them to lease private land and \nrepatriate investment proceeds using market exchange rates. Special \neconomic zones in Dawei in southern Myanmar, Thilawa near Yangon, \nand Kyaukphyu on the west coast will be established to attract industry.\nWhile the government last year ordered that work be suspended on \nthe large Myitsone hydropower project owing to environmental concerns, \ninvestment is picking up on other hydropower and coal-powered plants, \ngas fields, and oil and gas pipelines.\n\nGas production and exports are scheduled to increase sharply in \nFY2013 when the Shwe and Zawtika gas fields and pipelines to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Thailand, now under construction, come \non line. However, a market-determined exchange rate will threaten the \nviability of state economic enterprises that long benefited from importing \ninputs at the official exchange rate, abolished on 1\u00a0April this year.\n\nGDP is forecast to grow by about 6.0% in FY2012 and 6.3% in FY2013 \n(Figure\u00a03.27.5). Inflation is seen quickening to just over 6% (Figure\u00a03.27.6). \nThe authorities raised administered electricity prices in late 2011 and fuel \nprices in early 2012. A government plan to help farmers by supporting \nrice prices is likely to lead to higher retail prices of rice.\n\nRelaxing foreign exchange controls is expected to propel imports \n\nupward and contribute to widening the current account deficit \n(Figure\u00a03.27.7).\n\nEasing of economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar by industrial \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.27.4  Fiscal indicators\n\nFiscal balance\nExpenditure and net lending\nRevenue\n\nImport cover \n\nMonths of imports\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n% of GDP\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.27.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n6.0\n\n6.2\n\n-4.8\n\n6.3\n\n6.3\n\n-5.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.27.5  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\f208    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\ncountries would lead to higher levels of trade and investment, as well as \nthe resumption of assistance and concessionary financing both from these \ncountries and from international financial institutions.\n\n3.27.6  Inflation \n\n32.9\n\n5-year moving average\n\nPolicy challenge highlights\nA key challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability as the country \nopens to increased flows of trade and investment.\n\nAs for policy reforms, the agenda is extensive, given the low level of \n\neconomic and social development. Per capita GDP is one of the lowest \nin Southeast Asia at about $715 (Figure\u00a03.27.8), and 26% of the country\u2019s\n60\u00a0million people live in poverty. Myanmar\u2019s ranking on the United \nNations Human Development Index is near the bottom of the list (149 \nof 187 countries). The country needs to embark on a comprehensive and \nwell-sequenced program of reforms if it is to realize its potential.\n\nPublic institutions, the financial system, and workforce skills are \nfocuses for strengthening. Developing the private sector depends on \nopening more areas to its participation and upgrading the regulatory, \nlegal, and policy environment.\n\nThe government needs to generate adequate fiscal resources to expand \n\ninfrastructure (75% of the population do not have access to electricity) \nand improve health, education, and social protection systems. A simpler \nand broader tax structure and greater emphasis on direct (rather than \nindirect) taxes would bolster fiscal resources and be fairer to the poor.\nExtending transport networks to link Myanmar more closely with \nneighbors would enable its businesses to participate in East and Southeast \nAsian, as well as global, production chains.\n\nUnifying the exchange rate will expose the inefficiencies and losses \nof state enterprises, which dominate parts of the economy. That is likely \nto require reforms to put state enterprises on a more commercial basis, \nincluding privatizing some and possibly closing others. Thus, temporary \nand transparent subsidies will have to be introduced to minimize the \nimpact on the poor as state enterprises raise prices and lay off employees.\nExpanded access to formal finance is another key challenge that will \n\nrequire a phasing out of bank deposit-to-capital ratios and an easing \nof collateral requirements. Upgrading the central bank would involve \ngranting it operational autonomy and strengthening its capacity to \nsupervise the financial sector. Consolidating the domestic banking sector \nand developing partnerships with foreign banks would strengthen the \nbanking system.\n\nAgriculture, which employs over half the population, has great \n\npotential for improvement. The distribution of land ownership certificates \nunder the new land law is a step forward, but will require careful \nimplementation to ensure that the poor benefit. This measure should be \ncomplemented by an expansion of credit to farmers, increased public \ninvestment in rural infrastructure, and better seeds, fertilizers, extension \nservices, and post-harvest facilities.\n\n%\n30\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n$\n\n1,600\n\n1,200\n\n800\n\n400\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n13\n12\nForecast\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.27.7  Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n09\n\n10\n\n08\n\n11\n\n2007\n\n13\n12\nForecast\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.27.8  Per capita income, 2011\n\nMYA\n\nBAN\n\nCAM\n\nLAO\n\nVIE\n\nBAN\u00a0=\u00a0Bangladesh; CAM\u00a0=\u00a0Cambodia; LAO\u00a0=\u00a0Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; MYA\u00a0=\u00a0Myanmar; VIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet\u00a0Nam.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fPhilippines\n\nSlumping exports and a fall in government spending undercut the impact on economic growth of strong \nprivate  consumption  in  2011.  This  year,  the  authorities  have  stepped  up  public  spending  and  relaxed \nmonetary  policy,  laying  the  ground  for  an  upturn  in  GDP  growth  that  is  projected  to  continue  through \n2013. Inflation is seen at moderate levels through the forecast period. Nevertheless, considerably stronger \neconomic  growth  is  needed  to  make  substantial  reductions  in  unemployment  and  poverty. \n\nEconomic performance\nA decline in exports of electronic products and in government spending \ncurtailed GDP growth to 3.7% in 2011. Most of the growth (Figure\u00a03.28.1) \ncame from a 6.1% increase in private consumption, which was again \nsupported by remittances from overseas Filipino workers (up by 7.2% to \n$20.8\u00a0billion, or by 3.0% in peso terms) and by lower lending rates.\n\nFixed capital investment decelerated because of sluggish public \nconstruction and slower growth in private investment. As a share of \nGDP, fixed capital investment declined to 19.3% from a 7-year peak of \n20.5% in 2010. \n\nGovernment consumption and capital spending fell, reflecting a high \n\nbase in 2010 (when expenditure had risen ahead of national elections) and \nthe introduction of governance reforms in 2011 (which delayed spending \nby government agencies). As the economy softened, the government \naccelerated budget disbursements late in the year, mitigating the impact \non the economy of a steep slide in exports. \n\nLower than planned government spending, coupled with some \nimprovement in tax revenue, narrowed the fiscal deficit to 2.0% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.28.2), well within the 3.0% deficit target. Expenditure rose by \njust 2.3% (in nominal terms), with significant shortfalls in infrastructure \noutlays. The tax-to-GDP ratio rose slightly to 12.3%. One impact of these \ndevelopments was to reduce national government debt to the equivalent \nof 50.9% of GDP, the lowest since 1998.\n\nFrom the production aspect, services grew by 5.0% in 2011 and \nprovided three-fourths of total GDP growth. Retail trade, business \nprocess outsourcing (BPO), and financial and real estate services were \nthe main contributors. Industry grew by only 1.9% owing to weak public \nconstruction and subdued manufacturing, caused mainly by a slump in \nelectronics exports. Some other manufacturing subsectors, such as food, \nchemicals, and furniture, drew support from the expanding domestic \nconsumption. Private construction growth eased from the rapid pace \nin 2010. Agriculture, after 2\u00a0years of contraction due to bad weather, \nrecovered by 2.6%. \n\nThis chapter was written by Norio Usui and Teresa Mendoza of the Philippines Country \nOffice, ADB, Manila.

The new jobs slightly exceeded the \nincrease in the labor force. The unemployment rate eased to 7.0% from \n7.4%, but the rate of underemployment rose to 19.3% while other labor \nmarket indicators remained weak: youth unemployment was high at 16.3% \nand employment in manufacturing was low at 8.3% of total employment. \nAbout 20% of the unemployed were college graduates, indicating a \nmismatch between their skills and the needs of the labor market. \n\nHigher global oil and food prices lifted average inflation to 4.8%, just \nwithin the central bank\u2019s 3\u20135% target range. A good harvest helped slow \ninflation from October (Figure\u00a03.28.3). Earlier concerns over inflation \nprompted Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to lift its policy interest rates \nby 50\u00a0basis points in early 2011, to 4.5% for overnight borrowing and \n6.5% for overnight lending. It also raised bank reserve requirements, by \n2\u00a0percentage points to 21.0%. As inflation moderated, the central bank \nkept policy rates steady for the rest of the year. The pace of lending to \nthe private sector almost doubled to 15.7%, and growth in total domestic \ncredit rose sharply to nearly 15%.\n\nA slump in exports widened the trade deficit in 2011, eroding the \ncurrent account surplus (Figure\u00a03.28.4). Merchandise exports fell by 6.9% \nto $47.2\u00a0billion, reflecting soft global demand coupled with supply chain\ndisruptions in electronics caused by the March earthquake in Japan \nand floods in Thailand later in the year. Electronic products (mainly \nsemiconductors), which make up about half of total exports, plunged \nby 23.4%, although the impact was cushioned by double-digit growth in \nshipments of clothing, chemicals, and agricultural commodities. Exports \nof minerals also posted strong gains, helped by high world mineral prices. \nImports rose by 1.6% to $62.7\u00a0billion, with substantial increases in oil\n(reflecting much higher oil prices), and in durable consumer goods and \nindustrial machinery. By contrast, imports of electronics fell, in line with \nelectronics exports, and imports of automobiles were disrupted by the \nflooding in Thailand that closed factories there. \n\nTrade in services produced a larger surplus, mainly owing to \n\nincome from BPO. Remittances also contributed to the current account \nsurplus. Net inflows of portfolio investment rose by 26.6% to $5.5\u00a0billion\nand inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) were broadly steady at \n$1.3\u00a0billion, producing a surplus in the capital and financial account\n(Figure\u00a03.28.5). \n\nRelatively low levels of FDI reflect deficiencies in the investment \nenvironment. The country\u2019s ranking in the World Economic Forum\u2019s \nGlobal Competitiveness Report 2011\u20132012 rose by 10 places to 75 (of 142 \ncountries), mainly due to the lower public deficit and debt, improved \ncredit ratings, and moderate inflation. However, the Philippines \nscored low marks for infrastructure, quality of public institutions, and \ncorruption, so that its overall competitiveness ranking lagged behind \nneighbors such as Indonesia (46) and Viet Nam (65). \n\nGross international reserves increased by 21% to $75.3\u00a0billion, cover\nfor 11.1\u00a0months of imports. Domestic financial markets strengthened, with \nstock prices up by 4% over the year and yields declining on government \nbonds. The peso ended 2011 little changed against the United States (US) \ndollar from a year earlier. \n\n3.28.3 Inflation and policy interest rate\n\nMonthly inflation\nOvernight borrowing rate\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n12\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n11\n\nApr\n\nOct\n\nJul\n\n3.28.4  Current account indicators\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\nCurrent account  balance\n\n% of GDP\n6\n\n%\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 23 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.28.5  Capital account indicators\nCapital and financial account balance\nForeign direct investment inflows\nPortfolio investment\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; National \nStatistical Coordination Board. http://www.nscb.gov.ph \n(accessed 23 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n%\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n$ billion\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nPhilippines    211\n\nEconomic prospects\nForecasts for 2012 and 2013 assume that the government will raise \nspending, follow through on its commitment to improve the business \nenvironment, and carry out some of the planned public\u2013private \npartnerships, which include airports, highways, and water supply \noperations (they were delayed in 2011).\n\nGDP growth is forecast to recover to 4.8% in 2012 (Figure\u00a03.28.6), \nunderpinned by strong private consumption and a pickup in public and \nprivate investment. Household consumption will benefit from inflows of \nremittances, lower average inflation, and positive consumer sentiment. \nRemittances in US dollars will increase by about 5% in 2012, the central \nbank projects. \n\nBusiness sentiment is positive, too, according to a survey by the \ncentral bank in the first quarter of 2012 (Figure\u00a03.28.7). Respondents cited \nincreasing orders, new contracts and projects, and higher government \nspending. Investment commitments approved by state agencies rose \nby 37.6% in 2011. Bank credit has been on an upward trend and the \nstock market index reached a record high in March 2012, spurred by \nexpectations of better corporate earnings. \n\nSovereign rating upgrades support the investment outlook. Moody\u2019s \nraised the country\u2019s foreign and local currency long-term bond ratings in \n2011 from Ba3 to Ba2 (two notches below investment grade), while Fitch \nlifted the long-term foreign currency rating from BB to BB plus (one \nnotch below investment grade). Standard & Poor\u2019s late last year raised \nthe rating outlook to positive from stable\u00a0(its long-term foreign currency \nrating is two notches below investment grade).\n\nFiscal policy is set to be more expansionary in 2012. Budget \n\nallocations for social services and infrastructure are up sharply from 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.28.8) and the budget deficit target is widened to 2.6% of GDP \nfrom last year\u2019s actual deficit of 2.0%. The pickup in budget spending \nthat started late last year continued into January 2012, and in that month \nthe government released to its agencies a large portion of the 2012 \ninfrastructure budget, signifying early project implementation. \n\nMonetary policy has been relaxed to support growth. Early in 2012, \nthe central bank cut policy rates by 50 basis points to the low levels set \nduring the 2009 global recession\u20144.0% for overnight borrowing and \n6.0% for overnight lending. It also reduced bank reserve requirements \nby 3\u00a0percentage points, though this was primarily to offset the impact of \nother changes in the reserve requirements. \n\nThe drag on economic growth exerted by weakness in net exports \nis expected to diminish in 2012. Modest growth is seen for merchandise \nexports (about 5%), on a pickup in economic growth in the US and \nJapan (which together take about a third of exports) and solid growth \nin Southeast Asia (about a sixth). Problems in Europe and moderating \ngrowth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (each absorbing about \none-eighth of exports) will temper export growth.\n\nReversing an 8-month slide, exports in January 2012 rose by 3.0% year \n\non year (21% month on month). Electronics exports picked up, and the \noutlook for semiconductor sales to the US showed improving signs. \n\nMerchandise imports will likely rise faster than exports, given robust \n\nconsumer demand and the expected lift in investment.

BPO export revenue rose by an estimated 22% to $11\u00a0billion in 2011,\nand this industry continues to expand. Construction will benefit from the \nanticipated ramping up of infrastructure projects. \n\nIn 2013, GDP growth is projected to quicken to about 5% on \nexpectations of a more favorable external environment and gathering \nmomentum in infrastructure investment. \n\nInflation is forecast to be lower in 2012 than last year (Figure\u00a03.28.9), \n\nassuming global food and oil prices on average change little this year \nrelative to 2011. The peso is expected to be broadly stable\u00a0against the US \ndollar. \n\nThe government aims to rein in the 2013 budget deficit to 2.0% of \nGDP, which is likely to require a sizable increase in revenue. Thus, in \naddition to efforts on tax administration, the authorities are seeking \nhigher tax revenue from alcohol and tobacco products and an overhaul \nof incentives to attract direct investment. Revenue increases are also \nneeded if the country is to achieve key Millennium Development Goals. \nThe Philippines is making slow progress on the goals related to poverty, \nprimary education, and maternal and child health. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014securing inclusive growth\nEconomic growth in 2000\u20132011 averaged 4.7%, well above 2.9% in the \n1990s and 1.7% in the 1980s. The pickup in growth was driven mainly \nby private consumption, backed by remittance inflows, and on the \nproduction side by services. Inflation has generally been moderate at an \naverage of 5.1% in 2000\u20132011, and the external position has strengthened. \nDespite this better performance, however, structural weaknesses have \nfrustrated the achievement of inclusive growth.\n\nWeak link between growth and development. Unemployment \nand underemployment remained high in 2011. Many workers are in \nlow-productivity jobs and real average wages have declined. With a Gini \ncoefficient of over 40, income inequality is also high. The incidence of \npoverty fell from 33.1% in 1991 to 24.9% in 2003, but then turned up to \n26.4% in 2006 and stayed around that rate in 2009. About 9.5\u00a0million \nFilipinos, or nearly 10% of the population, work abroad because of a lack \nof good jobs at home.\n\nRising growth and declining investment. Although growth quickened \nin 2000\u20132011, fixed investment as a share of GDP declined to 19% in the \nmost recent\u00a0years (it was 19.3% in 2011, for example), from slightly above \n20% in 2000 (Figure\u00a03.38.10). In Indonesia, by contrast, the investment \nrate has climbed from about 19% to 32% over the same period. \n\nLimited diversification of exports. Merchandise exports are highly \nconcentrated in electronics (60% of total exports in 2010), particularly \nsemiconductors (about 77% of total electronics exports). This structure \nmakes the economy vulnerable to downturns in global electronics \ndemand and to disrupted electronics production chains, as happened in \n2011. Philippine merchandise exports fell in the second half of 2011, while \nexports generally increased in other Southeast Asian countries.\n\n3.28.8  Government infrastructure outlays\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nSource: Department of Budget and Management.

The main growth engine \n\nof high-performing Asian economies has been dynamic structural \ntransformation: output shifts from low-productivity goods into high-\nproductivity ones, particularly manufactures; labor moves from \nagriculture to industry; and exports become more diversified. Industry \nin these economies has maintained productivity gains by upgrading \ntechnology and manufactured products. This transformation sustains \ngrowth and generates better-paying jobs to reduce poverty.\n\nBut in the Philippines, industry\u2019s share of GDP declined from 39% \nin 1980 to 32% in 2011. Manufacturing accounted for just 22.4% of GDP \nand 8.3% of employment that year. Growth has instead relied on services \n(Figure\u00a03.28.11), a trend accelerated by rapid expansion of BPO services \nover the past 7\u00a0years (Figure\u00a03.28.12).\n\nSluggish growth in industry has suppressed economy-wide \nlabor productivity, which rose by only 10% over the past 30\u00a0years \n(Figure\u00a03.28.13). Labor productivity in services has been less than half \nthat of industry over this period. This implies that, although services has \nmade the greatest contribution to economic growth and job creation, it is \nnot necessarily associated with a rise in high-productivity employment on \naggregate.\n\nThe BPO industry employs only about 1% of the labor force and it \nhires relatively skilled workers. Given the large, and increasing, number \nof underutilized workers with moderate skills, it is unlikely that BPO \nalone can drive inclusive growth. \n\nUnderlying reasons for the industrial stagnation can be traced to \n\nthe 1980s, when global manufacturers relocated production to East \nand Southeast Asia. They sidestepped the Philippines largely because \nof domestic political instability. Later success at attracting electronics, \nmainly assembly work, in the 1990s raised the promise of a deepening \nof industrial capabilities. However, the electronics industry has not \nupgraded and diversified its products and its presence has not spurred \nsignificant development in fields such as machinery, chemicals, and \nmetals processing, owing to the underprovision of infrastructure \n(particularly transport networks and electricity supply) and an unfriendly \nbusiness environment (poor governance, weak contract enforcement and \nproperty rights, and cumbersome business regulations).\n\nPolicy actions. A first step is to resolve pervasive constraints by \n\naccelerating development of the physical, institutional, and social \ninfrastructure; instituting good governance; and improving the business \nenvironment. \n\nSpecifically for industry, the government could consider support for \ndiversification and value addition. Decisions on restructuring, innovation, \nand product mixes are matters for the private sector. Still, the government \ncan play a strategic and coordinating role in creating incentives for \nindustrial development and providing targeted support for selected \nproducts, with benchmarks for success and sunset clauses for phasing out \nsupport. Such measures would involve close government\u2013private sector \ncooperation to identify promising products and to diagnose and address \nimpediments to their development. \n\n3.28.11  Sector contribution to GDP growth, \n1980\u20132010\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n8.4\n\n44.744.7\n\n47.0\n\n48.4\n\n39.1\n\n3.3\n\n29.029.0\n\n67.7\n\n9.3\n\n49.049.0\n\n41.8\n\n%\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nSource: N.

Singapore\u2019s  vital \ntrade  in  manufactured  goods  and  financial  services  will  not  fully  stabilize  until  the  world  economic \noutlook  improves,  forecast  for  the  latter  part  of  this  year  and  into  2013.  Still,  strong  domestic  demand \nis helping offset the weak external sector. In 2013, the growth rate should pick up pace as the recovery \nin  the  United  States  (US)  strengthens  and  the  eurozone  situation  improves.\n\nEconomic performance\nFollowing a record 14.8% jump in 2010, economic growth eased to 4.9% \nin 2011. The main contributor to growth was domestic demand, notably \nprivate consumption and investment (Figure\u00a03.29.1). Private consumption \nrose by 4.1% and accounted for 30% of overall growth. Supporting this \nwas strong employment: the unemployment rate dipped as low as 2% \nafter a tightening of foreign worker levies was announced in February. \nInvestment increased by almost 10%, contributing 40% of overall growth. \nGross fixed capital formation rose by only 3.3% but, because of a much \ndiminished rundown of inventories, investment was higher. Government \nconsumption nudged up by less than 1%.\n\nEven though external trade was so weak, especially toward the end \nof the year (Figure\u00a03.29.2), net exports still accounted for 25% of overall \ngrowth. Exports climbed by only 2.6%. The weak trade performance was \nin contrast to that in 2010, when net exports rose by 40% (versus 3.4% in \n2011) and accounted for the bulk of a much higher overall growth rate.\nThe main supply contributors to growth were manufacturing and \nfinancial services (Figure\u00a03.29.3). Manufacturing output increased by 7.6%, \na healthy rate buoyed by biomedical exports, but this was a big pullback \nfrom the exceptional 30% growth seen in 2010. The electronics subsector \nslumped, as global demand dropped for semiconductors and related \nequipment. The impact was severe in the last quarter, as falling business \nconfidence combined with a general inventory overhang.\n\nDespite the uncertain global context, financial services grew by 9%; \nthey now directly account for 12% of GDP and support a large number of \nrelated subsectors. The accommodation and food services subsector rose \nby 6%, driven by fast-growing tourist arrivals, although the wholesale \nand retail trade subsector grew only marginally, reflecting the weak \ntrade performance. Transport and storage and business services climbed \nstrongly in the first half but fell flat in the second.\n\nConstruction activity was slow, particularly in the fourth quarter, \nmainly reflecting a decline in residential building.

Housing costs rose \nby 8.3% and transport costs by 12% (reflecting tightening of certificates \nof entitlement designed to reduce traffic congestion). Imported inflation \nassociated with food and fuel prices was also a contributing factor, \nalthough the general strength of the Singapore dollar helped lessen \nimported price pressures. Core inflation was around half the headline rate.\nAfter the rebound of economic activity in 2010, fiscal consolidation \nhas replaced fiscal stimulus introduced in response to the global financial \ncrisis. Although the FY2011 budget (1\u00a0April\u201331\u00a0March 2012) projected a \nsmall deficit, a substantial surplus is now expected of about S$2.3\u00a0billion\nor 0.7% of GDP. Revenue was higher than expected owing to strong \ncorporate income and property-related tax receipts.\n\nMonetary policy was relatively tight during the year, designed to \nreduce inflation. Money supply (M2) rose by 10.0%, or slightly more \nthan in 2010. As the year progressed, however, policy makers became \nincreasingly concerned about the deteriorating global and domestic \neconomic outlook. As in the past, the main lever of monetary policy was \nthe exchange rate. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) eased \nmonetary policy a little in October 2011 by lowering the gradient of the \ntrading band within which the Singapore dollar is allowed to trade. The \naverage exchange rate for the year was S$1.26/US$1, an appreciation of\n8.4% from the average in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.29.5).\n\nThe overall balance-of-payments surplus was US$17.1\u00a0billion, the result\n\nof a decline in net outflows in the capital and financial account, and a \nslight increase in the current account surplus. International financial \nturbulence in the second half of 2011 prompted a sharp fall in Singapore\u2019s \nequity and currency markets, prompting the MAS to cushion the impact \nthrough injecting dollar liquidity.\n\nExports grew at a diminishing rate in 2011. In the case of non-oil \nexports and reexports, exports actually contracted in the second half; \nweakening external demand was compounded by the natural disasters \nin Japan and Thailand that severely disrupted global supply chains for \nelectronics and other key sectors in which Singapore plays a significant \nrole. As noted, while imports also experienced diminishing growth, they \ngrew more rapidly than exports. Singapore nonetheless maintained a large \nsurplus in its transactions with the rest of the world, and its international \nreserves increased to US$238\u00a0billion.\n\nEconomic prospects\nDespite strong domestic demand, economic growth is forecast to slow \nfurther in 2012 to 2.8%. Weak external demand stemming from the \npossibility of a recession in the eurozone, a slow US recovery, and the \nmoderating growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) will continue \nto hold back exports and investment in trade-related sectors. Growth is \nforecast to recover to 4.5% in 2013, assuming that the global economic \noutlook improves.\n\n3.29.3  Contributions to growth (supply),  \nselected sectors\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\nManufacturing\n\nFinancial services\n\nTransport and storage\n\nBusiness services\n\nWholesale and retail\n\nHotels and restaurants\n\nConstruction\n\n0\n\n2\n6\n4\nPercentage points\n\n8\n\nSource: Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry. 2011. \nEconomic Survey of Singapore. http://app.mti.gov.sg\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.29.4  Sources of inflation, 2011\n\nHousing\nTransport\nFood\nEducation and stationary\nRecreation and others\nHealth care\nClothing and footwear\nCommunications\n\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nPercentage points\n\nSource: Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry. 2012. \nEconomic Survey of Singapore 2011.

Private sector \ninvestment will likely be anemic on concern over global prospects. \nPublic infrastructure investment, though, will remain a priority of the \ngovernment, even as it continues its policy of fiscal consolidation. \n\n3.29.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n18.0\n\n4.5\n\n2.5\n\n16.0\n\nThe FY2012 budget announced in February indicated a surplus of 0.4% \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nof GDP for the current fiscal year (ending 31\u00a0March 2013). The budget \nfocuses on measures to reduce the dependence on foreign workers and to \nstrengthen productivity and innovation, following the recommendations \nlast year of the Economic Strategies Committee of the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice. The government is in a solid position to introduce new fiscal \nstimuli, if they are needed, to act early against any early signs of a \ndeveloping economic setback.\n\nManufacturing, especially its electronics subsector, will continue to \nrun into the headwinds that have not fully dissipated from the second \nhalf of 2011 (Figure\u00a03.29.6). The sector is highly dependent on final \ndemand in the US and Europe, neither of which is expected to show \nstrength this year. \n\nAlso, Singaporean electronics firms have to restructure and seek \nhigher value-added development opportunities. Firms are continuing to \nhire and expand, but cautiously in light of the uncertain global outlook. \nAlthough trade within Asia, notably with the PRC, has continued to \nexpand rapidly, it is heavily based on global value chains and final \ndemand in advanced countries. The biomedical manufacturing subsector \nis, however, less sensitive than the electronics industry to variations in \nexternal demand, and appears to have strong growth potential.\n\nSimilar to manufacturing, financial services are expected to face \n\ncontinued headwinds during the next couple of years, but recently \ninternational equity markets have seen a big lift, including those in \nSingapore, one of Asia\u2019s biggest wealth management centers. Demand \nfrom the region for services such as finance, logistics, and tourism is \nlikely to continue growing. \n\nThe conditions driving Singapore property prices higher in \n\nrecent\u00a0years\u2014notably brisk demand and tight supply\u2014are expected to \ncontinue easing, mainly because the measures taken last year by the \ngovernment to cool the property market appear to have been effective \n(Figure\u00a03.29.7). The continued slowdown in the economy should help cool \ndemand further, contributing to a correction in home prices and sales \nvolume this year.\n\nInflation is forecast to decline to 3.0% and 2.5% in 2012 and 2013, \n\nabetted by slow domestic and global growth. The strength of the \nSingapore dollar will also help contain imported inflation, as will the \nexpected easing of world commodity prices (apart from oil). As inflation \nrecedes, the MAS will likely take further steps to loosen monetary policy.\nSingapore will continue to have very large current account surpluses, \nthe equivalent of 18.0% and 16.0% of GDP in 2012 and 2013. Merchandise \nexports, although with subdued growth, will remain an important \nsource of growth. The services account will likely remain in surplus, \nboosted by tourism receipts and strong external demand for Singapore\u2019s \nfinancial services. By contrast, the income account will remain in deficit. \n\n3.29.6  Manufacturing growth, 6-month \nmoving average\n\nManufacturing, year on year\nManufacturing, month on month \nElectronics, month on month \n\n%\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n \n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\n \n\nJul\n\n \n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nJan\n11\n\nSource: Singapore Economic Development Board.

The biggest risk lies in the eurozone and possible worsening \nof its sovereign debt crisis. Independently of that, a sharper than expected \nslowdown in the PRC would weaken Singapore\u2019s growth prospects. Yet \nanother risk is a possible spike in oil prices caused by Middle East tensions.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014Foreign workers/productivity \ntradeoff\n\nForeign workers account for over one-third of the labor force \n(Figure\u00a03.29.8), reflecting the aging structure of the population and \ndeclining birth rates (Figure\u00a03.29.9). The large presence of foreign workers \nhas enabled Singapore to expand its manufacturing, financial services, \nand other key sectors. Further, skilled foreign workers have helped it \nmaintain its cost competitiveness in high-end products.\n\nTheir prevalence may, however, have lowered the wages of local \n\nlow-skilled workers. There has also been concern that such a large presence \nmay have discouraged technology adoption and lowered labor productivity. \nHousing pressures and other consequences are further areas of concern.\n\nIn this slow-growth period, policy makers are concentrating on ways to \nmitigate some of these effects, especially the intensifying competition with \nforeign workers for unskilled jobs. The Economic Strategies Committee \nhas recommended restricting the number of foreign workers and targeting \nproductivity growth of 2\u20133% annually, leading to an economy of highly \nskilled workers employed in innovative services and industry sectors.\n\nThus foreign worker levies, paid by employers, are being raised at \n6-month intervals, starting in January 2012 through July 2013. Increases \nin the levies vary by sector, generally higher for low-skilled work (e.g., \nconstruction) and lower for high-skilled work (manufacturing and \nfinancial services). Dependency ratio ceilings are also being reduced, \nwhich specify the maximum proportion of foreign workers that \ncompanies can hire. Concurrently, the government is encouraging \nbusinesses to invest in productivity and to reduce their reliance on \nlow-skilled foreign workers. Multinational and large companies should \nadjust to the higher levies and lower quotas without much difficulty, but \nsmall and medium-sized companies (SMEs) relying heavily on foreign \nworkers will find it hard to restructure.\n\nTo facilitate the transition, a S$2\u00a0billion National Productivity Fund has\nbeen established. Further, the government has introduced specific initiatives \nto help SMEs restructure their operations, such as the SME Productivity \nRoadmap, which provides a systematic approach for improving productive \ncapacity. The Continuing Education and Training system is designed to \nensure that Singaporeans\u2019 skills are regularly upgraded.\n\nSingapore has determined that it must reduce its dependence on \nforeign workers and transition to higher value-added activities. The \nstructural realignment will be gradual, but potentially far-reaching.\n\n3.29.8  Labor force\n\nResident \n\nForeign\n\nThousand persons\n\n2,100\n\n1,400\n\n700\n\n0\n\n2006\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nNote: Resident refers to Singapore citizens and permanent \nresidents.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.29.9  Selected demographic trends\n\nOld-age dependency ratio\n\nFertility rate \n\n% of working-age\npopulation\n\nBirths per\nwoman\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1980\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n2000\n\n05\n\n10\n\nSource: World Bank.

This  year,  reconstruction  and  policy  stimulus  will  spark \na  rebound  in  growth,  despite  sluggish  exports,  and  inflation,  which  quickened  in  2011,  is  forecast  to \nmoderate.  Rebuilding  factories  and  infrastructure,  as  well  as  investor  confidence,  will  be  a  major  task \nduring  the  forecast  period.\n\nEconomic performance\nWidespread flooding in August\u2013November 2011, the worst in more than \n50\u00a0years, devastated the economy. The floods across central and northern \nThailand disrupted industries, including agriculture, construction, \ntransport, and retailing, for months. The economy contracted by 9.0% \nyear on year in the fourth quarter (Figure\u00a03.30.1), leaving GDP for the year \njust 0.1%\u00a0higher than in 2010.\n\nManufacturing slumped by 21.8% in the fourth quarter when the \n\nfloods submerged factories making automobiles, hard-disk drives, \nelectrical appliances, semiconductors, and textiles. As Thailand is the \nworld\u2019s 12th biggest automobile maker and accounts for 25% of global \nhard-disk drives, the factory closures caused economic dislocation far \nbeyond its borders.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami had caused \n\nsupply shortages for the Thai auto and hard-disk drive industries, \nreducing output. For the whole year, overall manufacturing production \nfell by 4.3%.\n\nConstruction was also hit on two fronts\u2014public projects were delayed \n\nby national elections and a change of government in the third quarter, \nand private activity was curtailed during the flooding. Total construction \nactivity for the year fell by 5.1%.\n\nServices contracted in the fourth quarter, largely because of the \nfloods, although grew by 3.8% over the whole year and were the main \ncontributor to the marginal rise in GDP. Tourist arrivals fell by 4.7% \nin October\u2013December (but still rose by 17.9% to 18.8\u00a0million in 2011 \nfrom 2010, a year in which arrivals fell because of 2\u00a0months of violent \ndemonstrations).\n\nFlooding reduced agricultural yields in the second half, though for \nthe full year farm output increased by 3.8% owing to a rebound in the \nfirst half from a weak prior-year performance.\n\nPrivate consumption was subdued in 2011 (Figure\u00a03.30.2), in part a \n\nresult of the floods, which dented consumer confidence and lowered \nincomes in affected areas. Farm incomes were hurt in the second half, \n\nThis chapter was written by Luxmon Attapich of the Thailand Resident Mission, ADB, \nBangkok.\n\n3.30.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry \nServices\n\nPercentage points\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\nGDP\n\n%\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ3 Q1\n09\n\nQ3 Q1\n10\n\nQ3 Q1\n11\n\nQ3\n\nSource: National Economic and Social Development Board. \nhttp://www.nesdb.go.th (accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.2  Contributions to growth (demand)\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPercentage points\n10\n\n5.0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n7.8\n\n0.1\n\nGDP\n\n%\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-2.3\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSource: National Economic and Social Development Board. \nhttp://www.nesdb.go.th (accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n11\n\n10\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand    219\n\nboth by the impact of flooding and lower prices for some agricultural \ncommodities. Rising inflation contributed to weakness in private \nconsumption, which grew by just 1.3% in 2011.\n\nGovernment consumption was similarly sluggish. The government \nthat took office in August 2011 reviewed and adjusted the budget for the \nfiscal year starting October 2011 (FY2012), which held up some spending.\nPrivate fixed investment, robust for most of 2011, suffered when \nthe floods hit, but still rose by 7.2% for the year. Public investment, by \ncontrast, fell by 8.7% owing to a combination of the floods, postponement \nof decisions on public works during the election period, and the delay in \ncompleting the FY2012 budget.\n\nGrowth in merchandise exports slowed to 16.4% in US dollar terms \nfrom 28.4% in 2010. The inundation of many export-oriented factories cut \nmerchandise exports by nearly 5.2% in the fourth quarter (Figure\u00a03.30.3). \nRice exports turned down late in the year because of the impact of floods \nand a new government policy to pay higher prices to farmers for rice, \nreducing its competitiveness in export markets.\n\nClosure of factories during the floods and supply disruptions from the \nearthquake in Japan also damped growth in imports, despite much higher \nprices for imported oil. The surplus in goods trade fell, but the deficit \nin services narrowed slightly, reflecting higher receipts from tourism \nand insurance (from flood claims). That left a current account surplus \nequivalent to 3.4% of GDP, a decline of about a half\u00a0percentage point from \nthe previous year.\n\nThe capital and financial account recorded a net outflow of \n\n$7.2\u00a0billion, the effect of an increase in outward direct investment and\nwithdrawal of portfolio investment from emerging markets in the \nsecond half of last year. Foreign direct investment into Thailand fell by \n13% to $8.4\u00a0billion in 2011. Outward direct investment nearly doubled to\n$10.8\u00a0million, in part a result of relaxed regulations on Thai investment\nabroad. Gross international reserves edged up by 1.7% to $175.1\u00a0billion,\ncover for 10\u00a0months of imports.\n\nHigher oil prices and flood-induced disruptions to supplies of food \nand other consumer goods lifted average inflation to 3.8% in 2011. The \npace of food price inflation reached a 3-year high of 10.2% in November \n(Figure\u00a03.30.4).\n\nIn response to upward pressure on prices and inflation expectations, \n\nthe Bank of Thailand raised its policy interest rate six times in the \nfirst 8\u00a0months of the year, to 3.5%. It then reversed course when the \nflooding hit, the economy contracted, and the global economic outlook \ndeteriorated, lowering the policy rate in November and again in January \n2012, to 3.0% (Figure\u00a03.30.5). Commercial bank lending slowed toward \nend-2011, though still rose by 14.9% for the year. The baht depreciated by \n3.9% on average against the US dollar during 2011.\n\nThe fiscal deficit narrowed to 1.5% of GDP in FY2011 and public debt \n\ndeclined to 40.3% of GDP. Spending on the Thai Khem Kaeng (Strong \nThailand) infrastructure program fell short of target (about 86% of its \nbudgeted funding was disbursed).\n\nTo support farmers, the new government committed to purchase \nunmilled rice at B15,000 ($500) a ton from October 2011\u2014well above the\nmarket price\u2014and budgeted B400\u00a0billion ($13.2\u00a0billion) in FY2012 for this\n\n3.30.3  Merchandise trade growth\n\nExports\n\nImports\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2007\n\nQ1\n08\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\n  Q3\n\n Q3\n\nQ1\n10\n\n Q1\n11\n\nQ1\n09\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th (accessed \n28 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.4  Monthly inflation\n\nFood \n\nOverall\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2007\n\nJan\n08\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nFeb\n12\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company; Bureau of Trade and Economic \nIndices. http://www.price.moc.go.th (both accessed \n20\u00a0March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.5  Policy interest rate\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n09\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 20 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n%\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n%\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n20Mar\n12\n\n\f220    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\npurpose. The policy drove up both the domestic price of this staple food \nand the price set by Thai exporters. \n\nOverseas buyers were not, however, prepared to pay the higher \nprices, at a time that rice exporters in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, and \nViet\u00a0Nam were eager to sell, so that Thai rice exports fell by 29% in the \nfirst 2\u00a0months of 2012 from the prior-year period. The government, facing \nheavy costs as rice inventories build, is seeking bilateral government sales. \nIt has had some success with Indonesia, which agreed to buy 1\u00a0million \ntons of milled rice annually over 5\u00a0years.\n\nEconomic prospects\nReconstruction of flood-damaged areas and substantial policy stimulus \nwill drive a rebound in economic growth in 2012, despite the torpid \nglobal outlook. GDP growth is expected to recover from last year\u2019s \nmarginal 0.1% to 5.5% through the forecast period (Figure\u00a03.30.6).\n\nPrivate consumption growth will be underpinned by a tight labor \nmarket, civil service salary increases in January 2012, and a 40% boost in \nminimum wages in April. The government has also introduced incentives \nfor first-time buyers of houses (tax breaks) and automobiles (cash rebates). \nConsequently, consumer confidence has started to pick up (Figure\u00a03.30.7) \nafter plunging during the floods.\n\n Sales of consumer durables are getting a lift from the replacement \nof household appliances and furniture damaged during the inundations. \nAutomobile sales, which had slumped by 62% year on year in the worst \nmonth, November, rebounded in January and February this year.\n\nInvestment will benefit from extensive private and public reconstruction \n\nwork in flood-hit areas coupled with replacement of capital equipment. \nSmall and medium-sized businesses affected by the floods have access to a \n$10\u00a0billion low-interest loan program set up by the Bank of Thailand.\n\nIn signs of recovery, the industrial capacity utilization rate recovered \nto 62.3% in February, well up from 40.1% at its lowest point in November \n2011 (Figure\u00a03.30.8), and indexes for private consumption and private \ninvestment surpassed preflood levels. Tourist arrivals rose by 5.2% year on \nyear in the first 2\u00a0months of 2012.\n\nHalf the factories flooded in 2011 had resumed full production by the \n\nend of February, but some are not expected to get back to that until the \nsecond or third quarters.\n\nFiscal and monetary policies have been set to spur growth. Flood-\n\nrelief measures rolled out in the last quarter of 2011 included a debt \nmoratorium and low-interest loans for farmers and low-income \nhouseholds; payments of B5,000 ($165) for households affected by the\nfloods plus B20,000 ($645) for house repairs; and tax exemptions for\nbusinesses that invest in new production facilities. Businesses get a cut \nin the corporate income tax rate to 23% this year and 20% in 2013, from \n30% in 2011.\n\nIn addition to budget outlays, the authorities will spend large amounts \n\noff budget on reconstruction and flood prevention. Parliament approved \nan emergency decree allowing the government to borrow the equivalent \nof $11.3\u00a0billion by June 2013 for flood prevention and water management\nprojects over the next few\u00a0years.\n\n3.30.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n5.5\n\n3.4\n\n0.5\n\n5.5\n\n3.3\n\n-0.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.30.6  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.7  Confidence indicators\n\nConsumer confidence \n\nBusiness sentiment\n\nIndex\n\n92\n\n84\n\n76\n\n68\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n10\n\nJan\n08\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n2007\n\nFeb\n12\nSources: Center for Economic and Business Forecasting; \nBank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th (both accessed \n20\u00a0March 2012). \nClick here for figure data\n\nJan\n11\n\n3.30.8  Capacity utilization rate\n\nTotal\nMotor vehicles\nOffice and computing machinery\nCommunications equipment\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n%\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n09\n\nJan\n2008\n\nJan\n10\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th (accessed \n9\u00a0March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\nFeb\n12\n\nJan\n11\n\nJul\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand    221\n\nTo pave the way for this borrowing, the government shifted \n\nresponsibility for paying interest on about $46\u00a0billion of the debt of the\nFinancial Institutions Development Fund from its budget to the Bank of \nThailand, effective September 2013. That debt was issued during the late \n1990s\u2019 Asian financial crisis to recapitalize Thai banks.\n\nFurther, the government set up a $1.6\u00a0billion disaster insurance fund\n\nto help households and businesses buy insurance (premiums charged \nby reinsurers rose sharply after the floods), and it outlined an ambitious \ninfrastructure program including roads and railways that could cost up to \n$70\u00a0billion over 5\u201310\u00a0years. (Similar infrastructure initiatives by previous\nadministrations have seen projects delayed or rolled over into later \nprograms.)\n\nThe ramping up of spending to deal with the impact of the floods is \nexpected to raise the fiscal deficit of the central government, including \nbudget and off-budget spending, to about 5% of GDP in FY2012, before \nthe gap narrows as GDP grows. Monetary policy is accommodative, with \nthe policy interest rate at 3.0%, below inflation.\n\nRecovery in manufacturing and agriculture will support growth \n\nin merchandise exports this year, despite sluggish world trade and \nuncertainties over Thai rice exports. Merchandise exports are projected \nto increase by 15.0%. Imports will increase faster than exports, by \nabout 23.0% in 2012, reflecting purchases of capital equipment for \nreconstruction and robust consumer spending. The current account \nwill likely slip into deficit next year, equivalent to about 0.5% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.30.9).\n\nNet foreign inflows into Thai bonds totaled B50\u00a0billion in the first \n2\u00a0months of 2012, and the Thai Bond Market Association predicts a 20% \nincrease for this year as international investors seek higher yields.\n\nFood price inflation has receded, along with the floods. Nevertheless, \n\nupward pressure on prices will come from stronger domestic demand, \nrising minimum wages, heavy government spending, and a planned \nreintroduction of excise tax on diesel fuel. Inflation is forecast to average \n3.4% in 2012 and 3.3% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.30.10).\n\nGovernment borrowing to fund water management projects is \nprojected to lift the public debt to 48.6% of GDP this year and 50.4% \nin 2013 (Figure\u00a03.30.11). While these levels are manageable, the large \noutlays planned on infrastructure, coupled with cuts in corporate taxes \nand diminishing revenue from import taxes owing to trade agreements, \nsuggest the debt may continue to rise without new revenue sources such \nas a broader personal income tax base or an environmental tax.\nThe anticipated rebound in growth this year depends on the \n\ngovernment reconstructing flood-damaged infrastructure and making \na significant start on longer-term projects involving flood-prevention \nand water management. Funding is allocated for this work, but the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to implement projects poses a risk: the rate of \ndisbursement of the capital budget has fallen to under 60% in recent \nyears.\n\nOther risks to the outlook include a deeper than assumed recession \nin the eurozone\u2014the market for nearly 10% of Thai exports and source of \nabout 27% of its tourists. Higher than projected global oil prices are also a \ndownside risk. Flooding and drought are a perennial threat. \n\n3.30.9  Current account balance\n\n5-year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.30.10  Annual inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n3.30.11  Public debt \n\n% of GDP\n\n55\n\n48\n\n41\n\n34\n\n27\n\n20\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\nSource: Ministry of Finance. http://www.mof.go.th \n(accessed 29 March 2012).\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f222    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014after the deluge\nThe expansion of industrial zones, often on former low-lying farm land, \nhas increased chances that heavy floods will have a really severe impact \non the economy, as in 2011.\n\nResulting prolonged closures of factories and extensive damage to a \nbroad range of businesses (Figure\u00a03.30.12) also raises the risk that foreign \nfirms could become reluctant to expand manufacturing and warehousing \nin Thailand. Maintaining investor confidence depends on rebuilding \nflood-damaged infrastructure promptly, carrying out flood prevention \nand mitigation projects, and establishing a better institutional structure \nto handle crises.\n\nBy January 2012, the government had approved a master plan for \nwater management that, among other things, covers upgrading warning \nsystems, flood protection and management infrastructure, and a central \nagency for water resource management.\n\nFurther, the cabinet cleared 246 flood management projects costing \nB24.8\u00a0billion ($818.5\u00a0million) during the first quarter of this year. These\nprojects include raising highway levels in flood-prone areas and building \ndikes and drainage systems. Line agencies are scrambling to get as many \nprojects as possible completed or under way before the next wet season. \nOfficials are identifying land to be set aside as floodways.\n\nThailand\u2019s ability to assuage investor sentiment will also depend on \nthe replacement infrastructure being better able to manage the impact of \nprolonged heavy rainfall and floods than the former structures.\n\nMoreover, although reconstruction must be pursued quickly, it will \nbe important to address longer-term water management issues as well, \nand to ensure that water-related projects in one region take into account \ntheir impact on other regions. For example, Bangkok and surrounding \nindustrial areas at the lower reaches of the Chao Phraya river basin \ndepend on good water management in the basin\u2019s upper reaches to \nprevent floods that later affect the heavily populated lower regions.\n\n3.30.12  Flood damages and losses, 2011 \n\nInfrastructure\nAgriculture, livestock,\nand fishery\nManufacturing\nTourism\n\nFinance and banking\nHousing\nEducation, health, and\ncultural heritage\n\n4.0%\n\n1.9%\n\n5.9%\n\n2.8%\n\n8.1%\n\n6.7%\n\n70.3%\n\nTotal = $46.7 billion\n\nSources: Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation; \nMinistry of Finance. \nClick here for figure data\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nThe policy tightening adopted to curb high inflation in 2011 also slowed economic growth. The authorities \nloosened monetary policy in early 2012, and signaled that further easing is likely if inflation trends down. \nIt is indeed seen receding this year, but then edging up again next year. GDP growth is forecast to remain \nsubdued,  before  picking  up  in  2013.  Beyond  macroeconomic  stabilization,  the  government  needs  to \naddress  risks  in  the  financial  sector.\n\nEconomic performance\nConfronted at the start of 2011 with soaring inflation and rapidly \ndepleting foreign reserves, the government adopted a package of \nmonetary and fiscal tightening measures\u2014Resolution 11\u2014that were \nsustained through the year. Policy tightening started to rein in inflation \nand damped economic growth, to 5.9% for the year (Figure\u00a03.31.1) as \ninvestment fell and consumption growth moderated, more than offsetting \nan improvement in net exports.\n\nInvestment declined by 9.2% owing to high lending rates and cuts in \npublic infrastructure investment, both elements of the policy tightening. \nGross capital formation as a ratio to GDP moderated to 38.7%, the lowest \nin 4\u00a0years.\n\nPrivate consumption decelerated to 4.4% as high inflation eroded real \nincomes. Public consumption growth slowed to 7.2%, reflecting the firmer \nfiscal stance. Net exports, by contrast, strengthened in 2011 as exports \ngrew faster than imports, making a major contribution to GDP growth.\nFrom the production side, a 7.0% expansion in services made the \nbiggest contribution to total growth (2.9\u00a0percentage points). Wholesale \nand retail trading and hotels and restaurants both grew by about 7.5%, the \nlatter supported by a 19% increase in visitor arrivals.\n\nStronger exports of manufactured goods underpinned an 8.3% \nexpansion in manufacturing. However, construction fell by 1.0% due \nto cuts in public investment and curbs on lending for property. Better \nweather, strong commodity prices, and solid export demand for high-\nquality rice drove a 4.0% pickup in agriculture.\n\nInflation climbed to a 2011 peak of 23.0% year on year in August \n(Figure\u00a03.31.2). It was driven by rising food prices, the lagged impact of \nhigh credit growth in 2010, exchange rate devaluations, and hikes in \nadministrative prices of electricity and fuel. Food prices shot up by 34.1% \nyear on year in August. Subsequently, food prices eased and, coupled with \nthe impact of the policy tightening, brought inflation down, although it \nwas still high at 14.2% in March 2012.\n\nThis chapter was written by Dominic Mellor, Chu Hong Minh, and Nguyen Luu Thuc \nPhuong of the Viet Nam Resident Mission, ADB, Ha Noi.\n\n3.31.1  Contributions to growth (demand)\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nGDP\nInvestment\nNet exports\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.3\n\n5.3\n\n6.8\n\n5.9\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: General Statistics Office.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.31.2  Inflation\n\nOverall (year on year)\nOverall, excluding food (year on year)\n\nOverall (month on month)\n\n%\n28\n\n21\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n-7\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2009\n\nJan\n10\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n11\n\nMar\n12\n\nSource: General Statistics Office.\nClick here for figure data\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n%\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n\f224    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nPolicy tightening by the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV, the central \nbank) was a combination of curbs on credit and money supply, hikes \nin bank reserve requirements and interest rates, and open-market \noperations. The repo rate\u2014the cost of borrowing by commercial banks \nfrom the SBV on short-term open market operations\u2014was ratcheted up \nfrom 10% to 14% in 2011, and the refinancing rate from 9% to 15%. The \nreserve ratio for banks\u2019 United States (US) dollar deposits was doubled \nto 8.0% for terms of less than 12\u00a0months and tripled to 6.0% for terms of \n12\u00a0months or more.\n\nAs inflation trended down, real interest rates on dong deposits rose \nbut remained negative. Liquidity shortages at some banks prompted them \nto offer deposit interest rates close to 20%, above a 14% cap imposed by \nthe SBV. The average rate for borrowing in dong rose to 22% in July 2011, \nbefore easing to 19% by March 2012.\n\nHigh borrowing costs, central bank administrative controls, and weak \n\nbusiness sentiment pulled back growth in credit to 14.3% year on year by \nthe end of 2011, from a rapid 32.4% in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.31.3). Tighter liquidity \ncontained growth in M2 money supply to 12.1%, slowing from 33.3% the \nprevious year.\n\nMost commercial banks met a year-end deadline to limit \ncredit outstanding to \u201cdiscouraged\u201d activities including property, \nmarketable\u00a0securities, and consumer credit to 16% of total lending. The \noverall portion of credit to discouraged activities was estimated at 11.3% at \nend-2011.\n\nThe government stabilized the dong exchange rate through monetary \n\ntightening, coupled with a large one-step devaluation in February \n2011 and administrative measures such as caps on US dollar deposit \ninterest rates and restrictions on the use of gold and foreign currency. \nStill, over the year, the dong depreciated by 10% against the US dollar \n(Figure\u00a03.31.4).\n\nFiscal tightening involved cuts in expenditures, mainly capital works, \n\nand gains in revenue. The government raised operating expenditure on \neducation, health, and social security, but total spending, both on-budget \nand off-budget, is estimated to have declined in real terms last year. \nHigh prices for domestically produced oil contributed to the increase in \nrevenue, as did the impact of inflation and exchange-rate movements. As \na result, the budget deficit narrowed to 4.4% of GDP, from 5.6% in 2010 \n(Figure\u00a03.31.5). Using an international fiscal definition, the deficit was \nestimated at 4.0% of GDP. \n\nWith robust exports, the government met its objective of greatly \nshrinking the trade deficit in 2011. Merchandise exports (up by 34% on a \nbalance-of-payments basis) and imports (up by 26%) each totaled about \n$97\u00a0billion. High oil prices propelled exports of crude oil by 46% (using\ncustoms data) and exports of agricultural products by 30%. Shipments \nof manufactured goods rose by 35%, shielded from the impact of the \nglobal downturn because they are mainly low-value added manufactures. \nCurrency depreciation buffered exports from rising domestic costs.\n\nImports decelerated owing to lower demand for raw materials and \n\nother production inputs for export industries, the cooling of private \nconsumption, and currency depreciation. Also, the government restricted \nimports of some consumer goods.\n\n%\n\n64\n\n48\n\n32\n\n16\n\n0\n\nDong/$\n15,000\n\n17,500\n\n20,000\n\n22,500\n\n31 Mar\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n3.31.3  Credit growth and lending rate \nGrowth of credit\nto the economy\nAverage lending rate\n\nCredit, net increase\n\nDong trillion\n\n240\n\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n11\n\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; Ho Chi Minh Securities \nCorporation.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.31.4  Exchange rates\n\nReference rate of the State Bank of Viet Nam\nUpper bound of the trading band\nLower bound of the trading band\nBlack market exchange rate\n\n1 Jan\n09\n\n1 Jan\n2008 \nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; ADB observations.\nClick here for figure data\n\n1 Jan\n \n12\n\n1 Jan\n11\n\n1 Jan\n10\n\n3.31.5  Fiscal balance \n\nGovernment definition \n\nInternational definition\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nEstimate\n\nNote: International definition includes off-budget spending \nand onlending, but excludes principal debt repayments \nand revenue and expenditure carried forward.

That reflected the smaller trade deficit and a \n10% increase in remittances (to about $8.7\u00a0billion). Portfolio investment\ninflows were below 2010 levels at an estimated $1.4\u00a0billion (the VN index\nof share prices dropped by 27% in 2011) and foreign direct investment was \nslightly lower at about $6.5\u00a0billion.\n\nThese capital inflows contributed to a rebuilding of international \nreserves by an estimated $1.4\u00a0billion to $13.8\u00a0billion in 2011. Favorable\nforeign exchange market conditions in the first quarter of 2012 enabled \nthe SBV to further increase reserves, to an estimated $16.8\u00a0billion,\nequivalent to about 2\u00a0months of import cover (Figure\u00a03.31.6).\n\nMonetary tightening led to liquidity stress in some banks last year. \nThree small banks facing liquidity problems merged in December 2011 \nunder the supervision of the SBV, which provided liquidity support to the \nmerged entity and instructed a state-owned commercial bank to provide \nit with credit.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe government, attempting to expand the economy while bringing \ndown high inflation, targets a modest acceleration in GDP growth in \n2012 (to 6.0\u20136.5%) and much lower inflation (under 10%). Fiscal and \nmonetary statements suggest some easing in policy settings. The budget \nindicates that on-budget public spending could rise by about 6% in real \nterms (compared with a decline in 2011) and the fiscal deficit target in \n2012 is widened slightly from last year to 4.8% of GDP.\n\nThe SBV is targeting credit growth of 15\u201317% in 2012, slightly faster \n\nthan 14.3% recorded in 2011, and the goal for growth in M2 money \nsupply is 14\u201316%, up from last year\u2019s outcome of 12.1%. The authorities \nhave directed banks to continue to limit lending for property, securities, \nand consumer credit to 16% of loan portfolios.\n\nCredit growth ceilings this year are bank-specific, depending on \na range of financial soundness indicators. Weaker banks have a lower \nceiling for credit growth than others. Strong banks with higher credit \ngrowth ceilings hold an estimated 90% of total banking assets.\n\nIn March 2012, the SBV responded to the gradual easing of inflation \nby lowering the refinancing, discount, and repo rates by 100 basis points \n(Figure\u00a03.31.7) and reducing the ceiling on dong deposit rates from 14.0% \nto 13.0%. The monetary authorities indicated that further easing depends \non inflation trending down toward the target (and the forecasts below \nassume this will be the case).\n\nThe SBV introduced central bank bills of 1\u20136-month terms to \nimprove liquidity management, and used these securities to sterilize \nbank reserves created by foreign exchange purchases.\n\nPreliminary data indicate that GDP grew by 4.0% in the first quarter \n\nof 2012, decelerating from 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Industrial \nproduction increased by 4.1% year on year. Credit contracted by 2.5% \nduring the first 2\u00a0months of this year. In further signs of sluggish \neconomic activity, merchandise imports grew by 7% in the first quarter.\nPrivate consumption in 2012 will get support from easing inflation. \n\nInvestment will likely remain subdued, given uncertainties about \n\n3.31.6  Gross international reserves\n\nLevel\n\n$ billion\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n Q4\n2008\n\n Q2\n09\n\n Q4 \n\n Q4\n\n Q4\n\n Q2\n10\n\n Q2\n11\n\nNotes: Data exclude government foreign exchange deposits \nat the State Bank of Viet Nam and the foreign exchange \ncounterpart of swap operations.

Growth in exports will slow from 2011, owing \nto weaker world trade, although Viet Nam should benefit from the \nexpected gradual pickup in the United States, its biggest export market. \nOn the balance of these factors, GDP is forecast to grow by 5.7% \nin 2012 (Figure\u00a03.31.8). Growth is expected to pick up to 6.2% in 2013, \nowing to the improved global outlook for trade and investment and \nlikelihood of easier monetary policy next year.\n\nInflation is forecast to trend down this year, reflecting the policy \n\ntightening and high base set for the consumer price index in 2011. \nFood price inflation is abating. Weather conditions for agriculture \nwere generally favorable in the first quarter of 2012 and global food \nprices are projected to ease this year. However, the government raised \nadministered fuel prices by 3\u201312% in March. Average inflation this \nyear could ease to just under double digits, provided policy settings \nare kept sufficiently firm. (Core inflation, which excludes food and \nenergy, will be more persistent, though.) Year average inflation in 2013 \nis seen quickening to 11.5%, in tandem with economic growth and \non expectations of higher global food prices and hikes in domestic \nelectricity and fuel costs.\n\nThe current account is forecast to record a deficit equivalent to 1.5% \n\nof GDP in 2012 and 2.2% in 2013, largely due to subdued exports.\n\nThis outlook would be at risk if the government were to ease policies \n\nat a pace unsettling the foreign exchange market. Real savings of dong \ndepositors have been eroded by negative interest rates over a prolonged \nperiod. The cumulative \u201cerrors and omissions\u201d in the balance of \npayments, estimated at $18\u00a0billion in 2009-2011 (Figure\u00a03.31.9), reflects\nlarge volumes of foreign currency and gold outside the banking system.\n\nLowering interest rates too quickly could put the dong under \n\nrenewed pressure. This would undermine macroeconomic stabilization \nefforts, erode investor and consumer confidence, and undermine \nforeign reserves. Vulnerabilities in the banking system also pose a \nrisk. Business confidence and the financial system would be shaken if \nproblems at small banks were to spread.\n\nWhile foreign reserves have been rebuilt, they are still low, making \nthe economy vulnerable to external shocks. On the fiscal side, the costs \nof recapitalizing banks, restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs), \nand raising civil service wages to compensate for rapid inflation puts at \nrisk public capital spending. The ratio of current to capital expenditure \nincreased significantly last year. Additionally, an increasing proportion \nof government spending is being channeled off budget (Figure\u00a03.31.10), \nraising public financial management risks.\n\nThe authorities will need to accelerate reforms of SOEs if they are \nto raise the efficiency of this large sector of the economy, a prerequisite \nfor lifting average GDP growth to 7\u20138%, the target of the Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Strategy 2011-2020. Reform efforts so far have focused on \nsmall to medium-sized SOEs. The government has committed to draw \nup restructuring plans for 21 large state groups to make them more \ncommercially oriented. It wants to reduce by about half the number \nof SOEs to 690 by 2015, and then to 200 by 2020, through full or part \nprivatization.\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n% of GDP\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n3.31.8  GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.31.9  Balance-of-payments indicators\n\nOverall balance\nCurrent account balance\nCapital account balance\nErrors and omissions\n\n2009\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.31.10  Expenditure indicators\n\nCurrent expenditure\nratio to capital \nexpenditure\n\nOff-budget expenditure\nratio to total \nexpenditure \n\n%\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2003\n\n04\n\n05\n\n06\n\n07\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nEstimate\nNote: At end-March 2012, the government had yet to \nfinalize fiscal accounts for 2010.\nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nViet Nam    227\n\nConcerned about SOEs expanding into areas unrelated to their \ncore businesses, the government has banned them from making such \ninvestments. Increased transparency of the financial performance of \nstate enterprises would provide a strong signal to the market that the \ngovernment was committed to reforms.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014financial sector restructuring\nRapid growth in lending over several\u00a0years, followed by the squeeze on \ncredit in 2011 and exacerbated by downturns in property and equities \nmarkets, have added to stresses for banks. The ratio of nonperforming \nloans to total loans increased to an estimated 3.4% (Figure\u00a03.31.11), \nalthough it would be much higher under international accounting \nstandards. This rising ratio and the risk profile of some bank balance \nsheets, particularly those with exposure to unprofitable\u00a0and overstretched \nSOEs, raises questions about capital adequacy, particularly for \nsmall banks. The dangers are compounded by shortcomings in risk \nmanagement at banks and deficiencies in the regulatory and supervisory \nframework.\n\nA 16% increase in US dollar borrowing in 2011 heightened foreign \nexchange risk for banks. This year, the SBV has increased surveillance of \nforeign currency lending. From May 2012, it will restrict foreign currency \nlending only to firms engaged in export and import activity; it will also \nreduce limits on banks\u2019 foreign exchange positions.\n\nUncertainty over the financial health of banks has unsettled \n\ninvestors and hampered interbank market operations. A Financial Sector \nAssessment Program, to be conducted by the International Monetary \nFund and World Bank at the request of the Vietnamese authorities, \nsuggests they intend to address weaknesses in the banking system. The \nassessment, expected in the first half of 2013, will give recommendations \nfor financial sector restructuring.\n\nIn March 2012, the government outlined a plan that includes injecting \n\ncapital into banks and encouraging strong banks to acquire weaker \nones. Officials said part-privatization of state-owned commercial banks \nwill be accelerated and bank capital requirements raised. Funding and \ntiming of the bank recapitalization have not been disclosed in detail. \nThe government wants to see, over the next few years, one or two state-\nowned commercial banks well placed to compete against other banks in \nSoutheast Asia.\n\nSafeguarding the banking sector is the immediate priority. The longer-\nterm requirement is to develop a diversified and efficient financial system \nthat can mobilize funding to meet the 7\u20138% economic growth target. \nThe government has already this year approved a plan to revamp \nthe securities market. It covers development of the government and \ncorporate bond markets, a restructuring of the two stock exchanges as \nwell as securities firms, and an improved payment and settlement system \nfor securities. Under the plan, policies are to be formulated to encourage \nmore domestic and foreign investors in securities. \n\nThese complex reforms, which will take years to complete, would \n\nbenefit from coordination with the proposed restructuring of SOEs.\n\n3.31.11  Nonperforming loans\n\nProperty price\n$ per square meter\n\nNonperforming loans\n\n% of bank loans\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1,800\n\n1,650\n\n1,500\n\n1,350\n\n1,200\n\n11\n\n10\n\n2008\n\n09\nNote: Property price is the average price of high and \nmedium-priced condominiums.\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam; CB Richard Ellis; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fThe Pacific\nFiji\nPapua New Guinea\nTimor-Leste\n\nCook Islands\nKiribati\nMarshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nNauru\nPalau\nSamoa\nSolomon Islands\nTonga\nTuvalu\nVanuatu\n\n\fFiji\n\nThe  country  continues  with  weak  economic  growth,  held  back  by  policy  uncertainty  and  structural \nconstraints,  which  have  contributed  to  low  levels  of  private  investment.

Public  expenditure  is  limited  by  high  levels  of \ndebt  and,  longer  term,  structural  reforms  are  essential  for  the  economy  to  achieve  its  growth  potential. \n\nEconomic performance \nIn 2011, the economy grew by 2.1% after 2\u00a0years of contraction. The \nimprovement reflects recovery in agriculture, which had been affected \nby cyclone damage in 2010. It also reflects an increase in tourist arrivals \nof 6.8% (Figure\u00a03.32.1). Offsetting these gains, gold output fell by 22% as \ncapital works reduced output from the key Vatukoula mine. Electricity \nproduction was also down more than 4%, because consumption was \nconstrained by higher electricity prices.\n\nExports (through higher earnings from reexports, sugar, gold, \nmolasses, and timber) rose by 26.5% in 2011, while merchandise imports \n(largely machinery and transport equipment, food, and mineral fuels) \nclimbed by 16.3%.\n\nInflation reached double digits in midyear but averaged 8.7% for \nthe year, up from 7.8% in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.32.2). This reflected higher fuel \nand food prices, an increase in value-added tax, and steeper electricity \nprices.\n\nThe budget deficit was equivalent to 3.5% of GDP in 2011, up from 2.1% \n\nof GDP in 2010. Tax revenue exceeded budget estimates with growth in \ncollections from value-added, hotel turnover, and water resource taxes. \nTotal revenue fell below budget estimates, however, on delays in selling \ngovernment assets. Expenditure was slightly lower than expected because \nof underspending on the operating and capital budgets. \n\nGovernment expenditure in 2011 was dominated by current spending, \n\nwhich accounted for 86% of budget outlays. The wage bill remained at \naround 40% of total public spending, or nearly half current outlays. In \nrecent\u00a0years the government has increased spending on infrastructure. \nCapital investment has risen from 9% of total public spending (3.5% of \nGDP) in 2007 to an average of 14% of total public spending (5.2% of GDP) \nin 2008\u20132011.\n\nMonetary growth was 16.5% in 2011. This reflected a $250\u00a0million\nforeign bond issue by the government in March 2011 and resulting influx \nof foreign exchange, as well as higher foreign exchange earnings and weak \nimport growth.\n\nThis chapter was written by Laisiasa Tora of the South Pacific Subregional Office, ADB, \nSuva.\n\n3.32.1  Visitor arrivals\n\nPersons\n\nThousands\n750\n\n500\n\n250\n\n0\n\n-250\n\nGrowth\n\n%\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n2007\n\n08\nSources: Reserve Bank of Fiji; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n3.32.2  Quarterly inflation\n\nOverall\n\nFood \n\nTransport \n\nUtilities \n%\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2008\n\nQ1\n09\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n10\n\nQ1\n11\n\nQ4\n\nSource: Reserve Bank of Fiji.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f230    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nSince 2008, Fiji\u2019s financial markets have had excess liquidity but, \ndespite monetary-policy easing, domestic credit growth has continued \nto slow, rising by just 10% in the 4\u00a0years to end-2011. After holding \nsteady for 6\u00a0months, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) cut its policy rate in \nOctober 2011 by 100 basis points, to 0.5%. Although lending to the private \nsector subsequently rose, the RBF is concerned that small and medium-\nsized enterprises are being excluded. It has, therefore, introduced a loan \nguarantee scheme, among other measures, to encourage such lending. \n\nFiji\u2019s index for the real effective exchange rate rose on an annual basis \nby 5.2% in 2011 due to comparatively high domestic prices. This indicates \na loss in international competitiveness against major trading partners, as \nwell as an erosion of the benefits from devaluation in 2009. \n\nThe current account deficit widened marginally to 11.2% of GDP in \n2011, from 11.0% the previous year. The surplus in the capital and financial \naccounts declined following repayment of a $150\u00a0million global bond,\nissued in 2006, using part of its March 2011 bond issue. As of end-2011, \nofficial foreign exchange reserves reached $856\u00a0million, equivalent to\naround 5\u00a0months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe Asian Development Bank projects GDP growth of 1.0% in 2012 \nand 1.2% in 2013 (Figure\u00a03.32.3)\u2014lower than government expectations\u2014\nreflecting its assessment of likely weak global demand, slow growth in \nbank lending, low levels of private investment, and the effects of the \nfloods in early 2012. \n\nConstruction and investments in mining could support modest \ngrowth. For example, investment to date for the Namosi copper mine \nhas been about 2.2% of GDP, or $86.2\u00a0million. The impact of further\ninvestment on growth is likely to be muted, however, as equipment will \nbe imported.\n\nThe government foresees a budget deficit of 1.9% of GDP for \n2012, based largely on expectations of improvements in the economy \n(Figure\u00a03.32.4). Revenue is forecast at $1.1\u00a0billion, 12.7% higher than in\n2011. Corporate and personal income tax cuts are expected to boost \nspending and investment. Tax revenue will be supplemented by the \nconversion of the 5% hotel turnover tax to a service turnover tax \napplying to most tourism-related services. This is expected to generate \n$32.6\u00a0million in revenue in 2012. Other measures include increases in the\nairport departure tax, higher excise taxes, and new levies, including voice \ncall charges and credit card fees. \n\nGovernment expenditure is estimated at $1.2\u00a0billion in 2012, up by\n5.9% from 2011. Operating spending, which makes up 70% of the total \n(around $840\u00a0million) is projected to be 5% higher. Capital expenditure\n(around $320\u00a0million) is projected to rise by 7.1%. Key features of the 2012\nspending program include a 3% salary increase for civil servants and \nan increase of $36.6\u00a0million (or 7.0%) in the infrastructure development\nbudget allocation, to be financed largely by the export-import banks of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and of Malaysia.

However, this \nwill still exceed the government\u2019s target of 40%. \n\nCrucially, if these targets are not achieved, the fiscal position could \ndeteriorate. This would affect the provision of essential public services \nand increase public debt. There would be little scope for further fiscal \nexpansion.\n\nAt end-March 2012, the RBF left its policy rate at 0.5% in light of \ncontinuing uncertainty in the eurozone and the need to support domestic \ninvestment activity. In February, it required commercial banks to set \naside 4% and 2% of their deposits for loans for the agriculture and \nrenewable energy sectors, respectively. It is important that this measure is \nclosely monitored to prevent a rise in nonperforming loans.\n\nAverage annual inflation is projected to decline to 5.1% in 2012 \n(Figure\u00a03.32.5). This forecast stems from the weak growth outlook, \nprojected declines in international food prices, and dissipation of \none-time price adjustments from last year.\n\nThe current account deficit is projected to narrow to 9.6% of GDP in \n2012 (Figure\u00a03.32.6), despite lower sugar production, primarily because of \nlower prices of imported commodities. Foreign reserves are expected to \nremain above the targeted 3\u20134\u00a0months of imports in 2012.\n\nPolicy challenge highlights \nFiji has experienced low economic growth, rising emigration, and high \npoverty over the past decade, mainly because of low domestic investment. \nPrivate investment is low, there has been little new domestic lending, and \npublic investment has been constrained by poor implementation. Since \n2005, gross domestic investment has averaged 13.1% of GDP a year, well \nbelow the government\u2019s target of 25%. The ratio of private investment to \nGDP declined from an average of 11.3% in 2000\u20132005 to 7.5% in 2006\u2013\n2010; in 2011 it was around 2%.\n\nThe government recognizes that the economy operates below its \n\ngrowth potential because of an array of difficult macroeconomic, \nstructural, and sector policy constraints. State-owned enterprise reform \nis progressing, and the government is seeking to divest its holdings in \nseveral enterprises. Yet the pace of reform is constrained by fiscal limits, \na lack of technical capacity, limited stakeholder buy-in and consultation, \nand inconsistencies in the way reform principles are applied. The \nmedium-term macroeconomic outlook is weak and foreshadows greater \npoverty challenges\u2014unless structural reforms are carried out in a \ncoherent and coordinated manner. \n\nBusiness confidence is unlikely to be restored until progress is made \non political reform. The drafting of a new constitution this year and the \nholding of national elections in 2014 will be crucial in this respect. \n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nHigh  international  commodity  prices  boosted  economic  growth  in  2011.  Restrained  expenditure \ngrowth  allowed  the  government  to  accumulate  public  trust  fund  savings.  GDP  growth  will  remain \nhigh in 2012 as construction of a large resource project reaches its peak. The following year, economic \npressures  will  emerge  as  construction  of  that  project  winds  down  and  government  revenues  from \nexisting  mining  operations  decline.  A  major  challenge  is  to  ensure  that  the  poor  benefit  from  the \ncountry\u2019s  higher  income.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy continued its strong performance in 2011, with GDP \ngrowth of 8.9% marking a decade of uninterrupted expansion. Industry \nmade the largest contribution to growth owing to resource investments, \nincluding the construction of a $16\u00a0billion liquefied natural gas (LNG)\nproject and high government spending that boosted demand in the sector \n(Figure\u00a03.33.1). Construction was also supported by property developments \nas investors responded to very high rental demand in urban centers.\nThe contribution of industry to overall growth was partly offset \nby the mining and oil sector, which contracted by 8.7% as a result of \ndeclining output from maturing mining and oil operations. Agricultural \noutput rose by 4.5% as producers responded to higher commodity and \nfood prices.\n\nStrong economic growth continued to create income-earning \n\nopportunities. The Central Bank Business Liaison Survey showed a 7.1% \nincrease in formal employment in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe deficit on the current account of the balance of payments widened \n\nto 36.8% of GDP in 2011. Higher commodity prices raised the US dollar \nvalue of merchandise exports by 27.8%. Mineral exports climbed by 17%, \nas rising copper and gold sales more than offset an 11% decline in oil \nrevenue. The value of agricultural exports, which make up roughly a \nquarter of export revenue, rose by about 51% in 2011, primarily as a result \nof 63% growth in palm oil exports, an 88% jump in coffee sales, and a \n100% surge in marine products.\n\nIncreased exports were, however, outweighed by a rise in imports, \n\nparticularly those related to construction of resource projects. Yet \nbecause resource-project imports are financed mainly through foreign \ndirect investment, the large current account deficit does not jeopardize \nexternal stability. High foreign exchange reserves held by the central \nbank, which totaled 15\u00a0months of nonmineral import cover in 2011 \n(reaching 18\u00a0months in October), also support external stability \n(Figure\u00a03.33.2).\n\nThis chapter was written by Aaron Batten of the Papua New Guinea Resident Mission, \nADB, Port Moresby.\n\n3.33.1  Contributions to growth (supply)\n\nGDP\n\nAgriculture\n\nIndustry\n\nServices\n\n8.9\n\n7.2\n\n7.4\n\n6.0\n\nPercentage points\n\n8.9\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Department of Treasury. 2012 National Budget. \nVolume 1.

Adjusting official numbers for net trust fund \ndeposits, though, gives an effective budget surplus equal to 2% of GDP. \nThis difference arises owing to the government\u2019s classification of trust \nfund deposits as spending, while international government accounting \nstandards treat them as savings.\n\nStrong growth and high commodity prices took domestic \n\nrevenue collection 6.6% above projections (Figure\u00a03.33.4). A midyear \nsupplementary budget allocated an extra $359.6\u00a0million in expenditure to\ninfrastructure, health centers, and prefunding for a new commitment to \nachieve universal primary and secondary education.\n\nHigh levels of government expenditure, large resource investments, \nand rising international food prices spurred inflation in the first half of \n2011, with the consumer price index increasing year on year by 9.6% at \nend-June 2011. Price increases slowed in the second half, mainly reflecting \nstrong exchange rate appreciation.\n\nAlso supporting moderating price growth was monetary intervention: \n\nthe central bank issued a net $0.6\u00a0billion in central bank bills, raised the\npolicy interest rate (the kina facility rate) by 75\u00a0basis points to 7.75%, and \nlifted the capital-adequacy requirement for banks from 4.0% to 6.0%.\n\nA significant policy development in 2011 was the announcement of \na new sovereign wealth fund to manage all future mineral revenue. The \nfund aims to encourage stable\u00a0and sustainable increases in government \nexpenditure by establishing a maximum drawdown rule and channeling \nall mineral funds through the budget. The fund also aims to protect local \nexport industries by investing unspent mineral revenue in offshore assets.\nOne challenge, however, is that the proposed new agencies that will \nuse mineral revenue to finance infrastructure and state-owned enterprise \ninvestments have the potential to replicate existing government structures \nand complicate public financial management.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is seen moderating to 7.5% in 2012 and more sharply to 4.5% in \n2013 (Figure\u00a03.33.5). This year growth will be supported by higher prices \nfor the country\u2019s key export commodities, heavy government spending, \nand rising domestic employment, at the same time as the LNG project\u2019s \nconstruction phase reaches its peak. Growth will also be supported by \na 20% expansion of the mineral sector as production starts at the Ramu \nnickel and cobalt mine, although this will be partly offset by a 9.9% \nreduction in oil production.\n\nThe slowdown in 2013 will stem from the winding down of LNG \n\nproject construction, which will hit demand in a range of sectors, \nincluding construction itself, transport, and aviation. This effect will spill \nover into the wholesale and retail sectors. Adding to this shock will be \nfurther declines in oil production, which is predicted to contract by 17% \nin 2013.\n\nInflation is expected to remain high in 2012 (Figure\u00a03.33.6). Record \n\npublic and private investment will leave many areas of the economy, \nincluding construction, shipping, and port facilities, operating at close \nto full capacity. Offsetting these pressures is the kina exchange rate, \n\n3.33.3  Budget balance\n\nOfficial\n\nAdjusted for trust funds\n\n08\n\n10\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: Department of Treasury. 2012 National Budget. \nVolume 1.

On balance, price growth in 2012 is expected to \nease slightly to 7.0% and to 6.0% in 2013 as the economy slows further and \nLNG-related construction activity declines.\n\nIn the external accounts, resource-project imports will maintain a \nlarge current account deficit, of around 33.2% of GDP in 2012 and 29.7% in \n2013 (Figure\u00a03.33.7). Foreign direct investment will continue to finance this \ngap. Foreign reserves are expected to remain adequate in terms of import \ncover over the forecast period.\n\nThe 2012 budget targets a balanced position, with an expected \n9.5% increase in domestic revenue collection. As in previous\u00a0years, the \nbudget excludes net trust fund expenditure. Pressure to draw on these \naccumulated savings will be raised in the lead-up to national elections \nin mid-2012. Given existing capacity constraints, any large trust-fund \ndrawdowns would add to inflationary pressures and crowd out private \nsector activity.\n\nFiscal stress will mount in 2013 as revenues from maturing mining \nand oil operations continue to decline. Combined with slowing growth, \nthis is expected to begin a 2-year period of stagnant revenue collection, \nuntil LNG revenue begins in 2015.\n\nLow public debt\u2014about 24% of GDP in 2011\u2014will enable measured \ngovernment borrowing to maintain expenditure without compromising \nmacroeconomic stability, although public finances face some risks, and \na decline in international commodity prices would be painful. Revenue \nprojections in the 2012 budget are predicated on an optimistic outlook for \ncommodities: cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, and tea prices are expected \nto moderate only slightly but remain near record highs, while prices of \ncopra, copra oil, and copper are all expected to rise. The price of gold in \nparticular, which makes up almost half of export earnings, is forecast to \nbe 20% higher in 2012 than in 2011. \n\nIf commodity prices decline significantly this year, the government \n\nwill face pressures to meet expenditure commitments without \nundermining the fiscal discipline that has underpinned the last decade of \nmacroeconomic stability.\n\nAnother risk to the economic outlook is the government\u2019s growing \n\noff-balance sheet contingent liabilities related to resource-project \nguarantees and unfunded superannuation liabilities, now totaling 32% \nof GDP. Of particular concern is the potential for unresolved landowner \ncompensation issues to delay LNG project construction, which may result \nin the government being obliged to meet its project-completion guarantees.\nOn the upside, medium-term projections do not incorporate some \npotential new mining investments, including extending the lifespan of the \nOk Tedi mine and a second LNG project.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014tackling inequalities\nThe last decade of economic growth has led to rising inequalities. \nMineral exports and resource-project construction have underpinned a \n30% increase in real per capita incomes from $1,398 in 2002 to $1,850 in\n2011.

A lack of \nsocioeconomic data makes tracking performance difficult, but anecdotal \nevidence suggests that, despite a 120% increase in government expenditure \nsince 2002, the quality of service delivery has remained stagnant and in \nsome cases even declined, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe effects of growth on employment creation are also restricted by \nthe business environment. The country ranked 101 out of 183 countries \non the World Bank\u2019s 2012 Doing Business survey, the lowest in the \nSouth Pacific and well behind regional partners in Southeast Asia. So, \ndespite some growth in recent\u00a0years, the formal private sector remains \nsmall, employing less than 10% of the economically active population \n(Figure\u00a03.33.8) and concentrated in just a few industries such as mining \nand agriculture.\n\nHigh inflation has also undermined the inclusiveness of growth. \nAlthough wage earners can negotiate higher wages when costs rise, \nthe roughly 85% of the population reliant on cash crops for their semi-\nsubsistence livelihoods have seen their purchasing power deteriorate \nrapidly in recent\u00a0years. Further, structural constraints in land and \nhousing markets have restricted the supply response to rising property \ndemand, and contributed to rising rental prices. As a result, an increasing \nportion of urban residents are now forced to live in informal urban \nsettlements, which have poor access to power and sanitation facilities and \nwhich pose significant personal security risks.\n\nInequality is also growing in villages, reflecting rising compensation \npayments to incorporated landowner groups made by mining companies \nfor use of land. With low educational and financial literacy levels, \nmembers of these groups can rarely hold leaders to account for the \nequitable\u00a0distribution of royalty payments.\n\nThe government will have a major opportunity to improve living \nstandards when revenue starts to flow to the budget from LNG exports. \nInclusive growth will, however, require substantial reforms to public \nfinancial management to ensure that higher expenditure improves \nservice delivery.

Inflation  climbed  sharply,  and  is  expected  to  remain  internationally  high  in  2012  and \n2013. The key economic challenge is to move from an economy driven by public sector activity to one in \nwhich  the  private  sector  plays  a  key  role.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy\u2019s strong growth performance continued in 2011, with GDP, \nexcluding the offshore petroleum sector and the United Nations (the \nmeasure of GDP used hereafter), expanding by 10.0%. The spending of \npetroleum revenue continued to drive the economy. Although the full \n2011 budget allocation was not spent, government expenditure, including \ndevelopment partner\u2013funded activities, reached $1.4\u00a0billion. This was an\nincrease of 36.4% from 2010, and saw the ratio of government expenditure \nto GDP reach 185.5% in 2011.\n\nThe government\u2019s capital spending more than doubled in 2011 \n\n(Figure\u00a03.34.1), while recurrent expenditure rose by only 2.2%. Expenditure \non wages and salaries rose by 22.6% in 2011 to $112 million, primarily\nbecause a large number of temporary civil service positions were converted \nto permanent positions during the year (Figure\u00a03.34.2). This moved \nexpenditure out of goods and services and this category was therefore \nbelow both the budgeted level and the outturn for 2010. Overall, 88.3% of \nthe budget was spent in 2011, a similar ratio to the previous 2\u00a0years.\nThe national electrification program begun in 2008 accounted \nfor most of the capital spending in 2011. Around half the total cost of \n$0.9\u00a0billion was spent during the year. The program will provide two new\npower stations and a new transmission system, and will greatly extend the \ndistribution system. The first major milestone was met in late 2011, when \nthe first power station entered operation.\n\nA large budget surplus was again recorded. The steep rise in the world \n\noil price boosted petroleum revenue to a new high of $3.5\u00a0billion over\nthe year, dwarfing the $0.1\u00a0billion raised domestically. The overall budget\nsurplus of $2.5\u00a0billion was more than three times GDP. Public savings\nof $2.5\u00a0billion boosted the balance in the Petroleum Fund to $9.3\u00a0billion,\naround 12\u00a0times GDP.\n\nAverage annual inflation was 13.1%. Inflation rose rapidly in the \nfirst quarter of 2011 as higher world oil and food prices fed through \nthe economy. Other contributing factors to the first quarter rise were a \nreduction in rice subsidies, and disruption to the harvest cycle because of \nexcessive rain in 2010. There was little additional inflation in the second \n\nThis chapter was written by Craig Sugden of the Special Office in Timor-Leste, ADB, Dili.\n\n3.34.1  Recurrent and capital expenditure\nRecurrent\n\nCapital\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: ADB estimates based on Timor-Leste National \nStatistics Directorate.

But in the final \nquarter, year-on-year inflation reached 15.4%.\n\nIncreased demand in the lead-up to end-of-year celebrations and \nthe loss of capacity at the international port in Dili from October as \nnew navy vessels occupied one of three berths were the key contributors \nto the fourth quarter jump in inflation (Figure\u00a03.34.3). This jump was \ndespite the deflationary effects of some easing in world food prices and an \nappreciation of the United States dollar (which is used by Timor-Leste as \nits official currency) against key currencies.\n\nAfter 5\u00a0years of almost no change, lending levels rose by 18.5% in 2011 \n\n(Figure\u00a03.34.4), helped by a shift in lending policy at one of the larger \ncommercial banks toward more risk sharing. The July inauguration of the \ncountry\u2019s fourth commercial bank and the first locally owned bank, the \nBanco Nacional Com\u00e9rcio de Timor-Leste, also contributed to the rise \nin lending. Deposits with the banking system increased by 6.0% in 2011, \nwhile the broad money measure of money supply expanded by 9.3%.\n\nThe data show a large increase in imports during 2011, consistent with \n\nthe high import content of heavy government expenditure. Merchandise \nimports were almost double the previous year\u2019s. Nonpetroleum \nmerchandise exports, predominately coffee, declined by 18.5% and \nremained a small fraction of merchandise imports. The surplus on the \nincome account attributable\u00a0to petroleum revenue continued to outweigh \nthe wide trade deficit in 2011, providing for a large current account \nsurplus of more than three times GDP.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe continuing rise in government spending is projected to see the \neconomy stay strong. But the rate of economic growth is expected to ease, \nfrom around 10.0% in 2012 to 8.0% in 2013, as the rate of fiscal expansion \nbegins to moderate (Figure\u00a03.34.5). Government expenditure is projected \nto expand by 25.7% in 2012, but by only 10.3% in 2013.\n\nInflation is seen remaining high in the first half of 2012. The \n\ntemporary loss of capacity at Dili port, and extra demand arising from \npreparations for the Parliamentary elections due midyear, are expected \nto maintain upward pressure on prices. Inflationary pressures are \nexpected to decline over the second half of 2012 as these effects pass, \nand as the departure of the United Nations mission (to be completed by \n30\u00a0December) helps slow the expansion in aggregate demand. Inflation is \nprojected to average 10.2% in 2012 before declining to 7.4% in 2013.\nThe budget for 2012 provides for a further large increase in \n\ngovernment expenditure to $1.8\u00a0billion, of which $1.6\u00a0billion will be from \nthe Petroleum Fund and domestic revenue, with the remainder from \ndevelopment partners. The ratio of expenditure to GDP is projected to \nremain close to 200% in 2012.\n\nBig-ticket capital expenditure items funded from the multiyear \n\nInfrastructure Fund are again prominent in the budget. Capital spending \nis budgeted to rise to 100% of GDP. Outlays on the national electrification \nprogram are tapering off, but will remain high at $280\u00a0million.

Road investments will be partly\nfunded by the government\u2019s first loans. A total of $150\u00a0million in loans\nfrom development partners is proposed to support a multiyear project to \nbegin upgrading the country\u2019s major roads.\n\nWorld oil prices are projected to remain around current levels in \n2012 and 2013, underpinning high petroleum revenue (Figure\u00a03.34.6) as \nwell as large budget and current account surpluses. These surpluses are \nprojected to remain close to 200% of GDP in 2012, before easing in 2013 \n(Figure\u00a03.34.7).\n\nLonger-term prospects for private sector development and the \neconomy more broadly have been strengthened by the early 2012 \ngovernment approval of a framework for public\u2013private partnerships. \nThe framework identifies the type of public infrastructure that may be \nconsidered for such partnerships, and how such projects will be evaluated, \nprovisioned, and managed. It is now important to bring forward the \nbest candidate projects to address looming infrastructure bottlenecks. \nPriorities are operating and maintaining the expanding electricity system, \nrehabilitating the only international airport, building a new international \nsea port, and upgrading the degraded water supply system in Dili.\n\nA large step forward was also taken through Parliament\u2019s approval \nin early 2012 of a land law that provides a framework for land ownership \nand resolution of conflicting claims. Complementary laws that allow the \nstate to acquire land for public purposes were also approved. These new \nlaws extend a legal process established in 2011 for registering land claims \nand confirming those that are undisputed (so far, 92% of 47,000 registered \nclaims have been undisputed). A Civil Code that came into force in \nMarch 2012 also includes a section governing day-to-day decisions \nsuch as the sale and lease of land. Such legal reforms are an essential \nunderpinning of private sector development because they provide greater \ncertainty over property rights.\n\nPolicy challenge highlights\nA key issue facing Timor-Leste is whether the economy should be slowed in \nan effort to reduce inflation. While some farmers have benefited from the \nboost to their income provided by higher food prices, many of the urban \npoor are suffering from the increased cost of living. Other policy responses \nalso warrant consideration. Notably, enhanced targeting of the government\u2019s \nsizable public social safety net, which received another large funding \nincrease in the 2012 budget, could help alleviate pressures on the poor. It is \nalso important to keep infrastructure investment high, as this is needed to \nalleviate supply bottlenecks and reduce the cost of local production.\n\nThe major economic challenge remains moving from an economy in \nwhich growth has been primarily dependent on public sector activity to \none in which the private sector plays a key role. The inaugural Business \nActivity Survey, covering 2010, has provided a reminder of the nascent \nstate of the private sector. The survey confirmed the concentration of the \nformal business sector in Dili\u2014more than 80% of employment and value-\nadded was earned by Dili-based businesses\u2014and its shallow structure\u2014the \nretail and wholesale, construction, and accommodation and food services \naccounted for about 60% of total employment and value added.\n\n3.34.1  Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2012\n\n10.0\n\n10.2\n\n229.4\n\n2013\n\n8.0\n\n7.4\n\n153.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent account balance \n\n(share of\u00a0GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.34.6  Petroleum accounts\n\nPetroleum revenue\nPetroleum Fund withdrawal\n\n2008\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: ADB estimates based on Timor-Leste National \nStatistics Directorate.

All  of  them  except \nTonga  expanded.  In  three,  the  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  5.0%  or  more  and  the \nSolomon  Islands\u2014at  9.3%\u2014was  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  developing  Asia.\n\nThe growth in tourism evident in 2010 continued in 2011, particularly in the Cook Islands, Palau, and Samoa, \nand the number of tourist arrivals hit records. Construction had an important influence on growth in many \nof  the  small  economies,  notably  the  Cook  Islands,  the  Marshall  Islands,  Samoa,  and  Vanuatu,  but  in  the \nFederated States of Micronesia a winding down of large public construction projects led to slower growth.\n\nThe  outlook  for  these  small  economies  is  positive.  Most  of  them  are  expected  to  have  faster  growth  in \n2012  than  in  2011.  The  main  exception  is  Solomon  Islands  where  growth  is  likely  to  decelerate  because \nof  a  decline  in  logging.  All  of  them  are  expected  to  continue  expanding  in  2013,  but  all\u2014apart  from \nVanuatu\u2014at  a  slower  pace  than  in  2012.\n\nStable\u00a0 oil  and  lower  food  prices  will  keep  inflation  generally  lower  in  2012  than  in  2011,  but  several \ncountries  will  have  higher  inflation  on  increased  domestic  demand  and  domestic  constraints.  In  2013,  \nmost  of  these  economies  face  the  prospect  of  slightly  higher  inflation,  because  food  prices  are  expected \nto  pick  up.\n\nImproving government fiscal management and public sector efficiency, as well as maintaining basic public \nservices  by  investing  in  vital  infrastructure,  are  priority  needs  to  support  sustained  growth  in  the  small \nPacific  countries.\n\nCook Islands\nAfter several\u00a0years of negative or slow growth, the Cook Islands recovered \nin FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0June 2011) with GDP growth of 3.4% (Figure\u00a03.35.1). \nThis reflected expansion in tourism and fisheries, as well as increased \nconstruction associated with upgrading of Avatiu port. Tourism accounts \nfor about two-thirds of GDP and an improved economic outlook in \nAustralia and New Zealand (the source of four-fifths of arrivals) helped \npush visitor arrivals to over 108,000 in FY2011, a new fiscal year high. \nDuring July\u2013December 2011, arrivals increased by 6.4% relative to the \nsame 6\u00a0months in 2010 (Figure\u00a03.35.2).\n\nIn FY2011, inflation slipped to 0.6% from 1.8% in FY2010, driven \nprimarily by declines in housing and household costs, such as rent and \nutilities.\n\nThis chapter was written by Christopher Edmonds, Emma Veve, Rommel Rabanal, and \nCara Tinio of the Pacific Department, ADB, Manila; Malie Lototele and Laisiasa Tora \nof the South Pacific Subregional Office, ADB, Suva; and Milovan Lucich of the Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office, ADB, Sydney.\n\n3.35.1  GDP growth, Cook Islands\n\n%\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance. 2011. 2012/13 Budget Policy \nStatement and 2011/12 Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update. \nDecember; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f240    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nGovernment operating revenue was 1.9% higher in FY2011 than in \nFY2010, primarily because of the increased receipts from tourism. With \noperating expenditure edging up by 0.1%, the fiscal deficit narrowed \nslightly to 1.4% of GDP.\n\nThe trade deficit widened to US$286\u00a0million in FY2011. The value of\nmerchandise imports increased by 7.7% but exports fell by 10.5%, largely \nowing to decreased pearl exports.\n\nThe economy is expected to grow at 5.4% in FY2012. This reflects \n\nincreased visitor arrivals, particularly from Australia on the new \nSydney\u2013Rarotonga direct flights that began in July 2011. The start of large \ninfrastructure works (roads, water, and energy) will help the expansion \ncontinue, with the economy projected to grow by 3.0% in FY2013.\n\nIn FY2012, government operating revenue is expected to increase by \n\n3.2%. Tax revenue is forecast to rise by about 6.6% because of growth \nin tourism and the introduction of a withholding tax. Government \noperating expenses are expected to rise by 3.1% in FY2012. A budget \ndeficit of 1.4% of GDP is forecast.\n\nThe government in 2011 carried out a functional review, which \n\nrecommended that it should focus on its core business and its regulatory \nand enabling roles. The government will take a phased approach to \nimplementing the recommendations for public sector reform, reflecting \ncapacity constraints. Although the review was silent on the appropriate \nsize of the public sector, it is an issue that the government will have to \naddress if it is to manage spending. \n\nKiribati\nThe economy grew by 3.0% in 2011 largely due to stronger retail activity. \nInflation was 7.7% (compared with deflation of 2.8% in 2010) because of \nincreased food and fuel prices (Figure\u00a03.35.3).\n\nGovernment revenue collection in 2011 was about 20% lower than \nin the previous year and 9% below budget estimates. This fall stemmed \nfrom a decline in the value of income from fishing licenses and a poor \nfishing season. (Licenses are paid in United States (US) dollars, which \ndepreciated against the Australian dollar, used by Kiribati as its currency.) \nExpenditure rose by about 10% because of increased spending on \ninfrastructure projects. \n\nThe fiscal deficit thus widened from 8.1% of GDP in 2010 to 17.7% in \n2011. The gap was partially funded by concessional borrowing, but also \nby a drawdown of capital from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund \n(RERF), a sovereign wealth fund, the earnings from which are intended \nto balance recurrent financing needs. \n\nGDP is projected to climb by 3.5% in 2012 with the start of major \n\ndevelopment partner\u2013funded infrastructure projects, such as road \nbuilding, as well as airport and seaport reconstruction. In 2013 growth is \nexpected to come off a little to 3.0% (Figure\u00a03.35.4). Over the next 2\u00a0years, \ninflation is projected to drop to 5.5% and then increase to 6.0%, reflecting \nexpected movements in international food prices.\n\nA new government took office in January 2012. Its first budget, which \n\nshould be presented in April, is likely to see a widening of the fiscal \ndeficit, reflecting a scheduled increase in infrastructure spending.

Reducing the annual demands on the fund to a level that \ncan be met from its income will require extensive fiscal consolidation. \nOver the medium term, the government should aim to stabilize the value \nof the RERF, by keeping budget deficits to 5\u20136% of GDP. Stronger control \nof expenditure on personnel costs is one option it could investigate. \n\nMarshall Islands\nEconomic growth slowed slightly to 5.0% in FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0September \n2011). This solid performance was supported by fishing activity, continued \nhigh spending related to US military operations under the Kwajalein Land \nUse Agreement, and the upgrade of the international airport in Majuro.\nInflation shot up to 9.5% (from 1.6% in FY2010). Steep rises in the \nprices of commodities (which have a weighting of nearly 50% in the \nconsumer price index), high transport costs arising from the country\u2019s \nremote location, and the pickup in domestic demand drove this increase.\nThe fiscal surplus fell from 4.6% of GDP in FY2010 to 1.4%. Although \n\ngrants declined, domestic revenue\u2014mainly from fishing license fees\u2014\nrose. Public expenditure climbed by 6.1%, reflecting, primarily, increased \npurchases of goods and services.\n\nThe current account remained in deficit (12.6% of GDP). Although \n\nmerchandise exports expanded by 26.5% to US$40.8\u00a0million, imports\nreached US$114.5\u00a0million.\n\nEconomic growth is foreseen to reach 5.4% in FY2012, boosted by \ncontinued growth in fisheries and airport-related construction, before \nslowing to 2.6% in FY2013 (Figure\u00a03.35.5). FY2013 is likely to see a fiscal \nsurplus of slightly over 1% of GDP. A projected step-up in grants will \nfinance about 70% of the budget and contribute to a 5.1% gain in total \nreceipts. Total government expenditure will rise by 5.7%, partly due to \ngreater subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\nInflation is projected to slow to 2.5% in FY2012 before accelerating \n\nto 3.0% in FY2013, in line with expected trends in global food prices \n(Figure\u00a03.35.6).\n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to widen to 30.3% of GDP in \n\nFY2012. Although merchandise exports will grow by 14.8%, imports are \nexpected to jump by 29.8% owing to continued demand from the airport \nupgrade and expansion of fisheries.\n\nThe country has to build up the Compact Trust Fund to prepare \nfor fiscal self-sufficiency once US Compact grants expire in 2023, while \npaying down the high government debt. It also needs to generate \nsustainable economic growth. Fiscal and structural reforms are needed to \nstimulate private sector economic activity, generate domestic employment \nand income, and broaden the local tax base. Tax reforms are required to \nincrease government revenue and offset planned reductions in grants. In \naddition, SOE reforms and cutbacks in public expenditure are needed to \nimprove the fiscal balance.\n\n3.35.5  GDP growth, Marshall Islands\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\nSources: Republic of Marshall Islands Fiscal Year 2010 \nEconomic Review. http://www.pitiviti.org; International \nMonetary Fund. 2011.

However, as some projects reached \ntheir final stages, growth fell from 3.1% to 1.4% (Figure\u00a03.35.7). Consumer \nspending appears to have recovered in FY2011, with the value of food \nimports from the US\u2014the country\u2019s largest trading partner\u2014increasing \nby about 8%.\n\nInflation rose to 7.9% in FY2011, due mainly to higher oil prices. The \n\nretail gasoline price was 30% higher in March 2011 than a year earlier.\nProgress in fiscal consolidation resulted in a small budget surplus, \nequivalent to about 0.4% of GDP in FY2011 (Figure\u00a03.35.8). This is the third \nyear of surplus following\u00a0years of earlier deficits. Capital expenditure was \ncut by about 13% after the completion of some public works projects, and \nthe reduction in government spending was about 2% for the year.\n\nThe modest pace of economic expansion is expected to moderate \nfurther to 1.0% in FY2012 as some infrastructure projects such as the \nPohnpei airport runway extension are finished. In FY2013, GDP growth \nis forecast to tail off to 0.5% as more projects are completed. Weak \nprivate activity and annual declines in grants under the Compact of Free \nAssociation with the US also contribute to a subdued growth outlook.\nInflation of 3.5% is projected for FY2012 as prices of internationally \ntraded commodities, other than oil, decline. In FY2013, inflation is expected \nto rise slightly to 4.0%, reflecting an assumed rise in global demand.\nSmall fiscal surpluses are projected for FY2012 and FY2013 but \nthese fall short of target levels. In order to achieve savings in the FSM \nCompact Trust Fund to generate sufficient income to replace annual \ncompact grants, which expire in FY2023, further fiscal consolidation is \nneeded. This might involve a reduction in the public sector wage bill \nand revenue-raising measures (i.e., tax reforms and improvements in tax \nadministration) to maintain fiscal surpluses over the long run. \n\nNauru\nThe economy grew by 4.0% in FY2011 (ending 30\u00a0June 2011) largely because \nphosphate exports increased by more than 20% (Figure\u00a03.35.9). The country \nhas been experiencing deflation for the last few\u00a0years and in FY2011 the \nconsumer price index declined by 3.5%, in part because of appreciation of \nthe Australian dollar (which Nauru uses as its official currency).\n\nGovernment revenue in FY2012 is expected to be A$31.6\u00a0million and\nexpenditure A$32.5\u00a0million, yielding a small deficit of A$0.9\u00a0million. Cash\nreserves brought forward from FY2011 will, however, result in a small \nsurplus.\n\nThe Australian Agency for International Development estimated \nthat in 2006 government debt obligations to external and internal debt \nholders were A$371.4\u00a0million, and A$264.8\u00a0million respectively, an\nenormous burden relative to GDP. By September 2010, overall debt had \nbeen reduced\u2014external A$69\u00a0million and internal A$481\u00a0million. Nauru\ngenerally runs large current account deficits funded by development-\npartner inflows.\n\n3.35.7  GDP growth, Federated States of \nMicronesia\n\n11\n\n10\n\n09\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n13\n12\nForecast\nSources: Pacific & Virgin Islands Training Initiatives. \nFederated States of Micronesia Fiscal Year 2010 Economic \nReview. http://www.pitiviti.org; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.35.8  Fiscal balance, Federated States of \nMicronesia\n\n% of GDP\n2\n\n10\n\n08\n\n2007\n\n09\nSources: International Monetary Fund.

Inflation is expected to turn positive, as currency \nappreciation effects wash through, and average 1.5% and 2.0% in the next \n2\u00a0fiscal\u00a0years.\n\nThe limited growth prospects for very small Pacific countries, such \n\nas Nauru, were acknowledged in a recent review of Australia\u2019s official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA). A planned increase in ODA, to offset the \nlack of private sector activity, is likely to be delivered through program-\nbased approaches. This will require improvements to the country\u2019s public \nfinancial management strategies in order to efficiently absorb and manage \nhigher ODA levels and translate this into economic growth. \n\nPalau\nThe economy grew by 5.8% in FY2011 (ended 30 September 2011), up from \n0.3% the previous year. Growth reflected strong data for tourism, which \naccounts for about half GDP. Arrivals from Asia, particularly East Asia, \nrose steeply (Figure\u00a03.35.10), aided by the addition of Delta Airlines flights \nbetween Palau and Japan. In FY2011, visitor arrivals increased by over 25% \nand exceeded 100,000 for the first time. \n\nRising food and transport costs raised inflation to 2.1% in FY2011, \nfrom 1.2% in FY2010. Inflation largely tracks price developments in the \nUS\u2014Palau\u2019s primary trading partner\u2014in the absence of any major \ndomestic inflationary factors.\n\nThe government continued to reduce expenditure (by 3.1% during \n\nFY2011), with cuts focused on publicly provided goods and services. \nPublic sector wages and salaries, which account for over a third of total \ngovernment spending, rose by about 5% in FY2011. The fiscal deficit \nwidened to 2.3% of GDP as lower grants from the US outweighed an \nincrease in domestic revenue associated with the economic recovery.\n\nTourism will remain the key source of growth for the foreseeable \nfuture, and visitor arrivals will continue to depend on developments \nabroad\u2014particularly in Japan; Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China. \nPalau\u2019s visitor arrivals are projected to go up by 7.5% and 6.0% in \nthe next 2\u00a0fiscal\u00a0years, supporting GDP growth of 3.0% and 2.0% \n(Figure\u00a03.35.11).\n\nInflation is projected to fall to 2.0% in FY2012 and to edge up to 2.5% \nthe following year, in line with expected international commodity price \ntrends.\n\nThe government is expected to maintain its contractionary fiscal \nstance on concerns about its fiscal position. Comprehensive civil service \nreform is needed to reduce the public sector wage bill. New revenue-\nraising measures, including increased tax rates for high-income earners \nand a steeper hotel-room tax, are under consideration and are likely to be \nadopted this fiscal year. Further tax reforms, such as a value-added tax, \nmay also be required.\n\n3.35.10  Visitor arrivals, Palau\n\nJapan\nTaipei,China\nRep. of Korea\nOthers\n\nThousand persons\n120\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSource: Palau Visitors Authority. http://www.visit-palau.com \n(accessed 16 March 2012). \nClick here for figure data\n\n3.35.11  GDP growth, Palau\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n%\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n\f244    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nPalau\u2019s tourism-oriented economy relies heavily on basic public \ngoods like transport infrastructure and reliable service delivery. These \nfacilities are, though, approaching full capacity and need to be expanded. \nSustaining tourism growth would also benefit from improvements in \nthe business environment, such as simplifying licensing procedures and \nexpanding access to skilled labor and credit.\n\nSamoa\nGrowth picked up to 2.1% in FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0June 2011), from 0.2% \nthe previous year (Figure\u00a03.35.12), reflecting growth in construction as \ninfrastructure projects were continued or initiated. Higher consumer \nspending also contributed, fueled by rising remittances (particularly \nfrom Australia and New Zealand). Construction-related industries like \ntransport and communications posted modest growth, as did tourism. \nAverage annual inflation rose to 2.9% in FY2011, driven by higher \n\nprices for imported food (mainly rice, flour, and chicken) and fuel.\nGovernment revenue and expenditure were generally in line \nwith budget targets, except development spending. This category was \nunderspent by 18.9%, given slow activity at several construction projects. \nThe fiscal deficit was 6.5% of GDP, lower than the budget estimate of 9.6% \nand the FY2010 outturn of 7.4%. The narrower deficit was in line with the \nrecommendation of the International Monetary Fund to move toward a \nmedium-term target of no more than 3% of GDP by FY2013. Although \nSamoa remains at low risk of debt distress, public debt is rising and is \nclose to 40% of GDP in present value terms. Accelerating the pace of \nfiscal consolidation would ensure adequate capacity to absorb shocks in \nthe future and accommodate rising debt repayments. \n\nThe Central Bank of Samoa continued easing monetary policy to \nstimulate economic activity and stabilize the economy. It reduced its \npolicy rate, and through its credit line facility lowered lending rates to the \nDevelopment Bank of Samoa and the Samoa Housing Corporation. Credit \nto the private sector recovered but grew by only 6.5% in FY2011, in line \nwith weak economic activity and despite ample financial sector liquidity \nand low nonperforming loans. \n\nThe current account deficit remained at about 9.3% GDP in FY2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.35.13) as some recovery in incomes from tourism and remittances \noffset a wider merchandise trade deficit (due to higher petroleum \npayments and increased imports associated with post-September 2009 \ntsunami reconstruction). Total imports rose by 11.4% (in US dollar terms), \nand exports of fresh fish, beer, and nonu juice fell by 5% due to weakening \ndemand in major markets, including Japan and New Zealand. \n\nThe economy is expected to grow by 2.5% and 2.4% in the next 2\u00a0fiscal \n\nyears, driven mainly by tourism and remittances. Tourism earnings in \nthe first 6\u00a0months of FY2012 were 2% higher than the equivalent FY2011 \nperiod. Private remittances rose by 3% to US$86.7\u00a0million during the\nsame period. This expansion, however, will not be enough to fully offset \nthe withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. \n\nMedium-term prospects will depend on how the US, Australian, and \n\nNew Zealand economies perform; these countries are Samoa\u2019s largest \ntrading partners and main sources of remittances and tourist arrivals. \n\n3.35.12  GDP growth, Samoa\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nNote: Fiscal year ending June.\nSources: Samoa Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.35.13  Current account balance, Samoa\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Samoa; Samoa Ministry of Finance. \n2011.

Exports of artesian water,\nfish, and nonu juice are likely to benefit, as the People\u2019s Republic of China \nphases in duty-free entry of a greater range of Samoan products in line \nwith a July 2010 trade agreement. \n\nContinued efforts to advance fiscal consolidation and to lower public \n\ndebt are essential to create the fiscal flexibility necessary to enable the \ngovernment to respond to external shocks. \n\nSolomon Islands\nThe economy grew at 9.3% in 2011\u2013the fastest of the Pacific island \ncountries. As in previous\u00a0years, the major contributor to growth was log \nproduction, where output was more than 1.9\u00a0million cubic meters, around \none-third more than in 2010. This reflected continued high demand in \nAsia. The country also benefited from high international prices for other \ncommodities such as palm oil, cocoa, copra, and fish, as well as renewed \ngold exports from the Gold Ridge mine in Guadalcanal, which resumed \nproduction after closing in June 2000 due to civil conflict. \n\nAfter falling to 1.0% in 2010, inflation jumped to 7.4%, largely \nreflecting strong growth and higher global food and energy prices. In \n2011, the central bank allowed the Solomon Islands dollar to appreciate \nvis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar by 8.7% in an explicit effort to contain inflation. \nIt also resumed issuing its own short-term bills to reduce liquidity in the \nbanking system. After contracting in 2010 and the first 9\u00a0months of 2011, \ncredit growth increased to 7.2% in the last quarter of the year.\n\nRevenue increased by almost 25% from 2010. Strong production of \nlogs and favorable prices in 2011 boosted customs duties, while strong \neconomic activity and elevated fuel prices led to higher inland revenues \n(i.e., goods and sales taxes, personal and corporate income taxes). \n\nOverall recurrent expenditure grew by 1.2% in 2011, with payrolls \ngrowing by 4.2% owing to cost-of-living adjustments to public service \nsalaries. Development expenditure grew by 54% during the year. Public \ndebt declined from 24.0% of GDP in 2010 to 21.6% in late 2011, related to \ndebt repayments and an increase in nominal GDP.\n\nThe current account deficit narrowed to 11.2% of GDP, from 27.6% \nin 2010 on higher exports and reduced imports of capital equipment \nfollowing the reopening of the Gold Ridge mine. The deficit has been \nfunded through donor inflows and foreign investment. Foreign reserve \ncover improved to over 9\u00a0months of imports as of December 2011.\n\nGrowth is expected to moderate to 6.0% and 5.0% over the next \n\n3.35.14  GDP growth, Solomon Islands \n\n%\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\nA budget surplus equivalent to 2.1% of GDP was recorded in 2011. \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: Solomon Islands National Statistics Office; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f246    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\n2\u00a0years (Figure\u00a03.35.14). Reduced logging output, due to overexploitation \nof the native forest, will be partly offset by increased value of gold \noutput, as the Gold Ridge mine reaches full output, and by strengthening \ncommodities such as palm oil, copra, and vanilla.\n\nThe 2012 budget is balanced. Expenditure is to increase by 47%, which \n\nwill be covered by a 22.4% gain in revenue, a drawdown on the National \nTransport Fund for development projects, and by using grants from \nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). To help \npreserve the budgetary position if the strong revenue growth does not \ncontinue, much of the increase in spending is in one-time items such as \nthe hosting of the Pacific Arts Festival, or items that can be scaled back, \nincluding a planned doubling of debt repayments in late 2012. \n\nThis rate of expenditure growth, however, is unsustainable and will \n\nneed to be reduced in future budgets.\n\nInflation is expected to moderate over the next 2\u00a0years as growth \nand global commodity prices ease. Average inflation of 5.5% and 5.0% are \nforecast (Figure\u00a03.35.15). The central bank will likely continue to let the \nexchange rate appreciate modestly if inflation does not moderate.\n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to widen to around 15.0% of \nGDP in 2012 and 2013 as a result of slower export growth. The gap will be \nfunded through continued donor inflows and foreign investment. Foreign \nreserves should remain at around 7\u20138\u00a0months of imports.\n\nThe private sector faces numerous challenges to doing business. It \nmust compete with SOEs, which receive preferential access to resources \nand operate in markets reserved for them, such as power and water \nsupply. The SOEs hold nearly a quarter of the nation\u2019s fixed assets, absorb \nlarge amounts of scarce capital, and generally yield negative returns on \ntheir fixed assets and investments, thereby increasing costs for private \nenterprises. \n\nA State Owned Enterprise Act, passed in 2007, and its accompanying \n\nregulations, issued in 2010, now provide a robust framework for SOE \ngovernance and monitoring. Implementation of this act\u2014including \nimproving the accuracy and timeliness of the financial information \nprepared by SOEs as well as requiring proper costing, funding, and \ndocumentation of all community service obligations\u2014is essential to \nimproving efficiency and accountability. \n\nMajor gaps exist in access to infrastructure across the country. A \nmajority of the nation\u2019s rural population does not, for example, have \naccess to paved roads, regular electricity supplies, or telecommunications. \n\nTonga\nThe economy contracted by 0.3% in FY2011 (ended 30\u00a0June 2011) \nafter growth of 0.3% the previous year (Figure\u00a03.35.16). Remittances, \ncoming largely from the US, continued to decline, and, coupled with \nbanks\u2019 steps to repair their balance sheets, affected both business and \nhousehold investment and consumption. Tourism, and particularly the \ncruise liner market segment, was the bright spot in the economy, with \ntourism receipts growing by 14.8% (in real terms) in FY2011 from the \nprevious year.\n\n3.35.15  Inflation, Solomon Islands\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n12\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n3.35.16  GDP growth, Tonga \n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance and National Planning; ADB \nestimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n%\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSmall Pacific countries    247\n\nInflation rose to about 6.1%, reflecting the surge in global fuel and \n\nfood prices and higher excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol.\n\nRevenue in FY2011 was 5.8% more than in FY2010, but despite this and \n\nreceipt of budget support grants from development partners, the FY2011 \nfiscal deficit widened to 7.9% of GDP, financed mainly by loans from the \nEXIM Bank of China and drawdowns on domestic cash balances. The \nshare of public debt to GDP rose to 56.1% (including the undisbursed \nportion of loans) by end-FY2011, exceeding the government\u2019s target ceiling \nof 40%. \n\nTo boost commercial bank lending, the central bank continued to \nease monetary policy, although lending to businesses and households in \n2011 continued declining, by 11.1% and 4.6%, respectively. \n\nIn the external account, fish and squash exports (which account \nfor more than half of all exports) grew by only 1.9% in FY2011 (after \nmore than doubling in FY2010) given problems in meeting quarantine \nrequirements for New Zealand, and unfavorable weather. Imports, \ndominated by basic consumption goods, increased by 16.6%, largely due \nto higher oil prices as well as increased imports of wholesale and retail \ngoods and construction materials.\n\nForeign reserves remained at comfortable\u00a0levels, reaching 7.7\u00a0months \n\nof imports, reflecting receipts of development-partner funds, ample \nliquidity in the financial system, and weak business and household \nactivity.\n\nThe economy is forecast to show virtually zero growth in the next \n2\u00a0years. Domestic economic activity is expected to remain weak despite \ndonor-funded public construction, in view of declining remittances and \nflat credit growth, which will affect household consumption and private \nsector investment.\n\nA bleak outlook on remittances is also foreseen given the slow \n\nrecovery in the US and continuing high unemployment in other \nsource economies such as New Zealand. Government analysis suggests \nremittances are likely to be permanently lower than in the past \n(Figure\u00a03.35.17). Exports, which are around 3% of GDP, could, however, \nlead a stronger expansion of the economy if supply-side constraints are \naddressed and compliance with export market quarantine standards \nimproves.\n\nThe central bank is expected to continue its loose monetary policy \nstance, unless global commodity prices rise further. Inflation is likely to \nhover around 6.0% in FY2012.\n\nTonga is classified by the International Monetary Fund as at high risk \n\nof debt distress. The high public debt and its composition pose serious \nchallenges. Debt repayments are expected to increase by 70% in FY2014, \nwhen repayments start on a loan from the EXIM Bank of China. It is \ncritical that the government uses year-end cash surpluses, reprioritizes \nexpenditure, and raises the tax effort to build cash reserves, which could \nprovide a buffer against cross-currency foreign exchange risks and \nsafeguard the government\u2019s expenditure programs. \n\n3.35.17  Private remittances, Tonga\nReal\n\nNominal\n\nyear-on-year % change, \n3-month moving average\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\nMar\n2010\n\nJun\n\nSep\n\nDec\n\nJun\n\nSep\n\nDec\n\nMar\n11\n\nSource: National Reserve Bank of Tonga.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\f248    Asian Development Outlook 2012\n\nTuvalu\nAfter 2\u00a0years of contraction, the economy grew by 1.0% in 2011 \n(Figure\u00a03.35.18), largely due to higher remittances. The consumer price \nindex increased by 0.5% in 2011, which was lower than in most other \nPacific economies, reflecting the appreciation of the Australian dollar \n(which Tuvalu uses as its currency) against the US dollar.\n\nTotal revenues and grants for 2011 were slightly below budget but \n\nabout 20% higher than in 2010. The increase was mainly due to the \ngrants. Government expenditure fell by more than 7% as subsidies were \nreduced and spending on capital projects declined. These developments \nled to a reduction in the fiscal deficit from over 30% of GDP in 2010 to \nabout 8% in 2011. However, weakly controlled spending on the Tuvalu \nMedical Treatment Scheme remains a heavy drain on the budget with \nactual expenditure 70% above budget in 2011. Total government debt \nwas estimated at 44.3% of GDP in 2010, and may be higher with the \nstatus of contingent liabilities from joint-venture fishing companies to be \ndetermined (Figure\u00a03.35.19).\n\nThe market value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund stood at A$115.1\u00a0million as\n\nof 30\u00a0September 2011. As this was 9.7% below its prescribed maintained \nvalue, nothing was distributed from the fund to the Consolidated \nInvestment Fund (CIF\u2014the vehicle through which budget deficits are \nfinanced). \n\nGrowth is expected to edge up to 1.4% and 1.3% in the next 2\u00a0years, \n\nsupported by development partner\u2013financed upgrading of the Tuvalu \nairfield and airport. Increases in remittances are also expected.\n\nTotal revenue and grants are budgeted at A$24.1\u00a0million in 2012, 7%\nless than the 2011 outturn, due to a projected 3.3% reduction in receipts \nfrom fisheries licenses and lower grant funds. Government expenditure is \nestimated at A$29.2\u00a0million (13% below the 2011 projected outturn) as the\ngovernment tries to control spending. At A$5.1\u00a0million, the budget deficit\nis forecast at 14.3% of GDP. The CIF held A$3.1\u00a0million in December 2011\nand, given the expected deficit, is likely to be exhausted this year. Further \ndistribution from trust fund earnings is not expected until 2014 at the \nearliest. \n\nThe fiscal situation remains precarious. With the likely exhaustion \n\nof the CIF in 2012, development partners will become the primary \navenue for budget financing, underlining the importance of reforms and \nexpenditure controls. \n\nVanuatu\nGrowth nearly doubled in 2011 to 4.3%, reflecting strong agricultural \nexports (notably copra and coconut oil), high international commodity \nprices, and growth in construction. Tourist arrivals fell, however, by 3.5% \nfrom the 2010 level, which had been inflated because flooding in Fiji \ndiverted tourists to other destinations (Figure\u00a03.35.20). \n\nDespite high global energy and food prices, the consumer price index \n\nrose by just 0.8% in 2011. This was partly explained by a slowdown in \ngrowth of private credit.\n\nThe current account deficit was steady at 5.9% of GDP in 2011, and \n\nwas more than covered by foreign investment and donor inflows.

This will be driven by increasing construction, continuing \nstrength in agricultural production, and recovering tourism (additional \nflights are planned from Australia and Fiji).\n\nSmall fiscal deficits of 1.5% and 2.7% of GDP are expected as the \n\ngovernment increases borrowing to fund improvements to infrastructure. \nPublic debt as a share of GDP is expected to remain around 20%, as \nhigher debt is offset by growth in nominal GDP. If, however, contingent \nliabilities associated with past losses of some of the poorer performing \nSOEs were included, debt as a share of GDP would likely exceed the \ngovernment\u2019s ceiling of 40%.\n\nInflation is expected to pick up as the economy grows, to around \n\n3.0\u20134.0% in the next 2 years. \n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to widen a little to 6.3\u20136.5% \nof GDP over the next 2\u00a0years, as a result of stronger imports related to \ninfrastructure projects. The gap will be funded through continued donor \ninflows and foreign investment. Foreign exchange reserves are expected to \nremain at levels needed to finance 5\u20136\u00a0months of imports. \n\nVanuatu became WTO\u2019s 154th member in November 2011. Joining \nrequired reductions in tariffs but the resulting loss in revenue will be \npartly offset by excise tax increases. Taxes as a share of GDP are already \nrelatively low at around 19% of GDP. Thus, as the indirect tax base erodes, \nthe government will need to consider bringing in measures to broaden \nthe tax base, such as a progressive income tax. \n\n3.35.21  GDP growth, Vanuatu\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2007\n\n08\n\n09\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\nClick here for figure data\n\n\fStatistical \nappendix\n\n\fStatistical notes\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators for 44 \ndeveloping member economies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nfor Brunei Darussalam, an unclassified regional member, in a total of 18 \ntables. The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, East \nAsia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the tables contain \nhistorical data from 2007 to 2011; some have forecasts for 2012 and 2013.\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible in order to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in statistical \nmethodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full comparability \nimpossible. The national income accounts section is based on the United \nNations System of National Accounts, while the balance-of-payments data are \nbased on International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical \ndata were obtained from official sources, statistical publications and databases, \nand documents of ADB, IMF, and World Bank. Projections for 2012 and \n2013 are generally staff estimates made on the basis of available quarterly or \nmonthly data, although some projections are from governments.\n\nMost countries report on a calendar-year basis. Some economies record \n\ntheir government finance data on a fiscal year basis, such as Armenia; \nAzerbaijan; Cook Islands; Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR); Samoa; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; \nand Uzbekistan. Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Republic of Marshall \nIslands, and Republic of Palau (hereafter Palau) report government finance \nand balance-of-payments data on a fiscal year basis. South Asian countries \n(except for Maldives and Sri Lanka), Myanmar, Samoa, and Tonga report all \nvariables on a fiscal year basis.\n\nRegional and subregional averages/totals are provided for seven tables (A1, \n\nA2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, and A14, the averages \nare computed using weights derived from levels of gross national income \n(GNI) in current United States dollars (US$) following the World Bank Atlas\nmethod. The GNI data for 2007\u20132010 were obtained from the World Bank\u2019s \nWorld Development Indicators online. Weights for 2010 were carried over \nthrough 2013. The GNI data for Cook Islands were estimated using the Atlas \nconversion factor. Myanmar and Nauru have no GNI data. For tables A11 and \n\n\f252    Statistical appendix\n\nA12, the regional and subregional averages were computed on the basis of a \nconsistent sum, which means that if there are missing country data for a given \nyear, the sum of the prior year used for computing the growth rate excludes \nthe corresponding country data. Data for Myanmar and Nauru are excluded \nfrom the computation of all subregional averages/totals.\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show related data on output \ngrowth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income accounts \nseries for some countries have been made owing to a change in source, \nmethodology, and/or base year. The series for Bhutan and India reflects fiscal \nrather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste reflects non-oil, \nnon-United Nations GDP. \n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, or basic \nprices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value added of all \nresident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less subsidies on \nimports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. Constant factor \ncost measures differ from market price measures in that they exclude taxes \non production and include subsidies. Basic price valuation is the factor cost \nplus some taxes on production, such as property and payroll taxes, and \nless some subsidies, such as labor-related subsidies but not product-related \nsubsidies. Most countries use constant market price valuation. Fiji, India, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka use constant factor costs, while Maldives and Nepal \nuse basic prices. GDP data up to 2009 were excluded for Nauru because of \nconsistency issues.\n\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table provides \nthe growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as GDP at constant \nprices divided by the population. The series for most of the Pacific countries \nwere revised due to a change in source of population data. Data on per capita \ngross national product in US$ terms for 2010, sourced from the World Bank,\nWorld Development Indicators online, are also shown. Per capita GNP for \nCook Islands and Tuvalu are estimated based on derived GNI data.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year).\nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture and its \ncorresponding share in 2010. The agriculture sector comprises agricultural \ncrops, livestock, poultry, fisheries, and forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). The table \n\nprovides the growth rates of value added in industry and its corresponding \nshare in 2010. This sector comprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, \nconstruction, and utilities. However, construction in Uzbekistan is included in \nthe services sector.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). The table \ngives the growth rates of value added in services, as well as its corresponding \nshare in 2010. Subsectors generally include trade, banking, finance, real estate, \npublic administration, and other services.\n\nTable A6: Inflation (% per year). Data on inflation rates represent period \naverages. Except for India, which reports the wholesale price index, inflation \nrates presented are based on consumer price indexes. The consumer price \nindexes of the following countries are for a given city or group of consumers \nonly: Afghanistan is for Kabul, Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, Marshall \nIslands is for Majuro, Solomon Islands is for Honiara, and Nepal is for urban \nconsumers. \n\n\fStatistical appendix    253\n\nTable A7: Growth in money supply (% per year). This table tracks the \nannual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad money as \nrepresented by M2 (for most countries). M2 is defined as the sum of M1 and \nquasi-money where M1 denotes currency in circulation plus demand deposits \nand quasi-money consists of time and savings deposits including foreign \ncurrency deposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government finance. This set of tables refers \nto the revenue and expenditure transactions as well as the fiscal balance of \nthe central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal terms. \nFor Cambodia, the PRC, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nTajikistan, and Turkmenistan, transactions are those reported by the general \ngovernment. \n\nTable A8: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central government \n\nrevenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current and capital, plus \ngrants. These amounts are computed as a percentage of GDP at current prices. \nFor the Republic of Korea, revenues exclude social security contributions. \nFor Singapore, revenues refer to receipts credited to the three accounts listed \nfor the previous table, including investment income, capital receipts, and \ninvestment adjustments. For Kazakhstan, revenues include transfers from \nthe national fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nSingapore, and Thailand; revenues from disinvestment are included for \nIndia; only current revenues are included for Bangladesh; and grants and \nprivatization proceeds are excluded for Sri Lanka. \n\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \n\ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to both current \nand capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts are computed as a \nshare of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, expenditures refer to budgetary \nexpenditures excluding externally financed expenditures and corresponding \nborrowing; while that for Tajikistan includes externally financed public \ninvestment programs. One-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \n\nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current prices. \nData variations may arise due to statistical discrepancies, e.g., balancing items \nfor both central and local governments, and differences in the concept used in \nthe individual computations of revenues and expenditures as compared with \nthe calculation of the fiscal balance. For Fiji, the fiscal balance excludes total \nloan repayments. For Thailand, the fiscal balance is a cash balance composed \nof the budgetary and nonbudgetary balances. \n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. This set of tables \nshow selected international economic transactions of countries as recorded \nin the balance of payments (BOP). These items cover annual flows, except for \nsome countries which show data as of a specified period only. \n\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and imports \n(% per year). The annual growth rates of exports and imports, in terms of \nmerchandise goods only (except for Turkmenistan, which covers both goods \nand services), are shown in these tables. Data are in million US$, primarily\nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each country. Exports are \nreported on a free-on-board (f.o.b.) basis. Import data are generally reported \non an f.o.b. basis, except for Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, the \n\n\f254    Statistical appendix\n\nLao\u00a0PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, and \nThailand, which value them on a cost, insurance, freight (c.i.f.) basis. \nTable A13: Trade balance (US$ million). The trade balance is the \n\ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. Figures in \nthis table are based on the export and import levels used to generate Tables \nA11 and A12.\n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current account \n\nbalance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, net trade in \nservices and factor income, and net transfers. The values reported are divided \nby GDP at current prices in US$. In the case of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and\nViet Nam, official transfers are excluded from the current account balance. \n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). The annual \naverage exchange rates of each economy are quoted in local currencies per US \ndollar. The rate for 2011 for India is for the period April 2011\u2013January 2012. \nThe Turkmenistan Manat was redenominated on 1 January 2009 from TMM \n14,250 to TMM 2.8 per US dollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves (US$ million). Gross international \n\nreserves are defined as the US$ value of holdings of foreign exchange, special\ndrawing rights (SDR), reserve position in the IMF, and gold at the end of \na given period. For the PRC and Turkmenistan, gold is excluded in the \ncomputation. For the Marshall Islands and Taipei,China, this item refers \nto foreign exchange reserves only. In some countries, the rubric comprises \nforeign assets and reserves of national monetary authorities and national oil \nfunds, i.e., foreign assets of the Maldives Monetary Authority, net foreign \nreserves of the State Bank of Pakistan, assets of the National Oil Fund of \nAzerbaijan, and official external assets of Kiribati. The data for India are as of \n23 March 2012.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding (US$ million). For most economies, \n\nexternal debt outstanding\u2014public and private\u2014includes medium- and \nlong-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. For Cambodia, Georgia, \nand the Lao PDR, only public external debt is reported. For Azerbaijan; India; \nKazakhstan; Kyrgyz Republic; Malaysia, the Philippines; and Singapore the \nfigures for 2011 are as of end-September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). This \n\ntable generally presents the total debt service payments of each economy, \nwhich comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-term debt) and \ninterest payments on outstanding external debt, as a percentage of exports \nof goods and services. For Cambodia and the Lao PDR, debt service refers \nto external public debt only. For Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Viet Nam, \nexports of goods are used as the denominator in the calculation of the ratio; \nfor the Philippines, exports of goods, services, and income are used as the \ndenominator. For Bangladesh, the ratio represents debt service payments on \nmedium- and long-term loans as a percentage of exports of goods, nonfactor \nservices, and workers\u2019 remittances; while for Azerbaijan, the ratio represents \npublic and publicly guaranteed external debt service payments as a percentage \nof exports of goods and nonfactor services. \n\n\fStatistical appendix    255\n\nTable A1  Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nMongolia\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Still, in the absence of any sudden \nshocks, developing Asia can manage the effects on its trade flows and financial markets.\n\nThe theme chapter looks at widening inequality: in spite of developing Asia\u2019s great success \nin raising living standards and reducing poverty, swelling income disparities threaten to \nundermine the pace of progress. Regional policy makers need to ensure that the benefits of \ngrowth are widely shared.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nApril 2012\n\nPrinted on recycled paper\n\nISBN 978-92-9092-607-8\n\n9 7 8 9 2 9 0 9 2 6 0 7 8 >\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\n", "Outlook\n2012\n", "Confronting Rising Inequality in Asia\n", "Asian Development Bank\n", "\u00a9 2012 Asian Development Bank\n", "All rights reserved.
