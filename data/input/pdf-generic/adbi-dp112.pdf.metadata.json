This  paper  reviews  literature  related  to  contract \nfarming  in  Thailand  and  adds  updated  information  based  on  field  visits  in  2007.  Special \nattention  is  given  to  roles  played  by  government  in  the  initial  stage  of  contract  farming \ndevelopment.  Conclusively,  it  is  important  for  the  public  sector  to  create  a  favorable \nenvironment  and  infrastructure  to  encourage  investment  in  agribusiness  and  to  coordinate \nthe concerned parties to raise agricultural productivity.  \n\nThe  paper  also  evaluates  the  effectiveness  of  contract  farming  as  a  means  to  stabilize \nfarmers\u2019  income  and  strategize  agricultural  development.  The  findings  show  that  while  the \npoorest farmers were not excluded from contract farming, special measures may be needed \nto encourage their full participation. In the long run, small farmers were able to accumulate \nproduction  and  management  skills,  thus  improving  their  bargaining  position.  Together  with \nimproved  infrastructure  and  a  more  competitive  market  due  to  farmers\u2019  innovation,  the \nfarmers\u2019 best choice may include non-contract production. \n\n \nJEL Classification: Q13, Q17, L14 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nI. \n\nII. \n\nIII. \n\nIV. \n\nV. \n\nVI. \n\nIX. \n\nX. \n\nContents \n \n \n\nGovernment Policy and Implementations \n\nIntroduction \n\nMarket Competition \n\nForms of Contract \n\nPricing \n\nEffectiveness of Contract Farming Schemes: Success and Failure \n\nVII. \n\nFarmers' Attitudes Toward Contract Farming \n\nVIII. \n\nIncome Risk and Efficiency \n\nOpportunities for Farmers to Gain New Knowledge \n\nContribution to Rural Development \n\nXI.

Diversification  was \nfacilitated  by  infrastructure  development  during  the  early  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Plans. During the 4th National Economic and Social Development Plan (1977\u2013\n1981),  policies  for  value-added  exports  were  promoted  and  agro-industries  grew  rapidly, \nespecially  in  canned  fish,  pineapples,  and  tomato  products.  The  6th  Plan  promoted  the \nintegration  of  farming  and  processing  and  high  value-added  exports.  Compared  to  other \nAsian  countries,  by  early  1990  Thailand  probably  had  the  most  extensive  experience  with \ncontract farming and the widest range of crops (Glover 1992). By the middle of the 7th Plan, \nthe  export  value  of  agro-industrial  products  had  reached  82,000  million  Baht  and  grew  to \n247,000  million  by  2003  (Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives  2004)  and  reached \n303,069 million Baht in 2006. In the fruit and vegetable and poultry processing sectors where \ncontract  production  is  extensive,  growth  rates  during  2005\u20132006  maintained  high  levels\u2013\u2013\n11.1% and 8% respectively (Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives 2007).  \n\nContract  farming  has  been  instrumental  in  providing  growers  access  to  supply  chains  with \nmarket  and  price  stability,  as  well  as  technical  assistance.  For  resource-poor  growers, \nproduction  input  and  farm  investment  on  credit  are  often  provided  by  firms.  In  return, \ncontractors  expect  delivery  of  goods  in  specified  quantities,  quality  and  set  prices.  Market \nand  price  certainty  for  both  parties  and  integrated  farm-processing  enhances  the  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  via  improved  quality  products  and  an  efficient  supply  chain.  Well-\ncoordinated contract farming systems assist development in less privileged farming sectors.  \n\nContract farming in Thailand is approaching maturity. In the early stage, the government was \nheavily  involved  in  monitoring,  facilitating  and  encouraging  stakeholders  in  contractual \narrangements. Over time, farmers gained skills, the market evolved, and a more flexible form \nof contract farming emerged. Today, former contract farmers can negotiate contracts based \non their best opportunity. This is found in the case of potatoes in the North and shrimp in the \nSouth where growers can switch between open and contract markets.  \n\nThis  paper  aims  to  highlight  the  government\u2019s  role  in  the  initial  stage  of  contract  farming \ndevelopment  and  factors  that  contributed  to  success  and  failure,  and  to  evaluate  the \neffectiveness  of  contract  farming  as  a  means  for  income  stability,  technological  transfer, \nmarket  access,  and  agricultural  development.  The  paper  is  based  on  a  review  of  literature \nand the authors\u2019 previous and updated field research up to 2007.  \n\nII. \n\nGOVERNMENT POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATIONS \n\nContract farming had been practiced in  some forms before the 6th National Economic and \nSocial  Development  Plan  (1987\u20131991).  Processed  food,  e.g.  canned  fish,  pineapples  and \ntomato products, was initially targeted for export markets. Exported canned vegetables in the \n1970s mostly carried foreign brand names and contract broiler production started in the early \n1980s.  Prior  to  this  period,  sugar  cane  and  tobacco  were  produced  under  contract \narrangements. The latter was contracted by the state enterprise. \n\nThe  6th  Plan  included  guidelines  for  the  development  of  agro-industries  with  a  goal  of \npromoting  value-added  exports.  To  meet  the  goal,  the  government  augmented  guidelines \nwith the so-called \u201cFour-Sector Co-operation Plan to develop agriculture and agro-industry\u201d \n\n                                                 \n1 Chiang  Mai  University,  Faculty  of  Agriculture  and  Faculty  of  Economics,  Chiang  Mai  50200,  Thailand.

The authors also wish to express their thanks to the anonymous reviewers and editors \nwho gave their detailed attention for the significant refinement of this paper. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\n(4-sector plan). Under this plan, agro-industrial firms, farmers, financial institutions (Bank for \nAgriculture  and  Agricultural  Cooperatives  [BAAC])  and  government  agencies  worked \ntogether  to  improve  production  systems  to  reduce  price  risk  and  market  uncertainty  while \nfarmers improved their technical knowledge and raised production efficiency and the quality \nof  raw  materials.  in  addition  to  general  extension  services,  the  government  invested  250 \nmillion  Baht  in  BAAC  (then,  25  Baht  =  US$1).  The  capital  gain  was  used  as  interest \ncompensation  for  participating  farmers  (3.5  %  p.a.)  and  to  encourage  more  farmer \nparticipants and to reduce production costs. \n\nDuring 1987\u20131993, 12 large projects proposed  by 20 private firms  were approved, but two \ndid  not  operate  (eucalyptus  and  integrated  hog  production)  and  three  ceased  production \nafter  one  year  (asparagus,  ramie  and  bamboo  for  paper  pulp)  (Office  of  Agricultural \nEconomics 1993). Nonetheless, Naritoom (2000) reported successful asparagus groups that \nhad  contracted  with  three  companies  since  1989.  The  seven  remaining  projects  continued \noperations  after  1993:  castor  bean,  basmati  rice,  sunflower,  wheat,  barley,  hybrid  corn, \nsorghum, and cashew nuts (Wiboonpongse et al. 1998). \n\nThe Office of Agricultural Economics (1991) concluded that the results of the 4-sector Plan \nwere unsatisfactory since some of those projects relied heavily on government support (e.g. \nprovision  of  free  seed  for  sunflower  growers).  Plan  failure  was  attributed  to  lack  of \nmanagement flexibility in light of unforeseen circumstances such as drought, which resulted \nlow  quality  and  unmarketable  produce.  Secondly,  farmers  needed  time  to  adapt  to  new \ncrops,  which  usually  involves  new  technology.  When  new  crops  did  not  provide  desirable \nyields and returns, farmers were discouraged and shifted back to their old crops. Thirdly, the \nextension service was also blamed for this failure (Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives \n1994). The commodities chosen involved more input and higher risk, and technical support \nand delivery systems could not cover all the project areas. \n\nMost private contract farming schemes failed in the early 1990s (Baumann 2000). Evaluation \nof  the  4-sector  Plan  suggested  that  contract  farming  was  not  for  every  farmer  but  an \nalternative  to  those  who  could  accept  new  practices  or  needed  credit.  Furthermore, \ngovernment  agencies  should  not  be  directly  involved  between  farmers  and  firms,  and \ncontracted  businesses  should  grow  without  continual  government  support  (National \nEconomic and Social Development Board 1995 in Wiboonpongse et al. 1998). \n\nBy the end of the Sixth plan in 1991, the NESDB recommended that contract agreements be \nmore  effective  and  beneficial  to  all  parties  concerned  (Singh  2004).  The  Subcommittee  of \nthe 4-sector Plan came up with several measures in response to issues regarding fairness \nand  risk  reduction  to  assure  cooperation  between  the  government  agencies  and  firms. \nMeasures  focused  on  coordination  and  risk  sharing,  such  as  a  \u201cproject  fund\u201d  to  provide \ncompensation  for  production  and  marketing  risk,  or,  \u201cgroup  farming\u201d  and  \u201ccost  sharing\u201d \namong farmers and firms. The last alternative was considered a novel measure and was not \nimplemented. \n\nTo  raise  the  probability  of  success,  the  subcommittee  in  1995  (the  7th  plan)  consented  to \nsupport  agro-industrial  projects  (under  the  4-sector  Plan) that  could  reduce  production  and \nmarketing  risks  and  identify  potential  target  areas  and  farmers.  The  proposals  were \napproved based on the highest benefit terms provided to participating farmers by the firms. \nThe  subcommittee  also  improved  the  4-sector  Plan  and  indicated  two  target  commodity \ngroups: (i) produce with high-export potential e.g. high quality rice, fruits, flowers, fresh water \nand  coastal  fish,  and  (ii)  industrial  crops  (e.g.,  vegetables,  sunflower,  maize,  and  fast-\ngrowing  trees).  To  assure  fairness,  the  government  in  1999  took  charge  of  regulating \ncontract compliance using a standard agreement for companies and farmers issued by the \nDepartment of Internal Trade (Singh 2004), which is in effect today. \n\nThough there is no explicit mention of contract farming in the 9th National Plan (2002\u20132006), \ngovernment agencies continued to implement it. In 2004, to alleviate a trade issue between \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand, the government compensated farmers if \n\n2 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nthey  reduced  garlic  crops  and  switched  to  other  crops  under  contract  farming.  In  addition, \nthe  private  sector  has  been  encouraged  to  extend  contract  schemes  to  neighboring \ncountries  under  a  sub-regional  economic  cooperation  agreement  called  \u201cAyeyawady-Chao \nPhraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy\u201d (ACMECS). The scheme enables firms to \nreduce the seasonality of raw material procurement (Thai Chamber of Commerce 2006).  \n\nIII. \n\nMARKET COMPETITION \n\nThai agricultural marketing systems generally are competitive. In contract farming, a quasi-\nmonopoly  has  been  necessary  for  success.  Japanese  cucumber  contract  farming  in  the \nearly  1990s  appeared  to  be  a  monopsony  when  it  had  a  small  and  specific  market.  There \nwas only one company making contracts with farmers, and the nature of contracts and close \nsupervision  was  similar  to  other  crops  new  to  farmers  where  the  final  market  required \nexacting  specifications.  Presently,  the  crop  has  become  more  common  despite  the  strict \nspecifications and quality is maintained by the few companies exporting to Japan.  \n\nIn  high  demand  crops  like  potatoes  and  other  vegetables,  contracted  markets  are  highly \ncompetitive. In 1990, there were only two potato processing companies contracting farmers \nin Northern Thailand, but five years later, there were seven potato processing firms and the \ncompetition for contract farmers became intense. Information was disseminated in the areas \nand the prices offered by firms were not significantly different. Farmers were not loyal to any \nspecific  company  and  did  not  hesitate  to  switch  companies  when  offered  a  better  deal \n(Ornberg 1998). \n\nAfter  20  years  of  potato  production,  the  supply  deal  changed.  This  is  due  to  farmers\u2019 \naccumulated  production  and  market  experience  and  innovation,  which  enhanced  their \nbargaining  power.  On  the  other  hand,  increased  demand  for  potato  chips  put  pressure  on \nfirms to secure raw materials, and it became easy to obtain potatoes at lower cost with less \nquality  risk  when  farmers  became  skillful  in  production.  Our  visits  to  companies  in  2004 \nrevealed that competition for farmers among firms processing the same or different products \nbecame fierce in the 1990s before the economic crisis broke out in Asia.  \n\nContract  farming  has  expanded  from  Chiang  Mai  to  other  provinces  in  the  North. \nCommodities include poultry and hogs, Japanese rice, basmati rice, organic rice, vegetable \nseed,  corn  seed,  and  various  fresh  vegetables  for  frozen  and  pickled  products.  The \ncommodities are contracted by large and medium firms owned by multinational companies, \nand joint ventures or by domestic companies. After the 1997 economic crisis, smaller firms \nleft the industry, but competition continued among  fewer but larger firms. Now there are at \nleast  3\u20134  companies  competing  for  the  same  crops.  As  disclosed  by  one  company,  firms \nneed to exercise different tactics to keep their farmers. \n\nCompanies  either  use  price  strategy  or  quality  strategy.  This  implies  high  market  force  to \nobtain labor, suitable land and desirable production environments among industrial firms. For \ncrops  that  need  to  be  processed  within  24  hours  (oil  palm,  eggplant  and  sweet  corn), \ndistance to factories is limited to transport under 12 hours, thus competition is even stronger. \nWhile  companies  compete for  farmers,  they  also  mention  that  farmers  seek  contracts,  and \ncurrent farmers desire to expand their contracts.  \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nIV. \n\nFORMS OF CONTRACT \n\nContract  farming  is  constructed  depending  on  the  crops  or  products,  the  objectives  and \nresources of the contractor, and the experience of the farmers (Eaton and Shepherd 2001). \nIn Thailand, four typical contract models can be identified: the centralized model, the nucleus \nestate model, the intermediary and multipartite model, and the formal model, as delineated \nin Figure 1.  \n\nFigure 1: Examples of various types of contract arrangements in Thailand \n\n(a) Centralized model: sugar cane \n\n(b) Nucleus estate model: commodities require \nhigh technology \n\nContractor \n\nEstate pilot \n\nSatellite \ngrowers \n\ngrow\n\ngrow\n\ngrow\n\n\u2022 parent stock \n\u2022 know-how \n\nCommodities: Broilers, hogs, eggs \n\n(d) Formal model \n\n \n(c) Intermediary and multipartite model \n \n\ninput \n\n \noutput \n\nCF farmers\u2019 \ngroup \n\nFarmers \n\nAcademics\n\nfinancial support for  training \n\nProcessing \nfirms \n\nseed and \npayment \n\nwritten \n\ncontract \n\noutput\n\nExtension officers as \ncoordinator and witness \n\n \n(e) Partly Informal model \n \n\n  tomatoes \n\n \n\n \n(f) Informal model \n \n\n  Farmers \n\n  Middlemen \n\nwritten \n\n contract \n\n informal\n\n   contract\n\nProcessing\n companies\n\nFarmers\n\n   contract \n\nMiddlemen \n\n   contract \n\n informal \n\nProcessing\n companies\n\n seed \n\n seed \n\n  tomatoes\n\n informal \n\n fertilizer\n\nSource: Wiboonpongse and Sriboonchitta (1995), Eaton and Shepherd (2001). \n\nThe nucleus estate model is  suitable for commodities requiring immediate processing after \nharvest  or  high  production  and  management  technology  that  farmers  lack.  The  informal \nmodel,  which  is  not  as  complex,  may  involve  just  a  few  market  agents  without  a  written \ncontract.  Different  arrangements  have  an  impact  on  pricing  and  other  economic  factors  in \nthe contract farming systems.  \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nV. \n\nPRICING  \n\nPrices paid for contracted crops are usually lower than market prices. Singh (2004) reveals \nthat  most  farmers  try  to  sell  their  produce  at  market  for  a  better  price  instead  of  factories \nwhere  farmers  must  comply  to  specified  conditions.  This  phenomenon  was  a  common \nproblem  for  inexperienced  factories  and  is  likely  to happen  anywhere  that  contract  farming \nemerges.  \n\nThe  problem  was  solved  successfully  using  various  tactics.  For  crops  demanded  by  both \nprocessing firms and fresh food markets\u2014e.g., tomatoes\u2014firms allowed 20% of the crop to \nbe  sold  in  the  open  fresh  food  market,  then  during  peak  season,  when  prices  declined, \nfactories  purchased  large  volumes  of  high  quality  produce  at  contracted  prices.  The \neconomic rationale is the trade-off between risk and return to farmers and stable prices for \nraw materials. \n\nPrices  companies  pay  to  farmers  are  partly  dependent  on  quality,  which  is  an  additional \nincentive  for  farmers  to  deliver  high  quality  products.  For  example,  for  grade  A  eggplants, \nfarmers receive 5 baht/kg, but the price drops sharply to 1 baht/kg for grade B. The quality \ndifference is only the appearance of the skin, even though the other attributes are the same. \nCrop  quality  consistency  and  standards  are  often  the  most  crucial  factors  in  a  contract. \nHowever,  Baumann  (2000)  stated  that  it is easy for  a  company  to  manipulate  prices  when \nthe market is competitive and prices are volatile.  \n\nPrice stability is essential if firms are to continue projects with their growers and growers are \nto  maintain  income  stability.  This  is  especially  true  in  the  early  stages  of  contract  framing. \nBoth companies and governments try to counter market volatility and find ways to stabilize \nprices for growers. A prescriptive formula  is helpful for sharing costs and benefits between \ngrowers and processors. Without acceptable and stable prices or credit provision, projects in \nless developed areas can fail, as exemplified in several cases in Thailand during the 1980s.  \n\nMany  farmers  have  voluntarily  opted  for  chemical-free  and  organic  production  for  health \nconcerns.  However  most  small  tangerine  growers  in  Northern  Thailand  experienced  low \nyields  and  undesirable  appearances,  and  thus  low  prices.  In  contrast  to  the  findings  of \nWiboonpongse  et  al.  (2006),  contract  organic  (Jasmine)  rice  farmers  in  Payao  Province \nenjoyed high yields and prices 30% higher than ordinary Jasmine rice. Setboonsarng et al. \n(2007)  reported  significantly  higher  profits  per  unit  of  land  and  higher  prices  for  contract \nfarmers in the initial stage of organic production after one to two years of starting than non-\ncontract (for conventional rice in Northeastern and Northern Thailand). \n\nVI. \n\nEFFECTIVENESS OF CONTRACT FARMING SCHEMES: \nSUCCESS AND FAILURE \n\nContract  farming  projects  have  had  mixed  results.  Here  we  present  several  cases  with \nfarmers\u2019 responses in the secondary stage of contract farming and the attitudes of growers \nin  Northern  Thailand.  Several  studies  in  the  1990s  reported  that  most  contract  farming \nschemes  had  failed,  with  forestry,  cashew  nuts  and  oil  palm  cited  as  examples  (Baumann \n2000;  Falvey  2002;  Glover  1992).  The  first  two  crops  were  introduced  to  farmers  who  had \nthe  least  resources  in  the  dry  land  of  the  Northeast,  while  oil  palm  became  a  rubber  crop \nalternative in the South. In some cases, early successes in contract forestry (eucalyptus in \ndry  land)  were  not  sustained  (Baumann  2000).  However,  a  global  rise  in  pulp  prices \nattracted large corporations (e.g., CP, Kaset Roong Ruang, Shell, and Siam Cement Group) \nand at least 15 Japanese and Taiwanese joint ventures.  \n\nMonopolistic  conditions  have  been  favorable  for  contract  farming  (Glover  1992),  whereas \ncompetitive  environments  have  not  been  conducive  to  contract  farming.  However,  one \nexception  is  vegetable  contract  farming  in  Northern  Thailand,  which  has  developed  within \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nthe  relatively  competitive  environment  of  input  markets.  Thai  farmers  are  able  to  acquire \ninput,  credit,  and  buyers  on  the  open  market  (Baumann  2000;  Wiboonpongse  et  al.  2007; \nWiboonpongse  and  Sriboonchitta  2007).  In  the  case  of  cashew  nuts,  the  Agricultural  Land \nReform Office, BAAC, and a private firm program was less successful. This program aimed \nto  cover  175,000  rai  (28,000  ha)  in  1990,  expand  to  300,000  rai,  and  include  more  than \n31,000  farm  households.  At  first  the  project  exceeded  its  target  but  was  halted  by  a  rapid \nspread  of  pests.  Poor  feasibility  analysis  and  an  absence  of  region-specific  research  had \nbearing  on  the  failure,  and  there  were  risks  that  disproportionately  affected  smallholders \n(Falvey 2002). Research on productivity improvement and cost reduction is necessary. \n\nThere  are  also  successful  cases.  Overall,  contract  farming  in  Thailand  has  been \nimplemented and managed differently from other countries, with very strong intervention and \npromotion  under  the  4-sector  Plan  as  well  as  Mekong  sub-regional  economic  cooperation. \nAgribusiness  has  received  substantial  incentives  and  promotion.  Since  Thailand  is  agro-\nexporting  country,  agribusiness  has  dominated  policy-making.  This  has  resulted  in  better \noverall  agricultural  growth  and  development  effects  through  the  shift  to  high  value  crops \n(Burch 1996; Benziger 1996 cited by Singh, 2004) \n\nIn the western region, sugar cane, baby corn and asparagus, and broiler and hog contracts \nhave  proven  successful.  With  baby  corn,  contracts  were  made  between  village  middlemen \nand  farmers,  with  middlemen  providing  farmers  with  seed,  fertilizer,  loans,  and  tractor \nservices.  Contracts  were  made  between  middlemen  and  farmers  but  not  middlemen  and \ncompanies  and  involved  guaranteed  minimum  prices  and  additional  prices  when  the \nprevailing  market  price  increased.  In  the  case  of  asparagus,  the  main  condition  of  the \ncontract is to guarantee a fixed price for the whole year for various grades. This is the same \nmodel  as  that  used  by  potato  contractors  in  Chiang  Mai  and  is  a  successful  example  of \nprivate-government-farmer cooperation (Naritoom 2000).  \n\nThailand is the world\u2019s second largest producer of Black Tiger shrimp. During the 5th and 6th \nNational  Development  Plans,  multinational  firms  like  Cargill  were  encouraged  to  invest  in \nsmallholders  financed  by  the  BAAC  and  other  banks.  Apparently,  returns  to  smallholders \nwere  substantial.  However,  there  is  need  to  assess  risk  due  to  accumulated  disease  and \nsocial impact concerning mangrove deforestation. Small growers preferred operating under \ncontract  farming  to  risk  taking  in  a  volatile  market.  They  even  rejected  a  cooperative \napproach  after  the  experience  of  poor  market  prices  due  to  inadequate  quality  control \n(Falvey 2002). \n\nIn  the  Northeast,  the  success  of  exports  depends  on  the  provision  of  irrigation  water. \nProduction can be extended during the wet season, and the introduction of dry season crops \nand  non-traditional  crops  of  high  marketability,  supported  by  technical  advice  under  a \ncontract  farming  scheme,  has  been  effective,  as  in  the  case  of  tomatoes  supported  by \nBAAC.  The  expansion  of  tomato  contracting  in  this  region  was  accompanied  by  disputes \nabout  spoilage,  factory  shutdowns,  and  other  problems,  but  they  were  resolved  through \nmutual-benefit  contracts.  The  case  highlights  the  viability  of  the  government-agribusiness-\nsmallholder  relationship  as  a  result  of  government  investment  in  necessary  infrastructure \nincluding  physical,  service,  and  coordination  support  (Poapongsakorn  et  al.  1995  cited  by \nFalvey, 2002). \n\nIn  the  North,  contract  farming  has  been  successful  in  such  crops  as  soybean,  baby  corn, \nsweet  corn,  potatoes,  tomatoes  and  eggplant,  as  well  as  vegetable  and  maize  seed.  The \nnumber of  vegetable processing firms  increased  from 34 (1988) to 61 (1994), and to 78 in \n2002. Statistics show that more farmers were entering contract farming beginning the early \n1990s  due  to  various  driving  forces.  Potato  contracts  received  the  most  development: \nproduction in Chiang Mai increased from 600 ha in 1983 to 1,927 ha. In 1994, and to 3,638 \nha  and  4,386  ha  in  the  2002\u20132003  and  2007\u20132008  crop  years.  Contract  production  has \nbeen expanded to six provinces in the North and another three provinces in the Northeast. \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nTotal production in Thailand in 2002\u20132003 and 2007\u20132008 reached 6,750 ha and 7,980 ha \nof harvested area, and 86,700 tons and 125,700 tons, respectively, for total output.  \n\nFarmers contracted companies through their groups. In the first stage of the contract, district \nagricultural extension officers had an active role in coordination and extension in the San Sai \ndistrict,  the  first  site  of  commercial  potato  production  in  Thailand.  The  government  has \npromoted such farmer organization in contract farming to better position farmers when they \ndeal  with  companies  and  for  credit  collateral  and  technical  assistance  from  firms  and \nuniversities. However, the successful role of the officers in San Sai with well-irrigated land is \nnot replicable in the adjacent district (Mae Rim) due to the local physical and socio-economic \nenvironment. Today, farmers in San Sai have turned to selling their potatoes to middlemen \nwho gather, produce and deliver to the companies. While the middlemen have contracts with \nfirms,  individual  farmers  prefer  taking  risks  for  higher  selling  prices.  The  companies  have \nadopted the contract approach to new farmers in other areas. \n\nSuccess and failure in contract farming is case by case. According to a CP executive, factors \nresponsible  for  poor  performance  in  a  contract  system  include  personnel  factors  and \nuncontrollable factors such as weather. Public policy and support also play significant roles. \nSuccess  stories  are  derived  from  a  \u201cwin-win\u201d  situation  where  all  key  determinants  are \nintegrated properly: production technology pre-and post-harvest, technology transfer (by the \ngovernment  or  private  sector),  trust  building,  pricing  policy,  financial  support  and  human \nresource development for both farmers and firms (Poonpiriyasup 2007). \n\nIn  contract  hybrid  corn  production  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Sub-region/ACMECS  countries, \nthe  CP  reported  that  Thai  growers  average  yield  was  second  (6.25  ton/ha)  after  the  PRC \n(6.75  ton/ha).  However,  Poonpiriyasup  (2007)  revealed  that  Thai  growers  enjoyed  the \nhighest  rate  of  return  on  investment  (ROI)  at  94%  whereas  the  PRC\u2019s  ROI  was  56%. \nContract  growers  in  other  countries  (Viet  Nam,  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic, and Myanmar) earned an ROI of 72%, 85%, and 87%, respectively. \n\nVII. \n\nFARMERS' ATTITUDES TOWARD CONTRACT FARMING  \n\nContract  farming  depends  on  the  satisfaction  of  both  farmers  and  firms,  with  profitability  a \nkey  component.  In  the  initial  stage,  farmers\u2019  perceptions  regarding  new  crops  and  their \nattitudes towards contract farming are important. This section presents results from a survey \nby Sribooncitta et al. (1996) in hopes that it may be helpful for agencies attempting contract \nfarming  elsewhere.  Most  of  the  contract  farmers  surveyed  (78%)  grew  only  one  contract \ncrop,  while  the  remainder  had  two  to  four  different  contract  crops.  The  survey  revealed \nprimary  reasons  that  farmers  participated  in  contract  farming.  Market  certainty  and  price \nstability were prime factors, as shown in Figure 2. \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nFigure 2: Farmers\u2019 reasons for participating in contract farming \n\n52\n\n46\n\n40\n\n35\n\n28\n\n1 = Market certainty \n2 = Price stability \n3 = Provision of input on credit \n4 = Neighbor gaining higher income \n5 = Income opportunity for tenant growers \n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5a\n\nSource: Sriboonchitta et al. (1996).  \n\n \n\nOther  reasons  included  lack  of  alternatives,  expectation  of  higher  prices,  etc.  In  addition, \nfrom  the  authors\u2019  survey  in  2004,  tenant  farmers  (40%  of  respondents)  felt  that  contract \nfarming  provided  them  good  opportunities  to  raise  their  income  as  labor  was  the  only \nresource they had.  \n\nOn  price  agreement,  one  would  expect  that  most  farmers  would  not  be  satisfied  with  the \nterms.  A  high  proportion  of  dissatisfaction  occurred  in  processing  vegetables  for  the \nJapanese  market  (cucumbers,  potatoes,  and  soybean  at  75%\u201367%).  Less  dissatisfaction \nwas found in the case  of maize seed (47.5%)  and tomatoes (49%)  where products served \ndomestic  markets.  Furthermore,  studies  revealed  that  new  crops  and  new  management \nrestrained farmers in continuing the contracts. In the early stage of contract farming, 35% of \nthe respondents felt that new crops were more complicated, while 43% felt the opposite and \n22% were indifferent.  \n\nAttitudes  were  affected  by  production  background  and  experience.  Experienced  farmers \nwere  likely  to  find  production  of  newly  introduced  Japanese  cucumbers  and  maize  seed \nrelatively easy (Wiboonpongse et al. 1998). Our 1994 survey found the main reason farmers \n(52%) kept contracts was high return from the crops relative to their other alternatives. Some \nfarmers (16%) indicated they did so despite not knowing other alternatives, while about 11% \nmaintained contracts because of market certainty. \n\nFirms usually stipulated production quotas on land for contract crops to maintain quality. The \naverage sizes of contract crops per household were only about half of what farmers desired \n(only  40%  of  the  farmers\u2019  land).  However,  the  restriction  has  been  relaxed  as  demand  for \nraw  materials  has  increased  and  farmers  have  become  more  experienced  (authors\u2019  2004 \nsurvey).  \n\nIn  a  contract  farming  arrangement,  firms  provided  key  inputs,  i.e.  selected  seeds  and \nmaterial,  in  order to meet consumer preferences. Fertilizer  and other chemical  inputs were \nstrictly  controlled  to  ensure  effective  results  and  control  residual  levels.  All  inputs  were \nprovided  on  credit  through  cooperatives,  groups,  or  middlemen.  On  average,  80%  of  the \nrespondents were happy with advance credit as they did not need cash investment.  \n\nMost farmers had no information about the price of seed (84%), but knew about fertilizer and \nchemical  prices  (68%)  since  the  latter  was  available  in  the  markets.  Farmers  who  found \ninput prices higher than market prices (31%) or inputs were of poor quality (9%) were mostly \nmaize seed farmers who obtained inputs from the Land Development Cooperatives. Despite \ngood government services in  Northern areas, the survey also reported 46% of the farmers \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nhad  not  received  any  services,  but  about  the  same  proportion  received  production  advice \n(43%),  input  supply  (7%)  and  meetings  with  farmers  (3%).  On  average,  40%  of  the \nrespondents were satisfied with officials\u2019 services. \n\nFarmers  also  identified  the  types  of  information  and  knowledge  most  important  to  them: \nappropriate  application  of  fertilizer  and  chemicals  (38%),  alternative  crops  with  available \nmarkets (20%),  methods  for  increasing  productivity  (17%),  appropriate  production  methods \n(12%) and others (13%). \n\nVIII. \n\nINCOME RISK AND EFFICIENCY \n\nContract farming provided growers with an assured market, stable income, access to firms' \nservices, ease of credit and technical knowledge, and it provides agro-industrial firms with an \nassured supply of good quality raw material at less fixed investment and low cost. Specific \noutcomes  of  contract  farming  on  these  aspects  are  discussed  below  and  are  based  on \nWiboonpongse et al., (1998) except where indicated otherwise. \n\nIn  the  case  of  Northern  Thailand  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  half  of  the  farmers \nearned off-farm  income before and after starting contract farming.  After starting a  contract, \n74%  of  the  respondents  enjoyed  higher  household  income  while  5%  reported  reduced \nincomes. Despite the higher incomes, some farmers (26%) incurred losses due to production \nand quality risk (all contract crops) and market risk (tomatoes). The major problem was crop \ndamage due to flood and diseases (Sriboonchitta et al. 1996).  \n\nA more specific comparison was limited to potatoes and tomatoes, which had dual markets. \nTable  1  shows  net  returns  and  variations  per  rai,  (1600  sq.  meters  or  6.25  rai  =  1  ha)  of \ncontract  and  non-contract  crops.  On  average,  non-contract  crops  provided  slightly  higher \nincomes  (2.5%\u201310%).  Price  instability  on  open  markets  for  potatoes  averaged  185%  over \nthat of contract prices.  \n\nIncome discrepancies from the open market reflected price risk and production risk for both \ncrops  since  the  prices  were  determined  by  varying  market  supply-and-demand.  However, \ncontract  tomato  farmers  had  higher  income  variations  than  their  counterparts  due  to  the \ninformality  of  contract  agreements  and  uncommitted  responsibility  of  the  processing  firm. \nPotato prices were more under control, even though they varied. In the end, income variation \ncame mainly from yield risk since prices were guaranteed and made known to the farmers in \nadvance.  \n\nTable 1: Net return per rai from 1984/85 to 1990/91(in Baht/rai) \n\nCrop \n\n1984\u2013\n1985 \n\n1985\u2013\n1986 \n\n1986\u2013\n1987 \n\n1987\u2013\n1988 \n\n1988\u2013\n1989 \n\n1989\u2013\n1990 \n\n1990\u2013\n1991 \n\nAverage \n\nCV \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n7,790 \n\n5,357 \n\n7,268 \n\n13,862 \n\n8,469 \n\n0.438\n\n3,931 \n\n5,346 \n\n1,620 \n\n15,288  12,847 \n\n- \n\n14,395 \n\n8,676 \n\n0.818\n\nContract tomato  3,435 \n\n960 \n\n6,874 \n\n4,424 \n\n8,623 \n\n2,910 \n\n5,686 \n\n4,658 \n\n0.556\n\n6,120 \n\n4,279 \n\n4,536 \n\n4,381 \n\n3,710 \n\n6,095 \n\n6,706 \n\n5,118 \n\n0.226\n\nContract \npotatoes \n\nNon-contract \npotatoes \n\nNon-contract \ntomatoes \n\nSource: Gedgaew (1993), Note: CV = coefficient of variation \n\nEconomic  efficiency  here  refers  to  the  combined  effects  of  production  and  allocated \nefficiencies  in  order  to  minimize  unit  cost.  (Production  cost  comparisons  between  contract \nand non-contract were not available in other studies, so the conclusion should not be over \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\ngeneralized.)  Unit  costs  for  contract  potatoes  and  tomatoes  were  lower  than  those  of  non-\ncontract  farms.  Contract  farmers  outperformed  the  non-contract  farmers.  Farmers  of  both \ntypes proved to be profit maximizers under their different production conditions. \n\nSukasem  (1992)  found  that  in  contract  soybean,  non-contract  soybean,  and  both  types  of \ntomatoes  and  potatoes,  farmers  applied  economic  rationales.  They  allocated  their  main \nresources optimally in response to output-input prices.  \n\nContributions  from  agro-processing  firms  in  productivity  and  quality  improvement  were \nsignificant.  The  frozen  food  firm's  new  variety  of  soybean  raised  yields  from  800  kg/rai \n(1991\u20131992)  to  1,300\u20131,700  kg/rai  (1993).  For  informal  contracts  like  tomatoes,  varieties \nused  by  farmers  in  the  open  market  were  those  once  introduced  by  contract  firms. \nTherefore,  fresh  tomatoes  available  in  the  market  were  processing  types  and  consumers \ncould hardly find table tomatoes. \n\nA  contract  system  can  boost  farmers\u2019  production  efficiency.  Wongwiwat  et  al.  (2007) \nreported  in  their  analysis  that  potato  yields  of  Chiang  Mai  growers  could  significantly \nincrease yields by 43% compared to those of non-contract growers. The know-how followed \nby education is a dominant attribute of efficiency, while diseconomy of scale was observed \nfor potato production size rising beyond 1.4 ha. (Wongwiwat et al. 2007). \n\nBoth  farmers  and  processing  firms  have  had  a  long  process  of  learning  and  adjusting  to \nproduce raw materials of a standard quality. Contract farmers have learned to accept criteria \nfor \"quality,\u201d while farmers in general, who sold their ungraded produce in the open markets, \nwere  less  familiar  with  the  concept.  In  rigid  contracts  such  as  soybean  and  Japanese \ncucumbers,  contract  farmers  realized  that  their  income  depended  on  the  quality  of  grades \nthey produced. Fifty percent of new farmers, after training, can deliver high-grade produce. \nPresently, experienced farmers and additional new farmers, who grasp the concept quickly, \nunderstand the value of quality. \n\nAgro-processing  firms  have  been  careful  in  screening  farmers  they  contract.  Diligent  and \nhonest farmers received first priority, which is still practiced. Farmers\u2019 production of contract \ncrops  was  limited  to  ensure  quality. Field  supervision  helped  monitor  production  for  quality \nproduce  and  provide  regular  checks  of  predicted  total  production.  However,  the  latter \npractice did not ensure supply of raw materials. The firms, through middlemen, terminated a \ncontract if a farmer was found to secretly sell his/her produce on the open market or to other \nfirms. \n\nIX. \n\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMERS TO GAIN NEW KNOWLEDGE \n\nFarmers  under  contract  for  soybean,  cucumbers,  and  maize  seed  learned  new  knowledge \ndirectly from firms, while potato and tomato farmers had experience and knowledge prior to \nthe  contracts.  Potato  farmers  also  received  knowledge  from  universities  under  the  firms' \nsupport.  Knowledge  included  fertilizer  and  chemical  applications  and  intensive  production \nscheduling  that  could  be  transferred  to  other  crops.  Manarungsan  and  Suwanjindar  (1992) \nreport that oil palm, pineapple, and asparagus farmers gained new technical knowledge from \ninput suppliers.  \n\nContract  farming  can  lessen  farmers'  entrepreneurial  ability  even  if  they  gain  management \nskills. Farmers under contract for prawns (Office of Agricultural Economics 1989) and ducks  \n(Office  of  Agricultural  Economics  1993)  expressed  that  they  lost  their  freedom  in  farm \nmanagement.  This  hindered  their  knowledge  development  and  decision-making  ability. \nAdvantages  and  disadvantages  are \nin  several  contract-farming  studies \nindicated \n(Wiboonpongse et al. 1998). \n\nThe  situation  has  changed.  Wiboonpongse  and  Sriboonchitta  (2007)  finds  that  potato \ngrowers  in  the  oldest  production  sites  have  accumulated  production  know-how  and \nsuccessfully  innovated  seed  storage  in  place  of  seed  supplied  by  contract  firms.  With \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\naccumulated marketing knowledge and inputs from local stores and brokers, growers have \nbeen  cultivating  early  potatoes  to  earn  favorable  prices  at  14  baht/kg  on  the  open  market; \nwhen the normal harvesting date approaches, prices revert to the contract price (8 baht/kg). \nSeed storage technology has allowed growers in many production areas to decide whether \nto grow with or without contracts.  \n\nTable 2 illustrates experienced potato growers who are able to enjoy margins twice as high \nas less experienced (non-contract) growers in similar production environments. \n\nTable 2: Comparison of contract and non-contract potato production in Chiang Mai \nprovince (2006) \n\n \nCF in Chiang Mai \nNCF in Chiang Mai \n\nNo. of \ngrowers \n30 \n34 \n\nYield/rai \n(kg) \n\nTotal cost \n(Baht/rai) \n16,133.39 2,407.23\n18,596.47 2,745.59\n\nSeed cost \n(% to total \ncost) \n33.25 \n14.93 \n\nPrice \nreceived \n(Baht/kg)\n8.22 \n9.64 \n\nMargin to \nTotal \ngrowers \nrevenue \n(Baht/rai) \n(Baht/rai) \n19,779.43  3,646.04 \n26,462.63  7,866.15 \n\nAverage \ncost \n(Baht/kg)\n6.70 \n6.77 \n\nNote: area is expressed in rai (6.25 rai = 1 ha); income is in baht/year (40 baht = US$1) \nCF = Contract farming, (new/less experienced growers)  \nNCF = Non-contract (experienced growers) \nSource: Wiboonpongse et al. (2007) \n\nX. \n\nCONTRIBUTION TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT \n\nLiterature in the early 1990s indicated contract farming had not done very well or even failed \nin  Thailand  (Glover  1992;  also  cited  by  Baumann,  2000),  presenting  an  inaccurate  picture \nwhen  considering  the  relationships  between  specific  company  contracts  and  farmers  or \ngroups.  Farmers  do  seek  favorable  terms  that  they  perceive  to  be  better  for  them.  In  a \nbroader  sense,  contract  farming  in  Thailand,  especially  in  the  North,  had  been  increasing \nprior  to  the  economic  crisis  of  1997.  The  trend  continued  after  the  economic  recovery,  as \nconfirmed by expansion of agro-industrial firms and production areas.  \n\nContract  farming  has  been  a  key  element  of  the  Thai  Government\u2019s  development  plan, \nreflecting  a  strategy  of  \u201cprivate-led  integrated  agricultural  development\u201d  (Glover  1992,  in \nSingh 2004; Wiboonpongse et al. 1998). However, Siamwalla (1996) stated that in the past, \nthe government has relied too much on the private sector to provide new technology through \ncontract  farming.  This  was  successful  in  some  cases,  but  not  all.  Regardless,  the  private \nsector in Thailand has played a significant if not leading role, especially when interacting with \nfarmers  (e.g.,  the  use  of  fertilizers,  seed,  and  chemicals)  due  to  the  profit  motives  of  input \nsuppliers and contractors.  \n\nGovernment  agencies  should  play  a  role  in  directing  and  facilitating  the  private  sector\u2019s \nimplementation  of  technological  transfer  for  fair  business,  as  it  had  successfully  done  with \npotato  contracts.  Universities  and  research  centers,  especially  the  National  Biotechnology \nCenter (BIOTEC) and Thailand Research Fund (TRF), often contribute basic knowledge for \nthe private sector\u2019s R&D. Currently, policies of BIOTEC and TRF encompass public-private \nresearch collaboration in order to answer the needs of business. \n\nWe agree that contracts can be unfair. In this regard, contract farming does not seem to be a \ndesirable  means  for  rural  development.  However  competitive  environments  within  and \namong sectors (potatoes, seed, vegetables) induce more alternatives for growers when firms \nhave to compete for contract farmers and land. \n\nThere is no indication that the poorest farmers are being excluded in the firms\u2019 selection of \ncontract farmers, despite opinions to the contrary. Wiboonpongse and Sriboonchitta (1995) \nfound that the farmers operating under contracts were generally smaller than non-contract. \nMost  were  small  farmers;  their  growing  area  was  about  half  the  farm  size  of  those  in  the \nUpper  North  region  (3.74  to  4.8  rai  for  contract  farming  and  4.7\u20135.82  rai  for  non-contract \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nfarming). The average size of cultivated land for contract crops is usually limited for quality \ncontrol. Potato contracts are an exception (Wongwiwat et al. 2007), possibly because potato \nproduction is established and commonplace. \n\nIn  annual  crops  like  vegetables,  firms  value  growers\u2019  diligence,  hard  work  habits  and \nhonesty.  Tenant  farmers  have  an  equal  chance  to  obtain  the  same  quota  providing  they \npossess  sufficient  labor  and  crop  experience.  The  situation  can  differ  in  forestry  and \nlivestock  (broilers  and  hogs),  where  land  and  capital  investment  in  animals  is  substantially \nhigher \n\nAs No.14 on the list of the world food exporting countries (Food and Agriculture Organization \n2005), Thailand is the leading net exporter of food in Asia. Safety and environmental issues \nof food consumption in the EU, US and Japan require products to conform to standards such \nas  ISO  14000,  Codex  Alimentarius  Standard,  and  in  general,  HACCP.  To  meet  these \nstandards  and  be  competitive,  Thailand  must  adopt  cost-effective  production  and \nmanagement  along  the  whole  supply  chain.  Sriwichailamphan  (2007)  reports  contract \ngrowers of pineapple, broilers and shrimp have adopted good agricultural practices (GAP) or \ngood animal husbandry practice (GAHP) (also Code of Conduct for shrimp) due to contract \nfarming  advice  from  relevant  companies.  This  factor  was  most  likely  to  be  taken  seriously \nand  adopted  when  compared  to  other  factors  (farmers\u2019  environmental  awareness,  animal \nsurvival rate, or pressure from the importing countries).  \n\nXI. \n\nWELFARE: THE MISSING DIMENSION IN CONTRACT FARMING \n\nFarmers  in  developing  countries  belong  to  the  informal  labor  sector,  by  definition  of  the \nInternational Labor Organization. In most countries, social welfare schemes do not extend to \nbenefit farmers (only 20% of informal labor around the globe has adequate social welfare). In \nThailand,  it  is  only  recently  that  Thai  citizens  have  received  very  modest  social  or  public \nhealth  insurance.  As  for  the  social  welfare  policy,  the  Thai  government  targeted  only  0.3 \nmillion  informal  labor  workers  in  the  agricultural  sector  to  be  covered  in  2006.  In  Northern \nThailand, 86% of the farmers reported belonging to least one of these schemes. None of the \ncontract  farmers  in  Thailand  and  elsewhere  receive  welfare  benefits  from  formal  contract \nfirms.  Interviews  with  the  management  of  international  firms  confirmed  there  was  no \nprovision of health insurance etc. in the contract. \n\nAs  contract  farming  has  been  expanding  in  Thailand  and  extending  into  new  areas  in  the \nGreater Mekong Sub-region, it is imperative to consider the welfare issue in addition to fair \ntrade  and  market  access  aspects.  This  is  especially  recommended  for  projects  under \ndevelopment  of  agencies  like  ADB  and  the  Regional  Economic  Cooperation\u2014e.g.,  the \nAyeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS).  \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nXII. \n\nCONCLUSION: LESSONS LEARNED \n\nThis  section  summarizes  lessons  drawn  from  the  authors\u2019  reviews  as  they  relate  to  this \npaper. The conclusions are subject to the different results of various case studies, which are \ninfluenced  by  specific  environments.  However,  general  directions  one  may  consider  when \nimplementing CF in particular settings can reasonably be stated as follows:  \n\n1.  At  the  initial  stage  of  contract  farming,  it  is  necessary  that  both  contractors  and \ngrowers  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  concept  and  roles  they  play  in  an \nagreement.  Rigid  contracts  are  untenable,  as  farmers  do  not  fully  understand \nconcepts, standards of quality, or loss due to late or untimely delivery.  \n\n2.  The rigidity of contract terms, which is for fairness to both parties, does not apply to \nall  types  of  commodities;  it  depends  on  local  settings.  Policies  should  be  directed \ntowards encouraging competition among firms for growers. \n\n3.  Farmers  need  time  to  adapt  to  technology  and  new  habits.  Contract  crops  usually \nrequire  precise  working  schedules  and  intensive  management.  Farmers  may  not \nobtain  desirable  returns  in  the  first  year.  Yield  and  quality  risk  may  discourage \nfarmers\u2019  continuation  of  contracts.  Contract  agreements  designed  to  spread  risks \namong  parties  have  been  appreciated,  as  in  the  case  of  frozen  vegetable  crops. \nMinimum  returns  with  intensive  and  close  supervision  by  firms  to  avoid  crop  failure \ncan be incentives.  \n\n4.  The  public  sector  has  a  role  to  play  in  technological  and  institutional  development. \nGovernment should plan incentives they can manage. Universities, with the support \nof firms and local officials, can provide regular training in the early stages.  \n\n5.  Although  agribusiness  took  the  lead  in  contract  farming,  government  policies  have \nprovided  a  favorable  environment  for  domestic  and  foreign  investment  through \ntaxation,  financing,  and  the  4-sector  plan.  For  example,  the  success  of  tomato \ncontracts in less developed areas (Northeast) was due to irrigation and infrastructure \nimprovement,  understanding  by  farmers,  efficient  coordination,  transparency  and \ntimely supervision.  \n\n6.  For  annual  crops,  contract  farming  in  more  developed  areas  (North)  appears  to  be \neffective for linking smallholders to the market. Farmer selection is unrelated to land \nsize. Tenant farmers have an equal chance to join the project. \n\n7.  With rising land prices and a competitive global market, firms need to minimize costs \nfor given quality. Competition has led to competitive prices for potatoes, soybean and \neggplant.  There  is  a  need  for  government  biotechnology  research  into  quality, \nefficiency  improvement,  and  cost  reduction.  Domestic  firms  should  also  conduct \nadaptive research for specific localities. \n\n8.  Farmers  need  information  on  risk  management  so  they  can  allocate  risk  between \ncontract and non-contract cultivation. Innovation (e.g., cold storage for seed) allows \nfarmers to cultivate outside the contract even for the same firms and gain high prices \nfor  early  harvest.  In  this  case,  contracts  are  no  longer  the  best  choice  for  potato \ngrowers at some sites. \n\n9.  Commitment  from  local  officials  is  a  key  element  of  success  in  the  early  stages  of \ncontract  farming.  There  should  be  a  non-financial  incentive  system  to  encourage \nofficials\u2019 involvement. \n\n10. Contract farming can be promising for agro-industry development. The quality of farm \nproduce  can  be  rapidly  improved  through  contract  farming  to  meet  global  market \nstandards. This will require thorough effort from local agencies. It is also important to \ncontrol exploitation of farmers by private firms. \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\n11. Price stabilization can help alleviate income risk; however, firms\u2019 quasi-monopolistic \npower  could  dampen  productivity.  This  role  could  be  better  if  firms  apply  more \ncompetitive pricing. \n\n12. Thailand\u2019s experience reveals that contract farming has been a successful means for \nthe  poor  farmer  majority  to  participate  in  the  market.  There  is  the  potential  for \nincreasing farmers\u2019 economic capacity by contracting in an open market. \n\n13. Contract  farming  is  a  commercial  activity,  and  none  of  the  reviewed  literature \nindicates  growers\u2019  welfare  or  health  issues.  Therefore  arrangements  need  to \nconsider liability and health aspects for participating farmers. \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 112 \n\n \n\nSriboonchitta and Wiboonpoongse \n\nREFERENCES \n\nBaumann, P. 2000.

Special \nattention  is  given  to  roles  played  by  government  in  the  initial  stage  of  contract  farming \ndevelopment.

In the long run, small farmers were able to accumulate \nproduction  and  management  skills,  thus  improving  their  bargaining  position.
