Asia\u2019s \nurbanization is unique as it is urbanizing at a pace faster than any other region, resulting in an \nunprecedented growth in the number of urban dwellers and increased number of densely populated \nmegacities. The global development challenges and in particular Asia\u2019s urban challenges are daunting \nand often conflicting, with a rising demand for resources and services, growing consumption patterns, \ndepleting  natural  resources,  increasing  air  pollution,  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  and  increasing \nvulnerable population exposed to climate disruptions and the rise in extreme weather events. Asian \ncities have to cope with the pressure on physical infrastructure, rapid environmental degradation, \nincreasing inequality, and a reduction in social cohesion.  \n \nWith about 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) today coming from the urban areas, the quality and \nefficiency  of  Asian  cities  will  determine  the  region\u2019s  long-term  productivity  and  overall  stability \n(Lindfield and Steinberg 2011). Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas but \ncities are also resource intensive, consuming 85% of energy, and they are polluting (Lindfield and \nSteinberg 2011). Sixty-seven percent of Asian (vs. 11% non-Asian) cities fail to meet European Union air \nquality standard (ADB 2012). Asia alone is responsible for 35% of carbon dioxide emissions. Air \npollution can have estimated 2%-4% negative impact on GDP.  \n \nUnprecedented growth. Asia\u2019s urbanization is unprecedented\u2014leading to enormous challenges but \nwith an opportunity to exploit its latecomer\u2019s advantage and unique features. From 1980 to 2010, Asia \nadded more than a billion people to its cities, more than all other regions combined, with a further \n2\nbillion set to be city dwellers by 2040.  In 2010, for the first time in history, Asia became home to \nalmost half of the global urban population, with 43% of its population living in urban areas. Forty-four \nmillion people are added to city population in Asia every year\u2014equivalent to 120,000 people each day \nwho require construction of more than 20,000 new dwellings, 250 kilometers of new roads and water \n3\ninfrastructure to supply more than 6 megaliters of potable water.  This massive scale of urbanization is \n                                                            \n1   S. Chand Sandhu and R. Naik Singru. 2014.

In 2010, the urban share of Asia\u2019s population was still only 43%, compared to 52% \nworldwide. Asia\u2019s urbanization is now rapid and fast paced, with the PRC transitioning from 10% of its \npopulation in urban areas to 50% urban in just 60 years, versus 210 years in Latin America and the \nCaribbean, 150 years in Europe, and 105 years in North America. Asia\u2019s urban population is projected to \ncontinue growing faster than that of any other region (ADB 2012).  \n \nHighest densities. In total, 17 of the 25 cities with the highest population densities and 8 of the top 10 \ndensest cities are in Asia. This growth is unique and not comparable to any other region as Asia is \nhome to almost half of all urbanites with an urban population that is more than three times that of \nEurope, the region with the second largest urban population. From 2010 to 2050 the urban population \nin Asia will double and by then 65% of Asia\u2019s population will be urban (ADB 2011). By 2050, the urban \nshare in Asia is projected to reach 63%, gaining on but still below the 67% global average. Thus Asian \ncities will likely grow bigger and have even higher density. \n \nNew emerging urban forms. New forms of urbanization are emerging with mega-regions, peri-urban \nareas, urban corridors, satellite cities, clustered city-regions. Large cities are spreading out, engulfing \nnearby towns, leading to continuous belts of settlement (UN-Habitat 2009). In 2010, 12 out of 23 of \nworld\u2019s megacities were in Asia. 4  \n \nURBANIZATION AND VULNERABILITY  \n \nCities are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change particularly rising sea level and inundation. \nVulnerability will rise with urbanization. Many of Asia\u2019s largest cities, located on or close to coastal \nareas, will be heavily affected by rising sea levels and violent weather with a projected 410 million urban \n5\nAsians at risk of coastal flooding by 2025.   In 2000, 18% of Asian urbanites were at risk of coastal \nflooding, versus 11% for Africa, 8% for Latin America, and 7% for Europe. In 2010, of total urban \npopulation, 251 million Asians were exposed to this risk, compared with 40 million Europeans, 32 \nmillion Africans, and 24 million Latin Americans. Manila with nearly 12 million inhabitants is the largest \nurban agglomeration at high risk of cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. Four other large coastal cities in \nAsia are at similar high risks of cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. Over 300 million were already at risk \nof  coastal  flooding  in  2010,  and  about  250  million  at  risk  of  inland  flooding  such  as  Bangkok \nexperienced in 2012. The number affected by inland flooding is expected to rise, to roughly 350 million \nby 2025. More than half the population in large cities like Ho Chi Minh City is at risk from both inland \nand coastal flooding. The most vulnerable and excluded in these situations are the urban poor. \n \n  \n   \n                                                            \n4    Cities with more than 10 million population are termed as megacities. \n5   United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2012.

Manila: \n \n \nURBANIZATION\u2013POVERTY NEXUS \n \nLarge disparities have emerged as poverty has urbanized with over 200 million people living in poverty \nin Asia\u2019s cities and many more are vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks (ADB 2012). The \nWorld Bank Global Monitoring Report (GMR) finds that urban poverty rates are significantly lower \nthan rural poverty rates and that urban populations have far better access to the basic public services \ndefined by the Millennium Development Goals, such as access to safe water and sanitation facilities, \neven though within urban areas asymmetries in access are large (World Bank 2013). If the forces of \nurbanization are not managed speedily and efficiently, growth of informal settlements can overwhelm \ncity growth, exacerbate urban poverty, and derail Millennium Development Goal achievements. Asian \ncities will likely grow bigger and have even higher density. Although more than half of the megacities \nwill be in Asia, a strong focus on the secondary cities will be required as they expand rapidly.  \n \n   \n ", "4   ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n \nUrban\u2013 Rural Poverty  \n \nWith growth and urbanization, poverty also urbanizes. People are located along a continuous rural\u2013\nurban spectrum, and large cities are not necessarily places where the urban poor are concentrated. \nSmaller towns matter greatly for urban poverty reduction and service delivery. According to the GMR, \nit was evidenced in a study of eight developing  countries, that while the urban population was \nconcentrated in the largest cities, incidence of urban poverty was dispersed along a continuum of \n6\nmedium, small, and extra small towns.  Poverty rates measured as a share of the population below \n$1.25 a day are falling in both urban and rural areas but are lower in urban area. Yet the GMR research \nin India indicated that while poverty is primarily a rural phenomenon at the aggregate level, urban \npoverty is becoming a larger problem (World Bank, 2013). Similarly, urban poverty is on the rise in the \nPhilippines though two-thirds of the poor still live in rural areas and the rural poverty incidence is \nhigher than the national average (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014). The GMR found that not only is the \nincidence of poverty higher in small cities and towns than in the large urban areas, but these smaller \nurban centers also account for a larger share of the urban poor (World Bank 2013). In India, it was \nnoted that among urban areas, poverty rates were highest in small towns (population less than \n50,000), at 30%, compared with 15% in large cities (population of 1 million or more). The size of the \ncities in smaller countries is comparable to small towns in large countries; hence the definition of urban \npoverty is essentially a function of the scale of the cities under discussion.  \n \nDimensions of Urban Poverty \n \nUrbanization provides greater employment opportunities. Urban productivity is more than 5.5 times \nthat of rural areas (ADB 2012). However rising incomes in urban areas are also accompanied by a \ngrowing disparity. This is stronger in urban areas due to the income differentials. However poverty has \nother dimensions besides income differentials. The dimensions of urban poverty (Figure 1) annotate \n7\nthe conditions that have a direct or indirect impact on the quality of life for the urban poor.  Unless \nalternative approaches to address urban poverty are put in place, the poor will remain the most \nvulnerable.  \n \n   \n                                                            \n6   World  Bank.  2013.

Enabling  Inclusive  Cities:  Toolkit  for  Inclusive  Urban \nDevelopment. Manila: ADB. Diagram is based on World Bank. 2002. A Sourcebook for Poverty Reduction Strategies. Vol. 2. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n \nMigration  is  the  major  driver  of  urbanization  in  Asia.  Migrants  are  attracted  to  cities  with  an \nexpectation of improved conditions of living. However perceptions vary greatly from the reality. The \nquality of life experienced by the urban poor can be far below that in the rural areas. Urban poverty \nincidence in the Philippines has steadily declined with the lowest rate (10.4% in 2006) for Metro \nManila, the most urbanized region, yet the absolute number of urban poor continues to rise. A high \ndemand for land for development leads to a worsening access to land and housing. Land prices in the \ngrowing city of Mandalay in Myanmar are much higher than might be expected for a city of a similar \nsize in the rest of Southeast Asia.  \n \nFurthermore, low supply of affordable public housing creates urban sprawl in megacities such as Metro \nManila.  Policies  created  to  alleviate  situations  are  often  counterproductive.  Developers  in  the \nPhilippines are required to provide 20% affordable housing units for every development they construct. \nHowever, there is no spatial binding to this regulation (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014). The developers \ncan provide these units anywhere in the city or outside the city boundaries leading to high scale \ndevelopments  in  the  city  core  and  affordable  or  low-income  units  outside  the  city  with  poor \nconnectivity and a lack of access to employment. These policies beget informal settlements as the \nrelocated people come back to the city closer to the centers of employment. Though the share of the \nurban population living in informal settlements in the Philippines declined from 54.3% in 1990 to 43.7% \n ", "6   ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n \nin 2009, the absolute number of inhabitants living in such settlements has steadily increased indicating \na need to address urban renewal through targeted investments (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014).  \n \nInformal settlements are often built in high-risk areas with no access to basic urban services such as \nwater supply, sanitation, and solid waste facilities. With the growing intensity and frequency of natural \ndisasters such as flooding, cyclones, and typhoons, this urban poor population is vulnerable to greater \nrisks. Though access to basic services in informal settlements has tended to improve over time, \ntypically areas such as front railways and riverbanks are making provision of basic urban services \nproblematic  in  these  settlements.  Worsening  access  to  services  contributes  to  overcrowded \nunhygienic living conditions and environmental degradation including pollution of water bodies such \nas rivers, canals, and lakes. Furthermore, a large portion of the urban population lives barely above the \npoverty line, and these individuals are vulnerable to slipping back below it due to loss of employment, \nillness, natural disasters, or other factors affecting income levels.  \n \nThe safety nets in the rural areas\u2014ability to grow food, access to natural resources, proximity of family \nand friends, among others\u2014enable the rural poor to cope through crisis. However, in urban situations, \nmore  income  is  spent  on  survival  services  such  as  water,  food,  housing  rent,  and  commuting. \nInadequate housing, tenure insecurity, precarious living conditions, risk to disasters for settlements in \nlow lying and hazard prone areas, inadequate access to water and sanitation, lack of access to solid \nwaste facilities, exposure to hazardous chemical waste due to proximity to industries, exposure to air \nand noise pollution, exposure to food contamination, food insecurity, and malnutrition are some of the \nfactors that make urban poverty more acute than rural poverty. \n \nFigure 2: External Factors Affecting Urban Migrant Population \n \nSource: Author\u2019s analysis. \n ", "Regional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development  7 \n \n5.  SPATIAL DIMENSIONS \n \nNew forms of urbanization are emerging with mega-regions, peri-urban areas, urban corridors, satellite \ncities, clustered city-regions. A total urban population of 3.3 billion is unevenly distributed across the \nworld in urban agglomerations of different sizes. More than 52% of the world\u2019s urban population and \n51% of urban population in developing countries reside in cities and towns of less than 500,000 people \n(UN-Habitat 2009). Large cities are spreading out, engulfing nearby towns, leading to continuous belts  \nof settlement. In 2010, 12 out of 23 of world\u2019s megacities were in Asia. 8  By 2025, the number of \nmegacities in Asia is expected to increase to 21 out of a global total of 37. The additional Asian cities \ninclude: Chongqing, Tianjin, and Wuhan in the PRC; Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad in India; \nJakarta in Indonesia; Bangkok in Thailand; and Lahore in Pakistan. In 2025 it is expected that more than \n37 megacities worldwide and 22 of those will be in Asia while there are expected to be more than 500 \ncities with more than 1 million inhabitants (ADB 2012). Unplanned urbanization through megacity \nexpansion creates many problems for poverty reduction and inclusive growth.  \n \nForms of Urban Expansion  \n \nWith  economic  and  demographic  growth,  the  urban  agglomerations  expand  spatially\u2014vertically \nthrough urban densification and horizontally through metropolitanization, peri-urbanization and urban \nsprawl. These spatial forms of physical expansion have an impact on the ability of the city to meet the \nneeds of its expanding population. Increasingly, urban managers and planners are grappling with \nproviding urban infrastructure and services to an expanding population spread across new spatial \nforms.

Socio-spatial  transformations  in  the  developing \ncountries are primarily in the direction of spatial segregation, fragmentation, and specialization of \nfunctions and land-uses in cities (Naik Singru 2007). With the push factor being greater than the pull \nfactor, there is likely to be an increase in migration to the urban centers of rural labor in search of \nlivelihoods that sustain not only the migrating population but also their rural families left behind in the \nvillages. Though the cost of city living is too high to support an entire family in the city, the rural \nhouseholds find the meager remittance amount sufficient to sustain themselves in the villages (Naik \nSingru 2008b). Thus, in an increasingly global and interlinked economy, the rural and urban are no ", "Regional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development  9 \n \nlonger distinctly separate economic zones. The interdependence of the urban-rural economies and its \nconsequences necessitates an increased interest in urban-rural linkages that can help in redefining \nurban development policy (Naik Singru 2008). Urbanization has abetted growth but begets inequality. \nInequality in the urban space is experienced through the lack of access to shelter and services. In many \ncities in developing countries, spatial forms are largely driven by the efforts of low-income households \nto secure land that is affordable and in a reasonable location, often in peri-urban areas where the rural \nareas merge with the expanding cities.  \n \nA better urban\u2013rural integration and small towns development can be a driver of change to address \nmany problems of poverty, migration, and environmental degradation in Asia. Sattherthwaite and \nTacoli (2003) have documented well the crucial role small and intermediate urban centers can have in \nthe economic development of their surrounding region: for example, local urban markets can link \nproducers to national and international markets and thereby increase rural incomes; the concentration \nof the production and distribution of goods and services in local urban centers can decrease costs and \nimprove access; and the demand for nonfarm workers can improve rural households\u2019 incomes and \ndecrease migration pressure on the larger urban centers. Urban centers such as towns, market towns, \nsecondary cities, and megacities progressively scale up the connectivity links of transport and services \nfor the supply\u2013chain management.  \n \nEnhancing urban\u2013rural linkages is mutually beneficial as rural areas are supply sites and producers of \nfood, material, natural resources, labor, as well as sites of recreational and health tourism particularly in \nthe Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam. Economies that depend on nature, such as fishing, and recreational and \nhealth tourism require better connectivity and transport infrastructure to exploit its commercial value. \nThese  are  seasonal  and  increasingly  fragile  economies  in  coastal  areas  exposed  to  increasing \nenvironmental impacts and climate induced events.  \n \nFacilitating movement of people, goods, services, natural produce, and resources requires better \ntransport infrastructure and connectivity. This includes provision of facilities and telecommunication \ninfrastructure that enables rural populations to access information and services to meet the needs of \nthe urban markets to gain a fair and faster compensation for their services while based in their rural \nsettings. Furthermore, the reduced need for travel with telecommunications and increased livelihood \nopportunities in rural areas can contribute to environmental, social and economic co-benefits.  \n \n \nURBANIZATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,  \nTHE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND INDIA \n \nUnderstanding Urban \n \nUrban is defined within the geographical context of a country. It can be a misnomer if used as a \ncomparator between countries that are small in population and geographic area such as the Mekong \ncountries, with those that are large in both population and area such as the PRC and India. As analyzed \nby the GMR, small towns in small countries are significantly smaller than the small towns in large \ncountries (World Bank 2013). Many small countries do not have a megacity, and nearly all large \ncountries have many large cities of various sizes as well as one or several megacities. It is difficult to \nmake accurate international comparisons of the proportion of nations\u2019 population living in small urban \ncenters defined by their population size because each nation has its own criteria for determining when \n ", "10   ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n \na  settlement  is  large  enough  to  be  classified  as  urban.  Each  country  defines  its  own  criteria  to \ndetermine whether a settlement is classified as urban based on population size, administrative status \nor  governance,  concentration  of  non-agricultural  employment  base,  and  density  of  population \n(Sattherthwaite and Tacoli 2003). With regard to population threshold being used in the definition of \nan urban center, these can range widely: in the Philippines, settlements with a population of more than \n1,000 are eligible for urban status, while the threshold in Viet Nam is over 4,000 (Sattherthwaite and \nTacoli 2003). In understanding and comparing urbanization with a view to planning and provision of \ninfrastructure it is rational to base any comparative analysis on population size of the agglomeration.  \n \nUrban in Viet Nam is classified as per the Decree No. 72/2001/ND-CP for classification of urban \ncenters and urban management levels (Government of Viet Nam, 2001). Urban centers include cities, \nprovincial towns, and district townships established under decisions of competent state agencies. \nUrban centers are classified into six grades, namely: special-grade, grade-I, grade-II, grade-III, grade-IV \nand grade-V urban centers. The basic factors for classifying urban centers include:  \n \n(i)  The function of being general centers or specialized centers, and the role of boosting the \nsocioeconomic development of the whole country or a certain territorial area;  \n(ii) The non-agricultural labor represents at least 65% of the total labor force; \n(iii) The  infrastructures  in  service  of  population\u2019s  activities  must  be  at  least  70%  up  to  the \nstandards and norms prescribed for each type of urban centers; \n(iv) The population size must be at least of 4,000 people; and \n(v) The population density conforms to the size, nature and characteristics of each type of urban \ncenters. \nFurther the decree defines the urban management levels as: \n \n(i) Centrally-run cities; \n(ii) Provincially-run cities, provincial towns or centrally-run cities and/or towns; and \n(iii) District townships. \n \nFor the census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is as follows: \n \n(i) All places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee, \netc.; and \n(ii) All other places, which satisfy the following criteria:  \n(a) A minimum population of 5,000;  \n(b) At least 75% of the male main working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits; and  \n(c) A density of population of at least 400 persons per square kilometer.  \n \nThe first category of urban units is known as statutory towns. These towns are notified under law by \nthe  concerned  state  and/or  union  territory  government  and  have  local  bodies  like  municipal \ncorporations,  municipalities,  and  municipal  committees,  irrespective  of  their  demographic \ncharacteristics as reckoned on 31 December 2009.

A barangay is the \nsmallest political unit in the Philippines. Generally, one enumerator is assigned to enumerate one \nbarangay. For enumeration purposes, a large barangay is usually divided into parts, and each part is \ncalled an enumeration area. A barangay is classified as urban if it meets any of the following: \n \n(i)  It has a population size of 5,000 or more; \n(ii) It has at least one establishment with a minimum of 100 employees; \n(iii) It has five or more establishments with 10 to 99 employees, and five or more facilities within \nthe two-kilometer radius from the barangay hall. \nThe level of urbanization in 2010 or the proportion of urban population to the total population in the \nPhilippines was 45.3%.

In 1983, the \nurban population made up less than 25% of the total population, of which 32% were found in Yangon \nregion (Blunt et al 2014). Approximately one-third of Myanmar\u2019s population is classified as living in \nurban centers, comparable to that of Thailand (34%) but much lower than that of Malaysia (72%). \n \nUrban Population and Regional Context \n \nThe official capital is Nay Pyi Taw, located midway between Myanmar\u2019s two largest cities\u2014Yangon \nwith a population of about 4.6 million and Mandalay with a population of about 1.0 million. The third \nlargest city is Mawlamyine (population of about 500,000), after which city size rapidly falls: there are \nonly  31  urban  centers  with  population  of  more  than  100,000.  The  urban  centers  are  largely \nconcentrated in the low-lying regions of the central dry zone and the coastal areas. Mandalay is the \nsecond largest city in Myanmar with a population estimated to be over 1.3 million and with a historic \ngrowth  rate  of  just  over  2%  per  year.  However, with  the  opening  up  of  the  country  to  outside \ninvestment, and with its critical location as on the crossroads of links between the PRC and the Bay \nand Bengal and the routes between Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam with India, it is seen to \ngrow at a far faster rate of nearer 3% over the next 25 years, resulting in a population of over 3 million by \n2040 (ADB 2014). With the improved economic opportunities, the resulting increase in foreign direct \ninvestment, and increased importance of the role of Mandalay, it is probable that the city should be \nplanning for a far greater population of more than 3 million by 2040. \n \nIn  2013,  ADB  provided  a  capacity  development  technical  assistance15 to  support  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction to prepare a scoping study for a Strategic Development Plan for Green Mandalay, which \ncould act as a model for the management of urban development throughout Myanmar.

Gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rate in Viet Nam increased continuously in the last 16 years (1990\u20132006), \nreaching 7.6% in 2007 and 8.5% in 2008. The slow growth rate is estimated at 5.5%\u20136% due to the \nglobal  economic  degradation,  while  it  reached  0%  or  negative  growth  rate  in  many  developed \ncountries. Economic growth of urban centers was relatively stable at 12%\u201315% on average, and was \nestimated at 8%\u201310% during 2007\u20132009. Urban centers took up a relatively high proportion of GDP, \nreaching 54% of the whole country when the urban population accounted for 23% (1998) and reached \n70% of GDP when the urban population occupied 27% (2005). Unlike most Southeast Asian countries, \nViet Nam has relatively low levels of urbanization (23.7% of the total population of over 76 million). \nHowever, this increased rapidly in the 1990s (Dang, Tacoli, and Thanh 2003). The criteria for urban \nclassification in Viet Nam has not changed since 1990; however reclassification of rural settlements \ninto urban centers, together with migration and natural population growth contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s \noverall increase in urbanization.  \n \nSpatial Distribution of the Population \n \nThe spatial distribution of the population across the regions is uneven. The Mekong River Delta is the \nmost heavily populated region (16.1 million people, 21% of the total population), followed by the Red \nRiver Delta (14.8 million people, 19.4% of the population), in a combined land area of less than 16% of \nthe country\u2019s total. By contrast, the central highlands, northwest, and northeast regions account for \n45% of the total land area but only one-fifth of the total population (Dang, Tacoli, and Thanh 2003). \nThe Red River Delta has the highest population density of all (1,180 persons/square kilometer [km2]). \nAmong urban centers, Ha Noi has the highest population density of 2,909 persons/ km2 followed by \nHo Chi Minh City with 2,407 persons/km2.

Pollution,  loss  of  natural  capital,  low  returns  on  public  investments,  and  low  economic \ncompetitiveness  are  some  of  the  urban  management  challenges.  Natural  disasters  and  climate-\ninduced impacts add to the associated social, economic, and environment costs of rapid urbanization, \nespecially in the secondary cities with limited capacity to address consequences of rapid urbanization. \nAccording to the National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam, since 1963, experienced average \ntemperature rise of 0.5oC\u20130.7oC; sea level rise of 20 centimeter; and worsening floods, storms, and \n 19\ndroughts.  This is recognized in the Framework Master Plan for Urban Development in Viet Nam to 2025 \nand Vision to 2050.20  \n \nThe master plan aims to develop secondary cities to divert rural migration away from the large cities \ntoward secondary cities and to foster stronger urban\u2013rural links. It aims to achieve balanced and \nstrategic growth through a national system of capably managed urban centers, envisaging secondary \nand tertiary cities as development hubs within the provincial context. Viet Nam\u2019s strategic choice of \ndeveloping provincial capital cities, established governance systems, and regional primacy will unlock \nthe economy of the rural hinterlands through providing connectivity and opportunity for growth, thus \nstrengthening the urban\u2013rural links. Developing provincial capital cities as pilots in different geographic \nregions will boost local economy, balance regional development, strengthen urban\u2013rural links, and \naddress the overcrowding of primary urban centers.   \n \nADB\u2019s GrEEEn Cities Initiative and Secondary Cities Development Program \n \nThe challenge for Viet Nam is to maintain its long-term development prospects by minimizing risks \nassociated with urbanization. Adapting critical infrastructure by building climate resilience in coastal \nand low-lying areas will safeguard vulnerable populations and productive sectors of the economy, \nincluding its natural resources.  \n \nWith urban areas likely to drive economic growth through both rural and regional development, ADB\u2019s \nSecondary Cities Development Program ([SCDP] Green Cities) is financing the improvements in \nurban and environmental infrastructure and services in three secondary cities of Ha Giang, Hue, and \n21\nVinh Yen, facilitating local economic growth and building resilient communities.

The impact of the corridor towns development projects would be that these corridor \ntowns will play an important role in enhancing the regional competitiveness of the GMS with the \nenhancement of economic linkages to their respective hinterlands, which also impact local tourism, \nand the promotion of local products and value chains. Modern environmental services (water, waste \nwater, solid waste management) result in positive health impacts.

During 1992\u20132007, the overall national poverty incidence in Cambodia declined to about \n36%, which is high for the region (the poverty incidence in Viet Nam fell to 20% during the same period). \nThe distribution of poverty varies considerably in Cambodia, from less than 15% in the capital to well over \n45% in the northern and northeastern provinces and in the vicinity of Tonle Sap. In Battambang, the \npoverty incidence in 2009 was 18%, slightly higher than that in Phnom Penh (15%) but lower than the \napproximate national poverty incidence of 36%. Urban poverty also differs from rural poverty because \nthe cost of living reference values differ between urban and rural areas. Poverty in the Lao PDR is still \nwidespread, with an estimated 34% of the population living below the poverty line and a large proportion \nof  the  population  at  risk  of  sliding  back  into  poverty.

Kaysone \nPhomvihane  is  also  listed  among  the  poorest  districts  in  the  Savannakhet  province.  Poverty  is \npredominantly rural, with high concentrations in the remote and mountainous northeastern and eastern \nborders with Viet Nam, As a result, poverty also has a strong ethnic association. Viet Nam has made \nimpressive progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty incidence declining from 58% in 1993 to 10.6% \nin 2010.

Priorities \nof earlier GMS national tourism development policies include contributing to economic development, \npromoting the country and its products in the global marketplace, enhancing competitiveness in the \ntourism sector, and promoting cooperation with neighboring countries. Recent priorities have become \nnotably more pro-poor and include managing and protecting the environment where the poor reside, \nand ensuring that tourism benefits are spread to the poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nThe GMS program\u2019s role in tourism development has brought about regional collective actions needed \nfor greater connectivity and integration of tourism plans, programs, and strategies among the GMS \ncountries.

The specific objective of the MTDP was to promote sustainable tourism development in \nthe lower Mekong River basin through infrastructure improvements, increased community and private \nsector participation and subregional cooperation. Siem Reap and Phnom Penh from Cambodia were \nthe participating towns in the project.  \n \nSiem Reap Environmental Improvement \n \nIn 2001, Siem Reap was a fast growing town that attracted 265,000 international tourists. Many hotels \nand private houses discharged wastewater into a canal to the west of the town, which was heavily \npolluted due to lack of maintenance and encroachment by dwellings, which partially block the canal in \nvarious places. The wastewater flowed untreated to the Tonle Sap Lake or filtered into the ground, \npolluting the ground water and creating high risks for the health of the local population and tourists, \nand for the fragile ecosystem of Tonle Sap Lake.  \n \nMTDP rehabilitated the urban sewer on the west side of the town, constructed new connections to the \nsystem, constructed stabilizing lagoons to treat discharges from a population of about 17,000 in the \nwest part of the town, and prepared a community sanitation and health awareness program. The \nMTDP achieved the following results:  \n \n(i)  International arrivals increased from 264,000 (2002) to 1,305,256 (2012) and rapid increase in \ntourist volumes was indicative of the positive growth trends, which could be sustained by the \nimprovements in urban environmental conditions due to the project.  \n                                                            \n25   The GMS consists of the following countries: Cambodia, the PRC (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan \nProvince), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n26   See http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33310/files/gms-tourism-assessment.pdf ", "Regional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development  25 \n \n(ii) Wastewater  discharge  from  residential  housing  and  hotels  in  the  target  area  were  being \nconnected to the new wastewater treatment plant as required by a newly enacted sub-decree. \nThe reduction in flooding and separation of wastewater from storm water in parts of Siem \nReap also brought substantial public health benefits.  \n(iii) Treatment of wastewater, drainage improvements, and more efficient garbage collection and \ndisposal had improved sanitary conditions in urban areas and catalyzed public and private \ninvestment in tourism-related infrastructure and services. \n(iv) The  Project  had  raised  hygiene  awareness  in  Siem  Reap  and  provided  access  to  better \nsanitation and sewerage services to an estimated 116,318 people in 19,938 households.

National urban strategies and \npolicies should enable infrastructure and urban development in existing secondary cities \nand  towns.  This  will  strengthen  the  existing  urban  agglomerations  drawing  urban \npopulation  toward  these  secondary  centers  and  take  away  the  pressure  from  the \nmegacities, thus contributing to a sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \n(vi)  Build on existing assets and skills. Culture, heritage, industry, and nature are all assets \nthat  are  often  neglected  in  cities  and  villages.  With  culture  and  tourism  playing  an \nimportant role in a city, joining forces around a shared image of how to develop a city can \nbe  enhanced.  Building  ownership  and  understanding  of  the  city\u2019s  assets  through \nconsultative and visioning processes can enhance the economic potential of the rural and \nurban area. In tourism cities, technical aspects such as infrastructure improvements can be \ncombined with the preservation and support of cultural traditions, thereby planning and \nmanaging a city\u2019s different challenges in an integrated manner. For example, revenue \ngenerators such as traditional handicraft and old architecture are cultural and heritage \nassets that provide authenticity to the tourism industry. These assets need to be supported \nthrough investments in heritage conservation, urban upgrading, SME development and \ncapacity trainings to preserve local skills. Traditional skills are often practiced by minority \nethnic groups and particularly by women. Economic support policies can be specifically \ntailored and targeted to be inclusive. \n \n \nEconomically vibrant and well-restored heritage street in Hangzhou, Zheizang province,  \nthe People's Republic of China. \nPhoto \u00a9 Ramola Naik Singru, 2014. \n \nUrban Models of Growth \n \nNew urban models of growth are emerging.

Development of a \ncluster of urban areas or satellite cities around the core urban area provides opportunity for a \nmutually beneficial relationship between the cities. Cities often develop engulfing specific \nclusters that may have specialized skills, such as the leather industry in Dharavi in Mumbai or \nthe metal handicrafts industry in Hue in Viet Nam. Unless these specialized industries are \nprovided adequate support to enhance their business practices, streamline environmental \npractices and connect to relevant markets, the clusters will lose their competitive advantage of \nbeing close to the city core.  \n(ii) Feasible urban infrastructure development and service delivery.

Satellite cities are developed through a symbiotic relationship in close proximity to \nlarge  cities.  Rather  than  being  just  residential  suburbs,  satellite  cities  can  become  niche  market \nlocations in their own right benefiting from the proximity to the large city where a pool of specialized \nservices such as financiers, lawyers, insurers etc. are available. Further, the proximity to a megacity or \nmetropolitan city includes easy access to multinational companies and connectivity to global markets \nthrough  an  international  airport.

Corridor town development improves market connectivity of \nthe hinterland with a positive impact on the local economy, the promotion of local products \nand value chains, and improved local tourism. \n \nOptimizing Synergistic Cross-Sector Benefits  \n \nSome areas of activity underscore the interrelation between tourism, environmental management, and \nurban\u2013rural  development.  The  following  points  highlight  some  of  these  areas  where  synergistic \nbenefits can be achieved.  \n \n(i)  Supporting  SME  clusters.  A  positive  development  in  the  tourism  sector  results  in  an \nincreased number of visitors and increased spending. SMEs are the backbone of the tourism \nsector and would benefit directly from such increased numbers. Clustered development can \nenhance growth in the SME tourism sector.  \n ", "28   ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n \n(ii) Improving  infrastructure  and  services.  The  tourism  industry,  especially  with  increased \nnumbers of visitors, depends on improved facilities and infrastructure. Such infrastructure is \nbeneficial to both visitors and residents. There are various action areas, ranging from small \nimprovements in signage, public restrooms, and public space management to larger scale \nimprovements in urban design, drainage, and traffic systems. As previous ADB projects have \nproven, such infrastructure and services improvements provide employment opportunities for \nresidents. Furthermore, the increased number of visitors offers different opportunities for \nfinancing the provision, upgrading, and maintenance of infrastructure and services (visitor\u2019s tax, \nfees for use of certain facilities, traffic tolls for tourist buses, etc.), at the same time\u201d replace the \nsentence with \u201cSimultaneously, there is increased pressure on facilities and infrastructure with \nthe increasing number of visitors which requires systematic planning and management to \naddress this situation proactively. \n(iii) Enhancing competencies and capacities through partnerships. At a higher level of skills, \nthere is low capacity even among architects and planners in the GMS region on heritage \nconservation practices starting with identification, designation, and restoration of conservation \nzones. Bilateral projects, such as India\u2019s engagement in the restoration of the temple complex \nin Angkor Wat since 1986 and more recently in the restoration of the Ta Prom Temple, have \nshown that capacities can be built and improved with such institutional cooperation. The \nGrEEEn City Initiative\u2019s concept of Urban Management Partnerships is another example of \nbringing together more experienced actors in tourism development with other actors willing to \nlearn and apply lessons learnt and best practices. This approach would directly be in line with \nthe objective of increased cooperation and exchange among GMS countries.  \nGoing beyond the traditional perspective of local actors on the one hand and external actors \non the other, one also needs to think about tourists in the sense of visitors who might consider \nstaying longer and even investing in the places they visited beforehand. There is some potential \nof entrepreneurs opening up their own (subsidiary) offices, scaling up their activities, and \nteaming up with local entrepreneurs. Often these kinds of operations include the training of \nlocal staff, directly leading to increased competencies and capacities. For this to happen, the \ngovernment needs to provide an enabling environment with regard to policies, the regulatory \nframework, and the provision of infrastructure and services. \n(iv) Benefitting  socioeconomic  development.  Tourism  is  an  important  instrument  in \nsocioeconomic development, as social contacts between tourists and locals increase mutual \nunderstanding and cultural exchange. Additionally, integrated urban development should be \nbased  on  participatory  processes  and  the  buy-in  of  key  stakeholders.  The  specific \ndevelopment of a sustainable tourism industry  and location could bring several benefits: \nincreased numbers (and higher spending) of visitors, growth in an economically high-potential \nniche market (which is on the rise in Asia), environmentally and financially more efficient \nresource use due to improved infrastructure systems, increased environmental quality and \nlivability for visitors and residents.  \n \nThe city governments in collaboration with development partners, private sector, and civil society can \nthus  take  the  lead  in  optimizing  cross-sector  synergies  to  enhance  urban\u2013urban  integrated \ndevelopment based on a shared vision of how urbanization and economic growth can be achieved in \nan environmentally friendly, socially inclusive, and financially viable manner. \n   ", "Regional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development  29 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nADB. 2008.

While the relationship between urbanization and \ngrowth (and poverty reduction in general) is often well-established, less is discussed about the forms and \ncauses of newly emerging urban poverty and exclusion, and how they differ for different city sizes.
