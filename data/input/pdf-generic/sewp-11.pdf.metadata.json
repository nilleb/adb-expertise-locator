This  paper  analyzes  the  potential  for  poverty  reduction  through  a \nregionally balanced urbanization approach using the case studies the development of secondary cities \nand  small  towns  in  Southeast  Asian  countries.  It  discusses  the  spatial  growth  patterns  that  have  an \nimpact  on  sustainable  development  and  urban\u2013rural  poverty  links.  The  paper  emphasizes  the  equity \npillar of the 3E strategies of environment sustainability, economic competitiveness, and equity outlined \nin the GrEEEn Cities Operational Framework. 1 \n \nUNIQUE FEATURES OF URBANIZING ASIA  \n \nRapid urbanization is recognized as a defining feature of the 21st century, turning the attention toward \nthe  quality  and  nature  of  future  cities  and  sustainable  communities  around  the  world.  Asia\u2019s \nurbanization  is  unique  as  it  is  urbanizing  at  a  pace  faster  than  any  other  region,  resulting  in  an \nunprecedented growth in the number of urban dwellers and increased number of densely populated \nmegacities. The global development challenges and in particular Asia\u2019s urban challenges are daunting \nand often conflicting, with a rising demand for resources and services, growing consumption patterns, \ndepleting  natural  resources,  increasing  air  pollution,  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  and  increasing \nvulnerable  population  exposed  to  climate  disruptions  and  the  rise  in  extreme  weather  events.  Asian \ncities  have  to  cope  with  the  pressure  on  physical  infrastructure,  rapid  environmental  degradation, \nincreasing inequality, and a reduction in social cohesion.  \n \nWith about 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) today coming from the urban areas, the quality and \nefficiency  of  Asian  cities  will  determine  the  region\u2019s  long-term  productivity  and  overall  stability \n(Lindfield and Steinberg 2011). Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas but \ncities  are  also  resource  intensive,  consuming  85%  of  energy,  and  they  are  polluting  (Lindfield  and \nSteinberg 2011). Sixty-seven percent of Asian (vs. 11% non-Asian) cities fail to meet European Union air \nquality  standard  (ADB  2012).  Asia  alone  is  responsible  for  35%  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Air \npollution can have estimated 2%-4% negative impact on GDP.  \n \nUnprecedented  growth. Asia\u2019s urbanization is unprecedented\u2014leading to enormous challenges but \nwith an opportunity to exploit its latecomer\u2019s advantage and unique features. From 1980 to 2010, Asia \nadded  more  than  a  billion  people  to  its  cities,  more  than  all  other  regions  combined,  with  a  further \nbillion  set  to  be  city  dwellers  by  2040.2 In  2010,  for  the  first  time  in  history,  Asia  became  home  to \nalmost half of the global urban population, with 43% of its population living in urban areas. Forty-four \nmillion people are added to city population in Asia every year\u2014equivalent to 120,000 people each day \nwho require construction of more than 20,000 new dwellings, 250 kilometers of new roads and water \ninfrastructure to supply more than 6 megaliters of potable water.3 This massive scale of urbanization is \n\n                                                            \n1   S.

In  2010,  the  urban  share  of  Asia\u2019s  population  was  still  only  43%,  compared  to  52% \nworldwide. Asia\u2019s urbanization is now rapid and fast paced, with the PRC transitioning from 10% of its \npopulation  in  urban  areas  to  50%  urban  in  just  60  years,  versus  210  years  in  Latin  America  and  the \nCaribbean, 150 years in Europe, and 105 years in North America. Asia\u2019s urban population is projected to \ncontinue growing faster than that of any other region (ADB 2012).  \n \nHighest densities. In total, 17 of the 25 cities with the highest population densities and 8 of the top 10 \ndensest  cities  are  in  Asia.  This  growth  is  unique  and  not  comparable  to  any  other  region  as  Asia  is \nhome  to  almost  half  of  all  urbanites  with  an  urban  population  that  is  more  than  three  times  that  of \nEurope, the region with the second largest urban population. From 2010 to 2050 the urban population \nin Asia will double and by then 65% of Asia\u2019s population will be urban (ADB 2011). By 2050, the urban \nshare in Asia is projected to reach 63%, gaining on but still below the 67% global average. Thus Asian \ncities will likely grow bigger and have even higher density. \n \nNew emerging urban forms. New forms of urbanization are emerging with mega-regions, peri-urban \nareas,  urban  corridors,  satellite  cities,  clustered  city-regions.  Large  cities  are  spreading  out,  engulfing \nnearby towns, leading to continuous belts of settlement (UN-Habitat 2009). In 2010, 12 out of 23 of \nworld\u2019s megacities were in Asia. 4  \n \nURBANIZATION AND VULNERABILITY  \n \nCities  are  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  particularly  rising  sea  level  and  inundation. \nVulnerability  will  rise  with  urbanization.  Many  of  Asia\u2019s  largest  cities,  located  on  or  close  to  coastal \nareas, will be heavily affected by rising sea levels and violent weather with a projected 410 million urban \nAsians  at  risk  of  coastal  flooding  by  2025.5   In  2000,  18%  of  Asian  urbanites  were  at  risk  of  coastal \nflooding,  versus  11%  for  Africa,  8%  for  Latin  America,  and  7%  for  Europe.  In  2010,  of  total  urban \npopulation,  251  million  Asians  were  exposed  to  this  risk,  compared  with  40  million  Europeans,  32 \nmillion Africans, and 24 million Latin Americans. Manila with nearly 12 million inhabitants is the largest \nurban agglomeration at high risk of cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. Four other large coastal cities in \nAsia are at similar high risks of cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. Over 300 million were already at risk \nof  coastal  flooding  in  2010,  and  about  250  million  at  risk  of  inland  flooding  such  as  Bangkok \nexperienced in 2012. The number affected by inland flooding is expected to rise, to roughly 350 million \nby 2025. More than half the population in large cities like Ho Chi Minh City is at risk from both inland \nand coastal flooding. The most vulnerable and excluded in these situations are the urban poor. \n \n  \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n4    Cities with more than 10 million population are termed as megacities. \n5   United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2012.

Manila: \n\n \n\n \nURBANIZATION\u2013POVERTY NEXUS \n \nLarge disparities have emerged as poverty has urbanized with over 200 million people living in poverty \nin Asia\u2019s cities and many more are vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks (ADB 2012). The \nWorld  Bank  Global  Monitoring  Report  (GMR)  finds  that  urban  poverty  rates  are  significantly  lower \nthan rural poverty rates and that urban populations have far better access to the basic public services \ndefined by the Millennium Development Goals, such as access to safe water and sanitation facilities, \neven  though  within  urban  areas  asymmetries  in  access  are  large  (World  Bank  2013).  If  the  forces  of \nurbanization are not managed speedily and efficiently, growth of informal settlements can overwhelm \ncity growth, exacerbate urban poverty, and derail Millennium Development Goal achievements. Asian \ncities will likely grow bigger and have even higher density. Although more than half of the megacities \nwill be in Asia, a strong focus on the secondary cities will be required as they expand rapidly.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\nUrban\u2013 Rural Poverty  \n \nWith  growth  and  urbanization,  poverty  also  urbanizes.  People  are  located  along  a  continuous  rural\u2013\nurban  spectrum,  and  large  cities  are  not  necessarily  places  where  the  urban  poor  are  concentrated. \nSmaller towns matter greatly for urban poverty reduction and service delivery. According to the GMR, \nit  was  evidenced  in  a  study  of  eight  developing  countries,  that  while  the  urban  population  was \nconcentrated  in  the  largest  cities,  incidence  of  urban  poverty  was  dispersed  along  a  continuum  of \nmedium,  small,  and  extra  small  towns.6 Poverty  rates  measured  as  a  share  of  the  population  below \n$1.25 a day are falling in both urban and rural areas but are lower in urban area. Yet the GMR research \nin  India  indicated  that  while  poverty  is  primarily  a  rural  phenomenon  at  the  aggregate  level,  urban \npoverty is becoming a larger problem (World Bank, 2013). Similarly, urban poverty is on the rise in the \nPhilippines  though  two-thirds  of  the  poor  still  live  in  rural  areas  and  the  rural  poverty  incidence  is \nhigher than the national average (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014). The GMR found that not only is the \nincidence of poverty higher in small cities and towns than in the large urban areas, but these smaller \nurban  centers  also  account  for  a  larger  share  of  the  urban  poor  (World  Bank  2013).  In  India,  it  was \nnoted  that  among  urban  areas,  poverty  rates  were  highest  in  small  towns  (population  less  than \n50,000),  at  30%,  compared  with  15%  in  large  cities (population  of  1  million  or  more).  The  size  of  the \ncities in smaller countries is comparable to small towns in large countries; hence the definition of urban \npoverty is essentially a function of the scale of the cities under discussion.  \n \nDimensions of Urban Poverty \n \nUrbanization  provides  greater  employment  opportunities.  Urban  productivity  is  more  than  5.5  times \nthat  of  rural  areas  (ADB  2012).  However  rising  incomes  in  urban  areas  are  also  accompanied  by  a \ngrowing disparity. This is stronger in urban areas due to the income differentials. However poverty has \nother  dimensions  besides  income  differentials.  The  dimensions  of  urban  poverty  (Figure  1)  annotate \nthe  conditions  that  have  a  direct  or  indirect  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  for  the  urban  poor.7 Unless \nalternative  approaches  to  address  urban  poverty  are  put  in  place,  the  poor  will  remain  the  most \nvulnerable.  \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n6   World  Bank.  2013.

A Sourcebook for  Poverty  Reduction  Strategies. Vol. 2. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n\n \n\nMigration  is  the  major  driver  of  urbanization  in  Asia.  Migrants  are  attracted  to  cities  with  an \nexpectation  of  improved  conditions  of  living.  However  perceptions  vary  greatly  from  the  reality.  The \nquality  of  life  experienced  by  the  urban  poor  can  be  far below  that  in  the  rural  areas.  Urban  poverty \nincidence  in  the  Philippines  has  steadily  declined  with  the  lowest  rate  (10.4%  in  2006)  for  Metro \nManila,  the  most  urbanized  region,  yet  the  absolute  number  of  urban  poor  continues  to  rise.  A  high \ndemand for land for development leads to a worsening access to land and housing. Land prices in the \ngrowing city of Mandalay in Myanmar are much higher than might be expected for a city of a similar \nsize in the rest of Southeast Asia.  \n \nFurthermore, low supply of affordable public housing creates urban sprawl in megacities such as Metro \nManila.  Policies  created  to  alleviate  situations  are  often  counterproductive.  Developers  in  the \nPhilippines are required to provide 20% affordable housing units for every development they construct. \nHowever, there is no spatial binding to this regulation (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014). The developers \ncan  provide  these  units  anywhere  in  the  city  or  outside  the  city  boundaries  leading  to  high  scale \ndevelopments  in  the  city  core  and  affordable  or  low-income  units  outside  the  city  with  poor \nconnectivity  and  a  lack  of  access  to  employment.  These  policies  beget  informal  settlements  as  the \nrelocated people come back to the city closer to the centers of employment. Though the share of the \nurban population living in informal settlements in the Philippines declined from 54.3% in 1990 to 43.7% \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\nin 2009, the absolute number of inhabitants living in such settlements has steadily increased indicating \na need to address urban renewal through targeted investments (Naik Singru and Lindfield 2014).  \n \nInformal settlements are often built in high-risk areas with no access to basic urban services such as \nwater supply, sanitation, and solid waste facilities. With the growing intensity and frequency of natural \ndisasters such as flooding, cyclones, and typhoons, this urban poor population is vulnerable to greater \nrisks.  Though  access  to  basic  services  in  informal  settlements  has  tended  to  improve  over  time, \ntypically  areas  such  as  front  railways  and  riverbanks  are  making  provision  of  basic  urban  services \nin  these  settlements.  Worsening  access  to  services  contributes  to  overcrowded \nproblematic \nunhygienic living conditions and environmental degradation  including pollution  of water  bodies such \nas rivers, canals, and lakes. Furthermore, a large portion of the urban population lives barely above the \npoverty line, and these individuals are vulnerable to slipping back below it due to loss of employment, \nillness, natural disasters, or other factors affecting income levels.  \n \nThe safety nets in the rural areas\u2014ability to grow food, access to natural resources, proximity of family \nand friends, among others\u2014enable the rural poor to cope through crisis. However, in urban situations, \nmore  income  is  spent  on  survival  services  such  as  water,  food,  housing  rent,  and  commuting. \nInadequate housing, tenure insecurity, precarious living conditions, risk to disasters for settlements in \nlow  lying  and  hazard  prone  areas,  inadequate  access  to  water  and  sanitation,  lack  of  access  to  solid \nwaste facilities, exposure to hazardous chemical waste due to proximity to industries, exposure to air \nand noise pollution, exposure to food contamination, food insecurity, and malnutrition are some of the \nfactors that make urban poverty more acute than rural poverty. \n \n\nFigure 2: External Factors Affecting Urban Migrant Population \n\nSource: Author\u2019s analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n7 \n\n \n\nSPATIAL DIMENSIONS \n\n5. \n \nNew forms of urbanization are emerging with mega-regions, peri-urban areas, urban corridors, satellite \ncities, clustered city-regions. A total urban population of 3.3 billion is unevenly distributed across the \nworld in urban agglomerations of different sizes. More than 52% of the world\u2019s urban population and \n51% of urban population in developing countries reside in cities and towns of less than 500,000 people \n(UN-Habitat 2009). Large cities are spreading out, engulfing nearby towns, leading to continuous belts  \nof  settlement.  In  2010,  12  out  of  23  of  world\u2019s  megacities  were  in  Asia. 8   By  2025,  the  number  of \nmegacities in Asia is expected to increase to 21 out of a global total of 37. The additional Asian cities \ninclude:  Chongqing,  Tianjin,  and  Wuhan  in  the  PRC;  Bangalore,  Chennai,  and  Hyderabad  in  India; \nJakarta in Indonesia; Bangkok in Thailand; and Lahore in Pakistan. In 2025 it is expected that more than \n37 megacities worldwide and 22 of those will be in Asia while there are expected to be more than 500 \ncities  with  more  than  1  million  inhabitants  (ADB  2012).  Unplanned  urbanization  through  megacity \nexpansion creates many problems for poverty reduction and inclusive growth.  \n \nForms of Urban Expansion  \n \nWith  economic  and  demographic  growth,  the  urban  agglomerations  expand  spatially\u2014vertically \nthrough urban densification and horizontally through metropolitanization, peri-urbanization and urban \nsprawl. These spatial forms of physical expansion have an impact on the ability of the city to meet the \nneeds  of  its  expanding  population.  Increasingly,  urban  managers  and  planners  are  grappling  with \nproviding  urban  infrastructure  and  services  to  an  expanding  population  spread  across  new  spatial \nforms. Various forms of spatial expansion of urban agglomerations are listed: \n \n\n(i)  Vertical expansion \n\n(a) Urban densification: higher floor space index and/or floor area ratio, high rise buildings; \n(b) Mixed-use: Diversification and combination of  land uses to increase self-sufficient urban \n\nareas and limit urban sprawl; and  \n\n(c) Transit oriented developments: mixed-use developments around a transit hub. \n\n(a) Metropolitanization: clustering of adjoining towns to form a contiguous metropolitan city \n\n(ii) Horizontal expansion  \n\nor megacity.  \n(b) Radial expansion \n\n(1)  Peri-urban: an area developed beyond an urban boundary and the rural area, \n(2) Suburban: a predominantly residential development abutting a city, \n(3) Satellite towns: towns developed through a symbiotic relationship in close proximity to \n\nlarge cities,  \n\n(4) Urban villages: villages enclosed through city expansion, and  \n(5) Clustered development: cluster of small urban townships forming a city core. \n\n(c) Linear expansion\u2013Corridor towns development: towns and cities connected along a fast-\nurbanizing linear transport and industrializing corridor to expand economic opportunities. \n\n                                                            \n8    Cities with more than 10 million population are termed as megacities. \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\nFigure 3: Emerging Urban Spatial Forms \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nLinear-Corridor Towns Development \n\nHorizontal expansion: Metropolitanization, peri-urbanization, satellite towns, urban villages \n\nSource: Author\u2019s analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe  globalization  of  economic  activity  has  been  a  catalyst  for  change  in  the  spatial  and  social \nreorganization of cities evident through distinct socio-spatial forms like increased social  polarization, \nspatial  segregation,  and  gentrification  processes.  Socio-spatial  transformations  in  the  developing \ncountries  are  primarily  in  the  direction  of  spatial  segregation,  fragmentation,  and  specialization  of \nfunctions and land-uses in cities (Naik Singru 2007). With the push factor being greater than the pull \nfactor,  there  is  likely  to  be  an  increase  in  migration  to  the  urban  centers  of  rural  labor  in  search  of \nlivelihoods that sustain not only the migrating population but also their rural families left behind in the \nvillages.  Though  the  cost  of  city  living  is  too  high  to  support  an  entire  family  in  the  city,  the  rural \nhouseholds find the meager remittance amount sufficient to sustain themselves in the villages (Naik \nSingru  2008b).  Thus,  in  an  increasingly  global  and  interlinked  economy,  the  rural  and  urban  are  no \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n9 \n\n \n\nlonger distinctly separate economic zones. The interdependence of the urban-rural economies and its \nconsequences  necessitates  an  increased  interest  in  urban-rural  linkages  that  can  help  in  redefining \nurban development policy (Naik Singru 2008). Urbanization has abetted growth but begets inequality. \nInequality in the urban space is experienced through the lack of access to shelter and services. In many \ncities in developing countries, spatial forms are largely driven by the efforts of low-income households \nto secure land that is affordable and in a reasonable location, often in peri-urban areas where the rural \nareas merge with the expanding cities.  \n \nA  better  urban\u2013rural  integration  and  small  towns  development  can  be  a  driver  of  change  to  address \nmany  problems  of  poverty,  migration,  and  environmental  degradation  in  Asia.  Sattherthwaite  and \nTacoli (2003) have documented well the crucial role small and intermediate urban centers can have in \nthe  economic  development  of  their  surrounding  region:  for  example,  local  urban  markets  can  link \nproducers to national and international markets and thereby increase rural incomes; the concentration \nof the production and distribution of goods and services in local urban centers can decrease costs and \nimprove  access;  and  the  demand  for  nonfarm  workers  can  improve  rural  households\u2019  incomes  and \ndecrease migration pressure on the larger urban centers. Urban centers such as towns, market towns, \nsecondary cities, and megacities progressively scale up the connectivity links of transport and services \nfor the supply\u2013chain management.  \n \nEnhancing urban\u2013rural linkages is mutually beneficial as rural areas are supply sites and producers of \nfood, material, natural resources, labor, as well as sites of recreational and health tourism particularly in \nthe Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam. Economies that depend on nature, such as fishing, and recreational and \nhealth tourism require better connectivity and transport infrastructure to exploit its commercial value. \nThese  are  seasonal  and  increasingly  fragile  economies  in  coastal  areas  exposed  to  increasing \nenvironmental impacts and climate induced events.  \n \nFacilitating  movement  of  people,  goods,  services,  natural  produce,  and  resources  requires  better \ntransport infrastructure and connectivity. This includes provision of facilities and telecommunication \ninfrastructure that enables rural populations to access information and services to meet the needs of \nthe  urban  markets  to  gain  a  fair  and  faster  compensation  for  their  services  while  based  in  their  rural \nsettings. Furthermore, the reduced need for travel with telecommunications and increased livelihood \nopportunities in rural areas can contribute to environmental, social and economic co-benefits.  \n \n \nURBANIZATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,  \nTHE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND INDIA \n \nUnderstanding Urban \n \nUrban  is  defined  within  the  geographical  context  of  a  country.  It  can  be  a  misnomer  if  used  as  a \ncomparator between countries that are small in population and geographic area such as the Mekong \ncountries, with those that are large in both population and area such as the PRC and India. As analyzed \nby  the  GMR,  small  towns  in  small  countries  are  significantly  smaller  than  the  small  towns  in  large \ncountries  (World  Bank  2013).  Many  small  countries  do  not  have  a  megacity,  and  nearly  all  large \ncountries have many large cities of various sizes as  well as  one  or several megacities. It is difficult to \nmake accurate international comparisons of the proportion of nations\u2019 population living in small urban \ncenters defined by their population size because each nation has its own criteria for determining when \n\n \n\n\f10  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\na  settlement  is  large  enough  to  be  classified  as  urban.  Each  country  defines  its  own  criteria  to \ndetermine whether a settlement is classified as urban based on population size, administrative status \nor  governance,  concentration  of  non-agricultural  employment  base,  and  density  of  population \n(Sattherthwaite and Tacoli 2003). With regard to population threshold being used in the definition of \nan urban center, these can range widely: in the Philippines, settlements with a population of more than \n1,000 are eligible for urban status, while the threshold in Viet Nam is over 4,000 (Sattherthwaite and \nTacoli 2003). In understanding and comparing urbanization with a view to planning and  provision  of \ninfrastructure it is rational to base any comparative analysis on population size of the agglomeration.  \n \nUrban  in  Viet  Nam  is  classified  as  per  the  Decree No.  72/2001/ND-CP  for  classification  of  urban \ncenters and urban management levels (Government of Viet Nam, 2001). Urban centers include cities, \nprovincial  towns,  and  district  townships  established  under  decisions  of  competent  state  agencies. \nUrban centers are classified into six grades, namely: special-grade, grade-I, grade-II, grade-III, grade-IV \nand grade-V urban centers. The basic factors for classifying urban centers include:  \n \n\n(i)  The  function  of  being  general  centers  or  specialized  centers,  and  the  role  of  boosting  the \n\nsocioeconomic development of the whole country or a certain territorial area;  \n\n(ii)  The non-agricultural labor represents at least 65% of the total labor force; \n(iii) The  infrastructures  in  service  of  population\u2019s  activities  must  be  at  least  70%  up  to  the \n\nstandards and norms prescribed for each type of urban centers; \n\n(iv) The population size must be at least of 4,000 people; and \n(v) The population density conforms to the size, nature and characteristics of each type of urban \n\ncenters. \n\nFurther the decree defines the urban management levels as: \n \n\n(i)  Centrally-run cities; \n(ii) Provincially-run cities, provincial towns or centrally-run cities and/or towns; and \n(iii) District townships. \n\n \nFor the census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is as follows: \n \n\n(i)  All places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee, \n\netc.; and \n\n(ii) All other places, which satisfy the following criteria:  \n\n(a) A minimum population of 5,000;  \n(b) At least 75% of the male main working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits; and  \n(c) A density of population of at least 400 persons per square kilometer.  \n\n \nThe first category of urban units is known as statutory towns. These towns are notified under law by \nthe  concerned  state  and/or  union  territory  government  and  have  local  bodies  like  municipal \ncorporations,  municipalities,  and  municipal  committees, \ntheir  demographic \ncharacteristics as reckoned on 31 December 2009. \n\nirrespective  of \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n11 \n\n \n\nIn  the  Philippines  the  classification  is  based  on  administrative  or  political  units.  A  barangay  is  the \nsmallest  political  unit  in  the  Philippines.  Generally,  one  enumerator  is  assigned  to  enumerate  one \nbarangay.  For  enumeration  purposes,  a  large  barangay  is  usually  divided  into  parts,  and  each  part  is \ncalled an enumeration area. A barangay is classified as urban if it meets any of the following: \n \n\n(i)  It has a population size of 5,000 or more; \n(ii)  It has at least one establishment with a minimum of 100 employees; \n(iii) It has five or more establishments with 10 to 99 employees, and five or more facilities within \n\nthe two-kilometer radius from the barangay hall. \n\nThe level of urbanization in 2010 or the proportion of urban population to the total population in the \nPhilippines  was  45.3%.  This  means  that  of  the  92.3  million  population  in  the  Philippines  in  2010,  \n41.9 million lived in areas classified as urban. The rural population or those who lived in areas classified \nas  rural  numbered  50.5  million  and  accounted  for  54.7%  of  the  total  population  (National  Statistics \nOffice 2010). \n \nUrban  settlements  in  the  PRC  were  administratively  defined  as  statutory  cities  and  statutory  towns \nuntil  2006.  Since,  they  have  evolved  to  a  five-tier  structure  based  on  their  administrative  status  as \ncentral, provincial, prefectural, county, city, and township (or community in cities). This limited criteria \nfor classification makes comparisons difficult.  \n \n\nTable 1: Criteria for Classification of Urban Areas in Selected Countries  \n\nCountry \nIndia \n\nMinimum \nPopulation \n5,000 \n\nDensity \n(persons per \nsquare kilometer) \n400\n\nAdministrative Status \nStatutory towns; all places \nwith a municipality, \ncorporation, cantonment \nboard, or notified town area \ncommittee, etc. \nFive-tier structure: central, \nprovincial, prefectural, \ncounty, city, and township \n(or community in cities)  \n\n\u2013\n\nCentrally run, provincially \nrun, district  \n\nNon-Agricultural \nEmployment Base \n\n75% (male)  \n \n\n\u2013 \n\nAt least one \nestablishment with  \n100 employees  \n5 or more establishments \nwith 10 to 99 employees, \nand 5 or more facilities \nwithin the 2-kilometer \nradius from the barangay \nhall \n65%  \n \n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nThe People\u2019s \nRepublic of China \n \n\n\u2013 \n\nPhilippines \n\n5,000 or more \n\nViet Nam \n\n4,000 \n\n\u2013 = not available. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s analysis. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\nUrban\u2013Rural Poverty Linkages in Southeast Asia, the PRC, and India \nUrbanizing  Asia  is  rapidly  rising.  However  urbanization,  while  potentially  contributing  to  poverty \nreduction,  is  not  solving  the  problems  of  inclusive  growth  and  persistent  poverty  in  Asia.9 Poverty \neradication  goals  are  established  in  measuring  it  against  an  estimated  poverty  incidence  at  $1.25,  $2, \nand  $3  international  poverty  line.

Urbanization  is  putting  strains  on  the \nenvironment, affecting the quality of life for everyone, particularly the poor. Poverty, disparities in well-\nbeing, environmental pressures, as well as climate change remain the key issues confronting the Asia \nand Pacific region. Moreover, urban populations are exploding, and the challenge lies in our ability to \nrespond  to  these  needs.  The  following  sections  capture  few  examples  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) response to urban development challenges in Southeast Asia. \n \n7. \n \nThe  Urban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20122020,  of  ADB  provides  direction  for  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the \nchallenge of rapid urbanization by supporting investments in sustainable urban development based on \nthe 3E  strategies of economic competitiveness, environmental  sustainability, and equity.

Competitive cities focus on the roles and contributions of economic clusters in the broader \ncontext as fundamental to designing a value-adding approach to inclusive economic development.  \n \nGrEEEn  Cities  Approach  (GCA)  is  a  flexible  and  scalable  initiative  that  proposes  a  paradigm  shift  in \nresponse  to  rapid  urbanization  by  integrating  urban  development  with  environmental  planning  to \nimprove  livability  and  resilience  in  cities.10 Through  the  GrEEEn  Cities  Initiative  for  Southeast  Asia, \nADB is working with cities that commit to a long-term partnership (15\u201320 years) and have long-term \nvision for their urban development. This allows ADB to support developing member countries to move \nfrom green growth strategies to green city realities. ADB will work with cities to take 3E strategies from \ntheory to practice by developing green city action plans and urban management partnerships that help \nto identify projects, and develop creative financing modalities.  \n \nThe  equity  pillar  under  the  GCA  promotes  inclusive  urban  development  based  on  the  underlying \nprinciples  of  accessibilty,  affordability,  resilience,  and  sustainability. 11 Inclusive  cities  is  an  integrated \napproach  encompassing  sustainable,  resilient,  accessible,  and  affordable  solutions  to  the  challenges \nfaced  by  the  urban  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  by  enhancing  their  access  to  urban  services  and \ninfrastructure  through  targeted  investments  such  as  participatory  planning,  informal  settlement \nupgrading,  urban  housing,  resilient  urban \nlivelihood \ndevelopment. This integrated approach encourages an institutional planning and delivery mechanism \nthat brings together all institutions and stakeholders\u2014government, private sector, civil  society\u2014who \nhave the capacity to deliver systems for inclusive urban service delivery. The approach proposes that \nthe  capacity  of  the  urban  poor  communities,  informal  settlement  networks,  and  nongovernment \norganizations should be effectively used in conjunction with the city government and private sector. \n \nSmart Systems \nAs stated in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, \u201cTo transform the archetypical chaotic, polluted, inequitable city of \nAsia  into  a  competitive,  equitable  and  environmentally  sustainable  urban  region\u2014in  short,  a  livable \ncity\u2014will  require  a  new  approach  to  city  development  and  to  ADB\u2019s  support  for  that  development. \nCore to the transformation is a new emphasis on the need for an integrated planning approach to the \nprovision of environmental infrastructure and services and other public goods.\u201d12  \n \nA smart systems approach for integrated planning and urban-rural development is one that envisions \nurban challenges from a holistic perspective by integrating the rural issues as part of the urban system. \nA smart system or an intelligent system is a management platform using information technology and \ninstitutional  coordination  for  effective  implementation  of  programs  through  enabling  synergistic \ninterlinkages of the following themes: \n \n\ninfrastructure,  community  services,  and \n\n(i)  Integrated Planning and Management; \n\n(a) Land management, \n(b) Industrial growth, \n(c) Urban expansion, \n\n \n\n                                                            \n10   S.

This change is also accompanied by the opening up of the country to international trade \nand  investment,  which  is  expected  to  stimulate  very  rapid  economic  growth  in  the  next  decade  or \nmore. Myanmar\u2019s population is approximately 60 million, estimated in 2010 to be increasing about 1.3% \nannually  while  the  annual  urban  growth  rate  is  estimated  at  2.9%.13&14 This  is  comparatively  high \n\n                                                            \n13   There has not been a census for the past 2 decades, hence the demographic estimates are approximate.

In 1983, the \nurban population made up less than 25% of the total population, of which 32% were found in Yangon \nregion  (Blunt  et  al  2014).  Approximately  one-third  of  Myanmar\u2019s  population  is  classified  as  living  in \nurban centers, comparable to that of Thailand (34%) but much lower than that of Malaysia (72%). \n \nUrban Population and Regional Context \n \nThe  official  capital  is  Nay  Pyi  Taw,  located  midway  between  Myanmar\u2019s  two  largest  cities\u2014Yangon \nwith a population of about 4.6 million and Mandalay with a population of about 1.0 million. The third \nlargest city is Mawlamyine (population of about 500,000), after which city size rapidly falls: there are \nonly  31  urban  centers  with  population  of  more  than  100,000.  The  urban  centers  are  largely \nconcentrated  in  the  low-lying  regions  of  the  central  dry  zone  and  the  coastal  areas.  Mandalay  is  the \nsecond largest city in Myanmar with a population estimated to be over 1.3 million and with a historic \ngrowth  rate  of  just  over  2%  per  year.  However,  with  the  opening  up  of  the  country  to  outside \ninvestment,  and  with  its  critical  location  as  on  the  crossroads  of  links  between  the  PRC  and  the  Bay \nand  Bengal  and  the  routes  between  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  with  India,  it  is  seen  to \ngrow at a far faster rate of nearer 3% over the next 25 years, resulting in a population of over 3 million by \n2040 (ADB 2014). With the improved economic opportunities, the resulting increase in foreign direct \ninvestment,  and  increased  importance  of  the  role of  Mandalay,  it  is  probable  that  the  city  should  be \nplanning for a far greater population of more than 3 million by 2040. \n \nIn  2013,  ADB  provided  a  capacity  development  technical  assistance15 to  support  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction to prepare a scoping study for a Strategic Development Plan for Green Mandalay, which \ncould act as a model for the management of urban development throughout Myanmar. The outputs of \nthe  study  \u201cToward  a  Green  Mandalay\u201d  is  informing  the  design  of  the  investment  loan  for  the  urban \nservices  improvement  project,  financed  by  ADB  (ADB  2014).  The  study  was  the  first  attempt  at \nestablishing a baseline understanding of the quality of life issues in the city of Mandalay.  \n \nSpatial Structure of Clustered Villages \n \nMandalay city came to be formed through the clustering of rural villages which expanded to townships \nas the city expanded horizontally. Mandalay consists of six townships, which are divided into 96 wards, \n42  village  tracts,  and  170  villages.  Land  uses  show  that  46.5%  of  the  Mandalay  city  is  urban,  and  the \nremaining parts are rural (41%) or water bodies (almost 10%) and villages (less than 3%). While Pyi Gyi \nDagon was rural as the 1990s, it has since become predominantly urban. In March 2011, Amarapura was \nabsorbed into Mandalay city, giving it a total area of 121.5 square miles, 16.5 miles from east to west and \n16 miles from north to south.  The greatest part of the agricultural land and water bodies and most of \nthe  villages  are  found  the  Amarapura.  In  the  urban  areas,  land  is  predominantly  government  land  or \nland for public utilities, with only 24% freehold or leasehold.  \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n15   ADB. 2013.

The first workshop reviewed the findings \npresented  in  the  urban  profile  and  through  a  systematic  system  of  scoring  the  impact  of  the  issues \nidentified on the green city criteria of Mandalay, provided a further evaluation of the critical issues that \nneed to be tackled to achieve the objectives of developing Mandalay as a green city. The second was to \nprioritize  the  proposed  solutions  and  to  identify  additional  strategies  to  achieve,  to  ensure  green \ndevelopment  of  the  city  and  regional  corridor  development.  Questions  regarding  household  income \nand  expenditures  were  included  in  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  in  order  to  establish  an \nindicative  financial  capacity  data  of  the  people  in  the  six  townships.  Based  on  the  result  of  the \nsocioeconomic survey, the average monthly household income is about Myanmar MK382,000 (about \n$389) or about $67 per capita equivalent, and the median income is about MK300,000, ($306) and the \nper capita income $53. Estimates suggest that about 25.6% of people in Myanmar are living below the \nnational poverty line in 2010.16 \n\nFigure 6: Six Townships Cluster of Mandalay City \n\nSource: Mandalay City Development Committee, 2013. \n\n                                                            \n16   ADB. 2013.

This is not to account for the \nnumber  of  substandard  houses  that  need  to  be  rebuilt  to  bring  them  to  an  acceptable standard,  nor \ndoes  it  account  for  the  historic  backlog  in  housing  units.  Public  housing  construction  has  been  very \nlimited.  Priority  has  been  given  to  housing  for  government  employees  as  required  under  the \nconstitution.17 However, even here the demand outstrips the supply. \n \nPresently  1,205  public  housing  units  are  provided  by  the  regional  government  in  Mandalay  region, \nincluding four housing estates in Mandalay city, and the rest in Ninja and Maray. In 1984, a very large \nfire occurred in Mandalay city and over 1,000 households were relocated to plots in Chan Mya Thazi \ntownship.  From  the  early  1990s,  work  started  on  the  resettlement  areas  in  the  new  town  of  Pyi  Gyi \nDagon. Land was allocated in the new settlement areas for government civil servants and low-income \nhouseholds.    Many  of  these  resettlement  areas  were  provided  with  minimal  services,  usually  just  a \nbasic road pattern. Drainage, water, road paving, sanitation, and power were not provided. The majority \nof  houses  constructed  were  of  woven  bamboo  matting  on  a  wooden  frame,  with  either  palm  leaves, \nbamboo, or zinc sheets. Little has been done to improve the conditions since then. \n \n\nPhotos \u00a9 Ramola Naik Singru, 2013.  \n \nGiven the current level of production, the total formal housing production in Myanmar city is currently \nabout 3,500 additional units per year. While this is quite substantial, it must be set against the demand \nof at least 6,000 units per year, suggesting a shortfall of 2,500 units, most of which will be met through \ninformal development, thus increasing the numbers of informal households. The first phase of low cost \nhousing being built by the Mandalay  City Development Committee is targeting the informal housing \npopulation,  which  has  settled  illegally  on  land  close  to  industrial  areas  in  the  city.  These  lands  are \nconvenient  for  the  workers  in  the  industries,  and  also  to  those  providing  support  services  to  the \nresidential area around the local industries. \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n17   The  Constitution  section  26  (b)  states  \u201cThe  Union  shall  enact  necessary  laws  for  Civil  Service  personnel  to  have... \n\nsufficiency of ....shelter...\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\nBoat people on temporary floating structures on the  \nRiver Ayyerwadi. \n\nInformal settlements with no access to basic sanitation \nlocated near Industrial areas . \n\nPhotos \u00a9 Ramola Naik Singru, 2013. \n \n \nGreen City Actions for Clustered City Development \n \nTo achieve the status of a green city, which is also sustainable, inclusive, and competitive, a number of \nactions  were  recommended  covering  investment  proposals.

Gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth  rate  in  Viet  Nam  increased  continuously  in  the  last  16  years  (1990\u20132006), \nreaching  7.6%  in  2007  and  8.5%  in  2008.  The  slow  growth  rate  is  estimated  at  5.5%\u20136%  due  to  the \nglobal  economic  degradation,  while  it  reached  0%  or  negative  growth  rate  in  many  developed \ncountries.  Economic  growth  of  urban  centers  was  relatively  stable  at  12%\u201315%  on  average,  and  was \nestimated at 8%\u201310% during 2007\u20132009. Urban centers took up a relatively high proportion of GDP, \nreaching 54% of the whole country when the urban population accounted for 23% (1998) and reached \n70% of GDP when the urban population occupied 27% (2005). Unlike most Southeast Asian countries, \nViet  Nam  has  relatively  low  levels  of  urbanization  (23.7%  of  the  total  population  of  over  76  million). \nHowever,  this  increased  rapidly  in  the  1990s  (Dang,  Tacoli,  and  Thanh  2003).  The  criteria  for  urban \nclassification  in  Viet  Nam  has  not  changed  since  1990;  however  reclassification  of  rural  settlements \ninto urban centers, together with migration and natural population growth contributed to Viet Nam\u2019s \noverall increase in urbanization.  \n \nSpatial Distribution of the Population \n \nThe spatial distribution of the population across the regions is uneven. The Mekong River Delta is the \nmost heavily populated region (16.1  million people, 21% of the total population), followed by the Red \nRiver Delta (14.8 million people, 19.4% of the population), in a combined land area of less than 16% of \nthe  country\u2019s  total.  By  contrast,  the  central  highlands,  northwest,  and  northeast  regions  account  for \n45% of the total land area but only one-fifth of the total population (Dang, Tacoli, and Thanh 2003). \nThe Red River Delta has the highest population density of all (1,180 persons/square kilometer [km2]). \nAmong urban centers, Ha Noi has the highest population density of 2,909 persons/  km2 followed by \nHo Chi Minh City with 2,407 persons/km2. The Mekong River Delta, the most populous region, has a \nfairly even population distribution, with population densities in the provinces ranging from 300 to 700 \npersons/km2. \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n18   From 2007 to 2011, Viet Nam\u2019s GDP continued to expand, with annual growth rates ranging from 8.5% in 2007 to 5.9% in \n2011.

Pollution,  loss  of  natural  capital,  low  returns  on  public  investments,  and  low  economic \ncompetitiveness  are  some  of  the  urban  management  challenges.  Natural  disasters  and  climate-\ninduced impacts add to the associated social, economic, and environment costs of rapid urbanization, \nespecially in the secondary cities with limited capacity to address consequences of rapid urbanization. \nAccording  to  the  National  Climate  Change  Strategy,  Viet  Nam,  since  1963,  experienced  average \ntemperature  rise  of  0.5oC\u20130.7oC;  sea  level  rise  of  20  centimeter;  and  worsening  floods,  storms,  and \ndroughts. 19 This is recognized in the Framework Master Plan for Urban Development in Viet Nam to 2025 \nand Vision to 2050.20  \n \nThe master plan aims to develop secondary cities to divert rural migration away from the large cities \ntoward  secondary  cities  and  to  foster  stronger  urban\u2013rural  links.  It  aims  to  achieve  balanced  and \nstrategic  growth  through  a  national  system  of  capably  managed  urban  centers,  envisaging  secondary \nand  tertiary  cities  as  development  hubs  within  the  provincial  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  strategic  choice  of \ndeveloping provincial capital cities, established governance systems, and regional primacy will unlock \nthe economy of the rural hinterlands through providing connectivity and opportunity for growth, thus \nstrengthening the urban\u2013rural links. Developing provincial capital cities as pilots in different geographic \nregions  will  boost  local  economy,  balance  regional  development,  strengthen  urban\u2013rural  links,  and \naddress the overcrowding of primary urban centers.   \n \nADB\u2019s GrEEEn Cities Initiative and Secondary Cities Development Program \n \nThe  challenge  for  Viet  Nam  is  to  maintain  its  long-term  development  prospects  by  minimizing  risks \nassociated  with  urbanization.  Adapting  critical  infrastructure  by  building  climate  resilience  in  coastal \nand  low-lying  areas  will  safeguard  vulnerable  populations  and  productive  sectors  of  the  economy, \nincluding its natural resources.  \n \nWith urban areas likely to drive economic growth through both rural and regional development, ADB\u2019s \nSecondary  Cities  Development  Program  ([SCDP]  Green  Cities)  is  financing  the  improvements  in \nurban and environmental infrastructure and services in  three secondary cities of Ha Giang, Hue, and \nVinh Yen, facilitating local economic growth and building resilient communities.21 SCDP green growth \nand environmental sustainability focus supports the 10-year strategy from several national programs, \nnamely, the National Green Growth Strategy 2012\u20122020, the National Action Plan on Climate Change \n2012\u20122020, and the National Program on Urban Development 2011\u20122020. \n \nGreen  City  Action  Plans  (GCAPs)  developed  under  the  GrEEEn  Cities  Initiative  are  informing  the \ninvestment  loan  on  a  results-based  lending  modality  for  the  cities  of  Ha  Giang,  Hue,  and  Vinh  Yen \n\n                                                            \n19   Government of Viet Nam. 2011.

Vinh \nYen (Vinh Phuc province) is a satellite town of Ha Noi, strategic for industry situated 20 kilometers away \nfrom the international airport and linked to the hinterland with the ADB-financed Lao Cai Expressway \nstrategic  connectivity  project.  Ha  Giang  (Ha  Giang  province)  is  a  border  town  that  provides  strategic \nconnectivity  with  the  PRC.  Thus  the  SCDP  is  aimed  at  developing  and  demonstrating  different  urban \ngrowth  models  for  climate-resilient  and  economically  competitive  cities  through  the  development  of \nGCAPs  as  investment  plans  for  the  cities.  The  investments  are  for  climate-resilient  environmental \ninfrastructure  prioritized  under  the  GCAPs; \nincreased  community  awareness  of  environmental \nmanagement;  and  decision  support  systems  for  integrated  urban  planning  and  resource  management, \nclimate  change  adaptation,  and  disaster  risk  mitigation.  An  assessment  of  economic  activities  and \nregional economic growth potential has enabled intraregional push\u2013pull analysis to establish a pathway \nfor economic growth and competitiveness within the GrEEEn Cities framework and national policies and \nstrategies  for  green  growth.  The  GCAPs  consider  these  aspects  of  inclusive  and  competitive  growth \nwithin  the  regional  and  national  framework  and  have  been  developed  as  time-based  investment \nprograms  with  potential  financing  solutions.  SCDP  will  thus  support  the  realization  of  the  10-year \nsocioeconomic development strategy\u2019s overall objective of an industrialized Viet Nam in the three cities.  \n \n \nGREATER MEKONG SUBREGION PROGRAM \n \nGreater Mekong Subregion: Corridor Towns Development and Livelihood Support Projects \n \nADB  is  currently  implementing  three  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  loan  projects:  Cambodia: \nSouthern  Economic  Corridor  Towns  Development  Project;  Lao  PDR:  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor \nTowns Development Project; and Viet Nam Corridor Towns Development Project.23 Furthermore, the \nADB  project  for  Livelihood  Support  for  Corridor  Towns  will  assist  the  urban  poor  of  three  selected \ntowns  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  through  microfinance  schemes  and  small  market \nprojects that support income generating livelihood activities, and will be implemented parallel to the \nthree GMS loan projects.  \n \nRationale for Corridor Town Development \n \nThe  focus  on  corridor  town  development  is  a  development  approach  for  balanced  regional \ndevelopment that will maximize the economic benefits of increased trade and traffic flows along the \nmajor  transport  corridors  in  the  GMS  with  the  expected  positive  impacts  resulting  from  accelerated \ninvestments  in  strategically  located  towns  and  cities,  and  added  value  on  economic  growth  through \ndevelopment  oriented  on  green  growth  and  climate  resilience.  The  objective  is  to  strengthen \ncompetitiveness  of  the  GMS  economic  corridors  through  investments  for  the  environmental  and \neconomic infrastructure with equitable growth.  \n \n\n                                                            \n22   ADB. 2008.

The  impact  of  the  corridor  towns  development  projects  would  be  that  these  corridor \ntowns  will  play  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the  regional  competitiveness  of  the  GMS  with  the \nenhancement  of  economic  linkages  to  their  respective  hinterlands,  which  also  impact  local  tourism, \nand the promotion of local products and value chains. Modern environmental services (water, waste \nwater, solid waste management) result in positive health impacts. Improved climate resilience (flood \ncontrol measures) will lead to reduced losses from climate change impacts. Thus the improved urban \nperformance of environmental infrastructure will enhance productivity, and increase the attractiveness \nfor investors and residents to support a transition to a green economy.  \n \n\n \n\nPhoto: ADB (F.

The newly emerging border towns have high growth potential to \nbecome  service  centers  for  the  rural  agricultural  areas,  and  to  provide  transport-related  services, \nemerging  new  industries,  and  tourism.  These  developments  can  contribute  to  enhanced  economic \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction  along  the  economic  corridors.  The  project  for  Livelihood  Support  for \nCorridor Towns is a pilot poverty reduction project in the GMS using a market development approach \nand will complement the urban infrastructure investments under the three loan projects.  \n \nNew  market  trade  centers  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  three  project  towns:  Battambang \n(Cambodia),  Kaysone  Phomvihane  (the  Lao  PDR),  and  Dong  Ha  (Viet  Nam).  This  benefits  market \nvendors  currently  working  as  informal  traders,  targets  the  self-employed  urban  poor  population  in \nthese  towns,  and  supports  the  sale  of  locally  produced  products.  Allocation  of  market  stalls  is  in \nthrough a fair and transparent system with the beneficiaries required to be engaged in informal market \nvending activities, and be members of the market vendors association. There will also be availability of \nmicrofinance to market vendors.  \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nPhoto: ADB (F.

Poverty in Cambodia is widespread with approximately 30% of the rural population live below \nthe poverty line. During 1992\u20132007, the overall national poverty incidence in Cambodia declined to about \n36%, which is high for the region (the poverty incidence in Viet Nam fell to 20% during the same period). \nThe distribution of poverty varies considerably in Cambodia, from less than 15% in the capital to well over \n45%  in  the  northern  and  northeastern  provinces  and  in  the  vicinity  of  Tonle  Sap.  In  Battambang,  the \npoverty  incidence  in  2009  was  18%,  slightly  higher  than  that  in  Phnom  Penh  (15%)  but  lower  than  the \napproximate  national  poverty  incidence  of  36%.  Urban  poverty  also  differs  from  rural  poverty  because \nthe  cost  of  living reference values differ between urban and  rural areas.  Poverty  in the  Lao PDR is  still \nwidespread, with an estimated 34% of the population living below the poverty line and a large proportion \nof  the  population  at  risk  of  sliding  back  into  poverty.  In  Savannakhet  province,  where  Kaysone \nPhomvihane  is  located,  the  reported  poverty  incidence  of  43%  exceeds  the  national  rate.  Kaysone \nPhomvihane  is  also  listed  among  the  poorest  districts  in  the  Savannakhet  province.  Poverty  is \npredominantly rural, with high concentrations in the remote and mountainous northeastern and eastern \nborders  with  Viet  Nam,  As  a  result,  poverty  also  has  a  strong  ethnic  association.  Viet  Nam  has  made \nimpressive progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty incidence declining from 58% in 1993 to 10.6% \nin 2010. Urban poverty in Viet Nam fell from about 25% in 1993 to 4% in 2006. Rural poverty in the same \nperiod  declined  from  66%  to  22%.  However,  while  reductions  in  urban  poverty  in  Ha  Noi  and  Ho  Chi \nMinh City tend to skew national averages, and cities outside the major growth corridors\u2014including those \nin  the  central  provinces  (e.g.,  Dak  Lak,  Pleiku),  the  Mekong  Delta  (e.g.,  Kien  Giang.  Soc  Trang),  the \nnorthern border (e.g., Cao Bang, Lao Cai), and the central coast (Hue, Quang Tri)\u2014still have relatively \nhigh urban poverty rates. In Dong Ha city, poverty incidence in 2010 is 8%, higher than the national urban \npoverty incidence of 4%, but slightly lower than the overall poverty incidence of 10.6% in 2010.24  \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                            \n24   ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\nGMS Mekong Tourism Development Project  \n \nTourism is one of nine areas of subregional cooperation under the GMS program entered by the GMS \ncountries in 1992 to promote development through closer economic links. 25 With the support of ADB \nand  other  development  partners,  the  GMS  program  helps  implement  subregional  projects  to  reduce \npoverty and contribute to the conservation of cultural and natural resources in the subregion. Priorities \nof earlier GMS national tourism development policies include contributing to economic development, \npromoting the country and its products in the global marketplace, enhancing competitiveness in the \ntourism sector, and promoting cooperation with neighboring countries. Recent priorities have become \nnotably more pro-poor and include managing and protecting the environment where the poor reside, \nand ensuring that tourism benefits are spread to the poor and vulnerable groups. \n \nThe GMS program\u2019s role in tourism development has brought about regional collective actions needed \nfor  greater  connectivity  and  integration  of  tourism  plans,  programs,  and  strategies  among  the  GMS \ncountries. The principal goal of GMS regional cooperation strategy and program is to reduce poverty in \nthe Mekong through a 3C program\u2014 enhanced connectivity, increased competitiveness, and greater \nsense of community.   \n \nADB has provided about $38.2 million assistance for the GMS tourism industry; loans comprise 92% or \n$35.0  million,  and  technical  assistance  $3.2  million.  Technical  assistance  was  provided  for  training, \ncapacity  building,  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study  of  priority  tourism  infrastructure  projects,  and \nformulation  of a GMS  regional tourism sector  strategy.26 ADB lending to the sector consists of three \nongoing  loans  to  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam  under  the  GMS  Mekong  Tourism \nDevelopment  Project  (MTDP),  which  aims  to  promote  the  development  of  tourism  in  the  Mekong \nRiver basin. The specific objective of the MTDP was to promote sustainable tourism development in \nthe lower Mekong River basin through infrastructure improvements, increased community and private \nsector  participation  and  subregional  cooperation.  Siem  Reap  and  Phnom  Penh  from  Cambodia  were \nthe participating towns in the project.  \n \nSiem Reap Environmental Improvement \n \nIn 2001, Siem Reap was a fast growing town that attracted 265,000 international tourists. Many hotels \nand  private  houses  discharged  wastewater  into  a  canal  to  the  west  of  the  town,  which  was  heavily \npolluted due to lack of maintenance and encroachment by dwellings, which partially block the canal in \nvarious  places.  The  wastewater  flowed  untreated  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake  or  filtered  into  the  ground, \npolluting the ground water and creating high risks  for the health of the local population and tourists, \nand for the fragile ecosystem of Tonle Sap Lake.  \n \nMTDP rehabilitated the urban sewer on the west side of the town, constructed new connections to the \nsystem,  constructed  stabilizing  lagoons  to  treat  discharges  from  a  population  of  about  17,000  in  the \nwest  part  of  the  town,  and  prepared  a  community  sanitation  and  health  awareness  program.  The \nMTDP achieved the following results:  \n \n\n(i)  International arrivals increased from 264,000 (2002) to 1,305,256 (2012) and rapid increase in \ntourist volumes was indicative of the positive growth trends, which could be sustained by the \nimprovements in urban environmental conditions due to the project.  \n\n                                                            \n25   The  GMS  consists  of  the  following  countries:  Cambodia,  the  PRC  (Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region  and  Yunnan \n\nProvince), Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n\n26   See http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/33310/files/gms-tourism-assessment.pdf \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n25 \n\n \n\n(ii)  Wastewater  discharge  from  residential  housing  and  hotels  in  the  target  area  were  being \nconnected to the new wastewater treatment plant as required by a newly enacted sub-decree. \nThe  reduction  in  flooding  and  separation  of  wastewater  from  storm  water  in  parts  of  Siem \nReap also brought substantial public health benefits.  \n\n(iii) Treatment of wastewater, drainage improvements, and more efficient garbage collection and \ndisposal  had  improved  sanitary  conditions  in  urban  areas  and  catalyzed  public  and  private \ninvestment in tourism-related infrastructure and services. \n\n(iv) The  Project  had  raised  hygiene  awareness  in  Siem  Reap  and  provided  access  to  better \nsanitation  and  sewerage  services  to  an  estimated  116,318  people  in  19,938  households.  These \nreduced communicable disease, lowered health expenditure, and improved productivity.  \n(v) Land previously flooded was reclaimed and used to establish a night market that sustained full-\ntime employment for about 200 women vendors and an additional 600 people who supplied \nthe market and provided ancillary services.  \n\n(vi) International  tourist  spending  in  Siem  Reap  was  estimated  at  $504.3  million  in  2010. \nEmployment  opportunities  and  remittances  for  the  poor  have  grown  due  to  the  tourism \nindustry.  A  recent  study  found  that  over  75%  of  men  and  women  working  in  Siem  Reap  and \nPhnom Penh hotels remit wages of over $1.2 million per month with women now represented \nat least half the tourism industry workforce.   \n\nThus,  the  improvements  in  urban  environmental  infrastructure  in  Siem  Reap  promoted  increased \ntourism, livelihoods, and livability of local residents.   \n \n \nSTRATEGIC POLICY OPTIONS FOR URBAN\u2013RURAL INTEGRATION  \nAND SUSTAINABLE URBANIZATION \n \nBased on the learning from Southeast Asia, the following policy options and actions are suggested for \nurban\u2013rural integration and sustainable urbanization: \n \nStrengthen existing urban settlements through regional balanced development \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBalancing  spatial  settlement  patterns  through  a  focus  on  decentralization  and  balanced \nregional  development  creates  more  efficient  urbanization  centers  and  reduces  spatial \ndisparities  that  will  lead  to  a  sustainable  growth.  Developing  provincial  capital  cities \nbalance regional development, strengthen urban\u2013rural links, and address overcrowding of \nprimary urban centers.  \nEnabling  integrated  urban\u2013rural  spatial  policies  and  planning.  Urban  spatial  policies \nand  urban  planning  can  help  foster  regional  and  local  economic  development  to  enable \nintegration of economic growth and environmental sustainability at all levels and sectors to \nimprove the quality of life for citizens. \nDecentralizing  planning  and  localizing  action. Strengthening the existing urban centers \nwith established regional governance systems enables ownership of actions and boosts the \nlocal economy.  \nPromote economic competitiveness. Build on the existing natural, human resource, and \nrevenue-generating assets of the city and communities. Enhance the ability to realize the \n\n \n\n\f26  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nfull potential of these assets through an enabling policy environment and investments for \nskills and infrastructure development.  \nUnlock  rural  economy  through  improved  connectivity.  National  urban  strategies  and \npolicies  should  enable  infrastructure  and  urban  development  in  existing  secondary  cities \nand  towns.  This  will  strengthen  the  existing  urban  agglomerations  drawing  urban \npopulation  toward  these  secondary  centers  and  take  away  the  pressure  from  the \nmegacities, thus contributing to a sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \nBuild  on  existing  assets  and  skills.  Culture,  heritage,  industry,  and  nature  are  all  assets \nthat  are  often  neglected  in  cities  and  villages.  With  culture  and  tourism  playing  an \nimportant role in a city, joining forces around a shared image of how to develop a city can \nbe  enhanced.  Building  ownership  and  understanding  of  the  city\u2019s  assets  through \nconsultative and visioning processes can enhance the economic potential of the rural and \nurban area. In tourism cities, technical aspects such as infrastructure improvements can be \ncombined  with  the  preservation  and  support  of  cultural  traditions,  thereby  planning  and \nmanaging  a  city\u2019s  different  challenges  in  an  integrated  manner.  For  example,  revenue \ngenerators  such  as  traditional  handicraft  and  old  architecture  are  cultural  and  heritage \nassets that provide authenticity to the tourism industry. These assets need to be supported \nthrough  investments  in  heritage  conservation,  urban  upgrading,  SME  development  and \ncapacity trainings to preserve local skills. Traditional skills are often practiced by minority \nethnic  groups  and  particularly  by  women.  Economic  support  policies  can  be  specifically \ntailored and targeted to be inclusive. \n\nEconomically vibrant and well-restored heritage street in Hangzhou, Zheizang province,  \nthe People's Republic of China. \n\nPhoto \u00a9 Ramola Naik Singru, 2014. \n\n \nUrban Models of Growth \n \nNew  urban  models  of  growth  are  emerging.  Investing  in  development  of  these  new  emerging  spatial \nforms provide valuable lessons for the cities in Southeast Asia to learn from each other.  \n \n\n \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n27 \n\n \n\nClustered Development  \n \n\n(i)  Supporting clustered economies of small urban areas around the core. Development of a \ncluster of urban areas or satellite cities around the core urban area provides opportunity for a \nmutually  beneficial  relationship  between  the  cities.  Cities  often  develop  engulfing  specific \nclusters that may have specialized skills, such as the leather industry in Dharavi in Mumbai or \nthe  metal  handicrafts  industry  in  Hue  in  Viet  Nam.  Unless  these  specialized  industries  are \nprovided  adequate  support  to  enhance  their  business  practices,  streamline  environmental \npractices and connect to relevant markets, the clusters will lose their competitive advantage of \nbeing close to the city core.  \n\n(ii)  Feasible  urban  infrastructure  development  and  service  delivery.  Clustered  development \napproach  for  small  towns  also  enables  clustering  of  infrastructure  such  as  a  regional  landfill, \nmakes infrastructure financially sustainable for the population sizes.  \n\n(iii) Co-benefits of clustered economy. \n\n \nSatellite Cities  \n \nMegacities  will  continue  to  grow  but  the  pressure  on  these  cities  can  be  reduced  by  providing \nconnectivity  and  urban  infrastructure  services  to  the  satellite  towns  around  these  large  urban \nagglomerations.  Satellite  cities  are  developed  through  a  symbiotic  relationship  in  close  proximity  to \nlarge  cities.  Rather  than  being  just  residential  suburbs,  satellite  cities  can  become  niche  market \nlocations in their own right benefiting from the proximity to the large city where a pool of specialized \nservices such as financiers, lawyers, insurers etc. are available. Further, the proximity to a megacity or \nmetropolitan city includes easy access to multinational companies and connectivity to global markets \nthrough  an  international  airport.  On  the  other  hand  the  metropolitan  area  benefits  from  the \nmanufacturing  and  secondary  services  located  in  the  satellite  cities  with  efficient  back  office \noperations.  Metro  Manila  has  benefited  from  the  location  of  many  business  process  outsourcing \ncompanies located in satellite cities such as Alabang. Vinh Yen, a satellite city of Ha Noi in Viet Nam is \naiming to set itself up as the industrial export hub for Viet Nam.  \n \nCorridor Town Development \n \n\n(i)  Enhances  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  corridor  towns  can  play  an \nimportant role in enhancing the regional competitiveness by enhancing economic linkages to \ntheir respective hinterlands thus enhancing economic growth and leading to poverty reduction.  \n(ii)  Market development approach. Corridor town development improves market connectivity of \nthe  hinterland  with  a  positive  impact  on  the  local  economy,  the  promotion  of  local  products \nand value chains, and improved local tourism. \n\n \nOptimizing Synergistic Cross-Sector Benefits  \n \nSome areas of activity underscore the interrelation between tourism, environmental management, and \nurban\u2013rural  development.  The  following  points  highlight  some  of  these  areas  where  synergistic \nbenefits can be achieved.  \n \n\n(i)  Supporting  SME  clusters.  A  positive  development  in  the  tourism  sector  results  in  an \nincreased  number  of  visitors  and  increased  spending.  SMEs  are  the  backbone  of  the  tourism \nsector  and  would  benefit  directly  from  such  increased  numbers.  Clustered  development  can \nenhance growth in the SME tourism sector.  \n\n \n\n\f28  \n\nADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series No. 11 \n\n \n\n(ii)  Improving  infrastructure  and  services.  The  tourism  industry,  especially  with  increased \nnumbers  of  visitors,  depends  on  improved  facilities  and  infrastructure.  Such  infrastructure  is \nbeneficial  to  both  visitors  and  residents.  There  are  various  action  areas,  ranging  from  small \nimprovements  in  signage,  public  restrooms,  and  public  space  management  to  larger  scale \nimprovements  in  urban  design,  drainage,  and  traffic  systems.  As  previous  ADB  projects  have \nproven, such infrastructure and services improvements provide employment opportunities for \nresidents.  Furthermore,  the  increased  number  of  visitors  offers  different  opportunities  for \nfinancing the provision, upgrading, and maintenance of infrastructure and services (visitor\u2019s tax, \nfees for use of certain facilities, traffic tolls for tourist buses, etc.), at the same time\u201d replace the \nsentence with \u201cSimultaneously, there is increased pressure on facilities and infrastructure with \nthe  increasing  number  of  visitors  which  requires  systematic  planning  and  management  to \naddress this situation proactively. \n\n(iii) Enhancing  competencies  and  capacities  through  partnerships.  At  a  higher  level  of  skills, \nthere  is  low  capacity  even  among  architects  and  planners  in  the  GMS  region  on  heritage \nconservation practices starting with identification, designation, and restoration of conservation \nzones. Bilateral projects, such as India\u2019s engagement in the restoration of the temple complex \nin Angkor Wat since 1986 and more recently in the restoration of the Ta Prom Temple, have \nshown  that  capacities  can  be  built  and  improved  with  such  institutional  cooperation.  The \nGrEEEn  City  Initiative\u2019s  concept  of  Urban  Management  Partnerships  is  another  example  of \nbringing together more experienced actors in tourism development with other actors willing to \nlearn and apply lessons learnt and best practices. This approach would directly be in line with \nthe objective of increased cooperation and exchange among GMS countries.  \nGoing beyond the traditional perspective of local actors on the one hand and external actors \non the other, one also needs to think about tourists in the sense of visitors who might consider \nstaying longer and even investing in the places they visited beforehand. There is some potential \nof  entrepreneurs  opening  up  their  own  (subsidiary)  offices,  scaling  up  their  activities,  and \nteaming  up  with  local  entrepreneurs.  Often  these  kinds  of  operations  include  the  training  of \nlocal staff, directly leading to increased competencies and capacities. For this to happen, the \ngovernment needs to provide an enabling environment with regard to policies, the regulatory \nframework, and the provision of infrastructure and services. \n\nis  an \n\n(iv) Benefitting  socioeconomic  development.  Tourism \n\nin \nsocioeconomic  development,  as  social  contacts  between  tourists  and  locals  increase  mutual \nunderstanding  and  cultural  exchange.  Additionally,  integrated  urban  development  should  be \nbased  on  participatory  processes  and  the  buy-in  of  key  stakeholders.  The  specific \ndevelopment  of  a  sustainable  tourism  industry  and  location  could  bring  several  benefits: \nincreased numbers (and higher spending) of visitors, growth in an economically high-potential \nniche  market  (which  is  on  the  rise  in  Asia),  environmentally  and  financially  more  efficient \nresource  use  due  to  improved  infrastructure  systems,  increased  environmental  quality  and \nlivability for visitors and residents.  \n\ninstrument \n\nimportant \n\n \nThe city governments in collaboration with development partners, private sector, and civil society can \nintegrated \nthus  take  the \ndevelopment based on a shared vision of how urbanization and economic growth can be achieved in \nan environmentally friendly, socially inclusive, and financially viable manner. \n \n\nin  optimizing  cross-sector  synergies  to  enhance  urban\u2013urban \n\nlead \n\n \n\n\fRegional Balanced Urbanization for Inclusive Cities Development \n\n29 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nADB. 2008.

While the relationship between urbanization and \ngrowth (and poverty reduction in general) is often well-established, less is discussed about the forms and \ncauses of newly emerging urban poverty and exclusion, and how they differ for different city sizes. This paper \nanalyzes the potential for poverty reduction with balanced regional urbanization through the development of \nsecond-tier cities and secondary towns in Southeast Asia. It discusses the spatial growth patterns that have \nan impact on sustainable development and urban\u2013rural poverty linkages\u00a0and\u00a0suggests policy options and \nactions for urban\u2013rural integration and sustainable urbanization. It\u00a0proposes strategies for sustainable urban \ndevelopment through a regional balanced development approach using different urban growth models to \nreduce spatial disparities\u00a0and\u00a0optimize cross-sector synergies.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
