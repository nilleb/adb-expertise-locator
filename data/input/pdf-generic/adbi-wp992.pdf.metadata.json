As one of the \nhydrocarbon producers of the world, Azerbaijan is looking to generate 20% of its electricity \nfrom  renewable  sources  by  2020.  Aiming  to  minimize  its  energy  insecurity  problems  and \nensure the country\u2019s energy security, Azerbaijan has established its RES policies according \nto  the  norms  of  sustainable  development  while  simultaneously  securing  an  uninterrupted \nsupply  of  energy.

INTRODUCTION \n\nU. Aydin \n\nAs  a  result  of  the  accident  at  the  Mingachevir  Thermal  Power  Plant  on  3  July  2018, \nelectricity was cut off in in most of Azerbaijan, including 39 regions of the country, the \ncapital  Baku,  and  the  major  cities  of  Ganja  and  Sumgait.  The  electricity  supply  was \ndisrupted for the Baku subway, Azersu (which supplies water and sanitation services), \nthe  State  Oil  Company  of  Azerbaijan  Republic\u2019s  (SOCAR)  large-scale  production \nfacilities,  industrial  enterprises,  health  care  centers,  and  other  facilities  with  strategic \nimportance. Interruptions in power supply caused disruptions in the movement of trains \non the Baku metro and water distribution in the cities, as well as railway schedule delays \nthroughout  the  country.  Serious  problems  occurred  in  hospitals,  especially  in  the \ndepartments of surgery, intensive care, obstetrics, and premature birth units.  \n\nAzerenergy OJSC and the Ministry of Energy of Azerbaijan tried to explain the accident, \nciting a sharp increase in outdoor temperatures and a resulting 40% increase in energy \ndemand.  These  statements  did  not  satisfy  the  public  in  light  of  the  public  programs \nimplemented to strengthen the country\u2019s energy security and the funds allocated for that \npurpose for many years. Official investigations revealed that the causes of the accident \nwere completely different and included high imbalance between the plant\u2019s infrastructure \nand workload; old equipment; false risk assessments; weak security measures; lack of \nrenewable  energy  source  (RES)  stations  to  compensate  for  power  disruption  during \nperiods of extreme heat, and the poor performance of the responsible organizations who \nfocused  mainly  on  initiatives  rather  than  acting  in  accordance  with  the  strategic \ndevelopment plan. \n\nThe accident revealed all aspects of energy insecurity in Azerbaijan, including technical \nshortcomings, poor electricity supply system diversification, and lack of risk elimination \nfor  the  country\u2019s  economy,  including  strategic  enterprises.  The  activities  of  the \norganizations  responsible  for  the  country\u2019s  energy  security  were  also  not  organized \nsystematically  and  the  electricity  production  and  supply  systems  were  not  properly \nintegrated.  The  state  funds  allocated  for  the  development  and  strengthening  of  the \nelectricity  supply  system  were  spent  inefficiently.  One  of  the  significant  facts  is  about \nalternative energy policy, which has not been coordinated with energy security policy of \nthe country. \n\nHowever,  Azerbaijan  is  an  oil-producing  country  that  is  developing  and  implementing \npolicies  in  line  with  the  rising  trend  in  RES  to  achieve  sustainable  economic  growth, \nensure  energy  security,  and  increase  the  share  of  non-oil  sectors  in  the  national \neconomy.  Renewable  energy  is  one  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  strategic  priorities,  because  the \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  sector  in  Azerbaijan  are  not  only  in  line  with \nenvironmental  goals  for  the  reduction  of  carbon  emissions  to  reach  Paris  Agreement \ntargets,  but  also  to  diversify  the  energy  basket  and  increasing  energy  security \n(Taghizadeh-Hesary  et  al.  2019).  In  other  words,  as  an  important  part  of  its  national \nsecurity  goals,  Azerbaijan  aims  to  use  renewable  energy  sources  alongside  fossil \nresources to guarantee energy security and minimize the risk of energy insecurity. It aims \nto  solve  the  problems  that  may  arise  in  the  country\u2019s  energy  supply  with  renewable \nresources,  which  are  attractive  due  to  their  environment-friendly  features.  The \naforementioned  accident,  however,  revealed  that  Azerbaijan  must  still  face  serious \nchallenges before achieving its goals. \n\nThis paper defines the prospects and challenges for Azerbaijan\u2019s use of RES to decrease \nits energy insecurity. Following consideration of the Mingachevir Thermal Power Plant \naccident  in  this  first  section,  the  second  section  of  this  study  presents  the  research \nbackground, emphasizing the increasing importance of RES within the context of energy \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nsecurity  and  insecurity.  The  second  section  also  builds  a  sustainable  development \nequation and outlines a map of Azerbaijan\u2019s current energy security and insecurity. Third \nsection  presents  the  legal  framework  for  the  environment  and  energy  issues  in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s sustainable development agenda based on policy documents and sources. \nThe fourth section considers the present situation of RES transformation attempts using \nofficial statistical data. The achievements, potential, and deficiencies within Azerbaijan\u2019s \ncurrent legal framework in the RES sector are also analyzed. The conclusion includes \nthe research findings and suggestions for future study.  \n\n2.  BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH \n\nThe  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  defines  energy  security  as  \u201cthe  uninterrupted \navailability  of  energy  sources  at  an  affordable  price\u201d  (IEA  2014).  Energy  insecurity, \ntherefore, is a lack of the ability to provide or ensure the constant accessibility of energy \nsources  at  a  fair  price.  The  absence  of  energy  security  and  the  existence  of  energy \ninsecurity  lead  to  negative  economic  and  social  effects  for  national  economies.  The \nemergence of the sustainable development concept has, however, emphasized the need \nto respect environmental concerns when making use of energy resources. \n\nRES  is  an  option  both  to  ensure  energy  security  and  for  sustainable  development. \nRenewable  energy  is  commonly  defined  as  energy  generated  from  solar,  wind, \ngeothermal, tide and wave, wood, waste, and biomass (Yazdi and Shakouri 2017). The \nenergy  produced  from  RES  plays  an  important  role  in  decreasing  energy  insecurity, \ncontributing to energy security, and diversifying energy consumption. Used principally by \nthe electricity sector to decrease shortages and lack of access, a significant expansion \nin renewable energy has been encouraged by technological advances and the reduced \ncosts of transportation and communication (Yazdi and Shakouri 2017).  \n\nDespite  a  large  and  increasing  interest  in  renewable  energy,  it  still  faces  some \nchallenges. Examining renewable energy development in Malaysia, Mustapa, Peng, and \nHashim  (2010)  found  the  following  four  major  challenges:  financial  barriers,  technical \nbarriers, institutional/regulatory barriers, and information barriers. The cost of renewable \ninvestments\u2014exactly  capital  costs\u2014is  higher  due  to  new  technologies,  and  there  is \nuncertainty about renewable energy because of the novelty of the technologies used and \nthe nature of renewable energy itself (e.g., weather conditions). It is less expensive to \noperate  RES,  but  the  establishment  such  systems  is  costly.  Financial  institutions  are \ntherefore reluctant to support the renewable energy sector because the start-up cost is \nperceived as a risk. Area conditions, infrastructure type, and means of transportation and \ncommunication pose technical obstacles for the development of renewable energy. An \ninsufficient legal framework, governmental institutions, and policies, as well as public-\nprivate partnerships to encourage renewable energy also prevent progress in the sector. \nMost services are still not aware of the full value of RES. Energy investors often think \nabout  narrow  value  parameters  and  miss  the  big-picture,  long-term  opportunities  that \nRES promise. Lack of information and awareness about the benefits of RES and poor \npublic opinion on renewable energy usage have had a negative effect on the sector\u2019s \ndevelopment. Increased awareness and willingness are needed. While these challenges \ndiffer from country to country, in developing countries, generally all of these challenges \nmust be faced simultaneously.  \n\nThe state is a key stakeholder in the field of energy security in Azerbaijan, and there are \nnumerous institutional mechanisms to manage and control the domestic energy market \nand oil and gas exports. The Ministry of Energy is the main executive body responsible \nfor implementing state policy and regulations in the energy sector and providing for the \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nenergy security of the country. It should be noted, however, that SOCAR is the prime \norganization representing the government in conducting international oil policy and has \nbeen directly involved in major oil and gas contracts as a shareholder. SOCAR plays a \ncentral  role  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  strategic  sector  and  the  many  international  oil  and  gas \nexploration projects and extraction fields. The Ministry of Energy plays a more symbolic \nrole in the energy sector, while major energy projects are under SOCAR\u2019s control. \n\nAzerbaijan's  electricity  sector  is  controlled  by  Azenergy  OJSC,  an  independent  \nstate-owned company, and is a vertically integrated monopoly system. This institution \nmanages the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity, and is responsible \nfor  domestic  electricity  supply  to  the  country\u2019s  electricity  system.  The  main  fuel  used  \nfor  domestic  energy  consumption  is  natural  gas,  both  for  the  population  as  a  whole  \nand for industry. The transportation system, meanwhile, uses oil products, so natural gas \nand  oil  are  the  basis  of  internal  energy  consumption,  as  well  as  the  country\u2019s  energy \nsecurity. \n\nUp to 2005, the main power plants were insufficient to produce the electricity needed in \nthe country. The lack of sufficient electricity, gas, and heat caused regional imbalances \nin  the  country,  with  the  supply  of  electricity  lasting  only  a  few  hours  a  day,  along  \nwith frequent interruptions in supply and periodic malfunctions in the system. The low \nquality  and  intermittent  power  supply  hindered  industrial,  agricultural, and  commercial \nactivities, as well as economic growth and employment opportunities. \n\nThe State Program on the Development of the Fuel-Energy Complex (2005\u20132015) of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan and the Additional Measures to Improve the Electricity Supply in \nthe  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  were  a  turning  point  in  reliable  energy  access,  energy \nsecurity,  and  the  creation  of  new  energy  sources  for  the  country.  In  addition  to  the \nimplementation of the State Program, with the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  within  the  framework  of  an  Improvement  of  Energy  Transmission  project, \nmeasures  were  taken  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  electricity  supply  and  restore  \nthe  electricity  network,  to  develop  alternative  and  renewable  energy  sources,  and  \nto  maximize  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation.  Recent  trends  towards \ndecreasing  energy  insecurity  have  included  preventing  energy  losses  in  the  domestic \nmarket,  increasing  energy  savings,  enhancing  customer  service,  and  providing  \nreliable energy. \n\nWhen  oil  prices  were  higher  and  there  were,  accordingly,  higher  fiscal  revenues,  the \ninfrastructure costs of the Azerenergy OJSC were also high. The state budget was one \nof  the  main  financial  sources  of  the  organization.  To  subsidize  the  losses  related  to \nSOCAR\u2019s  sale  of  natural  gas  to  Azerenergy  OJSC  at  a  price  lower  than  the  contract \nvalue,  300  million  manat  was  allocated  from  the  state  budget  (Hasanov  2018).  The \ndecline  in  oil  prices  has  forced  the  government  to  accelerate  reforms  in  the  domestic \nelectricity sector. Achieving productivity in the domestic electricity market would increase \nAzerbaijan\u2019s potential to sell more energy to neighboring countries such as the Russian \nFederation,  Iran,  Turkey,  and  Georgia,  which  could  compensate  for  losses  related  to \nfalling oil prices.  \n\nIt has not, however, been possible to achieve serious quality changes in the electricity \nsupply  system,  which  is  the  key  component  of  energy  security  in  the  country.  Most  \nof the domestic energy infrastructure has deteriorated, which has caused frequent short \ncircuits,  energy  cuts,  and  energy  losses.  Out-of-date  technologies  and  electrical \nequipment  have  decreased  the  reliability  and  efficiency  of  energy  system  operation, \nwhile the lack of a reliable energy supply in the country is one of the main energy security \nconcerns  for  the  government.  Recent  structural  reforms  have  aimed  to  reduce  this \ninternal energy security problem. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nThe general population and the commercial and public sectors are the main consumers \nof electricity in Azerbaijan. The change in tariffs for electricity and gas has always had a \nsignificant impact on consumers. Electricity tariffs were raised three times in 2007 for the \nfirst time since 1997, which has forced many consumers to use natural gas, which has \nled to electricity savings and exports (Aliyeva and Veliyev 2016). Fossil fuels therefore \nretain  their  importance  for  energy  consumption  in  Azerbaijan.  Ensuring  the  country\u2019s \nenergy  security  will,  however,  require  using  RES.  Rovnag  Abdullayev,  president  of \nSOCAR,  noted  \u201cthe  diversification  and  security  of  energy  supplies,  the  deepening  of \nenergy market reforms, the development and modernization of energy infrastructures, \nenergy  efficiency,  energy  savings  and  the  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  are  key \nconcerns\u201d of Azerbaijan\u2019s energy security (SOCAR 2014). More has been improved and \naccomplished  for  the  concerns  related  to  fossil  fuels,  their  export,  and  transportation \nwithin the country\u2019s energy security than for RES issues.  \n\nNew  achievements  have  been  made  in  the  energy  sector  since  2003.  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nelectricity system  and  power  generation  infrastructure  have  been  reconstructed,  trunk \nlines have been renewed within the country and in connection to other countries, and a \nnumber of large and small power stations have been built in cities and districts. Although \nthe  national  electricity  system  has  been  reinstalled  to  meet  European  Union  (EU) \nstandards,  to  reduce  the  demand  for  domestic  energy  and  to  sell  electrical  energy  to \nneighboring countries, the July 2018 accident showed that Azerbaijan still faces serious \nchallenges  in  terms  of  energy  insecurity.  That  the  country  cannot  reach  the  desired \nrenewable  energy  use,  along  with  the  failure  to  obtain  power  from  RES  in  case  of \nnecessity,  has  led  to  the  question  energy  security  and  insecurity  in  Azerbaijan.  The \naccident  revealed  the  need  to  revise  alternative  energy  policies  from  the  context  of \nenergy  security  and  diversify  access  to  electricity  through  several  sources,  including \nRES, for strategically important public organizations. \n\n3.  ENVIRONMENT \u2013 ENERGY ISSUES  \nIN AZERBAIJAN\u2019S SUSTAINABLE  \nDEVELOPMENT AGENDA \n\n3.1  Environmental Policy \n\nEnvironmental  issues  in  Azerbaijan  have  appeared  in  several  official  documents.  \nThe  country\u2019s  environmental  policy  has  mainly  focused  on  three  aspects  shaped  by \nexisting environmental circumstances and socio-economic conditions. As the security of \nenvironment is of primary importance, policy first of all focuses on reducing the human \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  coordinating  environmental  protection  using  best \npractices for sustainable development. Considering the demands of present and future \ngenerations,  the  second  focus  of  the  policy  is  towards  an  effective  use  of  natural \nresources,  including  RES.  Evaluation  of  the  country\u2019s  needs  for  global  environmental \nmatters, producing solutions for them, and acting on solutions through cooperation with \ninternational  organizations  is  the  third  aspect  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  environmental  policy  \n(Zo\u00ef Environment Network 2011).  \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nSome obligations and principles are defined for the achievement of environmental policy \ngoals, including improving the environment through support of successful experiences \nof  human  resource  management,  as  well  as  encouragement  of  the  economic  models \nand  technologies  needed  for  the  safety  of  present  and  future  generations  (Zo\u00ef \nEnvironment  Network  2011).  The  Constitution  of  Azerbaijan  has  defined  \u201cliving  in  a \nhealthy  and  clean  environment  as  a  right  of  the  country\u2019s  citizens\u201d  (Zo\u00ef  Environment \nNetwork 2011). This right forms a basis for environmental legislation. At the beginning of \nthe 1990s, the State Committee for the Environment developed the Ecological Concept \nof the Republic of Azerbaijan, specifying the foundation for Azerbaijan\u2019s state policy on \nenvironmental  protection.  As  a  part  of  Agenda  21  of  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  Conference, \necological  security  norms  have  focused  on  environmental  security  and  progression  in \necological  situation  in  Azerbaijan.  To  take  precautions  to  improve  the  environment, \nspecial emphasis and general provisions have been defined including the \u201cprotection of \nthe  biosphere,  continuous  utilization  of  natural  resources,  decrease  and  disposal  of \nwaste,  rational  use  of  energy  and  reduction  of  risk  associated  with  human  activity\u201d \n(Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources [MENR] 2019).  \n\nTo  achieve  these  goals,  the  first  National  Environmental  Action  Plan  (NEAP)  of \nAzerbaijan  was  developed  between  1995  and  1998  with  World  Bank  assistance,  in \nparallel with the first wave of NEAPs in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia \nafter the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Both the Law on Environmental Protection and \nthe Law on Environmental Safety were adopted in 1999. These two laws defined \u201cthe \nrights  and  responsibilities  of  government,  citizens,  public  associations  and  local \nauthorities;  use  of  natural  resources;  state  registry  of  natural  resources  of  the \nenvironment, monitoring, standardization and certification on environmental protection \nand  safety\u201d  (Zo\u00ef  Environment  Network  2011).  These  legal  documents  involve \n\u201ceconomical  regulation  of  environmental  protection  and  ecological  terms  required  for \nimplementation of economic activities.\u201d The laws aim \u201cto promote education, research, \nstatistics and information on environment; environmental emergency response situations \nand  zones  of  ecological  disasters;  control  on  environmental  protection,  impact \nassessment;  inspection  and  audit;  responsibility  for  the  violation  of  environmental \nlegislation and international cooperation\u201d (Zo\u00ef Environment Network 2011). The Law on \nEnvironmental  Protection  concerns  \u201call  means  (water,  soil,  air),  waste  management, \nprotection of fauna, protected areas and ecological expertise\u201d, stating \u201cthe order for the \nprotection of atmospheric air, water objects, and soils, organization of waste collection \nand  disposal,  animal  world  protection,  operation  of  specially  protected  areas\u201d  (Zo\u00ef \nEnvironment Network 2011).  \n\nFollowing the passage of these laws, strategic documents such as the 2003 and 2008 \nState Program on Poverty and Economic Development (SPPRED) and the 2003 State \nProgram  for  Environmentally  Sustainable  Economic  Development  (SPESEC)  restated \nand  added  to  Azerbaijan\u2019s  environmental  priorities  (ADB  2005).  During  the  country\u2019s \ntransition  period,  international,  regional,  and  intergovernmental  collaborations  were \ndeveloped,  and  Azerbaijan  has  joined  twenty  concerned  conventions,  like  the  United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The State \nCommission on Climate Change was established in 1997 (ADB 2010: 11). In 2012 the \ngovernment of Azerbaijan accepted the development plan \u201cAzerbaijan 2020: Look into \nthe Future,\u201d through which it aimed to set higher development goals parallel to modern \nglobal  challenges,  including  environmental  concerns.  Azerbaijan  2020  stresses  the \nprobable effects of climate change on the country\u2019s society and economy, underlining \nthe need for preparation in policy measures. The plan argues that the quantity of energy \nconsumed and CO2 released for the production of one unit of GDP must be analogous \nwith the matching OECD member country norms by 2020.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nSince 1990 industrial activity in Azerbaijan has slowed, and the rate of greenhouse gas \nemissions  has  decreased  correspondingly.  Difficult  economic  conditions  have  also \nlimited  the  government\u2019s  abilities  to  take  measures  in  the  same  period.  Thus,  the \npollution rate accounted for 71.1 MTOE of CO2 in the 1990s, which has calculated at \nmore  than  an  average  of  50.0  MTOE  of  CO2  in  the  2000s  (The  State  Statistical \nCommittee of the Republic of Azerbaijan [SSCRA] 2017). Energy and total land use and \ncorresponding changes (both including and excluding forestry) are the main sectors in \nthe  atmosphere.  Depending  \nAzerbaijan \non  economic  growth,  especially  with  the  start  of  the  Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan  pipeline, \nsignificant  increases  have  been  observed  in  the  amount  of  funding  allocated  for \nenvironmental protection by the government. However, economic constriction due to oil \nprices has once again reduced governmental expenditures for environmental issues. \n\nthat  emit  greenhouse  gasses \n\ninto \n\n3.2  Energy Policy \n\nDue to its historic oil industry, which dates from the 1840s, rather than the quantity of its \noil reserves, Azerbaijan is well known as one of the world\u2019s energy producing countries. \nAs oil and natural gas exports are the main income source for the national budget, the \nenergy  sector  is  a  mirror  of  as  well  as  a  driving  force  for  economic  development  in \nAzerbaijan  (Flegel  2016).  Azerbaijan\u2019s  energy  policy  therefore  mainly  focuses  on  the \nproduction, export, and transportation strategies for fossil energy resources, as well as \nregulation  of  the  electricity  sector,  management  of  energy  revenues,  and  energy \nsustainability, including environmental issues and RES. The four laws on the Utilization \nof  Energy  Resources,  Energy,  Electric  Energy,  and  Electric  and  Heat  Power  Plants, \nrespectively, created the early legal framework for the country\u2019s energy development and \nRES. The law on the Utilization of Energy Resources, No. 94-IQ, dated 30 May 1996, \ndefined the legal, economic, and social framework of governmental policy on the use of \nenergy  resources,  as  well  as  the  main  directions  for  the  law\u2019s  implementation,  and \nregulation relations between the state and legal and physical persons (The Ministry of \nEnergy of Azerbaijan Republic [ME] 2018). The state\u2019s energy policy is clearly defined in \narticle 3 of the law on Energy of Azerbaijan, No. 541, dated 24 November 1998, which \nruns as follows:  \n\n1.  Effective  production,  transportation,  distribution,  storage,  use  and  safety  of \n\nenergy products.  \n\n2.  Creation of infrastructure that will provide efficient energy supply to all consumers \nand  to  create  new  workplaces;  establishment  of  competition  and  minimal \nmonopoly  conditions  in  energy  sector;  organization  of  activities  in  the  energy \nsector on the basis of various types of ownership, long-term contracts and special \npermits;  creation  of  favorable  conditions  for  local  businesses  producing  high \nquality products; creation of favorable conditions for the application of efficient \nand environmentally safe technologies. \n\n3.  Conservation of energy resources, reduction of waste amounts, efficient use of \n\nenergy and use of RES. \n\n4.  Reduction of negative impact on the environment. \n\n5.  In case of energy shortage, to provide subsidies to producers and consumers to \n\nincrease energy efficiency. \n\n6.  To create favorable legal and economic conditions for investments. \n\n7.  Development of state energy programs (ME 2018). \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nThe  law  on  Electric  Energy,  No.  459-IQ,  dated  3  April  1998,  sets  out  the  legal  basis  \nfor  the  production,  transportation,  distribution,  purchase,  and  sale  of  electricity  and  \nheat  energy.  The  main  purpose  of  this  law  is  to  use  energy  resources  efficiently  by \nincluding  environmental  care  in  the  energy  market  in  a  socially  sound  manner,  in  the \ninterest of energy production and consumption (ME 2018). The law on Electric Power \nand Heat Stations, No. 784-IQ, dated 28 December 1999, determines the legal basis for \nthe  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  permanent  facilities  producing  electric  and \nthermal  energy  in  accordance  with  the  legislation  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  (ME \n2018). \n\nThese  laws are  the country\u2019s  initial energy  legislation,  which  were  enacted  in  the first \nyears of independence and involve the fundamental urgent issues of that period based \non the primary energy resource\u2014fossil fuels. None of these legal documents explicitly \nincludes  renewable  energy.  Thus,  the  1990s  can  be  considered  the  first  stage  of  \nthe  formation  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  energy  policy,  focusing  mainly  on  environmental  and \necological concerns rather than renewability. This situation can be accepted as usual for \na country going through a transition period and focusing on the recovery of its economy; \nunder the existing conditions of that period, sustainability could only be considered at a \nfuture stage.  \n\nThe State Program on the Use of Alternative and RES in the Republic of Azerbaijan was \napproved by Presidential Order No. 462, dated 21 October 2004, and was a new pillar \nfor Azerbaijan\u2019s energy policy. The objective of the State Program was to promote power \ngeneration  from  renewable  and  environmentally  sound  sources  and  to  utilize \nhydrocarbon  energy  sources  more  efficiently.  The  major  tasks  of  the  State  Program \nincluded defining \u201cpotential of alternative (renewable) energy sources for electric power \ngeneration\u201d  and  raising  \u201cefficiency  of  utilization  of  country\u2019s  energy  sources  by \ndeveloping  RES\u201d  and  \u201cto  ensure  the  opening  of  additional  jobs  with  creation  of  new \nenergy  production  sites;  and  given  the  existing  total  capacity  of  traditional  energy \nsources  in  Azerbaijan,  to  increase  the  energy  capacities  at  the  expense  of  RES  and \ntherefore,  achieve  the  country\u2019s  energy  security\u201d  (State  Agency  for  Alternative  and \nRenewable Sources (SAARES) 2019). \n\nSome  of  the  goals  of  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  of  2006  signed  between  \nthe  EU  and  Azerbaijan  overlap  with  the  objectives  of  the  State  Program,  including \n\u201cmodernization  of  the  electric  grid,  enhance  the  security  and  reliability  of  the  energy \ninfrastructure; preparation of programs and regulations for the development of renewable \nenergy  sector  and  achievement  the  efficient  use  of  energy.\u201d  Within  the  framework  of \nState Program, SAARES was established under the auspices of the Ministry of Industry \nand Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2009. In December 2011 a second long-\nterm  government  strategy  for  the  development  of  alternative  and  RES  for  the  years \n2012\u20132020  was  accepted  in  line  with  the  EU\u2019s  2006  climate  and  energy  policy  for \nworldwide 20/20/20 targets (Caspian Information Centre 2013). While energy efficiency, \nrenewable energy, security of supply, ecologic security, and cost effectiveness were the \nmain  concepts  of  the  strategy,  stabilizing  the  final  energy  consumption  was  the  key \nfunction of the strategy\u2019s structure. The Strategy aims to reduce 20% greenhouse gas \nemission from 1990 levels, to scale up the rate of renewable energy by up to 20% in \nusing  electricity  as  well  as  to  increase  energy  efficiency  by  20%  by  2020  (Caspian \nInformation Centre 2013: 4). To improve management in this sector, SAARES and the \nagency\u2019s  AzAlternativEnerji  LLC  were  established  in  2013.  SAARES  is  the  central \nexecutive authority that implements state policy on and regulatory control over alternative \nand renewable energy and its sound management, and the agency ensures the effective \norganization of activities concerning alternative and RES, as well as coordination and \nstate control in this field. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nThe  agency  participates  in  the  development  of  a  unified  state  policy  for  its  areas  of \nauthority  and  ensures  implementation  of  that  policy.  It  also  oversees  progress  in  \nthe  alternative  and  renewable  energy  field,  establishing  the  required  infrastructure,  \nand  ensuring  the  application  of  alternative  and  renewable  energy  in  the  economic  \nand  social  fields.  SAARES  is  also  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  measures \nrelated to power generation, energy consumption, and energy efficiency using alternative \nand RES, as well as conducting relevant state registration and inventory. The Republic \nof  Azerbaijan  has  been  a  member  of  the  International  Renewable  Energy  Agency \n(IRENA)  since  2014.  In  2014  the  state  program  for  the  development  of  industry  in \nAzerbaijan  for  2015\u20132020  was  accepted,  which  strategically  supports  the  progress  of \nRES. The drafts of the Law on the use of alternative and RES and on Energy Efficiency \nare  currently  being  reviewed  by  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Cabinet  of  Ministers.  In  the  post-\nindependence period, energy policy has transformed in parallel with the development of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  economy.  As  mentioned  earlier,  while  the  energy  policy  of  the  country \nfocused on recovery-oriented activities in the 1990s, it evolved towards sustainability in \nthe 2000s thanks to the opportunities provided by economic development. As a result, \nthe issues of RES have become integrated into the country\u2019s energy and environment \npolicies. \n\n4.  AZERBAIJAN\u2019S ATTEMPTS AT RENEWABLE \n\nENERGY TRANSFORMATION: ACHIEVEMENTS  \nAND POTENTIAL  \n\nThe geographic conditions of Azerbaijan create a favorable environment for progress in \nthe country\u2019s renewable energy sector. The technical potential of RES in Azerbaijan is \naccounted to be approximately 130,000 MW/year (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Azerbaijan\u2019s Technical RES Potential \n\nType of RES \nSolar \nWind \nBioenergy \nGeothermal \nSmall hydropower \nTotal  \n\nCapacity, MW/billion kW \n>115,200 \n>15,000 \n>900 \n>200 \n>650 \n>130,000 \n\nSource: IREA, https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Events/2018/May/Azerbaijan-\nRRA-workshop/2--Mr-Jabir-Yusifov-SAARES--Overview-of-the-energy-sector-and-\nrenewa.pdf?la=en&hash=EF0FFCB2B8F1CB61B92F5528C5A22B54E1B0D16C.  \n\nThe  yearly  duration  of  sunlight  in  the  Absheron  peninsula  and  the  coastal  areas  of  \nthe  Caspian  Sea  is  approximately  2,500  hours  and,  in  Nakhichevan  Autonomous \nRepublic (AR), it is about 2,900 hours (Sevil 2011). The annual amount of solar energy \nfor each m2 in the country ranges between 1,300 kW/h to 1,750 kW/h (AREA 2017). The \nsolar energy potential of the country is estimated to be 115,200 MW/year. There are five \n2.8  MW\u2013capacity  solar  power  plants  (SPP)  established  in  the  Samukh,  Sumgait, \nPirallahy,  Surakhany,  and  Karadakh  regions.  A  sixth  plant  has  been  established  in \nNakhichevan with a 20 MW capacity (SAARES 2018). \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nFor wind energy, the Absheron Peninsula and Caspian Sea coastal zones receive heavy \nwinds for more than 270 days a year (Sevil 2011). Because the wind enters the territory \nof Azerbaijan from a narrow strip at the shoreline of the Caspian Sea and from the valley \nbetween the Great and  Small Caucasus Mountains, wind intensification is a recurring \nweather  phenomenon  in  the  surrounding  territories.  According  to  SAARES\u2019s  research \nstudy  (2017), \nthe  average  annual  wind  speed  ranges  between  7.0\u20138.5  m/s  \nat 80 m above the land surface there, which is categorized as highly favorable in IREA\u2019s \nenergy potential classification. In 2007, according to the decision of the Council of Tariff \nof Azerbaijan, a selling price of 4.5 Qapik1 for wind energy was determined to promote \nthe  operation  of  wind  energy  plants  (WPP),  particularly  at  Yeni  Yashma  (1.7  MW), \nShurabad (48 MW), Sitalchay (3.6 MW), Hokmali (8MW), Wind Island Offshore (200 MW) \nWind Farms, and Yeni Yashma Wind Power Station (50 MW; SAARES History 2018). \n\nThere  are  approximately  2.7  million  large-horned  animals,  9  million  small-horned \nanimals, and 30.5 million poultry birds in Azerbaijan (SSCRA Agriculture 2019), with a \ntotal annual discharge of 25 million tons (SAARES 2017). The country\u2019s annual volume \nof  solid  and  production  waste  is  more  than  2  million  tons.  Burnable  manufacturing \ncontaminants,  woods  and  carpentry  waste,  agrarian  organic  compounds,  household \nwaste,  and  oil  or  petroleum  product-based  wastes  are  the  most  widely  available \nbiosubstances  in  Azerbaijan.  Developments  in  several  industrial  sectors  as  well  as \nagriculture  and  social  services  increase  the  opportunities  for  bioenergy  generation \n(Huseynova 2014). In 2012, Balakhani Waste-to-Energy Plant was opened, with a total \ncapacity of 37 MW and a production capacity of 231.5 million kW/year using urban inert \nwaste with a 500,000 ton/year operation capacity.  \n\nThe geothermal energy potential of Azerbaijan is quite high.  Existing thermal sources \nare mainly in the Great and Small Caucasus, the Absheron Peninsula, Talish Mountains, \nKur-Araz  plain,  Nakhichevan,  and  on \nthe  Caspian  \nSea  (Table  2).  However,  the  extreme  expense  of  the  excavation  of  geothermal  \nwells is a serious obstacle for electricity generation from thermal waters. Azerbaijan has \nmany thermal water sources with relatively low temperatures (<80\u00b0C), and technologies \nusing low potential geothermal energy have only recently been developed (Mukhtarov et \nal. 2015).  \n\nthe  northwest  part  of \n\nTable 2: Thermal Waters of Azerbaijan \n\nWater Temperature, \n\u00b0C \n20\u201390 \n22\u201395 \n30\u201350 \n30\u201374 \n30\u201397 \n40\u201353 \n31\u201364 \n42\u201384 \n\n \n\nWater Flow Rate, \nm3/day \n20,000 \n172,466 \n2,000 \n4,171 \n21,654 \n3,000 \n14,405 \n7,908 \n245,604 \n\nEnergy Potential, \nMW \nup to 504 \nup to 47\u0387103 \nup to 168 \nup to 771 \nup to 609 \n126\u2013290 \n605\u2013778 \n399\u20131,129 \nUp to 51\u0387103 \n\nHydro-geological Areas \nAbsheron Peninsula \nKur depression \nGreat Caucasus \nSmall Caucasus \nGusar foothill lowlands \nNakhchivan \nTalysh \nLyankaran \nTotal \n\nSource: Mukhtarov et al.

The reason for the decreased shares of RES in \ntotal electricity production after 2011 was the establishment of new heat power stations \n(HPS)  using  fossil  fuels.  For  example,  the  Janub  HPS  was  opened  in  2013  with  a  \n780 MW capacity. Its capacity is more than half of the total capacity of existing HPs and \nSHPs (including in Nakhichevan AR; see Table 3), which is 1,174.4 MW. Total electricity \nproduction has increased due to these plants, so the share of electricity generated from \nRES in total electricity production accordingly decreased.  \n\nIn light of the existing outlook for RES in Azerbaijan, the strategic goal of the country for \nthe future is to increase the share of RES in total energy production, to diversify its energy \nportfolio, and, as a result of these actions, to supply the remaining natural gas to Europe. \nTable 8 shows the current status of RES and the Strategic Road Map goals in determined \ncapacities up to 2030. \n\nTable 8: Power Installation up to 2030 \n\nRES Type \nWind PP \nSolar PP \nHydro PP \nBioenergy PP \nTotal (MW) \nTotal (RES %) \n\n2018 \n311 MW \n35 MW \n\u2014 \n37 MW \n383 MW \n8.1% \n\n2020 \n350 MW \n50 MW \n10 MW \n20 MW \n430 MW \n20% \n\n2025 \n440 MW \n150 MW \n220 MW \n30 MW \n840 MW \n25%\u201330% \n\n2030 \n465 MW \n190 MW \n220 MW \n50 MW \n925 MW \n35%\u201340% \n\nSource:  IREA,  https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Events/2018/May/Azerbaijan-RRA-workshop/2--Mr-Jabir-\nYusifov-SAARES--Overview-of-the-energy-sector-and-renewa.pdf?la=en&hash=EF0FFCB2B8F1CB61B92F5528C5A22 \nB54E1B0D16C. \n\nConsidering  that  RES  is  relatively  new  and  unconventional  sector  in  Azerbaijan,  the \ncountry  has  nonetheless  made  significant  progress.  Importantly,  the  government  has \nclearly  expressed  a  political  will  for  the  development  of  RES.  There  are  still  some \nchallenges facing RES development in Azerbaijan. First are the legal challenges for both \nproduction  and  usage  of  RES.  Fundamental  laws  should  be  enacted  to  draw  legal \nframework.  Investments  in  RES  in  Azerbaijan  are  mainly  made  by  the  government  \nand  international  organizations,  and  a  draft  law  is  still  under  discussion.  Significant \ntechnical,  legal,  and  regulatory  infrastructure  is  far  from  satisfactory  for  the  business \nenvironment.  Existing  conditions  make  it  unfavorable  for  private  bodies  to  invest  and  \ndo not  guarantee effectiveness. Similarly, optimal regulations for the promotion of the \nRES sector\u2014such as production, transfer, distribution, and delivery of energy\u2014should \nbe established.  \n\nSecond  are  the  technical  challenges  primarily  related  to  technology  transfer.  RES \ntechnologies are expensive investments and, considering that Azerbaijan imports them \nfrom  other  countries,  technical  procedures  need  to  be  facilitated  and  simplified. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  electricity  has  long  been  dominated  by  oil  and  natural  gas.  The  country  \nis  experienced  in  such  methods,  so  these  are  well  developed  and  substantially  \nknown.  This  situation,  particularly  the  well-established  nature  of  oil  and  gas  related \ntechnologies, poses a serious disadvantage for RES. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\nA  lack  of  financial  resources  and  high  interest  rates  also  create  financial  challenges, \nwhich  are  the  third  important  obstacle.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  was  seriously  affected  \nby the fall in oil prices beginning from mid-2014. The effects of economic constriction \nwere strongly perceived in the RES sector, as almost all RES projects were completed \nbefore the oil crisis.  \n\nThe  fourth  challenge  is  low  awareness.  There  is  a  lack  of  support  from  international \norganizations  and  local  authorities  to  increase  public  awareness  about  RES  in \nAzerbaijan.  During  the  literature  search  for  the  current  paper,  it  appeared  that  most \nresearch  studies  and  projects  focusing  on  the  development  of  RES  and  awareness \nraising about RES in Azerbaijan were made between 2009 and 2015 both by national \nand  international  organizations.  Consequently,  the  achievement  of  a  relatively  stable \neconomic order following the unexpected oil price shock has created an environment for \nthe  revitalization  of  the  development  of  RES  in  Azerbaijan.  As  a  result  of  recent \ngovernment announcements about a restructuring legal basis to develop the use of RES \nin  the  country,  BP  and  ME  signed  \u201ca  Memorandum  of  Understanding\u201d  at  the  end  of \nDecember  2018  (Azernews  2019).  BP  has  played  a  significant  role  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nenergy  sector  for  a  long  time,  so  the  signed  memorandum  can  be  accepted  as  a \nprecursor to significant revivals of the country\u2019s RES policies and actions. SAARES is \nworking  on  23  projects  with  a  total  budget  of  13  million  Azerbaijani  manat  within  the \ncontext of the Strategic Road Map 2018\u20132020 to improve public services. The projects \nseek  to  construct  wind,  water,  and  biofuel  power  plants  at  a  420  MW  capacity.  WPP \ncapacity is 350 MW, SPP are designed for 50 MW, and biofuel power plants are planned \nat 20 MW. SAARES has also been negotiating with several foreign investors to provide \nfinancing for WPPs in the Caspian Sea that will increase the renewable energy supply \n(Azernews  2019).  The  country\u2019s  aim  is  to  develop  RES  by  attracting  private  sector \ninvestment and forming a legal framework that can stimulate the private sector. For this \npurpose,  negotiations  are  ongoing  with  companies,  international  organizations,  and \nfinancial institutions interested in investment in the RES sector in Azerbaijan to discuss \nsuggestions about the drafts law, as the  laws that will be accepted will determine the \nfuture development of RES in Azerbaijan. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION \n\nAzerbaijan  is  known  as  an  oil  country  and  one  of  the  traditional  world  hydrocarbon \nproducers. While some hydropower stations have been established, there was no state \npolicy for the development of RES until the 2000s. Environmental protection and natural \nresources issues have, however, attracted attention in recent years. Azerbaijan aims to \ngain economic growth in accordance with the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals and \nis looking to generate 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Although \nRES is a new policy area for Azerbaijan, significant progress has been made in the short \ntime since the first laws created an early legal framework for the development of RES in \nthe country at the end of the 1990s. The State Program on the use of alternative and \nRES  can  be  considered  a  new  step  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  energy  policy  towards  the  use  of \nRES.  The  establishment  of  SAARES  and  the  coordination  of  related  actions  under  a \ncentralized institution have shown positive effects in a short period of time. The share of \nRES in Azerbaijan\u2019s total electricity production has reached 8.1% as of 2018. \n\nAzerbaijan  applies  tax  incentives  to  support  the  use  of  RES.  Receiving  investment \npromotion  documents  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  established  by  the  relevant \nexecutive  authority,  legal  entities  and  individual  entrepreneurs  are  free  from  paying \nimport  customs  duties  and  VAT  for  technical  equipment  and  facilities  for  a  period  of \nseven years from the date of receipt of the mentioned document. They are also free from \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nU. Aydin \n\npaying taxes for 50% of their total income, 50% of their total profit, property tax, and land \ntax.  \n\nThe planned steps have increased the use of RES in Azerbaijan, as well as improving \nthe technology used in this field. The Azguntex Solar Panels Plant with a 50 MW annual \nproduction  capacity  and  the  Solar  Collector  Factory  were  established  in  Sumgait \nTechnology Park. Despite all these steps, the expensive investments in RES have mainly \nbeen made by the state, and the capacities of the country\u2019s RES and the share of total \nRES  electricity  production  is  lower  than  expected.  The  lack  of  development  of  the \nrenewable energy sector in Azerbaijan is similar to the rest of the world, and is mainly \ndue to low interest from the private sector in long-term investment. The main reason that \nthe private sector is not interested in entering the long-term financing of infrastructure \nprojects,  including  green  energy  projects,  is  the  low  rate  of  return  and  the  associated \nrisks (Yoshino, Taghizadeh-Hesary, and Nakahigashi 2019). \n\nIf  Azerbaijan  plans  to  achieve  the  UN\u2019s  sustainable  development  goals  and  the  Paris \nagreement  goals,  it  needs  to  scale  up  the  financing  of  investments  that  provide \nenvironmental  benefits  through  new  financial  instruments  and  new  policies,  such  as \ngreen  bonds,  green  banks,  carbon  market  instruments,  fiscal  policy,  green  central \nbanking, fintech, community-based green funds, and other measures collectively known \nas \u201cgreen finance\u201d (Sachs et al. 2019). \n\nGiven that the geographic conditions of Azerbaijan create favorable conditions for the \nprogress of the renewable energy sector, there is important RES potential in the country. \nThe fall of oil prices has limited the amount of state investment and operation in RES. \nThis  situation  has  shown  that  it  is  unsustainable  to  develop  the  RES  sector  only with \npublic capital and involvement. The sector must be developed with private investments, \nand  the  government  must  create  attractive  conditions  for  investors  under  competitive \nmarket opportunities. The recent technical potential of RES in Azerbaijan is estimated to \nbe approximately 130,000 MW/year. To achieve the goal of 20% RES use by 2020 and \nfuture  objectives  in  subsequent  periods,  the  legal,  financial,  and  technical  challenges \nmust be removed rapidly and awareness of the RES sector must be increased. This will \nbe helpful in reaching the full capacities of RES in Azerbaijan. There is no other realistic \nway to increase the rate of RES usage from 8.1% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 992 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nU.

As one of the \nhydrocarbon producers of the world, Azerbaijan is looking to generate 20% of its electricity \nfrom  renewable  sources  by  2020.  Aiming  to  minimize  its  energy  insecurity  problems  and \nensure the country\u2019s energy security, Azerbaijan has established its RES policies according \nto  the  norms  of  sustainable  development  while  simultaneously  securing  an  uninterrupted \nsupply  of  energy.  Using  oil  export  revenues  and  the  established  legal  infrastructure, \nAzerbaijan has made significant investments for development in the renewable energy sector \nsince  the  2000s.  Considering  that  there  is  a  short  time  to  2020  and  energy  security  is  a \nstrategic  part  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  national  security  aims,  this  paper  examines  how  close  the \ncountry  is  to  achieving  the  goal  of  obtaining  20%  of  its  electricity  using  RES  and  what \nchallenges prevent the realization of this target. Starting from a thermal power plant accident \nin July 2018, which revealed many of the deficiencies in Azerbaijan\u2019s energy strategies, this \npaper  considers  the  country\u2019s  energy  security  and  insecurity  issues  in  terms  of  the  legal \nframework, environmental policies, and actual achievements as shown in government data. \nThe study includes an assessment of the prospects for Azerbaijan\u2019s transition actions to RES, \nas well as potential solutions to remove the challenges that the country faces. \n \nKeywords: Azerbaijan, development, renewable energy, sustainability \n \nJEL Classification: O44, Q42, Q48, Q56 \n \n", " \n"]}
