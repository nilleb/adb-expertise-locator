As one of the \nhydrocarbon producers of the world, Azerbaijan is looking to generate 20% of its electricity \nfrom renewable sources by 2020. Aiming to minimize its energy insecurity problems and \nensure the country\u2019s energy security, Azerbaijan has established its RES policies according \nto the norms of sustainable development while simultaneously securing an uninterrupted \nsupply  of  energy.  Using  oil  export  revenues  and  the  established  legal  infrastructure, \nAzerbaijan has made significant investments for development in the renewable energy sector \nsince the 2000s. Considering that there is a short time to 2020 and energy security is a \nstrategic part of Azerbaijan\u2019s national security aims, this paper examines how close the \ncountry is to achieving the goal of obtaining 20% of its electricity using RES and what \nchallenges prevent the realization of this target.

INTRODUCTION \nAs a result of the accident at the Mingachevir Thermal Power Plant on 3 July 2018, \nelectricity was cut off in in most of Azerbaijan, including 39 regions of the country, the \ncapital Baku, and the major cities of Ganja and Sumgait. The electricity supply was \ndisrupted for the Baku subway, Azersu (which supplies water and sanitation services), \nthe  State  Oil  Company  of  Azerbaijan  Republic\u2019s  (SOCAR)  large-scale  production \nfacilities, industrial enterprises, health care centers, and other facilities with strategic \nimportance. Interruptions in power supply caused disruptions in the movement of trains \non the Baku metro and water distribution in the cities, as well as railway schedule delays \nthroughout  the  country.  Serious  problems  occurred  in  hospitals,  especially  in  the \ndepartments of surgery, intensive care, obstetrics, and premature birth units.  \nAzerenergy OJSC and the Ministry of Energy of Azerbaijan tried to explain the accident, \nciting a sharp increase in outdoor temperatures and a resulting 40% increase in energy \ndemand. These statements did not satisfy the public in light of the public programs \nimplemented to strengthen the country\u2019s energy security and the funds allocated for that \npurpose for many years. Official investigations revealed that the causes of the accident \nwere completely different and included high imbalance between the plant\u2019s infrastructure \nand workload; old equipment; false risk assessments; weak security measures; lack of \nrenewable energy source (RES) stations to compensate for power disruption during \nperiods of extreme heat, and the poor performance of the responsible organizations who \nfocused  mainly  on  initiatives  rather  than  acting  in  accordance  with  the  strategic \ndevelopment plan. \nThe accident revealed all aspects of energy insecurity in Azerbaijan, including technical \nshortcomings, poor electricity supply system diversification, and lack of risk elimination \nfor  the  country\u2019s  economy,  including  strategic  enterprises.  The  activities  of  the \norganizations responsible for the country\u2019s energy security were also not organized \nsystematically and the electricity production and supply systems were not properly \nintegrated. The state funds allocated for the development and strengthening of the \nelectricity supply system were spent inefficiently. One of the significant facts is about \nalternative energy policy, which has not been coordinated with energy security policy of \nthe country. \nHowever, Azerbaijan is an oil-producing country that is developing and implementing \npolicies in line with the rising trend in RES to achieve sustainable economic growth, \nensure  energy  security,  and  increase  the  share  of  non-oil  sectors  in  the  national \neconomy. Renewable energy is one of Azerbaijan\u2019s strategic priorities, because the \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  sector  in  Azerbaijan  are  not  only  in  line  with \nenvironmental goals for the reduction of carbon emissions to reach Paris Agreement \ntargets,  but  also  to  diversify  the  energy  basket  and  increasing  energy  security \n(Taghizadeh-Hesary et al. 2019). In other words, as an important part of its national \nsecurity  goals,  Azerbaijan  aims  to  use  renewable  energy  sources  alongside  fossil \nresources to guarantee energy security and minimize the risk of energy insecurity. It aims \nto solve the problems that may arise in the country\u2019s energy supply with renewable \nresources,  which  are  attractive  due  to  their  environment-friendly  features.  The \naforementioned accident, however, revealed that Azerbaijan must still face serious \nchallenges before achieving its goals. \nThis paper defines the prospects and challenges for Azerbaijan\u2019s use of RES to decrease \nits energy insecurity. Following consideration of the Mingachevir Thermal Power Plant \naccident in this first section, the second section of this study presents the research \nbackground, emphasizing the increasing importance of RES within the context of energy \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nsecurity and insecurity. The second section also builds a sustainable development \nequation and outlines a map of Azerbaijan\u2019s current energy security and insecurity. Third \nsection  presents  the  legal  framework  for  the  environment  and  energy  issues  in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s sustainable development agenda based on policy documents and sources. \nThe fourth section considers the present situation of RES transformation attempts using \nofficial statistical data. The achievements, potential, and deficiencies within Azerbaijan\u2019s \ncurrent legal framework in the RES sector are also analyzed. The conclusion includes \nthe research findings and suggestions for future study.  \n2.  BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH \nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) defines energy security as \u201cthe uninterrupted \navailability of energy sources at an affordable price\u201d (IEA 2014). Energy insecurity, \ntherefore, is a lack of the ability to provide or ensure the constant accessibility of energy \nsources at a fair price. The absence of energy security and the existence of energy \ninsecurity lead to negative economic and social effects for national economies. The \nemergence of the sustainable development concept has, however, emphasized the need \nto respect environmental concerns when making use of energy resources. \nRES is an option both to ensure energy security and for sustainable development. \nRenewable  energy  is  commonly  defined  as  energy  generated  from  solar,  wind, \ngeothermal, tide and wave, wood, waste, and biomass (Yazdi and Shakouri 2017). The \nenergy produced from RES plays an important role in decreasing energy insecurity, \ncontributing to energy security, and diversifying energy consumption. Used principally by \nthe electricity sector to decrease shortages and lack of access, a significant expansion \nin renewable energy has been encouraged by technological advances and the reduced \ncosts of transportation and communication (Yazdi and Shakouri 2017).  \nDespite  a  large  and  increasing  interest  in  renewable  energy,  it  still  faces  some \nchallenges. Examining renewable energy development in Malaysia, Mustapa, Peng, and \nHashim (2010) found the following four major challenges: financial barriers, technical \nbarriers, institutional/regulatory barriers, and information barriers. The cost of renewable \ninvestments\u2014exactly capital costs\u2014is higher due to new technologies, and there is \nuncertainty about renewable energy because of the novelty of the technologies used and \nthe nature of renewable energy itself (e.g., weather conditions). It is less expensive to \noperate RES, but the establishment such systems is costly. Financial institutions are \ntherefore reluctant to support the renewable energy sector because the start-up cost is \nperceived as a risk. Area conditions, infrastructure type, and means of transportation and \ncommunication pose technical obstacles for the development of renewable energy. An \ninsufficient legal framework, governmental institutions, and policies, as well as public-\nprivate partnerships to encourage renewable energy also prevent progress in the sector. \nMost services are still not aware of the full value of RES. Energy investors often think \nabout narrow value parameters and miss the big-picture, long-term opportunities that \nRES promise. Lack of information and awareness about the benefits of RES and poor \npublic opinion on renewable energy usage have had a negative effect on the sector\u2019s \ndevelopment. Increased awareness and willingness are needed. While these challenges \ndiffer from country to country, in developing countries, generally all of these challenges \nmust be faced simultaneously.  \nThe state is a key stakeholder in the field of energy security in Azerbaijan, and there are \nnumerous institutional mechanisms to manage and control the domestic energy market \nand oil and gas exports. The Ministry of Energy is the main executive body responsible \nfor implementing state policy and regulations in the energy sector and providing for the \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nenergy security of the country. It should be noted, however, that SOCAR is the prime \norganization representing the government in conducting international oil policy and has \nbeen directly involved in major oil and gas contracts as a shareholder. SOCAR plays a \ncentral role in Azerbaijan\u2019s strategic sector and the many international oil and gas \nexploration projects and extraction fields. The Ministry of Energy plays a more symbolic \nrole in the energy sector, while major energy projects are under SOCAR\u2019s control. \nAzerbaijan's  electricity  sector  is  controlled  by  Azenergy  OJSC,  an  independent  \nstate-owned company, and is a vertically integrated monopoly system. This institution \nmanages the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity, and is responsible \nfor domestic electricity supply to the country\u2019s electricity system. The main fuel used  \nfor domestic energy consumption is natural gas, both for the population as a whole  \nand for industry. The transportation system, meanwhile, uses oil products, so natural gas \nand oil are the basis of internal energy consumption, as well as the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity. \nUp to 2005, the main power plants were insufficient to produce the electricity needed in \nthe country. The lack of sufficient electricity, gas, and heat caused regional imbalances \nin the country, with the supply of electricity lasting only a few hours a day, along  \nwith frequent interruptions in supply and periodic malfunctions in the system. The low \nquality and intermittent power supply hindered industrial, agricultural, and commercial \nactivities, as well as economic growth and employment opportunities. \nThe State Program on the Development of the Fuel-Energy Complex (2005\u20132015) of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan and the Additional Measures to Improve the Electricity Supply in \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan were a turning point in reliable energy access, energy \nsecurity, and the creation of new energy sources for the country. In addition to the \nimplementation of the State Program, with the support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  within  the  framework  of  an  Improvement  of  Energy  Transmission  project, \nmeasures  were  taken  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  electricity  supply  and  restore  \nthe  electricity  network,  to  develop  alternative  and  renewable  energy  sources,  and  \nto  maximize  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation.  Recent  trends  towards \ndecreasing energy insecurity have included preventing energy losses in the domestic \nmarket,  increasing  energy  savings,  enhancing  customer  service,  and  providing  \nreliable energy. \nWhen oil prices were higher and there were, accordingly, higher fiscal revenues, the \ninfrastructure costs of the Azerenergy OJSC were also high. The state budget was one \nof the main financial sources of the organization. To subsidize the losses related to \nSOCAR\u2019s sale of natural gas to Azerenergy OJSC at a price lower than the contract \nvalue, 300 million manat was allocated from the state budget (Hasanov 2018). The \ndecline in oil prices has forced the government to accelerate reforms in the domestic \nelectricity sector. Achieving productivity in the domestic electricity market would increase \nAzerbaijan\u2019s potential to sell more energy to neighboring countries such as the Russian \nFederation, Iran, Turkey, and Georgia, which could compensate for losses related to \nfalling oil prices.  \nIt has not, however, been possible to achieve serious quality changes in the electricity \nsupply system, which is the key component of energy security in the country. Most  \nof the domestic energy infrastructure has deteriorated, which has caused frequent short \ncircuits,  energy  cuts,  and  energy  losses.  Out-of-date  technologies  and  electrical \nequipment have decreased the reliability and efficiency of energy system operation, \nwhile the lack of a reliable energy supply in the country is one of the main energy security \nconcerns for the government. Recent structural reforms have aimed to reduce this \ninternal energy security problem. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nThe general population and the commercial and public sectors are the main consumers \nof electricity in Azerbaijan. The change in tariffs for electricity and gas has always had a \nsignificant impact on consumers. Electricity tariffs were raised three times in 2007 for the \nfirst time since 1997, which has forced many consumers to use natural gas, which has \nled to electricity savings and exports (Aliyeva and Veliyev 2016). Fossil fuels therefore \nretain their importance for energy consumption in Azerbaijan. Ensuring the country\u2019s \nenergy security will, however, require using RES. Rovnag Abdullayev, president of \nSOCAR, noted \u201cthe diversification and security of energy supplies, the deepening of \nenergy market reforms, the development and modernization of energy infrastructures, \nenergy efficiency, energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources are key \nconcerns\u201d of Azerbaijan\u2019s energy security (SOCAR 2014). More has been improved and \naccomplished for the concerns related to fossil fuels, their export, and transportation \nwithin the country\u2019s energy security than for RES issues.  \nNew achievements have been made in the energy sector since 2003. Azerbaijan\u2019s \nelectricity system and power generation infrastructure have been reconstructed, trunk \nlines have been renewed within the country and in connection to other countries, and a \nnumber of large and small power stations have been built in cities and districts. Although \nthe national electricity system has been reinstalled to meet European Union (EU) \nstandards, to reduce the demand for domestic energy and to sell electrical energy to \nneighboring countries, the July 2018 accident showed that Azerbaijan still faces serious \nchallenges in terms of energy insecurity. That the country cannot reach the desired \nrenewable energy use, along with the failure to obtain power from RES in case of \nnecessity, has led to the question energy security and insecurity in Azerbaijan. The \naccident revealed the need to revise alternative energy policies from the context of \nenergy security and diversify access to electricity through several sources, including \nRES, for strategically important public organizations. \n3.  ENVIRONMENT \u2013 ENERGY ISSUES  \nIN AZERBAIJAN\u2019S SUSTAINABLE  \nDEVELOPMENT AGENDA \n3.1  Environmental Policy \nEnvironmental  issues  in  Azerbaijan  have  appeared  in  several  official  documents.  \nThe country\u2019s environmental policy has mainly focused on three aspects shaped by \nexisting environmental circumstances and socio-economic conditions. As the security of \nenvironment is of primary importance, policy first of all focuses on reducing the human \nimpact  on  the  environment  and  coordinating  environmental  protection  using  best \npractices for sustainable development. Considering the demands of present and future \ngenerations, the second focus of the policy is towards an effective use of natural \nresources, including RES. Evaluation of the country\u2019s needs for global environmental \nmatters, producing solutions for them, and acting on solutions through cooperation with \ninternational  organizations  is  the  third  aspect  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  environmental  policy  \n(Zo\u00ef Environment Network 2011).  \n   \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nSome obligations and principles are defined for the achievement of environmental policy \ngoals, including improving the environment through support of successful experiences \nof human resource management, as well as encouragement of the economic models \nand  technologies  needed  for  the  safety  of  present  and  future  generations  (Zo\u00ef \nEnvironment Network 2011). The Constitution of Azerbaijan has defined \u201cliving in a \nhealthy and clean environment as a right of the country\u2019s citizens\u201d (Zo\u00ef Environment \nNetwork 2011). This right forms a basis for environmental legislation. At the beginning of \nthe 1990s, the State Committee for the Environment developed the Ecological Concept \nof the Republic of Azerbaijan, specifying the foundation for Azerbaijan\u2019s state policy on \nenvironmental protection. As a part of Agenda 21 of the Rio de Janeiro Conference, \necological security norms have focused on environmental security and progression in \necological situation in Azerbaijan. To take precautions to improve the environment, \nspecial emphasis and general provisions have been defined including the \u201cprotection of \nthe biosphere, continuous utilization of natural resources, decrease and disposal of \nwaste, rational use of energy and reduction of risk associated with human activity\u201d \n(Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources [MENR] 2019).  \nTo  achieve  these  goals,  the  first  National  Environmental  Action  Plan  (NEAP)  of \nAzerbaijan was developed between 1995 and 1998 with World Bank assistance, in \nparallel with the first wave of NEAPs in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia \nafter the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Both the Law on Environmental Protection and \nthe Law on Environmental Safety were adopted in 1999. These two laws defined \u201cthe \nrights  and  responsibilities  of  government,  citizens,  public  associations  and  local \nauthorities;  use  of  natural  resources;  state  registry  of  natural  resources  of  the \nenvironment, monitoring, standardization and certification on environmental protection \nand  safety\u201d  (Zo\u00ef  Environment  Network  2011).  These  legal  documents  involve \n\u201ceconomical regulation of environmental protection and ecological terms required for \nimplementation of economic activities.\u201d The laws aim \u201cto promote education, research, \nstatistics and information on environment; environmental emergency response situations \nand  zones  of  ecological  disasters;  control  on  environmental  protection,  impact \nassessment;  inspection  and  audit;  responsibility  for  the  violation  of  environmental \nlegislation and international cooperation\u201d (Zo\u00ef Environment Network 2011). The Law on \nEnvironmental Protection concerns \u201call means (water, soil, air), waste management, \nprotection of fauna, protected areas and ecological expertise\u201d, stating \u201cthe order for the \nprotection of atmospheric air, water objects, and soils, organization of waste collection \nand disposal, animal world protection, operation of specially protected areas\u201d (Zo\u00ef \nEnvironment Network 2011).  \nFollowing the passage of these laws, strategic documents such as the 2003 and 2008 \nState Program on Poverty and Economic Development (SPPRED) and the 2003 State \nProgram for Environmentally Sustainable Economic Development (SPESEC) restated \nand added to Azerbaijan\u2019s environmental priorities (ADB 2005). During the country\u2019s \ntransition  period,  international,  regional,  and  intergovernmental  collaborations  were \ndeveloped, and Azerbaijan has joined twenty concerned conventions, like the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The State \nCommission on Climate Change was established in 1997 (ADB 2010: 11). In 2012 the \ngovernment of Azerbaijan accepted the development plan \u201cAzerbaijan 2020: Look into \nthe Future,\u201d through which it aimed to set higher development goals parallel to modern \nglobal challenges, including environmental concerns. Azerbaijan 2020 stresses the \nprobable effects of climate change on the country\u2019s society and economy, underlining \nthe need for preparation in policy measures. The plan argues that the quantity of energy \nconsumed and CO  released for the production of one unit of GDP must be analogous \n2\nwith the matching OECD member country norms by 2020.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nSince 1990 industrial activity in Azerbaijan has slowed, and the rate of greenhouse gas \nemissions  has  decreased  correspondingly.  Difficult  economic  conditions  have  also \nlimited the government\u2019s abilities to take measures in the same period. Thus, the \npollution rate accounted for 71.1 MTOE of CO  in the 1990s, which has calculated at \n2\nmore  than  an  average  of  50.0  MTOE  of  CO   in  the  2000s  (The  State  Statistical \n2\nCommittee of the Republic of Azerbaijan [SSCRA] 2017). Energy and total land use and \ncorresponding changes (both including and excluding forestry) are the main sectors in \nAzerbaijan  that  emit  greenhouse  gasses  into  the  atmosphere.  Depending  \non economic growth, especially with the start of the Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline, \nsignificant  increases  have  been  observed  in  the  amount  of  funding  allocated  for \nenvironmental protection by the government. However, economic constriction due to oil \nprices has once again reduced governmental expenditures for environmental issues. \n3.2  Energy Policy \nDue to its historic oil industry, which dates from the 1840s, rather than the quantity of its \noil reserves, Azerbaijan is well known as one of the world\u2019s energy producing countries. \nAs oil and natural gas exports are the main income source for the national budget, the \nenergy sector is a mirror of as well as a driving force for economic development in \nAzerbaijan (Flegel 2016). Azerbaijan\u2019s energy policy therefore mainly focuses on the \nproduction, export, and transportation strategies for fossil energy resources, as well as \nregulation  of  the  electricity  sector,  management  of  energy  revenues,  and  energy \nsustainability, including environmental issues and RES. The four laws on the Utilization \nof Energy Resources, Energy, Electric Energy, and Electric and Heat Power Plants, \nrespectively, created the early legal framework for the country\u2019s energy development and \nRES. The law on the Utilization of Energy Resources, No. 94-IQ, dated 30 May 1996, \ndefined the legal, economic, and social framework of governmental policy on the use of \nenergy resources, as well as the main directions for the law\u2019s implementation, and \nregulation relations between the state and legal and physical persons (The Ministry of \nEnergy of Azerbaijan Republic [ME] 2018). The state\u2019s energy policy is clearly defined in \narticle 3 of the law on Energy of Azerbaijan, No. 541, dated 24 November 1998, which \nruns as follows:  \n1.  Effective  production,  transportation,  distribution,  storage,  use  and  safety  of \nenergy products.  \n2.  Creation of infrastructure that will provide efficient energy supply to all consumers \nand  to  create  new  workplaces;  establishment  of  competition  and  minimal \nmonopoly conditions in energy sector; organization of activities in the energy \nsector on the basis of various types of ownership, long-term contracts and special \npermits; creation of favorable conditions for local businesses producing high \nquality products; creation of favorable conditions for the application of efficient \nand environmentally safe technologies. \n3.  Conservation of energy resources, reduction of waste amounts, efficient use of \nenergy and use of RES. \n4.  Reduction of negative impact on the environment. \n5.  In case of energy shortage, to provide subsidies to producers and consumers to \nincrease energy efficiency. \n6.  To create favorable legal and economic conditions for investments. \n7.  Development of state energy programs (ME 2018). \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nThe law on Electric Energy, No. 459-IQ, dated 3 April 1998, sets out the legal basis  \nfor the production, transportation, distribution, purchase, and sale of electricity and  \nheat energy. The main purpose of this law is to use energy resources efficiently by \nincluding environmental care in the energy market in a socially sound manner, in the \ninterest of energy production and consumption (ME 2018). The law on Electric Power \nand Heat Stations, No. 784-IQ, dated 28 December 1999, determines the legal basis for \nthe design, construction, and operation of permanent facilities producing electric and \nthermal energy in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan (ME \n2018). \nThese laws are the country\u2019s initial energy legislation, which were enacted in the first \nyears of independence and involve the fundamental urgent issues of that period based \non the primary energy resource\u2014fossil fuels. None of these legal documents explicitly \nincludes renewable energy. Thus, the 1990s can be considered the first stage of  \nthe formation of Azerbaijan\u2019s energy policy, focusing mainly on environmental and \necological concerns rather than renewability. This situation can be accepted as usual for \na country going through a transition period and focusing on the recovery of its economy; \nunder the existing conditions of that period, sustainability could only be considered at a \nfuture stage.  \nThe State Program on the Use of Alternative and RES in the Republic of Azerbaijan was \napproved by Presidential Order No. 462, dated 21 October 2004, and was a new pillar \nfor Azerbaijan\u2019s energy policy. The objective of the State Program was to promote power \ngeneration  from  renewable  and  environmentally  sound  sources  and  to  utilize \nhydrocarbon energy sources more efficiently. The major tasks of the State Program \nincluded defining \u201cpotential of alternative (renewable) energy sources for electric power \ngeneration\u201d  and  raising  \u201cefficiency  of  utilization  of  country\u2019s  energy  sources  by \ndeveloping RES\u201d and \u201cto ensure the opening of additional jobs with creation of new \nenergy production sites; and given the existing total capacity of traditional energy \nsources in Azerbaijan, to increase the energy capacities at the expense of RES and \ntherefore, achieve the country\u2019s energy security\u201d (State Agency for Alternative and \nRenewable Sources (SAARES) 2019). \nSome of the goals of the Memorandum of Understanding of 2006 signed between  \nthe EU and Azerbaijan overlap with the objectives of the State Program, including \n\u201cmodernization of the electric grid, enhance the security and reliability of the energy \ninfrastructure; preparation of programs and regulations for the development of renewable \nenergy sector and achievement the efficient use of energy.\u201d Within the framework of \nState Program, SAARES was established under the auspices of the Ministry of Industry \nand Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2009. In December 2011 a second long-\nterm government strategy for the development of alternative and RES for the years \n2012\u20132020 was accepted in line with the EU\u2019s 2006 climate and energy policy for \nworldwide 20/20/20 targets (Caspian Information Centre 2013). While energy efficiency, \nrenewable energy, security of supply, ecologic security, and cost effectiveness were the \nmain concepts of the strategy, stabilizing the final energy consumption was the key \nfunction of the strategy\u2019s structure. The Strategy aims to reduce 20% greenhouse gas \nemission from 1990 levels, to scale up the rate of renewable energy by up to 20% in \nusing electricity as well as to increase energy efficiency by 20% by 2020 (Caspian \nInformation Centre 2013: 4). To improve management in this sector, SAARES and the \nagency\u2019s AzAlternativEnerji LLC were established in 2013.

Aydin \n \nFor wind energy, the Absheron Peninsula and Caspian Sea coastal zones receive heavy \nwinds for more than 270 days a year (Sevil 2011). Because the wind enters the territory \nof Azerbaijan from a narrow strip at the shoreline of the Caspian Sea and from the valley \nbetween the Great and Small Caucasus Mountains, wind intensification is a recurring \nweather phenomenon in the surrounding territories. According to SAARES\u2019s research \nstudy  (2017),  the  average  annual  wind  speed  ranges  between  7.0\u20138.5  m/s  \nat 80 m above the land surface there, which is categorized as highly favorable in IREA\u2019s \nenergy potential classification. In 2007, according to the decision of the Council of Tariff \nof Azerbaijan, a selling price of 4.5 Qapik1 for wind energy was determined to promote \nthe operation of wind energy plants (WPP), particularly at Yeni Yashma (1.7 MW), \nShurabad (48 MW), Sitalchay (3.6 MW), Hokmali (8MW), Wind Island Offshore (200 MW) \nWind Farms, and Yeni Yashma Wind Power Station (50 MW; SAARES History 2018). \nThere  are  approximately  2.7  million  large-horned  animals,  9  million  small-horned \nanimals, and 30.5 million poultry birds in Azerbaijan (SSCRA Agriculture 2019), with a \ntotal annual discharge of 25 million tons (SAARES 2017). The country\u2019s annual volume \nof solid and production waste is more than 2 million tons. Burnable manufacturing \ncontaminants, woods and carpentry waste, agrarian organic compounds, household \nwaste,  and  oil  or  petroleum  product-based  wastes  are  the  most  widely  available \nbiosubstances in Azerbaijan.

The reason for the decreased shares of RES in \ntotal electricity production after 2011 was the establishment of new heat power stations \n(HPS) using fossil fuels. For example, the Janub HPS was opened in 2013 with a  \n780 MW capacity. Its capacity is more than half of the total capacity of existing HPs and \nSHPs (including in Nakhichevan AR; see Table 3), which is 1,174.4 MW. Total electricity \nproduction has increased due to these plants, so the share of electricity generated from \nRES in total electricity production accordingly decreased.  \nIn light of the existing outlook for RES in Azerbaijan, the strategic goal of the country for \nthe future is to increase the share of RES in total energy production, to diversify its energy \nportfolio, and, as a result of these actions, to supply the remaining natural gas to Europe. \nTable 8 shows the current status of RES and the Strategic Road Map goals in determined \ncapacities up to 2030. \nTable 8: Power Installation up to 2030 \nRES Type  2018  2020  2025  2030 \nWind PP  311 MW  350 MW  440 MW  465 MW \nSolar PP  35 MW  50 MW  150 MW  190 MW \nHydro PP  \u2014  10 MW  220 MW  220 MW \nBioenergy PP  37 MW  20 MW  30 MW  50 MW \nTotal (MW)  383 MW  430 MW  840 MW  925 MW \nTotal (RES %)  8.1%  20%  25%\u201330%  35%\u201340% \nSource:  IREA,  https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Events/2018/May/Azerbaijan-RRA-workshop/2--Mr-Jabir-\nYusifov-SAARES--Overview-of-the-energy-sector-and-renewa.pdf?la=en&hash=EF0FFCB2B8F1CB61B92F5528C5A22 \nB54E1B0D16C. \nConsidering that RES is relatively new and unconventional sector in Azerbaijan, the \ncountry has nonetheless made significant progress. Importantly, the government has \nclearly expressed a political will for the development of RES. There are still some \nchallenges facing RES development in Azerbaijan. First are the legal challenges for both \nproduction and usage of RES. Fundamental laws should be enacted to draw legal \nframework. Investments in RES in Azerbaijan are mainly made by the government  \nand international organizations, and a draft law is still under discussion. Significant \ntechnical, legal, and regulatory infrastructure is far from satisfactory for the business \nenvironment. Existing conditions make it unfavorable for private bodies to invest and  \ndo not guarantee effectiveness. Similarly, optimal regulations for the promotion of the \nRES sector\u2014such as production, transfer, distribution, and delivery of energy\u2014should \nbe established.  \nSecond  are  the  technical  challenges  primarily  related to technology transfer.  RES \ntechnologies are expensive investments and, considering that Azerbaijan imports them \nfrom  other  countries,  technical  procedures  need  to  be  facilitated  and  simplified. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s electricity has long been dominated by oil and natural gas. The country  \nis  experienced  in  such  methods,  so  these  are  well  developed  and  substantially  \nknown. This situation, particularly the well-established nature of oil and gas related \ntechnologies, poses a serious disadvantage for RES. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nA lack of financial resources and high interest rates also create financial challenges, \nwhich are the third important obstacle. Azerbaijan\u2019s economy was seriously affected  \nby the fall in oil prices beginning from mid-2014. The effects of economic constriction \nwere strongly perceived in the RES sector, as almost all RES projects were completed \nbefore the oil crisis.  \nThe fourth challenge is low awareness. There is a lack of support from international \norganizations  and  local  authorities  to  increase  public  awareness  about  RES  in \nAzerbaijan. During the literature search for the current paper, it appeared that most \nresearch studies and projects focusing on the development of RES and awareness \nraising about RES in Azerbaijan were made between 2009 and 2015 both by national \nand international organizations. Consequently, the achievement of a relatively stable \neconomic order following the unexpected oil price shock has created an environment for \nthe  revitalization  of  the  development  of  RES  in  Azerbaijan.  As  a  result  of  recent \ngovernment announcements about a restructuring legal basis to develop the use of RES \nin the country, BP and ME signed \u201ca Memorandum of Understanding\u201d at the end of \nDecember 2018 (Azernews 2019). BP has played a significant role in Azerbaijan\u2019s \nenergy sector for a long time, so the signed memorandum can be accepted as a \nprecursor to significant revivals of the country\u2019s RES policies and actions. SAARES is \nworking on 23 projects with a total budget of 13 million Azerbaijani manat within the \ncontext of the Strategic Road Map 2018\u20132020 to improve public services. The projects \nseek to construct wind, water, and biofuel power plants at a 420 MW capacity. WPP \ncapacity is 350 MW, SPP are designed for 50 MW, and biofuel power plants are planned \nat 20 MW. SAARES has also been negotiating with several foreign investors to provide \nfinancing for WPPs in the Caspian Sea that will increase the renewable energy supply \n(Azernews 2019). The country\u2019s aim is to develop RES by attracting private sector \ninvestment and forming a legal framework that can stimulate the private sector. For this \npurpose, negotiations are ongoing with companies, international organizations, and \nfinancial institutions interested in investment in the RES sector in Azerbaijan to discuss \nsuggestions about the drafts law, as the laws that will be accepted will determine the \nfuture development of RES in Azerbaijan. \n5.  CONCLUSION \nAzerbaijan is known as an oil country and one of the traditional world hydrocarbon \nproducers. While some hydropower stations have been established, there was no state \npolicy for the development of RES until the 2000s. Environmental protection and natural \nresources issues have, however, attracted attention in recent years. Azerbaijan aims to \ngain economic growth in accordance with the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals and \nis looking to generate 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Although \nRES is a new policy area for Azerbaijan, significant progress has been made in the short \ntime since the first laws created an early legal framework for the development of RES in \nthe country at the end of the 1990s. The State Program on the use of alternative and \nRES can be considered a new step in Azerbaijan\u2019s energy policy towards the use of \nRES. The establishment of SAARES and the coordination of related actions under a \ncentralized institution have shown positive effects in a short period of time. The share of \nRES in Azerbaijan\u2019s total electricity production has reached 8.1% as of 2018. \nAzerbaijan applies tax incentives to support the use of RES. Receiving investment \npromotion documents in accordance with the procedure established by the relevant \nexecutive authority, legal entities and individual entrepreneurs are free from paying \nimport customs duties and VAT for technical equipment and facilities for a period of \nseven years from the date of receipt of the mentioned document. They are also free from \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \npaying taxes for 50% of their total income, 50% of their total profit, property tax, and land \ntax.  \nThe planned steps have increased the use of RES in Azerbaijan, as well as improving \nthe technology used in this field. The Azguntex Solar Panels Plant with a 50 MW annual \nproduction  capacity  and  the  Solar  Collector  Factory  were  established  in  Sumgait \nTechnology Park. Despite all these steps, the expensive investments in RES have mainly \nbeen made by the state, and the capacities of the country\u2019s RES and the share of total \nRES electricity production is lower than expected. The lack of development of the \nrenewable energy sector in Azerbaijan is similar to the rest of the world, and is mainly \ndue to low interest from the private sector in long-term investment. The main reason that \nthe private sector is not interested in entering the long-term financing of infrastructure \nprojects, including green energy projects, is the low rate of return and the associated \nrisks (Yoshino, Taghizadeh-Hesary, and Nakahigashi 2019). \nIf Azerbaijan plans to achieve the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals and the Paris \nagreement  goals,  it  needs  to  scale  up  the  financing  of  investments  that  provide \nenvironmental benefits through new financial instruments and new policies, such as \ngreen bonds, green banks, carbon market instruments, fiscal policy, green central \nbanking, fintech, community-based green funds, and other measures collectively known \nas \u201cgreen finance\u201d (Sachs et al. 2019). \nGiven that the geographic conditions of Azerbaijan create favorable conditions for the \nprogress of the renewable energy sector, there is important RES potential in the country. \nThe fall of oil prices has limited the amount of state investment and operation in RES. \nThis situation has shown that it is unsustainable to develop the RES sector only with \npublic capital and involvement. The sector must be developed with private investments, \nand the government must create attractive conditions for investors under competitive \nmarket opportunities. The recent technical potential of RES in Azerbaijan is estimated to \nbe approximately 130,000 MW/year. To achieve the goal of 20% RES use by 2020 and \nfuture objectives in subsequent periods, the legal, financial, and technical challenges \nmust be removed rapidly and awareness of the RES sector must be increased. This will \nbe helpful in reaching the full capacities of RES in Azerbaijan. There is no other realistic \nway to increase the rate of RES usage from 8.1% in 2018 to 20% in 2020. \n   \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 992  U. Aydin \n \nREFERENCES \nAliyeva, L., and C.

Aiming to minimize its energy insecurity problems and ensure the country\u2019s energy security, Azerbaijan has established its RES policies according to the norms of sustainable development while simultaneously securing an uninterrupted supply of energy. Using oil export revenues and the established legal infrastructure, Azerbaijan has made significant investments for development in the renewable energy sector since the 2000s. Considering that there is a short time to 2020 and energy security is a strategic part of Azerbaijan\u2019s national security aims, we examine how close the country is to achieving the goal of obtaining 20% of its electricity using RES and what challenges prevent the realization of this target. Starting from a thermal power plant accident in July 2018, which revealed many of the deficiencies in Azerbaijan\u2019s energy strategies, we consider the country\u2019s energy security and insecurity issues in terms of the legal framework, environmental policies, and actual achievements as shown in government data. We also assess the prospects for Azerbaijan\u2019s transition actions to RES, as well as potential solutions to remove the challenges that the country faces.", "Title": "Energy Insecurity and Renewable Energy Sources: Prospects and Challenges for Azerbaijan"}}
