But under the postwar dollar standard, the central \nposition of the US was key to maintaining the peace, until the Bretton Woods system of fixed \ndollar  exchange  parities  fell  apart  after  the  so-called  \u201cNixon  Shock\u201d  of  1971.  Now,  without \nmuch fear of retaliation, the US can initiate more limited currency warfare\u2014as with American \n\u201cJapan bashing\u201d from the late 1970s to mid-1990s to appreciate the yen, or \u201cChina bashing\u201d \nsince  2002  to  appreciate  the  renminbi.    Japan  succumbed  to  this  bashing,  and  the  yen \nappreciated too much in 1985, with the result that Japan fell into a zero-interest liquidity trap \nand  economic  stagnation  for  almost  two  decades.  However,  in  2013,  through  massive \nquantitative easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the yen depreciated about 25% against the \ndollar,  stoking  fears  of  a  return  to  Japan  bashing  by  the  US.  However,  this  sharp \ndepreciation  simply  restored  the  purchasing  power  parity  of  the  yen  with  the  dollar  so  it \nshould  even  out  in  the  long  run.  In  the  short  run,  we  show  that  yen  depreciation  could \nadversely  affect  the smaller  East  Asian  economies.  Since  2008, quantitative  easing  by  the \nBOJ has been similar to that carried out by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, \nand the European Central Bank. So the BOJ can only be faulted as a currency belligerent if \nthere  is  a  further  significant  yen  depreciation.  Led  by  the  US,  now  all  mature  industrial \ncountries are addicted to near-zero interest liquidity traps in both the short and long terms. \nThese ultra low interest rates are causing lasting damage to the countries\u2019 financial systems, \nand  to  those  of  emerging  markets,  which  naturally  have  higher  interest  rates.  But  exiting \nfrom the trap creates a risk of chaos in long-term bond markets and is proving surprisingly \ndifficult.1\n\n   \n\n \nJEL Classification: F31, F32 \n \n\n                                                \n1 The authors want to thank Rishi Goyal for his valuable comments and suggestions. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n       \n\n      McKinnon and Liu \n\nGold Standard and the Great Depression .................................................................. 3 \n\nPostwar Dollar Standard ............................................................................................ 3 \n\nThe Fed: Opening Salvos in the Modern \u201cCurrency War\u201d........................................... 4 \n\nJapan as Victim ....................................................................................................... 10 \n\nJapan as Predator? ................................................................................................. 16 \n\nConclusion and Further Discussion on Quantitative Easing ..................................... 21 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 23 \n\nContents \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\n1.  GOLD STANDARD AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION \n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, currency wars\u2014although very destructive\u2014were at least easy \nto identify. Their hallmark was a large devaluation of one nation\u2019s currency against gold \nwhile its trading partners remained tied to the yellow metal.  \n\nAfter World War I and much debate, in 1925 the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, \nWinston Churchill, tried to restore an international standard by pegging the price of gold \nat  \u00a34.86  per  ounce\u2014its  pre-1914  parity.  Many  other  nations  followed  suit.  But  in  late \n1926,  France,  which  had  inflated  and  depreciated  its  currency  far  below  its  pre-war \nparity,  finally  managed  to  stabilize  its  currency  by  sharply  raising  interest  rates,  the \nfamous  Poincar\u00e9  Stabilization.  This  undervalued  the  franc  against  the  pound,  and, \ntogether  with  the  higher  interest  rates  in  France,  began  to  drain  gold  from  Britain. \nDespite  its  depressed  economy  and  high  unemployment  in  the  1920s, Britain kept  its \nown interest rates high to protect its slender gold reserves.  \n\nThis  gold  drain  then  caused  a  banking  panic  in  Germany,  forcing  it  to  \u201caccidentally\u201d \ndevalue  in  1931.  The  British  more  deliberately  abandoned  the  gold  standard  in \nSeptember 1931 with a deep devaluation, and Japan followed in December 1931.  The \nUS  had  not  changed  its  pre-war  gold  parity  of  $20  per  ounce,  but  as  a  safe  haven  it \nhad  still  accumulated  much  of  the  world\u2019s  gold.    In  1933  and  after  considerable \ntinkering,  President  Roosevelt  devalued  the  dollar  by  raising  the  official  price  of  an \nounce  of gold from  $20 to  $35  despite the fact that  the  US  had  a trade surplus. This \nseries of \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbor\u201d devaluations then came full circle back to France, and \nin 1936 it was forced to devalue along with some smaller European countries that were \ntied to it.  \n\nIn each case, the threat of a run on the country\u2019s gold stock (hot money flows) before it \nthey  devalued  induced  governments  to  cut  expenditures  (impose  austerity)  and  raise \ninterest  rates.  The  US  actually  raised  interest  rates  in  1931  even  as  the  Great \nDepression  was  unfolding  worldwide.  So  the  collective  retrenchment  in  the  major \ncountries  deepened  the  worldwide  depression,  which  could  be  fairly  characterized  as \nan implosion of the international gold standard.  \n\n2.  POSTWAR DOLLAR STANDARD \n\nAfter  World  War  II,  gold  was  dethroned  in  favor  of  the  dollar,  but  this  was  more  by \naccident  than  design.  In  1945,  the  major  industrial  countries  other  than  the  US  were \ndamaged  by  the  war,  had  open  or  repressed  inflation,  and  controls  on  foreign \nexchange transactions. Because only the U.S had an open and stable financial system, \nforeign  banks  and  corporations  naturally  began  using  the  dollar  as  the  key  vehicle \ncurrency for clearing international payments and for invoicing international trade flows. \nForeign governments starting holding their reserves in dollars, which had become the \nofficial  intervention  currency  even  before  the  1945  Bretton Woods  agreement  obliged \nthem to declare official dollar exchange parities. But with foreign countries all specifying \ndollar  exchange  rate  parities,  this  left\u2014and  still  leaves\u2014the  center  country  without  a \ndirect exchange rate policy of its own.  \nAmazingly  this  dollar-based  system  has  persisted  from  1945  to  the  present  day.2\n  In \n2013,  when  the  PRC trades  with  Brazil,  both  countries  invoice  their  exports  in  dollars \nand clear interbank payments using the dollar as the intermediary currency.  The dollar \n                                                \n2 The dollar\u2019s traumatic history in this central role is analyzed in McKinnon 2013.  \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nis now the standard reference currency for determining a currency\u2019s international value.  \nBut  the  dollar  standard  is  now  under  siege  from  major  industrial  countries  trying  to \nforce down their interest rates. \n\nIn  slack  economic  times,  the  modern  version  of  a  \"currency  war\"  takes  the  form  of a \ncountry putting downward pressure on its dollar exchange rate\u2014either directly through \nofficial  foreign  exchange  intervention  or,  more  commonly,  indirectly  by  through \ndomestic  monetary  policies.  Most  advanced  economies  today,  such  as  the  US,  have \nfloating  exchange  rates.   But  their  monetary  policies  include  near-zero  short-term \ninterest  rates  and  quantitative  easing  (QE)  as  central  banks  have  purchased  longer-\nterm Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities. By inducing capital outflows from \nthe  US,  both  methods  have  put  untoward,  if  inadvertent,  downward  pressure  on  the \ndollar in the foreign exchanges. \n\n3.  THE FED: OPENING SALVOS IN THE MODERN \n\n\u201cCURRENCY WAR\u201d \n\nSince  2000,  the  US  Federal  Reserve  (the  Fed)  has  twice  sharply  reduced  short-term \ninterbank  interest  rates (Figure  1).  After the  collapse  of the  high-tech  bubble  in  2001, \nthe Fed cut its overnight funds rate to just 1% in late 2002\u2014and then held it down for \nalmost 2 years so as to create bubbles in the property, commodity, and stock markets \n(Taylor 2009). The other episode came with the collapse in these bubbles creating the \nUS  subprime  mortgage  crisis  in  2008.  In  response  to  the  ensuing  recession,  the  Fed \nthen  cut  the  US  interbank  rate  to  virtually  zero  in  December  2008\u2014where  it  remains \ntoday. With  short-term  interest rates  at  zero  since  2009, the  Fed  has  initiated  various \nrounds  of  quantitative  easing  by  buying  long-term  Treasury  bonds,  asset-backed \nmortgage  securities,  and  other  long-term  instruments  so  as to reduce  long-term  rates \nas  well.  We  are  currently  in  the  third  round  of  massive  QE  with  the  Fed  buying  $85 \nbillion of longer-term US securities per month. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 1: Money Market Interest Rate(MMR) and Long Term Bond Yield (LTBY), \n\nUS and Japan (%) \n\nSource: EIU data; calculations by authors. \n\nWhy are near zero interest rates a potential beggar-thy-neighbor exchange rate policy? \nUltra-low  interest  rates  in  the  US  periodically  unleash  floods  of  hot  money  into \nemerging markets with higher growth and naturally higher interest rates. Any emerging \nmarket central bank is then faced with an uncomfortable choice: either let its exchange \nrate  appreciate  against  the  dollar  and  thus  lose  export  competiveness  against  its \nneighbors,  or  intervene  heavily  to  buy  dollars  to  smooth  exchange  fluctuations  and \nthereby lose monetary control. Since 2002, emerging markets have acquired more than \n$6 trillion in foreign exchange reserves (Figure 2) and their consumer price index (CPI) \ninflation has been more than 4 percentage points higher than in the US despite, on net \nbalance,  having  appreciated  in  nominal  terms  against  the  dollar  (Figure  3). 3\n  \n\n                                                \n3 McKinnon 2013, Chapter 5. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 2: Foreign Exchange Reserves of Selected Economies (US$ Billion) \n\nSource: IFS. \nEmerging Markets (EM) include the following economies Russia; Poland; Czech Republic; Hungary; \nRomania; Ukraine; Turkey; Israel; UAE;  Saudi Arabia; South Africa; PRC; India; Hong Kong, China; \nRepublic  of    Korea;    Singapore;  Indonesia;  Malaysia;  Thailand;  Brazil;  Mexico;  Chile;  Peru; \nColombia;  Argentina;  and  Venezuela.

Figure 2 shows the buildup of \nemerging market foreign exchange reserves stopped with the subprime mortgage crisis \nin the US in 2008\u2013into 2009. . It then began again in mid-2009 when that crisis seemed \nto  be  contained  and  the  large  interest  differential  in  favor  of  emerging  markets \nremained.  However,  from  mid-2011  onward,  the  rapid  buildup  stopped  again  with  the \nunresolved  eurozone  banking  crisis.  Banking  crises  in  the  US  and  Europe  are \nintertwined as their banks borrow or lend to each other. Because these \u201cinternational\u201d \nbanks provide much of the funding for the carry trades behind the hot money flows, an \ninternational crisis forces them to retrench and the flows to reverse.   \n\nIn  mid-2013,  the  most  recent  crisis  has  been  associated  with  Federal  Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke musing at a press conference on 19 June that the Fed might \n\u201ctaper off\u201d its program of buying huge amounts of US Treasury bonds and other long-\nterm instruments. He carefully hedged his position by saying that certain pre-conditions \nhad to be met\u2014notably a fall in the unemployment rate to 6.5%\u2014 before tapering could \nbegin.  But  the  markets  ignored  all  his  careful  caveats.  Long-term  interest  rates  rose, \nfrom  1.5%  to  2.5%  in  the  US,  and  stock  markets  crashed  around  the  world\u2014\nparticularly  in  emerging  markets\u2014as  hot  money  flowed  back  to  the  center  country \nleading to a strengthening of the dollar in the foreign exchanges. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nThe other industrial economies collectively are also affected by the Fed\u2019s policies. After \n2008  in  response  to  the  unprecedented  financial  crisis  and  the  Fed\u2019s  leadership,  the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England also reduced their short-term \ninterest  rates  toward  zero  (Figure  6).  Short-term  rates  in  Japan  were  already  at  zero \n(Figure 1). All four central banks have also engaged in massive quantitative easing\u2014\nexpanding their balance sheets\u2014that, since 2008, look similar (Figure 5).   \n\nFigure 5: Size of Central Bank Balance Sheet (% of GDP) \n\nSource: Bloomberg, OECD Stat. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 6: GDP Weighted Discount Rate of BRICS and G3 \n\nSource: IMF, EIU data; calculations by authors. \n\nIn  both  emerging  markets  and  the  industrial  countries,  the  result  has  been  financial \nrepression. To the disadvantage of savers in the industrial world, bank deposit interest \nrates  are  now  less  than  domestic  rates  of  inflation.  With  interest  rates  in  industrial \ncountries  at  rock  bottom,  the  interest  rate  differential  between  advanced  economies \nand  healthy  developing  economies  potentially  induces  rounds  of  emerging  market \ncurrency appreciation. \n\nOf course, each mature industrial country claims that it is only responding to domestic \ndeflationary  pressure  and  that  it  is  not  trying  to  devalue  or  conduct  a  beggar-thy-\nneighbor  policy  of  direct  devaluation.  However,  even  if  they  are  not  deliberate,  these \nactions  constitute  currency  warfare  by  stealth  because  central  banks  in  the  mature \nindustrial  economies  essentially  ignore  the  impact  of  their  monetary  policies  on \nneighboring  countries\u2014particularly  emerging  markets.  Overall,  the  persistent  huge \ninterest  differential  between  industrial  countries  with  near  zero  short  rates  and \nemerging  markets  with  naturally  higher  rates  (Figure  6)  is  an  ongoing  source  of  hot \nmoney flows and financial turmoil in the international economy. \n\n4.  JAPAN AS VICTIM  \n\nIn the postwar period after the Bretton Woods system of fixed dollar exchange parities \nfell apart (the so-called \u201cNixon Shock\u201d of 1971), Japan was an early victim of currency \nwarfare. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, Japan\u2019s relatively high rate of savings \nled to current account surpluses that were particularly obvious when compared with the \nbilateral trade deficits of the savings-deficient US (see the left-hand panel of Figure 7) \nJapan was accused of deliberately undervaluing the yen against the dollar to increase \nits exports. The result was American \u201cJapan bashing,\u201d with threats of tariffs and quotas \non imports of goods from Japan, unless the yen appreciated.   \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 7:  Bilateral Trade Balances of Japan and PRC versus the US \n\n(percentage of US GDP, 1985-2012) \n\nSource: Census Bureau, IMF. \n\nThis resulted  in the famous  Plaza  Accord  in  1985:  a  negotiated sharp appreciation  of \nthe  yen,  after  which  the  yen  continued  to  appreciate  until  April  1995.  The  political \naccusation that Japan had undervalued the yen is questionable. According to the Penn \nWorld  Tables  (Heston  et  al  2012),  the  yen  was  overvalued  compared  with  its \npurchasing  power  parity  (PPP)  from  1985  through  2012  (Figure  8).  Although  PPP  is \nonly one factor affecting the exchange rate, the yen\u2019s level well above its PPP was an \nimportant factor in Japan\u2019s continued stagnation through 2012.  \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 8:  Japan Exchange Rate (Yen/Dollar) and Purchasing Power Parity, \nprojected into 2013 \n\nSource: Penn World Table 7.1, FRED. \nPPP Projected by linear model: Japan PPP percentage change = 0.095-1.023*(US CPI  change-Japan \nCPI change) \n\nThis  syndrome  of  an  ever  higher  yen,  from  360  yen  to  the  dollar  in  August  1971  to \ntouch  just  80  in  April  1995,  was  disastrous  for  the  Japanese  economy.  Initially,  the \nexpectation of a higher yen fed a sense of triumphalism leading to massive bubbles in \nthe  stock  and  property  markets  by  1990.  When  the  bubbles  burst  in  1991,  the  yen \ncontinued to rise until April 1995 from American pressure. The economy slumped from \nthese  bursting  bubbles  and  from  exchange  rate  overvaluation.  Although  official \nexchange intervention was quite frequent in crisis periods (Figure 9), the Bank of Japan \n(BOJ) was not trying to devalue. Rather it was just resisting, not very successfully, the \ntendency of the yen to go ever higher\u2014which led its large build-up of dollar exchange \nreserves. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 9:  Foreign Exchange Intervention Operations \n\nSource: Japan MOF. \n\nIn  the  1980s  and  into  the  mid-1990s,  the  BOJ  reduced  interest  rates  in  order  to  curb \nfurther increases in the yen. Ahead of the US, by 1997 the BOJ had set its short-term \ninterest  rate  at  virtually  zero  where  it  remains  today  (Figure  1)\u2014damaging  domestic \nfinancial  intermediation  over  its  two  \u201clost  decades\u201d  of  economic  stagnation  with \ndeflation. Low interest rates, together with a special characteristic of Japan\u2019s economic \nsystem, the banks\u2019 fear that loan defaults would wipe out their capital, led banks to give \nnew low-interest loans to old borrowers to pay off their old loans in danger of default. \nThe  result  was  that  many  unprofitable  enterprises  in  Japan  became  known  as \n\u201czombies,\u201d existing only by being propped up by low-interest bank loans (Ahearne et al \n2005, Caballero et al 2006)  \n\nTo be fair to the Japanese monetary authorities, Japan\u2019s zero-interest liquidity trap was \nexternally  imposed.  American  \u201cJapan  bashing\u201d  from  the  late  1970s  to  the  mid-1990s \nset  up  the  expectation  of  an  ever-higher  yen  that  caused  hot  money  to  flood  into  the \neconomy  so  the  yen  became  overvalued  (at  80  yen  per  dollar  in  April  1995)  and  the \nprice level began to fall as much as a decade earlier.4\n By the principle of open interest \nparity, the expectation of a higher yen itself pushed interest rates down. By 1997 both \nmarket  expectations  of  an  ever  higher  yen  and  desperate  attempts  by  the  BOJ  to \nstimulate  the  slumping  economy  by  easy  money  resulted  in  a  liquidity  trap:  virtually \nzero  short-term  rates  and  long-term  rates  less  than  1%.  In  spite  of  the  damage  to \nJapan\u2019s  economy,  the  ever-higher  yen  was  unable  to  correct  the  chronic  trade \nimbalance between the US and Japan (Qiao 2007).  \n\nA  chronic  trade  surplus  and  deflation,  together  with  Japan\u2019s  low  external  debt  ratio, \nmade  the  yen  a  safe-harbor  currency  during  the  2008  crisis.  Figure  10  shows  the \nrelatively  low  inflation  in  Japan.  When  US  was  struggling  from  the  aftermath  of \n                                                \n4\n This sorry tale of deflation in Japan is spelled out more fully in McKinnon and Ohno (1997). \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nsubprime  mortgage  crisis,  and  the  eurozone  suffering  unprecedented  sovereign  debt \nand banking crises, the Japanese yen, together with the Swiss franc and gold, become \nthe  safe  haven  for  international  capital  inflows  (Habib  et  al  2012,  Ranaldo  and \nS\u00f6derlind  2010).  This  phenomenon  may  be  especially  harmful  to  Japan\u2019s  economy: \nwhen  the  risk  is  high  and  world  growth  faces  a  headwind,  Japan  may  suffer  an \nadditional  blow  from  currency  appreciation.  The  deeper  Japan  is  trapped  in  deflation, \nthe stronger such an effect may be. \n\nFigure 10:  Inflation Rate of Major Advanced Economies (2000-2012) \n\nSource: EIU data; calculations by authors. \n\nIncreases  in  foreign  portfolio  investment  in  Japan  have  confirmed  this  phenomenon \n(Figures 11 and 12) The Swiss National Bank stepped in to prevent further appreciation \nof the Swiss Franc on 11 September 2011; Japan also acted, but wasn\u2019t firm enough to \nconvince the market. The yen rose to its high for decades despite the Great East Japan \nearthquake  and  tsunami.  The  overvaluation  of  the  yen  was  recognized  internationally \nand in March 2011, for the first time since 2000, the G7 announced joint intervention to \nprevent  the  yen  from  further  appreciation.  But  the  yen  still  remained  at  a  high  level \nthrough 2012.  \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nFigure 11: Total Portfolio Investment (Quarterly) \n\nSource: Japan Ministry Of Finance. \n\nFigure 12: Money Market Instruments (Quarterly) \n\nSource: Japan Ministry of Finance. \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nRemarkably,  this  exchange  rate  overvaluation  trap  lasted  from  the  mid-1980s  right \nthrough  2012  as  measured  by  deviations  of  the  yen  from  its  purchasing  power  parity \n(Figure  8).

JAPAN AS PREDATOR? \n\nIn 2013, however, a remarkable change occurred. In December 2012, Shinzo Abe was \nelected  Prime  Minister  on  a  platform  of  expanding  the  balance  sheet  of  the  Bank  of \nJapan  and  seeking  a  higher  inflation  target.  For  2013,  the  BOJ\u2019s  balance  sheet  has \nexpanded proportionately more than twice as much as the very aggressive expansion \nby the U.S central bank. The yen depreciated from about 80 to the dollar in December \n2012  to  more  than  100  by  May  2013  (about  25%),  and  depreciated  relative  to  other \nEast Asian currencies\u2014which tend to track the dollar and/or renminbi. \n\nAt  the  time  of  writing  (June  2013),  the  BOJ  had  announced  a  Japanese  government \nbond  (JGB)  purchasing  program  of  about  Y7  trillion  per  month  in  May,  and  a  Y1.2 \ntrillion commercial paper purchasing program in June. By comparison, BOJ holdings of \nJGBs had been increasing at about Y0.7 trillion per month from 2008 to 2012. Figure \n13  indicates  the  sharply  increased  pace  of  the  BOJ\u2019s  balance  sheet  expansion  from \n2012  to  2013.  The  inflation  target  has  also  been  raised  from  1%  to  2%,  which  is \nsupposed to impact exchange rate through higher inflation expectations. \n\nFigure 13:  Bank of Japan Total Assets \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nThe  dramatic  balance  sheet  expansion  by  the  BOJ  is  not  out  of  line  with  similar \nexpansions in the balance sheets of other major central banks since mid-2008. Figure \n5 shows the balance sheet expansion of the BOJ compared with those of the Fed, the \nECB  and  the  Bank  of  England.  Since  2013,  the  depreciation  of  the  yen  has  reflected \nthe  recent  more  expansionary  Japanese  monetary  policy.  The  renminbi/dollar  rate \nremains  remarkably  stable,  with  very  slow  nominal  appreciation.  However,  Japan\u2019s \nrecent  aggressive  quantitative  easing  has  led  to  serious  concern  from  other  Asian \ncountries,  especially  from  the  PRC  and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  about  a  depreciating \nyen.  Unlike  other  major  advanced  economies,  Japan  is  directly  competing  with  other \nAsian exporters.   \n\nFrom 1982 to 2001, annual output changes in other East Asian economies output were \ninversely  correlated  with  the  yen/dollar  exchange  rate  (McKinnon  and  Schnabl  2003, \nKwan  2001).  When  the  yen  was  weak  against  the  dollar,  the  other  East  Asian \neconomies  (which  were  mainly  pegged  to  the  dollar)  slumped  and  vice  versa.  We \nupdated this result using quarterly data for 1994\u20132012 with a slightly trimmed model5\n: \n\nAsianEconomy\n\ny\nt\n\n=\n\n+\n\u03b2 \u03b2\n2\n\n1\n\ny\nt\n\nUS\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n3\n\ne\nt\n\nUSDJPY\n\n+\n\nu\nt\n\n \n\nWhere ty  is quarterly GDP growth (yoy), and \n\nte  is the yen/dollar exchange rate.  \n\nWe tested this relationship on a group of economies, which we called EA1: Indonesia; \nRepublic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  the  Philippines;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand. \nWe also tested it on EA2, which is EA1 plus the PRC. The results are in Table 1. Most \neconomies, except the PRC and Indonesia, show strong dependence on US growth as \nwell  as  on  the  yen/dollar  exchange  rates.  All  the  economies  except  the  PRC  have \nnegative  USDJPY  coefficients:  \u03b23\n  is  significant  at  the  1%  or  5%  level  so  that \nfluctuations  in  the  yen/dollar  rate  seem  to  impact  the  smaller  East  Asian  economies \nstrongly.  \n\n                                                \n5 The lagged USDJPY term has been dropped because of high quarterly autocorrelation. \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nTable 1: Kwan Model of Fluctuations in East Asian Output, 1994\u20132012 \n\n \n0.35 \n\n0.35 \n \n\n \n0.36 \n\n0.38 \n \n\n \n0.44 \n\n0.69 \n \n\n \n0.59 \n\n0.61 \n \n\n \n0.51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdj.

First,  when  the  yen  appreciates \nagainst the dollar, it also appreciates against the won, baht, ringgit, rupiah, and so on, \nwhich tend to have more stable dollar exchange rates. So the smaller EA countries find \nit  easier  to  export  to  Japan  itself  and  to  compete  with  Japanese  exports  to  third \nmarkets. \n\nSecond, Japan is a creditor economy and has been a major source of direct investment \nto other East Asian economies. Indeed, large Japanese corporations such as Toyota, \nNissan,  Sony,  Matsushita,  and  so  on,  have  set  up  branch  plant  operations  in  other \nAsian  countries.  But  this  source  of  direct  investment  is  cyclical  with  the  yen/dollar \nexchange  rate.  When  the  yen  is  high  and  Japan  has  become  a  relatively  expensive \nplace to produce, Japanese firms disinvest from Japan and invest more in the smaller \nAsian  economies  (and  in  the  US  itself).  Output  is  reallocated  away  from  the  parent \nfirms in Japan to their East Asian subsidiaries whose exports increase, as per our first \neffect.  \n\nBut  when  the  yen  becomes  unusually  weak  against  the  dollar,  these  positive  effects \nquickly  unwind  and  the  smaller  East  Asian  economies  tend  to  slump.  Their  exports, \nlargely invoiced in dollars, fall along with inward direct investment from Japan. One of \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nthe most dramatic episodes was the fall in the yen in 1995\u20131996 just before the great \nAsian crisis of 1997. True, the crisis itself was mainly due to short-term overborrowing \nin  dollars  and  yen  by  five  countries:  Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia, \nPhilippines,  and Thailand.  But  when  the  bubble burst  in  1997,  the negative  economic \nimpact on these countries was aggravated by the weaker value of the yen. \n\nNo wonder other Asian countries are deeply concerned by the recent sharp fall in the \nyen\u2019s  value  from  80  to  100  yen  per  dollar  after  December  2012.  However,  beyond \nfluctuations  in  the  yen/dollar  exchange  rate  it  is  also  important  to  consider  the  more \ngeneral  interdependence  of  East  Asian  economies.  We  update  the  previous  mutual \ndeterminants model (McKinnon and Schnabl 2003) by running the regression for 1994\u2013\n2012: \n\nAsianEconomy\n\ny\nt\n\n=\n\n+\n\u03b2 \u03b2\n2\n\n1\n\ny\nt\n\nUS\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n3\n\ny\nt\n\nJP\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n4\n\ny\nt\n\nCN\n\n+\n\n\u03b2\n5\n\ny\nt\n\nREA\n1\n\n+\n\nu\nt\n\n \n\n \n\n1REA\n\nty\n\nWhere ty\nof EA1 country group. \n\n is now quarterly GDP growth and \n\n is the average growth rate of the rest \n\nThe  result  is  presented  in  Table  2.  Compared  with  Table  1,  there  are  some  minor \nconflicts in the sign of the estimated coefficients due to colinearity. However, the results \nin Table 2 basically support the strong positive impact of fluctuations in Japan\u2019s growth \non  selected  East  Asian  economies.  More  surprising,  if  one  considers  all  the  smaller \nAsian economies collectively, quarterly fluctuations in American output affect the East \nAsian  economy  hardly  at  all.  The  regression  coefficient  for  EA1  in  Table  2  is  not \nsignificantly  different  from  zero.    Table  2  also  shows  that  changes  in  both  the  PRC\u2019s \nand  Japan\u2019s  output  on  the  EA1  countries  are  now  very  significant\u2014reflecting  the \ngreater integration of the East Asian economy. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nTable 2: Mutual Determinants of East Asian Output, 1994\u20132012 \n\nPRC GDP \nGrowth \n\nAdj.

It is reported6\n that the Prime Minister \nsupported  purchasing  foreign  bonds  to  depreciate  yen,  although  Japan  did  not  follow \nthrough with this plan. Unlike quantitative easing, whose exchange rate impact may be \na byproduct, the massive purchases of foreign assets, or other strong signs of linking \nmonetary  policy  to  exchange rate,  are  nearly  a  declaration  of  \u201ccurrency  warfare,\u201d  and \nmay lead to a true \u201ccurrency war.\u201d  \n\nThat  outcome  would  be  against  other  \u201carrows\u201d  of  \u201cAbenomics,\u201d  including  building  a \nstronger  partnership  with  US.  The  ultimate  goal  for  Japan  is  to  boost  inflation  and \ntherefore economic growth, while controlling the size of government debt. Although in \nthe  medium  term  exchange  rate  correction  of  an  overvalued  yen  may  facilitate  this \ngoal,  pushed  to  an  extreme  it  will  prove  intolerable  to  other  countries  and  not  only  in \nAsia.  It  could  bring  back  \u201cJapan  bashing\u201d  by  the  US  itself.  So,  it  is  in  the  interest  of \nJapan to restrict its stimulus package to domestic monetary instruments, and to respect \nthe concern of its trading partners over the yen/dollar exchange rate. \n\nBut  how  can  we  calculate  a  desirable  and  \u201cfair\u201d  yen/dollar  exchange  rate?  The  PPP \nrate (shown in Figure 8) is only a slowly moving variable reflecting slow movements in \nprice levels in both Japan and the US. It can only be calculated with a considerable lag \nfrom price levels in the Penn World Tables. In contrast, the floating market-determined \nrate can move quickly and show jagged large changes\u2014such as the 25% depreciation \nof the yen in 2013. Nevertheless, we can linearly project the PPP rate in Figure 8, since \nPPP  is  highly  dependent  on  the  inflation  differential. 7\n  Assuming  a  2%  inflation \ndifference  in  2013  (which  implies  the  US  reaches  its  2%  target  and  Japan  recovers \nfrom deflation), the projected PPP in 2013 would be about Y100 per dollar\u2014as shown \nby  the  dashed  line  in  Figure  8.  Thus  we  can  presume  that  the  BOJ  has  already \naccomplished  its  mission  of  correcting  the  overvalued  yen  and  further  depreciation  is \nunwarranted.  The  PPP\u2019s  drifting  with  the  inflation  difference  should  also  remind  the \nBOJ about the urgency of its mission: the longer it takes to boost domestic inflation in \nJapan,  the  lower  (more  appreciated)  the  yen\u2019s  \u2018fair  market  value\u2019  will  be  in  terms  of \nPPP with the dollar. \n\n6.  CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DISCUSSION ON \n\nQUANTITATIVE EASING \n\nFrom  a  PPP  of  view,  the  yen  seems  to  have  recovered  from  its  previous  chronic \novervaluation  against  the  dollar  within  a  reasonable  range.  But  in  the  short  run,  the \ntransition  to  a  lower  yen  seems  likely  to  slow  exports  and  depress  incomes  in  the \nsmaller  East  Asian  economies.  In  the  long  run,  however,  a  more  stable  and \nappropriately valued yen should be beneficial to Japan and the other Asian economies. \n\n                                                \n6\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-13/abe-aids-bernanke-as-japan-seen-buying-558-billion-\n\nforeign-debt.html \n\n7 \n\n1980\u20132012, R-square=0.77 \n\nJapan PPP percentage change = 0.095-1.023*(US CPI  change-Japan CPI change), using annual data \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 437 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         McKinnon and Liu \n\nBy  luck  rather  than  design,  the  current  exchange  rate  of  about  100  yen  per  dollar  is \nabout  right  from  the  PPP  point  of  view.    Holding  the  rate  there  is  the  key  to  avoiding \ncurrency wars in the future: there need be no more \u201cJapan bashing\u201d or \u201cChina bashing\u201d \nfrom the US or Europe.   \n\nBut Japan is still in a deflationary trap. If the BoJ springs the trap and boosts inflation to \na  normal  level  as  promised,  market  pressure  on  the  yen  to  appreciate  will  continue. \nNevertheless,  Japan  should  conduct  its  policy  with  only  domestic  tools,  and  refrain \nfrom directly intervening in the foreign exchange market to depreciate the yen.  \n\nEven  with  such  restraint,  however,  the  impact  of  Japan\u2019s  new  monetary  policy  based \nmainly on quantitative easing contains a contradiction. On the one hand, the BOJ has \nincreased  its  long\u2013run  inflation  target  to  2%  per  year.  If  the  market  believes  that  the \nBOJ will be successful, the expectation of higher inflation should increase interest rates \non long-term JGBs. On the other hand, through massive quantitative easing by buying \nlonger-term yen securities, the BOJ is trying to force long-term rates down. The result \nis  turmoil  in  the  market  for  long-term  JGBs.  Any  hint  of  a  relaxation  of  Japan\u2019s  QE \ncauses long-term bond rates to jump with discrete falls (appreciations) in the yen/dollar \nrate.  \n\nCurrently,  the  US  Fed  faces  a  similar  dilemma.  It  can\u2019t  exit  its  QE  without  long-term \nbond  rates  jumping.  Any  time  Fed  Chairman  Ben  Bernanke  meets  the  press  and \nsuggests  that  bond  purchases  might  \u201ctaper  off\u201d  (his  expression),  long-term  interest \nrates  jump  and  bond  prices  fall\u2014an  effect  aggravated  by  the  extremely  low  average \ninterest  rates.  One  result  of  this  volatility  is  that  that  bond  dealers  are  reducing  their \ninventories of bonds so as to cause severe illiquidity in the bond market. Inventories of \n\u201cdealer banks\u201d had fallen from a peak of about $235 billion in 2007 to as low $37 billion \nin July 2012, according to Fed data\u201d8\n\n.   \n\nThe upshot is that just talk of exiting from quantitative easing is undermining the ability \nof the bond markets to provide longer-term finance for industry and local governments.  \nA headline in the Wall Street Journal in June 2013 read \u201cBond Investors Head for the \nHills\u201d and below it \u201cInvestors have pulled money out of assets ranging from lower-rated \n9 \ncorporate bonds to ultra safe US Treasurys in sums unseen since the financial crisis.\u201d\nThis  crisis  at  the  long-term  end  of  the  market  is  compounded  by  zero  short-term \ninterest rates.  When investors flee from bond funds into money-market mutual funds or \nbank  deposits,  banks  and  money  market  funds  tend  to  fail  as  financial  intermediaries \nwhen interest rates are close to zero.10\n \n\nSo the BOJ and Fed seem to be in the same boat\u2014not to mention the ECB and Bank \nof England. How they should act jointly to spring the near zero interest financial trap\u2014\nfor  both  short-term  and  long-term  finance\u2014is  a  long  story  for  another  time.  But \nmutually stabilizing exchange rates and interest rates, at moderately positive levels, are \nan important part of the story.  \n\n                                                \n8\n Financial Times, 17 June 2013, p. 16. \n9\n Wall Street Journal, 19 June 2013, p.

But under the postwar dollar standard, the central \nposition of the US was key to maintaining the peace, until the Bretton Woods system of fixed \ndollar  exchange  parities  fell  apart  after  the  so-called  \u201cNixon  Shock\u201d  of  1971.  Now,  without \nmuch fear of retaliation, the US can initiate more limited currency warfare\u2014as with American \n\u201cJapan bashing\u201d from the late 1970s to mid-1990s to appreciate the yen, or \u201cChina bashing\u201d \nsince  2002  to  appreciate  the  renminbi.    Japan  succumbed  to  this  bashing,  and  the  yen \nappreciated too much in 1985, with the result that Japan fell into a zero-interest liquidity trap \nand  economic  stagnation  for  almost  two  decades.  However,  in  2013,  through  massive \nquantitative easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the yen depreciated about 25% against the \ndollar,  stoking  fears  of  a  return  to  Japan  bashing  by  the  US.  However,  this  sharp \ndepreciation  simply  restored  the  purchasing  power  parity  of  the  yen  with  the  dollar  so  it \nshould  even  out  in  the  long  run.  In  the  short  run,  we  show  that  yen  depreciation  could \nadversely  affect  the smaller  East  Asian  economies.  Since  2008, quantitative  easing  by  the \nBOJ has been similar to that carried out by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, \nand the European Central Bank. So the BOJ can only be faulted as a currency belligerent if \nthere  is  a  further  significant  yen  depreciation.  Led  by  the  US,  now  all  mature  industrial \ncountries are addicted to near-zero interest liquidity traps in both the short and long terms. \nThese ultra low interest rates are causing lasting damage to the countries\u2019 financial systems, \nand  to  those  of  emerging  markets,  which  naturally  have  higher  interest  rates.  But  exiting \nfrom the trap creates a risk of chaos in long-term bond markets and is proving surprisingly \ndifficult.1\n", "   \n", " \nJEL Classification: F31, F32 \n \n", "                                                \n1 The authors want to thank Rishi Goyal for his valuable comments and suggestions. \n", " \n"]}
