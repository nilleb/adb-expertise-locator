But under the postwar dollar standard, the central \nposition of the US was key to maintaining the peace, until the Bretton Woods system of fixed \ndollar exchange parities fell apart after the so-called \u201cNixon Shock\u201d of 1971. Now, without \nmuch fear of retaliation, the US can initiate more limited currency warfare\u2014as with American \n\u201cJapan bashing\u201d from the late 1970s to mid-1990s to appreciate the yen, or \u201cChina bashing\u201d \nsince 2002 to appreciate the renminbi.  Japan succumbed to this bashing, and the yen \nappreciated too much in 1985, with the result that Japan fell into a zero-interest liquidity trap \nand  economic  stagnation  for  almost  two  decades.  However,  in  2013,  through  massive \nquantitative easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the yen depreciated about 25% against the \ndollar,  stoking  fears  of  a  return  to  Japan  bashing  by  the  US.  However,  this  sharp \ndepreciation simply restored the purchasing power parity of the yen with the dollar so it \nshould even out in the long run. In the short run, we show that yen depreciation could \nadversely affect the smaller East Asian economies. Since 2008, quantitative easing by the \nBOJ has been similar to that carried out by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, \nand the European Central Bank. So the BOJ can only be faulted as a currency belligerent if \nthere is a further significant yen depreciation. Led by the US, now all mature industrial \ncountries are addicted to near-zero interest liquidity traps in both the short and long terms. \nThese ultra low interest rates are causing lasting damage to the countries\u2019 financial systems, \nand to those of emerging markets, which naturally have higher interest rates. But exiting \nfrom the trap creates a risk of chaos in long-term bond markets and is proving surprisingly \ndifficult.1   \n \nJEL Classification: F31, F32 \n \n                                                \n1\n The authors want to thank Rishi Goyal for his valuable comments and suggestions. \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                                   McKinnon and Liu \nContents \n \n \n1.

GOLD STANDARD AND THE GREAT DEPRESSION \nIn the 1920s and 1930s, currency wars\u2014although very destructive\u2014were at least easy \nto identify. Their hallmark was a large devaluation of one nation\u2019s currency against gold \nwhile its trading partners remained tied to the yellow metal.  \nAfter World War I and much debate, in 1925 the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, \nWinston Churchill, tried to restore an international standard by pegging the price of gold \nat \u00a34.86 per ounce\u2014its pre-1914 parity. Many other nations followed suit. But in late \n1926, France, which had inflated and depreciated its currency far below its pre-war \nparity, finally managed to stabilize its currency by sharply raising interest rates, the \nfamous Poincar\u00e9 Stabilization. This undervalued the franc against the pound, and, \ntogether with the higher interest rates in France, began to drain gold from Britain. \nDespite its depressed economy and high unemployment in the 1920s, Britain kept its \nown interest rates high to protect its slender gold reserves.  \nThis gold drain then caused a banking panic in Germany, forcing it to \u201caccidentally\u201d \ndevalue  in  1931.  The  British  more  deliberately  abandoned  the  gold  standard  in \nSeptember 1931 with a deep devaluation, and Japan followed in December 1931.  The \nUS had not changed its pre-war gold parity of $20 per ounce, but as a safe haven it \nhad  still  accumulated  much  of  the  world\u2019s  gold.    In  1933  and  after  considerable \ntinkering, President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by raising the official price of an \nounce of gold from $20 to $35 despite the fact that the US had a trade surplus. This \nseries of \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbor\u201d devaluations then came full circle back to France, and \nin 1936 it was forced to devalue along with some smaller European countries that were \ntied to it.  \nIn each case, the threat of a run on the country\u2019s gold stock (hot money flows) before it \nthey devalued induced governments to cut expenditures (impose austerity) and raise \ninterest  rates.  The  US  actually  raised  interest  rates  in  1931  even  as  the  Great \nDepression  was  unfolding  worldwide.  So  the  collective  retrenchment  in  the  major \ncountries deepened the worldwide depression, which could be fairly characterized as \nan implosion of the international gold standard.  \n2.  POSTWAR DOLLAR STANDARD \nAfter World War II, gold was dethroned in favor of the dollar, but this was more by \naccident than design. In 1945, the major industrial countries other than the US were \ndamaged  by  the  war,  had  open  or  repressed  inflation,  and  controls  on  foreign \nexchange transactions. Because only the U.S had an open and stable financial system, \nforeign banks and corporations naturally began using the dollar as the key vehicle \ncurrency for clearing international payments and for invoicing international trade flows. \nForeign governments starting holding their reserves in dollars, which had become the \nofficial intervention currency even before the 1945 Bretton Woods agreement obliged \nthem to declare official dollar exchange parities. But with foreign countries all specifying \ndollar exchange rate parities, this left\u2014and still leaves\u2014the center country without a \ndirect exchange rate policy of its own.  \n2\nAmazingly this dollar-based system has persisted from 1945 to the present day.  In \n2013, when the PRC trades with Brazil, both countries invoice their exports in dollars \nand clear interbank payments using the dollar as the intermediary currency.  The dollar \n                                                \n2 The dollar\u2019s traumatic history in this central role is analyzed in McKinnon 2013.  \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nis now the standard reference currency for determining a currency\u2019s international value.  \nBut the dollar standard is now under siege from major industrial countries trying to \nforce down their interest rates. \nIn slack economic times, the modern version of a \"currency war\" takes the form of a \ncountry putting downward pressure on its dollar exchange rate\u2014either directly through \nofficial  foreign  exchange  intervention  or,  more  commonly,  indirectly  by  through \ndomestic monetary policies. Most advanced economies today, such as the US, have \nfloating  exchange  rates.   But  their  monetary  policies  include  near-zero  short-term \ninterest rates and quantitative easing (QE) as central banks have purchased longer-\nterm Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities. By inducing capital outflows from \nthe US, both methods have put untoward, if inadvertent, downward pressure on the \ndollar in the foreign exchanges. \n3.  THE FED: OPENING SALVOS IN THE MODERN \n\u201cCURRENCY WAR\u201d \nSince 2000, the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) has twice sharply reduced short-term \ninterbank interest rates (Figure 1). After the collapse of the high-tech bubble in 2001, \nthe Fed cut its overnight funds rate to just 1% in late 2002\u2014and then held it down for \nalmost 2 years so as to create bubbles in the property, commodity, and stock markets \n(Taylor 2009). The other episode came with the collapse in these bubbles creating the \nUS subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. In response to the ensuing recession, the Fed \nthen cut the US interbank rate to virtually zero in December 2008\u2014where it remains \ntoday. With short-term interest rates at zero since 2009, the Fed has initiated various \nrounds  of  quantitative  easing  by  buying  long-term  Treasury  bonds,  asset-backed \nmortgage securities, and other long-term instruments so as to reduce long-term rates \nas well. We are currently in the third round of massive QE with the Fed buying $85 \nbillion of longer-term US securities per month. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 1: Money Market Interest Rate(MMR) and Long Term Bond Yield (LTBY), \nUS and Japan (%) \nSource: EIU data; calculations by authors. \nWhy are near zero interest rates a potential beggar-thy-neighbor exchange rate policy? \nUltra-low  interest  rates  in  the  US  periodically  unleash  floods  of  hot  money  into \nemerging markets with higher growth and naturally higher interest rates. Any emerging \nmarket central bank is then faced with an uncomfortable choice: either let its exchange \nrate  appreciate  against  the  dollar  and  thus  lose  export  competiveness  against  its \nneighbors, or intervene heavily to buy dollars to smooth exchange fluctuations and \nthereby lose monetary control. Since 2002, emerging markets have acquired more than \n$6 trillion in foreign exchange reserves (Figure 2) and their consumer price index (CPI) \ninflation has been more than 4 percentage points higher than in the US despite, on net \n3\nbalance,  having  appreciated  in  nominal  terms  against  the  dollar  (Figure  3).   \n                                                \n3 McKinnon 2013, Chapter 5. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 2: Foreign Exchange Reserves of Selected Economies (US$ Billion) \nSource: IFS. \nEmerging Markets (EM) include the following economies Russia; Poland; Czech Republic; Hungary; \nRomania; Ukraine; Turkey; Israel; UAE;  Saudi Arabia; South Africa; PRC; India; Hong Kong, China; \nRepublic  of   Korea;   Singapore;  Indonesia;  Malaysia;  Thailand;  Brazil;  Mexico;  Chile;  Peru; \nColombia; Argentina; and Venezuela.

Figure 2 shows the buildup of \nemerging market foreign exchange reserves stopped with the subprime mortgage crisis \nin the US in 2008\u2013into 2009. . It then began again in mid-2009 when that crisis seemed \nto  be  contained  and  the  large  interest  differential  in  favor  of  emerging  markets \nremained. However, from mid-2011 onward, the rapid buildup stopped again with the \nunresolved  eurozone  banking  crisis.  Banking  crises  in  the  US  and  Europe  are \nintertwined as their banks borrow or lend to each other. Because these \u201cinternational\u201d \nbanks provide much of the funding for the carry trades behind the hot money flows, an \ninternational crisis forces them to retrench and the flows to reverse.   \nIn  mid-2013,  the  most  recent  crisis  has  been  associated  with  Federal  Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke musing at a press conference on 19 June that the Fed might \n\u201ctaper off\u201d its program of buying huge amounts of US Treasury bonds and other long-\nterm instruments. He carefully hedged his position by saying that certain pre-conditions \nhad to be met\u2014notably a fall in the unemployment rate to 6.5%\u2014 before tapering could \nbegin. But the markets ignored all his careful caveats. Long-term interest rates rose, \nfrom  1.5%  to  2.5%  in  the  US,  and  stock  markets  crashed  around  the  world\u2014\nparticularly in emerging markets\u2014as hot money flowed back to the center country \nleading to a strengthening of the dollar in the foreign exchanges. \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nThe other industrial economies collectively are also affected by the Fed\u2019s policies. After \n2008 in response to the unprecedented financial crisis and the Fed\u2019s leadership, the \nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England also reduced their short-term \ninterest rates toward zero (Figure 6). Short-term rates in Japan were already at zero \n(Figure 1). All four central banks have also engaged in massive quantitative easing\u2014\nexpanding their balance sheets\u2014that, since 2008, look similar (Figure 5).   \nFigure 5: Size of Central Bank Balance Sheet (% of GDP) \nSource: Bloomberg, OECD Stat. \n \n \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 6: GDP Weighted Discount Rate of BRICS and G3 \nSource: IMF, EIU data; calculations by authors. \nIn both emerging markets and the industrial countries, the result has been financial \nrepression. To the disadvantage of savers in the industrial world, bank deposit interest \nrates are now less than domestic rates of inflation. With interest rates in industrial \ncountries at rock bottom, the interest rate differential between advanced economies \nand  healthy  developing  economies  potentially  induces  rounds  of  emerging  market \ncurrency appreciation. \nOf course, each mature industrial country claims that it is only responding to domestic \ndeflationary pressure and that it is not trying to devalue or conduct a beggar-thy-\nneighbor policy of direct devaluation. However, even if they are not deliberate, these \nactions constitute currency warfare by stealth because central banks in the mature \nindustrial  economies  essentially  ignore  the  impact  of  their  monetary  policies  on \nneighboring  countries\u2014particularly  emerging  markets.  Overall,  the  persistent  huge \ninterest  differential  between  industrial  countries  with  near  zero  short  rates  and \nemerging markets with naturally higher rates (Figure 6) is an ongoing source of hot \nmoney flows and financial turmoil in the international economy. \n4.  JAPAN AS VICTIM  \nIn the postwar period after the Bretton Woods system of fixed dollar exchange parities \nfell apart (the so-called \u201cNixon Shock\u201d of 1971), Japan was an early victim of currency \nwarfare. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, Japan\u2019s relatively high rate of savings \nled to current account surpluses that were particularly obvious when compared with the \nbilateral trade deficits of the savings-deficient US (see the left-hand panel of Figure 7) \nJapan was accused of deliberately undervaluing the yen against the dollar to increase \nits exports. The result was American \u201cJapan bashing,\u201d with threats of tariffs and quotas \non imports of goods from Japan, unless the yen appreciated.   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 7:  Bilateral Trade Balances of Japan and PRC versus the US \n(percentage of US GDP, 1985-2012) \nSource: Census Bureau, IMF. \nThis resulted in the famous Plaza Accord in 1985: a negotiated sharp appreciation of \nthe yen, after which the yen continued to appreciate until April 1995. The political \naccusation that Japan had undervalued the yen is questionable. According to the Penn \nWorld  Tables  (Heston  et  al  2012),  the  yen  was  overvalued  compared  with  its \npurchasing power parity (PPP) from 1985 through 2012 (Figure 8). Although PPP is \nonly one factor affecting the exchange rate, the yen\u2019s level well above its PPP was an \nimportant factor in Japan\u2019s continued stagnation through 2012.  \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 8:  Japan Exchange Rate (Yen/Dollar) and Purchasing Power Parity, \nprojected into 2013 \nSource: Penn World Table 7.1, FRED. \nPPP Projected by linear model: Japan PPP percentage change = 0.095-1.023*(US CPI  change-Japan \nCPI change) \nThis syndrome of an ever higher yen, from 360 yen to the dollar in August 1971 to \ntouch just 80 in April 1995, was disastrous for the Japanese economy. Initially, the \nexpectation of a higher yen fed a sense of triumphalism leading to massive bubbles in \nthe stock and property markets by 1990. When the bubbles burst in 1991, the yen \ncontinued to rise until April 1995 from American pressure. The economy slumped from \nthese  bursting  bubbles  and  from  exchange  rate  overvaluation.  Although  official \nexchange intervention was quite frequent in crisis periods (Figure 9), the Bank of Japan \n(BOJ) was not trying to devalue. Rather it was just resisting, not very successfully, the \ntendency of the yen to go ever higher\u2014which led its large build-up of dollar exchange \nreserves. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nFigure 9:  Foreign Exchange Intervention Operations \nSource: Japan MOF. \nIn the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, the BOJ reduced interest rates in order to curb \nfurther increases in the yen. Ahead of the US, by 1997 the BOJ had set its short-term \ninterest rate at virtually zero where it remains today (Figure 1)\u2014damaging domestic \nfinancial  intermediation  over  its  two  \u201clost  decades\u201d  of  economic  stagnation  with \ndeflation. Low interest rates, together with a special characteristic of Japan\u2019s economic \nsystem, the banks\u2019 fear that loan defaults would wipe out their capital, led banks to give \nnew low-interest loans to old borrowers to pay off their old loans in danger of default. \nThe  result  was  that  many  unprofitable  enterprises  in  Japan  became  known  as \n\u201czombies,\u201d existing only by being propped up by low-interest bank loans (Ahearne et al \n2005, Caballero et al 2006)  \nTo be fair to the Japanese monetary authorities, Japan\u2019s zero-interest liquidity trap was \nexternally imposed. American \u201cJapan bashing\u201d from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s \nset up the expectation of an ever-higher yen that caused hot money to flood into the \neconomy so the yen became overvalued (at 80 yen per dollar in April 1995) and the \n4\nprice level began to fall as much as a decade earlier.  By the principle of open interest \nparity, the expectation of a higher yen itself pushed interest rates down. By 1997 both \nmarket expectations of an ever higher yen and desperate attempts by the BOJ to \nstimulate the slumping economy by easy money resulted in a liquidity trap: virtually \nzero short-term rates and long-term rates less than 1%. In spite of the damage to \nJapan\u2019s  economy,  the  ever-higher  yen  was  unable  to  correct  the  chronic  trade \nimbalance between the US and Japan (Qiao 2007).  \nA chronic trade surplus and deflation, together with Japan\u2019s low external debt ratio, \nmade the yen a safe-harbor currency during the 2008 crisis. Figure 10 shows the \nrelatively  low  inflation  in  Japan.  When  US  was  struggling  from  the  aftermath  of \n                                                \n4\n This sorry tale of deflation in Japan is spelled out more fully in McKinnon and Ohno (1997). \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nsubprime mortgage crisis, and the eurozone suffering unprecedented sovereign debt \nand banking crises, the Japanese yen, together with the Swiss franc and gold, become \nthe  safe  haven  for  international  capital  inflows  (Habib  et  al  2012,  Ranaldo  and \nS\u00f6derlind 2010). This phenomenon may be especially harmful to Japan\u2019s economy: \nwhen  the  risk  is  high  and  world  growth  faces  a  headwind,  Japan  may  suffer  an \nadditional blow from currency appreciation. The deeper Japan is trapped in deflation, \nthe stronger such an effect may be. \nFigure 10:  Inflation Rate of Major Advanced Economies (2000-2012) \nSource: EIU data; calculations by authors. \nIncreases in foreign portfolio investment in Japan have confirmed this phenomenon \n(Figures 11 and 12) The Swiss National Bank stepped in to prevent further appreciation \nof the Swiss Franc on 11 September 2011; Japan also acted, but wasn\u2019t firm enough to \nconvince the market.

The overvaluation of the yen was recognized internationally \nand in March 2011, for the first time since 2000, the G7 announced joint intervention to \nprevent the yen from further appreciation.

Japan  has  indeed  suffered  from  currency  warfare\u2014undue  exchange \nappreciation\u2014 resulting in almost two decades of stagnation.    \n5.  JAPAN AS PREDATOR? \nIn 2013, however, a remarkable change occurred. In December 2012, Shinzo Abe was \nelected Prime Minister on a platform of expanding the balance sheet of the Bank of \nJapan and seeking a higher inflation target. For 2013, the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet has \nexpanded proportionately more than twice as much as the very aggressive expansion \nby the U.S central bank. The yen depreciated from about 80 to the dollar in December \n2012 to more than 100 by May 2013 (about 25%), and depreciated relative to other \nEast Asian currencies\u2014which tend to track the dollar and/or renminbi. \nAt the time of writing (June 2013), the BOJ had announced a Japanese government \nbond (JGB) purchasing program of about Y7 trillion per month in May, and a Y1.2 \ntrillion commercial paper purchasing program in June. By comparison, BOJ holdings of \nJGBs had been increasing at about Y0.7 trillion per month from 2008 to 2012. Figure \n13 indicates the sharply increased pace of the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet expansion from \n2012 to 2013. The inflation target has also been raised from 1% to 2%, which is \nsupposed to impact exchange rate through higher inflation expectations. \nFigure 13:  Bank of Japan Total Assets \nSource: Bank of Japan. \n \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nThe  dramatic  balance sheet  expansion  by  the  BOJ  is  not  out  of  line  with  similar \nexpansions in the balance sheets of other major central banks since mid-2008. Figure \n5 shows the balance sheet expansion of the BOJ compared with those of the Fed, the \nECB and the Bank of England. Since 2013, the depreciation of the yen has reflected \nthe recent more  expansionary  Japanese  monetary  policy. The  renminbi/dollar  rate \nremains remarkably stable, with very slow nominal appreciation. However, Japan\u2019s \nrecent aggressive quantitative easing has led to serious concern from other Asian \ncountries, especially from the PRC and the Republic of Korea, about a depreciating \nyen. Unlike other major advanced economies, Japan is directly competing with other \nAsian exporters.   \nFrom 1982 to 2001, annual output changes in other East Asian economies output were \ninversely correlated with the yen/dollar exchange rate (McKinnon and Schnabl 2003, \nKwan  2001).  When  the  yen  was  weak  against  the  dollar,  the  other  East  Asian \neconomies (which were mainly pegged to the dollar) slumped and vice versa.

The results are in Table 1. Most \neconomies, except the PRC and Indonesia, show strong dependence on US growth as \nwell as on the yen/dollar exchange rates. All the economies except the PRC have \nnegative  USDJPY  coefficients:  \u03b2   is  significant  at  the  1%  or  5%  level  so  that \n3\nfluctuations in the yen/dollar rate seem to impact the smaller East Asian economies \nstrongly.  \n                                                \n5 The lagged USDJPY term has been dropped because of high quarterly autocorrelation. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nTable 1: Kwan Model of Fluctuations in East Asian Output, 1994\u20132012 \nUS GDP  USD/JPY Monthly  Adj.

First, when the yen appreciates \nagainst the dollar, it also appreciates against the won, baht, ringgit, rupiah, and so on, \nwhich tend to have more stable dollar exchange rates. So the smaller EA countries find \nit  easier  to  export to  Japan  itself  and to compete  with  Japanese  exports  to  third \nmarkets. \nSecond, Japan is a creditor economy and has been a major source of direct investment \nto other East Asian economies. Indeed, large Japanese corporations such as Toyota, \nNissan, Sony, Matsushita, and so on, have set up branch plant operations in other \nAsian countries. But this source of direct investment is cyclical with the yen/dollar \nexchange rate. When the yen is high and Japan has become a relatively expensive \nplace to produce, Japanese firms disinvest from Japan and invest more in the smaller \nAsian economies (and in the US itself). Output is reallocated away from the parent \nfirms in Japan to their East Asian subsidiaries whose exports increase, as per our first \neffect.  \nBut when the yen becomes unusually weak against the dollar, these positive effects \nquickly unwind and the smaller East Asian economies tend to slump. Their exports, \nlargely invoiced in dollars, fall along with inward direct investment from Japan. One of \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nthe most dramatic episodes was the fall in the yen in 1995\u20131996 just before the great \nAsian crisis of 1997. True, the crisis itself was mainly due to short-term overborrowing \nin  dollars  and  yen  by  five  countries:  Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia, \nPhilippines, and Thailand. But when the bubble burst in 1997, the negative economic \nimpact on these countries was aggravated by the weaker value of the yen. \nNo wonder other Asian countries are deeply concerned by the recent sharp fall in the \nyen\u2019s value from 80 to 100 yen per dollar after December 2012. However, beyond \nfluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate it is also important to consider the more \ngeneral interdependence of East Asian economies. We update the previous mutual \ndeterminants model (McKinnon and Schnabl 2003) by running the regression for 1994\u2013\n2012: \ny AsianEconomy =\u03b2+\u03b2yUS +\u03b2y JP +\u03b2yCN +\u03b2yREA1+u\nt 1 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t t \n \ny yREA1\nWhere t is now quarterly GDP growth and  t  is the average growth rate of the rest \nof EA1 country group. \nThe result is presented in Table 2. Compared with Table 1, there are some minor \nconflicts in the sign of the estimated coefficients due to colinearity. However, the results \nin Table 2 basically support the strong positive impact of fluctuations in Japan\u2019s growth \non selected East Asian economies. More surprising, if one considers all the smaller \nAsian economies collectively, quarterly fluctuations in American output affect the East \nAsian economy hardly at all. The regression coefficient for EA1 in Table 2 is not \nsignificantly different from zero.  Table 2 also shows that changes in both the PRC\u2019s \nand  Japan\u2019s  output  on  the  EA1  countries  are  now  very  significant\u2014reflecting  the \ngreater integration of the East Asian economy. \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nTable 2: Mutual Determinants of East Asian Output, 1994\u20132012 \nJapan  Rest of \nTarget  US GDP  GDP  PRC GDP  EA1 \nEconomies  Growth  Growth  Growth  Growth  Adj.

It is reported  that the Prime Minister \nsupported purchasing foreign bonds to depreciate yen, although Japan did not follow \nthrough with this plan. Unlike quantitative easing, whose exchange rate impact may be \na byproduct, the massive purchases of foreign assets, or other strong signs of linking \nmonetary policy to exchange rate, are nearly a declaration of \u201ccurrency warfare,\u201d and \nmay lead to a true \u201ccurrency war.\u201d  \nThat outcome would be against other \u201carrows\u201d of \u201cAbenomics,\u201d including building a \nstronger partnership with US. The ultimate goal for Japan is to boost inflation and \ntherefore economic growth, while controlling the size of government debt. Although in \nthe medium term exchange rate correction of an overvalued yen may facilitate this \ngoal, pushed to an extreme it will prove intolerable to other countries and not only in \nAsia. It could bring back \u201cJapan bashing\u201d by the US itself. So, it is in the interest of \nJapan to restrict its stimulus package to domestic monetary instruments, and to respect \nthe concern of its trading partners over the yen/dollar exchange rate. \nBut how can we calculate a desirable and \u201cfair\u201d yen/dollar exchange rate? The PPP \nrate (shown in Figure 8) is only a slowly moving variable reflecting slow movements in \nprice levels in both Japan and the US. It can only be calculated with a considerable lag \nfrom price levels in the Penn World Tables. In contrast, the floating market-determined \nrate can move quickly and show jagged large changes\u2014such as the 25% depreciation \nof the yen in 2013. Nevertheless, we can linearly project the PPP rate in Figure 8, since \n7\nPPP  is  highly  dependent  on  the  inflation  differential.   Assuming  a  2%  inflation \ndifference in 2013 (which implies the US reaches its 2% target and Japan recovers \nfrom deflation), the projected PPP in 2013 would be about Y100 per dollar\u2014as shown \nby the dashed line in Figure 8. Thus we can presume that the BOJ has already \naccomplished its mission of correcting the overvalued yen and further depreciation is \nunwarranted. The PPP\u2019s drifting with the inflation difference should also remind the \nBOJ about the urgency of its mission: the longer it takes to boost domestic inflation in \nJapan, the lower (more appreciated) the yen\u2019s \u2018fair market value\u2019 will be in terms of \nPPP with the dollar. \n6.  CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DISCUSSION ON \nQUANTITATIVE EASING \nFrom a PPP of view, the yen seems to have recovered from its previous chronic \novervaluation against the dollar within a reasonable range. But in the short run, the \ntransition to a lower yen seems likely to slow exports and depress incomes in the \nsmaller  East  Asian  economies.  In  the  long  run,  however,  a  more  stable  and \nappropriately valued yen should be beneficial to Japan and the other Asian economies. \n                                                \n6\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-13/abe-aids-bernanke-as-japan-seen-buying-558-billion-\nforeign-debt.html \n7 \nJapan PPP percentage change = 0.095-1.023*(US CPI  change-Japan CPI change), using annual data \n1980\u20132012, R-square=0.77 \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 437                     McKinnon and Liu \n \nBy luck rather than design, the current exchange rate of about 100 yen per dollar is \nabout right from the PPP point of view.  Holding the rate there is the key to avoiding \ncurrency wars in the future: there need be no more \u201cJapan bashing\u201d or \u201cChina bashing\u201d \nfrom the US or Europe.   \nBut Japan is still in a deflationary trap. If the BoJ springs the trap and boosts inflation to \na normal level as promised, market pressure on the yen to appreciate will continue. \nNevertheless, Japan should conduct its policy with only domestic tools, and refrain \nfrom directly intervening in the foreign exchange market to depreciate the yen.  \nEven with such restraint, however, the impact of Japan\u2019s new monetary policy based \nmainly on quantitative easing contains a contradiction. On the one hand, the BOJ has \nincreased its long\u2013run inflation target to 2% per year. If the market believes that the \nBOJ will be successful, the expectation of higher inflation should increase interest rates \non long-term JGBs. On the other hand, through massive quantitative easing by buying \nlonger-term yen securities, the BOJ is trying to force long-term rates down. The result \nis turmoil in the market for long-term JGBs. Any hint of a relaxation of Japan\u2019s QE \ncauses long-term bond rates to jump with discrete falls (appreciations) in the yen/dollar \nrate.  \nCurrently, the US Fed faces a similar dilemma. It can\u2019t exit its QE without long-term \nbond rates jumping. Any time Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke meets the press and \nsuggests that bond purchases might \u201ctaper off\u201d (his expression), long-term interest \nrates jump and bond prices fall\u2014an effect aggravated by the extremely low average \ninterest rates. One result of this volatility is that that bond dealers are reducing their \ninventories of bonds so as to cause severe illiquidity in the bond market. Inventories of \n\u201cdealer banks\u201d had fallen from a peak of about $235 billion in 2007 to as low $37 billion \n8\nin July 2012, according to Fed data\u201d .   \nThe upshot is that just talk of exiting from quantitative easing is undermining the ability \nof the bond markets to provide longer-term finance for industry and local governments.  \nA headline in the Wall Street Journal in June 2013 read \u201cBond Investors Head for the \nHills\u201d and below it \u201cInvestors have pulled money out of assets ranging from lower-rated \n9\ncorporate bonds to ultra safe US Treasurys in sums unseen since the financial crisis.\u201d  \nThis crisis at the long-term end of the market is compounded by zero short-term \ninterest rates.  When investors flee from bond funds into money-market mutual funds or \nbank deposits, banks and money market funds tend to fail as financial intermediaries \n10\nwhen interest rates are close to zero.  \nSo the BOJ and Fed seem to be in the same boat\u2014not to mention the ECB and Bank \nof England. How they should act jointly to spring the near zero interest financial trap\u2014\nfor  both  short-term  and  long-term  finance\u2014is  a  long  story  for  another  time.  But \nmutually stabilizing exchange rates and interest rates, at moderately positive levels, are \nan important part of the story.  \n                                                \n8\n Financial Times, 17 June 2013, p. 16. \n9\n Wall Street Journal, 19 June 2013, p.
