INTRODUCTION \n \nThe relationship between sovereign risk and exchange rate stability has long been a subject of interest in \ninternational finance. Papers on the subject include Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996); Frankel and \nRose (1996); Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1998); and Kumar, Moorthy, and Perraudin (2003), who \nuse macroeconomic indicators to estimate the probability of currency crashes. On the empirical side, \nReinhart (2002), finds that 84% of the defaults in her emerging markets sample are connected with \ncurrency crises and almost half of the currency crises in the sample are related to defaults. Herz and Tong \n(2008) find that 32% of all debt crises in emerging markets are linked to currency crises, while 20% of \ncurrency crises are associated with debt crises. Dreher, Herz, and Karb (2006) study the empirical \nrelationship between currency and sovereign debt crises, covering 80 countries over 1975\u20132000, and find \nthat currency crisis is more likely to occur when there is a contemporaneous debt crisis, and vice versa. \nEmpirically, twin debt and currency crises occur more frequently than twin banking and currency crises.  \n \nThe dynamic linkage between sovereign credit risk and exchange rates has been studied for \nemerging markets. Carr and Wu (2007) investigate the connection between currency option-implied \nvolatilities and sovereign creditworthiness for Mexico and Brazil from 2002 to 2005. They find that the \nlevel and skew of the option-implied volatility display significant comovement with the sovereign credit-\ndefault swap (CDS) spreads of the two countries. Pan and Singleton (2008) explore the term structure \nof CDS spreads for Mexico, Turkey, and the Republic of Korea from 2001 to 2006 and consider the risk-\nneutral credit event intensities and loss rates that best describe the CDS data. Their results suggest that \ncurrency option volatilities may have served as a proxy for the fundamental macroeconomic and event \nrisks embodied in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX).1 Pavlova and de Boyrie (2015) find information flows \nbetween currency carry-trade returns of nine economies in the Asia and Pacific and changes in the \nMarkit iTraxx SovX Asia Pacific index from 2008 to 2011, which are negatively correlated.2 \n \nWhile sovereign risk and exchange rate stability have been studied in the context of sovereign \ndebt crises, the literature on the empirical determinants of sovereign bond yield spreads usually focus \non variables other than exchange rates. Some papers, including Edwards (1986), Eichengreen and Mody \n(2000), Min (1998), Beck (2001), and Ferrucci (2003), concentrate on reduced form regressions of \nspreads on a large set of macroeconomic variables. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, \nand United States (US) Treasury yields are found to be important explanatory variables. Duffie, \nPedersen, and Singleton (2003) develop a flexible reduced form model of sovereign yield spreads. They \nestimate their model using weekly data on Russian dollar-denominated debt and US swap yields \nbetween 1994 and 1998. The study relates spreads implied by the model to political factors, foreign \nexchange reserves, oil prices, and the VIX. Longstaff et al. (2011) demonstrate that US stock and bond \nmarket returns, and global volatility, can explain much of the variation in sovereign CDS spreads. \nHilscher and Nosbusch (2010) investigate the effects of macroeconomic fundamentals on emerging \nmarket sovereign credit spreads and find that terms of trade volatility in particular has a statistically and \neconomically significant effect on spreads. Jeanneret (2015) proposes a model which generates daily \nsovereign credit spreads using expected economic conditions, which are structurally extracted from the \nlocal stock market. \n \nTo price sovereign risky bonds based on exchange rate dynamics, Cathcart and El-Jahel (1998) \npropose a model in which default occurs when some signaling process hits a constant default barrier. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   VIX is the market volatility of the US S&P 500 index which gauges the global risk appetite in the financial market. \n2   Carry trades are speculative investment strategies in the foreign exchange market, where investors borrow low yielding \n(funding) currencies and invest in high yielding (investment) currencies. ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \nThe signal can be factors affecting the probability of default, such as the GDP growth rate or an exchange \nrate.3 Claessens and Pennacchi (1996) use a similar framework to price Mexican Brady bonds. Hui and \nLo (2002) price US dollar-denominated bonds sold by the Republic of Korea and Brazilian governments \nwith a model in which the nominal exchange rate signals default. Rocha and Alcaraz Garcia (2005) \npropose a similar model in which signaling for default depends on the real exchange rate, and apply the \nmodel to price Brazilian, Mexican, Russian, and Turkish sovereign bonds. While all of these models allow \nfor stochastic interest rates using mainly the Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross (CIR) model from 1985, the correlation \nbetween the signal and interest rates is assumed to be zero. The empirical studies of these models used \ndata from the 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis 1997\u20131998 occurred. \n \nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, capital inflows to emerging markets surged, \nand they have been volatile since then. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve lowered its policy \ninterest rate to the zero lower bound. The empirical results presented in this paper demonstrate that \nexchange  rates  and  US  interest  rates  were  significant  determinants  of  credit  spreads  on dollar-\ndenominated sovereign bonds of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and \nTurkey before the crisis, and remain so after. In view of such market development, this paper studies the \ndynamic linkage between US dollar-denominated sovereign bond prices and exchange rates in emerging \nmarkets by deriving a two-factor risky bond pricing model with closed-form solutions in which the \nexchange rate and the US risk-free interest rate are the underlying factors. The currency option-implied \nvolatility is used as the associated model parameter of the exchange rate to incorporate forward-looking \nmarket information into the model. \n \nIn the proposed model, a currency\u2019s exchange rate, i.e., the US dollar price of the local currency, \nis analogous to the stock price by using an analogy between corporate valuation and budget constraints \nfor an economy, as proposed by Sims (1999) and Cochrane (2005). The analogy assumes that the \nexchange rate adequately reflects country fundamentals anticipated in the market, similar to a firm\u2019s \nvalue measured by its stock price.4 The exchange rate in the proposed model is therefore structural in \nnature instead of being a signal used in the previous models. The proposed model incorporates two \nfeatures that differ from the previous models. First, the correlation between the exchange rate and risk-\nfree interest rate is explicitly incorporated into the model and its closed-form solutions. Therefore, their \ndynamic linkage which is absent in the previous models is fully reflected in the proposed model. Secondly, \nthe stochastic risk-free interest rate in the proposed model is assumed to follow the double square-root \n(DSR) process proposed by Longstaff (1989). One important characteristic of the DSR model is that it \nhas a nonlinear restoring force in its drift term such that the interest rate is sticky downward. It is \ntherefore particularly relevant to the low interest rate environment since the global financial crisis in \n2008, with the short-term interest rate tending to persist near the zero bound instead of moving back \ntoward  higher  rates  in  a  short  time  as  implied  by  the  CIR  model  and  Vasicek  (1977)  models \nconventionally used in risky bond pricing models.5 \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3   Moraux (2004) solves the model of Cathcart and El-Jahel (1998) in closed form. \n4   This is also consistent with the basic log linear model of the exchange rate on which most of the target-zone literature, such \nas Krugman (1991) is based for a small open economy. In the model, the exchange rate is equal to fundamentals plus a term \nproportional to the expected change in the log exchange rate. \n5   Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, developments took a dramatic turn and spilled over to \nother economies. During 2008, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) lowered the policy rate from 4% to 0\u20130.25% to provide \nmonetary support for the economy. Subsequently, it has taken unprecedented measures, including quantitative easing \npolicies that have lowered long-term borrowing costs and fostered economic activity. As the interest rate term structure \nwas affected by the Fed\u2019s ultra-accommodative monetary policy, the 3-month US Treasury bill yield has fallen to near zero \nfor an extended period. The 10-year Treasury yield has been falling and hit the historical low of 1.32% in July 2016, even \nafter the Fed raised the policy rate by 0.25% in December 2015. ", "Exchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated Sovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets   |   3 \nThe risky bond pricing model used in this paper follows a structural framework for pricing \ncorporate bonds proposed by Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974). In the Black\u2013Scholes\u2013\nMerton structural framework, the capital structure is explicitly considered and default happens if the \ntotal asset value is lower than the value of liabilities at the bond\u2019s maturity. Default risk is therefore \nequivalent to a European put option on a firm's asset value. From a microeconomic perspective, such \nstructural framework can be applied to price sovereign dollar-denominated bonds. A firm can be \nconsidered as an entity which issues two different classes of securities\u2014a single homogeneous debt \nconsisting of a zero-coupon bond and a residual claim, i.e., equity. In the balance sheet of the firm, the \ntotal value of its assets is equal to the sum of the values of a zero-coupon bond and equity. Under the \nModigliani and Miller (1958) proposition, corporate debt and equity sum to the present value of future \nearnings, and the firm\u2019s total asset value is independent of this capital structure decision. Sims (1999) \nand Cochrane (2005) propose an analogy between corporate valuation and budget constraints for an \neconomy. \n \nThe analogy is as follows. On the balance sheet of an economy, foreign and domestic debt sum \nto the present value of the future budget surplus. Foreign debt of the economy is the \u201cactual\u201d debt, while \ndomestic debt and fiat money act like equity in a firm. Given that the government promises only to pay \nthe domestic debt in local currency in the future, the function of domestic debt is to absorb fiscal risk by \nthe adjustment of its foreign currency (e.g., US dollar) equivalent value. In other words, solvency can be \nrestored through devaluation of nominal debt, created by currency depreciation. As long as there is \nsome probability that the government will run a primary surplus in the future and/or will repurchase \ndomestic currency debt, then such debt has value. Furthermore, the currency price, e.g., the US dollar \nprice of the local currency, is analogous to the stock price. Similar to a firm facing risk of insolvency as its \nequity value slumps when instability is anticipated in the economy, the currency devalues when volatility \nrises and the credit quality of the economy deteriorates. Assuming efficient markets, this analogy \nsuggests a positive linkage between sovereign foreign debt credit spreads and currency return/volatilities, \nanalogous to the linkage identified between corporate credit spreads and stock return/volatilities. The \nproposed risky bond pricing model, in which the exchange rate is the underlying factor, can therefore be \nconsidered as a semistructural approach. The focus here is to explore directly through the bond pricing \nmodel  the  extent  to  which  exchange  rate  dynamics  incorporated  with  option-implied  volatility \ndetermine dollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads.  \n \nFollowing the Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton\u2019s corporate bond pricing framework, subsequent studies \nextend the framework to incorporate a general default triggering mechanism which is considered as the \nfirst time the value of a firm\u2019s assets are lower than a default (constant or deterministic) barrier.6 \nApplying the above analogy between a firm and an economy, the US dollar price of local currency should \nindicate the credit quality of the economy, i.e., the ability to repay foreign debt. Similarly, a default barrier \nis associated with the currency value in the proposed semistructural model. As in the framework \ndeveloped by Duffie and Lando (2001), if the dynamics of the exchange rate are treated as a hazard rate \nprocess, which governs an inaccessible default stopping time, the proposed model can be recast as a \nspecial case of \u201creduced-form models.\u201d \n \nThe stochastic risk-free interest rate in the proposed model follows the DSR process. Some \nempirical findings support the DSR model. The empirical results in Longstaff (1989) suggest that, by \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6   To have more accurate measures of the default probability, subsequent studies mainly focus on the liability structure such \nthat models with more complex and dynamic liability structures including Jones, Mason, and Rosenfeld (1984); Leland and \nToft (1996); Longstaff and Schwartz (1995); Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001); and Hui, Lo, and Tsang (2003) have \nbeen developed. \n ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \nestimating the model parameters, the DSR model is more successful than the CIR model in capturing \nthe level and variation of 6- to 12-month Treasury bill yields during 1964\u20131986. The results also suggest \nthat yields are nonlinearly related to the risk-free interest rate, as the model implies. Similarly, the \nestimations of the DSR model parameters presented in section IV.A below show that data on the \nTreasury bill and notes during January 2000 to September 2014 could fit the model. Ahn, Dittmar, and \nGallant (2002) test the empirical performance of the quadratic term structure models, including the \nDSR model, in explaining historical bond price behavior in the US from December 1946 to February 1991. \nThey find the quadratic term structure models outperform the affine term structure models, including \nthe CIR and Vasicek models. Similar results are found by Leippold and Wu (2003), and Li and Zhao \n(2006). A\u00eft-Sahalia (1996) shows that there is evidence of nonlinearities in the drift function of the \ninterest rate term structure using a nonparametric approach. During the period of Japan\u2019s near-zero \nshort-term rates in 2001\u20132005, Kim and Singleton (2012) find that the quadratic dynamic term \nstructure models capture some of the key features of data on the Japanese Government Bond, including \nthe variation in bond yields, and bond risk premiums that are very small when the interest rate is low. \n \nThe following section examines the empirical relationship among the exchanges rates and US \ndollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads of emerging markets (including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, \nthe Philippines, the Russian Federation, and Turkey) and the US Treasury yields. Section III shows the \ndevelopment of the US dollar-denominated sovereign bond pricing model under a semistructural-\nmodel framework. Section IV shows a study of the credit spreads of the sample of emerging markets, \ncalculated from the model and then compared with actual market data. Section V concludes. \n \n \nII.  RELATIONSHIPS AMONG DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SOVEREIGN BOND SPREADS, \nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND UNITED STATES TREASURY YIELDS \n \nIn this section, an empirical test is conducted on dollar-denominated sovereign credit spreads in \nemerging markets, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and \nTurkey, to study their relationship with each country\u2019s exchange rate and the yields on US Treasuries. \nThese countries are selected because of their relatively liquid dollar-denominated bond markets. Daily \ndata are obtained on sovereign bond yields from 1 June 2003 to 29 September 2014. Based on data \navailability, the tenors of the bonds are as follows: Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey (10-year, 15-year, 20-year, \nand 30-year tenors); Colombia (10-year and 30-year tenors); the Philippines (10-year, 15-year, and 20-\nyear tenors); and the Russian Federation (15-year tenor). Bond credit spreads, which are the difference \nbetween bond yields and US Treasury yields with a corresponding tenor, are illustrated in Figure 1. The \ncredit spreads of sample countries declined from relatively high levels at the end of the regional financial \ncrises in 2003 but then surged during the global financial crisis in 2008.

Let \uf044CS  denote the change in the credit spread, \uf044Y denote the change in the Treasury yield and I \ndenote the change in the exchange rate of the corresponding country. The regression equation is given by: \n \n  \u0394(cid:1829)(cid:1845) (cid:3404) (cid:1853)(cid:3397)(cid:1854)\u0394(cid:1835)(cid:3397)(cid:1855)\u0394(cid:1851)(cid:3397)\u03b5  (1) \n \nwhere a, b, and c are regression coefficients. The descriptive statistics of the variables are reported in \nTable 1. Movements in the exchange rate of the sample of countries shown in Figure 2 are quite similar \nto changes in their sovereign bond spreads.  \n \nTable 2 reports the regression results. The coefficients b for all the countries are statistically \nsignificant at the 1% level and suggest a positive relationship between credit spreads and exchange rates. \nThis is consistent with the expected sign that credit spreads increase with weaker currencies (i.e., higher \nexchange rates per dollar). The magnitude of the estimates of b shows that the relation between credit \nspreads and interest rates is economically significant. For example, the regression results for Brazil imply \nthat a 0.1 rise in the USD/BRL exchange rate (which has the mean of 2.44 in the precrisis period) \nincreases the 30-year bond spread by 26 basis points in the precrisis period and 10 basis points in the \npostcrisis period. The difference between the effects of the exchange rate in the two periods is due to \nlower credit spreads in the postcrisis period (the mean of the credit spreads is 3.64% and 1.96% in the \nprecrisis and postcrisis periods as shown in Table 1). There are similar observations for the other \ncountries. The empirical results show a strong linkage between the sovereign credit spreads and \nexchange rates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \nTable 1: Summary Statistics on Sample Bonds, Exchange Rates, and Option-Implied Volatility \n \n  Max  Min Mean Standard Deviation\nBrazil  Precrisis  Postcrisis Precrisis Postcrisis Precrisis Postcrisis  Precrisis  Postcrisis\nBond spread 10Y (%)  8.8577  4.4195 0.9635 0.6473 3.5827 1.7503  1.9283  0.7182\nBond spread 15Y (%)  8.4530  4.2563 0.8996 0.7070 3.4004 1.8832  1.8107  0.6844\nBond spread 20Y (%)  8.7270  4.4560 0.8730 0.9810 3.5393 2.0319  1.8349  0.7148\nBond spread 30Y (%)  8.6911  3.9394 1.1196 0.6178 3.6430 1.9588  1.7895  0.7245\nExchange rate USD/BRL  3.2118  3.8415 1.7320 1.5387 2.4431 2.0954  0.4014  0.4282\nImplied volatility (%)  26.125  41.425 9.5000 9.0500 15.6212 17.6596  3.0692  4.9606\nMexico       \nBond spread 10Y (%)  2.3667  4.2861 0.6882 0.6349 1.3393 1.4691  0.3307  0.6967\nBond spread 15Y (%)  2.9160  3.9521 0.6916 0.3119 1.5674 1.5189  0.4808  0.6294\nBond spread 20Y (%)  2.6470  4.1130 0.9480 0.9880 1.6564 1.7462  0.3848  0.5078\nBond spread 30Y (%)  2.8581  4.2509 0.8760 0.8778 1.8034 1.6958  0.4330  0.5407\nExchange rate USD/MXN  11.664  17.201 10.247 11.493 10.987 13.216  0.2719  0.9856\nImplied volatility (%)  13.430  39.900 6.6503 7.2500 8.6008 15.237  1.2371  4.9398\nTurkey       \nBond spread 10Y (%)  7.5787  6.8843 1.5221 1.1503 3.1713 2.4952  1.2667  0.8759\nBond spread 15Y (%)  7.5601  6.1952 1.8266 1.5637 3.3764 2.7566  1.2055  0.7108\nBond spread 20Y (%)  3.5580  5.7610 1.7760 1.1170 2.4748 2.5389  0.4280  0.6876\nBond spread 30Y (%)  7.0480  6.5044 1.9971 1.0967 3.1377 2.5457  0.9674  0.8164\nExchange rate USD/TRY  1.7063  3.0305 1.1682 1.3944 1.3840 1.8587  0.0877  0.3512\nImplied volatility (%)  30.274  32.453 9.1150 6.5065 16.327 15.184  4.0406  4.3012\nColombia       \nBond spread 10Y (%)  6.5799  5.3527 0.9426 0.9568 2.9517 1.8914  1.3107  0.8027\nBond spread 20Y (%)    5.1400 1.3310 2.5187    0.6780\nBond spread 30Y (%)  6.3961  5.3048 1.1533 0.8428 3.4375 1.9067  1.2717  0.7755\nExchange rate USD/COL    2,904.6      3,259.0  1,874.2    1,748.0 2,410.3    1,995.3         261.5         263.4\nImplied volatility (%)  24.980  31.600 7.2789 7.0000 13.648 15.083  3.3262  5.4264\nPhilippines       \nBond spread 10Y (%)    3.3160 0.8343 1.6766    0.5018\nBond spread 15Y (%)  5.5588  5.6873 1.4410 0.9749 3.0935 2.2001  1.2251  0.7913\nBond spread 20Y (%)    2.8680 0.7480 1.6341    0.4185\nExchange rate USD/PHP  56.420  48.925 40.950 40.450 52.411 44.195  3.9561  1.9480\nImplied volatility (%)  12.680  22.201 4.6280 4.1127 7.7496 7.5778  1.6558  2.4954\nRussian Federation       \nBond spread 15Y (%)  3.9306  7.7536 0.8840 1.4204 2.0109 3.0320  0.7949  1.1416\nExchange rate USD/RUB  30.740  70.808 24.280 27.201 27.801 34.869  1.5546  9.1571\nImplied volatility (%)  11.000  76.556 2.4000 8.2126 6.4438 17.489  1.2677  10.410\nUnited States       \nTreasury yield 10Y (%)  5.2928  3.9859 3.1121 1.3875 4.4369 2.5855  0.3660  0.6400\nTreasury yield 15Y (%)  5.3664  4.3478 3.6211 1.7488 4.6777 2.9555  0.2968  0.6725\nTreasury yield 20Y (%)  5.6100  4.7500 4.1300 2.0400 4.9180 3.3237  0.2856  0.7137\nTreasury yield 30Y (%)  5.5606  4.8395 4.1730 2.2222 4.8515 3.5645  0.2783  0.6415\nShort term interest rate  5.7250  1.4213 1.0000 0.2229 3.5596 0.3725  1.7198  0.2209\nBRL = Brazilian real, COL = Colombian peso, MXN = Mexican peso, PHP = Philippine peso, RUB = Russian ruble, TRY = Turkish lira,  \nUSD = US dollar. \nNotes: The preglobal financial crisis period covers 1 June 2003 to 31 December 2007, while the postglobal financial crisis period is from 1 \nJanuary 2009 to 29 September 2014.

This finding supports the argument that \ninvestors, in particular risk-averse ones, sell risky assets (i.e., sovereign bonds in emerging markets) and \nbuy US Treasuries as safe-haven assets in stressed markets. The magnitude of the estimates of c shows \nthat the relation between credit spreads and US Treasury yields is economically significant. Regarding \nthe 10-year Brazilian bond, a 100-basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield decreases the \nBrazilian bond spread by 42 basis points in the precrisis period, and by 76 basis points in the postcrisis \nperiod. Similar effects are found for the other countries\u2019 sovereign bonds. Comparing the coefficients c \nin the two sample periods, the effects are generally stronger for the sample countries in the postcrisis \nperiod, reflecting a more important role of US Treasuries as safe-haven assets after the crisis. One \nexplanation is that during an extended period of low interest rates and volatility caused by the \naccommodative  monetary  policies  adopted  by  the  US  and  other  developed  economies,  market \nparticipants have displayed a tendency to seek higher returns by investing in securities that carry higher \ncredit risk such as emerging market sovereign bonds. This \u201csearch for yield\u201d behavior has caused \nsovereign bond spreads to be more sensitive to US Treasury yields in the postcrisis period.  \n \nThe estimated coefficients on exchange rates and Treasury yields suggest high explanatory \npower ranging from 0.2 to 0.71 (in terms of the adjusted R-squared) for the sample sovereign bonds. \nThis suggests that these two factors are adequate determinants of the countries\u2019 sovereign credit \nspreads. The empirical results support the view that the exchange rates of emerging market currencies \ncan be used as the state variable with adequate explanatory power in a semistructural model for pricing \ntheir own US dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. Comparing the adjusted R-squared in the two \nsample periods, the explanatory power of exchange rates in the postcrisis period (about 0.31\u20130.71) is \nstronger than that in the precrisis period (about 0.2\u20130.51). This indicates that the link between sovereign \ncredit spreads and the dynamics of the exchange rates and US interest rates has become stronger in the \npostcrisis period.  \n \n \nIII.

While the \nDSR model and the CIR model have a number of common empirically relevant characteristics, such as \nnegative interest rates being precluded and having a stationary distribution, the DSR model has two \nparticular features due to the nonlinear restoring force.9  First, only two parameters \uf06b  and \uf0732  are \nr r\nrequired to determine the interest rate dynamics. It is because \uf0712, which is the long-run interest rate, is \nr\na function of the other two parameters such that \uf0712 \uf03d\uf0734 /16\uf06b2.  \nr r r\n \nSecond, the interest rate is sticky downward under a positive market price of risk and some \nconditions of a negative market price of risk, as illustrated by Longstaff (1989).10  This feature is \nconsistent with an extraordinarily low interest rate environment when the short rate is sticky at \nmarginally above zero.

To make the pricing framework simple for analyzing the performance of the \nmodel, the drift \u03b1 is assumed to be zero.13 Given that the bond pricing model needs to capture forward-\ns\nlooking market information and currency crash risk, which affect credit spreads, use the 3-month \ncurrency option-implied volatility of the 25-delta out-of-the-money call (US dollar) for volatility \u03c3, \ns\nillustrated in Figure 2.14 While the option-implied volatilities of the currencies surged during the crisis in \n2008, as expected, they also varied substantially during other times, in particular in the postcrisis period. \nThe sensitivity of dollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads to exchange rate risk anticipated by \nmarket participants is incorporated into the model through the parameter of the exchange rate volatility. \nCurrency option markets have the desirable property of being forward looking in nature and are thus \nuseful for gauging market sentiment about future exchange rates. Market sentiment of the \u201ccrash risk\u201d \nof a currency can be inferred from its out-of-the-money option-implied volatility, which is consistent \nwith a number of recent studies on currency crashes using information on currency option prices, \nincluding Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2009); Farhi et al.

The values of the model \nparameters \u03ba, \u03c3, and \u03bb of the DSR interest rate model are shown in Table 3. The DSR model parameters \nr r r\nare estimated by using Hansen\u2019s (1982) generalized method of moments technique which is also used \nby Longstaff (1989) for the estimation of the DSR term structure model.16 The estimations are using \nmonth-end zero-coupon yield to maturity data of 3-month, 12-month and 10-year US Treasury bills and \nnotes during January 2000 to September 2014. The daily correlation \u03c1  is estimated by the dynamic \nSr\nconditional correlation multivariate GARCH model proposed by Engle and Sheppard (2001).

Given that \nthe calibrated barriers are higher than the reference barrier, the model credit spreads obtained from the \ncalibrated barriers are lower than those obtained from the reference barrier and closer to the market \ncredit spreads as expected. The trend in the model credit spreads generated from the different default \nbarriers are qualitatively similar, indicating that the default barriers affect mainly the level of the spreads. \nCorrelations between the market and model credit spreads of the bonds with different tenors are \nreported in Table 5. The high positive correlations in level (higher than 0.8) and in log change (between \n0.3 and 0.54) are consistent with the observations in Panels A and B of Figure 3.  \n \nRegarding the Mexican sovereign bond in Panel C, the model credit spreads based on the \ncalibrated and reference default barriers have similar trends in the market credit spreads in the precrisis \nperiod. For example, both the market and model spreads jumped in mid-2006 and mid-2007. The \ncorrelations between their spreads at different tenors are above 0.4 in level and 0.28 in log change. \nDuring the postcrisis period, as shown in Panel C, the model credit spreads generated from the calibrated \nbarriers are quite close to the market credit spreads with the correlations for different tenors above 0.65 \nin level and 0.21 in log change.  \n \nWhile the model credit spreads based on the reference barrier are higher than the market values, \ntheir changes broadly follow those of the market and model (based on the calibrated barrier) credit \nspreads, as indicated by the high positive correlations in level and log change. The results demonstrate \nthat the calibrated and reference default barriers determine the levels of the bond spreads but in general \ndo not affect their changes substantially. \n \nPanel E in Figure 3 shows that the market and model spreads of the 15-year Turkish sovereign \nbond are quite close to each other during 2004 and 2005 but substantially different in 2003 and 2006. \nTherefore, their correlations shown in Table 5 are lower than those of the Brazilian and Mexican \nsovereign bonds in the precrisis period. Similar to the Mexican sovereign bond, the model spreads with \nthe reference barrier are higher than the market spreads and model spreads with the calibrated barriers \nin the postcrisis period (see Panel F). Regarding the 10-year Colombian sovereign bond in Panels G and \nH, the model spreads with the calibrated barriers broadly track the market spreads in particular in the \npostcrisis period with high correlations in levels.  \n \nThe tracking performance of the model spreads with the reference barrier is also better in the \npostcrisis period. The model spreads of the 15-year Philippine sovereign bond shown in Panels I and J \nexhibit similar movements of the market spreads with quite high positive correlations among the bonds \nwith different tenors. Panel K shows that the model spreads of the 15-year Russian sovereign bond do \nnot fit the market spreads well in the precrisis period. The tracking performance however improves \nsignificantly in the postcrisis period as shown in Panel L, and the correlations between the model and \nmarket spreads increase accordingly.  \n \nIn summary, the comparison between the market and model credit spreads of the sovereign \nbonds of Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Colombia, the Philippines, and the Russian Federation (as illustrated in \nFigure 3 and their correlations in Table 5) show that the proposed model can generate credit spreads \nwhich track the changes of the market credit spreads. The results are consistent with the regression \nresults in section II that exchange rates in the emerging markets are related to their sovereign credit \nspreads. The calibrated and reference default barriers used in the model mainly shift the levels of model \nspreads but do not make their changes different materially.

are about 72\u2013263 bps (with the aggregate of 162 bps) and 32\u2013116 bps (with the aggregate of 103 \nbps) for different tenors in the precrisis and postcrisis periods, respectively. The corresponding absolute \npercentage errors are 18%\u201334% (with the aggregate of 21%) and 17%\u201329% (with the aggregate of 24%). \nUsing the calibrated barriers, the RMS errors drop to the ranges of 56\u201381 bps (with the aggregate of 69 \nbps) and 32\u201351 bps (with the aggregate of 39 bps) in the precrisis and postcrisis periods, respectively. \nThe corresponding absolute percentage errors are in the ranges of 13%\u201326% (with the aggregate of 17%) \nand 15%\u201334% (with the aggregate of 23%).  \n \nThe results show that the RMS errors are smaller in the postcrisis period than in the precrisis \nperiod. However, the absolute percentage errors are larger in the postcrisis period, indicating that the \ndifferences in the RMS errors are mainly due to credit spreads in the postcrisis period (with the mean \nabout 2%) being lower than in the precrisis period (with the mean about 3.5%) as shown in Table 1. As ", "Exchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated Sovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets   |   23 \nexpected, the performance of the model based on the calibrated barriers is better than that based on \nthe reference barrier. However, if the ranges and aggregates of errors for the two types of barriers in the \npostcrisis period are compared, the use of the calibrated barriers does not substantially outperform \ncompared with the reference barrier. The percentage errors indicate that the model with the calibrated \nbarrier tends to generate lower credit spreads in both the precrisis and postcrisis periods, at \u20132.6% and \n\u20136.2% in aggregate. While the magnitudes are smaller than the standard deviations, this indicates a \nmarginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the model for the pricing of the bond spreads (prices). \n \nFor Mexican sovereign bonds, the RMS errors with the reference barrier are in the ranges of 58\u2013\n89 bps (with the aggregate of 69 bps) and 89\u2013444 bps (with the aggregate of 279 bps) in the precrisis \nand postcrisis periods, respectively. The corresponding absolute percentage errors are 28%\u201346% (with \nthe aggregate of 37%) and 56%\u2013312% (with the aggregate of 171%). The poorer performance of the \nmodel in the postcrisis period reflects that the reference barrier is very different from the level of the \nexchange rate triggering default. Using the calibrated barriers, the RMS errors in the precrisis and \npostcrisis periods drop to 38\u201345 bps (with the aggregate of 42 bps) and 38\u201360 bps (with the aggregate \nof 50 bps), respectively. The corresponding absolute percentage errors fall in the ranges of 15%\u201325% \n(with the aggregate of 21%) and 17%\u201337% (with the aggregate of 27%). The performance of the model \nfor Mexican sovereign bonds is not very different in the precrisis and postcrisis periods, while the \nmagnitudes of their errors are similar to those of Brazilian sovereign bonds. In addition, the aggregate \npercentage errors indicate that the model with the calibrated barriers tends to generate lower credit \nspreads in the postcrisis period, but the error magnitude of \u20133.7% is lower than that of Brazilian bonds. \n \nThe performance results for the sovereign bonds of Turkey, Colombia, the Philippines, and the \nRussian Federation are qualitatively similar to those for Brazil and Mexico in general. Using the calibrated \nbarriers, their aggregate absolute percentage errors are in the range of 16%\u201332% and 19%\u201335% in the \nprecrisis and postcrisis periods, respectively. The errors are not much different from those for Brazil (17% \nand 23%) and Mexico (21% and 27%). Their percentage errors using the calibrated barriers are mostly \nnegative, in the range of \u201314.7%\u20130.3%, reflecting a marginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the \nmodel for the pricing of bond spreads (prices) particularly in the postcrisis period. The generally poorer \nperformance of the model using the reference barriers (in particular, for Turkey in the postcrisis period) \ndemonstrates that the performance is sensitive to the setting of the default barriers. \n \nFor a broad assessment of the performance of the proposed model for pricing sovereign bonds, \nits pricing errors are compared with those of the structural models for corporate bonds. Eom, Helwege, \nand  Huang  (2004)  empirically  test  five  structural  models  of  corporate  bond  pricing  which  are \nconsidered typical, including those of Merton (1974), Geske (1977), Longstaff and Schwartz (1995), \nLeland and Toft (1996), and Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001). They implement the models using \na sample of 182 bond prices from firms with simple capital structures during 1986\u20131997. The mean \nabsolute percentage errors of model credit spreads in the study are 78% for the Merton model, 66% for \nthe Geske model, 97% for the Longstaff\u2013Schwartz model, 146% for the Leland\u2013Toft model, and 170% \nfor the Collin-Dufresne\u2013Goldstein model. While pricing sovereign and corporate bonds based on the \nstructural approach produces different pricing errors, the performance of the proposed sovereign bond \npricing model is no worse than that of the structural models for pricing corporate bonds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \nV.  CONCLUSIONS \n \nUsing data on emerging markets, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Philippines, the Russian \nFederation, and Turkey, before and after the global financial crisis, the empirical results show that the \nexchange rates of their currencies have adequate power to explain their US dollar-denominated \nsovereign bond prices, particularly in the postcrisis period. Based on an analogy between an economy\u2019s \ncurrency price and a firm\u2019s stock price, this paper develops a two-factor pricing model in closed-form \nsolutions for the sovereign bonds with default at or prior to maturity (i.e., a default barrier), in which the \ncorrelated factors are foreign exchange rates and US risk-free interest rates that follow a double square-\nroot process relevant in the low interest rate environment. To incorporate forward-looking market \ninformation into the model, the currency option-implied volatility is used as the associated model \nparameter of the exchange rate.  \n \nUsing US dollar-denominated sovereign bonds with different tenors, the numerical results from \nthe closed-form solution with default prior to maturity show that the credit spreads generated from the \npricing model broadly track changes in market credit spreads in both the precrisis and postcrisis periods. \nThe correlations between them are positive and high especially when the calibrated default barriers are \nused for pricing the bonds. The corresponding absolute percentage errors vary among the bonds. For \nexample, the aggregate absolute percentage errors for Brazil in the precrisis and postcrisis periods are \n17% and 23%, respectively, while those for Turkey are 27% and 35%. The percentage errors show a \nmarginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the model for pricing bond spreads (prices) particularly \nin the postcrisis period. The magnitude of the errors is lower than that of conventional structural models \nfor the pricing of corporate bonds. The numerical results are consistent with the empirical results that \nthe exchange rate dynamics of the emerging market currencies are significantly related to their sovereign \ncredit spreads. \n \nThe results support the findings of a strong relationship between emerging markets\u2019 sovereign \nrisk and exchange rate stability in the literature on international finance and studies about twin sovereign \ndebt and currency crises. This paper\u2019s findings suggest that dollar-denominated sovereign bonds are \ndirectly influenced by exchange rate dynamics. This suggests that both governments and investors might \nbe better served by issuing debt in local currency, and letting investors hedge these risks in currency \nmarkets. \n \nGiven that the model simply captures the contributions due to exchange rate dynamics, future \nresearch could develop multifactor models augmented to allow for the possible sensitivity of bond credit \nspreads  to  exchange  rates  and  their  volatility,  and  to  depend  on  observable  country-specific  or \nmacroeconomic variables, such as foreign reserves, which affect sovereign risk.  \n \n \n ", " \nAPPENDIX: DERIVATION \n \nIt is not difficult to show by direct substitution that P\uf025\uf028x,y,\uf074\uf029  satisfies the partial differential \nequation: \n \n~ ~ ~ ~\n\uf0b6P 1 \uf0b62P ~ \uf0b62P 1 ~ \uf0b62P\n= \uf0732 \uf02b\uf072 \uf073\uf073 \uf02b \uf0732\n\uf0b6\uf074 2 S \uf0b6y2 Sr S r \uf0b6x\uf0b6y 2 r \uf0b6x2\n~\n  \uf02b\uf0ed\uf0ec 1 \uf072 \uf073\uf073~ C\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf02b\uf072 \uf073\uf073~ B\uf028\uf074\uf029x\uf02b\uf061\uf0fd\uf0fc\uf0b6P   (A.1) \n\uf0ee 2 Sr S r Sr S r \uf0fe \uf0b6y\n~\n\uf02b\uf0ed\uf0ec 1 \uf073~2C\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf02d\uf06b~ \uf02d\uf05b\uf06c \uf02d\uf073~2B\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf05dx\uf0fd\uf0fc\uf0b6P\n\uf0ee 2 r r r r \uf0fe \uf0b6x\n \nto eliminate all the terms involving first derivatives with respect to x and y, rewrite P\uf025\uf028x,y,\uf074\uf029 as: \n \n~ \uf0ec \uf0b6 \uf0fc \uf0ec \uf0b6 \uf0fc \uf0ec \uf0b6 \uf0fc\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\nP x,y,\uf074 =exp\uf0ed\uf07a\uf074x \uf0fdexp\uf0ed\uf078\uf074 y \uf0fdexp\uf0ed\uf077\uf074x \uf0fd\uf0b4\n\uf0ee \uf0b6x\uf0fe \uf0ee \uf0b6y\uf0fe \uf0ee \uf0b6y\uf0fe\n\uf0ec \uf0b6 \uf0fc \uf0ec \uf0b6 \uf0fc\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n  exp\uf0ed\uf057 \uf074 \uf0fdexp\uf0ed\uf057 \uf074 \uf0fdQ x,y,\uf074   (A.2) \n\uf0ee 1 \uf0b6x\uf0fe \uf0ee 2 \uf0b6y\uf0fe\n\uf028 \uf07b \uf028 \uf029\uf07d \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf028 \uf029\uf07d \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf028 \uf029\uf07d \uf028 \uf029 \uf029\n=Q exp\uf07a\uf074 x\uf02b\uf057 \uf074,exp\uf078\uf074 y\uf02b\uf077\uf074 exp\uf07a\uf074 x\uf02b\uf057 \uf074,\uf074\n1 2\n \nwhere: \n \n1 1\uf02dC\n  \uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029= \uf067\uf074\uf02bln 0  \n\uf028 \uf029\n2 1\uf02dC exp\uf067\uf074\n0\n  \uf077\uf028\uf074\uf029=\uf072\uf073\uf073~ \uf0f2\uf074B\uf028\uf074'\uf029exp\uf07b\uf02d\uf07a\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf07dd\uf074' \nSr S r\n0\n  \uf057 \uf028\uf074\uf029= \uf0f2\uf074\uf0e9 1 \uf073~2C\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf02d\uf06b~ \uf0f9exp\uf07b\uf07a\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf07dd\uf074' \n1 \uf0ea r r\uf0fa\n0\uf0eb 2 \uf0fb\n\uf057 \uf028\uf074\uf029=\uf0f2\uf074\uf0e9 1 \uf072\uf073\uf073\uf025 C\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf02b\uf061\uf025\uf0f9d\uf074'\n2 \uf0ea Sr S r \uf0fa\n0 \uf0eb 2 \uf0fb\n   \n\uf02b\uf0f2\uf074\uf0e9 1 \uf073\uf0252C\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf02d\uf06b\uf025 \uf0f9\uf077\uf028\uf074'\uf029exp\uf07b\uf07a\uf028\uf074'\uf029\uf07dd\uf074'\n\uf0ea r r\uf0fa\n0 \uf0eb 2 \uf0fb\nThen substituting equation (A.2) into equation (A.1), it can be shown that Q\uf028x,y,\uf074\uf029 satisfies the \ntwo-dimensional diffusion equation: \n \n\uf0b6Q 1 \uf0b62Q \uf0b62Q 1 \uf0b62Q\n  = \uf0732\uf028\uf074\uf029 \uf02b\uf072 \uf028\uf074\uf029\uf073\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf073 \uf028\uf074\uf029 \uf02b \uf0732\uf028\uf074\uf029   (A.3) \n\uf0b6\uf074 2 x \uf0b6x2 xy x y \uf0b6x\uf0b6y 2 y \uf0b6y2\n \n ", "26   |   Appendix \n \nwhere \n \n  \uf0732\uf028\uf074\uf029=\uf073~2 exp\uf07b2\uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf07d \nx r\n  \uf0732\uf028\uf074\uf029=\uf073~2\uf0772\uf028\uf074\uf029exp\uf07b2\uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf07d\uf02b\uf0732 \uf02b2\uf072\uf073\uf073~\uf077\uf028\uf074\uf029exp\uf07b\uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf07d \ny r S Sr S r\n  \uf072 \uf028\uf074\uf029\uf073\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf073 \uf028\uf074\uf029=\uf072\uf073\uf073\uf025 exp\uf07b\uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf07d\uf02b\uf073\uf0252\uf077\uf028\uf074\uf029exp\uf07b2\uf07a\uf028\uf074\uf029\uf07d  \nxy x y Sr S r r\n \nIt should be noted that since the final payoff condition is independent of the interest rate  r  (or \nequivalently x ), i.e., P\uf028S,r,0\uf029  is a function of S  only, it is obvious that Q\uf028x,y,0\uf029  does not depend \nupon x.
