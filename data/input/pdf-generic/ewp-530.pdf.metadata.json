A \ntwo-factor  pricing  model  is  developed  with  closed-form  solutions  for  the  sovereign  bonds.  The \ncorrelated factors in the model are foreign exchange rates and US risk-free interest rates that follow a \ndouble  square-root  process  relevant  in  a  low  interest  rate  environment.  The  numerical  results  and \nassociated error analysis show that the model credit spreads can broadly track market credit spreads. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: bond pricing model, emerging markets, exchange rates, sovereign risk \n \nJEL codes: G13, G21, G28 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI.  \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nThe relationship between sovereign risk and exchange rate stability has long been a subject of interest in \ninternational finance. Papers on the subject include Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996); Frankel and \nRose (1996); Kaminsky, Lizondo, and Reinhart (1998); and Kumar, Moorthy, and Perraudin (2003), who \nuse  macroeconomic  indicators  to  estimate  the  probability  of  currency  crashes.  On  the  empirical  side, \nReinhart  (2002),  finds  that  84%  of  the  defaults  in  her  emerging  markets  sample  are  connected  with \ncurrency crises and almost half of the currency crises in the sample are related to defaults. Herz and Tong \n(2008) find that 32% of all debt crises in emerging markets are linked to currency crises, while 20% of \ncurrency  crises  are  associated  with  debt  crises.  Dreher,  Herz,  and  Karb  (2006)  study  the  empirical \nrelationship between currency and sovereign debt crises, covering 80 countries over 1975\u20132000, and find \nthat currency crisis is more likely to occur when there is a contemporaneous debt crisis, and vice versa. \nEmpirically, twin debt and currency crises occur more frequently than twin banking and currency crises.  \n \n\nThe  dynamic  linkage  between  sovereign  credit  risk  and  exchange  rates  has  been  studied  for \nemerging markets. Carr and Wu (2007) investigate the connection between currency option-implied \nvolatilities and sovereign creditworthiness for Mexico and Brazil from 2002 to 2005. They find that the \nlevel and skew of the option-implied volatility display significant comovement with the sovereign credit-\ndefault swap (CDS) spreads of the two countries. Pan and Singleton (2008) explore the term structure \nof CDS spreads for Mexico, Turkey, and the Republic of Korea from 2001 to 2006 and consider the risk-\nneutral credit event intensities and loss rates that best describe the CDS data. Their results suggest that \ncurrency option volatilities may have served as a proxy for the fundamental macroeconomic and event \nrisks embodied in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX).1 Pavlova and de Boyrie (2015) find information flows \nbetween  currency  carry-trade  returns  of  nine  economies  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  and  changes  in  the \nMarkit iTraxx SovX Asia Pacific index from 2008 to 2011, which are negatively correlated.2 \n\n \nWhile sovereign risk and exchange rate stability have been studied in the context of sovereign \ndebt crises, the literature on the empirical determinants of sovereign bond yield spreads usually focus \non variables other than exchange rates. Some papers, including Edwards (1986), Eichengreen and Mody \n(2000), Min (1998), Beck (2001), and Ferrucci (2003), concentrate on reduced form regressions of \nspreads on a large set of macroeconomic variables. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, \nand  United  States  (US)  Treasury  yields  are  found  to  be  important  explanatory  variables.  Duffie, \nPedersen, and Singleton (2003) develop a flexible reduced form model of sovereign yield spreads. They \nestimate  their  model  using  weekly  data  on  Russian  dollar-denominated  debt  and  US  swap  yields \nbetween  1994  and  1998.  The  study  relates  spreads  implied  by  the  model  to  political  factors,  foreign \nexchange reserves, oil prices, and the VIX. Longstaff et al. (2011) demonstrate that US stock and bond \nmarket  returns,  and  global  volatility,  can  explain  much  of  the  variation  in  sovereign  CDS  spreads. \nHilscher and Nosbusch (2010) investigate the effects of macroeconomic fundamentals on emerging \nmarket sovereign credit spreads and find that terms of trade volatility in particular has a statistically and \neconomically significant effect on spreads. Jeanneret (2015) proposes a model which generates daily \nsovereign credit spreads using expected economic conditions, which are structurally extracted from the \nlocal stock market. \n\n \n\nTo price sovereign risky bonds based on exchange rate dynamics, Cathcart and El-Jahel (1998) \npropose a model in which default occurs when some signaling process hits a constant default barrier. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   VIX is the market volatility of the US S&P 500 index which gauges the global risk appetite in the financial market. \n2   Carry  trades  are  speculative  investment  strategies  in  the  foreign  exchange  market,  where  investors  borrow  low  yielding \n\n(funding) currencies and invest in high yielding (investment) currencies. \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nThe signal can be factors affecting the probability of default, such as the GDP growth rate or an exchange \nrate.3 Claessens and Pennacchi (1996) use a similar framework to price Mexican Brady bonds. Hui and \nLo (2002) price US dollar-denominated bonds sold by the Republic of Korea and Brazilian governments \nwith  a  model  in  which  the  nominal  exchange  rate  signals  default.  Rocha  and  Alcaraz  Garcia  (2005) \npropose a similar model in which signaling for default depends on the real exchange rate, and apply the \nmodel to price Brazilian, Mexican, Russian, and Turkish sovereign bonds. While all of these models allow \nfor stochastic interest rates using mainly the Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross (CIR) model from 1985, the correlation \nbetween the signal and interest rates is assumed to be zero. The empirical studies of these models used \ndata from the 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis 1997\u20131998 occurred. \n\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, capital inflows to emerging markets surged, \nand they have been volatile since then. At the same time, the US Federal  Reserve lowered its policy \ninterest rate to the zero lower bound. The empirical results presented in this paper demonstrate that \nexchange  rates  and  US  interest  rates  were  significant  determinants  of  credit  spreads  on dollar-\ndenominated sovereign bonds of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, and \nTurkey before the crisis, and remain so after. In view of such market development, this paper studies the \ndynamic linkage between US dollar-denominated sovereign bond prices and exchange rates in emerging \nmarkets  by  deriving  a  two-factor  risky  bond  pricing  model  with  closed-form  solutions  in  which  the \nexchange rate and the US risk-free interest rate are the underlying factors. The currency option-implied \nvolatility is used as the associated model parameter of the exchange rate to incorporate forward-looking \nmarket information into the model. \n\n \nIn the proposed model, a currency\u2019s exchange rate, i.e., the US dollar price of the local currency, \nis analogous to the stock price by using an analogy between corporate valuation and budget constraints \nfor  an  economy,  as  proposed  by  Sims  (1999)  and  Cochrane  (2005).  The  analogy  assumes  that  the \nexchange rate adequately reflects country fundamentals anticipated in the market, similar to a firm\u2019s \nvalue measured by its stock price.4 The exchange rate in the proposed model is therefore structural in \nnature  instead  of  being  a  signal  used  in  the  previous  models.  The  proposed  model  incorporates  two \nfeatures that differ from the previous models. First, the correlation between the exchange rate and risk-\nfree interest rate is explicitly incorporated into the model and its closed-form solutions. Therefore, their \ndynamic linkage which is absent in the previous models is fully reflected in the proposed model. Secondly, \nthe stochastic risk-free interest rate in the proposed model is assumed to follow the double square-root \n(DSR) process proposed by Longstaff (1989). One important characteristic of the DSR model is that it \nhas  a  nonlinear  restoring  force  in  its  drift  term  such  that  the  interest  rate  is  sticky  downward.  It  is \ntherefore particularly  relevant to the low interest  rate environment since the global financial crisis in \n2008, with the short-term interest rate tending to persist near the zero bound instead of moving back \ntoward  higher  rates  in  a  short  time  as  implied  by  the  CIR  model  and  Vasicek  (1977)  models \nconventionally used in risky bond pricing models.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3   Moraux (2004) solves the model of Cathcart and El-Jahel (1998) in closed form. \n4   This is also consistent with the basic log linear model of the exchange rate on which most of the target-zone literature, such \nas Krugman (1991) is based for a small open economy. In the model, the exchange rate is equal to fundamentals plus a term \nproportional to the expected change in the log exchange rate. \n\n5   Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, developments took a dramatic turn and spilled over to \nother  economies.  During  2008,  the  US  Federal  Reserve  (Fed)  lowered  the  policy  rate  from  4%  to  0\u20130.25%  to  provide \nmonetary  support  for  the  economy.  Subsequently,  it  has  taken  unprecedented  measures,  including  quantitative  easing \npolicies that have lowered long-term borrowing costs and fostered economic activity. As the interest rate term structure \nwas affected by the Fed\u2019s ultra-accommodative monetary policy, the 3-month US Treasury bill yield has fallen to near zero \nfor an extended period. The 10-year Treasury yield has been falling and hit the historical low of 1.32% in July 2016, even \nafter the Fed raised the policy rate by 0.25% in December 2015. \n\n\fExchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated Sovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets   |   3 \n\nThe  risky  bond  pricing  model  used  in  this  paper  follows  a  structural  framework  for  pricing \ncorporate  bonds  proposed  by  Black  and  Scholes  (1973)  and  Merton  (1974).  In  the  Black\u2013Scholes\u2013\nMerton structural framework, the capital structure is explicitly considered and default happens if the \ntotal  asset  value  is  lower  than  the  value  of  liabilities  at  the  bond\u2019s  maturity.  Default  risk  is  therefore \nequivalent to a European put option on a firm's asset value. From a microeconomic perspective, such \nstructural  framework  can  be  applied  to  price  sovereign  dollar-denominated  bonds.  A  firm  can  be \nconsidered  as  an  entity  which  issues  two  different  classes  of  securities\u2014a  single  homogeneous  debt \nconsisting of a zero-coupon bond and a residual claim, i.e., equity. In the balance sheet of the firm, the \ntotal value of its assets is equal to the sum of the values of a zero-coupon bond and equity. Under the \nModigliani and Miller (1958) proposition, corporate debt and equity sum to the present value of future \nearnings, and the firm\u2019s total asset value is independent of this capital structure decision. Sims (1999) \nand Cochrane (2005) propose an analogy between corporate valuation and budget constraints for an \neconomy. \n\n \nThe analogy is as follows. On the balance sheet of an economy, foreign and domestic debt sum \nto the present value of the future budget surplus. Foreign debt of the economy is the \u201cactual\u201d debt, while \ndomestic debt and fiat money act like equity in a firm. Given that the government promises only to pay \nthe domestic debt in local currency in the future, the function of domestic debt is to absorb fiscal risk by \nthe adjustment of its foreign currency (e.g., US dollar) equivalent value. In other words, solvency can be \nrestored  through  devaluation  of  nominal  debt,  created  by  currency  depreciation.  As  long  as  there  is \nsome  probability  that  the  government  will  run  a  primary  surplus  in  the  future  and/or  will  repurchase \ndomestic currency debt, then such debt has value. Furthermore, the currency price, e.g., the US dollar \nprice of the local currency, is analogous to the stock price. Similar to a firm facing risk of insolvency as its \nequity value slumps when instability is anticipated in the economy, the currency devalues when volatility \nrises  and  the  credit  quality  of  the  economy  deteriorates.  Assuming  efficient  markets,  this  analogy \nsuggests a positive linkage between sovereign foreign debt credit spreads and currency return/volatilities, \nanalogous to the linkage identified between corporate credit spreads and stock return/volatilities. The \nproposed risky bond pricing model, in which the exchange rate is the underlying factor, can therefore be \nconsidered as a semistructural approach. The focus here is to explore directly through the bond pricing \nmodel  the  extent  to  which  exchange  rate  dynamics  incorporated  with  option-implied  volatility \ndetermine dollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads.  \n\n \nFollowing the Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton\u2019s corporate bond pricing framework, subsequent studies \nextend the framework to incorporate a general default triggering mechanism which is considered as the \nfirst  time  the  value  of  a  firm\u2019s  assets  are  lower  than  a  default  (constant  or  deterministic)  barrier. 6 \nApplying the above analogy between a firm and an economy, the US dollar price of local currency should \nindicate the credit quality of the economy, i.e., the ability to repay foreign debt. Similarly, a default barrier \nis  associated  with  the  currency  value  in  the  proposed  semistructural  model.  As  in  the  framework \ndeveloped by Duffie and Lando (2001), if the dynamics of the exchange rate are treated as a hazard rate \nprocess, which governs an inaccessible default stopping time, the proposed model can be recast as a \nspecial case of \u201creduced-form models.\u201d \n \n\nThe  stochastic  risk-free  interest  rate  in  the  proposed  model  follows  the  DSR  process.  Some \nempirical findings support the DSR model. The empirical results in Longstaff (1989) suggest that, by \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6   To have more accurate measures of the default probability, subsequent studies mainly focus on the liability structure such \nthat models with more complex and dynamic liability structures including Jones, Mason, and Rosenfeld (1984); Leland and \nToft (1996); Longstaff and Schwartz (1995); Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001); and Hui, Lo, and Tsang (2003) have \nbeen developed. \n\n \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nestimating the model parameters, the DSR model is more successful than the CIR model in capturing \nthe level and variation of 6- to 12-month Treasury bill yields during 1964\u20131986. The results also suggest \nthat  yields  are  nonlinearly  related  to  the  risk-free  interest  rate,  as  the  model  implies.  Similarly,  the \nestimations  of  the  DSR  model  parameters  presented  in  section  IV.A  below  show  that  data  on  the \nTreasury bill and notes during January 2000 to September 2014 could fit the model. Ahn, Dittmar, and \nGallant (2002) test the empirical performance of the quadratic term structure models, including the \nDSR model, in explaining historical bond price behavior in the US from December 1946 to February 1991. \nThey find the quadratic term structure models outperform the affine term structure models, including \nthe CIR and Vasicek models. Similar results are found by Leippold and Wu (2003), and Li and Zhao \n(2006).  A\u00eft-Sahalia  (1996)  shows  that  there  is  evidence  of  nonlinearities  in  the  drift  function  of  the \ninterest  rate  term  structure  using  a  nonparametric  approach.  During  the  period  of  Japan\u2019s  near-zero \nshort-term  rates  in  2001\u20132005,  Kim  and  Singleton  (2012)  find  that  the  quadratic  dynamic  term \nstructure models capture some of the key features of data on the Japanese Government Bond, including \nthe variation in bond yields, and bond risk premiums that are very small when the interest rate is low. \n \n\nThe  following  section  examines  the  empirical  relationship  among  the  exchanges  rates  and  US \ndollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads of emerging markets (including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, \nthe Philippines, the Russian Federation, and Turkey) and the US Treasury yields. Section III shows the \ndevelopment  of  the  US  dollar-denominated  sovereign  bond  pricing  model  under  a semistructural-\nmodel framework. Section IV shows a study of the credit spreads of the sample of emerging markets, \ncalculated from the model and then compared with actual market data. Section V concludes. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRELATIONSHIPS AMONG DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SOVEREIGN BOND SPREADS, \n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND UNITED STATES TREASURY YIELDS \n \nIn  this  section,  an  empirical  test  is  conducted  on  dollar-denominated  sovereign  credit  spreads  in \nemerging  markets,  including  Brazil,  Colombia,  Mexico,  the  Philippines,  the  Russian  Federation,  and \nTurkey, to study their relationship with each country\u2019s exchange rate and the yields on US Treasuries. \nThese countries are selected because of their relatively liquid dollar-denominated bond markets. Daily \ndata are obtained on sovereign bond yields from 1 June 2003 to 29 September 2014. Based on data \navailability, the tenors of the bonds are as follows: Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey (10-year, 15-year, 20-year, \nand 30-year tenors); Colombia (10-year and 30-year tenors); the Philippines (10-year, 15-year, and 20-\nyear tenors); and the Russian Federation (15-year tenor). Bond credit spreads, which are the difference \nbetween bond yields and US Treasury yields with a corresponding tenor, are illustrated in Figure 1. The \ncredit spreads of sample countries declined from relatively high levels at the end of the regional financial \ncrises  in  2003  but  then  surged  during  the  global  financial  crisis  in  2008.  They  subsequently  fell \nsubstantially in 2009 and then were traded in the range of about 0.5%\u20134%. Given the illiquid sovereign \nbond markets during the global financial crisis in 2008 and the structural differences before and after \nthe onset of the crisis, the sample is split into two periods. The first period is from 1 June 2003 to 31 \nDecember  2007  (i.e.,  precrisis),  and  the  second  is  from  1  January  2009  to  29  September  2014  (i.e., \npostcrisis).7  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7   The data are from Bloomberg.

Let  CS\uf044\ndenote the change in the exchange rate of the corresponding country. The regression equation is given by: \n \n \n \nwhere a, b, and c are regression coefficients. The descriptive statistics of the variables are reported in \nTable 1. Movements in the exchange rate of the sample of countries shown in Figure 2 are quite similar \nto changes in their sovereign bond spreads.  \n \n\n\u0394(cid:1829)(cid:1845) (cid:3404) (cid:1853) (cid:3397) (cid:1854)\u0394(cid:1835) (cid:3397) (cid:1855)\u0394(cid:1851) (cid:3397) \u03b5 \n\n(1) \n\nTable  2  reports  the  regression  results.  The  coefficients  b  for  all  the  countries  are  statistically \nsignificant at the 1% level and suggest a positive relationship between credit spreads and exchange rates. \nThis is consistent with the expected sign that credit spreads increase with weaker currencies (i.e., higher \nexchange rates per dollar). The magnitude of the estimates of b shows that the relation between credit \nspreads and interest rates is economically significant. For example, the regression results for Brazil imply \nthat  a  0.1  rise  in  the  USD/BRL  exchange  rate  (which  has  the  mean  of  2.44  in  the  precrisis  period) \nincreases the 30-year bond spread by 26 basis points in the precrisis period and 10 basis points in the \npostcrisis period. The difference between the effects of the exchange rate in the two periods is due to \nlower credit spreads in the postcrisis period (the mean of the credit spreads is 3.64% and 1.96% in the \nprecrisis  and  postcrisis  periods  as  shown  in  Table  1).  There  are  similar  observations  for  the  other \ncountries.  The  empirical  results  show  a  strong  linkage  between  the  sovereign  credit  spreads  and \nexchange rates. \n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n-\n3\n1\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Summary Statistics on Sample Bonds, Exchange Rates, and Option-Implied Volatility \n \n\n6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nPrecrisis\n0.9635\n0.8996\n0.8730\n1.1196\n1.7320\n9.5000\n\n0.6882\n0.6916\n0.9480\n0.8760\n10.247\n6.6503\n\n1.5221\n1.8266\n1.7760\n1.9971\n1.1682\n9.1150\n\n0.9426\n\n1.1533\n 1,874.2\n7.2789\n\n \n\nBrazil \nBond spread 10Y (%) \nBond spread 15Y (%) \nBond spread 20Y (%) \nBond spread 30Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/BRL \nImplied volatility (%) \nMexico \nBond spread 10Y (%) \nBond spread 15Y (%) \nBond spread 20Y (%) \nBond spread 30Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/MXN \nImplied volatility (%) \nTurkey \nBond spread 10Y (%) \nBond spread 15Y (%) \nBond spread 20Y (%) \nBond spread 30Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/TRY \nImplied volatility (%) \nColombia \nBond spread 10Y (%) \nBond spread 20Y (%) \nBond spread 30Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/COL \nImplied volatility (%) \nPhilippines \nBond spread 10Y (%) \nBond spread 15Y (%) \nBond spread 20Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/PHP \nImplied volatility (%) \nRussian Federation \nBond spread 15Y (%) \nExchange rate USD/RUB \nImplied volatility (%) \nUnited States \nTreasury yield 10Y (%) \nTreasury yield 15Y (%) \nTreasury yield 20Y (%) \nTreasury yield 30Y (%) \nShort term interest rate \n\nMax \nPrecrisis  Postcrisis\n8.8577 \n8.4530 \n8.7270 \n8.6911 \n3.2118 \n26.125 \n \n\n4.4195\n4.2563\n4.4560\n3.9394\n3.8415\n41.425\n \n\n2.3667 \n2.9160 \n2.6470 \n2.8581 \n11.664 \n13.430 \n\n7.5787 \n7.5601 \n3.5580 \n7.0480 \n1.7063 \n\n30.274 \n \n\n6.5799 \n\n6.3961 \n  2,904.6 \n24.980 \n \n \n\n5.5588 \n\n \n56.420 \n12.680 \n\n3.9306 \n\n30.740 \n11.000 \n\n5.2928 \n5.3664 \n5.6100 \n5.5606 \n5.7250 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2861\n3.9521\n4.1130\n4.2509\n17.201\n39.900\n \n\n6.8843\n6.1952\n5.7610\n6.5044\n3.0305\n\n32.453\n \n\n5.3527\n5.1400\n5.3048\n    3,259.0\n31.600\n \n\n3.3160\n5.6873\n2.8680\n\n48.925\n22.201\n \n\n7.7536\n70.808\n76.556\n \n\n3.9859\n4.3478\n4.7500\n4.8395\n1.4213\n\nMin\n\nMean\n\nPostcrisis\n0.6473\n0.7070\n0.9810\n0.6178\n1.5387\n9.0500\n\nPrecrisis\n3.5827\n3.4004\n3.5393\n3.6430\n2.4431\n15.6212\n\nStandard Deviation\nPostcrisis  Precrisis  Postcrisis\n1.9283 \n1.8107 \n1.8349 \n1.7895 \n0.4014 \n3.0692 \n\n1.7503 \n1.8832 \n2.0319 \n1.9588 \n2.0954 \n17.6596 \n\n0.7182\n0.6844\n0.7148\n0.7245\n0.4282\n4.9606\n\n0.6349\n0.3119\n0.9880\n0.8778\n11.493\n7.2500\n\n1.1503\n1.5637\n1.1170\n1.0967\n1.3944\n6.5065\n\n1.3393\n1.5674\n1.6564\n1.8034\n\n1.4691 \n1.5189 \n1.7462 \n1.6958 \n\n10.987\n8.6008\n\n13.216 \n15.237 \n\n3.1713\n3.3764\n2.4748\n3.1377\n1.3840\n\n2.4952 \n2.7566 \n2.5389 \n2.5457 \n1.8587 \n\n16.327\n\n15.184 \n\n0.9568\n1.3310\n0.8428\n   1,748.0\n7.0000\n\n2.9517\n\n3.4375\n2,410.3\n13.648\n\n1.8914 \n2.5187 \n1.9067 \n   1,995.3 \n15.083 \n\n \n1.3107 \n \n1.2717 \n       261.5 \n3.3262 \n\n0.8027\n0.6780\n0.7755\n       263.4\n5.4264\n\n \n\n0.3307 \n0.4808 \n0.3848 \n0.4330 \n0.2719 \n1.2371 \n \n1.2667 \n1.2055 \n0.4280 \n0.9674 \n0.0877 \n4.0406 \n\n \n \n1.2251 \n \n\n3.9561 \n1.6558 \n \n\n0.7949 \n1.5546 \n1.2677 \n \n\n0.3660 \n0.2968 \n0.2856 \n0.2783 \n1.7198 \n\n0.6967\n0.6294\n0.5078\n0.5407\n0.9856\n4.9398\n\n0.8759\n0.7108\n0.6876\n0.8164\n0.3512\n4.3012\n\n0.5018\n0.7913\n0.4185\n1.9480\n2.4954\n\n1.1416\n9.1571\n10.410\n\n0.6400\n0.6725\n0.7137\n0.6415\n0.2209\n\n1.4410\n\n3.0935\n\n0.8343\n0.9749\n0.7480\n\n1.6766 \n2.2001 \n1.6341 \n\n40.950\n\n4.6280\n\n40.450\n4.1127\n\n52.411\n\n44.195 \n\n7.7496\n\n7.5778 \n\n0.8840\n24.280\n\n2.4000\n\n1.4204\n\n2.0109\n\n3.0320 \n\n27.201\n8.2126\n\n27.801\n\n6.4438\n\n34.869 \n17.489 \n\n3.1121\n3.6211\n4.1300\n4.1730\n1.0000\n\n1.3875\n1.7488\n2.0400\n2.2222\n0.2229\n\n4.4369\n4.6777\n4.9180\n4.8515\n3.5596\n\n2.5855 \n2.9555 \n3.3237 \n3.5645 \n0.3725 \n\nBRL = Brazilian real, COL = Colombian peso, MXN = Mexican peso, PHP = Philippine peso, RUB = Russian ruble, TRY = Turkish lira,  \nUSD = US dollar. \nNotes: The preglobal financial crisis period covers 1 June 2003 to 31 December 2007, while the postglobal financial crisis period is from 1 \nJanuary 2009 to 29 September 2014.

This finding supports the argument that \ninvestors, in particular risk-averse ones, sell risky assets (i.e., sovereign bonds in emerging markets) and \nbuy US Treasuries as safe-haven assets in stressed markets. The magnitude of the estimates of c shows \nthat the relation between credit spreads and US Treasury yields is economically significant. Regarding \nthe  10-year  Brazilian  bond,  a  100-basis  point  increase  in  the  10-year  Treasury  yield  decreases  the \nBrazilian bond spread by 42 basis points in the precrisis period, and by 76 basis points in the postcrisis \nperiod. Similar effects are found for the other countries\u2019 sovereign bonds. Comparing the coefficients c \nin the two sample periods, the effects are generally stronger for the sample countries in the postcrisis \nperiod,  reflecting  a  more  important  role  of  US  Treasuries  as  safe-haven  assets  after  the  crisis.  One \nexplanation  is  that  during  an  extended  period  of  low  interest  rates  and  volatility  caused  by  the \naccommodative  monetary  policies  adopted  by  the  US  and  other  developed  economies,  market \nparticipants have displayed a tendency to seek higher returns by investing in securities that carry higher \ncredit  risk  such  as  emerging  market  sovereign  bonds.  This  \u201csearch  for  yield\u201d  behavior  has  caused \nsovereign bond spreads to be more sensitive to US Treasury yields in the postcrisis period.  \n\n \n\nThe  estimated  coefficients  on  exchange  rates  and  Treasury  yields  suggest  high  explanatory \npower ranging from 0.2 to 0.71 (in terms of the adjusted R-squared) for the sample sovereign bonds. \nThis  suggests  that  these  two  factors  are  adequate  determinants  of  the  countries\u2019  sovereign  credit \nspreads. The empirical results support the view that the exchange rates of emerging market currencies \ncan be used as the state variable with adequate explanatory power in a semistructural model for pricing \ntheir  own  US  dollar-denominated  sovereign  bonds.  Comparing  the  adjusted  R-squared  in  the  two \nsample periods, the explanatory power of exchange rates in the postcrisis period (about 0.31\u20130.71) is \nstronger than that in the precrisis period (about 0.2\u20130.51). This indicates that the link between sovereign \ncredit spreads and the dynamics of the exchange rates and US interest rates has become stronger in the \npostcrisis period.  \n \n \n\nIII.

While the \nDSR model and the CIR model have a number of common empirically relevant characteristics, such as \nnegative  interest  rates  being  precluded  and  having  a  stationary  distribution,  the  DSR  model  has  two \nr\uf073   are \nparticular  features  due  to  the  nonlinear  restoring  force. 9  First,  only  two  parameters \nr\uf071 , which is the long-run interest rate, is \nrequired to determine the interest rate dynamics.

The 3-month Treasury bill yield has been persistently near zero since the global \nfinancial  crisis  of  2008.  The  first-order  serial  correlation  of  monthly  changes  in  the  yield  during  this \nperiod is 0.484, as estimated by Lo and Hui (2016), reflecting that the yield is sticky and tends to be \npersistent at the low levels. \n \n\nWithout an explicit boundary condition at \n\nr \uf03d , the associated risk-free bond price function \n\n0\n\n\uf029\uf074,r\uf046\n\uf028\n\n with time to maturity \uf074 is given by Longstaff (1989):11 \n\n\uf046\n\n\uf028\nr\n\n\uf029\n,\n\uf074\n\n=\n\nA\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf074\n\nexp\n\n\uf07b\nC\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf074\n\nr\n\n\uf02b\n\nB\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf074\n\n\uf07dr\n \n\n\uf028 \uf029\nA\n\uf074\n\n=\n\n1\nC\n\nC\n\uf02d\n0\nexp\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf07b \uf07d\n\uf067\uf074\n\nexp\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf02b\n\uf074\uf061\uf061\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf02b\n\uf061\uf061\n4\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\uf02d\n\nC\n\n0\n\nexp\n\n\uf0fc\n\uf067\uf074\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fe\n\n1\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ed\n2\n\uf0ee\n\uf07b \uf07d\nexp\n\uf067\uf074\n\n \n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\nB\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf074\n\n=\n\n2\n\uf067\uf06c\n\uf02d\nr\n2\n\uf073\nr\n\n\uf02b\n\n2\n\uf073\nr\n\n\uf05b\n1\n\n\uf02d\n\n2\n\uf067\nC\nexp\n\n0\n\n \n\n\uf05d\uf067\uf074\n\uf07b \uf07d\n\nr\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf028\n2\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf029\n2\n\uf067\uf06c\uf06b\n\uf0e7\nr\n\uf0e8\nC\n\uf02d\n\n2\n\uf067\uf073\nr\n\n\uf05b\n1\n\n1\n\n\uf02d\n\nexp\n\nexp\n\n0\n\n2\n\n \n\n\uf0fc\n\uf067\uf074\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fe\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n1\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ed\n2\n\uf0ee\n\uf05d\uf067\uf074\n\uf07b \uf07d\n\nC\n\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf074\n\n=\n\n(4) \n\n(5) \n\n(6) \n\n(7) \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n9   The other two common characteristics include: (i) the interest rate returns to positive values if it approaches zero, and \n2\uf073  is directly related to the interest rate.

Its  continuous \nstochastic movement is modeled by the following stochastic differential equation: \n \n\nS\uf073  is the volatility, \n\nS\uf061  is the drift rate, and \n\nSdz  denotes a standard Wiener process. \n\nUsing  the  DSR  model  of  the  risk-free  interest  rate  in  the  pricing  framework,  the  Wiener \n\nrdz and \n\nSdz  in equations (3) and (8) are correlated with:  \n\nIto\u2019s  lemma  is  then  applied  to  derive  the  partial  differential  equation  governing  a  sovereign \n\ndiscount bond \n\nP S r \uf074  with the time to maturity of \uf074 as follows: \n\n,\n\n,\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\ndS\nS\n\n\uf03d\n\ndt\n\uf073\uf061 \uf02b\nS\n\nS\n\ndz\n\nS\n\n \n\ndz\n\ndz\n\nr\n\nS\n\n\uf072\uf03d\nSr\n\ndt\n\n \n\n \n\n2\n\nP\n\uf0b6\n2\nS\n\uf0b6\n\n(8) \n\n(9) \n\n(10) \n\n \nIn terms of the new variables and parameters:  \n \n\nP\n\uf0b6\n\uf074\n\uf0b6\n\n1\n2\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\n1\n4\n\n=\n\n2\n\n2\n\uf073\nS\n\nS\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf072 \uf073\uf073\nr\n\nSr\n\nS\n\nS r\n\n\uf02b\n\n2\n\uf02d\n\uf073 \uf06b\nr\nr\n\nr\n\n\uf02d\n\n2\n\uf06c\nr\n\nr\n\n\uf02d\n\nrP\n\nP\n\uf0b6\nr\n\uf0b6\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n2\n\nP\n\uf0b6\nr S\n\uf0b6 \uf0b6\n\n\uf02b\n\n2\n\uf073\nr\n\nr\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\nP\n\uf0b6\n2\nr\n\uf0b6\n\n\uf02b\n\nS\n\uf061\n\nP\n\uf0b6\nS\n\uf0b6\n\n \n\nx\n\n2=\n\nr\n\n,\n\ny\n\nln=\n\n,\n\ny\n\n0\n\nln=\n\nS\n\n0\n\n,\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\nS\nS\n\n0\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n=~\n\uf073\nr\n\n \n\n\uf073\nr\n2\n\n=~\n\uf06b\nr\n\n\uf06b\nr\n2\n\n=~\n\uf061\uf061 \uf02d\n\n \n\n,\n\n \n\n2\uf061\n2\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nEquation (10) becomes: \n \n\nP\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf074\n\n=\n\n2\n\uf073\nS\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\nP\n\uf0b6\n2\ny\n\uf0b6\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf025\n\uf072 \uf073 \uf073\nr\n\nSr\n\nL\n\n2\n\nP\n\uf0b6\nx y\n\uf0b6 \uf0b6\n\n\uf02b\n\n2\n\uf025\n\uf073\nr\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\nP\n2\nx\n\n\uf02b\n\n\uf025\n\uf061\n\nP\n\uf0b6\ny\n\uf0b6\n\n \n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf028\n\uf025\n\uf02b\n\uf06b \uf06c\nr\n\nr\n\nx\n\n\uf029\n\nP\n\uf0b6\nx\n\uf0b6\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf02d\n\n2\nx P\n\nWithout \n\uf029\n,\n\uf074\n\n\uf03d \uf046\n\nx\n\n\uf028\n\nloss  of  generality, \n\uf029\n\uf029\n,\n,\n\uf074\n\uf074\n\n\uf028\n ,  where  the  unknown  function \n\nP x y \uf074  is  assumed \n\n\uf025\n\uf028\nP x y\n,\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\uf025\n\uf029\nP x y \uf074\n,\n\n,\n\n\uf028\nP x y\n,\n\nto  be  of \n\nthe  product \n\nform: \n\n  denotes  the  discount  factor  of \n\nthe risk-free bond price function \n\n due to the possibility of default.   \n\n\uf029,x \uf074\uf046\n\uf028\n\nUnder a scenario in which default can only occur at maturity and the recovery rate is R at default, \n\nthe final payoff condition of the bond with the face value of 1 is: \n\n \n\n \n\n,\n\n\uf028\nrSP\n\uf028\n,\nrSP\n\n\uf029 1\n0,\n\uf03d\n\uf029 R\n\n\uf03d0,\n\n if \n\n if \n\n \n\n0SS \uf0a3\n0SS \uf03e\n\n  \n\n \nwhere  S0  is  the  default-triggering  level  above  which  default  occurs  and  bondholders  receive  an \nexogenously given number of default-free bonds.

In \naddition, such a dynamic default barrier is flexible enough to incorporate different default scenarios, as \ndemonstrated in Hui, Lo, and Tsang (2003). For example, default could be triggered even though the \nexchange rate is below S0 because of the liquidity problem (such as repayments of short-term debts) \nfaced by the government. In this case, a default scenario of higher short-term default probability can be \nincorporated into the valuation model by adjusting the default barrier lower than S0 in the early period \n(say 1 to 2 years) of the time to maturity of the bond.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nMARKET AND MODEL-IMPLIED SOVEREIGN BOND CREDIT SPREADS \n\nParameters for Pricing Bonds \n\n \nA. \n \nUsing the sovereign bond pricing model developed in the previous section, corresponding daily model-\nimplied bond prices are obtained for: Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey (with 10-year, 15-year, 20-year, and 30-\n\n(14) \n\n(15) \n\n(16) \n\n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nyear tenors); Colombia (with 10-year and 30-year tenors); the Philippines (with 10-year, 15-year, and \n20-year tenors); and the Russian Federation (with a 15-year tenor) in the precrisis and postcrisis periods. \n\uf028\nP S r \uf074  with a default barrier \nThe model-implied credit spread CS of a sovereign discount bond price \n(default allowed before bond maturity) based on equation (16) is given as:  \n \n\n\uf029\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\uf028\n,\nrSCS\n\n\uf029\n,\n\uf074\n\n=\n\n\uf02d\n\n1\n\uf074\n\nln\n\n\uf028\n\uf029\n,\n,\nrSP\n\uf074\n\uf028\n\uf029\n,\nr\n\uf074\n\uf046\n\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\n\uf0f6\n=\n\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n1\n\uf074\n\n~\n\uf028\n\uf028\n,\nyxP\n\n\uf029\uf074\n\uf029\n,\n\n \n\nln\n\n(17) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe input parameters for the model are \u03b1s and \u03c3s for the exchange rate S and \u03bar, \u03c3r, and \u03bbr for the \nUS dollar interest rate r.

Market sentiment of the \u201ccrash risk\u201d \nof a currency can be inferred from its out-of-the-money option-implied volatility, which is consistent \nwith  a  number  of  recent  studies  on  currency  crashes  using  information  on  currency  option  prices, \nincluding Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2009); Farhi et al.

The DSR model parameters \nare estimated by using Hansen\u2019s (1982) generalized method of moments technique which is also used \nby Longstaff  (1989) for the estimation  of the DSR term structure model.16 The estimations  are using \nmonth-end zero-coupon yield to maturity data of 3-month, 12-month and 10-year US Treasury bills and \nnotes during January 2000 to September 2014.

The \nrecovery rate R is 0.25 for Brazil, Turkey, Mexico, Colombia, and the Russian Federation, and 0.4 for the \nPhilippines.17  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n13   The expected future exchange rate can be incorporated into the model by specifying a drift for the exchange rate dynamics. \nFor  example,  assuming  that  uncovered  interest  rate  parity  holds,  the  drift  is  the  interest  rate  differential  between  an \nemerging market currency and the US dollar.  \n\n14   The  Black\u2013Scholes  delta  provides  a  normalized  measure  of  option  \u201cmoneyness\u201d  where  the  delta  of  a  European  option \n\nincreases monotonically from 0 to 100, with the \u201cmoneyness\u201d moving from out-of-the-money to in-the-money. \n\n15   Gray, Merton, and Bodie (2007) use exchange rate volatility as a fundamental factor associated with the dynamics of an \neconomy\u2019s  asset,  which  is  the  underlying  variable  estimated  from  the  public  balance  sheet,  in  their  contingent  claims \nanalysis to price sovereign credit risk. \n\n16   Both  the  estimations  in  Table  3  and  Longstaff  (1989)  have  large  standard  errors  which  are  primarily  due  to  the  high \n\ncorrelations among the individual parameters. \n\n17   The data of option-implied volatility are from JP Morgan.

calibrated and \nreference  default  barriers  of  the  Brazilian  sovereign  bond  track  the  market  credit  spreads  closely, \nparticularly during 2007 before the global financial crisis and in 2009\u20132010 after the crisis. Given that \nthe calibrated barriers are higher than the reference barrier, the model credit spreads obtained from the \ncalibrated barriers are lower than those obtained from the reference barrier and closer to the market \ncredit spreads as expected. The trend in the model credit spreads generated from the different default \nbarriers are qualitatively similar, indicating that the default barriers affect mainly the level of the spreads. \nCorrelations  between  the  market  and  model  credit  spreads  of  the  bonds  with  different  tenors  are \nreported in Table 5. The high positive correlations in level (higher than 0.8) and in log change (between \n0.3 and 0.54) are consistent with the observations in Panels A and B of Figure 3.  \n \n\nRegarding  the  Mexican  sovereign  bond  in  Panel  C,  the  model  credit  spreads  based  on  the \ncalibrated and reference default barriers have similar trends in the market credit spreads in the precrisis \nperiod.  For  example,  both  the  market  and  model  spreads  jumped  in  mid-2006  and  mid-2007.  The \ncorrelations  between  their  spreads  at  different  tenors  are  above  0.4  in  level  and  0.28  in  log  change. \nDuring the postcrisis period, as shown in Panel C, the model credit spreads generated from the calibrated \nbarriers are quite close to the market credit spreads with the correlations for different tenors above 0.65 \nin level and 0.21 in log change.  \n\n \nWhile the model credit spreads based on the reference barrier are higher than the market values, \ntheir  changes  broadly  follow  those  of  the  market  and  model  (based  on  the  calibrated  barrier)  credit \nspreads, as indicated by the high positive correlations in level and log change. The results demonstrate \nthat the calibrated and reference default barriers determine the levels of the bond spreads but in general \ndo not affect their changes substantially. \n\n \nPanel E in Figure 3 shows that the market and model spreads of the 15-year Turkish sovereign \nbond are quite close to each other during 2004 and 2005 but substantially different in 2003 and 2006. \nTherefore,  their  correlations  shown  in  Table  5  are  lower  than  those  of  the  Brazilian  and  Mexican \nsovereign bonds in the precrisis period. Similar to the Mexican sovereign bond, the model spreads with \nthe reference barrier are higher than the market spreads and model spreads with the calibrated barriers \nin the postcrisis period (see Panel F). Regarding the 10-year Colombian sovereign bond in Panels G and \nH, the model spreads with the calibrated barriers broadly track the market spreads in particular in the \npostcrisis period with high correlations in levels.  \n\n \nThe tracking performance of the model spreads with the reference barrier is also better in the \npostcrisis period. The model spreads of the 15-year Philippine sovereign bond shown in Panels I and J \nexhibit similar movements of the market spreads with quite high positive correlations among the bonds \nwith different tenors. Panel K shows that the model spreads of the 15-year Russian sovereign bond do \nnot  fit  the  market  spreads  well  in  the  precrisis  period.  The  tracking  performance  however  improves \nsignificantly in the postcrisis period as shown in Panel L, and the correlations between the model and \nmarket spreads increase accordingly.  \n\n \nIn  summary,  the  comparison  between  the  market  and  model  credit  spreads  of  the  sovereign \nbonds of Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Colombia, the Philippines, and the Russian Federation (as illustrated in \nFigure 3 and their correlations in Table 5) show that the proposed model can generate credit spreads \nwhich  track  the  changes  of  the  market  credit  spreads.  The  results  are  consistent  with  the  regression \nresults in section  II that exchange rates in the emerging markets are related to their  sovereign credit \nspreads. The calibrated and reference default barriers used in the model mainly shift the levels of model \nspreads but do not make their changes different materially. \n\n\fExchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated Sovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets   |   19 \n\nTable 5: Correlations between Market and Model Credit Spreads, Precrisis and Postcrisis \n \n\n \n \n \n\nPrecrisis Period\n\nPostcrisis Period \n\nCalibrated Barrier \nLog \nChange \n\nLevel \n\nReference Barrier\nLog \nChange \n\nLevel \n\nCalibrated Barrier\nLog \nChange \n\nLevel \n\nReference Barrier\nLog \nChange \n\nLevel \n\n0.959539 \n0.953949 \n0.921730 \n0.882142 \n\n0.552880 \n0.527560 \n0.418776 \n0.504708 \n\n0.514546 \n0.418965 \n0.277704 \n0.371978 \n\nBrazil \n10Y \n15Y \n20Y \n30Y \nMexico \n10Y \n15Y \n20Y \n30Y \nTurkey \n10Y \n15Y \n20Y \n30Y \nColombia \n10Y \n20Y \n30Y \nPhilippines \n10Y \n15Y \n20Y \nRussian Federation \n15Y \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.680392 \n\n \n\n \n\n0.523275 \n0.482760 \n0.508187 \n0.536708 \n\n0.438373 \n0.326232 \n0.275607 \n0.350846 \n \n\n0.089379 \n0.424573 \n0.426114 \n0.443446 \n \n\n0.285348 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.959598  0.520982  0.908860  0.379767 \n0.303421 \n0.952600  0.487191 \n0.320706 \n0.926139 \n0.501518 \n0.899338  0.514740 \n0.390204 \n \n\n0.830241 \n0.893335 \n0.847727 \n\n0.437605  0.847623 \n0.325294 \n0.275836 \n\n0.199990 \n0.549319 \n0.650370  0.210405 \n0.511315 \n0.397264 \n0.341452 \n0.785107 \n0.489280  0.359946  0.747097  0.427725 \n \n\n0.483176 \n0.419699 \n0.284289  0.243198 \n0.443260  0.256475 \n \n\n0.140926 \n0.129808 \n0.521127 \n0.234234 \n0.272989  0.507177 \n0.546733 \n0.259238 \n0.269549  0.301469 \n\n0.905720  0.208497 \n0.862308  0.216809 \n0.908509  0.298449 \n\n0.217847 \n\n0.820612 \n \n\n0.643841 \n \n \n\n0.897575 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.868848  0.397125 \n0.800445  0.309539 \n0.901480  0.316430 \n0.384474 \n0.871172 \n \n \n\n0.799435 \n0.721163 \n0.785477 \n0.746418 \n \n\n0.234820 \n0.240200 \n0.374332 \n0.457096 \n \n\n0.482898  0.318999 \n0.568609  0.372451 \n0.645104 \n0.374980 \n0.405902  0.352574 \n \n\n \n\n0.90707 \n0.237631 \n0.842845  0.202812 \n0.267469 \n0.887793 \n \n \n\n0.756206  0.217695 \n0.829884  0.211198 \n0.767511 \n \n\n0.228892 \n \n\n0.892079 \n\n0.266252 \n\n0.272526 \n\n0.733676 \n0.225239 \n0.807720  0.224934 \n0.748286  0.244271 \n\n0.749448 \n\n0.108970 \n\n0.163759 \n\n0.735777 \n\n0.03452 \n\n0.762646  0.072708  0.772496 \n\n0.588978 \n\n0.696061 \n\n0.579182 \n\nNotes: The preglobal financial crisis period covers 1 June 2003 to 31 December 2007, while the postglobal financial crisis period is from 1 \nJanuary 2009 to 29 September 2014.

The corresponding absolute \npercentage errors are 18%\u201334% (with the aggregate of 21%) and 17%\u201329% (with the aggregate of 24%). \nUsing the calibrated barriers, the RMS errors drop to the ranges of 56\u201381 bps (with the aggregate of 69 \nbps) and 32\u201351 bps (with the aggregate of 39 bps) in the precrisis and postcrisis periods, respectively. \nThe corresponding absolute percentage errors are in the ranges of 13%\u201326% (with the aggregate of 17%) \nand 15%\u201334% (with the aggregate of 23%).  \n\n \nThe results show that the RMS errors are smaller in the postcrisis period than in the precrisis \nperiod. However, the absolute percentage errors are larger in the postcrisis period, indicating that the \ndifferences in the RMS errors are mainly due to credit spreads in the postcrisis period (with the mean \nabout 2%) being lower than in the precrisis period (with the mean about 3.5%) as shown in Table 1. As \n\n\fExchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated Sovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets   |   23 \n\nexpected, the performance of the model based on the calibrated barriers is better than that based on \nthe reference barrier. However, if the ranges and aggregates of errors for the two types of barriers in the \npostcrisis  period  are  compared,  the  use  of  the  calibrated  barriers  does  not  substantially  outperform \ncompared with the reference barrier. The percentage errors indicate that the model with the calibrated \nbarrier tends to generate lower credit spreads in both the precrisis and postcrisis periods, at \u20132.6% and \n\u20136.2%  in  aggregate.  While  the  magnitudes  are  smaller  than  the  standard  deviations,  this  indicates  a \nmarginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the model for the pricing of the bond spreads (prices). \n\n \nFor Mexican sovereign bonds, the RMS errors with the reference barrier are in the ranges of 58\u2013\n89 bps (with the aggregate of 69 bps) and 89\u2013444 bps (with the aggregate of 279 bps) in the precrisis \nand postcrisis periods, respectively. The corresponding absolute percentage errors are 28%\u201346% (with \nthe  aggregate  of  37%)  and  56%\u2013312%  (with  the  aggregate  of  171%).  The  poorer  performance  of  the \nmodel in the postcrisis period reflects that the reference barrier is very different from the level of the \nexchange  rate  triggering  default.  Using  the  calibrated  barriers,  the  RMS  errors  in  the  precrisis  and \npostcrisis periods drop to 38\u201345 bps (with the aggregate of 42 bps) and 38\u201360 bps (with the aggregate \nof 50 bps), respectively. The corresponding absolute percentage errors fall in the ranges of 15%\u201325% \n(with the aggregate of 21%) and 17%\u201337% (with the aggregate of 27%). The performance of the model \nfor  Mexican  sovereign  bonds  is  not  very  different  in  the  precrisis  and  postcrisis  periods,  while  the \nmagnitudes of their errors are similar to those of Brazilian sovereign bonds. In addition, the aggregate \npercentage errors  indicate  that  the  model  with  the  calibrated  barriers tends  to  generate  lower  credit \nspreads in the postcrisis period, but the error magnitude of \u20133.7% is lower than that of Brazilian bonds. \n\n \nThe performance results for the sovereign bonds of Turkey, Colombia, the Philippines, and the \nRussian Federation are qualitatively similar to those for Brazil and Mexico in general. Using the calibrated \nbarriers, their aggregate absolute percentage errors are in the range of 16%\u201332% and 19%\u201335% in the \nprecrisis and postcrisis periods, respectively. The errors are not much different from those for Brazil (17% \nand 23%) and Mexico (21% and 27%). Their percentage errors using the calibrated barriers are mostly \nnegative, in the range of \u201314.7%\u20130.3%, reflecting a marginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the \nmodel for the pricing of bond spreads (prices) particularly in the postcrisis period. The generally poorer \nperformance of the model using the reference barriers (in particular, for Turkey in the postcrisis period) \ndemonstrates that the performance is sensitive to the setting of the default barriers. \n\n \nFor a broad assessment of the performance of the proposed model for pricing sovereign bonds, \nits pricing errors are compared with those of the structural models for corporate bonds. Eom, Helwege, \nand  Huang  (2004)  empirically  test  five  structural  models  of  corporate  bond  pricing  which  are \nconsidered  typical,  including  those  of  Merton  (1974),  Geske  (1977),  Longstaff  and  Schwartz  (1995), \nLeland and Toft (1996), and Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2001). They implement the models using \na  sample  of  182  bond  prices  from  firms  with  simple  capital  structures  during  1986\u20131997.  The  mean \nabsolute percentage errors of model credit spreads in the study are 78% for the Merton model, 66% for \nthe Geske model, 97% for the Longstaff\u2013Schwartz model, 146% for the Leland\u2013Toft model, and 170% \nfor the Collin-Dufresne\u2013Goldstein model. While pricing sovereign and corporate bonds based on the \nstructural approach produces different pricing errors, the performance of the proposed sovereign bond \npricing model is no worse than that of the structural models for pricing corporate bonds. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 530 \n\nV. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n\nUsing  data  on  emerging  markets,  including  Brazil,  Colombia,  Mexico,  the  Philippines,  the  Russian \nFederation, and Turkey, before and after the global financial crisis, the empirical results show that the \nexchange  rates  of  their  currencies  have  adequate  power  to  explain  their  US  dollar-denominated \nsovereign bond prices, particularly in the postcrisis period. Based on an analogy between an economy\u2019s \ncurrency price and a firm\u2019s stock price, this paper develops a two-factor pricing model in closed-form \nsolutions for the sovereign bonds with default at or prior to maturity (i.e., a default barrier), in which the \ncorrelated factors are foreign exchange rates and US risk-free interest rates that follow a double square-\nroot  process  relevant  in  the  low  interest  rate  environment.  To  incorporate  forward-looking  market \ninformation  into  the  model,  the  currency  option-implied  volatility  is  used  as  the  associated  model \nparameter of the exchange rate.  \n\n \nUsing US dollar-denominated sovereign bonds with different tenors, the numerical results from \nthe closed-form solution with default prior to maturity show that the credit spreads generated from the \npricing model broadly track changes in market credit spreads in both the precrisis and postcrisis periods. \nThe correlations between them are positive and high especially when the calibrated default barriers are \nused for pricing the bonds. The corresponding absolute percentage errors vary among the bonds. For \nexample, the aggregate absolute percentage errors for Brazil in the precrisis and postcrisis periods are \n17%  and  23%,  respectively,  while  those  for  Turkey  are  27%  and  35%.  The  percentage  errors  show  a \nmarginal systematic negative (positive) bias of the model for pricing bond spreads (prices) particularly \nin the postcrisis period. The magnitude of the errors is lower than that of conventional structural models \nfor the pricing of corporate bonds. The numerical results are consistent with the empirical results that \nthe exchange rate dynamics of the emerging market currencies are significantly related to their sovereign \ncredit spreads. \n \nThe results support the findings of a strong relationship between emerging markets\u2019 sovereign \nrisk and exchange rate stability in the literature on international finance and studies about twin sovereign \ndebt  and  currency  crises.  This  paper\u2019s  findings  suggest  that  dollar-denominated  sovereign  bonds  are \ndirectly influenced by exchange rate dynamics. This suggests that both governments and investors might \nbe better served by issuing debt in local currency, and letting investors hedge these risks in currency \nmarkets. \n \nGiven that the model simply captures the contributions due to exchange rate dynamics, future \nresearch could develop multifactor models augmented to allow for the possible sensitivity of bond credit \nspreads  to  exchange  rates  and  their  volatility,  and  to  depend  on  observable  country-specific  or \nmacroeconomic variables, such as foreign reserves, which affect sovereign risk.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\f

The relationship is particularly strong after the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. \nA two-factor pricing model is developed with closed-form solutions for the sovereign bonds. The correlated \nfactors in the model\u2014foreign exchange rates and United States risk-free interest rates\u2014follow a double \nsquare-root process relevant in a low interest rate environment. The numerical results and associated error \nanalysis show that the model credit spreads can broadly track market credit spreads.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nExchANgE RAtE DyNAMicS \n\nAND UNitED StAtES DOllAR-\n\nDENOMiNAtED SOvEREigN BOND \n\nPRicES iN EMERgiNg MARkEtS\n\nCho-Hoi Hui, Chi-Fai Lo, and Po-Hon Chau\n\nNO. 530\n\nnovember 2017\n\nadb economics\n\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "ADB Economics Working Paper Series \n", " \nExchange Rate Dynamics and United States Dollar-Denominated  \nSovereign Bond Prices in Emerging Markets \n \n \n \nCho-Hoi Hui, Chi-Fai Lo, and Po-Hon Chau \n", " \n", "No. 530   |   December 2017 \n", "Cho-Hoi Hui (chhui@hkma.gov.hk), is head of Market \nResearch Division in the Research Department of the \nHong Kong Monetary Authority and Adviser at the Hong \nKong Institute for Monetary Research.
