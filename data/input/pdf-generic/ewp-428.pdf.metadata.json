Its mission is to help its developing member \n\ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \n\nit remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 \n\na day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \n\ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \n\nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \n\nand technical assistance.\n\nMyAnMAr: Cross-CuttinG\nGovernAnCe ChAllenGes\n\nCullen Hendrix and Marcus Noland\n\nno. 428\n\nmarch 2015\n\nadb economics\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\n\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nADB Economics Working Paper Series \n\n \n \nMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges \n \n \nCullen Hendrix and Marcus Noland \n\n \n\nNo. 428   |   2015 \n\nCullen Hendrix (Cullen.Hendrix@du.edu) is Assistant \nProfessor of Korbel School of International Studies, \nUniversity of Denver and Nonresident Senior Fellow at \nthe Peterson Institute for International Economics. \nMarcus Noland (MNoland@PIIE.COM) is Executive \nVice President and Director of Studies of Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics and Senior Fellow \nat the East-West Center. \n \nThis was a background paper for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Myanmar Country \nDiagnostics Study.

Good \ngovernance  can  be  thought  of  as  the  creation  of  an  environment  in  which  beneficial  policy  can  be \nformulated and implemented in a socially inclusive manner. Governance is an inherently multifaceted \nconcept  that  encompasses  both  formal  rules  and  norms  governing  the  conduct  of  public  affairs. \nBroadly  speaking,  it  can  be  broken  into  three  basic  baskets:  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework, \nbureaucratic and administrative capacity, and government transparency/engagement with civil society.  \n\n \nWithout good governance, countries fail to unlock the full potential of their human and natural \ncapital. For society to make productive investments in human and physical capital, it needs assurances \nthat  these  investments  will  not  be  expropriated\u2014directly  or  indirectly--and  that  contracts  will  be \nenforced  by  independent,  nonpartisan  courts,  even  when  it  is  not  in  the  short-term  interest  of  the \ngovernment  for  them  to  do  so.1  Moreover,  these  assurances  are  particularly  valuable  for  courting \ninvestment  from  firms  in  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) \ncountries and investment in the nonresource sector, whose development will be crucial for balancing \nMyanmar\u2019s  export  profile  and  providing  employment  opportunities.  For  markets  to  truly  flourish,  the \ngovernment  must  be  able  to  efficiently  provide  market-sustaining  public  goods,  in  the  form  of \ntransparent market regulation, infrastructure, and enforcement of contracts. For these benefits to be \nwidely  shared  and  promote  social  inclusion,  policies  should  be  crafted  in  collaboration  and \nconsultation with civil society groups. \n\n \nSince 2010,  Myanmar  has been in the midst of a  multifaceted transition, involving economic \nreforms, the resolution of multiple long-standing civil conflicts, and a nascent transition to democratic \nrule. These transitions are co-occurring with a resource-led economic boom, and all the blessings and \nchallenges such booms entail. These transformations are occurring in parallel, and outcomes of each \ntransition  are  dependent  on  the  outcomes  of  the  others.  These  transitions  provide  a  unique \nopportunity  to  engage  in  broad  governance  reform  and  develop  the  institutions  necessary  for  a \ngrowing economy. \n\n \nThe  remainder  of  this  paper  proceeds  as  follows.  Section  II  assesses  the  current  status  of \ngovernance institutions, as well as their performance, in comparison to the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and selected other countries. Section III discusses outstanding problem areas \nrelated  to  economic  governance,  particularly  in  the  legal  system,  the  business  regulatory  framework, \nand bureaucratic capacity, and provides specific policy recommendations for leveling the playing field \nbetween  state  economic  enterprises  (SEEs),  military-affiliated  enterprises,  and  the  private  sector. \nSection IV discusses opportunities to engage civil society in Myanmar\u2019s economic governance and the \npeace  process.  Section  V  addresses  the  potential  use  of  external  policy  anchors,  particularly  in  the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process, to strengthen Myanmar\u2019s ongoing reform \neffort, before Section VI concludes with a brief summary of key policy recommendations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   To be clear, the direct expropriation is prohibited by the constitution. However, investors can be indirectly expropriated by \nchanging  rules  and  regulations  after  the  investment  has  been  undertaken.  This  consideration  points  to  the  need  for  a \nstrong court system to impartially adjudicate such disputes. \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nII.  \n\nCROSS-NATIONAL INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE \n\n \nIn  recent  years,  a  consensus  has  emerged  on  the  importance  of  institutions,  governance,  and \nspecifically transparency, to economic development. Challenges in assessing the quality of institutions \nor  governance,  or  the  degree  of  transparency  or  corruption  are  nontrivial,  however.  Cross-national \nsurveys  have  become  an  important  means  of  benchmarking  absolute  performance,  relative  ranking, \nand direction trends across a variety of relevant metrics. While there may be a \u201cbeauty pageant\u201d aspect \nto  this  evidence,  it  likely  contains  some  \u201ctrue\u201d  information,  and  at  an  absolute  minimum  can  be \ninterpreted as a valid indication of the perceptions of local and outside observers. \n \n\nOne of the immediate difficulties confronting both analysts and policymakers alike is the sheer \nnumber of such indicators and their reliance on sometimes overlapping sources of information. Even if \nthese  challenges  can  be  sorted  out,  one  still  faces  the  issue  of  prioritization  across  various  agenda \nitems and devising actual policy responses. \n\n \nGivens  (2013)  carefully  examines  a  huge  number  of  these  indicators  to  statistically  separate \nout redundancy and derive the true new information contained in each measure, then determines the \ndimensions  of  governance  that  have  the  biggest  impact  on  growth  performance.  He  finds  that \nmeasures relating to \u201cmarket infrastructure,\u201d essentially rule of law and corruption and \u201ccivil liberties,\u201d \nessentially other dimensions of  rule of  law plus voice, have the biggest impact on growth,  surpassing \nsuch influences on growth such as international trade and geography.      \n\n \nIn  this  section,  we  review  Myanmar\u2019s  performance  on  a  number  of  these  cross-national \nsurveys of governance, focusing on rule of law and the extent of corruption. We then link back to these \nthemes  in  the  concluding  section  on  how  international  initiatives  can  be  used  to  anchor  Myanmar\u2019s \nown  efforts  to  improve  performance  in  these  areas.  In  almost  all  cases,  we  benchmark  Myanmar\u2019s \nperformance against local comparators Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet Nam (together, the CMLV countries). \n\n \nThe  bottom  line  is  that  Myanmar\u2019s  economic  governance  needs  improvement  on  most  of \nthese indicators. Evidence derived from Myanmar-based respondents in the World Economic Forum\u2019s \n(WEF) Global Competitiveness Report survey indicates that financing and governance issues are at the \ntop  of  the  list  of  obstacles  to  development  (World  Economic  Forum  2014).2  However,  some \nimprovement  in  recent  years  is  evident  in  the  data,  reinforcing  the  notion  that  the  country\u2019s  recent \nreforms  are  being  recognized  around  the  world.  These  results  also  underscore  a  basic  lesson\u2014\nMyanmar has nowhere to go but up, and as its institutional practices converge on global norms, we can \nexpect  to  observe  a  concomitant  reduction  in  the  risk  premium  associated  with  doing  business  in \nMyanmar, increased foreign investment on better financial terms, and an overall acceleration in growth \nand improvement in outcomes. In the final section, we discuss some specifics of how external policy \nanchors can be leveraged to further this effort. \n\n \nWe start by examining how local market participants evaluate their own environment.

(The Myanmar partner institution was the Centre for Economic and Social \nDevelopment  of  Myanmar  Development  Resource  Institute  (MDRI-CESD).)    The  median  country  sample  size  was  87 \nresponses. In the case of Myanmar, there were 86 respondents.   \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   3 \n\nout  are  access  to  financing  (18.0),  corruption  (13.9),  inefficient  government  bureaucracy  (9.7), \ninadequately  educated  workforce  (8.7),  and  policy  instability  (8.6).  Following  these,  the  most \nproblematic  factors  in  rank  order  are  inadequate  supply  of  infrastructure  (7.1),  foreign  currency \nregulations (6.2), tax regulations (4.8), inflation (4.0), government instability/coups (3.8), poor ethic in \nthe national labor force and restrictive labor regulations (both 3.8), tax rates (3.3), insufficient capacity \nto innovate (2.1), crime and theft (1.6) and poor public health (0.6).  In short, in a substantial sample of \nMyanmar  businesspeople,  governance  issues,  such  as  corruption  and  an  inefficient  bureaucracy,  are \nconsidered among the most serious obstacles to economic advancement.    \n\n \n\nFigure 1: The Most Problematic Factors for Doing Business in Myanmar \n\n18.0\n\n13.9\n\ns\ne\ns\nn\no\np\ns\ne\nr\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n9.7\n\n8.7 8.6\n\n7.1\n\n6.2\n\n4.8\n\n4.0 3.8\n\n3.8 3.8\n\n3.3\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\nn\no\ni\nt\np\nu\nr\nr\no\nC\n\ni\n\ng\nn\nc\nn\na\nn\ni\nf\n \no\nt\n \ns\ns\ne\nc\nc\nA\n\n \n\ne\nc\nr\no\nf\nk\nr\no\nw\nd\ne\nt\na\nc\nu\nd\ne\ny\ne\nt\na\nu\nq\ne\nd\na\nn\nI\n\nl\n\n \n\ny\nc\na\nr\nc\nu\na\ne\nr\nu\nb\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\ng\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\ne\nn\nI\n\ni\n\ny\nt\ni\nl\ni\n\nb\na\nt\ns\nn\n\ni\n \n\ny\nc\n\ni\nl\n\no\nP\n\nl\n\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nu\ng\ne\nr\n \ny\nc\nn\ne\nr\nr\nu\nc\nn\ng\ne\nr\no\nF\n\ni\n\n \n\ne\nr\nu\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\na\nr\nf\nn\n\n \n\nl\n\ni\n \nf\no\ny\np\np\nu\ns\n \ne\nt\na\nu\nq\ne\nd\na\nn\nI\n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nl\nf\nn\nI\n\nl\n\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nu\ng\ne\nr\n \nx\na\nT\n\ns\np\nu\no\nc\n/\ny\nt\ni\nl\ni\n\nb\na\nt\ns\nn\n\ni\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n\n\u2026\nr\no\nb\na\n\nl\n \nl\n\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nn\nn\n\n \n\ni\n \n\ni\n\nc\nh\nt\ne\nk\nr\no\nw\n\n \n\n \nr\no\no\nP\n\nl\n\ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nu\ng\ne\nr\n \nr\no\nb\na\n\nl\n \n\ne\nv\ni\nt\nc\ni\nr\nt\ns\ne\nR\n\ns\ne\nt\na\nr\n \nx\na\nT\n\ne\nt\na\nv\no\nn\nn\n\ni\n \n\no\nt\n \ny\nt\ni\nc\na\np\na\nc\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\ni\nf\nf\nu\ns\nn\nI\n\ni\n\n0.6\n\nh\nt\nl\na\ne\nh\nc\n\n \n\ni\nl\n\nb\nu\np\n \nr\no\no\nP\n\nt\nf\ne\nh\nt\n \nd\nn\na\ne\nm\n\n \n\ni\nr\n\nC\n\nNote: From the list of factors above, respondents were asked to select the five most problematic for \ndoing business in their country and to rank them between 1 (most problematic) and 5.

The  strength  of  such  guidelines  lies  in  their \nuniversal  applicability  to  different  budget  systems  around  the  world  and  to  countries  with  different  income  levels.  The \nresults  for  each  country  in  the  2012  Survey  are  based  on  the  125-question  questionnaire  that  is  completed  by  one \nresearcher or group of researchers within an organization from the country,\u201d typically from academic institutions or civil \nsociety organizations, with most of the respondents coming from organizations with a significant focus on budget issues \n(International Budget Partnership 2012, p. 44). The Myanmar partner institution was not listed in the report. \n\n \n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\n \nIn  the  past,  Myanmar  had  trailed  its  local  comparators  on  all  seven  indicators.  However  the \ncountry  exhibited  a  noticeable  improvement  in  the  2013  TI  ranking,  surpassing  Cambodia.    In \npercentile  terms,  the  country  scores  better  on  the  WEF\u2019s  favoritism  in  decisions  of  government \nofficials (11.8%), the World Bank\u2019s control of corruption indicator (11.4%), and the WEF\u2019s diversion of \nfunds indicator (15.3%). In the case of the open budget index, where Myanmar was tied for last place \nwith  two  others,  among  98  countries,  recent  reforms  involving  publication  and  parliamentary \ndiscussion  of  the  national  budget  make  the  country\u2019s  improvement  in  the  next  survey  a  virtual \ncertainty. Other ongoing reforms in the areas of transparency and corruption mean that the country is \nlikely  to  show  improvement  with  respect  to  the  other  indicators  as  well.  Figure  4  shows  that  the \ncountry has made modest improvements in absolute terms in recent years.  \n\n \nWhatever is the \u201ctrue\u201d information provided by the various measures of governance, any fair \nreading of these results would indicate that Myanmar does  not  score very  high, generally trailing the \nthree comparators, always in the lowest quartile. There is evidence of modest improvements in recent \nyears, however, and with deepening reforms, further improvements in absolute and relative scores can \nbe  anticipated.    One  would  expect  such  improvements  to  translate  into  improved  economic \nperformance in the medium- to long-term. \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Transparency International Corruption Perceptions \nCompared, 2008\u20132013 \n\ne\nr\no\nc\ns\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\np\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\nn\no\ni\nt\np\nu\nr\nr\no\nC\n\n \n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n31\n\n31\n\n26\n\n21\n\n20\n\n27\n\n27\n\n21\n\n21\n\n22\n\n21\n\n20\n\n18\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\nCambodia\n\nLao PDR\n\nMyanmar\n\nViet Nam\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nNote: Scores on a scale of 0\u2013100 beginning in 2012, and 0\u201310 in prior years.

ONGOING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORMS \n\nIn 2011, President Thein Sein launched a wide-ranging and ongoing reform program, covering not only \nthe  economy,  but  internal  political  issues  and  foreign  relations  as  well.  A  human  rights  commission \n(HRC) was established (and reorganized in 2014). The HRC has launched a website, and state media \npublished  material  specifying  the  complaint  process  and  necessary  documentation.  The  right  to \npublicly  demonstrate  (subject  to  notification)  was  introduced,  and  draft  legislation  on  the  right  of \nassociation is under debate.9 Application of the peaceful protest law by local authorities has remained \nsubject  to  controversy,  however,  and  in  June  2014,  amendments  were  enacted  to  improve \nimplementation. Labor legislation (the Trade Union Law, 2011), liberal by regional standards, has been \nenacted allowing unions, and protecting the employment of workers joining a union or participating in \na strike, though activists complain of problems in implementation. As of October 2013, more than 500 \nbasic labor organizations (unions) had been certified and wildcat labor unrest is being transformed into \nlegal strikes.    \n \n\nCensorship  has  been  greatly  diminished  with  the  abolition  of  the  Press  Scrutiny  and \nRegistration  Division,  private  publications  have  commenced  political  reporting,  and  independent \nnewspapers began publication in April 2013 (Steinberg 2013a, Clapp and DiMaggio 2013).  As we will \nargue below, the development of civil society and a free press are key aspects of making transparency \ninitiatives like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) work. \n\n \nWith  respect  to  more  technocratic  concerns,  a  nongovernmental  (though  state  authorized) \nthink tank, the Myanmar Development Resource Institute (MDRI) was established as a reform brain \ntrust.  It has a three part program encompassing economics, law, and security and political affairs.  The \nSocial and Economic Advisory Council was subsequently started to advise ministries on the enactment \nof reforms and implementation. \n\n \nIn  a  further  effort  to  improve  the  functioning  of  government,  President  Thein  Sein  has  also \nestablished  the  Public  Services  Performance  Appraisal  Task  Force  to  review  the  operations  of  all \ngovernment  ministries  dealing  with  the  public,  cut  red  tape,  streamline  decision  making,  restructure \norganization  where  necessary,  and  change  organizational  culture  to  improve  the  delivery  of  public \nservices\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 4). In related moves, he also \n\n \n\n \n\ni.   established an anticorruption committee and signed the Anti-Corruption Law (2013); \nii.  \n\ninitiated  the  process  of  joining  EITI,  with  the  Centre  for  Economic  and  Social  Development, \nthe economic wing of MDRI, tasked with serving as the secretariat for the application process; \nMDRI will need enhanced budgetary support to expand its capacity to address its myriad new \nroles;  \n\niii.  declared  the  country\u2019s  intention  to  join  the  Open  Government  Partnership,  a  multilateral \ninitiative  aimed  at  securing  \u201cconcrete  commitments  from  governments  to  promote \ntransparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen \ngovernance\u201d  (Open  Government  Partnership \n  http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about \naccessed 27 September 2013); and  \n\n                                                 \n9    Reforms aimed at opening space for civil society are discussed further in Section IV. \n\n \n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\niv.   has  constituted  a  working  group  in  the  president\u2019s  office  \u201cto  make  necessary  preparations  to \nmeet  these  standards  for  transparency,  accountability,  citizen  participation,  and  technology \nand innovation\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 4).10  \n \nMyanmar\u2019s  fiscal  processes,  which  had  been  among  the  most  opaque  in  the  world,  have \nopened up (International Budget Partnership 2013). In 2012, the state budget was publicly debated in \nparliament  and  published  in  private  newspapers  for  the  first  time,  and  the auditor  general  \u201chas  been \ngiven a measure of independence\u201d (McKinsey Global Institute 2013, p. 14). As a result of this greater \nopenness,  the  state  budget  is  beginning  to  change  in  ways  reflecting  greater  accountability  to  the \npublic. Expenditures on health and education have risen by 78% and 50%, respectively (IMF 2013).   \n\n \nTax  reform  has  been  undertaken  and  the  country  has  established  a  long-term  vision,  which \nincludes  reform  of  tax  administration,  movement  to  value-added  tax,  and,  in  conjunction  with \nmultilateral partners such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  strengthened  fiscal  management  (IMF  2013).  Historically,  tax  measures \nwere  subject  to  somewhat  arbitrary  implementation,  and  the  government  has  accepted  that  going \nforward, \u201call taxation-related orders and instructions be enshrined in legislation\u201d (Vriens and Partners \n2013b,  p.  6).  In  2014,  legislation  was  enacted  with  the  aim  of  streamlining  administration  and \nbroadening the tax base, though the IMF expressed concerns that numerous exemptions reduced the \nsystem\u2019s  revenue  generation  potential  (IMF  2014a).  Public  records  indicate  that  Myanmar\u2019s  largest \nfirms have stepped up tax payments (Vriens and Partners 2014). \n \nA. \n\nProperty Rights and Factor Markets \n \n\nMyanmar  is  sometimes  described  as  a  \u201ctransitional  economy\u201d  and  lumped  together  with  neighbors \nsuch  as  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  reality  is  more  complex,  however.  Private  property \nrights  are  delineated  and  nationalization  prohibited  under  the  constitution.  And  unlike  its  neighbors, \nnominally private businesses, not state-owned enterprises, are already at the center of the economy. \nBut these entities may reflect deep state connections, either as former SEEs with implicit expectations \nof bailouts if they run into difficulties, or are simply controlled by politically connected cronies. State \ninfluence is more profound than notional figures on private sector activity would suggest.  \n\n \n1. \n \n\nThe Land Market \n\nThe  land  market  remains  problematic.  Constitutionally,  all  land  is  residually  owned  by  the  state \n(Steinberg  2013b).  Historically,  the  state  or  politically  connected  entities  have  exercised  eminent \ndomain  in  what  some  have  described  as  arbitrary  \u201cland-grabbing.\u201d  Land  ownership  registries  are \ninadequate,  and  as  McKinsey  has  observed,  \u201cif  disputes  arise  over  land,  Myanmar  currently  has  no \nmeaningful  recourse  and  no  national  legal-aid  program  to  ease  access  to  the  justice  system\u201d \n(McKinsey Global Institute 2013, p. 77).

In  February \n2014, a 15-member Anti-Corruption Commission was formed, but as of November 2014, the composition and functioning \nof this body remain under discussion. \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   11 \n\nand  tenure\u2014have  been  lauded  for  comprehensiveness  (Binns  and  Dale  1995)  but  are  likely  to  be  of \nlimited use in establishing current property rights and appropriate valuation.11 \n\n \nThe  land  dispute  issue  is  particularly  sensitive  insofar  as  the  military\u2019s  prominence  in  alleged \nland-grabbing.  A  parliamentary  commission  calculated  that  since  1988,  the  military  has  seized  nearly \n100,000 hectares. In June 2013, the press reported that the Minister of Defense, Brigadier General Wai \nLwin, promised to return confiscated land that was not being used, or about 8% of the disputed property. \nThere  are  now  disputes  over  the  definition  of  \u201cuse\u201d  and  claims  that  the  military  rushed  to  construct \nimprovements  to  demonstrate  the  land  was  under  use  (Vriens  and  Partners  2013a,  2013b,  2013c). \nBeyond the obvious commercial stakes, this particular aspect of the land issue is likely to take a long time \nto sort out, insofar as it turns on the image of the military and its relationship to the broader society, as \nwell as military practices such as requiring soldiers to grow their own food. The government has formed a \nCentral Land Management Committee and set a 1-year deadline for resolving 745 targeted disputes. \n\n \nThe Farmland Law (2012), while representing progress, is inadequate. The law allows farmers use \nrights (though not for the extraction of subsoil minerals).  The bill strengthens protection of farmers from \n\u201cland  grabbing\u201d  by  private  entities,  while  maintaining  the  government\u2019s  right  to  exercise  the  principle  of \neminent  domain  in  exchange  for  \u201csuitable  compensation\u201d  (Nehru  2013,  p.  11).    In  other  low-income \ncountries where farmers have been given the right to \u201cpermanently transfer\u201d their user rights or the right to \nsell land, \u201cland ownership concentration has increased dramatically, creating large numbers of landless and \nexacerbating poverty\u201d (Nehru 2013, p. 11). It is claimed that, \u201cDespite the passage of a new land law by the \nparliament, people in Myanmar are still being unfairly displaced by large businesses and agricultural projects \nwithout adequate compensation or means of providing a livelihood. This is largely a legal matter, in which \nthe law itself still allows sizeable tracts of land to be seized\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 11). Ultimately, \nthe solution is not simply more efficient legal systems, but more systematic programs to ensure that large-\nscale development projects are adequately inclusive and address the legitimate interests and needs of local \nresidents,  and  that  those  residents  are  afforded  stable  land  rights  that  are  not  subject  to  abrogation  by \npolitically connected interests. A new draft Land Use Law was unveiled in October 2014. \n\n \nThe use (and misuse) of forest land is also an issue.  According to Woods (2013), Myanmar\u2019s \n\ntimber land can be categorized in five ways: \n\ni.  State-managed (Myanmar Timber Enterprise) forests; \nii.  Logging concessions in natural forest, most in ethnic minority populated areas;  \niii.  Land  conversion  in  natural  forests,  also  occurring  in,  though  not  limited  to,  areas  of  ethnic \n\nconflict; \n\niv.  A limited number of tree plantations; and  \nv.  Community forests where commercial logging is prohibited.  \n\n \nThe last category is the only one in which  local communities  have legal land or resource use \n\nrights, and not surprisingly, logging activities have been subject to considerable internal controversy.12  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11  \n\nIn October 2013, the Yangon Region Revenue Department began using fixed appraisal rates to collect taxes on local land \ntransactions.  The  policy  was  introduced  in  part  to  confront  the  phenomenon  of  grossly  underreporting  sales  prices  in \norder to avoid property taxes, which are linked to the buyer\u2019s ability to document his or her income source.  Buyers who \nobtained their income through illicit activities would report transaction prices that could be justified on the basis of licit \nearnings alone (Vriens and Partners 2013c). \n\n12   The exportation of timber is also subject to controversy, as taken up below. \n\n \n\n\f12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nIn  this  context,  the  controversy  over  the  Letpadaung  copper  mine  could  provide  a  salutary \nlearning  moment.  The  March  2013  parliamentary  commission  report  which  attempted  to  address \nvarious stakeholder interests could form a model for other such disputes, calling for \u201cadequate social \nand  environmental  safeguards  from  companies,  transparency  in  the  conduct  of  the  project,  proper \ncompensation  for  local  people  who  have  been  displaced,  adequate  provisions  for  their  future \nlivelihoods,  preservation  of  local  cultural  and  religious  sites  where  appropriate,  and  training  for  local \npopulations to provide the skills needed to work on the project\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 12). \n\n \nLikewise,  there  are  issues  with  respect  to  urban  or  industrial  use  land.    The  government  has \nestablished  18  industrial  parks  in  nine  states  and  regions  under  the  auspices  of  the  Industrial \nDevelopment  Committee  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Industry  No.  2  (Min  and  Kudo  2012,  McKinsey \nGlobal  Institute  2013).  Investors  have  complained  of  bottlenecks,  however,  with  regard  to  lack  of \navailable land for industrial development, and the high price of unimproved land in these estates (Pun \n2012,  Min  and  Kudo  2012).  It  has  been  estimated  that  only  20%  of  the  land  in  the  existing  zones  is \ncurrently used for industrial production; the other 80% is used for activities, such as warehousing, or is \nunused altogether.  \n\n \nIt would appear that to spur industrial development, the state should lease land at competitive \nrates to anyone who will build a factory and provide employment; the land could revert to the state if \nthe  factory  closed.  Concurrent  with  these  new  leases,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Revenue  should \nconduct a comprehensive land survey\u2014security conditions permitting\u2014in order to establish a current \ncadaster map of the country\u2019s territory and promote transparency in land use and tenure. \n\n \n2. \n \n\n3. \n \n\nThe Labor Market \n\nThe state has enacted or is considering a number of major pieces of labor reform legislation. One of \nthese is the Settlement of Labor Dispute Law (2012), which replaces the Trade Disputes Act (1929). It \nsafeguards  workers\u2019  rights  and  establishes  procedures,  including  conciliation  and  arbitration  for  the \norderly settlement of labor relations disputes.  \n \n\nThe Capital Market \n\nAlthough there are ongoing efforts to establish direct capital markets (and indeed a tiny stock market \nopened in October 2014), it is safe to assume that for the foreseeable future, enterprises in Myanmar \nwill continue to rely primarily on a bank-dominated system of indirect finance.  \n \n\nThe  banking  system  consists  of  four  state-owned  banks  which  have  their  origins  in  a \nmonobank system under the socialist regime, and 19 private banks established in the 1990s when the \nFinancial  Institutions  Law  (1990)  permitted  the  creation  of  private  banks  (Mieno  2013).  There  is \ncurrently  no  foreign  operational  banking  presence,  though  the  government  is  in  the  process  of \nfinalizing regulations that will permit entry via joint ventures with local banks, and some foreign banks \nhave begun establishing representative offices (IMF 2013).  \n\n \nMany  of  the  private  banks  are  subsidiaries  of  large  conglomerates.    Such  an  arrangement, \n\nwhere industrial conglomerates own private banks, has proved to be problematic in other settings.   \n\n \nThe state-owned banks and private banks each account for roughly half of bank assets. Of the \nfour state banks, Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) is by far the largest, accounting for more than 40% \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   13 \n\nof the sector\u2019s assets. So in reality, the banking system could be described as a single bank dominant \nsystem with a fringe of much smaller competitors. \n\n \nBanking  regulations  have  historically  been  restrictive,  including  a  ban  on  private  lending  to \nfarmers, outmoded quantitative limits on deposit and loan rates implying negative interest rates, a ban \non  the  provision  of  uncollateralised  credit,  a  ban  on  \u201cat  call\u201d  deposits,  which  are  used  for  liquidity \nmanagement  in  most  other  banking  systems,  and  a  ban  on  deposit  withdrawals  from  the  Myanmar \nAgricultural Development Bank (MADB), which unsurprisingly discourages new deposits.  \n\n \nThe  situation  is  changing,  however.  The  IMF  reports  that  the  country\u2019s  eligible  collateral  has \nbeen  expanded  to  include  agricultural  exportables,  deposit  rates  have  been  liberalized  within  a  fixed \nband,  and  the  MADB  has  increased  credit  limits  to  farmers.    The  banks  are  opening  more  branches, \nand  new  technologies,  such  as  credit  cards  and  automatic  teller  machines,  are  being  introduced.  \nTherefore, it would appear that access to banking, at least for the urban middle class, is improving.  \n\n \nApart  from  the  debilitating  affect  that  the  atrophied  state  of  the  banking  sector  has  on \ndevelopment, the lack of financial inclusion could contribute to undesirable long-term political economy \ndevelopments. Groups, either with access to capital outside the local banking sector, notably the ethnic \nChinese minority, or with privileged access to finance, such as the military, may come to dominate the \nprivate sector economy and the emergent middle class.  Such a development and its implied blunting of \nsocioeconomic mobility could become a source of tension (Steinberg 2013a, 2013b).  \n\n \nIn August 2014, nine foreign banks were issued licences to operate. The licences require $75 \nmillion  investment  and  restrict  the  foreign  banks  to  a  single  branch  offering,  only  lending  in  foreign \ncurrencies to foreign companies and local banks. In the words of one commentator, \u201cthe restrictions \nare  aimed  both  to  protect  the  local  financial  services  sector  and  to  encourage  the  transfer  of \nknowledge and best practices by encouraging foreign-local cooperation\u201d (Gallucci 2014), and the on-\nlending to local banks may create a potential for local firms to access foreign banks through syndicated \nloans (Turnell 2014).     \n\nB. \n\n \nCorporate Governance  \n \n\nGiven the state domination of the financial sector and the ubiquity of SEEs and politically connected \nenterprises in the economy, corporate governance in Myanmar has been historically problematic. The \nbasic issue is that the SEEs were not subjected to hard budget constraints, and benefitted from capital \nchannelling  by  the  state-dominated  banking  sector,  provisions  of  subsidies,  and  dispensation  from \npaying taxes (Kubo 2012). However, recent reforms should mitigate, if not terminate, such practices.  \n\n \nExchange rate reforms have been important in this regard. With the introduction of a managed \nfloat  in  April  2012,  the  reference  rate  has  converged  on  the  previously  unofficial  market  rate, \neliminating the implicit subsidization of the SEEs that occurred via the old exchange rate mechanism \n(Kubo  2012,  Mieno  2013).  President  Thein  Sein  has  proposed  that  the  SEEs  stop  receiving  explicit \nsubsidies and begin paying taxes, as comparable private enterprises do (Min 2013). \n\n \nThe issue of soft budget constraints is a deeper problem, however. Kubo (2012) argues that the \nintegration of the SEEs into the state budget through the State Fund Account (SFA) actually worsened \nthe problem, and that resolving the issue requires the abolition of central planning of prices, production, \nand  distribution  of  goods  and  services  that  the  SEEs  provide.  \u201cThe  necessary  reforms  include  the \nseparation of the SEEs from the state budget as well as the abolition of price controls, and the implicit \n\n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\ncross-subsidies in the state sector.\u201d (Kubo 2013, p. 26).  From 2013\u20132014, profitable SEEs are expected \nto self-finance working capital, while the state will continue to finance 20% of the working capital of loss-\nmaking SEEs.  This represents a move toward greater financial autonomy for the SEEs insofar as the state \nfinanced 78% of the working capital of these enterprises previously (IMF 2013). \n\n \nHowever,  in  February  2011,  just  before  the  military  junta  left  office,  there  was  a  massive \nprivatization  of  state  assets,  which  some  observers  likened  to  a  \u201cfire  sale\u201d  (e.g.,  Kubo  2012).  As  a \nconsequence,  the  soft  budget  constraint  issue  may  now  manifest  in  a  different  form,  similar  to  that \nobserved  with  respect  to  the  Government  Supervised  Agencies  (GSAs)  at  the  heart  of  the  2007\u2013\n2008 financial crisis in the United States (US). The problem is one of moral hazard, where ostensibly, \nprivate enterprises engage in risky behavior because they believe themselves to be indemnified against \nlosses  due  to  their  political  connections.  Specifically,  the  expectation  is  that,  these  now  nominally \nprivate enterprises, in many cases controlled by former officials, could seek help from the government \nafter making bad investments, thus increasing the likelihood that bad investments would be made; or, \nsimilarly, banks may infer that the government is likely to bail out bad loans made to the former SEEs \nand thus not scrutinize borrowing carefully. The situation in Myanmar is made worse by the fact that \nthe banks themselves may be connected through ownership to the borrower.  \n\n \nMoreover, the simple privatization of such entities without any regulatory oversight may create \nthe conditions for implicit monopolies, oligopolies, and rampant rent-seeking. Such developments may \nbecome particularly pernicious in the nontraded sector, as the external opening of the economy and \nintegration into ASEAN bring greater competition to the relatively undeveloped traded-goods sector \nand  indigenous,  more  politically  connected  entrepreneurs  retreat  to  the  comparative  safety  of  the \nnontraded sector. \n \nBureaucratic Capacity  \n \n\nC. \n\nits \n\nBoth survey-based indicators of government effectiveness and official government revenue statistics \nsuggest Myanmar\u2019s bureaucracy is in need of reform and significant capacity building. The World Bank \nGovernance  Indicators  place  Myanmar  in  the  4th  percentile  in  terms  of  government  effectiveness, \nwhich  captures  \u201cperceptions  of  the  quality  of  public  services,  the  quality  of  the  civil  service  and  the \ndegree  of \nindependence  from  political  pressures,  the  quality  of  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation,  and  the  credibility  of  the  government's  commitment  to  such  policies\u201d  (Kaufman, \nKraay,  and  Mastruzzi  2010,  p.  4).  Revenue-generating  capacity  is  another  often-used  measure  of \nbureaucratic/administrative  capacity,  as  revenue  collection  requires  the  development  of  significant \ninfrastructure and human capital for collecting and managing information. Total government revenues \nin 2011 were estimated at only 12% of GDP, compared to a mean of 20.4% for the ASEAN-5 countries \n(Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam)  and  28.1%  for  emerging  market  and \nincreased \ndeveloping  economies  (IMF  2014b).  Since  then,  however,  revenue  collection  has \ndramatically, nearly doubling to 22.3% in 2013, putting it at par with ASEAN-5 countries (IMF 2014b).  \n\n \nMyanmar is emerging from a 25-year period of military rule, during which the State Peace and \nDevelopment  Council  (SPDC),  formerly  the  State  Law  and  Order  Restoration  Council  (SLORC), \nexercised control over all three branches of government. During this period, virtually all of the senior \npositions  in  line  ministries  were  staffed  by  generals  and  retired  military  officers.  Military  penetration \ninto  the  bureaucracy  extended  into  lower  levels  of  the  bureaucracy  as  well,  after  many  civilian \nbureaucrats were sacked due to their participation in antigovernment protests in 1988. These positions \nwere often given to regional military commanders who were folded, in large numbers, into the central \nadministration.  \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   15 \n\n \nThe militarization  of the  bureaucracy had three pervasive effects. The first was to produce a \nhighly  centralized  and  assertively  top-down  form  of  decision-making  and  policy  implementation. \nWhile all bureaucracies are hierarchical in nature, military hierarchies are unique in the degree to which \nthe chain of command is observed. The salient features of the chain of command are vertical lines of \ncommunication and accountability (orders flow down, feedback flows up), strict observance of orders, \nand  non-interference  in  other  units.  Each  has  practical  implications  for  the  functioning  of  line \nministries. Chains of command do not reward initiative by lower-level functionaries, who instead rely \non  top-down  direction.  Diversity  of  opinion  is  considered  divisive,  rather  than  potentially  innovative. \nBecause  information  must  flow  back  up  through  several  links  in  the  chain,  it  can  be  both  distorted \n(either intentionally or unintentionally) or quashed in order to avoid the appearance of unsatisfactory \nperformance.  \n \nThe  principal  of  non-interference  in  other  units  hampered  inter-ministerial  cooperation,  as \nlines of delegated authority were blurred and there was no clear mechanism for producing or carrying \nout  joint  policy  initiatives.  While  some  ministries  appear  to  collaborate  effectively\u2014the  Ministry  of \nNational Planning and Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance jointly harmonize capital \nand current budgeting\u2014other areas do not benefit from such collaboration. The Ministries of Energy \nand  Electrical  Power  are  currently  developing  separate  master  planning  documents  without  inter-\nministerial coordination. Education policy currently falls under the purview of at least a dozen different \nministries. While the Ministry of National Planning would be a potential agent for policy harmonization \nacross ministries, it has neither budgetary power nor a mandate to do so. \n\n \nThe second result of the militarization of the bureaucracy was the proliferation of ministerial \nappointments,  though  this  was  also  due  in  part  to  the  pursuit  of  a  centrally  planned  economy. \nMyanmar\u2019s  cabinet  is  comparatively  large,  consisting  of  30  line  ministries.  The  median  for  ASEAN \ncountries  is  19.5.13  There  is  a  general  negative  relationship  between  cabinet  size  and  government \neffectiveness,  with  a  significant  deterioration  of  government  effectiveness  once  the  threshold  of  20 \nline  ministers  is  passed  (Klimek,  Hanel,  and  Thurner  2009;  see  Figure  5).  As  ministries  proliferate,  it \nbecomes more difficult both to achieve collective decisions and to coordinate policy implementation \nacross ministries. Whether this is due to declining efficiency in collective decision-making, increasing \ntransaction costs of coordinating policy at the implementation stage, or both, has not been tested, but \nit is likely that both play a role. Also, more government ministries provide more government jobs, and \nthus more opportunities for staffing ministries as a form of political patronage. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13   As of 23 November 2014, per CIA (2014). \n\n \n\n\f16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nFigure 5: Larger Cabinets, Weaker Bureaucratic Effectiveness \n \n\nSingapore\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\n\nViet Nam\n\nLao PDR\n\nIndonesia\ny = \u20132.9781x + 115.13\n\nR2 = 0.3122\n\nCambodia\n\nMyanmar\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n \n,\ns\ns\ne\nn\ne\nv\ni\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\nE\n \nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n\n \nI\n\nG\nB\nW\ne\n\n \n,\n\nl\ni\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nNumber of line ministries, 2014\n\n \n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, WBGI = World Bank Governance Indicator. \nSources: World Bank 2014b, CIA 2014. \n\n \nThe third result was to homogenize the educational backgrounds and worldviews of mid- and \ntop-level bureaucrats. Of the 38 current14 line ministers and cabinet-level appointments, 23 are former \nmilitary officers. Many, if  not all, were trained at the Defense Services Academy (DSA),  which trains \nfuture  military  officers  for  all  three  branches  of  the  Tatmadaw.  While  this  service  academy  is  widely \nviewed as one, if not the, preeminent institution of higher learning in Myanmar, the prevalence of its \ngraduates  in  ministerial  positions  implies  that  most  ministers  share  a  common  formal  training  in  the \nnatural and social sciences. Whatever its merits, relying so heavily on a single educational institution to \nstaff  the  bureaucracy  risks  the  stifling  of  initiative  and  diversity  of  opinion.  The  success  of  DSA \ngraduates in climbing the ranks of both the military and the bureaucracy contributes to the perceptions \nthat the military is still the most reliable vehicle for advancement in the public sector. \n\n \nAt the sub-ministerial level, resource and staffing constraints are significant. Multiple ministries \nhave had their mandates grow much faster than their budgets. Bureaucratic pay remains low, despite \nsalaries having been increased by 20% in each of the last 2 years. Low public sector  salaries hamper \nattempts  to  recruit  \u201cthe  best  and  the  brightest\u201d  and  can  exacerbate  problems  with  corruption  (Van \nRijckeghem  and  Weder  2001).  Even  though  the  2013\u20132014  budget  includes  an  additional  23% \nincrease in public sector wages, this problem is likely to become more significant with the emergence \nof  the  private  sector  and  increasing  foreign  investment  (OECD  2013).  In  2012,  business  interests \nforecast an increase in wages for skilled workers of 20% to 50% for the next year, with wages for those \nworking for foreign firms potentially even higher.15 Nongovernment jobs have become relatively more \nattractive, making it more difficult for the government to recruit and retain productive workers. This is \n\n                                                 \n14   As of 23 November 2014. \n15   Eleven.  2012.  Salaries  of  skilled  workers  in  Myanmar  to  rise  up  to  50%.  22  October.  http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/ \nindex.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1038:salaries-of-skilled-workers-in-myanmar-to-rise-up-to-50&catid \n=33&Itemid=356 \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   17 \n\nespecially  in  those  ministries  that  rely  on  highly  sought-after  technical  skills,  such  as  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Revenue, which operates the Central Bank. \n\n \nOne  obvious  option  is  to  continue  raising  wages  in  the  public  sector,  a  strategy  successfully \nimplemented  by  Singapore  (Rahman  1986).  However,  wage  increases  may  not  by  themselves  be \nsufficient, for several reasons. First, wage increases that would be necessary to stamp out corruption \nand retain the most effective bureaucrats might be so large as to be impractical\u2014on the order of two \nto  eight  times  wages  in  the  manufacturing  sector  (Besley  and  McLaren  1993,  Van  Rijckeghem  and \nWeder  2001).  Second,  the  long-term  retention  effects  of  wage  increases  are  likely  to  be  eroded  by \ncontinued  growth  in  the  private  sector.  Third,  given  the  size  of  the  public  sector,  across-the-board \nwage increases could have undesirable inflationary effects. Moreover, general wage increases benefit \nboth highly productive and shirking employees alike, and may actually lower morale among the most \ntalented. \n \nDeveloping  country  governments  have  tried  a  variety  of  alternatives  to  build  longer-term \nallegiance  to  bureaucratic  careers  among  desirable  workers.  One  possibility  would  be  to  train  and \nconstruct  a  career  ladder  for  a  cadre  of  elite  civil  servants.  Career-based  elite  civil  services,  such  as \nthose  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Malaysia,  are  staffed  via  entry-level  recruitment  according  to \nperformance  on  an  elite  exam,  with  small  proportions  being  nominated  to  serve  from  within  the \nexisting civil service (World Bank 2012b). If successfully implemented, this would endow the Myanmar \ngovernment with a young, cohesive cohort of civil servants that could be induced to stay long-term by \ninformal  social  bonds.  While  this  would  be  attractive,  the  present  staffing  needs  of  the  Myanmar \ngovernment are such that it would likely need to be supplemented at the outset with recruitment from \nthe  broader  civil  service,  based  on  performance  reports.  These  elite  services  act  as  teams  within  the \nbroader bureaucracy and can be significant agents of change.  \n\n \nA  complementary  measure  would  be  to  place  greater  emphasis  on  delayed  rewards, \nestablishing  attractive  pensions  and  retirement  benefits,  such  as  subsidized  insurance.  This  strategy \nmay be advisable for two reasons. First, the deferment of benefits to late life means that the effect on \ncurrent expenditures need not be as large as with wage increases (Becker and Stigler 1974). Second, \nthese  types  of  benefits  would  have  minimal  impact  on  inflation,  as  they  would  not  entail  large \ninjections  of  cash  into  the  local  economy.  Another  option  would  be  to  reform  the  system  to  place \ngreater emphasis on rewarding performance. Implementing a two-tier salary structure, consisting of a \nbase wage and a variable wage that would be based on performance, would be one way of addressing \nthis issue. Finally, another option would be to enhance recruitment efforts aimed at those individuals \nwho are discriminated against in the  private labor market for reasons of disability, gender or religion. \nThese individuals can be recruited and retained at lower costs. This suggestion should not be taken as \nencouraging  discrimination,  but  rather  recognizing  that  it  exists  and  can  be  exploited  by  the  public \nsector.  Moreover,  a  diversification  of  the  civil  service  could  enhance  central  government  credibility \namong peripheral minority groups. \n\n \nPresident  Thein  Sein  designated  2013  as  the  year  for  public  sector  reform,  with  the  goal  of \nstreamlining the policymaking process, with the Ministries of National Planning and Finance intended \nto emerge as policy coordinators. This process resulted in the creation of inter-ministerial committees, \nincluding  the  National  Energy  Management  Committee  (NEMC)  and  the  Energy  Management \nCommittee  (EMC),  composed  of  representatives  of  the  Ministries  of  Energy,  Electric  Power, \nAgriculture and Irrigation, Environmental Conservation and Forestry, Industry, Mines, and Science and \nTechnology. While these bodies have a specific mandate to break down stovepipes in policy formation, \nthey lack independent secretariats. Whatever issues or policy initiatives emerge out of the committee \n\n \n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nmeetings  are  then  reassigned  to  the  independent  ministries  later.  Providing  these  units  with \nindependent  secretariats  would  be  a  useful  step  in  enhancing  policy  coordination.  ADB  is  providing \nsome support for the development of a 20-year, integrated energy master plan, but similar infusions of \nresources \u2013 and help with cross-ministry planning and coordination \u2013 would be welcome (ADB 2013). \nAt  the  national  level,  the  Ministry  of  National  Planning  should  be  tasked  with  coordinating  policy. \nPolicy coordination among a coordinating ministry and a line ministry is difficult enough; divvying up \nthe coordinating responsibilities between two ministries amplifies the associated problems. If planning \nand finance are so intimately linked that assigning the master planning role to one ministry would be \nunworkable, another model would be to merge the Ministries of National Planning and Finance. The \nRepublic  of  Korea  did  just  this  in  2008,  with  the  state  rationale  being  \u201cto  put  under  one  roof  fiscal \npolicy functions and inter-ministerial policy coordination\u201d (Ministry of Strategy and Finance 2010, IMF \n2010). \n\nimportant \n\n \nPolicy coordination between the central government, and state and regional governments will \nbe  an \nissue.  The  2008  constitution  established  state  and  regional \nincreasingly \ngovernments,16 each with the constitutional power to levy excise, land, and water taxes as well as toll \nfees and royalties on marine fisheries. Moreover, state and regional governments will be responsible for \nimplementing  central  government  directives  alongside  central  government  ministries.  Additional \nstaffing demands will be significant. The state and regional governments will form their own cabinets, \nwith ministers drawn from the elected state and regional Hluttaws, and subject to final approval by the \npresident. As at the national level, the Minister for Border and Security Affairs will be appointed by the \nCommander-in-Chief  of  the  Defense  Services.  However,  these  ministries  will  not  have  direct  power \nover  hiring  and  promotion  in  these  bureaucracies,  which  will  be  conducted  by  the  national  line \nministries.  This  blurs  the  lines  of  delegation,  with  bureaucrats  potentially  receiving  conflicting \ndirectives and assignments from national, and state- and regional-level ministers. Moreover, regional \nministers  will  be  fewer  in  number  than  line  ministries,  meaning  that  individual  regional  and  state \nministers will have to shoulder multiple portfolios with a single ministry\u2019s staff and resources (Nixon et \nal.  2013).  These  circumstances  are  ripe  for  an  increase  in  corrupt  practices,  as  blurred  lines  of \ndelegation complicate oversight.  \n \n \n\nIV.  \n\nENGAGING CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE PEACE PROCESS \n\nCivil Society \n \n\n \nA. \n \nSince  2011,  the  Myanmar  government  has  enacted  wide-ranging  reforms  that  should  support \ndevelopment of a more robust civil society, even if they fall short of guaranteeing true freedom of press \nand assembly. Press censorship has been eased by the abolition of the Press Scrutiny and Registration \nDivision.  Prior  to  its  abolition  in  2012,  all  newspaper  articles  were  subject  to  its  purview.  The  state\u2019s \nmonopoly  on  daily  print  media  has  ended  as  well.  As  of  1  April,  2013,  four  privately  owned  daily \nnewspapers  went \ninto  circulation,  though  private  newspapers  still  require  government-issued \npermits.17  These  reforms  have  been  noticed\u2014in  just  2  years  (2012\u20132014),  Myanmar  moved  from \n\n                                                 \n16   States  and  regions  are  equivalent.  The  term  state  applies  to  those  administrative  units  encompassing  regionally \nconcentrated ethnic minorities (Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan), while the regions are composed of \nmajority  Burman  areas  (Ayeyarwady,  Bago,  Magway,  Mandalay,  Sagaing,  Taninthyari,  and  Yangon).  The  capital, \nNaypyidaw, is administered as a union territory.  \n\n17   Sixteen separate newspapers were granted licenses by the Myanmar government. See Tun 2013.  \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   19 \n\n169th to 145th on Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index, putting it ahead of regional \ncomparators Malaysia and Viet Nam (Reporters Without Borders 2014). \n \n\nThe Law on Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession, enacted 5 July 2012, allows the right \nto  hold  peaceful  demonstrations  and  marches,  though  organizers  must  obtain  permission  5  days  in \nadvance  from  the  commander  of  the  relevant  Township  Police  Force.  Applications  are  not  to  be \ndenied unless they pose a threat to state security, the rule of law, or \u201cpublic tranquility,\u201d though these \nterms  are  left  without  precise  definition,  and  thus  regional  police  commanders  have  wide  latitude  in \ndetermining what constitutes a threat (Ministry of Home Affairs 2012). \n\n \nThe  Myanmar  National  Human  Rights  Commission  (NHRC)  was  empaneled  in  2011.  It  has \nissued repeated calls for the President to grant amnesty to political prisoners and exiles. Over 6,000 \nsuch  prisoners  were  released  on  11  October  2011  (NHRC  2011),  and  hundreds  of  political  dissidents \nhave  returned  from  abroad  after  the  government  removed  over  2,000  individuals  from  a  \u201cblacklist\u201d \nthat prohibited entry into the country. Nevertheless, the NHRC has thus far not investigated claims of \nhuman rights abuses in conflict zones, where conditions are likely much worse. \n\n \nA welcome sign has been an enhanced role for civil society in the policy formation and advising \nprocess.  As  discussed  above,  an  independent  think  tank,  the  Myanmar  Development  Resource \nInstitute  was  formed.  It  consists  of  three  components:  economics,  law,  and  security  and  political \naffairs.  This  group  has  been  tasked  with  acting  as  the  secretariat  in  Myanmar\u2019s  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency Initiative application (see the following section).  \n\n \nAs  Myanmar\u2019s  private  sector  develops,  opportunities  to  leverage  private  expertise  through \npublic-private partnerships (PPPs) should be expanded as well (ADB 2008). PPPs have been a widely \nused mechanism for developing infrastructure, particularly in the areas of telecommunications, power \ngeneration,  water  and  sanitation,  and  transportation.  Given  Myanmar\u2019s  needs  in  all  these  areas,  this \nmay be a mechanism for channelling private investment into the provision of public services. \n\n \n \nImprovements in communications infrastructure will help spur both economic growth and civil \nsociety.  As  of  2012,  only  one  out  of  100  Myanmar  people  had  internet  access,  and  telephone  lines \nwere similarly scarce. Cellular subscriptions, however, are up over 800% since 2010, with more than 5 \nmillion  cellular  subscribers  nationwide  (World  Bank  2013).  As  has  been  the  experience  in  other \ncountries,  the  expansion  of  communication  is  expected  to  have  both  economic  and  sociopolitical \neffects by facilitating communication among private citizens. \n \n\nWhile the long-term effects of a burgeoning civil society will likely be very positive, the opening \nof  political  space  for  private,  non-state  actors  is  not  always  an  unalloyed  blessing.  Independent  civil \nsocieties  can  and  will  mobilize  to  protest  reforms,  particularly  those  that  entail  the  withdrawal  of \nperceived benefits. Moreover, not all civil society actors are necessarily benevolent, which implies that \nthe  government  must  play  a  larger  role  in  punishing  and  deterring  such  violent  actions,  especially  as \nthey may have the potential to escalate. \n \nB. \n \nMyanmar\u2019s  past  history  of  unrest  has  been  a  significant  brake  on  economic  development.  While \ncountry-specific estimates are not feasible, Cerra and Saxena (2008) estimate the output loss from a \ncivil  war  in  low-income  countries  to  be  significant  (on  average,  6%),  and  higher  for  those  with \ncomparatively  weak  checks  on  executive  power.  Conflict  in  Myanmar  has  complicated  efforts  to \n\nPeace Process \n\n \n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\ncombat  narcotics  production,  illegal  mining  and  logging,  the  latter  of  which  constitutes  a  significant \nloss of both export and government revenue. More generally, concerns about political instability drive \ndown foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in nonresource sectors like light manufacturing.  \n \n\nOn September 10, 2013, Minister of the President\u2019s Office Aung Min met with members of the \nFederal  Council  to  discuss  plans  for  a  national  cease-fire  agreement.  If  successful,  it  could  pave  the \nway  to  a  more  comprehensive  peace  agreement.  However,  just  10  days  later,  the  UNFC  announced \nthat it would not accept the government\u2019s offer, in part due to continued fighting in Kachin and Shan \nstates.  Tensions  rose  further  in  November  2014  following  the  shelling  of  a  Kachin  training  facility, \nwhich resulted in the deaths of 23 Kachin Independence Army (KIA, the militant wing of the Kachin \nIndependence Organization); the action was condemned by the United Nationalities Federal Council. \nDespite  day-to-day  uncertainty,  these  most  recent  cease  fires  differ  significantly  from  those  of  the \npast.  The  most  recent  cease-fires  have  been  a)  written,  rather  than  verbal;  b)  openly  reported  by \nmedia  outlets,  meaning  that  public  awareness  of  the  cease-fires  has  been  significantly  enhanced;  c) \ninvolve  not  just  field  military  commanders,  but  delegates  of  the  highest  levels  of  the  civilian \ngovernment;  and  d)  explicitly  tackle  the  issue  of  armed-group  involvement  in  illicit  activities \n(Yawnghwe and Maung Than 2011).  \n\n \nWhile  these  are  positive  developments,  a  cease-fire  should  not  be  viewed  as  marking  the \ncessation of hostilities. Conflict could resume if the underlying issues that generated the conflicts are \nnot  addressed.  The  2010  constitution  began  the  process  of  transitioning  more  governance  roles  to \nregional  governments,  thereby  granting  minority  groups  greater  policy  autonomy.  However,  the \nstability of these ethno-federal and/or power-sharing arrangements is not guaranteed. Lijphart (1977), \nStepan  (1999),  Gurr  (2000)  all  argue  the  merits  of  decentralization,  either  via  federalism  or  some \npower-sharing  arrangement,  as  a  solution  to  rule  in  ethnically  divided  societies.  Power-sharing \narrangements are those that build in representation for various identity groups in order to insure that \ntheir  interests  are  represented  in  postconflict  governance  institutions.  Hartzell  and  Hoddie  (2003) \nfind  that  power-sharing  institutions  across  a  wide  range  of  areas\u2014economic,  military,  political,  and \nterritorial  autonomy\u2014are  associated  with  a  decreased  likelihood  of  return  to  conflict,  though  their \nfindings are based on small samples. \n\n \nThere  are  dissenting  views  as  well.  Brancati  (2006)  finds  that  ethno-federalism  reinforces \nethnic and regional identities and party cleavages, producing legislation that favors certain groups over \nothers, and mobilizing groups to engage in ethnic conflict and secessionism. Christin and Hug (2012) \nnote  that  this  tendency  is  strongest  when  ethnic  groups  are  highly  geographically  concentrated  \u2013  a \ncondition  that  definitely  obtains  in  Myanmar.  Alternately,  Bakke  and  Wibbels  (2006)  note  that  the \nstability  of  ethno-federal  arrangements  is  conditional  on  a  society\u2019s  level  of  economic  development \nand  ethnic  composition.  Alternately,  Roeder  and  Rothschild  argue  in  favor  of  power  dividing,  rather \nthan  power-sharing  arrangements  (Roeder  and  Rothschild  2005).  Power-dividing  institutions  stress \nthe  importance  of  multiple,  overlapping  majorities  and  checks  and  balances  as  well  as  universal \nprotection of civil liberties, and ethnic and religious identities. Roeder and Rothschild find that power- \ndividing, rather than power-sharing, institutions are associated with more robust peace following civil \nwars. \n\n \nWhatever the resolution of existing conflicts, further institutional reforms are likely necessary \nto  encourage  the  development  of  broad-based  political  parties  that  have  support  across  ethnic  and \nregional lines. The current electoral system, in which legislative candidates compete for a single seat \n(single  member  district  plurality,  or  SMDP)  within  relatively  ethnically  and  religiously  homogeneous \ndistricts,  does  not  encourage  politicians  to  seek  support  outside  of  their  own  group.  These  systems \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   21 \n\ntend to disproportionately reward large national parties and smaller parties with highly geographically \nconcentrated bases of support, such as the various regional parties, while underrepresenting smaller, \nless geographically concentrated parties. \n\n \nElectoral  systems  research  comes  up  with  three  classes  of  solutions:  closed-list  proportional \nrepresentation (PR); rules that require parties to run candidates across the country, rather than just in \nethnic homelands, as in Indonesia (Selway 2013); and preferential voting systems. In preference voting \nsystems, voters rank their preferences over candidates within their district (Reilly 2002). The idea is to \nencourage parties not just to campaign for first-place votes, but to court second-place votes as well, \npooling  votes  across  ethnic  lines  and  thus  decreasing  ethnic  identity  as  a  salient  driver  of  political \naffiliations.  Alternative  vote  is  a  single  member  district  system  that  requires  an  absolute  majority, \nrather  than  plurality;  if  an  absolute  majority  is  not  gained  in  the  first  round,  the  candidate  with  the \nlowest  number  of  first-place  votes  is  eliminated,  and  their  votes  are  distributed  to  the  remaining \ncandidates. Single transferable vote is a proportion system with multimember districts, with a \u201cquota\u201d \nof  votes  required  to  elect  a  single  candidate,  and  a  subsequently  similar  redistribution  of  remaining \nfirst-place  votes.  Either  of  these  reforms  would  help  to  reduce  the  salience  of  ethnic  identity  in \npartisan politics. \n \n \n\nV.  \n\nEXTERNAL POLICY ANCHORS AND THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES \n\nTRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE \n\n \n\nMyanmar  is  reforming  its  policies  and  practices  on  governance.  External  anchors  can  be  used  to \npromote  internal  reforms,  reinforce  credibility,  and  lock  in  commitments.  In  particular,  Myanmar\u2019s \ntransformation  is  occurring  in  the  context  of  a  massive  resource  boom.  The  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency  Initiative  (EITI)  and  other  international  anticorruption  efforts  can  be  used  to  deepen \nand strengthen Myanmar\u2019s ongoing efforts in this area. \n\nA. \n\n \nResource Development Context \n \n\nMyanmar  has  incredibly  rich  and  diverse  mineral  resources,  ranging  from  precious  stones  to  oil  and \nnatural gas.  The country  has an estimated 283 to 334 billion cubic meters of natural gas, with much \nhigher  reserve  potential,  along  with  50  million  barrels  of  crude  oil  reserves  (US  EIA  2013,  BP  2013). \nThe  country  has  90%  of  the  world\u2019s  jade  reserves.    A  strengthened  legal  framework,  streamlined \napprovals process, and a removal of export bans on certain minerals could induce billions of dollars of \nFDI inflows and transform the sector. \n \n\nIn addition to minerals, Myanmar exports considerable timber (perhaps more than 2.5 million \nm3),  though  assessing  the  true  volume  of  timber  exports,  as  in  the  case  of  semi-precious  stones,  is \nimpeded by the problem of illegal exports (Woods 2013).   \n\n \nEnergy  and  minerals  account  for  perhaps  half  of  exports,  and  FDI  has  been  overwhelmingly \ntargeted  at  the  mineral  and  natural  gas  sectors.  Sixty-one  companies,  including  Total,  Eni,  and  other \nlarge multinationals that are EITI stakeholders, have registered to bid on both onshore and 30 offshore \nblocks  in  2013;  20  more  offshore  oil  and  gas  blocks  were  auctioned  to  companies  including  Royal \nDutch Shell, Total and Statoil, with a further nine blocks to be auctioned in 2015. Pipelines to carry the \noil  and  gas  to  end  users  have  been  built  traversing  the  country,  including  through  areas  largely \ninhabited  by  ethnic  minorities,  and  protests  have  at  times  disrupted  the  operation  of  oil  and  gas \npipelines. \n\n \n\n\f22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\n \nAn  open  issue  is  whether  economic  and  political  institutions  are  capable  of  successfully \nmanaging  the  sudden  influx  of  wealth  this  mineral  boom  will  generate,  or  whether  the  wealth  will \ncomplicate  macroeconomic  management, \ninhibiting  development  of  nonenergy  sectors  and \ncomplicating the country\u2019s political reforms.  \n\n \nCountries whose wealth is heavily derived from the exploitation of natural resources tend to be \npoorer  and  grow  more  slowly  than  those  whose  wealth  is  based  on  the  accumulation  of  human  and \nphysical capital. However, the empirical literature  on the resource curse\u2014the tendency of resource-\ndependent  economies  to  grow  more  slowly  for  purely  economic  reasons,  such  as  resource  pulls  and \ncrowding  out,  Dutch  disease,  price  volatility,  etc.\u2014have  reached  consensus  that  these  economic \nphenomena  cause  only  slightly  negative  effects.  The  most  potentially  deleterious  effects  of  natural \nresource  wealth  on  economic  development  may  rather  operate  indirectly,  through  institutions  and \nconflict. \n \nDependence  on  high-value,  mined  commodities  has  negative  effects  for  bureaucratic  and \nstate capacity, and political violence\u2014all of which exert direct or indirect effects on economic growth. \nIt is perhaps no accident that the two countries with which Myanmar tied for last in the open budget \nindex  were  Qatar  and  Equatorial  Guinea,  two  oil  exporters.  However,  the  negative  effects  for \nbureaucratic capacity and political  violence\u2014the factors with the clearest implications for economic \ngrowth\u2014are found to be largely contingent on the quality of preexisting institutions and, in the case of \nconflict, certain attributes of the resources themselves.  \n\n \nWhether natural resource wealth leads to violence is largely a function of both attributes of the \nresource itself and the technology of its extraction, and the preexisting political, economic, and social \nenvironment.  Commodities  with  high  value-to-weight  ratios,  such  as  gemstones,  oil,  cocaine,  and \nopium  are  ideal  contestable,  or  \u201clootable,\u201d  goods,  and  indeed  the  gem  trade  has  fueled  some  of \nMyanmar\u2019s peripheral insurgencies for decades. \n\n \nWith  respect  to  hydrocarbons,  location  is  key.  The  relevant  distinction  is  onshore  versus \noffshore production. Onshore oil production increases the probability of conflict onset by 50% relative \nto the baseline risk, in contrast to offshore production, which has no effect. The differential effects of \nonshore  and  offshore  production  are  due  to  the  differential  opportunities  onshore  versus  offshore \nproduction created for rent-seeking by violent actors. Transporting onshore hydrocarbons to terminals \nfor  export  generally  requires  large,  aboveground  networks  of  pipelines.  This  onshore  infrastructure \ncreates  a  network  of  targets\u2014including  pipelines  and  the  workers  that  service  them\u2014only  a  few  of \nwhich can truly be hardened against attack. Deep-pocketed energy companies make attractive targets \nfor  insurgents,  who  may  have  limited  capacity  to  hold  and  defend  such  installations,  but  significant \ncapacity to extort. Myanmar\u2019s own experience with its pipeline through Shan state\u2014which has been \nsabotaged  by  insurgents  in  the  past\u2014shows  this  in  action.  In  contrast,  offshore  platforms  are \ncomparatively  easy  to  defend,  since  most  insurgent  groups  do  not  have  naval  capacity,  and  have \nlimited  capacity  to  extract  rents  from  offshore  production.  As  Myanmar\u2019s  production  transitions  to \nmore offshore gas fields, its gas infrastructure will be less prone to sabotage. \n\n \nMany seemingly resource-related conflicts have occurred in societies that would be among the \nmost likely candidates for conflict outbreak, even absent the role of contestable resources\u2014countries \nlike  Colombia,  Indonesia,  and  Myanmar  are  at  elevated  risk  of  experiencing  conflict  because  of  past \nhistories of violence, comparatively low levels of economic development, and horizontal inequalities. \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   23 \n\nFor  this  reason,  political  reforms  aimed  at  redressing  horizontal  inequalities\u2014such  as  those  between \nthe ethnic majority and minorities\u2014are vital. \n\nB. \n\n \nThe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \n \n\nPolicy concerns regarding the potentially negative institutional aspects of the resource curse fall into \ntwo  basic  categories.  The  first  revolve  around  fiscal  issues.  Proposed  solutions  typically  involve  the \nadoption  of  fiscal  policy  rules  (including  the  possibility  of  dedicating  or  earmarking  expenditures  for \nparticular  programs  with  the  expectation  that  this  will  generate  a  broad  political  constituency  for \ntransparency  and  accountability),  the  creation  of  natural  resource  fund  (NRF)  or  sovereign  wealth \nfunds (SWFs), and/or direct distribution of resource rents via cash transfers/dividends to the public, or \nwhat  has  been  called  \u201coil-to-cash.\u201d  Each  of  these  proposals  has  merits  and  drawbacks,  and  some \njudicious  mixture  of  all  three  (an  NRF  or  SWF,  earmarks  for  particular  programs,  and  dividend \npayments) may be ideal. However, what we focus on in this context, are institutional concerns, which \nare much more foundational to economic development than any specific policy intervention. \n\n \nOver  the  past  decade,  a  number  of  international  good  governance  initiatives  including  the \nKimberley Process Certification System (KPCS) and associated Diamond Development Initiative, the \nEITI,  and  the  Conflict  Minerals  Trade  initiative,  have  emerged  to  address  the  resource  management \nchallenges  described  in  the  previous  section.18  In  July  2014,  Myanmar  was  accepted  as  a  candidate \ncountry to the EITI.19 It is also pursuing a pilot project to push down EITI to the state level.  \n\n \nEITI works off of two components: disclosure, which is supposed to generate the information \nneeded to reduce corruption, and the establishment of country-level multi-stakeholder bodies, which \nin principle absorb and propagate this information with the aim of enforcing accountability.  \n\n \nThe  aim  of  the  first  component  is  to  build  double-entry  accounts  that  can  be  checked  for \nconsistency.  Governments  must  require  extractive  firms  operating  within  their  territory  to  disclose \npayments  to  governments  to  explore  or  extract  energy  or  minerals,  and  governments  must  record \nrevenues that they receive from extraction. A third-party independent administrator reconciles these \nfigures.  A  current  source  of  contention  is  whether  these  payments  are  aggregated  or  reported  on  a \ncompany-by-company  basis,  as  is  now  required  by  laws  in  the  US  and  the  European  Union  (EU). \nRoughly  half  of  EITI  member  countries  publish  only  aggregate  amounts;  the  other  half,  publish  their \nresults by company (Moran 2013).20 Myanmar can choose to make such reporting mandatory. \n\n \nThe  second  component  is  the  establishment  of  a  formal  multi-stakeholder  group  that \nevaluates  the  information  provided  by  the  firms,  the  government,  and  the  third-party  administrator. \nFinally,  an  outside  body  validates  the  reports  in  conjunction  with  the  stakeholder  group.    This  is \nsupposed to close a loop between the government and the governed.  \n\n \nThere are two tiers of countries in EITI: candidate countries that have signed up to implement \nthe  EITI  protocol,  and  compliant  countries  that  have  fully  and  successfully  implemented  EITI.  As  of \nNovember  2014,  there  are  31  compliant  countries,  17  candidate  countries,  8  stakeholder \n                                                 \n18   This  section  draws  on  Hendrix  and  Noland  (2014).    In  addition  to  the  initiatives  mentioned  above,  the  EU,  US,  and \nAustralia  all  maintain  their  own  regulations  on  the  importation  of  timber  from  Myanmar,  which  have  created  a  trade \nregime somewhat similar to the conflict minerals regulatory regime.  \n\n19   The US is also in the process of applying to EITI and has entered into a partnership with Myanmar to provide political and \n\ntechnical assistance to implement best practices in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. \n\n20   See Darby (2009) on the rationale for company-by-company disclosure. \n\n \n\n\f24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs),  more  than  80  supporting  companies,  more  than  80 \nsupporting institutional investors, and 21 stakeholder organizations, including ADB. Petrobras (Brazil) \nis  an  EITI  supporter,  but  other  large  non-Western  oil  companies  such  as  China  National  Petroleum \nCompany, Lukoil (Russian Federation), and Petronas (Malaysia) are not.21 \n\n \nWhile  EITI  was  originally  oriented  toward  the  oil  sector,  several  signatories  produced  other \nminerals and were not primarily oil producers. EITI is being expanded to include fisheries and forestry \nin  some  countries.  There  is  no  reason,  for  example,  that  Myanmar  cannot  also  apply  EITI  to  the \nproduction of timber, and not just oil, gas, and minerals.22  \n\n \nThe  effectiveness  of  EITI  is  in  significant  part  a  function  of  the  degree  of  buy-in  by  host \ngovernments. The pact is voluntary. A government committed to behaving corruptly may simply not \nparticipate.  There  is  no  mechanism  for  directly  sanctioning  noncompliance,  though  there  may  be \nreputational or signaling costs.23 EITI focuses on a single point in the production chain (the transfer of \nmoney  from  the  firm  to  the  government)  and  ignores  critical  upstream  stages  (contracting  and \nprocurement) and downstream activities (expenditure). \n\n \nThe  stakeholder  body  is  also  potentially  a  point  of  weakness,  depending  on  the  preexisting \nstrength  of  civil  society  and  on  the  attitude  of  the  government.  EITI  creates  a  platform  for \ncommunication  between  the  government,  the  companies,  and  civil  society,  and  establishes  a  set  of \ninternationally  accepted  norms  and  procedures.  But  in  other  countries,  particularly  those  that  have \nrecently transitioned from more autocratic forms of rule, the press and the NGO sectors remain weak, \nmaking  effective  civil  society  participation  difficult.  And  in  some  countries,  the  government  literally \nappoints the stakeholder representatives, allowing it to pack the body with cronies who may have little \ninterest  in  rocking  the  boat.  Similarly,  EITI  may  serve  as  a  spur  to  national  legislation  to  strengthen \nregulation of the extractive sector.  \n\n \nOne  barrier  to  implementation  has  been  a  simple  lack  of  accounting  expertise.  The  NGOs \nPublish What You Pay and Transparency International train budget activists, and the Revenue Watch \nInstitute has developed educational materials for journalists and civil society groups. The World Bank \nhas launched an \u201cEITI++\u201d program that assists host governments from the initial bid tendering stage \nthrough expenditure management. The ability of these initiatives for fostering civil society, as distinct \nfrom  providing  technical  assistance  to  functioning  civil  society  groups,  is  unclear.  Ultimately,  EITI  is \nonly  as  effective  as  there  are  mechanisms,  including  a  free  press,  which  allows  citizens  to  exert \naccountability over their government. In this regard, Myanmar\u2019s recent moves toward greater budget \ntransparency,  and  enhanced  civil  and  political  freedoms,  including  critically,  press  freedoms,  make  it \nmore likely that EITI can function successfully as intended in Myanmar. \n\n \nProducers  from  nonsignatory  countries  are  steadily  becoming  entangled  in  the  regime.  One \nprong  is  EITI  itself\u2014as  more  countries  begin  implementing  EITI,  and  validation  standards  tighten, \nmore and more companies will be subject to host government pressure to participate.  \n\n                                                 \n21   See EITI website.  http://eiti.org/supporters/companies(accessed 20 November 2014). \n22   Myanmar has a legal regime for timber exports requiring certification by Myanmar Timber Enterprise and exportation via \nthe port of Yangon. Neighboring importing countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand, also have laws \nprohibiting  the  importation  of  illegal  Myanmar  timber.  However,  the  enforcement  of  these  laws  is  ineffective,  and \nimproper certification of illegally logged timber has created problems exporting to the EU and the US (Woods 2013).  \n23  For  example,  Rex  Tillerson,  Exxon  Mobil  CEO,  subsequently  argued  that  host  country  adherence  to  EITI  signals  a \ncommitment  to  strengthen  the  business-enabling  environment,  and  for  example,  encouraged  Equatorial  Guinea  to  join \n(Aaronson 2011). (The country began the implementation process but was delisted in 2010.) \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   25 \n\n \n\nThe  other  prong  consists  of  laws  and  regulations  in  the  US,  the  EU,  and  other  jurisdictions. \nForeign firms listing on US stock exchanges must observe US law, which embodies increasing rigor with \nrespect to transparency and disclosure.24 Companies are expected to begin reporting in 2015\u20132016.25 \n\n \nIn the case of the EU, the European Commission proposed one set of rules in June 2012, but \nthe  European  Parliament  passed  stricter  regulations  in  September  2012.  After  consultations,  in  April \n2013,  the  European  Parliament  overwhelmingly  passed  legislation  going  further  than  Dodd-Frank, \nrequiring  resource  companies  to  publish  total  payments,  taxes  on  profits  or  production,  royalties \ndividends,  bonuses,  related  fees,  and  payments  for  infrastructure  improvements,  for  any  project \ngenerating  more  than  \u20ac100,000  in  revenues.  Together,  the  US  and  the  EU  regulations  would  cover \nabout  70%  of  value  in  global  extractive  industries.  As  of  November  2014,  an  Extractive  Sector \nTransparency  Measures  Act,  supported  by  Canadian  Prime  Minister,  Stephen  Harper,  is  before  the \nCanadian parliament.    \n\n \nBribery  of  public  officials  is  broadly  illegal  throughout  the  world  due  to  the  1977  Foreign \nCorrupt  Practices  Act  (FCPA),  which  American  authorities  have  applied  extraterritorially,  and  the \ncounterpart 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International \nBusiness Transactions,26 and similar national and regional laws passed since (Danielsen and Kennedy \n2011). So, for example, Britain\u2019s 2010 Bribery Act goes farther than FCPA, making it illegal to receive a \nbribe  or  bribe  private  officials,  but  also  contains  an  adequate  preventative  measures  provision  that \nwould  appear  to  make  it  marginally  easier  for  a  defendant  to  insulate  itself  legally  from  the  profit \nmaximizing malfeasance of its employees and agents (Rose-Ackerman 2010, Danielsen and Kennedy \n2011).  \n\n \nThe oil and gas sector appears to be especially prone to bribery (Weisman 2008, Sanyal 2012 \nTable 1). There is some statistical evidence that the US anticorruption enforcement officials may act \naltruistically, imposing proportionately greater fines for violations committed in low-income countries \n(Choi and Davis 2012). Whether employees of SEEs and SWFs count as \u201cforeign officials\u201d under FCPA \nis an unresolved issue that may take on greater salience in the future (Rose 2012). So, for example, if \nthe  management  of  Myanmar  SEEs  are  defined  as  \u201cforeign  officials\u201d  for  the  purposes  of  the  US  law, \nthen bribery involving management of Myanmar SEEs by firms falling under the jurisdiction of the  \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n24   According to Moran (2012), in 2012 the Hong Kong Stock Exchange adopted similar rules.  \n25   The  American  Petroleum  Institute  filed  a \n\nlawsuit  to  block  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) \nimplementation of Section 1504. The industry position is that subjecting the US and the EU firms to these requirements \nwould  create  an  unleveled  playing  field  with  respect  to  their  non-Western  competitors,  and  that  the  disclosure \nrequirement  could  conflict  with  confidentiality  agreements  required  by  some  host  governments,  including  Angola, \nCameroon, the PRC, and Qatar, effectively requiring firms to break either the law of the US and/or the EU, or the law of \ntheir  hosts.  The  US  and  the  EU  laws  assert  their  primacy  in  this  situation.  In  July  2013,  the  US  District  Court  for  the \nDistrict  of  Columbia  ruled  in  favor  of  the  oil  companies,  accepting  the  industry\u2019s  argument  that  the  payment  reports \nshould go to the SEC privately and not be made public. The court sent the regulations back to the SEC for revision. What \nmay be revised, and what, if any, impact the court ruling might have for developments in the EU, Canada, and elsewhere \nare unclear at this writing. Large US firms such as Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, and CononoPhilips would still be covered under \nthe stricter EU laws since they list on European stock exchanges. \n\n26  This  convention  has  been  ratified  by  all  members  of  the  OECD  as  well  as  six  non-member  countries--Argentina,  Brazil, \nBulgaria, Colombia, Russian Federation, and South Africa. Enforcement is via national law, with a peer-review mechanism \nto encourage diligence.  \n\n \n\n\f26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n\nFCPA would be subject to prosecution in the US.27 This is a potentially powerful tool for anticorruption \nactivities within Myanmar, insofar as Myanmar authorities could appeal to counterparts in the US, the \nEU,  and  other  jurisdictions  with  strong  antibribery  statutes,  for  assistance  in  investigation  and \nprosecutions. So, for example, the government of Ghana successfully enlisted the US Department of \nJustice  participation  in  an  investigation  into  corruption  in  that  country\u2019s  oil  industry  that  involved  a \nfirm located in the US. \n\n \nUltimately, the effectiveness of EITI and other good governance initiatives to generate better \ndevelopment outcomes in the long run is conditioned on a number of political and institutional factors, \nsuch as the existence of a free press and a robust civil society. Myanmar is making progress in these \nareas, though progress in these spheres is not plausibly under the control of the agencies implementing \nEITI  and  related  initiatives.  This  simply  underscores  the  need  for  a  holistic  approach  to  addressing \nthese multifaceted concerns. \n \n \n\nVI.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \nThe  government  of  Myanmar  faces  important  decisions  that  will  determine  the  future  trajectory  of \ngovernance  reform,  and  condition  long-run  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Since  2010,  the  pace  of \nreform  has  been  nothing  short  of  stunning,  yet  significant  challenges  remain.  While  the  agenda  for \ncontinued  reform  is  extensive,  we  identify  the  following  agenda  items  as  crucial  for  enhancing \ngovernment effectiveness and locking in recent gains in this area: \n \n\ni.  Enhancing  bureaucratic  salaries  and  diversifying \n\ntargeting \nunderrepresented  groups  and  those  likely  to  face  some  discrimination  in  the  private  labor \nmarket. \n\nthe  candidate  pool  by \n\nii.  Developing an elite cadre of senior civil servants as a desirable career path. \niii.  Streamlining the number of line ministries, cutting their number roughly in half, while shifting \nstaffing  to  inter-ministerial  coordinating  secretariats.  In  particular,  the  government  should \nconsider  merging  the  Ministries  of  National  Planning  and  Finance  in  order  to  unite  strategic \nplanning and budgeting under one ministry. \n\niv.  Achieving a comprehensive cease-fire with various armed groups. \nv.  Reforming  electoral  law  to  encourage  development  of  more  national  parties,  either  by \nrequiring  parties  to  run  candidates  in  all  constituencies  or  by  introducing  some  form  of \npreference voting. \n\nvi.  Increasing  involvement  of  the  private  sector  (private  industry,  think  tanks,  and  independent \n\neducational institutions) in the policy formation process. \n\nvii.  The Ministry of Finance and Revenue should conduct a comprehensive land survey\u2014security \nconditions permitting\u2014in order to establish a current cadaster map of the country\u2019s territory \nand promote transparency about land use and tenure. \n\n                                                 \n27 The trend is clearly toward ratcheting up disclosure requirements for a broad swath of producers. For example, all four of \nthe  PRC\u2019s  major  oil  companies  have  foreign  operations  and  all  are  listed  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  (therefore \nsubject  to  FCPA).  Many  of  the  PRC\u2019s  major  extractive  firms  are  in  joint  ventures  with  Western  multinationals,  such  as \nTotal, BP, and  BHP Billiton, and thus are included in these operations by extension, though as Moran (2012) observes, \nthere  may  be  significant  gaps  with  respect  to  coverage  of  non-Western  producers.  Moran  (2012,  2013)  notes  that  a \nnumber of major Russian, Chinese, and Indian oil and mining companies do not list in New York or Hong Kong, China and \nthus  would  not  be  subject  to  EITI  via  those  channels.  The  regulations  also  do  not  apply  to  foreign  issuers  of  American \ndepository receipts such as Lukoil and Gazprom. \n\n\fMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   27 \n\nviii. Economic research reviewed in this chapter has demonstrated the link between rule of law and \nthe control of corruption with economic growth.  This implies using EITI as a means to leverage \nMyanmar\u2019s  indigenous  good  governance  efforts  in  the  extractive  sector,  and  more  broadly, \nexploit  opportunities  to  anchor  broader  policy  reforms,  including  anticorruption  efforts,  to \ninternational best practices.  \n\n \n\nSpecifically, in implementing EITI, Myanmar can \n \ni. \nrequire company by company disclosure; \nii.  extend EITI to oil, gas, minerals, and timber; \niii.  look favorably on bids by EITI stakeholder firms committed to transparency; and \niv.  participate in EITI+ and EITI++, extending the transparency initiative upstream to contracting \n\nand procurement, and downstream to expenditure. \n \nLikewise,  a  similar  set  of  arguments  hold  for  foreign  anticorruption  statutes,  such  as  the  US \nFCPA, more broadly.  Specifically, the government of Myanmar should look favorably on bids by firms \nbased  in  jurisdictions  with  strong  antibribery  laws  and  enforcement,  thereby  \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d  on  the \nmore  rigorous  standards  of  foreign  partners;  if  firms  that  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  those \ngovernments  (whether  they  be  headquartered  in  that  country  or  not),  while  in  Myanmar,  engage  in \npotential violations of the foreign country\u2019s anticorruption laws, then the government of Myanmar can \nappeal  to  the  foreign  government  for  support  in  prosecuting  corrupt  activity.  When  evaluating \npotential  foreign  participants  in  resource  extraction,  the  government  of  Myanmar  should  take  into \naccount  whether  those  firms  are  subject  to  the  laws  of  the  US,  the  EU,  or  other  jurisdictions  with \nstrong antibribery laws and histories of extraterritorial legal cooperation, and give preference to those \nfirms  (regardless  of  nationality)  whose  behavior  in  Myanmar  will  be  constrained  by  anticorruption \nstatutes elsewhere. In short, Myanmar should use international initiatives, such as EITI and FCPA, to \nleverage its own reform efforts while building its own indigenous institutional capacity.   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAaronson, S.

These transitions coincide with a resource-led economic \nboom. The paper assesses the current status and performance of governance institutions in comparison \nto ASEAN and selected other countries. Specifically, the paper discusses outstanding problem areas \nrelated to economic governance, particularly in the legal system, the business regulatory framework, and in \nbureaucratic capacity. It also touches on Myanmar\u2019s initiation into the Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative (EITI) process to strengthen Myanmar\u2019s ongoing reform effort.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.6 billion people who live on less than $2 \na day, with 733 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\nMyAnMAr: Cross-CuttinG\n\nGovernAnCe ChAllenGes\n\nCullen Hendrix and Marcus Noland\n\nno. 428\n\nmarch 2015\n\nadb economics\n\nworking paper series\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ADB Economics Working Paper Series \n", " \n \nMyanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges \n \n \nCullen Hendrix and Marcus Noland \n", " \n", "No. 428   |   2015 \n", "Cullen Hendrix (Cullen.Hendrix@du.edu) is Assistant \nProfessor of Korbel School of International Studies, \nUniversity of Denver and Nonresident Senior Fellow at \nthe Peterson Institute for International Economics. \nMarcus Noland (MNoland@PIIE.COM) is Executive \nVice President and Director of Studies of Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics and Senior Fellow \nat the East-West Center. \n \nThis was a background paper for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Myanmar Country \nDiagnostics Study.
