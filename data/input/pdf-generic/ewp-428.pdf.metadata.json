INTRODUCTION \n \nGood governance, or efficient and transparent conduct of public affairs and management   of public \nresources, is more fundamental to economic development than any specific policy intervention. Good \ngovernance can be thought of as the creation of an environment in which beneficial policy can be \nformulated and implemented in a socially inclusive manner. Governance is an inherently multifaceted \nconcept that encompasses both formal rules and norms governing the conduct of public affairs. \nBroadly speaking, it can be broken into three basic baskets: the legal and regulatory framework, \nbureaucratic and administrative capacity, and government transparency/engagement with civil society.  \n \nWithout good governance, countries fail to unlock the full potential of their human and natural \ncapital. For society to make productive investments in human and physical capital, it needs assurances \nthat these investments will not be expropriated\u2014directly or indirectly--and that contracts will be \nenforced by independent, nonpartisan courts, even when it is not in the short-term interest of the \ngovernment for them to do so.1 Moreover, these assurances are particularly valuable for courting \ninvestment  from  firms  in  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD) \ncountries and investment in the nonresource sector, whose development will be crucial for balancing \nMyanmar\u2019s export profile and providing employment opportunities. For markets to truly flourish, the \ngovernment  must  be  able  to  efficiently  provide  market-sustaining  public  goods,  in  the  form  of \ntransparent market regulation, infrastructure, and enforcement of contracts. For these benefits to be \nwidely  shared  and  promote  social  inclusion,  policies  should  be  crafted  in  collaboration  and \nconsultation with civil society groups. \n \nSince 2010, Myanmar has been in the midst of a multifaceted transition, involving economic \nreforms, the resolution of multiple long-standing civil conflicts, and a nascent transition to democratic \nrule. These transitions are co-occurring with a resource-led economic boom, and all the blessings and \nchallenges such booms entail. These transformations are occurring in parallel, and outcomes of each \ntransition  are  dependent  on  the  outcomes  of  the  others.  These  transitions  provide  a  unique \nopportunity to engage in broad governance reform and develop the institutions necessary for a \ngrowing economy. \n \nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section II assesses the current status of \ngovernance institutions, as well as their performance, in comparison to the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and selected other countries. Section III discusses outstanding problem areas \nrelated to economic governance, particularly in the legal system, the business regulatory framework, \nand bureaucratic capacity, and provides specific policy recommendations for leveling the playing field \nbetween state economic enterprises (SEEs), military-affiliated enterprises, and the private sector. \nSection IV discusses opportunities to engage civil society in Myanmar\u2019s economic governance and the \npeace process. Section V addresses the potential use of external policy anchors, particularly in the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process, to strengthen Myanmar\u2019s ongoing reform \neffort, before Section VI concludes with a brief summary of key policy recommendations. \n \n   \n                                                 \n1   To be clear, the direct expropriation is prohibited by the constitution. However, investors can be indirectly expropriated by \nchanging rules and regulations after the investment has been undertaken. This consideration points to the need for a \nstrong court system to impartially adjudicate such disputes. ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nII.   CROSS-NATIONAL INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE \n \nIn  recent  years,  a  consensus  has  emerged  on  the  importance  of  institutions,  governance,  and \nspecifically transparency, to economic development. Challenges in assessing the quality of institutions \nor governance, or the degree of transparency or corruption are nontrivial, however. Cross-national \nsurveys have become an important means of benchmarking absolute performance, relative ranking, \nand direction trends across a variety of relevant metrics. While there may be a \u201cbeauty pageant\u201d aspect \nto this evidence, it likely contains some \u201ctrue\u201d information, and at an absolute minimum can be \ninterpreted as a valid indication of the perceptions of local and outside observers. \n \nOne of the immediate difficulties confronting both analysts and policymakers alike is the sheer \nnumber of such indicators and their reliance on sometimes overlapping sources of information. Even if \nthese challenges can be sorted out, one still faces the issue of prioritization across various agenda \nitems and devising actual policy responses. \n \nGivens (2013) carefully examines a huge number of these indicators to statistically separate \nout redundancy and derive the true new information contained in each measure, then determines the \ndimensions  of  governance  that  have  the  biggest  impact  on  growth  performance.  He  finds  that \nmeasures relating to \u201cmarket infrastructure,\u201d essentially rule of law and corruption and \u201ccivil liberties,\u201d \nessentially other dimensions of rule of law plus voice, have the biggest impact on growth, surpassing \nsuch influences on growth such as international trade and geography.      \n \nIn  this  section,  we  review  Myanmar\u2019s  performance  on  a  number  of  these  cross-national \nsurveys of governance, focusing on rule of law and the extent of corruption. We then link back to these \nthemes in the concluding section on how international initiatives can be used to anchor Myanmar\u2019s \nown efforts to improve performance in these areas. In almost all cases, we benchmark Myanmar\u2019s \nperformance against local comparators Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet Nam (together, the CMLV countries). \n \nThe bottom line is that Myanmar\u2019s economic governance needs improvement on most of \nthese indicators. Evidence derived from Myanmar-based respondents in the World Economic Forum\u2019s \n(WEF) Global Competitiveness Report survey indicates that financing and governance issues are at the \ntop  of  the  list  of  obstacles  to  development  (World  Economic  Forum  2014).2  However,  some \nimprovement in recent years is evident in the data, reinforcing the notion that the country\u2019s recent \nreforms  are  being  recognized  around  the  world.  These  results  also  underscore  a  basic  lesson\u2014\nMyanmar has nowhere to go but up, and as its institutional practices converge on global norms, we can \nexpect to observe a concomitant reduction in the risk premium associated with doing business in \nMyanmar, increased foreign investment on better financial terms, and an overall acceleration in growth \nand improvement in outcomes. In the final section, we discuss some specifics of how external policy \nanchors can be leveraged to further this effort. \n \nWe start by examining how local market participants evaluate their own environment.

However the \ncountry  exhibited  a  noticeable  improvement  in  the  2013  TI  ranking,  surpassing  Cambodia.    In \npercentile terms, the country scores better on the WEF\u2019s favoritism in decisions of government \nofficials (11.8%), the World Bank\u2019s control of corruption indicator (11.4%), and the WEF\u2019s diversion of \nfunds indicator (15.3%).

ONGOING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE REFORMS \n \nIn 2011, President Thein Sein launched a wide-ranging and ongoing reform program, covering not only \nthe economy, but internal political issues and foreign relations as well. A human rights commission \n(HRC) was established (and reorganized in 2014). The HRC has launched a website, and state media \npublished  material  specifying  the  complaint  process  and  necessary  documentation.  The  right  to \npublicly demonstrate (subject to notification) was introduced, and draft legislation on the right of \nassociation is under debate.9 Application of the peaceful protest law by local authorities has remained \nsubject  to  controversy,  however,  and  in  June  2014,  amendments  were  enacted  to  improve \nimplementation. Labor legislation (the Trade Union Law, 2011), liberal by regional standards, has been \nenacted allowing unions, and protecting the employment of workers joining a union or participating in \na strike, though activists complain of problems in implementation. As of October 2013, more than 500 \nbasic labor organizations (unions) had been certified and wildcat labor unrest is being transformed into \nlegal strikes.    \n \nCensorship  has  been  greatly  diminished  with  the  abolition  of  the  Press  Scrutiny  and \nRegistration  Division,  private  publications  have  commenced  political  reporting,  and  independent \nnewspapers began publication in April 2013 (Steinberg 2013a, Clapp and DiMaggio 2013).  As we will \nargue below, the development of civil society and a free press are key aspects of making transparency \ninitiatives like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) work. \n \nWith respect to more technocratic concerns, a nongovernmental (though state authorized) \nthink tank, the Myanmar Development Resource Institute (MDRI) was established as a reform brain \ntrust.  It has a three part program encompassing economics, law, and security and political affairs.  The \nSocial and Economic Advisory Council was subsequently started to advise ministries on the enactment \nof reforms and implementation. \n \nIn a further effort to improve the functioning of government, President Thein Sein has also \nestablished the Public Services Performance Appraisal Task Force to review the operations of all \ngovernment ministries dealing with the public, cut red tape, streamline decision making, restructure \norganization where necessary, and change organizational culture to improve the delivery of public \nservices\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 4). In related moves, he also \n \ni.   established an anticorruption committee and signed the Anti-Corruption Law (2013); \nii.   initiated the process of joining EITI, with the Centre for Economic and Social Development, \nthe economic wing of MDRI, tasked with serving as the secretariat for the application process; \nMDRI will need enhanced budgetary support to expand its capacity to address its myriad new \nroles;  \niii.  declared the country\u2019s intention to join the Open Government Partnership, a multilateral \ninitiative  aimed  at  securing  \u201cconcrete  commitments  from  governments  to  promote \ntransparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen \ngovernance\u201d  (Open  Government  Partnership    http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about \naccessed 27 September 2013); and  \n                                                 \n9    Reforms aimed at opening space for civil society are discussed further in Section IV. \n ", "10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \niv.   has constituted a working group in the president\u2019s office \u201cto make necessary preparations to \nmeet these standards for transparency, accountability, citizen participation, and technology \nand innovation\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 4).10  \n \nMyanmar\u2019s fiscal processes, which had been among the most opaque in the world, have \nopened up (International Budget Partnership 2013). In 2012, the state budget was publicly debated in \nparliament and published in private newspapers for the first time, and the auditor general \u201chas been \ngiven a measure of independence\u201d (McKinsey Global Institute 2013, p. 14). As a result of this greater \nopenness, the state budget is beginning to change in ways reflecting greater accountability to the \npublic. Expenditures on health and education have risen by 78% and 50%, respectively (IMF 2013).   \n \nTax reform has been undertaken and the country has established a long-term vision, which \nincludes  reform  of  tax  administration,  movement  to  value-added  tax,  and,  in  conjunction  with \nmultilateral partners such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), strengthened fiscal management (IMF 2013). Historically, tax measures \nwere subject to somewhat arbitrary implementation, and the government has accepted that going \nforward, \u201call taxation-related orders and instructions be enshrined in legislation\u201d (Vriens and Partners \n2013b,  p.  6).  In  2014,  legislation  was  enacted  with  the  aim  of  streamlining  administration  and \nbroadening the tax base, though the IMF expressed concerns that numerous exemptions reduced the \nsystem\u2019s revenue generation potential (IMF 2014a). Public records indicate that Myanmar\u2019s largest \nfirms have stepped up tax payments (Vriens and Partners 2014). \n \nA.  Property Rights and Factor Markets \n \nMyanmar is sometimes described as a \u201ctransitional economy\u201d and lumped together with neighbors \nsuch as Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The reality is more complex, however. Private property \nrights are delineated and nationalization prohibited under the constitution. And unlike its neighbors, \nnominally private businesses, not state-owned enterprises, are already at the center of the economy. \nBut these entities may reflect deep state connections, either as former SEEs with implicit expectations \nof bailouts if they run into difficulties, or are simply controlled by politically connected cronies. State \ninfluence is more profound than notional figures on private sector activity would suggest.  \n \n1.  The Land Market \n \nThe land market remains problematic. Constitutionally, all land is  residually owned by the state \n(Steinberg 2013b). Historically, the state or politically connected entities have exercised eminent \ndomain in what some have described as arbitrary \u201cland-grabbing.\u201d Land ownership registries are \ninadequate, and as McKinsey has observed, \u201cif disputes arise over land, Myanmar currently has no \nmeaningful  recourse  and  no  national  legal-aid  program  to  ease  access  to  the  justice  system\u201d \n(McKinsey Global Institute 2013, p. 77). Pre-socialist era cadaster maps\u2014surveys of land ownership  \n   \n                                                 \n10   President Thein Sein signed the Anti-Corruption Law with reservations over concerns that its terms did not comply with \nthe United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which Myanmar signed in December 2012. In February \n2014, a 15-member Anti-Corruption Commission was formed, but as of November 2014, the composition and functioning \nof this body remain under discussion. ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   11 \nand tenure\u2014have been lauded for comprehensiveness (Binns and Dale 1995) but are likely to be of \nlimited use in establishing current property rights and appropriate valuation.11 \n \nThe land dispute issue is particularly sensitive insofar as the military\u2019s prominence in alleged \nland-grabbing. A parliamentary commission calculated that since 1988, the military has seized nearly \n100,000 hectares. In June 2013, the press reported that the Minister of Defense, Brigadier General Wai \nLwin, promised to return confiscated land that was not being used, or about 8% of the disputed property. \nThere are now disputes over the definition of \u201cuse\u201d and claims that the military rushed to construct \nimprovements to demonstrate the land was under use (Vriens and Partners 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). \nBeyond the obvious commercial stakes, this particular aspect of the land issue is likely to take a long time \nto sort out, insofar as it turns on the image of the military and its relationship to the broader society, as \nwell as military practices such as requiring soldiers to grow their own food. The government has formed a \nCentral Land Management Committee and set a 1-year deadline for resolving 745 targeted disputes. \n \nThe Farmland Law (2012), while representing progress, is inadequate. The law allows farmers use \nrights (though not for the extraction of subsoil minerals).  The bill strengthens protection of farmers from \n\u201cland grabbing\u201d by private entities, while maintaining the government\u2019s right to exercise the principle of \neminent domain in exchange for \u201csuitable compensation\u201d (Nehru 2013, p. 11).  In other low-income \ncountries where farmers have been given the right to \u201cpermanently transfer\u201d their user rights or the right to \nsell land, \u201cland ownership concentration has increased dramatically, creating large numbers of landless and \nexacerbating poverty\u201d (Nehru 2013, p. 11). It is claimed that, \u201cDespite the passage of a new land law by the \nparliament, people in Myanmar are still being unfairly displaced by large businesses and agricultural projects \nwithout adequate compensation or means of providing a livelihood. This is largely a legal matter, in which \nthe law itself still allows sizeable tracts of land to be seized\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 11). Ultimately, \nthe solution is not simply more efficient legal systems, but more systematic programs to ensure that large-\nscale development projects are adequately inclusive and address the legitimate interests and needs of local \nresidents, and that those residents are afforded stable land rights that are not subject to abrogation by \npolitically connected interests. A new draft Land Use Law was unveiled in October 2014. \n \nThe use (and misuse) of forest land is also an issue.  According to Woods (2013), Myanmar\u2019s \ntimber land can be categorized in five ways: \n \ni.  State-managed (Myanmar Timber Enterprise) forests; \nii.  Logging concessions in natural forest, most in ethnic minority populated areas;  \niii.  Land conversion in natural forests, also occurring in, though not limited to, areas of ethnic \nconflict; \niv.  A limited number of tree plantations; and  \nv.  Community forests where commercial logging is prohibited.  \n \nThe last category is the only one in which local communities have legal land or resource use \nrights, and not surprisingly, logging activities have been subject to considerable internal controversy.12  \n \n                                                 \n11   In October 2013, the Yangon Region Revenue Department began using fixed appraisal rates to collect taxes on local land \ntransactions. The policy was introduced in part to confront the phenomenon of grossly underreporting sales prices in \norder to avoid property taxes, which are linked to the buyer\u2019s ability to document his or her income source.  Buyers who \nobtained their income through illicit activities would report transaction prices that could be justified on the basis of licit \nearnings alone (Vriens and Partners 2013c). \n12   The exportation of timber is also subject to controversy, as taken up below. \n ", "12   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nIn this context, the controversy over the Letpadaung copper mine could provide a salutary \nlearning moment. The March 2013 parliamentary commission report which attempted to address \nvarious stakeholder interests could form a model for other such disputes, calling for \u201cadequate social \nand environmental safeguards from companies, transparency in the conduct of the project, proper \ncompensation  for  local  people  who  have  been  displaced,  adequate  provisions  for  their  future \nlivelihoods, preservation of local cultural and religious sites where appropriate, and training for local \npopulations to provide the skills needed to work on the project\u201d (Clapp and DiMaggio 2013, p. 12). \n \nLikewise, there are issues with respect to urban or industrial use land.  The government has \nestablished  18  industrial  parks  in  nine  states  and  regions  under  the  auspices  of  the  Industrial \nDevelopment Committee chaired by the Minister of Industry No. 2 (Min and Kudo 2012, McKinsey \nGlobal Institute 2013). Investors have complained of bottlenecks, however, with regard to lack of \navailable land for industrial development, and the high price of unimproved land in these estates (Pun \n2012, Min and Kudo 2012). It has been estimated that only 20% of the land in the existing zones is \ncurrently used for industrial production; the other 80% is used for activities, such as warehousing, or is \nunused altogether.  \n \nIt would appear that to spur industrial development, the state should lease land at competitive \nrates to anyone who will build a factory and provide employment; the land could revert to the state if \nthe factory closed. Concurrent with these new leases, the Ministry of Finance and Revenue should \nconduct a comprehensive land survey\u2014security conditions permitting\u2014in order to establish a current \ncadaster map of the country\u2019s territory and promote transparency in land use and tenure. \n \n2.  The Labor Market \n \nThe state has enacted or is considering a number of major pieces of labor reform legislation. One of \nthese is the Settlement of Labor Dispute Law (2012), which replaces the Trade Disputes Act (1929). It \nsafeguards workers\u2019 rights and establishes procedures, including conciliation and arbitration for the \norderly settlement of labor relations disputes.  \n \n3.  The Capital Market \n \nAlthough there are ongoing efforts to establish direct capital markets (and indeed a tiny stock market \nopened in October 2014), it is safe to assume that for the foreseeable future, enterprises in Myanmar \nwill continue to rely primarily on a bank-dominated system of indirect finance.  \n \nThe  banking  system  consists  of  four  state-owned  banks  which  have  their  origins  in  a \nmonobank system under the socialist regime, and 19 private banks established in the 1990s when the \nFinancial Institutions Law (1990) permitted the creation of private banks (Mieno 2013). There is \ncurrently  no  foreign  operational  banking  presence,  though  the  government  is  in  the  process  of \nfinalizing regulations that will permit entry via joint ventures with local banks, and some foreign banks \nhave begun establishing representative offices (IMF 2013).  \n \nMany of the private banks are subsidiaries of large conglomerates.  Such an arrangement, \nwhere industrial conglomerates own private banks, has proved to be problematic in other settings.   \n \nThe state-owned banks and private banks each account for roughly half of bank assets. Of the \nfour state banks, Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) is by far the largest, accounting for more than 40% ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   13 \nof the sector\u2019s assets. So in reality, the banking system could be described as a single bank dominant \nsystem with a fringe of much smaller competitors. \n \nBanking regulations have historically been restrictive, including a ban on private lending to \nfarmers, outmoded quantitative limits on deposit and loan rates implying negative interest rates, a ban \non the provision of uncollateralised credit, a ban on \u201cat call\u201d deposits, which are used for liquidity \nmanagement in most other banking systems, and a ban on deposit withdrawals from the Myanmar \nAgricultural Development Bank (MADB), which unsurprisingly discourages new deposits.  \n \nThe situation is changing, however. The IMF reports that the country\u2019s eligible collateral has \nbeen expanded to include agricultural exportables, deposit rates have been liberalized within a fixed \nband, and the MADB has increased credit limits to farmers.  The banks are opening more branches, \nand new technologies, such as credit cards and automatic teller machines, are being introduced.  \nTherefore, it would appear that access to banking, at least for the urban middle class, is improving.  \n \nApart  from  the  debilitating  affect  that  the  atrophied  state  of  the  banking  sector  has  on \ndevelopment, the lack of financial inclusion could contribute to undesirable long-term political economy \ndevelopments. Groups, either with access to capital outside the local banking sector, notably the ethnic \nChinese minority, or with privileged access to finance, such as the military, may come to dominate the \nprivate sector economy and the emergent middle class.  Such a development and its implied blunting of \nsocioeconomic mobility could become a source of tension (Steinberg 2013a, 2013b).  \n \nIn August 2014, nine foreign banks were issued licences to operate. The licences require $75 \nmillion investment and restrict the foreign banks to a single branch offering, only lending in foreign \ncurrencies to foreign companies and local banks. In the words of one commentator, \u201cthe restrictions \nare  aimed  both  to  protect  the  local  financial  services  sector  and  to  encourage  the  transfer  of \nknowledge and best practices by encouraging foreign-local cooperation\u201d (Gallucci 2014), and the on-\nlending to local banks may create a potential for local firms to access foreign banks through syndicated \nloans (Turnell 2014).     \n \nB.  Corporate Governance  \n \nGiven the state domination of the financial sector and the ubiquity of SEEs and politically connected \nenterprises in the economy, corporate governance in Myanmar has been historically problematic. The \nbasic issue is that the SEEs were not subjected to hard budget constraints, and benefitted from capital \nchannelling by the state-dominated banking sector, provisions of subsidies, and dispensation from \npaying taxes (Kubo 2012). However, recent reforms should mitigate, if not terminate, such practices.  \n \nExchange rate reforms have been important in this regard. With the introduction of a managed \nfloat  in  April  2012,  the  reference  rate  has  converged  on  the  previously  unofficial  market  rate, \neliminating the implicit subsidization of the SEEs that occurred via the old exchange rate mechanism \n(Kubo 2012, Mieno 2013). President Thein Sein has proposed that the SEEs stop receiving explicit \nsubsidies and begin paying taxes, as comparable private enterprises do (Min 2013). \n \nThe issue of soft budget constraints is a deeper problem, however. Kubo (2012) argues that the \nintegration of the SEEs into the state budget through the State Fund Account (SFA) actually worsened \nthe problem, and that resolving the issue requires the abolition of central planning of prices, production, \nand distribution of goods and services that the SEEs provide. \u201cThe necessary reforms include the \nseparation of the SEEs from the state budget as well as the abolition of price controls, and the implicit \n ", "14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \ncross-subsidies in the state sector.\u201d (Kubo 2013, p. 26).  From 2013\u20132014, profitable SEEs are expected \nto self-finance working capital, while the state will continue to finance 20% of the working capital of loss-\nmaking SEEs.  This represents a move toward greater financial autonomy for the SEEs insofar as the state \nfinanced 78% of the working capital of these enterprises previously (IMF 2013). \n \nHowever, in February 2011, just before the military junta left office, there was a massive \nprivatization of state assets, which some observers likened to a \u201cfire sale\u201d (e.g., Kubo 2012). As a \nconsequence, the soft budget constraint issue may now manifest in a different form, similar to that \nobserved with respect to the Government Supervised Agencies (GSAs) at the heart of the 2007\u2013\n2008 financial crisis in the United States (US). The problem is one of moral hazard, where ostensibly, \nprivate enterprises engage in risky behavior because they believe themselves to be indemnified against \nlosses due to their political connections. Specifically, the expectation is that, these now nominally \nprivate enterprises, in many cases controlled by former officials, could seek help from the government \nafter making bad investments, thus increasing the likelihood that bad investments would be made; or, \nsimilarly, banks may infer that the government is likely to bail out bad loans made to the former SEEs \nand thus not scrutinize borrowing carefully. The situation in Myanmar is made worse by the fact that \nthe banks themselves may be connected through ownership to the borrower.  \n \nMoreover, the simple privatization of such entities without any regulatory oversight may create \nthe conditions for implicit monopolies, oligopolies, and rampant rent-seeking. Such developments may \nbecome particularly pernicious in the nontraded sector, as the external opening of the economy and \nintegration into ASEAN bring greater competition to the relatively undeveloped traded-goods sector \nand indigenous, more politically connected entrepreneurs retreat to the comparative safety of the \nnontraded sector. \n \nC.  Bureaucratic Capacity  \n \nBoth survey-based indicators of government effectiveness and official government revenue statistics \nsuggest Myanmar\u2019s bureaucracy is in need of reform and significant capacity building. The World Bank \nGovernance Indicators place Myanmar in the 4th percentile in terms of government effectiveness, \nwhich captures \u201cperceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the \ndegree  of  its  independence  from  political  pressures,  the  quality  of  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies\u201d (Kaufman, \nKraay, and Mastruzzi 2010, p. 4). Revenue-generating capacity is another often-used measure of \nbureaucratic/administrative capacity, as revenue collection requires the development of significant \ninfrastructure and human capital for collecting and managing information. Total government revenues \nin 2011 were estimated at only 12% of GDP, compared to a mean of 20.4% for the ASEAN-5 countries \n(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and 28.1% for emerging market and \ndeveloping  economies  (IMF  2014b).  Since  then,  however,  revenue  collection  has  increased \ndramatically, nearly doubling to 22.3% in 2013, putting it at par with ASEAN-5 countries (IMF 2014b).  \n \nMyanmar is emerging from a 25-year period of military rule, during which the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council (SPDC), formerly the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), \nexercised control over all three branches of government. During this period, virtually all of the senior \npositions in line ministries were staffed by generals and retired military officers. Military penetration \ninto  the  bureaucracy  extended  into  lower  levels  of  the  bureaucracy  as  well,  after  many  civilian \nbureaucrats were sacked due to their participation in antigovernment protests in 1988. These positions \nwere often given to regional military commanders who were folded, in large numbers, into the central \nadministration.  ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   15 \n \nThe militarization of the bureaucracy had three pervasive effects. The first was to produce a \nhighly centralized and assertively top-down form of decision-making and policy implementation. \nWhile all bureaucracies are hierarchical in nature, military hierarchies are unique in the degree to which \nthe chain of command is observed. The salient features of the chain of command are vertical lines of \ncommunication and accountability (orders flow down, feedback flows up), strict observance of orders, \nand  non-interference  in  other  units.  Each  has  practical  implications  for  the  functioning  of  line \nministries. Chains of command do not reward initiative by lower-level functionaries, who instead rely \non top-down direction. Diversity of opinion is considered divisive, rather than potentially innovative. \nBecause information must flow back up through several links in the chain, it can be both distorted \n(either intentionally or unintentionally) or quashed in order to avoid the appearance of unsatisfactory \nperformance.  \n \nThe principal of non-interference in other units hampered inter-ministerial cooperation, as \nlines of delegated authority were blurred and there was no clear mechanism for producing or carrying \nout joint policy initiatives. While some ministries appear to collaborate effectively\u2014the Ministry of \nNational Planning and Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance jointly harmonize capital \nand current budgeting\u2014other areas do not benefit from such collaboration. The Ministries of Energy \nand Electrical Power are currently developing separate master planning documents without inter-\nministerial coordination. Education policy currently falls under the purview of at least a dozen different \nministries. While the Ministry of National Planning would be a potential agent for policy harmonization \nacross ministries, it has neither budgetary power nor a mandate to do so. \n \nThe second result of the militarization of the bureaucracy was the proliferation of ministerial \nappointments, though this was also  due in part  to the pursuit of a centrally planned economy. \nMyanmar\u2019s cabinet is comparatively large, consisting of 30 line ministries. The median for ASEAN \ncountries is 19.5.13 There is a general negative relationship between cabinet size and government \neffectiveness, with a significant deterioration of government effectiveness once the threshold of 20 \nline ministers is passed (Klimek, Hanel, and Thurner 2009; see Figure 5). As ministries proliferate, it \nbecomes more difficult both to achieve collective decisions and to coordinate policy implementation \nacross ministries. Whether this is due to declining efficiency in collective decision-making, increasing \ntransaction costs of coordinating policy at the implementation stage, or both, has not been tested, but \nit is likely that both play a role. Also, more government ministries provide more government jobs, and \nthus more opportunities for staffing ministries as a form of political patronage. \n \n   \n                                                 \n13   As of 23 November 2014, per CIA (2014). \n ", "16   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nFigure 5: Larger Cabinets, Weaker Bureaucratic Effectiveness \n \n100\n3\n01 Singapore\n2 90\ns, \ns\nne 80 Malaysia\ne Brunei Darussalam\nv\necti 70\nEff Thailand\nnt  60 Philippines\ne\nm\nn 50\nver Viet Nam Indonesia\nGo 40 y = \u20132.9781x + 115.13\nGI  R2 = 0.3122\nB 30\nW\nLao PDR\nntile,  20 Cambodia\ne\nc 10\ner\nP Myanmar\n0\n10 15 20 25 30 35\nNumber of line ministries, 2014\n \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, WBGI = World Bank Governance Indicator. \nSources: World Bank 2014b, CIA 2014. \n \nThe third result was to homogenize the educational backgrounds and worldviews of mid- and \ntop-level bureaucrats. Of the 38 current14 line ministers and cabinet-level appointments, 23 are former \nmilitary officers. Many, if not all, were trained at the Defense Services Academy (DSA), which trains \nfuture military officers for all three branches of the Tatmadaw. While this service academy is widely \nviewed as one, if not the, preeminent institution of higher learning in Myanmar, the prevalence of its \ngraduates in ministerial positions implies that most ministers share a common formal training in the \nnatural and social sciences. Whatever its merits, relying so heavily on a single educational institution to \nstaff the bureaucracy risks the stifling of initiative and diversity of opinion. The success of DSA \ngraduates in climbing the ranks of both the military and the bureaucracy contributes to the perceptions \nthat the military is still the most reliable vehicle for advancement in the public sector. \n \nAt the sub-ministerial level, resource and staffing constraints are significant. Multiple ministries \nhave had their mandates grow much faster than their budgets. Bureaucratic pay remains low, despite \nsalaries having been increased by 20% in each of the last 2 years. Low public sector salaries hamper \nattempts to recruit \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and can exacerbate problems with corruption (Van \nRijckeghem  and  Weder  2001).  Even  though  the  2013\u20132014  budget  includes  an  additional  23% \nincrease in public sector wages, this problem is likely to become more significant with the emergence \nof the private sector and increasing foreign investment (OECD 2013). In 2012, business interests \nforecast an increase in wages for skilled workers of 20% to 50% for the next year, with wages for those \nworking for foreign firms potentially even higher.15 Nongovernment jobs have become relatively more \nattractive, making it more difficult for the government to recruit and retain productive workers. This is \n                                                 \n14   As of 23 November 2014. \n15   Eleven. 2012. Salaries of skilled workers in Myanmar to rise up to 50%. 22 October. http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/ \nindex.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1038:salaries-of-skilled-workers-in-myanmar-to-rise-up-to-50&catid \n=33&Itemid=356 ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   17 \nespecially in those ministries that rely on highly sought-after technical skills, such as the Ministry of \nFinance and Revenue, which operates the Central Bank. \n \nOne obvious option is to continue raising wages in the public sector, a strategy successfully \nimplemented by Singapore (Rahman 1986). However, wage increases may not by themselves be \nsufficient, for several reasons. First, wage increases that would be necessary to stamp out corruption \nand retain the most effective bureaucrats might be so large as to be impractical\u2014on the order of two \nto eight times wages in the manufacturing sector (Besley and McLaren 1993, Van Rijckeghem and \nWeder 2001). Second, the long-term retention effects of wage increases are likely to be eroded by \ncontinued growth in the private sector. Third, given the size of the public sector, across-the-board \nwage increases could have undesirable inflationary effects. Moreover, general wage increases benefit \nboth highly productive and shirking employees alike, and may actually lower morale among the most \ntalented. \n \nDeveloping country governments have tried a variety of alternatives to build longer-term \nallegiance to bureaucratic careers among desirable workers. One possibility would be to train and \nconstruct a career ladder for a cadre of elite civil servants. Career-based elite civil services, such as \nthose in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, are staffed via entry-level recruitment according to \nperformance on an elite exam, with small proportions being nominated to serve from within the \nexisting civil service (World Bank 2012b). If successfully implemented, this would endow the Myanmar \ngovernment with a young, cohesive cohort of civil servants that could be induced to stay long-term by \ninformal social bonds. While this would be attractive, the present staffing needs of the Myanmar \ngovernment are such that it would likely need to be supplemented at the outset with recruitment from \nthe broader civil service, based on performance reports. These elite services act as teams within the \nbroader bureaucracy and can be significant agents of change.  \n \nA  complementary  measure  would  be  to  place  greater  emphasis  on  delayed  rewards, \nestablishing attractive pensions and retirement benefits, such as subsidized insurance. This strategy \nmay be advisable for two reasons. First, the deferment of benefits to late life means that the effect on \ncurrent expenditures need not be as large as with wage increases (Becker and Stigler 1974). Second, \nthese  types  of  benefits  would  have  minimal  impact  on  inflation,  as  they  would  not  entail  large \ninjections of cash into the local economy. Another option would be to reform the system to place \ngreater emphasis on rewarding performance. Implementing a two-tier salary structure, consisting of a \nbase wage and a variable wage that would be based on performance, would be one way of addressing \nthis issue. Finally, another option would be to enhance recruitment efforts aimed at those individuals \nwho are discriminated against in the private labor market for reasons of disability, gender or religion. \nThese individuals can be recruited and retained at lower costs. This suggestion should not be taken as \nencouraging discrimination, but rather recognizing that it exists and can be exploited by the public \nsector. Moreover, a diversification of the civil service could enhance central government credibility \namong peripheral minority groups. \n \nPresident Thein Sein designated 2013 as the year for public sector reform, with the goal of \nstreamlining the policymaking process, with the Ministries of National Planning and Finance intended \nto emerge as policy coordinators. This process resulted in the creation of inter-ministerial committees, \nincluding  the  National  Energy  Management  Committee  (NEMC)  and  the  Energy  Management \nCommittee  (EMC),  composed  of  representatives  of  the  Ministries  of  Energy,  Electric  Power, \nAgriculture and Irrigation, Environmental Conservation and Forestry, Industry, Mines, and Science and \nTechnology. While these bodies have a specific mandate to break down stovepipes in policy formation, \nthey lack independent secretariats. Whatever issues or policy initiatives emerge out of the committee \n ", "18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nmeetings  are  then  reassigned  to  the  independent  ministries  later.  Providing  these  units  with \nindependent secretariats would be a useful step in enhancing policy coordination. ADB is providing \nsome support for the development of a 20-year, integrated energy master plan, but similar infusions of \nresources \u2013 and help with cross-ministry planning and coordination \u2013 would be welcome (ADB 2013). \nAt the national level, the Ministry of National Planning should be tasked with coordinating policy. \nPolicy coordination among a coordinating ministry and a line ministry is difficult enough; divvying up \nthe coordinating responsibilities between two ministries amplifies the associated problems. If planning \nand finance are so intimately linked that assigning the master planning role to one ministry would be \nunworkable, another model would be to merge the Ministries of National Planning and Finance. The \nRepublic of Korea did just this in 2008, with the state rationale being \u201cto put under one roof fiscal \npolicy functions and inter-ministerial policy coordination\u201d (Ministry of Strategy and Finance 2010, IMF \n2010). \n \nPolicy coordination between the central government, and state and regional governments will \nbe  an  increasingly  important  issue.  The  2008  constitution  established  state  and  regional \ngovernments,16 each with the constitutional power to levy excise, land, and water taxes as well as toll \nfees and royalties on marine fisheries. Moreover, state and regional governments will be responsible for \nimplementing  central  government  directives  alongside  central  government  ministries.  Additional \nstaffing demands will be significant. The state and regional governments will form their own cabinets, \nwith ministers drawn from the elected state and regional Hluttaws, and subject to final approval by the \npresident. As at the national level, the Minister for Border and Security Affairs will be appointed by the \nCommander-in-Chief of the Defense Services. However, these ministries will not have direct power \nover hiring and promotion in these bureaucracies, which will be conducted by the national line \nministries.  This  blurs  the  lines  of  delegation,  with  bureaucrats  potentially  receiving  conflicting \ndirectives and assignments from national, and state- and regional-level ministers. Moreover, regional \nministers will be fewer in number than line ministries, meaning that individual regional and state \nministers will have to shoulder multiple portfolios with a single ministry\u2019s staff and resources (Nixon et \nal.  2013).  These  circumstances  are  ripe  for  an  increase  in  corrupt  practices,  as  blurred  lines  of \ndelegation complicate oversight.  \n \n \nIV.   ENGAGING CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE PEACE PROCESS \n \nA.  Civil Society \n   \nSince  2011,  the  Myanmar  government  has  enacted  wide-ranging  reforms  that  should  support \ndevelopment of a more robust civil society, even if they fall short of guaranteeing true freedom of press \nand assembly. Press censorship has been eased by the abolition of the Press Scrutiny and Registration \nDivision. Prior to its abolition in 2012, all newspaper articles were subject to its purview. The state\u2019s \nmonopoly on daily print media has ended as well. As of 1 April, 2013, four privately owned daily \nnewspapers  went  into  circulation,  though  private  newspapers  still  require  government-issued \npermits.17 These reforms have been noticed\u2014in just 2 years (2012\u20132014), Myanmar moved from \n                                                 \n16   States  and  regions  are  equivalent.  The  term  state  applies to  those  administrative  units  encompassing  regionally \nconcentrated ethnic minorities (Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan), while the regions are composed of \nmajority  Burman  areas  (Ayeyarwady,  Bago,  Magway,  Mandalay,  Sagaing,  Taninthyari,  and  Yangon).  The  capital, \nNaypyidaw, is administered as a union territory.  \n17   Sixteen separate newspapers were granted licenses by the Myanmar government. See Tun 2013.  ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   19 \n169th to 145th on Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index, putting it ahead of regional \ncomparators Malaysia and Viet Nam (Reporters Without Borders 2014). \n \nThe Law on Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession, enacted 5 July 2012, allows the right \nto hold peaceful demonstrations and marches, though organizers must obtain permission 5 days in \nadvance from the commander of the relevant Township Police Force. Applications are not to be \ndenied unless they pose a threat to state security, the rule of law, or \u201cpublic tranquility,\u201d though these \nterms are left without precise definition, and thus regional police commanders have wide latitude in \ndetermining what constitutes a threat (Ministry of Home Affairs 2012). \n \nThe Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was empaneled in 2011. It has \nissued repeated calls for the President to grant amnesty to political prisoners and exiles. Over 6,000 \nsuch prisoners were released on 11 October 2011 (NHRC 2011), and hundreds of political dissidents \nhave returned from abroad after the government removed over 2,000 individuals from a \u201cblacklist\u201d \nthat prohibited entry into the country. Nevertheless, the NHRC has thus far not investigated claims of \nhuman rights abuses in conflict zones, where conditions are likely much worse. \n \nA welcome sign has been an enhanced role for civil society in the policy formation and advising \nprocess.  As  discussed  above,  an  independent  think  tank,  the  Myanmar  Development  Resource \nInstitute was formed. It consists of three components: economics, law, and security and political \naffairs. This group has been tasked with acting as the secretariat in Myanmar\u2019s Extractive Industries \nTransparency Initiative application (see the following section).  \n \nAs Myanmar\u2019s private sector develops, opportunities to leverage private expertise through \npublic-private partnerships (PPPs) should be expanded as well (ADB 2008). PPPs have been a widely \nused mechanism for developing infrastructure, particularly in the areas of telecommunications, power \ngeneration, water and sanitation, and transportation. Given Myanmar\u2019s needs in all these areas, this \nmay be a mechanism for channelling private investment into the provision of public services. \n \n  Improvements in communications infrastructure will help spur both economic growth and civil \nsociety. As of 2012, only one out of 100 Myanmar people had internet access, and telephone lines \nwere similarly scarce. Cellular subscriptions, however, are up over 800% since 2010, with more than 5 \nmillion cellular subscribers nationwide (World Bank 2013). As has been the experience in other \ncountries, the expansion of communication is expected to have both economic and sociopolitical \neffects by facilitating communication among private citizens. \n \nWhile the long-term effects of a burgeoning civil society will likely be very positive, the opening \nof political space for private, non-state actors is not always an unalloyed blessing. Independent civil \nsocieties can and will mobilize to protest reforms, particularly those that entail the withdrawal of \nperceived benefits. Moreover, not all civil society actors are necessarily benevolent, which implies that \nthe government must play a larger role in punishing and deterring such violent actions, especially as \nthey may have the potential to escalate. \n \nB.  Peace Process \n \nMyanmar\u2019s past history of unrest has been a significant brake on economic development. While \ncountry-specific estimates are not feasible, Cerra and Saxena (2008) estimate the output loss from a \ncivil  war  in  low-income  countries  to  be  significant  (on  average,  6%),  and  higher  for  those  with \ncomparatively weak checks on executive power. Conflict in Myanmar has complicated efforts to \n ", "20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \ncombat narcotics production, illegal mining and logging, the latter of which constitutes a significant \nloss of both export and government revenue. More generally, concerns about political instability drive \ndown foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in nonresource sectors like light manufacturing.  \n \nOn September 10, 2013, Minister of the President\u2019s Office Aung Min met with members of the \nFederal Council to discuss plans for a national cease-fire agreement. If successful, it could pave the \nway to a more comprehensive peace agreement. However, just 10 days later, the UNFC announced \nthat it would not accept the government\u2019s offer, in part due to continued fighting in Kachin and Shan \nstates. Tensions rose further in November 2014 following the shelling of a Kachin training facility, \nwhich resulted in the deaths of 23 Kachin Independence Army (KIA, the militant wing of the Kachin \nIndependence Organization); the action was condemned by the United Nationalities Federal Council. \nDespite day-to-day uncertainty, these most recent cease fires differ significantly from those of the \npast. The most recent cease-fires have been a) written, rather than verbal; b) openly reported by \nmedia outlets, meaning that public awareness of the cease-fires has been significantly enhanced; c) \ninvolve  not  just  field  military  commanders,  but  delegates  of  the  highest  levels  of  the  civilian \ngovernment;  and  d)  explicitly  tackle  the  issue  of  armed-group  involvement  in  illicit  activities \n(Yawnghwe and Maung Than 2011).  \n \nWhile these are positive developments, a cease-fire should not be viewed as marking the \ncessation of hostilities. Conflict could resume if the underlying issues that generated the conflicts are \nnot addressed. The 2010 constitution began the process of transitioning more governance roles to \nregional  governments,  thereby  granting  minority  groups  greater  policy  autonomy.  However,  the \nstability of these ethno-federal and/or power-sharing arrangements is not guaranteed. Lijphart (1977), \nStepan (1999), Gurr (2000) all argue the merits of decentralization, either via federalism or some \npower-sharing  arrangement,  as  a  solution  to  rule  in  ethnically  divided  societies.  Power-sharing \narrangements are those that build in representation for various identity groups in order to insure that \ntheir interests are represented in postconflict governance institutions. Hartzell and Hoddie (2003) \nfind that power-sharing institutions across a wide range of areas\u2014economic, military, political, and \nterritorial autonomy\u2014are associated with a decreased likelihood of return to conflict, though their \nfindings are based on small samples. \n \nThere are dissenting views as well. Brancati (2006) finds that ethno-federalism reinforces \nethnic and regional identities and party cleavages, producing legislation that favors certain groups over \nothers, and mobilizing groups to engage in ethnic conflict and secessionism. Christin and Hug (2012) \nnote that this tendency is strongest when ethnic groups are highly geographically concentrated \u2013 a \ncondition that definitely obtains in Myanmar. Alternately, Bakke and Wibbels (2006) note that the \nstability of ethno-federal arrangements is conditional on a society\u2019s level of economic development \nand ethnic composition. Alternately, Roeder and Rothschild argue in favor of power dividing, rather \nthan power-sharing arrangements (Roeder and Rothschild 2005). Power-dividing institutions stress \nthe importance of multiple, overlapping majorities and checks and balances as well as universal \nprotection of civil liberties, and ethnic and religious identities. Roeder and Rothschild find that power- \ndividing, rather than power-sharing, institutions are associated with more robust peace following civil \nwars. \n \nWhatever the resolution of existing conflicts, further institutional reforms are likely necessary \nto encourage the development of broad-based political parties that have support across ethnic and \nregional lines. The current electoral system, in which legislative candidates compete for a single seat \n(single member district plurality, or SMDP) within relatively ethnically and religiously homogeneous \ndistricts, does not encourage politicians to seek support outside of their own group. These systems ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   21 \ntend to disproportionately reward large national parties and smaller parties with highly geographically \nconcentrated bases of support, such as the various regional parties, while underrepresenting smaller, \nless geographically concentrated parties. \n \nElectoral systems research comes up with three classes of solutions: closed-list proportional \nrepresentation (PR); rules that require parties to run candidates across the country, rather than just in \nethnic homelands, as in Indonesia (Selway 2013); and preferential voting systems. In preference voting \nsystems, voters rank their preferences over candidates within their district (Reilly 2002). The idea is to \nencourage parties not just to campaign for first-place votes, but to court second-place votes as well, \npooling votes across ethnic lines and thus decreasing ethnic identity as a salient driver of political \naffiliations. Alternative vote is a single member district system that requires an absolute majority, \nrather than plurality; if an absolute majority is not gained in the first round, the candidate with the \nlowest number of first-place votes is eliminated, and their votes are distributed to the remaining \ncandidates. Single transferable vote is a proportion system with multimember districts, with a \u201cquota\u201d \nof votes required to elect a single candidate, and a subsequently similar redistribution of remaining \nfirst-place votes. Either of these reforms would help to reduce the salience of ethnic identity in \npartisan politics. \n \n \nV.   EXTERNAL POLICY ANCHORS AND THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES \nTRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE \n \nMyanmar is reforming its policies and practices on governance. External anchors can be used to \npromote internal reforms, reinforce credibility, and lock in commitments. In particular, Myanmar\u2019s \ntransformation is occurring in the context of a massive resource boom. The Extractive Industries \nTransparency Initiative (EITI) and other international anticorruption efforts can be used to deepen \nand strengthen Myanmar\u2019s ongoing efforts in this area. \n \nA.  Resource Development Context \n \nMyanmar has incredibly rich and diverse mineral resources, ranging from precious stones to oil and \nnatural gas. The country has an estimated 283 to 334 billion cubic meters of natural gas, with much \nhigher reserve potential, along with 50 million barrels of crude oil reserves (US EIA 2013, BP 2013). \nThe country has 90% of the world\u2019s jade reserves.  A strengthened legal framework, streamlined \napprovals process, and a removal of export bans on certain minerals could induce billions of dollars of \nFDI inflows and transform the sector. \n \nIn addition to minerals, Myanmar exports considerable timber (perhaps more than 2.5 million \nm3), though assessing the true volume of timber exports, as in the case of semi-precious stones, is \nimpeded by the problem of illegal exports (Woods 2013).   \n \nEnergy and minerals account for perhaps half of exports, and FDI has been overwhelmingly \ntargeted at the mineral and natural gas sectors. Sixty-one companies, including Total, Eni, and other \nlarge multinationals that are EITI stakeholders, have registered to bid on both onshore and 30 offshore \nblocks in 2013; 20 more offshore oil and gas blocks were auctioned to companies including Royal \nDutch Shell, Total and Statoil, with a further nine blocks to be auctioned in 2015. Pipelines to carry the \noil and gas  to end users have been built traversing the country, including through  areas largely \ninhabited by ethnic minorities, and protests have at times disrupted the operation of oil and gas \npipelines. \n ", "22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \n \nAn open issue is whether economic and political institutions are capable of successfully \nmanaging the sudden influx of wealth this mineral boom will generate, or whether the wealth will \ncomplicate  macroeconomic  management,  inhibiting  development  of  nonenergy  sectors  and \ncomplicating the country\u2019s political reforms.  \n \nCountries whose wealth is heavily derived from the exploitation of natural resources tend to be \npoorer and grow more slowly than those whose wealth is based on the accumulation of human and \nphysical capital. However, the empirical literature on the resource curse\u2014the tendency of resource-\ndependent economies to grow more slowly for purely economic reasons, such as resource pulls and \ncrowding out, Dutch disease, price volatility, etc.\u2014have reached consensus that these economic \nphenomena cause only slightly negative effects. The most potentially deleterious effects of natural \nresource wealth on economic development may rather operate indirectly, through institutions and \nconflict. \n \nDependence on high-value, mined commodities has negative effects for bureaucratic and \nstate capacity, and political violence\u2014all of which exert direct or indirect effects on economic growth. \nIt is perhaps no accident that the two countries with which Myanmar tied for last in the open budget \nindex  were  Qatar  and  Equatorial  Guinea,  two  oil  exporters.  However,  the  negative  effects  for \nbureaucratic capacity and political violence\u2014the factors with the clearest implications for economic \ngrowth\u2014are found to be largely contingent on the quality of preexisting institutions and, in the case of \nconflict, certain attributes of the resources themselves.  \n \nWhether natural resource wealth leads to violence is largely a function of both attributes of the \nresource itself and the technology of its extraction, and the preexisting political, economic, and social \nenvironment. Commodities with high value-to-weight ratios, such as gemstones, oil, cocaine, and \nopium are ideal contestable, or \u201clootable,\u201d goods, and indeed the gem trade has fueled some of \nMyanmar\u2019s peripheral insurgencies for decades. \n \nWith respect to hydrocarbons, location is key. The relevant distinction is onshore versus \noffshore production. Onshore oil production increases the probability of conflict onset by 50% relative \nto the baseline risk, in contrast to offshore production, which has no effect. The differential effects of \nonshore and offshore production are due to the differential opportunities onshore versus offshore \nproduction created for rent-seeking by violent actors. Transporting onshore hydrocarbons to terminals \nfor export generally requires large, aboveground networks of pipelines. This onshore infrastructure \ncreates a network of targets\u2014including pipelines and the workers that service them\u2014only a few of \nwhich can truly be hardened against attack. Deep-pocketed energy companies make attractive targets \nfor insurgents, who may have limited capacity to hold and defend such installations, but significant \ncapacity to extort. Myanmar\u2019s own experience with its pipeline through Shan state\u2014which has been \nsabotaged  by  insurgents  in  the  past\u2014shows  this  in  action.  In  contrast,  offshore  platforms  are \ncomparatively easy to defend, since most insurgent groups do not have naval capacity, and have \nlimited capacity to extract rents from offshore production. As Myanmar\u2019s production transitions to \nmore offshore gas fields, its gas infrastructure will be less prone to sabotage. \n \nMany seemingly resource-related conflicts have occurred in societies that would be among the \nmost likely candidates for conflict outbreak, even absent the role of contestable resources\u2014countries \nlike Colombia, Indonesia, and Myanmar are at elevated risk of experiencing conflict because of past \nhistories of violence, comparatively low levels of economic development, and horizontal inequalities. ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   23 \nFor this reason, political reforms aimed at redressing horizontal inequalities\u2014such as those between \nthe ethnic majority and minorities\u2014are vital. \n \nB.  The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \n \nPolicy concerns regarding the potentially negative institutional aspects of the resource curse fall into \ntwo basic categories. The first revolve around fiscal issues. Proposed solutions typically involve the \nadoption of fiscal policy rules (including the possibility of dedicating or earmarking expenditures for \nparticular programs with the expectation that this will generate a broad political constituency for \ntransparency and accountability), the creation of natural resource fund (NRF) or sovereign wealth \nfunds (SWFs), and/or direct distribution of resource rents via cash transfers/dividends to the public, or \nwhat has been called \u201coil-to-cash.\u201d Each of these proposals has merits and drawbacks, and some \njudicious  mixture  of  all  three  (an  NRF  or  SWF,  earmarks  for  particular  programs,  and  dividend \npayments) may be ideal. However, what we focus on in this context, are institutional concerns, which \nare much more foundational to economic development than any specific policy intervention. \n \nOver the past decade, a number of international good governance initiatives including the \nKimberley Process Certification System (KPCS) and associated Diamond Development Initiative, the \nEITI, and the Conflict Minerals Trade initiative, have emerged to address the resource management \nchallenges described in the previous section.18 In July 2014, Myanmar was accepted as a candidate \ncountry to the EITI.19 It is also pursuing a pilot project to push down EITI to the state level.  \n \nEITI works off of two components: disclosure, which is supposed to generate the information \nneeded to reduce corruption, and the establishment of country-level multi-stakeholder bodies, which \nin principle absorb and propagate this information with the aim of enforcing accountability.  \n \nThe aim of the first component is to build double-entry accounts that can be checked for \nconsistency. Governments must require extractive firms operating within their territory to disclose \npayments to governments to explore or extract energy or minerals, and governments must record \nrevenues that they receive from extraction. A third-party independent administrator reconciles these \nfigures. A current source of contention is whether these payments are aggregated or reported on a \ncompany-by-company basis, as is now required by laws in the US and the European Union (EU). \nRoughly half of EITI member countries publish only aggregate amounts; the other half, publish their \nresults by company (Moran 2013).20 Myanmar can choose to make such reporting mandatory. \n \nThe  second  component  is  the  establishment  of  a  formal  multi-stakeholder  group  that \nevaluates the information provided by the firms, the government, and the third-party administrator. \nFinally, an outside body validates the reports in conjunction with the stakeholder group.  This is \nsupposed to close a loop between the government and the governed.  \n \nThere are two tiers of countries in EITI: candidate countries that have signed up to implement \nthe EITI protocol, and compliant countries that have fully and successfully implemented EITI. As of \nNovember  2014,  there  are  31  compliant  countries,  17  candidate  countries,  8  stakeholder \n                                                 \n18   This section draws on Hendrix and Noland (2014).  In addition to the initiatives mentioned above, the EU, US, and \nAustralia all maintain their own regulations on the importation of timber from Myanmar, which have created a trade \nregime somewhat similar to the conflict minerals regulatory regime.  \n19   The US is also in the process of applying to EITI and has entered into a partnership with Myanmar to provide political and \ntechnical assistance to implement best practices in the oil, gas, and mining sectors. \n20   See Darby (2009) on the rationale for company-by-company disclosure. \n ", "24   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs),  more  than  80  supporting  companies,  more  than  80 \nsupporting institutional investors, and 21 stakeholder organizations, including ADB. Petrobras (Brazil) \nis an EITI supporter, but other large non-Western oil companies such as China National Petroleum \nCompany, Lukoil (Russian Federation), and Petronas (Malaysia) are not.21 \n \nWhile EITI was originally oriented toward the oil sector, several signatories produced other \nminerals and were not primarily oil producers. EITI is being expanded to include fisheries and forestry \nin some countries. There is no reason, for example, that Myanmar cannot also apply EITI to the \nproduction of timber, and not just oil, gas, and minerals.22  \n \nThe effectiveness of EITI is in significant part a function of the degree of buy-in by host \ngovernments. The pact is voluntary. A government committed to behaving corruptly may simply not \nparticipate. There is no mechanism for directly sanctioning noncompliance, though there may be \nreputational or signaling costs.23 EITI focuses on a single point in the production chain (the transfer of \nmoney  from  the  firm  to  the  government)  and  ignores  critical  upstream  stages  (contracting  and \nprocurement) and downstream activities (expenditure). \n \nThe stakeholder body is also potentially a point of weakness, depending on the preexisting \nstrength  of  civil  society  and  on  the  attitude  of  the  government.  EITI  creates  a  platform  for \ncommunication between the government, the companies, and civil society, and establishes a set of \ninternationally accepted norms and procedures. But in other countries, particularly those that have \nrecently transitioned from more autocratic forms of rule, the press and the NGO sectors remain weak, \nmaking effective civil society participation difficult. And in some countries, the government literally \nappoints the stakeholder representatives, allowing it to pack the body with cronies who may have little \ninterest in rocking the boat. Similarly, EITI may serve as a spur to national legislation to strengthen \nregulation of the extractive sector.  \n \nOne barrier to implementation has been a simple lack of accounting expertise. The NGOs \nPublish What You Pay and Transparency International train budget activists, and the Revenue Watch \nInstitute has developed educational materials for journalists and civil society groups. The World Bank \nhas launched an \u201cEITI++\u201d program that assists host governments from the initial bid tendering stage \nthrough expenditure management. The ability of these initiatives for fostering civil society, as distinct \nfrom providing technical assistance to functioning civil society groups, is unclear. Ultimately, EITI is \nonly as effective as there are mechanisms, including a free press, which allows citizens to exert \naccountability over their government. In this regard, Myanmar\u2019s recent moves toward greater budget \ntransparency, and enhanced civil and political freedoms, including critically, press freedoms, make it \nmore likely that EITI can function successfully as intended in Myanmar. \n \nProducers from nonsignatory countries are steadily becoming entangled in the regime. One \nprong is EITI itself\u2014as more countries begin implementing EITI, and validation standards tighten, \nmore and more companies will be subject to host government pressure to participate.  \n                                                 \n21   See EITI website.  http://eiti.org/supporters/companies(accessed 20 November 2014). \n22   Myanmar has a legal regime for timber exports requiring certification by Myanmar Timber Enterprise and exportation via \nthe port of Yangon. Neighboring importing countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand, also have laws \nprohibiting the importation of illegal Myanmar timber. However, the enforcement of these laws is ineffective, and \nimproper certification of illegally logged timber has created problems exporting to the EU and the US (Woods 2013).  \n23 For example, Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil CEO, subsequently argued that host country adherence to EITI signals a \ncommitment to strengthen the business-enabling environment, and for example, encouraged Equatorial Guinea to join \n(Aaronson 2011). (The country began the implementation process but was delisted in 2010.) ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   25 \n \nThe other prong consists of laws and regulations in the US, the EU, and other jurisdictions. \nForeign firms listing on US stock exchanges must observe US law, which embodies increasing rigor with \nrespect to transparency and disclosure.24 Companies are expected to begin reporting in 2015\u20132016.25 \n \nIn the case of the EU, the European Commission proposed one set of rules in June 2012, but \nthe European Parliament passed stricter regulations in September 2012. After consultations, in April \n2013, the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation going further than Dodd-Frank, \nrequiring resource companies to publish total payments, taxes on profits or production, royalties \ndividends,  bonuses,  related  fees,  and  payments  for  infrastructure  improvements,  for  any  project \ngenerating more than \u20ac100,000 in revenues. Together, the US and the EU regulations would cover \nabout  70%  of  value  in  global  extractive  industries.  As  of  November  2014,  an  Extractive  Sector \nTransparency Measures Act, supported by Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, is before the \nCanadian parliament.    \n \nBribery of public officials is broadly illegal throughout the world due to the 1977 Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which American authorities have applied extraterritorially, and the \ncounterpart 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International \nBusiness Transactions,26 and similar national and regional laws passed since (Danielsen and Kennedy \n2011). So, for example, Britain\u2019s 2010 Bribery Act goes farther than FCPA, making it illegal to receive a \nbribe or bribe private officials, but also contains an adequate preventative measures provision that \nwould appear to make it marginally easier for a defendant to insulate itself legally from the profit \nmaximizing malfeasance of its employees and agents (Rose-Ackerman 2010, Danielsen and Kennedy \n2011).  \n \nThe oil and gas sector appears to be especially prone to bribery (Weisman 2008, Sanyal 2012 \nTable 1). There is some statistical evidence that the US anticorruption enforcement officials may act \naltruistically, imposing proportionately greater fines for violations committed in low-income countries \n(Choi and Davis 2012). Whether employees of SEEs and SWFs count as \u201cforeign officials\u201d under FCPA \nis an unresolved issue that may take on greater salience in the future (Rose 2012). So, for example, if \nthe management of Myanmar SEEs are defined as \u201cforeign officials\u201d for the purposes of the US law, \nthen bribery involving management of Myanmar SEEs by firms falling under the jurisdiction of the  \n   \n                                                 \n24   According to Moran (2012), in 2012 the Hong Kong Stock Exchange adopted similar rules.  \n25   The  American  Petroleum  Institute  filed  a  lawsuit  to  block  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) \nimplementation of Section 1504. The industry position is that subjecting the US and the EU firms to these requirements \nwould create an unleveled playing field with respect to their non-Western competitors, and that the disclosure \nrequirement could conflict with confidentiality agreements required by some host governments, including Angola, \nCameroon, the PRC, and Qatar, effectively requiring firms to break either the law of the US and/or the EU, or the law of \ntheir hosts. The US and the EU laws assert their primacy in this situation. In July 2013, the US District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia ruled in favor of the oil companies, accepting the industry\u2019s argument that the payment reports \nshould go to the SEC privately and not be made public. The court sent the regulations back to the SEC for revision. What \nmay be revised, and what, if any, impact the court ruling might have for developments in the EU, Canada, and elsewhere \nare unclear at this writing. Large US firms such as Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, and CononoPhilips would still be covered under \nthe stricter EU laws since they list on European stock exchanges. \n26 This convention has been ratified by all members of the OECD as well as six non-member countries--Argentina, Brazil, \nBulgaria, Colombia, Russian Federation, and South Africa. Enforcement is via national law, with a peer-review mechanism \nto encourage diligence.  \n ", "26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 428 \nFCPA would be subject to prosecution in the US.27 This is a potentially powerful tool for anticorruption \nactivities within Myanmar, insofar as Myanmar authorities could appeal to counterparts in the US, the \nEU,  and  other  jurisdictions  with  strong  antibribery  statutes,  for  assistance  in  investigation  and \nprosecutions. So, for example, the government of Ghana successfully enlisted the US Department of \nJustice participation in an investigation into corruption in that country\u2019s oil industry that involved a \nfirm located in the US. \n \nUltimately, the effectiveness of EITI and other good governance initiatives to generate better \ndevelopment outcomes in the long run is conditioned on a number of political and institutional factors, \nsuch as the existence of a free press and a robust civil society. Myanmar is making progress in these \nareas, though progress in these spheres is not plausibly under the control of the agencies implementing \nEITI and related initiatives. This simply underscores the need for a holistic approach to addressing \nthese multifaceted concerns. \n \n \nVI.   CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe government of Myanmar faces important decisions that will determine the future trajectory of \ngovernance reform, and condition long-run growth and poverty reduction. Since 2010, the pace of \nreform has been nothing short of stunning, yet significant challenges remain. While the agenda for \ncontinued  reform  is  extensive,  we  identify  the  following  agenda  items  as  crucial  for  enhancing \ngovernment effectiveness and locking in recent gains in this area: \n \ni.  Enhancing  bureaucratic  salaries  and  diversifying  the  candidate  pool  by  targeting \nunderrepresented groups and those likely to face some discrimination in the private labor \nmarket. \nii.  Developing an elite cadre of senior civil servants as a desirable career path. \niii.  Streamlining the number of line ministries, cutting their number roughly in half, while shifting \nstaffing to inter-ministerial coordinating secretariats. In particular, the government should \nconsider merging the Ministries of National Planning and Finance in order to unite strategic \nplanning and budgeting under one ministry. \niv.  Achieving a comprehensive cease-fire with various armed groups. \nv.  Reforming  electoral  law  to  encourage  development  of  more  national  parties,  either  by \nrequiring  parties  to  run  candidates  in  all  constituencies  or  by  introducing  some  form  of \npreference voting. \nvi.  Increasing involvement of the private sector (private industry, think tanks, and independent \neducational institutions) in the policy formation process. \nvii. The Ministry of Finance and Revenue should conduct a comprehensive land survey\u2014security \nconditions permitting\u2014in order to establish a current cadaster map of the country\u2019s territory \nand promote transparency about land use and tenure. \n                                                 \n27 The trend is clearly toward ratcheting up disclosure requirements for a broad swath of producers. For example, all four of \nthe PRC\u2019s major oil companies have foreign operations and all are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (therefore \nsubject to FCPA). Many of the PRC\u2019s major extractive firms are in joint ventures with Western multinationals, such as \nTotal, BP, and BHP Billiton, and thus are included in these operations by extension, though as Moran (2012) observes, \nthere may be significant gaps with respect to coverage of non-Western producers. Moran (2012, 2013) notes that a \nnumber of major Russian, Chinese, and Indian oil and mining companies do not list in New York or Hong Kong, China and \nthus would not be subject to EITI via those channels. The regulations also do not apply to foreign issuers of American \ndepository receipts such as Lukoil and Gazprom. ", "Myanmar: Cross-Cutting Governance Challenges   |   27 \nviii. Economic research reviewed in this chapter has demonstrated the link between rule of law and \nthe control of corruption with economic growth.  This implies using EITI as a means to leverage \nMyanmar\u2019s indigenous good governance efforts in the extractive sector, and more broadly, \nexploit opportunities to anchor broader policy reforms, including anticorruption efforts, to \ninternational best practices.  \n \nSpecifically, in implementing EITI, Myanmar can \n \ni.  require company by company disclosure; \nii.  extend EITI to oil, gas, minerals, and timber; \niii.  look favorably on bids by EITI stakeholder firms committed to transparency; and \niv.  participate in EITI+ and EITI++, extending the transparency initiative upstream to contracting \nand procurement, and downstream to expenditure. \n \nLikewise, a similar set of arguments hold for foreign anticorruption statutes, such as the US \nFCPA, more broadly.  Specifically, the government of Myanmar should look favorably on bids by firms \nbased in jurisdictions with strong antibribery laws and enforcement, thereby \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d on the \nmore  rigorous  standards  of  foreign  partners;  if  firms  that  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  those \ngovernments (whether they be headquartered in that country or not), while in Myanmar, engage in \npotential violations of the foreign country\u2019s anticorruption laws, then the government of Myanmar can \nappeal  to  the  foreign  government  for  support  in  prosecuting  corrupt  activity.  When  evaluating \npotential foreign participants in resource extraction, the government of Myanmar should take into \naccount whether those firms are subject to the laws of the US, the EU, or other jurisdictions with \nstrong antibribery laws and histories of extraterritorial legal cooperation, and give preference to those \nfirms (regardless of nationality) whose behavior in Myanmar will be constrained by anticorruption \nstatutes elsewhere. In short, Myanmar should use international initiatives, such as EITI and FCPA, to \nleverage its own reform efforts while building its own indigenous institutional capacity.   \n \n \n ", " \nREFERENCES \n \nAaronson, S.
