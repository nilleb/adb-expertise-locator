INtRoDuCtIoN\nThe choice of an appropriate social discount rate1 for cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis of public investment \nprojects has long been a contentious issue and subject to intense debate in the economics literature. \nThe recently released The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review has added new impetus to \nthis debate (Stern 2006). The Review issued a stunning warning that failing to invest 1 percent of \nworld gross domestic product (GDP) now to reduce global warming could risk a future reduction of \nup to 20% in global GDP. Critics have argued that these results, dramatically different from earlier \nstudies using the same basic data and analytical structure, depend crucially on a very low social \ndiscount rate\u20141.4%\u2014used in economic modeling. If a higher discount rate more in line with its \nusual range had been applied, the estimated cost of not acting now would be reduced by an order \nof magnitude (Nordhaus 2006 and Dasgupta 2006).\nA social discount rate reflects a society\u2019s relative valuation on today\u2019s well-being versus well-\nbeing in the future. Choosing an appropriate social discount rate is crucial for cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis, \nand has important implications for resource allocations. Setting the social discount rate too high \ncould preclude many socially desirable public projects from being undertaken, while setting it too low \nrisks making a lot of economically inef\ufffd\ufffdcient investments. \ufffdurther, a relatively high social discount \nrate, by attaching less weight to bene\ufffd\ufffdt and cost streams that occur in the distant future, favors \nprojects with bene\ufffd\ufffdts occurring at earlier dates; while a relatively low social discount rate favors \nprojects with bene\ufffd\ufffdts occurring at later dates. Choice of the social discount rate affects not only \nthe ex ante decision of whether a speci\ufffd\ufffdc public sector project deserves the funding, but also the \nex post evaluation of its performance. \nEconomic ef\ufffd\ufffdciency requires that the social discount rate measure the marginal social opportunity \ncost of funds allocated to public investment. In a perfectly competitive world without market \ndistortions, the market interest rate is the appropriate social discount rate. In the real world where \nmarkets are distorted, the market interest rate will no longer reflect marginal social opportunity \ncost of public funds. Economists have proposed several alternative approaches to the choice of \nthe social discount rate in the presence of market distortions, but there has been no consensus \non which is the most appropriate. The differences among these approaches reflect largely differing \nviews on how public investment affects domestic consumption, private investment, and the cost \nof international borrowing. In cases of very long-term projects with impacts lasting for more than \none generation or even hundreds of years, such as those addressing climate changes and other \nenvironment problems, many have argued that the choice of the social discount rate should not \nonly consider economic ef\ufffd\ufffdciency, but also intergenerational equity. \nThere are signi\ufffd\ufffdcant variations in public discount rate policies practised by countries around \nthe world, with developing countries in general applying higher social discount rates (8\u201315%) than \ndeveloped countries (3\u20137%). These variations reflect the different analytical approaches followed \nby various countries in choosing the social discount rate. But more fundamentally, it can be argued \n1  The social discount rate is sometimes also referred to as the cut-off economic internal rate of return (EIRR).", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nthat the divergence reflects differences in the perceived social opportunity cost of public funds \nacross countries and in the extent to which the issue of intergenerational equity is taken into \nconsideration in setting the social discount rate.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of the vast literature on the social discount \nrate that the decades of debate have generated, covering theory, estimation methods, and policy \npractices.2 More speci\ufffd\ufffdcally, the rest of the paper attempts to ask and answer the following \nquestions\ufffd\ufffd \n(i)  What are the economic arguments for discounting future bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs and analytical \napproaches to the choice of the social discount rate?\n(ii)  How can a social discount rate be estimated empirically under each approach?\n(iii)  What are the policy practices followed by countries around the world and by multilateral \ndevelopment banks (MDBs) in the choice of the social discount rate? \nThe choice of social discount rate is also an important issue for MDBs, including the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and has signi\ufffd\ufffdcant relevance for their operations. In both ex ante \nproject economic analysis and ex post project performance evaluation, most MDBs estimate and \nevaluate bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs of development projects using a uniform cut-off discount rate, also \ncalled economic internal rate of return (EIRR), of 10\u201312 percent.

Approaches to Discounting Future benefits and Costs: unsettled Debate\nA public investment project typically incurs costs and generates bene\ufffd\ufffdts at different points \nof time. A common practice in cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis, called discounting, is to express all costs and \nbene\ufffd\ufffdts in terms of their present value by assigning smaller weights to those that occur further \naway in the future than to those occurring more recently. Discounting, a critical step in determining \nwhether or not a public project is socially desirable, makes costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts with different time \npaths comparable.3\nThere are two arguments why costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts with different time pro\ufffd\ufffdles may not be \ncomparable if not properly discounted. The \ufffd\ufffdrst is that consumers (or savers) prefer to receive \nthe same amount of goods and services sooner rather than later. There are two standard textbook \nexplanations for this time preference (Dasgupta and Pearce 1972). The \ufffd\ufffdrst is that individuals expect \ntheir level of consumption to increase in the future, hence, marginal utility of consumption will \ndiminish. With this expectation, individuals would have to be paid more than one unit in the future \nto compensate for sacri\ufffd\ufffdcing (saving) one unit of consumption now. The second explanation, which \n2 There have been a number of surveys and reviews of this subject in the literature (Stiglitz 1994, Spackman 2004, Evans \n2005). Most of these focus either on theory, empirical estimation, or policy practices; not many look at all the three \naspects at the same time. \n3 Discounting is also required in investment decision making in the private sector where the present value of \ufffd\ufffdnancial \nbene\ufffd\ufffdts of a project is compared with that of \ufffd\ufffdnancial costs.\n\u0018  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\nhas been a subject of great controversy (see Box 1), is that individuals have a positive pure time \npreference, that is, even if levels of future consumption are not expected to change, they would still \ndiscount the future. Two reasons are often quoted in explaining the pure time preference. One is \nthat consumers are generally \u201cimpatient\u201d or \u201cmyopic.\u201d The other is the risk of not being alive in the \nfuture. According to these lines of reasoning, the rate to discount future bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs should \nbe the marginal social rate of time preference (SRTP), that is, the rate at which society is willing \nto postpone a marginal unit of current consumption in exchange for more future consumption.4 \nThe second argument for discounting future costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts takes the perspective of a producer \n(or an investor). According to this, capital is productive and resources acquired for a particular \nproject can be invested elsewhere, generate returns, and so have an opportunity cost. Therefore, \nto persuade an investor to invest in a project, the expected return from the investment should be \nat least as high as the opportunity cost of funding, which is the expected return from the next \nbest investment alternative. \ufffdollowing this logic, the rate the investor should use in discounting \nbene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs of a project is the marginal rate of return on investment in the private sector. \nIn the absence of market distortions, this is equivalent to the marginal social rate of return on \nprivate investment, also termed marginal social opportunity cost of capital (SOC). \nIn a perfectly competitive economy without distortions, prices of inputs and outputs would \nreflect their economic or social values. The supply and demand prices of investible funds are given \nby SRTP and SOC, respectively. The capital market clears at an interest rate that equates the supply \nof and demand for investible funds. Both SRTP and SOC are equal to the market interest rate. The \nmarket interest rate reflects marginal social opportunity cost of investible funds, which is then the \nappropriate social discount rate to achieve an ef\ufffd\ufffdcient allocation of resources in the economy.\nIn reality, the market is often distorted due to various imperfections. A typical example of \nimperfection is the taxes imposed on corporate incomes and individuals\u2019 interest earnings. Other \nexamples are risks, information asymmetry, and externalities. These imperfections create a wedge \nbetween SRTP and SOC (with the former generally lower than the latter), and make both deviate \nfrom the market interest rate. Under such circumstances, the market interest rate will not reflect \nthe marginal social opportunity cost of public funds, and the latter will vary depending on whether \nit is measured in terms of SRTP or SOC. What rate then should be used to discount future bene\ufffd\ufffdts \nand costs in cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis? The debate on this has been ongoing for many decades. \ufffdour \nalternative approaches have been put forward\ufffd\ufffd (i) SRTP, (ii) SOC, (iii) weighted average approach, \nand (iv)  shadow price of capital (SPC) approach. However, there has been no consensus on which \nis the most appropriate (Boardman et al. 2001). In essence, these different approaches reflect \ndiffering views on how public projects affect domestic consumption, private investment, and cost \nof international borrowing. \nEarlier discussions on public sector discounting coincided with the rise of cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis \nin the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s, the choice of the social discount rate was brought up again \nin the context of \ufffd\ufffdnding a rate to discount the long-term environmental bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs, such as \nthose related to addressing climate changes and global warming. Here, the problem of choosing an \nappropriate discount rate is further complicated by the consideration of intergenerational equity. In \nthe following subsections, we review in some detail how the social discount rate can be estimated \nunder each of the four approaches, and the latest debate on how to choose a discount rate for \nvery long-lived environmental projects.\n4 Here we disregard the issues involved in aggregating individual preferences into the social preference. See Dasgupta \nand Pearce (1972) for discussions on these issues.\n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  \u0018", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nb.  social Rate of time Preference\nThe social rate of time preference is the rate at which a society is willing to postpone a unit \nof current consumption in exchange for more future consumption. The use of SRTP as the social \ndiscount rate, supported by Sen (1961), Marglin (1963a and b), Diamond (1968), and Kay (1972), \nis based on the argument that public projects displace current consumption, and streams of costs \nand bene\ufffd\ufffdts to be discounted are essentially streams of consumption goods either postponed or \ngained. Two alternative methods have been suggested for empirical estimation of SRTP. One is to \napproximate it by the after-tax rate of return on government bonds or other low-risk marketable \nsecurities. Although this is straightforward, a major concern is that individuals may not express all \ntheir preferences concerning the future in the marketplace and, even if they do, their preferences \nexpressed as individuals may not be the same as their preferences expressed when they see \nthemselves as part of a society. Society as a whole would have a lower rate of discount in its \ncollective attitude than the observed market rates, which could reflect individuals\u2019 myopia (Dasgupta \nand Pearce 1972). \nThe other method is to use a formula named after the renowned British economist \ufffdrank P. \nRamsey. According to Ramsey\u2019s formula derived from a growth model, SRTP is the sum of two terms\ufffd\ufffd \nthe \ufffd\ufffdrst is a utility discount rate reflecting the pure time preference and the second is the product \nof two parameters\u2014the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption5 and the annual rate of \ngrowth of per capita real consumption (Ramsey 1928). The second term of the formula reflects \nthe fact that, when consumption is expected to grow in the future, people will be less willing to \nsave in the current period to obtain more in the future, because of diminishing marginal utility of \nconsumption. Using the Ramsey formula to empirically estimate SRTP requires information on the \nutility discount rate (\u03c1), elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (\u03b8), and annual rate of per \ncapita real consumption growth (g). The choice of g is relatively straightforward while the choice \nof \u03c1 and \u03b8 is more dif\ufffd\ufffdcult, as it involves normative value judgments, and has been a subject of \nintense debate, as discussed in Box 1.\nThe utility discount rate, \u03c1, is conceptually considered as consisting of two components, one \nrelated to individuals\u2019 impatience or myopia and the other related to the risk of death or human \nrace extinction.6 Many empirical studies set the \ufffd\ufffdrst component to zero often on the ethical ground \n(see, for example, Kula 1984, 1987, and 2004; Cline 1992; Stern 2006). It has also been argued \nthat considering myopia in estimating SRTP implies introducing irrationality into the decision-\nmaking process, which is inconsistent with the principle of cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis, i.e., to bring \nrationality into investment decisions (Kula 1984). The dif\ufffd\ufffdculty in empirically estimating this \ufffd\ufffdrst \ncomponent of pure time preference could also be a reason why many studies have ignored it. On \nthe other hand, setting this to zero does lead to some paradoxical results (see Box 1). Among \nempirical studies that consider this to be positive, the suggested range is 0\u20130.5% (OXERA 2002). \nScott (1977 and 1989) argues that the long-run savings behavior in the United Kingdom (UK) is \nconsistent with a value of 0.3\u20130.5% for this component of \u03c1. Table 1 provides a survey of some \nof the empirical studies on the utility discount rate including both of its two components. The \nsuggested range is 1\u20133 percent.\n5 The elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is the percentage change in individuals\u2019 marginal utility corresponding \nto each percentage change in consumption.\n6 In the literature, some authors relate the pure time preference only to the \ufffd\ufffdrst component while most relate it to \nboth. In this paper, we follow the convention used by most authors\ufffd\ufffd pure time preference reflects both individuals\u2019 \nimpatience and risk of not being alive in the future.\n4  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\n\ufffdor the component of the utility discount rate related to the risk of not being alive in the \nfuture, the controversy is not on whether it should be considered; rather, it is on how to measure \nthis risk. Some attempt to estimate individuals\u2019 survival probability and risk of death using death \nrate statistics (Kula 1984, 1987, 2004). Others argue that individuals\u2019 risk of death is not relevant \nto the derivation of the social time preference; what is relevant is the changing life chance for \nwhole generations (Pearce and Ulph 1999).\nbox 1\nThe debaTe on Pure Time Preference\nMany argue that the positive pure time preference, which implies valuing utility of future \ngenerations less than the present generation, is ethically indefensible (Ramsey 1928, Pigou 1932, \nHarrod 1948, Solow 1974). Others, while admitting that ethically all generations should be treated alike, \npoint out that a zero rate of pure time preference implies a savings rate excessively higher than what we \nnormally observe and contradicts real world savings behavior, leading also to other paradoxical results \n(Arrow 1995). There are also those who argue that the risk of death, or mortality, is a rational enough \nreason for positive pure time preference (Eckstein 1961). This argument, although more amenable to \nempirical investigation and less prone to fundamental disputes about value judgments, is also subject \nto disagreement about what precise risks are being discussed (Pearce and Ulph 1999). Dasgupta and \nPearce (1972) highlight the problem of considering risk-of-death time preference in calculating the \nsocial discount rate, because the social time preference relates to society, and not to an aggregate of \nindividuals; although individuals are mortal and society is not. Among more recent empirical studies, \nsome authors look at the increasing risk of death, or changing survival probability, for an individual \nas one gets older (Kula 1985, 1987, 2004; Evans and Sezer 2004). Pearce and Ulph (1999) highlight \nproblems of this approach, and argue that when dealing with very long-lived projects, the appropriate \nrisks are not so much the increasing probability of death of a single individual, but what is happening \nto the life chances of whole generations. Newbery (1992) attempts to measure this risk by estimating \nthe perceived risk of the end of mankind in 100 years. The Green Book of the UK HM Treasury refers to \nthis as a catastrophe risk, that is, the likelihood that there will be some events so devastating that \nall returns from policies, programs, or projects are eliminated, or at least radically and unpredictably \naltered (HM Treasury 2003). The Stern Review de\ufffd\ufffdnes this as the risk of extinction of the human race \nand argues that such risks could arise from possible shocks such as a meteorite, a nuclear war, or a \ndevastating outbreak of some diseases.\nEmpirical estimates of the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (\u03b8) also vary from \none study to another. Three different approaches have been used\ufffd\ufffd direct survey methods; indirect \nbehavioral evidence; and revealed social values (see a recent review by Evans 2005). The survey \nmethods focus on measuring risk and inequality aversion7 from responses to specially designed \nsurvey questions. The indirect behavioral evidence is based on observed consumption behaviors \nfrom empirically estimated consumer demand models. The third approach in estimating \u03b8 involves \ninference from government behavior revealed through spending and tax policies. A survey of \nempirical estimates of \u03b8 based on the three approaches indicates that its values mostly fall within \nthe range from 1 to 2%, except for a few outliers (Table 2). The differences suggest that the results \n7 RRiisskk aavveerrssiioonn mmeeaassuurreess tthhee rreelluuccttaannccee ooff aann iinnddiivviidduuaall ttoo aacccceepptt aa bbaarrggaaiinn wwiitthh aann uunncceerrttaaiinn ppaayyooffff rraatthheerr tthhaann \nanother bargain with a more certain but possibly lower expected payoff. Inequality aversion measures an individual\u2019s \ntolerance to income inequality. Risk aversion is closely related to inequality aversion, and both are closely related to \nthe elasticity of marginal utility of consumption.\n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  \u0018", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nare sensitive to model speci\ufffd\ufffdcation, level of aggregation in the data, choice of estimators, sample \nsize, and the length of sample periods.\nTable 1\nemPirical eSTimaTeS of The uTiliTy diScounT raTe\n \nSource emPirical eSTimaTeS  TheoreTical baSiS\nScott (1977) 1.5% Component reflecting myopia is 0.5%, and \nthat reflecting the changing life chance due \nto the risk of total destruction of a society is \n1.0%\nKula (1985) 2.2% Reflecting average annual survival probability \nin the UK during 1900\u22121975\nKula (1987) 1.2% Reflecting average annual probability of \ndeath in the UK in 1975\nScott (1989) 1.3% Component reflecting myopia is 0.3%, and \nthat reflecting the changing life chance due \nto the risk of total destruction of a society is \n1.0%\nNewbery (1992) 1.0% Perceived risk of the end of mankind in 100 \nyears\nDynamic Integrated  3% per year  Utility discount rate reflecting pure social \nModel of Climate and the  time preference, determined by calibrating \nEconomy (DICE) model  the DICE model to match actual data\n(Nordhaus 1993)\nPearce and Ulph (1995) 1.1% Reflecting the average annual probability of \ndeath in the UK in 1991\nArrow (1995) 1% Utility discount rate reflecting pure social \ntime preference, and matching the observed \nsavings behavior\nOXERA (2002) Myopia = 0-0.5% Based on previous studies and projected and \nRisk of death = 1.1% with  recent average annual death rates in the UK\na projected change in the \nnear future to 1.0%\nEvans and Sezer (2004) 1.0\u20131.5% 1% for EU countries and 1.5% for non-EU \ncountries, reflecting catastrophe risks\nKula (2004) 1.3% Reflecting the average annual death rate in \nIndia during 1965\u20131995\nEvans (2006) 1% Based on the approximate average annual \ndeath rate in 2002\u20132004 in 15 countries of \nthe European Union\nStern Review (2006) 0.1% Probability of human race extinction per year\nSources\ufffd\ufffd Compiled by authors.\n\u0018  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\nTable 2\nemPirical eSTimaTeS of The elaSTiciTy of marginal uTiliTy of conSumPTion\nSource emPirical eSTimaTeS  daTeS\nA. survey Method\nBarsky et al.

If additional public investment is made at the \ncost of displacing private investment, its marginal social opportunity cost should also reflect what \nthe displaced private investment would otherwise bring to the society, which can be measured \nby the marginal social rate of return on private sector investment (SOC).8 Since SRTP is generally \nlower than SOC because of the wedge created by market distortions such as taxes, this raises the \npossibility that too many low-return investments in the public sector would be undertaken when \nSRTP is used as the social discount rate.\nC.  Marginal social opportunity Cost of Capital\nThe proposal for using the marginal social opportunity cost of capital (SOC) as the social \ndiscount rate, advocated by Mishan (1967), Baumol (1968), and Diamond and Mirrlees (1971a \nand b), among others, is based on the argument that resources in any economy are scarce; that \ngovernment and private sector compete for the same pool of funds; that public investment displaces \nprivate investment dollar by dollar; and those devoted to public sector projects could be invested \nin the private sector. Therefore, public investment should yield at least the same return as private \ninvestment. If not, total social welfare can be increased by reallocating resources to the private \nsector, which yields higher returns. \nIt has been suggested that SOC could be approximated by the marginal pretax rate of return \non riskless private investments. A good proxy for this is the real pretax rate on top-rated corporate \nbonds (Moore et al. 2004). Box 3 provides an illustration of estimating the marginal rate of return \nbased on Moody\u2019s AAA bonds. Some have argued that SOC, as estimated in Box 3 should be adjusted \ndownward for a number of reasons (Lind 1982, Boardman et al. 2001). \ufffdirst, in theory, the marginal \npretax rate of return, rather than the average rate, should be used in estimating SOC. The marginal \nrate of return will be lower than the average rate as rational businessmen will make their best deal \n\ufffd\ufffdrst. Second, the rate of return on private investment includes premiums to compensate investors \nfor risks that are generally higher than those for public sector investment. Third, returns on private \ninvestment as social opportunity cost of capital may also be contaminated by market distortions \nsuch as externalities and monopolistic pricing.\nbox 3\neSTimaTing Soc from yieldS on corPoraTe bondS\nBased on the method used by Boardman et al. (2001), the average annual yield on Moody\u2019s AAA \nlong-term corporate bonds was estimated at 6.81% from January 1947 to December 2005 in the United \nStates (US). Applying the 2004 corporate tax rate of 40% (KPMG 2004), the nominal pre-tax return on \nbonds was calculated at [0.0681 / (1- 0.38)] = 11.35 percent. A proxy for the expected rate of inflation \nis the average annual inflation rate, which was 3.78% between 1947 and 2005 in the United States. \nTherefore, the real pretax rate of return on top-rated corporate bonds in the US is [(0.1135 \u2013 0.0378) / \n(1+0.0378)] = 7.29%, which approximates SOC.\n8 This can be approximated by the pretax rate of return on private investment. See discussions in the next \nsubsection.\n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  9", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nDasgupta, Marglin, and Sen (1972), on the other hand, note that the argument for using SOC \nas the social discount rate is only justi\ufffd\ufffded in the context of a two-period model where the total \namount of capital available for investment is \ufffd\ufffdxed independently of project choice in the public \nsector. In this case, the public investment displaces (or crowds out) private investment dollar \nfor dollar, and the marginal rate of return on private investment (inclusive of taxes) provides an \nadequate measure of SOC. But when either assumption (two-period model or \ufffd\ufffdxed amount of capital) \nis dropped, the argument would not hold anymore. If capital needed for \ufffd\ufffdnancing public projects \nis partially satis\ufffd\ufffded by consumers postponing their current consumption, the return required by \nconsumers usually is less than the marginal rate of return on private investment; hence, the social \ndiscount rate should be lower than SOC.\nD.  Weighted Average Approach\nPrevious discussions suggest that using SRTP to discount future costs and benefits is \nproblematic since it does not take into account impacts of public projects on funds available for \nprivate investment. Using SOC as the social discount rate, on the other hand, assumes that public \ninvestment only displaces private investment and not private consumption, which is also not always \ntrue in reality. The weighted average approach, associated with contributions by, among others, \nHarberger (1972), Sandmo and Dr\u00e8ze (1971), and Burgess (1988), attempts to reconcile the SRTP \napproach with that of SOC.\nProponents of the weighted average approach recognize that sources of funds available to \npublic projects may come from displacing private investment, inducing consumers to postpone current \nconsumption, and, in the case of an open economy, borrowing from international capital markets. \nThe social opportunity costs of funds from these various sources are different because of market \ndistortions such as taxes. Thus, the social discount rate should be the weighted average of SOC, \nSRTP, and the cost of foreign borrowing, with weights reflecting proportions of funds obtained from \ntheir respective sources. Harberger (1972) argues that SOC may differ from one productive sector to \nanother and SRTP could also vary among different groups of savers (reflecting, for instance, different \ntax brackets); therefore, SOC and SRTP themselves should be the weighted average of those of various \nproductive sectors or saver groups. Burgess (1988) suggests that the weights depend also on the \ndegree of complementarity or substitutability between public and private investment, but points out \nthat the positive externalities of public investment due to its complementarity can be considered \nas part of bene\ufffd\ufffdt streams and, in that case, no adjustments to the weights are necessary.  \n\ufffdor a closed economy, if the supply of funds is perfectly inelastic, a public sector project will \ndisplace only private investment, so the weight for SRTP will be zero and the social discount rate \nwill be equal to SOC. If, on the other hand, the demand for funds is perfectly inelastic, a public \nproject will only displace current consumption, the weight for SOC will be zero, and the social \ndiscount rate will be equal to SRTP. In general, it is believed that both the supply and demand of \ninvestible funds respond to changes in the market interest rate, so the social discount rate will \nlie somewhere between the two extremes. Harberger (1972), however, argues that the accumulated \neconometric evidence on investment functions clearly shows that many categories of investment \nare quite sensitive to changes in the interest rate, while evidence that savings are responsive to \ninterest rate changes is only scanty. Hence, there is a reasonable presumption that the relevant \nweighted average will be reasonably close, if not precisely equal, to SOC.\n10  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\n\ufffdor an open economy where capital is mobile across countries, it is expected that the domestic \ninterest rate will be related in some way to the interest rate at which the country can borrow in \nthe world capital market (Sandmo and Dr\u00e8ze 1971, Edwards 1986, Lind 1990). In the extreme case \nof a small open economy with perfect capital mobility, risk neutrality, pegged exchange rate (with \nzero expected devaluation), and an in\ufffd\ufffdnitely elastic supply of foreign capital, public projects will \ndisplace neither domestic consumption nor private investment. The weights for SOC and SRTP will, \ntherefore, both be zero and the social discount rate will be equal to the international borrowing \nrate. However, Edwards (1986) argues that even a small economy with perfect capital mobility will \nface an upward-sloping supply curve of foreign capital. One justi\ufffd\ufffdcation is that a higher level of \nforeign indebtedness could be related to a higher probability of default as perceived by lenders, and \nto a higher cost at which this particular country can borrow from the international capital market. \nIn this case, a public project that is (partially) \ufffd\ufffdnanced with additional foreign debt will result in \na higher rate charged on foreign loans, and perhaps, higher domestic interest rates as well since \nthe two are linked. Therefore, a public project will be \ufffd\ufffdnanced partially by an increase in foreign \ndebt, and partially by an increase in private savings and a reduction in private investment. Then, \nin the presence of country risk premiums, the social discount rate will be a weighted average of \nSOC, SRTP, and the international borrowing rate inclusive of risk premiums.9 In another extreme, \nif a country faces credit rationing from abroad, the new demand for public funds will be met fully \nby additional domestic private savings and displaced private investment. Then, the social discount \nrate will be a weighted average of only SOC and SRTP.\nA key challenge in the empirical estimation of the social discount rate using the weighted \naverage approach is to determine the weights attached to SRTP, SOC, and the international borrowing \nrate, as well as weights for SRTPs of various saver groups and for SOCs of various productive sectors. \nHarberger (1972) provides a formula for calculating the social discount rate using the weighted \naverage approach in the case of a closed economy, where the weights are estimated from interest \nderivatives (the responses of private investment and savings to changes in market interest rates), \nwhich can also be expressed in terms of elasticities. Sandmo and Dr\u00e8ze (1971) expands the formula \nto an open economy context by incorporating the international borrowing rate, with weights being \nestimated from the interest derivatives of the domestic and foreign supplies of funds. Based on \nHarberger and Jenkins (2002), Box 4 provides an example using the weighted average approach to \nestimate the social discount rate, assuming varying SRTP among saver groups, varying SOC among \nproductive sectors, taxation on interest earnings (including withholding tax for foreign savers) and \non investment returns, and an upward-sloping supply curve of foreign capital. \nA major criticism on the weighted average approach is that, while it recognizes that costs \nof public investment can displace private investment, it assumes that bene\ufffd\ufffdts will be consumed \nimmediately and ignores the fact that they could also be reinvested in the private sector, generate \nfuture consumption, and bring more social value than if they were consumed immediately. Recognizing \nhigher social cost of displaced private investment than displaced consumption, while ignoring the \nhigher social value of project bene\ufffd\ufffdts that are reinvested than immediately consumed, leads to \noverdiscounting of project bene\ufffd\ufffdts. This overdiscounting will be higher the farther in the future \n9 Edwards (1986) argued that whether this higher interest rate should be considered as a higher cost of borrowing \nwill depend on the relationship between the probability of default as perceived by the lenders and by borrowers. If \nthe perceived probability of default is the same for lenders and borrowers, the higher interest rate charged to the \ndeveloping country will not represent a higher economic cost of foreign funds. But in general, the perceived probability \nof default is different between lenders and borrowers (the former is mostly greater than the latter); the risk premium \ndoes constitute economic cost for a borrowing country.\n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  11", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nthe bene\ufffd\ufffdts occur.

The example assumes that there are four savers groups\ufffd\ufffd households, business, government, \nand foreign. \ufffdor each saver group, the real rate of return on savings was calculated from the nominal \nmarket interest rate by taking out the respective taxes and inflation. In estimating the real marginal \ncost of foreign borrowing, further adjustment was made by taking into consideration the effects of \nnew borrowing on the country\u2019s foreign borrowing rate. In the case of investors or demanders of funds, \nthey were classi\ufffd\ufffded into the following sectors\ufffd\ufffd housing, agriculture, manufacturing, government, and \nmining. The nominal pre-tax rate of return on investment for each sector was again calculated from the \nnormal market interest rate by adding respective tax rates. \nThese rates, together with the estimated saving shares and elasticities of various saver and \ninvestor groups, yield an estimated economic cost of capital, or the social discount rate, of 11.76 \npercent. Detailed calculations are in the Appendix.\nSource\ufffd\ufffd Harberger and Jenkins (2002).\nE.  shadow Price of Capital Approach\nThe shadow price of capital (SPC) approach, associated with contributions by \ufffdeldstein (1972), \nBradford (1975), and Lind (1982) among others, also attempts to reconcile the SRTP approach with \nthat of SOC and, at the same time, addresses the limitation of the weighted average approach. The \n1\u0018  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\nSPC approach recognizes that while costs of a public project can displace private investment, its \nbene\ufffd\ufffdts can also be reinvested in the private sector. In terms of generated future consumption \nstreams, these bene\ufffd\ufffdts are worth more to society than if they are consumed immediately. Thus, the \ntotal cost of a public project is the sum of the current consumption that is directly displaced and \nthose future consumption streams that are foregone due to the displacement of private investment. \nSimilarly, the total bene\ufffd\ufffdt of a public project is the sum of those immediately consumed and those \nfuture consumption streams generated from reinvestment. \nThe SPC approach involves four steps. The \ufffd\ufffdrst is estimating SPC, which is the present value \nof streams of future consumption foregone arising from displacing one unit of private investment \nor the present value of future consumption streams generated from reinvesting one unit of project \nbene\ufffd\ufffdts in the private sector. The second step involves, for each time period, converting all the \ncosts and bene\ufffd\ufffdts that either displace or generate private investment into consumption equivalents \nby multiplying them by SPC. The third step is adding these costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts to the other portions \nof costs (in the form of directly displaced consumption) and of bene\ufffd\ufffdts (in the form of immediate \nconsumption), respectively. \ufffdinally, discount the total cost and bene\ufffd\ufffdt streams at SRTP to calculate \nthe net present value (NP\ufffd) (see Box 5). \nZerbe and Dively (1994) discussed a number of situations where costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts need not \nbe adjusted by SPC\ufffd\ufffd\n(i)  \ufffdor a closed economy, if the fraction of bene\ufffd\ufffdts that return to private capital is equal to the \nfraction of costs that displace private investment, adjusting the costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts by SPC \ndoes not change the sign of the NP\ufffd of a project. In this case, a project is socially desirable if \nthe NP\ufffd is positive when applying SRTP as a discount rate to the ordinary costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts. \nThis is likely the case for many environmental projects where bene\ufffd\ufffdts are costs avoided whose \n\ufffd\ufffdnancing is similar to initial costs.\n(ii)  \ufffdor an open economy, if the supply of capital is highly or perfectly elastic, the displaced and \ngenerated private investment will be small and be similar in size, or both, will be zero, and it \nis then suf\ufffd\ufffdcient to discount bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs by the international borrowing rate without \nadjusting them by SPC.\n(iii)  \ufffdor least-cost analysis (also referred to as cost-effectiveness analysis), the goal is to compare \nthe costs of alternative methods of producing the same output. As long as the \ufffd\ufffdnancing of \nthe various alternatives is similar, adjustment by SPC is not warranted.\nWhen project costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts need to be adjusted by SPC, empirical estimation of SPC is \nwarranted, which requires information on the following parameters\ufffd\ufffd SOC, SRTP, depreciation rate, \nand marginal propensity to save. Lyon (1990) provides two alternative formulas to calculate SPC. \nOne applies when the savings rate is expressed in terms of the gross return, and the other applies \nwhen the savings rate is expressed in terms of the return net of depreciation. Box 5 provides \nthese formulas. The application of the SPC approach requires further information on proportions of \ndisplaced consumption and private investment due to project costs, and proportions of generated \nconsumption and reinvestment due to project bene\ufffd\ufffdts.\nThe SPC approach, although theoretically attractive (see \ufffdeldstein 1972, Bradford 1975, Lind \n1982) is dif\ufffd\ufffdcult to implement. The value of SPC is very sensitive to the values of SRTP and SOC, \nto how depreciation and reinvestment are assumed, and to the length of life of a project. Lyon \n(1990) shows that the value of SPC could vary from about one to in\ufffd\ufffdnity, depending on different \n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  1\u0018", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nassumptions on the values of the various parameters. Harberger and Jenkins (2002) argue that if \nthe SPC approach is employed, a different shadow price of capital has to be estimated for every \nproject according to the length of life of the project.

Discounting Intergenerational Projects \n\ufffdrom the mid-1990s, with the growing concerns over climate changes, global warming, and \nother environmental problems, there has been a renewed interest on whether and how discounting \nshould be applied to long-term projects, the effects of which spread over more than one generation \n(more than 30\u201340 years) or even hundreds of years, and whose present values are extremely \nsensitive to the choice of the discount rate. In evaluating intragenerational projects, it could be \nargued that the main issue is to achieve ef\ufffd\ufffdcient allocation of scarce resources, thus the discount \nrate should reflect the economic opportunity cost of capital. When evaluating intergenerational \nprojects, identifying an appropriate discount rate involves an additional challenge of considering \nintergenerational equity. \nWhat is common to the four approaches described above is that the discount rate, whatever \nit is, is time-invariant, implying that discounting would be exponential. With a constant discount \nrate, bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs that occur in the distant future will become very small in terms of their \n14  May 2007", "SecTion ii\nTheoreTical foundaTionS for The choice of a Social diScounT raTe\npresent value. Thus, it seems not worth investing even a little to avoid potential catastrophic \nconsequences of some environment problems if they will occur only far into the future. Since \nbene\ufffd\ufffdciaries of projects dealing with such type of problems will be future generations, attaching \nvery small weights to future bene\ufffd\ufffdts implied by exponential discounting does pose a question of \nwhether it is \u201cethically indefensible.\u201d Put simply\ufffd\ufffd why should the well-being derived from the same \nlevel of consumption of any future generation be given less weight than for the current generation \non the grounds of individuals being impatient? Many believe that this is not ethical, and the pure \nrate of time preference should be zero. Others argue that weighting generations equally leads to \nparadoxical and even nonsensical results (see Box 1). Apart from the ethical issue, exponential \ndiscounting implies that the importance of a cataclysmic event happening four centuries from now \nis much less signi\ufffd\ufffdcant relative to that of a cataclysmic event occurring, say, three centuries from \nnow. Weitzman (1998) argues that \u201calmost no one really feels this way about the distant future.\u201d\nSome have proposed a solution to the problem, which involves using a declining discount rate, \nnamely, \u201chyperbolic discounting\u201d (Weitzman 1994, 1998, 2001; Henderson and Langford 1998; Cropper \nand Laibson 1998). Hyperbolic discounting hypothesizes that the discount function with regard to \ntime is shaped like a hyperbola, thus allowing the discount rate to decline with time according to \nsome predetermined trajectory and raising the weight attached to the welfare of future generations. \nAccording to Weitzman (1998), \u201cnear future\u201d and \u201cfar future\u201d should be viewed differently because \nof different levels of uncertainties involved. Compared to the near future, the far distant future \nhas much greater uncertainties about economic growth, rate of capital accumulation, state of the \nenvironment, pace of technological progress, rate of pure time preference, etc. As a result, there \nis a wide range of possible discount rates for the far future, and a \u201ccertainty equivalent discount \nrate\u201d should be calculated as a weighted average of these possible discount rates. He shows that \nthe \u201ccertainty equivalent discount rate\u201d equals the lowest possible discount rate.10 This way he \nexplains why different discount rates should be used for near future projects and far distant future \nones. Over the past decades, there has also been increasing evidence from experiments conducted \nby economists and psychologists, which suggests that people do use a declining discount rate in \nmaking intertemporal choices (Weitzman 2001). \nA conceptual problem with time-declining discounting is that it leads to time-inconsistent \nplanning\ufffd\ufffd a person who applies a hyperbolic discount rate will not carry out the consumption plans \nmade today and reverse the decisions in the future even though no new information emerges (Cropper \nand Laibson 1998). Due to this type of problem, some have suggested that intergenerational equity \nshould be treated directly rather than through adjusting the discount rate (Lesser and Zerbe 1995, \nSchelling 1995). More speci\ufffd\ufffdcally, some argue that in the context of global warming mitigation, one \nshould not simply lower the discount rate used to evaluate costs and bene\ufffd\ufffdts of projects; in cases \nwhere there may be signi\ufffd\ufffdcant irreversibility and potential questions of intergenerational equity, \none should not rely on the project discount rate alone. Instead, a full analysis of all these concerns \nand options should be carried out separately and explicitly for informed choice and decision-making \n(Lind 1997, Nordhaus 1999, Kopp and Portney 1999, and Toman 1999). Henderson and Bateman \n(1995) suggest that discount rate sensitivity analysis may include hyperbolic discount rate results \n10 This is best illustrated through an example (Spackman 2004). Suppose in the long term that the discount rate is believed \nto be either 2% or 4%, with equal likelihood. The project bene\ufffd\ufffdts are worth $1 million in 500 years. The present value \nof the $1 million in 500 years  would be $50 using 2% discount rate, and almost $0 using 4% discount rate. Since two \ndiscount rates have an equal likelihood to occur, the expected present value of the project is about $25, the average \nof $50 and $0. This gives an \u201ceffective discount rate\u201d of 2.1%, close to the lower end of two possibilities. \n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  1\u0018", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nalong with classical constant discount rate results for intergenerational projects. There is also a \nsuggestion that the dilemma in the choice of the social discount rate for intergenerational projects \ncould be resolved by realizing that the problem is one of concern over missing values to ignoring \nethical values. This de\ufffd\ufffdciency could be overcome by incorporating moral values directly into the \ncost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis and, inter alia, recognizing all values for which there is a willingness to pay \n(Zerbe 2005). \nDespite the debates, there appears a general agreement that the SRTP should be used in \ndiscounting intergenerational projects. The Stern Review applies an SRTP of 1.4% to discount \ndamages of global warming, estimated using the Ramsey formula. It is the sum of two numbers\ufffd\ufffd \n0.1%, which is the rate of pure time preference reflecting solely the assumed risk of human race \nextinction,11 and 1.3%, which is the product of a unity elasticity of marginal utility of consumption \nand an expected annual growth rate of per capita real consumption reflecting the diminishing \nmarginal utility of consumption. Nordhaus (2006), in his critique of the Stern Review, argues that \nthe near-zero rate of pure time preference combined with the unity elasticity of the marginal utility \nof consumption is inconsistent with key economic variables observable in the real world such as \nthe real interest rate and saving rate. To match the observed values of these variables, either a \nhigher rate of pure time preference or higher elasticity of marginal utility of consumption has to be \nassumed, implying a much higher social discount. Using the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate \nand the Economy (DICE), he shows that if the rate of pure time preference is raised from 0.1% \n(as assumed by the Stern Review) to 3% at the beginning, then declining slowly to about 1% in \n300 years (matching key economic variables observable in the real world), the optimal base year \n(2005) carbon price would decrease from $159 to $17\u201320 per ton.12 He concluded that the radical \nrevision of the economics of climate change proposed by the Stern Review depends decisively on \nthe assumption of a near-zero rate of social time preference.  \nIII.  thE soCIAl DIsCouNt RAtE IN PRACtICE ARouND thE WoRlD\nSince there is no consensus as to which approach is the most appropriate for the choice of \na social discount rate, it is not surprising that there are signi\ufffd\ufffdcant variations in public discount \nrate policies in different countries around the world.

The optimal carbon price, or carbon tax, sometimes also called the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d, is the \ncalculated price of carbon emissions that will balance the incremental costs of reducing carbon emissions with the \nincremental bene\ufffd\ufffdts of reducing climate damages.\n1\u0018  May 2007", "SecTion iii\nThe Social diScounT raTe in PracTice around The World\nTable 4\nSocial diScounT raTeS in SelecTed counTrieS\ncounTry/ agency diScounT raTe TheoreTical baSiS\nAustralia 1991\ufffd\ufffd 8%; current\ufffd\ufffd SOC rate annually  SOC approach\nreviewed\nCanada 10% SOC approach\nPeople\u2019s Republic of  8% for short and medium term projects;  Weighted average approach\nChina lower than 8% rate for long-term projects\n\ufffdrance Real discount rate set since 1960; set at 8%  1985\ufffd\ufffd To keep a balance between \nin 1985 and 4% in 2005 public and private sector \ninvestment\n2005\ufffd\ufffd SRTP approach\nGermany 1999\ufffd\ufffd 4% Based on federal re\ufffd\ufffdnancing rate, \n2004\ufffd\ufffd 3% which over the late 1990s was \n6% nominal; average GDP deflator \n(2%) was subtracted giving 4% \nreal\nIndia 12% SOC approach\nItaly 5% SRTP approach\nNew Zealand  10% as a standard rate whenever there is no  SOC approach \n(Treasury) other agreed sector discount rate \nNorway 1978\ufffd\ufffd 7%  Government borrowing rate in \n1998\ufffd\ufffd 3.5% real terms\nPakistan  12% SOC approach\nPhilippines 15% SOC approach\nSpain 6% for transport; 4% for water SRTP approach\nUnited Kingdom 1967\ufffd\ufffd 8% SOC approach until early 1980s; \n1969\ufffd\ufffd 10% thereafter SRTP approach\n1978\ufffd\ufffd 5%\n1989\ufffd\ufffd 6%\n2003\ufffd\ufffd 3.5%\nDifferent rates lower than 3.5% for long-\nterm projects over 30 years\ncontinued.\n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  1\u0018", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\nTable 4. conTinued.\nUS (Of\ufffd\ufffdce of  Before 1992\ufffd\ufffd 10%; after 1992\ufffd\ufffd 7% Mainly SOC approach with \nManagement and  the rate being derived from \nBudget)  pretax return to private sector \ninvestment\nOther approaches (SPC, Treasury \nborrowing rates) are also \nmentioned\nUS (Congressional  Rate of marketable Treasury debt with  SRTP approach \nBudget Of\ufffd\ufffdce and  maturity comparable to project span\nGeneral Accounting \nOf\ufffd\ufffdce) \nUS (Environmental  Intragenerational discounting\ufffd\ufffd 2\u20133% subject  SRTP approach\nProtection Agency) to sensitivity analysis in the range of 2\u20133% \nand at 7%, as well as presentation of \nundiscounted cost and bene\ufffd\ufffdt streams\nIntergenerational discounting\ufffd\ufffd presentation \nof undiscounted cost and bene\ufffd\ufffdt streams \nsubject to sensitivity analysis in the range \nof 0.5\u20133% and at 7%\n  Sources\ufffd\ufffd Compiled by ADB staff.\nIn North America, Canada uses a rate of 10% based on the SOC approach, while in the US, \nthe situation is more complicated. The US Of\ufffd\ufffdce of Management and Budget (OMB) uses a discount \nrate that approximates the marginal pretax rate of return on private investment, thus following the \nSOC approach. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was speci\ufffd\ufffded at 10 percent. In 1992, OMB revised the \ndiscount rate to 7% (OMB 2003). The OMB also takes the view that the SPC discounting is \u201cthe \nanalytically preferred means of capturing the effects of government projects on resource allocation in \nthe private sector.\u201d In its Circular A-94, OMB indicates that the Treasury borrowing rates should be \nused as the discount rate in cost-effectiveness analysis, lease-purchase analysis, internal government \ninvestments, and asset sale analysis.\nThe US Congressional Budget Of\ufffd\ufffdce and the General Accounting Of\ufffd\ufffdce (1991) favor the use of \ndiscount rates based on government bond rates (Lyon 1990, Hartman 1990). They use the interest \nrate for marketable Treasury debt with maturity comparable to the program being evaluated as a \nbase case discount rate for cost bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis, thus favoring the SRTP approach. \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency supports using the SRTP approach in evaluating \nenvironmental projects (EPA 2000). It recommends that for intragenerational discounting, a rate of \n2\u20133% be used, which is reckoned to be the market interest rate after tax. The EPA further recommends \nundertaking sensitivity analysis of alternative discount rates in the range of 2\u20133% as well as at \n7% (prescribed by OMB), as this may provide useful information to decisionmakers. In addition, \nall analyses are required to present undiscounted bene\ufffd\ufffdt and cost streams. \ufffdor intergenerational \n1\u0018  May 2007", "SecTion iii\nThe Social diScounT raTe in PracTice around The World\nprojects or policies with intergenerational effects, the EPA prescribes that economic analyses should \ngenerally include a \u201cno discounting\u201d scenario by displaying undiscounted cost and bene\ufffd\ufffdt streams \nover time.

The discussion of the \nsensitivity analysis is required to include appropriate caveats regarding the state of the literature \nwith respect to discounting for very long time horizons.\nIn Europe, there is now a near convergence among of\ufffd\ufffdcial social discount rates (Evans 2006). \nGermany uses 3%, based on values of real long-term government bond rate. Norway has been \nusing a 3.5% discount rate after 1998\u2014also based on real government borrowing rate. \ufffdrance\u2019s \nCommissariat General du Plan in 2005 lowered its project discount rate to 4% based on the SRTP \napproach. Italy uses the SRTP approach to derive a 5% discount rate, while Spain adopts 4\u20136% \nfor different sectors. \nThe UK government indicates in the Green Book, Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government \n(HM Treasury 2003) that an SRTP of 3.5% should be used to discount future bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs of \npublic projects with a lifespan below 30 years. This \ufffd\ufffdgure is calculated on the basis of the estimates \nof the following three parameters\ufffd\ufffd (i) the rate of pure time preference at 1.5%; (ii) the elasticity \nof the marginal utility of consumption at around 1; and (iii) the output growth per capita over \nthe period 1950\u20131998 in the UK at 2.1 percent. \ufffdor projects with very long-term impacts (over \n30 years), the discount rate will depend on the length of their lifespan\ufffd\ufffd 3.0% for projects with a \nlifespan of 31\u201375 years; 2.5% with 76\u2013125 years; 2.0% with 126\u2013200 years; 1.5% with 201\u2013300 \nyears; and 1.0% with 301 years and beyond. \nIn Asia, the social discount rates adopted are generally higher. The Philippines and Pakistan \nuse 15% and 12%, respectively, both based on the SOC approach. India currently uses 12 percent. \nIn the PRC, according to National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Construction \n(2006), the economic cost of capital is a weighted average of social time preference and returns \non capital. The former is estimated to be around 4.5\u20136% and the latter around 9\u201311 percent. The \nsuggested social discount rate is 8% for short- and medium-term projects. The document also \nrecommends that a lower than 8% discount rate be adopted for projects with a long time horizon. \nIn Australia, the mandated discount rate was 8% before 1991 and, since then, there has been no \nprescribed benchmark social discount rate on the basis that the appropriate discount rate may vary \nfrom one year to another, and should be under continuous review. The New Zealand Treasury has a \nlong-standing discount rate of 10%, which was reaf\ufffd\ufffdrmed in its 2005 Cost Benefit Analysis primer \n(Rose 2006).\nb.  MDbs and other supra-National Agencies \nThe World Bank\u2019s Handbook on Economic Analysis of Investment Operations provides guidance on \nhow to calculate the social discount rate (Belli et al. 1998). The handbook states that the discount \nrate used should reflect not only the likely returns of funds in their best relevant alternative use \n(i.e., the opportunity cost of capital or \u201cinvestment rate of interest\u201d), but also the marginal rate \nat which savers are willing to save in the country (i.e., the rate at which the value of consumption \nfalls over time, or \u201cconsumption rate of interest\u201d). Therefore, the World Bank prescribes the weighted \n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  19", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\naverage approach. The World Bank traditionally has not calculated a discount rate but has used \n10\u201312% as a notional \ufffd\ufffdgure for cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis. The handbook further advises that task \nmanagers may use a different discount rate as long as departures from the 10\u201312% rate have been \njusti\ufffd\ufffded in the Country Assistance Strategy.\nADB\u2019s policy on the social discount rate, speci\ufffd\ufffded in its Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof Projects (ADB 1997), follows the World Bank approach. Although the Guidelines state that \n\u201ceconomic rates of return differ considerably between sectors and countries\u201d, and \u201cfrom time to \ntime, an appropriate discount rate for economic analysis should be calculated for each country to \ncompare with the existing practice\u201d, in practice, a single minimum rate of 10\u201312% has been used \nto calculate the net present value of a project, or to compare with the internal rate of return, for \neconomic analysis for all countries and all projects all the time. ADB would expect to \n(i)  accept all independent projects and subprojects with an EIRR of at least 12%;\n(ii)  accept independent projects and subprojects with an EIRR between 10 and 12% for which \nadditional unvalued bene\ufffd\ufffdts can be demonstrated, and where they are expected to exceed \nunvalued costs;\n(iii)  reject independent projects and subprojects with an EIRR between 10 and 12% for which \nno additional unvalued bene\ufffd\ufffdts can be demonstrated, or where unvalued costs are expected \nto be signi\ufffd\ufffdcant; and\n(iv)  reject independent projects and subprojects with an EIRR below 10 percent.\nOther MDBs have chosen a social discount rate more or less in the range similar to those of \nthe World Bank and ADB. In the case of the Inter-American Development Bank, a 12% discount \nrate is being used as a measure of the economic opportunity cost of capital while the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development uses 10 percent. The African Development Bank, based \non a review of various project appraisal reports, also uses a project discount rate ranging from 10 \nto 12 percent.  \nAmong supranational governmental agencies, the European Commission advocates a benchmark \ndiscount rate of 5% in real terms for cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis in the case of member countries of the \nEuropean Union. This is a compromise \ufffd\ufffdgure based on market interest rate, cost of capital, and \ntime preference considerations. However, the European Commission encourages member states to \nprovide their own benchmark for the project discount rate, which must then be applied consistently \nto all projects (see Evans 2006 and European Commission 2006). \nIn sum, there are signi\ufffd\ufffdcant variations in the social discount rate policy around the world. \nMost MDBs apply a rate of 10\u201312%, following the weighted average approach. Among individual \ncountries, most developed countries follow the SRTP approach and apply much lower discount rates, \nmostly in the range of 3\u20137%, with many revising the rates downward in recent years. On the other \nhand, the three Asian developing countries surveyed (India, Pakistan, and Philippines) follow the \nSOC approach, and apply a much higher rate, in the range of 12\u201315%, and the PRC uses 8 percent. \nAs shown in Table 4, these differences in the social discount rate policies in practice are due to \ndifferent analytical approaches followed. The various approaches reflect differing views on how public \ninvestment affects domestic consumption, private investment, and cost of international borrowing. \nAt a deeper level, however, the divergence reflects the differences in the perceived marginal social \nopportunity cost of public funds, and in the extent to which the issue of intergenerational equity \n\u00180  May 2007", "SecTion iv\nconcluding reMarkS\nis taken into consideration in setting the social discount rate. Public funds, in general, have a \nhigher marginal social opportunity cost in developing countries than in developed countries for a \nnumber of reasons, such as more scarcity of capital, poorer \ufffd\ufffdnancial intermediation, greater market \ndistortions, and greater impediments in accessing international capital markets. Intergenerational \nequity is a newer issue in the public domain of developing countries than that of developed \ncountries. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that developing countries generally use a higher \nsocial discount rate than developed countries.\nIV.  CoNCluDINg REMARks\nThe choice of the social discount rate plays a critical role in cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis and project \nevaluation, and has been a subject of intense debate for the last several decades. In a perfectly \ncompetitive world without market distortions, the market interest rate is the appropriate social \ndiscount rate. In the real world where markets are distorted, there are four alternative approaches \nin the choice of the social discount rate\ufffd\ufffd SRTP, SOC, weighted average of SRTP and SOC, and SPC. \nEconomists have not reached a consensus as to which is the most appropriate.\nThe difference among the four approaches reflects largely the different views on how public \nprojects affect the domestic economy\ufffd\ufffd whether public investment displaces current consumption, or \nprivate investment, or both, and whether bene\ufffd\ufffdts of projects are consumed immediately, or reinvested \nto generate more future consumption (see Table 5 for a summary). In cases of very long-term \nprojects, an additional consideration is intergenerational equity, where the debate has centered on \nwhether or not one should assume a positive pure time preference on the grounds that individuals \nare \u201cimpatient\u201d, and whether a declining discount rate should be used to avoid problems associated \nwith exponential discounting as implied by a constant discount rate. The recent controversy over \nthe Stern Review focuses largely on what discount rate should be used in cost\u2013bene\ufffd\ufffdt analysis of \npolicies to control global warming, which impacts on future generations.\nThere are signi\ufffd\ufffdcant variations in public discount rate policies in practice around the world, with \ndeveloped countries applying lower rates (3\u20137%) than the developing countries surveyed (8\u201315%). \nThese variations largely reflect different theoretical approaches to the choice of the discount rate \nfollowed by various countries. At a deeper level, however, the divergence also reflects differences \nin the perceived marginal social opportunity cost of public funds that the social discount rate tries \nto measure in order to ensure ef\ufffd\ufffdcient allocation of resources, and differences in the extent to \nwhich the issue of intergenerational equity is considered.\nWhat conclusion can we draw from this survey? \ufffdirst, there is no one-size-\ufffd\ufffdts-all solution to \nthe choice of the social discount rate. Countries differ in economic structure, capital scarcity, stage \nof \ufffd\ufffdnancial development, ef\ufffd\ufffdciency of \ufffd\ufffdnancial intermediation, impediments faced in accessing the \ninternational capital market, and social time preference. All these factors together determine a country\u2019s \nsocial opportunity cost of capital, and should be taken into consideration in the choice of the social \ndiscount rate. Second, there is need for each country to regularly review the appropriateness of its \nsocial discount rate policy in light of changing domestic economic circumstances and international \ncapital market conditions, and to adjust the social discount rate as necessary. Third, there is a \nstrong case for considering the equity issue in discounting bene\ufffd\ufffdts and costs of intergenerational \nprojects (e.g., those designed to address climate changes and other environmental problems) in \naddition to the economic ef\ufffd\ufffdciency issue, as opposed to intragenerational projects where ef\ufffd\ufffdciency \nshould be the primary concern. \ufffdinally, for MDBs that provide development assistance to developing \n  erd Working PaPer SerieS no. 94  \u00181", "Theory and PracTice in The choice of Social diScounT raTe for coST\u2013BenefiT analySiS: a Survey\nJuzhong zhuang, zhihong liang, Tun lin, and franklin de guzMan\ncountries through capital investment, there could be a case for reviewing their decades-old practice \nof applying a uniform discount rate of 10\u201312% to all projects to see whether this practice is still \nappropriate in a changing world.\nTable 5\nalTernaTive aPProacheS To The choice of The Social diScounT raTe\naPProach imPlied aSSumPTion Who uSeS iT meThod of emPirical  maJor criTiciSm\neSTimaTion\nSocial Rate  Time-invariant Mostly  Apply \u201cRamsey formula\u201d  Ignores the fact that \nof Time  developed  with the following  public investment \nPreference Public projects only  countries parameters\ufffd\ufffd   could displace private \n(SRTP) displace current  (i) utility discount rate,  investment\nconsumption (ii) elasticity of marginal \nutility of consumption,  Choice of utility discount \nand (iii) growth rate  rate involves normative \nof real per capita  value judgment, and \nconsumption  estimation of the \nelasticity of marginal \nApproximated by after- utility of consumption \ntax rate of return on  is sensitive to data and \ngovernment bonds methodology\nTime-declining Mostly  Typically estimated  Leads to time-\nacademic  through experiments inconsistent planning\nPublic projects only  and policy \ndisplace current  researchers\nconsumption, and \ndiscount rate declines \nover time as uncertainty \nincreases.
