Introduction \nArchipelagic Southeast Asia (aSEA) covers five member countries of the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)\u2014Brunei  Darussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines, and Singapore\u2014together with Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste.1 The aSEA \nregion includes the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East Asian Growth \nArea  (BIMP-EAGA)  and  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth  Triangle  (IMT-GT) \nsubregional cooperation programs. \nThe key to understanding the region lies in an appreciation of its archipelagic nature. aSEA \nincludes more than 24,000 islands, spread across 5,200 kilometers (km) from east to west \nand 3,400 km from north to south. It has a population of over 350 million, 225 million of \nwhom live in Indonesia with a further 87 million living in the Philippines (Green 2008).\nTo the inhabitants of the archipelago, the sea is at once a link and a barrier, as well as a \nresource and a challenge. On the positive side of the ledger, the sea provides food and \nemployment, while the danger of an unsustainable marine environment and the fact that \nproximity to the sea heightens vulnerability to national disaster are potential negatives. \nThis  paper  provides  an  overview  of  airline  connectivity  in  the  aSEA  region.  Section  2 \ndiscusses  the  economic  diversity  and  development  gap  that  exists  among  the  aSEA \ncountries. Section 3 examines the importance of improving airline connectivity in bridging \nthis economic divide at the local, regional, and international levels. Section 4 examines the \ndemand for airline passenger and freight services in the aSEA region. In Section 5 we \ninvestigate the supply of airline services on regional and long-distance (intercontinental) \nroutes. Special attention is paid to the emergence of low-cost airlines and the supply of \nairline services on \"thin\" regional routes, such as those linking regions of BIMP-EAGA. \nSection 6 assesses the region's aviation infrastructure, contrasting the efficiency of major \nhub  airports  with  the  problems  experienced  by  regional  airports.  Section  7  examines \nregional policies relating to air transport, arguing that an industry historically subject to close \nregulation  has  benefited  from  market  liberalization,  privatization,  and  a  relaxation  of \nrestrictive  ownership  rules.  Section  8  contains  policy  recommendations  designed  to \nstrengthen  aviation  connectivity.  This  section  also  highlights  the  costs  and  potential \nproblems that may arise with the implementation of policies to improve aviation connectivity. \n2. The aSEA Economies\nThe aSEA economies are extremely diverse (Table 1, page 30). Their population varies from \n225 million in Indonesia to 40,000 in Brunei. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nvaries  from  $440  in  Timor-Leste  to  over  $35,000  in  Singapore.  aSEA  countries  differ \n                                                           \n \n1  Where relevant, this report will make reference to Thailand as well. ", "2 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nsignificantly in their reliance on foreign trade. Measured by the ratio of exports to GDP, the \ndegree of trade openness varies widely from 2.2% in Timor-Leste to 230.9% in Singapore. \nWhile the ASEAN member nations of aSEA are at first glance diverse, they share a number \nof  common  features.  Singapore  is  a  mature  economy  with  a  level  of  GDP  per  capita \ncomparable with many advanced western industrial nations. Having experienced strong \neconomic growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, Malaysia has enjoyed renewed growth \nfollowing the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Brunei is a wealthy country heavily \ndependent on earnings from oil. Indonesia developed rapidly in the 1980s based on labor-\nintensive  manufacturing  (mainly  centered  on  Java)  but  has  failed  to  maintain  early \nmomentum. The Philippines has yet to take off economically with sustained growth. These \ncountries have a number of features in common: (i) relatively open economic policies, (ii) \nlow and reducing levels of tariff protection, (iii) and a strong reliance on export-led economic \ngrowth. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines also have in common large areas that are \nnot  well  connected  and  much  poorer  than  the  main  centers  (eastern  Indonesia,  East \nMalaysia, southern Philippines). \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste are at a much earlier stage of economic growth \nthan their ASEAN counterparts. Not only is their GDP per capita much lower but Timor-\nLeste\u2019s very low trade intensity also reflects the country\u2019s wider political and economic \nproblems.  PNG  and  Timor-Leste\u2019s  transport  needs  and  existing  service  patterns  differ \nsignificantly from those of the ASEAN members of aSEA. Timor-Leste has extremely limited \nairline and shipping links. PNG's connectivity is also poor and tends to be oriented toward \nAustralia rather than Southeast Asia.  \nThe development gap between the ASEAN members of aSEA and Papua New Guinea can \nbe considered analogous with that between the more advanced ASEAN countries (the \nASEAN  6)  and  the  newer  and  less-developed  members,  i.e.,  Cambodia,  Lao  People's \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. \n3. The Importance of Air Connectivity \nImproved air connectivity through air transport links is an essential component of economic \ngrowth, as it provides personal access to the region for business, social, or recreational \npurposes, as well as physical access to resources and markets. Improved access allows \nproducers  to  take  advantage  of  an  expansion  of  trade,  economies  of  scale,  and \nspecialization,  thus  lowering  costs  and  prices  and  widening  production  choices.  The \ngeography of the region favors air transport, Distances between capital cities are substantial \nand cross-border land links limited. Moreover, in archipelagic countries such as Indonesia \nand the Philippines, travelers have to choose between relatively slow and uncomfortable \ncombinations of sea and land transport and relatively swift air passage.   ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  3 \n \nAir transport carries both passengers and freight. Regular scheduled airline services are \nespecially important for business communication, facilitating both trade and investment. \nThey also play a critical role in stimulating leisure travel, a vital sector, given the importance \nof tourism for the aSEA economies. While most passengers fly on regular scheduled airline \nservices,  charter  flights  are  important  in  specialist  markets  such  as  pilgrimage  traffic \nbetween Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Air freight is carried in the cargo holds of \npassenger aircraft and specialist cargo aircraft.  \nAt a local level, Tier 4 air services connect local communities with regional centers. In aSEA, \nsuch connections often link island communities with their closest regional center. Where \nsuch routes are internal, they are subject to cabotage restrictions, reserving air services for \nairlines owned by citizens of the country. They are usually serviced by small 6\u201318 seat prop \nor  turbo-prop  aircraft.  While  some  routes  may  be  commercially  viable,  many  require \nsubsidization.\nImproved air connectivity at a regional level enables business to provide better service to \ncustomers and offer opportunities for tourism and improved social networking. Enhanced air \nconnectivity widens the potential market available to local producers, providing opportunities \nto specialize in agricultural or industrial production according to comparative or competitive \nadvantage. The economies of scale generated may enable firms to lower the unit price of \ntheir products and further widen their market. \nRegional air services include (I) airline services between regional centers within country A; \n(ii) airline services between regional centers in country A and that country\u2019s metropolitan \nmarket; (iii) airline services connecting regional centers in country A with regional centers in \ncountries B, C, and D; and (iv) airline services between regional centers in country A and \nkey regional aviation hubs. From an aviation industry perspective, such services may be \ndivided into \u201dhigh\u201d and \u201dlow\u201d frequency routes (Table 2, page 31).  \n\u201dHigh\u201d frequency routes (Tier 2 services) are capable of supporting a jet service (A319, \nA320, B737, or similar aircraft) on a regular basis.2 They may be served by more than one \nairline. Where such routes link regional centers within a single country, they are subject to \ncabotage restrictions. Where they link regional centers in two or more countries, they are \nregulated by air service agreements (ASAs) between the countries concerned.  \n\u201dLow\u201d frequency routes (Tier 3 services) are characterized by limited traffic flows. They may \nonly be able to sustain services by a single carrier. In practice they are often operated by \nsurplus jet capacity (A319, A320, B737, or similar) although they may be more suited to \nturbo-prop aircraft, which may offer a higher frequency service compatible with market \nrequirements. As noted above, where such routes link regional centers in a given country, \nthey  are  subject  to  cabotage  restrictions.  Routes  between  two  or  more  countries  are \nregulated by ASAs between the countries in question. Some routes may not be viable in the \nlong run.\n                                                           \n \n2   \"A\" denotes an aircraft type manufactured by Airbus Industrie, while \"B\u201d denotes an aircraft type produced by \nthe US-owned Boeing Aircraft Corporation. ", "4 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nIn  a  globalized  world,  efficient  air  connections  between  the  aSEA  region  and  major \ninternational markets are essential. The scale of passenger arrivals and departures at the \nregion\u2019s major airports attests to the importance of air travel in the 21st century. The volume \nof air cargo consigned to and from the region has also grown rapidly. Since the 1980s,\nleading  aSEA  countries  have  enjoyed  rapid,  export-oriented  economic  growth,  driven  by \nmainly Japanese companies choosing to move production offshore and the quest for low-cost \nproduction  by  European  and  US  companies  as  well  as  by  declining  US  industrial \ncompetitiveness. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \n(UNCTAD),  manufactures  account  for  over  70%  of  world  merchandise  trade  by  value.3\nAlthough a high proportion of manufactured exports, when measured by volume, are carried \nby sea, high value and/or perishable products are shipped by air.\n4. Demand for Airline Services \n4.1 Passenger Services \nThe demand for international airline services to and from any given country will depend on \n(cid:2)  the country\u2019s population level; \n(cid:2)  its income per capita (high levels of discretionary income being associated with high \nlevels of demand for international travel); \n(cid:2)  the geographical location of the country, and especially its suitability as an international \nhub for aviation services; and \n(cid:2)  the relative attractiveness of the country as an international tourist destination. \nThe scale of the aviation sector within aSEA countries and its potential for future growth \ndepend not only on the population of the country concerned, but also on its per capita \nincome level, geography, attractiveness to foreign tourists, and its suitability as an airline \nhub. The population of the aSEA region is over 350 million, with that of individual states \nvarying from 40,000 in Brunei Darussalam to 87 million in the Philippines and 225 million in \nIndonesia. Per capita income varies from approximately $440 in Timor-Leste to $1,925 in \nIndonesia, $32,000 in Brunei Darussalam, and $35,000 in Singapore. Citizens of Brunei \nDarussalam and Singapore enjoy relatively high levels of discretionary income, with the \nresult that expenditure on airline services per capita is much higher than that of Timor-Leste \nor Indonesian citizens.\n                                                           \n \n3   See United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Review of Maritime Transport 2008,\nNew York and Geneva, United Nations, 2008, p. 8.

Singapore\u2019s  role  as  a  major \nbusiness and financial center with global links creates a substantial demand for premium \naviation travel. Similarly, inbound and outbound tourist numbers are high. Singapore is a \npopular stopover en route from Europe to East Asia and Australasia and is a major tourist \ndestination  in  its  own  right.  In  2007,  the  total  number  of  visitors  exceeded  10  million. \nSingaporean\u2019s high discretionary incomes also generate significant numbers of outbound \ntourists. The small size of Singapore Island, high population density and high per capita \nincome encourage Singaporeans to travel abroad. In 2007, there were 6.0 million outbound \ndepartures by Singapore residents, 4.2 million of which were by air (See Table 3, page 33). \nMalaysia too is an important tourist and business destination and relatively large numbers of \nMalaysian students study abroad.4 Demand for long-distance international airline passenger \nservices  to  and  from  Malaysia  is  therefore  high,  as  is  shown  by  airport  arrivals  and \ndepartures. Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) handled 24.1 million passengers in \n2006 (17.5 million in 2003).\nWhile the employment of Filipino domestics in Asia and the Middle East, as well as the \nmovement of Filipino crews to and from their vessels, enhances the Philippines demand for \noverseas travel, average per capita incomes are too low to generate mass outward tourism. \nHowever, 1.9 million inbound tourists in 2002 generated $US2.5 billion in foreign exchange, \ncontributing $US5.7 billion to GDP and employing (directly and indirectly) around 3 million \nFilipinos. Most tourists arrived from the US, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nTraffic to and from PNG and Timor-Leste is by above standards miniscule. The demand for \nairline services to and from PNG is limited by the relative unattractiveness of PNG to \ninternational tourists as well as by the low disposal income of PNG citizens. Incoming tourist \nnumbers are small, only 5% of arrivals being for leisure purposes. No significant growth of \ninbound tourism is likely in the near future as a result of the security situation and the lack of \nhotel infrastructure. The bulk of the air travel market is business and expatriate travel. Airline \nschedules to and from PNG suggest that the primary origin and destination is Australia. Air \nNiugini, the national carrier, is the sole provider of direct services to aSEA countries. The \nairline operates two B767 services a week from Port Moresby to Singapore, totaling 534 \nseats in each direction. A 234-seat B757 operates weekly direct services from Port Moresby \nto Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Hong Kong. \nGiven the very low income level of its citizens, demand for air services to and from Timor-\nLeste  would  appear  to  stem  mainly  from  government  officials  and  representatives  of \n                                                           \n \n4   We note also that a sizable number of students from the aSEA region study in Malaysia and Singapore.

Demand for and supply of air freight appears \nto be very limited. \n4.2.1 Demand for Regional Airline Services \nThere  is  a  substantial  demand  for  airline  services  between  aSEA  countries,  especially \nbetween the ASEAN members of aSEA. Given the development of the manufacturing sector \nin ASEAN countries and the tendency to integrate production regionally, one would expect to \nfind a substantial proportion of the airline traffic is generated by business travelers.  \nTable 4 (page 34), based on ASEAN data for tourist arrivals, shows the substantial scale of \nintra-ASEAN tourism. The data suggest that Malaysia is the most important regional holiday \ndestination for ASEAN citizens, followed by Singapore and Thailand. Interestingly, a high \nproportion of Philippines tourist arrivals come from outside the region. \nSingapore is a major hub for regional and intercontinental airline services. In 2007, 3.7 \nmillion out of a total of 10 million visitors to Singapore came from ASEAN countries, mainly \nfrom Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand (Table 5, page 35).5\nThe  densest  regional  traffic  flows  are  between the major metropolitan centers, notably \nSingapore\u2013Bangkok,  Singapore\u2013Jakarta,  Bangkok\u2013Kuala  Lumpur,  and  Kuala  Lumpur\u2013\nJakarta. The relative importance of intra-ASEAN traffic, as a proportion of total airline traffic, \nvaries between aSEA countries. For example, intra-ASEAN traffic accounts for 51% of total \ninternational airline traffic at Brunei International Airport (BIA), 60% at Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-\nHatta Airport and 40% at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  \nRegional airports also handle substantial passenger numbers. For example, within Malaysia \nKota Kinabalu International Airport handled 4 million passengers in 2006 (3.3 million in \n2003); Kuching International Airport, 3.2 million passengers in 2006 (2.9 million in 2003); \nwhile Penang handled 3.1 million in 2006 (2.3 million in 2003).6\n4.2.2 Demand for Airline Services in Less-Developed Regions \nDemand for passenger and freight services between the less-developed regions of aSEA, \nincluding  the  provinces  forming  the  BIMP-EAGA  and  the  IMT-GT  as  well  as  services \nbetween PNG and Timor-Leste and the ASEAN members of aSEA, is usually insufficient to \nsupport frequent, scheduled airline services. In the absence of subsidization, passengers \nand freight from region A may have to fly to the nearest regional hub port to connect with \nflights for region B. This may involve substantially more flying and waiting time at the hub \nairport.\n                                                           \n \n5 Yearbook of Statistics Singapore 2008.

", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  7 \n \n4.3 Demand for Air Freight Services \nThe demand for international air freight services in any given country will depend on the \ngeographical source of the country\u2019s imports and the destination of its exports. Other things \nbeing equal, air freight will be used where the supplier and the market are relatively distant \nand unable to be serviced by road transport. Demand will also depend on the commodity \ncomposition of imports and exports. Air freight is competitive for products with a high value \nto weight ratio (e.g., electronics and information technology). As a general guide, products \nwhose value exceeds $20 per kilogram are considered air eligible. Products that have to be \non the retailer\u2019s shelf within a few hours of growing or processing (cut flowers, crustaceans) \nand  products  that  have  a  short  product  life  cycle  (high  fashion  garments)  are  usually \nshipped by air. \nA range of products with a relatively high value to weight ratio are shipped on regional air \nservices, sizable volumes of air cargo being moved on scheduled airline services operating \nbetween Singapore\u2013Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur\u2013Bangkok. The sector between Singapore\u2013\nKuala Lumpur is too short to attract a high volume of air freight. A high proportion of the \nfreight between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is likely to be carried by road. \nAs a manufacturing center and entrep\u00f4t port, Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport handles over 2 \nmillion tons of air freight annually. Imports arriving by air include perishable foodstuffs and \nhigh-value textiles and fashions. Most exports shipped by air are manufactures. Singapore \naccounts for about 40% of ASEAN exports of electronic products. While a high proportion of \nthese exports are shipped in containers by sea, higher-value products are typically air \nfreighted. Similarly, Singapore accounts for 45% of ASEAN exports of information and \ncommunication technology products. The high value of many of these products (typically \nvarying between $10\u2013150 per kg) suggests that many are air freighted.7\nWhile KLIA handled 677,000 tons of air freight in 2006, Malaysian regional airports handled \nsignificantly lower volumes. For example, Penang handled 226,000 tons of air freight in \n2006, Kota Kinabalu 36,000 tons, and Kuching 30,000 tons. The relatively low volume of air \ncargo handled by West Malaysian regional airports reflects competition from rail and road \ntransport across the land borders between Malaysia\u2013Singapore and Malaysia\u2013Thailand. \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the bulk of the substantial two-way trade in electronics \nand  information  and  communication  technology  equipment  between  Singapore  and \nMalaysia is carried by road.8\n                                                           \n \n7   We note that over 70% of Singapore information and communication technology (ICT) products are exported \nto Malaysia. Regrettably no statistics relate to the transport mode used in this trade. We suspect that a high \nproportion of ICT exports from Singapore to Malaysia (and vice versa) is handled by road transport. \n8   No statistical data is available on the modes of transport used.

The growth \nof  air  cargo  through  BIA  averaged  27%  per  year  for  1997\u20132002.  BIA  acts  as  a \ntransshipment  point  for  high-value  air  cargo  (like  cellular  phones)  and  perishable \ncommodities (like prawns from Kota Kinabalu to Hong Kong, China). \nIn PNG the demand for air freight is limited. Commodities exported by PNG, including oil \nand other mineral products, are carried by ship. Australia is the primary destination for PNG \nexports (30.1% of the total by value). Other destinations include Japan (8.1%) and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (5.7%). The aSEA region is not a major customer for PNG \nexports. PNG\u2019s merchandise imports include industrial and agri-business products, food and \nbeverages, and household wares. Australia is PNG's major supplier of imports (52.3%). \nOther sources include Singapore (12.6%) and Japan (5.9%). High-value commodities from \nAustralia and Singapore are likely to be air freighted. Occasional air freight charters carrying \ntuna and other maritime products operate to Japan. More typically such produce is hubbed \nover Brisbane. \nSince a high proportion of aSEA\u2019s air freight is lifted in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft, \na close relationship exists between trends in the airline passenger services and trends in the \nprovision of air freight capacity. \n5. Supply of Airline Services \n5.1 Long-Distance (Intercontinental) Services \nLong  distance  (Tier  One)  services,  operated  by  major  international  airlines  such  as \nSingapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines, Thai Airways, and Emirates link regional hub airports \n(Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok) with major destinations in Europe, North America, \nEast Asia, and Oceania. However, the bilateral bargaining underpinning ASAs between \ncountry A  and  country  B  ensures  that  airlines  from  every  sovereign  country  have  an \nopportunity to offer international flights to and from their home country. As a result, airlines \nsuch  as  Royal  Brunei,  Philippines  Air  Lines,  and  Garuda  Indonesia  also  operate \ninternational services to and from their country of origin. Typically, such airlines offer a more \nlimited range of intercontinental services than the major international airlines.   ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  9 \n \n5.2 Regional Services \nTable 6 (page 36) provides an overview of airline connectivity between aSEA countries. The \ntable lists the number of city pairs connected by scheduled airline services. The countries \nwith the largest number of connections between city pairs are Malaysia and Indonesia. \nSingapore appears to have excellent connections with the region as a whole, while Thailand \nalso has strong regional connections. At the other end of the scale, PNG has limited airline \nconnectivity with Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, while Timor-Leste is connected \nonly to Indonesia and Singapore. \nIt was found that more than one airline may offer services between a particular city pair. \nThus Table 6 should be read in conjunction with Table 7 (page 37). The latter suggests that \nthe major city pairs are served by between two to five airlines. Typically two of the airlines \nare national carriers, competing against one or more low-cost airlines.\n5.3 Airline Services to and from Less-Developed Regions \nMany Asian countries, including the major aSEA economies, have successfully adopted \nexport-oriented growth strategies enabling them to take advantage of the liberalized world \ntrading system. However, the benefits of such economic growth have not always been \nshared equally between the regions of countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and \nThailand. Transport links between less-developed regions are often weak or nonexistent. \nThe fact that demand for regional air and shipping services in the past has been relatively \nthin appears to have discouraged entrepreneurs from opening new routes or purchasing \nnew equipment.\nFor  example,  air  connectivity  between  the  regions  comprising  BIMP-EAGA  has  been \nnotoriously  poor.  Before  2006,  a  passenger  wishing  to  fly  from  Bandar  Seri  Bagawan \n(Brunei)  to  Pontianak  (Indonesia)  had  to  fly  via  Kota  Kinabalu  and Kuching, involving, \nsometimes lengthy stopovers at transfer points. Demand for flights between subregional \ncenters was thin and the problem was exacerbated by the employment of inappropriate \naircraft types by some airlines. \nIn 2006, member governments signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) designed to \nexpand and strengthen air services within BIMP-EAGA. Under the MOU, each member \ncountry agreed to allow several carriers to operate on given routes. The agreement also \nprovided  for  the  full  exchange  of  third  and  fourth  freedom  traffic  rights,  without  any \nrestrictions on capacity, frequency, and aircraft type. Further liberalization took place in 1999 \nand 2000. Brunei and Indonesia granted full fifth freedom rights in 1999 (Malaysia already \nfollowed such a policy), while the Philippines granted full fifth freedom traffic rights within \nBIMP-EAGA to airlines designated by the participating countries. Fifth freedom traffic rights \nallow an air carrier domiciled in a member country to pick up traffic in another BIMP-EAGA \nmember country and carry it to a third member country as part of a service to and from the \nhome country of the airline. For example, a Malaysian Airlines flight could fly from Kota \nKinabalu to Bandar Seri Bagawan, pick up Brunei originating traffic, and carry it to Pontianak ", "10 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nin Indonesia. Fifth freedom rights enable airlines greater freedom and flexibility in planning \nnetworks in regions in which individual routes have thin traffic flows, potentially enhancing \ncompetition between airlines. In the example above, Malaysian Airlines could find itself \ncompeting against Royal Brunei Airlines and Indonesian carriers.\nOriginally, each BIMP-EAGA transport minister designated two entry points to be granted \nfifth  freedom  rights.9  The  airports  designated  were  Banda  Seri  Bagawan  in  Brunei, \nBalikpapan and Pontianak in Indonesia, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching in Malaysia, and Davao \nand Zamboanga City in the Philippines. Fifth freedom rights were granted to other airports in \n2007: Manado and Tarakan in Indonesia, Labuan and Miri in Malaysia, and Puerto Princesa \nand General Santos City in the Philippines. \nThe adoption of fifth freedom rights offers a partial solution to the region\u2019s aviation problems. \nIt is encouraging to note that new entrants have begun services and airlines have introduced \nturboprop  rather  than  jet  aircraft.  For  example,  Asian  Spirit\u2014a  Philippine  domestic \ncarrier10\u2014began  flying  the  Zamboanga\u2013Sandakan  and  Zamboanga\u2013Jolo  routes  in  May \n2007. Similarly, Malaysian Airlines wholly owned subsidiary Firefly commenced services to \nand from destinations in East Malaysia and Indonesia in 2007, initially with a fleet of Fokker \n50 turboprops.\nAir  services  within  the  IMT-GT  subregion  are  also  considered  to  offer  inadequate \nconnectivity. For example, the lack of a direct service between Hat Yai in southern Thailand \nand Medan and Banda Aceh in Sumatra (Songhkla\u2013Penang\u2013Medan Corridor) inhibit the \ngrowth of trade and tourism.\nNew entrants offer the promise of improved airline services. For example, in 2007 the \nMalaysian  Airways  owned  subsidiary  Firefly,  operating  from  a  base  in  Penang,  began \noperating 72-seat Fokker propjet aircraft on routes such as Penang\u2013Phuket and Penang\u2013\nKoh Samui. \nSee Table 9 on international aviation freedom of the air rights.\n5.4 Cabotage \nIn general, the domestic aviation markets of aSEA countries are reserved for airlines owned \nby citizens of the country in question. However, it is noted that several countries in the aSEA \nregion have deregulated domestic aviation. For example, Indonesia deregulated domestic \naviation in 1998. Since deregulation the sector has attracted a number of new entrants. \nSimilarly, Thailand allows open access on all domestic routes and private carriers are free to \ncompete  with  Thai  Airways.  The  Philippines  has  also  liberalized  its  domestic  aviation \n                                                           \n \n9   We note that Brunei has only one airport. \n10   Asian Spirit has changed hands and been renamed Zest Airways. ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  11 \n \nmarket. Entry and exit is subject to policy laid out in Executive Order 219 (1995). This \nexecutive order envisages the progressive liberalization of the aviation industry in general. \n5.5 Airline Ownership \nUntil recently, national carriers played a pivotal role in the aSEA region. The largest of these \ncarriers\u2014Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Malaysian Airlines\u2014operate a web of intra-\nASEAN services and extensive networks linking Southeast Asia with Europe, the Middle \nEast, Australasia, and North America. The dominance of these carriers appears to be under \nthreat as aviation markets are deregulated and competition intensifies.  \nSingapore Airlines is the largest regional airline and the world\u2019s second-largest carrier by \nmarket  value.11  While  Singapore Airlines  is  quoted  on  the  Singapore  Stock  Exchange, \nmajority  ownership  is  held  by  the  Singapore  Government  (56.83%)  operating  through \nTemasek Holdings. There are no current proposals for further privatization. Thai Airways is \nalso  majority  (92%)  owned  by  government,  although  further  privatization  is  envisaged. \nGaruda Indonesian Airways was reorganized in 1998 and there are plans to privatize the \nairline. The Philippines\u2019 national carrier Philippines Airways Ltd (PAL) was privatized in 1992. \nHowever, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, PAL was declared bankrupt and forced \ninto reconstruction. Royal Brunei Airlines is an independent corporation wholly owned by the \nGovernment of Brunei Darussalam.\nPrivate sector carriers compete with government-owned airlines in a number of ASEAN \ncountries. For example, Cebu Pacific, Zest Airways, and Southeast Asian Airlines compete \nwith PAL in the Philippines domestic market. Similarly, Andaman Airways, Bangkok Air, \nOrient Air, PB Air, and Phuket Air compete with Thai Airways.  \nThe  international  airline  industry  is  currently  experiencing  a  period  of  merger  and \nacquisition. Consolidation has taken a variety of forms. For example, Air France and KLM \nRoyal Dutch Airlines merged in 2006 through the formation of a new holding company. \nLufthansa, having successfully acquired Swiss International Airlines 3 years ago, is buying a \ncontrolling stake in Britain\u2019s BMI (formerly British Midland) and is also bidding for a minority \nstake in Austrian Airlines. In turn, Singapore Airlines formed a global alliance with Virgin \nAtlantic in 1999, with SIA taking a 49% shareholding in Virgin Atlantic. The partnership \nenables the carriers to code share, as well as share airport lounges and frequent flyer \nprograms and offer joint round-the-world fares. Such industry consolidation appears to be \ndriven by liberalization of aviation markets, a relaxation of regulations relating to cross-\nborder investments in airlines, as well as the desire of governments to reduce their exposure \nto the aviation sector. Aviation industry experts argue that the industry is likely to experience \nfurther consolidation over the next few years.\naSEA carriers appear likely to be affected by industry consolidation. The strongest of the \naSEA national carriers\u2014Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, and Thai Airways\u2014may join \nthe race to consolidate. Weaker carriers may find survival difficult in this new environment. \n                                                           \n \n11   \"Singapore Airlines rocked by recession,\" Australian, 15 May 2009. ", "12 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\n5.6 Code Sharing \nUnder a code-sharing arrangement, an airline provides seats to a code-share partner(s), \nwhich are then marketed under the partner\u2019s name. Code sharing allows airlines to offer \nmore frequent services than would be possible if their own aircraft operated all flights. It also \nenables airlines to serve a market without having to operate their own aircraft. The most \ncommon types of code sharing are \u201cblock space\u201d and \u201cfree flow.\u201d Under a block-space \nagreement, the marketing carrier takes an agreed number of seats on designated flights for \nan agreed price and resells them, as if they were its own seats. The risk is transferred from \nthe operating carrier to the marketing carrier. Under a free-flow arrangement there is no \nspecific allocation of seats. The marketing carrier sells, however, many seats that it can. The \nrisk remains with the operating carrier but it is alleviated by the marketing efforts of the \nnonoperating carrier. \n5.7 Low-Cost Airlines \nSubstantial changes are occurring in regional aviation markets as a result of the entry of \nlow-cost carriers. The first mover in the aSEA region was the Malaysian-based Air Asia, \nestablished  in  2001  to  serve  the  Malaysian  domestic  market.  In  2003, Air Asia  began \nservices to Bangkok and services to other regional destinations followed. By 2007 the airline \nwas carrying 7.7 million passengers. Its long-haul counterpart\u2014Air Asia X\u2014began services \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China and Australia in 2007 and London in March 2009.   \nThe  number  of  low-cost  airlines  has  grown  rapidly  over  the  past  5  years.  Based  in \nSingapore, Tiger Airways,  Jetstar Asia,  and  Valuair  compete  in  regional  markets. Tiger \nAirways, in which Singapore Airlines has a 49% stake, was launched in 2004. Similarly, \nQantas set up Jetstar Asia by creating a joint venture structure with Singaporean investors. \nJetstar Asia later acquired the Singaporean low-cost operator Valuair. \nThailand\u2019s low-cost operators include Nok Air and One Two Go. The Malaysian low-cost \ncarrier AirAsia also competes in the Thai market through its Thai AirAsia joint venture with \nAsia Aviation Co. Ltd. The Government of Thailand lifted foreign ownership limits from 35% \nto 49% to allow AirAsia to enter the market. Indonesian low-cost carriers include Mandala \nAirlines, Batavia Air, and Lion Air. These airlines compete with Indonesian AirAsia, a joint \nventure between Malaysia\u2019s AirAsia and local Indonesian investors. In the Philippines, Zest \nAirways  competes  with  SEA Air,  a  Philippine  domestic  carrier  that  has  entered  into  a \ncommercial  and  operational  joint  venture  with Tiger Airways. The  agreement  will  allow \nTiger\u2019s aircraft to operate in Philippine domestic and international markets. \nThe low-cost carrier business model is based on \n(cid:2)  Relatively narrow regional coverage (e.g., Southeast Asia), eliminating the need to pay \nhigh overseas allowances to crew; \n(cid:2)  A standardized fleet, usually of one type of aircraft, reducing crew training, maintenance \nand repair costs; ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  13 \n \n(cid:2)  Fast turnaround and intensive use of aircraft, often using less-congested secondary \nairports; \n(cid:2)  Higher seat density; \n(cid:2)  Minimal cabin service; \n(cid:2)  Extensive use of outsourcing; and \n(cid:2)  Booking through the internet, saving travel agents\u2019 commission.12\nAs a consequence of the growth of low-cost carriers, some routes in the intra-aSEA airline \nmarket are changing rapidly. Table 7 suggests that low-cost carriers have already had a \nsignificant impact in reducing fares across the aSEA region. Table 8 (page 38), based on \nresearch by Solis and Rodolfo, suggests that greater competition led to a substantial fall in \nairline revenue per seat-kilometer over 2003\u20132008. \nEntry or threat of entry by low-cost (and low-priced) airlines is disturbing the competitive \nequilibrium across the region, threatening incumbent airlines and forcing them to adopt new \nstrategies. The  growth  of  low-cost  carriers  will  introduce  competition  to  existing  routes \nwhose growth has been inhibited by full-service airlines seeking to maintain high yields. \nGreater competition will also encourage both low-cost carriers and incumbent airlines to \ndevelop new routes, notably those linking secondary hubs. In the medium to long run, these \ntrends will substantially improve air connectivity in the aSEA region. \n5.8 Growth in Size and Range of Commercial Aircraft \nThe introduction of new types of aircraft (B777, B787, A340, A380), including aircraft such as \nthe A380 with greatly increased carrying capacity, are likely to reinforce the dominance of \nregional hubs such as Singapore and Bangkok. Other things being equal, direct international \nflights from regional airports (Penang, Kota Kinabalu, Brunei) are likely to be replaced by \nintensive services to and from the nearest hub airport.\nHowever, the ability of new and more fuel-efficient planes to carry commercial payloads \nfurther creates a potential counter-tendency. Aircraft such as the B777 and A380 are able to \nfly long distances without refueling, enabling them to overfly existing hubs. For example, \nnew generation aircraft can fly directly from Australia to the Middle East, cutting out the \ntraditional stopovers in Singapore, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. It is unclear at this time \nwhether Southeast Asian aviation hubs will experience declining demand as a result of the \nintroduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft types.  \n                                                           \n \n12   L.

", "14 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\n5.9 Charter Services \nIn general, aSEA countries have adopted relatively liberal policies toward charter flights. For \nexample, Brunei Darussalam views charter flights as a valuable supplement to passenger or \nfreight services during times of peak seasonal or temporary demand. Approved charter \nservices include pilgrimage flights to Jeddah. The Philippines views charter flights as a \nvaluable supplement to scheduled services at times of peak tourist demand, especially in \nthe case of the more remote tourist destinations.\nIndonesia liberalized its stance relating to charter flights in 1996, opening up all its gateway \nairports to charter flights. Similarly, Malaysia has a liberal approach to charter applications, \nreadily approving the application of operators, while Thailand allows any charter to any \ninternational market. By comparison, Singapore sounds a more cautionary note. Although \nSingapore has a moderately liberal approach to air charters, they are relatively uncommon. \nApprovals for charters, which do not compete with scheduled services, can be obtained \nfreely, though the approval process is said to be relatively slow.13\n5.10 Air Freight Services\nAs mentioned earlier, a close relationship exists between trends in the airline passenger \nservices and trends in air freight. Put in another way, the volume of air freight has tended to \nexpand pari passu with the growth of scheduled passenger services. Where the volume of \nair freight exceeds the capacity of scheduled passenger services or where shippers offer \nlarge volumes of perishable or other cargoes capable of paying a sustainable freight rate, \nspecialist air cargo operators may find it worthwhile to introduce dedicated freight aircraft. In \ngeneral, countries in aSEA have adopted liberal air freight policies. Several aSEA countries \nhave entered into bilateral or multilateral open skies agreements relating to air freight. For \nexample,  Malaysia  has  open  skies  air  cargo  agreements  with  Germany  and  the \nNetherlands,  while  under  a  1995  agreement,  airlines  have  unlimited  air  freight  rights \nbetween the Philippines and the US. \nIndonesia  and  Thailand  also  follow  liberal  policies  toward  air  freight,  while  Brunei \nDarussalam allows dedicated air freight operators to serve its market. As might be expected \ngiven its role as a freight hub, Singapore has adopted a liberal policy toward air freight. \n                                                           \n \n13   See Monash International Pty.

Aviation Infrastructure: Capabilities and \nConstraints\nAirlines depend on the services provided by aviation-related infrastructure, such as runways, \nhard stand, passenger and freight terminals, and cargo-handling equipment, as well as other \nforms of infrastructure such as telecommunications and information systems. While high \nquality aviation infrastructure can give an airport a competitive advantage (e.g., Singapore), \nthe lack of appropriate infrastructure or the inefficient operation of existing infrastructure may \nact as a constraint on the development of air transport (e.g., Pontianak, Dili). \n6.1 Major Hub Airports \nThe region\u2019s major hub airports (Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok) operate efficiently \nby world standards, invest heavily to ensure their facilities are adequate, and compete \nstrongly for customers. \nSingapore\u2019s  Changi  Airport  is  the  region\u2019s  major  hub,  served  by  airlines  operating \nintercontinental, intra-Asian, and intra-aSEA services. Following a S$240 million upgrade to \nTerminal  2  in  2006,  the  new  S$2.75  billion  Terminal  3  was  opened  in  January  2008, \nincreasing  Changi\u2019s  capacity  to  64  million  passengers  a  year.  A  budget  terminal,  with \ncapacity for 2.7 million passengers a year, opened in March 2006. The airport\u2019s operational \nefficiency is generally considered to be world class, with the Government of Singapore and \nthe  airport  authority  seeking  to  upgrade  facilities  as  and  when  necessary  to  preserve \nSingapore\u2019s competitive advantage.14 The airport\u2019s charges are among the lowest in Asia. \nOver  the  past  15  years,  Malaysia  has  been  aggressively  developing  the  infrastructure \nnecessary to support its relatively high rate of economic growth. The government has set \nout to develop KLIA as a regional hub for passengers and cargo. The need for KLIA arose \nas  a  result  of  the  14%\u201315%  growth  of  passenger  traffic  through  the  former  Subang \nInternational Airport in the early 1990s. By 1995, Subang had reached its design capacity of \n5,500 passenger movements an hour. The first stage of KLIA was completed in June 1998 \ngiving the airport the capacity to handle 25 million passengers and 1.2 million tons of cargo \na year. A low-cost carrier terminal, constructed in 2005, has the capacity to handle 10 million \npassengers  a  year.  In  2008  the  Government  of  Malaysia  announced  its  intention  to \nconstruct a new low-cost carrier terminal by 2012 with a planned capacity of 25 million \n                                                           \n \n14   Singapore faces competition from Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in its role as a major regional hub. Locally, \nSenai Airport, located across the causeway in the Malaysian state of Johor and accessible by many residents in \nthe northern and western parts of Singapore Island, competes for regional short-haul traffic. ", "16 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\npassengers a year. KLIA has sufficient land to build facilities capable of handling 100 million \npassengers and 5 million tons of cargo annually. \nThailand\u2019s  favorable  geographic  position  and  liberal  aviation  policies  have  enabled  the \ndevelopment  of  one  of  Asia\u2019s  most  important  aviation  hubs  at  Bangkok,  despite  the \ninfrastructural limitations of the former Don Muang Airport. Don Muang suffered from a \nseriously inadequate terminal as well as being slot constrained during the airport\u2019s peak \nhours between 2200 and 0130. Thailand opened Suvamabhumi International Airport in \n2006, at a cost of $3 billion and a capacity of 45 million passengers a year. A planned \nbudget  terminal  will  extend  capacity  by  17  million  a  year.  Reportedly  the  airport  will \neventually cater for 100 million passengers and 3 million tons of air cargo a year. \nIn  summary,  the  region\u2019s  major  hub  airports  (Changi  Airport,  KLIA,  and  Suvamabhumi \nInternational Airport) are efficient by world standards, compete strongly to attract transit \ntraffic, and invest heavily to maintain their competitive position. \n6.2 Other Major Airports \nThe region\u2019s other major airports (including Brunei International Airport (BIA), Soekarno\u2013\nHatta Airport in Jakarta, and Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila) suffer in various \nways when compared to the major hub airports. BIA is a relatively small airport with current \ncapacity to handle 2.2 million passengers. While there are no current restrictions regarding \nlanding or take-off slots, terminal and transfer facilities are said to be inadequate for the \nairport\u2019s projected growth. The government plans to develop BIA as a regional hub, focusing \nespecially  on  the  potential  market  within  BIMP-EAGA.  There  are  plans  to  lift  terminal \ncapacity in four stages, ultimately catering to 4.4 million passengers a year.15\nOver 95% of the Philippines\u2019 international airline traffic is handled by the Ninoy Aquino \nInternational Airport (NAIA) in Manila. Although the airport has had no slot restrictions, until \nrecently, NAIA was constrained by inadequate facilities for transit and transfer passengers. \nSuch infrastructure constraints detracted from the Philippine Government\u2019s drive to become \nan Asian hub. While a new international terminal was built in 2003, its full operation was \ndelayed for some years due to investigations into its contract, which granted monopoly \nrights for ground-handling and catering services to one of the partners in the build-operate-\ntransfer contract. \n                                                           \n \n15   The Government of Brunei Darussalam has encouraged private sector participation in developing the BIA \nthrough the granting of pioneer status. A company granted a pioneer certificate will be exempt from corporate tax \nfor a period ranging from 2 to 5 years. Such companies will also be exempted from customs duty on imported \nmachinery and equipment and raw materials. See www.brunet.bn/gov/dca/services:htm", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  17 \n \nIn PNG, Jacksons Airport (Port Moresby) is the only airport regularly served by international \ncarriers. It has two runways (2,750 meters [m] and 2,072 m in length), two passenger \nterminals (international and domestic), and one aircraft stand. The facilities are adequate to \ncater to the limited international flights currently operated but will need to be expanded \nshould PNG economic growth accelerate in the future.\nIn Timor-Leste, Presidente Nicolau Lobato (Dili) International Airport is run by the Civil \nAviation Division of the Ministry of Transport, Communication and Public Works. Facilities \nare said to be basic. The existing 1,850 meter runway, which was repaved in 2005, is \ncapable of accommodating B727 and A319 aircraft. The government plans to begin work on \na runway extension in 2009 to accommodate B757 and similar aircraft. The improvements \nwill be funded by royalty income from oil and gas deposits. \n6.3 Regional Airports \nIn some aSEA economies, deficiencies in regional aviation infrastructure act as a constraint \non  the  efficient  development  of  air  services.  For  example,  some  regional  airports  in \nIndonesia  are  unable  to  accommodate  aircraft  types  operated  by  foreign  airlines (e.g., \nPontianak) while others lack adequate terminal facilities (Medan). Runway length and width \nmay also constrain air services. Investment in facilities is also required at secondary airports \nin the Philippines. Terminal facilities are said to be inadequate at the Davao International \nAirport where the opening of the new terminal has been delayed due to technical problems. \nInvestment is also required at secondary gateways such as Clark and Laoag. \nSimilarly, a shortage of skilled management and labor may constrain the growth of the \naviation industry. Airline operations rely on a range of highly skilled employees, such as \nexperienced managers and information technology professionals. In some countries, these \nskills are in short supply. In particular, managers with experience of the aviation industry \nmay not be readily available. This will hinder the development of airlines and aviation \ninfrastructure. While these skills can be obtained from hiring staff from other countries, this \ncan be expensive and it can erode the competitive base of the airlines.\nAttempts are being made to improve the efficiency of regional airports by various aSEA \ngovernments. The Government of Malaysia is committed to improve the accessibility and \nservices  provided  by  regional  airports  such  as  Penang,  Langkawi,  Kuching,  and  Kota \nKinabalu to support regional growth and development. Langkawi Airport (Kedah), serving a \nmajor holiday destination, has been recently redeveloped. The existing terminal has been \nextended and refurbished and a runway built capable of handling B747 aircraft. The airport \nis now able to handle 2.5 million passengers a year and has the ability to handle up to 1,000 \npassengers per hour in peak periods. \nThe ownership structure of Indonesian regional airports is being overhauled in an attempt to \nmake them more efficient. Until recently, Indonesia\u2019s regional airports were operated by two \nstate-owned enterprises: Angkasa Pura 1 managed airports in Eastern Indonesia while \nairports in Western Indonesia were managed by Angkasa Pura 2. The recent devolution of ", "18 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\npower from the central to provincial governments has seen provincial governments take \ncontrol of some regional airports. Privatization of some airports has also occurred. \nIn the Philippines, the government intends to divert traffic from Manila to regional airports \nsuch as Cebu, Davao, Subic, Clark, and Laoag by encouraging foreign airlines to provide \nservices to these destinations. However, flights by foreign airlines to regional airports count \ntoward  their  entitlements  as  set  as  in  the  relevant  air  service  agreements  (ASAs). An \nalternative policy might create additional traffic rights for airlines willing to fly to regional \nairports. \n7. Aviation Policy: Pressures for Reform \nGlobally, aviation markets have significantly changed since the late 1980s. The industry, \nhistorically subject to close regulation, has benefited from market liberalization, privatization, \nand a relaxation of restrictive ownership rules. The recent emphasis on the benefits flowing \nfrom liberalization, especially for tourism and regional development, has encouraged policy \nmakers to take a new, more open approach to aviation regulation. Deregulation has driven \nchange in the Southeast Asian aviation industry since the 1990s.  \n7.1 Aviation Policy Objectives \nNational aviation policies reflect varying national objectives and differences in the resource \nendowments of individual aSEA countries. Not only do the objectives of aviation policy differ \nbut the sophistication of the policies adopted and the ability to implement them effectively \nalso differ across aSEA countries. In general, the more developed aSEA countries have \nclear policy objectives and well-developed policies for the aviation sector. For example, \nSingapore\u2019s aviation policy focuses on the promotion of Singapore as an aviation hub. \nSuccess depends on Singapore adopting liberal aviation policies to attract airlines to serve it \nrather than competing destinations. In contrast, PNG\u2019s rudimentary aviation policy merely \nattempts to ensure that the country has links to key trading partners. \nHistorically,  international  aviation  has  been  a  highly  regulated  industry.  International \nagreement on the rights of airlines domiciled in country A to offer air services across the \nterritories of countries B, C, and D was made necessary by the 1919 Paris Convention \nwhich gave complete and absolute sovereignty to each nation over the air space above its \nterritory. Modern attempts to reach a multilateral agreement covering traffic rights date from \nthe Chicago Conference of 1944. At Chicago the concept of \u201dfreedom\u201d (or transit privilege) \nwas defined as a key principle of air law. Essentially these freedoms (Table 8) are agreed \nlimitations on the provision of international air services. \nSince the 1980s, the international aviation industry has been partially deregulated. This is \noften referred to as a move toward \"open sky,\" which may be pursued on a bilateral, ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  19 \n \nregional, or multilateral basis. Open sky policies usually incorporate multiple (rather than \nsingle) airline designation, removal of capacity controls on a given route(s), or the removal \nof price controls.16\n7.2 Airline Ownership \nCountries in aSEA differ in their policies regarding ownership and control. For example, an \nairline  registered  in  Brunei  Darussalam  must  be  substantially  owned  and  effectively \ncontrolled  by  Brunei  interests,  while  Malaysia  reserves  51%  ownership  for  Malaysian \nnationals  and  the  Philippine  Constitution  provides  for  60%  ownership  by  Filipinos  and \neffective Filipino management and control. \nPrivately  owned  carriers  compete  with  government-owned  airlines  in  some  aSEA \neconomies, primarily on domestic and intra-ASEAN routes. For example, Malaysian-based \nAir Asia offers services to a number of Southeast and East Asian destinations. Similarly, \nBangkok Air is active on routes to neighboring ASEAN countries. As noted above, low-cost \ncarriers such as Air Asia, Jetstar Asia, and Valuair have expanded their range of services \nsince 2004. \n7.3 Air Service Agreements \nBilateral arrangements, commonly referred to as air service agreements (ASAs), remain the \nmost common form of airline regulation among aSEA states. Paralleling ASEAN initiatives to \nmove toward open sky, the more developed ASEAN economies are entering into new ASAs \nhaving  open  sky  characteristics.  Malaysia  has  open  skies  agreements  with  the  US; \nTaipei,China; New Zealand; Austria; Luxembourg; and Lebanon. Further, several countries \nhave exchanged fifth freedom rights, while Thailand has granted extensive fifth freedom \nrights to encourage the development of an aviation hub at Bangkok. \nThere  have  been  broader  regional  movements  toward  open  sky,  most  notably  the \nMultilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of International Air Transport (MALIAT) between \nBrunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and the US. MALIAT entered into force \nin December 2001. The key features of the agreement are (i) open routes, (ii) open traffic \nrights,  (iii)  no  capacity  limits,  (iv)  multiple  airline  designation,  and  (v)  code-sharing \nprovisions. Aviation liberalization policies were also adopted in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. \nWhereas ASAs in the 1950s and 1960s typically designated a single airline from each \nparticipating country to serve a given route, more recent, liberalized ASAs allow multiple \nairline  designation.  For  example,  Brunei  Darussalam  allows  either  double  or  multiple \ndesignation  where  the  other  party  agrees  to  reciprocal  rights.  Similarly,  most  active \nIndonesian ASAs allow for multiple designation of airlines. \n                                                           \n \n16   B. Solis and C.L.S. Rodolfo. 2008. ASEAN Community and Philippine Developments. November. ", "20 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nBefore 1990, bilateral ASAs usually specified which gateways or airports had to be used by \nairlines operating international routes. Recent liberalized ASAs permit airlines to choose the \ngateways they wish to serve. Some aSEA economies operate a multiple gateway policy. For \nexample, most Indonesian ASAs include separate traffic rights to holiday gateways such as \nDenpasar (Bali), while airlines from nations signing open sky agreements with Malaysia are \nfree to operate into any or all of the country\u2019s six international gateways. Other aSEA \ncountries  encourage  foreign  airlines  to  serve  secondary  gateways.  For  example,  the \nGovernment of the Philippines encourages foreign airlines to call at Cebu and Davao to \npromote tourism. \n7.4 Airline Cooperative Agreements \nIn general, the ASEAN members of aSEA allow their national airlines to join airline alliances. \nSingapore Airlines and Thai Airways are members of the Star Alliance. Similarly, a number \nof  Brunei  Darussalam\u2019s  ASAs  allow  airline  cooperative  arrangements,  including  code \nsharing, while Malaysia and Indonesia have approved Malaysia Airlines and Garuda\u2019s third \ncountry code-sharing services to Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. PNG has \nallowed Qantas and Air New Guinea to enter into cooperative working arrangements on the \nAustralia\u2013PNG route. To date there has been no need for Timor-Leste to take a stance on \nairline cooperative agreements. \n7.5 Air Freight and Air Charter Policies \nASEAN members of aSEA have adopted relatively liberal policies regarding air freight and \nthe operation of air charters. Brunei Darussalam permits dedicated air freight services, while \nMalaysia  has  signed  bilateral  open  skies  cargo  agreements  with  Germany  and  the \nNetherlands. Similarly, Brunei Darussalam values charter operations as a means of meeting \nseasonal or temporary demands for the carriage of passengers and freight (e.g., pilgrims to \nand from the Middle East). However, some countries such as the Philippines are concerned \nthat charter flights may divert traffic away from scheduled airline services.\n7.6 Toward Open Skies: ASEAN Initiatives \nThe relatively high rates of Asian economic growth in the 1990s, coupled with the prevailing \nphilosophy favoring the liberalization of trade in goods and services, encouraged ASEAN \ngovernments to liberalize their domestic and international aviation sectors. However, ASEAN \nas an institution was a relatively late convert to the benefits of airline liberalization. While the \nASEAN Framework Agreement on Services created opportunities to lower barriers to trade \nin services, the agreement did not include the aviation sector. \nThe ASEAN  leaders\u2019  summit  held  in  Bali  in  October  2003  agreed  to  accelerate  trade \nliberalization in 11 priority sectors, 8 involving trade in goods and 3 concerning services. Air \ntravel was selected as 1 of the 11 priority sectors. The commitment to the accelerated \nliberalization of the priority sectors was acknowledged in the ASEAN Framework Agreement \nfor the Integration of the Priority Sectors (2004). Of relevance to this study, Article 10 \n(Logistics Services) of this agreement commits ASEAN governments to support transport ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  21 \n \nsector liberalization by strengthening intra-ASEAN maritime and shipping transport services, \nand by achieving better interconnectivity, interoperability, and intermodality with the national, \nregional, and international maritime and air transport gateways.\nSector road maps were prepared for each priority sector, the aviation road map being \nadopted  by ASEAN  member  states  in  November  2004.  Under  the  aviation  road  map, \nliberalization was to start in 2008. Separate agreements deal with international air freight \nand international passenger services. The liberalization process for air freight began with the \n2002 MOU on air freight services. Under the MOU contracting parties agree to allow the \nofficial carriers of other contracting parties to provide international freight services. The MOU \nprovides for the rights to fly across each other\u2019s territory without landing (first freedom \ntraffic), as well as second, third, fourth, and fifth freedom rights within the region.17 At the \n12th ASEAN Transport Ministers meeting in 2007, a protocol was adopted allowing national \ncarriers  to  operate  all-cargo  services  with a capacity limit of 250 tons weekly in each \ndirection on a given route, with no limitations on frequency or aircraft type.18\nCritics have noted that the ASEAN initiatives have been slow to gain traction. However, \nunder the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services, contracting parties will extend second, \nthird, fourth, and fifth freedom rights for passenger services to carriers of other contracting \nparties. Full liberalization of third and fourth freedom rights between ASEAN capital cities \nwas introduced on 31 December 2008. This is to be followed by the full liberalization of fifth \nfreedom traffic rights between ASEAN capital cities by 31 December 2010. At present, the \ndeclared ASEAN goal is full liberalization of international air services by 2015.  \nASEAN members differ in their commitment to the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services. It \nseems likely that four countries\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand\u2014\nwill  adopt  full  liberalization  according  to  the  above  timetable.  Other ASEAN  members, \nnotably Indonesia, continue to employ selective protectionist policies. For example, until \nrecently Indonesia protected Garuda by refusing to allow Singapore-based low-cost carriers \nto offer services to its four main cities, including Jakarta. \nAssuming that the momentum toward open sky policies is maintained within the aSEA \nregion, some or all of the following policies are likely to be adopted over the next decade: \n(cid:2)  liberalization of bilateral agreements and/or the broadening of subregional cooperation; \n(cid:2)  the opening up of secondary gateways; \n(cid:2)  a relaxation of ownership and investment rules; \n(cid:2)  ending of noncompetitive code-sharing agreements; \n                                                           \n \n17   The second freedom grants the right to stop in a country for refueling or maintenance on the way to another \ndestination, without transferring passengers or cargo. Third and fourth freedom rights enable carriers to carry \npassengers and cargo between each other\u2019s territory, while fifth freedom rights allow connecting flights to a third \ncountry. \n18   See ASEAN, Twelfth ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting, Bangkok, 8 February 2007. ", "22 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\n(cid:2)  liberalization  of  policy  stance  relating  to  aviation  service  markets  (ground  handling, \nfreight forwarding, computer reservation systems); and \n(cid:2)  agreements to liberalize aviation markets between aSEA states and the outside world.19\n8. Conclusion \nDespite  the  region's  attempts  at  reform,  aviation markets are subject to more detailed \neconomic regulation than shipping markets and the regulation of the aviation industry acts to \nprevent  adjustments  taking  place  when  external conditions change. In this light, policy \nrecommendations  in  this  paper  will  therefore  focus  on  ways  of  creating  the  freedom \nnecessary to develop competitive aviation markets. Ideally, governments should develop a \nregulatory regime conducive to the growth and development of an efficient aviation industry. \nThis  would  imply  the  creation  of  more  competitive  aviation  markets,  encouraging  the \nindustry to be more responsive to changes in consumer needs and changing technology. In \ngeneral, governments should consider moving toward open sky policies. \nHowever, the term \"open sky\" is open to interpretation. It could imply the creation of a single \naviation market across the aSEA region, analogous to the European aviation market. Given \nthe differing objectives and constraints facing the various countries in aSEA, such a market \nmight allow different rates of progress by individual countries. Alternatively, an open sky \npolicy might allow freedom of route choice by aSEA domiciled airlines, while restricting the \nability of non-aSEA airlines to serve intra-aSEA routes.\nThe movement toward open sky policies in the aSEA region is unlikely to take place in one \ndramatic \"big bang.\" It is more likely be a gradual process involving the liberalization of \nASAs, a relaxation of ownership and investment rules, and a freeing up of regulations \nrelating  to  aviation  service  markets.  Hence,  this  paper  suggests  the  following  policy \nrecommendations:\ni) Further liberalize ASAs \nThis might take on any of the following forms:   \nDual or Multiple Designation \u2013 Competition is limited when there are only two airlines on a \ngiven route, one from each country (single designation). One way to liberalize aviation \nmarkets is to allow two airlines from each country (dual designation) to operate on a route. \n                                                           \n \n19   See B. Solis and C.L.S. Rodolfo, ASEAN Aviation Community and Philippine Development, November \n2008.", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  23 \n \nAlternatively, all restrictions could be removed on the number of airlines serving a given \nroute (multiple designation), allowing individual airlines themselves to determine whether \nthere are profitable opportunities on the route in question.  \nChoice of Gateways \u2013 Most ASAs specify which airport gateways must be used by airlines \noperating  international  routes.  Modest  liberalization  is  possible  by  permitting  airlines  to \nchoose which gateways they wish to use. The use of secondary gateways may relieve \npressure on the main international airport(s). Where a secondary gateway serves tourist \ndestinations,  the  tourist  industry  and  regional  development  may  benefit.  The  use  of \nsecondary gateways may be encouraged by ensuring that airlines serving regional airports \ndo not incur a penalty so far as metropolitan access is concerned.\nAbolition of Capacity Controls \u2013 Many aviation routes still have controls on the total \nallowable capacity on a route, and/or on the capacity to be offered by individual airlines. The \ntype of aircraft to be used may also be specified. Typically, capacity controls involve the \nselection of a benchmark type of aircraft (e.g., B767). Allowable capacity on the route will \nthen be measured in terms of the number of B767 flights per week. Such controls prevent \neffective  competition  between  airlines.  The  removal  of  capacity  controls  is  a  common \nfeature of open skies regimes.\nCharter Flights \u2013 Charter flights are commonly used to promote tourism in Europe, the US, \nand Australia. The benefits and costs experienced by stakeholders helped them prepare for \nthe deregulation of scheduled services. Many open skies agreements permit charter flights \nwith restrictions to certain destinations.\nAir Cargo \u2013 Most countries have a more flexible approach to air cargo than to passenger \ncarriage. Cargo is less sensitive to \u201cnational identity\u201d than passengers. Some countries have \nliberalized their cargo sectors first, de-linking air cargo from passenger services, removing \nrestrictions on gateways, and lifting restrictions on third, fourth, and fifth freedom capacity.\nii) Relax Ownership and Investment Rules \nRelaxation of ownership and investment rules could lead to a more competitive airline \nindustry.  Policy  changes,  which  could  lead  to  a  more  dynamic  industry,  include  the \nprivatization of government-owned airlines and the removal of barriers preventing foreign \ncarriers offering services on international routes. \nPrivatization of National Carriers \u2013 The removal or minimization of direct government \ninvolvement in the ownership and operation of air services would lower barriers to change \nwithin the aviation industry and free up scarce capital for aviation infrastructure.\nBarriers to Entry \u2013 Many ASAs contain clauses specifying the countries whose airlines are \npermitted to operate on a given route or routes. Thus, \u201cnationality,\u201d usually defined in terms \nof  ownership  and/or  effective  control,  determines  which  airlines  may  offer  services  on \ndesignated routes. Such restrictions limit the ability of foreign airlines to invest in overseas ", "24 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nmarkets.  While  these  requirements  tend  to  become  less  onerous  as  open  skies \narrangements spread, some countries still impose rigorous ownership requirements. There \nare a number of ways in which onerous nationality requirements might be liberalized. For \nexample, countries in the aSEA region might agree that any airline majority owned or \neffectively controlled by nationals of any aSEA country would be free to operate on any \nintra-aSEA route. \niii) Liberalize Regulations relating to Aviation Service Markets  \nHistorically,  a  number  of  aSEA  countries  have  put  in  place  restrictions  relating  to  the \nprovision of ground handling and other aviation-related services. For example, the build-\noperate-transfer contract for the new Terminal 3 in Manila required airlines to use the \nservices  of  monopoly  suppliers  of  catering  and  ground-handling  services.  Under  a \nliberalized regime, airlines should be free to choose their own operators. aSEA countries \nmight allow firms from other aSEA countries to handle these services in their airports. \nAlternatively, ground-handling services might be opened to any operator. \nOpening up the market for ground-handling services to greater competition will lead to lower \nground-handling charges, hence, lower operating costs for airlines, and improved quality of \nhandling services. Consumers should benefit from better quality of services if competition \nensures that airlines pass on the part of the cost savings to them. \nRemoval of other restrictions relating to aviation service markets (e.g., restrictions on the \nemployment of foreign airline personnel, rules relating to the remittance of earnings, and \nrestrictions regarding computer reservation systems) will have a similar effect. If decisions \nare based on commercial rather than political considerations, airlines will become more \nefficient in their operations in all parts of their network. Consumers will benefit from better \nquality of services. \niv) End Noncompetitive Code-Sharing Arrangements \nThe danger of code sharing, when there are only two carriers on a route, is that competition \nis  diminished.  There  is  a  strong  case  for  outlawing  code  sharing  on  grounds  that  it \ndiminishes competition. However, code sharing between carriers may be more acceptable \non routes in which there is extensive fifth freedom competition (e.g., Bangkok \u2013 Singapore). \nDeepen Subregional Cooperation (BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT)\nAir  connectivity  in  the  BIMP-EAGA  has  been  notoriously  poor.  While  the  BIMP-EAGA \naviation agreements relate to regional, secondary, and tertiary aviation services, they have \nbeen perceived as being relatively ineffective.\nThe full exchange of third and fourth freedom rights as well as the general adoption of fifth \nfreedom rights offers a partial solution to the region\u2019s aviation problems. Fifth freedom rights \nallow an air carrier domiciled in a member country to pick up traffic in another BIMP-EAGA ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  25 \n \nmember country and carry it to a third member country as part of a service to and from the \nhome country of the airline. It is encouraging to note that new entrants have begun services \nand airlines have introduced turboprop rather than jet aircraft. \nGiven the thin traffic on BIMP-EAGA routes, code sharing or even joint service provision \nmay be necessary to create the required connectivity. Third-country code sharing would \nseem  to  be  appropriate  to  build  initial  linkages.  As  and  when  traffic  has  built  to  an \nappropriate level (most probably a daily service on a given route), any increase in service \nlevels should be allocated in a way that reduces the anticompetitive element inherent in \ncode shares and joint services. \nv) Consider Modifying or Abolishing Cabotage Restrictions \nAs noted above, the domestic aviation markets of aSEA countries are generally reserved for \nairlines domiciled in the home state, although several countries have deregulated their \ndomestic aviation markets. However, foreign investors are already able to invest in domestic \naviation in certain aSEA countries. For example, foreign participation is allowed in the \nPhilippines but is limited by the 60% domestic\u201340% foreign participation provision of the \nConstitution.\nIt was found that some open skies agreements permit airlines from other countries to \noperate domestic services. For example, under current arrangements, the Singapore-owned \nTiger Airways is allowed to operate domestic services in Australia.20 However, many open \nskies agreement do not allow entry in domestic aviation markets.\nPotential  gains  are  available  if  foreign  airlines  are  permitted  to  operate  domestically. \nOpening up entry in this way could lead to greater competition, better connections between \ndomestic and foreign routes, and lower fares. Tourism would benefit from seamless travel. \nHowever, there are potential drawbacks. Opening up domestic routes to foreign carriers \nmight undermine the viability of domestic carriers.\nvi) Subsidies Services on \u201cThin\u201d Regional and/or Domestic Routes\nWhile the primary role of government is to facilitate aviation outcomes that are commercially \ndriven or are likely to prove commercially viable in the long run, there may be cases in which \ngovernment intervention is necessary to provide a service to regional communities. In cases \nin which governments wish to ensure that there are adequate airline services on long, thin \nroutes (including regional and domestic), which are marginal or unlikely to be economically \nself-sustaining in the long run, there is a case for subsidizing airlines. \n                                                           \n \n20   It was found that while Tiger Airways is not allowed to fly international routes from a base in Australia, it is \nallowed (as a Singaporean airline) to fly to and from Australia from its Singapore base. This leads to the bizarre \nsituation in which Tiger Airways can fly a Singapore-based aircraft from, for example, the Singapore\u2013Perth\u2013\nSingapore route but cannot fly a Perth-based aircraft for the Perth\u2013Singapore\u2013Perth route.", "26 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.2\nSubsidy payments should be tied to clearly defined objectives and should be justified within \nthe framework of a comprehensive transport policy. They should be transparent and subject \nto regular review. There has been a tendency for governments to seek value for taxpayer \nfunds by putting out subsidized service to tender. Wherever practical, subsidies should be \nawarded based an open and competitive tendering process. Tender periods should be of \nlimited duration.\nvii) Create Regional Sinking Fund to Finance Airport Improvements \nWhile the region\u2019s major international airports operate efficiently by world standards and \nsome regional airports operate relatively efficiently, many regional and most local airports \nsuffer from lack of funding and facilities. Since the benefits of aviation liberalization are \ndependent  on the existence of efficient infrastructure\u2014including airports and regulatory \nsystems\u2014there  is  a  case  for  providing  national  or  regional  revolving  funds  to  finance \nimprovements to local and regional airports. \nLiberalization of aviation markets can create direct and indirect benefits and costs. The \ndirect benefits and costs from liberalization will be experienced by \n(cid:2)  passengers, who should gain from lower fares and better services;  \n(cid:2)  airlines, which will lose out from lower fares but benefit from lower costs and access to \nnew markets; and \n(cid:2)  the tourism sector, which will gain from the stimulus provided by lower airfares and \nbetter services. But outbound tourism will also increase in the more developed aSEA \neconomies and some countries may lose from this effect. \naSEA countries are expected to experience a range of indirect impacts, which may be \npositive  or  negative,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  a  particular  country.  Indirect \nimpacts  include  (i)  effects  on  government  revenue,  (ii)  foreign  exchange  effects,  (iii) \nemployment  effects,  (iv)  and  effects  flowing  from  improvements  to  business \ncommunications.  The  scale  of  potential  impacts  depend  on  the  circumstances  facing \nindividual countries, including the relative size of inbound and outbound tourism and the \nmarket shares on key routes held by its airlines. \nSubstantial direct costs would be incurred in upgrading infrastructure and providing airline \nservices,  especially  where  regional  airport  facilities  require  substantial  investment  and \nwhere many islands require improved airline connectivity (as in the case of BIMP-EAGA). \nFurther, improving airline connectivity between less-developed regions appears likely to \nincur substantial indirect costs, especially in the short run. Subsidies, tax concessions, and \nother incentives may be necessary to persuade airlines to offer the desired services. It was \nnoted that subsidies make it difficult for airlines to compete on equal terms. It is important \nthat subsidies be transparent and allocated on a basis, which does not distort competition. ", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  27 \n \nIn  moving  toward  liberalized  aviation  markets,  there  is  a  risk  that  airlines  engage  in \nanticompetitive behavior, such as predatory pricing and collusion. Given that competition \npolicy is in its infancy in most ASEAN countries, an acceptable alternative approach might \nbe to develop an ASEAN code of conduct for airlines. \nFinancial instability,, which currently affects many ASEAN airlines, is a problem. In part, this \nis the result of intensifying competition and, hence, thin margins in a high-operating cost \nindustry.  Some  ASEAN  carriers  (e.g.,  Garuda  and  Philippine  Airlines)  simply  lack  the \nresources to compete effectively with the region\u2019s dominant carriers\u2014Singapore Airlines, \nMalaysia Airlines, and Thai Airways. Where undercapitalized airlines have been privatized, \nthey have proved vulnerable to external shocks such as oil price increases and sharp falls in \npassenger and cargo volumes. For example, during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, \nGaruda, Malaysia Airlines, and Philippines Airlines had to be rescued by their respective \ngovernments.  While  there  are  no  easy  solutions  to  this  problem,  a  staged  process  of \nliberalization would give airlines time to address their financial problems.\nThe availability of managerial and technical skills differs widely among the countries of \nASEAN. Cross-country investments, strategic alliances, and cooperation will help reduce \ndifferences.\nAs Christopher Findlay has noted,21 policy makers must necessarily be concerned with the \nsequencing of aviation reforms. The aim should be to introduce reforms in such a way that \ntheir impact is cumulative and self-reinforcing: successful reform building on the reform \nplatform already established. We note that changes in \u201cmarket access\u201d (i.e., rules relating to \nentry and capacity) that have already occurred in the aSEA region are creating pressures for \nfurther change. The opening of markets has created the need for more capital to purchase \nthe planes and ground equipment to service them. The need for more capital, in turn, leads \nto pressure for changes in ownership rules. Aviation reform within the aSEA region is also \nbeing driven by events in the market place and by regulatory reform in the rest of the world. \nThe end result should be an aviation industry that provides improved connectivity throughout \nthe aSEA region as well as being more responsive to market needs.\n                                                           \n \n21   Christopher Findlay, Strategic Directions for ASEAN Airlines in a Globalizing World: Overview, REPSF\nProject No. 04/008, Final Report, August 2005, p.3.

Such services call at regional hub airports (Singapore, \nBangkok, and Kuala Lumpur). Smaller aSEA economies do not generate sufficient \ntraffic to warrant calls by Tier One Services, nor do many regional airports have the \nability to handle large jet aircraft.\nTier Two  Regional routes that generate sufficient traffic to warrant the use of medium size jets \n(A320,  B757).  Such  services  may  link  two  or  more  aSEA  economies  (e.g., \nSingapore\u2013East Malaysia\u2013Brunei Darussalam). Tier Two services may funnel traffic \nto and from regional hub airports. Alternatively, they may link one or more airports \nwithin aSEA with economies outside the aSEA region (e.g., Singapore\u2013Ho Chi Minh \nCity). \nTier Three  Intraregional low volume and/or low-frequency routes best suited to turboprop rather \nthan  jet  aircraft.

", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview  \nThe archipelagic region of Southeast Asia consists of 24,000 islands, spread across  \n5,200 kilometers (kms) from east to west and 3,400 kms from north to south, with a population \nof about 350 million. Many of the islands are poor, remote from main centers of economic \nactivity, and not well connected. Improving air connectivity can be instrumental in reducing \ndevelopment gaps. The paper examines the importance of improving air connectivity, and \nthe state of the airline industry and the related infrastructure in the region. Special attention  Southeast Asia\nis paid to regional policies relating to air transport, and the paper concludes with policy \nWorking Paper Series\nrecommendations.  \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast \nAsia: An Overview\nKeith Trace, Barend Frielink, and Denis Hew\nNo. 2   |   September 2009 \nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. WPS090828 Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090915085700+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS3 (5.0)", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 8.0", "ModDate": "D:20090918150732+08'00'", "Trapped": "False"}}
