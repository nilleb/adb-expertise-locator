Introduction \n\nArchipelagic  Southeast  Asia  (aSEA)  covers  five  member  countries  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations \nthe \n(ASEAN)\u2014Brunei  Darussalam, \nPhilippines, and Singapore\u2014together with Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste.1 The aSEA \nregion includes the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East Asian Growth \nArea  (BIMP-EAGA)  and  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand  Growth  Triangle  (IMT-GT) \nsubregional cooperation programs. \n\nIndonesia,  Malaysia, \n\nThe key to understanding the region lies in an appreciation of its archipelagic nature. aSEA \nincludes more than 24,000 islands, spread across 5,200 kilometers (km) from east to west \nand  3,400  km  from  north  to  south.  It  has  a  population  of  over  350  million,  225  million  of \nwhom live in Indonesia with a further 87 million living in the Philippines (Green 2008).\n\nTo  the  inhabitants  of  the  archipelago,  the  sea  is  at  once  a  link  and  a  barrier,  as  well  as  a \nresource  and  a  challenge.  On  the  positive  side  of  the  ledger,  the  sea  provides  food  and \nemployment,  while  the  danger  of  an  unsustainable  marine  environment  and  the  fact  that \nproximity to the sea heightens vulnerability to national disaster are potential negatives. \n\nThis  paper  provides  an  overview  of  airline  connectivity  in  the  aSEA  region.  Section  2 \ndiscusses  the  economic  diversity  and  development  gap  that  exists  among  the  aSEA \ncountries.  Section  3  examines  the  importance  of  improving  airline  connectivity  in  bridging \nthis economic divide at the local, regional, and international levels. Section 4 examines the \ndemand  for  airline  passenger  and  freight  services  in  the  aSEA  region.  In  Section  5  we \ninvestigate  the  supply  of  airline  services  on  regional  and  long-distance  (intercontinental) \nroutes.  Special  attention  is  paid  to  the  emergence  of  low-cost  airlines  and  the  supply  of \nairline  services  on  \"thin\"  regional  routes,  such  as  those  linking  regions  of  BIMP-EAGA. \nSection  6  assesses  the  region's  aviation  infrastructure,  contrasting  the  efficiency  of  major \nhub  airports  with  the  problems  experienced  by  regional  airports.  Section  7  examines \nregional policies relating to air transport, arguing that an industry historically subject to close \nregulation  has  benefited  from  market  liberalization,  privatization,  and  a  relaxation  of \nrestrictive  ownership  rules.  Section  8  contains  policy  recommendations  designed  to \nstrengthen  aviation  connectivity.  This  section  also  highlights  the  costs  and  potential \nproblems that may arise with the implementation of policies to improve aviation connectivity. \n\n2. The aSEA Economies\n\nThe aSEA economies are extremely diverse (Table 1, page 30). Their population varies from \n225  million  in  Indonesia  to  40,000  in  Brunei.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita \nvaries  from  $440  in  Timor-Leste  to  over  $35,000  in  Singapore.  aSEA  countries  differ \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n1  Where relevant, this report will make reference to Thailand as well. \n\n\f2 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nsignificantly in their reliance on foreign trade. Measured by the ratio of exports to GDP, the \ndegree of trade openness varies widely from 2.2% in Timor-Leste to 230.9% in Singapore. \n\nWhile the ASEAN member nations of aSEA are at first glance diverse, they share a number \nof  common  features.  Singapore  is  a  mature  economy  with  a  level  of  GDP  per  capita \ncomparable  with  many  advanced  western  industrial  nations.  Having  experienced  strong \neconomic  growth  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  Malaysia  has  enjoyed  renewed  growth \nfollowing  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  the  late  1990s.  Brunei  is  a  wealthy  country  heavily \ndependent on earnings from oil. Indonesia developed rapidly in the 1980s based on labor-\nintensive  manufacturing  (mainly  centered  on  Java)  but  has  failed  to  maintain  early \nmomentum. The Philippines has yet to take off economically with sustained growth. These \ncountries  have  a  number  of  features  in  common:  (i)  relatively  open  economic  policies,  (ii) \nlow and reducing levels of tariff protection, (iii) and a strong reliance on export-led economic \ngrowth. Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines also have in common large areas that are \nnot  well  connected  and  much  poorer  than  the  main  centers  (eastern  Indonesia,  East \nMalaysia, southern Philippines). \n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste are at a much earlier stage of economic growth \nthan  their  ASEAN  counterparts.  Not  only  is  their  GDP  per  capita  much  lower  but  Timor-\nLeste\u2019s  very  low  trade  intensity  also  reflects  the  country\u2019s  wider  political  and  economic \nproblems.  PNG  and  Timor-Leste\u2019s  transport  needs  and  existing  service  patterns  differ \nsignificantly from those of the ASEAN members of aSEA. Timor-Leste has extremely limited \nairline and shipping links. PNG's connectivity is also poor and tends to be oriented toward \nAustralia rather than Southeast Asia.  \n\nThe development gap between the ASEAN members of aSEA and Papua New Guinea can \nbe  considered  analogous  with  that  between  the  more  advanced  ASEAN  countries  (the \nASEAN  6)  and  the  newer  and  less-developed  members,  i.e.,  Cambodia,  Lao  People's \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. \n\n3. The Importance of Air Connectivity \n\nImproved air connectivity through air transport links is an essential component of economic \ngrowth,  as  it  provides  personal  access  to  the  region  for  business,  social,  or  recreational \npurposes,  as  well  as  physical  access  to  resources  and  markets.  Improved  access  allows \nproducers  to  take  advantage  of  an  expansion  of  trade,  economies  of  scale,  and \nspecialization,  thus  lowering  costs  and  prices  and  widening  production  choices.  The \ngeography of the region favors air transport, Distances between capital cities are substantial \nand  cross-border  land  links  limited.  Moreover,  in  archipelagic  countries  such  as  Indonesia \nand  the  Philippines,  travelers  have  to  choose  between  relatively  slow  and  uncomfortable \ncombinations of sea and land transport and relatively swift air passage.   \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  3 \n\n \n\n \n\nAir  transport  carries  both  passengers  and  freight.  Regular  scheduled  airline  services  are \nespecially  important  for  business  communication,  facilitating  both  trade  and  investment. \nThey also play a critical role in stimulating leisure travel, a vital sector, given the importance \nof tourism for the aSEA economies. While most passengers fly on regular scheduled airline \nservices,  charter  flights  are  important  in  specialist  markets  such  as  pilgrimage  traffic \nbetween  Southeast  Asia  and  the  Middle  East.  Air  freight  is  carried  in  the  cargo  holds  of \npassenger aircraft and specialist cargo aircraft.  \n\nAt a local level, Tier 4 air services connect local communities with regional centers. In aSEA, \nsuch  connections  often  link  island  communities  with  their  closest  regional  center.  Where \nsuch routes are internal, they are subject to cabotage restrictions, reserving air services for \nairlines owned by citizens of the country. They are usually serviced by small 6\u201318 seat prop \nor  turbo-prop  aircraft.  While  some  routes  may  be  commercially  viable,  many  require \nsubsidization.\n\nImproved  air  connectivity  at  a  regional  level  enables  business  to  provide  better  service  to \ncustomers and offer opportunities for tourism and improved social networking. Enhanced air \nconnectivity widens the potential market available to local producers, providing opportunities \nto specialize in agricultural or industrial production according to comparative or competitive \nadvantage. The  economies  of  scale  generated  may  enable  firms  to  lower  the  unit  price  of \ntheir products and further widen their market. \n\nRegional air services include (I) airline services between regional centers within country A; \n(ii)  airline  services  between  regional  centers  in  country  A  and  that  country\u2019s  metropolitan \nmarket; (iii) airline services connecting regional centers in country A with regional centers in \ncountries  B,  C,  and  D;  and  (iv)  airline  services  between  regional  centers  in  country A  and \nkey  regional  aviation  hubs.  From  an  aviation  industry  perspective,  such  services  may  be \ndivided into \u201dhigh\u201d and \u201dlow\u201d frequency routes (Table 2, page 31).  \n\n\u201dHigh\u201d  frequency  routes  (Tier  2  services)  are  capable  of  supporting  a  jet  service  (A319, \nA320, B737, or similar aircraft) on a regular basis.2 They may be served by more than one \nairline. Where such routes link regional centers within a single country, they are subject to \ncabotage  restrictions.  Where  they  link  regional  centers  in  two  or  more  countries,  they  are \nregulated by air service agreements (ASAs) between the countries concerned.  \n\n\u201dLow\u201d frequency routes (Tier 3 services) are characterized by limited traffic flows. They may \nonly  be  able  to  sustain  services  by  a  single  carrier.  In  practice  they  are  often  operated  by \nsurplus  jet  capacity  (A319,  A320,  B737,  or  similar)  although  they  may  be  more  suited  to \nturbo-prop  aircraft,  which  may  offer  a  higher  frequency  service  compatible  with  market \nrequirements. As  noted  above,  where  such  routes  link  regional  centers  in  a  given  country, \nthey  are  subject  to  cabotage  restrictions.  Routes  between  two  or  more  countries  are \nregulated by ASAs between the countries in question. Some routes may not be viable in the \nlong run.\n\n                                                           \n\n2   \"A\" denotes an aircraft type manufactured by Airbus Industrie, while \"B\u201d denotes an aircraft type produced by \nthe US-owned Boeing Aircraft Corporation. \n\n\f4 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nIn  a  globalized  world,  efficient  air  connections  between  the  aSEA  region  and  major \ninternational  markets  are  essential.  The  scale  of  passenger  arrivals  and  departures  at  the \nregion\u2019s major airports attests to the importance of air travel in the 21st century. The volume \nof  air  cargo  consigned  to  and  from  the  region  has  also  grown  rapidly.  Since  the  1980s,\nleading  aSEA  countries  have  enjoyed  rapid,  export-oriented  economic  growth,  driven  by \nmainly Japanese companies choosing to move production offshore and the quest for low-cost \nproduction  by  European  and  US  companies  as  well  as  by  declining  US  industrial \ncompetitiveness.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development \n(UNCTAD),  manufactures  account  for  over  70%  of  world  merchandise  trade  by  value.3\nAlthough a high proportion of manufactured exports, when measured by volume, are carried \nby sea, high value and/or perishable products are shipped by air.\n\n4. Demand for Airline Services \n\n4.1 Passenger Services \n\nthe country\u2019s population level; \n\nThe demand for international airline services to and from any given country will depend on \n\n(cid:2) \n\n(cid:2) \n\n(cid:2) \n\n(cid:2) \n\nits  income  per  capita  (high  levels  of  discretionary  income  being  associated  with  high \nlevels of demand for international travel); \n\nthe geographical location of the country, and especially its suitability as an international \nhub for aviation services; and \n\nthe relative attractiveness of the country as an international tourist destination. \n\nThe  scale  of  the  aviation  sector  within  aSEA  countries  and  its  potential  for  future  growth \ndepend  not  only  on  the  population  of  the  country  concerned,  but  also  on  its  per  capita \nincome  level,  geography,  attractiveness  to  foreign  tourists,  and  its  suitability  as  an  airline \nhub.  The  population  of  the  aSEA  region  is  over  350  million,  with  that  of  individual  states \nvarying from 40,000 in Brunei Darussalam to 87 million in the Philippines and 225 million in \nIndonesia.  Per  capita  income  varies  from  approximately  $440  in  Timor-Leste  to  $1,925  in \nIndonesia,  $32,000  in  Brunei  Darussalam,  and  $35,000  in  Singapore.  Citizens  of  Brunei \nDarussalam  and  Singapore  enjoy  relatively  high  levels  of  discretionary  income,  with  the \nresult that expenditure on airline services per capita is much higher than that of Timor-Leste \nor Indonesian citizens.\n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n3   See United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Review of Maritime Transport 2008,\nNew York and Geneva, United Nations, 2008, p. 8. \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  5 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 Demand for Intercontinental (Long Distance) Airline Services \n\nIntercontinental  services  operated  by  major  international  carriers  (Singapore  Airlines, \nMalaysian  Airlines,  Thai  International)  call  at  regional  hub  airports  (Singapore,  Kuala \nLumpur, Bangkok). \n\nHigh demand for both tourist and business travel to and from Singapore underpins Changi \nAirport\u2019s  role  as  the  major  airline  hub  of  Southeast  Asia.  Singapore\u2019s  role  as  a  major \nbusiness  and  financial  center  with  global  links  creates  a  substantial  demand  for  premium \naviation  travel.  Similarly,  inbound  and  outbound  tourist  numbers  are  high.  Singapore  is  a \npopular  stopover en route from Europe to East Asia and Australasia and is a major tourist \ndestination  in  its  own  right.  In  2007,  the  total  number  of  visitors  exceeded  10  million. \nSingaporean\u2019s  high  discretionary  incomes  also  generate  significant  numbers  of  outbound \ntourists.  The  small  size  of  Singapore  Island,  high  population  density  and  high  per  capita \nincome encourage Singaporeans to travel abroad. In 2007, there were 6.0 million outbound \ndepartures by Singapore residents, 4.2 million of which were by air (See Table 3, page 33). \n\nMalaysia too is an important tourist and business destination and relatively large numbers of \nMalaysian students study abroad.4 Demand for long-distance international airline passenger \nservices  to  and  from  Malaysia  is  therefore  high,  as  is  shown  by  airport  arrivals  and \ndepartures.  Kuala  Lumpur  International  Airport  (KLIA)  handled  24.1  million  passengers  in \n2006 (17.5 million in 2003).\n\nWhile  the  employment  of  Filipino  domestics  in  Asia  and  the  Middle  East,  as  well  as  the \nmovement of Filipino crews to and from their vessels, enhances the Philippines demand for \noverseas travel, average per capita incomes are too low to generate mass outward tourism. \nHowever, 1.9 million inbound tourists in 2002 generated $US2.5 billion in foreign exchange, \ncontributing  $US5.7  billion  to  GDP  and  employing  (directly  and  indirectly)  around  3  million \nFilipinos. Most tourists arrived from the US, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.\n\nTraffic to and from PNG and Timor-Leste is by above standards miniscule. The demand for \nairline  services  to  and  from  PNG  is  limited  by  the  relative  unattractiveness  of  PNG  to \ninternational tourists as well as by the low disposal income of PNG citizens. Incoming tourist \nnumbers are small, only 5% of arrivals being for leisure purposes. No significant growth of \ninbound tourism is likely in the near future as a result of the security situation and the lack of \nhotel infrastructure. The bulk of the air travel market is business and expatriate travel. Airline \nschedules to and from PNG suggest that the primary origin and destination is Australia. Air \nNiugini,  the  national  carrier,  is  the  sole  provider  of  direct  services  to  aSEA  countries.  The \nairline  operates  two  B767  services  a  week  from  Port  Moresby  to  Singapore,  totaling  534 \nseats in each direction. A 234-seat B757 operates weekly direct services from Port Moresby \nto Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Hong Kong. \n\nGiven the very low income level of its citizens, demand for air services to and from Timor-\nLeste  would  appear  to  stem  mainly  from  government  officials  and  representatives  of \n\n                                                           \n\n4   We note also that a sizable number of students from the aSEA region study in Malaysia and Singapore. \n\n\f6 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\ninternational agencies operating in the country. Demand for and supply of air freight appears \nto be very limited. \n\n4.2.1 Demand for Regional Airline Services \n\nThere  is  a  substantial  demand  for  airline  services  between  aSEA  countries,  especially \nbetween the ASEAN members of aSEA. Given the development of the manufacturing sector \nin ASEAN countries and the tendency to integrate production regionally, one would expect to \nfind a substantial proportion of the airline traffic is generated by business travelers.  \n\nTable 4 (page 34), based on ASEAN data for tourist arrivals, shows the substantial scale of \nintra-ASEAN tourism. The data suggest that Malaysia is the most important regional holiday \ndestination  for  ASEAN  citizens,  followed  by  Singapore  and  Thailand.  Interestingly,  a  high \nproportion of Philippines tourist arrivals come from outside the region. \n\nSingapore  is  a  major  hub  for  regional  and  intercontinental  airline  services.  In  2007,  3.7 \nmillion out of a total of 10 million visitors to Singapore came from ASEAN countries, mainly \nfrom Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand (Table 5, page 35).5\n\nThe  densest  regional  traffic  flows  are  between  the  major  metropolitan  centers,  notably \nSingapore\u2013Bangkok,  Singapore\u2013Jakarta,  Bangkok\u2013Kuala  Lumpur,  and  Kuala  Lumpur\u2013\nJakarta. The relative importance of intra-ASEAN traffic, as a proportion of total airline traffic, \nvaries between aSEA countries. For example, intra-ASEAN traffic accounts for 51% of total \ninternational  airline  traffic  at  Brunei  International Airport  (BIA),  60%  at  Jakarta\u2019s  Soekarno-\nHatta Airport and 40% at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  \n\nRegional airports also handle substantial passenger numbers. For example, within Malaysia \nKota  Kinabalu  International  Airport  handled  4  million  passengers  in  2006  (3.3  million  in \n2003);  Kuching  International  Airport,  3.2  million  passengers  in  2006  (2.9  million  in  2003); \nwhile Penang handled 3.1 million in 2006 (2.3 million in 2003).6\n\n4.2.2 Demand for Airline Services in Less-Developed Regions \n\nDemand  for  passenger  and  freight  services  between  the  less-developed  regions  of  aSEA, \nincluding  the  provinces  forming  the  BIMP-EAGA  and  the  IMT-GT  as  well  as  services \nbetween PNG and Timor-Leste and the ASEAN members of aSEA, is usually insufficient to \nsupport  frequent,  scheduled  airline  services.  In  the  absence  of  subsidization,  passengers \nand  freight  from  region A  may  have  to  fly  to  the  nearest  regional  hub  port  to  connect  with \nflights  for  region  B. This  may  involve  substantially  more  flying  and  waiting  time  at  the  hub \nairport.\n\n                                                           \n\n \nYearbook of Statistics Singapore 2008.

Other things \nbeing equal, air freight will be used where the supplier and the market are relatively distant \nand  unable  to  be  serviced  by  road  transport.  Demand  will  also  depend  on  the  commodity \ncomposition of imports and exports. Air freight is competitive for products with a high value \nto weight ratio (e.g., electronics and information technology). As a general guide, products \nwhose value exceeds $20 per kilogram are considered air eligible. Products that have to be \non the retailer\u2019s shelf within a few hours of growing or processing (cut flowers, crustaceans) \nand  products  that  have  a  short  product  life  cycle  (high  fashion  garments)  are  usually \nshipped by air. \n\nA  range  of  products with a relatively high value to weight ratio are shipped on regional air \nservices, sizable volumes of air cargo being moved on scheduled airline services operating \nbetween Singapore\u2013Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur\u2013Bangkok. The sector between Singapore\u2013\nKuala  Lumpur  is  too  short  to  attract  a  high  volume  of  air  freight.  A  high  proportion  of  the \nfreight between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is likely to be carried by road. \n\nAs  a  manufacturing  center  and  entrep\u00f4t  port,  Singapore\u2019s  Changi  Airport  handles  over  2 \nmillion tons of air freight annually. Imports arriving by air include perishable foodstuffs and \nhigh-value textiles and fashions. Most exports shipped by air are manufactures. Singapore \naccounts for about 40% of ASEAN exports of electronic products. While a high proportion of \nthese  exports  are  shipped  in  containers  by  sea,  higher-value  products  are  typically  air \nfreighted.  Similarly,  Singapore  accounts  for  45%  of  ASEAN  exports  of  information  and \ncommunication  technology  products.  The  high  value  of  many  of  these  products  (typically \nvarying between $10\u2013150 per kg) suggests that many are air freighted.7\n\nWhile KLIA handled 677,000 tons of air freight in 2006, Malaysian regional airports handled \nsignificantly  lower  volumes.  For  example,  Penang  handled  226,000  tons  of  air  freight  in \n2006, Kota Kinabalu 36,000 tons, and Kuching 30,000 tons. The relatively low volume of air \ncargo  handled  by  West  Malaysian  regional  airports  reflects  competition  from  rail  and  road \ntransport  across  the  land  borders  between  Malaysia\u2013Singapore  and  Malaysia\u2013Thailand. \nAnecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  the  bulk  of  the  substantial  two-way  trade  in  electronics \nand  information  and  communication  technology  equipment  between  Singapore  and \nMalaysia is carried by road.8\n\n                                                           \n\n7   We note that over 70% of Singapore information and communication technology (ICT) products are exported \nto  Malaysia.  Regrettably  no  statistics  relate  to  the  transport  mode  used  in  this  trade.  We  suspect  that  a  high \nproportion of ICT exports from Singapore to Malaysia (and vice versa) is handled by road transport. \n8   No statistical data is available on the modes of transport used. Our discussion of the movement of specific \n\u201cpriority products\u201d draws on Meyrick/PDP, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, \nFinal Report. \n\n\f8 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nIndonesia  is  the  most important regional producer of textiles and garments, accounting for \nabout  26%  of  regional  supply.  Exports  are  widely  distributed,  with  Malaysia  (9%)  and \nSingapore (6%) the principal regional destinations. While most textile and garment exports \nare  handled  by  container  shipping,  high-end  fashions  are  freighted  by  air.  Other  exports \nusing air freight include high-value seafood products (crustaceans).\n\nIn 2002, 2.5% of Philippine exports by volume (72% by value) moved by air. Electronics and \nrelated  products  accounted  for  approximately  50%  of  total  shipments  by  air.  The  major \nmarkets  for  air  freighted  products  were  the  US;  Japan;  Netherlands;  Republic  of  Korea; \nTaipei,China; and Singapore. \n\nIn 2002, Brunei\u2019s combined inbound and outbound cargo totaled 31.4 million kg. The growth \nof  air  cargo  through  BIA  averaged  27%  per  year  for  1997\u20132002.  BIA  acts  as  a \ntransshipment  point  for  high-value  air  cargo  (like  cellular  phones)  and  perishable \ncommodities (like prawns from Kota Kinabalu to Hong Kong, China). \n\nIn  PNG  the  demand  for  air  freight  is  limited.  Commodities  exported  by  PNG,  including  oil \nand other mineral products, are carried by ship. Australia is the primary destination for PNG \nexports  (30.1%  of  the  total  by  value).  Other  destinations  include  Japan  (8.1%)  and  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (5.7%).  The  aSEA  region  is  not  a  major  customer  for  PNG \nexports. PNG\u2019s merchandise imports include industrial and agri-business products, food and \nbeverages,  and  household  wares.  Australia  is  PNG's  major  supplier  of  imports  (52.3%). \nOther sources include Singapore (12.6%) and Japan (5.9%). High-value commodities from \nAustralia and Singapore are likely to be air freighted. Occasional air freight charters carrying \ntuna and other maritime products operate to Japan. More typically such produce is hubbed \nover Brisbane. \n\nSince a high proportion of aSEA\u2019s air freight is lifted in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft, \na close relationship exists between trends in the airline passenger services and trends in the \nprovision of air freight capacity. \n\n5. Supply of Airline Services \n\n5.1 Long-Distance (Intercontinental) Services \n\nLong  distance  (Tier  One)  services,  operated  by  major  international  airlines  such  as \nSingapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines, Thai Airways, and Emirates link regional hub airports \n(Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok) with major destinations in Europe, North America, \nEast  Asia,  and  Oceania.  However,  the  bilateral  bargaining  underpinning  ASAs  between \ncountry  A  and  country  B  ensures  that  airlines  from  every  sovereign  country  have  an \nopportunity to offer international flights to and from their home country. As a result, airlines \nsuch  as  Royal  Brunei,  Philippines  Air  Lines,  and  Garuda  Indonesia  also  operate \ninternational services to and from their country of origin. Typically, such airlines offer a more \nlimited range of intercontinental services than the major international airlines.   \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  9 \n\n \n\n5.2 Regional Services \n\nTable 6 (page 36) provides an overview of airline connectivity between aSEA countries. The \ntable  lists  the  number  of  city  pairs  connected  by  scheduled  airline  services.  The  countries \nwith  the  largest  number  of  connections  between  city  pairs  are  Malaysia  and  Indonesia. \nSingapore appears to have excellent connections with the region as a whole, while Thailand \nalso has strong regional connections. At the other end of the scale, PNG has limited airline \nconnectivity with Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, while Timor-Leste is connected \nonly to Indonesia and Singapore. \n\nIt  was  found  that  more  than  one  airline  may  offer  services  between  a  particular  city  pair. \nThus Table 6 should be read in conjunction with Table 7 (page 37). The latter suggests that \nthe major city pairs are served by between two to five airlines. Typically two of the airlines \nare national carriers, competing against one or more low-cost airlines.\n\n5.3 Airline Services to and from Less-Developed Regions \n\nMany  Asian  countries,  including  the  major  aSEA  economies,  have  successfully  adopted \nexport-oriented  growth  strategies  enabling  them  to  take  advantage  of  the  liberalized  world \ntrading  system.  However,  the  benefits  of  such  economic  growth  have  not  always  been \nshared  equally  between  the  regions  of  countries  such  as  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and \nThailand.  Transport  links  between  less-developed  regions  are  often  weak  or  nonexistent. \nThe fact that demand for regional air and shipping services in the past has been relatively \nthin  appears  to  have  discouraged  entrepreneurs  from  opening  new  routes  or  purchasing \nnew equipment.\n\nFor  example,  air  connectivity  between  the  regions  comprising  BIMP-EAGA  has  been \nnotoriously  poor.  Before  2006,  a  passenger  wishing  to  fly  from  Bandar  Seri  Bagawan \n(Brunei)  to  Pontianak  (Indonesia)  had  to  fly  via  Kota  Kinabalu  and  Kuching,  involving, \nsometimes  lengthy  stopovers  at  transfer  points.  Demand  for  flights  between  subregional \ncenters  was  thin  and  the  problem  was  exacerbated  by  the  employment  of  inappropriate \naircraft types by some airlines. \n\nIn 2006, member governments signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) designed to \nexpand  and  strengthen  air  services  within  BIMP-EAGA.  Under  the  MOU,  each  member \ncountry  agreed  to  allow  several  carriers  to  operate  on  given  routes.  The  agreement  also \nprovided  for  the  full  exchange  of  third  and  fourth  freedom  traffic  rights,  without  any \nrestrictions on capacity, frequency, and aircraft type. Further liberalization took place in 1999 \nand 2000. Brunei and Indonesia granted full fifth freedom rights in 1999 (Malaysia already \nfollowed  such  a  policy),  while  the  Philippines  granted  full  fifth  freedom  traffic  rights  within \nBIMP-EAGA to airlines designated by the participating countries. Fifth freedom traffic rights \nallow an air carrier domiciled in a member country to pick up traffic in another BIMP-EAGA \nmember country and carry it to a third member country as part of a service to and from the \nhome  country  of  the  airline.  For  example,  a  Malaysian  Airlines  flight  could  fly  from  Kota \nKinabalu to Bandar Seri Bagawan, pick up Brunei originating traffic, and carry it to Pontianak \n\n\f10 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nin Indonesia. Fifth freedom rights enable airlines greater freedom and flexibility in planning \nnetworks  in  regions  in  which  individual  routes  have  thin  traffic  flows,  potentially  enhancing \ncompetition  between  airlines.  In  the  example  above,  Malaysian  Airlines  could  find  itself \ncompeting against Royal Brunei Airlines and Indonesian carriers.\n\nOriginally,  each  BIMP-EAGA  transport  minister  designated  two  entry  points  to  be  granted \nfifth  freedom  rights.9  The  airports  designated  were  Banda  Seri  Bagawan  in  Brunei, \nBalikpapan and Pontianak in Indonesia, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching in Malaysia, and Davao \nand Zamboanga City in the Philippines. Fifth freedom rights were granted to other airports in \n2007: Manado and Tarakan in Indonesia, Labuan and Miri in Malaysia, and Puerto Princesa \nand General Santos City in the Philippines. \n\nThe adoption of fifth freedom rights offers a partial solution to the region\u2019s aviation problems. \nIt is encouraging to note that new entrants have begun services and airlines have introduced \nturboprop  rather  than  jet  aircraft.  For  example,  Asian  Spirit\u2014a  Philippine  domestic \ncarrier10\u2014began  flying  the  Zamboanga\u2013Sandakan  and  Zamboanga\u2013Jolo  routes  in  May \n2007. Similarly, Malaysian Airlines wholly owned subsidiary Firefly commenced services to \nand from destinations in East Malaysia and Indonesia in 2007, initially with a fleet of Fokker \n50 turboprops.\n\nAir  services  within  the  IMT-GT  subregion  are  also  considered  to  offer  inadequate \nconnectivity. For example, the lack of a direct service between Hat Yai in southern Thailand \nand  Medan  and  Banda  Aceh  in  Sumatra  (Songhkla\u2013Penang\u2013Medan  Corridor)  inhibit  the \ngrowth of trade and tourism.\n\nNew  entrants  offer  the  promise  of  improved  airline  services.  For  example,  in  2007  the \nMalaysian  Airways  owned  subsidiary  Firefly,  operating  from  a  base  in  Penang,  began \noperating  72-seat  Fokker  propjet  aircraft  on  routes  such  as  Penang\u2013Phuket  and  Penang\u2013\nKoh Samui. \n\nSee Table 9 on international aviation freedom of the air rights.\n\n5.4 Cabotage \n\nIn general, the domestic aviation markets of aSEA countries are reserved for airlines owned \nby citizens of the country in question. However, it is noted that several countries in the aSEA \nregion  have  deregulated  domestic  aviation.  For  example,  Indonesia  deregulated  domestic \naviation  in  1998.  Since  deregulation  the  sector  has  attracted  a  number  of  new  entrants. \nSimilarly, Thailand allows open access on all domestic routes and private carriers are free to \ncompete  with  Thai  Airways.  The  Philippines  has  also  liberalized  its  domestic  aviation \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n9   We note that Brunei has only one airport. \n10   Asian Spirit has changed hands and been renamed Zest Airways. \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  11 \n\n \n\n \n\nmarket.  Entry  and  exit  is  subject  to  policy  laid  out  in  Executive  Order  219  (1995).  This \nexecutive order envisages the progressive liberalization of the aviation industry in general. \n\n5.5 Airline Ownership \n\nUntil recently, national carriers played a pivotal role in the aSEA region. The largest of these \ncarriers\u2014Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Malaysian Airlines\u2014operate a web of intra-\nASEAN  services  and  extensive  networks  linking  Southeast  Asia  with  Europe,  the  Middle \nEast, Australasia, and North America. The dominance of these carriers appears to be under \nthreat as aviation markets are deregulated and competition intensifies.  \n\nSingapore Airlines  is  the  largest  regional  airline  and  the  world\u2019s  second-largest  carrier  by \nmarket  value.11  While  Singapore  Airlines  is  quoted  on  the  Singapore  Stock  Exchange, \nmajority  ownership  is  held  by  the  Singapore  Government  (56.83%)  operating  through \nTemasek Holdings. There are no current proposals for further privatization. Thai Airways is \nalso  majority  (92%)  owned  by  government,  although  further  privatization  is  envisaged. \nGaruda  Indonesian Airways  was  reorganized  in  1998  and  there  are  plans  to  privatize  the \nairline. The Philippines\u2019 national carrier Philippines Airways Ltd (PAL) was privatized in 1992. \nHowever,  following  the  1997 Asian  financial  crisis,  PAL  was  declared  bankrupt  and  forced \ninto reconstruction. Royal Brunei Airlines is an independent corporation wholly owned by the \nGovernment of Brunei Darussalam.\n\nPrivate  sector  carriers  compete  with  government-owned  airlines  in  a  number  of  ASEAN \ncountries. For example, Cebu Pacific, Zest Airways, and Southeast Asian Airlines compete \nwith  PAL  in  the  Philippines  domestic  market.  Similarly,  Andaman  Airways,  Bangkok  Air, \nOrient Air, PB Air, and Phuket Air compete with Thai Airways.  \n\nThe  international  airline  industry  is  currently  experiencing  a  period  of  merger  and \nacquisition.  Consolidation  has  taken  a  variety  of  forms.  For  example, Air  France  and  KLM \nRoyal  Dutch  Airlines  merged  in  2006  through  the  formation  of  a  new  holding  company. \nLufthansa, having successfully acquired Swiss International Airlines 3 years ago, is buying a \ncontrolling stake in Britain\u2019s BMI (formerly British Midland) and is also bidding for a minority \nstake  in  Austrian  Airlines.  In  turn,  Singapore  Airlines  formed  a  global  alliance  with  Virgin \nAtlantic  in  1999,  with  SIA  taking  a  49%  shareholding  in  Virgin  Atlantic.  The  partnership \nenables  the  carriers  to  code  share,  as  well  as  share  airport  lounges  and  frequent  flyer \nprograms  and  offer  joint  round-the-world  fares.  Such  industry  consolidation  appears  to  be \ndriven  by  liberalization  of  aviation  markets,  a  relaxation  of  regulations  relating  to  cross-\nborder investments in airlines, as well as the desire of governments to reduce their exposure \nto the aviation sector. Aviation industry experts argue that the industry is likely to experience \nfurther consolidation over the next few years.\n\naSEA  carriers  appear  likely  to  be  affected  by  industry  consolidation.  The  strongest  of  the \naSEA  national  carriers\u2014Singapore Airlines,  Malaysia Airlines,  and Thai Airways\u2014may  join \nthe race to consolidate. Weaker carriers may find survival difficult in this new environment. \n\n                                                           \n\n11   \"Singapore Airlines rocked by recession,\" Australian, 15 May 2009. \n\n\f12 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\n5.6 Code Sharing \n\nUnder  a  code-sharing  arrangement,  an  airline  provides  seats  to  a  code-share  partner(s), \nwhich  are  then  marketed  under  the  partner\u2019s  name.  Code  sharing  allows  airlines  to  offer \nmore frequent services than would be possible if their own aircraft operated all flights. It also \nenables  airlines  to  serve  a  market  without  having  to  operate  their  own  aircraft.  The  most \ncommon  types  of  code  sharing  are  \u201cblock  space\u201d  and  \u201cfree  flow.\u201d  Under  a  block-space \nagreement, the marketing carrier takes an agreed number of seats on designated flights for \nan agreed price and resells them, as if they were its own seats. The risk is transferred from \nthe  operating  carrier  to  the  marketing  carrier.  Under  a  free-flow  arrangement  there  is  no \nspecific allocation of seats. The marketing carrier sells, however, many seats that it can. The \nrisk  remains  with  the  operating  carrier  but  it  is  alleviated  by  the  marketing  efforts  of  the \nnonoperating carrier. \n\n5.7 Low-Cost Airlines \n\nSubstantial  changes  are  occurring  in  regional  aviation  markets  as  a  result  of  the  entry  of \nlow-cost  carriers.  The  first  mover  in  the  aSEA  region  was  the  Malaysian-based  Air  Asia, \nestablished  in  2001  to  serve  the  Malaysian  domestic  market.  In  2003,  Air  Asia  began \nservices to Bangkok and services to other regional destinations followed. By 2007 the airline \nwas carrying 7.7 million passengers. Its long-haul counterpart\u2014Air Asia X\u2014began services \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China and Australia in 2007 and London in March 2009.   \n\nThe  number  of  low-cost  airlines  has  grown  rapidly  over  the  past  5  years.  Based  in \nSingapore,  Tiger  Airways,  Jetstar  Asia,  and  Valuair  compete  in  regional  markets.  Tiger \nAirways,  in  which  Singapore  Airlines  has  a  49%  stake,  was  launched  in  2004.  Similarly, \nQantas set up Jetstar Asia by creating a joint venture structure with Singaporean investors. \nJetstar Asia later acquired the Singaporean low-cost operator Valuair. \n\nThailand\u2019s  low-cost  operators  include  Nok  Air  and  One  Two  Go.  The  Malaysian  low-cost \ncarrier AirAsia also competes in the Thai market through its Thai AirAsia joint venture with \nAsia Aviation Co. Ltd. The Government of Thailand lifted foreign ownership limits from 35% \nto  49%  to  allow AirAsia  to  enter  the  market.  Indonesian  low-cost  carriers  include  Mandala \nAirlines,  Batavia Air,  and  Lion Air.  These  airlines  compete  with  Indonesian AirAsia,  a  joint \nventure between Malaysia\u2019s AirAsia and local Indonesian investors. In the Philippines, Zest \nAirways  competes  with  SEA  Air,  a  Philippine  domestic  carrier  that  has  entered  into  a \ncommercial  and  operational  joint  venture  with  Tiger  Airways.  The  agreement  will  allow \nTiger\u2019s aircraft to operate in Philippine domestic and international markets. \n\nThe low-cost carrier business model is based on \n\n(cid:2)  Relatively narrow regional coverage (e.g., Southeast Asia), eliminating the need to pay \n\nhigh overseas allowances to crew; \n\n(cid:2)  A standardized fleet, usually of one type of aircraft, reducing crew training, maintenance \n\nand repair costs; \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  13 \n\n(cid:2)  Fast  turnaround  and  intensive  use  of  aircraft,  often  using  less-congested  secondary \n\nairports; \n\n(cid:2)  Higher seat density; \n\n(cid:2)  Minimal cabin service; \n\n(cid:2)  Extensive use of outsourcing; and \n\n(cid:2)  Booking through the internet, saving travel agents\u2019 commission.12\n\nAs a consequence of the growth of low-cost carriers, some routes in the intra-aSEA airline \nmarket  are  changing  rapidly.  Table  7  suggests  that  low-cost  carriers  have  already  had  a \nsignificant  impact  in  reducing  fares  across  the  aSEA  region.  Table  8  (page  38),  based  on \nresearch by Solis and Rodolfo, suggests that greater competition led to a substantial fall in \nairline revenue per seat-kilometer over 2003\u20132008. \n\nEntry  or  threat  of  entry  by  low-cost  (and  low-priced)  airlines  is  disturbing  the  competitive \nequilibrium across the region, threatening incumbent airlines and forcing them to adopt new \nstrategies.  The  growth  of  low-cost  carriers  will  introduce  competition  to  existing  routes \nwhose  growth  has  been  inhibited  by  full-service  airlines  seeking  to  maintain  high  yields. \nGreater  competition  will  also  encourage  both  low-cost  carriers  and  incumbent  airlines  to \ndevelop new routes, notably those linking secondary hubs. In the medium to long run, these \ntrends will substantially improve air connectivity in the aSEA region. \n\n5.8 Growth in Size and Range of Commercial Aircraft \n\nThe introduction of new types of aircraft (B777, B787, A340, A380), including aircraft such as \nthe A380  with  greatly  increased  carrying  capacity,  are  likely  to  reinforce  the  dominance  of \nregional hubs such as Singapore and Bangkok. Other things being equal, direct international \nflights  from  regional  airports  (Penang,  Kota  Kinabalu,  Brunei)  are  likely  to  be  replaced  by \nintensive services to and from the nearest hub airport.\n\nHowever,  the  ability  of  new  and  more  fuel-efficient  planes  to  carry  commercial  payloads \nfurther creates a potential counter-tendency. Aircraft such as the B777 and A380 are able to \nfly  long  distances  without  refueling,  enabling  them  to  overfly  existing  hubs.  For  example, \nnew  generation  aircraft  can  fly  directly  from  Australia  to  the  Middle  East,  cutting  out  the \ntraditional  stopovers  in  Singapore,  Bangkok,  and  Kuala  Lumpur.  It  is  unclear  at  this  time \nwhether Southeast Asian aviation hubs will experience declining demand as a result of the \nintroduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft types.  \n\n                                                           \n\n12   L.

Singapore: McGraw-Hill., p.25\u201326.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\n5.9 Charter Services \n\nIn general, aSEA countries have adopted relatively liberal policies toward charter flights. For \nexample, Brunei Darussalam views charter flights as a valuable supplement to passenger or \nfreight  services  during  times  of  peak  seasonal  or  temporary  demand.  Approved  charter \nservices  include  pilgrimage  flights  to  Jeddah.  The  Philippines  views  charter  flights  as  a \nvaluable  supplement  to  scheduled  services  at  times  of  peak  tourist  demand,  especially  in \nthe case of the more remote tourist destinations.\n\nIndonesia liberalized its stance relating to charter flights in 1996, opening up all its gateway \nairports to charter flights. Similarly, Malaysia has a liberal approach to charter applications, \nreadily  approving  the  application  of  operators,  while  Thailand  allows  any  charter  to  any \ninternational  market.  By  comparison,  Singapore  sounds  a  more  cautionary  note.  Although \nSingapore has a moderately liberal approach to air charters, they are relatively uncommon. \nApprovals  for  charters,  which  do  not  compete  with  scheduled  services,  can  be  obtained \nfreely, though the approval process is said to be relatively slow.13\n\n5.10 Air Freight Services\n\nAs  mentioned  earlier,  a  close  relationship  exists  between  trends  in  the  airline  passenger \nservices and trends in air freight. Put in another way, the volume of air freight has tended to \nexpand pari passu with the growth of scheduled passenger services. Where the volume of \nair  freight  exceeds  the  capacity  of  scheduled  passenger  services  or  where  shippers  offer \nlarge  volumes  of  perishable  or  other  cargoes  capable  of  paying  a  sustainable  freight  rate, \nspecialist air cargo operators may find it worthwhile to introduce dedicated freight aircraft. In \ngeneral, countries in aSEA have adopted liberal air freight policies. Several aSEA countries \nhave  entered  into  bilateral  or  multilateral  open  skies  agreements relating to air freight. For \nexample,  Malaysia  has  open  skies  air  cargo  agreements  with  Germany  and  the \nNetherlands,  while  under  a  1995  agreement,  airlines  have  unlimited  air  freight  rights \nbetween the Philippines and the US. \n\nIndonesia  and  Thailand  also  follow  liberal  policies  toward  air  freight,  while  Brunei \nDarussalam allows dedicated air freight operators to serve its market. As might be expected \ngiven its role as a freight hub, Singapore has adopted a liberal policy toward air freight. \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n13   See Monash International Pty.

Aviation Infrastructure: Capabilities and \nConstraints\n\nAirlines depend on the services provided by aviation-related infrastructure, such as runways, \nhard stand, passenger and freight terminals, and cargo-handling equipment, as well as other \nforms  of  infrastructure  such  as  telecommunications  and  information  systems.  While  high \nquality aviation infrastructure can give an airport a competitive advantage (e.g., Singapore), \nthe lack of appropriate infrastructure or the inefficient operation of existing infrastructure may \nact as a constraint on the development of air transport (e.g., Pontianak, Dili). \n\n6.1 Major Hub Airports \n\nThe region\u2019s major hub airports (Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok) operate efficiently \nby  world  standards,  invest  heavily  to  ensure  their  facilities  are  adequate,  and  compete \nstrongly for customers. \n\nSingapore\u2019s  Changi  Airport  is  the  region\u2019s  major  hub,  served  by  airlines  operating \nintercontinental, intra-Asian, and intra-aSEA services. Following a S$240 million upgrade to \nTerminal  2  in  2006,  the  new  S$2.75  billion  Terminal  3  was  opened  in  January  2008, \nincreasing  Changi\u2019s  capacity  to  64  million  passengers  a  year.  A  budget  terminal,  with \ncapacity for 2.7 million passengers a year, opened in March 2006. The airport\u2019s operational \nefficiency is generally considered to be world class, with the Government of Singapore and \nthe  airport  authority  seeking  to  upgrade  facilities  as  and  when  necessary  to  preserve \nSingapore\u2019s competitive advantage.14 The airport\u2019s charges are among the lowest in Asia. \n\nOver  the  past  15  years,  Malaysia  has  been  aggressively  developing  the  infrastructure \nnecessary  to  support  its  relatively  high  rate  of  economic  growth.  The  government  has  set \nout to develop KLIA as a regional hub for passengers and cargo. The need for KLIA arose \nas  a  result  of  the  14%\u201315%  growth  of  passenger  traffic  through  the  former  Subang \nInternational Airport in the early 1990s. By 1995, Subang had reached its design capacity of \n5,500 passenger movements an hour. The first stage of KLIA was completed in June 1998 \ngiving the airport the capacity to handle 25 million passengers and 1.2 million tons of cargo \na year. A low-cost carrier terminal, constructed in 2005, has the capacity to handle 10 million \npassengers  a  year.  In  2008  the  Government  of  Malaysia  announced  its  intention  to \nconstruct  a  new  low-cost  carrier  terminal  by  2012  with  a  planned  capacity  of  25  million \n\n                                                           \n\n14   Singapore faces competition from Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in its role as a major regional hub. Locally, \nSenai Airport, located across the causeway in the Malaysian state of Johor and accessible by many residents in \nthe northern and western parts of Singapore Island, competes for regional short-haul traffic. \n\n\f16 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\npassengers a year. KLIA has sufficient land to build facilities capable of handling 100 million \npassengers and 5 million tons of cargo annually. \n\nThailand\u2019s  favorable  geographic  position  and  liberal  aviation  policies  have  enabled  the \ndevelopment  of  one  of  Asia\u2019s  most  important  aviation  hubs  at  Bangkok,  despite  the \ninfrastructural  limitations  of  the  former  Don  Muang  Airport.  Don  Muang  suffered  from  a \nseriously  inadequate  terminal  as  well  as  being  slot  constrained  during  the  airport\u2019s  peak \nhours  between  2200  and  0130.  Thailand  opened  Suvamabhumi  International  Airport  in \n2006,  at  a  cost  of  $3  billion  and  a  capacity  of  45  million  passengers  a  year.  A  planned \nbudget  terminal  will  extend  capacity  by  17  million  a  year.  Reportedly  the  airport  will \neventually cater for 100 million passengers and 3 million tons of air cargo a year. \n\nIn  summary,  the  region\u2019s  major  hub  airports  (Changi  Airport,  KLIA,  and  Suvamabhumi \nInternational  Airport)  are  efficient  by  world  standards,  compete  strongly  to  attract  transit \ntraffic, and invest heavily to maintain their competitive position. \n\n6.2 Other Major Airports \n\nThe  region\u2019s  other  major  airports  (including  Brunei  International  Airport  (BIA),  Soekarno\u2013\nHatta Airport in Jakarta, and Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila) suffer in various \nways when compared to the major hub airports. BIA is a relatively small airport with current \ncapacity to handle 2.2 million passengers. While there are no current restrictions regarding \nlanding  or  take-off  slots,  terminal  and  transfer  facilities  are  said  to  be  inadequate  for  the \nairport\u2019s projected growth. The government plans to develop BIA as a regional hub, focusing \nespecially  on  the  potential  market  within  BIMP-EAGA.  There  are  plans  to  lift  terminal \ncapacity in four stages, ultimately catering to 4.4 million passengers a year.15\n\nOver  95%  of  the  Philippines\u2019  international  airline  traffic  is  handled  by  the  Ninoy  Aquino \nInternational Airport (NAIA) in Manila. Although the airport has had no slot restrictions, until \nrecently, NAIA was constrained by inadequate facilities for transit and transfer passengers. \nSuch infrastructure constraints detracted from the Philippine Government\u2019s drive to become \nan  Asian  hub.  While  a  new  international  terminal  was  built  in  2003,  its  full  operation  was \ndelayed  for  some  years  due  to  investigations  into  its  contract,  which  granted  monopoly \nrights for ground-handling and catering services to one of the partners in the build-operate-\ntransfer contract. \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n15  \nThe Government of Brunei Darussalam has encouraged private sector participation in developing the BIA \nthrough the granting of pioneer status. A company granted a pioneer certificate will be exempt from corporate tax \nfor  a  period  ranging  from  2  to  5  years.  Such  companies  will  also  be  exempted  from  customs  duty on imported \nmachinery and equipment and raw materials. See www.brunet.bn/gov/dca/services:htm\n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  17 \n\n \n\nIn PNG, Jacksons Airport (Port Moresby) is the only airport regularly served by international \ncarriers.  It  has  two  runways  (2,750  meters  [m]  and  2,072  m  in  length),  two  passenger \nterminals (international and domestic), and one aircraft stand. The facilities are adequate to \ncater  to  the  limited  international  flights  currently  operated  but  will  need  to  be  expanded \nshould PNG economic growth accelerate in the future.\n\nIn  Timor-Leste, Presidente  Nicolau  Lobato  (Dili)  International  Airport  is  run  by  the  Civil \nAviation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport,  Communication  and  Public  Works.  Facilities \nare  said  to  be  basic.  The  existing  1,850  meter  runway,  which  was  repaved  in  2005,  is \ncapable of accommodating B727 and A319 aircraft. The government plans to begin work on \na runway extension in 2009 to accommodate B757 and similar aircraft. The improvements \nwill be funded by royalty income from oil and gas deposits. \n\n6.3 Regional Airports \n\nIn some aSEA economies, deficiencies in regional aviation infrastructure act as a constraint \non  the  efficient  development  of  air  services.  For  example,  some  regional  airports  in \nIndonesia  are  unable  to  accommodate  aircraft  types  operated  by  foreign  airlines  (e.g., \nPontianak) while others lack adequate terminal facilities (Medan). Runway length and width \nmay also constrain air services. Investment in facilities is also required at secondary airports \nin  the  Philippines.  Terminal  facilities  are  said  to  be  inadequate  at  the  Davao  International \nAirport where the opening of the new terminal has been delayed due to technical problems. \nInvestment is also required at secondary gateways such as Clark and Laoag. \n\nSimilarly,  a  shortage  of  skilled  management  and  labor  may  constrain  the  growth  of  the \naviation  industry.  Airline  operations  rely  on  a  range  of  highly  skilled  employees,  such  as \nexperienced managers and information technology professionals. In some countries, these \nskills  are  in  short  supply.  In  particular,  managers  with  experience  of  the  aviation  industry \nmay  not  be  readily  available.  This  will  hinder  the  development  of  airlines  and  aviation \ninfrastructure. While these skills can be obtained from hiring staff from other countries, this \ncan be expensive and it can erode the competitive base of the airlines.\n\nAttempts  are  being  made  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  regional  airports  by  various  aSEA \ngovernments.  The  Government  of  Malaysia  is  committed  to  improve  the  accessibility  and \nservices  provided  by  regional  airports  such  as  Penang,  Langkawi,  Kuching,  and  Kota \nKinabalu to support regional growth and development. Langkawi Airport (Kedah), serving a \nmajor  holiday  destination,  has  been  recently  redeveloped.  The  existing  terminal  has  been \nextended and refurbished and a runway built capable of handling B747 aircraft. The airport \nis now able to handle 2.5 million passengers a year and has the ability to handle up to 1,000 \npassengers per hour in peak periods. \n\nThe ownership structure of Indonesian regional airports is being overhauled in an attempt to \nmake them more efficient. Until recently, Indonesia\u2019s regional airports were operated by two \nstate-owned  enterprises:  Angkasa  Pura  1  managed  airports  in  Eastern  Indonesia  while \nairports in Western Indonesia were managed by Angkasa Pura 2. The recent devolution of \n\n\f18 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\npower  from  the  central  to  provincial  governments  has  seen  provincial  governments  take \ncontrol of some regional airports. Privatization of some airports has also occurred. \n\nIn  the  Philippines,  the  government  intends  to  divert  traffic  from  Manila  to  regional  airports \nsuch  as  Cebu,  Davao,  Subic,  Clark,  and  Laoag  by  encouraging  foreign  airlines  to  provide \nservices to these destinations. However, flights by foreign airlines to regional airports count \ntoward  their  entitlements  as  set  as  in  the  relevant  air  service  agreements  (ASAs).  An \nalternative  policy  might  create  additional  traffic  rights  for  airlines  willing  to  fly  to  regional \nairports. \n\n7. Aviation Policy: Pressures for Reform \n\nGlobally,  aviation  markets  have  significantly  changed  since  the  late  1980s.  The  industry, \nhistorically subject to close regulation, has benefited from market liberalization, privatization, \nand a relaxation of restrictive ownership rules. The recent emphasis on the benefits flowing \nfrom liberalization, especially for tourism and regional development, has encouraged policy \nmakers to take a new, more open approach to aviation regulation. Deregulation has driven \nchange in the Southeast Asian aviation industry since the 1990s.  \n\n7.1 Aviation Policy Objectives \n\nNational aviation policies reflect varying national objectives and differences in the resource \nendowments of individual aSEA countries. Not only do the objectives of aviation policy differ \nbut  the  sophistication  of  the  policies  adopted  and  the  ability  to  implement  them  effectively \nalso  differ  across  aSEA  countries.  In  general,  the  more  developed  aSEA  countries  have \nclear  policy  objectives  and  well-developed  policies  for  the  aviation  sector.  For  example, \nSingapore\u2019s  aviation  policy  focuses  on  the  promotion  of  Singapore  as  an  aviation  hub. \nSuccess depends on Singapore adopting liberal aviation policies to attract airlines to serve it \nrather  than  competing  destinations.  In  contrast,  PNG\u2019s  rudimentary  aviation  policy  merely \nattempts to ensure that the country has links to key trading partners. \n\nHistorically,  international  aviation  has  been  a  highly  regulated  industry.  International \nagreement  on  the  rights  of  airlines  domiciled  in  country  A  to  offer  air  services  across  the \nterritories  of  countries  B,  C,  and  D  was  made  necessary  by  the  1919  Paris  Convention \nwhich gave complete and absolute sovereignty to each nation over the air space above its \nterritory. Modern attempts to reach a multilateral agreement covering traffic rights date from \nthe Chicago Conference of 1944. At Chicago the concept of \u201dfreedom\u201d (or transit privilege) \nwas defined as a key principle of air law. Essentially these freedoms (Table 8) are agreed \nlimitations on the provision of international air services. \n\nSince  the  1980s,  the  international  aviation  industry  has  been  partially  deregulated.  This  is \noften  referred  to  as  a  move  toward  \"open  sky,\"  which  may  be  pursued  on  a  bilateral, \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  19 \n\n \n\n \n\nregional,  or  multilateral  basis.  Open  sky  policies  usually  incorporate  multiple  (rather  than \nsingle) airline designation, removal of capacity controls on a given route(s), or the removal \nof price controls.16\n\n7.2 Airline Ownership \n\nCountries in aSEA differ in their policies regarding ownership and control. For example, an \nairline  registered  in  Brunei  Darussalam  must  be  substantially  owned  and  effectively \ncontrolled  by  Brunei  interests,  while  Malaysia  reserves  51%  ownership  for  Malaysian \nnationals  and  the  Philippine  Constitution  provides  for  60%  ownership  by  Filipinos  and \neffective Filipino management and control. \n\nPrivately  owned  carriers  compete  with  government-owned  airlines \nin  some  aSEA \neconomies,  primarily  on domestic and intra-ASEAN routes. For example, Malaysian-based \nAir  Asia  offers  services  to  a  number  of  Southeast  and  East  Asian  destinations.  Similarly, \nBangkok Air is active on routes to neighboring ASEAN countries. As noted above, low-cost \ncarriers  such  as Air Asia,  Jetstar Asia,  and  Valuair  have  expanded  their  range  of  services \nsince 2004. \n\n7.3 Air Service Agreements \n\nBilateral arrangements, commonly referred to as air service agreements (ASAs), remain the \nmost common form of airline regulation among aSEA states. Paralleling ASEAN initiatives to \nmove toward open sky, the more developed ASEAN economies are entering into new ASAs \nhaving  open  sky  characteristics.  Malaysia  has  open  skies  agreements  with  the  US; \nTaipei,China; New Zealand; Austria; Luxembourg; and Lebanon. Further, several countries \nhave  exchanged  fifth  freedom  rights,  while  Thailand  has  granted  extensive  fifth  freedom \nrights to encourage the development of an aviation hub at Bangkok. \n\nThere  have  been  broader  regional  movements  toward  open  sky,  most  notably  the \nMultilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of International Air Transport (MALIAT) between \nBrunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and the US. MALIAT entered into force \nin  December  2001.  The  key  features  of  the  agreement  are  (i)  open  routes, (ii) open traffic \nrights,  (iii)  no  capacity  limits,  (iv)  multiple  airline  designation,  and  (v)  code-sharing \nprovisions. Aviation liberalization policies were also adopted in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. \n\nWhereas  ASAs  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  typically  designated  a  single  airline  from  each \nparticipating  country  to  serve  a  given  route,  more  recent,  liberalized  ASAs  allow  multiple \nairline  designation.  For  example,  Brunei  Darussalam  allows  either  double  or  multiple \ndesignation  where  the  other  party  agrees  to  reciprocal  rights.  Similarly,  most  active \nIndonesian ASAs allow for multiple designation of airlines. \n\n                                                           \n\n16   B. Solis and C.L.S. Rodolfo. 2008. ASEAN Community and Philippine Developments. November. \n\n\f20 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nBefore 1990, bilateral ASAs usually specified which gateways or airports had to be used by \nairlines operating international routes. Recent liberalized ASAs permit airlines to choose the \ngateways they wish to serve. Some aSEA economies operate a multiple gateway policy. For \nexample, most Indonesian ASAs include separate traffic rights to holiday gateways such as \nDenpasar (Bali), while airlines from nations signing open sky agreements with Malaysia are \nfree  to  operate  into  any  or  all  of  the  country\u2019s  six  international  gateways.  Other  aSEA \ncountries  encourage  foreign  airlines  to  serve  secondary  gateways.  For  example,  the \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  encourages  foreign  airlines  to  call  at  Cebu  and  Davao  to \npromote tourism. \n\n7.4 Airline Cooperative Agreements \n\nIn general, the ASEAN members of aSEA allow their national airlines to join airline alliances. \nSingapore Airlines and Thai Airways are members of the Star Alliance. Similarly, a number \nof  Brunei  Darussalam\u2019s  ASAs  allow  airline  cooperative  arrangements,  including  code \nsharing, while Malaysia and Indonesia have approved Malaysia Airlines and Garuda\u2019s third \ncountry  code-sharing  services  to  Australia,  Germany,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  PNG  has \nallowed Qantas and Air New Guinea to enter into cooperative working arrangements on the \nAustralia\u2013PNG route. To date there has been no need for Timor-Leste to take a stance on \nairline cooperative agreements. \n\n7.5 Air Freight and Air Charter Policies \n\nASEAN members of aSEA have adopted relatively liberal policies regarding air freight and \nthe operation of air charters. Brunei Darussalam permits dedicated air freight services, while \nMalaysia  has  signed  bilateral  open  skies  cargo  agreements  with  Germany  and  the \nNetherlands. Similarly, Brunei Darussalam values charter operations as a means of meeting \nseasonal or temporary demands for the carriage of passengers and freight (e.g., pilgrims to \nand from the Middle East). However, some countries such as the Philippines are concerned \nthat charter flights may divert traffic away from scheduled airline services.\n\n7.6 Toward Open Skies: ASEAN Initiatives \n\nThe relatively high rates of Asian economic growth in the 1990s, coupled with the prevailing \nphilosophy  favoring  the  liberalization  of  trade  in  goods  and  services,  encouraged ASEAN \ngovernments to liberalize their domestic and international aviation sectors. However, ASEAN \nas an institution was a relatively late convert to the benefits of airline liberalization. While the \nASEAN Framework Agreement on Services created opportunities to lower barriers to trade \nin services, the agreement did not include the aviation sector. \n\nThe  ASEAN  leaders\u2019  summit  held  in  Bali  in  October  2003  agreed  to  accelerate  trade \nliberalization in 11 priority sectors, 8 involving trade in goods and 3 concerning services. Air \ntravel  was  selected  as  1  of  the  11  priority  sectors.  The  commitment  to  the  accelerated \nliberalization of the priority sectors was acknowledged in the ASEAN Framework Agreement \nfor  the  Integration  of  the  Priority  Sectors  (2004).  Of  relevance  to  this  study,  Article  10 \n(Logistics  Services)  of  this  agreement  commits  ASEAN  governments  to  support  transport \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  21 \n\n \n\n \n\nsector liberalization by strengthening intra-ASEAN maritime and shipping transport services, \nand by achieving better interconnectivity, interoperability, and intermodality with the national, \nregional, and international maritime and air transport gateways.\n\nSector  road  maps  were  prepared  for  each  priority  sector,  the  aviation  road  map  being \nadopted  by  ASEAN  member  states  in  November  2004.  Under  the  aviation  road  map, \nliberalization  was  to  start  in  2008.  Separate  agreements  deal  with  international  air  freight \nand international passenger services. The liberalization process for air freight began with the \n2002  MOU  on  air  freight  services.  Under  the  MOU  contracting  parties  agree  to  allow  the \nofficial carriers of other contracting parties to provide international freight services. The MOU \nprovides  for  the  rights  to  fly  across  each  other\u2019s  territory  without  landing  (first  freedom \ntraffic),  as  well  as  second,  third,  fourth,  and  fifth  freedom  rights  within  the  region.17 At  the \n12th ASEAN Transport Ministers meeting in 2007, a protocol was adopted allowing national \ncarriers  to  operate  all-cargo  services  with  a  capacity  limit  of  250  tons  weekly  in  each \ndirection on a given route, with no limitations on frequency or aircraft type.18\n\nCritics  have  noted  that  the  ASEAN  initiatives  have  been  slow  to  gain  traction.  However, \nunder  the  Multilateral  Agreement  on  Air  Services,  contracting  parties  will  extend  second, \nthird, fourth, and fifth freedom rights for passenger services to carriers of other contracting \nparties.  Full  liberalization  of  third  and  fourth  freedom  rights  between ASEAN  capital  cities \nwas introduced on 31 December 2008. This is to be followed by the full liberalization of fifth \nfreedom  traffic  rights  between ASEAN  capital  cities  by 31 December 2010. At present, the \ndeclared ASEAN goal is full liberalization of international air services by 2015.  \n\nASEAN members differ in their commitment to the Multilateral Agreement on Air Services. It \nseems likely that four countries\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand\u2014\nwill  adopt  full  liberalization  according  to  the  above  timetable.  Other  ASEAN  members, \nnotably  Indonesia,  continue  to  employ  selective  protectionist  policies.  For  example,  until \nrecently Indonesia protected Garuda by refusing to allow Singapore-based low-cost carriers \nto offer services to its four main cities, including Jakarta. \n\nAssuming  that  the  momentum  toward  open  sky  policies  is  maintained  within  the  aSEA \nregion, some or all of the following policies are likely to be adopted over the next decade: \n\nliberalization of bilateral agreements and/or the broadening of subregional cooperation; \n\n(cid:2) \n\n(cid:2) \n\nthe opening up of secondary gateways; \n\n(cid:2)  a relaxation of ownership and investment rules; \n\n(cid:2)  ending of noncompetitive code-sharing agreements; \n                                                           \n\n17   The second freedom grants the right to stop in a country for refueling or maintenance on the way to another \ndestination,  without  transferring  passengers  or  cargo.  Third  and  fourth  freedom  rights  enable  carriers  to  carry \npassengers and cargo between each other\u2019s territory, while fifth freedom rights allow connecting flights to a third \ncountry. \n18   See ASEAN, Twelfth ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting, Bangkok, 8 February 2007. \n\n\f22 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\n(cid:2) \n\nliberalization  of  policy  stance  relating  to  aviation  service  markets  (ground  handling, \nfreight forwarding, computer reservation systems); and \n\n(cid:2)  agreements to liberalize aviation markets between aSEA states and the outside world.19\n\n8. Conclusion \n\nDespite  the  region's  attempts  at  reform,  aviation  markets  are  subject  to  more  detailed \neconomic regulation than shipping markets and the regulation of the aviation industry acts to \nprevent  adjustments  taking  place  when  external  conditions  change.  In  this  light,  policy \nrecommendations  in  this  paper  will  therefore  focus  on  ways  of  creating  the  freedom \nnecessary to develop competitive aviation markets. Ideally, governments should develop a \nregulatory regime conducive to the growth and development of an efficient aviation industry. \nThis  would  imply  the  creation  of  more  competitive  aviation  markets,  encouraging  the \nindustry to be more responsive to changes in consumer needs and changing technology. In \ngeneral, governments should consider moving toward open sky policies. \n\nHowever, the term \"open sky\" is open to interpretation. It could imply the creation of a single \naviation market across the aSEA region, analogous to the European aviation market. Given \nthe differing objectives and constraints facing the various countries in aSEA, such a market \nmight  allow  different  rates  of  progress  by  individual  countries.  Alternatively,  an  open  sky \npolicy might allow freedom of route choice by aSEA domiciled airlines, while restricting the \nability of non-aSEA airlines to serve intra-aSEA routes.\n\nThe movement toward open sky policies in the aSEA region is unlikely to take place in one \ndramatic  \"big  bang.\"  It  is  more  likely  be  a  gradual  process  involving  the  liberalization  of \nASAs,  a  relaxation  of  ownership  and  investment  rules,  and  a  freeing  up  of  regulations \nrelating  to  aviation  service  markets.  Hence,  this  paper  suggests  the  following  policy \nrecommendations:\n\ni) Further liberalize ASAs \n\nThis might take on any of the following forms:   \n\nDual or Multiple Designation \u2013 Competition is limited when there are only two airlines on a \ngiven  route,  one  from  each  country  (single  designation).  One  way  to  liberalize  aviation \nmarkets is to allow two airlines from each country (dual designation) to operate on a route. \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n19   See  B.  Solis  and  C.L.S.  Rodolfo,  ASEAN  Aviation  Community  and  Philippine  Development,  November \n2008.\n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  23 \n\n \n\nAlternatively,  all  restrictions  could  be  removed  on  the  number  of  airlines  serving  a  given \nroute  (multiple  designation),  allowing  individual  airlines  themselves  to  determine  whether \nthere are profitable opportunities on the route in question.  \n\nChoice of Gateways \u2013 Most ASAs specify which airport gateways must be used by airlines \noperating  international  routes.  Modest  liberalization  is  possible  by  permitting  airlines  to \nchoose  which  gateways  they  wish  to  use.  The  use  of  secondary  gateways  may  relieve \npressure  on  the  main  international  airport(s).  Where  a  secondary  gateway  serves  tourist \ndestinations,  the  tourist  industry  and  regional  development  may  benefit.  The  use  of \nsecondary gateways may be encouraged by ensuring that airlines serving regional airports \ndo not incur a penalty so far as metropolitan access is concerned.\n\nAbolition  of  Capacity  Controls  \u2013  Many  aviation  routes  still  have  controls  on  the  total \nallowable capacity on a route, and/or on the capacity to be offered by individual airlines. The \ntype  of  aircraft  to  be  used  may  also  be  specified.  Typically,  capacity  controls  involve  the \nselection  of  a  benchmark  type  of  aircraft  (e.g.,  B767).  Allowable  capacity  on  the  route  will \nthen be measured in terms of the number of B767 flights per week. Such controls prevent \neffective  competition  between  airlines.  The  removal  of  capacity  controls  is  a  common \nfeature of open skies regimes.\n\nCharter Flights \u2013 Charter flights are commonly used to promote tourism in Europe, the US, \nand Australia. The benefits and costs experienced by stakeholders helped them prepare for \nthe deregulation of scheduled services. Many open skies agreements permit charter flights \nwith restrictions to certain destinations.\n\nAir  Cargo  \u2013  Most countries have a more flexible approach to air cargo than to passenger \ncarriage. Cargo is less sensitive to \u201cnational identity\u201d than passengers. Some countries have \nliberalized  their  cargo  sectors  first,  de-linking  air  cargo  from  passenger  services, removing \nrestrictions on gateways, and lifting restrictions on third, fourth, and fifth freedom capacity.\n\nii) Relax Ownership and Investment Rules \n\nRelaxation  of  ownership  and  investment  rules  could  lead  to  a  more  competitive  airline \nindustry.  Policy  changes,  which  could  lead  to  a  more  dynamic  industry,  include  the \nprivatization  of  government-owned  airlines  and  the  removal  of  barriers  preventing  foreign \ncarriers offering services on international routes. \n\nPrivatization  of  National  Carriers  \u2013  The  removal  or  minimization  of  direct  government \ninvolvement in the ownership and operation of air services would lower barriers to change \nwithin the aviation industry and free up scarce capital for aviation infrastructure.\n\nBarriers to Entry \u2013 Many ASAs contain clauses specifying the countries whose airlines are \npermitted to operate on a given route or routes. Thus, \u201cnationality,\u201d usually defined in terms \nof  ownership  and/or  effective  control,  determines  which  airlines  may  offer  services  on \ndesignated routes. Such restrictions limit the ability of foreign airlines to invest in overseas \n\n\f24 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nmarkets.  While  these  requirements  tend  to  become  less  onerous  as  open  skies \narrangements spread, some countries still impose rigorous ownership requirements. There \nare  a  number  of  ways  in  which  onerous  nationality  requirements  might  be  liberalized.  For \nexample,  countries  in  the  aSEA  region  might  agree  that  any  airline  majority  owned  or \neffectively  controlled  by  nationals  of  any  aSEA  country  would  be  free  to  operate  on  any \nintra-aSEA route. \n\niii) Liberalize Regulations relating to Aviation Service Markets  \n\nHistorically,  a  number  of  aSEA  countries  have  put  in  place  restrictions  relating  to  the \nprovision  of  ground  handling  and  other  aviation-related  services.  For  example,  the  build-\noperate-transfer  contract  for  the  new  Terminal  3  in  Manila  required  airlines  to  use  the \nservices  of  monopoly  suppliers  of  catering  and  ground-handling  services.  Under  a \nliberalized  regime,  airlines  should  be  free  to  choose  their  own  operators.  aSEA  countries \nmight  allow  firms  from  other  aSEA  countries  to  handle  these  services  in  their  airports. \nAlternatively, ground-handling services might be opened to any operator. \n\nOpening up the market for ground-handling services to greater competition will lead to lower \nground-handling charges, hence, lower operating costs for airlines, and improved quality of \nhandling  services.  Consumers  should  benefit  from  better  quality  of  services  if  competition \nensures that airlines pass on the part of the cost savings to them. \n\nRemoval  of  other  restrictions  relating  to  aviation  service  markets  (e.g.,  restrictions  on  the \nemployment  of  foreign  airline  personnel,  rules  relating  to  the  remittance  of  earnings,  and \nrestrictions  regarding  computer  reservation  systems)  will  have  a  similar  effect.  If  decisions \nare  based  on  commercial  rather  than  political  considerations,  airlines  will  become  more \nefficient  in  their  operations  in  all  parts  of  their  network.  Consumers  will  benefit  from  better \nquality of services. \n\niv) End Noncompetitive Code-Sharing Arrangements \n\nThe danger of code sharing, when there are only two carriers on a route, is that competition \nis  diminished.  There  is  a  strong  case  for  outlawing  code  sharing  on  grounds  that  it \ndiminishes  competition.  However,  code  sharing  between  carriers  may  be  more  acceptable \non routes in which there is extensive fifth freedom competition (e.g., Bangkok \u2013 Singapore). \n\nDeepen Subregional Cooperation (BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT)\n\nAir  connectivity  in  the  BIMP-EAGA  has  been  notoriously  poor.  While  the  BIMP-EAGA \naviation agreements relate to regional, secondary, and tertiary aviation services, they have \nbeen perceived as being relatively ineffective.\n\nThe full exchange of third and fourth freedom rights as well as the general adoption of fifth \nfreedom rights offers a partial solution to the region\u2019s aviation problems. Fifth freedom rights \nallow an air carrier domiciled in a member country to pick up traffic in another BIMP-EAGA \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  25 \n\n \n\nmember country and carry it to a third member country as part of a service to and from the \nhome country of the airline. It is encouraging to note that new entrants have begun services \nand airlines have introduced turboprop rather than jet aircraft. \n\nGiven  the  thin  traffic  on  BIMP-EAGA  routes,  code  sharing  or  even  joint  service  provision \nmay  be  necessary  to  create  the  required  connectivity.  Third-country  code  sharing  would \nseem  to  be  appropriate  to  build  initial  linkages.  As  and  when  traffic  has  built  to  an \nappropriate  level  (most  probably  a  daily  service  on  a  given  route),  any  increase  in  service \nlevels  should  be  allocated  in  a  way  that  reduces  the  anticompetitive  element  inherent  in \ncode shares and joint services. \n\nv) Consider Modifying or Abolishing Cabotage Restrictions \n\nAs noted above, the domestic aviation markets of aSEA countries are generally reserved for \nairlines  domiciled  in  the  home  state,  although  several  countries  have  deregulated  their \ndomestic aviation markets. However, foreign investors are already able to invest in domestic \naviation  in  certain  aSEA  countries.  For  example,  foreign  participation  is  allowed  in  the \nPhilippines  but  is  limited  by  the  60%  domestic\u201340%  foreign  participation  provision  of  the \nConstitution.\n\nIt  was  found  that  some  open  skies  agreements  permit  airlines  from  other  countries  to \noperate domestic services. For example, under current arrangements, the Singapore-owned \nTiger  Airways  is  allowed  to  operate  domestic  services  in  Australia.20  However, many open \nskies agreement do not allow entry in domestic aviation markets.\n\nPotential  gains  are  available  if  foreign  airlines  are  permitted  to  operate  domestically. \nOpening up entry in this way could lead to greater competition, better connections between \ndomestic and foreign routes, and lower fares. Tourism would benefit from seamless travel. \nHowever,  there  are  potential  drawbacks.  Opening  up  domestic  routes  to  foreign  carriers \nmight undermine the viability of domestic carriers.\n\nvi) Subsidies Services on \u201cThin\u201d Regional and/or Domestic Routes\n\nWhile the primary role of government is to facilitate aviation outcomes that are commercially \ndriven or are likely to prove commercially viable in the long run, there may be cases in which \ngovernment intervention is necessary to provide a service to regional communities. In cases \nin which governments wish to ensure that there are adequate airline services on long, thin \nroutes (including regional and domestic), which are marginal or unlikely to be economically \nself-sustaining in the long run, there is a case for subsidizing airlines. \n\n                                                           \n\n \n20  \nIt was found that while Tiger Airways is not allowed to fly international routes from a base in Australia, it is \nallowed (as a Singaporean airline) to fly to and from Australia from its Singapore base. This leads to the bizarre \nsituation  in  which  Tiger  Airways  can  fly  a  Singapore-based  aircraft  from,  for  example,  the  Singapore\u2013Perth\u2013\nSingapore route but cannot fly a Perth-based aircraft for the Perth\u2013Singapore\u2013Perth route.\n\n\f26 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nSubsidy payments should be tied to clearly defined objectives and should be justified within \nthe framework of a comprehensive transport policy. They should be transparent and subject \nto  regular  review.  There  has  been  a  tendency  for  governments  to  seek  value  for  taxpayer \nfunds  by  putting  out  subsidized  service  to  tender.  Wherever  practical,  subsidies  should be \nawarded  based  an  open  and  competitive  tendering  process.  Tender  periods  should  be  of \nlimited duration.\n\nvii) Create Regional Sinking Fund to Finance Airport Improvements \n\nWhile  the  region\u2019s  major  international  airports  operate  efficiently  by  world  standards  and \nsome  regional  airports  operate  relatively  efficiently,  many  regional  and  most  local  airports \nsuffer  from  lack  of  funding  and  facilities.  Since  the  benefits  of  aviation  liberalization  are \ndependent  on  the  existence  of  efficient  infrastructure\u2014including  airports  and  regulatory \nsystems\u2014there  is  a  case  for  providing  national  or  regional  revolving  funds  to  finance \nimprovements to local and regional airports. \n\nLiberalization  of  aviation  markets  can  create  direct  and  indirect  benefits  and  costs.  The \ndirect benefits and costs from liberalization will be experienced by \n\n(cid:2)  passengers, who should gain from lower fares and better services;  \n\n(cid:2)  airlines, which will lose out from lower fares but benefit from lower costs and access to \n\nnew markets; and \n\n(cid:2) \n\nthe  tourism  sector,  which  will  gain  from  the  stimulus  provided  by  lower  airfares  and \nbetter  services.  But  outbound  tourism  will  also  increase  in  the  more  developed  aSEA \neconomies and some countries may lose from this effect. \n\naSEA  countries  are  expected  to  experience  a  range  of  indirect  impacts,  which  may  be \npositive  or  negative,  depending  on  the  circumstances  of  a  particular  country.  Indirect \nimpacts  include  (i)  effects  on  government  revenue,  (ii)  foreign  exchange  effects,  (iii) \nemployment  effects, \nto  business \ncommunications.  The  scale  of  potential  impacts  depend  on  the  circumstances  facing \nindividual  countries,  including  the  relative  size  of  inbound  and  outbound  tourism  and  the \nmarket shares on key routes held by its airlines. \n\n(iv)  and  effects \n\nimprovements \n\nflowing \n\nfrom \n\nSubstantial  direct  costs  would  be  incurred  in  upgrading  infrastructure  and  providing  airline \nservices,  especially  where  regional  airport  facilities  require  substantial  investment  and \nwhere many islands require improved airline connectivity (as in the case of BIMP-EAGA). \n\nFurther,  improving  airline  connectivity  between  less-developed  regions  appears  likely  to \nincur substantial indirect costs, especially in the short run. Subsidies, tax concessions, and \nother incentives may be necessary to persuade airlines to offer the desired services. It was \nnoted  that  subsidies  make  it  difficult  for  airlines  to  compete on equal terms. It is important \nthat subsidies be transparent and allocated on a basis, which does not distort competition. \n\n\fAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  27 \n\nIn  moving  toward  liberalized  aviation  markets,  there  is  a  risk  that  airlines  engage  in \nanticompetitive  behavior,  such  as  predatory  pricing  and  collusion.  Given  that  competition \npolicy is in its infancy in most ASEAN countries, an acceptable alternative approach might \nbe to develop an ASEAN code of conduct for airlines. \n\nFinancial instability,, which currently affects many ASEAN airlines, is a problem. In part, this \nis  the  result  of  intensifying  competition  and,  hence,  thin  margins  in  a  high-operating  cost \nindustry.  Some  ASEAN  carriers  (e.g.,  Garuda  and  Philippine  Airlines)  simply  lack  the \nresources  to  compete  effectively  with  the  region\u2019s  dominant  carriers\u2014Singapore  Airlines, \nMalaysia Airlines, and Thai Airways. Where undercapitalized airlines have been privatized, \nthey have proved vulnerable to external shocks such as oil price increases and sharp falls in \npassenger  and  cargo  volumes.  For  example,  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997, \nGaruda,  Malaysia  Airlines,  and  Philippines  Airlines  had  to  be  rescued  by  their  respective \ngovernments.  While  there  are  no  easy  solutions  to  this  problem,  a  staged  process  of \nliberalization would give airlines time to address their financial problems.\n\nThe  availability  of  managerial  and  technical  skills  differs  widely  among  the  countries  of \nASEAN.  Cross-country  investments,  strategic  alliances,  and  cooperation  will  help  reduce \ndifferences.\n\nAs Christopher Findlay has noted,21 policy makers must necessarily be concerned with the \nsequencing of aviation reforms. The aim should be to introduce reforms in such a way that \ntheir  impact  is  cumulative  and  self-reinforcing:  successful  reform  building  on  the  reform \nplatform already established. We note that changes in \u201cmarket access\u201d (i.e., rules relating to \nentry and capacity) that have already occurred in the aSEA region are creating pressures for \nfurther change. The opening of markets has created the need for more capital to purchase \nthe planes and ground equipment to service them. The need for more capital, in turn, leads \nto pressure for changes in ownership rules. Aviation reform within the aSEA region is also \nbeing driven by events in the market place and by regulatory reform in the rest of the world. \nThe end result should be an aviation industry that provides improved connectivity throughout \nthe aSEA region as well as being more responsive to market needs.\n\n                                                           \n\n21   Christopher  Findlay,  Strategic  Directions  for  ASEAN  Airlines  in  a  Globalizing  World:  Overview,  REPSF\nProject No. 04/008, Final Report, August 2005, p.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 2\n\nReferences\n\nASEAN. 2007.

Such  services  call  at  regional  hub  airports  (Singapore, \nBangkok,  and  Kuala  Lumpur).  Smaller  aSEA  economies  do  not  generate  sufficient \ntraffic to warrant calls by Tier One Services, nor do many regional airports have the \nability to handle large jet aircraft.\n\nRegional routes that generate sufficient traffic to warrant the use of medium size jets \n(A320,  B757).  Such  services  may  link  two  or  more  aSEA  economies  (e.g., \nSingapore\u2013East Malaysia\u2013Brunei Darussalam). Tier Two services may funnel traffic \nto  and  from  regional  hub  airports.

Many of the islands are poor, remote from main centers of economic \nactivity, and not well connected. Improving air connectivity can be instrumental in reducing \ndevelopment gaps. The paper examines the importance of improving air connectivity, and \nthe state of the airline industry and the related infrastructure in the region. Special attention \nis paid to regional policies relating to air transport, and the paper concludes with policy \nrecommendations.  \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. WPS090828\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nWorking Paper Series\n\nAir Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast \n\nAsia: An Overview\n\nKeith Trace, Barend Frielink, and Denis Hew\n\nNo. 2   |   September 2009 \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series\n", "Air Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia:  \nAn Overview \n", "Keith Trace*, Barend Frielink, and Denis \nHew**\n", "No. 2       September 2009 \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "+ Keith  Trace  is  a  Consultant  at PDP Australia \n* Keith Thrace is a Consultant at PDP Australia \nPty  Ltd,  Sydney,  Australia.
