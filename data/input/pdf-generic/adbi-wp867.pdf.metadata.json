INTRODUCTION \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nTo  achieve  the  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development  and  the  Paris  Climate  Accord, \ninvestment will have to be directed away from carbon- and resource-intensive investments, \nand toward sustainable investment. Responsibility for financial and macroeconomic stability \nimplicitly or explicitly rests with the central bank, which therefore ought to address climate-\nrelated  and  other  environmental  risks  on  a  systemic  level.  Furthermore,  central  banks, \nthrough  their  regulatory  oversight  over  money,  credit,  and  the  financial  system,  are  in  a \npowerful position to support the development of sustainable finance approaches and enforce \nan  adequate  pricing  of  environmental  and  carbon  risk  by  financial  institutions  (Volz  2017). \nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  paper  discusses  the  extent  to  which  central  banks  should \nincorporate  environmental  considerations  into  their  operations  and  reviews  the  public \nfinancial governance policies through which central banks, as well as other relevant financial \nregulatory agencies, can promote green finance.  \n\n \n\nThe  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  2  discusses  the  reasons  why  central  banks \nshould  be  concerned  with  aligning  finance  with  sustainable  development.  In  doing  so,  it \ndifferentiates  between  the  impact  of  environmental  factors  on  the  conventional  goals  of \ncentral  banking,  and  a  potential  promotional  role  of  central  banks  with  regard  to  green \nfinance  and  sustainability.  Subsequently,  Section  3  reviews  the  tools  and  instruments  that \ncan be utilized by central banks and financial regulatory agencies to promote green finance \nand  sustainable  development.  It  also  provides  some  examples  of  public  green  financial \npolicies in different policy areas. Section 4 concludes. \n\n2.  WHY CENTRAL BANKS SHOULD BE CONCERNED \nWITH ALIGNING FINANCE WITH SUSTAINABLE \nGROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT \n\nGreen  central  banking  can  be  defined  as  central  banking  that  takes  account  of \nenvironmental risks, including risks from climate change, which may have a material impact \non  the  short-  and  long-term  stability  and  development  of  the  financial  sector  and  the \nmacroeconomy.  One  can  distinguish  between  central  banks\u2019  responses  to  environmental \ntraditional  core  responsibility  of  safeguarding \nexternalities  affecting  central  banks\u2019 \nmacroeconomic and financial stability, and an activist role of central banks in \u201cgreening\u201d the \neconomy. Green central banking therefore describes, on the one hand, the process of taking \nenvironmental risk and other sustainability-related factors, such as climate-change-mitigation \npolicy, into account in the design of monetary policy and financial regulation in the pursuit of \nthe  traditional  goals  of  price  and  financial  stability.  This  can  be  described  as  the  passive \naspect of green central banking because in pursuing their established goals, central banks \nmay  need  to  incorporate  environmental  factors  into  existing  frameworks,  for  instance  into \nmacro-prudential frameworks, without pursuing a \u201csustainability agenda\u201d. On the other hand, \ncentral banks may be mandated to actively use the tools at their disposal to promote green \ninvestment or discourage brown investment and play a \u201cdevelopmental role\u201d (Dafe and Volz \n2015). \n\n2.1  The Importance of Environmental Factors for Conventional \n\nGoals of Central Banking \n\nThe core responsibility of most central banks \u2013 often specified in the mandate as the singular \nor primary objective of monetary policy \u2013 is safeguarding low and stable inflation. Sometimes \nembedded  in  an  inflation-targeting  framework,  this  primary  focus  of  central  banks  on  price \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nstability is based on the theoretical and empirical understanding that low and stable inflation \nis a necessary precondition for growth or development to take place. Apart from maintaining \nlow  and  stable  inflation,  safeguarding  financial  stability  has  traditionally  been  the  other \nimportant concern for central banks, which, throughout history, have acted as lender of last \nresort.  Although  there  was  a  trend  since  the  1990s  to  assign  responsibility  for  financial \nstability to dedicated financial regulatory authorities, it has received renewed attention as a \ncrucial  central  baking  objective  against  the  background  of  the  Global  Financial  Crisis.  A \nfurther  (often  secondary)  goal  of  central  banking  is  supporting  wider  economic  policy \nobjectives  such  as  sustainable  growth  or,  in  some  cases,  maximum  employment.  A  strong \nargument  for  central  banks  to  take  environmental  factors  into  account  in  the  conduct  of \nmonetary policy in the pursuit of their core objectives can be derived from how these central \ngoals are affected by climate change and other environmental risks. \n\n2.1.1  Impact on Price Stability \n\nPrices and price variability, which are at the center of attention of most central banks, could \nbe  affected  through  various  channels  by  anthropogenic  climate  change  and  an  associated \nincrease  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  extreme  weather  events.  To  start  with,  climate \nchange may have a significant impact on agricultural production, both domestic and abroad, \nand  hence  on  food  prices,  which  are  an  important  component  of  consumer  price  inflation. \nFor instance, climate change-related droughts and floods may have a significant impact on \nagricultural  production  and  cause  supply  shocks  and  hence  rising  prices  and  cost-push \ninflation.  For  economies  where  agricultural  production  is  a  central  pillar  of  the  economy  \u2013 \nwhich is often the case in developing economies \u2013 climate change effects on the agricultural \nsector may also have a broader impact on aggregate income and employment. While a first \nconcern is how climate change-related hazards may directly affect prices, a second issue of \nconcern is the potential impact of climate-change-mitigation policy on inflation. An important \nissue in this context is the potential impact that climate-change-mitigation policies may have \non  energy  production  and  prices  (Volz  2017).  McKibbin  et  al.  (2017)  discuss  how  different \nclimate  change  policy  regimes  \u2013  carbon  policies  such  as  a  carbon  tax,  a  permit  trading \nsystem, and other regulatory measures \u2013 could theoretically affect different monetary policy \nregimes.  In  a  scenario  where  the  introduction  of  a  carbon  tax  causes  aggregate  output  to \ndecline  and  inflation  to  spike,  no  response  by  the  central  bank  would  yield  a  permanently \nlower output level and no change in the long-term growth rate. In the case of a strict inflation-\ntargeting regime, the central bank would respond to the spike in inflation by raising interest \nrates,  thereby  further  slowing  the  economy,  but  also  causing  exchange  rate  appreciation. \nWhile both would have a depreciating effect on inflation, the overall decline in output would \nbe  worse  than  in  the  case  without  central  bank  intervention.  McKibbin  et  al.  also  discuss \nimplications for other monetary policy regimes, including flexible-inflation targeting and price-\nlevel targeting, and come to the overall conclusion that solely responding to the inflationary \ncomponent, without taking rising prices and decreasing output resulting from climate policy \ninto account, may lead to unnecessarily large output losses. Monetary policy therefore has to \ntake into account climate-related effects on food or energy prices, as well as the impact of \nclimate mitigation policies because of potentially important implications for core inflation. \n\n2.1.2  Impact on Financial Stability \n\nTo  the  extent  that  environmental  damages  and  climate-related  risks  affect  the  stability  of \nbanks,  insurance  firms  and  other  financial  actors,  they  need  to  be  of  concern  for  central \nbanking.  Thus  far,  only  a  few  central  banks  and  financial  regulators  have  been  concerned \nwith  environmental  risk,  and  even  fewer  have  considered  it  as  part  of  their  systemic  risk \nframework,  even  though  risks  arising  from  climate  change  can  constitute  a  significant \nsystemic risk for the financial sector and economies at large (Volz 2017). However, a broad \nconsensus  is  emerging  that  climate  change  and  related  mitigation  policies  will  have \nsubstantial  repercussions  on  the  functioning  of  economies  and  hence,  financial  systems \n(Bank of England 2015; Carney 2015). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nThree different types of risk through which climate change may affect financial systems have \nbeen  identified:  transitional  risk,  physical  risk,  and  liability  risk  (Carney  2015).  Transitional \nrisk describes the uncertainty associated with policy, price, and valuation changes that may \noccur  in  the  process  of  mitigating  climate  change  and  reducing  carbon  emissions. \nInternational  goals,  such  as  limiting  global  warming  to  two  degrees,  will  require  powerful \npolicy  initiatives,  such  as  the  introduction  of  carbon  taxes  or  extensive  environmental \nregulation,  which  will  affect  the  valuation  of  carbon-intensive  businesses  and  may  render \nassets of coal, gas, and oil companies less valuable with potential systemic repercussions in \ncase  these  policy  changes  have  not  been  priced  in.  Volz  (2017)  also  discusses  the \ndevelopment  of  new  technologies  in  the  process  of  climate-change-mitigation  that  may \nrender  existing  technologies  redundant,  and  the  associated  revaluation  of  assets,  as  a \npotential source of financial instability, which, if they do not occur in a gradual manner, may \nhave systemic implications. \n\nPhysical  risk  describes  the  risk  of  natural  hazards,  such  as  floods  and  storms,  which  may \ncause direct damages to an economy, as well as indirectly through the disruption of global \nsupply  changes.  Climate-related  damages  and  risks  are  understood  to  be  potentially \nsignificant  and  to  not  only  cause  disruptions  for  individual  firms  or  sectors,  but  also  have \nsystemic repercussions for the economy and therefore, financial stability. Increasing levels of \nphysical  risk  can  be  expected  to  have  particularly  large  repercussions  for  the  insurance \nsector.  As  recognized  by  the  Bank  of  England  (2015),  climate  change-induced  and  other \nvital environmental changes therefore have clear implications for central banks because they \nmay  negatively  affect  the  stability  of  financial  institutions  and  systems.  Pricing  in  physical \nrisks  is  an  essential  step  in  avoiding  these  negative  repercussions  for  the  economy  and \nseems especially crucial for the valuation of long-term investments. \n\nThirdly,  liability  risk  describes  climate  or  environmental  risks  that  occur  from  uncertainty \nsurrounding  potential  financial  losses  and  compensation  claims  stemming  from  damages \ncaused  by  climate  change-related  natural  hazards  (Bank  of  England  2015;  Carney  2015). \nAgents  may  seek  compensation  for  financial  damages  from  carbon  extractors  or  emitters \nand environmental polluters, creating repercussions for the insurance sector and hence, for \ncentral banks that provide third-party liability insurance (Bank of England 2015). \n\nOverall,  a  consensus  has  been  emerging  in  the  central  banking  community  that  climate \nchange-related natural disasters can create and intensify risks to the stability of the financial \nsystem, and that potential disruptions from climate change ought to be analyzed and taken \ninto  account  by  central  banks,  especially  if  central  banks  are  responsible  for  safeguarding \nfinancial stability (Bank of England 2015; Carney 2015). \n\n \n\n2.2  Sustainable Development as a Goal of Central Banking \n\nThe second dimension of green central banking \u2013 i.e., an active contribution to a greening of \nthe  financial  system  and  the  economy  as  a  whole  by  central  banks  \u2013  has  been  more \ncontentious. As will be discussed in the next section, central banks have numerous powerful \ntools  at  their  disposal  to  affect  credit  allocation  and  the  investment  behavior  of  financial \nfirms. Whether and to what extent a central bank should use its powers and actively engage \nin  \u201cgreening\u201d  the  financial  system  and  the  economy  depends  on  two  factors:  its  legal \nmandate, and the extent to which it is best placed to correct certain types of market failures, \ntaking  into  account  the  ability  and  suitability  of  other  policy  institutions  to  steer  the  green \ntransformation (Volz 2017). \n\n2.2.1  Mandated Responsibility \n\nFor central banks to assume an active \u201cgreening\u201d role, an explicit legal mandate is required \nto  pursue  environmental  and  sustainability  objectives,  given  the  potentially  distributive \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nconsequences.  In  most  of  today\u2019s  advanced  economies,  central  banks  have  a  relatively \nnarrow  mandate  with  a  primary  objective  of  pursuing  price  stability  and,  in  some  cases, \nfinancial  stability.  As  discussed,  such  narrow  mandates  arguably  require  central  banks  to \nexplore  climate  and  environmental  risks  with  regard  to  these  core  goals,  but  they  do  not \nmandate  them  to  go  further  and  to  actively  promote  sustainability  and  green  finance.  In \nmany  developing  and  emerging  economies,  central  bank  mandates  are  more \ncomprehensive and include sustainability, as well as social and economic objectives. This is \nreflected by the fact that central banks in many developing and  emerging economies have \nbeen  comparatively  more  active  in  promoting  green  finance  and  sustainable  development, \nas  will  be  discussed  below.  Dikau  and  Ryan-Collins  (2017)  take  a  closer  look  at  the  legal \nmandates  and  objectives  of  those  central  banks  in  emerging  economies  that  most  actively \npursue green central banking policies. The legal mandate of Bangladesh Bank, the central \nbank of Bangladesh, for example, includes supporting economic growth and development as \na secondary objective, based on which Bank Bangladesh has stated that it understands the \ngreening of the financial system and the economy to be within its responsibility (Bangladesh \nBank 2011). Furthermore, Banco Central do Brasil, the central bank of Brazil, which serves \nas financial regulator and supervisor, is tasked with promoting balanced development and to \nserve  the  collective  interest,  implying  a  sustainability  objective  for  the  central  bank  (Brasil \n1988). While the mandate of the People\u2019s Bank of China includes the overreaching objective \nof  maintaining  price  stability  and  thereby  promoting  economic  growth,  it  also  requires  the \ncentral  bank  to  implement  the  orders  of  the  State  Council,  potentially  involving  the  central \nbank  in  far-reaching  policy  initiatives,  such  as  the  promotion  of  green  finance  and \nsustainability (People\u2019s Republic of China 2003). \n\nNonetheless, there are also risks involved with overstretching the mandates of central banks \nto  include  sustainability  objectives.  Volz  (2017)  highlights  problems  associated  with \npotentially conflicting objectives of central banks, and dangers regarding the accountability of \ncentral  banks.  He  also  points  to  the  prevailing  central  banking  paradigm  as  limiting  the \nextent  to  which  mandates  can  or  should  be  extended  and  how  existing  ones  may  be \ninterpreted to include green sustainability objectives. \n\n2.2.2  The Market Failure Argument \n\nAchieving the global climate targets will not only require the financial sector to play a central \nrole  in  financing  sustainable  and  green  investment,  but  also  to  restrict  funding  for \nenvironmentally  harmful  activities.  In  the  absence  of  public  intervention,  banks  and  other \nfinancial institutions may allocate their resources to environmentally and socially undesirable \nactivities,  such  as  carbon-intensive  or  polluting  ventures  in  order  to  maximize  their  private \nreturns.  This  discrepancy  between  environmental  and  social  returns,  and  private  returns \nrepresents  a  market  failure  or  imperfection  that  may  call  for  efficiency-enhancing \ngovernment  intervention.  That  free  markets  do  not  necessarily  yield  Pareto-efficient \nallocations  has  been  investigated  by  Greenwald  and  Stiglitz  (1986),  based  on  the \nunderstanding  that  if  information  is  incomplete  or  asymmetric,  or  when  markets  are \nincomplete, outcomes may not be efficient and can be improved through the intervention of \nthe  government.  With  regard  to  the  allocation  of  credit,  Stiglitz  (1994)  discusses  an \nefficiency-enhancing role of credit policies based on the assumption that the private returns \nof commercial bank lending are not necessarily congruent with social returns. He argues that \nin order to overcome these discrepancies between private and social return, directed credit, \nrestricted  lending  to  some  activities,  and  promoting  investment  in  others  may  be  justified. \nWith  regard  to  sustainable  growth  and  green  finance,  externalities  that  cause  an \nenvironmentally  suboptimal  allocation  of  credit  by  commercial  banks  and  other  market \nparticipants may call for a more active, market-correcting role of central banks. \n\nNonetheless,  intervention  by  the  central  bank  conceptually  constitutes  a  second-best \nsolution  to  the  problem  of  market  imperfection.  The  preferable  first-best  solution  would  be \nthe removal of the market failure. For instance, a carbon pricing mechanism that internalizes \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nthe social costs of carbon emissions would constitute a preferred, first-best, market failure-\ncorrecting policy that may prevent or dis-incentivize environmentally undesirable investment; \nthe problem, however, is that such first-best policies may not always be politically feasible or \nmay take a long time to establish (Volz 2017). In the case where the optimality conditions of \nfixing  market  failure  cannot  be  satisfied,  the  intervention  of  the  central  bank  through \nenvironmental financial regulation or the interference into the allocation of resources can be \ninterpreted as a second-best solution based on the theory of the second best by Lipsey and \nLancaster  (1956)(Volz  2017).  In  practice,  second-best  policies  could  be  implemented  by \nmandating  central  banks  to  address  such  externalities  by  affecting  the  creation  and \nallocation of credit.  \n\nthe  allocation  of  resources  and  credit \n\nCentral  banks  and  other  financial  regulatory  authorities  can  influence  investment  decisions \nthrough  a  number  of  different  policy \nand \nimplementation  instruments,  which  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  below.  Their  regulatory \noversight  over  money,  credit,  and  the  financial  system  puts  central  banks  in  a  uniquely \npowerful  position  that  enables  them  to  incentivize  or  direct  resources  away  from  carbon-\nintensive  sectors  and  toward  green  investment.  Especially  in  developing  countries,  central \nbanks  typically  have  a  strong  institutional  standing  that  enables  them  to  shape  policy \noutcomes in ways that other public institutions, such as environmental ministries, are unlikely \nto achieve. However, given their power, the points made about central banks\u2019 mandate and \naccountability discussed above are very important. \n\nHistorically, credit allocation policies and various other instruments of \u201cfinancial repression\u201d \nwere widely used and have led in many cases to substantial distortions of financial systems \nwith often unwanted repercussions for savings and prices; in many cases, the consequence \nwas the underdevelopment of financial markets. While the historic success or failure of credit \nallocation  and  financial  repression  policies  is  subject  to  on-going  debate,  such  instruments \nstand in strong contrast to the widely accepted notion of the neutrality of monetary policy and \ncentral  banks  in  general  toward  different  investment  classes,  sectors,  or  types  of  firms. \nAllocating  financial  resources  toward  or  away  from  certain  sectors  and  companies  implies \nfavoring certain segments of the economy over others and appears to be incompatible with \nour modern understanding of independent central banks. Nonetheless, many central banks \nin  emerging  and  developing  economies  have  resorted  to  these  policies  as  viable,  second-\nbest solutions to promote sustainable development and green investment. The notion of the \nneutrality of monetary policy has come under intense scrutiny more recently, not least in the \ncontext  of  discussions  about  the  distributional  consequences  of  the  negative  interest  and \nquantitative easing policies adopted by major central banks. \n\nAnother kind of market failure involves missing or incomplete financial markets that impede \nthe trading of different forms of credit, assets, or risks (Volz 2017). While central banks most \ncertainly have a role to play in financial market development and in establishing primary and \nsecondary markets for securities, as well as money and exchange markets where none exist \n(Gray  and  Talbot  2007),  they  may  also  be  in  a  position  to  aid  development  of  new  green \nmarket  segments  by,  for  instance,  creating  a  regulatory  environment  that  promotes  green \nbonds issuances and trading in secondary markets. \n\n3.  TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS OF CENTRAL BANKS TO \nADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL RISK AND PROMOTE \nGREEN FINANCE AND INVESTMENT \n\nCentral banks and financial regulatory agencies can employ numerous policy instruments to \nachieve  sustainability  targets  (Volz  2017).  This  section  distinguishes  five  different  policy \nareas,  including  micro-prudential  regulation,  macro-prudential  regulation,  financial  market \ndevelopment, credit allocation, and central bank soft power and guidelines. For each of the \nfive  policy  areas,  a  number  of  different  policy  implementation  tools  and  instruments  are \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\ndiscussed  and  then  illustrated  through  examples  of  central  banks  that  have  employed  the \ndiscussed  tools.  It  is  apparent  that  central  banks  in  developing  and  emerging  economies \nespecially,  and  in  Asia  in  particular,  have  been  at  the  forefront  of  using  a  broad  range  of \ninstruments  to  address  environmental  risk  and  encourage  green  investment  (Volz  2016, \n2018;  Dikau  and  Ryan-Collins  2017).  Central  banks  in  advanced  economies  have  only \nrecently  started  to  address  the  implications  of  climate  change  for  monetary  and  financial \nstability, with a leading role of the Bank of England, which has played a central role in raising \nawareness  of  the  implications  of  climate  change  risks  amongst  central  banks  (Bank  of \nEngland  2015;  Carney  2015).  A  more  comprehensive  overview  of  the  steps  central  banks \naround  the  world  have  taken  to  align  the  financial  system  with  sustainability  targets  is \nprovided in Appendix 1. \n\n3.1  Green Micro-prudential Regulation \n\nMany instruments of financial regulation can be calibrated to encourage or require financial \ninstitutions to consider climate and environmental risks in their operations with regard to the \nloan  origination  process  or  financial  stability  concerns.  Central  banks  and  other  financial \nregulatory  authorities  can  require  banks  and  other \nto  adopt \nEnvironmental & Social (E&S) risk-management standards, to assess and disclose climate-\nrelated risks, or to adjust reserve holdings. \n\ninstitutions \n\nfinancial \n\n3.1.1  Disclosure Requirements \n\nEffective disclosure requirements for banks and other financial institutions of climate change-\nrelated  risks  can  play  a  central  role  in  ensuring  that  the  impact  of  climate  change,  climate \npolicies,  and  natural  hazards  are  correctly  priced  in  by  financial  institutions.  The  Financial \nStability  Board\u2019s  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  discusses \ndisclosure  requirements  as  a  central  element  of  forming  a  response  to  climate  and \nenvironmental risk based on the understanding that a lack of information of risk exposure of \nfinancial institutions entails consequences for financial stability, because the misallocation or \nmispricing of assets may cause abrupt price corrections in financial markets at a later stage \n(TCFD  2016).  Mandatory  disclosure  requirements  for  all  financial  institutions  could  be  a \nregulatory  instrument  to  achieve  this  goal.  Furthermore,  Volz  (2017)  points  out  that \nimproving  transparency  with  regard  to  climate-related  risks  and  the  appropriate  pricing  of \nthese  risks  are  pre-conditional  for  green  macro-prudential  regulation,  which  is  discussed \nbelow.  \n\n3.1.2  E&S Risk-management Standards \n\nSimilar  to  disclosure  requirements,  financial  regulation  that  endorses  mandatory  E&S  risk-\nmanagement  standards  requires  financial  institutions  to  incorporate  E&S  risk  factors  into \ntheir  governance  frameworks.  With  the  aim  of  enforcing  climate-related  risk  management \nbeyond  disclosure,  green  E&S \nrisk-management  standards  may  also  establish \nenvironmental  and  social  rules  for  banks\u2019  lending  practices by  requiring  the  assessment  of \nthese  risks, as well as taking into account potentially harmful environmental effects of new \nfinancial services and products. Furthermore, mandatory green risk management standards \ncould oblige banks to include an assessment of E&S risks in the loan origination process as \na  criterion  based  on  which  loans  are  extended.  This  would  likely  also  have  allocative \nconsequences  by  reducing  the  flow  of  finance  to  polluting  and  energy  intensive  firms  and \nenhancing the financing of greener projects. \n\n3.1.3  Reserve Requirements \n\nReserve  requirements  determine  the  minimum  amount  of  reserves  that  must  be  held  by \ncommercial banks. They could be calibrated to create incentives leading to the promotion of \ngreen  assets  or  make  brown  lending  less  attractive.  Differential  reserve  requirements  that \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nare linked to the compositions of banks\u2019 portfolios, allowing lower (higher) required reserve \nrates  for  portfolios  skewed  toward  greener,  less  carbon-intensive  assets  (brown,  carbon-\nintensive  assets)  can  potentially  influence  the  allocation  of  credit  and  promote  green \ninvestments.  Another  approach  discussed  in  the  literature  is  the  acceptance  of  carbon \ncertificates as part of commercial banks\u2019 legal reserves in order to enhance the market for \ncarbon  certificates  and  by  distributing  carbon  certificates  that  are  exchangeable  for  loan \nconcessions  to  low-carbon  projects,  creating  an  incentive  to  further  enhance  green \ninvestment (Rozenberg et al. 2013). \n\n3.1.4  Green Financial Regulation in Practice \n\nGreen financial regulatory measures have been employed in a number of countries thus far, \nincluding  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  In  the  PRC,  first \nenvironmental  regulatory  policies  by  the  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  (PBC)  date  back  to  the \n1980s (Zadek and Chenghui 2014). The Green Credit Policy that was launched jointly by the \nPBC,  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  and  the  China  Banking  Regulatory \nCommission in 2007 has been one of the most comprehensive regulatory green policies to \ndate,  addressing  the  banking  system,  insurance,  and  securities  markets.  Furthermore,  in \n2006  the  PBC  created  a  database  for  credit  consisting  of  information  on  credit,  fines,  and \nenvironmental compliance of firms as a source of information on which to base restrictions of \ncredit to blacklisted companies and sectors. \n\nDifferential reserve requirements have been employed by Banque du Liban, the central bank \nof  Lebanon,  with  the  goal  of  influencing  the  allocation  of  credit  in  favor  of  investment  in \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency. Commercial banks are incentivized to increase the \nshare  of  green  lending  projects  of  their  loan  portfolio  by  allowing  \u201cgreener\u201d  banks  to  hold \nlower  reserves  (Banque  du  Liban  2010).  Commercial  banks  that  extend  loans  to  finance \nprojects  that  entail  energy  savings  potential  are  subject  to  lower  reserve  requirements.  In \npractice,  the  Lebanese  Centre  for  Energy  Conservation,  a  governmental  agency,  verifies \nwhether  the  underlying  investments  would  contribute  to  greening  the  energy  sector  and \ndeclares  the  bank  loans  that  finance  them  eligible  for  receiving  the  preferential  reserve \nrequirement treatment. \n\n3.2  Green Macro-prudential Regulation \n\nMacro-prudential regulation aims to mitigate systemic risks that threaten the stability of the \nfinancial  system  as  a  whole.  It  is  applied  to  close  the  gap  between  macroeconomic  policy \nand  micro-prudential  regulation  and  can  play  a  central  role  in  incorporating  climate  and \nenvironmental  risks  into  regulatory  frameworks.  The  application  of  many  macro-prudential \npolicy  tools  to  identify  and  mitigate  environmental  risks  may  also  have  allocative \nconsequences for credit (Schoenmaker and Tilburg 2016). \n\n3.2.1  Climate-related Stress Testing \n\nClimate-related stress tests can fulfill the task of assessing the potential impact that natural \nhazards  may  have  on  the  economy,  the  health  of  individual  financial  institutions,  and  the \nfinancial  system  as  a  whole.  Apart  from  enabling  the  evaluation  of  the  resilience  of  the \nfinancial system to adverse shocks, climate-related stress tests would also be necessary to \ncalibrate green macro-prudential policy instruments and to allow for the incorporation of the \nidentified vulnerabilities into capital buffers, risk weights, and caps. \n\n3.2.2  Counter-cyclical Capital Buffers \n\nCounter-cyclical  capital  buffers  are  employed  to  mitigate  the  financial  cycle  and  can  \nbe calibrated with regard to environmental risks to ease the potential effect of the pricing-in \nof  a  so-called  \u201ccarbon  bubble\u201d  that  describes  the  expected  sudden  re-pricing  of  carbon-\n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nintensive  assets  due  to  of  stricter  emission  targets  and  environmental  policy.  In  practice, \nhigher  capital \nfor  carbon-intensive  credit  growth  could  be  applied \n(Schoenmaker and Tilburg 2016). \n\nrequirements \n\n3.2.3  Differentiated Capital Requirements \n\nto  Risk  (Weighted)  Assets  Ratio.  Capital  requirements  could \n\nThrough  capital  requirements,  financial  regulators  require  financial  institutions  to  hold  a \ncertain  percentage  of  capital  for  risk-weighted  assets,  which  is  usually  expressed  in  the \ntheoretically \nCapital \ndifferentiate asset classes based on sustainability criteria and assign higher risk weights to \ncarbon-intensive  assets  in  anticipation  of  future  negative  and  sudden  price  developments. \nSchoenmaker and Tilburg (2016) stress differential capital requirements as a central policy \ntool that enables the correct pricing  of carbon risks. Furthermore, this instrument may also \nhave  important  allocative  consequences  for  credit  by  incentivizing  the  disinvestment  from \ncarbon-intensive assets and dependent sectors. \n\n3.2.4  Loan-to-value and Loan-to-income Caps \n\nLimiting the extension of credit by banks to certain industries and the investment in specified \nasset classes can also be used as an allocative tool to limit the flow of resources to sectors \nor companies that exceed specified carbon-emission targets. \n\n3.2.5  Large Exposure Restrictions \n\nExposure  restrictions  by  counter-party,  sector,  or  geographic  area  is  a  macro-prudential \npolicy  tool  employed  to  limit  the  exposure  of  financial  institutions  to  assets  entailing  high \nrisks or, with regard to green finance, a high-carbon intensity. While the primary aim might \ntherefore  be  to  protect  financial  institutions  against  a  carbon  bubble,  Schoenmaker  and \nTilburg  (2016)  argue  that  this  instrument  could  also  be  employed  for  the  fine-tuning  of \nlending restrictions and the allocation of credit. \n\n3.2.6  Identification of Systemically Important Financial Institutions  \n\nand Capital Surcharges \n\nApplying  capital  surcharges  for  institutions  with  high  exposure  to  carbon-intensive  assets \ncould  alter  the  identification  of  Systemically  Important  Financial  Institutions  (SIFIs)  and \nensure that climate risks are appropriately accounted for in order to reduce systemic risk.  \n\n3.2.7  Green Macro-prudential Regulation in Practice \n\nThe  Banco  Central  do  Brasil  has  been  among  the  first  central  banks  to  address  climate-\nrelated  environmental,  as  well  as  social,  risks  on  a  systemic  level  through  the  issuance  of \nbinding  amendments  to  its  macro-prudential  regulatory  framework.  In  2011,  the  Banco \nCentral  do  Brasilextended  its  requirements  on  the  Internal  Process  of  Capital  Adequacy \nAssessment, which originates from Pillar 2 of the Basel II accords and requires commercial \nbanks to take the exposure to environmental damages and risks into account (Banco Central \ndo  Brasil  2011).  These  capital  requirements  aim  at  pricing-in  environmental  risks  and  are \npart  of  the  Banco  Central  do  Brasil\u2019s  broader  green  banking  regulatory  approach,  through \nwhich it requires banks to evaluate and consider E&S in their lending practices, to stress-test \nagainst  the  exposure  to  environmental  risks,  and  to  furthermore  issue  annual  reports \noutlining their risk assessment methods and exposure to social and environmental damages \n(Banco Central do Brasil, 2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\n3.3  Green Financial Market Development \n\nThe development of green security markets and green lending is another area where central \nbanks could play an assisting role. In many of today\u2019s advanced economies, the evolution of \nfinancial  markets  precedes  the  establishment  of  central  banks.  However,  central  banks  in \ndeveloping  countries  can  play  a  central  role  in  supporting  the  development  of  financial \nmarkets  and  encourage  active  trading  in  bond  markets  to  encourage  other  actors  to \nparticipate (Gray and Talbot 2007). With regard to green bonds, policy-directed development \nbanks  such  as  the  European  Investment  Bank  of  Germany\u2019s  KfW  have  so  far  played  this \nmarket-developing role in many countries by issuing the first green bonds and thereby aiding \nthe creation of green bond markets. Central banks and other financial agencies can create \nan enabling environment for the issuance and trading of such green securities. \n\n3.3.1  Information Disclosure Requirements \n\nThrough  the  introduction  of  effective  procedures  for  the  disclosure  of  environmental  and \nsustainability-related  information  on  bonds  and  other  assets,  central  banks  and  regulatory \nagencies can strengthen the identification and acceptance of green assets. \n\n3.3.2  Green Bond Guidelines \n\nIn  order  to  encourage  the  issuance  of  green  bonds,  central  banks  can  issue  green  bond \nguidelines and define criteria according to which the financing of projects and firms qualifies \nas  green  bonds,  what  the  use  of  the  proceeds  from  the  bond  issuance  can  be,  as  well  as \ndisclosure  standards.  Establishing  and  enforcing  criteria  for  green  bond  labels  can  be  a \nfurther step in promoting green bond issuance. \n\n3.3.3  Green Financial Market Development in Practice \n\nA central bank that has played an active role in encouraging the development of green bond \nmarkets and innovative market institutions is the PBC. The Green Finance Task Force, an \ninternational  cooperative  group  initiated  by  the  PBC  in  cooperation  with  UNEP  Inquiry  with \nthe  aim  of  developing  an  action  plan  for  the  promotion  of  green  finance  in  the  PRC, \nrecommended  that  the  PBC,  together  with  the  PRC\u2019s  banking  and  securities  regulatory \nagencies, should issue industry guidelines for green bonds (PBOC and UNEP Inquiry 2015). \nThe  PBC  issued  the  first  official  green  bond  guidelines  in  December  2015  to  encourage \nunified standards for the issuance of green bonds (PBOC 2016). \n\n3.4  Green Credit Allocation \n\nEven  though  many  of  the  policy  instruments  discussed  above  have  potentially  allocative \nconsequences, there are also dedicated credit allocation instruments. These are not widely \nin  use  today  by  central  banks  in  advanced  economics  but  remain  fairly  popular  in  many \ndeveloping and emerging economies. For central banks that employ credit allocation policies \ntoday with regard to green finance, most notably Bank Bangladesh and the Reserve Bank of \nIndia  (RBI),  green  investment  has  often  been  added  as  an  additional  priority  sector  to \nexisting  and \nthat  otherwise  pursue \ndevelopmental  objectives  (Dikau  and  Ryan-Collins  2017).  Fry  (1995),  who  makes  a  strong \ncase against financial repression and credit allocation policies, lists subsidized loan rates for \npriority  sectors,  differential  rediscount  rates,  direct  budgetary  subsidies,  credit  floors  and \nceilings,  and  the  proliferation  of  development  banks  as  the  central  allocative  policy \ninstruments,  many  of  which  can  also  be  applied  to  promote  green  investment  and \nsustainable development. \n\nlong-standing  credit  allocation  policy  schemes \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\n3.4.1  Targeted Refinancing Lines \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nterms \n\nfor  specified  green  asset  classes, \n\nGreen-targeted refinancing lines by central banks offer refinancing for commercial banks at \npreferential \nthereby  compensating  or \novercompensating financial institutions for lending at lower-than-market interest rates to low-\ncarbon  or  otherwise  sustainable  projects.  However,  this  policy  tool  is  only  relevant  in \neconomies with relatively underdeveloped secondary security markets and hence a lack of \nmarket-based  refinancing  options  for  banks,  which  necessitates  that  central  banks  offer \nrefinancing lines, some of which can be offered at preferred terms. \n\n3.4.2  Minimum and Maximum Credit Quotas \n\nMandatory  or  minimum  or  maximum  credit  quotas  or  floors  are  fixed  lending  requirements \nthat  are  set  by  the  central  bank  and  require  commercial  banks  to  allocate  a  percentage  of \ntheir  loan  portfolio  to  specified  classes  of  assets,  industries,  or  geographical  areas.  Green \nminimum credit quotas, for example, require banks to lend at least a specified quota to green \ninvestments,  while  maximum  credit  ceilings  could  be  utilized  to  restrict  lending  to  carbon-\nintensive  industries.  In  contrast  to  all  policy  instruments  discussed  so  far,  the  operating \nchannel of credit quotas is not the creation of incentives for financial institutions to channel \ntheir  resources  to  preferred  causes,  but  a  mandatory  \u201chard\u201d  quota,  which  may  potentially \ncreate severe market distortions. \n\n3.4.3  Preferred Interest Rates for Priority Sectors \n\nCredit  interest  rate  ceilings  for  priority  sectors,  asset  classes,  and  firms  are  the  central \ninstruments of financial repression policy. The administrative setting of interest rates by the \ncentral bank of commercial banks\u2019 lending rate with the aim of promoting green investment \nand curbing unsustainable lending is another heavy interventionist central banking tool that \nis \nsetting  \nof lower rates for preferred sectors or higher rates for less preferred ones in order to reduce \nfunding. \n\nincentives, \n\ncreating \n\ninstead \n\ntargets \n\naimed \n\nthe \n\nbut \n\nnot \n\nat \n\n3.4.4  Central Bank Assistance to Development Banks \n \nAs specialized financial institutions, development banks can play an important assisting role \nin financing the green transformation by providing long-term investment (Stern 2016; UNEP \nInquiry 2016). The failure of private financial institutions to provide the required financial \nresources for substantial investments into greening the economy has been interpreted as \njustification for the presence of development banks. The latter may play a risk-reducing and \npioneering role by implementing green finance standards or by developing innovative \nfinancial products such as green bonds, thereby encouraging private institutions to engage \nin green lending and long-term finance activities. Historically, central banks have often \nplayed a supportive role for development banks by subscribing to the initial equity or by \nbuying and creating markets for bonds issued by development banks (Brimmer 1971). \nHowever, concerns have been raised that refinancing of public development banks by \ncentral banks may amount to monetary financing, which may cause inflation and undermine \ncentral bank independence. \n\n3.4.5  Green Credit Allocation in Practice \n\nBangladesh  Bank  has  introduced  several  policy  initiatives  to  guide  credit  toward  green \nsectors and to encourage banks to extend loans for renewable energy projects. Among the \ngreen credit allocation programs of Bank Bangladesh, targeted refinancing lines have been \nthe  most  prominent  policy  tool.  They  were  first  utilized  in  2009  when  Bangladesh  Bank \nestablished  a  revolving  refinancing  scheme  amounting  to  BDT  2  billion  through  which \ncommercial  banks  were  compensated  at  reduced  interest  rates  for  loans  extended  for \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nsustainable investment  projects (Bangladesh Bank 2017). Subsequently, Bangladesh Bank \nhas developed further green refinancing lines, such as in 2015, when it earmarked a $200 \nmillion  refinancing  window  for  refinancing  green  loans,  with  the  specific  aim  of  supporting \ninvestment  improving  water  and  energy  usage  (UNEP  Inquiry  et  al.  2015)  and  in  2016, \nthrough  the  creation  of  a  Green  Transformation  Fund,  another  green  refinancing  window \nworth  $200  million  targeting  loans  that  finance  the  import  of  environmentally  friendly \nmachinery  in  order  to  improve  sustainability  in  the  leather  and  textiles  sector  (Bangladesh \nBank 2017). \n\nThe RBI\u2019s Priority Sector Lending (PSL) program, which has its origins in 1949, is another \nexample  of  a  heavily  interventionist  approach  to  credit  allocation.  The  PSL  forces \ncommercial banks to allocate 40% of adjusted net bank credit or credit equivalent amount of \noff-balance  sheet  exposure,  whichever  is  higher,  to  sectors  and  causes  specified  by  the \ncentral  bank  \u2013  traditionally  agriculture,  infrastructure,  education,  and  SMEs.  Following  an \ninternal  review  by  the  RBI,  the  PSL  was  extended  in  2015  to  include  lending  for  social \ninfrastructure  and  renewable  energy  projects  as  two  new  categories  qualifying  to  be  listed \nunder commercial banks\u2019 PSL requirements. \n\n3.5  Other Supportive Green Central Bank Initiatives \n\nThrough their central position in the financial system and the powers vested in them, central \nbanks  have  a  lot  of  convening  or  soft  power  (Volz  2017).  By  promoting  a  discussion  of \nclimate \ncentral  \nbank  can  drive  the  sustainability  agenda  in  the  financial  sector.  The  expertise  and  special \nstatus of central banks as a result of their unique relation to the government and the financial \nsector allow them to influence the discussion on green finance in informal ways. \n\nchange-related \n\nenvironmental \n\nissues, \n\nrisks \n\nand \n\nthe \n\n3.5.1  Green Finance Guidelines and Frameworks \n\nCentral  banks  are  in  a  good  position  to  create  or  endorse  industry-led,  non-mandatory, \ngreen finance guidelines, which may set out guidelines for the issuance of green bonds, E&S \nrisk-management  practices,  or  general  criteria  for  green  lending.  In  many  emerging  and \ndeveloping economies where green credit guidelines exist, these tend to be either voluntary \nindustry-led  green  finance  guidelines  or,  in  most  cases,  central  bank-led  ones  that  often \nserve  as  foundation  for  the  creation  of  mandatory  green  credit  regulation  at  a  later  stage \n(Dikau and Ryan-Collins 2017). \n\n3.5.2  Soft Power \n\nCentral  banks  can  also  influence  the  reception,  knowledge,  and  practice  of  green  finance \nthrough  its  convening  role  and  soft  power,  by  including  environmental  issues  and  climate \nchange  on  its  wider  agenda  and  signaling  the  importance  of  these  issues  to  market \nparticipants.  The  generally  well-respected  research  departments  of  central  banks  are \nfurthermore  uniquely positioned to research topics around green finance and the impact of \nclimate risks on the financial system. The research focus and output of central banks usually \nhas a huge impact on raising awareness of its issues and directing broader macroeconomic \nresearch.  Another  area  where  central  banks  can  contribute  to  the  knowledge  of  green \nfinance and threat of environmental risks are capacity-building workshops and seminars for \nbankers  and  investors,  thereby  addressing  a  potential  lack  of  expertise  on  green  financial \nissues, which has been identified as holding back the prevalence of E&S risk-management \npractices.  Finally,  the  participation  of  central  banks  in  international  bodies  and  networks, \nsuch as the Financial Stability Board and its TCFD, which discuss standards and methods of \npolicy  engagement,  also  play  an  important  role  in  finding  internationally  coherent \napproaches to greening the financial system. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\n3.5.3  Supportive Green Central Bank Initiatives in Practice \n\n\u201cBreaking \n\nin  2015  on \n\nThe Bank of England\u2019s engagement with climate change is an exemplar of a central bank\u2019s \nuse  of  soft  power  to  raise  awareness  of  climate  end  environmental  risks  for  the  financial \nthe  Tragedy  of  \nsector.  With  his  much-noticed  speech \nthe  Horizon  \u2013  Climate  change  and  financial  stability\u201d  (Carney  2015),  the  Governor  of  \nthe  Bank  of  England  brought  global  attention  to  the  potential  systemic  ramifications  \nof climate change-related risks for the financial system and especially the insurance sector, \nthereby  also  motivating  further  research  in  the  Bank  of  England\u2019s  research  department  on \nclimate change and green finance (Bank of England 2015; Batten et al. 2016), as well as the \norganization  of  workshops  and  conferences  on  the  issue.  The  Bank  of  England  also \nengages \nincluding  \nthe  TCFD,  as  well  as  taking  part  in  the  Sustainable  Investment  Forum  and  by  \nco-chairing  the  G20  Green  Finance  Study  Group  (which  was  recently  renamed  into  G20 \nSustainable Finance Study Group) that was established during the PRC\u2019s G20 presidency, \ntogether with the PBC. \n\ninternational \n\ninitiatives, \n\nnumber \n\nwith \n\nof \n\na \n\nNon-mandatory green finance guidelines, principles, or roadmaps that focus on sustainable \nbanking  have  so  far  been  issued  by  17  members  of  the  International  Finance  Corporation \n(IFC)\u2019s  Sustainable  Banking  Network,  a  knowledge  sharing  network  for  financial  regulators \nand  banking  associations  aiming  at  enhancing  E&S  risk-management  practices  and  green \nlending of financial institutions.1 Furthermore, in December 2017, central banks and financial \nsupervisors,  among  them  the  Bank  of  England,  the  Banque  de  France,  De  Nederlandsche \nBank,  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank,  the  European  Central  Bank,  the  Banco  de  Espa\u00f1a,  the \nNational Bank of Belgium, the OesterreichischeNationalbank and the PBC jointly created the \nNetwork  for  Greening  the  Financial  System  as  a  voluntary  information  and  best  practice \nsharing  framework  with  the  aim  of  mainstreaming  green  finance  and  more  sustainable \ngrowth.  This  network  potentially  represents  one  of  the  most  powerful  initiatives  to  date, \nbringing the largest and most influential monetary and regulatory institutions together under \nthe declared joint goal of supporting the transition toward more sustainable economies. \n\n4.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nClimate and other environmental risks have increasingly become important topics for central \nbanks and financial regulators. It is now largely accepted that environmental risks can have \nmaterial  impact  on  financial  and  macroeconomic  stability,  and  an  increasing  number  of \ncentral  banks  have  started  to  develop  micro-  and  macro-prudential  frameworks  that \nincorporate  risks  related  to  climate  change  and  the  environment.  At  a  recent  meeting  of \nfinancial  supervisors,  Bank  of  England  Governor  Mark  Carney  highlighted:  \u201cOnce  climate \nchange becomes a clear and present danger to financial stability, it may already be too late \n[\u2026].  Our  responsibility  is  to  work  in  a  way  that  puts  the  financial  system  as  a  whole  in  a \nposition  so  it  can  adjust  in  a  smooth  and  effective  and  orderly  fashion  as  climate  policies \nadapt\u201d (Hook 2018). Carney (2018) also reiterated that \u201c[t]he catastrophic impacts of climate \nchange will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors\u201d in the financial sector, and \nthat  central  banks  should  therefore  use  their  unique  position  and  oversight  over  financial \nmarkets  to  point  out  these  risks  and  make  sure  that  they  are  sufficiently  addressed  by \nfinancial  institutions.  The  paper  also  highlighted  the  potential  developmental  role  of  central \nbanks and reasoned why central banks, especially those in developing economies, may be \nmandated by governments to use various instruments at their disposal to promote green or \ndiscourage brown lending and investment. However, it needs to be emphasized that in many \ncases central banks may not be the public institutions that will be best positioned to correct \n\n                                                 \n1  The  17  members  include  financial  authorities  and  banking  associations  from  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Cambodia, \nthe PRC, Colombia, Equador, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico,  Mongolia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, South \nAfrica, Turkey, and Viet Nam. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nmarket  failures  that  lead  to  overinvestment  in  socially  undesirable  activities.  The  reader \nshould therefore not finish this piece with the impression that the authors want central banks \nto become responsible for fixing all environmental problems. Nevertheless, in cases where \nfirst-best policies are impossible to implement, targeted policy interventions by central banks \nor other financial regulators may indeed be considered and introduced. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 867 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nDikau and Volz \n\nBanco Central do Brasil. 2011.
