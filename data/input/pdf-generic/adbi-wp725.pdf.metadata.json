INTRODUCTION \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nMuch  of  the  discourse  on  malnutrition  in  India  has  understandably  focused  on \nundernutrition\u2014manifest  as  poor  anthropometric  outcomes,  especially  for  children,  or \ninadequate  intakes  of  food.  Yet,  the  country  has  also  seen  a  significant  rise  in \novernutrition and overweight/obesity in recent years. Interestingly, this latter trend is no \nlonger  a  predominantly  urban  phenomenon,  but  characterizes  many  rural  populations \nas well. Thus, India seems to be going through a nutrition transition, a term that refers \nto the processes of change in the food environment, physical activity, and lifestyle that \nresult  in  declining  levels  of  undernutrition  and  increasing  levels  of  overnutrition  over \ntime (Popkin1993). \n\nNationally  representative  surveys  conducted  during  2011-2013  suggest  that  the \nprevalence of overweight or obesity\u2014defined as the percentage of adults whose body \nmass  index  (BMI)  is  higher  than  25\u2014ranges  across  states  from  6%  to  31%  among \nwomen,  while  the  figures  for  rural  areas  are  5%  to  28%  (Meenakshi  2016).  These \nmagnitudes have been increasing rapidly over time. Being overweight or obese poses \nsignificant  risks  for  noncommunicable  diseases  (NCDs)  including  heart  disease  and \ndiabetes.  According  to  the  Global  Burden  of  Disease  study,  in  India,  the  number  \nof  disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)\u2014an  aggregate  measure  of  cause-specific \ndisease  burden  that  accounts  for  both  disability  and  premature  mortality\u2014lost  to \ndiabetes increased by nearly 40% between 2000 and 2012. Over the same period, the \nnumber of DALYs lost to heart disease increased by 20%, even as the overall number \nof DALYs lost due to disease decreased by nearly 9% (WHO 2016). \n\nThese increases in overweight and obesity and its health consequences are occurring \neven  as  the  magnitude  of  undernutrition  among  children  in  India,  despite  progress, \nremains high and is a continuing public health concern. In 2011\u20132013, the prevalence \nof underweight among preschool children ranged from 21% to 46% across states; the \ncorresponding range in rural areas was 23% to 49% (Meenakshi 2016). Undernutrition \namong young children is often irreversible, has consequences into adulthood, and may \nlead to the inter-generational transmission of malnutrition. \n\nWhile  this  double  burden  of  malnutrition\u2014the  coexistence  of  under-  and  over-\nnutrition\u2014may simply be a reflection of marked and increasing inequalities in economic \nand  social  access  to  resources  and  thus  refer  to  distinct  subpopulations,  studies \nsuggest  that  as  economies  develop,  undernutrition  among  children  and  overnutrition \namong adults often coexist within the same household (Garrett and Ruel 2005; Doak et \nal. 2002). For example, in many African and Asian countries, nearly 10% of households \nhave a stunted child and overweight mother pair; figures for Latin American countries \nare  higher  (Garrett  and  Ruel  2005).  This  phenomenon,  referred  to  as  the  intra-\nhousehold  dual  burden  of  malnutrition,  merits  further  study  since  it  is  clearly  not  an \nindication of socioeconomic inequalities in the aggregate, nor of inadequate access to \nfood  at  the  household  level  (since  adults  are  overnourished)  but  rather  reflects \ninequalities within the household in the distribution of food and other health resources. \nIn India, there are very few studies that have examined this phenomenon. \n\nThis provides the context for this study, which has two primary objectives. First, after a \nbrief review of literature presented in section 2, the paper quantifies the changes in the \nprevalence of overweight and obesity (using lower thresholds for BMI that are perhaps \nmore  appropriate  for  Asian  populations),  and  of  diabetes  and  hypertension  among \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nadults  (section  3).  The  focus  is  on  the  richer  states1 because  overweight  and  obesity  \nis  more  pronounced  in  these  states,  and  also  (though  not  exclusively)  on  women,  as \nthey  are  more  susceptible  than  men  to  being  overweight  or  obese  (see  for  example \nRamachandran 2014; Subramanian et al. 2009; Chhabra and Chhabra 2007; Kulkarni \net al., 2017). The second objective is to examine the extent and correlates of the intra-\nhousehold  double  burden  of  malnutrition  (section  4),  using  unit  record  data  from  the \nsecond wave of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS 2). Section 5 concludes. \n\n2.  THE LITERATURE ON OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY \n\nIN INDIA \n\nThere  is  extensive  literature  characterizing  overweight  and  obesity  in  developed \ncountries.  However,  the  literature  on  developing  countries  in  general,  and  on  India  \nin  particular,  is  relatively  limited  outside  of  studies  that  document  its  increasing \nprevalence.  The  focus  here  is  on  the  literature  on  India  that  examines  the \nsocioeconomic factors associated with overweight and obesity.  \n\nThe  primary  (and  perhaps  obvious)  explanation  for  increasing  BMI  is  the  imbalance \nbetween  energy  or  food  intakes  on  the  one  hand  and  energy  expenditures  through \nphysical activity on the other. But there is no evidence to suggest that average energy \nintake  in  India  has  increased.  In  fact,  energy  intakes  as  derived  from  consumer \nexpenditures  surveys  have  shown  a  secular  decline  over  time. While these  estimates \nare  known  to  suffer  from  significant  measurement  errors  (from  inadequate  capturing  \nof  processed  foods  and  meals  purchased  outside  the  home)  that  have  likely  only \nincreased  over  time,  the  reduction  in  average  intakes  is  also  documented  by  other \nsurveys. For instance, 24-hour dietary recall surveys\u2014considered the gold standard in \ndietary  assessment\u2014conducted  by  the  National  Nutrition  Monitoring  Bureau  (NNMB) \nfor rural areas also document a similar decline (see Ramachandran 2014). However, a \nreduction in average intakes is consistent with a rightward shift of the upper tail of the \ndistribution of energy intakes. Further, there has also been a change in the composition \nof  diets,  with  decreased  reliance  on  cereals,  but  an  increased  reliance  on  fats  and \nsugars (more details in Meenakshi 2016). \n\nIt has been argued that some of this reduction in intakes is explained by the declining \nneeds  for  energy  associated  with  (a)  improvements  in  infectious  diseases  and  (b)  a \nreduction  in  physical  activity  levels,  although  the  empirical  evidence  on  this  is  limited \n(see Deaton and Dr\u00e8ze 2009; Eli and Li, 2015). While it is clear that there has been an \nexpansion  in  the  use  of  labor-saving  devices  in  urban  areas,  it  is  not  evident  that  an \nexpansion of a similar magnitude has also occurred in rural areas. To what extent the \nmechanization  of  agriculture  has  led  to  the  substitution  of  women\u2019s  labor  is  also  not \nclear. But Ramachandran (2014) suggests that it is the rapid decline in physical activity \nlevels  accompanied  by  a  modest  decline  in  energy  intakes  that  is  responsible  for  the \nrapid increases in overnutrition. Similarly, Siddiqui and Donato (2016) argue that some \nstates  have  a  more  obesogenic 2 environment,  with  infrastructure  encouraging  more \nsedentary  behavior  and  a  rapid  expansion  in  the  availability  of  fast  foods  or  cultural \nfactors that stimulate overeating among some populations. \n\n                                                \n1   Richer states are defined as the 9 states with the lowest head count ratios of poverty in 2011\u201312. The \nstates  are  Karnataka,  West  Bengal,  Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  Haryana,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Punjab, \nHimachal Pradesh, and Kerala. \n\n2   The  term  \u201cobesogenic  environment\u201d  refers  to  \u201can environment that  promotes  gaining  weight  and  one \nthat  is  not  conducive  to  weight  loss\u201d  within  the  home  or  workplace  (Swinburn  et  al.  1999).  In  other \nwords, the obesogenic environment refers to an environment that contributes to obesity. \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nThe  literature  also  suggests  that  socioeconomic  status  (as  reflected  in  wealth  or \nincome levels as well as educational attainment) is a strong predictor of overweight and \nobesity (in a direction opposite to that found in developed countries; in the latter case \nobesity is associated with poverty). Griffiths and Bentley (2001) found that households \nwith  high-income  or  more  education,  and  women  pursuing  sedentary  occupations,  or \nwatching  television  more  than  once  a  week,  were  all  factors  associated  with  women \nbeing  overweight  or  obese;  and  that  socioeconomic  status  was  the  most  important \npredictor of women\u2019s nutrition status, not rural or urban residence. Subramanian et al. \n(2009) also report a strong and positive association between socioeconomic status and \nBMI  for  women.  More  recently,  Kulkarni  et  al.  (2017)  also  find  that  overweight  and \nobesity  is  largely  concentrated  among  high-income  groups  and  that  the  relationship \nbetween socioeconomic status and the risk of being overweight or obese is stronger in \nurban than in rural areas. A distinguishing feature of this paper is the explicit inclusion \nof relative prices of food (to capture diet choices): they find that these play an important \nrole in determining the probability of being underweight as well as overweight or obese. \nFurthermore,  Ackerson  et  al.  (2008)  find  that  after  accounting  for  individual  factors, \nneighborhood wealth was independently and positively related with BMI and the risk of \nbeing  overweight  among  women.  Gaiha  et  al.  (2011)  find  that  increasing  age  and \ngrowing affluence are key factors in explaining the prevalence of NCDs in India. \n\nSimilarly, there appears to be a positive association between education and overweight \namong women, as noted for example by Griffiths and Bentley (2001) and Kulkarni et al. \n(2014). While this finding may seem contradictory to the role of education in enabling \ngood  health  found  in  developed  countries,  it  is  likely  that  the  positive  association  \nis  a  reflection  of  the  low  levels  of  education  in  India  in  general,  and  the  correlation \nbetween income and educational attainment. For example, Siddiqui and Donato (2016) \nfind  a  nonlinear  relationship  between  education  and  overnutrition,  where  increasing \neducation translates into a reduction in the likelihood of overweight and obesity after a \nthreshold; they suggest that this is indicative of weight-control behaviors among highly \neducated women.  \n\nIn addition to these household- and individual-level variables, Schmidhuber and Shetty \n(2005)  and  Popkin  et  al.  (2012)  suggest  that  the  macro-environment  also  matters,  \nwith  falling  relative  prices  of  food,  freer  trade,  and  globalization  all  leading  to  a  rapid \nnutrition transition. \n\nAnother strand  of  literature  highlights the  community-specific  and regional  variation  in \nthe  prevalence  of  overweight  and  obesity  in  India.  For  instance,  after  controlling  for \nsocioeconomic  status,  Muslim  women  and  Sikhs  appear  to  have  greater  likelihood  of \noverweight  and  obesity  as  compared  to  Hindus  (Siddiqui  and  Donato  2016;  Griffiths \nand Bentley 2001). Although they do not directly test for differences in dietary patterns \nacross  these  groups,  they  argue  that  differences  in  cultural  practices  related  to  food \nmay lead to these observed differences.  \n\nRegional variations are also highlighted by Siddiqui and Donato (2016), Kulkarni et al. \n(2014), and Ackerson et al. (2008), with some states in the north and far south seeing \nhigher  prevalences  (as  also  seen  below  in  section  3).  Even  within  these  regions, \nSengupta  et  al.  (2014)  find  that  in  Delhi,  Punjab,  and  Kerala,  the  problem  of \novernutrition  has  trickled  down  to  poorer,  rural,  and  less  educated  sections  of  \nthe population. \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nFinally,  one factor  that  is  perhaps  particular to  economies that  have traditionally  dealt \nwith hunger and undernourishment is the role played by inadequate nutrition in utero or \nin  infancy.  The  literature  suggests  that  this  stimulates  a  set  of  anatomical,  hormonal, \nand  physiological  changes  that  enhance  survival  in  a  \u201cresource  poor\u201d  environment. \nHowever,  in  a  postnatal  environment  with  plentiful  resources,  these  developmental \nadaptations may increase susceptibility to obesity and chronic diseases (Popkin 1994; \nPopkin et al. 2012). \n\n3.  THE MAGNITUDE OF OVERWEIGHT, OBESITY,  \n\nAND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES \n\nThe recently conducted fourth round of the District Level Household Survey, 2012\u201313 \n(DLHS4) highlights the high prevalence of overnutrition in India. Although designed to \nbe  representative  at  the  district  level  (districts  are  subunits  of  states), the  survey  was \nimplemented only in selected states,3 which are, by and large, among the richer states \nin the country and account for about 38% of the rural and 54% of the urban population \n(according to the 2011 census). This section focuses only on these states as a rise in \novernutrition is more likely to be apparent in the more well-off states. To track changes \nover  time,  unit record  data from the  second  and third  National  Family  Health  Surveys \n(NFHS2 and NFHS3), for the years 1998-99 and 2005-06 are also used. \n\nGlobally,  a  BMI  benchmark  of  25  is  used  to  determine  whether  individuals  are \noverweight, and of 30 to determine obesity. For India, there is reason, however, to use \nlower benchmarks, as Asians appear to be at risk of NCDs at lower levels of BMI than \nother  populations  as  they  have  a  higher  percentage  of  body  fat  than  (for  example) \nEuropean  populations  of  the  same  age,  sex,  and  BMI  (see  Yajnik  2002;  Zhou  2002). \nThe  WHO  has  identified  23  kg/m2  and  27.5  kg/m2  as  additional  trigger  points  for \npotential public health action along the continuum of BMI (WHO 2004).  \n\nFigures  1  and  2  use  unit  record  data  from  the  DLHS4,  NFHS2,  and  NFHS3  surveys  \nto  compute  the  percentage  of  adult  women  whose  BMI  exceeds  23  and  27.5, \nrespectively. 4  States  are  arranged  in  decreasing  order  of  proportion  of  population \nbelow  poverty  line  using  poverty  estimates  of  2011\u201312.  For  almost  all  (the  richer) \nstates more than 20% of women have a BMI greater than 23. Kerala shows the highest \nprevalence,  which  increased  from  36%  in  1998\u201399  to  48%  in  2012\u201313.  Despite \nregional differences in the level of overweight and obesity, it is apparent that all these \nstates  have  seen  a  rise  in  the  proportion  of  obese  women  with  BMI  exceeding  27.5 \n(Figure 2).  \n\nThe problem of overnutrition has percolated to rural areas as well: by 2012\u201313 all the \nstates  considered  here  had  at  least  20%  of  rural  women  with  BMI  more  than  23 \n(Figure 1B). The increases between 2005\u201306 and 2012\u201313 were particularly dramatic. \nIf  the  higher  BMI  cutoff  of  25  is  used,  in  states  such  as  Kerala,  the  prevalence  \nof  overweight  or  obesity  in  2012\u201313  was  30%  (as  compared  with  48%  using  the  \n23  threshold),  suggesting  that  there  is  a  substantial  mass  in  the  distribution  of  BMI \nbetween 23 and 25\u2014a pattern seen in nearly all other states. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n3   The  remaining states  were  covered  by  the  Annual  Health  Survey  conducted by  the  Registrar  General  \n\n4   Trends  in  the magnitudes  of overweight  and  obesity  using the conventional  cutoffs, and for  all states, \n\nof India. \n\nare discussed in Meenakshi (2016). \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nThat overnutrition is not only an urban phenomenon is borne out by other data as well. \nSurveys by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) have tracked heights and \nweights  over  time  in  rural  areas  of  10  states.  Using  this  data,  Ramachandran  (2014) \nnotes  that  while  less than  5%  of adults  were  either  overweight  or  obese  in  the  1970s \nand 1980s, by 2004\u201305, this figure had grown to nearly 11% of women and 8% of men \n(NNMB  2006),  figures  that  are  comparable  in  magnitude  to  those  reported  by  the \nNFHS3  for  2005-06.  As  noted  above,  in  less  than  10  years,  these  figures  nearly \ndoubled in most states.  \n\nFigure 1A: Percent of Adult Women Overweight/Obese (using BMI>=23),  \nby State, Overall \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1B: Percent of Adult Women Overweight/Obese (using BMI>=23),  \nby State, Rural \n\nNote: Data refer to women aged 15 to 49 years. \n\nSource:  1998\u201399  and  2005\u201306  data  are  computed  from  the  unit\nrecord  data  of  the  second  and  third  rounds  of  \nthe  National  Family  Health  Survey;  2012\u201313  data  are  from  the  fourth  round  of  the  District  Level  Household  and  \nFacility Survey.  \n\n\u2010\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nAlso, there is clear evidence of regional differences in magnitudes of overnutrition even \nwithin this subset of richer states, although there is a weak (negative) correlation with \npoverty levels. Punjab in the north and Kerala in the south have the highest proportions \nof adult women with BMI greater than 23, in both rural and urban areas. These regional \ndifferences  have  been  highlighted  in  other  studies  as  well,  including  Ackerson  et  al. \n(2008) and Sengupta et al. (2014) as noted in section 2. \n\nFigure 2A: Percent of Adult Women Obese (using BMI>=27.5), by State, Overall \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2B: Percent of Adult Women Obese (using BMI>=27.5), by State, Rural \n\nNote: Data refer to women aged 15 to 49 years \n\nSource:  1998\u201399  and  2005\u201306  data  are  computed  from  the  unit\nrecord  data  of  the  second  and  third  rounds  of  \nthe  National  Family  Health  Survey;  2012\u201313  data  are  from  the  fourth  round  of  the  District  Level  Household  and  \nFacility Survey.  \n\n\u2010\n\nThe  magnitudes  presented  here  not  age-standardized.  Over  the  period  2005\u20132006  to \n2012\u20132013, there was a shift in the age distribution of adult women toward older age \ngroups.  In  2005\u20132006  about  47%  of  urban  and  rural  women  were  above  the  age  of \n30 years, but by 2012\u20132013 these figures had changed to 52% and 50%, respectively. \nThus  a  part  of  the  increase  in  magnitude  of  overweight  and  obesity  may  simply  be  a \nreflection  of  an  aging  population,  because  body  metabolism  tends  to  decrease  with \nage, leading to increased weight and BMI. To examine if this is the case, Figure 3 plots \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nthe distribution of BMI for women who are 20, 25, 30, and 40 years old over this time \nperiod, taking advantage of the relatively large size of sample in both the NFHS3 and \nDLHS4 surveys. While there was little change in the distribution of BMI of 20-year-old \nwomen,  all  older  age  groups  saw  a  systematic  increase  in  BMIs. 5  On  average,  \nthe prevalence of overweight and obesity increased by 3% for 30-year-old women and \n2%  for  40-year-old  women,  figures  not  very  different  from  the  4%  increase  seen  \n(on average) in the age-unadjusted prevalences of overweight and obesity. \n\nFigure 3: Changes in the Probability Density Function of BMI of Adult Women, \n2005\u20132006 to 2012\u20132013, by Age Group \n\n \n\nNote: Both years refer to women aged 15 to 49 years. \n\nSource:  Computed  from  the  unit\nfourth round of the District Level Household and Facility Survey (2012\u201313). \n\nrecord  data  of  third  round  of  the  National  Family  Health  Survey  (2005\u201306)  and  the \n\n\u2010\n\nThe  NNMB  surveys  also  provide  information  on  other  anthropometric  indicators  of \novernutrition,  including  the  waist\u2013hip  ratio  (WHR),  with  a  WHR  of  greater  than  0.8 \nbeing  indicative  of  abdominal  obesity  (Willett  et  al.  1999;  Huxley  et  al.  2008;  note \nhowever that the WHO 2011 uses a higher cutoff of 0.85).

The  WHO  Global  Report  on \nDiabetes (2016) notes \u201cIn the past three decades, the prevalence (age-standardized) of \ndiabetes has risen substantially\u2026.mirroring the global increase in the number of people \nwho are overweight or obese\u2026.Over the past decade, diabetes prevalence has grown \nfaster in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries\u201d (p. 26). Each \nyear, nearly 7% of deaths in India are related to diabetes. Not surprisingly, given these \nmagnitudes,  these  health  issues  not  only  are  prevalent  in  urban  areas,  they  are \nbecoming common in rural areas as well. \n\nTable 1 presents data from DLHS4 on the prevalence of pre-diabetes or diabetes\u2014as \ncaptured  by  the  percentage  of  adults  whose  random  blood  sugar  levels  exceed \n140 mg/dl.

An  NNMB  survey \nconducted  the  year  before  and  using  a  cutoff  of  fasting  blood  glucose  levels  of \n126 mg/dl, an indication of Type 2 diabetes, found that approximately 8% of men and \n7%  of  women  (including  new  and  old  cases)  were  diabetic.  There  are  no  significant \ndifferences by gender. \n\nTable 1: Percent of Adults with Random Blood Sugar Levels Greater Than \n140 mg/dl, Rural Areas, by State and Gender, 2012\u20132013 \n\nRandom Blood Sugar Level above 140 mg/dl \n\n \n\n \n\nKerala \nHimachal Pradesh \nWest Bengal \nHaryana \nPunjab \nMaharashtra \nTamil Nadu \nKarnataka \nAndhra Pradesh \n\nMale \n26 \n18 \n16 \n14 \n13 \n13 \n12 \n9 \n8 \n\nFemale \n24 \n16 \n14 \n13 \n14 \n11 \n11 \n8 \n7 \n\nSource: State reports of the fourth round of the District Level Household and Facility Survey. \n\nHypertension  is  also  a  significant  problem.

MAGNITUDE OF THE INTRA-HOUSEHOLD DUAL \n\nBURDEN OF UNDERWEIGHT CHILDREN  \nAND OVERWEIGHT MOTHERS (UC-OM)  \n\nAs noted earlier, the coexistence of overweight women and underweight children within \na household suggests that more than resource constraints, it is intra-household equity \nthat matters. In other words, the causal pathways that lead to such an intra-household \ndual  burden  of  malnutrition  can  be  very  different  from  those  that  characterize  the \npopulation-level  dual  burden.  Hence,  the  intra-household  double  burden  merits  a \nseparate analysis, from that which considers the population level dual burden.  \n\nUnit  record  data  from  the  first  (2004\u201305)  and  second  (2011\u201312)  waves  of  the  India \nHuman  Development  Surveys  (IHDS)  may  be  used  to  quantify  the  magnitude  of  the \ndual burden of malnutrition. A dual burden household may be defined as one that has \nan underweight child (a preschool child younger than 60 months with a weight-for-age \nless than 2 standard deviations of the median of the age-specific reference population) \nand  an  overweight  mother 6 (with  a  BMI  greater  than  23  kg/m2  following  the  lower \ncutoffs for Asian populations), abbreviated as UC-OM. \n\nTable  3  shows  that  the  percentage  of  households  with  overweight  or  obese  mothers \nhas increased from 15% in 2004\u201305 to 20% in 2011\u201312 in rural areas, while in urban \nareas it increased from 31% to 41%. Over the same time period, there was a decrease \nin  the  proportion  of  households  with  underweight  children  in  both  urban  and  rural \nareas,  although  one-third  of  rural  households  and  one-quarter  of  urban  households \ncontinue  to  have  underweight  children.  These  figures  are  consistent  with  those \nreported in other surveys. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n6   A similar definition of has been used by Barnett (2011) and Jehn and Brewis (2009). It is also common \nto define a dual burden household as one that has a stunted (compromised height) child, but since there \nwas significant measurement error in the data on child heights in this survey of children, it is not used. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nTable 3: Cross-Tabulation of Households by Child and Mother\u2019s Anthropometric \nOutcomes, by Region of Residence, 2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312  \n(percent of households) \n\n \n\nNormal \nWeight \nChild \n\n2004\u201305 \nUnder- \nweight \nChild \nRural Areas \n\nTotal \n\nNormal \nWeight \nChild \n\n2011\u201312 \nUnder- \nweight \nChild \n\nUnderweight mother \nNormal weight mother \nOverweight/Obese \nmother \nTotal \nNumber of observations  \n\nUnderweight mother \nNormal weight mother \nOverweight/Obese \nmother \nTotal \nNumber of observations \n\n15 \n34 \n10 \n\n60 \n\n12 \n33 \n24 \n\n69 \n\n40 \n6,303 \n\nUrban Areas \n\n16 \n20 \n4 \n\n8 \n15 \n6 \n\n31 \n3,160 \n\n32 \n54 \n15 \n\n100 \n\n21 \n48 \n31 \n\n100 \n\n17 \n33 \n15 \n\n64 \n\n10 \n30 \n33 \n\n74 \n\n36 \n5,150 \n\n14 \n16 \n5 \n\n7 \n11 \n8 \n\n26 \n2,411 \n\nTotal \n\n31 \n49 \n20 \n\n100 \n\n17 \n42 \n41 \n\n100 \n\nNotes: Data refer to children aged 0 to 5 years and mothers aged 15 to 49 years.

Another way to interpret these figures is to note \nthat one-fifth (urban) to one-quarter (rural) of all households with an overweight mother \nhad  an  underweight  child.  suggesting  that  intra-household  inequality  in  resource \nallocations may be important.7  \n\nMight  this  problem  be  more  severe  for  the  relatively  more  affluent  states  which  saw \ngreater increases in the proportion of overweight mothers and more modest declines in \nunderweight  children?  Table  4  suggests  that  this  is  indeed  the  case  in  nine  richer \nstates,  with  7%  and  10%  of  rural  and  urban  households  having  a  UC-OM  pair  in  \n2011\u201312 respectively. \n\nThe  phenomenon  of  the  coexistence  of  an  underweight  child  and  overweight  mother \nhas  been  observed  in  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries  including  Kenya, \nBangladesh,  Guatemala,  Ghana,  and  Peru.

The literature suggests that prevalence of dual burden is associated with older \nmaternal age, maternal short stature, and increasing family size (Oddo et al. 2012; Lee \net al. 2010; Jehn and Brewis 2009). Education of the mother appears to be protective \nagainst the intra-household dual burden in Indonesia, but the reverse appears to be the \ncase in Bangladesh (Oddo et al. 2012). \n\nSimilarly,  household  wealth  is  positively  associated  with  the  prevalence  of  the  double \nburden  of  malnutrition,  suggesting  that  lack  of  access  to  adequate  food  is  not  a \nconstraint  (Lee  et  al.  2012).  However,  some  studies  do  not  find  any  association  with \nwealth at all (see for example Lee et al. 2010). A cross country analysis by Jehn and \nBrewis  (2009)  looked  at  this  phenomenon  in  19  lower-  and  middle-income  countries \nand found it to be less prevalent in countries with lower  wealth. Similarly, Garrett and \nRuel (2005), analysing data from several countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, \nfind that the phenomenon increases with GDP per capita up to a point.  \n\nLeroy et al. (2014) explore the interaction between education and household wealth in \nexplaining  the  prevalence  of  stunted  child\u2013overweight  mother  households  in  Mexico. \nThey  find  that  household  wealth  was  significantly  associated  with  increases  in  the \nprevalence  of  double  burden  pairs  only  among  mothers  who  had  not  completed \nprimary school. They argue that among more educated mothers, wealth is associated \nwith both increases in child height and an absence of undesirable weight gain among \nmothers, and hence maternal education could mitigate the negative effect of increasing \nhousehold income on dual burden households. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nSome studies for China, India, and Vietnam find urban residence to be associated with \nthe  phenomenon  of  intra-household  dual  burden  (Doak  et  al.  2000;  Barnett  2011), \nwhile  Lee  et  al.  (2012)  find  it  to  be  a  rural  phenomenon  in  Guatemala.  However,  an \nanalysis for several countries by Garrett and Ruel (2005) finds that it is not necessarily \nassociated with urbanization.  \n\nAnalyses  of  the  intra-household  dual  burden  that  focus  on  India  include  VanderKloet \n(2008) and Barnett (2011), who both use the Young Lives dataset for Andhra Pradesh. \nVanderKloet  (2008)  looks  at  households  with  an  overweight  mother  and  adolescents \n(11\u201313  years  old)  and  finds  that  male,  prepubertal  children,  non-immunised  children, \nand  those  with  a  small  maternal  support  network  were  more  likely  to  be  in  UC-OM \nhouseholds  than  in  households  with  a  non-underweight  child  and  an  overweight \nmother.  Barnett  (2011)  considers  the  prevalence  of  households  with  an  overweight \nmother and a stunted child, and an overweight mother with an underweight child aged \n4.5\u20135.5 years, and finds that households living in urban areas are more likely to have \nthese  pairs,  while  VanderKloet  (2008)  finds  location  to  have  weak  association.  Note, \nhowever,  that  the  Young  Lives  dataset  oversampled  poor  households  and  may  thus \nhave underestimated the magnitude of the phenomenon.  \n\nThis  paper  attempts  to  contribute  to  this  limited  literature  by  examining  correlates  of \nhouseholds  with  an  underweight  child  aged  less  than  60  months  and  an  overweight \nmother (UC-OM) using a nationally representative dataset.  \n\n5.  FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRA-\n\nHOUSEHOLD DUAL BURDEN OF MALNUTRITION  \n\nBoth binary and multinomial logit regression models are used to identify the predictors \nof  dual  burden  (UC-OM)  households.  In  the  binary  case,  all  other  households  are  \nthe  reference  group,  whereas  in  the  multinomial  logit,  the  various  socioeconomic  \nand  behavioral  factors  that  are  associated  with  households  that  have  UC-OM,  an \nunderweight  child  and  non-overweight  mother  (UC-NOM),  and  a  non-underweight  \nchild  and  overweight  mother  (NUC-OM)  are  examined  using  households  with  a  \nnon-underweight  child  and  non-overweight  mother  (NUC-NOM)  as  the  reference \ncategory. The analysis is conducted both at the all-India level and also for a subset of \nnine better-off states to see whether the risk factors vary across the two.8 \n\nBased on the review in the previous sections as well as literature that pertains to other \ndeveloping  countries,  the  following  covariates  are  included,  with  some  variation  in \nalternative specifications, as noted in the tables. \n\nChild  characteristics:  In  addition  to  demographic  characteristics  of  the  child\u2019s  age  \n(in  months)  and  its  gender,  two  dichotomous  measures  of  the  health  of  the  child  are \nused: first, whether the child had diarrhea during the month preceding the survey; and \nsecond, whether the child was fully immunized for a given age. Low birth weight is also \na  strong  predictor  of  poor  nutritional  outcomes for  children  (see for  example Wardlaw \n2004); this is captured by a subjective assessment by the child\u2019s mother of whether the \nchild was average or above average in size when born, in comparison to children who \nwere  born  with  a  below-average  size  at  birth  (reference  category).  Although  it  would \nhave  been  ideal  to  have  some  indicator  of  child-specific  food  intakes,  this  data  is  \nnot available. \n\n                                                \n8   A likelihood ratio test of no differences in coefficients in the richer states as compared to all states was \n\nrejected. \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nMaternal  characteristics:  Mother\u2019s  age  (and  a  squared  term  in  age  to  capture \nnonlinearities)  is  included,  as  the  literature  suggests  weight  gain  first  increases  \n(as  metabolism  slows  with  age  and  results  in  weight  gain)  and  then  decreases  with \nage. There are studies showing a positive association between parity and weight gain \ndue  to  pregnancy  and the  onset  of obesity  in  women (Brown  et  al.  1992; Wolfe  et  al. \n1997); as a proxy we include the number of children in the household. \n\nMaternal  education  has  been  linked  to  child  malnutrition  (negatively)  and  also  to \novernutrition  among  women.  To  capture  this,  mother\u2019s  education  is  categorised  into \nfour levels: none, primary education (1\u20135 years in school), upper primary (6\u20138 years), \nand  higher  secondary  and  above  (9  or  more  years);  no  education  is  the  reference \ncategory.  Mother\u2019s  occupational  status  is  also  included  in  the  analysis  under  the \nassumption  that  mothers  who  are  working  in  blue  collar  jobs  (used  as  the  reference \ncategory)  would  have  more  active  lifestyles  than  mothers  who  are  not  working  or \nmothers in white collar jobs.9 Mother\u2019s height is also included as a continuous variable, \nas  maternal  short  stature  is  a  marker  of  malnutrition  in  early  life  and  has  been \nassociated with increased BMI; also undernourished mothers have a higher probability \nof having malnourished children (Ferreira et al. 2009; Sichieri et al. 2003; Victora et al. \n2008).  Although  education  and  occupational  choice  may  be  related,  they  may  be \nexpected to have independent influences on both adult and child nutritional status, and \nhence are included separately. \n\nLifestyle factors as captured by the number hours spent on watching television are also \nincluded,  with  a  dummy  variable  with  value  1  if  women  watch  more  than  2  hours  of \ntelevision a day, and 0 if they watch for fewer hours.  \n\nHousehold  characteristics:  Household  income  is  captured  by  including  household \nexpenditure  quintiles  as  covariates.  Lastly,  place  of  residence  (rural  or  urban)  is  \nalso included. \n\nThus,  given  a  vector  of  child  characteristics \n for  household \nhousehold  characteristics \nburden of malnutrition may be specified as: \n\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\n\n,  maternal  characteristics \n\n,  and \n,  a  model  of  the  intra-household  double \n\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 \n\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc56\n\n\ud835\udc56\n\n \n\n\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\n\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\n\n\ud835\udc61 =   \ud835\udefd0 +   \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56 +   \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 +   \ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc56 , for \ud835\udc60 \u2260 \ud835\udc61\n\nwhere the probability of household i having a pair s is denoted by \n\n  \n\nIn a binary logit model s = UC-OM and t refers to all other households (that do not have \na  UC-OM  pair).

In  other  words,  using  NUC-NOM  as  the \nreference  pair,  the  multinomial  logit  regressions  are  estimated  for  the  UC-OM,  \nUC-NOM, and NUC-OM households.  \n\n.\n\n\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc56\n\nThe  estimation  sample  is  drawn  from  the  IHDS2  dataset  (for  2011\u201312).  Given  that \nthere  are  rural\u2013urban  differences  in  the  magnitudes  of  overweight,  obesity,  and  dual \nburden  households,  and  that  the  factors  that  drive  them  may  vary  across  rural  and \nurban  areas,  these  models  were  first  estimated  separately  by  region.  However,  a \nlikelihood  ratio  test  indicated  that  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  rural\u2013urban  differences  in \n\n                                                \n9   A mother is classified as working in a white collar job if she is a scientist, director, manager, economist, \nteacher, clerk or related worker, sales worker, merchant, shopkeeper, salesperson, etc. She is classified \nas  working  in  a  blue  collar  job  if  her  occupation  is  agriculture  and  plantation  laborer,  cultivator, \nproduction  laborer,  bricklayer,  construction  worker,  miner  or  related  worker,  or  a  service  worker  \n(maid, cook, or sweeper). \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\ncoefficients could not be rejected across all specifications. For this reason, results are \npresented  only  for  the  pooled  model  below,  although  as  noted  above,  a  dummy \nvariable to represent region of residence is included. All standard errors are clustered \nat the primary sampling unit.  \n\nTable  5  presents  the  odds  ratio  of  the  predictors  from  the  binary  logistic  model  on  \nUC-OM  for  both  richer  and  all  states,  and  for  two  specifications.  For  all  states,  and \nacross  both  specifications,  only  two  child-level  factors\u2014birth  size  and  age\u2014are \nsignificant predictors of UC-OM. A child who was large or average at the time birth has \n29% lower odds of being UC-OM as compared to a child who was very small or small \nin size; similarly, older children are more likely to belong to a UC-OM pair. However, for \nthe subset of richer states, none of the child-level characteristics seem to matter.  \n\nAmong  maternal  characteristics,  for  all  states,  relative  to  other  households,  taller \nmothers are less likely to have underweight child and to be overweight; this result is in \nline  with  other  studies  that  found  similar  associations  (Oddo  et  al.  2012;  Lee  et  al. \n2010). Older mothers and mothers who watch more than 2 hours of television are also \nmore  likely  to  be  overweight  and  have  an  underweight  child  compared  to  other \nhouseholds.  The  insignificance  of  the  quadratic  term  in  age  perhaps  reflects  the  fact \nthat mothers with preschool children are not likely to be old enough for curvature in the \nrelationship with age to matter. \n\nThe  dual  burden  is  more  likely  to  occur  in  households  where  mothers  have  some \nformal  education  relative  to  households  where  mothers  have  no  education;  this  is \nsimilar  to  findings  by  Oddo  et  al.  (2012)  for  Bangladesh  and  Wong  et  al.  (2015)  for \nMalaysia. However, occupation does not seem to exert any independent effect on the \nprobability  of  a  household  having  a  UC-OM  pair.  Many  of  these  covariates  are, \nhowever,  insignificant  when  the  subset  of  richer  states  is  considered:  only  mother\u2019s \nheight  and  the  number  of  children  are  significant  in  predicting  familial  coexistence  of \nunderweight  child  and  maternal  overweight.  This  may  reflect  the  well-known  positive \nassociation  of  weight  gain  with  each  pregnancy  and  also  that  higher  parity  is \nassociated with child undernutrition, and is in line with what Lee et al. (2010) found. \n\nFinally,  households  in  wealthier  quintiles  relative  to  households  in  the  lowest  quintile \nappear  to  be  more  vulnerable  to  the  double  burden  of  malnutrition.  For  example, \nhouseholds in the fifth quintile have a 139% higher chance of having UC-OM pairs as \ncompared to households in the lowest quintile in richer states, while the corresponding \nfigure for all states is 49%, and is consistent with other studies (for example, Lee et al. \n2012; Doak et al. 2005). As expected, urban residents have higher likelihood of having \nUC-OM pairs relative to rural residents.  \n\nTo examine if the covariates associated with being a UC-OM household vary if, instead \nof a comparison group of all other households, a multinomial approach is used in which \nthe factors associated with belonging to UC-OM, UC-NOM, and NUC-OM households \nare  examined  simultaneously,  with  the  reference  category  of  NUC-NOM  household. \nRelative risk ratios from the MNL using the first specification are presented in Table 6,10 \nwhile  Table  7  does  the  same  for  the  more  parsimonious  specification.  As  before, \nvariants  that  contain  observations for  all  states, and  a  subset  of the  richer states,  are \npresented separately. \n\n \n\n                                                \n10  The models were tested for the validity of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumptions \nusing  the  Hausman  test,  which  failed  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis  of  independence  irrelevant \nalternatives, suggesting that the MNL specification is appropriate.  \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nTable 5: Odds Ratios for Covariates from a Logit Regression of the Probability  \nof a UC-OM Household, Alternative Specifications \n\nRicher States \n\nAll States \n\nSpecification 1  Specification 2  Specification 1  Specification 2 \n\nDependent Variable: \nProbability that a \nHousehold has a  \nUC-OM Pair \n\nAge (in months) \n \nGender (girl) \n \nDiarrhea last month \n \nFully immunized  \n \nBirth size \n \nNumber of children \n \nHeight (in meters) \n \nAge (in years) \n \nAge square \n \nMore than 2 hours of TV \n \nPrimary education \n \nUpper primary  \n \nHigher secondary and above \n  \nNot working \n \nWhite collar jobs \n \nExpenditure quintile 2 \n \nExpenditure quintile 3 \n \nExpenditure quintile 4 \n \nExpenditure quintile 5 \n \nUrban residence \n \nN \n\n1.000 \n(0.005) \n0.937 \n(0.141) \n0.640 \n(0.201) \n0.980 \n(0.157) \n0.839 \n(0.169) \n1.186** \n(0.101) \n0.943*** \n(0.012) \n1.208 \n(0.164) \n0.998 \n(0.002) \n1.058 \n(0.163) \n1.127 \n(0.357) \n1.181 \n(0.341) \n1.181 \n(0.343) \n1.033 \n(0.218) \n0.990 \n(0.351) \n3.211*** \n(1.427) \n2.161* \n(0.960) \n2.715** \n(1.207) \n2.399* \n(1.097) \n1.614** \n(0.305) \n2,543 \n\n1.009** \n(0.004) \n0.999 \n(0.115) \n1.078 \n(0.185) \n1.091 \n(0.132) \n0.713** \n(0.101) \n1.087 \n(0.066) \n0.950*** \n(0.009) \n1.204* \n(0.126) \n0.998 \n(0.002) \n1.277** \n(0.149) \n1.423* \n(0.289) \n1.561** \n(0.299) \n1.403 \n(0.293) \n1.137 \n(0.176) \n1.446 \n(0.362) \n1.576** \n(0.339) \n1.206 \n(0.272) \n1.466* \n(0.331) \n1.461 \n(0.348) \n1.478*** \n(0.208) \n5,527 \n\n1.009** \n(0.004) \n0.996 \n(0.115) \n \n \n \n \n0.713** \n(0.101) \n1.077 \n(0.065) \n0.950*** \n(0.009) \n1.208* \n(0.126) \n0.998 \n(0.002) \n1.276** \n(0.150) \n1.456* \n(0.296) \n1.614** \n(0.311) \n1.490* \n(0.309) \n \n \n \n \n1.586** \n(0.341) \n1.217 \n(0.274) \n1.496* \n(0.336) \n1.490* \n(0.353) \n1.532*** \n(0.199) \n5,527 \n\n1.000 \n(0.005) \n0.936 \n(0.141) \n \n \n \n \n0.855 \n(0.170) \n1.187** \n(0.100) \n0.943*** \n(0.011) \n1.207 \n(0.163) \n0.998 \n(0.002) \n1.055 \n(0.161) \n1.116 \n(0.352) \n1.167 \n(0.338) \n1.165 \n(0.339) \n \n \n \n \n3.202*** \n(1.421) \n2.164* \n(0.959) \n2.716** \n(1.206) \n2.406* \n(1.097) \n1.634*** \n(0.278) \n2,543 \n\n15 \n \n\nNotes:  UC-OM  =  underweight  child  and  overweight  mother.

Sedentary  lifestyles  (as  captured  by  the  number  of  hours  spent  watching \ntelevision) are likely to lead to lower odds of being UC-NOM. Mothers working in blue \ncollar jobs have more chances of being UC-NOM as compared to mothers who are not \nworking; this variable matters even after controlling for household income quintiles. Not \nunexpectedly,  richer  households  are  less  likely  to  have  a  UC-NOM  pair  compared  to \nNUC-NOM; however, area of residence does not seem to matter. Unlike the case with \nUC-OM,  there  are  no  major  differences  in  the  variables  that  are  significant  across  all \nstates  and  the  subset  of  richer  states;  they  are  also  robust  to  choice  of  specification \n(see Table 7). These results are similar to those of Jehn and Brewis (2009), who find \nthat  households  in  the  lowest  wealth  quintile  and  with  less  educated  mothers  have \nhigher risk of having an underweight child and a non-overweight mother. \n\nTable 7: Relative Risk Ratio for Covariates from a Multinomial Logit Regression \nof the Probability that a Household has a UC-OM, UC-NOM, or NUC-OM Pair \n(Relative to NUC-NOM), Alternate Specification \n\nVariables \n\nAge (in months) \n\nGender (girl) \n\nDiarrhea last month \n\nBirth size \n\nHeight (in meters) \n\nAge (in years) \n\nAge square \n\nPrimary education \n\nUpper primary \n\nNot working \n\nWhite collar jobs \n\nExpenditure quintile 2 \n\nExpenditure quintile 3 \n\nExpenditure quintile 4 \n\nExpenditure quintile 5 \n\nUrban residence \n\nN \n\nHigher secondary and above  \n\n(1) \nUC-OM \n\nAll States \n\n(2) \nUC-NOM \n\n(3) \nNUC-OM \n\nChild Characteristics \n(0.005) \n\n1.010** \n1.009 \n\n0.763 \n\n0.803 \n\n1.014*** \n1.011 \n1.485** \n0.738** \n\n(0.152) \n\n(0.243) \n\n(0.165) \n\nMaternal Characteristics \n0.927*** \n(0.012) \n1.218 \n\n0.963*** \n0.926 \n\n(0.155) \n\n0.998 \n\n1.200 \n\n1.136 \n\n1.175 \n\n1.175 \n\n1.197 \n\n(0.002) \n\n1.001 \n\n(0.354) \n\n0.987 \n\n(0.307) \n\n(0.314) \n\n(0.240) \n\n0.838 \n0.721**\n \n0.741*** \n\n(0.003) \n\n(0.107) \n\n(0.251) \n\n(0.098) \n\n(0.008) \n\n(0.081) \n\n(0.002) \n\n(0.175) \n\n(0.135) \n\n(0.114) \n\n(0.081) \n\n1.009*** \n1.007 \n1.351* \n1.375** \n\n0.970*** \n1.281** \n0.997* \n1.653** \n1.526** \n1.959***\n \n1.438*** \n1.630** \n\n(0.418) \n\n0.843 \n\n(0.225) \n\nHousehold Characteristics \n2.849*** \n0.976 \n(1.131) \n1.841 \n2.404** \n2.323** \n1.811*** \n\n0.853 \n0.721* \n0.715* \n1.032 \n\n(0.333) \n\n(0.924) \n\n(0.934) \n\n(0.727) \n\n(0.176) \n\n1.169 \n\n(0.150) \n\n(0.128) \n\n(0.138) \n\n(0.135) \n\n1.264 \n1.497** \n1.904*** \n1.604*** \n\n(0.003) \n\n(0.099) \n\n(0.232) \n\n(0.198) \n\n(0.008) \n\n(0.128) \n\n(0.002) \n\n(0.351) \n\n(0.286) \n\n(0.355) \n\n(0.174) \n\n(0.344) \n\n(0.258) \n\n(0.257) \n\n(0.297) \n\n(0.387) \n\n(0.182) \n\n2,877 \n\n2,877 \n\n2,877 \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nTable 7 continued \n\nAge (in months) \n\nGender (girl) \n\nDiarrhea last month \n\nBirth size \n\nHeight (in meters) \n\nAge (in years) \n\nAge square \n\nPrimary education \n\nUpper primary \n\nHigher secondary and above  \nNot working \n\nWhite collar jobs \n\nExpenditure quintile 2 \n\nExpenditure quintile 3 \n\nExpenditure quintile 4 \n\nExpenditure quintile 5 \n\nUrban residence \n\nN \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nVariables \n\n(4) \nUC-OM \n\nAll States \n\n(5) \nUC-NOM \n\n(6) \nNUC-OM \n\n1.012*** \n0.976 \n1.467*** \n0.714*** \n\nChild Characteristics \n(0.004) \n\n1.017*** \n1.072 \n\n(0.119) \n\n(0.251) \n\n(0.253) \n\n(0.002) \n\n(0.118) \n\n(0.090) \n\n(0.183) \n\n1.096 \n0.653*** \nMaternal Characteristics \n0.930*** \n(0.008) \n1.167 \n\n0.999 \n1.368* \n1.520** \n1.475** \n1.296* \n1.428 \n\n0.958*** \n0.892** \n1.002** \n1.009 \n0.794*** \n0.675*** \n0.791*** \n0.675** \nHousehold Characteristics \n0.842* \n1.426* \n(0.268) \n0.854* \n1.265 \n0.672*** \n1.463* \n1.616** \n0.608*** \n1.675*** \n0.983 \n\n(0.265) \n(0.182) \n\n(0.352) \n\n(0.219) \n\n(0.245) \n\n(0.292) \n\n(0.330) \n\n(0.002) \n\n(0.060) \n\n(0.130) \n\n(0.059) \n\n(0.005) \n\n(0.042) \n\n(0.001) \n\n(0.094) \n\n(0.066) \n\n(0.063) \n(0.053) \n\n(0.121) \n\n(0.076) \n\n(0.081) \n\n(0.069) \n\n(0.071) \n\n(0.079) \n\n1.010*** \n1.013 \n\n0.949 \n\n1.119 \n\n0.973*** \n1.312*** \n0.997*** \n1.513*** \n1.806*** \n2.380*** \n1.521*** \n1.423** \n\n1.019 \n1.470*** \n1.713*** \n2.312*** \n1.689*** \n\n(0.002) \n\n(0.071) \n\n(0.109) \n\n(0.114) \n\n(0.006) \n\n(0.086) \n\n(0.001) \n\n(0.204) \n\n(0.204) \n\n(0.267) \n(0.135) \n\n(0.221) \n\n(0.138) \n\n(0.188) \n\n(0.220) \n\n(0.299) \n\n(0.138) \n\n6,875 \n\n6,875 \n\n6,875 \n\nNotes: UC-OM = underweight child and overweight mother, UC-NOM = underweight child and non-overweight mother, \nNUC-OM  =  non-underweight  child  and  overweight  mother,  NUC-NOM  =  non  underweight  child  and  non-overweight \nmother. Base categories: boy for gender, didn\u2019t have diarrhea for diarrhea last month, very small/small for birth size, no \neducation for mother\u2019s education, blue collar job for mother\u2019s occupation, expenditure quintile 1 for expenditure quintile, \nrural  for  place  of  residence.  A  child  is  defined  as  underweight  when  weight-for-age  z-score<\u20132;  non-underweight  \nwhen  weight-for-age  z-score  \u2265\u20132.  A mother  is  defined  as  overweight  when  BMI>=23 kg/m2  and  non-overweight  when \nBMI<23 kg/m2.  Richer states  includes Karnataka, West Bengal,  Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, \nPunjab,  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  Kerala.  Standard  errors,  clustered  at  the  primary  sampling  unit,  in  parentheses;  \n* p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01. \nSource: Estimated using IHDS2 unit record data. \n\nFinally, examining factors associated with NUC-OM households, the results in Tables 6 \nand  7  suggest  that,  relative  to  NUC-NOM  households,  taller  mothers  have  lower \nchances and older mothers have higher chances of being NUC-OM. Occupation is also \na  significant  predictor,  with  chances  of  being  a  NUC-OM  increasing  if  mothers  are \nemployed in jobs that involve less physical labor or are not working (relative to mothers \nworking in more physically strenuous jobs). \n\nFurthermore, households with educated mothers relative to mothers with no education, \nor  households  in  higher  income  quintiles  relative  to  the  lowest  income  quintile,  have \nhigher risk of having a NUC-OM pair than being NUC-NOM. However, for richer states, \nthis is seen only in the highest quintile. As expected, results across both the richer and \nall states predict that urban relative to rural households have higher chances of having \na  NUC-OM  pair.  As  shown  in  Table  7,  the  results  are  unaffected  when  an  alternate \nspecification is considered. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nTo  summarize,  a  child\u2019s  birth  size  and  age,  the  mother\u2019s  health  (as  captured  by  her \nheight) and age, her education, whether she has a sedentary lifestyle, and household \nexpenditure  are  significant  in  explaining  the  probability  that  a  household  has  an \nunderweight  child  and  overweight  mother.  All  these  are  in  the  expected  direction  and \nare  consistent  with  the  evidence  found  for  other  developing  countries  including \nIndonesia  and  Bangladesh.  While  urban  residence  matters,  it  appears  to  affect  only  \nthe  level  and  not  the  magnitudes  of  the  marginal  effects  of  the  covariates.  These \nresults  are  robust  to  both  the  choice  of  specification  and  the  method  of  estimation  \n(as there are no substantial differences in the set of factors that are significant across \nboth the binary and MNL specifications). However, when a subset of the richer states is \nexamined  separately,  only  the  mother\u2019s  health,  the  number  of  children  she  has,  and \nhousehold  expenditure  are  significant\u2014once  again,  results  that  are  robust  to  both \nchoice  of  specification  and  method  of  estimation.  Thus  there  appear  to  be  strong \nregional  differences  in  the  principal  drivers  of  the  probability  of  having  a  dual  burden \nhousehold.  Also,  lack  of  access  to  household-level  resources  does  not  appear  to \nexplain the phenomenon, suggesting that intra-household allocation of food and other \nresources  may  be  inequitable,  although  the  lack  of  data  on  food  intakes  precludes  a \ndefinitive statement. \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIndia is clearly far along in the nutrition transition. This paper has estimated, using unit \nrecord  data,  the  proportion  of  adult  women  whose  BMI  is  greater  than  23  and  27.5, \ncutoffs  at  which  populations  in  South  Asia  are  at  greater  risk  of  noncommunicable \ndiseases  (NCDs),  and  has  demonstrated  that  these  numbers  are  substantial  and \nincreasing  rapidly.  Not  surprisingly,  the  magnitudes  of  at  least  two  of  the  NCDs\u2014\ndiabetes  and  hypertension\u2014are  large  and  have  important  implications  for  the  public \nhealth  system  in  terms  of  its  ability  to  diagnose  and  manage  these  conditions.  Given \nregional  variations,  there  is  need  for  different  intensities  of  intervention\u2014with  a  focus \non diagnosis and management in high-burden states, and prevention in regions where \nthe  magnitudes  of  overweight  and  obesity  are  lower.  This  is  likely  to  be  a  particular \nchallenge in rural areas as well, where there is need for sensitization and strengthening \nof  health  infrastructure  (both  physical,  including  for  basic  blood  tests,  and  human \ncapital) that are critical to monitoring and managing diabetes and hypertension.  \n\nTo  what  extent  macro  policy  levers,  especially  those  affect relative  prices  of food can \nbe  used  to  effect  better  health  outcomes  needs  further  investigation.  Some  states  do \nsubsidize  the  provision  of  edible  oil  and  sugar  through  the  public  distribution  system, \npotentially  leading  to  greater  consumption.  Also,  some  have  argued  that  the  Indian \nNational  Food  Security  Act,  with  its  focus  on  highly  subsidized  cereals,  may  act  as  \na  disincentive  to  make  better  diet  choices  in  favor  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  dairy \nproducts\u2014as  higher-quality  diets  are  also  more  expensive.  However,  the  limited \nevidence  (see  Meenakshi  2016)  suggests  that  quantities  consumed  of  fats,  oils,  and \nsugars  are  highly  inelastic  with  respect  to  price,  perhaps  limiting  the  effectiveness  of \nprice  instruments,  and  that  income  effects  may  dominate  in  consumption  trends. \nOthers (Popkin et al. 2012) on the other hand, have argued that the fall in the relative \nprice of oil has contributed to its increased consumption; there is clearly, need for more \nresearch in this area. \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nWhile the magnitude of undernutrition, especially among children, is declining in nearly \nall  states,  the  phenomenon  of  the  intra-household  dual  burden  is  increasing.  The \nanalysis  suggests  that  among  other  factors,  healthier  mothers,  mothers  with  fewer \nyears  of  education,  and  households  where  children  are  born  with  a  healthy  weight  \nare  less  likely  to  have  a  dual  burden  of  malnutrition,  underscoring  the  importance  of \ncurrent policy initiatives designed to ensure safe and healthy pregnancy outcomes. The \nsignificance  of  the  household  expenditure  variable  suggests  that  unlike  the  case  in \nmany developed countries (but similar to the experience of other countries undergoing \nthe  transition),  this  is  associated  with  affluence;  equally  clearly,  lifestyle  choices  \nalso  matter.  Although  this  analysis  could  not  directly  address  to  what  extent  such \nhouseholds  are  characterized  by  inequalities  in  food  intakes,  it  is  reasonable  to  infer \nthat  a  reallocation  may  help  address  the  problem  of  the  intra-household  dual  burden. \nBehavior  change  communication  strategies  that  address  both  healthy  lifestyle  and  \ndiet  choices  for  adults  and  appropriate  feeding  practices  for  children  need  greater \nemphasis.  However,  even  here,  there  are  regional  differences  in  both  trends  and \nfactors  contributing  to  them,  suggesting  that  a  region-specific  set  of  interventions  will \nneed to be implemented.  \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 725 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nDang and Meenakshi \n\nAckerson, L., I.

This  paper  shows  that  there  have  been \nrapid  increases  in  the  proportion  of  adult  women  in  India  who  are  overweight  and  obese: \nthese increases are seen not just in urban but in rural areas as well, and there are regional \nspecificities. Correspondingly, diabetes and hypertension affect a large proportion of adults, \neven  as  childhood  undernutrition  remains  a  public  health  problem.  These  have  important \nconsequences for the design of public health systems, especially in rural India. At the same \ntime, the intra-household dual burden of malnutrition is also increasing. Among other factors, \nhouseholds  with  wealthier  and  less  educated  mothers,  and  children  born  with  a  healthy \nweight,  seem  less  vulnerable  to  the  dual  burden  of  malnutrition.  Also  significant  are \nhousehold  expenditure  (suggesting  that the  phenomenon  is  associated with  affluence)  and \nlifestyle choices, calling for better and nuanced behavior change communication strategies. \n \nJEL Classification: I14, I12 \n \n", " \n"]}
