INTRODUCTION \n\n \nBy any measure, the Republic of Korea has been one of the most successful economies in the \npostwar period.1  Export-oriented industrialization endowed the country with a highly competitive \nmanufacturing sector which produces and exports, among others, mobile phones, automobiles, \nelectronics products, ships, and steel, to all corners of the world. There is, however, a general \nperception that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector has long lagged its dynamic world-class \nmanufacturing sector. There are a number of reasons why developing the service sector matters \nfor  the  Republic  of  Korea.  For  one,  the  fact  that  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  manufacturing \nindustries are globally competitive suggests that they have reached high productivity levels and \nthe  scope  for  further  productivity  improvements  is  limited.  In  striking  contrast,  the  service \nsector\u2019s  productivity  remains  low  compared  to  advanced  economies\u2014it  was  second  lowest \namong  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  economies,  after \nPoland (see Cho 2009)\u2014so there is plenty of scope for productivity improvement. Put differently, \ndeveloping  the  hitherto  underdeveloped  service  sector  can  help  to  sustain  growth  at  a  time \nwhen the manufacturing sector is maturing and subject to growing competitive pressures from \nless  developed  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  elsewhere. \nFurthermore, it will facilitate the Republic of Korea\u2019s transition to a post-industrial, services-led \neconomy. \n \n\nWhile  growth  has  been  respectable  and  the  economy  has  continued  to  expand  at  a \nhealthy  pace  since  the  Asian  crisis,  there  has  nevertheless  been  a  clear  loss  of  economic \ndynamism  since  then.  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  per  capita  income  has  reached  levels  where \ngrowth  typically  tends  to  slow  down.  At  the  same  time,  the  weaker  performance  may  partly \nreflect the difficult structural challenge of moving from a manufacturing-led economy to a more \nbalanced economy in which services plays a larger role. In the case of a high-income, high-tech \neconomy  such  as  the  Republic  of  Korea,  what  is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  service \nsector  development  are  high-end  services  such  as  computing  and  business  services  as \nopposed  to  low-end  services  such  as  housecleaning  and  barber  shops.  In  addition,  while  the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s exports are skewed toward manufactured goods, there may be some high-\nend tradable services in which the Republic of Korea has a potential comparative advantage\u2014\ne.g., medical tourism. \n\n \nThe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  rapid  demographic  transition,  along  with  growing  levels  of \nincome inequality and relative poverty, provide further impetus for a more robust service sector \n(Jones  2012,  Noland  2012).  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  exceptionally  fast  population  aging  is \ndriven  by  the  collapse  of  fertility  to  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  at  around  1.2  children.  The \ncountry currently has the fourth youngest population in the OECD area but will have the second \noldest  by  2050.  A  large  and  growing  elderly  population  will  increase  the  demand  for  certain \ntypes of services. For example, the demand for health care is higher among the elderly than the \nnon-elderly. Likewise, the physical frailty of the elderly implies a greater demand for long-term \ncare  and  other  services  involving  physical  assistance.  In  addition,  the  need  for  affordable, \nadequate,  and  sustainable  old-age  income  support  can  stimulate  the  demand  for  financial \nservices.  At  the  same  time,  growing  income  inequality  points  to  a  need  to  expand  social \nspending.  In  this  connection,  public  services,  which  enhance  the  productivity  of  low-income \ngroups  through  education,  training,  and  re-training  and  thus  improve  equality  of  opportunity, \nare critical. \n\n                                          \n1    Recently CNN reports that there are only two countries, the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, that have grown \n\nat an average annual pace of more than 5% for the last five decades in a row (available at \nhttp://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/25/sharma-five-decades-of-five-percent-growth/). \n\n\f2      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nIn this paper we examine the performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. In \nSection  II  we  empirically  examine  and  confirm  the  conventional  wisdom  that  the  Republic  of \nKorea\u2019s  service  sector  lags  its  manufacturing  sector.  In  Section  III  we  analyze  some  possible \nfactors  underlying  the  poor  performance  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  services.  Section  IV  sets \nforth  some  policy  options  for  strengthening  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector.  Section  V \nconcludes the paper. \n\n \n \nII. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR:   \nAN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT   \n \nAs  noted  above,  there  is  a  widespread  perception  that  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector \nperforms  poorly  relative  to  its  dynamic  world-class  manufacturing  sector.2  In  this  section,  we \nempirically investigate the extent to which this perception is borne out by actual data. \n \n\nFigure 1 of Park and Shin (2012) shows the shares of agriculture, industry, and services \nin  employment  during  1980\u20132000  and  their  shares  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  during \n1960\u20132000. The share of agriculture continuously declined. Interestingly, although the process \nof  industrialization  started  in  the  1960s  the  share  of  agriculture  exceeded  30%  even  in  1980. \nThe  trend  is  consistent  with  the  stylized  fact  of  the  demographic  hollowing  out  of  rural  areas \nwhich  leaves  them  with  an  increasingly  older  population.  Up  to  the  early  1990s,  the  share  of \nboth industry and services in employment rises as rural residents, especially younger residents, \nmoved to the cities during the industrialization process. Since the early 1990s, with the advent \nof deindustrialization and the Republic of Korea\u2019s shift into the post-industrial phase, the share \nof industry fell but the share of services continued to rise. \n\n \nThe share of the three sectors in GDP shows a similar pattern. As might be expected, \nthe  share  of  agriculture  fell  sharply  and  continuously  as  the  Republic  of  Korea  industrialized. \nThe share of industry rose steadily until the early 1990s when it peaked and has more or less \nstabilized since then, albeit with substantial volatility. On the other hand, the share of services in \nGDP  rose  steadily  until  the  early  2010s  although  it  has  fluctuated  around  60%  since  then.  A \ncomparison  of  the  evolution  of  the  shares  of  services  in  employment  and  GDP  since  1980 \nreveals  a  marked  difference  between  the  two.  More  precisely,  the  share  of  services  in \nemployment  has  grown  noticeably  faster  and  more  consistently  than  its  share  in  GDP.  Output \ngrowth has thus failed to keep pace with employment growth in services. \n\n \nA  well-known  stylized  fact  of  economic  growth  and  development  is  that  the  share  of \nservices in GDP tends to increase as a country becomes richer. Figure 1 shows how the share \nof service sector in the Republic of Korea\u2019s GDP and employment evolved over time as its per \ncapita  GDP  increased  rapidly.  We  follow  Eichengreen  and  Gupta  (2009)  and  Park  and  Shin \n(2012) to estimate a quartic relationship between per capita GDP and the shares of the service \nsector  in  GDP  and  employment.  Figure  1(A)  shows  and  compares  the  actual  shares  of  the \nservice  sector  in  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  GDP  with  the  line  fitted  on  the  basis  of  the  quartic \nregression  for  two  sub-periods:  1970\u20131989  and  1990\u20132010.  We  divide  the  sample  period  at \n1990  because  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  deindustrialization  (in  terms  of  employment)  started \naround this year. Figure 1(b) shows and compares the actual shares of the service sector in the \nRepublic  of  Korea\u2019s  employment  with  line  fitted  on  the  basis  of  the  quartic  regression  for  two \nsub-periods:  1980\u20131989  and  1990\u20132010.  Since  employment  data  are  available  from  1980 \nonward, the first year in this figure is 1980. In both figures we denote the 95% confidence bands \n\n                                          \n2  See Jones (2009). \n\n\fPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      3 \n\nby grey lines. While the share of the service sector in GDP lies below the predicted line in both \nperiods, 1970\u20131989 and 1990\u20132010, the share of the service sector in employment lies more or \nless on the predicted line. This implies that labor in the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector does \nnot produce as much value added as other countries of a similar per capita GDP levels. \n\n \nFigure 1.

Both output and employment shares of \nthe service sector have continuously increased in most countries. However, for example in 2009, \nthe  GDP  share  of  services  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  is  much  lower  than  that  in  developed \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      5 \n\ncountries. While the employment share in the Republic of Korea is lower than that in developed \ncountries,  the  gap  is  much  smaller.  Therefore,  not  only  has  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  services \noutput  growth  lagged  its  services  employment  growth  over  time,  but  relative  to  developed \ncountries,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  services  output  lags  its  services  employment.  Both  trends \nimply weak labor productivity growth in the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. It is also striking \nto compare the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector performance to that of Taipei,China, a fellow \nnewly  industrialized  economy  (NIE)  at  a  similar  income  level.  In  2009,  Taipei,  China,  had  a \nhigher  GDP  share  of  services\u201468.5%  versus  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  61.0%\u2014along  with  a \nhigher employment share\u201467.8% versus the Republic of Korea\u2019s 58.9%. While the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s services share of GDP is comparable to that of South American countries and Eastern \nEuropean  countries,  its  services  share  of  employment  is  higher  than  those  of  other  countries \nexcept  Argentina.  As  emphasized  by  Eichengreen,  Perkins,  and  Shin  (2012),  the  employment \nshare of services grew at an exceptional speed in the Republic of Korea, surging from 37% in \n1980 to 67.8% by 2009. This suggests that the deindustrialization process may have been too \nfast and labor productivity growth in the service sector has not kept pace with it. \n \n\nTable 1.

In  Asian  and  Eastern  European  countries,  in  general  labor \nproductivity  growth  rate  in  services  is  lower  than  in  industry.  This  is  in  line  with  widespread \nperception  of  Asian  economies,  especially  those  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  as  having \nrelatively  well-developed  manufacturing  sectors  and  underdeveloped  service  sector.  The \nexception is India, where labor productivity growth rate in service is much higher than in industry. \nThis is not surprising in light of India\u2019s well-known success as the world\u2019s foremost information \ncommunications technology and business process outsourcing (ICT-BPO) services exporter.3  In \nSouth American countries and developed countries, labor productivity growth rate in services is \nas high as or only slightly lower than in industry.

The index is calculated \nby dividing labor productivity of the service sector by aggregate labor productivity. If it is greater \n(less)  than  1,  labor  productivity  of  the  service  sector  is  higher  (lower)  than  aggregate  labor \nproductivity. Therefore, the index gauges whether the service sector workers are more or less \nproductive than workers in the economy as a whole. We measure it twice, for the averages of \nthe  1990s  and  2000s.  Relative  services  labor  productivity  is  higher  than  1  in  a  number  of \ncountries. In general, it is higher, the less developed the country. This is due to the large share \nof  the  agricultural  sector  in  less  developed  countries.  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  relative \nproductivity  is  less  than  1  in  both  periods  and  even  declines  between  the  1990s  and  2000s. \nGiven  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  income  and  development  level,  its  relative  services  labor \nproductivity seems noticeably low. \n \n\nFigure 2.

World Development Indicators online database (accessed 14 March 2012). \n \n \n\nAccording  to  Eichengreen  and  Gupta  (2009),  there  are  two  distinct  waves  of  service \nsector growth and development. In the first wave, the service sector share of output begins to \nrise  at  relatively  modest  incomes  but  at  a  decelerating  rate  as  the  economy  grows.  In  the \nsecond wave, the share rises again at higher level of incomes. Importantly, the two waves are \npopulated  by  different  kinds  of  services.  The  first  wave  is  characterized  by  the  rise  of  the \ntraditional  services\u2014lodging,  meal  preparation,  housecleaning,  beauty,  and  barber  shops\u2014\nwhile  the  second  wave  is  dominated  by  the  supplementation  of  modern  services\u2014banking, \ninsurance,  computing,  communication,  and  business  services.  Based  on  the  above  findings, \nthey  defined  three  groups  of  services  according  to  whether  their  shares  of  GDP  have  fallen, \n\n\f8      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nrisen  slowly,  or  risen  rapidly  over  time.4  The  first  group  (group  I)  includes  traditional  services: \nretail  and  wholesale  trade,  transport  and  storage,  public  administration  and  defense.  In  many \ncountries,  particularly  in  advanced  countries,  the  share  of  this  group  in  GDP  has  fallen \nnoticeably over time. The second group (group II) is a hybrid of traditional and modern services \nand  this  group  includes  education;  health  and  social  work;  hotels  and  restaurants;  and  other \ncommunity,  social,  and  personal  services.  Their  shares  rise  slowly  with  time.  The  final  group \n(group III) consists of modern services consumed by both the household and corporate sectors \nand  this  group  includes  financial  intermediation,  computer  services,  business  services, \ncommunication, and legal and technical services. The share of the final group in GDP has been \nincreasing very rapidly in recent years. In light of its high income and development level, what is \nmost relevant and crucial for the Republic of Korea is to develop services in group III. \n\n \nTable  3  shows  the  shares  of  service  group  I,  II,  and  III  in  (a)  output  (GDP)  and  (b) \nemployment. In each panel, the first column is for the United States, the second column for EU-\n15  average,  and  the  third  column  for  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  share  of  the  first  group  in \noutput decreased over time in all three cases. However, its share is still large comparable to that \nof  either  group  II  or  III.  In  fact,  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  it  still  remains  the  largest  group.  The \nshare  of  the  second  group  in  output  increased  moderately  over  time.  The  share  of  the  third \ngroup increased most rapidly over time. The Republic of Korea\u2019s share of every group is lower \nthan  that  of  either  the  United  States  or  European  Union.  In  particular,  the  share  of  the  third \ngroup  in  output  is  particularly  small  for  the  Republic  of  Korea.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  low \nshare  of  other  business  activities.  Other  business  activities  include  all  the  business  related \nservices not related to real estate activities and they are a key area where productivity growth is \nhigh in many advanced countries. Other than business activities, the output share of health and \nsocial work is also particularly small. \n\n \nThe  employment  share  shows  a  similar  pattern  over  time.  One  difference  is  that  the \nshare  of  the  first  group  for  EU-15  countries  did  not  decrease  over  time.  The  difference  in  the \nemployment  share  between  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  European  Union  is  very  small  in \ngroups I and II. However the difference remains still large in group III. The employment share of \nhealth and social work, and other business activities is especially small.   \n\n \nThere  are  some  subcategories  such  as  other  community,  social,  and  personal  service, \nand hotels and restaurants, where the employment share of the Republic of Korea is particularly \nlarge.  Areas  where  output  share  is  very  low  relative  to  employment  share  are:  group  I \n(wholesale trade, transport, and storage), group II (other community, social, and personal), and \ngroup III (other business activities). These are thus service subcategories where the Republic of \nKorea suffers from serious labor productivity problems. \n\n \n\n                                          \n4    Eichengreen  and  Gupta  did  not  include  real  estate  activities;  private  households  with  employed  persons;  and \nextra-territorial organizations and bodies in the classification of group I, II, and III. Moreover, due to an update in \n2011, data on two industries\u2014renting of machinery and equipment; and legal, technical and advertising\u2014are no \nlonger reported separately, but are included in other business activities. \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      9 \n\n \n\n\f10      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      11 \n\nWhile  labor  productivity  captures  how  productive  workers  are,  total  factor  productivity \n(TFP) captures the efficiency with which all factors of production are used. Table 4 reports the \ngrowth  rate  of  TFP  in  the  service  subsectors.  We  use  TFP  growth  for  industry  value  added, \nobtained  from  the  EU  KLEMS  (capital,  labor,  energy,  materials,  services)  database.5  It \ncalculates  TFP  growth  by  subtracting  weighted  cost  share  of  capital  and  labor  inputs  growth \nfrom the industry value-added growth at constant prices. Instead of using standard measures of \nlabor  input,  such  as  numbers  employed  or  hours  worked,  it  measures  labor  input  as  labor \nservices which takes the heterogeneity of the labor force into account. Our key findings are as \nfollows. TFP growth in group III is not always higher, but it is higher than in group I or II in the \nmost  recent  period,  2001\u20132007,  in  all  three  economies.  Despite  its  low  level  of  technology \nrelative to the United States or European Union, the Republic of Korea\u2019s growth rate of TFP in \ngroup I and II is as low as in those two economies. The growth rate of TFP in group III for the \nRepublic  of  Korea  is  higher  than  in  the  United  States  and  European  Union.  However,  this  is \nprobably  due  to  the  high  growth  rate  of  TFP  in  financial  intermediation  and  post  and \ntelecommunication. The growth rate of TFP in other business activities is particularly low in the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  Our  results  for  TFP  growth  are  generally  consistent  with  those  for  labor \nproductivity growth.   \n \n\nIn  sum,  the  evidence  from  this  section  resoundingly  confirms  the  conventional  wisdom \nthat  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  performs  poorly  and  lags  its  world-class \nmanufacturing sector. This implies that there is plenty of scope for developing the service sector \nand  more  well-developed  services  can  contribute  a  lot  to  economic  growth  and  dynamism. \nAmong the service sectors, it is business related activities which are most far behind. Yet it is \nprecisely such service activities which are most pivotal to strengthening the service sector in a \nhigh-income economy such as the Republic of Korea. Other service areas which perform poorly \ninclude  wholesale  trade,  transport  and  storage,  and  other  community,  social  and  personal \nservices. \n\n \n\n                                          \n5    A detailed explanation on the calculation of TFP in the EU KLEMS database can be found in Timmer, O\u2019Mahony, \n\nand van Ark (2007). \n\n\f12      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      13 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nIII. WHY DOES THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR PERFORM SO BADLY? \nSOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS \n \nIn the preceding section, we saw that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector performs poorly in \nthe  international  context,  especially  relative  to  its  income  and  development  level.  The  obvious \nquestion  to  ask  is  why?  In  this  section,  we  will  explore  four  possible  explanations.6  First,  too \nrapid deindustrialization, most evident in the sharp rise in the share of services in employment, \nmay  have  led  to  a  lot  of  underemployment  in  marginal  services  jobs.  Second,  government \nregulations and restrictions, which are designed to protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \nand  service  sector  jobs,  may  hold  back  the  growth  of  the  service  sector.  Third,  relatively  low \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  expenditures  in  the  service  sector  and  low  ICT  investments \nmay  hinder  innovation  in  services  and  thus  movement  to  high  value-added  service  activities. \nFourth,  barriers  to  services  trade  and  FDI,  designed  to  protect  domestic  firms  and  industries \nfrom  foreign  competition,  weaken  their  incentives  to  become  more  efficient.  We  now  examine \neach of the four potential explanations in more detail. \n \nA. \n\nToo Rapid Deindustrialization and Underemployment in Services   \n\nAs  evident  in  Table  1  above,  the  share  of  services  in  employment  grew  at  an  exceptional \nspeed. 7  The  frantic  pace  of  the  reallocation  of  labor  from  manufacturing  to  services  in  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  has  made  it  difficult  for  some  workers  to  find  new  employment  and  hence \nthey  end  up  in  disguised  unemployment  in  the  service  sector,  which  contributes  to  low \nproductivity  growth  in  the  service  sector.  That  is,  they  end  up  underemployed  in  marginal \nservice  sector  jobs.  Based  on  shift-share  analysis,  Eichengreen,  Perkins  and  Shin  (2012)  find \nthat roughly 70% of the growth of aggregate labor productivity in the Republic of Korea in 1970\u2013\n2007 was attributable to the within effect\u2014i.e., economy-wide increases in productivity holding \nsectoral shares constant\u2014which is not due to the reallocation of workers. In particular, they find \nthat it was manufacturing with its relatively fast productivity growth that mainly accounts for the \nwithin  effect.  The  role  of  the  shift  effect  that  is  due  to  reallocation  of  workers  from  low \nproductivity  to  high  productivity  sectors  is  relatively  minor.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  labor \nreallocation from manufacturing to service sectors did not contribute a lot to productivity growth. \nTo the contrary, the too rapid reallocation of labor to the service sector holds down the growth of \nservice sector productivity. \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Regulations and Restrictions \n\nWhile  the  objective  of  the  Korean  government\u2019s  regulations  and  restrictions  on  the  service \nsector  is  to protect  SMEs  and  jobs,  there  is  a serious  risk that  they  end  up  stifling  the  growth \nand  dynamism  of  the  sector.  We  follow  Woefl  et  al.  (2010)  to  construct  Table  5  based  on  the \nconcept  of  product  market  regulation  (PMR)  indicators.  According  to  Woefl  et  al.  (2010),  the \nunderlying  idea  behind  the  PMR  indicators  is  to  turn  qualitative  information  such  as  laws  and \nregulations  that  may  affect  competition  into  quantitative  indicators.  They  seek  to  measure \nregulations which are potentially anti-competitive in areas where competition is viable, and look \nprimarily  at  policy  settings  instead  of  market  outcomes.  The  economy-wide  PMR  indicator \n\n                                          \n6    Jones  (2009)  also  examines  factors  behind  the  low  productivity  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector.  In \nparticular,  he  emphasizes  (i)  the  legacy  of  an  export-led  growth  strategy  that  attracted  the  most  productive \nresources into manufacturing, (ii) insufficient competition in services due to heavy regulations, (iii) low  R&D and \nICT investment, and (iv) the weakness of SMEs.   \n\n7    This is also emphasized by Kim (2006) as a structural problem for the Korean economy. \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      15 \n\ncovers both general and sectoral regulatory issues in three domains \u2014state control, barriers to \nentrepreneurship, and barriers to trade and investment.   \n \n\nTable  5  reports  PMR  scores  for  the  three  domains  for  OECD  average  and  five  Asian \ncountries\u2014PRC, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.8  The Republic of Korea\u2019s \neconomy-wide PMR score is 1.48, a little bit higher than OECD average (1.36) but much lower \nthan that of other countries such as PRC (3.30), India (2.84) and Indonesia (2.73). A lower score \nmeans less restrictions. The indicator for state control in the Republic of Korea (1.99) is lower \nthan  that  of  the  OECD  average  (2.04).  The  indicator  for  barriers  to  entrepreneurship  is  also \nlower for the Republic of Korea (1.14) than the OECD (1.42). However, the Republic of Korea \ndoes poorly in the score for administrative burdens on startups, especially for corporation\u2014i.e., \nthe  Republic  of  Korea  (2.75)  vs.  the  OECD  (1.36).  The  Republic  of  Korea  does  particularly \npoorly  in  the  score  for  barriers  to  entry  in  services\u2014i.e.,  the  Republic  of  Korea  (2.31)  vs.  the \nOECD (1.76). In this category, in fact, the Republic of Korea fares even worse than India and \nIndonesia. The Republic of Korea also scores poorly in the indicators for barriers to trade and \ninvestment\u2014i.e., the Republic of Korea (1.30) vs. the OECD (0.63). In particular, the scores for \ntariffs (the Republic of Korea\u2019s 2.00 vs. the OECD\u2019s 1.31) and other regulatory barriers (1.60 vs. \n0.79) are low. \n \n\nA lot of government restrictions on the service sector are geared toward the protection of \nemployment in SMEs. As such, it would be useful to examine the status of SMEs in the Republic \nof  Korea.  The  relative  labor  productivity  as  measured  by  the  relative  value  added  per  person \nemployed  in  SMEs  for  the  service  sector  as  a  whole  changed  from  49%  (=26.1/53.3)  of  large \nfirms in 2001 to 41% (=61.1/148.1) in 2009 (as calculated from the bottom line). The problem of \npoor labor productivity in SMEs thus grew worse since labor productivity growth over the past \nten years was considerably higher among large firms than among SMEs. \n \n\nThe  problem  is  more  severe  in  more  traditional  service  sectors.  The  relative  labor \nproductivity of SMEs in group I plunged from 52% to 29% during the same period. The relative \nproductivity of SMEs in group II declined from 58% to 36%, and from 92% to 66% in group III. A \nsizable gap in productivity between large and small firms is evident in every group. However, as \na result of different relative productivity growth, the gap is now smallest in group III. This reflects \nthe  fact  that  the  regulations  tend  to  protect  SMEs  engaged  in  more  traditional  services.  More \nspecifically,  the  gap  is  particularly  large  in  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  hotels  and  restaurants, \neducation, arts and sports, and real estate and renting, where restrictive regulations are heavy \nand low-productivity SMEs can still survive. However, it is worrisome that the productivity gap is \nalso widening even in the most modern service sector, group III. Heavy government protection \nof  SMEs  is  motivated  by  their  high  share  in  employment.  The  share  of  SMEs  in  employment \neven increased further from 86.3% to 91.2% (total), 90.9% to 95.7% (group I), 92.1% to 93.9% \n(group II), and 71.2% to 78.9% (group III).   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                          \n8    For Asia, the PMR indicators are available for only five countries. \n\n\f16      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nTable 5.

Product Market Regulation database (accessed 14 March 2012). \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nLow R&D Expenditures and Low ICT Investment \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      17 \n\nAnother possible explanation for the poor performance of the service sector in the Republic of \nKorea  is  relatively  low  R&D  expenditures  and  low  ICT  investment,  which  hinder  innovation  in \nservices  and  moving  up  the  value  chain  toward  higher  value-added  services  activities.9  R&D \nintensity of a sector is measured as R&D expenditures as a percentage of value added in \nthe  sector.  Data  are  collected  from  OECD  STAN  Indicators.  The  data  are  for  the  most \nrecent  years  available,  2004\u20132009.  The  R&D  intensity  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s \nmanufacturing  is  higher  than  the  OECD  average.  It  is  ninth  highest  out  of  33  countries.  In \ncontrast,  the  R&D  intensity  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  is  lower  than  the  OECD \naverage. It is only eighteenth out of 33 countries. Therefore, in the Republic of Korea there are \nvisibly more innovative investments in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector. This \nmay  help  to  explain  why  services  lag  behind  manufacturing  in  productivity.  As  evident  in \nFigure 3,  for  every  services  group,  R&D  intensity  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  underperforms  the \nOECD average. The gap is largest for group 1, which is subject to most regulatory restrictions \nand thus provides the least incentive for investing in R&D. \n \n\nIn  the  EU  KLEMS  database,  ICT  investment  is  defined  as  investment  in  computing \nequipment,  communication  equipment,  and  software.  From  ICT  investment,  the  database \nconstructs  ICT  capital.  Then  based  on  the  standard  growth  accounting  exercise,  value-added \ngrowth  is  decomposed  into  the  contributions  of  capital\u2014both  ICT  and  non  ICT,  labor,  and \nmultifactor productivity. In general, ICT contribution is largest for group III, followed by group II, \nand  lowest  in  group  I.  This  is  intuitively  plausible  because  modern  services  stand  to  gain  the \nmost from application of ICT. In general, ICT\u2019s contribution to value added growth grows larger \nover  time  if  we  exclude  the  last  subsample  period.  Interestingly,  ICT\u2019s  contribution  declines  in \nevery country in the last period. As might be expected, ICT\u2019s contribution is larger in group III, \nthe modern service sector, than in group I or II. When we compare the Republic of Korea with \nthe United States and European Union, the contribution of ICT capital in the Republic of Korea \nis  lower  and  it  is  markedly  lower  for  group  I.  The  difference  is  smallest  in  group  III.  The  only \nexception is telecommunication, the one sub-category of group III where the contribution of ICT \ncapital in the Republic of Korea actually exceeds that of the European Union and United States. \n\n \nBarriers to Services Trade and Barriers to FDI in Services \n\nD. \n\nJust  like  barriers  to  goods  trade  and  barriers  to  FDI  in  manufacturing,  the  main  objective  of \nbarriers  to  services  trade  and  barriers  to  FDI  in  services  is  to  protect  domestic  firms  and \nindustries from foreign competition. The standard argument for opening up trade and FDI is also \nidentical for both manufacturing and services\u2014they encourage domestic firms and industries to \nbecome more efficient in order to survive foreign competition. By the same token, the standard \nargument  against  barriers  to  trade  and  FDI  in  both  sectors  is  that  they  hamper  productivity \ngrowth  by  diluting  competitive  pressures  and  hence  incentives  of  domestic  players  to  raise \ntheir game. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                          \n9    There are a number of studies that find that ICT investment enhances productivity.

In most countries, service trade share in total trade has increased over time. This is \nparticularly true in India and the United Kingdom. It also has increased in the Republic of Korea, \nbut the increase is minimal, particularly from 2000 to 2010. Compared to other Asian economies, \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s services trade share is not large; in fact, it is smaller than Hong Kong, \nChina; Pakistan; Philippines (except in 2000); and Singapore. The Republic of Korea\u2019s share is \ncomparable to that of South American countries and Eastern European countries, and it is lower \nthan that in most developed countries. The only exception is Germany, which is well known for \nits strong bias toward manufacturing and relatively underdeveloped services. In the Republic of \nKorea,  the  share  of  services  in  imports  is  larger  than  that  in  exports  (except  in  1990).  This  is \nalso  true  for  South  American  countries.  In  the  case  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  difference \ngrows  larger  over  time.

The Republic of Korea is the world\u2019s fifth largest \nexporter  and  thirteenth  largest  importer  of  manufactured  goods.  The  fact  that  the  Republic  of \nKorea ranks among the world\u2019s five biggest exporters of manufactures is a vivid testament to its \nstatus as a globally significant manufacturer. The Republic of Korea generally runs a large trade \nsurplus in manufactured goods. In contrast, the Republic of Korea plays a visibly smaller role in \nglobal  services  trade.  The  Republic  of  Korea  is  the  world\u2019s  fifteenth  largest  exporter  and \n\n\fPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      21 \n\neleventh largest importer of services. Most notably, the Republic of Korea\u2019s rank as an exporter \nof services\u201415\u2013is much lower than its rank as an exporter of manufactured goods\u20145, lending \nfurther support to the notion that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector lags its manufacturing \nsector. In contrast to its large surplus in manufactures trade, the Republic of Korea runs a deficit \nin services trade. \n \n \n\nTable 7.

The  service \ndata  are  collected  from  the  OECD.  The  GDP  and  population  data  are  from  Penn  World  Table \n7.0.  Other  data  are  obtained  from  Rose  and  Spiegel  (2011)  except  for  the  regional  trade \nagreement (RTA) dummy, which is extended by using the reports to CEPII and the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO). \n\n \n\n\f24      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nWe use total exports (imports) as the dependent variable in Table 8 and service exports \n(imports)  as  a  dependent  variable  in  Table  9.  All  variables  except  for  the  binary  variables  are \ntaken as logarithms. We drop the observations if either total trade or services trade takes zero \nor negative values.10  In both tables, the first and third columns are for exports and the second \nand  the  fourth  columns  for  imports.  We  also  include  a  KOR  dummy  variable  in  the  last  two \ncolumns. A number of findings emerge from our estimation of the above gravity equation. The fit \nof  the  gravity  equation  for  service  trade  is  as  good  as  the  fit  for  total  trade.  The  estimated \ncoefficients  for  distance  and  number  of  islands  are  smaller  when  we  use  service  trade  as  a \ndependent  variable.  Service  is  weightless,  which  means  that  physical  distance  and  shipping \nmatters less than for goods trade. The estimated coefficient for common language is larger for \nservice trade. Communication matters more for service trade. The effects of currency union and \nregional trade on service trade are at least as large as their effects on total trade. The estimated \ncoefficients  for  colony  related  variables  are  larger  for  service  trade.  Again,  communication \nmatters more for service trade. The estimated coefficient for the KOR dummy is positive in both \ncases but it is smaller for service trade. This implies that the Republic of Korea trades more in \ngoods  and  services  and  in  services  alone  than  a  comparable  country  but  the  degree  of  over-\ntrading is less for service trade. \n\n \nWith  respect  to  FDI  inflows,  the  share  of  service  sector  FDI  in  total  FDI  was  much \nsmaller than the OECD average in 2006. The share of service sector FDI grew but still remains \nsmaller  than  the  OECD  average  in  2010.  Furthermore,  the  share  of  group  III  in  total  service \nsector FDI inflows is lower in the Republic of Korea than the OECD average. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                          \n10   Dropping zero or negative trade values may generate biased estimates, but Linders and de Groot (2006) suggest \n\nthat this bias is negligible in practice. \n\n\fPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      25 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8: Gravity Equation for Total Exports and Imports \n\n \nDependent Variable \n\nI \n\nII \n\nIII \n\nIV \n\nTotal Exports \n\nTotal Imports \n\nTotal Exports \n\nTotal Imports \n\nDummy for [Rep. of] Korea \n\nLog distance   \n\nLog population 1 \n\nLog population 2 \n\nLog per capita GDP 1 \n\nLog per capita GDP 2 \n\nDummy for currency union \n\nDummy for common language \n\nDummy for regional trade \nagreement \n\nDummy for land border \n\nNumber of islands \n\nLog product of land areas \n\nDummy for common colonizer   \n\nDummy for current Colonial \nRelationship \n\nDummy for ever in Colonial \nRelationship \n\n[-21.857] \n\n[-36.422] \n\n[-22.104] \n\n1.112*** \n\n[6.076] \n\n-1.108*** \n\n1.059*** \n\n[58.598] \n\n0.817*** \n\n[47.043] \n\n1.570*** \n\n[35.867] \n\n1.133*** \n\n[69.711] \n\n0.069 \n\n[0.819] \n\n0.791*** \n\n[9.867] \n\n0.062*** \n\n[3.164] \n\n0.289** \n\n[2.130] \n\n0.114* \n\n[1.928] \n\n0.019 \n\n[1.622] \n\n1.628*** \n\n[5.570] \n\n0.747 \n\n[0.931] \n\n-1.033*** \n\n1.128*** \n\n[40.551] \n\n1.095*** \n\n[40.857] \n\n0.785*** \n\n[10.921] \n\n1.281*** \n\n[49.634] \n\n0.280** \n\n[2.085] \n\n0.576*** \n\n[4.668] \n\n0.076** \n\n[2.280] \n\n0.633*** \n\n[3.015] \n\n0.665*** \n\n[7.220] \n\n0.021 \n\n[1.160] \n\n1.900*** \n\n[4.199] \n\n0.689 \n\n[0.553] \n\n0.781*** \n\n0.405*** \n\n[4.332] \n\n[3.463] \n\n0.909*** \n\n[3.225] \n\n-1.043*** \n\n1.116*** \n\n[39.837] \n\n1.084*** \n\n[40.299] \n\n0.801*** \n\n[11.140] \n\n1.272*** \n\n[49.162] \n\n0.291** \n\n[2.173] \n\n0.535*** \n\n[4.338] \n\n0.080** \n\n[2.393] \n\n0.642*** \n\n[3.070] \n\n0.675*** \n\n[7.361] \n\n0.027 \n\n[1.501] \n\n1.884*** \n\n[4.181] \n\n0.711 \n\n[0.574] \n\n0.825*** \n\n[4.587] \n\n-1.096*** \n\n[-35.820] \n\n1.074*** \n\n[59.605] \n\n0.830*** \n\n[47.777] \n\n1.554*** \n\n[35.452] \n\n1.144*** \n\n[70.366] \n\n0.057 \n\n[0.669] \n\n0.840*** \n\n[10.445] \n\n0.058*** \n\n[2.972] \n\n0.279** \n\n[2.032] \n\n0.101* \n\n[1.691] \n\n0.012 \n\n[0.991] \n\n1.651*** \n\n[5.600] \n\n0.719 \n\n[0.889] \n\n0.350*** \n\n[2.979] \n\nObservations \n\n17,677 \n\n17,677 \n\n17,677 \n\n17,677 \n\nR-squared \n \nNote:  t  statistics  are  in  brackets.  *,  **,  ***  indicate  that  the  coefficient  is  significant  at  10,  5,  and  1  percent  levels,  respectively. \nPopulation 1 (2) refers to export (import) country\u2019s population in the export (import) equations, column 1 (2) and column 3 (4).

POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      27 \n\nThe analysis of the previous two sections, which empirically confirmed the poor performance of \nthe  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  and  tested  some  potential  explanations  for  the  poor \nperformance, gives rise to some policy implications. In this section, we explore policy options for \nimproving the performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s underperforming service sector. Some of \nour policy options echo those of Pilat (2005) and Jones (2009) although they are more specific \nto the Republic of Korea. \n \nA. \n\nPolicies  to  Cope  with  Too  Rapid  Deindustrialization  and  Underemployment  in \nServices \n\n \nThe very rapid rise in the service sector\u2019s share of employment, in conjunction with a markedly \nslower rise in its share of GDP, implies that the sector has been acting as an absorber of surplus \nworkers  who  are  unable  to  find  productive  employment  in  the  face  of  the  structural \ntransformation.  Since  many  of  those  workers  end  up  in  marginal,  low-productivity,  low-wage \nservices  jobs,  this  brings  down  the  productivity  of  the  service  sector.  The  appropriate  policy \nresponse does not involve slowing down the pace of deindustrialization, which reflects market \nforces  and  contributes  to  the  dynamism  and  efficiency  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  world-class \nmanufacturing  sector.  Instead  it  should  be  based  on  facilitating  and  mitigating  the  large \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  structural  shift  from  manufacturing  to  services.  For \nexample,  more  flexible  labor  markets  can  help  to  reduce  the  structural  unemployment  arising \nfrom  deindustrialization.  Similarly,  more  assistance  to  those  workers  seeking  new  jobs,  for \nexample well-designed training programs, can help dislocated workers from the manufacturing \nsector look for and find jobs which better match their qualifications in the new service industries. \n \nB. \n\nPolicies  to  Speed  Up  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  Successful  Transition  to  a  Post-\nIndustrial Economy \n\n \nThose  sets  of  policies  are  related  to  and  complementary  to  policies  to  cope  with  too  rapid \ndeindustrialization. According to our analysis, what lies at the heart of the poor performance and \nunderdevelopment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  is  a  failure  to  move  into  higher \nvalue-added  services  activities.  While  its  income  is  converging  toward  OECD  levels,  in  one \nimportant  sense,  its  economic  structure  is  not.  Although  the  share  of  services  in  both \nemployment and output has been rising, much of the growth has come from traditional services \nrather  than  modern  services.  That  is,  while  the  country\u2019s  service  sector  has  experienced \nquantitative  expansion,  it  has  a  lot  of  scope  for  qualitative  leveling  up.  The  country\u2019s  large \nservices  imports  and  persistent  deficit  in  services  trade  suggests  that  there  is  substantial \ndemand  for  services.  In  particular,  its  high  income  and  development  level  implies  a  large \ndemand for high-end services. One obvious policy implication is for government to subsidize the \ntraining  and  re-training  of  workers  so  they  can  help  to  meet  this  demand.  In  addition,  the \ngovernment can provide fiscal and other incentives to promote high value-added services such \nas design and prototyping at the beginning of the global value chain (GVC) and marketing and \nbranding  at  the  end  of  the  GVC.  According  to  the  smile  curve  hypothesis,  most  of  the  value \nadded  in  GVC  lies  in  high-end  services  activities  at  both  ends  of  the  GVC  rather  than  pure \nmanufacturing, or simply making things, in the middle.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f28      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nDeregulation \n\nC. \n \nOur analysis indicates that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector faces substantial government \nregulations and restrictions, which aim to protect SMEs and SME jobs in the sector. Examples \nof  such  regulations  and  restrictions  include  strict  entry  and  licensing  requirements,  stringent \napproval  requirements,  and  significant  government  involvement  and  price  controls.  Since  the \nvery objective of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector regulations is to protect a specific group \nof  firms  from  competition,  they  reduce  competitive  pressures  and  are  likely  to  be  a  significant \ncontributor  to  the  sector\u2019s  poor  productivity  performance.  According  to  Pilat  (2005),  OECD \ncountries\u2019  experiences  with  regulatory  reforms  have  been,  by  and  large,  very  positive.  For \nexample, in many OECD countries, deregulation of air passenger transportation and road freight \nhas  delivered  substantial  benefits  in  the  form  of  lower  prices,  new  services,  and  higher  labor \nand  capital  productivity.  However,  given  the  often  large  adjustment  costs  of  services \nderegulation\u2014e.g., the entry of a big supermarket chain wiping out small neighborhood stores\u2014\nit is probably best to pursue services deregulation as a gradual, evolutionary process. \n \nD. \n \nRelative  to  other  OECD  countries,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  R&D  expenditures  and  ICT \ninvestments  are  relatively  low.  This  can  be  a  significant  barrier  against  innovation  in  services \nand moving up the value ladder toward higher value-added services. Some of the policies that \nare  beneficial  for  innovation  in  services  are  beneficial  for  innovation  in  general.  For  example, \nstrengthening  intellectual  property  protection  will  strengthen  incentives  for  R&D  and  other \ninnovative  activities  in  both  services  and  manufacturing  sectors.  At  the  same  time,  given  the \npotentially large positive spillovers from services innovations, the government has to resolve the \ntradeoff  between  encouraging  innovation  and  the  diffusion  of  innovation  to  the  rest  of  the \neconomy.  It  is  also  possible  to  directly  stimulate  R&D  in  services  by  providing  tax  credits  and \ngrants. One technology which is a particularly powerful tool for improving services productivity is \nICT, which has revolutionized the delivery of services. In order to maximize the potential benefits \nof ICT for services, the government should ensure a competitive environment in the ICT industry. \nInnovation  will  be  especially  helpful  for  modern  services,  where  the  Republic  of  Korea \nlags visibly. \n \n\nMore R&D Expenditures and More ICT Investment \n\nIn  ICT-advanced  countries  such  as  the  United  States,  the  private  sector  plays  an \nimportant role so that many ICT investments are made via venture capital provided to creative \nventure firms. Venture capital for ICT activities in the Republic of Korea slowed down markedly \nafter  the  burst  of  the  ICT  bubble  in  2001  and  began  to  bounce  back  only  in  2006.11  However \nthis  recovery  was  largely  attributable  to  the  government  support  through  policy  funds  such  as \nthe  Korea  Venture  Fund.  Heavy  direct  involvement  of  the  government  in  providing  venture \ncapital  can  result  in  inefficient  allocation  of  funds.  Therefore,  policy  should  be  directed  more \ntoward  stimulating  private  venture  capital  which  eventually  contributes  to  efficient  ICT \ninvestment in the service sector. \n\n \nRemove Barriers to Services Trade and Barriers to FDI in Services   \n\nE. \n \nBarriers  to  services  trade  and  FDI  inflows  into  services  protect  domestic  firms  and  industries \nfrom foreign competition, and thus dilute their incentives to innovate and raise their productivity. \nTherefore,  liberalizing  trade  and  FDI  can  potentially  contribute  to  improved  efficiency  in  the \nservice  sector.  According  to  Pilat  (2005),  OECD  studies  find  that  trade  and  FDI  in  services \n\n                                          \n11   See Lee (2011). \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      29 \n\ndelivers large benefits for OECD economies and developing countries alike. In the case of the \nRepublic of Korea, it is widely believed that opening up various sectors to FDI as part of post-\nAsian  crisis  structural  reforms  brought  about  substantial  productivity  gains.12  In  recent  years, \nthe  Republic  of  Korea has  been  pursuing  free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  with  trade  partners in \nboth  the  developed  world  and  developing  world.  In  view  of  the  potentially  large  benefits  of \nservices  trade,  in  the  future  Korean  policymakers  should  consider  high-level  FTAs  which \nexplicitly incorporate services trade. In fact, the Republic of Korea\u2019s recently formed FTAs with \nthe United States and European Union are good examples of such high-level FTAs that seek to \npromote  services  trade.  International  investment  agreements  (IIAs)  lubricate  FDI  in  both \nservices and industry. Even in the absence of IIAs, policymakers can unilaterally reduce barriers \nto FDI. \n \n \n\nV.    CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \n\nThe Korean economic miracle is largely based on a dynamic world-class manufacturing sector \nwhich exports goods all over the world. Korean manufacturers such as Samsung, Hyundai and \nLG are world leaders in their respective industries, and make and export a wide range of high-\ntech  manufactured  goods  such  as  mobile  phones,  LCDs  and  automobiles.  High  savings  and \ninvestment  rates  enabled  the  Republic  of  Korea  to  quickly  build  up  a  large  stock  of  physical \ncapital  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  Just  as  importantly,  openness  to  advanced  foreign \ntechnology and a well-educated workforce capable of learning and absorbing such technology \nallowed the Republic of Korea\u2019s manufacturing sector to technologically level up rapidly. While \nthis  growth  model  of  export-oriented  industrialization  delivered  sustained  fast  growth  for \ndecades,  the  Republic  of  Korea  currently  finds  itself  at  a  pivotal  crossroads  between  a \nmanufacturing-led  past  and  an  increasingly  services-oriented  future.  The  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector is maturing with high productivity levels and limited room for further growth. \nThis means that the service sector, especially productivity growth in that sector, will have to play \na  bigger  role  in  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  future  growth.  All  the  more  so  since  the  Republic  of \nKorea\u2019s  exceptionally  rapid  population  aging,  combined  with  growing  income  equality,  implies \ngreater scope for certain services\u2014e.g., health care, long term care, and basic public services. \n \n\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s experience of industrialization and deindustrialization is in line \nwith the earlier experiences of the advanced economies. The share of industry and services in \noutput  and  employment  typically  rise  at  the  expense  of  agriculture  during  the  industrialization \nprocess. As industry matures and deindustrialization sets in, the share of services rises at the \nexpense of industry while agriculture continues to fall. In the case of the Republic of Korea, the \ncore  problem  is  that  although  the  share  of  services  in  output  and  employment  has  risen,  its \nproductivity growth has underperformed. Our analysis resoundingly confirms the popular belief \nthat  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  still  lags  the  manufacturing  sector  even  though \ndeindustrialization  already  began  in  the  early  1990s.  Therefore,  the  center  of  gravity  of  the \nKorean  economy  is  shifting  from  a  dynamic  world-class  manufacturing  sector  to  a  stagnant \nthird-class service sector, dragging down productivity growth for the economy as a whole. The \ncentral challenge for the Republic of Korea in the post-industrial phase is thus to overhaul and \nupgrade  its  service  sector  so  that  a  productive,  high  value-added,  modern  service  sector  can \nbecome an engine of growth. \n\n \n\n                                          \n12   For example, Kim and Kim (2003) find a productivity improvement in distribution services where there was a large \n\ninflow of FDI due to liberalization in the 1990s. \n\n\f30      \u0406      ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \n\nThe  underwhelming  performance  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  up  to  now \ngives rises to serious doubts about its future contribution to aggregate growth. Furthermore, we \nsaw that the sector faces a daunting array of impediments it must overcome if it is to fulfill its \npotential.  For  example,  while  deregulation  can  unleash  competition  and  thus  encourage  the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s services firms to raise their game, their underlying motivation\u2014protection of \nSMEs  and  SME  jobs\u2014makes  it  politically  difficult  to  pursue.  Nevertheless,  upon  closer \ninspection, there are some grounds for optimism about the Korean service sector\u2019s prospects. \nAbove all, high value-added services activities, which are the biggest area of weakness in the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s service sector, require high levels of human capital. The Republic of Korea\u2019s \nhighly educated workforce, which enabled it to quickly move up the technological ladder, can in \nprinciple  also  serve  as  a  key  ingredient  in  the  leveling  up  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service \nsector.  In  addition,  the  Korean  entertainment  industry\u2019s  well-known  success  in  exporting  its \nproducts\u2014i.e.,  the  Korean  wave\u2014suggests  that  it  is  possible  for  the  Republic  of  Korea  to \nbecome a major services exporter. Notwithstanding such strengths, the Republic of Korea faces \na formidable challenge in upgrading its service sector.   \n \n\n\f \n\nPerformance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea      \u0406      31 \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nCho,  Dongchul.  2009.

The analysis confirms the \nconventional wisdom of an underperforming service sector in the country. The paper \nidentifies factors underlying the poor performance and sets forth policy recommendations \nfor addressing them.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. \n \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
