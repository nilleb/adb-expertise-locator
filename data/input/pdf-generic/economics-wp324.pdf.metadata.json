INTRODUCTION \n \nBy any measure, the Republic of Korea has been one of the most successful economies in the \npostwar period.1 Export-oriented industrialization endowed the country with a highly competitive \nmanufacturing sector which produces and exports, among others, mobile phones, automobiles, \nelectronics products, ships, and steel, to all corners of the world. There is, however, a general \nperception that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector has long lagged its dynamic world-class \nmanufacturing sector. There are a number of reasons why developing the service sector matters \nfor  the  Republic  of  Korea.  For  one,  the  fact  that  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  manufacturing \nindustries are globally competitive suggests that they have reached high productivity levels and \nthe  scope  for  further  productivity  improvements  is  limited.  In  striking  contrast,  the  service \nsector\u2019s productivity remains low compared to advanced economies\u2014it was second lowest \namong Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies, after \nPoland (see Cho 2009)\u2014so there is plenty of scope for productivity improvement. Put differently, \ndeveloping the hitherto underdeveloped service sector can help to sustain growth at a time \nwhen the manufacturing sector is maturing and subject to growing competitive pressures from \nless  developed  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  elsewhere. \nFurthermore, it will facilitate the Republic of Korea\u2019s transition to a post-industrial, services-led \neconomy. \n \nWhile growth has been respectable and the economy has continued to expand at a \nhealthy pace since the Asian crisis, there has nevertheless been a clear loss of economic \ndynamism since then. The Republic of Korea\u2019s per capita income has reached levels where \ngrowth typically tends to slow down. At the same time, the weaker performance may partly \nreflect the difficult structural challenge of moving from a manufacturing-led economy to a more \nbalanced economy in which services plays a larger role. In the case of a high-income, high-tech \neconomy such as the Republic of Korea, what is especially relevant in the context of service \nsector  development  are  high-end  services  such  as  computing  and  business  services  as \nopposed to low-end services such as housecleaning and barber shops. In addition, while the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s exports are skewed toward manufactured goods, there may be some high-\nend tradable services in which the Republic of Korea has a potential comparative advantage\u2014\ne.g., medical tourism. \n \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s rapid demographic transition, along with growing levels of \nincome inequality and relative poverty, provide further impetus for a more robust service sector \n(Jones 2012, Noland 2012). The Republic of Korea\u2019s exceptionally fast population aging is \ndriven by the collapse of fertility to one of the lowest in the world at around 1.2 children. The \ncountry currently has the fourth youngest population in the OECD area but will have the second \noldest by 2050. A large and growing elderly population will increase the demand for certain \ntypes of services. For example, the demand for health care is higher among the elderly than the \nnon-elderly. Likewise, the physical frailty of the elderly implies a greater demand for long-term \ncare and other services involving physical assistance. In addition, the need for affordable, \nadequate, and sustainable old-age income support can stimulate the demand for financial \nservices.  At  the  same  time,  growing  income  inequality  points  to  a  need  to  expand  social \nspending. In this connection, public services, which enhance the productivity of low-income \ngroups through education, training, and re-training and thus improve equality of opportunity, \nare critical. \n                                          \n1   Recently CNN reports that there are only two countries, the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, that have grown \nat an average annual pace of more than 5% for the last five decades in a row (available at \nhttp://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/25/sharma-five-decades-of-five-percent-growth/). ", "2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \nIn this paper we examine the performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. In \nSection II we empirically examine and confirm the conventional wisdom that the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s service sector lags its manufacturing sector. In Section III we analyze some possible \nfactors underlying the poor performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s services. Section IV sets \nforth some policy options for strengthening the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. Section V \nconcludes the paper. \n \n \nII. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR:  \nAN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT  \n \nAs noted above, there is a widespread perception that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector \nperforms poorly relative to its dynamic world-class manufacturing sector.2 In this section, we \nempirically investigate the extent to which this perception is borne out by actual data. \n \nFigure 1 of Park and Shin (2012) shows the shares of agriculture, industry, and services \nin employment during 1980\u20132000 and their shares in gross domestic product (GDP) during \n1960\u20132000. The share of agriculture continuously declined. Interestingly, although the process \nof industrialization started in the 1960s the share of agriculture exceeded 30% even in 1980. \nThe trend is consistent with the stylized fact of the demographic hollowing out of rural areas \nwhich leaves them with an increasingly older population. Up to the early 1990s, the share of \nboth industry and services in employment rises as rural residents, especially younger residents, \nmoved to the cities during the industrialization process. Since the early 1990s, with the advent \nof deindustrialization and the Republic of Korea\u2019s shift into the post-industrial phase, the share \nof industry fell but the share of services continued to rise. \n \nThe share of the three sectors in GDP shows a similar pattern. As might be expected, \nthe share of agriculture fell sharply and continuously as the Republic of Korea industrialized. \nThe share of industry rose steadily until the early 1990s when it peaked and has more or less \nstabilized since then, albeit with substantial volatility. On the other hand, the share of services in \nGDP rose steadily until the early 2010s although it has fluctuated around 60% since then. A \ncomparison of the evolution of the shares of services in employment and GDP since 1980 \nreveals  a  marked  difference  between  the  two.  More  precisely,  the  share  of  services  in \nemployment has grown noticeably faster and more consistently than its share in GDP. Output \ngrowth has thus failed to keep pace with employment growth in services. \n \nA well-known stylized fact of economic growth and development is that the share of \nservices in GDP tends to increase as a country becomes richer. Figure 1 shows how the share \nof service sector in the Republic of Korea\u2019s GDP and employment evolved over time as its per \ncapita GDP increased rapidly. We follow Eichengreen and Gupta (2009) and Park and Shin \n(2012) to estimate a quartic relationship between per capita GDP and the shares of the service \nsector in GDP and employment. Figure 1(A) shows and compares the actual shares of the \nservice sector in the Republic of Korea\u2019s GDP with the line fitted on the basis of the quartic \nregression for two sub-periods: 1970\u20131989 and 1990\u20132010. We divide the sample period at \n1990 because the Republic of Korea\u2019s deindustrialization (in terms of employment) started \naround this year. Figure 1(b) shows and compares the actual shares of the service sector in the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s employment with line fitted on the basis of the quartic regression for two \nsub-periods:  1980\u20131989  and  1990\u20132010.  Since  employment  data  are  available  from  1980 \nonward, the first year in this figure is 1980. In both figures we denote the 95% confidence bands \n                                          \n2 See Jones (2009).

While the share of the service sector in GDP lies below the predicted line in both \nperiods, 1970\u20131989 and 1990\u20132010, the share of the service sector in employment lies more or \nless on the predicted line. This implies that labor in the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector does \nnot produce as much value added as other countries of a similar per capita GDP levels. \n \nFigure 1.

While the employment share in the Republic of Korea is lower than that in developed \ncountries, the gap is much smaller. Therefore, not only has the Republic of Korea\u2019s services \noutput growth lagged its services employment growth over time, but relative to developed \ncountries, the Republic of Korea\u2019s services output lags its services employment. Both trends \nimply weak labor productivity growth in the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. It is also striking \nto compare the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector performance to that of Taipei,China, a fellow \nnewly industrialized economy (NIE) at a similar income level. In 2009, Taipei, China, had a \nhigher GDP share of services\u201468.5% versus the Republic of Korea\u2019s 61.0%\u2014along with a \nhigher employment share\u201467.8% versus the Republic of Korea\u2019s 58.9%. While the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s services share of GDP is comparable to that of South American countries and Eastern \nEuropean countries, its services share of employment is higher than those of other countries \nexcept Argentina. As emphasized by Eichengreen, Perkins, and Shin (2012), the employment \nshare of services grew at an exceptional speed in the Republic of Korea, surging from 37% in \n1980 to 67.8% by 2009. This suggests that the deindustrialization process may have been too \nfast and labor productivity growth in the service sector has not kept pace with it. \n \nTable 1.

In Asian and Eastern European countries, in general labor \nproductivity growth rate in services is lower than in industry. This is in line with widespread \nperception  of  Asian  economies,  especially  those  in  East  and  Southeast  Asia,  as  having \nrelatively  well-developed  manufacturing  sectors  and  underdeveloped  service  sector.  The \nexception is India, where labor productivity growth rate in service is much higher than in industry. \nThis is not surprising in light of India\u2019s well-known success as the world\u2019s foremost information \n3\ncommunications technology and business process outsourcing (ICT-BPO) services exporter.  In \nSouth American countries and developed countries, labor productivity growth rate in services is \nas high as or only slightly lower than in industry. In the Republic of Korea\u2019s case, however, there \nis a huge gap between the labor productivity growth of industry and services. In both the 1980s \nand 2000s, compared to other countries, the difference is largest in the Republic of Korea. \nAgain, in the international context, the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector underperforms and \nunderperforms noticeably.  \n \nTable 2 .

The index is calculated \nby dividing labor productivity of the service sector by aggregate labor productivity.

Therefore, the index gauges whether the service sector workers are more or less \nproductive than workers in the economy as a whole. We measure it twice, for the averages of \nthe 1990s and 2000s. Relative services labor productivity is higher than 1 in a number of \ncountries. In general, it is higher, the less developed the country.

World Development Indicators online database (accessed 14 March 2012). \n \n \nAccording to Eichengreen and Gupta (2009), there are two distinct waves of service \nsector growth and development. In the first wave, the service sector share of output begins to \nrise at relatively modest incomes but at a decelerating rate as the economy grows. In the \nsecond wave, the share rises again at higher level of incomes. Importantly, the two waves are \npopulated by different kinds of services. The first wave is characterized by the rise of the \ntraditional services\u2014lodging, meal preparation, housecleaning, beauty, and barber shops\u2014\nwhile the second wave is dominated by the supplementation of modern services\u2014banking, \ninsurance, computing, communication, and business services. Based on the above findings, \nthey defined three groups of services according to whether their shares of GDP have fallen, ", "8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \nrisen slowly, or risen rapidly over time.4 The first group (group I) includes traditional services: \nretail and wholesale trade, transport and storage, public administration and defense. In many \ncountries,  particularly  in  advanced  countries,  the  share  of  this  group  in  GDP  has  fallen \nnoticeably over time. The second group (group II) is a hybrid of traditional and modern services \nand this group includes education; health and social work; hotels and restaurants; and other \ncommunity, social, and personal services. Their shares rise slowly with time. The final group \n(group III) consists of modern services consumed by both the household and corporate sectors \nand  this  group  includes  financial  intermediation,  computer  services,  business  services, \ncommunication, and legal and technical services. The share of the final group in GDP has been \nincreasing very rapidly in recent years. In light of its high income and development level, what is \nmost relevant and crucial for the Republic of Korea is to develop services in group III. \n \nTable 3 shows the shares of service group I, II, and III in (a) output (GDP) and (b) \nemployment. In each panel, the first column is for the United States, the second column for EU-\n15 average, and the third column for the Republic of Korea. The share of the first group in \noutput decreased over time in all three cases. However, its share is still large comparable to that \nof either group II or III. In fact, in the Republic of Korea it still remains the largest group. The \nshare of the second group in output increased moderately over time. The share of the third \ngroup increased most rapidly over time. The Republic of Korea\u2019s share of every group is lower \nthan that of either the United States or European Union. In particular, the share of the third \ngroup in output is particularly small for the Republic of Korea. This is mainly due to the low \nshare of other business activities. Other business activities include all the business related \nservices not related to real estate activities and they are a key area where productivity growth is \nhigh in many advanced countries. Other than business activities, the output share of health and \nsocial work is also particularly small. \n \nThe employment share shows a similar pattern over time. One difference is that the \nshare of the first group for EU-15 countries did not decrease over time. The difference in the \nemployment share between the Republic of Korea and the European Union is very small in \ngroups I and II. However the difference remains still large in group III. The employment share of \nhealth and social work, and other business activities is especially small.  \n \nThere are some subcategories such as other community, social, and personal service, \nand hotels and restaurants, where the employment share of the Republic of Korea is particularly \nlarge.  Areas  where  output  share  is  very  low  relative  to  employment  share  are:  group  I \n(wholesale trade, transport, and storage), group II (other community, social, and personal), and \ngroup III (other business activities). These are thus service subcategories where the Republic of \nKorea suffers from serious labor productivity problems. \n \n                                          \n4   Eichengreen and Gupta did not include real estate activities; private households with employed persons; and \nextra-territorial organizations and bodies in the classification of group I, II, and III.

Table 4 reports the \ngrowth rate of TFP in the service subsectors. We use TFP growth for industry value added, \nobtained from the EU KLEMS (capital, labor, energy, materials, services) database.5 It \ncalculates TFP growth by subtracting weighted cost share of capital and labor inputs growth \nfrom the industry value-added growth at constant prices. Instead of using standard measures of \nlabor input, such as numbers employed or hours worked, it measures labor input as labor \nservices which takes the heterogeneity of the labor force into account. Our key findings are as \nfollows. TFP growth in group III is not always higher, but it is higher than in group I or II in the \nmost recent period, 2001\u20132007, in all three economies. Despite its low level of technology \nrelative to the United States or European Union, the Republic of Korea\u2019s growth rate of TFP in \ngroup I and II is as low as in those two economies. The growth rate of TFP in group III for the \nRepublic of Korea is higher than in the United States and European Union. However, this is \nprobably  due  to  the  high  growth  rate  of  TFP  in  financial  intermediation  and  post  and \ntelecommunication. The growth rate of TFP in other business activities is particularly low in the \nRepublic of Korea. Our results for TFP growth are generally consistent with those for labor \nproductivity growth.  \n \nIn sum, the evidence from this section resoundingly confirms the conventional wisdom \nthat  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  service  sector  performs  poorly  and  lags  its  world-class \nmanufacturing sector. This implies that there is plenty of scope for developing the service sector \nand more well-developed services can contribute a lot to economic growth and dynamism. \nAmong the service sectors, it is business related activities which are most far behind. Yet it is \nprecisely such service activities which are most pivotal to strengthening the service sector in a \nhigh-income economy such as the Republic of Korea. Other service areas which perform poorly \ninclude  wholesale  trade,  transport  and  storage,  and  other  community,  social  and  personal \nservices. \n \n                                          \n5   A detailed explanation on the calculation of TFP in the EU KLEMS database can be found in Timmer, O\u2019Mahony, \nand van Ark (2007).

WHY DOES THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA\u2019S SERVICE SECTOR PERFORM SO BADLY? \nSOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS \n \nIn the preceding section, we saw that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector performs poorly in \nthe international context, especially relative to its income and development level. The obvious \nquestion to ask is why? In this section, we will explore four possible explanations.6 First, too \nrapid deindustrialization, most evident in the sharp rise in the share of services in employment, \nmay have led to a lot of underemployment in marginal services jobs. Second, government \nregulations and restrictions, which are designed to protect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \nand service sector jobs, may hold back the growth of the service sector. Third, relatively low \nresearch and development (R&D) expenditures in the service sector and low ICT investments \nmay hinder innovation in services and thus movement to high value-added service activities. \nFourth, barriers to services trade and FDI, designed to protect domestic firms and industries \nfrom foreign competition, weaken their incentives to become more efficient. We now examine \neach of the four potential explanations in more detail. \n \nA.  Too Rapid Deindustrialization and Underemployment in Services  \nAs evident in Table 1 above, the share of services in employment grew at an exceptional \nspeed.7 The frantic pace of the reallocation of labor from manufacturing to services in the \nRepublic of Korea has made it difficult for some workers to find new employment and hence \nthey  end  up  in  disguised  unemployment  in  the  service  sector,  which  contributes  to  low \nproductivity growth in the service sector. That is, they end up underemployed in marginal \nservice sector jobs. Based on shift-share analysis, Eichengreen, Perkins and Shin (2012) find \nthat roughly 70% of the growth of aggregate labor productivity in the Republic of Korea in 1970\u2013\n2007 was attributable to the within effect\u2014i.e., economy-wide increases in productivity holding \nsectoral shares constant\u2014which is not due to the reallocation of workers. In particular, they find \nthat it was manufacturing with its relatively fast productivity growth that mainly accounts for the \nwithin  effect.  The  role  of  the  shift  effect  that  is  due  to  reallocation  of  workers  from  low \nproductivity  to  high  productivity  sectors  is  relatively  minor.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  labor \nreallocation from manufacturing to service sectors did not contribute a lot to productivity growth. \nTo the contrary, the too rapid reallocation of labor to the service sector holds down the growth of \nservice sector productivity. \n \nB.  Government Regulations and Restrictions \nWhile the objective of the Korean government\u2019s regulations and restrictions on the service \nsector is to protect SMEs and jobs, there is a serious risk that they end up stifling the growth \nand dynamism of the sector. We follow Woefl et al. (2010) to construct Table 5 based on the \nconcept of product market regulation (PMR) indicators. According to Woefl et al. (2010), the \nunderlying idea behind the PMR indicators is to turn qualitative information such as laws and \nregulations  that  may  affect  competition  into  quantitative  indicators.  They  seek  to  measure \nregulations which are potentially anti-competitive in areas where competition is viable, and look \nprimarily  at  policy settings  instead  of  market outcomes. The  economy-wide  PMR  indicator \n                                          \n6   Jones (2009) also examines factors behind the low productivity of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector. In \nparticular, he emphasizes (i) the legacy of an export-led growth strategy that attracted the most productive \nresources into manufacturing, (ii) insufficient competition in services due to heavy regulations, (iii) low R&D and \nICT investment, and (iv) the weakness of SMEs.  \n7   This is also emphasized by Kim (2006) as a structural problem for the Korean economy. ", "Performance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea   \u0406   15 \n \ncovers both general and sectoral regulatory issues in three domains \u2014state control, barriers to \nentrepreneurship, and barriers to trade and investment.  \n \nTable 5 reports PMR scores for the three domains for OECD average and five Asian \ncountries\u2014PRC, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.8 The Republic of Korea\u2019s \neconomy-wide PMR score is 1.48, a little bit higher than OECD average (1.36) but much lower \nthan that of other countries such as PRC (3.30), India (2.84) and Indonesia (2.73). A lower score \nmeans less restrictions. The indicator for state control in the Republic of Korea (1.99) is lower \nthan that of the OECD average (2.04). The indicator for barriers to entrepreneurship is also \nlower for the Republic of Korea (1.14) than the OECD (1.42). However, the Republic of Korea \ndoes poorly in the score for administrative burdens on startups, especially for corporation\u2014i.e., \nthe Republic of Korea (2.75) vs. the OECD (1.36). The Republic of Korea does particularly \npoorly in the score for barriers to entry in services\u2014i.e., the Republic of Korea (2.31) vs. the \nOECD (1.76). In this category, in fact, the Republic of Korea fares even worse than India and \nIndonesia. The Republic of Korea also scores poorly in the indicators for barriers to trade and \ninvestment\u2014i.e., the Republic of Korea (1.30) vs. the OECD (0.63). In particular, the scores for \ntariffs (the Republic of Korea\u2019s 2.00 vs. the OECD\u2019s 1.31) and other regulatory barriers (1.60 vs. \n0.79) are low. \n \nA lot of government restrictions on the service sector are geared toward the protection of \nemployment in SMEs. As such, it would be useful to examine the status of SMEs in the Republic \nof Korea. The relative labor productivity as measured by the relative value added per person \nemployed in SMEs for the service sector as a whole changed from 49% (=26.1/53.3) of large \nfirms in 2001 to 41% (=61.1/148.1) in 2009 (as calculated from the bottom line). The problem of \npoor labor productivity in SMEs thus grew worse since labor productivity growth over the past \nten years was considerably higher among large firms than among SMEs. \n \nThe  problem  is  more  severe  in  more  traditional  service  sectors.  The  relative  labor \nproductivity of SMEs in group I plunged from 52% to 29% during the same period. The relative \nproductivity of SMEs in group II declined from 58% to 36%, and from 92% to 66% in group III. A \nsizable gap in productivity between large and small firms is evident in every group. However, as \na result of different relative productivity growth, the gap is now smallest in group III. This reflects \nthe fact that the regulations tend to protect SMEs engaged in more traditional services. More \nspecifically, the gap is particularly large in wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, \neducation, arts and sports, and real estate and renting, where restrictive regulations are heavy \nand low-productivity SMEs can still survive. However, it is worrisome that the productivity gap is \nalso widening even in the most modern service sector, group III. Heavy government protection \nof SMEs is motivated by their high share in employment. The share of SMEs in employment \neven increased further from 86.3% to 91.2% (total), 90.9% to 95.7% (group I), 92.1% to 93.9% \n(group II), and 71.2% to 78.9% (group III).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n8   For Asia, the PMR indicators are available for only five countries.

Product Market Regulation database (accessed 14 March 2012). ", "Performance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea   \u0406   17 \n \nC.  Low R&D Expenditures and Low ICT Investment \nAnother possible explanation for the poor performance of the service sector in the Republic of \nKorea is relatively low R&D expenditures and low ICT investment, which hinder innovation in \nservices and moving up the value chain toward higher value-added services activities.9 R&D \nintensity of a sector is measured as R&D expenditures as a percentage of value added in \nthe sector. Data are collected from OECD STAN Indicators. The data are for the most \nrecent  years  available,  2004\u20132009.  The  R&D  intensity  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s \nmanufacturing is higher than the OECD average. It is ninth highest out of 33 countries. In \ncontrast, the R&D intensity of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector is lower than the OECD \naverage. It is only eighteenth out of 33 countries. Therefore, in the Republic of Korea there are \nvisibly more innovative investments in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector. This \nmay  help  to  explain  why  services  lag  behind  manufacturing  in  productivity.  As  evident  in \nFigure 3, for every services group, R&D intensity in the Republic of Korea underperforms the \nOECD average. The gap is largest for group 1, which is subject to most regulatory restrictions \nand thus provides the least incentive for investing in R&D. \n \nIn the EU KLEMS database, ICT investment is defined as investment in computing \nequipment,  communication  equipment,  and  software.  From  ICT  investment,  the  database \nconstructs ICT capital. Then based on the standard growth accounting exercise, value-added \ngrowth is decomposed into the contributions of capital\u2014both ICT and non ICT, labor, and \nmultifactor productivity. In general, ICT contribution is largest for group III, followed by group II, \nand lowest in group I. This is intuitively plausible because modern services stand to gain the \nmost from application of ICT. In general, ICT\u2019s contribution to value added growth grows larger \nover time if we exclude the last subsample period. Interestingly, ICT\u2019s contribution declines in \nevery country in the last period. As might be expected, ICT\u2019s contribution is larger in group III, \nthe modern service sector, than in group I or II. When we compare the Republic of Korea with \nthe United States and European Union, the contribution of ICT capital in the Republic of Korea \nis lower and it is markedly lower for group I. The difference is smallest in group III.

Barriers to Services Trade and Barriers to FDI in Services \nJust like barriers to goods trade and barriers to FDI in manufacturing, the main objective of \nbarriers to services trade and barriers to FDI in services is to protect domestic firms and \nindustries from foreign competition. The standard argument for opening up trade and FDI is also \nidentical for both manufacturing and services\u2014they encourage domestic firms and industries to \nbecome more efficient in order to survive foreign competition. By the same token, the standard \nargument against barriers to trade and FDI in both sectors is that they hamper productivity \ngrowth by diluting competitive pressures and hence incentives of domestic players to raise \ntheir game. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n9   There are a number of studies that find that ICT investment enhances productivity.

In most countries, service trade share in total trade has increased over time. This is \nparticularly true in India and the United Kingdom. It also has increased in the Republic of Korea, \nbut the increase is minimal, particularly from 2000 to 2010. Compared to other Asian economies, \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s services trade share is not large; in fact, it is smaller than Hong Kong, \nChina; Pakistan; Philippines (except in 2000); and Singapore. The Republic of Korea\u2019s share is \ncomparable to that of South American countries and Eastern European countries, and it is lower \nthan that in most developed countries. The only exception is Germany, which is well known for \nits strong bias toward manufacturing and relatively underdeveloped services. In the Republic of \nKorea, the share of services in imports is larger than that in exports (except in 1990). This is \nalso true for South American countries. In the case of the Republic of Korea, the difference \ngrows  larger  over  time.

The fact that the Republic of \nKorea ranks among the world\u2019s five biggest exporters of manufactures is a vivid testament to its \nstatus as a globally significant manufacturer.

We also include a KOR dummy variable in the last two \ncolumns. A number of findings emerge from our estimation of the above gravity equation. The fit \nof the gravity equation for service trade is as good as the fit for total trade. The estimated \ncoefficients for distance and number of islands are smaller when we use service trade as a \ndependent variable. Service is weightless, which means that physical distance and shipping \nmatters less than for goods trade. The estimated coefficient for common language is larger for \nservice trade. Communication matters more for service trade. The effects of currency union and \nregional trade on service trade are at least as large as their effects on total trade. The estimated \ncoefficients for colony related variables are larger for service trade. Again, communication \nmatters more for service trade. The estimated coefficient for the KOR dummy is positive in both \ncases but it is smaller for service trade. This implies that the Republic of Korea trades more in \ngoods and services and in services alone than a comparable country but the degree of over-\ntrading is less for service trade. \n \nWith respect to FDI inflows, the share of service sector FDI in total FDI was much \nsmaller than the OECD average in 2006.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nThe analysis of the previous two sections, which empirically confirmed the poor performance of \nthe Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector and tested some potential explanations for the poor \nperformance, gives rise to some policy implications. In this section, we explore policy options for \nimproving the performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s underperforming service sector. Some of \nour policy options echo those of Pilat (2005) and Jones (2009) although they are more specific \nto the Republic of Korea. \n \nA.  Policies  to  Cope  with  Too  Rapid  Deindustrialization  and  Underemployment  in \nServices \n \nThe very rapid rise in the service sector\u2019s share of employment, in conjunction with a markedly \nslower rise in its share of GDP, implies that the sector has been acting as an absorber of surplus \nworkers  who  are  unable  to  find  productive  employment  in  the  face  of  the  structural \ntransformation. Since many of those workers end up in marginal, low-productivity, low-wage \nservices jobs, this brings down the productivity of the service sector. The appropriate policy \nresponse does not involve slowing down the pace of deindustrialization, which reflects market \nforces and contributes to the dynamism and efficiency of the Republic of Korea\u2019s world-class \nmanufacturing  sector.  Instead  it  should  be  based  on  facilitating  and  mitigating  the  large \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  structural  shift  from  manufacturing  to  services.  For \nexample, more flexible labor markets can help to reduce the structural unemployment arising \nfrom deindustrialization. Similarly, more assistance to those workers seeking new jobs, for \nexample well-designed training programs, can help dislocated workers from the manufacturing \nsector look for and find jobs which better match their qualifications in the new service industries. \n \nB.  Policies to Speed Up the Republic of Korea\u2019s Successful Transition to a Post-\nIndustrial Economy \n \nThose sets of policies are related to and complementary to policies to cope with too rapid \ndeindustrialization. According to our analysis, what lies at the heart of the poor performance and \nunderdevelopment of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector is a failure to move into higher \nvalue-added services activities. While its income is converging toward OECD levels, in one \nimportant  sense,  its  economic  structure  is  not.  Although  the  share  of  services  in  both \nemployment and output has been rising, much of the growth has come from traditional services \nrather  than  modern  services.  That  is,  while  the  country\u2019s  service  sector  has  experienced \nquantitative expansion, it has a lot of scope for qualitative leveling up. The country\u2019s large \nservices  imports  and  persistent  deficit  in  services  trade  suggests  that  there  is  substantial \ndemand  for  services.  In  particular,  its  high  income  and  development  level  implies  a  large \ndemand for high-end services. One obvious policy implication is for government to subsidize the \ntraining and re-training of workers so they can help to meet this demand. In addition, the \ngovernment can provide fiscal and other incentives to promote high value-added services such \nas design and prototyping at the beginning of the global value chain (GVC) and marketing and \nbranding at the end of the GVC. According to the smile curve hypothesis, most of the value \nadded in GVC lies in high-end services activities at both ends of the GVC rather than pure \nmanufacturing, or simply making things, in the middle.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \nC.  Deregulation \n \nOur analysis indicates that the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector faces substantial government \nregulations and restrictions, which aim to protect SMEs and SME jobs in the sector. Examples \nof such regulations and restrictions include strict entry and licensing requirements, stringent \napproval requirements, and significant government involvement and price controls. Since the \nvery objective of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector regulations is to protect a specific group \nof firms from competition, they reduce competitive pressures and are likely to be a significant \ncontributor to the sector\u2019s poor productivity performance. According to Pilat (2005), OECD \ncountries\u2019 experiences with regulatory reforms have been, by and large, very positive. For \nexample, in many OECD countries, deregulation of air passenger transportation and road freight \nhas delivered substantial benefits in the form of lower prices, new services, and higher labor \nand  capital  productivity.  However,  given  the  often  large  adjustment  costs  of  services \nderegulation\u2014e.g., the entry of a big supermarket chain wiping out small neighborhood stores\u2014\nit is probably best to pursue services deregulation as a gradual, evolutionary process. \n \nD.  More R&D Expenditures and More ICT Investment \n \nRelative  to  other  OECD  countries,  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  R&D  expenditures  and  ICT \ninvestments are relatively low. This can be a significant barrier against innovation in services \nand moving up the value ladder toward higher value-added services. Some of the policies that \nare beneficial for innovation in services are beneficial for innovation in general. For example, \nstrengthening  intellectual  property  protection  will  strengthen  incentives  for  R&D  and  other \ninnovative activities in both services and manufacturing sectors. At the same time, given the \npotentially large positive spillovers from services innovations, the government has to resolve the \ntradeoff between encouraging innovation and the diffusion of innovation to the rest of the \neconomy. It is also possible to directly stimulate R&D in services by providing tax credits and \ngrants. One technology which is a particularly powerful tool for improving services productivity is \nICT, which has revolutionized the delivery of services. In order to maximize the potential benefits \nof ICT for services, the government should ensure a competitive environment in the ICT industry. \nInnovation  will  be  especially  helpful  for  modern  services,  where  the  Republic  of  Korea \nlags visibly. \n \nIn  ICT-advanced  countries  such  as  the  United  States,  the  private  sector  plays  an \nimportant role so that many ICT investments are made via venture capital provided to creative \nventure firms. Venture capital for ICT activities in the Republic of Korea slowed down markedly \nafter the burst of the ICT bubble in 2001 and began to bounce back only in 2006.11 However \nthis recovery was largely attributable to the government support through policy funds such as \nthe Korea Venture Fund. Heavy direct involvement of the government in providing venture \ncapital can result in inefficient allocation of funds. Therefore, policy should be directed more \ntoward  stimulating  private  venture  capital  which  eventually  contributes  to  efficient  ICT \ninvestment in the service sector. \n \nE.  Remove Barriers to Services Trade and Barriers to FDI in Services  \n \nBarriers to services trade and FDI inflows into services protect domestic firms and industries \nfrom foreign competition, and thus dilute their incentives to innovate and raise their productivity. \nTherefore, liberalizing trade and FDI can potentially contribute to improved efficiency in the \nservice sector. According to Pilat (2005), OECD studies find that trade and FDI in services \n                                          \n11  See Lee (2011). ", "Performance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea   \u0406   29 \n \ndelivers large benefits for OECD economies and developing countries alike. In the case of the \nRepublic of Korea, it is widely believed that opening up various sectors to FDI as part of post-\nAsian crisis structural reforms brought about substantial productivity gains.12 In recent years, \nthe Republic of Korea has been pursuing free trade agreements (FTAs) with trade partners in \nboth the developed world and developing world. In view of the potentially large benefits of \nservices  trade,  in  the  future  Korean  policymakers  should  consider  high-level  FTAs  which \nexplicitly incorporate services trade. In fact, the Republic of Korea\u2019s recently formed FTAs with \nthe United States and European Union are good examples of such high-level FTAs that seek to \npromote  services  trade.  International  investment  agreements  (IIAs)  lubricate  FDI  in  both \nservices and industry. Even in the absence of IIAs, policymakers can unilaterally reduce barriers \nto FDI. \n \n \nV.  CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \nThe Korean economic miracle is largely based on a dynamic world-class manufacturing sector \nwhich exports goods all over the world. Korean manufacturers such as Samsung, Hyundai and \nLG are world leaders in their respective industries, and make and export a wide range of high-\ntech manufactured goods such as mobile phones, LCDs and automobiles. High savings and \ninvestment rates enabled the Republic of Korea to quickly build up a large stock of physical \ncapital  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  Just  as  importantly,  openness  to  advanced  foreign \ntechnology and a well-educated workforce capable of learning and absorbing such technology \nallowed the Republic of Korea\u2019s manufacturing sector to technologically level up rapidly. While \nthis  growth  model  of  export-oriented  industrialization  delivered  sustained  fast  growth  for \ndecades,  the  Republic  of  Korea  currently  finds  itself  at  a  pivotal  crossroads  between  a \nmanufacturing-led past and an increasingly services-oriented future. The Republic of Korea\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector is maturing with high productivity levels and limited room for further growth. \nThis means that the service sector, especially productivity growth in that sector, will have to play \na bigger role in the Republic of Korea\u2019s future growth. All the more so since the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s exceptionally rapid population aging, combined with growing income equality, implies \ngreater scope for certain services\u2014e.g., health care, long term care, and basic public services. \n \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s experience of industrialization and deindustrialization is in line \nwith the earlier experiences of the advanced economies. The share of industry and services in \noutput and employment typically rise at the expense of agriculture during the industrialization \nprocess. As industry matures and deindustrialization sets in, the share of services rises at the \nexpense of industry while agriculture continues to fall. In the case of the Republic of Korea, the \ncore problem is that although the share of services in output and employment has risen, its \nproductivity growth has underperformed. Our analysis resoundingly confirms the popular belief \nthat the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector still lags the manufacturing sector even though \ndeindustrialization already began in the early 1990s. Therefore, the center of gravity of the \nKorean economy is shifting from a dynamic world-class manufacturing sector to a stagnant \nthird-class service sector, dragging down productivity growth for the economy as a whole. The \ncentral challenge for the Republic of Korea in the post-industrial phase is thus to overhaul and \nupgrade its service sector so that a productive, high value-added, modern service sector can \nbecome an engine of growth. \n \n                                          \n12  For example, Kim and Kim (2003) find a productivity improvement in distribution services where there was a large \ninflow of FDI due to liberalization in the 1990s. ", "30   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 324 \n \nThe underwhelming performance of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service sector up to now \ngives rises to serious doubts about its future contribution to aggregate growth. Furthermore, we \nsaw that the sector faces a daunting array of impediments it must overcome if it is to fulfill its \npotential. For example, while deregulation can unleash competition and thus encourage the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s services firms to raise their game, their underlying motivation\u2014protection of \nSMEs  and  SME  jobs\u2014makes  it  politically  difficult  to  pursue.  Nevertheless,  upon  closer \ninspection, there are some grounds for optimism about the Korean service sector\u2019s prospects. \nAbove all, high value-added services activities, which are the biggest area of weakness in the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s service sector, require high levels of human capital. The Republic of Korea\u2019s \nhighly educated workforce, which enabled it to quickly move up the technological ladder, can in \nprinciple also serve as a key ingredient in the leveling up of the Republic of Korea\u2019s service \nsector. In addition, the Korean entertainment industry\u2019s well-known success in exporting its \nproducts\u2014i.e., the Korean wave\u2014suggests that it is possible for the Republic of Korea to \nbecome a major services exporter. Notwithstanding such strengths, the Republic of Korea faces \na formidable challenge in upgrading its service sector.  \n ", "Performance of the Service Sector in the Republic of Korea   \u0406   31 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nCho, Dongchul. 2009.
