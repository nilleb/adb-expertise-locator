Consequently,\nthe contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has been\nmore than 60% per annum since 2000. The share of services in trade\nhas also increased substantially.1 This growth has been accompanied by\nincreasing  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  approvals  in  the  services\nsector.2\n\nThough these trends are in line with global trends, two features are\ndistinctive to India\u2019s services sector. First, in the period 1950s\u20131990s,\nthe share of agriculture in GDP declined by about 25 percentage points,\nwhile  industry  and  services  gained  equally.  The  share  of  industry  has\nstabilized since 1990 and consequently, the entire subsequent decline\nin the share of agriculture in GDP has been picked up by the services\nsector.  This  trend  (rising  share  of  services  in  GDP  and  corresponding\ndecline in the share of agriculture and manufacturing sector) is seen in\nthe  growth  process  of  high-income  countries  and  not  in  general  in\ndeveloping countries. During the 1990s, the contribution of the services\nsector to the growth of GDP in India was nearly 46%, in contrast to\n54%  in  middle-income  countries,  43%  in  least  developed  countries,\nand 34% in China.\n\nSecondly,  employment  in  services  has  not  been  in  proportion  to\ntheir  rising  share  in  GDP  and  trade  in  India,  unlike  in  the  rest  of  the\nworld.  In  1999-2000,  services  contributed  around  24%  of  employ-\nment in India, in contrast to 30% in middle-income countries, 70% in\nSingapore, and around 35% in Thailand.\n\nThese  features  of  India\u2019s  services-led  growth  cast  doubts  on  its\nsustainability  in  the  long  run.  The  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to\nexamine the reasons of these features and suggest policy directions to\n\n1 Services trade has grown at the same rate as goods trade over the 1990s,\n\ni.e. about 6.5%.\n\n2  FDI  approvals  in  services  sector  are  around  30%  of  FDI  approvals.  The\nshare of services in employment was around 24% on an average during 1990-\n2000.\n\n\fmake this growth sustainable. We first look at the growth pattern and\nemployment potential of disaggregated services. We next examine the\ntrade  potential  of  different  services  to  ascertain  the  sustainability  of\ngrowth of the services sector.\n\nGrowth in India\u2019s services sector has not been uniform across services.\nWhile some sectors experienced a double-digit growth rate some others\nhad  a  negative  growth  rate.  Prime  drivers  of  growth  were  business\nservices  (growing  by  almost  20%),  communication  services  (about\n13.6%),  banking  (about  13%)  and  hotels  and  restaurants  (around\n9%). Among the services witnessing a decline in growth were railways,\ndwellings and real estate, legal services, public administration, and defense\nservices.  In  terms  of  share  in  GDP  the  most  important  services  are\nwholesale  and  retail  trade  (14%)  followed  by  community  services\n(8.4%) and banking and insurance services (7%).\n\nGrowth  of  employment  differed  significantly  across  services  in  the\nperiod 1994\u20132000 as compared to 1983\u20131994. Growth of employ-\nment  fell  in  community,  social  and  personal  services  from  3.85%  to\n\u20132.08%. Fall in employment in this sector has important implications\nfor employment potential of the entire services sector since this sector\nwitnessed a rise in its growth3 and share in GDP in the 1990s. Another\nsector where employment growth fell is electricity, gas, and water supply.\nIn 1999-2000, the share of different services in employment was as\nfollows: trade, hotels and restaurants (around 34%), community, social\nand personal services (around 31%), construction (16%), and transport,\nstorage, and communication services (13%).\n\nThe  trends  in  employment  elasticity  of  different  services  sectors\nhave  also  changed  considerably  in  the  1990s  (Table  1).  The  trends\nshow that employment elasticity in the economy declined sharply from\n0.41 in the 1980s to 0.15 in the 1990s but it increased substantially\nin transport, storage, and communication sector. However, employment\nelasticity has fallen in sectors that are faster growing and make a relatively\nhigher contribution to GDP, namely, community, social, and personal\nservices and financial services. Employment elasticity fell also in wholesale\nand retail trade, which provided maximum employment in the services\nsector.\n\n3  Community,  social,  and  personal  services  grew  by  7.9%  on  an  average\n\nduring 1994\u20132004.\n\n2 Policy Brief No. 2\n\nTable 1.

Within the services\nsector, employment growth has been uneven. Services that have witnessed\nvery high growth rates, e.g. business and communications services, have\na  low  share  in  GDP  or  employment.  In  most  of  the  services  with\nsignificant  share  in  GDP  (trade,  community  services  and  banking  and\ninsurance) employment elasticity has declined in the latter half of the\n1990s.\n\nReasons for this \u2018Jobless Growth\u2019\n\nThis \u2018jobless growth\u2019 has three plausible explanations. First, sectors\nthat have large potential for generating employment, e.g. construction,\ntransport and professional services, have grown slowly. Faster growing\nsectors, e.g. services and communications and financial business services,\nhave a low potential for employment generation. In addition, employ-\nment  elasticity  has  declined  in  the  fast  growing  services  like  financial\nand community services.\n\nThe rising productivity levels in the faster growing services themselves\nmay be a reason for lack of growth in their employment potential. Few\nstudies  have  estimated  productivity  growth  in  services  because  of  the\ndifficulty in measuring their output. One of these studies, by McKinsey\n& Co. (2001) estimates labor productivity in six segments of India\u2019s\nservices  sector,  namely,  telecommunication,  software,  retail  banking,\n\nCritical Issues in India\u2019s Services-led Growth 3\n\n\fhousing  construction,  energy  distribution  (electricity)  and  retail\ndistribution. It finds that software services have the highest productivity\nlevels, followed by telecommunication, banking, and construction. These\nare also services that are growing faster and have high shares in GDP\nand  employment.  Higher  labor  productivity  in  these  segments  may\nhave slowed down growth in employment in services.\n\nAlso,  communication  and  software  services,  which  have  witnessed\nan increase in their trade, and therefore have grown substantially, have\na small employment potential. Therefore, trade liberalization in services\nhas not helped in generating large employment.\n\nWhat Explains India\u2019s Services Sector Growth\n\nStudies by Gordon and Gupta (2004) and Banga and Goldar (2004),\nwhich empirically assess the reasons for the growth of India\u2019s services\nsector  in  the  1990s,  conclude  that  both  demand  and  supply  factors\nhave  led  to  this  growth.  On  the  demand  side,  the  high  growth  of\nservices output was mostly attributed to factors such as increasing input\nusage  of  services  by  other  sectors,  mainly  manufacturing  sector  (i.e.\nhigher domestic demand); higher foreign demand due to trade liberaliza-\ntion;  and  high  income  elasticity  for  services.  On  the  supply  side,  the\nincreased  trade  in  services  following  trade  liberalization  policies  and\nother reforms in the 1990s induced this growth.\n\nOn  the  demand  side,  Banga  and  Goldar  (2004)  show  that  the\ncontribution  of  services  input  to  output  growth  in  manufacturing\n(organized), which was about 1% in the 1980s, increased to about 25%\nin the next decade. Gordon and Gupta (2004) show that the use of\nservices  sector  input  to  industry  increased  by  about  40%  between\n1979-80 and 1993-94. The role of elastic final demand for services is\ndifficult to measure, since it is difficult to split the growth in private final\nconsumption expenditure into expenditure on goods and that on services.\nNonetheless,  they  use  a  rough  estimate  and  conclude  that  there  has\nbeen a sharp growth in the final demand for services in the 1990s.\n\nOn the supply side, the percentage share of exports of services vis-\u00e0-\nvis merchandise exports in GDP has steadily risen. In 1998, the share\nof services in trade increased to 24.9% from 19.3% in 1995. Services\nthat contributed substantially to India\u2019s exports in the early 1990s were\ntransport, travel, communication, and financial services. However, the\n\ncomposition of India\u2019s exports of services has changed over the years.\nIn the period 1990\u201395 to 1996\u20132002, the relative share of travel in\nexports  has  fallen  from  39%  to  23%,  and  of  transportation  services\nfrom 24% to 15%. In contrast, the share of software services has risen\nsharply  from  34%  to  60%.  In  fact,  India  has  become  a  net  foreign\nexchange earner in total services after 1997-98. Net foreign exchange\nearning services are mainly travel, communication, and software services.\nIndia, however, is a net importer in services like transport, management,\nand financial services.\n\nThus, the growth of India\u2019s services sector may be attributed to:\n\n\u2022\n\nStructural changes that have led to increase in usage of services\nby other sectors;\n\n\u2022 Trade liberalization in services; and\n\u2022 Other reforms carried out in the 1990s.\n\nPolicy Directions: What Needs to be Done\n\nIndia\u2019s services sector has witnessed tremendous growth in the last\nten years but its employment potential has not grown proportionately.\nNeither has there been a corresponding growth in manufacturing, one\nof  the  largest  consumers  of  services.  This  has  cast  doubts  on  the\nsustainability  of  services-led  growth.  Not  only  do  services  that  have\nincreased their share in GDP and trade have small employment potential,\ntheir employment elasticity has fallen due to rising labor productivity.\n\nOne possible reason for this lopsided growth in services is lack of a\ncoherent  policy  with  respect  to  services.  For  lack  of  an  integrated\nservices policy analogous to the industrial policy and agricultural policy,\nreforms at the sectoral level have evolved in an ad-hoc, uneven manner.\nLiberalizing  a  particular  service,  e.g.  retail  trade,  will  fall  short  of  the\ndesired  impact  if  it  is  not  supported  by  liberalization  in  real  estate.\nSimilarly,  reforms  in  tourism  will  remain  half  measures  unless  corres-\nponding reforms are undertaken in domestic air travel.\n\nMoreover, given the large externalities of services,4 it is important to\nprovide services as efficiently as possible. The three services having the\n\n4 Hansda (2001) estimates the Ramsmussen index of backward and forward\nlinkage for 115 activities in different sectors and finds that services have maximum\nforward as well as backward linkages.\n\n4 Policy Brief No. 2\n\nCritical Issues in India\u2019s Services-led Growth 5\n\n\flargest  backward  and  forward  linkages  are  trade,  transport,  and\nconstruction. Transport (road, railways, and air) and construction services\nhave  large  external  economies  and  linkages,  but  in  India  these  two\nsectors have been slow-growing. Improving these infrastructure facilities\nwill not only enhance the country\u2019s attractiveness to foreign investment\nbut  also  improve  the  competitiveness  of  domestic  investment.  These\nsectors also have large potential for generating employment.\n\nTrade  in  services  can  suffer  from  both  external  and  domestic\nconstraints. External constraints or trade barriers are mainly in the form\nof  limits  on  foreign  equity  participation,  recognition,  and  licensing  of\nprovisions, immigration and labor market regulations, and discriminatory\ntreatment with respect to taxes, subsidies, and other policies. Domestic\nconstraints  may  result  from  infrastructure  inadequacies,  poor  quality\nand  standards,  lack  of  clear-cut  responsibilities  between  central  and\nstate governments, and other policy-related disincentives.\n\nIn order to examine the extent of external and domestic constraints\nto trade in India\u2019s services sector we classify services in terms of their\nexternal trade barriers, i.e. extent of liberalization (which is captured by\nthe  FDI  cap  and  restrictions  on  trade  in  Mode  4),  growth  rates,  and\nshare in exports of services (Table 2).\n\nIt is seen from Table 2 that not all services that have low external\ntrade  barriers  and  high  growth  rates  have  a  high  share  in  exports.  In\nparticular, health and education services have low external trade barriers\nand experience high growth rates but have a low share in exports. This\nreflects high domestic constraints in these services. It also indicates that\nthere exists a high potential to trade in health and education services\nbut domestic policies or infrastructure restricts trade.\n\nGiven the large potential for trade in these services, specific policies\nshould be designed to encourage trade in health and education sectors.\nIn  particular,  given  the  low-cost  quality  treatment  available  in  India,\nthere is a large scope for health tourism. India also has a competitive\nadvantage in the practice of alternative medicine. These areas should be\ndeveloped and exploited for trade opportunities. Since the health sector\nis on the concurrent list, i.e. both state and central governments have\njurisdiction  over  this  sector,  a  number  of  regulations  are  imposed  by\nthe state governments.5 Thus, though there is no cap on FDI in health\n\n5 There are also state-specific regulations of the town and planning departments\non the design and construction of healthcare infrastructure, which form important\ndomestic constraints to trade in health services.\n\n6 Policy Brief No. 2\n\nTable 2.

There is therefore a need to\nhave a clear-cut demarcation of responsibilities of Center and State in\nthis sphere.\n\nTo improve trade in education services, there is a need to study the\nsystem  of  regulation  and  accreditation  of  educational  institutions  in\nforeign  countries  and  accordingly  develop  own  accreditation  system.6\nThere  is  also  a  need  to  improve  on  educational  database  regarding\n\n6  To  compete  successfully  with  the  existing  educational  testing  services  of\nrepute such as GRE, GMAT and TOFEL, our testing services of repute such as\nCAT, GATE, JEE, and others must upgrade and modernize.\n\nCritical Issues in India\u2019s Services-led Growth 7\n\n\fnumber  of  educational  institutions,  their  enrolments  (domestic  and\nforeign), faculty strength, financial sources, and quality and accreditation.\nFurther, there are services that are less than moderately liberalized\nor are restricted with high external trade barriers and low growth, e.g.\nprofessional services like legal and accountancy and rail transport. These\nservices also have a low share in exports, which reflects both domestic\nand external constraints to their trade.\n\nOn the whole, infrastructure services (e.g. transport and construc-\ntion)  are  slow  growing  and  have  a  low  share  in  trade  in  spite  of  the\nefforts to lower external trade barriers to them. In other words, high\ndomestic  constraints  impede  their  growth  and  trade.  In  contrast,  the\nfinancial infrastructure of India appears to be stronger and services like\nsoftware, banking, insurance, and telecommunications show low external\ntrade  barriers  and  high  growth  rates,  with  high  to  moderate  share  in\ntotal exports. Health and education have experienced high growth rates\nand have a large potential for trade.\n\nIn trade liberalization of services, however, the social costs involved\nalso need to be considered. For the Indian economy, this is particularly\nrelevant, given the employment dimension of the services sector.7 An\nargument  put  forward  against  trade  liberalization  in  services  is  the\ndisplacement of labor towards sectors where an economy has competitive\nadvantage. If these sectors lack large employment potential trade can\nlead to growth in unemployment.\n\nAlso,  some  of  the  services  that  have  traditionally  been  under  the\npublic sector (e.g. railways) have surplus labor. Higher extent of trade\nliberalization in these sectors might result in large displacement of labor.\nSimilar  concerns  also  apply  to  sectors  like  retail  distribution,  which\nemploys  a  large  number  of  unskilled  labor.  Displacement  of  labor  in\nthese sectors might cause considerable social unrest. Hence, trade liberaliz-\nation in these sectors must be undertaken in a phased manner, accom-\npanied by appropriate policies to curb unemployment.\n\nLast but not least, empirical research in services in India is limited.\nReliable, timely, and easily interpretable data are lacking. Trade data on\nservices at a more disaggregated level, consistent with value-added and\nemployment data and comparable across time would go a long way in\npromoting research in this field.\n\n7  The  services  sector  in  1999-2000  accounted  for  almost  68%  of  urban\n\nemployment.\n\n8 Policy Brief No. 2\n\nConstructing an index for services would also help in assessing services.\nSuch an index can be constructed by first identifying suitable measures\nfor  the  output  of  different  services  and  then  attaching  appropriate\nweights  to  different  services.  This  will  not  only  help  in  assessing  the\ngrowth in different services but also help in formulating policies vis-\u00e0-vis\ndisaggregated services.\n\nIn  conclusion,  it  is  of  utmost  importance  to  have  a  coherent  and\nintegrated services policy (analogous to the industrial policy and agricul-\ntural policy). This would lead to systematic reforms in different services.\nServices  that  have  large  potential  for  employment,  e.g.  construction,\ntransport, and professional services should be encouraged to grow faster.\nThe high trade potential of sectors such as health and education should\nbe exploited. Liberalization should, however, be followed in a phased\nmanner,  accompanied  by  social  policies  in  sectors  that  have  surplus\nlabor, e.g. retail and wholesale trade and railways.\n\nFinally, full gains of trade liberalization in services will follow only if\ncertain economy-wide efforts are made to make the general environment\nmore conducive to trade and investments in services. Macroeconomic\npolicies like high tariff rates, large fiscal deficits, and rigid labor laws may\nadversely affect the competitiveness of services. Economy-wide efforts\nto improve the business environment and remove domestic constraints\ncan go a long way to sustain the dynamism of India\u2019s services sector.\n\nReferences\n\nBanga,  Rashmi  and  B.N.
