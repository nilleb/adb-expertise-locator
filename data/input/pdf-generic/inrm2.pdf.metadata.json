Consequently,\nthe contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has been\nmore than 60% per annum since 2000. The share of services in trade\nhas also increased substantially.1 This growth has been accompanied by\nincreasing foreign direct investment (FDI) approvals in the services\nsector.2\nThough these trends are in line with global trends, two features are\ndistinctive to India\u2019s services sector. First, in the period 1950s\u20131990s,\nthe share of agriculture in GDP declined by about 25 percentage points,\nwhile industry and services gained equally. The share of industry has\nstabilized since 1990 and consequently, the entire subsequent decline\nin the share of agriculture in GDP has been picked up by the services\nsector. This trend (rising share of services in GDP and corresponding\ndecline in the share of agriculture and manufacturing sector) is seen in\nthe growth process of high-income countries and not in general in\ndeveloping countries. During the 1990s, the contribution of the services\nsector to the growth of GDP in India was nearly 46%, in contrast to\n54% in middle-income countries, 43% in least developed countries,\nand 34% in China.\nSecondly, employment in services has not been in proportion to\ntheir rising share in GDP and trade in India, unlike in the rest of the\nworld. In 1999-2000, services contributed around 24% of employ-\nment in India, in contrast to 30% in middle-income countries, 70% in\nSingapore, and around 35% in Thailand.\nThese features of India\u2019s services-led growth cast doubts on its\nsustainability in the long run. The main objective of this paper is to\nexamine the reasons of these features and suggest policy directions to\n1 Services trade has grown at the same rate as goods trade over the 1990s,\ni.e. about 6.5%.\n2 FDI approvals in services sector are around 30% of FDI approvals.
