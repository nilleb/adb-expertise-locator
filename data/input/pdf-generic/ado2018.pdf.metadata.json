A strong \nperformance in 2017 reflected a surge in exports, which will likely abate this year and next, and rapidly \nexpanding domestic demand. While the outlook is for steady growth, risks to it are decidedly on the \ndownside: Trade friction could weaken recently deepened trade links, tightening US monetary policy could \ndiminish investment in developing Asia, and rising domestic private debt may hamper growth.\n\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for economic growth, better-paid jobs, and \npoverty reduction. The latest technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence may threaten some jobs, \nhowever, and leave less-skilled workers behind. To maximize gains in productivity while safeguarding social \nwelfare, governments in developing Asia should protect workers but not preserve particular jobs. Meanwhile, \nthey should facilitate the countervailing forces in new technologies that generate new jobs. Dealing with the \ndownsides of new technology requires synchronized effort on skills development, labor regulation, social \nprotection, and income redistribution. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\n \n\nH\no\nw\nT\ne\nc\nh\nn\no\nl\no\ng\ny\nA\nff\ne\nc\nt\ns\nJ\no\nb\ns\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\nS\nI\nA\nN\nD\nE\nV\nE\nL\nO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\nO\nU\nT\nL\nO\nO\nK\n2\n0\n1\n8\n\n \n\n \n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2018\n\nHOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS JOBS\n\nAPRIL 2018\n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\nISBN 978-92-9261-120-0\fASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2018\n\nHOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS JOBS\n\nAPRIL 2018\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f\u2002Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n\n\u00a9 2018 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n\nSome rights reserved.

economic growth outlook for developing Asia remains vibrant. \nAsian\u00a0Development Outlook 2018 foresees continued momentum after growth \naccelerated to 6.1% in 2017. The region is expected to expand by 6.0% in \n2018 and 5.9% in 2019. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly industrialized \neconomies, the prospects for growth are even higher, at 6.5% in 2018 and \n6.4% in 2019. Traction for economic expansion will come from strong \nexternal demand, which is supported by a further pickup in growth this year \nin the major industrial economies, and robust domestic demand. Growth in \nthe People\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China is seen to continue its gradual moderation, \nto 6.6% this year and 6.4% next, as the authorities take actions to address \nfinancial risks, while India recovers from a temporary growth setback \nin\u00a02017, rebounding to 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019.\n\nCertain risks to this outlook require monitoring. The upswing in trade \n\ncould be threatened by rising trade tensions. Although the measures \nimplemented by the United States as of the end of March this year are \nunlikely to have a significant impact, the move away from trade openness \nis worrying. Further measures and countermeasures could dent business \nand consumer confidence. Meanwhile, capital flows to the region could \ndiminish if the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates faster than expected \nto keep fiscal stimulus there from igniting inflation. Within the region, \nthe buildup of private debt in some economies in the past few years needs \nclose\u00a0monitoring. Fortunately, most Asian economies are well positioned to \nmeet these challenges.\n\nThis year\u2019s publication draws attention to opportunities and concerns \n\npresented by new technologies in the workplace. The application of new \ntechnologies will boost productivity, but at the same time it will displace \ncertain types of jobs. Evidence shows, however, that rising demand and \nhigher output will create jobs, outweighing job displacement, especially \nwith the addition of new occupations and industries that will arise to \nmeet the new needs of producers and consumers. This transition will \nrequire a skilled\u00a0workforce and could put the less-skilled at a disadvantage. \nThe\u00a0challenge for governments is to ensure that workers are equipped with \nfoundational skills to enable lifelong learning and have the specialized skills \nrequired for working with new technologies. Governments must act to \nenhance and adapt skills development, labor regulation, social protection, \nand income redistribution. Finally, they must ensure that new technologies \ndevelop in ways that benefit people and protect their rights.\n\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2018 was prepared by staff of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, East Asia Department, Pacific \nDepartment, South Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, and Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional Economic Outlook \nTask Force, which met regularly to coordinate and develop consistent forecasts for \nthe region.\n\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each chapter. \nThe\u00a0subregional coordinators were Kenji Takamiya and Fatima Catacutan for \nCentral\u00a0Asia, Akiko Terada-Hagiwara for East Asia, Masato Nakane for South Asia, \nKwang Jo Jeong and Dulce Zara for Southeast Asia, and Rommel Rabanal and \nCara\u00a0Tinio for the Pacific. \n\nA team of economists in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \n\nDepartment, led by Joseph E.

Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly \nindustrialized economies, growth should reach 6.5% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019.\n\nWith oil prices edging up and robust consumer demand continuing, in\ufb02ation is \npoised to pick up after dipping slightly last year. Consumer prices are projected \nto rise by 2.9% in both 2018 and 2019, or 0.6 percentage points more than \nin\u00a02017.\n\nThough prospects are \ufb01rm, risks are clearly to the downside. Protectionist \nmeasures and retaliation against them could undermine the recent pickup in \ntrade growth. In response to \ufb01scal stimulus, the United States Federal Reserve \nmay need to raise interest rates faster than currently expected, which could \ndiminish capital \ufb02ows to developing Asia.\n\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for better-paid jobs \nand economic growth. While new technologies displace jobs, they also unleash \ncountervailing forces that generate more jobs. As some workers may be left \nbehind, governments in developing Asia should respond to this challenge by \nensuring that workers are protected from the downside of new technologies \nand prepared to harness the new opportunities they provide. This will require \ncoordinated action on skills development, labor regulation, social protection, \nand income redistribution.\n\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fx(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nTurning strength into opportunity\n\nStrong tailwinds but tricky crosscurrents \n\n(cid:31) Asia and the Paci\ufb01c continue to enjoy steady growth. The region picked up \nsteam throughout last year to average 6.1% growth in gross domestic product \n(GDP), a 0.2 percentage point uptick from 2016. Excluding the high-income \nnewly industrialized economies, growth was 6.6%. The strong showing re\ufb02ected \nboth solid export demand and rapidly expanding domestic demand, including \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Momentum is likely to moderate only \nslightly to 6.0% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019, or 6.5% and 6.4% excluding the newly \nindustrialized economies. \n\n \u00bb Growth accelerated across the major industrial economies. Aggregate \ngrowth in the United States, the euro area, and Japan rose to 2.3% from \n1.5% in 2016, while unemployment rates reached their lowest since the \nglobal \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. The pace of growth will continue at \n2.3% in\u00a02018, with US \ufb01scal expansion sustaining growth for the group as a \nwhole, before slowing to 2.0% in 2019. Gradual monetary tightening in the \nUS is expected to keep in\ufb02ation in check. Rising business con\ufb01dence in the \neuro area and Japan will be supported by accommodative monetary and \n\ufb01scal\u00a0policies. \n\n \u00bb PRC growth accelerated on strong demand from home and abroad. \nThe\u00a0service sector grew by 8% on buoyant domestic demand, and net \nexports expanded as trade in intermediate manufactures rebounded. \nAssuming mildly tighter monetary and \ufb01scal policies in the PRC, growth is \nexpected to moderate from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019. \nFurther\u00a0progress on reforms such as strengthening \ufb01nancial sector regulation \nand supervision, and addressing debt issues would lay a foundation for solid \nmacroeconomic stability.\n\n \u00bb India is set to rebound from a dip in growth following reform. Growth in \n\ufb01scal 2017 was estimated at 6.6%, 0.5 percentage points below the previous \nyear. The demonetization of large banknotes in late 2016 had lingering \neffects on small business and private credit, and reform that introduced a \nnational goods and services tax temporarily slowed business activity early \nin \ufb01scal 2017. While industry and agriculture slackened, services grew by a \nsolid 8.3%. Improved business regulation and buoyant tax revenue will bolster \ngrowth to the forecast horizon, as it accelerates to 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% \nin\u00a02019.\n\n \u00bb Growth in Southeast Asia is forecast steady this year and next. Although \n\nan expansion of technology exports in 2017 will moderate somewhat, \nrecovery in global commodity prices should continue to support exporters \nof primary goods. Growth in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand will \naccelerate thanks to strong investment and domestic consumption, while \nViet\u00a0Nam will bene\ufb01t from continued expansion of its industrial base. \nSoutheast Asia is expected to maintain its 2017 growth rate of 5.2% in 2018 \nand 2019. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xi\n\n\u00bb Events temper resource revivals in the Paci\ufb01c and Central Asia. Growth \n\nin the Paci\ufb01c will linger at the 2017 rate of 2.2% in 2018, following earthquake \ndamage that has temporarily disrupted gas production in Papua\u00a0New Guinea, \nbefore accelerating to 3.0% in 2019. Higher crude prices boosted growth \nin Central Asian oil producers in 2017, lifting subregional growth to 4.3%. \nHowever, as a rebound in industry in Kazakhstan moderates, growth in \nCentral\u00a0Asia is forecast to slow to 4.0% in 2018, picking up somewhat to 4.2% \nin 2019.\n\n (cid:31) Strong consumer demand and rising commodity prices will lift in\ufb02ation. \nThe region experienced broadly stable in\ufb02ation at 2.3% in 2017, but higher \nincomes today and oil prices tomorrow will bring increases. With average Brent \ncrude oil prices rising above $60/barrel in 2018 and 2019 from $54 in 2017, \nin\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 2.9% in 2018 and 2019. Despite the \npickup, moderated in\ufb02ation expectations will hold price rises below the 10-year \naverage of 3.7%. Both years will see accelerating price rises in all subregions \nexcept Central Asia, where price-stabilizing policy will seek to tame in\ufb02ation that \nreached double digits in 2016. \n\n (cid:31) Developing Asia\u2019s trade rebound will taper modestly. Exports grew in 2017 \n\nby 4.9% in real terms in the region\u2019s 10 largest economies, and imports by 7.7%. \nIn US dollar terms, exports rose by 9.6%, with growth in the second half hitting \n7.9% in the PRC and 16.5% in the \ufb01ve largest economies in Southeast Asia. \nCommodities and manufactures alike saw export growth, which was particularly \nstrong for trade within Asia of intermediate manufactures for assembly into \nelectrical and electronic goods, machinery, and equipment. Trade growth is \nexpected to slow somewhat in 2018 and 2019. Despite the rebound in exports, \nthe current account surplus of the PRC fell by 0.4 percentage points to equal \n1.4% of GDP in 2017. This helped narrow Asia\u2019s current account surplus with the \nrest of the world to 0.5% of global GDP.\n\n (cid:31) Favorable as the growth outlook is, the risks to it are on the downside. Risks \nto trade are high on the list. Protectionist trade measures implemented by the\u00a0US \nso far in 2018 have not discernibly dented buoyant trade \ufb02ows to and from \ndeveloping Asia. However, further actions and retaliation against them could \nundermine the business and consumer optimism that underlies the regional \noutlook. Another risk is diminishing capital in\ufb02ows if the US Federal Reserve \nneeds to raise interest rates faster than markets expect to keep \ufb01scal expansion \nfrom overheating the economy. The trade revival last year has, however, \nreinforced strong trade links within Asia and built up \ufb01nancial buffers in many \nAsian economies, in particular in recovering commodity exporters. Asia\u00a0should \ntherefore be in a strong position to withstand most shocks.\n\n\fxii(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nPrivate debt and economic growth\n\n(cid:31) Developing Asia continues to accumulate private debt. Since the global \n\n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, the ratio of private debt to GDP has declined in \nthe US and other advanced economies as companies and households strove to \ndeleverage. In contrast, ratios of household and non\ufb01nancial corporate debt to \nGDP have continued to rise in emerging markets, including those in Asia. In the \nPRC, for example, the corporate debt ratio rose from 96% of GDP at the end \nof 2008 to 163% at the end of the third quarter of 2017. In the same period, \nthe household debt ratio rose from 50% to 67% in Malaysia, 74% to 94% in the \nRepublic of Korea, and 45% to 68% in Thailand.\n\n (cid:31) Does the private debt buildup pose a risk to regional growth? Private \n\ndebt accumulation spurs growth only in the short run. Evidence shows that \nthe positive effect of household debt growth in emerging economies typically \ndissipates after 2 years, turning negative in the medium term. The pattern is \nbroadly parallel in advanced economies. Similarly, corporate debt growth does \nnot seem to have any persistent positive effect on output growth. Further, as the \namount of private debt rises, the impact of additional debt on output growth \nbecomes smaller. \n\n (cid:31) The results argue for closely monitoring the buildup of private debt. The \nregion would bene\ufb01t as well from macroprudential measures that help prevent \nexcessive credit buildup. The accumulation of both household and corporate \ndebt may pose a medium-term threat to the currently benign economic outlook \nfor the region. However, the lack of a persistent positive effect on output \nsuggests that not all of the added private debt is channeled into productive \ninvestments and activities. Strengthening regional \ufb01nancial systems would \nimprove the quality of private debt. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n(cid:31) Most of developing Asia will pause after a pickup in 2017. As only 14 of 45 \nindividual economies are forecast to see growth accelerate in 2018, aggregate \ngrowth rates in most subregions are projected to be unchanged or lower this \nyear. South Asia is the exception, as a rebound in India will lift growth above 7%, \nmaking it the fastest-growing subregion in developing Asia. Across the region, \ndomestic demand will remain as the key sustainer of growth. Central Asia and \nthe Paci\ufb01c will bounce back in 2019.\n\n (cid:31) East Asia slows on moderating PRC growth and external trade. Economic \n\ngrowth in East Asia picked up by 0.3 percentage points to 6.3% in 2017 as strong \nexternal and internal demand lifted every economy in the subregion. Growth \naccelerated to 6.9% in the PRC on robust exports and private consumption, \nand surging coal exports and mining investment lifted Mongolia\u2019s growth rate \nfourfold to 5.1%. Expansion in the PRC should moderate to 6.6% in 2018 and \n6.4% in 2019 as economic policy leans further toward \ufb01nancial stability and a \nmore sustainable growth trajectory. Other economies in the subregion will see \nlower growth as well, mainly on account of moderating export growth. These \ndevelopments will tamp down East Asian economic expansion to 6.0% in 2018 \nand 5.8% in 2019. In\ufb02ation dipped in East Asia last year, re\ufb02ecting moderation \nin the PRC, where food prices fell. It will trend higher from 1.6% in 2017 to 2.3% \nin 2018 and 2.2% in 2019 as food prices rise, the PRC deregulates prices, and \nwages improve in most economies.\n\n (cid:31) South Asia anticipates revived growth after a 2-year slowdown. Aggregate \ngrowth slipped 0.3 percentage points to 6.4% in 2017. This re\ufb02ected slackening \nin India, where growth fell to 6.6% with the lingering effects of demonetization \nin 2016, businesses adjusting in 2017 to a new goods and services tax, and \nagriculture subdued. The South Asian giant is expected to bounce back to \n7.3% in \ufb01scal 2018 and \ufb01rm to 7.6% in 2019 as the new tax regime improves \nproductivity and as banking reform and corporate deleveraging take hold to \nreverse a downtrend in investment. Elsewhere in South Asia, growth will stay \nrobust but generally not improve. The need to carry out revenue-enhancing \n\ufb01scal reform and to strengthen economic policy will temporarily brake expansion \nin Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Growth in South Asia as a whole is \nforecast to rise to 7.0% in 2018 and 7.2% in 2019. Very modest food price rises \nin India following bumper harvests there pushed average in\ufb02ation in South Asia \ndown to 4.0% in 2017. In\ufb02ation is forecast to revive to 4.7% in 2018 and to 5.1% \nin 2019, mainly on higher oil prices. \n\n (cid:31) Southeast Asia is poised to sustain a higher growth path. Growth accelerated \nto 5.2% last year, 0.5 percentage points higher than in 2016. A turnaround in \nexports and robust domestic demand underpinned solid economic performances \nacross the subregion. As export growth moderates from last year\u2019s rebound, \nstronger domestic demand\u2014fueled by ambitious public infrastructure spending, \nsolid foreign direct investment, and robust household consumption\u2014should \nsee the subregion sustain average annual growth at 5.2% this year and next. \nGrowth this year in 8 of the 10 economies is projected to be equal or exceed \nthe 2017 rate, but Malaysia and Singapore are likely to unwind from last year\u2019s \nrapid expansion toward their long-term potential growth rates. In\ufb02ation, having \n\n\fxiv(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nedged up 0.7 percentage points to 2.8% in 2017, is seen stabilizing at about 3.0% \nthis year and next, buoyed by strong domestic demand, higher minimum wages, \nhikes in administered prices, and rising international oil prices. Only Malaysia \nwill see in\ufb02ation cool in both 2018 and 2019 after changes to the price-setting \nmechanism for fuel and lubricants spiked transport costs in 2017.\n\n (cid:31) Central Asia moderates after a notable recovery in 2017. Average growth \nin the subregion rose to 4.3% from 2.7% a year earlier as recession ended in \nAzerbaijan and expansion accelerated in six other economies, particularly in \npredominant Kazakhstan. Growth slowed only in Uzbekistan, where sharp \ncurrency devaluation to unify the exchange rate and other economic reform \nforfeited some expansion last year for future growth. Following a strong pickup \nin growth last year, Kazakhstan is projected to slow to 3.2% in 2018 but bounce \nback to 3.5% in 2019 as investment quickens. With expansion moderating in \nmost of its economies, Central Asia is projected to slow to 4.0% in 2018 and \nreaccelerate to 4.2% in 2019 with faster growth in all eight countries. A more \nstable exchange rate almost halved in\ufb02ation in Kazakhstan, trimming average \nin\ufb02ation in the subregion to 9.2% in 2017 from 10.6% in 2016, even though \nin\ufb02ation accelerated in the other seven economies, particularly in Uzbekistan. \nAs\u00a0recent currency devaluations slip further into the past, in\ufb02ation is projected \nto settle at 8.5% in 2018 and 7.9% in 2019. \n\n (cid:31) The Paci\ufb01c will grow more slowly than the other subregions. Growth at \n2.2% in 2017 was determined largely by events in Papua New Guinea, the \nlargest Paci\ufb01c economy, where growth at a similar rate re\ufb02ected a slowdown in \nagriculture and contraction in oil and gas. Elsewhere, performance was mixed, \nwith Palau and Timor-Leste contracting. While these two economies will bounce \nback in 2018, all others will either maintain the pace or slow. Following an \nearthquake in February, growth in Papua New Guinea is expected to falter to \n1.8%, but recovery in Timor-Leste is expected to keep growth in the subregion as \na whole unchanged at 2.2% in 2018. An expected recovery in Papua New Guinea \nand continuing strength in Timor-Leste should contribute to aggregate growth of \n3.0% in 2019. Although in\ufb02ation in the Paci\ufb01c fell 1.0 percentage point to 3.8% \nin 2017, prices rose faster in eight economies, half of them escaping de\ufb02ation in \nthe previous year. As higher global commodity prices will boost in\ufb02ation in most \neconomies in 2018, subregional in\ufb02ation is forecast to reach 4.1% in 2018 before \ntapering to 3.9% in 2019.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xv\n\nHow technology affects jobs\n\nSummary\n\n\uf076  New technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for better-paid \n\njobs and economic growth.\n\n\uf076  Despite growing concern that new technologies could cause widespread job \nloss, optimism about developing Asia\u2019s job prospects springs from several \nobservations:\n\n\uf074  New technologies often automate only some tasks of a job, not the \nwhole\u00a0job. ATMs, for example, have not replaced bank tellers but \nbroadened their role in customer relationship management.\n\n\uf074  Job automation goes ahead only where it is both technically and \n\neconomically feasible. Both requirements tend to be met in capital-\nintensive manufacturing, where employment shares were already low \nin\u00a02015.\n\n\uf074  Rising demand offsets job displacement driven by automation.  \n\nIn 2005\u20132015, jobs created by rising domestic demand more than \ncompensated for job losses to technological advances.\n\n\uf074  Technological change and economic growth create new occupations \nand industries. Many new job titles have arisen in ICT, and new types \nof jobs will arise in health care and education and in \ufb01nance, insurance, \nreal\u00a0estate, and other business services.\n\n\uf076  Nevertheless, new technologies alter the skills required of the workforce and \nmay cause unemployment as some \ufb01rms downsize or close. They make the \nless-skilled more likely to experience lower wage growth, exacerbating income \ninequality.\n\n\uf076  Governments should respond to these challenges by ensuring that workers \n\nare protected from the downside of new technologies and able to harness the \nnew opportunities they provide. This will require coordinated action on skills \ndevelopment, labor regulation, social protection, and income redistribution.\n\n\uf076  Governments should use new technologies to improve education and skills \ndevelopment, as well as to deliver such public services as social protection \nprograms. Government support for new technologies must bene\ufb01t people \nand protect their rights and privacy. \n\nRising concern over technology displacing jobs\n\n(cid:31) Developing Asia has done remarkably well in creating jobs for its workers. \nOver the past 25 years, the region has created 30 million jobs annually in \nindustry and services. Job creation has come with improved productivity, rising \nearnings for workers, and large reductions in poverty. Contributing to this process \nare shifts in employment from sectors with low productivity and pay, typically \nsubsistence agriculture, to sectors with higher productivity and pay, typically \nin modern industry and services. But a larger part of productivity gains come \nfrom technological advances within sectors, such as high-yielding crop varieties \nin agriculture, modern machine tools in manufacturing, and information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) in services. The creation and adoption of new \n\n\fxvi(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\ntechnologies is driven not only by investments in education, infrastructure, and \nresearch and development, but also by international trade and foreign direct \ninvestment. At the same time, macroeconomic stability and an investment \nclimate conducive to business have provided a foundation for technological \nadvance, sustained growth, and job creation.\n\n (cid:31) Technological advances fuel productivity but also threaten jobs. Emerging \ntechnologies such as robotics, three-dimensional printing, arti\ufb01cial intelligence, \nand the internet of things will help drive future prosperity. Yet they also pose \nchallenges for workers. The apparel and footwear industries, for example, are \nexperimenting with completely automated production. Similarly, it is becoming \ntechnically feasible to automate more complex service tasks such as customer \nsupport. These developments have raised concern that automation could \ncause widespread job loss, slow wage growth, and worsen income inequality in \ndeveloped and developing economies alike. Some studies indicate that over half \nof the jobs in some economies in developing Asia are at risk.\n\nReasons for optimism on job prospects\n\n(cid:31) New technologies often automate only some tasks of a job, not the whole \njob. Any job consists of a number of tasks, and the tasks can be classi\ufb01ed as \neither routine or not, and either manual or cognitive. Automation targets mainly \nroutine tasks, such as soldering components onto a circuit board repeatedly on \nan assembly line, which is both routine and manual, or counting and dispensing \ncash in a bank, which is routine and cognitive. While task automation may \ndisplace some types of jobs, in other cases it restructures the job such that \nmachines handle only the routine tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more \ncomplex tasks. The introduction of ATMs, for example, changes the job for bank \ntellers to one of customer relationship management.\n\n (cid:31) Job automation goes ahead only where both technically and economically \nfeasible. Data on industrial robots in Asia show the two largest users to be \nelectrical and electronics industries and automobile manufacturers, each \naccounting in 2015 for 39% of the total robot use but, together, only 13.4% \nof total manufacturing employment. By contrast, producers of textiles, \napparel, and leather goods and of food and beverages together accounted \nin the same year for only 1.4% of robot usage but 31.4% of manufacturing \nemployment. This\u00a0pattern re\ufb02ects both technological and economic feasibility. \nMore\u00a0technological sophistication is required to give a robot the dexterity to \nstitch cloth, for example, than to handle large metal parts. At the same time, \nlow\u00a0pay in apparel and footwear is a disincentive to automation. In 12 economies \nin developing Asia that account for 90% of employment in the region, an \nestimated 40% of manufacturing and service jobs entail mostly routine tasks, \neither manual or cognitive. However, many of these jobs are unlikely to be lost. \nSome will be restructured instead, and automating others will not be technically \nor economically feasible.\n\n (cid:31) Rising demand offsets job displacement driven by automation. New \n\ntechnologies allow a given output to be produced by fewer workers. While \nsome workers are displaced, improved productivity and lower prices often \nspur higher demand. Increased demand may even expand the number of jobs \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xvii\n\nin factories that automate part of their production process. Moreover, the \nproductivity bene\ufb01ts of new technology in one industry lower production costs in \ndownstream industries through input\u2013output channels, contributing to increased \ndemand and employment across industries. An increase in demand and \nproduction in one industry heightens demand for upstream industries as well.\n\n \u00bb Data show rising demand more than compensating for jobs displaced by \ntechnology. Using productivity as a broad measure of technological advance, \ninput\u2013output analysis of 12 economies in developing Asia was conducted for \n2005\u20132015, when modern machine tools and ICT equipment spread into \nfactories and offices in a big way. If output had remained the same, higher \nproductivity would have brought a 66% decrease in employment, equal to \n101 million jobs per annum. However, concurrently higher demand for goods \nand services more than offsets this with an associated 88% increase in \nemployment, equal to 134 million jobs per annum.\n\n \u00bb Production returning to advanced economies may not threaten \n\nemployment in Asia. Even if automation in advanced economies attracts \nsome factories back to the home market, this is unlikely to happen on a large \nscale for lack of economic feasibility. In addition, in the 12 Asian economies \nstudied, employment in 2015 that depended directly and indirectly on \ufb01nal \ndemand in advanced economies was only 10%. Developing Asia is growing \nfast and relying less on exports and more on consumption-driven growth as a \nrising middle class generates higher demand for goods and services, including \nthose that are traditionally export-oriented. This suggests that so-called \n\u201creshoring\u201d may not be a major threat to employment in the region. \n\n (cid:31) Technological change and economic growth create new occupations and \nindustries. New technologies give rise to new occupations and industries. \nAuto\u00a0repair workers and car salesman emerged alongside the car industry in the \n1900s, and more recently software engineers and app developers accompanied \nthe development of ICT. In addition, the greater complexity of modern \nproduction and growing demand for new personal services in health care, \neducation, \ufb01nance, and others areas are countervailing forces against job loss to \ntechnology as they create new occupations. \n\n \u00bb New types of jobs have emerged to handle new technologies. A detailed \nanalysis of occupation titles in India, Malaysia, and the Philippines found \nthat 43%\u201357% of new job titles that emerged in the past 10 years are in\u00a0ICT. \nA large share of new job titles emerged in one of India\u2019s fastest growing \noccupation categories: craft and related workers. This was driven mainly \nby\u00a0the different types of specialized technicians needed to work with \ncomputer-controlled machines. Such trends will continue.\n\n \u00bb Comparing occupations across regions shows scope for job growth \n\nin many sectors. Health care and education provide 15% of employment \nin the US, for example, while \ufb01nance, insurance, real estate, and other \nbusiness services provide 19%. In lower- and middle-income economies in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia analyzed, health care and education provide only 3.5%\u20136.0% \nof jobs, and business services 1.5%\u20136.0%, suggesting considerable scope for \njob growth in these services.\n\n\fxviii(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nSome worker concerns remain\n\n(cid:31) Even as new technology creates jobs, automation will hurt workers in \n\nroutine and manuals jobs. New jobs will appear, but they may require skills that \nsuch workers do not possess. Further, as \ufb01rms and industries adjust to new ways \nof producing and distributing goods and services, the resulting disruptions along \nexisting supply chains may cause unemployment. In addition to more job losses, \nroutine and manual workers will likely experience lower wage growth, worsening \nincome inequality. \n\n \u00bb Demand will grow most for nonroutine cognitive, social, and ICT tasks. \nJobs requiring routine and manual tasks will be less in demand. This is \nsuggested by analysis of \ufb01ve economies in developing Asia showing that, \nover the past decade, annual expansion of employment in jobs intensive \nin nonroutine cognitive tasks, social interactions, and the use of ICT was \n2.6\u00a0percentage points faster than total employment. Average real wages for \nthese nonroutine jobs increased faster than for routine and manual jobs. \n\n \u00bb Workers with weaker foundational skills could \ufb01nd themselves left \n\nbehind. Foundational skills\u2014those that are best learned as a schoolchild, \nencompassing not only basic reading, writing, numeracy but also digital \nliteracy and teamwork ability\u2014support transition into jobs that require \nhigher intensity of nonroutine and cognitive tasks. Without adequate skills \ndevelopment or retraining, workers with weaker foundational skills face \nhurdles in seizing the opportunities that new technologies provide.\n\n (cid:31) Even some cognitively oriented but routine jobs may be displaced. The \n\nbusiness process outsourcing (BPO) industry is a case in point. Industry experts \nestimate that, in 2016, 47% of BPO workers in the Philippines worked at \nprocess-driven tasks requiring little abstract thinking. With the advent of new \ntechnologies, such jobs are likely to decline as a share of all BPO jobs. There will \nbe new opportunities driven by greater demand for more complex BPO services, \nwhich can expand along with technologies. But they will require more specialized \ntraining. Workers employed as medical transcriptionists, for example, may lose \ntheir jobs to increasingly sophisticated software able to recognize voice, text, and \nimage signals. Transitioning these workers into nonroutine cognitive jobs in the \nBPO industry will require retraining and skills development. \n\nThe role of government in harnessing technology for workers \n\n(cid:31) Governments must pursue education reform and promote lifelong learning. \nSchools need incentives to strengthen foundational skills that enable individuals \nto learn\u2014and to relearn. For imparting the specialized skills needed to work \nwith new technologies, universities and institutions specializing in technical \nand vocational education and training (TVET) are key, and they will have to \ncater not only to the rising number of graduates from secondary education \nbut also to adults seeking to upgrade their skills or retrain. These institutions \nmust be better integrated, as through credit transfer systems that enable TVET \ngraduates to pursue higher education and university students to acquire speci\ufb01c \ntechnical\u00a0skills. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xix\n\n(cid:31) Labor market \ufb02exibility needs to be accompanied by programs that support \nthe unemployed. Labor markets will need to be \ufb02exible to accommodate the \nreallocation of labor across \ufb01rms and industries necessary to realize the bene\ufb01ts \nof new technologies. Some governments need to eliminate excessive regulatory \nbarriers to hiring and \ufb01ring. All governments must pursue active labor market \nprograms that provide job placement services to match unemployed workers \nwith emerging employment opportunities, as well as training and retraining \nprograms that equip workers with skills in high demand. \n\n (cid:31) Social protection systems must be strengthened. Workers need protection \nfrom income losses on account of unemployment. Social protection systems \nare essential as well for workers who may still be employed but in low-paid \ninformal jobs. Systems need to be strengthened in terms of unemployment \nbene\ufb01ts, expanded health insurance, public works programs, and income \ntransfers. Minimum wage laws should complement the role of social protection \nin supporting workers\u2019 welfare and tackling widening inequality.\n\n (cid:31) Tax policies must fund social protection and counter widening income \ninequality. The actions needed, as noted above, on education and skills \ndevelopment, active labor market programs, and social protection will help \naddress worsening inequality. Funding these initiatives will require governments \nto raise more revenue. Broadening the tax base and improving tax administration \nare important, especially because government revenue is a low share of gross \ndomestic product in many Asian countries. Additionally, scope exists to make \nincome taxes more progressive and to expand receipts from taxes on capital gains, \ninheritance, and property, which will raise more revenue and narrow inequality. \n\n (cid:31) New technologies can facilitate skills development, job-matching, and \n\nsocial protection. Machine learning and big data analytics are increasingly able \nto personalize services. Adaptive learning technology, for example, changes \nthe content taught and its sequence in response to student performance. \nThis\u00a0technique has enhanced learning outcomes in schools. New technologies \ncan improve job-matching by assessing and monitoring the evolution of \noccupations and providing users with instant feedback on what skills employers \nseek and how to acquire them, or what job is best for career growth. Finally, \ntechnological advances in biometric identi\ufb01cation can improve how social \nprotection programs function by reducing costs, overcoming implementation \nchallenges in sophisticated unemployment bene\ufb01t systems, and enabling the \ntracking of job-placement services. \n\n (cid:31) Governments must ensure that new technologies develop in ways that \nbene\ufb01t people and protect their rights. Given the central role the internet \nplays in new technologies, developing a nationwide broadband backbone and \nother ICT infrastructure is essential, as is basic infrastructure for electricity \nsupply and transport. Public investments are needed to extend internet access \nto remote and lagging regions. Appropriate regulation of mobile and internet \nproviders is needed to ensure affordable services. Governments need to come \nto grips with the protection of personal data and privacy. Competition policy \nhas to evolve to ensure that large technology \ufb01rms abide by the norms of fair \ncompetition. Appropriate public policy interventions are critical to ensure that \nnew technologies serve economic and social development.\n\n\fxx(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Moreover, \nin\ufb02ation remained moderate despite a 23% increase \nin oil prices during the year.\n\nGoing forward, countries should be able to \nbuild on these economic gains, even as growth \ntapers somewhat (Figure\u00a01.0.2). Domestic demand \nis expected to be the key driver as con\ufb01dence builds \nduring 2018 and 2019. \n\nThe outlook has downside risks. First, while \nthe direct impact of protectionist trade measures \nimplemented by the US in March 2018 is unlikely \nto affect the outlook for developing Asia, further \nmeasures and retaliation would have larger \nrami\ufb01cations. Second, expansion in the US that is \nfaster than expected, fueled by recent tax cuts and \nspending increases, may prompt the US Federal \nReserve to raise interest rates more rapidly than \nmarkets currently anticipate. The trade revival \nlast year has, however, reinforced strong trade \nlinks within Asia and built up \ufb01nancial buffers in \nmany Asian economies, in particular in recovering \ncommodity exporters. Finally, caution is necessary \nwhen private debt grows very quickly, as this is \nfound to correlate with larger subsequent declines \nin\u00a0gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1.0.1\u2002 Global share of income, 2016\n\nRest of the world\n29.9%\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n14.0%\n\nIndia\n2.7%\n\nRest of\ndeveloping\nAsia\n\nCentral Asia, 0.5%\n\nEast Asia excluding the\nPeople\u2019s Republic\nof China, 2.9%\n\nSouth Asia excluding India, 0.8%\n\nSoutheast Asia, 3.3%\n\nJapan\n6.3%\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c, 0.0%\n\nUnited States\n23.2%\n\nEuro area\n16.4%\n\nNote: Weights are based on gross national income in current US dollars, \nAtlas\u00a0method. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from World Development Indicators online \ndatabase (accessed 30 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.0.2\u2002 GDP growth outlook for developing Asia  \n\nand the industrial economies\n\nDeveloping Asia\nDeveloping Asia excluding NIEs\nMajor industrial economies\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nForecast\n\nNotes: The major industrial economies are the euro area, Japan, and \nthe\u00a0United\u00a0States.

Regional economies \nare projected to expand by 6.0% on average in 2018 \nand 5.9% in 2019 (Figure 1.1.1). Exports, which \nboosted growth last year, will still be a key driver of \ngrowth, albeit at a slightly moderated pace. Exports \nhave been supported by growth in the advanced \neconomies, which is expected to continue to the \nforecast horizon (Box 1.1.1). \n\nWith exports set to weaken, domestic demand \nin the region will likely take up the slack, even as \nsome economies return to trend after exceptional \ngrowth in 2017. Much of the decline re\ufb02ects \nmoderating expansion in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), however, that will more than offset \nfaster growth elsewhere, notably in India and the \nlarger economies of Southeast Asia. In\ufb02ation in \ndeveloping Asia is forecast to rise from 2.3% in \n2017 to 2.9% in 2018 and 2019, mainly on strong \nconsumer demand and rising global commodity \nprices (Figure 1.1.2), but remain well below its \n10-year average of 3.7%. The region\u2019s current \naccount surplus will narrow from 1.8% in 2017 \nto 1.4% in 2018 and further to 1.3% in 2019 as the \nsurge in global exports fades somewhat.\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2015\n\n0\n\nStellar growth in 2017\nDeveloping Asia enjoyed a stellar performance \nin 2017, as most of the region\u2019s large economies \ncomfortably exceeded growth expectations. \nRegional growth expanded by 6.1%, the highest \nin 3 years, mirroring a surprise pickup in the \nPRC and economic dynamism elsewhere in the region. \nGrowth\u00a0accelerated in more than 70% of the region\u2019s economies \nthanks to solid export demand from the industrial economies \nand from within the region, as well as strong domestic \nconsumption.

Private consumption led \nthe way, accelerating throughout 2017 to a seasonally \nadjusted annualized rate of 4.0% in the fourth quarter \n(Q4). Acceleration was reflected as well in higher \nimport demand, which grew significantly faster than \nexports in Q4, such\u00a0that net exports subtracted from \ngrowth. The domestic rally came as a strong labor \nmarket supported faster wage growth. The\u00a0contribution \nof investment remained small until Q4 2017, when \nnonresidential investment rose, mainly on double-digit \ngrowth in equipment. In sum, trends underlying private \nconsumption suggest that it will remain strong, as \nconfirmed by preliminary data for Q1 2018. \n\nUpbeat industrial production and purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 indexes in early 2018 may argue for further \nexpansion in domestic investment, as do tax incentives \nunder the Tax\u00a0and Jobs Act, 2017\u2014provided that \nthey are not undercut by recent protectionist moves. \nThe\u00a0unemployment rate remained in early 2018 at \na 17-year low of 4.1%. With\u00a0these\u00a0developments, the \nUS economy is expected to grow by 2.7% in 2018 \nand moderate somewhat to 2.3% in 2019, though \nprotectionist moves could slow expansion. \n\nUS headline inflation has hovered around 2.0%, \n\nwhile core inflation has remained softer at 1.8%. \nAlong\u00a0with the steady decline in the unemployment \nrate, the upward trend in inflation from greater fiscal \nstimulus and additional purchasing power will likely \nprompt the Federal Reserve to advance its gradual \nnormalization of monetary policy. The\u00a0assumption \nin this analysis is that the Fed will gradually raise \nits benchmark rate as many as 5 times in the next 16 \nmonths to reach 2.9% by\u00a0late\u00a02019. \n\nThe euro area recorded growth in 2017 at 2.5%, \nits\u00a0best rate since before the global financial crisis \nof 2008\u20132009. Domestic demand expanded robustly, \nbuoyed by high market confidence and supportive \nmonetary and fiscal policies. Spurred by strong job \ncreation and optimistic businesses, the unemployment \nrate fell to 8.7% in December. \n\nThe euro area shows early indications that it \n\nentered 2018 on a high note, with political uncertainty \nappearing to recede. Growth is forecast to remain strong \nin 2018 but moderate slightly to 1.9% in 2019. Last year\u2019s \ntailwinds are likely to continue into 2018 and offset \nweakening fiscal incentives in several economies as \nexternal demand continues to grow. By 2019, however, \nexternal factors that have supported growth in the \nrecent past will fade somewhat. Investment spending \nwill benefit substantially from faster disbursement \nof funds under the European Union\u2019s 2014\u20132020 \nprogramming period. However, developments \nsurrounding the scheduled exit in March\u00a02019 of the \nUnited Kingdom may delay large investment decisions. \nNegotiations on Brexit bore fruit in late March 2018 and \nwill now move to discussing future\u00a0ties.\n\nFull-year inflation in the euro area was 1.5% in \n\n2017, below the 2.0% target set by the European \nCentral Bank. Since January, the central bank has \nbeen moderating its monthly asset purchases under \nits quantitative easing program. With wage pressures \ncontained and some slack in the labor market, inflation \nwill still likely remain below the central bank target in \n2018 and 2019.\n\nJapan continued to recover to the end of 2017, \n\nsupported by strong global demand and accommodative \nmonetary\u00a0policy. GDP grew by 1.7% in 2017, up from \n0.9% in 2016, and marked 8 consecutive quarters \nof growth. Stronger economic activity has reduced \nunemployment and created more jobs, which should \nspur consumer spending, but wage growth remains \nsluggish. \n\nEarly indications for Q1 2018 suggest a soft start for \nthe year, but business sentiment remains very positive \nand consumer confidence elevated. Moreover, prospects \nfor higher demand look good as the unemployment \nrate fell in January to 2.4%, its lowest in 25 years. \nThe\u00a0forecast is for growth at 1.4% in 2018 and 1.0% \nin\u00a02019. The government is slated to increase sales \ntaxes in October 2019, which may dampen household \nspending. Risks to the forecast are a possible slowdown \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China and uncertainty in \nglobal trade policies. \n\nConsumer price inflation approached a 3-year high \n\nof 1.5% year on year in February. The Bank of Japan \nhas kept its inflation target at 2% and maintained its \naccommodative monetary policy, with the short-term \npolicy rate at \u20130.1% and the yield on 10-year Japanese \ngovernment bonds capped at about zero.\n\n\f6\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nKey growth drivers\nOn the demand side, much of the impetus \nfor growth in developing Asia came from an \nunexpectedly large rise in external demand. \nExports accelerated across the region as global \ndemand picked up. However, import demand rose \neven faster, to support the renewal of domestic \ndemand that ensued, such that the contribution to \nGDP growth from real net exports declined in 2017 \nfrom 2016. In 8 of the 11 large regional economies \nwith 2017 data, net exports subtracted from \nGDP growth (Figure\u00a01.1.3). Private consumption \nremained the dominant source of growth in over \nhalf of the 11 large economies.\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\nConsumer con\ufb01dence recovered last year \nin eight of the nine large economies examined, \nafter declining during most of 2016 (Figure 1.1.4). \nCon\ufb01dence improved the most in Hong\u00a0Kong, China; \nthe PRC; and the Philippines but fell in India, where \ndemonetization and the implementation of a goods \nand services tax temporarily battered consumer \ncon\ufb01dence. In the PRC, the consumer sentiment \nindex reached its highest in more than 2 decades \nas optimism picked up over job prospects and \npersonal \ufb01nances, particularly in lower-tier cities, \nwith help from supportive government policy, infrastructure \ninvestment, and more affordable housing. In Hong Kong, \nChina, optimism rose on the economic outlook, job prospects, \nand spending plans as a rebound in tourist arrivals buoyed \nconsumer con\ufb01dence. Optimism rose in the Philippines on \nthe same issues, along with improved expectations for peace \nand security. In\u00a0Indonesia, consumers remained upbeat about \ngovernment reform programs and expectations of job growth \n\n1.1.4\u2002 Consumer confidence and expectations, selected economies\n\n1.1.3\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, \n\nselected\u00a0economies\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investment\nTotal consumption\nNet exports\nGDP growth\n\nPercentage points\n\nNIEs\n\nASEAN-5\n\n6 7\nPRC\n\n6 7\nIND\n\n6 7\nHKG\n\n6 7\nROK\n\n6 7\nSIN\n\n6 7\nTAP\n\n6 7\nINO\n\n6 7\nMAL\n\n6 7\nPHI\n\n6 7\nTHA\n\n6 7\nVIE\n\n6 = 2016, 7 = 2017, ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nHKG\u00a0=\u00a0Hong Kong, China, IND = India, INO = Indonesia, MAL = Malaysia, \nNIE\u00a0=\u00a0newly industrialized economy, PHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof China, ROK = Republic of Korea, SIN = Singapore, TAP = Taipei,China, \nTHA\u00a0= Thailand, VIE = Viet Nam. \nNote: Data for India are \ufb01scal years ending on 31\u00a0March of the next year.\nSources: Haver Analytics; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 20 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nHong Kong, China\nIndia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n% change year on year\n\nEast Asia and India\n\n% change year on year\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nPercentage points\n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nNotes: Data for the Philippines give the percentage of households that were optimistic less the percentage that were pessimistic.

Consumer con\ufb01dence rose to a near 7-year \nhigh in the Republic of Korea (ROK) as improvements to the \neconomic outlook, higher global demand for electronics, and an \neasing of geopolitical tensions brought optimism about incomes \nand equity prices. Higher equity prices and the government\u2019s \ndecision to raise public sector wages by 3% in January 2017 and \nrelax work hours boosted optimism in Taipei,China. \n\nRetailers in the region saw growth improve in 2017 as \nrising incomes and wealth factored into highly optimistic \ndomestic markets (Figure\u00a01.1.5). Retail sales in Hong Kong, \nChina experienced their best growth since February 2015, \nre\ufb02ecting strong consumer demand and higher spending by \ntourists, particularly from the PRC. Retail sales remained \nstrong in the PRC too as higher incomes helped boost spending \non clothing and durables. Taipei,China ended the year on a \nstrong note despite reduced department store clothing sales \nearly in 2017 because of a warm winter. In Southeast Asia, \nMalaysia and Viet\u00a0Nam registered the largest gains in retail \nspending, thanks to rising incomes and higher employment. \nContinued expansion in online shopping supported retail \nsales growth, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand. \nGrowth\u00a0in retail spending was slower in Singapore, as sales of \nrecreational goods, clothing, furniture, and other consumer \ngoods moderated, and in Indonesia, as the return to normal \nconsumption patterns after the end of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr \ncelebrations weakened sales in mid-2017. \n\nTrends in industrial production supported robust economic \n\nexpansion in export-oriented economies (Figure\u00a01.1.6). \nIn\u00a0East Asia, growth in industrial output surged by 3.0% \nin Taipei,China and by 6.5% in the PRC as a wide array of \nmanufacturing industries including electronics and electrical \n\n\f8\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n1.1.6\u2002Industrial production indexes, selected economies\n\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\nHong Kong, China\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nIndia\n\n% change year on year,\n3-month moving average\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nThailand\nViet Nam\nSingapore\n\n% change year on year, \n3-month moving average\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\nEast Asia and India\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n   Jan\n    2015\n\n Jul\n\n Jan\n   2016\n\n  Jul\n\n  Jan\n   2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n   2018\n\n   Jan\n   2015\n\n  Jul\n\nJan\n    2016\n\n   Jul\n\n  Jan\n   2017\n\n  Jul\n\nJan\n    2018\n\nNote: Data for Hong Kong, China are quarterly percentage change year on year.\nSources: Haver Analytics; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 30 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nmachinery bene\ufb01tted from a global upswing in high-tech \ntrade.

In Southeast Asia, industrial production \nalso accelerated except in the Philippines, where it fell by \n0.8% following unusually rapid expansion in 2016. Singapore \nrecorded the fastest pickup, at 10.4%, aided by strong demand \nfor semiconductor exports. Viet Nam followed closely with \n10.0% growth as rapid expansion in mining added to strong \ngains in manufacturing, particularly in the latter part of \nthe\u00a0year. Malaysia\u00a0continued to post solid gains thanks \nto strong performance in key manufacturing sectors, and \npetrochemicals and metals led growth in Indonesia.\n\nLast year saw business conditions improve as well on \nsolid expansion of production and new orders, following an \nanemic performance in\u00a02016. In seven of the nine economies \nin developing Asia surveyed by Markit, purchasing managers\u2019 \nindexes had slowly returned to above 50 by the end of the \nthird quarter of 2017 and stayed close to this level to the end \nof the\u00a0year, showing that growth momentum held up well \n(Table\u00a01.1.1).

The PRC grew \nby 6.9% on robust domestic consumption and \nsurprisingly strong external demand, which facilitated \nfurther economic rebalancing toward consumption and \nservices. Growth quadrupled to 5.1% in Mongolia, while \nit doubled in Taipei,China, as buoyant investment added \nto demand, propelled by higher construction and strong \nconsumption fueled by higher incomes and upbeat economic \nsentiment. Growth accelerated as well in the ROK, expanding \nby 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in 2016 as the election of a new \ngovernment in May 2017 helped boost domestic demand, \nand as external\u00a0demand \ufb02ourished on the global pickup in \nsemiconductor exports and warming relations with the PRC, \na\u00a0top trade partner. \n\n\f10\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nGrowth in South Asia eased to 6.4% in 2017 from 6.7% in \n2016 even as six of the eight economies posted higher growth. \nThe deceleration came largely from India, where growth slowed \nto 6.6% in 2017 from 7.1% in 2016 with the lingering impact of \ndemonetization of high-denomination banknotes in November \n2016 and teething problems attending the implementation of \na new goods and services tax. Growth also fell in Sri Lanka \nas agriculture and government spending shrank. Meanwhile, \ngrowth accelerated markedly in Nepal to 6.9% as trade \ufb02ows \nand electricity supply normalized after devastating earthquakes \nin 2015 caused stagnation in 2016, and as a favorable monsoon \nenabled better harvests. The return of normal monsoon rains \nsupported steady and broad growth in other South Asian \neconomies as well. \n\nGrowth in Southeast Asia improved to 5.2% in 2017 from \n4.7% in 2016 as the subregion bene\ufb01tted from higher demand \nfor tech products, recovery in global fuel prices, and procyclical \n\ufb01scal policies. Brunei Darussalam enjoyed the highest growth \nacceleration, largely from oil prices, followed by Malaysia, \nSingapore, and Thailand, partly because of their extensive \nparticipation in electronics supply chains. Malaysia rebounded \nstrongly, with growth rising 1.7 percentage points to 5.9% in 2017. \nGains in electronics and precision engineering also helped raise \nSingapore\u2019s growth rate to 3.6% in 2017 from 2.4% in 2016, with \ntech exports offsetting a decline in \ufb01xed investment. In\u00a0Thailand, \ngrowth improved to 3.9%, its highest rate in 5 years, as stronger \nconsumption aided by higher rural incomes and increased tourist \narrivals added to a robust pickup in exports of commodities and \nmanufactures. Growth in Viet Nam was broad-based, continuing \nto bene\ufb01t from an expanding industrial base and policies to \nboost domestic demand. Huge\u00a0drawdowns in inventory limited \nIndonesia\u2019s growth improvement to only 0.1\u00a0percentage points. \nMeanwhile, growth in the Philippines slowed to 6.7% from 6.9% \nin 2016, the unusually large expansion that year attributed to \nelection spending. \n\nIn Central Asia, growth strengthened to 4.3% in 2017 from \n\n2.7% in\u00a02016 as seven economies\u2014all but Uzbekistan\u2014posted \nhigher growth. Contributors to the growth rebound were higher \nglobal oil prices, stronger demand both at home and abroad, and \na return of growth in the Russian Federation, a key trade partner \nand source of remittances for the subregion. A recession ended \nin Azerbaijan thanks to higher oil prices and gains in services \nand agriculture, which helped offset a decline in industry \ncaused by currency devaluation that started in\u00a02016. Growth \nimproved the most in Armenia, by sevenfold over 2016, as higher \nlending and remittances propelled growth in consumption and \ninvestment.

Growth slowed in Uzbekistan as \na huge devaluation of the local currency in September slowed \nexpansion in industry and private consumption.\n\nIn the Paci\ufb01c, aggregate expansion eased slightly in 2017 to \n2.2% from 2.4% in 2016, though growth recovered in the larger \nisland economies. Improved metal and gas prices helped boost \nmining in Papua New Guinea, the subregion\u2019s largest economy, \nbut overall growth remained below the 10-year average of 5.4% \nas poor access to foreign currency weakened consumption. \nGrowth picked up in Fiji with a recovery in agriculture and \nincreasing tourist arrivals, but GDP contracted in Timor-Leste \non lower public spending and depressed private investment.\n\nIndia and the PRC trading places\nIndia and the PRC provide a story of contrasts \ndespite signi\ufb01cant efforts by both governments \nto deepen reform (Figures 1.1.8). Together they \ncontributed 50% of global growth in 2017. As the \neconomic giants of developing Asia, providing \nabout 70% of aggregate GDP, their impact on \nthe region is monumental. In Asian Development \nOutlook 2017, India was projected to be the fastest \ngrowing economy in Asia, at 7.4%, while the PRC \nwas expected to grow by 6.5% or less, in line with a \nplanned long-term moderation in growth. Instead, \nexpectedly high oil prices drove down India\u2019s real \nnet exports, and bumps from \ufb01nancial and \ufb01scal \nmeasures cooled business activity and slowed \ngrowth, probably to 6.6% in 2017. In contrast, \nunexpectedly strong external demand from the \nindustrial economies propelled the PRC.\n\nConsumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nGDP growth\n\nPercentage points \n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\nBoth economies have seen services become important \n\ncontributors to growth. In the PRC, the service sector \nremained the main driver of growth in 2017 from the supply \nside, accelerating to 8.0% from 7.7% in 2016 and contributing \n4.0 percentage points to growth. Nonetheless, services \ncomprise just over 51% of GDP in the PRC, which is low by \ninternational standards. In India, services also grew by a \nhealthy 8.3%, notably passenger and cargo transport services. \nServices, particularly business service exports, remain a \nmainstay of the Indian economy.\n\nRecent developments in the two economies have differed \nin three ways. First are different trends in rural\u2013urban income \ndisparities. The\u00a0PRC has had some success in recent years \nin closing the rural\u2013urban income gap as rural households \nsaw real income increase faster than did urban residents \nin\u00a02017, for a ninth straight year\u2014though urban households \nstill earned 2.7\u00a0times more than their rural counterparts. \n\n\f12\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nIn India, rural wage growth slowed in 2017 as procurement \nprices in agriculture rose only sluggishly and as the effects of \ndemonetization lingered, especially affecting cash-dependent \nremote areas. With slowing rural wage growth, private \nconsumption growth in India slowed to 6.1% in 2017, the lowest \nrate in 5 years. \n\nThe second difference is how the trade balance affected \ngrowth. While both economies experienced signi\ufb01cant trade \ngrowth, only the PRC saw net exports increase\u2014and more than \nexpected. With price increases of nearly 23% for oil and 21% \nfor metals in 2017, incomes rose in neighboring commodity-\nproducing countries, raising their demand for PRC exports by \nmore than expected, particularly in the second half of 2017. \nBy contrast, net exports subtracted from growth in India, \nparticularly in the second half of the year. Oil imports rose by \n24% as international prices increased, but real demand was \nalso higher, particularly from \ufb01rms. In addition, demand for \nimports of gold and precious stones grew by 51.3%.\n\nThe third difference is the ratio of investment to GDP, \n\nwhich is higher than desired in the PRC and considered \ntoo low in India. In the PRC, investment still provides \nalmost 40% of GDP, which is very high by international \nstandards. Various\u00a0reforms have been applied to reduce that \nshare in recent years because the government realizes that \noverinvestment in some sectors is inefficient use of resources. \nIn 2017, \ufb01xed investment contributed 2.4 percentage points to \nGDP growth. In India, while the share of investment in GDP \nwas a healthy 31% in 2017, it could be higher. On a positive \nnote, robust growth in manufacturing exports including iron \nand steel will improve investment prospects in India, which \nshould boost the share of investment in GDP. This follows a \nlull in production amid confusion related to goods and services \ntax\u00a0reform in mid-2017 (Figure 1.1.9). \n\nstructural reform despite its possible impact on \nshort-term growth. Indeed, both countries choose \nto forego additional growth now, as needed to \nallow reform to take effect, for the sake of \ufb01nancial \nstability later. New challenges concern the tax \nstructure and tax base, which India has recently \nbegun to tackle with some success. Strong direct \ntax collection in 2017 helped bolster GDP, but \nlower corporate tax rates will dampen growth in \ncorporate tax revenue in 2018. By contrast, the PRC \nratio of tax revenue to GDP has stagnated at 17.5%, \nwith heavy dependence on indirect taxes in the PRC \natypical at its stage of development. The authorities \nthere should broaden the tax base while ensuring \nthat the revenue system is progressive. \n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\nJan\n2016\n\nNeither India nor the PRC has shied away from \n\n1.1.9\u2002 Merchandise exports and purchasing manager\u2019s index: \n\nthe PRC and India\n\nPRC export growth\nIndia export growth\n\nPRC purchasing managers\u2019 index\nIndia purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\n% change year on year, 3-month moving average\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company; Bloomberg (both accessed 20 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200213\n\n1.1.10\u2002 Consumer and producer prices, 2017\n\nProducer price index\nConsumer price index\n\nSubdued in\ufb02ation despite rising oil prices\nIn\ufb02ation slowed in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c in 2017, \nthough more than 60% of regional economies \nexperienced higher prices.

FDI in\ufb02ows for new \n\u201cgreen\ufb01eld\u201d projects in developing Asia reached \nthe equivalent of an estimated 1.7% of GDP in 2016, \nbouncing back from a low of 1.2% in 2012 in the \nwake of the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 \n(Figure\u00a01.1.15). Preliminary data for 2017 suggests \nthat green\ufb01eld FDI declined, largely on concerns \nover new policies in developed countries at the \nbeginning of the year. However, the number of \ngreen\ufb01eld projects has been fairly steady since\u00a02012. \nIncluding mergers and acquisitions, which are \nabout a third the size of green\ufb01eld investment \nin developing Asia, the trend has changed little \nover\u00a0time. FDI into developing Asia is most \nprominent in natural resources and \ufb01nancial \nservices. That said, more than a quarter of FDI is \ntied to manufacturing value chains. \n\nThe US is an important investment partner \nin developing Asia, providing about 16% of total \nFDI into the region in 2017. The US directs 30% \nof its outbound FDI to developing Asia for a \ndiverse set of sectors: a third going to extractive \nsectors such as oil and gas, and most of the rest to \nhigh-tech services and manufactures (Figure 1.1.16). \nSome\u00a0policy makers worry that the recent US tax \ncuts may curtail future FDI \ufb02ows into developing \nAsia. However, evidence suggests that other drivers \nare more important than tax cuts when it comes to \nnew green\ufb01eld investment (Box 1.1.2).\n\nCurrent accounts move toward balance\nCurrent account balances moderated in 2017, despite \nstrong exports, because of even stronger growth \nin imports, a trend that will continue in 2018 and \n2019 (Figure 1.1.17).

The recently enacted Tax \nand Jobs Act, 2017 reduced the corporate tax rate in \nthe US from 35%, the highest in the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to \n21%, below the average Asian rate (box table). The 21% \ntax rate applies to profits earned abroad, as well as \nto domestic earnings. The law includes various other \nincentives for new investment into the US such as \nlower tax rates for cash repatriated and an immediate \n100% tax deduction for spending on capital equipment. \nThe fiscal impetus from this law on developing Asia\u2019s \nGDP is positive but negligible. \n\nThe impact of the tax rate is not immediately \nobvious. There are three channels through which US \ntax reform could affect prospective FDI, particularly to \ndeveloping Asia. \n\nThe first channel is the repatriation of past profits \n\nto US, which would reduce the supply of funds \navailable to FDI. Companies could repatriate as \nmuch as $2.5 trillion in profits held overseas, equal \nto about a third of almost $6.4 trillion in US outward \nstock, or 13% of 2017 GDP (US Treasury 2018). This \nforeign cash was held abroad before the tax law to \ntake advantage of an earlier rule deferring tax on \nforeign profits if they were not brought into the US. \n\nIndeed, following the signing of the law, prominent US \nsoftware giants announced their intention to repatriate \nprofits. However, this is likely to be gradual. Reflows \nwill occur as new project opportunities arise, which \nmay take some time. \n\nThe second effect is the possibility that US firms \nheavily invested in developing Asia will immediately \nuproot physical assets. This is highly unlikely \nbecause the cost of doing so would be prohibitive. \nThe\u00a0difference between the corporate tax at home \nand abroad constitutes only a small part of the total \ncosts of production, while the fixed costs of destocking \ncapital for long-term investments such as oil and gas, \nfor example, would be many times larger than the \nsavings from slightly higher after-tax profit. \n\nA third consideration is the decision where to \nlocate new greenfield investment. Investors still \nhave flexibility in this regard, and thus bargaining \npower, so they will carefully consider many structural \nfactors before deciding. Still, the economic literature \nsuggests that tax rates are generally not a priority \nconsideration for investors when deciding about \nlocation, and this is likely to be even more true in \ndeveloping Asia. Studies\u00a0on emerging markets show \nthat once other factors are considered\u2014such as the \nsize of the market, availability of natural resources, \n\ncontinued next page\n\nCorporate tax rates and FDI restrictiveness, selected\u00a0economies\n\nCorporate tax rates\n\nFDI index\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\n18.5%; 55% for oil and gas companies\n\n20%; 30% for oil and gas companies\n\nHong Kong, China\n\n16.5%; two-tiered profit tax regime on or after 1 April 2018\n\n30% for Indian companies, 40% for foreign companies\n\n25%; 20% for nonresident companies in the form of permanent establishment\n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\n24% with a 5% reduction for companies listed in the Lao stock exchange\n\n24% but 18% for Malaysian resident small and medium-sized companies\n\nMyanmar (average)\n\n25% for companies established under the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law, otherwise 5%\u201340% \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\n25%; 15% for high and new technology enterprises\n\n30% on net income for resident companies, or 2% based on gross income; 30% on gross income \nfor nonresident companies\n\n17%\n\n20% on net worldwide income; 30% on foreign companies for earnings in Thailand; 3% of gross \nreceipts for transport companies\n\n20%; 32%\u201350% for oil and gas enterprises\n\n35% excluding deductions but 21% starting in 2018, plus state taxes of 3%\u20135%\n\n22.34% for corporate income\u00a0tax; 22.2% excluding deductions for subnational taxes; 24.8% for \ncombined corporate income tax\n\n... = not available, FDI = foreign direct investment.\nNote: FDI Index is based on OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index, where 0\u00a0=\u00a0close, 1 = open.\nSources: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. http://www.oecd.org; Worldwide Tax Summaries. https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/\nservices/tax/worldwide-tax-summaries.html#online-tool; Asia Briefing. http://www.asiabriefing.com/news/2014/12/analysis-asias-tax-rates-part-one-\ncorporate-income-tax; and KPMG. https://home.kpmg.com.\n\nCountry\n\nCambodia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore (strict)\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nUnited States\n\nOECD average\n\n0.327\n\n0.052\n\n...\n\n0.212\n\n0.315\n\n0.187\n\n0.211\n\n0.356\n\n0.327\n\n0.398\n\n...\n\n...\n\n0.115\n\n0.089\n\n0.067\n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200219\n\n1.1.2\u2002Continued\n\nbusiness environment, and host country potential for \ndemand growth\u2014tax differentials between the guest \nand the host country tend to be unimportant (Echandi, \nKrajcovicova, and Qiang\u00a02015, James 2009). If the \ninvestor is already enmeshed in a tightly knit global \nvalue chain, shifting out of the network may entail \nsubstantial fixed costs required to link to a new supply \nchain in a new location (Swenson 2008). For investors \nwith a long-term horizon targeting natural resources, \nthe literature suggests that certainty about the fiscal \nregime and governance are more important than the \ntax rate itself (Hassett and Metcalf 1999, Hvozdyk and \nMercer-Blackman 2009).\n\nA breakdown by sector is instructive toward \nunderstanding investors\u2019 motivation when deciding \nabout location (Figure 1.1.16). St\u00f6whase (2005) and \nObeng (2014) found that the impact of taxation can \nvary substantially across sectors. For example, FDI in \n\nfood processing has alternative locations, so it may \nbe more sensitive to changes in the tax differential. \nFDI in export-oriented activities\u2014which are very \nimportant in Asia\u2014may occur in an enclave such as a \nfree trade zone, so domestic tax rates are less relevant \nthan relative labor costs. More generally, higher tax \nrates in host countries may indicate higher tax revenue \nused to improve the infrastructure and human capital \nthat is crucial\u00a0for attracting high-tech investors. This \nis why high tax revenue in a host country positively \ncorrelates with higher FDI (B\u00e9nassy-Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, Gobalraja, \nand Trannoy, 2007). Indeed, most US investment goes \nto other OECD countries, where average effective \ntax rates are much higher than in developing Asia \n(PwC\u00a02016). Policy makers in developing\u00a0Asia should \nthus worry about improving the business environment \ninstead of considering a race to the bottom on \ncorporate tax rates.\n\n1.1.17\u2002 Current account balances by subregion\n\nfrom 3.5% in 2017 to 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in\u00a02019. \nStrong import demand in South Asia caused the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit to widen to 2.1% of GDP in \n2017, and it will widen further to 2.5% in 2018 and \n2.6% in 2019. Bucking regionwide current account \ntrends, Central\u00a0Asia\u2019s current account de\ufb01cit \nnarrowed sharply from the equivalent of 6.5% of \nGDP in 2016 to 1.7% in 2017, largely because oil \nand gold price rose but also with increased trade \nvolumes.

This suggests rising demand and domestic activity \nin the region, as many economies move closer to their growth \npotential, and continued rebalancing in the PRC economy, \nwhich caused its surplus to shrink further to less than 0.2% of \nworld GDP (Figure 1.1.18).\n\nGrowth outlook remains stable\nGrowth in domestic demand is expected to become the main \ndriver of GDP expansion as growth in trade decelerates \nmoderately.

Excluding the newly industrialized \neconomies, growth will slow from 6.6% in 2017 to \n6.5% this year and 6.4% in 2019. Expansion will be \nsluggish in more than two-thirds of the economies \nin the region as growth returns to trend. India \nwill lift regional output, but its contribution will \nbe offset by controlled deceleration in PRC, which \naccounts for 58% of regional GDP (Figure 1.1.19). \nThe region will nevertheless remain the fastest \ngrowing in the world and the largest contributor \nto global growth, accounting for more than 60% \n(Figure 1.1.20).\n\nEast Asian growth is expected to slow to \n6.0% in 2018 and further to 5.8% in 2019, tracking \ngrowth moderation in the PRC. The PRC itself is \nlikely to grow by 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, \nslowing under the effect of further reduction \nin excess capacity, the gradual unwinding of \n\ufb01nancial sector vulnerability, and a shift of growth \ndrivers from capital accumulation to total factor \nproductivity. The effect of slower PRC growth \nwill extend to trade and manufacturing in the \nrest of the subregion, even with acceleration from \ndomestic drivers such as private consumption \nand government and private investment. Growth \nis therefore forecast to moderate in Hong\u00a0Kong, \nChina; the Republic of Korea; and Mongolia but \nremain broadly unchanged in Taipei,China as the \ngovernment there spends heavily on infrastructure. \nSouth Asian expansion is forecast to accelerate \n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nto 7.0% in 2018 as India regains its footing and \nfurther to 7.2% in 2019 as expansion accelerates in \nthe rest of the region as well. In India, continued \ngovernment reform and deleveraging by private \ncorporations will support recovery in investment, \nand strong growth prospects in the industrial \neconomies will boost exports this year and next. \nGrowth in India is expected to accelerate slightly to 7.6% \nin 2019, boosting the subregional average and offsetting a \nprojected slowdown in Pakistan. \n\n0\n\nIn Southeast Asia, growth is forecast to remain at its \ncurrent rate of 5.2% in 2018 and 2019 as the cyclical upswing \nfrom 2017 continues, though with individual growth patterns \nvarying.

In\ufb02ation will rise in \nall subregions except Central Asia, where it will \nbe constrained by price stabilization efforts in \nKazakhstan. Uzbekistan will continue to experience \ndouble-digit in\ufb02ation fueled by higher tariffs and the effects \nof earlier currency depreciation as they pass through from \nimports to consumer prices. In the PRC, the key drivers of \nin\ufb02ation remain strong consumer demand for commodities \nother than food and for services, higher wages, and continued \nprice deregulation for health care in particular. Higher \nproducer prices will further boost in\ufb02ation in the PRC, which \nwill accelerate to 2.4% this year before easing marginally to \n2.3% in 2019. \n\nSouth Asia will see consumer prices rise by 0.7 percentage \n\npoints to 4.7% in 2018 and further to 5.1% in 2019. In\ufb02ation \nis expected to accelerate in every country except Sri Lanka. \nIn\ufb02ation in India will increase to 4.6% in 2018 largely on rising \nglobal oil prices, likely higher procurement prices for food, and \nstrengthening rural wages. Price rises in the Paci\ufb01c will re\ufb02ect \nhigher in\ufb02ation in Papua New Guinea from the pass-through \nof higher global fuel prices and excise tax hikes on domestic \nfuel, and in Timor-Leste from higher food and fuel prices and a \nweaker US dollar, which serves as the national currency.\n\nRisks to the outlook \nProspects may be positive following robust growth recovery \nin\u00a02017, but the risks are mostly on the downside. The big risk, \nof course, would be worsening trade friction. Another would be \nrapid capital out\ufb02ows that could materialize if the US Federal \nReserve needed to raise interest rates faster than markets \n\n\f22\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nexpect. Finally, the continued build up of private\u00a0debt in some \nregional economies since the global \ufb01nancial crisis could \nundercut growth. Developing\u00a0Asia is well\u00a0positioned to respond \nto these shocks. \n\nTrade risks\nRisks to trade are high on the list. As noted above, new trade \ntariffs implemented by the US to the end of March 2018 \nhave not discernibly dented buoyant trade \ufb02ows to and from \ndeveloping Asia. However, further action and retaliation \nagainst it could undermine the business and consumer \noptimism that underlies the regional outlook. \n\nSome countries have managed to negotiate exemptions \nfrom US steel and aluminum tariffs\u2014notably the ROK\u2014but \nthis has done little to ease heightened trade worries globally. \nTensions between the US and the PRC in particular have \nratcheted up. The US announced in 3\u00a0April\u00a02018 possible \ntariffs of 25% on more than 1,300 speci\ufb01c goods, affecting \nan estimated $50 billion a year of imports from the PRC, \nequal to 2% of PRC exports in 2017 or 0.4% of GDP. The \ntariffs overwhelmingly affect PRC exports of intermediate \ninputs, especially for renewable energy, electricity generation, \nand electrical and optical equipment. In\u00a0response, the PRC \nannounced reciprocal 25% tariffs on imports from the US that \naffect 128 categories of mainly agricultural goods, also worth \n$50\u00a0billion. Most of these tariffs will take effect in the coming \nmonths unless forestalled by a conciliatory agreement between \nBeijing and Washington. \n\nWhile the direct tariff costs of the announced measures \n\nmay be small compared with growth in trade forecast for \n2018, their disruption to supply chains could sabotage business \nexpansion plans in related industries, and uncertainty over \nthe global environment could dampen currently strong \nconsumption growth. Moreover, US \ufb01rms have strong links \nwith Asian value chains in manufacturing. Any shift of \nUS investors out of Asia would risk possibly interrupting, \ndiverting, or severing global production chains now operating \nin the region.\n\nStronger intraregional links may help mitigate any effects \n\nof rising global trade tensions. Consider the Trans-Paci\ufb01c \nPartnership. US\u00a0withdrawal in January 2017 did not, as \nsome feared, spell the end of negotiations. Instead, 11 Paci\ufb01c \nRim economies moved ahead, albeit with modi\ufb01cations. \nThe resulting Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement \nfor Trans-Paci\ufb01c Partnership was signed in March 2018 by \nfour governments in developing Asia\u2014Brunei Darussalam, \nMalaysia, Singapore, and Viet\u00a0Nam\u2014and other countries may \nbe allowed to join as new members. Although signatories \nstill need to ratify the agreement, their intent to maintain \n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200223\n\nmovement toward trade openness is clear. Also, the Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership, led by the Association \nof Southeast\u00a0Asian Nations and encompassing 30% of global \nGDP and more\u00a0than 3.5\u00a0billion people, is progressing well. \nBy opening up new markets, both initiatives could dispel the \nclouds gathering over an otherwise bright horizon.\n\nCapital \ufb02ow risks\nA less headline-grabbing but nevertheless real risk is \ndiminishing capital in\ufb02ows if the Federal Reserve decides to \nraise interest rates faster than markets expect to keep \ufb01scal \nexpansion from overheating the US economy. The baseline \nassumption is that the Fed will gradually raise its benchmark \nrate 2 or 3 more times in 2018 to bring the midpoint of the \nfederal funds rate to about 2.1% by the end of 2018 and then \nraise it perhaps 2 more times in 2019 to reach 2.9% by the end \nof the year. This roughly aligns with market expectations. \nThe Fed raised its policy rate by a quarter point to 1.50%\u2013\n1.75% on 22 March 2018, as most market watchers expected, \nhaving predicted in\ufb02ation accelerating in the coming months. \nIf US core in\ufb02ation threatens to exceed 2%, the Fed may \nneed to enhance both the pace and the size of its policy rate \nadjustments, which could cause rapid capital out\ufb02ows from \ndeveloping Asia. \n\nSuch out\ufb02ows could create US dollar scarcity, possibly \nappreciating the dollar and ramping up the local currency cost \nof servicing foreign currency debt. While the \ufb01nancial effects \nof such repatriation would be unlikely to upend any economy\u2019s \nbalance of payments, it could very well mire developing Asia\u2019s \ntrade-driven growth. No sign has yet emerged of the US dollar \nappreciating signi\ufb01cantly in the short run, however, \nso there is little incentive at this point to move \nadditional capital from the region. In any case, with \nbanks that are well regulated and capitalized, and \nwith ample foreign reserves, developing Asia is in a \nstrong position to weather any capital out\ufb02ow likely \nto materialize. \n\n$\u2019000\n\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\n5\n\nFinance sector risks\nThere is concern that the region\u2019s \ufb01nancial sector \nmay be facing unknown risks from emerging \n\ufb01nancial technologies. Virtual currencies \nlike Bitcoin have proliferated in recent years. \nA\u00a0speculative frenzy caused the price of Bitcoin \nto triple to nearly $20,000 in the 3 months to \nDecember 2017, before a major selloff (Figure\u00a01.1.21). Virtual \ncurrency assets remain too small to pose a threat to national \nor global \ufb01nancial systems, their total market capitalization in \n\nJan\n2016\n\n0\n\n1.1.21\u2002Bitcoin price\n\nJun\n2016\n\nNov\n2016\n\nApr\n2017\n\nSep\n2017\n\nMar\n2018\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f24\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nmid-March 2018 equaling a mere 0.19% of global equity and \nbond capitalization. Wary policy makers have nevertheless \nbeen restricting their use and circulation and are gearing up \nto ringfence \ufb01nancial systems. International coordination is \nessential to address these challenges and ensure adherence to \nnational rules and regulations.\n\nHowever, an emphasis on \u201ccrypto mania\u201d misses \n\nthe promise in the underlying technology. Blockchain \nor distributed ledger technology opens up opportunities \nin development \ufb01nance and related efforts (Box 1.1.3). \nPolicy\u00a0makers and development lenders can facilitate \ndevelopment-friendly distributed ledger technology through \ntargeted infrastructure investments and regulation that either \nuses a test-and-learn sandbox approach to \ufb01ne-tune new \ntechnologies before implementing them on a wider scale or \nadopts the results of experience in other countries.\n\nIn addition to new risks, the region\u2019s \ufb01nancial sector faces \n\nmore familiar challenges. The ongoing rise in US interest \nrates and the consequent tightening of global liquidity pose \nchallenges to \ufb01nancial stability. The buildup of private debt \nin the region since the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 \nhas ampli\ufb01ed this risk. More speci\ufb01cally, there are concerns \nthat the post-crisis debt buildup may adversely affect \ufb01nancial \nstability and economic growth, especially in Asian countries \nthat have experienced rapid expansion of household or \ncorporate debt. In light of such possible effects, the next section \nanalyzes the relationship between growth in private\u00a0debt and \neconomic growth. The analysis \ufb01nds no positive relationship \nbetween private debt growth and economic growth beyond the \nshort term. This raises concerns about the quality of the added \ndebt and strengthens the case for closely monitoring debt \ntrends and building more efficient \ufb01nancial systems.\n\nConclusion\nThe downside risks to a generally benign economic outlook \nare far from negligible. However, the trade revival last year \nreinforced strong trade links within Asia and built up \ufb01nancial \nbuffers in many Asian economies, especially commodity \nexporters. The stronger \ufb01scal and \ufb01nancial position of many \ncountries in 2017 should allow them to manage risks. The\u00a0best \nrecourse for Asia is to take advantage of the current good \ntimes to deepen structural reform that is otherwise difficult \nto impose. Such reform would put Asia in an even stronger \nposition to withstand future shocks.\n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200225\n\n1.1.3\u2002Distributed ledger technology and its promise for development finance \n\nThe blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is viable \nand ripe for broader application. Indeed, distributed \nledger technology (DLT), to use the broader but \nusually interchangeable term, opens opportunities \nfor applications that can revolutionize the financial \nsector. DLT-based clearing and settlement is beginning \nto replace inefficient back-office infrastructure, for \nexample, and operations such as exchanging cash \nfor securities will increasingly be accomplished in a \nmatter of seconds, rather than days as is currently \nthe case. DLT has far-reaching implications for the \ndeveloping world in multiple areas. Remittances, \nmicrocredit, and trade finance are just a few of the \nmany possible applications.\n\nRemittances. Remittances are a stabilizing source of \nforeign exchange for many economies in Asia and the \nPacific, accounting in 2016 for 30.5% of GDP in the \nKyrgyz Republic, the highest percentage in the region, \nand for 9.8% even in the relatively large Philippine \neconomy. However, sending money to relatives from \nabroad is slow and costly. Transfers may take several \ndays, and banks and money transfer companies \ntypically charge 7% of the amount transacted and \nsometimes much more (World Bank 2015). To avoid \nthese costs, remitters often transfer funds through \ninformal channels, such as a visiting friend or relative \ncarrying cash.\n\nSeveral companies now offer DLT-based remittance \n\nservices in several Asian economies. Compared with \ntraditional channels, which require a centralized \nentity to perform the actual remittance, DLT \nservices save time and transaction costs by making \nthe role of corresponding banks less central to the \nsettlement process. The widespread use of internet-\nenabled mobile phones among the poor enables \nDLT-based remittances to reach the unbanked far \nbeyond\u00a0the reach of the traditional financial channels \n(Dong\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02016).\n\nMicrocredit. Catering to the financially excluded, \nmicrocredit continues to expand, especially in \ndeveloping Asia and Latin America. It typically \noperates at the village level, leveraging the capacity of \npoor communities and economically disenfranchised \ngroups, in particular women, to assume joint liability \nand monitor peer compliance. Lenders seek to lower \nthe high transaction costs of small-scale lending \nbut often incur substantial costs in dispatching loan \nofficers to periodic community meetings. As a peer-\nto-peer communications system that distributes trust \namong members of a shared network by ensuring \n\ndecision by consensus, DLT is particularly well suited \nto microcredit and to microfinance more broadly. \nIt functions as an open accounting system, placing \nborrowers\u2019 transaction histories on a shared ledger, \nwhich eliminates the need for outside audits or \ndocumentation of loan applicants\u2019 credit and income \nhistories. \n\nDLT enables unbanked individuals to build a \n\npersonal credit history and thus a bankable reputation \ngradually and organically. It lets lenders monitor and \nassess the capital loaned, the areas of operation, and \nany development opportunities. Pilot applications \nsuggest that, compared with traditional centralized \nmicrofinance operations, the DLT-powered mode \nincurs significantly lower overhead and achieves faster \ntransaction times. In 2016, for example, Japanese \ncompanies successfully operated DLT microcredit \ntransactions in Myanmar. The evidence gathered \nduring these trials suggests that the DLT platform will, \nassuming full-fledged commercial implementation \nby 2019, reduce costs to a tenth of those incurred \nby traditional microcredit operations in Myanmar \n(Redaktion 2016, Del Castillo 2016).\n\nTrade finance. The global trade finance gap was \nestimated at $1.5 trillion in 2016 (ADB 2017b). \nShortfalls were particularly severe in Asia, which \naccounted for the largest share of proposals\u2014firms\u2019 \nrequests to banks for trade finance support\u2014and \nrejections. Access to trade finance is particularly \ndifficult for small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) because they often lack collateral, a \ndocumented history of past commercial and financial \ntransactions, or sufficient knowledge of the finance \nindustry and instruments on offer. National and \nregional initiatives to bridge this gap, including some \nled by multilateral development banks, increasingly \nlook forward to technology that can make a difference. \nSome innovation is coming from leading companies \n\nin global e-commerce. They have established their \nown lending arms, catering mostly to SMEs, or provide \ntraining and advice tailored especially for smaller \ncompanies. However, except in the PRC, these services \nhave yet to penetrate developing Asia, where the \nsupply gap for SME financing remains particularly \nacute (The Banker 2017). In these economies, DLT \ncould be a real game changer by lowering costs and \ndoing away with the paperwork and bureaucratic \nhurdles that preclude access for SMEs.\n\nSource: Ferrarini, Maupin, and Hinojales 2017.\n\n\f26(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nPrivate debt and  \neconomic\u00a0growth\n\nSome economies in developing Asia have since the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 (GFC) experienced rapid growth \nin private debt, both corporate and household. Concern \nis rising that the buildup of private debt may threaten \n\ufb01nancial stability, especially as interest rates rise with \nmonetary policy normalization in the advanced economies. \nFurther, some studies \ufb01nd that private debt buildup, in \nparticular by households, predicts lower GDP growth and \nhigher unemployment in the medium term (Mian, Su\ufb01, and \nVernier\u00a02017). These counterintuitive results, if con\ufb01rmed, \nhave major implications for economic policy and development. \nAn\u00a0empirical study presented in this section sheds light on the \nnature of the relationship between private debt accumulation \nand economic growth, particularly in Asia.\n\nPrivate debt mounting in Asia as the \nadvanced economies deleverage\nLow global interest rates since the GFC, re\ufb02ecting \nunprecedented monetary expansion in the advanced countries, \nencouraged Asian households and companies to borrow \nheavily, driving up the ratio of private debt to GDP in many \nAsian economies (Figure 1.2.1).

The four economies hit hardest by the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis of \n1997\u20131998 are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand.\nSources: ADB calculations based on the BIS Debt Securities database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nIn the advanced economies, corporate and \n\nespecially household debt increased sharply before the \nGFC\u00a0(Figure\u00a01.2.2a). In the post-crisis period, corporate debt \nstabilized while household debt decreased. Narrowing the \nfocus to the US, the dynamics of private debt were more \ndramatic, rising rapidly before the GFC and falling after, mostly \nled by household debt (Figure 1.2.2b). This is consistent with \nthe widely held view that the main cause of the GFC was a \nrapid increase in household debt under lax credit appraisal and \napproval. \n\nUnlike the advanced economies, emerging economies \ncontinued to accumulate private debt even after the GFC \n(Figure 1.2.2c). In Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, \nand Thailand, the four Asian economies hardest hit by the \nAsian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, the pronounced increase \n\n\f28(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nin private debt before the earlier crisis was driven largely \nby corporate debt (Figure 1.2.2d). This is consistent with \nthe popular view that the crisis was precipitated by Asian \ncompanies borrowing heavily in foreign currency to \ufb01nance \ninvestment projects such as property that generated revenue \nonly in local currency, and that the surge of borrowing drove \ndown the quality of investment. \n\nIt bears noting that private debt expansion is not \n\nnecessarily a cause for concern in itself, especially in emerging \neconomies with immature \ufb01nancial systems. It may re\ufb02ect \nsimply the development of the national \ufb01nancial system from \na low base. Further, ease in borrowing can smooth investment \nand consumption to the bene\ufb01t of all. That said, rapid debt \naccumulation can affect growth adversely through several \nchannels. First, households and corporations may not be able \nto service their debt, undermining bank health, especially if \nloans are not backed by adequate collateral. Second, the need \nto allocate resources to pay debt service can syphon funds from \nconsumption and investment. Rising interest rates accentuate \nboth of these risks. \n\nThird, excessively leveraged \ufb01rms and households can \nin\ufb02ate asset prices. When the bubble bursts, banks and other \n\ufb01nancial institutions suffer a surge of bad loans and have \nto cut back on their lending, which hurts investment and \nconsumption. Because it generally takes some time for banks \nto repair their balance sheets, credit to \ufb01rms and households \nwill be disrupted for some time. Further, \ufb01rms and households \nhave to cut back on investment and consumption to repair their \nown damaged balance sheets. This is why recessions stemming \nfrom \ufb01nancial stress tend to be deeper and more persistent \nthan recessions from other causes, exacerbating volatility in \nthe business cycle. \n\nThe experience of the developed countries sheds light on \nhow harmful private debt buildup can be to economic growth. \nThe immediate cause of the GFC and the bad recession that \nfollowed was the rapid buildup of US private debt, which taxed \nprocedures to appraise loans for creditworthiness. The\u00a0world \neconomy has yet to recover fully from the loss of growth \nmomentum caused by that recession. \n\nIn light of these considerations, the ongoing escalation \n\nof global interest rates is putting the spotlight on the \nbuildup of private debt in Asia, in particular in Malaysia, \nthe Republic of Korea, and Thailand, where household \ndebt is large and growing, and in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, where corporate debt is fast expanding (ADB\u00a02017a). \nAlthough\u00a0developing Asia currently enjoys a positive \neconomic\u00a0outlook, rising corporate and household debt poses \nrisks to growth over\u00a0time. \n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity(cid:29)(cid:29)29\n\nIntuitively, is private debt buildup  \nbad for growth?\nThe discussion above indicates that private debt buildup can \neither boost economic growth or hinder it. A positive credit \ndemand shock can result from an expectation that productivity \nor long-term income will increase, bringing subsequent output \ngrowth. The current Fourth Industrial Revolution, for example, \nis encouraging \ufb01rms to borrow and invest in potentially game-\nchanging new technologies, and it is encouraging individuals \nto borrow to invest in \ufb01rms that stand to bene\ufb01t from the \nrevolution. On the other hand, if credit supply shocks are \ndriven by lenders\u2019 irrationally exuberant expectations and \ndisregard for downside risks, debt accumulation in high-risk \nsectors eventually brings about a reversal in investor sentiment \nand subsequently harms growth. A recent example is the \nUS\u00a0subprime mortgage crisis that morphed into the GFC. \nIn sum, theoretical ambiguity renders the relationship \n\nbetween private debt growth and economic growth an \nempirical issue. Unfortunately, the literature on empirical \nexperience is thin (Box 1.2.1). \n\n1.2.1\u2002Empirical studies on private debt and growth\n\nThe link between public debt and economic growth \nis well established in the literature, examined in, \nfor example, Baum, Checherita, and Rother (2013), \nChecherita and Rother\u00a0(2012), \u00c9gert (2015), Kumar and \nWoo (2010), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). However, \nonly a few studies have empirically examined the \nimpact of private debt on economic growth, and they \nhave been largely confined to the advanced economies. \nMian, Sufi, and Verner (2017) found a significant \nnegative relationship between economic growth in \nthe advanced economies and private debt, especially \nhousehold debt, accumulated through credit shocks \npositive for either demand or supply. By decomposing \nprivate debt into household debt and nonfinancial \ncorporate debt, the study showed household debt \nmore than corporate debt closely related to the boom-\nand-bust cycle. \n\nSutherland and Hoeller (2012) examined the impact \n\nof debt in different sectors\u2014government, private \nfinancial, private nonfinancial, and household\u2014\non economic stability in member economies of \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD). It found private sector debt not \nconsistently related to GDP volatility but household \ndebt positively associated with consumption volatility, \nand short-term private sector debt with investment \n\nvolatility. Cecchetti, Mohanty, and Zampolli (2011) \nexamined the separate impact of public, corporate, \nand household debt on economic growth in OECD \neconomies. It showed both corporate and household \ndebt having significant negative correlation with \ngrowth in GDP per capita, but only corporate debt \nsignificantly positively related to volatility in growth \nof GDP per capita. Further, it found that excess private \ndebt not only constrained the capacity of financing to \nsmooth economic cycles but also caused large swings \nin asset prices, which tended to trigger recessions \nwhen an economy slows down. \n\nWhile these studies looked mostly at the amount \n\nof private debt, it is worthwhile to examine how \nthe speed of private debt accumulation affects \neconomic growth and the occurrence of recessions. \nJord\u00e0, Schularick, and Taylor (2013) showed that \nrecessions caused by financial crises were costlier \nthan others, and that economic expansions with rapid \ncredit buildup were followed by deeper recessions. \nThese\u00a0results were confirmed by Claessens, Kose, and \nTerrones (2012). Bernardini and Forni (2017) found \nthe effect of private debt buildup to have even more \npronounced effects on the duration and intensity of \nrecessions in emerging economies.\n\n\f30(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nEmpirical evidence on private debt \nbuildup and economic growth\nPark, Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) empirically analyzed the \neffect of private debt growth on output growth.

This aggregate was divided into \nhousehold debt and nonfinancial corporate debt. \nReal\u00a0GDP, real consumption, and real investment \ndata were collected from the Penn World Table\u00a09.0. \nPark,\u00a0Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) provides the full \ndefinition of data sources of these variables and other \ncontrol variables, the methodology for calculation of \nper capita values, and the summary statistics of all \nvariables used in the empirical analysis.\n\n The mean values of household debt and corporate \n\ndebt as shares of GDP are higher in the advanced \neconomies, at 55.5 and 83.7, respectively, than in \nemerging economies, at 26.0 and 55.3. In both groups, \nhousehold debt is smaller than corporate debt but \ngrows slightly faster. However, the standard deviation \nof annual increases in corporate debt is much higher \nthan that of household debt, at 2.8 versus 5.4 in the \nadvanced economies and 2.1 versus 5.3 in emerging \neconomies.

While the coefficients of household debt growth on \noutput growth in the same and the following\u00a0year are positive \nand statistically signi\ufb01cant, those for the third year and later \nare negative and statistically signi\ufb01cant. These\u00a0results suggest \nthat, while a buildup of household debt boosts output growth \nin the very short run, it predicts lower output growth for \n3\u00a0years starting with the fourth\u00a0year. In\u00a0contrast, no buildup of \ncorporate debt ever increased output growth, even in the short \nrun, but rather predicted lower output growth in 1\u20133\u00a0years, \nimplying that corporate debt buildup was likely a positive \nsupply shock, prompted by eager banks. While the estimated \ncoefficients of corporate debt were smaller, their negative impact \nwas comparable to that of household debt.\n\nThe results also indicated that, as the debt amount rose, \nthe negative impact of debt growth on output growth declined. \nYet,\u00a0in the advanced economies where the existing debt amount \nwas relatively high, further additions to debt harmed output \ngrowth in the medium term. This implied the possible existence \nof a threshold amount beyond which debt growth threatened to \nharm economic growth.\n\nIn emerging economies, which were generally less \ufb01nancially \n\ndeveloped and indebted, growth in household debt had a \nsigni\ufb01cantly positive impact on output growth in the short term, \n\n\f32(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nbut the effect turned negative in the \ufb01fth year and persist in the \nsixth year. By contrast, corporate debt growth had a signi\ufb01cantly \nnegative impact on output growth in the \ufb01rst 4\u00a0years. \n\nAgain, the opposite sign of the coefficients on interaction \n\nterms between debt amount and debt growth suggests that \n\ufb01nancial sector development helps to stabilize the effect of debt \ngrowth on output growth. Further, in emerging markets, the \nhousehold debt amount had a negative impact on output growth \nafter 5 years but did not have any signi\ufb01cant impact in the short \nterm. On the other hand, the amount of corporate debt generally \nhad no signi\ufb01cant impact on output growth in the long run.\n\nThe empirical analysis further indicated that, in advanced \nand emerging economies alike, household debt was lower than \ncorporate debt but increasing slightly faster, while the annual \ngrowth rate of corporate debt was more variable.\n\nConcluding observations  \nand policy implications\nEvidence revealed in Park, Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) suggests \nthat the positive effect of private debt growth on output growth \nis short-lived in emerging economies, and the effect is limited to \nhousehold debt growth. In fact, the evidence indicates that the \nrelationship between both household debt growth and corporate \ndebt growth on the one hand, and economic growth on the other, \nis negative in the medium term. This strengthens the case for \npolicy makers in developing Asia to closely monitor the buildup \nof private debt, especially in light of the potential risk that debt \nbuildup poses for \ufb01nancial stability as global liquidity tightens. \nIn addition to monitoring credit developments, it could be useful \nto pursue macroprudential measures that stemmed excessive \ncredit buildup. Also useful would be early warning systems that \ncould trigger action from supervisory authorities if signs emerged \nof excessive borrowing, falling lending standards, or inability to \nservice debt. The analysis further points to the need for \ufb01nancial \nsector development as a means to alleviate the impact of private \ndebt growth on boom\u2013bust cycles. \n\nThese results may be controversial, but they are \ufb01rst steps \ntoward empirically examining the relationship between private \ndebt growth and output growth, an important policy issue that \nmerits further research. Park, Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) \nfocused on the quantity of debt, but the quality of debt matters at \nleast as much to \ufb01nancial stability and economic growth. If\u00a0debt \nis used to \ufb01nance unproductive activities, its effect is more likely \nto be negative. If private debt growth largely re\ufb02ects credit \nsupply shocks driven by irrationally exuberant lenders who ignore \ndownside risks, debt will build up in high-risk sectors, as it did in \nthe US housing market before the US\u00a0subprime mortgage crisis \nand in many Asian corporations before the Asian \ufb01nancial\u00a0crisis. \n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity(cid:29)(cid:29)33\n\nDebt\u00a0buildup eventually erodes investors\u2019 con\ufb01dence and \ncauses subsequent growth decline. The\u00a0evidence thus \nreinforces the case for\u00a0stronger prudential \ufb01nancial supervision \nand regulation\u2014a case that has gained force since the GFC \nand its recession upended the global \ufb01nancial system and the \nworld\u00a0economy.\n\nBackground paper\nPark, D., K.

Growth is expected to continue to the forecast \nhorizon, with the US sustaining growth for the group at 2.3% \nin 2018 and a bit lower at 2.0% in 2019 as tax cuts boost private \nspending. Meanwhile, growth in the euro area and Japan will \nmoderate in both years. Fading \ufb01scal incentives in several euro \neconomies offset the area\u2019s favorable employment conditions, \npositive market sentiment, and accommodative monetary \nstance. In Japan, domestic manufacturing and corporate \ninvestment are still expected to contribute to growth. However, \nexpansion may be limited by tepid consumption spending and \nexports constrained by an appreciating yen.  \n\nA1.1\u2002Baseline assumptions on the international economy\n\nGDP growth (%)\nMajor industrial economiesa\n\nUnited States\n\nEuro area\n\nJapan\n\nPrices and in\ufb02ation\n\nBrent crude spot prices (average, $\u00a0per\u00a0barrel)\n\nFood index (2010 = 100, % change)\n\nConsumer price index in\ufb02ation  \n\n(major industrial economy average, %)\n\nInterest rates\n\nUnited States federal funds rate (average, %)\n\nEuropean Central Bank re\ufb01nancing rate (average, %)\n\nBank of Japan overnight call rate (average, %)\n$ Liborb (%)\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nActual \n\nADO 2018 \nProjection\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20020.9\n\n44.0\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20020.7\n\n\u20020.4\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.5\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20021.7\n\n54.3\n\n\u20020.7\n\n\u20021.7\n\n\u20021.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20021.1\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20022.7\n\n\u20022.2\n\n\u20021.4\n\n65.0\n\n\u20021.2\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20021.9\n\n\u20021.0\n\n62.0\n\n\u20021.2\n\n\u20021.7\n\n\u20022.7\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20022.7\n\nADO = Asian Development Outlook, GDP = gross domestic product.\na\u2002Average growth rates are weighted by gross national income, Atlas method.\nb\u2002Average London interbank offered rate quotations on 1-month loans.\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov; Eurostat,  \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat; Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.go.jp;  \nConsensus Forecasts; Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company; Haver Analytics; and the World Bank, \nGlobal\u00a0Commodity Markets, http://www.worldbank.org; ADB estimates.\n\n\f36\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nRecent developments in the  \nmajor industrial economies\n\nUnited States\nAfter a disappointing \ufb01rst quarter (Q1) in 2017, \nthe\u00a0US economy grew by 2.3% in the full year. \nThe\u00a0economy slowed to a still strong 2.9% seasonally \nadjusted annualized rate (saar) in Q4\u00a02017, less \nthan the 3.0%-plus saar in the previous 2 quarters. \nQ4 decelerated mainly because private investment \nslowed and net exports subtracted heavily from \ngrowth (Figure A1.1). However, neither factor \nraises much concern about the strength of the \neconomy. The contribution of private investment \nfell to 0.8 percentage points in Q4, mainly from \na drop in nonfarm inventories, while \ufb01xed \ninvestment continued to soar. Net exports trimmed \n1.3 percentage points from GDP as imports grew \ntwice as fast as exports, which surged by 7.0% in \nthe quarter despite the strong US dollar. Private \nconsumption remained the main pillar for growth, \ncontributing 2.8 percentage points to Q4 2017 \ngrowth, while a rebound in government spending \nadded 0.5 percentage points.\n\n2017, hitting 4.0% saar in Q4 2017. Retail sales \nimproved steadily in 2017 and stayed strong in\u00a0the \n\ufb01rst 2 months of 2018. This is consistent with the \ncontinuing employment and wage strength in \nthe\u00a0labor market. The index of consumer con\ufb01dence \nremained upbeat throughout 2017, reaching a 17-year \nhigh of 124.4 in November 2017 (2007\u00a0=\u00a0100) and a \nnew peak of 126.6 in February 2018 (Figure\u00a0A1.2). \nThis result suggests that recent stock market \nvolatility has had little impact on consumer \nsentiment. Recently passed tax cuts may have \ncheered consumer sentiment by boosting disposable \nincome, thereby lifting aggregate demand. In sum, \nthe trends underlying private consumption suggest \nthat it will remain strong, with private consumption \nin Q1 2018 potentially much stronger than in the \npast 2 years. \n\nThough contributing little to GDP growth, \n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\nprivate investment grew at a healthy 4.7% in Q4 2017. \nFixed investment expanded even more, with 6.8% growth \nin nonresidential investment outpacing 4.7% growth in \nQ3\u00a02017, mainly re\ufb02ecting double-digit growth in equipment. \nResidential investment rebounded in Q4, expanding by \n12.8% after 2 quarters of contraction.

Nevertheless, even after contracting in Q1 2017, \ntotal investment contributed 0.6 percentage points to annual \nGDP growth.\n\nFurther investment growth is possible, as the outlook is \nstill robust. The purchasing managers\u2019 index approached 60 \nin both January and February, its highest since August 2005 \nand up from 56.4 in December\u00a02017. In addition, the industrial \nproduction index continues to hover above 100, indicating that \nproduction has been somewhat better than in the base year, 2007. \nTogether, the two upbeat indexes suggest continued expansion \nin US production. This\u00a0momentum may, along with the tax cuts, \nspur further expansion in domestic investment to complement \ncontinued growth in private consumption. \n\nLinked to the upbeat trend in aggregate \ndemand, the positive trends in the labor market \nin 2017 continued into 2018. A further 313,000 \nnonfarm jobs were added in February 2018 after \na strong 239,000 increase in January. Moreover, \nthe unemployment rate has remained at a 17-year \nlow of\u00a04.1% since October 2017, with the possibility \nof further decline (Figure\u00a0A1.3). The average \nduration of unemployment shortened, to 22.9 weeks \nin February 2018 from 25.1 weeks a year earlier. \nAverage weekly earnings rose by 2.9% in February \n2018, up from 2.8% in January.\n\nThe continuing strong growth in US economic \n\nactivity should eventually stir domestic in\ufb02ation. \nHeadline in\ufb02ation recently inched above 2.0%, \nbut core in\ufb02ation has remained soft at 1.8% \n(Figure\u00a0A1.4). Along with the steady decline in \nunemployment, the upward trend in in\ufb02ation from \ngreater \ufb01scal stimulus and additional purchasing \npower will motivate the Federal Reserve to advance \nits gradual normalization of monetary policy. \nHow fast normalization progresses will depend \non growth and in\ufb02ation during the year. Current \nthinking is that the Fed may gradually raise its \nbenchmark rate in each quarter of 2018, bringing \nthe federal funds rate to about 2.1% by year-end. \nAt\u00a0least two more increases in the \ufb01rst half of 2019 \nare planned, raising the rate to about 2.9%.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nA1.3\u2002 Unemployment rate and average duration, \n\nUnited\u00a0States\n\nUnemployment, \nseasonally adjusted\n\nAverage duration\nof unemployment\n\nNumber of weeks\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 26 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nA1.4\u2002 Inflation, United States\n\nHeadline\nCore\n\n%, seasonally adjusted\n\nWith these developments, the US economy is \nexpected to grow by 2.7% in 2018, re\ufb02ecting the \nshort-term impact of tax cuts and higher spending, \nbefore moderating somewhat to 2.3% in 2019 \nwith the lagged effect of tighter monetary policy. \nIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 2.3% in 2018 but ease to \n2.1% in 2019 in response to monetary tightening.

Recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum may \nslow growth by increasing domestic production costs. Possible \nretaliation from trade partners could trigger a global trade war, \ncreating serious downside risks to the global economy.\n\n6\n\nEuro area\nWith GDP rising by 2.4% saar in Q4 2017, the euro \narea recorded its best growth since the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. The region expanded \nby 2.5% in 2017, up from 1.8% in 2016 (Figure\u00a0A1.5). \nDomestic demand continued to contribute growth, \nbuoyed by high market con\ufb01dence, supportive \nmonetary and \ufb01scal policies, and labor market \nrecovery. Investment recovered notably in \nQ4\u00a02017 to contribute 0.7 percentage points to \ngrowth, equal to the combined contributions of \ngovernment and private consumption. However, net \nexports contributed the most to growth in Q4, at \n1.8\u00a0percentage points. Strengthening global demand \nsupported a healthy rise in exports and helped \noffset the strengthening euro, which reached its \nhighest value in 3 years. Growth appears robust \nacross economies. Germany grew by a strong \n2.5%, though less than in Q3 2017. Italy and Spain \nshowed similar trends. Among the gainers, the \nNetherlands expanded the fastest, at 3.2%, while Belgium \nmore than doubled its growth rate from Q3. France, Greece, \nand Portugal\u00a0also improved from Q3, though at a slightly less \nbuoyant pace.\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\nEconomic sentiment in the euro area held \nstrong during much of 2017, spurred by strong \njob creation, higher savings expectations, and \noptimistic businesses. Unemployment fell to 8.7% in \nDecember, its lowest rate since January 2009 and a \nboost to consumer con\ufb01dence and retail spending \nacross euro economies (Figure A1.6). In December, \nthe consumer con\ufb01dence index moved into positive \nterritory for the \ufb01rst time in 16 years. Business \nsentiment held strong on higher orders and \nimproved pro\ufb01t margins. The composite purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index remained well above the 50 \nthreshold, with broad growth in output and hiring. \nIndustrial production expanded twofold over 2016, \ndriven by robust production of capital goods. \n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\nEarly indicators suggest that the euro area entered 2018 on \n\na high note.

However, economic sentiment \nweakened in February, with export orders and \nhiring plans expected to slow somewhat from \nhistoric highs across sectors.\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n56\n\n52\n\nIn\ufb02ation downshifted to 1.4% in December 2017, \n1.3% in January 2018, and 1.2% in February, mainly \nbecause energy prices stabilized after their peak \nin Q1 2017 and food prices were lower. Euro area \nfull-year in\ufb02ation stood at 1.5% in 2017, signi\ufb01cantly \nabove 0.2% in 2016 but short of the European \nCentral Bank target of 2.0%. However, recent \nstrengthening of the euro against the US dollar has \ndampened in\ufb02ationary pressure. The European \nCentral Bank kept its interest rates unchanged at \nits March 2018 meeting: zero for re\ufb01nancing and \u20130.4% for the \ndeposit facility. Starting in January, monthly asset purchases \nin the quantitative easing program halved to \u20ac30 billion from \nthe previous \u20ac60 billion, a rate of purchase set to continue until \nSeptember.\n\nJan\n2016\n\n48\n\nGrowth is forecast to remain strong in 2018, moderating \nslightly to 2.2%. Last year\u2019s tailwinds in the form of favorable \nemployment conditions, strong market sentiment, and \naccommodative monetary stance are likely to continue this \nyear, offsetting weakening \ufb01scal incentives in several euro \neconomies. Rising real wages and continued job creation will \nkeep household spending healthy, while stronger demand \nwill support high capacity utilization and investment growth. \nA\u00a0strengthening global economy is likely to keep export growth \nrobust. However, its contribution to GDP growth may moderate \nthis year if growth in global trade slows or the euro continues \nto appreciate. With wage pressures contained and some slack \nin the labor market, in\ufb02ation will still likely remain below the \nEuropean Central Bank target. \n\nPolitical uncertainty has receded notably from last year, \nbut challenges remain. The outcome of the elections in Italy\u2014\nputting a Eurosceptic majority in Parliament\u2014poses some risk \nto the euro area political landscape. Germany\u2019s two major \nparties eventually agreed to form a coalition government, \nwhich will have to provide the impetus necessary for \ncritically needed reform to the European Union. Negotiations \non the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the union progressed \nin late\u00a0March. The parties agreed on the legal text for the \ntransition period following withdrawal in March 2019. \nNegotiations will now move to discussing future ties, including \nthe terms of a trade agreement and other contentious issues.\n\nBy 2019, temporary factors that have supported growth in \nthe recent past will have faded, and GDP growth is expected \nto slow further to 1.9%. In\ufb02ation is expected to accelerate, \n\n\f40\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nhowever, because of higher energy taxes and the fading \nimpact of earlier low energy prices. Improved labor markets \nand favorable \ufb01nancing conditions will continue to support \nhigher domestic demand. However, employment growth is \nlikely to moderate, especially as public sector employment \nwill start falling in some economies, and skills shortages may \nbegin to emerge. Investment spending will receive substantial \nsupport from faster disbursement of funds under the European \nUnion\u2019s 2014\u20132020 budget programming period. However, \ndevelopments leading to the United\u00a0Kingdom\u2019s scheduled exit \nin March 2019 may constrain large investment decisions.\n\nJapan\nRecovery continued to the end of 2017, when the economy \nexpanded for an eighth consecutive quarter. Supported by \nstrong global demand and accommodative monetary policy, \nGDP grew by 1.7% in 2017, up from 0.9% in 2016. On\u00a0the \npositive side, stronger economic activity has created more jobs \nand reduced unemployment, which should spur consumer \nspending. Wages and prices are rising only sluggishly, however, \nposing risks to sustained economic growth.\nIn Q4 2017, economic growth slowed to \n1.6% saar from 2.4% in the previous quarter \n(Figure\u00a0A1.8). The economy bene\ufb01tted from \na rebound in private consumption, which \ncontributed 1.1 percentage points to GDP growth. \nPrivate investment added 0.7 percentage points, \nsuggesting a strengthening of domestic demand, \nthough government consumption and investment \ncontributed little to growth. The external sector, \nwhich played a key role in economic recovery \nearlier, subtracted from growth as a surge in \nimports offset strong export growth. While growth \nlost some momentum toward the end of 2017, data \nshowing strong imports could be a positive sign that \ndomestic demand is picking up.\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n \n\n-4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nEarly Q1 2018 results suggest, however, that the \nyear had a soft start. Industrial production, which \nhad recorded 7 relatively strong quarters fueled \nby buoyant external demand, slowed sharply in \nJanuary from the previous month (Figure A1.9). \nThe Nikkei Japan manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index \nslid to 54.1 in February from 54.8 in January.

This followed increases in November and \nDecember. Consumer con\ufb01dence also slipped, from \n44.3 in January to 43.7 in February, which analysts \nsuggest re\ufb02ects the impact of stock market volatility \non consumer \ufb01nances. Con\ufb01dence nevertheless \nremains elevated in recent terms, and prospects \nfor higher demand are good thanks to favorable \nlabor market conditions. In January, unemployment \nfell to 2.4%, its lowest rate in 25 years, down from 2.8% \nin December.

Consumer price in\ufb02ation rose in \nFebruary to 1.5% year on year from 1.3% in January, \nthe highest in nearly 3 years (Figure\u00a0A1.10). \nIt\u00a0remains, however, below the Bank of Japan \nmedium-term target of 2.0%. Core in\ufb02ation, \nwhich excludes more volatile fresh food and \nenergy components, edged up to 0.4% in February. \nThe Bank of Japan has kept its accommodative \nmonetary policy unchanged, with the short-\nterm policy rate at \u20130.1% and 10-year Japanese \ngovernment bond yields capped at about zero.\nThe all-important export sector, which \nhad propelled recovery since 2016, continued \nto grow strongly in 2017, driven by demand for machinery \nand transport equipment, in particular motor vehicles and \nsemiconductors. Much of the growth in demand for these items \ncame from the People\u2019s Republic of China. Imports grew faster \nthan exports in Q4 2017, however, generating a trade de\ufb01cit. \nIn\u00a0January, exports rose by a strong 16.3% over the previous \nyear, while imports increased by 11.8%. \n\nJan\n2015\n\n\u20131\n\n0\n\nExternal demand may continue to feed into domestic \n\nmanufacturing and private investment bolstered by \naccommodative \ufb01nancial conditions. However, a plunge \nin industrial production at the start of the year and tepid \nconsumption spending cloud the outlook for domestic demand. \nAnd yen appreciation against the US dollar since the start of \n2018 may undermine future export demand.

Oil prices \nare forecast to remain below $70/barrel, however, as upward \npressure from higher global demand and reduced OPEC output \nis tempered by increases in oil production outside the cartel, \ndoubts that the OPEC production cut will last, and appreciation \nof the US dollar, in which prices are denominated. Food prices \nare forecast to post a small gain, edging up by just\u00a0over 1% \nin\u00a0the next 2 years in response to strong demand \nand higher oil prices.

Oil supply from outside \nOPEC rose by 0.7 mbd in 2017, partly offsetting a 0.8 mbd \ndecline in 2016. The US produced most of the increase as its \ncrude oil production grew by 5.3%, from 8.9 mbd to 9.3\u00a0mbd, \neven surpassing 10.0 mbd in November for the \ufb01rst time \nsince 1970. Conversely, supply from OPEC fell by 0.4 mbd, \nthe \ufb01rst annual decline since 2013. Saudi Arabia posted the \nbiggest strategic decline, reducing its supply by 0.6 mbd, \nor 21% more than its agreed cut. Venezuela had the biggest \nunplanned decline, at 153 thousand barrels per day, as its oil \nindustry reeled from insufficient investment, delayed payment \nto suppliers, and US sanctions. World oil demand increased \nby 1.6\u00a0mbd in 2017, or 21% above the 1.3 mbd increase in 2016. \nWith oil demand increasing faster than supply, global oil \ninventory declined by 0.5 mbd in 2017 after 3 consecutive years \nof inventory increases.\n\nOil prices have been volatile in recent months. \n\nPrice\u00a0support has come from the OPEC decision in November \n2017 to extend to the end of 2018 the agreement to cut \nproduction, as well as from unplanned supply disruption. \nMeanwhile, constraint on prices has come from rising US \nproduction; seasonal re\ufb01nery maintenance around the world, \nwhich temporarily suppresses demand for crude oil; and a \nstrengthening US dollar, which makes the dollar-denominated \ncommodity more expensive for countries paying in other \ncurrencies. After piercing $70/barrel in mid-January for the \n\ufb01rst time since December 2014, Brent crude oil prices retreated \nand were trading below $65 at the start of March 2018. \n\nThe International Energy Agency report Oil 2018 said that \n\noil markets seemed adequately supplied up to 2020. Growth \nin global oil demand is forecast to be 1.4 mbd in 2018, slightly \ndown from the 1.6 mbd estimated for 2017. The main swing \nfactor for world oil supply will be US production. According to \nthe US Energy Information Agency, US crude oil production \nis forecast to average 10.3 mbd in 2018, which would be the \nhighest in US history. The agency forecasts production to \nincrease to an average of 10.8 mbd in 2019 and to surpass \n11.0\u00a0mbd by the end of the year. OPEC, meanwhile, is doing \nits part to alleviate the global oil glut and keep a lid on oil \n\ufb02ows. Group oil output fell in February to a 9-month low as \nmost members reduced production by more than what their \nagreement required.\n\nDespite signs that the global oil glut is shrinking, the \nincrease in Brent crude oil prices is tempered by rising output \nfrom US shale oil producers, continued concern about whether \n\n\fTurning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200245\n\nA1.14\u2002Brent crude futures and spot prices\n\nparticipants in the OPEC deal can stick to their \nproduction quotas, and the strengthening US dollar. \nFutures markets show Brent crude trading above \n$60/barrel in the forecast horizon (Figure A1.14). \nBarring a major supply disruption, the price of \nBrent crude is forecast to average $65/barrel in 2018 \nand $62/barrel in 2019.  \n\nAverage spot price\n15 March 2017\n15 March 2018\n\n$/barrel\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nJan\n2014\n\nFood price movements and prospects\nFood prices, as measured by the World Bank food \nprice index, edged up by 0.7% in 2017, but this was \nsolely from a rise in the \u201cother food\u201d component \n(Figure A1.15). The retreat on the edible oil index \ncame primarily from soybean. Prices for soybean \nfell by 1.2% and for soybean meal by 5.6% with good \nharvests in the US and forecasts of ample global availability in \nthe 2017/18 crop year. Palm oil prices were little changed from \na year earlier as growing conditions in Malaysia and elsewhere \nin Southeast Asia were favorable. Turning to grains, declines \nin prices for maize and barley offset slight increases for wheat \nand rice that re\ufb02ected tight supply and buoyant demand. Maize \nprices continued to decline for a \ufb01fth consecutive year, mostly \nbecause of ample supply and a comfortable supply outlook for \nthe short term. \n\n120\n\n2010 = 100\n\nThe food price index averaged 93.47 points in \nFebruary 2018, or 2.2% higher than in January but \njust 0.4% above February 2017. The grain price \nindex averaged 86.9 points in February, up by 11.2% \nfrom a year earlier. The February increase marked \nthe eighth consecutive month of index increases \nyear on year. Grain prices rose as well month on \nmonth, bolstered by rising demand and concern \nover unfavorable weather hitting US winter wheat \nand Argentine maize. International rice prices also \nstrengthened owing to \ufb01rm import demand. Prices \nfor most vegetable oils weakened amid prospects of \na growing global glut in the 2017/18 crop year. Palm \noil price quotations dropped the most, undermined \nby disappointing exports and rising inventories in \nIndonesia and Malaysia. International sugar prices \nremained under downward pressure as production \nby major producers such as India and Thailand \ncontinued to expand.

The boost in US private spending led by \ufb01scal \nstimulus and higher import demand should pay a dividend \nto commodity exporters in the region. While oil prices are \nexpected to remain subdued, higher global demand is applying \nupward pressure on commodity prices. Monetary policy \ncontinues to be accommodative in the euro area and Japan, \nbut a rising trend in in\ufb02ation and purchasing power in the US \nis driving a gradual tightening there. Monetary authorities in \nmost Asian economies will nevertheless keep policy rates low. \nIn sum, developing Asia enjoys a broadly supportive external \nenvironment and looks ahead to further economic expansion.\n\n\f2\n\nHow tecHnology \naffects jobs\n\n\f\fHow technology \naffects jobs\n\nDeveloping Asia has created 30 million jobs annually in \nindustry and services over the past 25 years. Job creation has \nbeen accompanied by improved productivity, rising earnings \nfor workers, and large reductions in poverty. Contributing \nto this process are shifts in employment from sectors with \nlow productivity and pay, such as agriculture, to sectors \nwith higher productivity and pay. However, a larger part of \nthe aggregate productivity gains come from sector-speci\ufb01c \nimprovements in productivity, mainly thanks to technological \nadvances such as high-yielding crop varieties in farming, \nmodern machine tools in manufacturing, and information and \ncommunication technology in services.1\n\nThe jobs challenge is far from over. From 2015 to 2030, the \nlabor force in developing Asia is projected to increase by about \n11 million per year. So Asia needs more jobs but also better \njobs. The broad contours of action and policy needed to meet \nthe jobs challenge are well known: timely and appropriate \ninvestments in education, infrastructure, and research and \ndevelopment, as well as a policy framework emphasizing \nmacroeconomic stability, openness to trade and foreign \ndirect investment, and an investment climate conducive to \nbusiness (ADB 2015a, 2017a). However, concern is growing \nthat some elements of this framework will no longer improve \nlabor market outcomes for many workers. Paradoxically, the \nconcern stems from the fundamental driver of human progress \nthroughout history: technological change. \n\nThis chapter was written by Elisabetta Gentile, Rana Hasan, and Sameer Khatiwada, \nall in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, with \ntechnical support from Donald Jay Bertulfo, Erik Jan Eleazar, John Paul Flaminiano, \nPia\u00a0Marie Medrano, Rhea Molato, Orlee Velarde, and Mia Kim Veloso.

In particular, the \ngrowing sophistication of robotics and AI raise the possibility \nof unprecedented automation and displacement of labor. \nIn\u00a0apparel and footwear manufacturing, for example, \n\u201cworkerless factories\u201d are being tested using completely \nautomated production. In services, it is becoming technically \nfeasible to automate more complex tasks in occupations \nsuch\u00a0as customer support. How will new technologies affect \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia\u2019s ability to generate more and better jobs? \n\nThis is the central question of this chapter. Considering \nthe many\u00a0uncertainties that arise in any analysis of a nascent \nand rapidly evolving phenomenon, the question is addressed \nthrough several exercises that together shed light on how the \nrelationship between technology and jobs will likely play out \nin the region. The exercises are embedded within an analytical \nframework that clari\ufb01es the different channels through which \ntechnology affects jobs. Moreover, they focus on different \naspects of technology and capture their effects in various ways, \nsome more direct than others. Thus, while some exercises look \nat the effects of automation through, for example, the adoption \nof industrial robots in manufacturing, others take a broader \nview of technology and capture its effects through more \nefficient production or distribution of goods and services along \nthe global supply chain.\n\nThe analysis concludes that several forces will likely work \n\nagainst the pervasive job displacement that some predict. \nIn\u00a0the\u00a0\ufb01rst\u00a0place, the economic feasibility of automating \nin many parts of Asia today lags technological feasibility, \nleaving the adoption of\u00a0the latest laborsaving technologies \nsome ways\u00a0off. Perhaps most importantly, higher productivity \nwill generate more demand for novel goods and services, \nproviding a powerful countervailing force to automation-driven \ndisplacement of labor. Moreover, technological advances and \neconomic growth will generate new occupations and industries, \nfurther contributing to job\u00a0growth.\n\nClearly, though, new technologies and automation will \nimpose hardships on some workers. Several types of jobs will \nbe lost. While new ones will appear, they will require skills \nthat workers do not yet possess, and they may arise in locations \nremoved from the homes of displaced workers. Low\u00a0wage \ngrowth and higher unemployment among the less-skilled \ncould become, alongside other causes of income inequality, \na feature of labor markets if governments fail to take action. \nAccordingly, this chapter looks at the implications for public \npolicy, especially on education and skills development, and on \nlabor regulations and social protection systems, while touching \non other topics. \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)51\n\nRising concern over \ntechnology displacing jobs\n\nAn overview of labor markets in Asia and the \nPaci\ufb01c reveals how important higher productivity \nis to reducing poverty and improving the quality of \njobs to make them more remunerative and formal. \nTechnological progress plays a vital role in raising \nproductivity but inevitably raises nagging concerns \nabout job security. Today, robotics and AI\u00a0promise \never greater improvements to productivity, but \nwill these bene\ufb01ts come with ever worsening \njob prospects for working people? Assessing this \npossibility is important but not straightforward. \nTechnology affects job prospects through several \nchannels, calling for an analytical framework that \nclari\ufb01es the various channels and the conditions \nunder which they operate. The\u00a0\ufb01rst step in \nconstructing such a framework is to consider \nthe shape of the labor market and workplace in \ndeveloping Asia today. \n\nAsia at work \nDeveloping Asia has the largest regional labor \nforce in the world, with nearly 2 billion workers. \nIndia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthe region\u2019s two giants, account for almost 70% of \nthe total (Figure 2.1.1a). The regional labor force is \nprojected to grow by 0.5% annually from 1.9\u00a0billion \nin 2015 to 2.1\u00a0billion in 2030 and 2.2\u00a0billion in \n2050. India\u00a0is\u00a0projected\u00a0to\u00a0account for 30% of the \nregional total labor force by 2030, with the PRC \nshare declining to 37%. One cause of this shift is \nthat the labor force is aging. The decline in the \nshare of the 15\u201324 age group and an increase in \nthe share of the three oldest age groups are quite \nevident for the region as a whole\u00a0(Figure\u00a02.1.1b). \nConsiderable\u00a0variation\u00a0in\u00a0age\u00a0distribution\u00a0exists \nby country, with different implications for \ngrowth in the national labor\u00a0force (Figures 2.1.2 \nand\u00a02.1.3).

Even in \nmany\u00a0services, new technologies are raising the specter of \nlabor-displacing automation. \n\nUnderstanding the relationship \nbetween\u00a0technology and jobs \nFrom knitting machines and power looms to electricity \nand computers, automating production has been at the \nheart of economic development. Since the \ufb01rst industrial \nrevolution starting with the steam engine, being able \nto automate tasks in a production chain has been \ninstrumental to raising labor productivity (Figure 2.1.8). \nAcross history, automation has always displaced workers, \ngenerating anxiety about technological change. However, \ndisplacement has been accompanied by the emergence \nof new occupations, and job opportunities have not \ndiminished. Moreover, not all technology displaces human \nlabor. Magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray machines, \nfor example, perform functions humans cannot, thereby \ncomplementing, not displacing, human labor in medical\u00a0care. \nHowever,\u00a0the\u00a0advent\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Fourth\u00a0Industrial\u00a0Revolution\u00a0has \nheightened automation anxiety. Underpinned by more \nsophisticated robots and computing power, automation \nis taking over more and more tasks once thought to be \nuniquely human (Box 2.1.1). The\u00a0key issue is whether the \nFourth Industrial Revolution is different from previous ones. \nIs\u00a0widespread \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d\u2014as warned \nby notable thinkers such as David\u00a0Ricardo, Karl Marx, \nand John Maynard Keynes\u2014more\u00a0likely this time around? \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)59\n\n2.1.8\u2002Industrial revolutions: four episodes of technological breakthrough\n\n1st Industrial Revolution\n\n2nd Industrial Revolution\n\n3rd Industrial Revolution\n\n4th Industrial Revolution\n\n1760\u20131900\nUse of steam and\nmechanically driven\nproduction facilities\n\n1900\u20131970\nMass production driven by \nelectricity and based on \ndivision of labor\n\n1970\u2013present\nExtensive use of controls, \ninformation technology, and \nelectronics for an automated \nand high-productivity \nenvironment\n\nFuture\nSmart applications that \nintegrate virtual and \nphysical production \nsystems\n\nSource: ADB based on Schwab (2017).\n\nThis\u00a0section\u00a0presents an analytical framework that explains \nthe different channels through which technology affects jobs. \nA useful framework for analyzing the impact of new \n\ntechnologies on jobs is provided in Autor, Levy, and \nMurnane\u00a0(2003), Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor (2015), and \nAcemoglu and Restrepo (2018).

Further, a particular task may \nbe automatable but the associated job safe from being displaced \nbecause automation may only restructure the job, such that \nworkers are freed up to focus on other tasks. By\u00a0implication,\u00a0only \njobs consisting mainly of routine and manual tasks, such\u00a0as \nmachine operator and assembler, will\u00a0likely be displaced. \nJobs\u00a0that entail some routine and manual tasks, such as clerk \nand IT assistant, are less likely to\u00a0be\u00a0displaced.\n\nTo illustrate, Figure 2.1.9 shows that occupations with a \n\nlarger share of routine tasks are more likely to be automated, \nwhile those with a lower share are less likely. Workers\u00a0in \noccupations in quadrant 4 (researchers and managers) are safe \nbecause the majority of their tasks are difficult to automate and \nnew technology augments the value of their labor. In\u00a0contrast, \nworkers in quadrants 1 and 2 hold jobs with mostly routine \ntasks, including cognitive routine jobs (accountants and bank \ntellers) and manual routine jobs (sewing machine operators and \nassembly line workers). These\u00a0jobs are at risk of displacement \nby laborsaving technology. Manual\u00a0and\u00a0nonroutine jobs in \nquadrant\u00a03 (cook and hairdresser) are not yet heavily affected by \nlaborsaving technology.\n\nConcern that automation could cause widespread job loss \n\nis cited in many recent studies (Table 2.1.3). However, the \nconcern appears to stem from considering only the displacement \neffect of automation, many of these studies ignore other effects \n(Figure\u00a02.1.10). Channels through which automation has an \nimpact on jobs can be divided into within-\ufb01rm or -industry \neffects and between-industry effects.\nWithin-\ufb01rm or -industry effects. There are three main channels \nthrough which new technology affects labor demand within a \n\ufb01rm or industry:\n\n(i) Displacement effect. Because robots and computers \n\nare good at routine tasks, demand will fall for jobs \ncomprising mainly routine tasks. A manual worker in \nan industrial warehouse whose job is to fetch products \nfrom shelves, for example, is likely to be displaced, \nperhaps by Kiva system robots, which can traverse \nlarge \ufb02oor spaces to \ufb01nd products much faster than \nhumans. Interestingly, though, displacement is bounded \nby tasks that humans accomplish effortlessly but \ncomputer programmers struggle to code into routines. \nPolanyi\u2019s\u00a0Paradox recognizes that we know more than \nwe can tell (Autor 2015, Polanyi 1966).\n\n(ii) Productivity effect. Sometimes called a scale effect, \n\nit is when automation improves productivity and \nlowers production costs. Under normal conditions, \nthis lowers the price of goods and services, which \nraises demand for them.

This is not an exhaustive list of recent studies.\n\nmore sophisticated and widely used in production \nlines in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c, for example, the cost of \nproducing cars could go down, pushing down prices \nand spurring increased demand for cars. To the \nextent that increased demand requires hiring more \nworkers, it could offset the displacement effect from \nautomation.\n\n(iii) Reinstatement effect. Automation can spawn new \nlabor-intensive tasks and jobs, raising demand for \nlabor. New job categories could emerge as AI is \nintroduced into production, for example, or when a \nmore sophisticated industrial robot is introduced on a \nfactory \ufb02oor and needs programming or tending. \n\nCross-industry effects. Adopting new technology in \none industry has an impact on productivity and jobs in \nother\u00a0industries. There are two main channels through which \ncross-industry effects change labor demand.\n\n(i)\n\nSpillover effect. As one industry adopts new \ntechnology, positive spillover affects other industries \nin at least three ways. First, \ufb01rms in downstream \n\n\f64(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n(ii)\n\nindustries bene\ufb01t from cheaper and/or better-quality \ninputs, while \ufb01rms in upstream industries bene\ufb01t \nif the output of the automating industry expands. \nSecond, other industries learn the bene\ufb01ts of adopting \nthe new technology. Third, workers with new skills \nand knowledge move between industries, spreading \ntechnological know-how.\nIncome effect. When technology complements labor, \nworkers\u2019 higher incomes create positive spillover on \nother industries through increased demand for goods \nand services. A software developer whose income \nhas increased thanks to complementarity between \nautomation and human labor, for example, may want \nto buy a bigger car, a faster computer, better health \ncare, more vacations, or other leisure services. \nAggregate impact on employment. Still other factors in\ufb02uence \nhow technology affects jobs.\n\n(i)\n\nComplementarity between labor and technology.\nIf workers carry out tasks that are complemented \nby automation, demand for such workers will likely \nincrease, as will their wages. If workers perform tasks \nthat can be done solely by machines, they are likely \nto be displaced. That said, the technical feasibility \nof automating a set of tasks does not necessarily \nmake automation economically viable. The price of \nnew technology relative to labor cost is a crucial \ndeterminant of whether automation takes place. \n\n(ii) Elasticity of labor supply. An example would \nbe a within-industry effect with technology \ncomplementing human labor. Even if demand for \ntasks supplied by a software developer rises, there \ncan be no signi\ufb01cant change in employment unless \nthere is an adequate supply of appropriately skilled \nworkers. Assuming labor supply is not very elastic, \nwages earned by software developers and researchers \ntend to rise, which incentivizes more workers to enter \nthose jobs. However, high labor supply elasticity\u2014an \nabundance of workers with the requisite training as a \nsoftware developer\u2014could mitigate wage gains. \n\n(iii) Demand response to income elasticity. Rising \n\nincomes in one industry create demand for goods \nand services in other parts of the economy, but \nthis depends on how responsive demand is to \nincreased income. Consider again the example of \nsoftware developers whose labor is complemented by \nautomation. How much of the increase in wages are \nthey willing to spend on goods and services supplied \nby other sectors? The answer will help determine \nemployment and wages in the other sectors.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)65\n\n(iv) Workforce skills. To take advantage of automation and \nnew types of tasks created in the economy, workforce \nskills need to match technological requirements. New \ntasks require new skills, and education and training \nare key. A mismatch between skills and technologies \nslows the adjustment of employment and wages, \nhindering productivity growth. \n\nIndeed, careful investigation of time series data spanning \n\nmany decades shows these forces at play, countering the job \ndisplacement effects that arise when new technologies allow a \ngiven output to be produced by fewer workers (Box 2.1.2).\n\n2.1.2\u2002Productivity and employment: different forces at play \n\nBessen (2017), an analysis of employment data spanning \ndecades, powerfully illustrates the idea that laborsaving \ntechnologies can raise employment in adopting \nindustries. With the introduction in 1814 of textile \npower looms in the US, productivity soared, reducing \nprices, raising incomes, and increasing demand for \ntextile products. Similarly, the assembly line Henry \nFord introduced in 1913 increased productivity in the \nautomobile industry, reducing prices and increasing \ndemand for cars. Long-term employment trends in the \nUS show that strong employment growth took place \nin the decades when technological advances improved \nlabor productivity (box figure). Bessen (2017) called \nthis the \u201cinverted U\u201d pattern of employment, wherein \nemployment expands for an extended period before it \nstarts declining. Employment in the US textile industry, \nfor example, grew for about a century before it peaked \nand began declining. \n\nSimilarly, Autor and Salomons (2017) studied \n19\u00a0high-income countries and shed further light on \nwhether laborsaving technological progress erodes \nemployment. As in Bessen (2017), the relationship \nbetween productivity growth and employment \ngrowth was positive in aggregate. However, at the \nindustry level, rising labor productivity forces down \nemployment within the industry, and this phenomenon \nprevails across all industries. The study reconciles \nthese seemingly opposite results by showing that, \nwhen one industry improves labor productivity, \nspillover affects employment in other industries. \nSpillover stems from the income effect pushing up \nfinal demand and interindustry demand linkages.\n\nTo fully understand the impact of technology on \nemployment, it is important to examine the impact of \nproductivity gains using input\u2013output analysis, as this \n\nMillion\nMillion\n1.5\n1.5\n1.2\n1.2\n0.9\n0.9\n0.6\n0.6\n0.3\n0.3\n0.0\n0.0\n\nMillion\nMillion\n2.5\n2.5\n2.0\n2.0\n1.5\n1.5\n1.0\n1.0\n0.5\n0.5\n0.0\n0.0\n\nsheds light on interindustry linkages and final demand \neffects (Autor and Salomons 2017).

A key point is that, even if it is technically \nfeasible to replace a job with machines, it may not be economically \nfeasible. \n\nSecond, analysis of the relationship between technology and \nemployment in global value chains provides further insight into \nhow various forces have affected jobs and will shape their future. \nDecomposition of employment changes from 2005 to 2015 using \na demand-based input\u2013output approach is instructive about \nhow different forces affect job numbers, types, and locations in \nglobal value chains. While the technologies needed for extreme \nautomation are only just starting to appear, advances such as \ncomputer numerically controlled machines and modern ICT \ntools were already coming online in factories and \ufb01rms in Asia \nover the period covered. Two results stand out: Rising demand, \nspurred by improved efficiency or labor productivity, more \nthan compensates for technology-induced displacement of jobs. \nFurther,\u00a0any\u00a0\u201creshoring\u201d of production to advanced economies may \nnot be a major threat to employment in developing Asia. \n\nThird, this section examines changes in occupation titles, which \n\nshow that advances in technology have created new jobs. This is a \nprominent countervailing force against the displacement effect of \ntechnology (Lin 2011). A detailed analysis of occupation titles shows \nthat new types of jobs have emerged in highly skilled occupations. \nMoreover, a comparison of occupations in the region with those in \nadvanced economies show great scope for job\u00a0growth.\n\nIndustrial robots and employment outcomes\nIndustrial robots are the epitome of new technology and automated \nsystems in production processes. Robots take many forms and \nshapes and can do many human tasks. The International Federation \nof Robotics (2016) de\ufb01nes a machine as an industrial robot if it \ncan be programmed to perform physical, production-related tasks \nwithout the need of a human controller. The federation database \nprovides information on industrial robot deliveries and robot stock \nfrom 1993 to 2015, covering 55 economies including 23 in Asia.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)67\n\n2.2.1\u2002Annual supply of robots and sectoral employment\n\nAsia\u2019s use of industrial robots is accelerating, its \noperational stock having risen from 2010 to 2015 by \n70% to 887,400 units. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest \nmarket for industrial robots, annually taking 43% \nof all sales in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c, followed by the \nRepublic of Korea with 24% and Japan with\u00a022%. \nInternational Federation of Robotics estimates \nsuggest, moreover, that by 2019 almost 40% of \nthe world\u2019s industrial robots will be in the PRC. \nThe\u00a0federation predicts that robot installation will \ncontinue to grow in all major Asian robot markets. \nRobot sales by industry show the largest share of \nrobots in Asian manufacturing going into electrical \nand electronic goods and the automotive industries. \nMetal processing comes next, closely followed \nby plastic and chemical products (Figure 2.2.1a). \nThe\u00a0robot skillset lends itself to the standardization \nand \ufb01xed nature of automotive and electronics \nassembly using hard materials, as opposed to \nsoft\u00a0material such\u00a0as the fabric used in apparel \n(United States Government\u00a02016). \n\na.

The two \nlargest users of industrial robots in Asia, electrical \nand electronics industries and automotive \nmanufacturers, each accounted in 2015 for 39% \nof Asia\u2019s robot stock but only 9.2% and 4.2%, \nrespectively, of manufacturing employment. \nIn\u00a0contrast, food and beverages accounted for \n1.3% of Asia\u2019s industrial robots but 12.3% of Asian \nmanufacturing workers, and textiles, apparel, and \nleather for 0.1% of robots and 19.2% of workers. \nThe\u00a0data imply that any adverse employment \neffects from the use of new technology, particularly \nrobots, will not be widespread. The more labor-intensive \nmanufacturing industries have low rates of robot deployment, \nlargely because automation is not economically viable. The\u00a0one \nexception to this trend is the PRC, which employs large \nnumbers of workers in capital-intensive sectors where the \npotential for robot deployment is high (Box 2.2.1). This\u00a0means \nthat the PRC is more exposed to automation than other \neconomies in developing Asia.\n\nTechnical versus economic feasibility \nMany recent studies that looked at the impact of automation \non jobs focused on the technical feasibility of automating a \nset of tasks. But technical feasibility is one thing, economic \nfeasibility another. For new technology to signi\ufb01cantly \n\n\f68(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.2.1\u2002Robots, automation, and jobs in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n\nRapidly rising wages in the PRC have induced firms \nto embrace automation and robots in a trend that will \nshift the nature of work and demand for new skills. \nFrom 2013 to 2016, annual robot purchases by the PRC \nincreased by 106%, compared with 65% globally. In \n2016, the PRC became the world\u2019s largest robot market, \nreceiving 30% of global sales. By industry, robots \nare concentrated in automobiles at 39%; computers, \ncommunication, and consumer electronics at 24%; \nand metal processing at 10%. Because the PRC has a \nvery large workforce, the ratio of robots to workers \nremains much lower than in advanced countries, but \nthe government announced an ambitious plan to triple \nthe ratio from 49 robots per 10,000 workers in 2015 to \n150 by 2020. \n\nAccording to the China Employer-Employee Survey, \nwhich covered over 1,100 manufacturing firms in Hubei \nand Guangdong provinces in 2016, 49% of workers are \nin firms with computerized numerically controlled \nmachines, including 9% in firms with robots. The \nsurvey found 13% of firms received subsidies for robots \npurchased in 2013, 20% in 2014, and 18% in 2015. The \naverage subsidy was 20% of the\u00a0cost.\n\nWhat kinds of firms automate? \nFirms that automate tend to be larger, older, more \ncapital intensive, high-tech, and located in special \neconomic zones\u2014and firms using robots even more so \n(box table 1). Compared with both unautomated firms \nand those using numerically controlled equipment, \nfirms using robots are more globalized in that they \nexport a larger share of their production and are more \nlikely foreign owned.\n\nCharacteristics of automated firms, by number \nand\u00a0type of worker and by wage level \nAutomated firms generally have twice as many \nemployees as those that are not, and those with robots \nhave 6 times as many. Employees at firms with robots \nhave higher educational attainment and are paid better \nacross all occupations (box table 2). They also have \na lower proportion of managers to production and \ntechnical workers. The wage premium for technical \nworkers over production workers is 30% in firms with \nno automated equipment (90% for managers) and 50% \nin firms with robots (180% for managers). Regression \nanalysis finds the relationship between relative \nwages and automation persists even after controlling \nfor other company characteristics. Although not \nnecessarily causal, the results are consistent with \nautomation being more complementary to skilled \nthan to unskilled work, suggesting the trend toward \nautomation will likely increase demand for skilled \nworkers in the PRC.\n\n1\u2002Firm characteristics by degree of automation\n\nNumerically \ncontrolled \nmachines but \nno\u00a0robots\n\nNo \nautomation\n\nFeature\n\nShare of firms (%)\n\nEmployees (number)\n\nFirm age (years)\n\nRatio of capital to labor \n\u2002\u2002 (CNY\u2019000 per employee)\n\nLocated in \neconomic\u00a0zone\u00a0(%)\n\nOwnership (%)\n\n\u2002\u2002State\n\n\u2002\u2002Domestic private\n\n\u2002\u2002Foreign\n\nExport share of sales (%)\n\nSource: Jia, Park, and Du 2018.\n\n51\n\n445\n\n11\n\n251\n\n56\n\n12\n\n68\n\n20\n\n22\n\nRobots\n\n9\n\n2,721\n\n16\n\n321\n\n77\n\n15\n\n43\n\n41\n\n29\n\n40\n\n811\n\n13\n\n296\n\n68\n\n11\n\n67\n\n22\n\n20\n\n2\u2002Firm employment and wages by degree of automation\n\nNumerically \ncontrolled \nmachines but \nno robots\n\nRobots\n\nNo \nautomation\n\nFeature\n\nEducation of employees (%)\n\n Junior high school \nand\u00a0below\n\n\u2002\u2002Senior high school\n\n\u2002\u2002College and above\n\nOccupation of employees (%)\n\n\u2002\u2002Production workers\n\n\u2002\u2002Technical workers\n\u2002\u2002 (Ratio of technical to \nproduction\u00a0workers)\n\n\u2002\u2002Managers\n\u2002\u2002 (Ratio of managers to \nproduction\u00a0workers)\n\n\u2002\u2002Production workers\n\n\u2002\u2002Technical workers\n\u2002\u2002 (Wage ratio of technical \nto production workers)\n\n\u2002\u2002Managers\n\u2002\u2002 (Wage ratio of \nmanagers to \nproduction\u00a0workers)\n\nSource: Jia, Park, and Du 2018.\n\n50\n\n33\n\n17\n\n73\n\n8\n(0.11)\n\n13\n(0.18)\n\n3,887\n\n5,062\n(1.30)\n\n7,424\n(1.91)\n\nMonthly wage by occupation (CNY)\n\n46\n\n36\n\n18\n\n74\n\n10\n(0.14)\n\n11\n(0.15)\n\n35\n\n40\n\n25\n\n77\n\n12\n(0.16)\n\n6\n(0.08)\n\n4,294\n\n6,200\n(1.44)\n\n4,779\n\n7,242\n(1.52)\n\n9,071\n(2.11)\n\n13,372\n(2.80)\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)69\n\ndisplace human\u00a0labor, it needs to become economically viable \n(Figure\u00a02.2.2a).

After agriculture and construction, \ngarments are the third largest employer in the three \neconomies examined here: Bangladesh, Cambodia, \nand\u00a0India. \n\nAutomation in all three has moved quickly over \nthe past decade, but the main driver differs in each \ncase. Three formerly manual-intensive processes\u2014\ncutting, spreading, and ironing\u2014are now done more \naccurately, twice as quickly, and with one-tenth of the \nworkers. A Jacquard weaving machine increases daily \noutput per worker sixfold. Automation reduced labor \ncosts per garment but, more importantly, reduced \ndelivery time for greater flexibility, encouraging \nfactory expansion for exploiting economies of scale. \nIn the three economies, labor equals only 10%\u201320% of \nbasic garment variable cost. As a result, costs are only \nmarginally affected by wage increases on the one hand \nand reductions in unit labor cost on the other. Instead, \nsavings from automation derive more from reduced \nwaste and higher volume\u2014and therefore better return \non fixed costs. Still, profit margins in recent years have \n\nbeen squeezed by intense competition as suppliers \nchase sluggish demand growth in consumer markets. \n\nIt is difficult to predict how long before full \nautomation occurs. Sewing is a very labor-intensive \nprocess. Technological advances in sewing machines \nhave improved accuracy but have not yet replaced \njobs. Most executives of large garment exporters say \nreplacing operators with sewing robots is unlikely in \nthe next decade because it is barely feasible, either \ntechnically or economically, and the industry would \nneed to adapt. One current estimate says the unit labor \ncost of producing a cotton shirt in the US is about $7. \nThe approximate cost of producing the same shirt in \nIndia is $0.50, in Bangladesh $0.22, and in Cambodia \n$0.33. Sewing robots should narrow the gap, with some \nobservers saying robotics will reduce basic apparel \nproduction costs in the US and Europe to about $0.40. \nDeveloping countries would lose their competitive \nedge, which would encourage reshoring, or reversing \nthe outsourcing of production. However, as discussed \nbelow, rising demand from within Asia could be an \nimportant offset to job displacement on account of \neither automation or reshoring. \n\nIt\u00a0shows\u00a0routine\u00a0task\u00a0intensity within manufacturing highest \nin food, beverages, and tobacco; textiles, apparel, and leather; \nand transport equipment. The horizontal axis is labor \ncompensation, or wages calculated using labor force surveys. \nIt shows job displacement by robots to be economically more \nfeasible in capital- and skills-intensive manufacturing such\u00a0as \ntransport equipment, chemicals, and electrical equipment. \nBigger bubbles on the right show robot usage more common in \nsectors where wages are higher. \n\nRobot density and employment\nSeveral new studies examine the impact of industrial robots on \nemployment. The empirical evidence is inconclusive. Acemoglu \nand Restrepo (2017b) found industrial robot adoption negatively \ncorrelated with employment and wages, and this holds across \nindustries. Developments in the US from 1990 to 2017 showed \nthat each additional robot displaced six workers, and raising \nrobot density by one new robot per thousand reduced wages \nby 0.5%. In manufacturing, the most affected occupations are \nroutine manual\u2014typically blue-collar workers without college \ndegrees. By contrast, Graetz and Michaels (forthcoming) found \nin 17 developed countries that, from 1993 to 2017, robotics \naccounted for 10% of GDP growth and, in industries with \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)71\n\nhigher robot density, 16% of labor productivity and wage \ngrowth. This study found no evidence of robotics driving down \naggregate employment. However, results vary by skills group, \nwith robotics reducing hours worked and wages for low- and \nmiddle-skilled workers, but having had no signi\ufb01cant effect on \nhigh-skilled workers. \n\nSo, simple correlation between robot density and \n\nemployment growth yields a somewhat ambiguous picture. \nWhen jobs are divided into routine and not, however, routine \nemployment negatively correlates with robot density, while \nnonroutine employment positively correlates (Figure\u00a02.2.3). \nEmpirical analysis corroborates these descriptive trends.\n\nIndeed, there is no signi\ufb01cant relationship between \nadopting robots and overall employment (Table 2.2.1a). But \nwhen robot adoption is disaggregated by type of employment, \nthe relationship is different: Routine employment decreases \nwith the increased usage of robots, while nonroutine \nemployment increases (Table 2.2.1b). In addition, robot \nadoption signi\ufb01cantly correlates with a decrease in routine \nmanual occupations such as production workers and an \nincrease in nonroutine cognitive occupations such as managers \nand professionals (Table 2.2.1c). Most important is the \ndifference between developing and developed countries, as \nthe impact of robots on labor demand is larger in developed \ncountries than in developing countries (Table 2.2.1d). \n\n2.2.3\u2002Robot density and employment, routine versus nonroutine\n\na.

Production units can be nearby or located \nanywhere on the globe, and labor contributes to virtually every \ntask along the chain. Two additional factors have made this \nunbundling possible: trade liberalization and lower transport \ncosts through improved logistics, infrastructure, and transport \ntechnology. This process redistributed global economic activity, \nwith Asian economies emerging as key players. In\u00a02016, Asia\u2019s \nGVC participation, measured as the share of gross exports of \nvalue added used for further processing through cross-border \nproduction networks, was 61.1% (ADB\u00a02017b). This was second \nonly to the European Union.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)73\n\nGVCs signi\ufb01cantly affect employment in participating \neconomies. Changes in the structure of GVCs, in particular \nthose caused by new technology, have corresponding effects on \nemployment. Developing economies that boost production for the \nexport market often see a signi\ufb01cant increase in manufacturing \njobs. In\u00a0Bangladesh, for example, the emergence of GVC-oriented \ngarment exports has created more than 3 million new jobs over the \npast 2 decades (Farole and Cho 2017). In\u00a0most low-cost, routine, \nlabor-intensive GVCs such as garments, footwear, and electronics, \nthe\u00a0largest employment share is occupied by young women, many of \nthem newcomers to the workforce.\n\nGVCs have made it easier for developing economies to adopt \nnew technologies. For example, technologies developed in high-\nincome economies, such as numerically controlled machines and \nmodern ICT tools, are used by factories and \ufb01rms all along GVCs. \nArguably, business use of ICT has been a boon for women in the \nlabor market (Box 2.2.3).\n\nWhile new technologies improve productivity, they raise \ntwo main concerns for developing economies. First, extreme \nautomation can have signi\ufb01cant implications for\u00a0jobs. As Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution technologies such as digital manufacturing \nbecome more sophisticated and cost-effective, \ufb01rms in developing \neconomies could lose many jobs if reshoring production back to \nadvanced economies becomes feasible. In fact, however, if the cost \nof new technologies lowers signi\ufb01cantly, it is conceivable that \ufb01rms \nin developing economies may use them too.\n\nSecond, to the extent that upgrading technology is skill-biased, \nit shifts demand from workers with lower skills to those with higher \nskills, widening inequality. This poses a problem for developing \neconomies competitive in low- to medium-skill activities, as using \nadvanced technology could create a shortage of high-skilled workers \nand surplus of medium- and low-skilled workers.\n\nCombining multiregional input\u2013output tables developed by \nthe Asian Development Bank with employment data from labor \nforce surveys4 allows research that examines the relationship \nbetween technology and jobs along supply chains in 12 economies \nin developing Asia, covering 35 sectors from 2005 to 2015.5\nThe\u00a012\u00a0economies accounted for 90% of employment in developing \nAsia in 2015.6 In the tables, a GVC is de\ufb01ned by \ufb01nal products \nproduced by a particular industry in a particular economy. \nFor\u00a0example, \u201ctextiles and textile products \ufb01nalized in the PRC\u201d is \nconsidered a GVC that encompasses a wide range of \ufb01nal products, \nfrom garments to awnings and canopies (Timmer et al. 2014).\n\nThe analytical framework developed in Reijnders and de Vries \n(2017) is used to analyze changes in demand for jobs by modeling \nthe input\u2013output structure of the world economy. The focus is \non the relative importance of changes in various determinants \nof demand for jobs in economies and the sectors within them. \nThis\u00a0analysis is among the \ufb01rst to frame the quanti\ufb01cation of these \neffects in a setting of internationally fragmented GVCs in\u00a0Asia.\n\n\f74(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.2.3\u2002How information technology skills help women find better jobs in Viet Nam\n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) \nwould seem to be gender-neutral, but in fact \nbusinesses\u2019 increased use of ICT has positive effects \nfor women in the labor market. Chun and Tang (2018) \nexamined this by exploring the interplay between \nfirms\u2019 ICT use, demand for tasks, and employment \nby gender and skill group. Using data from Viet \nNam, which has one of the world\u2019s most inexpensive \nbroadband networks, recent research found that \ngreater ICT use increases the female share of \nemployment, benefiting in particular college-educated \nwomen (though gender disparities in education and \ntraining limit the benefit).\n\nChun and Tang (2018) used data on firms\u2019 use of \nICT from the Annual Enterprise Census of Viet\u00a0Nam, \n2005\u20132009. The study measured an industry\u2019s task \ncomplexity, evaluated by occupation.a Complex \nindustries are the most innovative in the economy, \nheavily relying on highly technical engineering skills, \nwhile less complex industries provide basic products \nand services. The study used the gradual liberalization \nof broadband internet across provinces from 2006 to \n2009 to construct an instrument to measure firms\u2019 \nICT use, controlled for region, industry, and year \nfixed\u00a0effects. The three main findings are as follows. \n\u2022\t Adopting ICT has a positive effect on a firm\u2019s \nfemale labor share. A 10% increase in the \nnumber of internet-connected computers per \nworker increases a firm\u2019s female labor share \nby 3 percentage points. The share increase is \n3.5 percentage points when computers are also \nconnected to a local area network (LAN). Compared \nwith firms not using ICT, a firm using a LAN has a \nhigher female labor share by 14 percentage points, \none using the internet by 15 percentage points, \nand one hosting a website by 30 percentage points. \nThese numbers support the observation that ICT \nuse increases relative demand for nonroutine \ninteractive tasks, raising the relative share of \nwomen employed.\n\n\u2022\t The positive effect is larger for the female share \nof skilled employment. ICT raises both the share \nof skilled college-educated workers and the share \nof women employed by a firm. A 10% increase in \nthe number of computers connected to the internet \nper worker increases the female share in college-\neducated employment in firms by 8 percentage \npoints, and connection to a LAN by 9 percentage \npoints. A firm\u2019s use of a LAN correlates with a \nhigher female labor share among the college-\neducated by 31 percentage points, use of the \ninternet by 46 percentage points, and hosting a \nwebsite by 69 percentage points. \n\n\u2022\t But the effect is weaker in more complex \n\nindustries. The interaction terms between ICT \nvariables and the sectoral measure of complexity \nhave negative coefficients, such that women benefit \nless from ICT in more complex sectors. In these \nsectors, men may have comparative advantage over \nwomen because a higher proportion of men train \nin highly technical skills. ICT may thus worsen \ngender inequality in industries more dependent on \ncomplex\u00a0tasks.\nThese results illustrate the potential that ICT has \n\nto generate growth in high-quality employment for \nwomen, compared with programs narrowly focused \non providing to women capital and training. The \nresults underscore the importance of addressing \ngender differences in education and training, toward \nimproving gender equality in the workplace. The study \nhighlights ICT as a force for female empowerment in \nlabor markets and the importance of acquiring the ICT \nskills necessary for the complex computerized and \ndigital tasks essential to innovative industries.\n\na  The study constructed an index on occupation complexity, \n\na measure of the need for complex problem-solving \nskills in each occupation, based on the US Department of \nLabor\u2019s Occupational Information Network.\n\nSource: Chun and Tang 2018.\n\nDecomposition by occupation shows technology, \nconsidered alone, reducing labor demand\nThree main forces affect employment in economies and \nindustries participating in GVCs. First is the location of a \nproduction task and its associated jobs. Second is the use of \ntechnology along the GVC, which may affect the number of \nworkers required to meet given demand, the direction of impact \non employment depending on whether new technologies replace \njobs or complement them. Third, GVC employment is in\ufb02uenced \nby conditions in the economy and globally, such as total demand \nfor goods and services and changes in consumer preferences.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)75\n\nStructural decomposition analysis (SDA) of the \n\nmultiregional input\u2013output tables achieves two objectives. \nFirst, it quanti\ufb01es changes in labor demand associated with \ntechnological change and task relocation. Second, it examines \nthe relative magnitude of these GVC-speci\ufb01c channels with \nrespect to conditions globally and within an economy. \n\nThe decomposition of change in an economy\u2019s number of \n\njobs from 2005 to 2015 occurs on two levels (Figure 2.2.4). \nAt\u00a0the \ufb01rst level, the change in employment is decomposed into \nchange within the GVC, or changes in employment within the \nproduction structure or GVC of a speci\ufb01c \ufb01nal product, and \nchange between GVCs, or changes in employment resulting \nfrom shifts in consumer demand for different products. \nIf,\u00a0for\u00a0example, consumers suddenly spend more on electronics \nthan garments, there will be greater demand for employment \nin the electronics production chain and less in the garments \nchain. Finally, income refers to changes in employment caused \nby changes in global demand for goods and services. In \npractice, higher income in real terms will increase demand for \ngoods and services, which in turn will increase employment.\nThe SDA further decomposes the within-GVC channel \ninto (i) technology within the GVC, or changes in employment \nassociated with changes in efficiency within a speci\ufb01c GVC; \n(ii)\u00a0task relocation, or changes in employment as the location \nchanges for one production task or more; and (iii) country-level \nefficiency, or changes in employment from efficiency changes in \nthe economy.7\n\nThe GVC for garments in the PRC is used to illustrate \n\nhow to operationalize technology within the GVC and \ntask relocation. If machines replace workers at one or \nmore of the production tasks in the GVC, this will lower \nthe number of jobs in the GVC needed to meet given \ndemand. This channel is labeled \u201ctechnology within GVCs.\u201d \nIf\u00a0PRC\u00a0garment manufacturers decide to relocate one or \nmore of the production tasks to Thailand, the jobs for \nthose tasks will be lost in the PRC and gained in Thailand. \n\n2.2.4\u2002Decomposing changes in labor demand\n\nTechnology\n\nOwn country\n\nTask relocation\n\nWithin GVC\n\nIncome\n\nChange\nin Employment\n\nRest of the world\n\nGVC = global value chain.\nSource: Based on Reijnders and de Vries (2017).\n\nBetween GVC\n\nFirst level\n\nSecond level\n\n\f76(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nAssuming\u00a0other\u00a0factors\u00a0are\u00a0constant\u2014for example, workers \nin the PRC and Thailand are equally productive\u2014the total \nnumber of jobs in the GVC is unchanged, but fewer workers \nare employed in the PRC and more in Thailand. This is task \nrelocation.\n\nThe use of the within-GVC technology channel to capture \n\nthe effects of industry-speci\ufb01c technological change on jobs \noperates along the lines of recent research that uses measures \nof labor productivity growth that vary across industries as \nan all-encompassing proxy for the effects of technological \nprogress (Autor and Salomons 2017). It bypasses the formidable \ndifficulty of examining the employment implications of \nspeci\ufb01c technological innovations. As noted in Autor and \nSalomons (2017), the diversity of speci\ufb01c innovations de\ufb01es \nboth consistent classi\ufb01cation and comprehensive measurement. \nIn\u00a0the model presented here, countrywide economic conditions, \nwhich would include the effects of improved economic \ninstitutions or rising educational attainment, are captured \nby country-level efficiency, while technology within the GVC \ntranscends national boundaries and captures technological \nadvances along a speci\ufb01c production chain.\n\nFinally, the second stage of the SDA further decomposes \nthe income channel into \u201cown country,\u201d or demand for goods \nand services originating within a speci\ufb01c country, and \u201crest \nof the world,\u201d or demand from abroad for goods and services. \nThe purpose is to see what fraction of employment depends on \ndomestic demand and what fraction foreign demand.\n\nThis analysis has two outliers. During 2005\u20132015, the \n\nglobal commodities bust hit hard in Mongolia, an economy \nheavily reliant on mining, causing a major decline in \nemployment in services. The second outlier is Sri Lanka, where \na 30-year civil war ended in 2009, followed by a period of \nrecord-breaking economic growth. Particularly affected were \nthe employment numbers for manufacturing. Therefore, they \nare not always presented in \ufb01gures (though these may be found \nin Bertulfo, Gentile, and de Vries, forthcoming[b]).\n\nFigure 2.2.5 presents the results of the SDA for employment \n\nin agriculture, manufacturing, and services. The results show \nthat, all other things being equal, technology improvements \nwithin GVCs accompany lower employment across all \nsectors. In the PRC, for example, the decrease in employment \nassociated with technology is 77% in agriculture, 68% in \nmanufacturing, and 44% in services. Notable exceptions are \nemployment in services in the Philippines and Viet Nam, \nwhere technological change within GVCs increases demand \nfor certain service occupations: information technology \nand business process outsourcing in the Philippines, and \ninformation technology services in Viet Nam.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)77\n\n2.2.5\u2002Structural decomposition analysis of changes in employment by sector, 2005\u20132015\n\nTechnology within a GVC\n\nCountry-level efficiency\n\nTask relocation\n\nIncome from own country\n\nIncome from the rest of the world\n\na.

Developing Asia in the decomposition analysis includes Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nthe Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Taipei,China, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\nSource: ADB estimates using the ADB Multiregional Input\u2013Output Database (accessed 20 November 2017); Labor force surveys, various countries; World Input\u2013Output \nDatabase\u2014Socioeconomic Accounts (Timmer et al. 2015).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f78(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nTask relocation is associated with changes in employment \nthat are much smaller and mixed. Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, \nand the PRC, which are well integrated into GVCs, experience \nnet increases in employment, while others experience net \ndecreases. This suggests that task relocation was not the main \ndriver of changes in employment during 2005\u20132015.\n\nRising incomes more than compensate for \nemployment demand suppressed by new technology\nThe last column of Figure 2.2.5 compares the magnitude of \nchanges in domestic employment associated with changes in \nincome from within the domestic economy and from the rest \nof the world. It is noteworthy that domestic income effects are \ngenerally much larger than those from the rest of the world. \nIn\u00a0the PRC, for example, the increase in employment associated \nwith own-country income is 83% in agriculture, 68% in \nmanufacturing, and a staggering 105% in services, as\u00a0opposed \nto 6%, 15%, and 8% associated with income from the rest \nof the world. This is an encouraging sign of newly rising \nconsumers in developing Asia, now able to generate domestic \ndemand for products and services. Moreover, the \ufb01gure shows \nthat increases in employment associated with both sources \nof income are large enough to offset the combined decrease \nin employment from changes to technology in the GVC and \nefficiency in the economy (Box 2.2.4). In fact, in developing \nAsia, the combined impact of efficiency gains at the country \nlevel and technological advances within the GVC, holding all \nother components constant, is a 66% decrease in labor demand, \nequal to 101 million jobs per annum. However, concurrently \nhigher demand for goods and services more than offsets this \nwith an 88% increase in labor demand, equal to 134 million \njobs per annum.\n\n2.2.4\u2002Rising income offsetting employment losses from technology\n\nThe world has witnessed three major technological \nrevolutions, each reducing the labor required to \nproduce a given output. It has not, however, witnessed \nany increase in structural unemployment. This implies \nthe existence of channels that counterbalance the \nnegative impact technology has on employment. \nResearchers have in fact identified various such \nchannels, most of which expand aggregate demand, \nas described by Bessen (2017), for example, in the \nprevious section. Technological innovation generally \nreduces the prices of goods and raises income \nper\u00a0capita. Both effects push up demand, which can \noutweigh the direct negative impact of technology \non\u00a0employment.\n\nConsider India, which has a large population with \nincome per capita growing at a healthy rate. In 2015, \nincome per capita was about $1,600 annually, and the \nIndian apparel market was estimated at $59\u00a0billion. \nIf the economy grows at 7% annually over the next \n16\u00a0years, annual income per capita will rise to $2,800 \nin 2021 and $4,900 in 2031. The apparel market can be \nexpected to expand in response. Using 0.8 for income \nelasticity, it is expected to reach $93 billion in 2022 \nand $149 billion in 2032. This increase of output by \n2.5 times over the next 16 years can be expected to \ncounter job displacement from future automation in \nthe garment industry.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)79\n\nRoutine occupations are more at risk than others\nOf major interest is which occupations are more vulnerable to \ndisplacement by technology. The taxonomy developed in Autor, Levy, \nand Murnane (2003), which classi\ufb01es occupations as routine manual, \nroutine cognitive, nonroutine manual, and nonroutine cognitive, \nallows for an SDA of changes in employment by occupation type. \nUnfortunately, this exercise is not possible for agricultural employment \nbecause it is difficult to distinguish routine and nonroutine occupations \nin the sector.\n\nThe results of the SDA by occupation type are presented in \n\nFigure\u00a02.2.6 for manufacturing and services. The trends are the same \nas in Figure 2.2.5, but changes in employment are distributed across \noccupation types. It can be observed on the left that technology \nchange within a GVC correlates with lower employment across \ncountries and occupation types in both manufacturing and services. \nHowever, the decrease in nonroutine employment, especially \nnonroutine cognitive employment, is less pronounced than for routine \nemployment. Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet\u00a0Nam even show an \nincrease in nonroutine employment in services. The \ufb01ndings suggest \nthat technological advances along the supply chain may have been \nskill-biased in 2005\u20132015. This should not be surprising, as modern \nmachine tools and ICT have been used in production for some time.\n\nIt can be observed on the right that task relocation in \nmanufacturing appears to have a positive effect on nonroutine \nemployment as well. In India, Indonesia, and the PRC, task relocation \nis associated with increases in nonroutine occupations, both cognitive \nand manual (Box 2.2.5). Bangladesh and Thailand show increases \nin nonroutine manual occupations, and Malaysia shows an increase \nin\u00a0nonroutine cognitive occupations. In\u00a0services (excluding outliers in \nthe Philippines and Viet Nam), changes in employment are generally \nvery small and mixed.\n\nNew technology pushing up the share of nonroutine jobs\nThe analysis above quanti\ufb01es the prevalence of routine and nonroutine \nemployment. In Figure 2.2.7, the focus shifts to employment shares. \nIn general, the magnitude of the change in employment share for \nmanufacturing is smaller and more uniform than for services, which \nhave more diverse dynamics. An\u00a0increased employment share of \nnonroutine cognitive occupations accompanies technological advances \nwithin the GVC (Figure 2.2.7a). For\u00a0nonroutine manual occupations, \nroughly half the economies show increased employment share, the \nrest decreased. Finally, the change in employment share for both \nroutine cognitive and routine manual occupations associated with \nnew technology is decidedly negative for manufacturing and mainly \nnegative for services. These results follow from Figure 2.2.6, which \nshows that, although the impact of technological advances is generally \na reduction in both routine and nonroutine jobs (conditional on their \nsatisfying the same demand), it is larger for routine jobs. The impact \nof task relocation is relatively small and mixed.\n\n\f80(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.2.6\u2002Structural decomposition analysis of changes in employment by sector and occupation type, 2005\u20132015\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nNonroutine manual\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nRoutine manual\n\nTechnology within GVC\n\nTask relocation\n\na.

Occupation \ndata in each industry and economy are used to \ncharacterize occupations by their index of routine \ntask intensity (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003). \nOccupations with scores above average on routine task \nintensity are considered routine. Other occupations are \nnot considered routine task intensive.\n\nThe left panel of box figure 1 shows routine and \nnonroutine jobs in the PRC involved in the production \nof electronic products finalized in the PRC. The \nfindings suggest that increased demand for final PRC \nelectronic products increased PRC jobs numbers from \n15 million in 2000 to 38 million in 2015. Demand for \nroutine jobs doubled, but demand for nonroutine jobs \nincreased almost threefold. Estimated demand for jobs \nincludes jobs both directly and indirectly involved in \nthe production of electronics finalized in the PRC. \n\nForeign workers\nPRC, nonroutine workers\nPRC, routine workers\n\nForeign workers\nPRC, indirect effect on job demand\nPRC, direct effect on job demand\n\nAs\u00a0intermediate inputs needed to produce electronics \nrequire their own intermediate inputs (for example, \nhard disks requiring electric circuits), indirect labor \neffects can be substantial. The right panel explicitly \nindicates indirect employment effects.\n\nBox figure 2 shows jobs involved in the production \n\nof textiles finalized in the PRC, with several notable \nsimilarities to box\u00a0figure 1 and several differences. \nFirst, the number of jobs involved in the production \nof textiles finalized in the PRC was comparable to \nelectronics in 2015. However, the increase in job \nnumbers was much faster in electronics than in \ntextiles. Second, the share of routine workers involved \nin the production of textiles is higher than for \nelectronics\u2014in 2015 about 75% in textiles compared \nwith 49% in electronics. Third, indirect employment \neffects from textiles are substantially smaller than \nfrom electronics, the ratio of indirect to direct demand \nfor jobs being about 2 for textiles but almost 3 for \nelectronics in 2015. These differences suggest that \nindustry specialization affects demand for routine \nversus nonroutine\u00a0jobs.

They fear, in other words, that it could become \neconomically feasible to move those production tasks back to the \nhome market. In an SDA, reshoring would appear as a sizeable \ndecrease in labor demand from task relocation. Indeed, that \nreshoring did not happen in 2005\u20132015 does not mean it will not \nhappen in the near future.\n\nTo determine how dependent employment in developing Asia is \n\non \ufb01nal demand from advanced economies, the approach adopted \nin Los, Timmer, and de Vries (2015) is used. Figure\u00a02.2.8 shows the \nshare as well as the total number of jobs servicing \ufb01nal demand in \n2015 decomposed into domestic \ufb01nal demand, \ufb01nal demand from \nadvanced economies, and \ufb01nal demand from the rest of the world. \nFigure 2.2.8 shows that 82% of employment in the 12 Asian \neconomies depends on domestic \ufb01nal demand, which demonstrates \nrebalancing away from a growth model led by manufacturing \nfor export to growth led by services and domestic consumption. \nHowever, variation across countries has domestic demand in \nTaipei,China a low 53% and in Viet Nam at 55%, and much higher in \nBangladesh at 88% and India at 87%.\n\nAbout 10% of jobs in the 12 Asian economies service \ufb01nal \n\ndemand from advanced economies. Taipei,China and Viet Nam are \nrelatively vulnerable to reshoring because they have the highest \nshare of jobs dependent on \ufb01nal demand from advanced economies, \nat 25% for Taipei,China and 26% for Vietnam. However, bearing in \nmind that reshoring aims to move production closer to customers \nand thereby shorten the time required to get a product to market, \nlower production costs, and improve efficiency, it is noteworthy that \nconsumer markets in advanced economies are increasingly saturated, \neven as demand from Asia\u2019s expanding middle class increases. \nFigure\u00a02.2.8 shows that, while the share of jobs servicing \ufb01nal \ndemand from the rest of the world is only 7% in the 12 economies as \na whole, it is well over 20% in Malaysia; Taipei,China; and Thailand. \nMarkets in the rest of the world have a high potential for growth \nas well, such that the importance of \ufb01nal demand from advanced \ncountries to employment in developing countries will likely decline \nover time.\n\nEmergence of new occupations  \nand new industries\nOne of the less-appreciated channels through which technology \naffects the labor market is its creation of new occupations and \nentirely new industries with new jobs. Indeed, from 1980 to 2007, \nnew tasks and job titles and their expansion explained about \nhalf of US employment growth (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017b). \nCarefully examining growth in occupation titles is one way, however \nimperfect, to predict which new occupations and industries will \nemerge in the future. \n\n\f84(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.2.8\u2002Job shares servicing foreign and domestic demand, 2015\n\nDomestic \ufb01nal demand\nFinal demand from the rest of the world\nFinal demand from advanced economies\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n 4,696 \n\n 2,645\n\n 40,282  \n\n 26,146  \n\n 12,974  \n\n 10,898  \n\n 57  \n\n 176  \n\n 3,117  \n\n 2,757  \n\n 82,167  \n\n 54,077  \n\n 766  \n\n 616  \n\n 6,878  \n\n 2,737  \n\n172,974\n\n 13,532  \n\n125,530\n\n 2,178  \n\n 3,355  \n\n 8,370  \n\n8,273\n\n 2,535  \n\n 10,129\n\n 24,172  \n\n 28,972\n\n 5,913  \n\n 3,591  \n\n 3,922  \n\n 18,364  \n\nRepublic\nof Korea\n\n 51,567\n\n 435,693  \n\n 98,826  \n\n 918  \n\n 33,681  \n\n 689,013  \n\n 6,437  \n\n \n \n 1,401,927\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia Malaysia Mongolia Philippines\n\nPRC\n\nSri Lanka Taipei,China Thailand\n\nViet Nam Developing\n\nAsia\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: The advanced economies are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the \nNetherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In nearly all \neconomies considered, occupations categorized as professional \nor in services and sales increased (Figure 2.2.9). These two \ntypes of occupations are both nonroutine. But professional \nwork is classi\ufb01ed as cognitive while services and sales are \nclassi\ufb01ed as manual. Across developing Asia, then, nonroutine \njobs have increased both in manual and cognitive tasks. On the \nother hand, the importance of skilled workers in agriculture \nand related sectors has declined.\n\nA more systematic analysis can track the emergence of new \noccupations by comparing various waves of a country\u2019s national \nclassi\ufb01cations of occupations (NCO).

Lin (2011), for instance, used \u201cnew work,\u201d \nor jobs requiring new combinations of activities (the phrase \nborrowed from Jacobs [1969]), to observe how US workers and \n\ufb01rms adapt to technological change. Successive versions of the \nUS Index of Occupations were compared to identify new job titles \nand match them with microdata to estimate worker selection into \nnew occupations. Following this approach, the emergence of new \noccupations can be investigated for several economies in developing \nAsia that have the necessary data (Box 2.2.6). \n\nAnalysis of NCO lists \ufb01nds the emergence of 60 new job \ntitles out of 2,945 (2.0%) in India in 1968\u20132004, 120 out of 3,600 \n(3.3%) in India in 2004\u20132015, 28 out of 2,338 (1.2%) in Malaysia \nin 1998\u20132008, and 42\u00a0out of 3,698 (1.14%) in the Philippines in \n1990\u20132012. As in Lin\u00a0(2011), most new job titles, 43%\u201357%, are \nrelated to ICT. Moreover, as seen from Figure\u00a02.2.10, occupations \nwith the highest\u00a0proportions of new job titles are mainly \nnonroutine\u00a0cognitive. Nearly\u00a040% of job titles under ICT operations \nand user-support technicians in India were created from 2004 \nto\u00a02015, and more than 20% in Malaysia from 1998 to 2008. \n\nNew job titles are mostly in \nnonroutine cognitive occupations \nIn all countries studied, new job titles appear primarily in \nprofessional categories (Figure 2.2.11). India presents a particularly \ninteresting case. The 1968\u20132004 \ufb01gure shows 93% of all new jobs \nas professionals, with 36 new job titles, and associate professionals, \nwith 20. A closer look into these two groups reveals that several of \nthe new job titles are mainly engineering and data analyst positions \nand directly related to the use of personal computers, re\ufb02ecting \n\n\f86(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.2.6\u2002Estimating the emergence of new occupations\n\nAs a first step in tracing the emergence of new jobs, \nan economy\u2019s national classification of occupations \n(NCO) is compared with its preceding version at the \nmost disaggregated level available using an official \nconcordance between the two classifications. Job \ntitles are then identified in the newer NCO that did \nnot exist in the previous one, while controlling for \nany form of relabeling or reclassification. It is also \nimportant to check which International Standard \nClassification of Occupations the NCO editions are \npatterned after for two reasons: First, one can identify \nwhich technological advances were made during the \ntime studied. Second, one gains insight on what types \nof new job titles may emerge. \n\nAs a second filter and robustness check, the \n\nremaining job titles are further compared with the US \nIndex of Occupations. The US Index of Occupations \nprovides occupational titles down to the smallest \nunit, which means a large number of occupational \ntitles are included. To illustrate, the number of titles \nlisted ranged in 1950\u20132000 from 25,000 to 31,000 (Lin \n2011). The 1950 index lists over 80 titles that contain \n\u201cengineer\u201d and includes over 10 types of economists \nwith different specializations and functions. The index \nversion used should account for a lag in the emergence \nof job titles given different stages of development \nbetween the country studied and the US. This exercise \ntherefore assumes that job titles in the country at time \nt is equivalent to the job titles in the US at time t\u2013n. \nFor example, the comparison of India\u2019s new job titles \nin NCO 2004 with its previous version in 1968 is cross-\nchecked against the new job titles with the 1950 US \n\nIndex of Occupations (US at time t\u2013n) in the second \nfiltration process. The assumption here is that job titles \nin India in 1968 are equivalent to job titles in the US in \n1950. If the job title in NCO 2004 did not exist in the \n1950 US Index of Occupations, it is considered new.\nOther indicators of new jobs are used. In some \n\ncases, job titles specifying a type of technology \nnot widely used in the previous NCO year are \ncategorized as new. This involves investigating when \nthe technology penetrated the market.a For example, \nmanagerial positions are generally categorized as old \njob titles unless the specification entails a new type \nof technology. Job titles listed as \u201cothers,\u201d or \u201cnot \nelsewhere classified\u201d but are newly added to the later \nlist are not considered new. \n\nAmong the limitations to the technique are \nmeasurement error from checking occupation \ntitles manually, the subjective judgment whether a \ntechnology was widely used in the previous NCO year, \nand the use of the US Index of Occupations as proxy \nfor an economy\u2019s list of occupations in the previous \nversion. The exercise nevertheless provides insight into \nthe link between the emergence of new types of jobs \nand new technology in developing Asia. A\u00a0potential \nextension of this analysis is to use microdata to check \nhow many individuals in the labor force were actually \nemployed under these new job titles (Lin 2011).\n\na  A job title using a technology introduced in 1967 may \n\nstill be categorized as new if the technology was still not \nwidely used in 1968.\n\nSource: Flaminiano et al., forthcoming.\n\n2.2.10\u2002Occupations with the highest proportion of new job titles, selected Asian economies\n\nICT operations and user support technician\n\nArchitect, planner, surveyor, and designer\n\nSoftware and application developer, and analyst\n\nLife science technician and related associate professional\n\nMedical and pharmaceutical technician\n\nSales, marketing, and public relations professional\n\nElectronics and telecommunication installer and repairer\n\nElectrotechnology engineer\n\nParamedical practitioner\n\nDatabase and network professional\n\nOther health associate professional\n\nMalaysia 2008\nPhilippines 2012\nIndia 2015\n\n0\n\n10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n20\n\n%\n\nICT = information and communication technology.\nNote: These are occupation groups with the highest proportion of new job titles.

Once again, this \nresembles \ufb01ndings in Lin (2011) in the US in 1977. By contrast, none \nof the occupation groups clerks, service and sales workers, and \nelementary occupations show new job titles, despite employment \ngrowing in these occupations. In fact, all three economies show \ngrowth in routine cognitive and nonroutine manual employment. \nFor example, in 2004\u20132015 in India, a third broad occupation \ngroup\u2014craft and related trade workers, speci\ufb01cally electrical \ntrade workers, categorized as routine cognitive jobs\u2014hold a \nsigni\ufb01cant share of new job titles. Interestingly, the majority of the \nnew job titles in this occupation group are computer numerical \ncontrol technicians, who are machinists whose jobs entail \noperating computer-driven machine tools. Examples of job titles \nare computerized numerical control (CNC) operator machining \ntechnician, CNC setter-cum-operator\u2013vertical machining center, \nCNC programmer, CNC operator\u2013turning. Other new job titles in \nthis occupation group include smartphone repair technician, solar \npanel installation technician, and optical \ufb01ber technician. \n\nTechnological progress and economic growth \nalso\u00a0creating jobs \nThe growing complexity of life and the modern workplace\u2014\nthe result of technological change and economic growth\u2014will \ncontribute new occupations. A comparison of occupations in \nthe region with those in advanced economies shows great scope \nfor job growth in many sectors. For example, health care and \neducation provide 15% of employment in the US, while \ufb01nance, \n\n\f88(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\ninsurance, real estate, and other business services provide 19%. \nIn lower- and middle-income economies in developing Asia, \nhealth care and education provide only 3.5%\u20136.0% of jobs, and \nbusiness services 1.5%\u20136.0%, suggesting considerable scope \nfor job growth in these services. Similarly, urban parts of \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia show much greater variety of occupations than \nrural parts. As the region urbanizes, many jobs will emerge.\n\nFurther, technology will transform some existing \noccupations. A case in point is informal retail, perhaps the \nmost ubiquitous occupation. In many parts of developing Asia, \ninformal retailers are increasingly using social media platforms \nto reach many more customers than before (Box 2.2.7). \n\n2.2.7\u2002Informal retail transforming into social commerce\n\nDespite rapid growth in internet use, e-commerce \nin Southeast Asia remains in its infancy for lack of \nwell-developed digital finance or logistics (Chadha \n2016). In Southeast and South Asia, less than a third \nof companies have their own websites, and only \nabout half use e-mail to communicate with clients \nand suppliers (ADB 2017b). However, despite small \ne-commerce markets, developing economies lead the \nworld in social commerce, or unofficial e-commerce \nusing social media. \n\nSocial commerce is characterized by online sales \n\nand offline payments. It begins on a social media \nplatform, followed by direct communication between \nbuyer and seller, usually using instant messaging apps, \nand closes using offline payment (Malabuppha 2017). \nCash on delivery is widely used (International Trade \nCenter 2017). The popularity of social media turns \nthese venues into cheaper e-commerce platforms than \ntraditional e-commerce.

Analysis of \nIndia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam shows the \nemployment structure in the region shifting toward jobs intensive in \nnonroutine cognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks. These\u00a0tasks \ngenerally complement technological progress and may\u00a0not be readily \nautomated. They tend to require more education and/or relatively \nadvanced training. At the same time, the labor market is moving \naway from jobs intensive in manual tasks, which tend to require \nskills that workers with basic education can acquire. Such\u00a0jobs are \nmore likely to be replaced by machines. The magnitude of these \nchanges in the past decade or so is sizable, and the trend will \nlikely persist. The major challenge for Asian economies is to cope \nwith this structural transformation in the nature of jobs. If\u00a0Asia\u2019s \nworkers are not given the skills in demand\u2014particularly to \ufb01ll jobs \nintensive in nonroutine and cognitive tasks\u2014they may be left behind. \nIncomes\u00a0for the few with the required skills will rise, exacerbating \ninequality.\n\nTrends in employment and wages  \nby task intensity in the region\nFive indicators here describe the intensity with which workers are \nrequired to perform various types of tasks. Four of them pertain \nto nonroutine cognitive, social interactive, routine cognitive, and \nmanual tasks.8 A \ufb01fth indicator, for ICT tasks, describes computer \nuse at work to capture jobs intensive in tasks that may directly \ncomplement new technologies. The\u00a0methodology used to construct \nthese indicators is presented in Box 2.3.1. Task\u00a0intensity can be \nmeasured, making it possible to examine the task-biased technical \nchange hypothesis: Technological progress and information \ntechnology (IT) will likely displace jobs consisting of mainly routine \nand manual tasks while increasing demand for jobs that involve \na lot of abstract and complex cognitive tasks. Occupations and \nindustries in which workers are frequently required to provide \nadvice, teach, or negotiate, among other tasks, score high in \nsocial interaction, while high scores in the complex or nonroutine \ncognitive indicator indicate high intensity in tasks such as writing, \nusing advanced mathematics, or solving complex problems. \n\n\f90(cid:14)(cid:14)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.3.1\u2002Constructing task intensity indicators\n\nConstructing a set of indicators that account for \ntask intensity by occupation and industry requires \nan appropriate methodology. The indicators are \nconstructed using publicly available country surveys \nconducted in the 27 OECD member and partner \ncountries (OECD 2013a, 2016a).\n\nBesides background information on education, \nindustry, occupation, sex, and age, the surveys gather \ninformation from workers on the requirements of \ntheir jobs. Requirements include cognitive skills that \nencompass reading, writing, mathematics, and the \nuse of information and communication technology \n(ICT). Questions extend to interaction and social skills, \ncovering collaboration and cooperation, planning, \ntime use for oneself and others, communication, and \nnegotiation. Subjects are asked about physical motor \nskills, both gross and fine. In addition, they are asked \nabout the frequency and intensity of various tasks \ntheir jobs require. There are more than 50 questions \non job\u00a0requirements in the survey. Most questions \nare coded on a scale from 1 to 5, with greater values \nindicating greater frequency and/or intensity of the \ntask required at work. Following previous studies \non the polarization of employment and given the \ninformation provided in Program for the International \nAssessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) surveys, \nthe tasks are grouped into five categories (box table).\n\nStep 1. Assigning survey questions to categories\nFirst, questions in the PIAAC survey providing \ninformation pertaining to the five task categories were \nidentified. Principal component analysis determined \nthe extent to which questions from the survey \nconveyed similar information and was used to compute \na summary indicator for each category.\n\nCategories of tasks within occupations and industries\n\nStep 2.  Constructing indicators by occupation and \n\nindustry cell\n\nTo account for diverging stages of development in \ncountries in the PIAAC survey, and to ensure robust \nindicators of country-specific characteristics, the \nfinal indicators were obtained from regressions that \ncontrolled for country fixed effects. For each of the \nfive task categories, workers\u2019 summary indicator \nof intensity (cat) was regressed on a set of dummy \nvariables accounting for the worker occupation and \nindustry (occ_ind) and a set of country dummies (c) \nas\u00a0follows:\n\ncat\n\ni\n\n\u03b1\n= +\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03b3\nj\n\nj\n\nocc ind\n_\n\nij\n\n+\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\u03b4\n\nc\nk ik\n\n+\n\n\u03b5\ni\n\n \n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i denotes workers, j the occupation-industry \ncombinations, and k countries. The coefficients on \nthe occupation-industry dummies (\u03b3) can be thought \nof as a rank that measures the task intensity of an \noccupation-industry combination after controlling \nfor country-specific characteristics. The industries \nand occupations covered are based on 1-digit ISIC \nRev.\u00a04 classification and 2-digit ISCO-08 classification, \nrespectively. To reduce distortion from changes in \nnational classifications in the region over time, as \nwell as those arising from the harmonization with \ninternational classification standards, steps 1 and\u00a02 \nwere also conducted using the 2-digit ISCO-88 \nclassification for\u00a0occupations.\n\nCategory\n\nInterpretation \n\nExamples of speci\ufb01c tasks \n\n1.\u2002 Social interaction \nand\u00a0influencing\n\nFrequency of nonroutine \ninteractive tasks \n\n2.\u2002 Cognitive  \nnonroutine\n\nFrequency of nonroutine \ncognitive tasks \n\nInfluencing and advising other people, teaching, giving speeches or \npresentations, negotiating with people inside and outside of firm, planning \nthe activities of\u00a0others\n\nWriting letters, emails, or articles in newspapers, magazines, or newsletters; \npreparing charts, graphs, or tables; using advanced math or statistics \nsuch\u00a0as complex algebra, trigonometry, or regression analysis; solving \ncomplex problems\n\n3.\u2002 Cognitive routine\n\nFrequency of routine \ncognitive\u00a0tasks\n\nCalculating prices, costs, or budgets; using or calculating fractions, \ndecimals, or percentages; using a calculator or spreadsheet software\n\n4.\u2002Manual\n\nFrequency of manual tasks\n\nRelying on hand or finger dexterity (methodology and data do not allow \nmanual tasks to be disaggregated into routine and nonroutine)\n\n5.\u2002ICT\n\nUse of ICT at work\n\nRanging from no ICT use to performing complex tasks such as programming\n\nICT = information and communication technology.\n\ncontinued next page\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:14)(cid:14)91\n\n2.3.1\u2002Continued\n\nStep 3.  Merging task intensity indicators with \n\nAsian\u00a0labor force surveys\n\nInformation was gathered on employment and wages \nin India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and \nViet Nam using country labor force surveys at two \npoints in time. The time frames vary across countries, \nwith Viet Nam the shortest (2007\u20132015), followed \nby Thailand (2000\u20132010), India (2000\u20132012), the \nPhilippines (2001\u20132013), and Indonesia (2000\u20132014). \nThe indicators obtained in step 2 were merged with \ncountry data based on worker occupation and industry.\n\nStep 4.  Constructing employment and wage trends \n\nfor high- and low-intensive tasks \n\nFor each country and task category, the employment-\nweighted mean of the intensity indicator at the \nbeginning of the sample was calculated separately for \nwage employees and all workers (i.e., wage employees \nand the self-employed). Occupations and industries \nwhose task intensity fell below the weighted mean \nwere classified as low and those above the mean as \nhigh. Changes in employment and wages in high-\nintensive occupations and industries were compared \nwith low-intensive ones.\n\nStep 5.  Comparing the distribution of employment \nby intensity of tasks across countries\n\nIn the previous step, the country\u2019s weighted mean \nwas used as a threshold to classify occupations and \nindustries into low- and high-intensive. For illustrating \ntrends over time within countries, this is the preferred \nthreshold because it best describes employment and \nwage trends representative of the mean worker in \neach country. However, this country-specific threshold \ncannot be used when comparing employment \ndistribution by task intensity across countries. As such, \nfor comparison with OECD countries and across Asian \neconomies, the simple average for each type of task \nwas used as a threshold. For example, occupations and \nindustries whose ICT intensity is above the simple \nmean of the ICT indicator are classified as high and \nthose below as low.\n\nSource: Khatiwada, Lennon, and Zilian, forthcoming.\n\nThese\u00a0two\u00a0indicators\u00a0are\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0characterize\u00a0jobs intensive \nin nonroutine tasks. To describe jobs intensive in routine \ncognitive tasks, information is obtained on the frequency \nwith which workers are required to use simple arithmetic, \nfor\u00a0example, in calculating prices and costs. Jobs that require \na lot of use of hands or \ufb01ngers are considered intensive in \nmanual tasks. Finally, information on ICT use provides the \nbasis for determining the intensity of ICT tasks of jobs. \nWith\u00a0these indicators, jobs in the economies considered can \nbe classi\ufb01ed in terms of whether they are high-intensive \nor low-intensive with respective to the \ufb01ve task categories. \nThese\u00a0classi\ufb01cations are used to reveal employment and wage \ntrends over time. \n\nFor both wage employees and all workers, jobs that are \nintensive in cognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks have \nexpanded faster than jobs that are less intensive (Figure 2.3.1a). \nIn fact, in some countries\u2014Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet\u00a0Nam, \nfor example\u2014jobs less intensive in these categories have \ncontracted. The only exception is the Philippines, where jobs \nintensive in nonroutine cognitive tasks expanded at a slower \npace than their\u00a0counterparts. This coincided with growth in \nemployment in other categories, including jobs intensive in \nroutine cognitive tasks, a category that includes many types of \njobs in IT-business process outsourcing\u2014the call center jobs \n\n\f92(cid:14)(cid:14)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nthat provided much of the growth of employment in the\u00a0sector, \nwhich expanded from less than 100,000 jobs in 2004 to \nalmost 1 million in 2013. However, this may change as this \nlarge industry shifts toward more nonroutine cognitive tasks \n(Box\u00a02.3.2). \n\nThe opposite occurred for jobs intensive in manual tasks. \nLow-intensive manual jobs expanded faster than high-intensive \nones. Moreover, employment in high-intensive manual jobs has \ncontracted in Indonesia, Thailand, and, to a lesser extent, India. \n\n2.3.1\u2002Annual employment growth by task intensity\n\na.

Estimates give the Philippines 13% of global BPO \nmarket share. \n\nIn 2013, BPO provided 20% of Philippine \n\nexports, 6% of GDP, and 4.2% of wage employment.a \nMore\u00a0recent industry estimates from 2016 put \nIT-BPO revenue at $22.9 billion, equal to 7.5% of GDP. \nWith\u00a0formal job creation low in the Philippines, BPO \nis an attractive option for young graduates. Clerical \nsupport dominates BPO jobs, and education and skills \nrequirements vary across the industry. A 2016 labor \nforce survey shows 62% of IT-BPO jobs in clerical \nsupport. Nearly 85% of call center workers are either \ncollege students or high school graduates, while \nonly 13% have earned college degrees. By contrast, \nanimation BPOs, which require more technical or \nadvanced skills, fill 72% of their entry positions with \ncollege graduates. Similarly, college graduates fill \n68% of entry positions in medical transcription and \n55% in computer-related activities such as software \ndevelopment.\n\nService delivery automation, in particular robotic \nprocess automation, will transform BPO, affecting job \ncreation. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, \nbig data analytics, and cloud computing will alter the \ntype of workers employed, the wages they earn, and \nthe services they deliver to overseas clients. However, \neven the most pessimistic projections of employment \ngrowth show steady increases in IT-BPO job creation \nin the Philippines. As industry leaders reported at the \n\nIT-Business Process Management Summit in Manila in \nNovember 2017, demand from North America, Europe, \nand Australia will continue to fuel employment growth \nin the industry, as will demand from within Asia and \nthe Pacific as these economies get richer.\n\nThe Information Technology and Business Process \n\nAssociation of the Philippines says the share of low-\nskilled BPO workers will decline from 47% in 2016 to \n27% in 2022. Medium-skill occupations will increase \nfrom 38% to 46% in 2016, and high-skill occupations \nfrom 15% to 46% (box figure).\n\nOne of the proposals presented by IT-BPO \n\nleaders is a skills-development fund to train IT-BPO \nworkers in new technology and familiarize them \nwith automated service-delivery models. Industry \nleaders believe the government should contribute to \nthe fund to provide incentives for firms to upskill and \nreskill. Further, as most BPO workers are university \nstudents or graduates, industry leaders believe that \neducational\u00a0streams must better align with industry \nneeds. Given\u00a0growth in computer-related BPO, it is \nimperative that university education in computer and \nIT-related majors align with industry needs.\n\na  This is from official statistics provided by Bangko Sentral \n\nng Pilipinas and the Philippine Statistics Authority. \nReference years for data vary depending on information \nsource. From these two sources, the most recent year \nis\u00a02013. When data are from labor force surveys, or official \nsources on labor market data, the latest is 2016.

The growth \ndifference between jobs with high and low task intensity means \nthat employment is shifting toward occupations and industries \nrequiring high cognitive, social, and ICT task intensity. This is \nconsistent with relatively slow growth in demand for manual \nwork and for work not intensive in the use of congnitive, social, \nand ICT skills. \n\nIn some countries, the shift in employment across job \ntypes has been substantial. From 2000 to 2014, more than \n25% of Indonesian workers shifted into jobs intensive in social \ninteraction, 20% migrated to high-intensive jobs in nonroutine \ncognitive tasks, and 17% moved away from high-intensive \nmanual jobs. Similarly in Thailand, 18% of those employed \nshifted into high-intensive ICT jobs within just 10 years. \n\nTo properly compare the speed of these changes across \n\neconomies, the growth rate of the share of jobs with high \nintensity across task types is annualized, which is much like \ncomparing employment growth in these jobs with growth in \ntotal employment (Figure 2.3.2). The speed of change varies \nby the type of task and worker. The categories nonroutine \ncognitive, social interaction, and ICT show that changes are \noccurring faster in higher-income Asian economies considered \nhere. Thailand stands out when both wage and self-employed \nworkers are considered, for example, and Indonesia for wage \nworkers alone. In particular, Thai growth in employment in \nhigh-intensive jobs in these three categories has outpaced \nthat of total employment by 4.7 percentage points on average. \nLess\u00a0dramatic shifts have occurred in the Philippines and \nViet\u00a0Nam. However, the mean speed of change is considerable. \nEach\u00a0year, growth in Asian employment in jobs intensive in \nICT, social interaction, and nonroutine cognitive tasks is on \naverage 2.6 percentage points faster than overall employment. \n\nHow have wages evolved across job types? This information \n\nis presented in Figure 2.3.3 using average wages in constant \nlocal currency. In most countries, wage gains were larger \nfor jobs intensive in cognitive, social interaction, and ICT \ntasks than for those less intensive. By contrast, jobs intensive \nin manual tasks experienced lower increases in wages. \nThis\u00a0pattern is particularly pronounced in economies with \nrelatively large shifts in employment from low- to high-\nintensive cognitive, social interaction, and ICT jobs and \nfrom high- to low-intensive manual jobs, like Indonesia and \nThailand. The Philippines is an outlier, as the trends in average \nwages are reversed there, except for nonroutine cognitive tasks. \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:14)(cid:14)95\n\n2.3.2\u2002 Deviation of high-intensive job growth  \n\n2.3.3\u2002Change in average wages by task intensity\n\nfrom all employment growth \n\nAll workers\nWage workers\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nSocial interaction\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nICT\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nManual\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nHigh\nLow\n\nIndia\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nSocial interaction\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nICT\n\nManual\n\nIndonesia\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nSocial interaction\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nICT\n\nManual\n\nPhilippines\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nSocial interaction\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nICT\n\nManual\n\nThailand\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nSocial interaction\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nICT\n\nManual\n\nViet Nam\n\nNonroutine cognitive\n\nSocial interaction\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nICT\n\nManual\n\n0\n\n1,000\n\n2,000\n\n3,000\n\n4,000\n\n5,000\n\n\u20b9\n\nB\n\n0\n\n100\n\n300\n\n400\n\n200\n\nRp'000\n\n\u2013600\n\n\u2013400\n\n0\n\n200\n\n\u2013200\n\n\u20b1\n\n0\n\n1,000\n\n2,000\n\n3,000\n\n4,000\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\nPercentage points\n\n4\n\n \n\nICT = information and communication technology.\nNote: Developing Asia here comprises \ufb01ve economies: India, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

Further, jobs intensive in nonroutine and ICT \ntasks see faster growth in wages than do jobs intensive in \nmanual tasks. Interesting differences surface between wages \nin newly created occupations and existing ones (Box 2.3.3). \nEmployment and wage trends strongly suggest that demand \nis rising for jobs intensive in nonroutine cognitive, social \ninteraction, and ICT tasks relative to demand for manual \nintensive jobs. \n\nFindings for routine cognitive jobs are perhaps the \nmost surprising in view of the task-biased technical change \nhypothesis. Rather than contracting as predicted by the \nhypothesis, demand for routine cognitive jobs is still expanding \nin the region. One of the reasons behind this continuing \nexpansion may be that these jobs occupy a smaller share of \nemployment in developing Asia than in the developed world. \nFurther, new technology has opened opportunities for workers \nthat are outside of formal employment. Indeed, even among \nthe low-paid and low-skill workers in the informal economy, \nthere are examples where digital technology in particular has \nallowed productivity and wages to rise in Asia (Box 2.3.4). \n\n2.3.3\u2002Wage differentials between new and old occupations \n\nStudies have shown that new occupations, particularly \nin new technology industries, tend to pay better than \nexisting ones. Matching identified new job titles with \nmicrodata to estimate worker selection into new \noccupations in the US, Lin (2011) found that better-\neducated workers are likely to be found in newly \ncreated jobs and that these workers earn higher \nwages than similar workers in older jobs. Wage data \nby occupation title in Asia was used to study the \ndifference in wages between new and old work.\n\nA survey of business process outsourcing conducted \n\nin the Philippines in 2013 found a wage differential \nin favor of software developers (Bangko Sentral \nng Pilipinas 2013). Software developers were the \nhighest-paid employees, with an average annual wage \nof $18,453, or 6.2% above their average wage in the \nprevious year. Computer programmers were the fifth-\nhighest paid occupation in the Philippines, according \nto a survey in 2016 (Philippine Statistics Authority \n2017). The survey also found that middle- and low-\n\nskilled workers in ICT and professional, scientific, \nand technical activities (PSTA) received wages above \naverage. The average monthly wage of low-skilled \nworkers was highest in these two industries, at \u00ae13,010 \nfor ICT and \u00ae12,923 for PSTA, which compared with a \nlow-skilled average monthly wage of \u00ae10,162 across all \nindustries. \n\nMeanwhile, software developers and programmers \nin Sri Lanka and Viet Nam earn higher average wages \nthan other ICT professionals. In Sri Lanka, software \ndevelopers and application programmers earn an \naverage monthly wage of SLRs56,536, more than twice \nthe average monthly wage of SLRs23,333 for database \nand network professionals or SLRs25,000 for web \nand multimedia developers. Likewise in Viet Nam, \nsoftware developers are the highest-paid professionals \nin ICT, earning average monthly wages of D8,520,000, \ncompared with, for example, D6,297,000 for web and \nmultimedia developers.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:14)(cid:14)97\n\n2.3.4\u2002Informal jobs, the promise of new technology, and Indonesia\u2019s Go-Jek\n\n1\u2002Informal\u2013formal wage ratio, various years\n\nRatio\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nInformal work remains a prominent fixture across \ndeveloping Asia, ranging from 33% of nonfarm \nemployment in the PRC to 87% in Bangladesh. \nThe\u00a0median is over 70% in the 10 economies in \ndeveloping Asia with data.

In eight countries with \navailable data, the median informal worker wage is \nhalf that of formal\u00a0workers.\n\nInformal work is often a fallback when formal \n\njob opportunities are lacking. Registered firms \ntend to be larger and more productive, pay higher \nwages, and serve larger and wealthier markets. \nEither\u00a0the formal economy needs to expand to \nabsorb informal workers, or informal productivity \nneeds to rise. The\u00a0rise of the digital economy seems \nto be contributing on both fronts and is beginning \nto affect GDP. In Southeast Asia, for example, the \ninternet economy provided 2% of regional GDP and \nis growing rapidly (Anandan\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02017). Since 2015, \nride-hailing has had a compounded annual growth \nrate of 43%, e-commerce 41%, and online media 36%. \nRide-hailing in Indonesia is fiercely contested between \ninternational companies like Uber, regionals like Grab, \nand locals like Go-Jek, Indonesia\u2019s informal motorbike \nservice. Go-Jek revolutionized Jakarta\u2019s informal \ntransport sector after its January 2015 launch.\n\nGo-Jek is a play on English \u201cgo\u201d and Indonesian \n\n\u201cojek,\u201d or motorcycle taxi, a popular option in \nnotoriously gridlocked Jakarta.

The latter is generated \nusing data from the Program for the International \nAssessment of Adult Competencies Surveys (OECD \n2013a, 2016a) that cover mainly of OECD economies \n(Figure\u00a02.3.4). As\u00a0may be expected, economies in \nAsia and the Paci\ufb01c have far greater employment \nshares in manual-intensive jobs and much lower \nshares in ICT-intensive jobs. If Asia and the Paci\ufb01c \nwere to have an employment distribution similar \nto that in OECD countries in nonroutine cognitive, \nICT, and manual jobs, some 160 million jobs \nwould have to be transformed in terms of their \ntask structure. To make Indonesian employment \nstructure, for example, look like that of a developed \neconomy, as many as 25% of Indonesian workers \nwould need to migrate to high-intensive jobs in \nICT and nonroutine cognitive tasks, and about \n20% of workers would need to migrate away from \nmanual-intensive\u00a0jobs.\n\nWhile the evolution of Asia\u2019s employment \nstructure is unlikely to mirror exactly that of the \nadvanced economies, the broad trends will surely \nincrease employment requiring pro\ufb01ciency in \nnonroutine cognitive and ICT tasks and remove \nopportunities in intensive manual work. Indeed, \nin Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, jobs less \nintensive in ICT and nonroutine cognitive tasks, \nand jobs intensive in manual tasks, are already \ndisappearing. \n\nThis has important implications for policy. Not \nsurprisingly, workers in jobs intensive in nonroutine \nand ICT tasks in particular have high educational \nattainment. For instance, the average wage worker \nin high-intensity nonroutine cognitive jobs has \ncompleted either secondary school or a short \ntertiary program, while the average wage worker in \na job with low intensity for these tasks will likely \nhave completed only primary education. In addition, \nwages for jobs intensive in cognitive, social \ninteraction, and ICT tasks are more than twice \nas high as wages for corresponding low-intensity \njobs. Further, wages for jobs with low intensity for \nmanual tasks are 1.8 times higher than those with \nhigh intensity for manual tasks. \n\nSocial interaction\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nICT\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nRoutine cognitive\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nManual\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n\u201340\n\n\u201320\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nPercentage points\n\nICT = information and communication technology, OECD = Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development.\nNote: Differences in employment distribution are calculated by task category as \nthe share of high-intensive jobs in the OECD minus the share of high-intensive \njobs in developing Asia, here comprising \ufb01ve economies: India, Indonesia, \nthe Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

Workers who carry \nout mainly routine and manual tasks will likely experience \nlower wage growth and worsening income inequality. Further, \nas \ufb01rms and industries adjust to new ways of producing and \ndistributing goods and services, the resulting disruptions \nalong supply chains may cause unemployment. As discussed \nin the next section, tackling this downside of new technology \nwill require coordinated action on skills development, labor \nregulation, social protection, and income redistribution. \n\n\f100(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nThe role of government in \nharnessing technology for workers\n\nWhile new technology remains central to creating productive \njobs, there are some concerns from a worker\u2019s perspective. \nThe\u00a0previous section showed that job prospects for occupations \nintensive in cognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks will \nlikely expand, while those intensive in manual tasks will \nlikely shrink. Given the smaller supply of workers pro\ufb01cient in \ncognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks, it is not surprising \nthat wage increases have been higher in these occupations. \nIf the trend persists, inequality in the region will continue \nto deepen (ADB 2012). The worst case would see the wages \nof less-skilled workers hardly increase at all, which is what \nhappened in the developed economies of today during the \ufb01rst \nindustrial revolution. Then, the average wage of workers barely \nincreased over several decades despite a dramatic increase in \nlabor productivity in manufacturing (Bessen 2015).9\n\nThe other major issue is labor displacement. Disruption \naffecting particular types of occupations, industries, and \ufb01rms \nwill render some of their workers unemployed, unless and until \nthey acquire the skills needed for emerging occupations and \nindustries. The process is neither easy nor cheap.\n\nThis section presents various options on how policy \nmakers can deal with these issues. First, education and skills \ndevelopment systems will need to equip Asian workers with the \nskills required to \ufb01ll the jobs generated by new technologies. \nSecond, labor regulations and social protection systems must \nbe designed to protect worker incomes, even as \ufb01rms retain \n\ufb02exibility to adjust workplace practices and job numbers as \neconomic conditions change. Finally, policy on taxes and \nexpenditure will need to ensure sufficient resources for \neducation and skills development and for social protection, and \nthey should bring about more equitable income distribution. \n\nEducation and skills development\nDespite tremendous progress in expanding access to education, \nskills gaps remain a concern across developing Asia. More \nthan 100 million children of primary and secondary school \nage are not in school, and many more leave school without \nbasic literacy and numeracy. This has ripple effects on their \nemployment prospects and widens skills gaps in the labor \nmarket. In 2016, 46% of employers in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c \nreported difficulty in \ufb01lling vacancies for skilled positions \n(ManpowerGroup 2016). \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)101\n\nAsymmetric information aggravates skills gaps and \nmismatches. Educational curricula often misalign with labor \nmarket needs, while education and training programs are \ntypically slow to adapt to changes in skills demand. Although \nworkers may want to acquire new skills, they often do not \nknow what skills employers want or their own employment or \nearnings prospects. Employers, for their part, consider training \na risky investment because newly trained employees may leave \nthe company, perhaps leveraging their newly acquired skills. \nThis creates a vicious cycle of employers looking to hire those \nalready with the needed skills while jobseekers do not know \nthe skills they need and have no opportunity to learn them \non\u00a0the job.\n\nEven when individuals have the right skillsets for certain \n\ntypes of jobs, they may struggle to connect with the right \nemployer. Progress is being made in matching jobseekers with \npotential employers thanks to the diffusion of recruitment \nportals. No longer relying solely on personal networks, \njobseekers can now learn about hundreds of vacancies and \ntheir skills requirements. So far, these portals bene\ufb01t mainly \nurban mid- to high-skilled workers, but they are expanding \nrapidly. In Indonesia, for example, the networking platform \nLinkedIn doubled its users from 4 million to 8 million between \n2015 and 2017, with 70% of new users in the 25\u201344 age group.\nThe big challenge facing Asia and the Paci\ufb01c today is to \nimprove learning outcomes and to prepare for a structural \ntransformation of the economy and the workplace. The good \nnews is that technology, having contributed to the problem, \ncan\u00a0offer solutions.\n\nFoundational skills in a technology-driven economy\nA technology-driven economy makes it more important \nthan ever to learn how to relearn. Solid foundational skills \ncontinue to be a crucial prerequisite to further learning. \nTraditionally, foundational skills included basic reading, \nwriting, and numeracy, but they have grown to encompass \ntwo more categories: social and emotional skills, and digital \nliteracy (Figure 2.4.1). These skills build on each other to \npromote further learning (Acosta et al. 2017, Durlak et al. 2011, \nOECD\u00a02013b). High social and emotional skills are associated \nwith better reading, writing, and numeracy skills, for example, \nand solid reading, writing, and numeracy skills are prerequisite \nfor digital literacy.\n\nDigital literacy is fast becoming indispensable for such \neveryday functions as digital \ufb01nance and e-government, as \nwell as further education and lifelong learning. It includes not \nonly the ability to use digital devices and platforms, but also \nknowing how to use them appropriately. The importance of \nusing digital tools intelligently is often overlooked, as many \n\n\f102(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.4.1\u2002 Skills in a technology-driven economy\n\nSpecialized\n\nSpecialized\n(cid:31)  Acquired through TVET, higher education, and lifelong learning\n(cid:31)  Relate to a speci\ufb01c job, task, academic discipline, or knowledge area\n(cid:31)  Can depreciate with technological change and/or lack of practice, so need regular upgrading\n\nTransversal\n(cid:31)  Acquired through education and life experience\n(cid:31)  Include a range of skills, from critical thinking to creativity and interpersonal skills such as communication skills\n(cid:31)  Are transferable across occupations and sectors\n\nFoundational\n\nTransversal\n\nFoundational\n(cid:31)  Acquired through basic education\n(cid:31)  Include reading, writing, numeracy, socio-emotional skills, and digital literacy\n(cid:31)  Are a stepping stone to further education and full participation in society\n\nTVET = technical and vocational education and training.\nSource: Adapted from UNESCO (2014).\n\ntraining courses focus exclusively on the mechanics of using \na device or speci\ufb01c software. However, learning how to do \nresearch\u2014to make sense of and analyze digital content\u2014is now \nas essential as basic reading and writing skills (OECD 2016b).\nBeyond hardware, two elements are fundamental to \nsuccessful digital literacy programs (World Bank 2016). \nFirst, such programs are more effective when embedded in \nmainstream learning. Standalone programs are less effective \nbecause they do not contextualize the use of technology. \nThis requires adapting curricula and learning materials for \ntraditional subjects to integrate digital technologies. Second, \nteachers must train to adapt pedagogical practices and \nunderstand how to use digital technologies to support learning. \nMany programs have failed because they focused on hardware \nuse, with inadequate attention to teacher training.\n\nSocial and emotional skills affect a range of individual \noutcomes, including learning, employment trajectories, health, \nand overall life satisfaction. De\ufb01nitions and terminology vary, \nbut social and emotional skills are generally understood as \nskills \u201cinvolved in achieving goals, working with others, and \nmanaging emotions\u201d (OECD 2015). They include behavioral \ntraits such as perseverance, self-control, and resilience, as \nwell as such social skills as interacting effectively with others. \nThese skills are malleable, particularly from early childhood to \nadolescence, and therefore can best be taught and strengthened \nthrough childhood education.\n\nRecognizing that different types of foundational skills \n\nbuild on one another, pedagogical approaches are now \nevolving to develop these skills in tandem. For example, \nmany schools are now encouraging students to adopt a \n\u201cgrowth mindset.\u201d The\u00a0concept is based on the idea that one\u2019s \nskills are not inherent but can be developed through effort, \ncommitment, good learning strategies, and support from others \n(Dweck\u00a02007). Failure and errors provide opportunities to \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)103\n\ngrow and thus become part of the learning process. A similar \nprinciple is often used in educational software, especially \nthrough the gami\ufb01cation of learning, which relies on trial and \nerror and on learning by doing.\n\nLeveraging new technologies  \nto build foundational skills\nEducational technology and e-learning are rapidly growing \nglobally, not least in Asia. With some 600 million young \nstudents increasingly connected and eager to use game- \nand social-based learning, new services and products are \n\ufb02ooding the region. Interest in mobile learning is growing as \nsmartphone usage increases.\n\nThese initiatives, driven by global and Asian information \ntechnology startups, are changing the education landscape. \nSome are developing initiatives removed from traditional \neducational arenas, while others are developing tools and \nservices for educators and learners to use in school or at home. \nOne challenge for educators is to determine how best to work \nwith these technology-led businesses to improve learning \noutcomes cost-efficiently and effectively.\n\nTechnology can contribute to foundational skills in several \nways. It provides new content to users, thus improving access \nto learning and teaching resources. Importantly, it contributes \nto changing pedagogical practices, ushering in an era of \nlearning that is more student-centered.\n\nSoftware that enables self-paced learning and that \ntailors teaching to individual students is an important new \ntrend. In its simplest form, self-paced learning occurs when \nstudents progress at their own speed through a learning \nprogram, some moving faster than others toward more \ncomplex material. Adaptive software takes this a step further, \ndirecting students through individualized learning pathways. \nFor\u00a0example, students having more difficulty than others with \na particular concept are given more detailed explanations and \nmore exercises for practice. Further, the software forwards \nindividualized data to teachers so they can target speci\ufb01c \nstudents for additional tutoring or more advanced teaching. \nThis promotes more inclusive learning cost-effectively. Progress \nin machine learning and arti\ufb01cial intelligence will make this \ntype of software more sophisticated. As it disseminates, it will \nchange the role of educators from teacher\u00a0to mentor.\n\nJob-relevant skills in a technology-driven economy\nJob-relevant skills are of two types. Transversal skills, which \nare transferable across occupations and sectors, include \ninterpersonal skills, the ability to think critically, and the \nability to solve problems. They are acquired throughout one\u2019s \n\n\f104(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\neducation and life experience. Specialized skills, by contrast, \nrelate to a particular occupation (such as teaching), task \n(coding), or knowledge area (anthropology). They are typically \nacquired through technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET), higher education, and work experience. \nSpecialized skills are likely to depreciate quickly, particularly \nin a time of fast-evolving technology, and thus require \nregular updating and upgrading. With more automation and \nmachine learning, higher-order specialized skills applicable to \nnonroutine tasks will be particularly valuable.\n\nTVET and higher education systems alike face a complex \nset of challenges. They must expand to accommodate the rising \nnumber of graduates, as well as adults seeking to upgrade their \nskills or retrain. At the same time, they need to improve the \nrelevance of the training and education they provide to respond \nto fast-changing labor market demand.\n\nStronger links between TVET and higher education can \nbring progress toward this goal. To better respond to labor \nmarket demand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, for example, \nis transforming many of its universities into polytechnics, \nand Indonesia is expanding its network of polytechnics. \nCredit\u00a0transfer systems are developing to enable TVET \ngraduates to pursue higher education\u2014allowing, for example, a \ntechnician to become an engineer\u2014and a university student to \nchoose a more vocationally oriented track. This is an important \nstep toward expanding skillsets in the whole workforce. \nHowever, these efforts must be embedded in a comprehensive \napproach that provides opportunities for experienced workers \nto upgrade their skills. It involves, for instance, a framework \nfor recognizing prior learning and developing programs for \nworking adults.\n\nStrengthening linkages between \ufb01rms, universities, and \nvocational schools is essential to make higher education and \nTVET systems more responsive to technological change. \nTraditional approaches remain relevant, such as involving \nindustry partners in the design and delivery of TVET programs \nand promoting workplace learning. New technologies provide \nopportunities for deeper and broader partnerships. Online \ncollaborative platforms, for example, can facilitate development \nof joint projects, including applied research, between schools \nand enterprises.\n\nLeveraging new technologies for job-relevant skills \nand learning to relearn\nMachine learning and big data analysis can help assess and \nmore closely monitor in real time the evolution of occupations \nand their task content and required skillsets. However, \nit requires copious data and works only for sectors and \noccupations well represented on professional networking and \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)105\n\njob search platforms. JobKred in Singapore has developed \nthis kind of tool. By mining data and using other sources \nof information, it assesses the types of skills in demand at \nany given time for speci\ufb01c occupations. It also provides \nindividualized career guidance to users based on their current \nskillsets and recommends education or training programs \nto match them to job requirements. As Asia and the Paci\ufb01c \nbecome better connected, these services can improve labor \nmarket intermediation and address the problem of asymmetric \ninformation.\n\nWith fast-evolving technology rapidly depleting skills, \nlearning to relearn is becoming the new normal. A major \nimplication of lifelong learning is that education and training \nhave to be interwoven with full-time work, so content must \nbe provided in a format that is short, convenient, and mobile. \nShorter online education and training programs are emerging \nin response to this growing demand. So-called \u201cnanodegrees\u201d \nwere developed following the mixed results of massive open \nonline courses. These nanodegrees develop skillsets for targeted \nprofessions, incorporating user experience and acknowledging \nthe need to transform content to make it as easy as possible \nto assimilate. New initiatives\u2014such as the Gnowbe in the US \nand Singapore, and Funzi in Finland\u2014expand on the concept \nof short, convenient, and mobile learning with their \u201cmobile \nmicrolearning\u201d model, which relies on gami\ufb01cation, short \nvideos tailored to modern attention spans, quizzes interspersed \nin learning materials, and learners\u2019 social interaction.\n\nFast-changing labor market demand will increasingly \nrequire individuals to learn, unlearn, and relearn. Digital \ntechnologies, if adapted to local needs, can be powerful tools \nfor individualized and therefore more inclusive learning at \ndifferent stages of life.\n\nLabor regulations and social protection\nNew technologies are transforming the ways work is \norganized. Because digital technologies in particular allow \nsome types of work to be done remotely, they have great \npotential to accelerate the rise of part-time, on-call, or \ntemporary employment\u2014arrangements the International \nLabour Organization calls nonstandard forms of employment. \nWhile such forms grant employers \ufb02exibility and allow workers \nto pursue new opportunities in the labor market, perhaps while \nreconciling work with the demands of home life, they often \noffer little job security. For some workers it can mean cycling \nbetween short-term jobs and unemployment beset by worries \nover when they will next \ufb01nd work and be paid. Such workers \nmay also have meager social security coverage and face greater \noccupational safety and health risks. Finally, they are less likely \nto join a union. \n\n\f106(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nWell-designed labor regulation that takes into account \nassociated aspects of social protection systems is an important \nelement of the policy response to spread the bene\ufb01ts of new \ntechnologies. Labor regulation includes legislation to protect \nemployees by establishing rules for hiring and \ufb01ring; setting \nsome wages, in particular minimum wages; regulating work \nhours and conditions, not least to protect health and safety; and \npromoting equal opportunity. By extension, labor regulation \nincludes the social protection elements most often tied to work \nsuch as health care, income replacement when a job is lost, \nand help in \ufb01nding a new job through information and other \nsupport from public and private sources.\n\nThe key policy challenge today is that labor regulations and \n\nsocial protection systems now current globally were designed \nfor an era when the expected norm was full-time employment \nwith a single company over the long term. This assumption \nnever described most labor markets in developing Asia, \nhowever, and, where it is a reasonably accurate description, \nnew technologies will likely bring widespread changes to the \nworld of work. The prospect of a worker remaining in one job \nwith a single employer over the long term looks less and less \nlikely for large groups of workers. \n\nWhile a detailed examination of current labor regulations \nand social protection systems\u2014and how they need to evolve\u2014\nis\u00a0beyond the scope of this chapter, the concept of \u201cprotected \nmobility\u201d seems an appropriate guiding principle (Auer 2005). \nA central aspect of this is to ensure that a highly mobile \nlabor market\u2014and one dealing out more frequent spells of \nunemployment\u2014has mechanisms that protect worker incomes. \nFirst, labor regulations must avoid two extremes: one that \n\nleaves workers with too little protection, and the other that \nimposes high labor costs that only encourage \ufb01rms to automate. \nUsing cross-country panel data on manufacturing industries, \nHasan, Mitra, and Sundaram (2013) found more restrictive \nlabor regulations associated with higher capital intensity in \nmanufacturing, especially in developing economies and in \nsectors that either require more frequent labor adjustment or, \nlike garments and footwear, are labor intensive and employ \nmore unskilled workers.\n\nSecond, at a time when job security will likely erode, any \n\ntemptation to restrict job dismissals through blunt means \nmust be avoided. The Centre for Business Research Labour \nIndex database at the University of Cambridge, which covers \n22 economies in developing Asia, reports that employers \nmust obtain prior permission from the state to dismiss an \nindividual in India, Indonesia, and, since 2008, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Such requirements can make layoffs very \ncumbersome and costly for \ufb01rms, effectively raising the cost \nof hiring labor in the \ufb01rst place. In general, policy makers \nshould be guided by the principle of protecting workers rather \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)107\n\nthan protecting\u00a0jobs. In developing countries, transitioning \nworkers to more productive sectors and \ufb01rms, especially from \ninformal to formal employment, is essential to creating good \njobs. Theory and evidence both support the conclusion that \nrestricting dismissals undermines workers\u2019 welfare when a \nbetter alternative is severance pay or unemployment insurance \n(Ranjan, Hasan, and Eleazar, 2018).\n\nThird, even severance pay has its drawbacks as workers \nenter periods of unemployment.10 Policy makers, especially \nin middle-income countries, should consider unemployment \ninsurance tailored to developing country circumstances. \nSuch systems can function alongside more traditional public \nworks programs, such as India\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi National \nRural Employment Guarantee Act, which provides to the \nneedy 100 days of wage employment annually on public \nworks. Worldwide, and especially in advanced economies, \nunemployment insurance systems more effectively \nprovide adequate income protection without imposing \nlarge efficiency costs (Vodopivec 2013). The catch is that \nsuch unemployment insurance systems are demanding, \nboth \ufb01nancially and administratively. They\u00a0therefore \nneed to be tailored to the developing economy capacities \n(Box\u00a02.4.1). Fortunately,\u00a0digital\u00a0technologies allow biometric \nidenti\ufb01cation, as in India\u2019s Aadhaar system, initiated in \n2008 and now covering 1.2 billion people. As they also allow \ndigitized administrative records that can be shared securely \nand accurately, they hold great promise for building the \nadministrative capacity required to manage a modern system of \nunemployment bene\ufb01ts. Other large-scale digital ID initiatives \nin Asia include Indonesia\u2019s e-KTP card, Malaysia\u2019s MyKad, and \nPakistan\u2019s NADRA.\n\nFourth, minimum wages are an important way for \n\npolicy\u00a0makers to ensure that less-skilled workers enjoy a decent \nstandard of living and to counter inequality. Good design \nprinciples are crucial in setting minimum wages. They need \nto avoid being either too generous or too meager, and they \nshould rise in line with productivity gains. A rule of thumb is \nfor minimum wages to be 30%\u201340% of the median wage, or \n25%\u201335% of the mean wage (IMF 2016). Different minimum \nwages for different locations should accurately re\ufb02ect \ndifferences in the cost of living. At\u00a0the same time, governments \nmust resist pressure to introduce different minimum wages for \ndifferent sectors or categories of workers. The more types of \nminimum wage there are, the more likely lobbyists and special \ninterest groups will interfere and keep the market from playing \nits vital role in allocating resources.\n\nFifth, rather than create regulatory barriers to nonstandard \n\nforms of employment such as part-time contract labor, it may \nbe better to regulate more neutrally. These workers need \nsocial protection too, requiring that social security systems \n\n\f108(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n2.4.1\u2002Adapting unemployment insurance to developing economy realities \n\nIn developed countries, unemployment insurance \nprovides income support to workers who have \nlost their jobs. Systems require both workers \nand employers to contribute. Once a worker has \nmet certain minimum requirements for length of \nemployment and amount contributed, they qualify for \njob-loss benefits. Benefits are typically 40%\u201375% of \naverage earnings and can be collected for a prescribed \nperiod, typically 6 months in the US, on the condition \nthat the recipient actively seeks new employment. \nStudies show that such systems allow job-seekers to \nsmooth consumption while looking for new work. \nWhile unemployment insurance may hinder economic \nefficiency if recipients slow their job search, it has \nthe positive effect of giving workers time to find more \nsuitable reemployment. Moreover, unemployment \ninsurance acts as an automatic macroeconomic \nstabilizer by contributing to aggregate demand during \nrecessions. \n\nIn developing countries, however, unemployment \n\ninsurance systems are rare. Where they exist, they \ntypically cover only a small fraction of the formal \nworkforce, excluding agricultural and informal workers \nentirely. The systems are most common in Latin \nAmerica, though the PRC has one for urban workers. \nObstacles for developing countries are large informal \n\nsectors and little of the administrative capacity needed \nto ensure that contributions come as required from \nboth workers and enterprises, and to accurately track \nworkers and confirm their eligibility. \n\nTo successfully adapt unemployment insurance \nsystems to developing country realities, governments \nshould do several things: Relax eligibility criteria \nby permitting informal work without terminating \nbenefits. Rely initially only on worker and employer \ncontributions to finance the system through \nunemployment insurance savings accounts, as tried \nin several Latin American countries, in which unused \nsavings merge with retirement accounts. Transition to \nmore sophisticated systems by moving on from simple \nunemployment insurance savings accounts to a hybrid \nversion, such as the one Chile introduced in\u00a02002. \nThese hybrids are initially funded from worker \ncontributions and subsequently through a \u201csolidarity\u201d \nfund, partly financed through employer contributions \nin lieu of paying into existing severance pay systems, \nand through general taxes, especially as economically \nvulnerable workers are brought into the system. \n\nSource: ADB based on Robalino and Weber (2013) and \n\nVodopivec\u00a0(2013).\n\nbe\u00a0adapted to increase coverage. Advisable adaptations include \nlowering thresholds required for minimum hours, earnings, \nor duration of employment; making systems more \ufb02exible \nregarding the contributions required to qualify for bene\ufb01ts; \nallowing interrupted contribution; and making bene\ufb01ts \nmore\u00a0portable. \n\nTax and expenditure policies\nPublic \ufb01nance must be the main source for investments in \neducation and training, especially to bene\ufb01t the economically \ndisadvantaged and those displaced by new technology, and for \nfunding social protection systems. Figure 2.4.2 shows many \nregional economies spending much less on social protection \nthan do advanced economies. Augmenting social protection \nexpenditure will require governments to raise more revenue. \nThe share of government revenue in GDP is low in many Asian \ncountries\u2014in 2016 about 10 percentage points below the OECD \naverage of 25%. Most government revenue is tax revenue, \nwhich can be increased by broadening the tax base, improving \ntax administration, and making taxes more progressive, which \nalso addresses income inequality.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)109\n\n2.4.2\u2002 Public social protection expenditure, 2015 \n\n2.4.3\u2002 Personal income tax, 2014 or latest available year\n\nor\u00a0latest\u00a0available year\n\nOECD\n\nJapan\n\nAll countries\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nDeveloping countries\nexcluding Asia\n\nPhilippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndia\n\nThailand\n\nPRC\n\nIndonesia\n\nBangladesh\n\nViet Nam\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n% of GDP\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, OECD = Organisation for Economic  \nCo-operation and Development, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nNotes: Simple averages are given for all countries, OECD, and developing \ncountries excluding Asia.

And, despite tax \nrates comparable with the world average (though below \nthe OECD average), personal income tax collection is low \nin\u00a0Asia (Figure\u00a02.4.3). One reason is relatively high exemption \nthresholds, and another is slow graduation to the top personal \nincome tax rates (ADB 2012). Tax concessions also keep \ncollection low. \n\nImproving tax administration\nGovernment revenue can be increased by improving tax \nadministration. In the Philippines, for example, weak tax \nadministration is a constraint on government revenue \n(ADB 2009). Complicated\u00a0tax systems with many rates, \nexemptions, deductions, and concessions increase the cost \nof tax administration and of monitoring compliance, while \ncreating opportunities for tax avoidance and tax planning, \nwhich are seen to favor higher-income taxpayers because they \ngenerally have more scope for shifting income to avoid higher \nrates. Unfair tax systems can inhibit willingness to pay taxes. \nStrengthening governance and institutions is key to improving \ntax collection, and digital technologies can help (Box 2.4.2).\n\n2.4.2\u2002Goods and services tax in India facilitated using technology\n\nGovernments are increasingly using digital \ntechnologies to improve tax compliance and \nenforcement. Digitization can broaden the tax base, \nreduce administrative costs, improve transparency, \nease the compliance burden, and incentivize tax \ncompliance. \n\nOn 1 July 2017, India rolled out its goods and \n\nservices tax (GST), a landmark tax reform that \nreplaced its numerous central government and state \ntaxes with a simplified and unified tax system designed \nto create a single Indian market. The GST is expected \nto cut red tape, curb corruption, lubricate domestic \ntrade, broaden the tax base, and increase tax revenue. \nAll GST filings are handled electronically. GST\u00a0is \n\nimplemented through the GST Network, a web-\nbased \u201cone-stop solution\u201d for all India\u2019s indirect tax \nrequirements. The GST Network is the information \ntechnology backbone for the GST, providing a \ncommon portal where taxpayers can file tax returns \nand tax authorities can match input credits with \nthe liability declared by suppliers and issue notices. \n\nIndia\u2019s\u00a0Income\u00a0Tax Act, as amended on 1 July 2017, \nlikewise requires taxpayers to be registered with the \n2008 Aadhaar program, India\u2019s biometric identification \nsystem, to file income tax returns. Aadhaar, in turn, \nis mandated by law to be linked to individual bank \naccounts. Banks\u00a0will eventually be required to freeze \nunlinked accounts as part of the wider government \neffort to trace tax evasion and formalize the \nunderground economy.\n\nUnder this new digital tax regime, the government \n\ncan put India on a path toward a system with more \ntransparency and greater participation in the formal \neconomy. Mandatory electronic tax filing can better \nensure administration at arm\u2019s length by minimizing \ntaxpayers\u2019 personal interaction with tax officials. \nIncreased digitization is further expected to broaden \nthe tax base and lessen tax evasion. A\u00a0survey using \nGST data helped the government add 3.4 million \nnew indirect taxpayers as of December 2017 \n(Government\u00a0of India 2018). \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)111\n\nMaking taxes more progressive\nThe progressive orientation of \ufb01scal revenue systems can be \nenhanced through taxes on property, inheritance, and capital \ngains. They can make resource mobilization more equitable \nat a relatively low economic cost. Taxes levied on immovable \nproperty are widely viewed as a \ufb01scal source tailored for \nlocal government. Because such taxes are underused in most \nparts of the world, including in developing Asia, they offer \nscope for strengthening \ufb01scal resources, particularly for \nlocal\u00a0governments. \n\nTaxes on property include annual taxes on land and \n\nproperty, stamp duties or property transfer taxes, development \nfees, betterment levies, estate duties or inheritance taxes, and \ncapital gains taxes on property transfers. An attractive feature \nof property tax is that, among broadly collected taxes, it has \nthe least adverse effect on growth. In\u00a0addition, property tax is \nprogressive because it is proportional to property value.\n\nAnother inherently progressive tax is inheritance tax, \nwhich currently exists in only four economies in the region \n(ADB 2015b). This levy taxes the transmission of wealth \n(and\u00a0hence inequality) across generations but has little effect on \nwork incentive. The capital gains tax similarly targets the rich, \nwho tend to own more capital, and does not adversely affect \nincentives, as the tax is usually levied on gains realized from \ninvestments. \n\nCorporate income taxes are similarly low in some \n\nAsian economies, partly because of tax incentives to attract \ninvestment and to spare activities seen as having social or \neconomic merit. However, income taxes are less progressive \nif tax incentives go to the high-income special interests who \noften lobby for concessions. Moreover, such incentives are often \ninefficient because they simply subsidize activities \ufb01rms would \nhave undertaken anyway. Thus, tax collection can be increased \nby broadening the corporate tax base. On a related issue, there \nhave been many articles in the press about taxing robots. \nMany people worry that extreme automation will destroy \ncountless jobs without replacing them with comparable jobs, \ncausing unprecedented labor displacement. As that proposal is \ncontroversial, a more practical option to consider might be to \nreform policies that subsidize capital, such as tax deductions \nfor interest paid on loans, to raise the cost of capital and \nthereby buoy demand for labor.\n\n\f112(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nThe full agenda is broader\nAs noted above, governments are tasked with responding to \ntechnology and its effects on the labor market. At the same time, \nthey stand to bene\ufb01t by embracing new technology. From\u00a0tax \ncompliance and enforcement to smart cities, health care, and \neducation, there is tremendous potential for more efficient and \neffective delivery of public services. However, governments \nneed to create an environment that enables technology adoption \nthrough a two-pronged strategy. As they complete the necessary \nsupport infrastructure, they should support research and \ndevelopment and also innovation. In both cases, government \ninvolvement is both direct and indirect.\n\nThe public sector is directly responsible for providing basic \n\ninfrastructure such as energy supply and transport. Similarly, \ngiven the central role the internet plays in new technologies, \ndeveloping a nationwide broadband backbone and other ICT \ninfrastructure is essential. Even when parts of the infrastructure \nare provided by the private sector, the government still has a role \nto play, whether in allocating space on the spectrum, ensuring \ncompetition among providers, or enforcing minimum standards \nand interoperability. Particularly important, to address inclusion \nand poverty reduction, is to ensure that service providers cover \nthe \u201clast mile\u201d to the homes, farms, and businesses of the poorest \ncustomers. The\u00a0technological infrastructure that receives \nthe fewest headlines but is the most critical for inclusion and \npoverty reduction is in remote and lagging regions, where there \nis little \ufb01nancial incentive for private provision. Technological \ninnovations cannot help areas that lack connectivity. This is \nespecially true for rural areas, where new technologies have \nconsiderable potential for raising productivity and earnings in \nagriculture (Box\u00a02.4.3). \n\nThe general view among economists is that the private sector \n\ntends to leave a lot of necessary research and development to \nthe public sector, considering it a public good. Government \ncan directly fund research or create an environment that is \nconducive to private sector innovation. Government-supported \nresearch can be conducted in universities or in publicly funded \nresearch centers, or by private entities that receive grants \nor \ufb01scal incentives to undertake research and development. \nPrivate\u00a0sector innovation, meanwhile, requires regulation \nto protect personal data and privacy, an effective system of \nintellectual property protection, and the means to ensure that \nlarge technology \ufb01rms abide by the norms of fair competition. \nFinally, technology startups need adequate capital to get their \nbusiness off the ground.\n\nDeveloping Asia has historically relied on abundant labor \nto support export-led growth. Now it is poised to leverage its \nexpanding middle class to usher in a new era of consumption-\ndriven growth. With the right policies, new technologies can \nplay a key role in this transition.\n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)113\n\n2.4.3\u2002Technology for agriculture, Asia\u2019s biggest employer\n\nAgriculture will remain a top employer in Asia for \nsome time to come. Even if workers continue to leave \nagriculture at the same rate as in 2000\u20132015, in 2030 \nthe sector will still employ 21% of the workforce in \nBangladesh, 43% in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, and 28% in Myanmar. It is therefore vital \nthat productivity and earnings in the sector be raised \nto tackle the challenge of worsening inequality in \nthe\u00a0region. \n\nProductivity can be enhanced, and food security \nsafeguarded, by further extending the use of proven \ntechnologies such as mechanization, high-yielding \ncrop varieties, and improved irrigation, fertilizer, and \npesticide. \n\nFourth Industrial Revolution technologies can \nimprove productivity even further. Bioinformatics\u2014\ncombining computer science, biology, math, and \nengineering to analyze biological data\u2014allows the \ndevelopment of even better crop varieties using \nmodern agricultural biotechnology and genomics \n(Xue et al. 2008). Dramatic productivity gains can \nbe achieved through precision agriculture, which \nprescribes exact quantities of seed, fertilizer, pesticide, \nwater, and tillage for individually managed plots as \nsmall as 1 square meter using field or remote sensors \n(Mulla and Miao 2016). Pesticides can be administered \nby drone, and manual control of drip irrigation can be \nautomated.\n\nFourth Industrial Revolution technologies may \ninitially benefit mainly larger and better-off farmers, \ntaking time to spread. Precision agriculture is only \ngradually becoming the norm even in developed \neconomies, with 60% of farmers in Europe and \nNorth\u00a0America expecting current trends in adoption to \ncontinue until most farmers use the practice by 2030 \n(Corsini et al. 2015). \n\nHowever, some new technologies have potential to \nbenefit smallholder farmers in developing Asia today. \nRelatively accessible and cheap ICT technologies \ncan cost-effectively help farmers improve production \npractices, better connect with markets, and narrow the \ngap between farm gate prices and retail prices\u2014a\u00a0gap \nthat, for rice in the Philippines, can equal the farm \ngate price. Branding and marketing can be enhanced. \nHazelnut producers in Bhutan use digital data \ncollection to trace produce and verify plant health and \nbest practices, as well as to improve supply chains. \nSimilarly, the Digital India campaign brings villages \nonline to promote knowledge-intensive agriculture, \nfinancial inclusion, and rural entrepreneurship (Lele \n2017). In the PRC, the Hunan Agri-Telecom Platform \nuses text messages to send farmers market and other \ninformation, and the E-Price App uses the internet, \ncloud computing, and smartphones to disseminate \nprices (Singh et al. 2011).\n\nAny technology that provides to farmers an \n\notherwise scarce or expensive resource helps to spur \nrural growth from the bottom up. Sharing tractors \nUber style can help, as can electronic payment of \nfertilizer subsidies and e-extension to reach remote \nareas veterinarians and agronomists rarely visit. \nOf course, such ICT-based interventions are \nno silver bullet. They require affordable access to \nmobile phones and the internet. Meanwhile, internet \npenetration in Pakistan, for example, is estimated \nat 15.5%, less than half of the PRC rate of 53.2% \n(ADB\u00a02017d). Such digital divides pose significant \nbarriers to smallholder farmers. And, in the end, \nfarm gate prices can never be generous where basic \ntransportation and storage infrastructure is weak.\n\n\f114(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\n4 When labor force surveys or population censuses are \n\nMost references to productivity in this chapter are to labor \nproductivity. Growth in output per worker has three main \nsources: capital accumulation, which provides to workers \nmore equipment to work with; technological change, which \nusually introduces new types of equipment and machines \nbut includes better ways of managing the shop floor and the \nfirm more generally; and better skills, which are acquired \nnot only through education and training but also from \nexperience. It is widely accepted that technological change \nis the main driver of increases in productivity.\nSimilar results emerge from a 10-sector decomposition \nof changes in average labor productivity into structural \nchange and within-sector productivity components.\nGVCs are also known by various terms, such as global \nsupply chains, international production networks, and \nproduction fragmentation. GVCs give rise to offshoring, \nvertical specialization, trade in value added, second \nunbundling, and trade in tasks.\n\nunavailable for any given year, total employment as \nwell as occupation-industry shares are interpolated or \nextrapolated.\nEmployment changes over the decade between 2005 and \n2015 are studied to abstract from cyclical factors.\nBased on ILOSTAT data on employment in developing \nAsia, which includes 38 economies with employment \nestimates from the International Labour Organization: \nAfghanistan; Armenia; Azerbaijan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; \nBrunei Darussalam; Cambodia; the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina; Fiji; Georgia; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; \nKazakhstan; the Republic of Korea; the Kyrgyz Republic; \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Maldives; \nMongolia; Myanmar; Nepal; Pakistan; Papua New Guinea; \nthe Philippines; Samoa; Singapore; Solomon Islands; \nSri\u00a0Lanka; Taipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; Timor-Leste; \nTonga; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; Vanuatu; and Viet\u00a0Nam.\nAn efficiency correction is used by constructing a measure \nof total factor productivity for each country and each year \nin the dataset using the Penn World Tables, release 9.0 \n(Feenstra, Inklaar, and Timmer 2015). A concern is that \nthe contribution of trade and technology to changes in \njobs is sensitive to the choice of the efficiency correction. \nAlternative estimates of total factor productivity, including \nthose developed by Inklaar and Diewert (2016), suggest \nthat the results do not qualitatively change.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 Methodology and data used in this section do not allow \nmanual tasks to be disaggregated into routine and \nnonroutine. \n\n\fHow technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)115\n\n9 Why were wages stagnant for so long, even as new \n\ntechnology improved labor productivity? Wage growth \ndepends not only on how much output expands per worker, \nbut also on how workers\u2019 share in output evolves. This\u00a0is \npartly determined by the nature of the technology, but \nthere are other factors: the extent of competition in product \nmarkets, workers\u2019 bargaining power, the relative mobility \nof capital versus labor, and even social norms. While unions \nare one source of worker bargaining power, Bessen (2015) \nhighlighted another: the skills workers possess and their \nexperience. In US cotton mills in the early 19th century, \ntechnology was constantly improving, continually changing \nthe skills needed to operate machinery. Because of this, \nexperience did not boost workers\u2019 bargaining power. Only \nwhen the technology standardized and skill certification \nbecame possible did experience translate into bargaining \npower. If their wages did not improve, workers could move \nto other firms happy to pay them more.\nThere are several reasons. First, many workers entitled \nto severance pay fail to receive it. Second, payouts are \nunrelated to the time unemployed. Third, unless severance \npay is very generous, which can impose serious efficiency \ncosts, it is rarely sufficient. Data from World\u00a0Bank \nDoing\u00a0Business surveys show that some countries in \ndeveloping Asia, notably Indonesia and Sri Lanka, \nrequire very generous severance pay. By contrast, the few \ndeveloped countries that rely on mandatory severance pay \ndo not require it to be very generous. These economies do, \nhowever, provide unemployment insurance.\n\n10\n\n\f116(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nBackground papers\nBertulfo, D., E. Gentile, and G. de Vries.

Inflation  returned,  at  1.0%,  and  the  current  account  deficit \nwidened slightly to equal 2.5% of GDP. Growth is projected to moderate to 4.0% in 2018 \nand 4.2% in 2019, as inflation remains below 3.0% and the current account deficit widens \nfurther  toward  3.0%  of  GDP.  Continued  fiscal  consolidation  is  critical  to  reduce  high \npublic  debt. \n\nEconomic performance \nStrong expansion in industry and services boosted growth to \n7.5% in 2017 from a negligible 0.2% in 2016. On the supply side, \nindustry excluding construction expanded by 10.4%, double the \n4.8% rate in 2016, with gains in most subsectors. Growth\u00a0in \nservices accelerated to 10.4% from 4.0%, re\ufb02ecting strong \nrecovery in consumption. Buffeted by poor weather, agriculture \ndeclined by 4.0%. Construction grew by 3.1%, after 4 years of \ncontraction, on higher private construction and government \ninvestment (Figure 3.1.1).\n\nOn the demand side, consumption and investment \n\npropelled growth. Private consumption rose by an estimated \n6.7%, following a 1.2% decline in 2016, on higher lending and \nremittances. Public consumption expanded by 6.3%, up from \n4.1% in 2016, despite \ufb01scal consolidation. Investment rose by \n7.8%, reversing an 8.7% decline in 2016, with higher inventories \nand an estimated 4.0% increase in \ufb01xed capital formation, \nincluding higher government spending.

The ratio of public debt to GDP \njumped from 16.4% in 2008 to 40.6% a year later. In 2017, it \nreached 58.8%, near the 60% legal ceiling. Fiscal consolidation \nto reduce the debt ratio is thus the government\u2019s top priority \nover the medium term. At the same time, higher growth and \ngrowth-friendly \ufb01scal reform are essential to rebuild \ufb01scal \nhealth and make debt reduction sustainable, especially with a \n$500 million eurobond due for repayment in 2020.\n\nThe authorities view economic growth as a counterbalance \nto \ufb01scal consolidation. Growth could bene\ufb01t substantially from \nfurther institutional and regulatory strengthening to improve \nthe investment climate, from productivity-enhancing structural \nreform (for agriculture in particular), and from the expansion \nof current initiatives that support sectors with export \npotential, such as food processing, textiles, mining, information \ntechnology, and tourism.\n\nMeasures addressing both revenue and expenditure are \n\nessential for \ufb01scal consolidation, as are steps to minimize \ninevitable constraint on growth. Broadening the tax base and \nenhancing revenue administration, along with measures to \nrationalize spending and improve efficiency, should eventually \nbalance the budget. The government\u2019s digital transformation \nstrategy, to be approved in 2018, aims to establish a united \ndigital environment in all spheres of state administration to \nenhance efficiency and transparency, thereby improving the \nbusiness environment. \n\nThe introduction in January 2018 of higher personal \n\nincome taxes and excises on gasoline, diesel fuel, and \ntobacco promises to boost revenues. On the expenditure side, \na\u00a0stronger foundation for growth can emerge from spending \nthat prioritizes productive activities. Growth may\u00a0continue \nto accelerate even as \ufb01scal policy tightens if the government \nimproves budget efficiency by reallocating expenditure in \nfavor of high-return investment projects and reforming \npublic \ufb01nancial management in general. The government\u2019s \ncommitment to developing a\u00a0systematic approach to preparing, \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nArmenia\u2002\u2002131\n\nimplementing, and managing public\u2013private partnerships, \nwith legislation scheduled for 2018, stands to promote private \nparticipation in public investment projects, maximize synergy \nbetween the two sectors, and help sustain growth.\n\nFiscal regulation limits the budget de\ufb01cit to 3% of average \n\nGDP over the previous 3 years (equivalent to 2.8% of GDP in \n2017) if public debt outstanding exceeds 50% of the previous \nyear\u2019s GDP, with an absolute cap on debt at 60%. Changes\u00a0to \nthis \ufb01scal rule, which take effect during the 2018 budget \ncycle, allow the government more \ufb02exibility to respond \nto the business cycle and prioritize capital expenditure. \nUnder\u00a0the revised \ufb01scal rule, if public debt exceeds 40% of \nGDP, the de\ufb01cit in the state budget should be less than capital \nexpenditure. If debt exceeds 50% of GDP, current expenditure \nmust rise more slowly than recent GDP growth. If debt exceeds \n60% of GDP, current expenditure is further restricted and may \nnot exceed domestic revenue. With total spending thus linked \nmore closely to the size of budget de\ufb01cit, and with tighter \nrestrictions on current outlays, the government should \ufb01nd \nit easier to reallocate expenditure toward growth-enhancing \nprograms, in\u00a0particular capital projects.\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nRecession  ended  in  2017  as  higher  oil  prices  and  gains  in  services  and  agriculture  offset \na  decline  in  industry  and  returned  the  current  account  balance  to  surplus.  Inflation \naccelerated  slightly  to  12.9%.  Growth  is  forecast  to  reach  1.7%  in  2018  and  2.0%  in  2019 \nas  reviving  oil  prices  allow  higher  public  investment,  stabilize  the  exchange  rate  and \ncontain inflation, and maintain the current account surplus. Fiscal consolidation is needed \nto  sustain  sovereign  wealth  resources.\n\nEconomic performance \nExpansion in services and agriculture stabilized the economy \nin 2017. Growth returned at 0.1%, following the sharp 3.1% \ncontraction in 2016.\n\nOn the supply side, industry shrank by 3.6% in 2017, less \nthan the 5.9% fall in 2016, with a smaller decline in construction \n(Figure\u00a03.2.1). Mining dropped by 4.6%, reversing 0.7% growth \nin 2016 as oil output fell by 5.6% and gas by 3.0%. This re\ufb02ected \na gradual decline in production to avoid sharp decreases in \nfuture years as limited reserves become depleted. Construction \nfell by 1.5%, improving on a 22.9% plunge in 2016, thanks to \nwork on the Shah Deniz gas \ufb01eld and the Southern Gas Corridor \npipeline, as well as projects for power distribution, education, \nand agriculture. Agriculture expanded by 4.2%, up from 2.6% \nin 2016 as crop production rose by 6.1% on gains in cotton, \nfruit, and sugar beets. Services grew by 3.5%, following a 0.7% \ndecline in 2016, with increases in tourism and transportation.\nOn the demand side, higher oil prices and exchange rate \n\nstability (Figure 3.2.2) helped consumption grow by 4.4%. \nInvestment fell by 2.6%, more than the 0.9% decline in 2016, \nbecause of lower oil revenues. Net exports rose by 7.1%, however, \nreversing a 12.0% drop in 2016 as exports outpaced imports.\n\nIn\ufb02ation accelerated to 12.9% from 12.4% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting \n\nthe lagged effect of currency devaluation and a rise in fuel \nand electricity tariffs in December 2016, although the pace \nof in\ufb02ation slowed toward the end of the year (Figure 3.2.3). \nPrices rose by 16.4% for food, 11.6% for other goods, and 9.3% \nfor services.\n\nFiscal policy was generally expansionary as the state \n\nbudget de\ufb01cit widened to equal 1.6% of GDP, up from \n0.4% in\u00a02016 (Figure 3.2.4).

Net international reserves rose by 34.2% as a \nrecovery in oil prices helped limit the continuing depreciation \nof the Azerbaijan manat to 7.7% against the US dollar. However, \ncredit to the economy fell by 35.7%. Dollarization remains \nextensive, with 72.3% of deposits in foreign currency, re\ufb02ecting \nweak con\ufb01dence in the manat. This constrains lending to the \neconomy, as households, who receive 38% of all loans, prefer \nto borrow in manat. Nonperforming loans grew by 10.4%, \nreaching 13.8% of total bank lending.\n\nThe current account balance recorded an estimated \nsurplus equal to 5.5% of GDP, reversing a de\ufb01cit of 3.6% in \n2016. With higher oil prices, the trade surplus reached 16.4% \nof GDP. Exports grew by 17.1%, having dropped by 15.2% \nin\u00a02016. Imports declined by 2.5%, less than the 7.9% decrease \nin 2016, as lower imports for the oil sector and restrictions \non government imports offset a rise in other imports. Inward \nworker remittances nearly doubled to $1.0 billion. As higher \noil prices helped limit manat depreciation, the central bank \nboosted reserves to $5.3 billion from $4.0 billion in 2016. \nSOFAZ expanded its assets by $2.7 billion to $35.8 billion at the \nend of 2017 (Figure 3.2.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to reach 1.7% in 2018 on a rebound in \nconstruction and accelerate further to 2.0% in 2019 as industry \nbegins to expand (Figure 3.2.7).

Combatting in\ufb02ation will remain a key \nchallenge, requiring coordinated monetary and \ufb01scal policies.\n\nFiscal policy is expected to support growth, with additional \n\nSOFAZ transfers \ufb01nancing a major expansion in public \ninvestment. Including these transfers, the central budget de\ufb01cit \nis projected to narrow to 1.5% of GDP in 2018 and 0.8% in \n2019\u2014though without transfers the de\ufb01cit would widen from \n7.1% of GDP in 2017 to 13.5% in 2018 and 12.8% in 2019. Stronger \ngrowth and higher oil prices are expected to boost revenues, \nas will higher customs duties and excise taxes that took effect \nin early 2018. With higher SOFAZ transfers, revenue is forecast \nto reach 32.8% of GDP in 2018 but decline to 30.3% in 2019. \nExpenditure is also projected to rise sharply, to 34.2% of GDP in \n2018 as investment spending doubles, then ease to 31.1% in 2019.\nOver the next 2 years, monetary policy is expected to \nremain tight to curb in\ufb02ation. Increased oil earnings should \ntame volatility in the foreign exchange market, and the central \nbank may intervene to prevent any signi\ufb01cant depreciation of \nthe manat and thereby limit in\ufb02ationary pressures. Banking\u00a0is \nexpected to remain highly dollarized, and with improved \nexchange rate stability the private sector may be more willing \nto borrow in foreign currency, boosting lending.\n\nThe current account surplus is forecast to widen to equal \n6.9% of GDP in 2018 before returning to 6.2% in 2019 as the \nShah Deniz II gas \ufb01eld begins operation, and with oil prices \nprojected to remain above $60/barrel (Figure 3.2.9). Imports \nare forecast to decline by 6.0% in 2018, constrained by higher \ncustoms duties on machinery and cars, and show little change \nin 2019.

To establish a strong \ufb01nancial \nposition and preserve resources for future generations, the \ngovernment created SOFAZ in 1999 as the country\u2019s sovereign \nwealth fund. It has been a signi\ufb01cant source of \ufb01nancing \nfor public investment, either directly or through transfers \nto the state budget. Thanks to the government\u2019s boosting of \nnon-oil revenues, transfers from SOFAZ have steadily eased \nfrom 50.7% of budget revenues in 2014 to 37.1% in\u00a02017. \nTo promote good governance in the oil and gas sector, \nAzerbaijan established in April 2017 the Extractive Industries \nTransparency Commission under SOFAZ leadership.\n\nSOFAZ assets slid from $37.1 billion in 2014 to $33.6 \nbillion in 2015 as large transfers continued despite a fall in \nrevenues caused by declines in oil prices and export volumes. \nTo stop the drawdown, the government cut transfers by 6.3% \nin 2016 and a further 20% in 2017, helping restore SOFAZ \nassets to $35.8\u00a0billion at the end of 2017. Yet the return on \nSOFAZ investments weakened from 4.5% in 2007 to 1.9% \nin\u00a02017. Over\u00a0the past 5 years, annualized returns on SOFAZ \ninvestments have averaged 2.4%. By comparison, the real return \non Norway\u2019s Oil Fund investment portfolio averaged 9.2%.\nWith a recovery in oil prices, the 2018 budget calls for \na 51% rise in SOFAZ transfers to cover a 19.7% increase in \nspending. Although SOFAZ is projected to have a net income \nof $1.1 billion in 2018, further large transfers in the event of \nother revenue shortfalls could put pressure on SOFAZ assets. \nAlong with central bank reserves, SOFAZ assets are important \nin determining the country\u2019s sovereign credit rating. Ensuring \ngood quality and growth in fund assets is therefore important \nto maintain and improve Azerbaijan\u2019s creditworthiness, toward \nkeeping moderate the cost of borrowing for development.\n\nIn December 2016, the government adopted a strategic road \nmap that calls for rules-based SOFAZ transfers, ending the link \nbetween transfers and oil prices. This entails setting SOFAZ \nbudget transfers in line with a medium-term \ufb01scal framework \nthat provides clear revenue targets and expenditure limits to \nensure \ufb01scal sustainability. Beyond this reform, strengthening \nthe broader economy and improving tax administration would \nincrease non-oil revenue, thereby reducing the need for SOFAZ \nbudget transfers, as could more efficient public investment \nmanagement. In addition, SOFAZ could identify ways to boost \nearnings in its investment strategy.\n\n\fGeorgia \n\nStrong  gains  in  services,  consumption,  and  investment  boosted  growth  to  an  estimated \n5.0%  in  2017.  Coupled  with  higher  excise  taxes  and  import  prices,  this  tripled  inflation  to \n6.0%. Export expansion helped narrow the current account deficit. Growth is projected to \nreach  4.7%  in  2019,  following  a  dip  to  4.5%  in  2018,  on  strong  investment  and  exports. \nGreater  diversification  in  service  exports  would  support  growth. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth rose to an estimated 5.0% from 2.8% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting \nimprovement in services and gains in private consumption, \npublic investment, and net exports. On the supply side, \nservices expanded by 5.5%, up from 2.4% in 2016 on robust \ngrowth in \ufb01nance, up 9.0%, and hospitality services, with \nhotel and restaurant activity up 11.2% and transportation \nup\u00a07.3%. Industry expanded by 5.6%, less than the 6.0% rise in \n2016, with gains of 11.1% in construction and 6.8% in mining. \nAgriculture shrank by 2.7%, reversing 0.3% growth in 2016 as \ninvestment in the sector declined (Figure 3.3.1). \n\nOn the demand side, a 6.0% rise in consumption, including \n\na 7.2% gain in private consumption, boosted expansion. \nAlso\u00a0supporting growth were a 2.6% pickup in investment as \ncapital projects expanded and a sharp 41.6% rise in net exports, \nre\ufb02ecting stronger demand in Georgia\u2019s main trading partners.\nAverage in\ufb02ation accelerated to 6.0% from 2.1% in 2016, \nre\ufb02ecting higher excise taxes and import prices, faster growth, \nand the lagged effects of currency depreciation in\u00a02016. \nPrices\u00a0rose notably for alcoholic beverages and tobacco \nby\u00a017.1%, transport 15.1%, and food 6.8%. The year-on-year \nin\ufb02ation rate in December was 6.7%, up from 1.8% a year \nearlier (Figure\u00a03.3.2). In February 2018, annual in\ufb02ation slowed \nto\u00a02.7%.\n\nFiscal policy remained expansionary in 2017 despite curbs \n\non current spending. The budget de\ufb01cit narrowed to 0.9% \nof GDP from 1.4% in 2016, as tax collections that exceeded \nexpectations and current outlays that fell short created room \nto expand capital expenditure while containing public debt \n(Figure 3.3.3). Revenue rose to the equivalent of 28.7% of GDP \nfrom 28.4% in 2016. Expenditure was 29.6% of GDP, versus \n29.8% in 2016.

The National Bank of \nGeorgia, the central bank, raised the policy rate by 0.75 \npercentage points to 7.25% in two steps toward the end of \n2017 to restrain in\ufb02ation caused by unexpectedly vigorous \nexpansion. Higher\u00a0interest rates helped slow broad money \ngrowth to 14.8% from 20.2% in 2016, as private credit grew \nby\u00a015.6% (Figure\u00a03.3.4). \n\nThe Georgian lari fell by another 6.0% against the \nUS\u00a0dollar and 8.2% against the euro in 2017. It depreciated \nby 2.4% in nominal effective terms and by 2.2% in real terms \n(Figure\u00a03.3.5), improving competitiveness and boosting exports. \nHowever, the lari started appreciating in early 2018.\n\nBanks remained pro\ufb01table and well capitalized as the \ncentral bank stiffened minimum capital requirements and \nstarted requiring banks to hold enough liquid assets to pass \na stress test. Bank pro\ufb01ts rose by 5.6%, and nonperforming \nloans remained below 4.0%. A central bank program to reduce \ndollarization helped cut foreign currency loans to 58.4% of \nthe total from 63.9% at the end of 2016 and decrease foreign \ncurrency deposits to 63.6% from 69.8% a year earlier, thereby \nboosting growth in domestic currency deposits (Figure 3.3.6). \nMonetary tightening pushed the average lending rate to 16.2% \nfrom 14.4% in 2016, while the average deposit rate was little \nchanged at 4.8% (Figure 3.3.7). A new deposit insurance system \ntook effect at the start of 2018.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to the equivalent of \n\n9.0% of GDP from 12.8% in 2016 thanks to strong growth in \nexports of goods and tourism-related services. Exports rose \nby 29.1%, and 9.4% growth in imports re\ufb02ected hefty foreign \ndirect investment. Although tourism boosted service receipts \nby 30.0%, the repatriation of higher pro\ufb01ts and dividends \nweakened the income account. Remittance earnings rose by \n19.8% to $1.4 billion. Gross reserves increased to $3.1 billion \nfrom $2.8 billion in 2016, including central bank purchases of \n$130 million. Public and publicly guaranteed external debt fell \nto the equivalent of 33.1% of GDP at the end of 2017 from 35.2% \na year earlier. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to decelerate to 4.5% in 2018, with slower \ngrowth in services, and then rise to 4.7% in 2019 on higher \nconsumption, public investment, and net exports (Figure 3.3.8). \nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand by 5.4% in \n2018 and 5.8% in 2019, with strong growth in construction \nand a rebound in utilities. Services are projected to grow by \n4.5% in 2018 and 4.8% in 2019 on further gains in tourism \nand \ufb01nance.

Tourism comprises 53% of all service exports, with \nmore sophisticated categories such as information and \ncomputer services providing only a small share. \n\nWhile Georgia has relatively well-developed traditional \nservices for travel and transport, thanks to its booming tourist \ntrade, it needs to diversify into higher-value exports such as \nbusiness, information, and computer services.

Strong ICT can boost productivity in the service \nsector and help create high-value jobs by providing readily \naccessible electronic services. \n\nGeorgia would bene\ufb01t from better connectivity and \nimproved education, as greater computerization and a highly \neducated and skilled workforce are essential for developing \nhigher value products and services. Also helpful would be \nexport promotion agencies and programs to expand the ability \nof \ufb01rms to export through improvements in knowledge, \nproductivity, and technology skills. In addition, programs that \n\ufb01ll gaps in trade \ufb01nancing and make resources available to \nexport-oriented \ufb01rms can help meet the need for \ufb01nancing in a \nmore contemporary service sector. \n\n\fKazakhstan\n\nGrowth  rebounded  to  4.0%  in  2017  on  sharply  higher  oil  and  mineral  production. \nExchange  rate  stability  trimmed  inflation  to  7.4%,  and  export  growth  halved  the  current \naccount  deficit  to  3.0%  of  GDP.  More  moderate  expansion  in  industry,  despite  further \ngains  in  oil  and  mineral  output,  is  projected  to  slow  growth  to  3.2%  in  2018  and  3.5% \nin\u00a02019. Inflation will ease further if higher oil export prices keep the exchange rate stable. \nExpanding  the  private  sector  would  promote  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth recovered in 2017, most noticeably in the \ufb01rst half, \nwhen economic activity rose by 4.3% over weak performance \nin the \ufb01rst half of the previous year. Growth continued but at \na slower pace in the second half, averaging 4.0% for the entire \nyear, up from 1.1% in 2016. \n\nOn the supply side, industry, excluding construction, \npropelled growth, rising by 7.1% after a 0.4% decline in 2016 \n(Figure 3.4.1). By\u00a0subsector, oil production rose by 10.5% on \nhigher prices and expansion at the Kashagan \ufb01eld, and coal \noutput rose by 6.0%, iron ore by 6.9%, and other minerals by \n8.2%. Manufacturing grew by 5.1%, with metallurgy up\u00a05.9%, \nfood processing 4.1%, re\ufb01ned oil 5.1%, chemicals 7.2%, \nmachinery 5.6%, and construction materials 3.7%. Meanwhile, \nservices revived from 0.9% growth in 2016 to 2.7%, with \ntrade up 3.2%, transport and logistics 4.8%, and \ufb01nance 0.5%. \nConstruction growth slowed steeply to 1.9% from 7.4% in 2016 \nwith the completion of Expo 2017 in Astana and re\ufb01nery plant \nmodi\ufb01cations, and despite the continuation of programs to \nbuild infrastructure and housing and to expand oil production. \nGrowth in agriculture almost halved to 2.9% from 5.4% as \nexpansion in crop production slowed to 2.2% from 7.5% in 2016. \nLivestock production, by contrast, rose by 3.9%, up from 2.8% \na\u00a0year earlier.\n\nOn the demand side, data for the \ufb01rst 9 months of the year \nshowed signi\ufb01cantly higher net exports as the main source of \ngrowth.

Prices rose \nby 8.6% for food, 8.4% for other goods, and 5.1% for services. \nThe year-on-year in\ufb02ation rate in December 2017 was 7.1% \n(Figure 3.4.2), re\ufb02ecting a rise of 8.9% for goods other than \nfood, including sharp increases for diesel fuel at 31.8%, gasoline \n17.6%, coal 14.9%, and lique\ufb01ed gas 8.6%. Large price hikes for \nvegetables and meat raised food prices by 6.5%, while increases \nfor utilities, road and air transportation, and miscellaneous \nitems boosted prices for services by 5.9%. \n\nFiscal policy supported growth, as the government \n\nmaintained development programs for infrastructure, housing, \nand agriculture while allocating funds equal to 4.6% of GDP \nto support a large troubled bank. State budget revenue equaled \n22.4% of GDP, re\ufb02ecting a 13.1% rise in tax revenue and a 54.6% \nincrease in transfers from the National Fund of the Republic of \nKazakhstan, the sovereign wealth fund, in part to support the \ndomestic banking system. Budget expenditure rose by nearly \na third to equal 25.2% of GDP, re\ufb02ecting outlays for bank \nrecapitalization and increases for wages and salaries, state \npensions, and education and training programs. The budget \nde\ufb01cit equaled 2.8% of GDP, up from 1.6% in 2016. Public debt \nreached 25.7% of GDP, with external debt at 8.9% of GDP \n(Figure 3.4.3).\n\nMonetary policy targeted in\ufb02ation while maintaining a \n\ufb02exible exchange rate. As in\ufb02ation came within the 6%\u20138% \ntarget, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, the central bank, \nreduced the base interest rate from 12.00% to 10.25% in three \nsteps from February to August. It\u00a0maintained this rate for the \nrest of 2017, despite greater pressure on the exchange rate and \nhigher in\ufb02ation in the second half, but reduced it to 9.75% in \nJanuary 2018 and 9.50% in March. The central bank intervened \nperiodically in 2017 to limit exchange rate volatility, injecting \n$620.5 million and helping limit dollarization to 48%\u201350% \nof the deposit base (Figure 3.4.4). It provided to \ufb01ve large \nbanks the equivalent of 1.3% of GDP to boost their capital and \nstrengthen the \ufb01nancial sector, providing subordinated debt \nconvertible into central bank shares. Broad\u00a0money contracted \nby 1.7% during the year, re\ufb02ecting a small decline in total \ncredit (Figure 3.4.5). The central bank reported nonperforming \nloans to have risen from 6.7% of all loans at the start of 2017 to \n9.3% at the end of the year.

Growth is forecast to \nslow to 3.2% in 2018 as expansion in industry moderates and \nthen improve to 3.5% in 2019 with slightly faster growth in \ncapital formation and construction (Figure 3.4.8). \n\nOn the supply side, industry is projected to grow by 5.0% \nin 2018 and 4.5% in 2019, driven by oil production and mining. \nSome support will come from the government\u2019s industrialization \npolicy and measures to promote manufacturing to make the \nsubsector more competitive and achieve wider diversi\ufb01cation. \nConstruction will bene\ufb01t from state programs and is likely \nto expand by 3.6% in 2018 and 4.2% in 2019. Agriculture is \nprojected to grow by 3.0% in both years thanks to government \nefforts to raise productivity, diversify crop production, boost \nlivestock, and promote exports of processed agricultural goods. \nServices growth is forecast at 2.5% in 2018 and 3.0% in 2019, \nwith greater business activity supporting transport, logistics, \ntrade, and real\u00a0estate. \n\nOn the demand side, small wage increases are expected to \n\nlimit expansion in private consumption to 2.2% in 2018 and \n2.6% in 2019. Government efforts at \ufb01scal consolidation will \nlimit growth in public consumption to 1.0% in both years. \nHowever, government programs to boost manufacturing and \nestablish a digital economy should raise investment by 5.0% \nin\u00a02018 and 6.0% in 2019. Net exports in real terms are forecast \nto grow by 8.0% in 2018 and 6.0% in 2019, as higher oil exports \nand government policies to promote exports other than oil \nshould help growth in exports outpace imports.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to slow to 6.8% in 2018 and 6.2% \nin 2019, assuming a stable exchange rate, with the 12-month \nin\ufb02ation rate to December falling to 6.2% in both years \n(Figure\u00a03.4.9). Food price in\ufb02ation is expected to ease to 7.5% in \n2018 and 6.5% in 2019 thanks to government action to control \nthe prices of critical foodstuffs, as well as its stabilization \nfunds and measures to support domestic food production. \nGovernment efforts to prevent fuel shortages, limit monopoly \npricing, and support competition are likely to slow price \nincreases for other goods to 8.0% in 2018 and 7.0% in 2019 and \nto limit in\ufb02ation in services to 5.0% each year. \n\nFiscal policy over the next 2 years is expected to be less \nexpansionary, with the budget de\ufb01cit falling to the equivalent \n\n3.4.6\u2002 Foreign currency reserves  \nand oil fund assets\n\nAssets of the national oil fund\nGross international reserves\nTotal international assets\n\n$ billion\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.4.7\u2002External debt\n\nExternal debt\nDebt excluding  \nintercompany loans\n\n% of GDP\n\nExchange rate\n\nT/$\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSources: National Bank of Kazakhstan; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.4.8\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fMonetary policy over the next 2 years is expected to focus \n\n3.4.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n144(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nof 1.1% of GDP in 2018 and 1.0% in 2019 as the non-oil de\ufb01cit \nnarrows to 7.1% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019. Discretionary \ntargeted transfers to the budget from the sovereign wealth \nfund will be eliminated in 2018, and, to conserve fund assets \nand promote \ufb01scal consolidation, the annual guaranteed \ntransfer will be scaled back from the current $8 billion to \n$6\u00a0billion in 2020. A new tax code that took effect early \nin\u00a02018 aims to collect more taxes by improving administrative \nprocedures, reducing distortions, and creating a more \npredictable tax environment, while providing support to small \nand medium-sized enterprises, agriculture, and geological \nexploration for petroleum and mineral wealth. A study by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s predicted that the new tax code would \nbroaden the tax base and increase revenues by an estimated \n3.0% of GDP. With sovereign wealth fund transfers shrinking, \nrevenue is forecast to equal 18.0% of GDP in 2018 and 17.7% \nin 2019. Expenditure is forecast at 19.1% of GDP in 2018 and \n18.7% in 2019, with no further outlays for bank recapitalization \nbut continued spending on industrialization, infrastructure, \nhousing, and agriculture.

Broad money growth is projected at \n2.0% annually, as efforts to drain excess liquidity will limit \nthe expansion of credit to the private sector. Exchange rate \npolicy will likely aim to limit volatility using targeted market \ninterventions. The extent of nonperforming loans will probably \nremain substantial and continue to constrain lending. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen to equal \n\n3.3% of GDP in 2018 and 3.4% in 2019 as recovering private \nconsumption boosts imports (Figure 3.4.10). Exports are \nprojected to grow by 9.0% in 2018 on higher oil prices and, \nwith somewhat lower prices in 2019, by 5.0% that year as \noperations at Kashagan continue to boost oil production and \nmanufacturing exports grow steadily. Imports are forecast to \nexpand by 9.1% in 2018 and 11.1% in 2019 on higher domestic \ndemand and likely currency depreciation caused by lower oil \nprices in 2019, which will expand the de\ufb01cit on services as\u00a0well. \nThe de\ufb01cit in the income account is expected to widen by \n14.0% in 2018, as higher oil prices boost pro\ufb01t repatriation, and \nnarrow by 3.2% in 2019, as oil prices decline. Net international \nreserves are projected to reach $31.3 billion in 2018 and \n$32.4\u00a0billion in 2019, while sovereign wealth fund assets rise \nto $59.5 billion at the end of 2018 and $60.7 billion a year later, \nre\ufb02ecting smaller transfers to the budget.

The new development strategy prioritizes the \nprivatization of state-owned enterprises and the development \nof public\u2013private partnership (PPP) to support private sector \nexpansion and sustain higher GDP growth.\n\nThe government aims to reduce its share of output, \n\nincluding value added by public enterprises, from the current \n18% of GDP to 15% by the end of 2020, and to boost the \nGDP share of small and medium-sized enterprises from its \ncurrent\u00a027%. Since the start of the privatization effort in 2016, \nthe government has sold 367 entities with a combined value \nof $500 million, and it aims to privatize 900 entities by 2020. \nMost\u00a0valuable will be components of the state-owned Samruk-\nKazyna holding company that are functional monopolies or \nface limited competition, including shares in the national \nrailway, oil and gas \ufb01elds, airlines, and energy and metal \nproducers. Privatization is an important element of ongoing \nstructural reform, as it attracts new foreign direct investment \noutside the oil sector and supports capital market development \nif pursued transparently and efficiently. \n\nThe government also plans to support private activity \nthrough PPP. This modality has traditionally been used to \nleverage \ufb01scal resources by sharing the costs of infrastructure \nprojects with private \ufb01rms in areas where they can bring \nexpertise and innovation. In Kazakhstan, such projects \nare intended to save budget resources while supporting \nthe development of private \ufb01rms. PPP activity is currently \nlimited, however, comprising 116 contracts with a total value \nof $430 million. Most are in education, with 45 contracts, and \nhealthcare, with 27. The government is considering new PPP \nprojects worth $5.2 billion, equal to 3.2% of GDP. They will \ninclude the recently agreed, long-standing project to construct \na new ring road around Almaty. \n\nThe success of PPP will depend on creating an enabling \n\nenvironment by undertaking bankable projects through \na transparent bidding and selection process. In addition, \nan efficient risk-sharing framework must be created to \nallow private \ufb01rms to secure their rights through contract \nenforcement and efficient dispute resolution. Also needed is a \nway to monitor and assess project performance and terminate \n\n\f146(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nprojects as needed. This will require an appropriate legal and \nregulatory environment, supportive advisory services, and \ngreater capacity in government to execute long-term contracts \nand manage operational risks, including uncertainty. \n\nEstablishing an enabling environment will allow PPPs \n\nto provide a wide range of investment projects that the \ngovernment cannot undertake alone as it pursues \ufb01scal \nconsolidation. However, success will depend on developing \ncapital markets and the rest of the \ufb01nancial system\u2014in \nparticular domestic capital markets, the weakness of which \nremains a key obstacle to economic growth. Access to \ufb01nance \nremains limited, with the extent of \ufb01nancial intermediation \nnarrow and its sophistication low. Sizable nonperforming \nloans further limit credit availability. An efficient banking \nsector requires better supervisory and regulatory enforcement. \nPrivate\u00a0sector expansion will thus require \ufb01nancial deepening \nand a wider range of \ufb01nancial services to fund private \ninvestment.\n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nGrowth improved to 4.6% from 4.3% in 2016, reflecting gains in industry, along with higher \ngovernment  spending  and  remittance  earnings.  Inflation  accelerated  to  3.2%,  and  the \ncurrent account deficit narrowed to 4.8% of GDP from 11.6% in 2016. Growth is projected \nto  moderate  to  3.5%  in  2018  before  recovering  to  4.0%  in  2019.  The  government  is \npromoting  economic  diversification  through  digitalization.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth accelerated to 4.6% from 4.3% in 2016 as strong gains \nin industry offset slower growth in services and agriculture \n(Figure\u00a03.5.1). On the supply side, industry expanded by 9.3%, \nup from 7.1% in 2016, with large increases of 78.4% in mining, \n7.6% in manufacturing, and 10.1% in electricity generation. \nGrowth in construction slowed to 7.1% from 9.3% in 2016, \ndespite slightly faster growth in \ufb01xed capital investment, \nmostly in construction for mining, energy generation, and \ntransport. Agriculture expanded by 2.2%, less than the 2.9% \nrise in 2016, with crops up by 2.5% and animal husbandry \nby 2.0%. Services rose by 2.6%, down from 3.4% in 2016, as \ngrowth in wholesale and retail trade slowed to 3.5% from 8.0% \na year earlier. \n\nOn the demand side, growth found support from higher \npublic consumption and investment linked to election spending \nand a modest rise in private consumption that re\ufb02ected a 24% \nimprovement in remittance earnings (Figure 3.5.2).\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation accelerated to 3.2% from 0.4% in 2016, \nwhile the year-on-year in\ufb02ation rate to December reached 3.7% \n(Figure\u00a03.5.3). Higher in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ected price increases of 2.7% \nfor food, 4.0% for alcoholic beverages, 3.2% for other goods, \nand 6.9% for services. In\ufb02ation would likely have been higher if \nthe average value of the Kyrgyz som against the US dollar had \nnot appreciated by 1.5% during the year (Figure 3.5.4). \n\nThe government managed to narrow the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nto 3.2% of GDP from 4.4% in 2016 despite election-related \nspending.

It kept the policy interest rate at 5.0%. The average \ndeposit interest rate declined by 0.2 percentage points to 4.4%, \nwhile the average lending rate fell by 2.1 percentage points to \n16.2%. Deposits rose by 10.4% and credit by 13.1%, while broad \nmoney grew by 17.9%, slightly more than the 14.6% growth in \n2016. At\u00a0the end of 2017, the incidence of nonperforming loans \nwas 7.6%, down from 8.8% in 2016. However, dollarization \nremained extensive at the end of 2017, with 39.5% of loans and \n49.8% of deposits in foreign currency.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is estimated to have narrowed \n\nto 4.8% from 11.6% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting some improvement in \nthe trade balance. Trade rose by 12.5% as exports expanded \nby 14.4% on gains in gold and agricultural products, and \nas higher demand for oil products, construction materials, \ntextiles, and consumer goods lifted imports by\u00a011.4%. By the \nend of 2017, international reserves had risen by $0.2\u00a0billion to \nreach $2.2\u00a0billion, or cover for 4.4 months of imports. With a \ndecline in private debt and currency appreciation, external debt \nincluding government-guaranteed and private debt is estimated \nto have fallen to equal 94.9% of GDP at the end of 2017, down \nsigni\ufb01cantly from 103.2% a year earlier (Figure 3.5.5).\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is projected to slow to 3.5% in 2018, re\ufb02ecting an \nexpected decline in output from the Kumtor, the main mine in \nthe important gold-mining industry (Figure 3.5.6). Recovery \nto 4.0% is expected in 2019 with some improvement in the \ndomestic economy and continued growth in the region.\nOn the supply side, growth should come from agro-\nprocessing, light industry, and, to some extent, construction. \nOn the demand side, higher remittances will raise household \nincomes, bolstering private consumption. Over the longer term, \nthe country should bene\ufb01t from increased foreign trade and \nthe free movement of labor, capital, and services provided by \nmembership in the Eurasian Economic Union\u00a0(EEU). \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to accelerate to 4.0% in 2018 and 4.5% \n\nin\u00a02019 with continued growth and higher tariffs required \nby EEU membership. However, in\ufb02ation could worsen with \ndepreciation of the som in response to weakness in the \ncurrencies of Kazakhstan and the Russian\u00a0Federation.\nThe central bank is expected to maintain a \ufb02exible \nexchange rate and continue to limit interventions to smooth \nexcessive exchange rate volatility. Monetary policy will likely \nstay focused on maintaining price stability in view of the \nexpected rise in in\ufb02ation. \n\n3.5.3\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nOther\n\n% change year on year\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\nSom/$\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 14 March 2018). \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.4\u2002Exchange rate\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 5 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.5\u2002External debt\n\nPrivate\nGovernment\n\n% of GDP\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Government debt is both government and \ngovernment-guaranteed debt.\nSources: Ministry of Finance; National Statistics \nCommittee. http://www.stat.kg; National Bank of the \nKyrgyz Republic. http://www.nbkr.kg (both accessed \n20\u00a0February 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKyrgyz Republic\u2002\u2002149\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is expected to widen to 12.0% \n\n3.5.6\u2002GDP growth\n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected to narrow to equal 2.5% of \nGDP in\u00a02018 and 2019 as the government restrains expenditure \nwhile improving tax policy and administration. Tax revenue \ncould rise if EEU accession yields more customs revenue \nthan now forecast. Fiscal consolidation remains a priority to \nrebuild government \ufb01nances and ensure debt sustainability. \nConsolidation will likely involve rationalizing expenditure by \nreforming public wages, cutting subsidies, and improving the \ntargeting of the social bene\ufb01ts. The government aims to raise \nrevenue as well by broadening the tax base and strengthening \ntax and customs administration. External public debt is \nprojected to equal 55.0% of GDP at the end of 2018 and 56.0% \na\u00a0year later.\n\nin 2018 and then narrow to 10.0% in 2019 (Figure 3.5.7). \nExport\u00a0growth is projected to slow to 8.0% in 2018 with lower \ngold exports and then recover to 14.0% in 2019 with higher \nexports of agricultural products and textiles. Infrastructure \nprojects are expected to boost imports by 12.0% in 2018 \nand 11.0% in 2019. Remittances will likely rise by a further \n25%\u201330% in 2018 and 2019, re\ufb02ecting advantages to Kyrgyz \nmigrant workers from the EEU treaty. International reserves \nare forecast to remain at $2.2 billion in 2018 and reach \n$2.3\u00a0billion at the end of 2019. The outlook for exports and \nthe current account balance could worsen with weak demand \nfrom EEU trade partners and because of Kyrgyz products\u2019 poor \ncompliance with EEU veterinary and agricultural standards. \nWhile debt sustainability has improved, vulnerability to \n\nexternal and domestic risks persists. The Kyrgyz Republic \nis considered at moderate risk of debt distress because of \ncontinuing vulnerabilities regarding currency stability and \npossible deterioration in the \ufb01scal balance. With\u00a0public \nexternal debt now equal to 56% of GDP, total external debt \ncould, barring shocks, be less than 96% of GDP by the end \nof\u00a02019. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting \ndiversi\ufb01cation through digitalization\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is a small, landlocked country with \nlimited natural resources and a narrow economic base. \nWorker\u00a0remittances and gold exports have been its main \nincome sources. Remittances from Kazakhstan and the \nRussian\u00a0Federation have averaged about 25% of GDP during \nthe past 5 years, while gold production has been estimated to \nprovide on average 8.7% of GDP and 30% of export earnings. \nWith\u00a0limited opportunities for growth in these areas, the \nKyrgyz Republic needs to diversify its economy and \ufb01nd new \nincome sources. \n\n3.5.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n\u2002\u20023.5\n\n\u2002\u20024.0\n\n\u201312.0\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20024.0\n\n\u2002\u20024.5\n\n\u201310.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 14 March 2018); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.7\u2002Current account balance\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 14 March 2018); \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f150(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nA key obstacle to further development has been the country\u2019s \nlack of advanced business facilities, including poor connectivity. \nAccording to the Global Competitiveness Report 2017\u20132018, \nin which the Kyrgyz Republic ranks 102 out of 137 countries, \nit ranks particularly low in innovation at 127 and business \nsophistication at 126. It also lags in technological readiness at \n102 and infrastructure at 109. With\u00a0technological innovation \ndramatically reshaping the global environment and information \n\ufb02ows becoming increasingly important, improving the country\u2019s \npoor digital environment is essential for developing new sources \nof income and employment. \n\nTo respond to these challenges, the government introduced \nthe Taza Koom program of support for sustainable development \nthrough\u00a0digitalization and innovation. It involves creating a \ncountrywide \ufb01ber-optic network to improve internet access in \neven the most remote areas, increase digital transactions, and \nstrengthen public service delivery to communities and \ufb01rms. \nThe\u00a0goal is to encourage a shift toward higher-tech and innovative \nactivities that can support better-paying jobs. The\u00a0program aims \nto improve public administration and the delivery of services \nsuch\u00a0as education and health care, heighten transparency in the \npublic sphere to \ufb01ght corruption (as the name suggests), and \nreduce the transaction costs that \ufb01rms incur to meet registration \nand other regulatory requirements and to pay taxes.\n\nTaza Koom\u2019s current action plan covers the year beginning in \n\nAugust\u00a02017. It includes projects on information infrastructure, \ncyber security to enable a cashless economy, and the streamlined \ndelivery of services by regional and municipal governments. Its \ndigital infrastructure project is laying \ufb01ber-optic lines, expanding \naccess to mobile high-speed internet and the applications \navailable, and providing means to achieve a more fault-tolerant \nnetwork with improved data transmission. Another project aims \nto ensure the availability of information in multiple languages, \nincluding Kyrgyz. \n\nWhile the Taza Koom program has the potential to advance \n\ndiversi\ufb01cation through digitalization, additional measures would \nhelp achieve this goal.\n\nOne would be to accelerate reform to improve the business \n\nclimate by addressing problems with contract enforcement, \nreliable electricity supply, resolving insolvency, and paying taxes\u2014\nall areas where the country ranks especially low, at\u00a0100 or worse \namong 190 countries covered in the most recent World Bank \nDoing Business survey.\n\nOthers would be to improve the management of public \ninvestment, encourage private investors to \ufb01ll supply gaps in \ninfrastructure for energy and other areas, and increase job \ntraining so that workers can satisfy the skills requirements of new \njobs. Also helpful would be reform to trade policies that would \nmaximize bene\ufb01ts from preferential arrangements accorded by \nthe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trading partners.\n\n\fTajikistan\n\nGrowth  rose  to  7.1%  in  2017  as  the  external  environment  strengthened  and  public \ninvestment  continued.  Inflation  accelerated  to  6.7%.  Lower  imports  and  higher  exports \nand  remittances  moved  the  current  account  into  surplus.  Growth  is  projected  to  slow  to \n6.0%  in  2018  with  tighter  fiscal  policy  and  continued  weakness  in  banking,  recovering  to \n6.5%  in  2019.  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  likely  return  the  current  account  to  a \ndeficit.  Tajikistan  needs  to  expand  productive  employment. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth accelerated to 7.1% from 6.9% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting higher \nexports and remittances as conditions improved abroad and \nambitious public investment continued (Figure 3.6.1). \n\nOn the supply side, industry growth accelerated to 21.3% \nfrom 16.0% in 2016 with gains in mining at 22.5%, manufacturing \n22.7%, and electricity generation 16.7% (Figure\u00a03.6.2). Aluminum \nproduction plunged by 22.0% because input supplies were unstable \nand production facilities were under renovation. Gold extraction \nincreased by 11.2%. Agriculture rose by 6.8%, up from 5.2% in 2016 \nas favorable weather and additional cultivated area boosted cotton \nproduction by 35.8%. Higher remittances increased disposable \nincome by 10.0% and retail trade by 6.6%, reversing the service \nsector\u2019s 0.3% contraction in 2016 with 1.8% growth.\n\nOn the demand side, higher public spending helped expand \n\ninvestment by 4.1%, while private consumption rose by 2.4%. \nNet\u00a0exports improved by 8.6% as higher output and external \ndemand boosted exports while import substitution further \nreduced imports. \n\nIn\ufb02ation accelerated to 6.7% from 6.1% in 2016 as bank \nrecapitalization fueled liquidity despite tight monetary policy \n(Figure\u00a03.6.3). Prices rose by 7.7% for food, 4.4% for other goods, \nand 7.7% for services. Continued depreciation of the Tajik somoni \nby 12% fueled in\ufb02ation, as did a 15% hike in average electricity \ntariffs in October. Flat global food prices and slow credit growth \nkept in\ufb02ation from rising faster. \n\nFiscal policy aimed to contain current spending, though \nhigher infrastructure outlays and weak revenues widened the \nbudget de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP from 1.7% in\u00a02016 \n(Figure\u00a03.6.4). Revenue\u00a0equaled 31.0% of GDP, down from \n32.1% in 2016 as further declines in imports caused shortfalls \nin collections of value-added tax, excises, and customs duties\u2014\ndespite better tax administration.

Public \nand publicly guaranteed external debt jumped to 40.3% of GDP \nfrom 32.7% in 2016 because of currency depreciation and new \nborrowing, in particular a $500 million eurobond offering to \n\ufb01nance a major infrastructure project (Box\u00a03.6.1). Domestic \ndebt reached 11.1% of GDP as troubled banks were shored up \nwith Treasury securities issued in exchange for assets. With \npublic debt breaching several indicative limits, the International \nMonetary Fund decided in November 2017 to reclassify \nTajikistan\u2019s debt distress level from low to high. \n\nMonetary policy aimed to limit currency depreciation and \n\ncombat in\ufb02ation. To stem depreciation, the National Bank \nof Tajikistan, the central bank, restrained money growth \nwhile continuing to require that all remittances in rubles be \nconverted to somoni and that banks immediately sell to it half \nof the rubles converted. Moreover, in February 2017, all Tajiks \nwere required to register their foreign accounts. To mitigate \nexpectations of devaluation, the central bank uni\ufb01ed official \nand market exchange rates on 24 May 2017. It liberalized gold \ntrading domestically while tightening foreign exchange controls. \nThese\u00a0measures helped stabilize the exchange rate after May and \nreduce the share of deposits in foreign currency from 62.5% at \nthe end of 2016 to 56.6% a year later. \n\nTo curb in\ufb02ation, the central bank raised its re\ufb01nancing \nrate from 11.0% to 12.5% in February 2017 and again to 16.0% \nin March, when it also increased reserve requirements and \nthe interest rate on liquidity support loans. The authorities \nexpanded sales of central bank securities and Treasury bills to \nthe equivalent of 12.4% of GDP, up from 7.9% in 2016, to sterilize \nthe impact on liquidity of the ruble conversion requirement \nand bank recapitalization. The central bank introduced new \nmonetary policy instruments, including overnight and intraday \nlending facilities and overnight deposits. In a move toward \nin\ufb02ation targeting, it established a medium-term in\ufb02ation goal of \n7% \u00b12 percentage points, while improving its communication of \nmonetary policy decisions. \n\nas credit to the private sector plunged by 18.8% because of \nweak demand for loans, \ufb01nancial sector difficulties, and a \nsharp slowdown from 71% to 21% in the growth of reserve \nmoney, meaning currency in circulation plus bank reserves \n(Figure\u00a03.6.5). Nonperforming loans fell from 54.0% of the \ntotal at the end of 2016 to 36.5% a year later. The average \nreturn on assets improved to 0.4% from \u201328% in 2016, and on \nequity to 1.5% from \u201320.7% (Figure 3.6.6). Higher minimum \ncapital requirements and stronger supervision cut the number \nof micro\ufb01nance organizations by\u00a07.7%. Meanwhile, two large \nsystemic banks remained troubled despite having received a \n5-year government loan in 2016 to bolster their capital; resolution \nplans have yet to be approved.\n\n3.6.1\u2002 Tajikistan\u2019s $500 million \n\neurobond \ufb01nancing for the \nRogun hydropower project \n\nTajikistan started the \n3,600-megawatt Rogun hydropower \nproject in the 1980s, but the \ncollapse of the Soviet\u00a0Union halted \nconstruction, and debates postponed \nits resumption for many years. \nThe\u00a0government views the project \nas crucial to resolving Tajikistan\u2019s \nwinter electricity de\ufb01cit and turning \nthe country into a regional energy \nsupplier. Recent project assessments \nhave concluded that Rogun would \nmeet international efficiency \nstandards with some design \nmodi\ufb01cations, including measures \nto mitigate adverse environmental \neffects. A\u00a0contract for $3.9 billion to \nbuild the project was approved in \nJuly 2016, and construction restarted \nin October\u00a02016. \n\nWith limited \ufb01scal resources, \nthe government decided to \ufb01nance \nthe project in part through an \ninitial issue of $500 million in \neurobonds, which required obtaining \na sovereign credit rating.

Growth is expected to recover to 6.5% \nin 2019 on gains in manufacturing and mining, higher remittances, \nand the expanded replacement of imports with local alternatives. \nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand in 2018 and \n2019 as construction on the Rogun hydropower project continues \nand mining posts gains. In addition, the opening of the Tajik \nsegment of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China should expand manufacturing. Agriculture is \nexpected to rise modestly, barring an unusually dry winter. Higher \nremittances should boost services moderately.\n\nOn the demand side, consumption should expand, re\ufb02ecting \n\nhigher remittances and expected hikes in public sector wages. \nHowever, \ufb01scal consolidation and weak credit expansion will \nlimit growth in investment.

Weak demand and \ncontinued high nonperforming loans should limit growth in \nprivate credit. The central bank may adjust the re\ufb01nancing rate \nif needed to contain in\ufb02ation. With a more \ufb02exible exchange \nrate to support in\ufb02ation targeting, rate changes can do more to \nabsorb external shocks, albeit at the cost of greater \ufb02uctuation. \nDespite expectations of higher remittances (Figure 3.6.9), \n\nthe current account surplus is forecast to narrow to 1.1% of \nGDP in 2018 and return to a de\ufb01cit in 2019, at 3.0%, as higher \nspending on the Rogun hydropower project worsens the de\ufb01cit \nin services (Figure 3.6.10).

Even with efforts at import \nsubstitution, imports are expected to grow by 5.0% in 2018 \nand 10.0% in 2019, powered by further gains in remittances \nand higher capital spending. With imports recovering and \nconstruction of the Rogun project accelerating, little increase \nin gross international reserves is expected. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting productive \nemployment \nDespite average growth of 7.2% from 1997 through 2016, \nTajikistan is not creating enough jobs. Annually from 1991 \nto 2016, the working-age population increased by 3.0% but \nemployment rose by only 0.7%. Economic growth has come \nlargely from improved labor productivity and higher domestic \nconsumption \ufb01nanced by remittances from Tajik migrant \nworkers. Meanwhile, large-scale labor migration not only \nboosted household income and purchasing power but also took \nthe spotlight off domestic job creation. \n\nSince 2013, both labor migration and remittances have \nfallen signi\ufb01cantly, despite some recovery in 2017, heightening \npressure to create jobs for young entrants into the labor \nmarket and returning migrant workers.

A further 233,000 jobs are needed \nfor the working poor whose current incomes fall below the \npoverty line. Providing these jobs will require upgrades to current \nemployment through productivity gains from on-the-job training \nand workplace reorganization, along with workers shifting to new \nand more productive jobs elsewhere in the economy. \n\nRemittances are currently forecast to rise. If migrants begin \nreturning again at the rate observed in 2016, however, additional \njobs will be needed to meet the poverty objective. The estimates \nlast year, which did not directly address the impact of returning \nmigrants, suggest that an additional 280,000 productive jobs \nare needed by 2025 to provide work for them. Because migrants \nearn more on average than domestic workers, replacing their \nprevious income would require creating an even larger number \nof productive jobs. \n\nTajikistan\u2019s National Development Strategy to 2030 lists \nproductive employment as a key objective, and steps have been \ntaken to expand jobs. The Decent Work Country Program, \n2015\u20132017 reportedly created 100,000 jobs annually, but mainly \nseasonal work in agriculture. Reform to the technical and \nvocational education and training system is currently upgrading \nfacilities, providing new competency-based curricula and \nlearning materials, developing an in-service teacher training \nplan, and strengthening sector management. To encourage \nself-employment, 2018 has been declared a year of tourism \ndevelopment and folk crafts.\n\nThe percentage of Tajikistan\u2019s population of working age \n\nis projected to continue rising to 2030. Bene\ufb01ting from this \ndemographic dividend requires structural reform to boost \ngrowth and create more high-quality jobs. This includes \nadditional measures to improve the business climate, such\u00a0as \nfurther reducing and consolidating the number of official bodies \nwith inspection powers, creating a healthier banking sector \nto facilitate lending, and streamlining procedures for issuing \nconstruction permits, paying taxes, and enforcing contracts. \nStrengthening local value chains and helping small and medium-\nsized enterprises improve their productivity and earnings can \nfurther promote productive employment. Assessing demand for \nvarious skills and using that information to improve job training \ncan match workforce skills to market demand.\n\nMeasures to raise educational attainment, improve training, \nand reform regulation would boost productivity, enabling \ufb01rms \nto pay higher wages. Additional infrastructure would also help, \nas would measures to improve the quality of education spending \nand outcomes. Clearing\u00a0administrative obstacles to economic \nactivity, such as requirements for multiple licenses and permits, \nwould support economic expansion and job creation. Finally, \nincentives are needed to promote job creation in the formal \nsector, perhaps by reviewing current taxes and labor regulations.\n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nGrowth  accelerated  to  6.5%  in  2017  from  6.2%  a  year  earlier,  with  higher  gas  production, \nexpansionary credit policy, and support for activity outside the large hydrocarbon economy. \nPrice  and  cash  controls  held  inflation  to  8.0%.  Improved  energy  prices  boosted  exports \nand  trimmed  the  current  account  deficit  to  11.5%  of  GDP.  Stable  growth  is  projected  this \nyear  and  next,  with  higher  energy  output.  Post-secondary  education  reform  is  crucial  for \neconomic  diversification.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported growth at 6.5% in 2017, up \nfrom 6.2% a year earlier, as hydrocarbon prices improved \nsomewhat in the second half of the year, having languished \nsince\u00a02014 (Figure\u00a03.7.1). Faster growth re\ufb02ected increased gas \nproduction, an expansionary credit policy for private \ufb01rms, and \nconsiderable government support for the economy aside from \nhydrocarbons to produce goods able to substitute for imports. \nOn the supply side, the hydrocarbon economy expanded \nby 4.3%, reversing 4.8% contraction in 2016, but growth came \nmainly from the non-hydrocarbon economy, which expanded \nby 7.4%, albeit less than the previous year\u2019s 11.5% increase. \nIndustry grew by 5.5%, up from 1.2% in\u00a02016 with better \nperformance in hydrocarbons (Figure 3.7.2).

While public investment expanded, \nits\u00a0share of GDP fell to 41% from 47% in 2016. \n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation was reported at 8.0% \n(Figure\u00a03.7.3).

Various reforms to education have been \nintroduced in recent years: substantial investments in \neducation infrastructure, higher outlays for education, the \ncreation of new higher education institutions, a transition to \ncompulsory 12-year education requiring the completion of \nsecondary school, and new learning programs and curricula \nat all levels to align the education system with international \nnorms. Turkmenistan is introducing a multitier system that \nawards bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees in conformity \nwith the Bologna Process, a series of European ministerial \nmeetings and agreements to ensure comparable standards for \nhigher-education quali\ufb01cations.\n\nHowever, great potential exists for further enhancement, \n\nespecially in higher education and technical and vocational \ntraining, to meet international standards and align graduates\u2019 \nknowledge and skills with the requirements of a more \ndiversi\ufb01ed economy. This is especially important because \nof rapid population growth and relatively high youth \nunemployment, most recently estimated by the International \nLabour Organization at 19.5% in 2015, re\ufb02ecting in part a skills \nmismatch between labor supply and demand. \n\nwell below the average of 26% in Central and West Asia and \n35% worldwide, as reported in the United Nation\u2019s Human \nDevelopment Report 2016 (Figure 3.7.9). According to a 2015 \nstudy by the European Training Foundation, about 5% of \nsecondary school graduates in Turkmenistan typically continue \nto local university, partly because places in state-funded \nuniversities are limited. Another 5% of graduates continue \nto vocational education and training. Some graduates seek \ntertiary education abroad, but many of these foreign-trained \nprofessionals choose to pursue careers abroad. \n\nSecondary school graduates thus dominate the domestic \n\nworkforce, whose expertise does not keep pace with \ntechnological change and innovation. Agriculture is the sector \nproviding the most employment, at 43.3% in 2016, but most \nof these jobs are low-skill and low-wage. Conditions for jobs \nin services, providing more than 30% of employment, are \nsimilar. Government plans to diversify the economy and foster \nprivate sector innovation highlight the importance of boosting \nworkforce skills and productivity through high-quality and \ninclusive education that is consistent with the needs of a \nmodern information economy.

Post-secondary education receives less than 15% of \nTurkmenistan\u2019s education spending and needs greater support. \n\nIncreased expenditure, both from government sources and \n\nthrough public\u2013private partnerships, should aim to improve \nthe quality, equity, and relevance of higher education and \nfocus on strengthening research and development to create \nknowledge and foster innovation. Vocational education must \nbe linked with labor market policies, employment services, \nand entrepreneurship. Also needed are stronger professional \ncollaboration with regional and international education \nnetworks and Turkmenistan\u2019s participation in international \nsurveys and rankings such as the Global Competitiveness Index, \nGlobal Innovation Index, and Human Capital Index.

The  current  account \nsurplus  reached  2.8%  of  GDP.  An  improving  external  outlook  is  expected  to  boost \nexports,  nudging  growth  to  5.5%  in  2018  and  5.6%  in  2019  as  inflation  stays  high  with \nanticipated wage, pension, and utility increases. Public financial management needs to be \nstrengthened.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported that growth slowed steeply to \n5.3% from 7.8% in 2016. This occurred as output and private \nconsumption moderated in the wake of a large devaluation \nin September to reconcile the official exchange rate with the \nparallel currency market. The devaluation cut the US dollar \nvalue of the Uzbek som by 48% as part of wide-ranging \nand unprecedented reform to remove price and exchange \nrate distortions, improve public services, and make official \nstatistics more transparent and reliable. Although necessary \nand long awaited, the reforms forced up prices and interest \nrates, triggering a credit crunch and moderating household \nconsumption.\n\n On the supply side, growth came mostly from services, \nwhich expanded by 6.9%, down from 9.3% in\u00a02016 (Figure\u00a03.8.1). \nWhile transport and communications accelerated to 8.9% from \n7.1% in 2016, slower growth in private consumption slashed \nexpansion in trade, food, and accommodation to 3.9% from \n13.4% in 2016. Growth in industry, excluding construction, \nmoderated to 4.6% from 5.0% a year earlier, with weaker \nmining and quarrying. Construction growth, hit by higher \nimport and credit costs, halved to 5.6% from 12.5% in 2016. \nExpansion in agriculture slowed to 2.0% from 6.6% in 2016 as \nprices for imported inputs nearly doubled in som terms, raising \nproduction costs and prices for purchasers. Meanwhile, the \ncheaper som and stronger growth in neighboring countries \nhelped reenergize external demand for fruit and vegetables, \nboosting total sales. \n\nOn the demand side, net exports and investment propelled \n\ngrowth, partly offsetting weaker consumption.

Foreign investment \nalso rose, reportedly by 28.3%, mostly into metallurgy and \npetrochemicals, including the construction of a large facility \nto process gas at Kandym in western Uzbekistan. A 15.0% rise \nin exports supported expansion, but growth in consumption \nslowed to 3.2% from 8.6% in\u00a02016 as private consumption \ndecelerated to 2.5% from 11.3% in 2016, offsetting a 5.7% rise in \ngovernment consumption. \n\nThe government reported in\ufb02ation soaring to an average \nof 14.4% in 2017 from 5.7% in 2016. Two factors contributed \nto the increase: the impact of devaluation on import prices \nand production costs and, statistically, an expanded list of \ngoods and services used to monitor prices and estimate the \nconsumer price index (CPI). In addition, the authorities have \nmade progress toward entering the enhanced General Data \nDissemination System, an International Monetary Fund \ninitiative (Box 3.8.1).\n\nFood prices rose by 15.9% as meat and poultry prices \njumped by 30%, contributing 6.5 percentage points to the CPI \nincrease. Other\u00a0goods rose by 16.0%, adding another 5.7 points. \nPrices for gasoline, most of it imported, rose by 39.7% in the \n12 months to November 2017, contributing 0.5 points. Rising \nproduction and debt-service costs prompted utilities to raise \ntariffs by 7.1%, adding 0.4 points. In response to rising prices, \nthe government established a special fund under the Ministry \nof Finance to procure critically needed goods and distribute \nthem to vulnerable groups. \n\nWhile detailed \ufb01scal data are not yet available, the \naugmented budget including the balance in the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development is expected to record a \nde\ufb01cit equal to around 3% of GDP in 2017. The weaker som \nstrained the balance sheets of major taxpayers, particularly \nstate-owned enterprises, prompting additional tax holidays \nand exemptions announced in the second half of 2017. \nWhile\u00a0devaluation probably increased receipts for some items, \nsuch\u00a0as value-added tax, revenue declined overall. At the \nsame time, expenditure rose, though continued downsizing \nof the public\u00a0sector offset some of the rise in outlays as \nthe government shielded vulnerable groups and strategic \nindustries from some consequences of reform. The Fund for \nReconstruction and Development balance probably moved into \nde\ufb01cit as it provided increased support to commercial banks \nand \ufb01nancing to undertake various development initiatives. \nIn response, the government sought budget assistance from \nmultilateral development banks in mid-2017.\n\nBeginning in the second half of 2017, the Central Bank \n\nof the Republic of Uzbekistan tightened monetary policy \nto limit money growth and stem in\ufb02ation. In the \ufb01rst\u00a0half, \nbank assets grew by 26% as credit expanded by 34%. \n\n3.8.1\u2002 Recent changes in economic \n\ndata management\n\nA new government prioritized \nin\u00a02017 improving its distribution \nof economic and social data in a \nbid to enhance economic planning \nwith more reliable data and to \nmake public administration more \naccountable. Senior government \nofficials had openly questioned \nprevious reports, suspecting that \nGDP growth rates were overstated \nand in\ufb02ation underreported. \nThe\u00a0government further initiated \nreform to national income \naccounting and CPI methodology. \nSince February 2018, a revised \nCPI methodology that aligns with \ninternational standards is used to \nmeasure in\ufb02ation. The government \ndescribes its release of 2017 GDP \ngrowth at 5.3% and CPI in\ufb02ation \nat 14.4% as \u201ctrue\u201d estimates. The \nnational statistics office did not, \nhowever, provide revised historical \ndata for these indicators. \n\nTo improve data availability, the \n\ngovernment lifted nondisclosure \nrequirements and declassi\ufb01ed such \nkey economic data as the volume \nand composition of international \nreserves. In addition, the government \nintroduced sweeping institutional \nchanges in the national statistics \noffice to improve its capacity to \nmanage data. The authorities have \nalso decided to join the International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s enhanced General \nData Dissemination System, and \nthey expect to post by May\u00a02018 \na national summary data page \nwith key economic, \ufb01nancial, and \nsocial\u00a0statistics.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nUzbekistan\u2002\u2002163\n\nBroad\u00a0money excluding foreign currency deposits grew by \n15%, creating strong in\ufb02ationary pressures. In June, the \ncentral bank responded by hiking its policy rate from 9.0% \nto 14.0%, triggering a 4.7% decline in broad money excluding \nforeign currency deposits in the second half of the year and \nslowing annual money expansion to 9.0%. If foreign currency \ndeposits are included, broad money grew by 40.2% in 2017 \n(Figure\u00a03.8.2). \n\nWhile preparing for exchange rate reform, the government \ninjected $0.6 billion into several large state-owned commercial \nbanks. The International Monetary Fund noted that, while \nmost banks bene\ufb01ted from upward revaluation of their foreign \nexchange assets and liabilities, some of these gains might be \nonly notional as they mirrored valuation losses in state-owned \nenterprises, which had large foreign exchange exposure to \nbanks and external lenders. \n\nAn improving external environment promoted higher \nexports of goods and services, helping widen the current \naccount surplus to the equivalent of an estimated 2.8% of \nGDP from 0.1% in 2016 (Figure 3.8.3). External demand \nimproved with economic recovery in the Russian Federation \nand Kazakhstan, as well as higher global energy prices. \nNew\u00a0export and investment agreements were reached with \nkey trade partners during the year, and Uzbek competitiveness \nimproved with devaluation. Government sources reported \nexports of goods and services up by 15.0%, led by foodstuffs, \nmetals, and machinery. Imports of goods and services rose \nby 7.2% on higher imports of metals and energy products. \nSom depreciation cut growth in imports of capital goods and \nequipment, the biggest item on the import list, to 0.7%. \n\nEconomic recovery in the Russian Federation, including \ndemand linked to preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup \nin June and July, helped raise remittances by 22% in the \ufb01rst \n9 months of 2017 over the same period in 2016. While detailed \ndata are not available, foreign direct investment is believed \nto have risen modestly, in line with Uzbekistan\u2019s improved \ninvestment climate. The government reported gross foreign \nreserves worth $28.1 billion at the end of 2017, cover for 28 \nmonths of merchandise imports (Figure 3.8.4). External debt \nrose to an estimated 49.0% of GDP at the end of 2017 from \n21.3% in 2016, re\ufb02ecting the impact of devaluation and some \nadditional foreign borrowing.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to accelerate to 5.5% in 2018 and 5.6% \nin 2019 with further improvement in the external outlook \nthat should boost export demand and foreign investment, \nparticularly from the Russian Federation (Figure 3.8.5). \nOn\u00a0the supply side, investment in capital-intensive industry \n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.8.3\u2002Current account components\n\nNet income\nExports\nImports\nNet services\nNet transfers\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n2.8\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.4\u2002Gross international reserves\n\nGross international reserves\n\nImport cover\n\n$ billion\n\nMonths of imports \n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.5\u2002GDP growth\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nEstimate Forecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate further to 16.0% in 2018 \n\n3.8.6\u2002 Inflation\n\n164(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nis expected to remain a key driver of growth, with improving \nexternal demand sustaining growth in industry at around \n5.0% in 2018 and 2019. Private consumption should rise \nwith higher remittances, planned real increases in wages \nand pensions, and targeted social support. This, along with \nexpansion in electronic banking, should keep growth in \nservices at around 7.0% in both years. Agriculture is expected \nto grow by 4.5% in 2018 and 4.8% in 2019 as horticulture \nexpands and reform takes hold. On the demand side, rising \ninvestment, both domestic and foreign, will promote growth. \nRe\ufb02ecting improvements in the business climate and public \nadministration, domestic investment should buoy agriculture, \ntrade, and services. Foreign investment will bene\ufb01t from \nrealistic exchange rates and, from early 2019, the \ufb01rst global \nlisting of Uzbekistan\u2019s sovereign debt. Nevertheless, 2018 will \nbe a challenging year, with substantial downside risk to the \nforecasts from lagged effects of devaluation on living costs and \nhousehold incomes. \n\nbefore slowing to 14.0% in 2019 (Figure 3.8.6).

In addition, state-owned \nutilities will continue raising tariffs to shore up their \ufb01nancial \nviability, service debt, and \ufb01nance operations. In\ufb02ation rose \nsharply in early 2018, with the CPI up by 2.7% month on month \nin January and 1.1% in February. Managing in\ufb02ation will \nremain a tough policy challenge, requiring closely coordinated \nmonetary and \ufb01scal policies. Fiscal consolidation\u2014to include \ntightening internal controls, limiting off-budget operations, and \nhardening budget constraints on state-owned enterprises\u2014will \nbe especially important to attain price stability. \n\nBroad money including foreign currency deposits \nis projected to grow by 25% in 2018 and 20% in 2019. \nLimited\u00a0bank capital and high interest rates in 2018 will \ncontinue to make access to credit a challenge. Closer to 2019, \nincreases in bank capital\u2014as banks comply with new capital \nrequirements to be imposed on 1 January 2019\u2014should support \ncredit growth.

Imports of goods are projected to \nrise gradually, by 4.0% in 2018 and 8.0% in 2019, with demand \ncoming mostly from industry and government, notably for oil, \nchemicals, and capital goods. If the exchange rate remains \nstable and foreign borrowing for state development programs \nis modest, external debt is likely to decline to the equivalent \nof 40.7% of GDP in 2018 and 33.6% in 2019.

There were strong expectations \nof a commensurate \ufb01scal response to mitigate social risks, \npromote the private sector, and sustain the delivery of public \nservices, as evidenced by an unprecedented review of the \n2018 state budget in December 2017. However, two key factors \nhave limited the capacity of the budget to respond effectively: \neroding \ufb01nances, as rising outlays and a decline in revenues \nfrom weak commodity prices worsened indebtedness, and \nfragmentation of the budget framework with the transfer of \ncapital expenditures for state development programs to a new \noff-budget fund. While global commodity prices are projected \nto rebound and restore revenue with help from planned tax \nreform, \ufb01scal fragmentation remains a serious concern because \nit undermines government efforts to decentralize and make \npublic spending more efficient. \n\n Public \ufb01nancial management must be strengthened to cope \n\nwith a persistent \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit, mounting needs for \ufb01nancing \n(including foreign borrowing), new development programs, and \nongoing \ufb01scal decentralization. A rationalized, consolidated, \nand forward-looking system of public \ufb01nancial management \nwould strengthen \ufb01scal policy by clearly informing policy \nmakers on the resources available, the constraints on their \nuse in addressing desired objectives, and options that would \nsupport economic stabilization. \n\nMuch remains to be done to make public spending more \n\nefficient. More bottom-up planning for the medium term \nwould enable the budget to better take into account the costs \n\n\f166(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nof strategies for developing particular sectors while providing \nclear priorities for decision making. \n\nThe government is gradually introducing computerized \naccounting systems in ministries, departments, and agencies. \nThis will make information for monitoring and decision \nmaking more comprehensive while strengthening the ability \nof these entities to assess their use of resources. What is \nultimately needed is a coherent and comprehensive internal \ncontrol framework that goes beyond ensuring the legality of \ntransactions. Another need is an effective internal audit system \ncovering all government agencies. In 2018, the government \nsubmitted a draft procurement law to Parliament, but it \ndescribes only a general platform for public procurement \nwithout comprehensively going into procurement practices. \nAdditional legislation is thus required to align domestic \nprocurement with internationally accepted practice. On a more \npositive note, the government established a single oversight \nbody to make basic procurement data readily available \nand provide an institutional focus for improving public \nprocurement.\n\nFinally, the government must improve its management of \nreform. This requires drawing on all available resources inside \nand outside of government, and on implementing global best \npractices, especially after the substantial downsizing of the \npublic sector that took place in 2017. In addition, successful \nreform will require effective communication about proposed \nmeasures and their motivations to citizens, government \nemployees, development partners, and investors, both domestic \nand international. \n\n\fEast asia\n\nhong kong, china\u2002\u2022\n\nmongolia\u2002\u2022\n\npEoplE\u2019s rEpublic of china\u2002\u2022\n\nrEpublic of korEa\u2002\u2022\n\ntaipEi,china\u2002\u2022\n\n\f\fHong Kong, China\n\nGrowth  accelerated  in  2017,  propelled  by  a  strong  external  environment  and  solid \ndomestic  demand.

Government expenditure \nis estimated to be less than budgeted because of lower \ndisbursements under some social programs, notably living \nallowances for seniors and low-income working families.\nFollowing the US federal funds rate, the Hong Kong \nMonetary Authority adjusted its benchmark base rate 3 times \nlast year, \ufb01nally to 1.75%. To satisfy the strong market demand, \nadditional Exchange Fund Bills were issued, resulting in \nan HK$80 billion reduction in interbank liquidity. Lending \nremained buoyant, however, as commercial banks lagged in \nadjusting their prime rates. Domestic credit grew by 15.5%, \ndouble the 7.3% increase in 2016, and growth in broad money \n(M2) supply accelerated to 10.0%. In March, the monetary \nauthority further raised the base rate by 25 basis points \nto 2.0%. A wide interest rate spread between the US and \nHong\u00a0Kong, China pushed the local dollar toward the weak \nend of its US dollar peg band, causing it to fall in March\u00a02018 \nto its lowest value since 2007. Net equity fund in\ufb02ows rose \nsubstantially, in contrast with largely negative \ufb02ows in the \npreceding 2 years. On the stock market, the Hang Seng Index \ngained 36.0%, compared with a scant 0.4% gain in 2016 \n(Figure\u00a03.9.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is expected to moderate to 3.2% in 2018 and \nfurther to 3.0% next year, still buttressed by domestic demand \n(Figure 3.9.7). Favorable employment and wage conditions, \nand income effects from last year\u2019s buoyant asset and property \nmarkets, will prop up consumer sentiment, while intensive \nconstruction, in particularly on government infrastructure \nmegaprojects, will push up capital spending. Private investment \ncould also rise on business optimism. The composite \npurchasing managers\u2019 index climbed further into expansionary \nterritory, reaching 51.7 in February 2018, the sixth consecutive \nmonth of expansion. Most businesses expect their order \nvolumes to increase in the short term, particularly in \ufb01nancial \nservices and retail, the latter bene\ufb01tting from higher inbound \ntourism (Figure 3.9.8). Some moderation in demand from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is expected, but shipments \nto other regional economies will remain solid, underpinning \nrecovery in exports.

Weakness in the US dollar and some upward \npressure from import costs contributed. In\ufb02ation will likely \nreach 2.2% in 2018 because of higher import costs, as well as \nrising rents that re\ufb02ect high demand for commercial space, \nand a more rapid increase in wages stoked by the tight labor \nmarket. However, higher interest rates will exert downward \npressure on consumption and prices. In\ufb02ation is expected to \ndecelerate slightly to 2.1% in 2019 in line with an anticipated \neasing of global oil prices. \n\nThe FY2018 \ufb01scal surplus is forecast to dip to 1.7% of \nGDP. Budgetary expenditure is slated to rise by 17.6%, as the \ngovernment ramps up spending on social welfare, education, \nhealth care, and family allowances, while increasing \ninvestment in innovative and creative industries, including \nthrough a startup fund. Budgetary revenue is projected to \nfall by 1.3%, however, mainly as a result of anticipated lower \nreceipts from land premium and salary taxes resulting from a \none-off tax concession and adjustments to tax bands, marginal \ntax rates, and certain allowances and deductions. \n\nImproving global demand, and recovery in tourist arrivals \n\nthat began in the second half of last year, should offer some \nsupport to exports of goods and services in 2018. However, \nthe strong exports of last year are unlikely to replay this year, \ngiven slower growth in demand from the PRC and uncertainty \nspawned by rising global trade protectionism. Higher demand \nfor capital goods and construction materials, supported in part \nby expected renminbi depreciation, should continue to boost \nimports and widen the trade de\ufb01cit. The services account will \npost a growing surplus as tourist numbers grow and exports \nof business and \ufb01nancial services expand, particularly in 2019 \nwhen a new trade and investment agreement between the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations and Hong Kong, China \ntakes effect. In sum, the current account surplus is forecast to \nnarrow to 3.9% this year and further to 3.5% in 2019. \n\nHong Kong, China remains the world\u2019s largest offshore \n\nrenminbi clearing center, with a share of global renminbi \npayments standing above 70% in 2017.

This could \ncause a sharp correction in the property market, which is \nalready a downside domestic risk owing to sky-high prices. \nTightened capital controls in the PRC on overseas investments \nmay further depress property prices, with corresponding \nwealth effects hitting private consumption. While tax reform \nin the US will induce some repatriation of funds and banking \nout\ufb02ows, strong infrastructure and sophisticated \ufb01nancial \nmarkets will keep Hong Kong, China highly attractive to \ninternational businesses. Lastly, worsening trade friction could \nundermine this regional trading hub. In any case, Hong Kong, \nChina is well positioned to face the challenges posed by these \nrisks, with sizeable external reserves and ample \ufb01scal reserves \nestimated to equal 41.0% of GDP at the end of March 2018.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014integrating the \nGuangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macao Bay Area\nAn ambitious cross-boundary vision, covered by the \nGovernment of the PRC in its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, \n2016\u20132020, aims to deepen the economic integration of nine \ncities in Guangdong Province with Hong Kong, China and \nMacao, China to create a metropolitan agglomerate called the \nGuangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macao Bay Area. The ambition for \nthe Bay Area\u2014set out in a 2017 framework agreement\u2014is to \nimprove its productivity and global competitiveness and forge \na global industrial, commercial, and \ufb01nancial cluster like those \nsurrounding Tokyo Bay and San Francisco Bay (Figure 3.9.9). \n\nTo this end, the Bay Area hopes to leverage the comparative \n\nadvantage of each of the 11 cities and exploit their synergies. \nIn particular, it will con\ufb01rm Hong Kong, China as the \npremier international shipping, \ufb01nancial, and commercial \nservices platform bridging PRC business with the rest of \nthe world. Further, the initiative presents an opportunity \nfor Hong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China to progressively integrate its service \nsector with those of the other Bay Area cities. Rather than \nface competition from their growing service industries, \nHong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China stands to bene\ufb01t from easier access to \ntheir vast labor resources. Increased mobility under a joint \nBay Area regulatory framework will address labor market \nmismatches, helping to alleviate shortages in Hong Kong, \nChina in industries such as construction and tourism, and \nboosting employment opportunities created by Shenzhen \ufb01rms \nexpanding into Hong\u00a0Kong, China.\n\n3.9.8\u2002Business tendency surveys\n\nAll sectors\nRetail\nImport/export trade and wholesale\nSMEs (all sectors)\n\n%\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\n$ trillion\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nNotes: Except for the SME index, indicators represent \nthe net balance of expected quarter-on-quarter changes \nin business situation.

Connectivity within the \nBay\u00a0Area having been improved through massive investments \nin infrastructure, the focus now is to explore further \nintegration through strategic dialogue across jurisdictions \nand the progressive dismantling of their regulatory silos. \nProgress\u00a0will require close governmental coordination \nto harmonize rules and practices and to pool customs \nadministrations to ease clearance for cross-boundary \ufb02ows \nof people, goods, and services and to allow the seamless \nintegration of production and supply chain transactions. \nGovernments should coordinate boundary controls to facilitate \nsustainable worker \ufb02ows. The\u00a0political and social implications \nof increased labor mobility, especially in lower-skilled \nsegments, will have to be carefully managed to minimize \nlocal resentment of migrants. Also of crucial importance will \nbe the portability of social security and harmonization of \ntax systems, with a particular focus on migrant and frontier \nworkers.

Growth  will  remain \nsolid  in  2018  and  2019,  albeit  with  slight  moderation,  thanks  to  large  investments  in \nmining.  Inflation  will  rise  in  2018  before  decelerating  modestly  in  2019,  and  the  current \naccount  deficit  will  narrow  considerably  in  2018  before  widening  somewhat  in  2019. \nUrban\u00a0 air  pollution,  especially  in  winter,  poses  an  urgent  and  complex  policy  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated to 5.1% in 2017 from 1.2% in 2016, \nmainly on a surge in coal exports and large investments tied to \nunderground development at the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold \nmine. Gross capital formation was a major driver of growth, \nincreasing by 36.2% as \ufb01xed capital investments resumed, \nadding 10.6 percentage points to growth. Despite a fall in \ngovernment consumption in line with \ufb01scal consolidation \nefforts, overall consumption rose, adding 1.8 percentage points \nto growth, as household consumption recovered with increased \nincome from agriculture. Exports rose by 13.4%, mainly \nbecause coal exports more than doubled. However, increased \nmining investments pushed up imports substantially, such that \na decline in net exports subtracted 7.3 percentage points from \ngrowth (Figure 3.10.1).\n\n A fall in copper concentrate quality at the Oyu Tolgoi mine \n\nlowered mining production by 6.9% in 2017. This was despite \na 32.7% increase in coal production driven by favorable prices. \nStrong recovery in manufacturing\u2014in particular coal washing, \ncement production, and meatpacking\u2014helped industry \ncontribute 0.2 percentage points to growth notwithstanding \nsubdued mining production and a decline in construction. \nLarge mining-related investments and imports underpinned \nexpansion in the transport, wholesale, and retail industries, \nmaking the service sector the main driver of growth, with \na contribution of 4.3 percentage points. Despite a drought \naffecting vegetables and staple crops, agriculture added \n0.6 percentage points as livestock herds continued to grow \n(Figure\u00a03.10.2). \n\n Average consumer price in\ufb02ation accelerated to 4.3% \n\nin 2017 from 1.1% in 2016 as pass-through from a 24.8% \ndepreciation of the Mongolian togrog in 2016 began to affect \n\nThis chapter was written by Declan Magee and Amar Lkhagvasuren of the \nMongolia Resident Mission, ADB, Ulaanbaatar.\n\n3.10.1\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n11.6\n\n7.9\n\n2.4\n\n1.2\n\n5.1\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2018. \nMonthly Statistical Bulletin.

Fiscal \nconsolidation reduced budgetary expenditure by 5.4% despite \ncontinued inclusion of formerly off-budget spending in the \nbudget, while higher receipts from taxes on external trade and \nconnected activities lifted budget revenue by 35.8%. Even\u00a0with \nstronger revenue performance, the authorities withdrew \nsavings from the Fiscal Stability Fund, estimated to equal 2.1% \nof GDP, to \ufb01nance normal budgetary operations. This negated \nthe purpose of the fund, which is insurance against revenue \nshortfalls arising from natural disasters or commodity price \nshocks. De\ufb01cit \ufb01nancing, currency depreciation, and a rising \nshare of external debt in total public debt pushed up interest \npayments on government debt to 12.9% of total expenditure \nin\u00a02017 from 10.4% in 2016. \n\nA surge in repatriated pro\ufb01ts from mining widened the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit by 62.6% to equal 10.2% of GDP in 2017 \n(Figure 3.10.5). Nevertheless, a sharp recovery in foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI), including the reinvestment of a record share \nof mining pro\ufb01ts\u2014as well as \ufb01nancial support from multilateral \ndevelopment partners and better terms of trade\u2014allowed \nthe country to re\ufb01nance a major part of its external debt. \nNet foreign liabilities dropped by 78.1% to $412 million, and \ngross reserves more than doubled to $3.0 billion, or cover for \n5.5\u00a0months of imports. These developments pushed the value of \nthe togrog up by 2.5% against the US dollar. This will allow the \nBank of Mongolia, the central bank, to pay off a portion of its \nshort-term, high-interest foreign liabilities, which amounted to \n15.4% of GDP in December 2017.

The contribution to growth \nfrom coal mining and related activities will be smaller in 2018, \nas transportation bottlenecks limit expansion in coal exports, \nbut larger again in 2019 as they are alleviated. On the whole, \nthe contribution of mining to growth is projected to turn \npositive in 2018 and rise higher in 2019. The service sector will \nremain the driver of growth, though its contribution will be \nlower in 2018 as coal transport declines, recovering in 2019. \nCrop production is projected to return to normal in 2018 after \nthe drought in 2017, helping agriculture recover. Manufacturing \nwill grow at a slower rate than in 2017, with cement and food \nprocessing playing prominent roles. Construction is set to \nrecover in line with higher mining investments. \n\nConsumption growth will be supported in both 2018 and \n2019 by rising government expenditure, higher incomes, and \nstrengthening consumer con\ufb01dence linked to mining activity. \nInvestment will grow in both years but at a diminishing pace as \nFDI in\ufb02ows remain stable. The decline in coal exports in 2018 \nwill likely be compensated by increased copper concentrate \nexports, but with imports expected to remain robust, net \nexports should be negative in both years. \n\n Average in\ufb02ation will accelerate to 8.0% in 2018 and \nease to 7.0% in 2019 (Figure 3.10.9). Rising domestic demand \nand international oil and food prices will, with the effect of \nlooser monetary policy in 2017, drive in\ufb02ation higher in 2018. \nThese effects will be less pronounced in 2019 as oil prices and \ndomestic demand subside. \n\nFiscal policy will be more expansionary in 2018 and 2019. \n\nThe budget de\ufb01cit is projected to equal 6.4% of GDP in 2018 \nand 5.1% in 2019 as expenditure on social insurance, welfare, \nand equipment increases\u2014and because reform to ease reporting \nrequirements and the tax burden for small and medium-sized \nenterprises is likely to reduce budget revenue. \n\nimports related to FDI but widen again in 2019 on rising \ncoal exports.

Upside risks to growth \nwould be higher commodity prices and a possible deal on large \ninfrastructure projects tied to existing mining production.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reducing the high cost \nof air pollution in Ulaanbaatar \nUlaanbaatar is the coldest national capital in the world and \nthe most polluted city in wintertime. Pollutant concentrations \nin the coldest months can average 20 times recommended \nguidelines from the World Health Organization, with daily \nlevels up to 80 times higher (Figure 3.10.10). The annual \neconomic cost of pollution through premature death and higher \nhospitalization is estimated by the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation in the US to equal 8%\u201313% of Mongolian GDP. \nPoor families are especially exposed as they are more likely \nto live and work in the most polluted areas and often cannot \nafford medical care. With poverty rates estimated to have risen \nfrom 2014 to 2016 by 8.0 percentage points to 29.6% nationwide \nand by 8.4 percentage points to 24.8% in Ulaanbaatar mainly \ndue to the worsening economic situation in this period, \nthe number of people vulnerable to pollution has increased \nsigni\ufb01cantly. Thus, pollution both increases economic costs and \ndeepens inequality.\n\n High pollution has both human and natural causes. \nIncreasingly frequent harsh winters and summer droughts \nworsen conditions for herders, stoking migration to cities. \nUlaanbaatar has grown by more than 30% since 2007 \nto a population of 1.5 million, expected to hit 1.9 million \nby\u00a02025. Close to 60% of city residents live in vast informal \ndevelopments and rely on raw coal or refuse burned in \ninefficient stoves for heating and cooking, which generate 80% \nof pollution in Ulaanbaatar. Exacerbating the problem are the \nuse of highly polluting coal-\ufb01red boilers for heating, combined \nheat and power plants, the growing number of vehicles, and \nmountains that trap polluted air in winter. \n\nThe National Program for Reducing Air and Environmental \n\nPollution, 2017\u20132025 aims to strengthen regulations on fuel \nquality, ban raw coal in Ulaanbaatar by 2019, and improve \naccess to higher-quality energy sources by subsidizing the \nuse of electricity and cleaner fuels. It includes longer-term \n\n\f178(cid:127)(cid:127)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nplans to improve energy efficiency, broaden access to clean \nenergy sources, improve public transport, provide affordable \nhousing, and strengthen urban planning and development. \nThe\u00a0program is estimated to cost $4 billion, of which \n$1.8\u00a0billion targets air pollution, with the remainder focused \non land and water pollution. Only 4.5% has reportedly been \nsecured. Development\u00a0partners have committed to funding \nparts of the program, but the government will need to create \nthe right conditions to attract additional \ufb01nancing. Success \nrequires careful analysis of sustainability and cost-effectiveness \nto ensure resource allocation to activities with impact and the \nsustainability of measures such as fuel subsidies. \n\nMeanwhile, improving conditions in rural areas would \nbe better than forcing people out of the city or restricting \nmigration, which might well exacerbate unplanned urban \nexpansion and pollution. Finally, the national program must \nbe immune to political changes to ensure its uninterrupted \nimplementation.\n\n\fPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n\nGrowth accelerated in 2017 on robust consumption and rising exports. It will decelerate in \n2018  and  2019  as  macroeconomic  policy  is  carefully  tightened  to  put  the  economy  on  a \nmore sustainable growth path. Inflation will stir but remain low in 2018 and 2019, and the \ncurrent account surplus will trend downward. A key policy challenge is to reform personal \nincome  tax  and  social  security  contributions  to  enhance  tax  revenue  and  reduce  income \ninequality.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated slightly from 6.7% in 2016 to 6.9% \nin 2017, reversing the declining trend since 2011, when the \nimpact of stimulus initiated by the government in late 2008 \nfaded out (Figure 3.11.1). Although monetary and \ufb01scal policies \ntightened somewhat toward the end of 2017, robust domestic \nconsumption and surprisingly strong external demand \nsupported growth and facilitated further economic rebalancing \ntoward consumption and services. Ranked the second largest \neconomy in the world, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \ncontributed a third of global economic growth in 2017.\n\nOn the supply side, services remained the main driver of \ngrowth, accelerating to 8.0% from 7.7% in 2016 and contributing \n4.0 percentage points to GDP growth (Figure\u00a03.11.2). Rapid \nexpansion in transportation, information transmission and \ntechnology, and leasing and business services offset moderation \nin \ufb01nancial and real estate services. The\u00a0contribution of \nindustry to growth fell to 2.5\u00a0percentage points as the sector, \nwhich includes mining and construction in addition to \nmanufacturing, experienced growth deceleration from 6.3% \nin 2016 to 6.1%. Export, consumer, and high-tech industries \ncontinued to do well, but construction weakened in conjunction \nwith moderating property prices and sales. On\u00a0the\u00a0positive side, \nthe capacity utilization rate in manufacturing improved to 77%, \nthe highest in 5 years and close to the international norm of \n80%, thanks to increases in production and restrictions under \nthe government\u2019s supply-side policy reform program that cut \nproduction capacity. The share of services in nominal GDP \nincreased to 51.6%, while that of industry eased to 40.5%. \n\nThese developments, which re\ufb02ect rebalancing from heavy \nindustry toward services and consumption, continued a trend \ntoward lower energy consumption per unit of GDP, tamping \n\nThis chapter was written by Jurgen Conrad, Dominik Peschel, and Jian Zhuang \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission, ADB, Beijing.\n\n3.11.1\u2002Economic growth\n\nGross domestic product\nRetail sales\nIndustrial sector value added\n\n%\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: GDP data for the \ufb01rst quarter of 2018 are not yet \navailable.\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.2\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.8\n\n7.3\n\n6.9\n\n6.7\n\n6.9\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f180(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nit down by another 3.7% in 2017. Strong service sector growth \nkept the labor market buoyant, with 13.5 million new urban \njobs created in 2017, signi\ufb01cantly above the government\u2019s target \nof 11 million. The ratio of urban job openings to job seekers \nincreased again to 1.22 in the fourth quarter of 2017, the highest \nsince 2001. Ongoing investment and normal weather accelerated \nagriculture growth from 3.3% in 2016 to 3.9% in\u00a02017, but the \nsector\u2019s share in GDP declined further from 8.6% to 7.9%. \n\nOn the demand side, consumption grew by an estimated \n8.0%, and its contribution to GDP growth, at 4.1 percentage \npoints, again surpassed that of investment at 2.2 points \n(Figure\u00a03.11.3). Consumption growth found support in higher \nhousehold disposable income, which grew by 7.3% in real \nterms, and rising government social spending. For the ninth \nsuccessive year, rural households saw real income increase \nfaster than did urban residents, though urban households \nstill earned 2.7 times more than their rural counterparts \n(Figure\u00a03.11.4). Re\ufb02ecting these trends, retail sales in rural \nareas rose faster than in cities. \n\nInvestment growth decelerated to an estimated 4.6% \nyear on year, owing to a slowdown in real estate investment \nas purchase restrictions\u2014including quotas and larger down-\npayment requirements\u2014were implemented in more and more \ncities. Nevertheless, property sales continued to outpace new \nproperty completed, shrinking the housing overhang, measured \nby \ufb02oor space awaiting sale, by 15.3% in line with the objectives \nof the government\u2019s ongoing supply-side reform (Figure 3.11.5). \nGrowth in infrastructure investment accelerated slightly on \ncontinued government support, notably through public\u2013private \npartnership. Growth in manufacturing investment stabilized \nas investment in general and transportation equipment \nrecovered, and as investment in automobiles and in information \ntechnology hardware accelerated, but investment in other \nmanufacturing remained constrained by excess capacity and \nhigh corporate debt. \n\nBoosted by strong demand from developed and developing \n\neconomies alike for both capital- and labor-intensive goods \nsince late 2016, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth \njumped to 0.6 percentage points, reversing a drag of 0.6 \npercentage points in 2016. This sharp turnaround was critical \nfor GDP growth acceleration in 2017 in the face of weakening \ninvestment.\n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation averaged 1.6% in 2017, down \nfrom 2.0% in 2016, mainly from a 1.4% decline in food prices \n(especially for pork, vegetables, and eggs), which account for \none-third of the official consumer price basket (Figure 3.11.6). \nBase effects, favorable weather, and improved supplies were \nkey reasons. Prices for services increased by 3.0%, however, \non rising labor and education costs, and as price deregulation \npushed up health and elder care expenses, raising core in\ufb02ation \nexcluding energy and food from 1.6% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2017. \n\n3.11.3\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nNet exports\nInvestment\nConsumption\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-200\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.4\u2002Per capita income\n\nUrban\nRural\n\n% change year to date\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.5\u2002Real estate market\n\nResidential \ufb02oor space sold\nResidential \ufb02oor space awaiting sale\nResidential \ufb02oor space started\n\nMillion square meters\n\nJan\n2016\n\nMay\n\nSep\n\nMay\n\nSep\n\nJan\n2017\n\nFeb\n2018\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002181\n\n3.11.6\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall consumer price in\ufb02ation\nCore consumer price in\ufb02ation\nProducer price in\ufb02ation\n\nSupported by rising commodity prices and a strong \nrecovery in prices for upstream industrial products, the \nproducer price index climbed by 6.3% in 2017 after falling by an \naverage of 2.4% year on year from 2012 to 2016. Industry pro\ufb01t \nsoared by 21.0% in 2017, skyrocketing by nearly 60% in the \nmaterials subsector, allowing these industries to service their \ndebt and reduce borrowing. These outcomes arguably arose \nfrom production ceilings imposed on industries with excess \ncapacity and high indebtedness, such as coal, steel, aluminum, \niron, and cement. Capping their output aimed to raise prices \nand thereby their pro\ufb01tability to achieve a stated objective of \nsupply-side reform.\n\nHousing prices rose by 5.6% in 2017, slowing from 10.1% \ngrowth in 2016 with the expansion of restrictions on housing \npurchases and regulations tightening access to mortgages. \nBoth monetary policy and \ufb01nancial regulations were \n\ntightened in 2017. Regulatory tightening aimed to curb \nspeculative investment and contain enterprise debt, while \nensuring adequate \ufb01nancing to the rest of the economy to \nsupport the government\u2019s growth objective. The People\u2019s Bank \nof China, the central bank, reduced liquidity in the interbank \nmarket, forcing up interbank interest rates. The benchmark \n7-day rate rose from 2.5% on average in January 2017 to 2.9% in \nDecember 2017 (Figure 3.11.7). Similarly, the weighted average \nlending rate increased year on year to the fourth quarter of \n2017 by 0.4 percentage points to 5.7%. In line with higher \ninterest rates and tighter regulation, credit to nonbank \ufb01nancial \ninstitutions grew more slowly in 2017 than in 2016 as banks \nreduced investment in bonds and other \ufb01nancial instruments \nissued by nonbank borrowers. Corporate bond issuance took \na hit as outstanding volume grew by only 2.5%, down steeply \nfrom 20.8% in 2016. The bond market thus became a collateral \nvictim of the government\u2019s deleveraging efforts.\n\nAll in all, broad money (M2) expanded by only 8.2% in 2017, \ndown from 11.3% in 2016 and re\ufb02ecting slower expansion in net \ndomestic credit (Figure 3.11.8). However, total social \ufb01nancing, \na broader credit aggregate that includes not only bank credit \nbut also \ufb01nancing to households and enterprises from nonbank \n\ufb01nancial institutions and the capital market, grew by 12.0%, \nonly 0.8 percentage points less than in 2016. Within total \nsocial \ufb01nancing, bank loans outstanding grew by 12.7%, up \nfrom 12.6% in 2016, while trust loans, a well-regulated type \nof nonbank credit, grew even faster. Meanwhile, regulatory \ntightening slowed growth in intercompany loans channeled \nthrough banks. \n\nThe consolidated central and local government budget ran \na de\ufb01cit equal to 3.7% of GDP in 2017, slightly below the 3.8% \nreached in 2016.

As a percentage of \nGDP, however, revenues declined further from 21.5% in 2016 \nto 20.9%, which is low for a country at the income level of \nthe PRC. Similarly, expenditure growth increased in nominal \nterms but fell as a share of GDP to 24.6%, partly because of \nslow progress toward bringing off-budget spending on budget. \nTimely data on off-budget activity are not available, but it has \nbeen sizeable for years as local government budget revenues \nhave failed to keep pace with rising social and infrastructure \nspending needs. \n\nExports increased in 2017 by 11.4% in US dollar terms, \nand imports by 16.4%, reversing declines in 2015 and 2016. \nExports\u00a0increased more than initially expected, mainly on \nvigorous demand from the US, the euro area, Japan, and \nSoutheast Asia. The trade surplus shrank by 3.6%, and the \nde\ufb01cit in services trade widened, causing the current account \nsurplus to narrow further to the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP \nin\u00a02017 from 1.8% in 2016 (Figure 3.11.9).

This aligned \nwith the government objective to keep the exchange rate \n\u201cbasically stable.\u201d Taking in\ufb02ation into account, the renminbi \nstrengthened by 1.0% in real effective terms (Figure\u00a03.11.10).\n\nEconomic prospects\nAfter an uptick in 2017, GDP growth is expected to return to \nits moderating trajectory. Strong momentum from 6.8% growth \nin the last quarter of 2017 is expected to spill over into\u00a02018, \nsupported by a favorable global economic environment, \npushing growth to 6.6%, above the official target of 6.5% \n(Figure 3.11.11). As in 2017, faster growth in the \ufb01rst half of the \nyear will be followed by slight moderation in the second half as \nmomentum fades. The forecast assumes that the government \nsustains moderate tightening in both monetary and \ufb01scal \npolicy over the forecast period, aiming for a more sustainable \ngrowth rate. To\u00a0improve the quality of growth, government \npolicy is expected to focus on three priorities announced \nin December 2017 and recon\ufb01rmed at the National People\u2019s \nCongress in March 2018: heading off \ufb01nancial risk, controlling \nenvironmental pollution, and using targeted intervention \nto eliminate poverty. These policies will initially dampen \ngrowth, especially in 2019 when their full impact will be felt. \nGrowth is therefore forecast to slow further to 6.4% in 2019. \nAs in the past, the government can be expected to counter any \n\n3.11.9\u2002Current account balance\n\nGoods\nService\nNet income\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: State Administration of Foreign Exchange; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nReal effective\nNominal effective\n\nNominal CNY/$\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100 \n\nCNY/$\n\n 6.0\n\n 6.3\n\n 6.6\n\n 6.9\n\n 7.2\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n  Jan\n2016\n\nJul\n\n  Jan    \n2017\n\nJul\n\n  Jan\n2018\n\nSources: Bank for International Settlements; \nState\u00a0Administration of Foreign Exchange.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.11\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002183\n\n3.11.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n6.6\n\n2.4\n\n1.3\n\n6.4\n\n2.3\n\n1.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nexternal shocks with \ufb01scal and monetary policies as necessary \nto achieve its growth target.

Excess capacity \nand high debt will continue to limit investment in heavy \nindustry, and enterprises that pollute the environment will face \nadditional constraints on investment (and production) imposed \nby the government as part of ongoing structural reform. \n\nGovernment investment in infrastructure will remain \n\nsizeable, but its growth rate is projected to decline, the \ngovernment having already started to streamline infrastructure \nspending both on and off budget to control growth in local \ngovernment debt. As bond yields drive up \ufb01nancing costs, \nconstraints are stiffening as well on government-owned policy \nbanks, which have provided heavily subsidized loans on a large \nscale for infrastructure projects, shantytown reconstruction, \nand social housing. As a result, infrastructure investment \ngrowth has already weakened since December 2017, scuttling \nseveral major infrastructure projects that had been pursued \nas public\u2013private partnerships. These developments cannot \nbe fully compensated by stronger investment in emerging \nindustries, consumer-oriented industries, and services because \nmost of them are less capital intensive. However, investment in \nexport-oriented industries may increase, especially if the surge \nin exports continues. This possibility harbors an upside risk to \nthe forecast.\n\nThe trend in exports and imports over the forecast period \n\nshould be a continuation from 2017, tempered by the pattern \nof growth in the major industrial economies\u2014the US, the euro \narea, and Japan\u2014which is expected to accelerate in 2018 and \nmoderate in 2019. As in 2017, high commodity prices, robust \ndomestic demand, and a still large share of \ufb01nal assembly \n\n\f184(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nof manufactures will keep growth in imports above that \nof exports in 2018. The major contribution of net exports \nto growth in 2017 is expected to unwind in 2018 and 2019. \nWith\u00a0a slightly larger de\ufb01cit in the services account\u2014resulting \nfrom more outbound tourism, study abroad, and intellectual \nproperty royalties encouraged by service sector liberalization\u2014\nthe current account surplus should slip further to equal 1.3% of \nGDP in 2018 and 1.2% in 2019.\n\nOn the supply side, services will remain the main driver \nof growth, even if contributions from \ufb01nancial intermediation \nand real estate continue to weaken. The service sector still has \nhuge catch-up potential in the PRC, given its GDP share in\u00a02017 \nof just 51.6%, or 10\u201315 percentage points below the share of \nservices in other economies at a similar income level. Such \npotential, particularly in health care, education, entertainment, \ntourism, internet, leasing, and commercial services, is expected \nto be unleashed gradually as urbanization progresses and \nthe government continues to deregulate banking, security, \nand insurance activities, gradually opening them to private \nand foreign investors. Constrained by high debt and cooling \nreal\u00a0estate, growth in traditional manufacturing industries and \nconstruction will decelerate further in 2018 and 2019, though \nstrong performances are expected from consumer- and export-\noriented industries and emerging high-technology subsectors.\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation is projected to increase to 2.4% \nin\u00a02018 and 2.3% in 2019 because food prices, which declined \nin\u00a02017, have normalized and price in\ufb02ation for services \nremains elevated (Figure 3.11.12). Apart from volatile food \nprices, key drivers of in\ufb02ation continue to be strong consumer \ndemand for other commodities and services, higher wages, \nand continued price deregulation, particularly for health care. \nSome spillover from higher producer prices is expected despite \ntenuous linkage experienced in 2017, arguably caused by the \nlagged effect of producer price in\ufb02ation on the consumer \nprice\u00a0index.\n\nMonetary policy is likely to continue its balancing\u00a0act, \nreining in speculative nonbank credit and containing state-\nowned enterprise debt while ensuring credit to areas \nprioritized for economic development or unduly encumbered \nby difficulty in obtaining bank loans. No money supply targets \nwere set for 2018, which augments \ufb02exibility for policy makers. \nShort-term policy interest rates are likely to rise moderately \nin the remainder of 2018 in response to rising in\ufb02ationary \npressure and the central bank\u2019s sustained focus on deleveraging \nand reducing \ufb01nancial risk. Although regulatory tightening was \nresponsible for a sharp decrease in bond \ufb01nancing, it remains \nto be seen if the government will take action to revive this \nimportant channel of \ufb01nance to the real economy. \n\nFiscal policy will remain \u201cproactive,\u201d as the government \n\nrecently recon\ufb01rmed at the National People\u2019s Congress. \n\n3.11.12\u2002 Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002185\n\nHowever, support may be a bit weaker over the forecast period \nthan in 2016 and early 2017, with a slightly lower budget de\ufb01cit \ntarget than in 2017 and renewed efforts to bring under control \noff-budget borrowing by local governments. Budget de\ufb01cits will \nbe \ufb01nanced increasingly by bonds issued by local governments, \nthe central government having set higher quotas to give local \ngovernment more room to \ufb01nance infrastructure on-budget. \nWithin the consolidated budget, transfers from the center to \nlocal governments will increase to institute across the country \nuni\ufb01ed standards of public service delivery, which many \nlocal governments cannot \ufb01nance without greater support. \nThe\u00a0government is expected to make more visible efforts to \nreform property and personal income taxes by advancing \nlegislation, but no increase in revenues will materialize within \nthe forecast period.

Other downside risks include heightened global \ntrade protectionism, which could undercut PRC exports and \ninvestment, and renewed large capital out\ufb02ows if interest \nrate hikes in the US stoke expectations of dollar appreciation \n(Figure 3.11.13). However, these risks seem to be moderate over \nthe forecast period. At this stage, there are no signs that the \nUS dollar will appreciate signi\ufb01cantly in the short run, so there \nis little incentive to move capital out of the PRC. In any case, \nstrong \ufb01nances position the PRC well to manage any such risks \nand limit their impact on growth. \n\nA domestic downside risk to the forecast would be a \ndeepening slowdown in investment growth, though the \ngovernment would have the necessary monetary and \ufb01scal \ntools to stabilize investments, if needed. Another domestic risk \nis that regulatory tightening could cause liquidity shortages \nand drive weaker \ufb01nancial institutions into bankruptcy, \nengendering systemic instability. However, the likelihood \nof such a risk materializing remains low, considering that \nsubstantial progress has been made in reducing \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows \nbetween banks and nonbanks and in making intermediation \nchannels more transparent. Further, the central bank has \nacknowledged that mitigating risk exposure in the \ufb01nancial \nsystem would likely reduce bank liquidity, thereby hurting \nweaker banks and making investment \ufb01nancing less available. \nIt has stated that it stands ready to avert these outcomes by \nproviding liquidity as needed.\n\nFurther improvement in the global trade outlook harbors \n\n3.11.13\u2002 Official reserves and capital flows\n\nOfficial reserves\n\nNet capital \ufb02ows \n\n$ billion\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n-80\n\n$ trillion\n4.2\n\n2.8\n\n1.4\n\n0.0\n\n-1.4\n\n-2.8\n\n6-month moving average\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nFeb\n2018\n\nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; State Administration of \nForeign Exchange.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f3.11.14\u2002 Tax revenue\n\n% of GDP\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n1994\n\n1998\n\n2002 2006 2010 2014\n\n2017\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; Ministry of Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n186(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014tax reform to raise \nrevenue and narrow income inequality\nThe PRC has made substantial progress with \ufb01scal reform over \nrecent years, but tax revenues has been declining as a ratio \nof\u00a0GDP (Figure 3.11.14). The combination of falling tax revenue \nand rising expenditure has translated into rising budget \nde\ufb01cits, public debt, and contingent liabilities.\n\nInternational experience shows that the ratio of tax \nrevenue to GDP tends to increase as countries grow richer. \nThis\u00a0re\ufb02ects better administration and collection, as well as \na more comprehensive social contract to provide a broader \nrange of high-quality public services. However, the ratio of \ntax revenue to GDP in the PRC, excluding social security \ncontributions, was only 17.5% in 2017, after peaking at 18.6% \nin 2012 and 2013. By comparison, in 2014, the ratio was 25% \non average in the advanced economies of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 21% in \nthe 10 emerging economies in the Group of 20 (G20). \n\nThe stagnation of tax revenue in the PRC can be explained \n\nby heavy dependence on indirect taxes, whose growth has \nslowed following value-added tax reform that eased the tax \nburden for enterprises in the service sector. Indeed, direct \ntaxes in the PRC make only a small contribution to tax revenue \nequal to 5% of GDP, compared with 11% in the OECD countries \nand 7%\u20138% in the G20 emerging economies. The lackluster \ncollection of direct taxes re\ufb02ects mainly low receipts of \npersonal income taxes, equal to 1.4% of GDP and much lower \nthan the OECD norm of 8.4%. This suggests that there is \nsubstantial potential in the PRC to raise more revenue from \npersonal income taxes. Another issue is that the tax system in \nthe PRC does little to narrow income inequality, which remains \na big concern for the country. The difference between Gini \ncoefficients, the usual measure of inequality, before and after \ntaxes and transfers is only 3% in the PRC, compared with over \n30% in OECD countries.\n\nThree main reasons explain the low contribution of \npersonal income taxes to revenue and their limited use to \naddress inequality. First, a high standard personal exemption \nof CNY42,000, or twice the average annual national wage, \nnarrows the income tax base such that fewer than 20% of \nwage earners pay it. Second, the top marginal rate of 45% \napplies only to income above CNY960,000, which is the highest \nbracket of income distribution and almost 35 times the average \nannual national wage. In contrast, in OECD countries, the \npersonal exemption is only one quarter of the average annual \nnational wage, and the top marginal rate starts to apply at \naround 4 times the average. Third, personal income is not \ntaxed on a consolidated basis but according to a multicategory \nsystem that subjects income from different sources to different \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002187\n\ntax schedules. Depending on the category, income from some \nsources is taxed at progressive rates (as are wages and salaries), \nwhile others are taxed at a \ufb02at rate (rental and lease income, \namong others) or even tax-exempt (interest on savings deposits \nand bonds).\n\nTaxes on wage income are rendered even less progressive \n\nby the highly regressive structure of social security \ncontributions. A \ufb02at and slightly different contribution rate \nis applied to employees\u2019 gross wages in each province and \nlocality. Nationwide, the rate averages 11%. The social security \ncontribution base to which the contribution rate applies is \nthe employee\u2019s salary in the previous year, except for those \nearning below a threshold, who must pay a \ufb01xed minimum \namount, and those earning above a threshold, who pay a \n\ufb01xed maximum amount. The lower threshold is generally \nset at 60% of the previous year\u2019s average local wage, and \nthe top threshold at 300% of that wage. As the earnings of \nabout 30% of urban workers are below the lower threshold, \nthese low-income workers effectively make social security \ncontributions higher than 11% of their income. Meanwhile, for \nthe top earners, the effective rate is lower than 11%. Indeed, \nthe tax bite on low incomes is substantial and grows as income \nfalls. This is not only regressive, because it worsens inequality, \nbut potentially a disincentive for low-income workers to enter \nformal employment. This barrier to entry is further exacerbated \nby employer social security contributions that are relatively \nhigh, almost 35% of payroll on the average, more than double \nthe 16% average in the 10 advanced economies in the G20 and \nsubstantially more than the 25% norm in the European Union. \nThese issues suggest to the government a future direction \n\nfor tax reform. First, adjustment to the standard personal \nallowance that, for example, replaces it with a well-calibrated \ntax credit, could signi\ufb01cantly broaden the personal income tax \nbase and make it more progressive. Second, a good complement \nto the \ufb01rst reform would be to simplify the tax rate structure \nwith fewer income categories such that higher rates capture \nmore income from upper-middle earners. Third, levying social \nsecurity contributions on the actual income of all earners, \nwithout thresholds, would make them much less regressive. \nFurther, by removing regressive taxation as a disincentive to \nseeking formal wage employment, social security reform could \nmake both personal income tax and social security receipts \nmore\u00a0buoyant. \n\nThese reforms will likely be initiated within the forecast \nperiod and gradually help raise revenue, address inequality, \nand strengthen labor market \ufb02exibility and enterprise \ncompetitiveness over the long term. At the 19th Party Congress in \nOctober 2017 and the National People\u2019s Congress in March\u00a02018, \nthe PRC leadership con\ufb01rmed the need to comprehensively \nreform personal income taxes and social security contributions.\n\n\fRepublic of Korea\n\nRobust  global  expansion  spurred  exports  and  investment,  pushing  growth  in  2017  higher \nthan  expected.  Supported  by  domestic  consumption  and  external  demand,  growth  will \nslow  marginally  in  2018  and  2019.  Inflation  will  remain  low  and  stable,  and  the  sizable \ncurrent  account  surplus  will  narrow  slightly.  Youth  unemployment  needs  to  be  tackled  by \nimproving  conditions  for  smaller  businesses,  to  make  the  jobs  they  offer  more  attractive.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP expanded by 3.1% in 2017, up from 2.8% in 2016 as \npolitical uncertainties in the \ufb01rst half of the year dissipated \nwith the election of a new government in May, which \nimproved domestic demand, and as relations warmed with the \nPeople\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China (PRC), the largest trade partner \nof the Republic of Korea (ROK). GDP grew at a slower pace \nof 2.8% in the \ufb01rst half of the year as consumption stagnated \nand export growth weakened, though investment growth \nwas strong at 12.0% (Figure 3.12.1). Growth picked up in the \nsecond half of the year, reaching 3.3% as both public and \nprivate consumption strengthened after the election of the \nnew government, a supplementary budget was implemented, \nand investment growth sustained its momentum. The recovery \nwas strongly supported by an improving global economy and \naccommodative domestic monetary and \ufb01scal policies. \nInvestment expanded by 8.6%, the highest annual \ngrowth rate since 2000, and was the major source of GDP \ngrowth, contributing 3.0 percentage points (Figure 3.12.2). \nThe\u00a0investment surge was driven by a rebound in machinery \nand equipment investment driven in turn by stronger exports, \nespecially of semiconductors and other information technology \n(IT) products. Construction investment grew by 7.6% in\u00a02017 \nfrom 10.3% a year earlier, mainly on account of strong \nresidential construction, which grew by 14.9%.\n\nConsumption grew by 2.8% in 2017, slower than in the \nprevious year but adding 1.8 percentage points to growth. \nPrivate consumption rose rapidly as the consumer sentiment \nindex breached the 100-point threshold at midyear. \nUnemployment remained unchanged from 2016 at\u00a03.7%. \nExports grew for a second straight year on strong global \ndemand for semiconductors and petrochemicals.

In tandem \nwith growth in merchandise exports, manufacturing grew by \n4.3%, while construction remained strong thanks to expanded \ncivil works projects. Services grew more modestly for a second \nconsecutive year as wholesale and retail trade weakened \nwith fewer tourist arrivals from the PRC, but the sector still \ncontributed 1.1 percentage points to growth.

A spike in food \nand utility prices contributed to in\ufb02ation, but core in\ufb02ation \nexcluding food and energy eased from 1.9% in 2016 to 1.5%. \nMonetary policy continued to support growth against a \nbackdrop of benign in\ufb02ation. With its \ufb01rst rate increase since \nJune 2016, the central bank raised its benchmark policy rate \nin November 2017 from 1.25% to 1.50%, signaling a gradual \nnormalization of monetary policy.

Improved diplomatic relations with the \nPRC will further support exports. Merchandise import growth \nwill likely moderate along with lower investment growth, but \nrising consumption and a higher oil import bill will temper the \nslowdown. Imports will exceed exports, trimming the trade \nsurplus, but net service receipts will improve with the likely \nreturn of PRC tourists, keeping the current account surplus \nsizeable at the equivalent of 4.9% of GDP in 2018 and 4.8% \nin\u00a02019.\n\nModerate price increases in January point to waning \nin\ufb02ation, but sustained expansion of domestic demand, a large \nhike in the minimum wage, and higher global oil prices will \ndrive in\ufb02ation to an average of 1.9% this year and 2.0% next \nyear.

The budget \nfor \ufb01scal 2018 (ending on 30 September 2018) includes a record \n$385 billion in expenditure, a 4.6% increase from last year as \nsocial and welfare spending grows. Revenue will also be higher \nwith the top corporate tax rate raised in December from 22% \nto 40% and the top individual income tax rate up from 25% \nto\u00a042%. \n\nRisks to the forecasts are broadly balanced. Unexpectedly \nstrong global growth is an upside risk as it would raise demand \nfor ROK exports, while slower global growth is a downside \nrisk, especially if global IT business downcycles lower than \nexpected. The easing of political tensions on the Korean \nPeninsula would support growth. Downside risks include \nfaster normalization of monetary policy than expected in the \nmajor industrial economies, especially in the US, which could \nundermine domestic \ufb01nancial stability. High and growing \nhousehold debt exacerbates the risk, which would be further \nmagni\ufb01ed if asset prices were to fall (Figure 3.12.8).\n\nAn ongoing review of the KORUS bilateral trade agreement \n\nbetween the ROK and the US adds a degree of uncertainty to \na generally favorable external environment. Progress has been \nslow, but a breakthrough came in late March when a tentative \nagreement was reached allowing improved market access to \nthe ROK for US automobile makers and reducing the quota \nfor exports of ROK steel to the US, in return for the continued \nexemption of the ROK from tariffs on steel imports from the \nUS. Although the prolongation of negotiations means little \nimpact in the short term, the export-oriented ROK economy \nwill be hard hit if protectionism gains further ground. Recent \nappreciation of the ROK won could, if continued, render some \nmanufactures less competitive, but the effect is likely to be \ncontained as demand overseas for semiconductors and some \nother key exports is not highly price sensitive. In any case, \nwith ample foreign exchange reserves at $389.3 billion and \nsubstantial \ufb01scal strength, the ROK is well placed to meet any \nrisk that materializes.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014tackling youth \nunemployment\nYouth unemployment has been worsening in the ROK, \nin contrast with the improving trend in the rest of the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD)\u2014this despite the ROK overall unemployment \nrate being lower than the OECD average (Figure\u00a03.12.9). \nIn\u00a0December\u00a02017, the unemployment rate for the 25\u201329 age \ngroup, encompassing young people \ufb01rst entering the workforce \nafter completing university and military service, rose from \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n%\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n3.12.8\u2002Credit to households and house price\n\nCredit to households\nHouse price\n\n% growth year on year\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nNote: House price is the deposit for a 2-year lease on an \napartment under the jeonse system.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 February 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.12.9\u2002 Unemployment rate for population \n\naged 15\u201324\n\nJapan\nRepublic of Korea\nOECD\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015 2016\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment.\nSource: OECD Labor statistics (accessed 24 January 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f192(cid:141)(cid:141)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n5.7% in 2000 to a 17-year record high of 9.6%, almost 3 times \nthe overall unemployment rate of 3.3%. Unemployment \nin the 15\u201329 age group rose to 9.2%, also a 17-year high \n(Figure\u00a03.12.10). \n\nThe increase in youth employment re\ufb02ects in part weaker \n\neconomic performance since the global \ufb01nancial crisis of \n2008\u20132009 and a rising population of young job seekers, but \nalso structural issues in the ROK labor market. While the \ufb01rst \ntwo factors will be alleviated by economic and demographic \ntrends in the coming years, a proactive policy is needed to \naddress two entrenched labor market de\ufb01ciencies.\n\nFirst, labor market in\ufb02exibility means low turnover for \n\nsecure, well-paid jobs, mostly in larger corporations, and \nfew good prospects for young job seekers. Second, small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) offer lower wages \nand bene\ufb01ts than large corporations or the public sector \nbut provide 80% of private sector employment. OECD data \nshow that, owing to these structural issues, young ROK \nworkers enjoy less job security and earn less than other age \ngroups (Figure 3.12.11). The problem is not a lack of skills, \nas the unemployed in the ROK are better educated than the \nOECD\u00a0average. Rather, unsatisfactory working conditions at \nSMEs prompt young adults to spend many years preparing \nfor secure public sector jobs rather than seek immediate \nemployment in an SME. Indeed, 45.2% of young job seekers \nremained economically inactive in 2017 as they prepared \nfor public sector job examinations, and 32.5% of new hires \nat SMEs quit their jobs within a year (Figure\u00a03.12.12). As a \nresult, SMEs face the twin problems of labor shortage and \nskills mismatch, re\ufb02ected in their high vacancy rate of 12.6% \nin the \ufb01rst half of 2017, nearly 3 times the 4.6% rate for large \ncompanies. \n\nROK demographics are among the fastest-changing in the \nworld and may eventually alleviate the youth unemployment \nproblem. The twentysomething cohort is still expanding \ndespite an aging population overall, but it will peak in 2019 by \nsome estimates and start to decline. As in Japan, the ROK will \nlikely experience an abundance of jobs for younger workers \nover the medium term. In the short term, however, tackling \nyouth unemployment requires concerted efforts to address the \ntwin problems of low job quality and high expectations in a \nlargely university-educated young population.\n\nThe government plans to reduce youth unemployment by \ncreating public sector jobs. However, the capacity of the public \nsector to absorb the rising number of job seekers is limited, and \ngovernment employment should re\ufb02ect demand for government \nservices, not unemployment.\n\n3.12.10\u2002Unemployment of youth population \n\nAll ages\n15\u201329 years old\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\nSource: Korea Development Institute.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.12.11\u2002 OECD job quality, 2012\n\nPopulation 15\u201329\nPopulation 30\u201349\nPopulation 50\u201364\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nLabor market\ninsecurity\n\nUnemployment\nrisk\n\nEarnings\nquality\n\nAverage\nearnings\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment.\nNotes: Higher values re\ufb02ect better job quality.

It \nhas taken steps to attract foreign talent, including legislation to \nrelax regulations on visas, residency, health insurance, taxes, \nand retirement bene\ufb01ts. However, these measures have to be \ncomplemented by policies that allocate to talented workers a \nlarger share of the prosperity generated by economic growth. \nData on the evolution of real wages by skill category and \n\nproductivity growth are not available, forestalling a robust \nexamination of compensation for talented workers, but indications \nare that real wages for this group of workers have not kept pace \nwith rising prosperity. Real wages actually declined in 3 of the \n6 years from 2012 to 2017 (Figure 3.13.6). Average real wage \ngrowth by sector did not fare any better. It\u00a0reached 4.5% only in \nelectronic components and was below 2.0% in 44 of 48 categories \nmeasured. Surprisingly, real wage growth rates for professionals \nworking in information and communication services and scienti\ufb01c \ntechnology services\u2014the backbone of the impressive export \nperformance\u2014were both a mere 0.06%. Moreover, the growth rate \nof the average annual real wage (or total wages earned divided \nby the number of workers) was higher than growth in GDP per \ncapita only in\u00a02015, when economic performance was particularly \nweak as exports fell sharply. This indicates that growth in \nwage income lagged growth in other forms of income, creating \nincentives for talented workers to seek employment abroad.\n\nThese trends point to inadequate rewards for skilled human \n\ncapital, which could partly re\ufb02ect labor market rigidity that \nsuppresses signals regarding supply and demand for talented \nworkers. Without government intervention to create the right \nincentives to reward talent better, competitiveness in human \ncapital may suffer, preventing progress in technology and \ninnovation, creating incentives for talented workers to seek \nemployment abroad. \n\nThe government has addressed labor market concerns by \nsetting minimum wages, encouraging labor force participation, \nand providing favorable bene\ufb01t packages in the public sector\u2014\naction that has been helpful but insufficient. The labor market \nneeds to be more \ufb02exible and transparent, especially under \ncurrent tight market conditions re\ufb02ected in a low unemployment \nrate below 4%. In addition to speeding up current pension \nreform to improve mobility, insurance, and retirement bene\ufb01ts \nfor talented workers, the government should ensure that real \nwages and bene\ufb01ts clearly re\ufb02ect demand for skilled and talented \nlabor. One step in this direction would be to include all bene\ufb01t \ninformation explicitly and clearly in the compensation package, \nfor job seekers to see. A better remuneration package can also \nstem the \ufb02ow of talented workers seeking employment overseas.\n\n\f\fsouth AsiA\n\nAfghAnistAn\u2002\u2022\n\nbAnglAdesh\u2002\u2022\n\nbhutAn\u2002\u2022\n\nindiA\u2002\u2022\n\nmAldives\u2002\u2022\n\nnepAl\u2002\u2022\n\npAkistAn\u2002\u2022\n\nsri lAnkA\u2002\u2022\n\n\f\fAfghanistan\n\nEconomic growth inched up to 2.5% in 2017 as security and political challenges continued \nto  weigh  heavily  on  the  economy.  Good  progress  on  domestic  revenue  collection  was \ninsufficient  to  counter  declining  grants.  The  outlook  is  tempered  by  continuing  security \nconcerns  and  possible  political  instability  with  elections  scheduled  over  the  next  2  years. \nEconomic growth, job creation, and reducing reliance on foreign aid will depend heavily on \nattracting  private  investment.\n\nEconomic performance \nAs in 2016, a tenuous political situation and worsening security \nlimited economic growth in 2017. GDP growth accelerated \nmarginally to 2.5% from 2.4% in 2016 (Figure 3.14.1). \nAgriculture, industry, and services all grew. Wheat production \nwas lower in 2017 than in 2016 for lack of precipitation. \nInstead, a sharp 16.6% rise in fruit production and a near \ndoubling in current prices of value added in fruit helped to \ndrive growth in agriculture. \n\nDomestic investment remained steady, equal to 18.5% of \nGDP. Private investment is estimated at only 8.0% of GDP in \n2017, re\ufb02ecting a lack of con\ufb01dence in political and security \nconditions. Public investment, measured as spending from the \ngovernment development budget, increased by 8% in nominal \nterms over 2016 as the execution rate improved from 54% that \nyear to 67% in 2017 with better budget planning, simpli\ufb01ed \nexecution rules, and more authority delegated to line ministries.\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported an \n\n87% increase in opium production in 2017 to a record high of \nabout 9,000 tons. The area under poppy cultivation jumped by \n63% over the previous year, and a 15% improvement in opium \nyield per hectare contributed to the sharp rise. The farm-gate \nvalue of opium rose by more than half to hit $1.4 billion, equal \nto 7% of Afghanistan\u2019s licit GDP. \n\nConsumer in\ufb02ation peaked at 7.5% year on year in May 2017 \n\nbut dropped to 3.1% in December (Figure 3.14.2). Volatility in \nin\ufb02ation came from swings in food prices with the temporary \nclosure of border crossings with Pakistan, which affected \nfood imports. Food in\ufb02ation was highest in June at 10.9% but \neventually dropped to 4.6% in December. Average in\ufb02ation \nstood at 5.0% in 2017, up from 4.4% in 2016, and was driven by \nfood price in\ufb02ation, which averaged 7.0%. Nonfood in\ufb02ation \naveraged 3.2%, unchanged from the average a year earlier. \n\nThis chapter was written by David Old\ufb01eld and Fatima Catacutan of the \nCentral and West Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n%\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n3.14.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n2.7\n\n1.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimates\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: World Bank.

Despite \nthe increase, domestic revenue remains low at less than 12% of \nGDP. Grants comprise an estimated 56% of budget revenue, or \n15.6% of GDP. While government efforts have broadly succeeded \nin maintaining \ufb01scal and external stability, efforts to set a \nbudget for 2018 point to growing tension between, on the one \nhand, expanding security and development spending and, on the \nother, ensuring that \ufb01nancing arrangements are consistent with \ncontinued macroeconomic stability. \n\nGrowth in broad money supply (M2) fell to 4.1% in 2017 \nfrom 9.7% in 2016, with lending to the private sector sluggish \nand growth in currency in circulation slowing (Figure 3.14.3). \nDemand for credit was weak in light of the fragile security \nsituation and poor macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, banks \nare cautious about extending credit because of the high share \nof nonperforming loans, about 12% of the total in December \n2017, and the difficulty of evaluating credit risk in the uncertain \ninvestment environment. Deposit dollarization remains high \nat\u00a062%. \n\nFollowing short-lived appreciation in 2016, the afghani \ndepreciated only slightly in 2017 despite a slowdown in official \ngrant in\ufb02ows, increased contractual payments in the second \nhalf of the year, and escalating political tensions (Figure 3.14.4). \n\nThe current account surplus including net transfers is \nestimated to have narrowed from the equivalent of 7.1% of GDP \nin 2016 to 4.5% in 2017 because of higher imports and lower \nofficial grants (Figure\u00a03.14.5). Excluding grants of $7.9 billion, \nthe current account would be a very large de\ufb01cit equal to 30.8% \nof GDP. The merchandise trade de\ufb01cit widened to $6.7 billion. \nExports rose from $0.6 billion in 2016 to $0.7\u00a0billion in 2017 but \nremained far too weak to fund imports. Exports were boosted \nby the commencement of an air corridor linking Afghanistan \nand India that facilitated higher sales of Afghan fruit. \n\nGross international reserves rose to $8.2 billion in 2017 \nfrom $7.6\u00a0billion in 2016, providing cover for 13 months of \nimports (Figure\u00a03.14.6). Given the country\u2019s weak external \nposition, government policy strictly limits external borrowing. \nExternal debt is manageable, falling to the equivalent of 6.1% of \nGDP in 2017 from 6.3% a year earlier.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook is for subdued GDP growth in 2018 and 2019. \nGrowth is projected to remain at 2.5% in 2018 and 2019 (Figure \n3.14.7). The security and political situations are the two crucial \ndeterminants of the economic outlook, other important factors \nbeing agriculture and the amount of foreign aid. Security is \nunstable, particularly in Kabul, with high-pro\ufb01le terror attacks \n\n3.14.3\u2002Monetary indicators\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet claims on central government\nClaims on private sector\n\n% of money supply\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: International Monetary Fund.

The country is likely to experience \ngreater political uncertainty from friction within the National \nUnity Government. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for \n2018 and a presidential election in 2019, which could cause \nbusinesses to adopt a wait-and-see approach. \n\nPrecipitation was scarce in late 2017 and early 2018. If it \n\ndoes not pick up, agriculture could be affected, at least in the \n\ufb01rst harvest of 2018. Progress on structural reform under \nthe Extended Credit Facility program should help to boost \neconomic activity in 2018\u20132019 and beyond. However, declining \ngrants may diminish public investment. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to remain at 5% in 2018 and 2019, \nbarring major shocks such as greatly intensi\ufb01ed insurgent \nactivity or a signi\ufb01cant increase in returnees from Pakistan. \nFood price in\ufb02ation may spike if agricultural output suffers \nunder extended dry weather. The afghani\u2013US dollar exchange \nrate has been relatively stable recently, and the central bank \nis expected to prevent undue volatility and keep an orderly \nmanaged \ufb02oat for the afghani.\n\nSetting the 2018 budget follows a new process that is more \n\nin line with international standards. It presents a medium-\nterm expenditure framework with estimates for revenue and \nexpenditure for the budget year and the next 3 years. The budget \nnow consolidates the operating and development budgets, \neliminates carryover of previous year commitments, and is more \nrealistic than past budgets, which overestimated expenditure. \nBudget revenue including grants for 2018 is forecast to \ndecline from 26.5% of GDP in 2017 to 24.3% in 2018 and 22.5% \nin 2019. Domestic revenue in 2018 is targeted to reach 11.7% of \nGDP, with tax reform and improved administration, and then \nrise further to 11.8% in 2019. Higher domestic revenue will \nnot compensate, however, for the decline in grants. Grants are \nprojected to provide 54% of budget revenue in 2018, falling to \nless than 50% in 2019 as the declining trend continues. \n\nExpenditure is budgeted to rise to AF377 billion in 2018, a \n4.4% increase and equal to 25.4% of GDP. In 2019, expenditure \nis forecast to fall to 25.0% of GDP with declining grants. \nThe stress caused by the decline in grants is evident in the \nprojected 2018 budget de\ufb01cit of AF16 billion, or 1.1% of GDP. \nThe current account surplus including grants is forecast \nto shrink to 3.3% of GDP in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019 as grants \ndecline and imports remain high. Exports are forecast to grow \nby about 20% in 2018 and 25% in 2019. Exports of fruits and \nmedicinal plants in particular have potential for high growth \nrates with the new Afghanistan\u2013India air corridor and the \nopening of the \ufb01rst phase of Chabahar port in Iran in late 2017. \nChabahar opened a new transit route linking Afghanistan, \nIndia, and Iran. The port and the trilateral agreement on the \nInternational Transport and Transit Corridor should facilitate \nhigher exports from Afghanistan in the coming years. \n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3.14.6\u2002International reserves\n\nGross international reserves\n\nImport cover\n\n$ billion\n\nmonths of imports\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund.

This shortcoming is a major constraint on \neconomic growth, job creation, and reducing dependence on \nforeign aid.\n\nPoor security is the fundamental cause of low investment, \n\nhaving stymied large foreign investment in mining projects for \nyears, but other factors have also been deterrents, especially for \nsmaller investors: political tensions since 2014, the dearth of \ninfrastructure, corruption and bureaucratic red tape, shortages \nof technical and managerial skills, and de\ufb01ciency in upholding \nthe rule of law, particularly on commercial and investment \nmatters. \n\nDespite these impediments, Afghanistan can appeal as a \nfrontier economy. The risks are high, but the rewards can be \nas well. High-risk countries affected by violence can attract \nsizeable investments because they frequently have untapped \nresources, large reconstruction needs, and unmet consumer \ndemand. Afghanistan \ufb01ts this pro\ufb01le. \n\nClearly, investment will not meet full potential until the \nsecurity situation improves, but measures can be taken now to \nbegin to attract more private investment and build toward a \nbrighter future. To begin, a coordinated government approach \nis needed to move the country forward by raising investors\u2019 \ncon\ufb01dence. The government will also need to continue efforts \nto create a better environment for investment and economic \nactivity (Box 3.14.1). The legal and regulatory framework \nhas improved but is still developing and incomplete. This is \nparticularly evident in mining, which is expected to be a key \ndriver of growth in the medium term. \n\nA targeted and systematic strategy to promote investment \n\nand investor services could reap bene\ufb01ts in the short and \nmedium term. This could include creating investment \nopportunities for companies with experience operating in \ncon\ufb02ict-affected countries, investors in neighboring countries \nwho are familiar with local conditions, and the Afghan \ndiaspora, which has played a large role in developing the \neconomy since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. \n\nFinally, the government should maintain its efforts toward \n\nregional cooperation. Connectivity and open trade with \nneighbors can attract more private investment as regional \nmarkets become more open. On top of the commercial \nbene\ufb01ts of regional cooperation, a peace dividend would give \nneighboring countries a greater stake in peace and stability in \nAfghanistan through economic links and opportunities.\n\n\fBangladesh\n\nGrowth exceeded expectations despite slower export expansion and declining remittances. \nInflation  eased,  but  the  current  account  fell  into  deficit.  Growth  is  expected  to  moderate \nin  fiscal  2018  as  growth  in  agriculture  and  services  slows.  Inflation  will  edge  up  and  the \ncurrent  account  deficit  widen.  Sustained  high  growth  demands  an  expanded  industrial \nbase  and  a  diversified  export  basket,  which  depend  in  turn  on  filling  large  infrastructure \ndeficits  and  implementing  policy  reform.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP grew by 7.3% in \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended \n30\u00a0June\u00a02017), edging up from 7.1% a year earlier (Figure\u00a03.15.1). \nThe pickup mainly re\ufb02ected acceleration in private consumption \nexpenditure, despite falling remittances, and continued growth \nin public infrastructure investment. Private investment rose \nmarginally. With faster expansion in import volume while \nexports stagnated, net exports subtracted from growth. \nAt\u00a0$1.7\u00a0billion, foreign direct investment equaled less than 1.0% \nof GDP.\n\nOn the supply side, agriculture grew by 3.0%, up from 2.8% \n\nthe year before. Despite staple crop losses to heavy rain and \nprolonged \ufb02ooding, good performance in other subsectors\u2014\nhorticulture, animal husbandry, forestry, and \ufb01shing\u2014buoyed \nagricultural output overall. Industry growth slowed to 10.2% \nfrom 11.1% largely on weaker growth in medium- and large-\nscale manufacturing as garment production stagnated. Services \ngrowth accelerated to 6.7% from 6.3%, mainly on higher \ngrowth in wholesale and retail trade and in transport services.\nDespite food in\ufb02ation trending higher during the year as \nweather induced rice shortages, average in\ufb02ation decelerated \nto 5.4% from 5.9% as nonfood in\ufb02ation slowed. This re\ufb02ected \nthe conservative monetary policy of Bangladesh Bank, the \ncentral bank, and a stable exchange rate. In\ufb02ation rose to 5.9% \nyear on year in June 2017, from 5.5% a year earlier, as food \nin\ufb02ation accelerated to 7.5% from 4.2% and nonfood in\ufb02ation \ndecelerated to 3.7% from 7.5% (Figure 3.15.2).\n\nGrowth in broad money slowed in FY2017 to 10.9%, well \nbelow the monetary program target of 15.5% (Figure 3.15.3). \nThe slowdown came mainly from a sharp decline in net credit \nto the government as it turned to borrowing more through the \n\nThis chapter was written by Jyotsana Varma, Soon Chan Hong, Md.

Private credit growth was \nclose to its target of 16.5% as private investment picked up. \nExpansion in net foreign assets slowed on a smaller increase in \ncentral bank foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe central bank kept its repo and reverse repo policy \n\nrates unchanged in FY2017, but ample liquidity in the \nbanking system meant that interest rates continued to decline \n(Figure\u00a03.15.4). The call money rate remained stable under \neasing liquidity pressure. The weighted average yield on 91-day \nTreasury bills declined to 3.7% in June 2017 from 4.0% a year \nearlier. Banks\u2019 weighted average lending rate eased to 9.6% \nfrom 10.3% in the same period, while the weighted average \ndeposit rate declined to 4.8% from 5.4%, narrowing banks\u2019 \ninterest rate spread by 0.2 percentage points to 4.7 points. \nNonperforming loans in state-owned commercial banks \ncontinued to be a major issue as, despite remedial policies, their \ngross prevalence increased to 29.3% of all loans at the end of \nSeptember 2017 from 25.2% a year earlier. \n\nBudget revenue as a share of GDP remained very low \n\nat 10.2%, continuing to constrain a more rapid pace of \ndevelopment even as it rose slightly from 10.0% in the previous \nyear. Tax collection by the National Board of Revenue grew by \n19.0% in FY2017 but still fell short of the high budget target. \nNontax revenue collection was below target. Expenditure \nwas lower than budgeted and declined to equal 13.2% of \nGDP from 13.8% a year earlier. Strengthened monitoring \nof public spending through a new integrated budget and \naccounting system helped moderate current spending, curb \npublic spending as a share of GDP, and make it more effective. \nThe\u00a0budget de\ufb01cit declined to the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP \nin FY2017 from 3.8% in FY2016, well below the 5.0% budget \ntarget (Figure 3.15.5). \n\nExports grew marginally in FY2017, by 1.7%, down from \n8.9% a year earlier. Garment exports grew by a scant 0.2%, \ndown from 10.2% in FY2016. The slump re\ufb02ected much \nweaker demand in major markets in the euro area and the US, \nas\u00a0well\u00a0as an infrastructure de\ufb01cit that kept exporters from \n\ufb01lling some orders. Other exports grew rapidly at 8.5%. \n\nWith stepped-up domestic demand, growth in import \npayments accelerated to 9.0% from 5.9%, re\ufb02ecting solid \nincreases in most categories: food, investment and consumer \ngoods, and crude oil and petroleum products. Growth in \nintermediates for the garment industry, however, were modest. \n\nDespite expanded employment overseas, worker \nremittances fell by 14.5% in FY2017. The decline mostly \nre\ufb02ected economic adjustment to low oil prices in the\u00a0Gulf, \nwhich hosts most Bangladeshi migrant workers, that \ndepressed wages and employment.

The downturn re\ufb02ected a $3.0\u00a0billion \nwidening of the trade de\ufb01cit and a $2.1 billion fall in \nremittances, as well as continued small de\ufb01cits in the service \nand primary income accounts (Figure 3.15.6). The surplus in \nthe combined capital and \ufb01nancial accounts nevertheless rose \nto $4.5 billion, which lifted gross foreign exchange reserves \nin the central bank by $3.2 billion to $33.4 billion at the end of \nJune 2017, providing nearly 8 months of import cover. \n\nThe Bangladesh taka depreciated against the US dollar \nby 2.7% in nominal terms in the year to the end of June 2017 \n(Figure 3.15.7). Taking into account differences in in\ufb02ation, \nthe taka appreciated by 2.4% in real effective terms, eroding \ncompetitiveness. \n\nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange broad index rose by 25.5% \n\nover the year to June 2017, reaching 5,656.1 points as the \nprice\u2013earnings ratio rose to 15.7 from 14.6 (Figure 3.15.8). \nMarket capitalization rose by 19.3% in the period, but it \nremains relatively small, equivalent to 19% of GDP. Only four \nnew companies were listed in FY2017. While stock prices on \nthe exchange increased broadly in line with those in other \nemerging markets in Asia over FY2017, net foreign portfolio \ninvestment surged to $458 million from $139 million in FY2016.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is expected to moderate to 7.0% in FY2018 as \nconsumption demand slackens despite a rebound in worker \nremittances (Figure 3.15.9). Remittance bene\ufb01ciaries are \nlikely to adopt a cautious approach to spending, repaying \ndebt incurred in recent years of remittance declines. \nPrivate\u00a0investment is nevertheless expected to edge up with \nsupport from an accommodative credit policy, and public \ninvestment will expand as the authorities seek to speed the \nimplementation of infrastructure projects. Export performance \nis expected to strengthen on projected higher growth in the \neuro area and the US. However, net exports will not add to \ngrowth, as imports are expected to expand strongly with \nsubstantial restocking of food grains, rising fuel requirements, \nand a steady increase in imports of capital goods.\n\nBroadly favorable global growth and trade prospects are \nexpected to continue in FY2019. With a further strengthening \nof exports and remittances, GDP growth that year is expected \nto \ufb01rm to 7.2%. A marked stepping up of budget revenue \nmobilization could fuel a somewhat stronger advance in \ninvestment and therefore growth, but FY2019 budget policies \nwill become known only when announced later. \n\nOn the supply side, agriculture growth is expected to \nmoderate to 2.3% in FY2018 from 3.0% last year because it \n\nNet income\nNet services\nImports\nExports\nRemittances\nOther net transfers\n\n$ billion   \n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\nCurrent account\n\n% of GDP\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Bangladesh Bank. 2017.

Industry growth \nis forecast to pick up slightly to 10.4%, underpinned by higher \nexports. Expansion in services is likely to slow to 6.4% from \n6.7% in the previous year as consumer spending moderates and \ngrowth in agriculture income slows.\n\nIn FY2019, agriculture growth is projected to be slightly \nhigher at 2.5% as higher rice prices encourage farmers to plant \nmore of the staple crop. With an expected improvement in \ndomestic and external demand, industry growth will likely be \nstronger at 10.6%, as services edge up to 6.5%.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to accelerate to average 6.1% in FY2018. \n\nFood in\ufb02ation averaged just over 7% year on year in the \ufb01rst \nhalf because of crop losses from the \ufb02ooding, but it eased from \na peak of 7.9% in September 2017 to 7.1% in December with \nimports of food grains and the arrival in markets of a newly \nharvested crop. Rice prices will nevertheless remain higher \nthan last year. Nonfood in\ufb02ation has remained broadly stable, \naveraging 3.5% in the \ufb01rst half of the year, but is expected to \nbe higher in the second half because of anticipated upward \nadjustments to natural gas and electricity prices, higher global \noil prices, and taka depreciation.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to edge up to 6.3% in FY2019 because \n\nof further increases in natural gas and electricity prices and \ncontinued taka depreciation. However, normal weather and \nprojected stability in global oil prices should temper price \npressures compared with this year. \n\nThe monetary policy statement for the second half of \n\nFY2018 (January\u2013June 2018) focuses on monetary and \nprudential policies to moderate high import growth in the \n\ufb01rst half toward a sustainable trend and to contain a possible \nrise in in\ufb02ationary expectations re\ufb02ecting higher food and \nenergy prices. The central bank kept the main policy repo rate \nunchanged at 6.75% and decided to intensively supervise credit \n\ufb02ows to ensure their quality and composition appropriate for \nproductive use, rather than resort to broader restrictions on \ncredit. The declining trend in government borrowing from \nbanks allowed the central bank to adjust earlier monetary \ntargets to accommodate slightly higher growth in credit to \nthe private sector, at 16.8% in the second half of FY2018 after \novershooting its target in the \ufb01rst half. A likely decline in net \nforeign assets will keep broad money growth a bit lower than \noriginally projected. \n\nExports rebounded by 7.4% in the \ufb01rst 8 months of \n\nFY2018, up from 2.7% growth in the same period a year \nearlier as garment sales accelerated to 8.7% growth from 2.8% \n(Figure\u00a03.15.10). Given stronger projected growth in the euro \narea and the US, exports are expected to increase by 7.0% in \nFY2018. With a continued favorable global outlook, export \ngrowth is projected at 9.0% in FY2019. \n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3.15.8\u2002Dhaka stock exchange indicators\n\nMarket capitalization\n\nBroad index\n\nTk trillion\n\nIndex\n\n7,000\n\n5,000\n\n3,000\n\n1,000\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nNote: Dotted line denotes the end of \ufb01scal 2017.\nSource: Dhaka Stock Exchange. 2017.

Taking into account \nfood grain restocking in the \ufb01rst half and central bank policy \nmeasures, imports in the second half are forecast to moderate \nto 17.0% growth in FY2018 and 14.0% in FY2019. \n\nWorker remittances rebounded to expand by 16.6% in the \n\n\ufb01rst 8 months of FY2018, re\ufb02ecting reduced bank fees and \ncharges and 1\u00a0million workers going abroad in 2017, the highest \nnumber in about a decade (Figure 3.15.11). As the dynamics of \nthe recovery stabilize, remittances are expected to grow by \n10.0% in FY2018 and by 9.0% in FY2019.\n\nDespite rising remittances and exports, the current account \n\nde\ufb01cit is expected to widen further to equal 2.2% of GDP in \nFY2018 as import demand rises (Figure 3.15.12). With monetary \npolicy beginning to moderate import demand, the FY2019 \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit is projected lower, at 1.9% of GDP. \nThe taka depreciated by 4.3% against the US dollar in \nFebruary 2018 from the same period last year and is expected \nto depreciate further in response to the large current account \nde\ufb01cit. To avoid excessive volatility in the foreign exchange \nmarket, the central bank sold $1.1 billion to meet demand for \nforeign currency in this period. By December 2017, the taka had \ndepreciated by 6.8% in real effective terms from a year earlier, \nindicating a gain in competitiveness.\n\nThe FY2018 budget, announced in June 2017, projected \nthat revenue growth at 31.8% would outpace spending growth \nat 26.2%. Annual development spending was slated to grow \nby 38.5% to accelerate the implementation of some large \ninfrastructure projects including the Padma Bridge, Dhaka \nMetro Rail, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Payra Port, and \ncoal-\ufb01red power plants at Rampal and Matarbari. Revenue\u00a0was \nprojected to rise to equal 13.0% of GDP, and public spending \n18.0%, both signi\ufb01cant increases from the previous year. \nAttaining these large increases will be challenging, and \nshortfalls on both sides of the ledger are likely to yield a \nde\ufb01cit on target at 5.0% of GDP. In the \ufb01rst 7 months of \nFY2018, revenues grew by 15.3% and development program \nimplementation by 33.4%. \n\nThe ratio of government debt to GDP has declined slightly \n\nover time and is quite low for developing Asia. External \ndebt amounted to 11.4% of GDP in FY2017, re\ufb02ecting the \ngovernment\u2019s continued preference for concessional external \nborrowing. Domestic debt amounted to 15.7% of GDP. \n\nThe outlook is subject to downside risks. The current \naccount de\ufb01cit may deteriorate further if policies to rein in \nimport demand do not succeed. Failure to boost revenues and \ntap foreign \ufb01nancing could unduly limit spending on needed \ninfrastructure. Political uncertainty ahead of national elections \nexpected by December 2018 could undermine consumer and \n\n%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3.15.11\u2002Remittances growth\n\n16.6\n\n12.6\n\n7.7\n\n\u20131.6\n\n\u20132.5\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\n\u201314.5\n\n\u201317.0\nJul\u2013Feb\n2017\n\nJul\u2013Feb\n2018\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: Bangladesh Bank.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.15.12\u2002Current account balance \n\n% of GDP\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nForecast\n\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Bangladesh Bank. 2017.

This points to the need for new drivers of \ngrowth. Diversifying exports away from readymade garments, \nnow accounting for over 80% of the total, would broaden the \nexport basket, enhance resilience, and underpin continued high \neconomic growth. Promoting labor-intensive manufacturing in \ngeneral would help expand industry to meet growing demand \nin the domestic market. \n\nBangladesh has good potential in several industries: leather \n\nand footwear, light engineering, electronics, pharmaceuticals, \nfurniture, shipbuilding, jute products, food processing, \nautomobiles, and rubber goods. These industries could leverage \nthe country\u2019s large supply of low-cost labor and advantageous \nlocation to garner participation in various stages of global value \nchains and enter new markets. Some of these products would \nenjoy a sizeable domestic market. Having recently experienced \nquick success in exporting software and other information and \ncommunication technology products, Bangladesh can expect to \nbecome a player in this fast-growing \ufb01eld. \n\nHowever, the World Bank ranked Bangladesh 177 out of \n190 economies in Doing Business 2018. To translate potential \ninto concrete development outcomes, this poor ranking shows, \nthe country needs to improve its business environment and \nthereby reduce costs. The Bangladesh Investment Development \nAuthority is implementing a detailed action plan of business \nreform to correct de\ufb01ciencies across all indicators. \n\nnear the bottom globally in commercial access to basic \ninfrastructure such as electricity, roads, and railways. In its \nGlobal Competitiveness Report 2017\u20132018, the World Economic \nForum ranked Bangladesh 111 out of 137 economies in the \nquality of its infrastructure\u2014behind India, Pakistan, and \nSri Lanka (Figure 3.15.14). Major ongoing investments in the \ngovernment\u2019s Annual Development Programme aim to relieve \nthe most severe bottlenecks. Bangladesh needs to improve its \ntrade infrastructure and logistics.

The \nimplementation of the new value-added tax law, which was \ndeferred again last year, needs to be accomplished without \ndelay to generate the additional revenue that is essential for \ninfrastructure investment. To foster greater productivity \nand competitiveness in domestic manufacturing, import \ntariffs need to be lowered and rationalized. More attention \nto strengthening bank performance would expand access to \n\ufb01nance for the private sector. \n\nBangladesh faces an acute shortage of personnel with \nthe technical and managerial skills needed to diversify the \neconomy and make it more competitive globally. Meeting these \nneeds will require the government to boost resources and \nprograms devoted to training in this critical area.\n\nFinally, most economic activity is concentrated in and \naround Dhaka and Chittagong. To ensure balanced regional \ndevelopment and take advantage of its natural endowments, \nBangladesh is promoting economic zones that provide serviced \nindustrial land and infrastructure to attract investors and \nspur efforts to diversify the manufacturing base. Two such \nzones, the Mirsarai Economic Zone near Chittagong and the \nShreehatta Economic Zone near Sylhet, are expected to begin \noperations in the near future. A comprehensive development \nplan for the Southwest Bangladesh Economic Corridor has \nbeen prepared to advance government plans to establish \neconomic corridors.\n\n\fBhutan \n\nGrowth  edged  up  in  fiscal  2017  on  moderate  advances  in  industry  and  services.  Inflation \npushed  slightly  higher,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed.  The  outlook  is  for \ncontinued  strong,  stable  growth,  but  the  delayed  completion  of  two  large  hydropower \nplants has postponed a sharp upturn that was forecast earlier. Despite sustained economic \nprogress, youth unemployment has been worsening. The government is responding with a \nrange  of  new  programs  and  policies.\n\nEconomic performance\nStrong growth strengthened a bit more in \ufb01scal year 2017 \n(FY2017, ended 30 June 2017) as industry and services were \nthe main drivers of expansion to 7.5% from 7.3% in the \nprevious\u00a0year (Figure 3.16.1). Growth in agriculture slackened \na bit because of destructive rains in the wet monsoon. \nIndustry\u00a0growth edged up to 7.7% as construction on \nhydropower plants continued and projects under the Eleventh \nFive\u00a0Year Plan, 2013\u20132018 approached completion. Electricity \ngeneration improved, particularly at the large Tala Hydropower \nPlant, on better water \ufb02ow during the year. Services were up \nby 9.2% with growth acceleration in tourism and hospitality \nservices and with expanded retail and wholesale trade. \n\nOn the demand side, growth in GDP was lifted by sustained \n\nincreases in \ufb01xed capital investment and consumption. \nHowever, the major contributor to expansion in FY2017 was \nthe pronounced contribution of net exports as export volume \nmarkedly increased, particularly of electricity and minerals, \nwhile import volume declined, largely re\ufb02ecting scaled-\ndown needs for materials used to build hydropower plants \n(Figure\u00a03.16.2).\n\nIn\ufb02ation was higher and volatile in FY2017 but \ufb01nally \nheld to an average of 4.3%, up from 3.3% in the previous year \n(Figure 3.16.3). The\u00a0pickup in in\ufb02ation largely re\ufb02ected higher \nfood prices, both in India\u2014 the major source of supply\u2014and \ndomestically because of excessively heavy monsoon rains, \ndistribution problems, and the imposition of import restrictions \non vegetables. While overall in\ufb02ation hovered at around 5% \nyear on year in the second half of FY2017, it fell to 3.3% in \nDecember 2017, re\ufb02ecting the impact of the lower import prices \nfollowing the implementation of India\u2019s goods and services tax. \n\nThis chapter was written by Kanokpan Lao-Araya and Tshewang Norbu of \nthe Bhutan Resident Mission, ADB, Thimphu, and Danileen Parel, consultant, \nSouth Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.16.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.6\n\n4.0\n\n7.3\n\n7.5\n\n6.2\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: National Statistics Bureau.

Government resources grew \nby 13.9%, amounting to just over 30% of GDP. The budget \nde\ufb01cit widened to the equivalent of 4.1% of GDP from 1.1% in \nthe previous year, with about 85% of the de\ufb01cit \ufb01nanced by \ndomestic sources. \n\nMonetary policy aimed to manage credit to avoid \n\noverheating yet foster rapid and inclusive economic growth. \nDomestic credit expanded by 29.5% in FY2017, re\ufb02ecting the \nneed to \ufb01nance most of the larger budget de\ufb01cit but also a \n15.4% increase in credit to the private sector. Broad money \ngrowth doubled to 31.5%, roughly in line with expanded \ndomestic credit (Figure 3.16.5). Net foreign assets in the \nbanking system grew only marginally.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed markedly in FY2017 \n\nbut remained high at the equivalent of 23.0% of GDP, the \nimprovement coming mostly from a narrower trade de\ufb01cit \n(Figure 3.16.6). Nearly two-thirds of the improvement in the \ntrade account came thanks to larger exports as hydropower \nsales to India improved by volume and fetched higher prices, \nand as exports of mineral products and base metals expanded to \nBangladesh and Nepal. The rest of the improvement in the trade \naccount came from a 3.4% decline in imports as the import \nintensity of investment and consumption spending fell slightly. \n\nThe services de\ufb01cit shrank as receipts from tourists \n\npaying in both Indian rupees and convertible currency raised \nthe travel surplus. The primary income de\ufb01cit widened with \ngrowth in interest payments on external debt. Secondary \nincome remained in surplus despite a decline in grants owing \nto the receipt of an excise duty refund from the Government of \nIndia for the previous \ufb01scal year.\n\nGross international reserves declined slightly, by 3.6% \n\nto $1.1 billion, or cover for 12.2 months of merchandise \nimports (Figure 3.16.7). Indian rupee reserves increased to \nthe equivalent of 5.2 months of imports from 4.3 months. \nThis change is re\ufb02ected in a decline in the share convertible \ncurrency reserves to 64% of total reserves. This shift in reserve \ncurrency composition was decided based on an assessment of \nBhutan\u2019s reserve management strategy.\n\nGovernment external debt increased by about 8% to \n\n$2.5\u00a0billion in FY2017, mainly on higher borrowing for \nhydropower projects, which now amounts to 69.2% of \nall external debt (Figure 3.16.8). The external debt ratio \nnevertheless improved to equal 102.5% of GDP, down from \n111.5% because GDP continued to grow rapidly. Debt servicing \ntemporarily increased to take about a quarter of export \nearnings, from just 14.5% in the previous year, because Bhutan \nrepaid a currency swap received from the Reserve Bank of \nIndia in FY2016.\n\n3.16.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nNonfood\nOverall \n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nNote: Dotted line denotes the end of \ufb01scal 2017.\nSource: National Statistics Bureau.

Services are expected to be the main \ndriver of the economy as wholesale and retail businesses and \ntourism continue to expand. Growth in industry is forecast to \nmoderate because the \ufb01nal stages of construction will slow a \nbit at two large hydropower plants, Punatsangchhu I and\u00a0II. \nIndustry growth will strengthen slightly in FY2019 because of \nthe expected commissioning of the Mangdechhu Hydropower \nPlant in September 2018, which will bolster electricity \nproduction and exports. \n\nAgriculture, a relatively small sector, is expected to \ngrow faster in FY2018 than last year on the assumption of \nnormal weather and on government efforts to introduce new \ncrops, improve productivity, and channel additional credit to \nagriculture as part of its agenda for \ufb01nancial inclusion.\n\nFiscal policy is expected to be less expansionary to the \n\nforecast horizon as capital expenditure falls off with the \nend of the current 5-year plan. Elections are set for both the \nNational\u00a0Council and the House of Representatives this year, \nand the formulation of the new government is expected in \nNovember 2018. Parliamentary endorsement of a new 5-year \nplan will follow. \n\nThe government projects the budget de\ufb01cit narrowing to \nthe equivalent of 2.5% of GDP in FY2018 as resources expand \non royalties from hydropower plants and tourism, and with \nadditional revenues from a higher power tariff. The de\ufb01cit is \nexpected to shrink further to 0.4% of GDP in FY2019 despite \nan expected decline in grants, mainly thanks to revenue from \nthe operation of the Mangdechhu Hydropower Plant and \ncapital expenditure bottoming out before the new plan goes \nfully into effect.\n\nbroadly in line with expected price trends in India. Goods and \nservices tax (GST) reform adopted by India in July 2017 bene\ufb01ts \nBhutan through lower import prices because export sales are \nzero rated under the GST. However, India has announced that \nit will raise guaranteed minimum support prices for certain \nagricultural goods, which may create in\ufb02ationary pressures in \nFY2019. Monetary policy will remain accommodative, placing \nstronger emphasis on \ufb01nancial inclusion and on \ufb01nancial \ndeepening to better channel credit to productive sectors.\nFuels were not subject to India\u2019s GST levy, but from \nOctober 2017, the Government of India agreed to exempt its \nfederal excise duty of 17% on petrol and 14% on diesel on \nexport sales to Bhutan. The Government of Bhutan decided \nto pass on the full bene\ufb01t of these exemptions to the public \nwithout imposing any offsetting local taxes, as it did in \nconnection with the July adoption of India\u2019s GST. \n\n3.16.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n\u2002\u20027.1\n\n\u2002\u20024.6\n\n\u201322.2\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20027.4\n\n\u2002\u20025.4\n\n\u201318.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.16.6\u2002Current account components\n\nPrimary income\nServices\nImports\nExports\nSecondary income\nCurrent account\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n-80\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan.

Imports will increase in \nFY2018, after a dip last year, as construction on hydropower \nplants continues and as lower import prices encourage \nconsumer spending and imports. The lower current account \nde\ufb01cit in FY2019 re\ufb02ects some easing in import growth \nand higher electricity exports from the new Mangdechhu \nHydropower\u00a0Plant.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014employing youth \nthrough training and cottage industries\nAlthough Bhutan has enjoyed remarkable economic progress, \ngrowth has not brought commensurate job creation for new \nentrants into the labor force. Youth unemployment has been \nincreasing, afflicting 4,813 young participants in the labor \nforce in 2016, or 13.2%, which is several times the overall \nunemployment rate of 2.1% (Figure 3.16.9). \n\nThe causes of high unemployment among the young are \nmany: a mismatch between the skills the young possess and \nthose that employers demand, a preference for office jobs over \nmanual or temporary work, limited absorption capacity in the \njob market and particularly in the public sector, and family \nsupport granted to young people while unemployed, sapping \ntheir motivation to pursue \ufb01nancial independence. \nSolutions to youth unemployment are likewise \n\nmultidimensional. The government initiated a targeted youth \nengagement program in January 2017 that aims to facilitate \ndirect employment both domestically and overseas, offer \nentrepreneurship development and training to promote \nself-employment and promote livelihood. In addition, a \ndevelopment partner is preparing a project that aims to support \nthe government\u2019s effort to reduce youth unemployment by \nexpanding and modernizing skills development programs in \ufb01ve \ntechnical training institutes, enhancing vocational orientation \nfor secondary school students, and forging performance-based \napprenticing partnerships with the private sector. \n\nCottage and small industries (CSIs) employ on average \nalmost \ufb01ve workers per enterprise. In 2017, such enterprises \nemployed 92,322 workers, or over 26% of the labor force. The \ngovernment has therefore identi\ufb01ed the CSI sector as having \ngreat potential for generating youth employment opportunities. \n\n\f216(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nVarious reforms are being undertaken to foster CSI startups. \nLimited \ufb01nance is a problem because high interest rates and \nonerous collateral requirements substantially restricted the \nability of CSI entrepreneurs to borrow capital for startup \nand expansion. To improve access to \ufb01nance, programs and \ninstitutions are being launched to provide collateral-free loans \nguaranteed by the government to quali\ufb01ed CSI applicants, \namong them are CSI banks created by the Royal Monetary \nAuthority. In addition, economic development policy in 2017 \nrequired \ufb01nancial institutions to devote at least 20% of their \nlending portfolio to priority sectors, including CSIs. \n\nPolicies to develop economic clusters have been initiated \nto allow CSIs to bene\ufb01t from common infrastructure to lower \ncosts and thereby enhance their efficiency and productivity. \nBecause CSI development involves multiple government \nagencies to handle its various issues, the Department of \nCottage and Small Industries under the Ministry of Economic \nAffairs will need to play an active role in coordinating the \nimplementation of the new initiatives.\n\n\fIndia\n\nEconomic  growth  slowed  to  6.6%  in  fiscal  2017  as  landmark  tax  reform  encountered \ntransitory  headwinds.  Inflation  eased,  and  the  current  account  deficit  widened  but \nremained  modest.  After  2  years  of  moderating  growth,  the  economy  is  projected  to \nrebound  on  stronger  domestic  demand,  aided  by  measures  to  spur  rural  incomes,  a \nmodest  uptick  in  investment  as  firms  and  banks  strive  to  improve  their  balance  sheets, \nand  an  improved  business  environment.\n\nOn balance, transitional forces weighed on economic growth \n\n3.17.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government launched the long-awaited goods and services \ntax (GST) on 1 July 2017, paving the way for a more integrated \nand efficient national economy, bolstered competitiveness \nin manufacturing, and a wider tax base. Teething issues in \nthe initial months affected mainly small and medium-sized \nenterprises and exporters facing higher compliance burdens \nand short of working capital because input tax refunds were \ndelayed. Headwinds came as well from the lingering effects \nof demonetization in November 2016, when the government \nsuddenly withdrew legal tender status from high-denomination \nbanknotes but experienced delays introducing new ones.\n\n(Figure\u00a03.17.1), which according to initial estimates slowed \nto 6.6% in \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended 31\u00a0March\u00a02018). \nLower\u00a0growth also re\ufb02ected subdued performance in \nagriculture, which grew by 3.0%. Food grain production only \nmarginally exceeded a good harvest a year earlier, but livestock \nand \ufb01sheries, which provide 41% of agricultural value added, \ngrew at robust rates.\n\nGrowth in industry slowed to 4.8% in FY2017 from \n6.8% in FY2016, primarily because manufacturing growth \nweakened to 5.1% from 7.9% a year earlier. Manufacturing in \nthe \ufb01rst half of FY2017 was affected by demonetization, which \nespecially affected the informal sector. Next, \ufb01rms cut back \nproduction to clear inventories before the introduction of the \nGST, then small and medium-sized enterprises in particular \nexperienced difficulties in adjusting to the new tax regime. \nManufacturing growth stepped up by quarter, however, \ufb01nally \nreaching 7.6% in the second half of FY2017. The rebound \nwas lifted by robust performances in automobiles and auto \ncomponents, electronic products, and pharmaceuticals, though \ntextiles, apparel, rubber, and plastics continued to contract. \n\nThis chapter was written by Abhijit Sen Gupta of the India\u00a0Resident\u00a0Mission, \nADB, New\u00a0Delhi.\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nNet taxes on products\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n8.2\n\n7.4\n\n6.4\n\n7.1\n\n6.6\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSource: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in \n(accessed\u00a09\u00a0March 2018). \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f218(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nGrowth\u00a0in\u00a0construction more than tripled from 1.3% in FY2016 \nto 4.3% in FY2017, aided by impetus given to affordable housing \nand robust public spending on infrastructure in the \ufb01rst half \nof the year. Mining slowed, notably as production of coal and \ncrude oil weakened. \n\nServices grew by 8.3%, mainly on improved growth \nin \ufb01nance, real estate, trade, hotels, transportation, and \ncommunication services. Financial services were buoyed by a \nhealthy revival in credit growth in the second half of FY2017 \nthat re\ufb02ected an uptick in economic activity but also a base \neffect from a sharp fall in credit growth in the aftermath of \ndemonetization. Strong growth in transportation services \ncame from expansion in air passengers and cargo and in \nrailway freight, as well as robust growth in sales of commercial \nvehicles. Government services including public administration, \ndefense, and \u201cother services\u201d registered robust growth. \n\nPrivate consumption growth slowed to 6.1% in FY2017, the \n\nlowest in 5 years (Figure 3.17.2). Rural consumption dipped \nbecause of weak prices for agricultural produce for much of \nthe year, a slowdown in rural wage growth, and the lingering \neffects of demonetization. Government consumption grew \nby 10.9%, by contrast, on higher pensions. Gross \ufb01xed capital \nformation expanded by 7.6% after only sluggish growth in \nthe \ufb01rst half, picking up in the second half aided by strong \nproduction of capital goods. Valuables, comprising gold and \nprecious stones, rose sharply as falling interest rates made \nsaving in \ufb01nancial assets less attractive. After growing at a \nrobust rate in the initial months of FY2017, the pace of central \ngovernment capital expenditure moderated under \ufb01scal \npressure. Private investment remained lackadaisical as it \ncontinued to be afflicted by stress on corporate balance sheets \nand by low capacity utilization at about 72%. Weak credit \ngrowth to industry and infrastructure also curbed investment.\nAlthough in\ufb02ation averaged less than 4.0% in FY2017, \nit\u00a0picked up steadily from the second quarter (Figure 3.17.3). \nFood\u00a0in\ufb02ation reversed a de\ufb02ationary trend in the \ufb01rst \nquarter and neared 5.0% at the end of FY2017 on price \nspikes for sugar and vegetables. Prices for pulses contracted, \nby contrast, following a bumper harvest. With oil prices \nincreasing by over 20% in FY2017, the government reduced \nexcise duty to moderate some of the pass-through to domestic \nprices. Nevertheless, fuel in\ufb02ation more than doubled from \nthe previous year to 6.2% in FY2017, with sharp increases \nfor cooking gas and kerosene. Core in\ufb02ation started inching \nup steadily from August 2017, driven by a rise in housing \nallowances of government employees and higher taxes on \nservices under the GST. \n\nSubdued in\ufb02ation in the \ufb01rst quarter of FY2017 allowed the \nReserve Bank of India, the central bank, to reduce policy rates \nby 25 basis points in FY2017, for a cumulative decline of 200 \nbasis points since January 2015 (Figure 3.17.4).\n\n3.17.2\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\nNet exports\nOthers\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSources: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in and CEIC \nData\u00a0Company (accessed 9 March 2018 ).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nNonfood\nCore\nHeadline\n\n% year on year\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nAug\n\nJan\n 2018\n\nSources: CEIC data company (accessed 14 March 2018); \nADB staff estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.4\u2002Policy interest rates\n\nReverse repo rate\nRepo rate\nMarginal standing facility rate\nInterbank call money rate\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n%\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSources: Bloomberg and CEIC Data Company (accessed \n15 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002219\n\nThe steady declining trend in credit growth over the past 6 \nyears bottomed out in FY2017 with 7.0% growth (Figure\u00a03.17.5). \nA sign of recovery was credit growing by 9.0% in the second \nhalf of FY2017, up from 6.0% in the \ufb01rst half on a pickup \nin credit to services, notably wholesale and retail trade, \ntransportation, and professional services. Credit to industry \nremained subdued, however, with credit to medium- and \nlarge-scale industries continuing to contract. Retail loans, \nincluding housing and personal loans, have remained strong, \nsignaling robust consumer demand. Deposit growth moderated \nconsiderably, partly because of declining interest rates but also \nre\ufb02ecting a base effect following a surge in deposits in the \nwake of demonetization in 2016. \n\nBanks continued to hold a lot of stressed assets as their \n\nnonperforming loans proliferated to 10.2% of the total in \nSeptember 2017 from 9.6% in March 2017 (Figure 3.17.6). \nOver\u00a0the same period, restructured stressed advances fell \nfrom 2.5% to 2.0%, taking all stressed assets up marginally \nfrom 12.1% to 12.2%. Although, public banks continue to hold \nthe bulk of nonperforming loans, private banks acquired \nthem at a faster pace in the \ufb01rst half of FY2017. The health of \nthe banking sector could improve with recent efforts toward \nresolving major insolvency cases expeditiously and the \nimplementation of a bank recapitalization plan, though further \nreform to strengthen bank governance is needed. \n\nFiscal consolidation slowed with the central government \nrevising up its \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit for FY2017 from a target equal to \n3.2% of GDP to 3.5%, unchanged from the FY2016 outcome \n(Figure 3.17.7). Nevertheless, the government reiterated its \ncommitment to \ufb01scal consolidation by targeting a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nequal to 3.3% of GDP in FY2018, 3.1% in FY2019, and 3.0% in \nFY2020.\n\nThe \ufb01scal overrun partly re\ufb02ected a shortfall in nontax \nrevenue as pro\ufb01ts and dividends from public sector enterprises \nincluding the central bank weakened, as well as lower telecom \nlicense fees and spectrum usage charges. Direct tax revenues \nwere buoyant as personal income tax collection bene\ufb01ting \nfrom improved compliance, and as corporate tax revenue \nexceeded\u00a0targets. \n\nThe indirect tax system was completely overhauled when \n\nthe government introduced the GST (a value-added tax) in \nJuly\u00a02017. GST revenue has been robust, though with some \ndecline in November and December 2017 as the government \nreduced tax rates for many commodities. Improved economic \nactivity and better compliance restored GST revenue to \npre-November levels starting in January 2018. Revenue from \nexcise taxes on goods that remain outside the GST moderated \na bit as the government reduced rates to contain the pass-\nthrough of global prices to retail prices. The target for revenue \nfrom disinvestment in state-owned enterprises for FY2017 was \nexceeded for the \ufb01rst time in many years.\n\n3.17.5\u2002Bank credit\n\nIndustry\nPersonal loans\nServices\nHousing\nNonfood\n\n% year on year\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\nTax\nNontax\nOther\nCurrent\nCapital\nDe\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSources: Bloomberg and CEIC Data Company (accessed \n15 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.6\u2002 Nonperforming and \n\nrestructured\u00a0loans\n\nRestructured assets\nNonperforming loans\n\nMar\n2015\n\nMar\n2016\n\nJun\n2016\n\nSep\n2016\n\nMar\n2017\n\nSep\n2017\n\nSource: Reserve Bank of India. http://www.rbi.org.in.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.7\u2002Federal budget indicators\n\nR E D R E D R E D R E D R E D\n2014\u20132015\n2018\u20132019\n2016\u20132017\nactual\nbudget\nactual\n\n2015\u20132016\nactual\n\n2017\u20132018\nrevised\n\nR = revenue, E = expenditure, D = de\ufb01cit \ufb01nancing.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance Union Budget 2016\u20132018. \nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f220(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nThe quality of expenditure deteriorated in FY2017 \nas capital expenditure contracted by 3.9% and current \nexpenditure increased by 15.0%, the upsurge being payments \nhigher than expected to states for revenue losses from the \nrollout of the GST, as well as larger pension payouts and \ninterest payments.

Gold imports surged \nby 42.4% on robust local demand and a transitory bump in \nthe \ufb01rst half, when taxes on gold were adjusted downward \nto align with the GST, which made imports from certain \ncountries attractive, depending on the terms of bilateral trade \nagreements with India. Imports other than oil or gold also \nincreased at a robust pace, driven by a strong currency and the \npickup in economic activity in the second half.\n\nExport growth was more muted during the year at 11.0%. \nExports of re\ufb01ned petroleum grew by nearly 20% after 3 years \nof contraction. Healthy growth in exports of automobiles, \nauto parts, chemicals, and iron and steel propelled growth \nin exports overall, despite contraction in exports of apparel \nand precious stones. The surplus in services grew by 15.6%, \nmainly on improved travel services, even as software service \nexports stagnated. Remittances expanded, helped by improved \ngrowth in the advanced economies and higher oil prices, \nwhich boosted growth prospects in oil-producing countries. \nA\u00a0continued rise in net out\ufb02ows of investment income dragged \non invisibles. On balance, the FY2017 current account de\ufb01cit is \nestimated to equal 2.0% of GDP.\n\nNet foreign direct investment (FDI) in\ufb02ows, which \n\ncrossed the $35 billion mark in the previous 2 years, are \nestimated to have dipped to $30 billion, equal to 1.2% of \nGDP in FY2017. While the service sector remained the major \nrecipient of FDI in FY2017, FDI \ufb02ows into manufacturing \nand construction have increased. By contrast, net portfolio \nin\ufb02ows tripled to $23\u00a0billion over the previous year, mainly \non debt \ufb02ows (Figure\u00a03.17.9). The stock market was driven \nlargely by local investor sentiment, rising by 14% in FY2017 \nbut\u00a0underperforming the 21% gain in emerging markets \nacross\u00a0Asia (Figure 3.17.10). Strong capital \ufb02ows kept the \nIndian\u00a0rupee stable in FY2017, trading in a narrow range \naround \u20b964.70 to the dollar (Figure 3.17.11). India\u2019s reserve \nholdings increased by $50 billion in FY2017 to exceed \n$420\u00a0billion (Figure\u00a03.17.12).\n\n3.17.8\u2002Trade indicators\n\nOil exports\nOther exports\nOil imports\nOther imports\nGold imports\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\nApr Aug Dec Apr Aug Dec Apr Aug Dec\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 1 April 2018); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.9\u2002Portfolio capital flows\n\nEquity\nDebt\n\n$ billion\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Security and Exchange Board of India.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.10\u2002Stock price indexes \n\nSensex\nMSCI AC AP excluding Japan\nEmerging markets excluding Asia\n\nIndex, Jan 2017 = 100\n\nJan\n2017\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan Mar\n2018\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 15 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002221\n\nInvestment growth has been sluggish over the past 7 years \n\n3.17.11\u2002Exchange rates \n\nReal effective\n\nNominal \n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nEconomic prospects\nConsumption is expected to remain an important growth \ndriver in FY2018. Farmers should enjoy more purchasing power \nwith an announced budget policy to spur rural incomes with \nhigher food-procurement prices, agriculture market reform, \ncrop insurance, and investment in irrigation and logistics. \nStronger rural wages augur well for rural consumption, but \nurban consumption will be less dynamic with only moderate \ngrowth in urban wages and employment. Strong retail lending \nand a positive wealth effect from stock market gains may, \nhowever, boost some urban consumption, as may higher \nsalaries for employees of some state governments in FY2018 \nfollowing an earlier hike for central government employees. \nThe deferment of central government \ufb01scal consolidation \nwill allow government consumption to increase, providing an \nimpetus to growth. \n\nbut is showing nascent signs of recovery. The central bank\u2019s \nindustrial outlook survey showed business expectations in the \nlast quarter of 2017 reaching their highest in nearly 3 years \n(Figure 3.17.13). Moreover, there has been a steady increase \nin the portion of respondents expecting capacity utilization \nto improve in coming quarters, which can spur investment. \nMeasures to hasten the resolution of banks\u2019 nonperforming \nloans and the implementation of the plan for comprehensive \nbank recapitalization may allow banks to raise their lending \nvolumes. Finally, higher production and imports of capital \ngoods indicate an investment revival. However, any rebound \nin investment is expected to be muted in view of the high \nproportion of leveraged companies and a sharp drop in \nannouncements of new projects in the second half of 2017 \n(Figure 3.17.14). Similarly, public capital expenditure is likely to \nbe modest, with the central government targeting an increase \nthat trails the pace of nominal growth.\n\nto improve farm productivity will help agriculture grow \nat a robust rate.

Urban consumption \ngrowth will remain stable, and impetus from public investment \nmodest. Growth is expected to pick up further to 7.6% in \nFY2019 as efforts to strengthen the banking system and \ncontinued corporate deleveraging are likely to bolster private \ninvestment. Also set to catalyze growth are bene\ufb01ts from \nthe GST as it mitigates geographic fragmentation and adds \nrevenue to the exchequer, as well as further progress on \n\ufb01scal\u00a0consolidation and reform to promote FDI.\n\nIn\ufb02ation has inched up since July 2017. Its future prospects \n\nare molded by several factors. With global oil prices forecast \nto increase by 19.7% in 2018, decontrolled prices for fuels are \nexpected to go up. This will spill over into transportation \nand add some 30 basis points to in\ufb02ation. The\u00a0outlook for \nfood prices is shaped by an interplay of various factors. \nThe\u00a0proposed increase in procurement prices will add to \nin\ufb02ation, though the impact will depend on the size of the \nproposed increase. Any strengthening of rural wages may \naffect retail food prices. However, prospects for a good \nmonsoon, only modest increases in global food prices, and \ngovernment efforts to improve agriculture supply management \npromise to mitigate the rise in food in\ufb02ation. Core in\ufb02ation \ncould inch up as accelerated economic activity allows \nproducers to pass their rising input costs on to consumers. \nHousehold in\ufb02ation expectations turned higher in December \n2017 from a year earlier. In sum, in\ufb02ation is likely to average \n4.6% in FY2018, rising to 5.0% in FY2019 with further \ufb01rming \nof global commodity prices and strengthening of domestic \ndemand (Figure 3.17.16).\n\nProspects for policy stimulus remain limited. The \ndeferment of \ufb01scal consolidation, upside risks to in\ufb02ation, \nand expected hikes in US interest rates in 2018 squeeze \nmaneuvering room for policy rate cuts to stimulate growth. \nAt\u00a0the same time, the odds of a rate hike are low with the \ncentral bank indicating tolerance for slightly higher in\ufb02ation \nand recognition of the need to nurture recovery. Consequently, \nthe status quo is likely to hold in FY2018, albeit with some risk \nof monetary tightening. \n\nThe pace of central government \ufb01scal consolidation \nmoderated as the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit target for FY2018 was revised \nto 3.3% of GDP from 3.0%. Yet revenue prospects are robust \nthanks to the GST and progress on other reform, with gross tax \nrevenue expected to grow by 16.7% in FY2018. Tax buoyancy, \nor the ratio of revenue growth to nominal GDP growth, is \nexpected to increase to 1.4, well above the 5-year average of 1.2. \nImproved compliance is projected to boost personal income tax \ncollection by almost 20%.

Indirect tax collection is \nexpected to rise by more than 19% in FY2018 with a substantial \nincrease in compliance under the GST. Dividends from public \nsector enterprises and revenue from auctions of telecom \nspectrum are forecast to grow at modest rates. Disinvestment \nand strategic sales are expected to raise Rs800 billion, equal to \n0.4% of GDP.\n\nExpenditure quality will be unchanged with both capital \n\nand current expenditure forecast to expand by about 10.0% \nin FY2018. Capital outlays on infrastructure are projected to \nsee signi\ufb01cant increases for roads and highways, railways, \nshipping, and telecommunications, with a major part of the \nincreases to be funded by the internal resources of public \nenterprises in these sectors. Additional funds have been \nbudgeted for some \ufb02agship irrigation and housing schemes. \nAmong current expenditures, the food subsidy is forecast to \nincrease by 20.7%, re\ufb02ecting the government\u2019s decision to hike \nprocurement prices. The government also announced a state-\nfunded health insurance program that will insure 100 million \nfamilies. Expenditure targets are hostage to any signi\ufb01cant \nincrease in oil prices, considering that fuel subsidies are \nbudgeted in line with FY2017 results. Any shortfall in revenue \nor increase in current expenditure is likely to curb capital \nexpenditure, as has happened in past years.\n\nRe\ufb01ned petroleum exports will rise with higher oil \nprices, and price recovery for other commodities will bolster \ncommodity exports. With GST-induced disruption waning, \nexports could get a lift in FY2018. Robust external demand \ndriven by growth in the advanced economies stands to \nstrengthen exports of merchandise and tradeable services, \nthough any new measures to restrict trade could dampen \ngrowth. Export growth overall is expected at 8.0% in FY2018, \ndown from FY2017. Higher commodity prices and rising \ndomestic demand will likely propel imports of petroleum \nand other products, and higher imports of capital goods are \nexpected as investment revives. A relatively strong currency \nwill make imports attractive. \n\nGrowth in imports is expected to accelerate to 11.0% in \nFY2018, again lower than in FY2017. Remittances will rise with \nimproved growth prospects in the advanced economies and, \nwith the rise in oil prices, in oil exporters, where a signi\ufb01cant \nnumber of Indian workers are employed. On balance, the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit is expected to equal about 2.2% of GDP. \nIt will be comfortably \ufb01nanced by stable capital in\ufb02ows, as \nIndia remains an attractive destination for FDI because of its \nhealthy growth prospects, improved ease of doing business, \nand liberalizing investment regime, with more than 90% of \nFDI coming through automatic approval routes. A buoyant \nequities market and a stable currency are expected to bolster \nportfolio \ufb02ows.\n\n\f224(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nIn FY2019, export growth is expected to average 9.0% as \n\nadvanced economies continue to grow at a healthy rate and \ndomestic competitiveness improves. At the same time, import \ngrowth is projected to slow to 10.0% as a drop in oil prices \nbalances the increase in imports arising from higher domestic \naggregate demand. The current account de\ufb01cit is forecast to \nwiden to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reviving investment  \nas a growth driver \nThe share of gross \ufb01xed capital formation in GDP declined \nsteadily from 34.3% in FY2011 to 28.5% in FY2017. This\u00a0decline \nre\ufb02ected tepid growth of investment in recent years as average \nannual growth in investment more than halved to 5.3% in \nFY2012\u2013FY2017 from 12.8% in FY2003\u2013FY2011. This\u00a0decline \nposes challenges for future growth, given the strong \nrelationship between investment growth and GDP growth in \nIndia (Figure 3.17.17). \n\nThe robust rate of investment growth in FY2003\u2013FY2011 \n\nwas driven by the healthy balance sheets of corporations, \nhouseholds, and public institutions; strong external demand \nre\ufb02ected in double-digit export growth; and robust expansion \nin bank credit. In contrast, the slowdown over the past 6 years \nre\ufb02ected worsening stress on corporate and bank balance \nsheets, excess industrial capacity, weak external demand, \ntepid household investment, and \ufb01scal limitations. Moreover, \nduring the initial years of this period, India experienced some \nmacroeconomic stress in the form of high in\ufb02ation, elevated \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cits, and high current account de\ufb01cits. \n\ninvestment in GDP has stagnated to 11% to 12% (Figure\u00a03.17.18). \nReinvigorating corporate investment which has been \nundermined by the twin balance sheet problem would require \nprogress on multiple fronts. While stress on corporate balance \nsheet remains high with interest coverage ratios remaining \nlow, corporations have been deleveraging, as re\ufb02ected in lower \ninterest expenses in recent quarters. Corporate leverage is \nexpected to ease further as \ufb01rms sell assets and their earnings \nincrease with improved demand. This could pave the way \nfor \ufb01rms to undertake fresh investments. Reviving corporate \ninvestment would hinge as well on reigniting the lending \ncycle, which has slowed in response to the rising prevalence of \nstressed assets in the banking system. The implementation of \nthe bankruptcy act and a large recapitalization plan could speed \nthe resolution of stressed assets and bolster credit growth, but \nmore needs to be done to strengthen banks.\n\n3.17.17\u2002 Investment and gross domestic \n\nproduct growth \n\n% Gross \ufb01xed capital formation\n\nLinear trend\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\nFY2016\n\nFY2012\n\nFY2017\nFY2013FY2014\n\nFY2015\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n% gross domestic  product\n\nSources: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in and CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 9 March 2018 ).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nby\u00a0institution\n\nPrivate corporations\nPublic sector\nHouseholds\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: Ministry of Statistics and Programme \nImplementation. http://www.mospi.nic.in and CEIC Data \nCompany (accessed 9 March 2018 ).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nIn the past 6 years, the share of private corporate \n\n3.17.18\u2002 Gross fixed capital formation \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002225\n\nSince FY2012, deceleration in consumer price in\ufb02ation has \noutpaced declines in nominal interest rates, steadily pushing up \nreal interest rates and thereby discouraging investment. India\u2019s \nformal adoption of a \ufb02exible in\ufb02ation-targeting framework will \nhelp contain in\ufb02ation expectations and pave the way for lower \nin\ufb02ation and interest rates in the years ahead.\n\nMuch of the decline in investment has been a decline in \nhousehold and small enterprise investment from the equivalent \nof 15.7% of GDP in FY2011 to 9.1% in FY2016. A large part of \nthis drop can be attributed to a near halving of investment \nin dwellings and buildings in the same period, from 12.8% \nof GDP to 6.6%, re\ufb02ecting challenging conditions in real \nestate including low returns, a large unsold inventory, and \nlegal disputes between buyers and developers. Government \nmeasures to improve transparency and accountability in the \nsector by, for example, enacting the Real Estate (Regulation \nand Development) Act in 2016, promise to help speed dispute \nresolution and redress, and so protect home buyers and \nboost investment in housing. The impetus given to affordable \nhousing is expected to support the sector\u2019s revival. Further, \nby conferring infrastructure status on affordable housing, \nthe government has enabled the sector to bene\ufb01t from lower \nborrowing rates, tax concessions, and increased in\ufb02ows of \nforeign and private capital.\n\nMonitoring Indian Economy in December 2017, issues related \nto land acquisition and securing environmental and other \nclearances stalled \u20b94.3 trillion of the surveyed projects, of \nwhich about 60% were government projects (Figure\u00a03.17.19). \nThese structural bottlenecks need to be alleviated to ensure \nthat current projects are completed in a timely way. Another \nimpediment to investment is low capacity utilization. According \nto a central bank survey of order books, inventories, and \ncapacity utilization, capacity utilization fell to less than 72% in \nthe third quarter of FY2017 from 83.2% in the fourth quarter of \nFY2010, re\ufb02ecting subdued domestic demand and tepid exports. \nExcess capacity in industry must be resolved to increase \ninvestment opportunities.\n\nFinally, in recent years, public investment has been \nconstrained by efforts to rein in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit. Fiscal \nhealth can be restored by improving revenue generation \nand rationalizing expenditure. Recent efforts, including \ndemonetization and the implementation of the GST, aim to \nformalize more of the economy and improve tax compliance, \nwhich promises to bolster tax revenue and provide funds \nto buttress capital expenditure. At the same time, better \ntargeting of subsidies using digital technology would help \ncontain expenditure on subsidies and free\u00a0up resources for \ncapital expenditure. Finally, the resources of the public sector \nenterprises can be tapped to strengthen public investment.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Centre for \n\n3.17.19\u2002 Projects abandoned, shelved, \n\nor\u00a0stalled\n\nGovernment\nDomestic private\nForeign private\n\n\u20b9 trillion\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nQ1-Q3\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSource: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fMaldives\n\nStrong growth in tourism and an expansion in construction pushed growth higher in 2017. \nInflation  stayed  low  with  help  from  subsidies,  and  the  current  account  deficit  moderated \nbut  remained  high.  The  outlook  is  for  modest  growth,  low  inflation,  and  a  narrower \ncurrent  account  deficit.  To  foster  economic  inclusion  and  lower  large  income  disparities, \nthe  government  is  working  to  boost  the  development  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  on  outer  atolls.\n\nEconomic performance\nUsing revised calculations (Box 3.18.1), GDP growth accelerated \nto 6.5% in 2017 from 6.2% in 2016, driven by a rebound in \ntourism and buoyed by continued strong growth in construction \n(Figure 3.18.1). After lackluster expansion in the previous 2 years, \ngrowth in tourist arrivals nearly doubled to 8.0% in 2017, mainly \nre\ufb02ecting improved economies in the major markets. Arrivals \nfrom Europe jumped by 12.4%, accounting for nearly 70% of the \nincrease (Figure 3.18.2). Other factors were the government\u2019s \nintensive marketing campaign, four major airlines launching \n\ufb02ights from Europe and Asia, and the opening of several resorts. \n\nArrivals from Asia, the second largest market, grew by \n\nonly 2.5%, mainly because of a 5.5% decline in visitors from \nthe People\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China, which remains a major market \nproviding just over a \ufb01fth of arrivals. Bed-night occupancy \nincreased sharply by 10.8%. However, growth in tourism \nservices output was only 4.2% and in tourist goods and services \ntax collection only 5.5%, suggesting more moderate growth \nin\u00a0income.\n\ncutback in Public Sector Investment Program spending by 17%. \nThe cutback is consistent with construction increasing by an \nestimated 5%, down from 17% a year earlier.

Despite in\ufb02ation averaging near 4.0% in the \ufb01rst \nhalf, for the whole of 2017 it averaged only 2.8% (Figure 3.18.3). \n\nWith in\ufb02ation low, the Maldives Monetary Authority \nmaintained an accommodative stance and kept policy rates \nunchanged. Growth in credit to the private sector accelerated \nto 14.4% from 10.4% a year earlier, with the bulk of credit \ngoing to tourism, construction, and real estate and commerce. \nBank lending to state-owned enterprises expanded by 11.4% \nbut remained small compared with private sector credit. Rates \ncharged to private borrowers averaged about 10% per annum.\n\nFiscal reprioritization in 2017 aimed to manage the ballooning \n\nde\ufb01cit by cutting current expenditure by 6.4% and capital \nexpenditure by 22.3%, such that total spending fell by 12.2% \nin\u00a02017 following an 18.0% increase in 2016. Revenue growth \nin\u00a02017 picked up slightly to 12.0%. Preliminary official estimates \nyield a budget de\ufb01cit equal to 2.0% of GDP, well below 10.4% a \nyear earlier (Figure 3.18.4). Data on budget borrowing indicate a \nsomewhat higher de\ufb01cit, however, at 6.2% of GDP. \n\nGovernment external debt escalated to $1.1 billion in 2017 \n\nas the Maldives issued its \ufb01rst international sovereign bond \nin June and November. The $250 million bond had a 5-year \nmaturity and a coupon of 7%. Proceeds will \ufb01nance development \nprojects. Government domestic debt increased by 2.7% in 2017 to \nRf27.2\u00a0billion, or 37.9% of GDP. At the end of 2017, total public debt \nwas estimated at Rf43.8 billion or 61.1% of GDP (Figure 3.18.5).\n\nThe 2017 current account de\ufb01cit is estimated at a large 21.7% \nof GDP despite improving by 2.8 percentage points (Figure 3.18.6). \nThe trade de\ufb01cit remained very high. Improvement in the current \naccount de\ufb01cit was supported by a marked fall in the secondary \nincome de\ufb01cit from 2016. Worker remittances increased and \namounted to over 8% of GDP, re\ufb02ecting a continuing need for \nexpatriate labor, including in tourism. The welcome improvement \nin income from tourism was largely offset by larger service \npayments, which were substantial. Financial in\ufb02ows, mainly \ndirect investment and portfolio capital, were sufficient to cover the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit and boost gross international reserves to \n$586.1 million. Of this, usable reserves come to $206.4\u00a0million, or \ncover for only a little more than a month of imports (Figure\u00a03.18.7).\n\n3.18.1\u2002 GDP statistics revised \n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics \nhas revised the national accounts \nfor 2003\u20132015. The new GDP series \nuses 2014 for benchmarks and prices, \nupdated from 2003, and presents \ndata using market prices. The new \nseries features statistical, conceptual, \nand methodological revisions. \nUnder\u00a0the new procedures, average \nrebased nominal GDP from 2003 to \n2015 is higher by about 11% annually, \nwith 2014 GDP revised up by as \nmuch as 20%. Real GDP growth \nrates for the 2003 and 2014 series \nshow a similar pattern, but the 2014 \nseries is somewhat more volatile. \nAverage\u00a0annual growth in real GDP \nin 2003\u20132015 was 5.9% using the \n2003 series and 5.0% using the 2014 \nseries. As a share of GDP, tourism \nincreased moderately from 22.5% \nunder the 2003 series to 25.2% under \nthe 2014 series. There were more \nsizeable changes in industry share \nof GDP: Wholesale and retail trade \ntripled to 9.4% in the 2014 series, \nconstruction fell by just over half \nto 4.9%, and public administration \ndeclined by just less than half to \n7.7%. Some sectors saw very slight \nchange in GDP share: manufacturing \nat 1.5%, education at 3.0%, and health \nand social work at 2.7%.\n\n3.18.3\u2002Inflation\n\nConsumer price index\nFood, including \ufb01sh\nHousing, water, electricity, & gas\nTransport\n\n% year on year\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\nEconomic prospects\nSustained tourism recovery and vibrant construction will propel \ngrowth in 2018 and 2019.

Growth in tourism will \nbe supported as well by the new air routes opened from Europe \nand Asia last year, the expected completion of a new runaway \nat Velana International Airport by mid-2018, the opening of 30 \nnew resorts, the construction of several new regional airports, \nand persistent marketing initiatives of Travel Trade Maldives.\nAfter cuts in 2017, the government plans to reaccelerate \n\nPublic Sector Investment Program spending in the next 2 \nyears. This is re\ufb02ected in an increase in capital expenditure \nof nearly 25% in the approved budget for 2018. Major projects \ninclude developing 6,000 homes in Mal\u00e9 and other islands, \nbuilding regional airports and hospitals, improving water \nsupply and sewerage, and constructing roads and bridges. \nSpending is slated to increase by 12.0%, with a 6.4% \n\nincrease in current expenditure and a 23.9% increase in capital \nexpenditure. Revenue and grants are projected to increase by \n7.6% on an increase in tax revenue by nearly 12%, four-\ufb01fths of \nit from the goods and services tax and taxes on business pro\ufb01t. \nThe\u00a0government aims to hold the 2018 budget de\ufb01cit to the \nequivalent of 3.2% of GDP, with 70% of it externally \ufb01nanced. \nIt\u00a0may be difficult to limit current spending as projected, \nhowever, because increases of only 2% for wages and salaries \nand\u00a0for general expenses are small in an election year, and \nsubsidies may require more spending. To achieve projected \ncapital spending, the budget de\ufb01cit may double to 6.5% of GDP.\n Following strong growth in 2017, \ufb01sheries are poised \nfor continued rapid expansion through new value-added \nproducts. Spillover from the projected growth in tourism and \nconstruction on related sectors\u2014transport, communications, \nand wholesale and retail trade\u2014will further underpin solid \ngrowth. GDP is projected to grow by 6.7% in 2018 and 6.8% \nin\u00a02019. \n\nDespite nearly 20% higher oil prices projected for 2018 \nand a continued rise in food prices, prevailing government \nprice ceilings and budget allocations for food and electricity \nsubsidies are projected to keep average in\ufb02ation at 3.1% in 2018, \nmoderating to 3.0% in 2019 as commodity prices ease.\n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit will still weigh heavily on the current \naccount balance, given the expected expansion in construction \nand higher oil prices. Imports are projected to increase by \n11.2% in 2018 and taper to 10.8% in 2019. Favorable economic \nconditions in trading partners are expected to drive export \ngrowth to 12.0% this year and 11.8% in 2019. Projected strong \ngrowth in tourism will boost the service balance in the next \n2 years and help narrow the current account de\ufb01cit, which is \nprojected to equal 17.3% of GDP in 2018 and 17.1% in 2019. \n\nRisks to the outlook are the large external debt, low foreign \n\nexchange reserves, high dependence on shock-prone foreign \nborrowing and tourism, and escalating political tensions, \nespecially in light of the 2018 presidential elections. \n\n3.18.4\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nCapital expenditure\nRecurrent expenditure\nGrants\nDomestic revenue\nFiscal de\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n3.18.5\u2002 Public debt\n\nExternal public debt\nDomestic public debt\n\nRf billion\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nEstimate Forecast\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2018. \nMonthly\u00a0Statistics.

A law on small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) enacted in 2013 paved the way for \nestablishing business centers to provide development services \nto SMEs. These centers now operate in the country\u2019s six regions \nwith assistance from development partners. In\u00a0addition, the \nstate-owned Business Center Corporation was set up in 2017 \nto implement SME development programs, including one to \nimprove the operation and management of the business\u00a0centers. \n\nTo address the large unmet credit needs of SMEs, \nwhich in\u00a02012 were estimated at $15 million\u2013$30 million, \nthe government and its development partners have created \nseveral loan programs for them. In addition, the Maldives \nMonetary Authority created two institutions that have proven \neffective in helping small enterprises obtain \ufb01nancing: the \nCredit Guarantee Scheme which reduces risk for lenders, and \nthe Credit\u00a0Information Bureau, which helps lenders evaluate \nborrowers\u2019 creditworthiness.\n\nSigni\ufb01cant progress has been made over the years, but \nchallenges continue to beset MSMEs, particularly in accessing \n\ufb01nance. In Doing Business 2018, the World Bank ranks \nMaldives 133 in 190 economies surveyed globally, and second \nlowest among South Asian peers for ease in accessing credit \n(Figure 3.18.8). \n\nA clearer and more inclusive strategy is required for \ndeveloping MSMEs. The business center network needs \nto be strengthened, and the range of services updated to \naccommodate the varying needs of MSME customers across \nthe atolls, particularly regarding help on \ufb01nancial literacy. \nSubstantially increasing the line of credit offered by the \nBank\u00a0of Maldives to lenders would widen access to \ufb01nancing. \nAccess to credit would improve if bank branches had greater \npresence on the atolls, micro\ufb01nance lending were available \nthrough island community and village cooperatives, and \ninformation technology were leveraged to reach MSMEs in \nfar-\ufb02ung areas. The government should establish a long-term \nmaster plan for MSME development to guide policy and set \nbenchmarks for improving services to them.\n\n3.18.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n\u2002\u20026.7\n\n\u2002\u20023.1\n\n\u201317.3\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20026.8\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u201317.1\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.18.7\u2002 Gross international reserves\n\nGross international reserves\nUsable reserves\n\nTotal reserves\u2019 \n import coverage\nUsable reserves\u2019\nimport coverage\n\n$ million\n\nMonths\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2018. \nMonthly\u00a0Statistics.

The  outlook  is  for  only  moderate  growth  this \nyear  and  next,  given  delayed  project  implementation  and  limited  capacity  in  governments \nunder  a  new  federal  structure.  Weak  remittances  and  export  competitiveness  will  widen \nthe  current  account  deficit.

The rebound re\ufb02ected the normalization \nof disrupted trade from February 2016, better management \nof electricity supply, and a favorable monsoon that enabled \nbetter harvests. Paddy production, which supplies nearly 7% \nof GDP, increased to 5.2 million tons, for a gain of nearly 21%. \nConstruction revived as materials \ufb02owed more easily across the \nsouthern border, post-earthquake reconstruction gained some \nmomentum, and manufacturing output grew markedly thanks \nto improved electricity supply.

Very large \nincreases in recurrent and capital expenditures widened \nthe budget de\ufb01cit to 5.4% of GDP from 0.3% a year earlier \n(Figure\u00a03.19.3). Data from Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, \nshow about 60% of the de\ufb01cit \ufb01nanced by domestic sources. \nThough government expenditure has mounted, poor execution \nof the capital budget is re\ufb02ected in large budget shortfalls. \nLack\u00a0of project readiness has engendered implementation \ndelays. Re\ufb02ecting a surge in imports, customs duties provided \na major boost to budget revenue, which increased by 26.4% \nto equal 23.4% of GDP in FY2017. Government external debt \nequated to only 15.9% of GDP, indicating low risk of debt \ndistress. The prevalence of official concessional borrowing with \nlong maturity means that payments needed to service external \ndebt are modest.\n\nBroad money (M2) supply increased by 15.5% in FY2017, \nslowing from an increase of 19.5% in FY2016 with a smaller \nincrease in net foreign assets. Credit to the private sector \ngrew by 18.0% on revived economic activity and investment, \nbut excessive lending for real estate and the hire purchase of \nvehicles induced a liquidity crunch. Consequently, deposit and \nlending rates alike increased by about 300 basis points over the \nyear even as in\ufb02ation fell markedly (Figure 3.19.4). \n\nThe Nepalese rupee appreciated against the US dollar in \n\nFY2017 in both nominal and real effective terms. Nominal \nappreciation was by 4.4% in the \ufb01scal year to mid-July 2017, \nin line with Indian rupee appreciation. In real effective terms, \nmeanwhile, the Nepalese rupee has appreciated rapidly in \nrecent years because in\ufb02ation in Nepal has exceeded that of its \ntrade partners, weakening export competitiveness.\n\nWith large purchases of capital goods, construction \nmaterials, and telecommunication equipment and devices, \nimports surged in FY2017 while export earnings increased \nonly slightly. This widened Nepal\u2019s traditionally large trade \nde\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 34.5% of GDP. Increases in worker \nremittances and other transfers, and a recovery in tourism, \nheld the current account de\ufb01cit to $95.7 million, amounting to \nonly 0.4% of GDP but reversing a $1.3 billion surplus in FY2016 \n(Figure\u00a03.19.5). Nevertheless, continued capital and \ufb01nancial \nin\ufb02ows boosted gross foreign exchange reserves by nearly 8% \nto $10.5 billion, providing 11.4 months of cover for imports of \ngoods and services (Figure\u00a03.19.6).\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe economy will likely grow by 4.9% in FY2018, slowing from \n6.9% in FY2017 mainly with the elimination of a low base effect \nfor comparison. Paddy production is expected to be 5.1 million \ntons, a drop of 1.5% from FY2017 because \ufb02oods in August 2017 \naffected the transplant of paddy seedlings.

Services will likely grow by 5.5%, \nsupported by expansion in wholesale and retail trade, \ufb01nancial \nintermediation, and travel and tourism.\n\nGrowth in government expenditure and an uptick in \ninvestment will drive growth in FY2018. The FY2018 budget \nenvisages a de\ufb01cit equal to 10.6% of GDP, but it will likely \nmaterialize as only 6.7% as capital expenditure underperforms \nallocation. Even with troubled implementation, capital \nspending surged by 37.3% in the \ufb01rst half over the year-\nearlier period (Figure 3.19.7). Election expenditures and \ufb01scal \ntransfers to local and provincial governments have further \nbuoyed spending. \n\nGrowth in private consumption will remain subdued \nwith only a moderate rise in remittances in the wake of a \ndecline in outward migration to major destination countries \n(Figure 3.19.8). The trade de\ufb01cit will widen in FY2018, mainly \nre\ufb02ecting an uptick in investment and higher oil prices. \nInadequate infrastructure, a lacking competitive environment \nin major markets, and currency appreciation in real effective \nterms are some of the factors hindering the competitiveness \nof goods exports. The current account de\ufb01cit is projected to \nwiden to the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP, well up from 0.4% a \nyear earlier because of the slow rise in remittances.\n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation will rise to a still modest 5.5% \nin FY2018 from 4.5% in FY2017. In\ufb02ation averaged 3.5% in \nthe\u00a0\ufb01rst 6 months of FY2018, below the 5.8% result in the \nyear-earlier period. Higher government expenditure, including \ndisbursement of relief grants to earthquake and \ufb02ood victims, \nwill intensify in\ufb02ationary pressure in the second half of \nthe\u00a0year. \n\nMonetary policy aims to contain in\ufb02ation by maintaining \n\ngrowth in broad money supply at 18.0%. Net foreign assets \nwill rise at a slower pace, given the restrained growth in \nremittances and the rising trade de\ufb01cit. Increased domestic \nborrowing to fund the budget de\ufb01cit is affecting the availability \nof funds loanable to the private sector, thereby exerting upward \npressure on nominal and real interest rates. \n\nGDP growth is projected at 5.5% in FY2019, assuming \na normal monsoon, better supply of farm inputs, and the \nacceleration of ongoing megaprojects.

Stagnant farm productivity is a major \nconcern since it hinders livelihood improvement for much \nof the population (Figure 3.19.9). To boost farm productivity \nand farmers\u2019 income, the government has prioritized \nthe commercialization of agriculture with contract and \ncooperative\u00a0farming promoted through various policy \ndocuments: the Trade Policy, 2009; Fourteenth Three-Year \nPlan, FY2017\u2013FY2019; and Agriculture Development Strategy, \n2015\u20132035. Notably, a policy for agribusiness promotion was \nenacted a decade ago to promote mass-scale and high-quality \nproduction, but neither farm productivity nor exports of \npromising agricultural products increased (Figure 3.19.10). \nProspects for commercialization in agriculture have \n\nsuffered for lack of an appropriate legal framework, \ncompounded by bottlenecks strangling the supply of modern \ninputs. New legislation and better-de\ufb01ned responsibilities in \ncontract farming are essential for the successful cultivation \nof several niche crops such as tea, coffee, ginger, and large \ncardamom, which have great export potential through \ncontract\u00a0farming. \n\nUnder the contract farming modality, a sponsoring \ufb01rm \nprovides farm inputs and technical and extension services \nto farmers.

Farmers are guaranteed predetermined prices for \ntheir produce, and they need not worry about market access. \nThis approach facilitates the mass production of high-quality \nproduce able to meet the exacting requirement of agro-\nprocessing \ufb01rms. \n\nInitiatives crucial to progress would enact legislation \n\nenabling agribusiness promotion, conduct appropriate research, \nprovide adequate extension support to farmers, and formulate \nand implement a national strategy on land consolidation to \nachieve appropriate farm size. Moreover, farmer empowerment \ndepends on a revitalized cooperative movement. In this regard, \nthe roles of local and provincial governments under the new \nfederal governance structure will be decisive in implementing \neffective programs that raise productivity, export production, \nand farmers\u2019 income.\n\nA lack of credit is a constraint on expanding commercial \nfarming and agribusiness. The emphasis should therefore be \non developing credit facilities that offer appropriate terms \nfor farming through formal banking channels. The ongoing \nconstruction of postal roads and the Mid-Hill Highway \nrunning from east to west across the country are expected to \nimprove market linkages and enable progress.

However,  a  fiscal  lapse  and  continued \nweak  exports  caused  large  budget  and  current  account  deficits  and  a  loss  of  foreign \nexchange  reserves.  The  outlook  is  for  wider  current  account  deficits  and  moderating \ngrowth.  Addressing  fiscal  and  external  imbalances  and  revitalizing  exports  are  challenges \nnow  and  following  elections  in  2018.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth in \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended 30 June 2017) \naccelerated to 5.3% on continued strong growth in services \nat 6.0%, led by wholesale retail and trade, and on a rebound \nin agriculture (Figure\u00a03.20.1). The strong performance was \nunderpinned by expansion in manufacturing, construction on \nmajor infrastructure investments, and higher consumer spending. \nExpenditure on private consumption, providing about 80% \n\nof GDP, grew by 8.6% and remained the largest contributor \nto growth in FY2017 (Figure 3.20.2). Faster growth in \ufb01xed \ninvestment, at 8.3%, re\ufb02ected larger public investment, while \nprivate investment grew by only 4.1%, restrained by substantial \ninfrastructure de\ufb01cits, especially for electric power supply. \nThe\u00a0de\ufb01cits are being addressed, especially by investment in \nenergy, including under the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor \n(CPEC) project. A number of projects, especially in power \nsupply, are already completed or nearly so, with \ufb01nancing from \ngovernment development expenditure, multilateral development \nbanks, and CPEC resources. The large increase in the volume \nof imports in the face of stagnant exports pushed net exports \nsubstantially lower during the year. \n\nTo support growth now enabled by improved energy supply, \n\nthe State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, maintained its \npolicy rate at 5.75% in FY2017, which facilitated a 13.7% increase \nin money supply. Credit to the private sector grew by 16.8%, the \nlargest such expansion in recent years. The average interest rate \non new lending to the private sector was, at 7.25%, little changed \nfrom a year earlier. \n\nAverage in\ufb02ation in FY2017 reached 4.2%, higher by 1.3 \n\npercentage points than in the previous year, when global \nprices were highly favorable to Pakistan, especially for oil \n(Figure\u00a03.20.3).

This larger \nde\ufb01cit came as revenue collection slowed and development \nexpenditure rose. Tax revenue grew by only 8.4%, down from \nthe 21.3% gain in the preceding year. Only higher nontax revenue \nallowed the ratio of total revenue to GDP to increase, and only \nmarginally to 12.5%. The weaker tax performance re\ufb02ected \nvarious tax incentives for agriculture and exporters and new \nrevenue measures that were less than effective. A sharp increase \nin total expenditure by 17.3% was underpinned by a nearly 30% \nsurge in development expenditure, which was more pronounced \nat the provincial level than at the federal. About 70% of the \nde\ufb01cit was \ufb01nanced through domestic bank borrowing, with the \ncentral bank providing the bulk of the credit. \n\nTotal public debt equaled 67.2% of GDP in FY2017, \nessentially unchanged from a year earlier and continuing to \nbreach the Fiscal Responsibility Debt Limitation Act ceiling of \n60%. Public external debt and liabilities rose to 20.6% of GDP, \nwhile the ratio of domestic debt to GDP declined marginally to \n46.6%. The cost of external debt servicing rose again to 2.0% of \nGDP after having declined to 1.6% in the preceding 3 years. \n\nA surge of imports was the main reason the current account \nde\ufb01cit widened signi\ufb01cantly in FY2017 to $12.4 billion, equal to \n4.1% of GDP and well up from 1.7% a year earlier (Figure\u00a03.20.5). \nThe trade de\ufb01cit reached $26.6 billion as imports increased \nby 17.6% on large increases for oil at much higher prices, \nlique\ufb01ed natural gas, investment goods, and food. Exports were \nessentially unchanged, but this was a marked improvement \nover the 8.8% decline recorded in FY2016. An\u00a0increase in the \ncombined service and primary income de\ufb01cit re\ufb02ected in part \nlower receipts from the US Coalition Support Fund. Workers\u2019 \nremittances, the major offset to persistently large trade de\ufb01cit, \nfell by 2.8% to $19.4 billion after signi\ufb01cant annual increases for \nover a decade (Figure 3.20.6). \n\nFinancial in\ufb02ows increased to $10.4 billion, mainly on \ngovernment borrowing.

GDP growth is expected to adjust \ndownward in FY2019 to 5.1% as balance-of-payment constraints \nseem to outweigh improvements to supply-side factors such\u00a0as \nbetter security and energy supply. While the budget de\ufb01cit \nmay moderate slightly in FY2018 from a year earlier, spillover \nfrom higher investment expenditure is expected to widen the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit. Securing adequate \ufb01nancing to contain \nthe drawdown in foreign exchange reserves is a concern. \n\nGrowth in FY2018 is being led by large-scale manufacturing, \n\nwhich expanded by 6.3% in the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2018 from \n3.6% in the same period last year. This improvement was \nlargely from solid expansion in cement, iron, and steel products \nthat re\ufb02ects higher demand from construction on public \ninfrastructure projects. Higher domestic demand was indicated \nby sharp expansion in consumer goods such as automobiles \nand electronics. Recovery in engineering, petroleum products, \nand rubber also contributed to growth, which is expected to \ncontinue in light of a favorable demand outlook. \n\nProvisional estimates for major winter crops suggest strong \nagriculture in FY2018 for a second year in a row, supported by \nincreased cultivated area, fertilizer use, and credit. However, \nthe wheat crop is expected to be slightly below target with \nreduced sown area. \n\nFood in\ufb02ation was 2.2% in the \ufb01rst 8 months of FY2018, \n\nwell below that in the year-earlier period, as abundant \nagricultural supplies held headline in\ufb02ation to 3.8% even as \nnonfood in\ufb02ation rose to 5.0%. Currency depreciation and the \ntransmission of rising international oil prices to the domestic \nmarket are expected to boost in\ufb02ation in the second half of \nthe year, generating average in\ufb02ation at 4.5% for all of FY2018. \nIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate marginally to 4.8% in \nFY2019, re\ufb02ecting increases in global oil prices and Pakistan \nrupee depreciation against major currencies.\n\nThe central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points \nto 6.00% in its January 2018 monetary policy statement and \nmaintained it there (Figure 3.20.8). While credit growth slowed \nin the \ufb01rst 8 months of FY2018 from the year-earlier period, \ndemand pressures have kept imports high, and the resulting \nsteady drawdown of foreign exchange reserves indicates a need \nfor policy tightening. Other concerns were the rise in global oil \nprices and a \ufb01rming outlook for higher interest rates in the US \nand global capital markets. In a departure from past policy, the \ncentral bank has permitted greater \ufb02exibility in determining \nthe Pakistan rupee\u2013dollar exchange rate since December 2017, \nand by the end of March 2018 the rupee had depreciated by \n9.2% (Figure\u00a03.20.9).

Higher tax collection and further \nrationalization of current expenditure are expected to allow \ncapital expenditure of 6.3% of GDP while meeting the \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit target. \n\nBudget expenditure grew by 14.0% in the \ufb01rst half \nof FY2018 on increases in both current and development \nexpenditures. Tax collection rose by 16.4%, and total revenue \nincluding nontax revenue by nearly 20%. Higher tax revenue \nand $2.5 billion in proceeds from a $1.0\u00a0billion sukuk bond and \na $1.5 billion eurobond issued in November 2017 contained \ngovernment domestic borrowing for budgetary support. If\u00a0this \nmomentum continues in the second half of the year, the budget \nde\ufb01cit may be held below 5.8% of GDP. \n\nThe current account remained under pressure in the \n\ufb01rst\u00a08 months of FY2018 as the de\ufb01cit rose to $10.8 billion, \nor 4.8% of estimated GDP for the period, from $7.2 billion \nin the year-earlier period. The de\ufb01cit expanded on larger \nimports that widened the trade de\ufb01cit despite a strong revival \nin exports. Remittances, the traditional offset to the trade \nde\ufb01cit, grew by\u00a03.4% in the period, reversing a decline a year \nearlier, but had only a limited impact on the current account. \nNet\u00a0\ufb01nancial\u00a0in\ufb02ows increased by about 14% from the year-\nearlier period. Filling the \ufb01nancing gap required a drawdown \nof $3.9 billion in foreign exchange reserves to $12.2 billion \n(Figure 3.20.10). \n\nExports revived to grow by 12.2% in the \ufb01rst 8 months of \n\nFY2018. Large increases in food exports (mainly sugar and \nrice), readymade garments and knitwear, leather manufactures, \nand chemical and pharmaceutical products accounted for the \nbulk of the rebound. \n\nDespite new regulatory duties, imports grew by 17.3% \nin the \ufb01rst 8 months of FY2018, slightly faster than in the \ncomparable period of FY2017 to meet sustained domestic \ndemand and the continued large import needs of infrastructure \nprojects re\ufb02ected in double-digit growth in machinery, metals, \nand vehicles. Imports of petroleum products were especially \nlarge\u00a0because of higher prices, accounting for a third of the rise \nin imports. \n\nIn the remainder of FY2018, the current account de\ufb01cit \nshould be reined in by the lagged effects of adjustments to \nregulatory duties, currency depreciation and credit tightening \nin January, and the favorable external environment for exports. \nHowever, with increased seasonal spending on infrastructure \nprojects, the current account de\ufb01cit will likely edge up a bit to \nequal 4.9% of GDP. The amount of foreign \ufb01nancing available \nin the \ufb01nal months of FY2018 will determine any further \npressure on foreign exchange reserves.

Successfully \ufb01nancing these \nlarge investments will require the government to pursue real \nstructural reform.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014revitalizing exports\nDeclining exports pose a major challenge to the sustainability \nof external accounts. Exports grew on average by 10.7% per \nannum from FY2004 to FY2011, peaking at $25.4 billion at the \nend of the period. Exports then fell by an average of 2.6% per \nannum to $21.9 billion in FY2017 (Figure 3.20.11). Over the past \ndecade, exports as a share of GDP have contracted signi\ufb01cantly, \nfrom 11.2% in 2007 to 7.2% in 2017, far below the 28% average \nin developing Asia. Clearly, the circumstances that caused \nexports to deteriorate have undermined economic growth, \nbeyond directly worsening the country\u2019s external position. \nVarious structural weaknesses undermine Pakistan\u2019s \ntrade performance. In particular, weak logistics and trade \nfacilitation, including customs procedures, add to transaction \ncosts. In Doing Business 2018, the World Bank ranked Pakistan \n171 out of 189 economies in ease of trading across borders. \nFurther, business in general suffers under a tax structure with \nmultiple taxes and high rates. The time required to prepare \nand pay taxes disadvantages business in Pakistan more than \nin peer\u00a0developing economies. A simple average of most \nfavored nation applied tariff rates stood at a high 12.1% in 2016. \nIn\u00a0addition, the overvalued domestic currency is thought to \nhold down exports. The Pakistan rupee has appreciated by 20% \nin real effective terms since FY2011, as exports fell by 17%. \nEvidence suggests that supply-side factors\u2014including \nworkforce skills, the business environment, and infrastructure \nfactors, especially power supply and logistics\u2014signi\ufb01cantly \nlimit export performance. To address these issues, the \ngovernment is preparing a medium-term framework on trade \npolicy that will be implemented over the next 5 years. It aims \nto revitalize exports by promoting investment and resolving \ntrade facilitation, e-commerce, and tariff issues. These reforms \nare steps in the right direction and align with large CPEC \ninvestments now improving infrastructure and connectivity. \nBoth efforts are essential to facilitate Pakistan\u2019s integration \ninto global value chains and production networks. \n\nIn addition, the government should consider other \n\nreforms: greater exchange rate \ufb02exibility, enforcing industrial \ncompliance with quality control and other standards, \noperationalizing a national single window for trade, \nskills development that aligns with industry demand, and \ninstituting\u00a0legal and institutional frameworks to support \nnew industries such as information and communication \ntechnology\u00a0services.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nGrowth  in  2017  slowed  to  a  new  low  since  2001  as  agriculture  contracted  and  industry \nand  services  slackened.  Inflation  surged  briefly,  and  the  current  account  deficit  widened. \nThe  outlook  is  for  gradually  improving  growth  as  structural  reform  addresses  major  fiscal \nand  external  imbalances.  Dealing  with  the  weak  performance  of  state-owned  enterprises \nis a major component of the revenue-based fiscal consolidation needed to achieve durable \nand  inclusive  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth slowed dramatically to 3.1% in 2017 as bad \nweather shrank output from agriculture for a second year \n(Figure\u00a03.21.1). Weaker growth in industry and services \ncontributed to the slowdown. The ratio of revenue to GDP \ncontinued to improve as \ufb01scal consolidation aligned with \nthe government\u2019s economic program, supported by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), to reduce \ufb01scal and \nexternal vulnerabilities. Monetary tightening brought growth \nin credit to the private sector to a more sustainable rate of \n14.7%, following 21.9% expansion in 2016. \n\nOn the supply side, rice production declined by 4.0% \nin 2017, while the production of oil-yielding fruit dropped \nby 19.5% and of vegetables by 16.5%. Tea production \ufb01nally \nrebounded after a 3-year decline but remained below potential. \nIn sum, agriculture contracted by 0.8% but improved on a \nmuch larger 3.8% drop in 2016. Industry, which provides about \n30% of value added, grew by 3.9%, well below expansion at \n5.8% a year earlier. Textiles, apparel, and leather, which make \nup half of exports, grew by 5.7%, having strengthened in the \nsecond half of the year following the restoration of privileges \nunder the European Union\u2019s Generalised Scheme of Preferences \nPlus (GSP+). However, growth in construction plunged to 3.1%, \nfollowing 8.3% expansion a year earlier, as\u00a0growth in \ufb01xed \ninvestment slowed.\n\nServices, which provide just over 60% of value added, \nexpanded by 3.1%, well below their 4.7% performance in 2016. \nGrowth came from accommodation, \ufb01nance, real estate, health \ncare, and other personal services. These gains were partly \noffset, however, by contraction in public administration and \nmere 0.9% expansion in the important transportation sector, \ndown from 5.5% growth in 2016.\n\nThis chapter was written by Utsav Kumar, Nimali Hasitha Wickremasinghe, \nand Savindi Jayakody of the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n3.21.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture, forestry, & \ufb01shing\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.4\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n3.1\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri\u00a0Lanka. \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/ (accessed 20 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.2\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nConsumption\nFixed investments\nChange in stocks\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://statistics.gov.lk.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002241\n\nOn the demand side, preliminary data for 2017 indicate \nthat private consumption grew by 1.3%. However, government \nconsumption contracted markedly under \ufb01scal consolidation, \nlimiting the contribution of total consumption to growth \n(Figure 3.21.2). The slowdown in \ufb01xed investment also limited \nits contribution to growth. Net exports dragged growth lower \nthan a year earlier on a larger volume of imports. Increased \ninventories again buoyed growth but much of this is probably \nstatistical discrepancies in the estimates. \n\nIn\ufb02ation was 7.3% year on year to December 2017, \naveraging 7.7% for the year. An increase in the value-added \ntax (VAT) rate from 11% to 15% in November 2016 contributed \nto in\ufb02ationary\u00a0pressures, but the main driver was high food \nin\ufb02ation pushed up by weather-induced supply shortages to \naverage 11.3% from to 3.1% in 2016 (Figure 3.21.3). Nonfood \nin\ufb02ation moderated substantially during the year on weaker \ndemand to average 4.9%, as did core in\ufb02ation. Then overall \nin\ufb02ation and its components converged at just over 3% in \nFebruary 2018 from a year earlier. This marked fall re\ufb02ected \nboth improved supply, indicated by price de\ufb02ation month on \nmonth, and a large base effect. \n\nThe revenue ratio is estimated to have improved to 15.3% \n\nof GDP in 2017 as tax collection bene\ufb01ted from an increase \nin the value-added tax rate from 11% to 15% (Figure 3.21.4). \nHigher\u00a0interest costs drove current expenditure marginally \nhigher to equal 15.8% of GDP. With continued government \nattempts to rationalize expenditure, current expenditure \nexcepting interest is estimated to have been contained at \n10.2% of GDP. Public investment is estimated to have fallen \nmarginally to 4.9% of GDP from 5.0% in 2016. Expenditure \ntargets were not achieved because \ufb02oods and landslides \nnecessitated unanticipated expenses to assist farmers and other \naffected families and to reconstruct damaged infrastructure. \nDespite this, the primary balance recorded a surplus over the \n\ufb01rst 10 months of 2017, for the \ufb01rst time in 63 years. The \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit in 2017 is estimated to have narrowed to the equivalent \nof 5.2% of GDP from 5.4% in 2016. Early estimates indicate a \nsmall increase in the ratio of government debt to GDP in 2017 \nfrom 78.8% in 2016 (Figure\u00a03.21.5).\n\nMonetary tightening begun in 2016 continued in early\u00a02017. \n\nThe Central Bank of Sri Lanka raised policy rates by 25 basis \npoints in March 2017\u2014to 7.25% for the standing deposit facility \nand 8.75% for the standing lending facility\u2014to calm rising \nin\ufb02ation that stemmed from the increase in VAT rate and higher \nfood prices (Figure 3.21.6). As a result, growth in credit to the \nprivate sector decelerated from 21.9% in December\u00a02016 to \n14.7% in 2017 as monetary tightening took hold (Figure\u00a03.21.7). \nThen, given marked improvement in in\ufb02ation in the early \nmonths of 2018 and lackluster growth in the economy, the \nMonetary Board on 3 April decided to reduce the standing \nlending facility rate by 25 basis points to 8.50%. \n\n3.21.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nNonfood\nHeadline\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://statistics.gov.lk.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.4\u2002 Government finance\n\nRevenue including grants\nRecurrent expenditure \nPublic investment\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n24\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\nBudget\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance; Budget speech 2018.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.5\u2002 Government debt\n\nDomestic\nForeign\nTotal\n\n% of GDP\n\n70.8\n\n71.3\n\n77.7\n\n78.8\n\n77.3\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: 2017 is to the end of September.\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Higher prices and volume expanded tea exports \nby 20.5% in 2017, accounting for a quarter of the increase. \nGarments, Sri Lanka\u2019s major export, saw exports drop in \nthe \ufb01rst half of the year but pick up to grow by 3.0% as the \nrestoration of GSP+ took effect. Imports expanded by 9.4% \nmainly on higher oil import volumes for thermal electric power \ngeneration necessitated by drought and on higher international \nprices. Rice imports expanded to meet a shortfall in domestic \nproduction. Fuel imports accounted for 54% of import growth, \nand rice imports 16%. \n\nAs political uncertainty worsened in the Middle East and \nthe region sought to replace migrants with domestic workers, \nespecially in the skilled labor category, outward migration \nfrom Sri Lanka continued to decline. Remittances were, at \n$7.1\u00a0billion, 1.1% lower than 2016. Tourist arrivals increased \nby 3.2% to reach 2.1 million, and earnings reached $3.6 billion \n(Figure 3.21.8). With a higher trade de\ufb01cit and reduced \ninvisible earnings, the current account de\ufb01cit widened to the \nequivalent of 3.0% of GDP from 2.4% in 2016.\n\nSri Lanka issued two international bonds in 2017, one raising \n\n$1.5 billion and the other $515 million. In\ufb02ows strengthened \nby $293 million on receipts from China Merchants Group in \nDecember 2017, the \ufb01rst payment on the long-term lease of \nHambantota Port, and by the release of the fourth tranche of \nthe ongoing IMF program. Gross official reserves increased \nby $2.0 billion to $8.0 billion at the end of December 2017, \nsufficient to cover 4.6 months of imports (Figure 3.21.9). \nThe\u00a0Sri\u00a0Lanka rupee depreciated by 2.0% in 2017 to end the \nyear at SLRs152.8 to the dollar, but appreciated by 3.4% in \nreal\u00a0effective terms (Figure 3.21.10). \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth over the next 2 years will depend on agriculture and \nthe political climate as elections approach. Assuming normal \nweather in 2018 and 2019, agriculture is expected to rebound \nto 6.0% growth in 2018 and recover fully in 2019, expanding \nby\u00a05.6%. \n\nIndustry will bene\ufb01t from recovery in agriculture \nas demand expands and agro-industry recovers in 2018. \nApparel\u00a0will bene\ufb01t from continued strong global growth and \nGSP+.

On the other hand, \ngovernment remedial action on several fronts and a reform-\noriented budget should improve the business climate and \nattract new investment. On balance, growth is forecast to \nrebound to 4.2% in 2018 and reach 4.8% in 2019.\n\nFood in\ufb02ation is expected to abate as agriculture recovers \n\nunder normal weather. By February 2018, food in\ufb02ation had \ndropped to 3.2% year on year from 7.3% in December 2017 as \noverall in\ufb02ation settled at a low of 3.0%, mainly re\ufb02ecting a \nhigh base effect. In\ufb02ation is projected to average 5.2% in 2018 \nand slow further to 5.0% in 2019. The introduction of automatic \npricing formulas for oil and electricity in 2018, and greater \ncurrency depreciation as foreign reserves are built up to meet \ndebt service requirements, are likely to exert in\ufb02ationary \npressures.\n\nRevenue collection is expected to continue to improve \nwith the new Inland Revenue Act that went into effect at \nthe beginning of April 2018. It seeks to increase tax revenue \nby eliminating many exemptions, reducing the tax-exempt \nthreshold for small and medium-sized enterprises, bringing \nmost corporations under the higher 28% rate, and introducing \nnew taxes, notably one on capital gains. Tax revenue is \nexpected to increase by 800 basis points to equal 14.3% of \nGDP in 2018 as total revenue including nontax revenue and \ngrants amounts to 16.3% of GDP. Expenditure is budgeted to be \nmarginally higher at 21.1% of GDP, up from 20.6% in 2017. The \nincrease covers higher interest payments and budgeted public \ninvestment. Meanwhile, current expenditure excluding interest \nis expected to be marginally lower than in 2017. The budget \ntargets a de\ufb01cit equal to 4.8% of GDP. \n\nA major challenge for the government is the bunching in \n2018\u20132024 of $22 billion in debt repayments, with $4.2 billion \ndue in 2019. The new Liability Management Act enables the \ncentral bank to borrow above the limits of the appropriation \nbill for debt repayment, a practice not previously allowed. \nIn addition, proceeds from the Hambantota Port deal are \nexpected to be set aside for debt repayment. The government \nplans to issue $2 billion in sovereign bonds and $3 billion in \nSri Lanka development bonds in 2018. In March 2018, the \ncentral bank called for proposals to raise a foreign currency \nterm \ufb01nancing facility of up to $1\u00a0billion to fund budgetary \nexpenditure. \n\nExports are projected to expand moderately by 6.5% \nin\u00a02018, still driven by apparel and tea, and by 6.0% in 2019. \nThe\u00a0rupee is likely to come under pressure in 2018 from the \nneed to provide for debt repayment. It depreciated by 1.7% \nin the \ufb01rst 3 months of 2018. A hands-off approach helped to \nmaintain reserves at $7.9 billion to the end of February 2018. \n\n3.21.9\u2002Gross official reserves\n\nAmount\n\n$ billion\n10\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports \n5\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. http://www.cbsl.gov.lk.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.10\u2002Exchange rates\n\nNominal effective\nReal effective\n\nMonthly average\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nSLRs/$\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n110\n\n125\n\n140\n\n155\n\n170\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. http://www.cbsl.gov.lk.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\u20024.2\n\n\u20025.2\n\n\u20132.7\n\n\u20024.8\n\n\u20025.0\n\n\u20132.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\f244(cid:127)(cid:127)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nImports are expected to expand moderately as oil import \nvolumes drop with normal rainfall enabling hydropower \ngeneration. Import growth, mainly to supply construction \nand the apparel industry, is forecast at 5.5% in 2018 and 6.0% \nin\u00a02019. The current account de\ufb01cit is projected to equal 2.7% \nof GDP in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. \n\nThe outlook has downside risks. Weather is an obvious \nconcern. With local government elections in February 2018 \nhaving dealt the ruling coalition an unexpected setback, \npolitical uncertainty could damage investor con\ufb01dence and \nundermine the reform agenda. An unexpectedly large rise \nin global interest rates or volatility in capital markets could \nsharply limit planned borrowing and increase its cost.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming state-owned \nenterprises\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) are estimated to account for \nsome 17% of economic activity in Sri Lanka, their dominating \npresence spanning infrastructure services, banking and \ninsurance, hotels, media, salt production, plantations, and \nlivestock. \n\nWhile \ufb01nance SOEs are pro\ufb01table, the sector loses money \n\nas a whole. Publicly guaranteed debt including SOE debt is \nestimated at the equivalent of 4.2% of GDP. Additional SOE \n\ufb01nancial obligations were estimated to equal 11.9% of GDP at \nthe end of 2016. SOE demand for \ufb01nancing thus potentially \ncrowds out credit to the private sector. Continued losses \nundermine \ufb01scal consolidation and divert resources from \nproductive developmental needs. Weak SOE \ufb01nances and \ntheir lack of high-quality public service delivery constrain \nproductivity and growth.\n\nUnder the ongoing program with the IMF, statements of \n\ncorporate intent signed for the \ufb01ve largest SOEs are expected \nto enhance oversight and \ufb01nancial discipline. An outcome of \nthese statements is a requirement that fuel and electricity come \nunder an automatic pricing mechanism, which the cabinet \nis expected to approve in 2018. The government\u2019s approach \nunder its Vision 2025 economic program is to improve SOE \ngovernance structures by enhancing accountability and to \nrestructure them to make them commercially viable, in part \nthrough cost-re\ufb02ective pricing and targeted subsidies to the \npoor to ensure\u00a0equity. \n\nThe government is considering a proposal to set up a state-\nowned holding company along the lines of Singapore\u2019s Temasek \nHoldings. Critical to its success would be an appropriate \nregulatory framework, a governance structure, accountability \nmechanisms, an adequate pool of technocrats, and arm\u2019s length \ndistance from politics.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002245\n\nWorldwide, SOE reform is inevitably intertwined with \npolitics. SOE reform in Sri Lanka, \ufb01rst initiated in the 1990s, \nhas since been carried out only sporadically and in\u00a0line \nwith the economic policy of the government of the day. \nGiven\u00a0the efficiency, \ufb01scal, and distributional implications \nof an underperforming SOE sector, continued SOE reform is \nessential beyond the life of the IMF program. Meaningful \nand sustained\u00a0SOE reform depends on building a political \nconsensus and ring-fencing the reform process from change in \nthe political order. \n\nEqually important is that future reform draw upon lessons \nfrom past experience. It must avoid institutional lapses such as \nthe divesture of Lanka Marine Services, a provider of bunker \nfuel. Following a complaint \ufb01led by the Committee on Public \nEnterprises that there were irregularities in the privatization \nprocess that bene\ufb01ted a private holding company, the Supreme \nCourt in 2009 reversed the privatization and ordered that the \nenterprise be reverted to state ownership. Experience with \nthe use of management contracts for plantations has been \nsimilarly problematic, partly because short contract duration \ndisincentivizes investment to enhance productivity.\n\nThe liberalization of the telecom sector in the late 1990s \noffers several positive lessons. In 1997, the government initiated \nreforms in the sector with the sale through competitive \nbidding of its 35% stake in Sri Lanka Telecom. An employee \nshare ownership plan was instituted to counter anticipated \ntrade union resistance, with union members encouraged \nto study similar privatization processes. Privatization was \naccompanied by the setting up of the Telecommunications \nRegulatory Commission as an independent regulator to pursue \nreform to make the industry more competitive. Competition, \ncontestability, and regulation oriented toward competition \nwere crucial to successful reform in the industry.\n\nOwnership change is not a panacea for underperforming \nSOEs. What\u00a0may matter more toward improving performance \nis to institutionalize incentives while strengthening \naccountability and governance. Four\u00a0elements are likely to \nbe critical to SOE reform: efficient state provision of public \nservices that takes into account their cost, a competitive \nbusiness environment, independent regulators, and fully \ntransparent SOE \ufb01nances.\n\n\f\fSoutheaSt aSia\n\nBrunei DaruSSalam\u2002\u2022\n\nlao PeoPle\u2019S DemoCratiC rePuBliC\u2002\u2022\n\nCamBoDia\u2002\u2022\n\ninDoneSia\u2002\u2022\n\nmalaySia\u2002\u2022\n\nmyanmar\u2002\u2022\n\nPhiliPPineS\u2002\u2022\n\nSingaPore\u2002\u2022\n\nthailanD\u2002\u2022\n\nViet nam\u2002\u2022\n\n\f\fBrunei Darussalam\n\nWith  a  rise  in  global  oil  prices,  the  economy  seems  to  have  posted  marginally  positive \ngrowth  in\u00a0 2017,  for  the  first  time  in  5  years.  Growth  should  strengthen  this  year  to  1.5% \nand next year to 2.0%. Inflation will likely edge up but continue to be low, and the current \naccount will continue to post substantial though narrowing surpluses. Enhancing domestic \ncompetition  is  key  to  diversifying  the  economy. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP is estimated to have grown by 0.8% in 2017, following \n4 years of economic contraction (Figure 3.22.1). Last year\u2019s \nturnaround to marginal growth was underpinned by increased \ngovernment consumption and a recovery in \ufb01xed investment. \nGovernment expenditure on consumption, which had \ndeclined by 6.5% in 2016, rose by 10.2% in the \ufb01rst 9 months of \nlast year over the same period a year earlier. It is likely to have \nkept up that pace in the last quarter as higher international oil \nprices boosted government revenue. Data for the \ufb01rst 3 quarters \nof 2017 suggest that a recovery in investment is under way, with \n\ufb01xed investment growing by 11.0% year on year. Even as higher \noil prices boost export revenue, export volumes of goods and \nservices continued to decline, dragging on GDP growth.\n\nBy sector, contraction in agriculture persisted for a second \nyear in a row, but industry and services reversed 2016 declines \nand posted marginally positive growth (Figure\u00a03.22.2). \nGrowth\u00a0in services such as hotels and restaurants, and \ntransportation, is estimated to have been positive last year, \nreversing declines in 2016. \n\nDe\ufb02ation that began in 2014 stretched into 2017 as the \nconsumer price index slipped by 0.2%. Prices continued to ease \nlast year for many consumer goods and services. These declines \nmore than offset price increases for transportation, education, \nfood and beverages, and communication.\n\nThe US dollar value of customs-based merchandise exports, \n\nmostly crude oil and lique\ufb01ed natural gas, increased by an \nestimated 13.6% in\u00a02017, reversing a 22.5% decline in 2016 \n(Figure 3.22.3). Higher global oil and gas prices lifted export \nreceipts, offsetting the decline in the volume of exports. \nMeanwhile, the US dollar value of customs-based imports, \nbolstered by purchases of machinery and transport equipment \nand of consumer goods, rose even faster, by 19.5%. Despite the \nstiff rise in the import bill, the trade surplus widened, further \n\nThis chapter was written by Shikha Jha and Pilipinas Quising of the Economic \nResearch and Regional\u00a0Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila. \n\n%\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\n3.22.1\u2002GDP growth\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.22.2\u2002Sectoral growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2018); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f250(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nbuilding up the current account surplus from the equivalent of \n15.5% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 19.0% in 2017. \n\nGovernment revenues began to shrink in 2014, as energy \n\nprices declined, and continued to slump in \ufb01scal year 2016 \n(FY2016, ended 31\u00a0March 2017), but are estimated to have \nrisen by a \ufb01fth in FY2017 (Figure 3.22.4). At the same time, \n\ufb01scal expenditure dropped from B$6.1\u00a0billion in FY2016 to a \nbudgeted B$5.3 billion in FY2017, narrowing the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit.\n\nThe Brunei dollar maintained parity with the Singapore \n\ndollar. In May 2017, the monetary authority deregulated \nbank lending rates, allowing banks to price their loans freely. \nAdditionally, the monetary authority deregulated interest rates \nfor term deposits in banks. In\u00a0August 2017, banks loosened \nthe required debt service ratio, which weighs borrowers\u2019 \nmonthly debt obligations against monthly income, to\u00a0encourage \nconsumers to borrow to buy durable goods.\n\nEconomic prospects \nA favorable economic outlook for the major industrial \neconomies and higher global oil prices this year and next \nshould help Brunei Darussalam build on last year\u2019s turnaround \nand post GDP growth at 1.5% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019. \n\nOn the demand side, investment is expected to continue to \n\nrecover and support growth in both years. Government and \nprivate consumption should expand modestly, supported by \nrising oil and gas revenue, higher lending to households, and a \nbetter business environment. \n\nBy sector, industry is likely to accelerate from marginally \npositive growth last year to 1.9% this year and 2.5% next. Within \nindustry, gas\u00a0output could rise, though crude oil output will \nremain constrained by commitments to internationally agreed \nproduction cuts.

This is one observation that underscores \nthe need for a sound policy on domestic competition and, \nimportantly, its vigorous implementation. \n\nBrunei Darussalam has moved up in the World Bank Doing \n\nBusiness ranking of 190 economies, from 72 in 2017 to 56 in \n2018, but it is still behind Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand \nin protecting the rights of minority shareholders and contract \nenforcement. Similarly, Brunei Darussalam\u2019s ranking in the \nGlobal Competitiveness Report 2017\u20132018 of the World Economic \nForum improved\u2014to 46 out of 137 economies, from 58 out of \n138 the previous year\u2014but it ranks 51 in the extent of domestic \ncompetition, trailing Singapore in \ufb01rst place, Malaysia at 19, \nIndonesia at 39, and Thailand at 48 (Figure 3.22.6). It ranks \n104 in terms of the intensity of local competition, 102 in the \nextent of market dominance, and 89 in having an effective \nantimonopoly policy. \n\nEncouragingly, in January 2015 the government passed its \n\n\ufb01rst national competition law, the Competition Order, which \ndiscourages market manipulation and cartel practices while \nprohibiting anticompetitive agreements and mergers, as well\u00a0as \nabuse of dominant power. Complementing that initiative, \nthe Companies Act was amended to strengthen the rights \nof minority shareholders in May 2017, and the Competition \nCommission of Brunei Darussalam was established in August \n2017 to oversee the implementation of the Competition Order, \nincluding passing judgments on anticompetitive cases and \nimposing penalties on violators. The Competition and Consumer \nAffairs Department was formed to serve as the commission\u2019s \ninvestigative and administrative arm and to carry out advocacy \ncampaigns, receive complaints, and conduct market reviews.\nEnacting legislation and setting up institutions are only \n\nthe \ufb01rst steps toward bringing about stronger domestic \ncompetition. Transparent implementation of laws is a much \nmore formidable challenge but necessary to reap their bene\ufb01ts. \nA key requirement is well-trained and professionally competent \npersonnel to interpret legislation and to enforce it transparently \nand effectively. Building such human capacity should be the \nnext priority, to ensure that recent policy initiatives bring about \nmuch stiffer competition, to the bene\ufb01t of the whole country.\n\n3.22.5\u2002Inflation\n\n%\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\n\u20131.0\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.22.6\u2002 Global competitiveness index \n\nrankings, 2017\n\nDomestic competition\nOverall\n\nSingapore\n\n1\n3\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nThailand\n\n19\n23\n\n39\n36\n\n32\n\n48\n\n51\n46\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nLao PDR\n\nViet Nam\n\nCambodia\n\nPhilippines\n\n85\n\n98\n\n94\n\n111\n\n94\n\n125\n\n55\n\n56\n\nRank\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n137\n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nSource: World Economic Forum.

Growth  momentum  will  likely  be  sustained  this  year  and  next.  Inflation \nwill  edge  up,  and  the  current  account  deficit  will  widen  before  narrowing  in  2019.  Rising \nwages  require  that  other  costs  of  doing  business  be  cut  to  maintain  competitiveness  with \npeer  economies.  Great  potential  exists  in  simplifying  cumbersome  business  procedures.\n\nEconomic performance \nRobust exports, buoyant tourism, and strong foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) enabled Cambodia to sustain GDP growth at \nan estimated 7.0% in 2017, unchanged from the previous 2 years \n(Figure 3.23.1). \n\nMerchandise export growth moderated from 10.1% in 2016 \n\nto an estimated 9.3% last year, despite an impressive rise in \nshipments of electrical goods, automobile components, bicycles, \nand milled rice\u2014but not garments, the largest category by far. \nService exports improved, helped by an 11.8% rise in tourist \narrivals that more than doubled the 5.0% growth rate in 2016. \nPreliminary data show FDI rising by an impressive 21.5% \nlast\u00a0year to reach $2.7 billion (Figure 3.23.2). \n\nBy sector, a mild slowdown in industry was offset by \nfaster growth in services and agriculture. Industry grew by \nan estimated 9.7% in\u00a02017, slightly down from 10.5% in 2016. \nConstruction seems to have moderated but still grew robustly, \nas indicated by 36.0% growth in imports of construction \nmaterials and a 27.0% increase in construction projects \napproved. Helped by accelerating growth in tourism, services \nexpanded by an estimated 7.1% last year, up from 6.8%. \nAgriculture grew by an estimated 1.7%. \n\nEven as high growth was sustained and international oil \nprices rose, in\ufb02ation averaged 2.9% last year, about the same \nrate as in 2016 despite prices for food, weighted at 43.3% in the \nconsumer price index, easing thanks to better harvests.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit excluding official transfers is \nestimated to have narrowed to the equivalent of 10.9% of GDP \nlast year from 11.2% in 2016 as net service exports improved \n(Figure 3.23.3). Robust official transfers and buoyant FDI in\ufb02ows \nmore than compensated for the current account de\ufb01cit, enabling \ngross foreign exchange reserves to rise from $6.7 billion at \nthe end of 2016 to $8.8 billion a year later, sufficient to cover \n6 months of imports. Reserves are greater than the country\u2019s \nexternal debt of $6.7 billion, equal to 30.1% of GDP in 2017. \n\n3.23.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nTaxes on products less subsidies & FISIM\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.4\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nFISIM = \ufb01nancial intermediation services indirectly \nmeasured.\nSources: National Institute of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.23.2\u2002Foreign direct investment\n\nAgriculture\nFinance\nConstruction\nMining & quarrying\nAccommodation\nHydropower\nManufacturing\nTelecom\nOther\n\n$ million\n\n3,000\n\n2,250\n\n1,500\n\n750\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Jan Hansen and Poullang Doung of the \nCambodia\u00a0Resident Mission, ADB, Phnom Penh.\n\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia\u2002\u2002253\n\nThe 2017 budget had planned for a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to \n\n3.23.3\u2002Current account balance\n\n4.3% of GDP, rather higher than the 2.8% outturn in 2016. \nHowever, preliminary data show actual expenditure was 19.3% \nbelow budget because of sluggish disbursement and delays in \nrecording\u00a0public capital spending \ufb01nanced by development \npartners.

Growth is \nforecast\u00a0at 7.0%, sustained by robust expansion in exports, \nstrong\u00a0FDI in\ufb02ows, solid\u00a0tourist arrivals, and buoyant domestic \ndemand (Figure 3.23.4). \n\nBy sector, industry is likely to continue to grow by around \n\n9.6%, with a slowdown in garments and footwear offset by \nstronger growth in emerging industries: electrical parts, \nautomobile components, bicycles, milled rice, and rubber. \nThat\u00a0said, the continued rapid rise since 2013 in Cambodia\u2019s \nminimum wage for garment manufacturing is a matter of \nconcern, as it may erode export competitiveness in an industry \nthat accounts for nearly 80% of the country\u2019s manufacturing \noutput. Turning to other sectors, growth in services should \nremain at 7.1%, as in 2017, with continued buoyancy in tourism. \nAgriculture should post around 1.8% growth. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to rise to 3.2% this year and 3.5% in \n2019 with continued strong GDP growth and international food \nand oil\u00a0prices trending higher (Figure 3.23.5). However, local \nfood prices, which matter the most to poor households, should \ncontinue to be subdued, barring adverse weather. \n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit is expected to remain substantial as import \n\ncosts rise for imported oil and other needs in a fast-growing \neconomy.

If the country fails \nto implement policies to bring down other costs of doing business, \nit will jeopardize its rapid growth and its ability to diversify the \neconomy over the medium to long term. Policy makers should \nconsider vastly simplifying the processes and procedures required \nto do business. This would cut costs and help keep the country\u2019s \nmanufacturing and services internationally competitive. \n\n135 out of 190 countries surveyed, far behind many of its \nneighbors and peers. Indeed, the country is near the bottom of the \nranking in three areas: starting a business, getting construction \npermits, and enforcing contracts (Figure\u00a03.23.7). Moreover, \nCambodia\u2019s ranking in these three areas has stagnated since 2011. \nPolicy\u00a0makers should expeditiously streamline procedures and \nprocesses in these areas to reduce the cost of doing business. \nThe government would be well advised to constitute a \n\nspecial\u00a0task force with representatives from government \nministries, public agencies, and the private sector. The task force \nwould review procedures and suggest ways to simplify or remove \nexcessive procedures and paperwork now required to register a \nbusiness, obtain construction permits, and enforce commercial \ncontracts. It\u00a0could consider creating a single window\u00a0to \nstreamline procedures and unify fees for opening a business, \nthereby reducing costs. \n\nCreating such a single window would build on progress \nCambodia has made since 2015 toward making it easier to start \na business. The country has simpli\ufb01ed company name checks, \nstreamlined tax registration, eliminated the requirement to \npublish information in the official gazette, and introduced \nonline\u00a0business registration.\n\nMeanwhile, the judicial system is not seen as effective \n\nin resolving commercial disputes. The interpretation \nand enforcement of commercial law could be improved \nby developing\u00a0and rolling out decrees and guidelines on \nimplementation, conducting awareness campaigns about business \nneeds, and training authorities in the central and provincial \ngovernments to improve their uptake of these materials. \nCommercial courts should be established to resolve commercial \ndisputes and enable speedier contract enforcement. \n\n\fIndonesia\n\nSupported  by  an  export  turnaround,  strengthening  investment,  and  robust  consumption, \neconomic  growth  picked  up  last  year.  Inflation  rose  slightly,  and  the  current  account \ndeficit  narrowed  marginally.  Growth  should  firm  up  on  higher  investment  and  private \nconsumption. The current account deficit will likely widen, and inflation remain within the \ncentral  bank\u2019s  target  range.  Early  experience  demonstrates  how  smart  solutions  can  help \nto  better  manage  the  country\u2019s  rapid  urbanization.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth edged up to 5.1% last year from 5.0% in 2016, driven \nby renewed acceleration in export growth, stronger investment, \nand private\u00a0consumption encouraged by a robust job market \n(Figure 3.24.1). Exports of goods and services, having contracted \nfor 2 consecutive years in 2015 and 2016, rose last year by 9.1% at \nconstant prices, providing fresh impetus to the economy. Data on \nthe balance of payments show the US dollar value of merchandise \nexports rising last year for the \ufb01rst time since 2011, recording \nhefty 16.9% growth that bene\ufb01ted from a pickup in global trade \nand higher international commodity prices. Export earnings \naccelerated for primary commodities such as coal, palm oil, \nnatural gas, and rubber and for manufactured products such\u00a0as \ntextiles, metal goods, and electrical appliances.\n\nSupported by higher public infrastructure spending and \nstronger private investment, \ufb01xed capital formation accelerated \nby 6.2% from 4.5% growth in 2016 (Figure 3.24.2). Aside from \nstrong growth in the construction of buildings, investment in \nmachinery and equipment grew by 9.5%, its highest since 2012. \n\nRobust growth in private consumption at 5.0%, as in 2016, \nre\ufb02ected solid job growth and low in\ufb02ation. Of the 2.6 million \njobs added, 1\u00a0million were created by manufacturing enterprises \nin the formal sector, mostly in Java. The average real wage \nfor regular employees in manufacturing increased by 7.9%. \nPublic consumption rebounded from contraction in 2016 with \na 2.1% rise\u00a0as government spending normalized in 2017 after \nsubstantial\u00a0cuts in the revised budget for 2016.\n\nBy sector, industry grew by 4.1%, improving slightly on \n3.8% in\u00a02016 with a better performance in construction as \ninfrastructure projects under state-owned enterprises and the \ngovernment accelerated (Figure\u00a03.24.3).

Services maintained the 2016 growth rate at 5.7% \nto provide nearly half of GDP growth. Growth in logistics and \ninformation and telecommunication technology strengthened, \nwhile rapidly rising tourist arrivals boosted trade, hotels, and \nrestaurants, despite an eruption of Mount Agung volcano in Bali.\nHeadline in\ufb02ation averaged 3.8% in 2017, slightly up from \n3.5% in 2016, with hikes for administered tariffs on electricity \nand other energy supply more than offsetting price moderation \nfor most other products (Figure 3.24.4). Food in\ufb02ation was \ntamer than in previous years with better production and supply \nmanagement. Core in\ufb02ation has been declining since 2015, largely \nre\ufb02ecting stability in the exchange rate and in\ufb02ation expectations. \nMerchandise imports rose by 16.1% in 2017, less than the \n\n16.9% rise in merchandise export earnings reported above. \nImports supported new infrastructure projects, particularly \nin electricity generation (Figure\u00a03.24.5). The net result was a \nmerchandise trade surplus of $18.9\u00a0billion, slightly higher than \nthe $15.3 billion surplus in 2016. The\u00a0current account de\ufb01cit thus \nnarrowed marginally to the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP last year \nfrom 1.8% a year earlier (Figure 3.24.6). In\u00a0the \ufb01nancial account, \nnet portfolio capital in\ufb02ows grew by 8.8%, and in\ufb02ows of FDI \nreached $23.1 billion. The overall balance of payments surplus \nedged up to $11.6 billion, taking foreign exchange reserves up\u00a0to \n$130.2\u00a0billion, or cover for 8.3 months of imports and repayment \nof official debt (Figure 3.24.7). Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah \nremained relatively stable in 2017, depreciating marginally by \n0.6% against the US\u00a0dollar. \n\nIndonesia\u2019s external debt in 2017 remained moderate at \n\n$352.2\u00a0billion, equal to 34.8% of GDP. External debt is 86.1% \nlong term, 51.3% of it public and 48.7% of it private. Total public \ndebt rose to the equivalent of 29.0% of GDP in 2017 from 28.3% \nin 2016 because of a higher \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit and slight rupiah \ndepreciation, but it remains low by international standards and \nwell below the legal threshold of 60% of GDP. Debt denominated \nin foreign currency is only one-third of total public debt, but \nforeign ownership of public debt is higher, with nonresidents \nholding 39.8% of rupiah-denominated government bonds in 2017.\n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit last year is estimated to have equaled \n\n2.5% of GDP. Performance improved on higher revenue and \nexpenditure outcomes, with revenue supported by structural \nfactors and spending quality enhanced. Thanks to efforts to \nbroaden the tax base and improve tax administration, higher tax \nrevenues\u2014excluding those paid during the 9-month tax amnesty \nthat concluded on 31 March\u00a02017\u2014raised the ratio of tax to GDP \nfrom 9.5% in 2016 to 9.8% in 2017. Capital expenditure achieved \n92.8% of the budget target, the highest in 3 years (Figure\u00a03.24.8). \nWith moderate in\ufb02ation, Bank Indonesia, the central bank, \nlowered its policy interest rate, the 7-day reverse repo, by 25 basis \npoints twice last year, in August and September.

Public investment is expected to peak in 2018, \nespecially for projects in energy and transport and those tied \nto the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang in August. \nSeveral large projects implemented by state-owned enterprises are \nscheduled for completion this year and next. Annual growth in \ntotal investment should stay well above 6% over the next 2 years. \nPositive business sentiment encouraged by structural reform may \nbe partly offset by some private investors adopting a wait-and-see \nstance as regional elections in 2018 and a national election in 2019 \napproaches. Credit growth is expected to accelerate at a moderate \npace this year and next from its subdued 8.2% increase last year \n(Figure\u00a03.24.9). Nonbank \ufb01nancing from the capital market has \nbecome increasingly important to investment growth. \n\nA gradual improvement in private consumption is expected, \nsupported by continued job growth and low in\ufb02ation. Consumer \ncon\ufb01dence remains elevated, with higher-income households set to \nconsume more services, especially in travel and communications. \nLower-income households will receive a boost from growth in \nformal employment outside of agriculture and from the continued \nexpansion of government social assistance programs. Although the \npace of retail and vehicle sales has moderated, elections this year \nand the next should boost private consumption (Figure 3.24.10). \nThe net effect of falling sales in traditional stores and rapidly \ngrowing sales online is still inconclusive. \n\nConstruction is seen to draw support from simpler \nprocedures for licensing and land acquisition, as well as the \nfast-tracking of several national strategic projects. The\u00a0latest \npurchasing managers\u2019 index shows improving vigor in \nmanufacturing. Services associated with the digital economy \nare\u00a0expected to take off. Barring bad weather, agriculture \nshould\u00a0post\u00a0stronger growth, although the peak of the harvest \nseason may be delayed from the \ufb01rst quarter to the second. \nEven as growth strengthens, assuming stable domestic \nenergy\u00a0prices, in\ufb02ation is forecast to be 3.8% this year and to \nedge up to 4.0% in 2019. Both rates are well within the central \nbank in\ufb02ation target for 2018 at 3.5% \u00b11.0 percentage point. \nPressure on food prices should ease with continued improvement \nin food distribution channels across the country and with \nimports of selected foods.

The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \ntarget is 2.2% of GDP. Measures to broaden the tax base and \nimprove compliance should, along with gains in nontax income, \ntranslate into higher revenue over the next 2 years. Revenue \nmay improve further with the tax office gaining better access \nto bank \ufb01nancial data under recent international agreements \ninstituting the automatic exchange of information. Improving the \nquality and efficiency of spending are priorities in 2018, with a \nparticular emphasis on capital and social assistance expenditure. \nIn February 2018, the Ministry of Social Affairs reported that \ndisbursement of social spending in the year to date had doubled \nover the year-earlier period. \n\nExternal risks to the outlook include capital out\ufb02ows and \nresulting pressure on the rupiah as the normalization of monetary \npolicy proceeds in the advanced economies, shifts in trade \npolicy in export markets, and escalating geopolitical tensions in \nEast\u00a0Asia. Domestic risks could emanate from revenue shortfalls \nor expenditure delays affecting the 2018 budget. The Indonesian \ncrude price is now about $60\u00a0per barrel, far higher than the \nassumption in the 2018 budget of $48 per barrel. If\u00a0domestic fuel \nprices are not adjusted in line with rising global crude oil prices, \npressure on the budget could undermine development\u00a0spending.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014scaling up smart solutions \nto\u00a0address urban challenges \nIndonesia is urbanizing rapidly. More than half of its population \nof 262\u00a0million live in urban areas, with up to two-thirds \nprojected to live in cities by 2035 (Figure 3.24.11). Partly because \nurbanization has been rapid, it has lacked sound planning or \nadequate \ufb01nancing, straining basic service delivery and the \nenvironment. Only one in three urban households has access to \ndecent water (Figure 3.24.12). Only one in hundred is connected \nto a sewerage system, which poses high risks to public health. \nFloods and landslides account for more than 60% of natural \ndisasters in Indonesia, the impact of which is exacerbated by \ninsufficient urban drainage systems and poor municipal waste \nmanagement. Less than 10% of urban commuters travel to work \nby public transport, and inadequate transport facilities contribute \nto congestion and signi\ufb01cant economic losses.\n\nThe core challenge of upgrading urban services boils down to \n\n\ufb01nding innovative ways to plan and \ufb01nance urban development. \nThe government has ambitious plans to improve urban services. \n\n%\n\n13\n\n11\n\n9\n\n7\n\n5\n\n%\n\n24\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n3.24.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\u20025.3\n\n\u20023.8\n\n\u20132.2\n\n\u20025.3\n\n\u20024.0\n\n\u20132.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.24.9\u2002 Growth of commercial banks credit\n\nJan \n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan \n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan \n2017\n\nJul Dec\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.10\u2002Retail sales growth\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 15 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nIndonesia\u2002\u2002259\n\n3.24.11\u2002 Population projections\n\nRural\nUrban\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020 2025\n\n2030\n\n2035\n\nSource: Badan Pusat Statistik. 2013.

It can provide real-time data when infrastructure \nbreaks down, for example, while collecting dynamic and \ntransparent information on welfare needs as they emerge. \n\nTo bridge the urban services gap and strengthen delivery \n\nsystems, wireless sensors and \ufb01nancial technology can be \ndeployed for better mapping of properties and payment of public \nutility bills. In Jambi\u00a0City on Sumatra, data on the location and \ncondition of septic tanks will feed into an interactive map to \nschedule desludging. An auto-debiting system is planned for \ndesludging services, billing either communities or individual \nhouseholds. These innovations have potential to reduce costs, \nstrengthen local revenue, and improve the creditworthiness of \nlocal governments.\n\nEncouraging as these few examples of good practice in using \n\nsmart solutions to manage urban challenges may be, scaling \nup such solutions to cover most major urban areas in a vast \ncountry will require massive investment. Here, too, innovative \n\ufb01nancing solutions should be actively pursued. One option would \nbe for local governments to access domestic capital markets by \nissuing municipal bonds. Similarly, utility providers could use \npooled municipal debt obligations to raise funds to \ufb01nance smart \nsolutions for urban utility provision. \n\nSuch approaches would encourage good governance and \ntransparency in local governments and urban utility providers. \nOver\u00a0time, this can attract private participation in the \ufb01nancing \nand provision of urban services. With the right policies and \ninvestments, Indonesia can thus use smart solutions to turn its \ncities into promoters of innovative and inclusive growth.\n\n\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nEconomic  growth  held  up  well  last  year  at  6.8%.  Inflation  hit  an  8-year  low,  and  the \ncurrent account deficit narrowed. Growth is likely to be sustained this year and accelerate \nin  2019.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  edge  up,  and  the  current  account  deficit  to  worsen.  Large \ncurrent  account  and  fiscal  deficits  are  immediate  concerns  for  the  policy  makers,  and  a \nmedium-term  challenge  is  to  address  a  widening  skills  gap.\n\nEconomic performance\nDespite a new government ban on logging exports, tighter \ncredit, subdued international mineral prices, and lower tourist \narrivals, GDP growth in 2017 came in at 6.8%, slightly lower \nthan the 7.0% \ufb01gure for\u00a02016 (Figure 3.25.1). \n\nBy sector, a slowdown in industry was offset by acceleration \n\nin services, while growth in agriculture was unchanged \nfrom\u00a02016. Despite a hefty 24.8% rise in electricity generation, \nindustry growth slowed from 12.0% in 2016 to 9.5% last\u00a0year \nas persistently subdued global mineral prices dragged \ndown mining and metal production. Meanwhile, growth in \nservices accelerated from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.2% last year as \ngrowth in wholesale and retail trade, and in information and \ncommunications, more than offset a slowdown in tourism \nbusiness caused by a 7.5% decline in tourist arrivals largely \ntraceable to tightened visa requirements. \n\nEven as the economy grew apace and international oil \nprices rose sharply in 2017, buoyant agricultural production \ndrove down food prices and kept a lid on in\ufb02ation. Average \nin\ufb02ation halved from 1.6% in 2016 to 0.8% last year, the lowest \nsince 2009 (Figure 3.25.2). \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed from the equivalent \n\nof 14.1% of GDP in 2016 to an estimated 13.0% last year, as \n16.1% growth in merchandise exports outpaced a 13.6% rise in \nimports and net service exports stood at $360 million. On the \ncapital account, net foreign direct investment in\ufb02ows, mostly \nfor large hydropower projects, surged from $2.1 billion in 2016 \nto $2.8 billion last year. This more than offset $1.4 billion in net \nout\ufb02ows of portfolio capital, yielding a balance of payments \nsurplus of $165 million that helped foreign exchange reserves \nimprove from $815 million in 2016 to $980 million at the end \nof\u00a02017.

Meanwhile, external public \nand publicly guaranteed debt rose to the equivalent of 49.1% of \nGDP last year from 46.6% at the end of 2016. \n\nDespite government efforts to consolidate its \ufb01nances, the \n\n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit reached 4.8% of GDP in 2017 from 4.6% a year \nearlier (Figure\u00a03.25.3). Revenue fell short of the budget target \nbut still rose from 15.8% of GDP in 2016 to 16.7%. Meanwhile, \nexpenditure rose from 20.5% to 21.7%, capital expenditure \nbeing exempted from austerity measures that constrained \ncurrent expenditure. Credit growth slowed last year to an \nestimated 15.0% from 20.9% in 2016, and the ratio of loans to \ndeposits in the banking system stabilized at 103%. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to continue at 6.8% in 2018, as the industry \nslowdown that began last year persists but is compensated by \nslightly higher growth in services, then pick up to 7.0% in\u00a02019 \n(Figure 3.25.4). As some hydropower projects now under \nconstruction come online in\u00a02019, notably the 1,300-megawatt \nXayaburi dam, industry should reverse its declining trend. \nMeanwhile, barring more bad weather, agriculture should \ncontinue to grow by about 3.0%, and growth in services is \nforecast to strengthen mildly as tourist arrivals recover from \nlast year\u2019s huge decline. \n\nAs growth momentum is maintained, in\ufb02ation is expected \nto rally from last year\u2019s dip but remain moderate at 2.0%\u20132.5% \n(Figure 3.25.5). This is despite a forecast rise in international \noil prices and possible depreciation of the Lao kip in response \nto the continued precarious state of the balance of payments \nsituation.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is projected to expand to \n\nthe equivalent of 14.9% of GDP in 2018 as higher in\ufb02ation \nand international oil prices drive up the import bill and \nmoderating\u00a0export growth brings in less revenue. As new \nhydropower projects come online, electricity exports should \npick up in 2019, pushing the current account de\ufb01cit down to \nthe equivalent of 13.7% of GDP (Figure 3.25.6). On the capital \naccount, net in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment are expected \nto equal 16% of GDP in 2018 and 15% in 2019. \n\nContinued failure to meet \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit targets in recent \nyears is a matter of concern. The government seems to remain \ncommitted to paring the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 4.3% \nof GDP this year and 4.0% in 2019. However, this would require \nlarge cuts to public expenditure and higher revenue achieved \nthrough improved tax administration and higher taxes on \nnatural resource industries. \n\nRegarding monetary policy, the government is likely \n\nto continue to let the kip depreciate gradually while \nretaining current interest rate caps over the next 2 years. \n\n3.25.3\u2002Fiscal balance\n\n% GDP\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance; Asian Development Outlook \ndatabase.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n\u2002\u20026.8\n\n \u2002\u20022.0\n\n \u201314.9\n\n2019\n\n\u2002\u20027.0\n\n\u2002\u20022.5\n\n \u201313.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.25.4\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.5\u2002Inflation\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2013 2014\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f262(cid:143)(cid:143)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\n3.25.6\u2002Current account balance\n\nBroad\u00a0money\u00a0supply is expected to grow by about 20% annually \nthis year and next, with annual credit growth at about\u00a017%.\n\nExternal risks to the outlook would include an \nunexpectedly large slowdown in trade and heightened \ninstability in \ufb01nancial markets, either globally or within the \nregion.

Among the many constraints \nthat could frustrate the achievement of this milestone, \nthe emergence of huge skills gap merits special mention. \nA\u00a0World\u00a0Bank report found in 2014 that 36% of \ufb01rms faced a \nshortage of highly skilled workers, while 44% cited a shortage \nof workers with medium skills as a bottleneck, and 47% \nreported business constrained by a shortage of even unskilled \nworkers. Part of the problem is a mismatch between the skills \nthat young people acquire in schools and those in demand in \nthe labor market. Among the 14,000 graduates from technical \neducation and vocational training institutions following the \n2016\u20132017 school year, most were accountants or electricians, \nfor which there is very limited demand (Figure\u00a03.25.7). \nMeanwhile, despite severe shortages of architects, engineers, \nelectronics specialists, masons, mechanics, and carpenters, \nenrollment in these areas continues to languish.\n\nThe worsening skills gap re\ufb02ects lower enrollment \nand completion rates in schools and colleges. Although the \nLao\u00a0People\u2019s Democratic Republic is now close to achieving \nuniversal primary education, the enrollment rate in lower \nsecondary school is only 74%, in upper secondary school a \npaltry 41%, and in tertiary education about 20%. Compounding \nlow enrollment and completion rates is the low quality of \neducation at all levels. \n\nImproving access to post-primary education would \n\nrequire greater resources to hire more teachers, as well as to \nprovide \ufb01nancial assistance to children from poorer families. \nImproving the quality of education is difficult, as greater \nresources alone cannot enhance quality. Comprehensive efforts \nto address a range of issues would be needed to improve the \nquality of education: modernizing the curriculum, training \nteachers, forging a stronger partnership between educational \ninstitutions and industry, granting more autonomy to \neducational institutions, and improving governance across the \neducation sector.\n\n3.25.7\u2002 TVET graduates by sector, \n\nschool\u00a0year 2016\u20132017\n\nServices\n36%\n\nIndustry\n50%\n\nAgriculture\n14%\n\nTVET = technical and vocational education and training.\nNote: Most graduates in services are in accounting and \nsecretarial services, hospitality and food processing, \nbusiness administration, tourism, and information and \ncommunication technology.

The  country  can  move  up  the  value  chain  and  become  a  high-tech \neconomy by implementing its strategy to strengthen workforce skills and technical capacity.\n\nEconomic performance \nA revival in exports and robust domestic demand helped \nGDP growth accelerate from 4.2% in 2016 to 5.9% last year. \nExports of goods and services rose in real terms by 9.6% after \nnear stagnation in 2016, when exports edged up by only 1.1%. \nMerchandise exports soared by 13.7% in US dollar terms, \nreversing 5.2% contraction in 2016, on sharp upturns for global \ntrade and commodity prices. Malaysia is highly open to trade, \nwith a ratio of trade to GDP at 131%\u2014fourth in Asia after \nHong\u00a0Kong, China; Singapore; and Viet Nam in that order\u2014so \nthe turnaround in merchandise exports breathed new life into \nthe economy (Figure 3.26.1). \n\nGrowth in domestic demand was well distributed across \nthe economy (Figure 3.26.2). Private consumption rose by 7.0%, \nimproving on 6.0% growth recorded in 2016 with help from \nhigher growth in wage income amid a tight labor market, and \npublic consumption rose by 5.4% from a scant 0.9% in 2016. \nStronger export demand encouraged private investment into \nseveral large projects to expand capacity in manufacturing and \nservices. At the same time, public investment turned around \n3\u00a0years of decline with a small gain that brought growth in \ntotal investment to 6.2%. \n\nAll sectors performed well, but manufacturing stood out \nfor its contribution to GDP growth. Production rose by 6.0%, \ndriven by 8.0% growth in electrical and electronic equipment \nmanufacturing, which comprises 25% of manufacturing \nand 40% of external trade. Growth in industry as a whole \naccelerated to 4.9% from 4.2% in 2016. Services, which provide \nmore than half of GDP, saw growth accelerate to 6.2% from \n5.6% in 2016 on expansion in transport, telecommunications, \nbusiness services, and e-commerce. Agriculture, which \nprovides 9.0% of GDP, posted 7.2% growth, reversing 5.1% \ncontraction in 2016 on the strength of higher commodity prices \nand favorable weather.\n\nThis chapter was written by Valerie A.

Transport \nprices climbed by 13.2% as fuel and lubricant costs spiked early \nin the year, and as adjustments to controlled prices shifted \nfrom a monthly to a weekly basis and were \ufb01nally aligned \nwith international oil prices. Despite\u00a0little\u00a0change in other \nprices, including for food, headline in\ufb02ation reached 3.8% in \n2017 from 2.1% in 2016, well above the 2.4% average over the \nprevious 10 years. Meanwhile, core in\ufb02ation, excluding the \nmore volatile categories, moderated to 1.8% from 2.8% in 2016 \n(Figure\u00a03.26.3). \n\nThe current account surplus expanded slightly, further \n\nstrengthening Malaysia\u2019s already ample external buffers. \nMerchandise imports rose by 14.0%, slightly outpacing 13.7% \nexport growth. Because\u00a0exports grew from a larger base, \nthough, the trade surplus widened from the equivalent of 8.3% \nof GDP in 2016 to 8.7%, while the current account surplus rose \nto 3.0% of GDP from 2.4% in 2016 (Figure\u00a03.26.4). The capital \naccount was broadly in balance as net inbound direct foreign \ninvestment, equal\u00a0to 0.9% of GDP, offset net out\ufb02ows in other \nareas. Gross external reserves thus rose to $102 billion at the \nend of 2017, which\u00a0is cover for 7.3 months of retained imports \nand a sum greater than the country\u2019s short-term external debt.\n\nprogram of \ufb01scal consolidation proceeded apace, the \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit for the year estimated at 2.9% of GDP, a notch below \nthe de\ufb01cit in\u00a02016 (Figure\u00a03.26.5). Government expenditure \nfell slightly last year as a percentage of GDP, with current \nexpenditure in particular down in line with government efforts \nto rationalize subsidies. Meanwhile, revenue rose a bit to reach \n17.4% of GDP. Buoyant revenue from individual income tax \nand general sales tax raised nonenergy tax revenue slightly to \nan estimated 13.1% of GDP in\u00a02017. Improvement from 11.1% \nin\u00a02010 illustrates the success of government efforts to shift \naway from dependence on revenue from oil and gas.\n\nMonetary policy continued to support growth in 2017 as \nBank\u00a0Negara Malaysia, the central bank, kept its policy interest \nrate unchanged at 3.0%. Then, in January this year, it raised \nthe policy rate by 25 basis points to preclude possibly importing \nvolatility from abroad and prevent the buildup of risk from \ninterest rates staying too low for too long.

As expenditure rationalization continues, the ratio of \nexpenditure to GDP should decline slightly from an estimated \n20.3% last year. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is thus seen to decline steadily \nfrom the equivalent of 2.9% of GDP last year. The federal \ngovernment\u2019s success in reaching its \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit target, equal \nto 1.0% of GDP by 2020, will depend on how effectively reform \nis implemented. \n\nFollowing a policy rate hike in January 2018, monetary \n\npolicy will likely complement \ufb01scal consolidation toward \nmanaging aggregate demand with an eye to easing the \neconomy back to its potential growth rate of about 5.0%. \nBank\u00a0Negara Malaysia, the central bank, has reiterated \nits intention to balance risks as a more upbeat outlook for \ndomestic growth threatens higher in\ufb02ation.

Another would be volatility \nin \ufb01nancial markets. Malaysia has sufficient buffers, however, \nto\u00a0counter any foreseeable risk.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014becoming a  \nhigh-tech economy\nMalaysia is set to become a high-income country in the next \nfew years. Building on that milestone, the country aspires \nto move up the regional and global production network and \nsupply chain to become a high-tech economy. Realizing that \naspiration is not preordained. One of the biggest challenges \nwill be to produce the kind of products and services that will \ntransform Malaysia into a knowledge economy. The\u00a0country\u2019s \nmanufacturing industry is already highly integrated into \nglobal value chains. Malaysia is opening up its service \nsector, meanwhile, as part of the integration process with \nits partners in the Association of Southeast\u00a0Asian Nations \n(ASEAN). However, to compete with a new set of high-\nincome peers, Malaysia will have to add more value by moving \ninto more complex stages of high-technology production. \nThese\u00a0stages\u00a0include, on the upstream side, research and \ndevelopment and product conceptualization and, on the \ndownstream side, logistics and the commercialization of \nhigh-tech goods and services (Figure\u00a03.26.8). \n\nToday, the more complex segments of the production \nprocesses in which Malaysia participates are handled abroad. \nFor Malaysia to capture more of these segments, it needs a \ncritical mass of highly skilled workers. Achieving this would \nrequire Malaysia to improve the quality of general education \nand of its technical and vocational training institutions, as \nwell as provide more opportunities for workers to upgrade \ntheir capabilities on the job and thereby master the technology \nunderlying the more complex stages of production. \n\nSecondary education in Malaysia underperforms the \naverage in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development. As\u00a0indicated by the scores of Malaysian \n15-year-olds in tests conducted in 2015 by the Programme for \nInternational Student Assessment, it also trails its ASEAN \npartners Singapore and Viet Nam (Figure 3.26.9). The\u00a0labor \nforce is becoming more technology-ready, but this trend can be \nstrengthened with more and better training on the job. In its \nGlobal Competitiveness Report 2017\u20132018, the World Economic \nForum ranked Malaysia 46 out of 137 countries for technology-\nreadiness, considerably below the Republic of Korea, which \nranked 29 and has already achieved high-tech economy status. \nMalaysia trailed even more in higher education and training, \n\n3.26.8\u2002 Moving up the electronics value chain\n\nValue\nadded\n\nNew investment\n\nApplications\n\nRetail\n\nChallenges for \nMalaysia\n\nR&D\n\nAdvertising\n\nDesign\n\nLogistics\n\nManufacturing\n\nSemiconductors and electronics production process\n\nSource: ADB based on Idtech Report.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.26.9\u2002 Math and reading scores in \n\nselected\u00a0economies, 2015\n\nReading\nMathematics\n\nIndonesia\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nOECD average\n\nViet Nam\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nPeople\u2019s Rep. of China \n\nSingapore\n\n0\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nScore\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment.\nNote: The Programme for International Student \nAssessment assesses middle-schoolers in 72 countries. \nMathematics measures the ability of a 15 year-old to \nformulate, employ, and interpret mathematics to describe, \npredict, and explain phenomena.

Such\u00a0comparative \nindicators underscore the need for Malaysia to strengthen its \neducation system and opportunities for on-the-job training if \nit hopes to climb up the production value chain and become a \nhigh-tech economy. \n\nAware of those challenges, the government adopted in \nearly 2018 a strategy to tackle them and enable the domestic \nproduction of more sophisticated goods and services. The\u00a0three \npillars of the strategy are selective investment targeting, \nwhich favors foreign investors willing to transfer technology \nand train workers while discouraging those seeking only a \nlow-cost production base; the creation of digital free-trade \nzones to facilitate e-commerce and equip smaller enterprises \nwith digital technology; and pursuing a consultative policy \ndubbed National Industry\u00a04.0, which, among other things, aims \nto build factories of the future and enhance entrepreneur and \nworker capacity in product conceptualization, design, usage, \nmarketing, and distribution. Effective\u00a0implementation of the \nstrategy is critical to the realization of Malaysia\u2019s aspiration to \nbecome a high-tech economy over the long term.\n\n\fMyanmar\n\nGDP  growth  picked  up  in  fiscal  2017  to  6.8%.  Inflation  eased,  and  the  current  account \ndeficit  widened.  With  continued  economic  reform,  growth  should  be  sustained  this  year  and \naccelerate next year. Inflation will likely edge up and the current account deficit widen further. \nBy pursuing reform to improve the business environment, policy makers can sustain the sizable \nforeign direct investment needed over the medium term to finance the current account deficit. \n\nEconomic performance\nIn \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended 31 March 2018), economic \ngrowth quickened to the equivalent of an estimated 6.8% \nin FY2017, up from 5.9% in FY2016. Data on demand-side \ncomponents of GDP are limited, but support appears to have \ncome from stronger agriculture, growth in exports, and robust \nprivate consumption, with investment continuing to\u00a0soften. \n\nBy sector, agriculture, which provides about 30% of GDP, \nturned around with better weather to post growth estimated \nat 3.5%, reversing drought-induced contraction in FY2016. \nThe industry and service sectors maintained strong growth \nestimated to exceed 8.0%. Robust manufacturing drove \nindustrial output higher, while services bene\ufb01tted from \nbuoyant tourism and strengthening domestic consumption. \nMerchandise exports are estimated to have grown by \n\n15.0% in FY2017 in US dollar terms, reversing 0.3% contraction \nin the previous year. Exports were driven by rice shipments \nestimated at 2.8 million tons, the highest in half a century, \nand high demand for garments. Earnings from service exports \nappear to have remained buoyant, with the Ministry of \nHotels and Tourism reporting international tourist arrivals \nup by 18.0% last year to reach 3.4 million (Figure 3.27.1). \nPrivate\u00a0consumption seems to have remained strong, supported \nby higher purchasing power for urban residents and more \ncommercial activity in the private sector. Investment growth \nmay have softened, however, as investors awaited clarity on a \nnew company law expected in\u00a0August 2018.\n\nEven as growth picked up, in\ufb02ation slowed to an estimated \n\n5.3% from 6.8% in FY2016, re\ufb02ecting mainly lower food \nin\ufb02ation with recovery in agriculture (Figure 3.27.2). Subdued \ninternational grains prices, slower monetary expansion, and \na stable exchange rate helped keep the lid on in\ufb02ation, which \nnevertheless began edging up in September 2017. \n\nThis chapter was written by Yumiko Tamura of the Myanmar Resident Mission, \nADB, Nay\u00a0Pyi\u00a0Taw; Thiam Hee Ng of the Southeast Asia Department, ADB, \nManila; and Marthe\u00a0Hinojales of the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, ADB,\u00a0Manila.\n\n3.27.1\u2002Tourism indicators\n\nTourist arrivals\n\nRevenue from tourism\n\nMillion\n\n$ billion\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nNote: Data refer to calendar year.

With \nhigher service exports only partly offsetting the expanding trade \nde\ufb01cit, the current account de\ufb01cit is estimated to have widened to \nthe equivalent of 5.0% of GDP in FY2017 from 3.9% a year earlier. \nAfter depreciating by more than 10% from June to December 2016, \nthe Myanmar kyat was stable throughout 2017 (Figure 3.27.3).\n\nCredit growth slowed to an estimated 21.2% in FY2017 from \n25.5% in FY2016, according to an International Monetary Fund \nreport published in March 2018, as growth in the money supply \nslowed to an estimated 16.5% from 19.4%, re\ufb02ecting monetary \npolicy intended to rein in in\ufb02ation. Meanwhile, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nis estimated to have widened to the equivalent of 3.5% of GDP \nin FY2017 from 2.5% in FY2016 as the government increased \nspending on electric power infrastructure, health\u00a0care, education, \nand social welfare.\n\nEconomic prospects\nWith continued strong global growth, the external economic \nenvironment should remain favorable. The economy is so far little \naffected by the situation in Northern\u00a0Rakhine. Demand generated \nin Myanmar by foreign direct investment (FDI) should continue to \nsupport growth. GDP growth is projected at an annualized 6.8% \nin the 6 months from April to September 2018, before Myanmar \nadopts a new \ufb01scal year in October 2018 (Figure 3.27.4). Growth is \nforecast at 7.2% in FY2019 (ending 31 September 2019). \n\nAgriculture is forecast to continue to grow robustly, assuming \n\nnormal weather and favorable commodity prices. Signs indicate \nimproved conditions for manufacturing, with the Nikkei \npurchasing managers\u2019 index rising in February 2018 to 52.6, well \nabove the threshold of 50.0 indicating expansion (Figure 3.27.5). \nGrowth in industry is therefore projected to strengthen both this \nyear and next. Services should expand further with solid growth \nin tourism and information technology services.\n\nrise in international oil prices. In\ufb02ation is thus forecast to \naccelerate to 6.2% this year before moderating slightly to 6.0% \nin FY2019. The current account de\ufb01cit is forecast to widen to \nthe equivalent of 5.4% of GDP in FY2018 and 5.5% in FY2019. \nAn improved external environment will help export growth, but \nit will likely be outpaced by import growth needed to support \npublic investments in infrastructure and continuing\u00a0FDI. \n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected to remain near 4.0% of GDP \nover the next 2 years as public spending increases to support the \nsocioeconomic development agenda.

The\u00a0recent \ntrend of import growth outpacing export growth is likely to \npersist for some time, widening the trade de\ufb01cit. Although \nremittances and development assistance can cushion the growing \ntrade de\ufb01cit, substantial current account de\ufb01cits will remain and \nneed to be \ufb01nanced sustainably. With\u00a0underdeveloped capital \nmarkets, Myanmar cannot hope to attract sizable portfolio capital \nin\ufb02ows in the near future. FDI will therefore have to be the main \nsource of \ufb01nancing for the current account de\ufb01cit. As Myanmar \nhas favorable demographics thanks to a large and youthful \npopulation, FDI can help tap the country\u2019s potential for export-\noriented production of labor-intensive goods. \n\nAlthough Myanmar has liberalized policy in recent years \nto attract more FDI, a composite FDI regulatory restrictiveness \nindex that considers countries\u2019 limits on foreign equity holdings, \nscreening and approval mechanisms, and controls on capital \nrepatriation by foreign enterprises seems to suggest that \nMyanmar\u2019s\u00a0FDI regulations are more restrictive than in most \npeer economies in Southeast Asia (Figure 3.27.6). Moreover, in \nDoing Business 2018, the World Bank ranks Myanmar at 171 of \n190 economies, though it ranks better on some speci\ufb01cs, notably \nobtaining construction permits, paying taxes, and registering \nproperty. These points underscore the need for the country \nto liberalize its FDI regulations and improve the business \nenvironment.\n\nEncouragingly, progress in December 2017 toward enacting \na new company law can assure foreign investors that corporate \nreform will continue. Similarly, a government initiative to \nformulate a 238-point economic policy agenda, set out in the draft \nMyanmar Sustainable Development Plan, should keep investors \nengaged. Building on these initiatives, policy makers should \nimplement reform expeditiously and effectively to buoy investor \ncon\ufb01dence and attract sizable FDI in the years to come.\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n3.27.6\u2002 Foreign direct investment regulatory \n\nrestrictiveness index, 2016\n\n0 = open, 1 = restrictive\n\nCAM VIE\n\nLAO MAL\n\nINO MYA PHI\n\nCAM = Cambodia, INO = Indonesia, LAO = Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, MAL = Malaysia, MYA = Myanmar, \nPHI = Philippines, VIE = Viet Nam.\nSource: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fPhilippines\n\nBroad  expansion  in  aggregate  demand,  helped  by  higher  export  growth,  underpinned \nstrong  economic  growth  last  year.

Growth in construction \nmore than halved to 5.4% from 13.7% in 2016, largely from \nmoderation in private investment. \n\nBroad expansion in services eased from 7.4% in 2016 to \n6.7%, but the sector still provided nearly 60% of the expansion \nin GDP.

In\ufb02ation remained within the target of \n2%\u20134% set by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank. \nA 12.8% rise in merchandise exports in US dollar terms \nwas outpaced by 14.2% growth in merchandise imports. Brisk \ngrowth in manufacturing pushed up imports of raw materials, \nparts, and components, while stronger domestic demand pushed \nup imports of consumer and capital goods. Higher international \nfuel prices boosted the import bill for oil and petroleum \nproducts. The result was a trade de\ufb01cit of $41.2 billion, equal to \n13.1% of GDP and expanded from 11.7% in 2016 (Figure 3.28.5). \nStrong rises in remittances from overseas Filipinos and service \nexports, mainly business process outsourcing and tourism, \npartly offset the merchandise trade de\ufb01cit to yield a current \naccount de\ufb01cit of only $2.5 billion, equal to 0.8% of GDP but up \nfrom 0.4% in 2016.

Tax collection, providing 91% of \nrevenue, rose by 13.6% to equal 14.2% of GDP, improving from \n13.7% in 2016. Meanwhile, government expenditure rose by \n10.8% last year, taking the ratio of expenditure to GDP to 17.9% \nfrom 17.6% in 2016. Infrastructure spending\u2014mostly on roads, \n\ufb02ood control and irrigation, and school buildings\u2014rose by 15.4% \nto account for a fourth of the increase in total expenditure.\n\nEconomic prospects\nStrengthening domestic demand will underpin growth in \n2018 and 2019. Investment will be supported by large public \ninfrastructure projects such as national and provincial roads, \nrailways, airports, and the Philippines\u2019 \ufb01rst mass transit subway. \nExport growth will likely moderate from last year\u2019s rebound. \nLow unemployment and steady remittances will continue to \nsupport private consumption. GDP growth is thus forecast to \nstrengthen to 6.8% this year and 6.9% next (Figure\u00a03.28.7). \n\nAn accommodative \ufb01scal policy is likely to continue this \nyear and\u00a0next. The 2018 budget raises expenditure by 12.4% \nover last year, with two-thirds allocated to regions outside of \nMetro Manila. Allocations for the provinces are 25% higher \nthan in 2017 and are earmarked for rural development and \njob creation toward improving rural incomes. The budget for \ninfrastructure is a quarter higher, equal to 6.1% of GDP, up from \n5.4% in 2017. The government recently approved free tuition in \nall state universities and colleges under the Universal Access \nto Quality Tertiary Education Act, 2017 and free irrigation for \nsmallholder farmers under the Free Irrigation Service Act, 2018. \nThe government is mobilizing more revenue to allow for \nhigher investment in infrastructure and social services while \nkeeping the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit within 3.0% of GDP in the medium \nterm. It thus targets the ratio of revenue to GDP in the 2018 \nbudget to rise to 16.3% from 15.7% last year. Early progress \ntoward achieving the revenue target was made in December\u00a02017 \nwith the approval of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and \nInclusion law, the \ufb01rst phase of government\u2019s comprehensive \ntax reform program. The law is projected to yield \u00a890 billion \nin additional revenue in 2018 and \u00a8144 billion in 2019. Further \naugmentation of tax revenue is anticipated as the government \npursues succeeding phases of comprehensive tax reform. \nRemittances from overseas Filipinos are expected to \ncontinue to support household consumption. From the \ufb01scal \nside, a cut in the personal income tax should boost disposable \nincome and consumption among taxpayers, but an increase \nin excise taxes on petroleum products and a few other \ncommodities could be a counterweight restraining household \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n58\n\n56\n\n54\n\n52\n\n50\n\n3.28.6\u2002 Foreign direct investment net inflows\n\nAmount\n\n$ billion\n\n12\n\nShare\n\n% of GDP\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.28.7\u2002GDP growth\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.28.8\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\nOverall\nManufacturing\nServices\nRetail & wholesale\n\nMar May\n\nJul\n\nSep\n\nNov\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nSource: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. 2018.

On balance, strong household consumption is \nseen continuing this year and next.\n\nSeveral signs point to strengthening private investment. \nImports of capital goods rose by 16.9% year on year in January \n2018, while bank credit to businesses increased by 18.1% in \nthe same month. The\u00a0government is improving the investment \nclimate by streamlining procedures for doing business in \nnational and local agencies alike, including for business \nregistration and applications for permits. In\u00a0December 2017, \nFitch Ratings upgraded the Philippine rating for long-term \nforeign currency credit to BBB from BBB\u2013, which should \nreinforce market con\ufb01dence. A business outlook survey \nconducted by the central bank in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2018 found \nsentiment upbeat in response to strong domestic demand and \nthe expected increase in public infrastructure spending. \nBy sector, services will continue to provide much of \nGDP growth as broad expansion continues. The purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index in January 2018 reached its highest since \nMay 2016 with improving readings for services, trade, \nand manufacturing (Figure 3.28.8). Manufacturing will \ncontinue to expand on robust domestic demand and exports. \nThe\u00a0manufacturing production index rose by 21.9% year on \nyear in January 2018 on strong growth in food and beverages, \nconstruction materials, and some export-oriented products. \nConstruction will bene\ufb01t largely from public infrastructure \nprojects, but it is notable that building permits for privately \nconstructed commercial and office buildings expanded by \n23.2% year on year in the fourth quarter of 2017. \n\nAs growth strengthens, in\ufb02ation is projected to pick up \nto 4.0% in 2018, using a consumer price index series based on \n2006. In\ufb02ation in the \ufb01rst 2 months of this year accelerated to \n4.2% using that series but slowed to 3.7% using a new series \nrebased on 2012 (Figure 3.28.9). In\ufb02ation largely re\ufb02ected a \nrise in global oil and food prices and peso depreciation. Higher \nexcises on fuel, sugar-sweetened beverages, and cigarettes \nsince January 2018 could contribute to in\ufb02ation, but mitigation \nmeasures are under way. The government is moving away from \nrestrictions on the volume of rice imports toward tariffs on rice \nimports to help augment domestic supply and contain domestic \nrice prices. In\ufb02ation is forecast at 3.9% in 2019, with upward \nadjustment to monetary policy rates anticipated in line with \ntightening monetary policy globally (Figure 3.28.10). \n\nImport growth is expected to outpace export growth in \nlight of robust domestic demand. The expected widening of \nthe merchandise trade de\ufb01cit this year and next should mean \na wider but still modest current account de\ufb01cit, contained by \na further rise in remittances and service exports, notably in \nbusiness process outsourcing and tourism.

However, a strong external \npayments position appears to make the Philippines resilient \nunder any foreseeable external shock. External debt trended \ndown to the equivalent of 23.3% of GDP in\u00a02017. National \ngovernment debt has moderated to 42.1% of GDP and is \ndenominated mostly in local currency (Figure 3.28.11).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014enhancing the \ngovernment\u2019s absorptive capacity \nfor\u00a0infrastructure development\nThe Philippine government has embarked on a massive \ninfrastructure program worth $160 billion\u2013$180 billion \nfrom 2017 to 2022, called \u201cBuild Build Build.\u201d The program \naims to address infrastructure bottlenecks that have long \nconstrained Philippine competitiveness globally and its \nlong-term growth prospects. Under the program, public \ninfrastructure spending is targeted to rise from 4.5% of GDP \nin\u00a02016 to 7.3% by 2022. The program has already gathered \nmomentum, with public spending on infrastructure estimated \nto rise by nearly a percentage point of GDP last year to reach \n5.4%. This is a remarkable achievement for the \ufb01rst year. \nHowever, considering the wide array of infrastructure projects \nunder the program, the challenge for the government is to \nensure that government departments, and other implementing \nagencies have the adequate absorptive capacity to roll out and \nimplement such large and complex projects. \n\nEncouragingly, efforts are already under way to enhance \nthe absorptive capacity of government agencies, including their \ntechnical and institutional capabilities for project readiness \nand budget execution. Initiatives include a proposed shift \nfrom a multiyear budget system to an annual cash-based \nsystem effective in January 2019 with a view to improving \nbudget execution. A budget reform bill is being pursued in the \nlegislature to institutionalize improvements in the \ufb01nancial \nmanagement, budgeting, accountability, and result-orientation \nof the budget process and public spending. \n\nBuilding on these recent initiatives, concerted efforts \non three fronts should help further enhance the absorptive \ncapacity of government agencies: making interagency \ncoordination more cohesive; fostering stronger partnership \nbetween government agencies, the private sector, and \ndevelopment partners; and strengthening the skills of staff in \nimplementing public agencies. \n\nThe timely completion of infrastructure projects requires \n\nmore cohesive interagency coordination in planning and \nbudgeting bodies and in sectoral government departments and \n\n\f276(cid:12)(cid:12)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nline agencies. A project facilitation, monitoring, and innovation \ntask force was established in June 2017 to expeditiously \naddress bottlenecks constraining infrastructure projects at \nevery step in the project cycle, from planning and approval to \nimplementation and monitoring. Building on this initiative, \nthe task force has potential to serve as a center for interagency \ncoordination and strategic planning for infrastructure \ndevelopment.\n\nAnother way to expand absorptive capacity in public \nsector bodies would be to strengthen partnerships between \nthe government, the private sector, and development partners. \nThe\u00a0private sector and development partners can bring in \ntechnical support, innovation, and new ideas for project \npreparation and implementation. \n\nFinally, there is an urgent need to augment technical \ncapacity within agencies. Some projects such as long-span \nbridges and tunnels are technically complex and beyond \nprevious experience in the Philippines. These projects need \nto\u00a0be pursued with international best practices, knowledge, and \ninnovation. Capacity-building takes time but is indispensable. \nAs many infrastructure projects are already being prepared and \nimplemented, the government may facilitate on-the-job training \nand transfer of knowledge and best practices from experts.\n\n\fSingapore\n\nAfter  a  sharp  pickup  in  2017,  GDP  growth  will  slow  only  slightly  in  2018  and  2019, \nsupported  by  strong  but  moderating  exports  of  manufactures.  Inflation  will  rise  on  higher \nfood  prices  and  excise  taxes  but  remain  moderate,  while  the  current  account  surplus  will \nexpand along with GDP. A key policy issue is improving corporate capacity to innovate to \nensure  that  it  stays  competitive  in  the  digital  age.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth accelerated to 3.6% in 2017 from 2.4% in 2016 \non robust performances in manufacturing and services. \nManufacturing grew by 10.1%, the highest rate since 2010, \nas strong electronics and precision engineering clusters \noutweighed weakness notably in biomedicine and transport. \nManufacturing expansion lifted the contribution of industry \nto GDP growth to 1.4 percentage points, despite contraction \nin construction by 8.4% (Figure 3.29.1). Services expanded by \n2.8%, double their rate in 2016 owing to a strong result from \n\ufb01nance and insurance, and from transportation and storage. \nThe sector contributed 1.9 percentage points to GDP growth.\nOn the demand side, the main sources of growth in 2017 \nwere exports, investments, and consumption (Figure 3.29.2). \nReal exports of goods and services grew by 4.1%, driven \nlargely by exports of machinery and transport equipment \nand of chemical products. Imports also grew at a faster rate \nof 5.2%, however, turning net exports negative and shaving \n0.7 percentage points off growth. Investment contributed \n2.4\u00a0percentage points to growth as \ufb01rms accumulated \ninventory in expectation of stronger demand in the \ufb01rst half of \n2018\u2014and despite \ufb01xed capital outlays falling as infrastructure \nspending slumped. Private consumption grew by 3.1% on a \nmodest rise in wages, and government spending rose by 4.1%, \nnotably on social services. Combined consumption contributed \n1.5\u00a0percentage points to growth. \n\nAfter 2 consecutive years of de\ufb02ation, the consumer \nprice index rose by 0.6% in 2017 as prices increased for \ntransportation, education, and food, which together account for \nover 40% of the index. In\ufb02ation was tempered by lower rents \nand utility prices. Transportation costs, the largest contributor \nto in\ufb02ation, rose on higher prices for gasoline and parking, \n\nThis chapter was written by Minsoo Lee and Mai Lin Villaruel of the \nEconomic\u00a0Research and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.29.1\u2002Contributions to growth by industry\n\nManufacturing\nFinance & insurance\nWholesale & retail trade\nTransportation & storage\nOther services industries\nOwnership of dwellings\nInformation & communications\nBusiness services\nAccommodation & food services\nUtilities\nOther goods industries\nConstruction\n\n-0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\nPercentage points\n\nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

The seasonally \nadjusted trend in exports since the beginning of the year points \nto moderating export growth, while imports are expected to \nincrease as domestic demand grows. On balance, though, net \nexports will contribute to growth this year and in 2019. Trade is \nexpected to post surpluses in both years. With rising net service \nreceipts as well, the current account surplus should expand \nmarginally to 19.0% of GDP in 2018 and stay there in 2019.\nIn\ufb02ation moderated a tad in January 2018. Soft rental \nhousing and labor markets will dampen prices this year and \nnext as rising food and oil prices and a 10% increase in the \ntobacco excise push prices higher.

Further, rising in\ufb02ation risks in the US \ncould push up US interest rates more than expected, upsetting \ncapital \ufb02ows and raising local interest rates.

The forum\u2019s executive opinion \nsurvey identi\ufb01ed insufficient capacity to innovate as the second \nbiggest problem in doing business in Singapore. At the same \ntime, new information technologies generate new products \nand business models that disrupt established business norms \nand require specialized skills that are lacking in the local \nworkforce. Although businesses recognize the importance \nof digital transformation for growth and productivity, \nimpediments to digital transformation remain in the form \nof skills gaps and fear of change. A policy challenge is to \nencourage businesses to adapt to new smart technologies and \nto train workers in new skills.\n\nresearch and development for innovation in digital industries \nsince 2000. This investment amounts to 14.1% of budgetary \nexpenditure annually, equal to 2.3% of GDP (Figure 2.29.9), \nranking Singapore just behind the\u00a0US. The government \nhas launched 23 industry transformation maps (ITMs) that \nequip each industry with a road map for skills development, \ninnovation, investment in new technologies with high value \nadded, and collaboration with partners. ITMs provide \ncompanies with industry-speci\ufb01c \ufb01nancial and logistical \nassistance to achieve these goals. In\u00a0addition, the FY2018 \nbudget has a package of incentives including tax and licensing \nfee reductions for the commercial use of intellectual property \nand assistance to resolve \ufb01rms\u2019 inhibitions against digital \ntransformation.\n\nThe government has launched several initiatives, including \n\nits SkillsFuture platform, toward improving Singaporean \n\ufb01rms\u2019 capacity to innovate. They provide opportunities to \ndeepen skills through subsidized education and training that \nresponds to constantly evolving needs. The Capability Transfer \nProgramme, meanwhile, improves the transmission of skills \nfrom foreign specialists to local workers. These\u00a0programs \nshould be complemented by public\u2013private collaboration to \ndesign training approaches\u2014such as skills-based internship \nprograms, competitive incentives packages, and advocacy \nplans\u2014that can encourage participation and help retain trained \nworkers. The ITMs should be properly communicated to the \nprivate sector, and businesses should be encouraged through \nlogistical support and \ufb01nancial incentives under various \ngovernment initiatives to craft digitally enabled and data-\ndriven business models. To ensure \ufb01rms\u2019 full participation, the \ngovernment should design safeguards for risks to cybersecurity \nand data privacy, provide guarantees against damages if risks \nmaterialize, and formulate policies, guidelines, and explicit \nagreements on how data can be used, to minimize the risks \ninherent in sharing proprietary data. \n\n\fThailand\n\nHelped by a turnaround in exports and agriculture, economic growth improved last year to \n3.9%. Inflation remained low, and the current account surplus swelled. Annual GDP growth \nis likely to inch up to 4.0% this year and 4.1% next, as inflation stirs mildly and the current \naccount surplus narrows. A worsening skills shortage needs to be addressed to reinvigorate \ngrowth  and  achieve  the  goals  of  the  government\u2019s  Thailand  4.0  development  strategy.\n\nEconomic performance \nDriven by strengthening external demand and reviving \nagriculture, GDP growth improved from 3.3% in 2016 to 3.9% \nin 2017 (Figure\u00a03.30.1). Exports of goods and services rose last \nyear by 5.5% at constant prices, improving on 2.8% growth in \n2016. Strong recovery in global trade and a pickup in commodity \nprices fueled impressive 9.7% growth in the dollar value of \nmerchandise exports, up from 0.1% growth in 2016. While \nexports of agricultural products such as rice and rubber rose \nby a hefty 20.0%, exports of manufactures such as electronics, \nchemicals, and automobile parts and components accelerated by \n10.3%. Service exports performed well in 2017 as\u00a0tourist arrivals \ngrew by 8.8% to reach 35.4\u00a0million. \n\nStrong demand drew down large inventories built up \nin 2016. However, \ufb01xed investment has yet to recover from \nyears in the doldrums, posting only feeble 0.9% growth last \nyear (Figure\u00a03.30.2). Private investment showed faint signs of \nrecovery, while public investment, which had grown by 28.4% \nin 2015 and 9.5% in 2016, declined by 1.2% last year as a new \ngovernment procurement act caused delays in procurement \nand project implementation. Meanwhile, with slightly higher \nspending on machinery and equipment, private investment grew \nby 1.7%, improving on 0.5% growth in 2016. Private\u00a0consumption \nexpanded by 3.2%, slightly up from 3.0% in 2016. This\u00a0was \nsupported by a 3.9% increase in farm income as higher harvests \noffset weaker prices. However, high household debt remained a \ndrag on private consumption. \n\nBy sector, agriculture grew by 6.2% on better weather, \nstrongly reversing a decline of 2.5% in 2016. The service sector \nwas another big contributor to GDP growth, expanding by 5.3% \nto outpace the 4.6% rise in 2016. Surging tourist numbers helped \nfuel strong growth in the hotel and restaurant industries, which \nexpanded by 8.5%. Growth in manufacturing continued to be \nfeeble at 2.5% last year, only marginally higher than the 2.3% \ngrowth in 2016. Meanwhile,\u00a0construction\u00a0contracted by 2.3% as \nthe implementation of public\u00a0infrastructure projects slowed.\n\nThis chapter was written by Thiam Hee Ng of the Southeast Asia Department, \nADB, Manila.\n\n3.30.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\n3.0\n\n3.3\n\n3.9\n\n2.7\n\n1.0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: National Economic and Social Development \nBoard. http://www.nesdb.go.th (accessed 8 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.2\u2002Fixed investment growth\n\nPrivate\nPublic\nTotal\n\n%\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n-1.5\n\n%\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: National Economic and Social Development \nBoard. http://www.nesdb.go.th (accessed 8 March 2018).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f282(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nDespite better growth, in\ufb02ation remained well under \ncontrol, with headline in\ufb02ation reaching only 0.7% last year, \nup\u00a0from 0.2% in 2016. This largely re\ufb02ected ample excess \ncapacity in manufacturing. Fuel\u00a0prices increased in line with \nglobal oil prices, but food prices remained quite stable as \nproduction rebounded. \n\nTurning to the balance of payments, rising merchandise \n\nexports were accompanied by strong import growth at 14.4% \n(Figure 3.30.3). The higher imports were mostly raw materials \nand intermediate goods needed to support the expanded \nproduction of electronics for export. Despite the strong \nimports, the trade balance continued to post a large surplus of \n$31.9 billion, equal to 7.0% of GDP in 2017, albeit smaller than \nthe 2016 surplus of $36.5 billion, or 8.9% of GDP. Net service \nexports continued to show impressive growth at 23.0% in 2017, \nthough down slightly from 25.9% growth in 2016. The\u00a0current \naccount balance thus posted a surplus of $49.3 billion, equal \nto 10.8% of GDP. The \ufb01nancial account showed a de\ufb01cit of \n$19.1 billion because of large investments abroad. In sum, \nalready high international reserves continued to rise, reaching \n$202.6\u00a0billion at the end of 2017, sufficient to cover 11.1 months \nof imports or 3.3 times the country\u2019s short-term foreign debt. \n\nThe large current account surplus and strong interest in \nbaht-denominated bonds from foreign investors helped to drive \nappreciation of the Thai baht by 3.9% against the US dollar \nin\u00a02017. The stock market also had a good run in 2017, with the \nStock Exchange of Thailand index up by 14% partly on greater \ninterest from foreign investors and expectations of further baht \nappreciation.\n\nDespite low in\ufb02ation, the Bank of Thailand, the central \nbank, kept its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.5% throughout \n2017 as the economy showed signs of picking up (Figure 3.30.4). \nOn the \ufb01scal front, policy mildly supported growth with a \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit that was only marginally higher than in 2016. \nThat\u00a0said, to boost domestic consumption, the government \napproved an aid package worth B42 billion in August 2017 \nthat entitled 11.4 million low-income people to receive welfare \nsmartcards that gave them a monthly allowance for consumer \ngoods and subsidized their use of public transportation. \n\nActual government expenditure in \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, \nended 30\u00a0September 2017) was 95.6% of the budgeted \ufb01gure, or \nequal to 18.1% of GDP. Actual revenue turned out to be 80.5% \nof the budget, or 15.2% of GDP, slightly lower than the 16.6% \nrecorded in FY2016. A one-off boost to revenue in FY2016 \nfrom the auction of the fourth generation telecommunication \nspectrum may have pushed down the ratio of revenue to GDP. \nAdjusting for changes in the government\u2019s off-budget cash \naccount, the overall \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in FY2017 was equal to 2.7% \nof GDP, as in FY2016 (Figure 3.30.5).

Agriculture growth, having turned \npositive last year, is likely to stabilize at a much lower \ngrowth rate. The slack in growth thus created will likely be \ncompensated\u00a0by a surge in public investment, especially in \nbig-ticket infrastructure projects, as domestic consumption \nand private investment play complementary roles. Annual GDP \ngrowth is thus seen to inch up to 4.0% this year and a shade \nhigher next year (Figure 3.30.6).\n\nPublic investment is expected to rebound after its lackluster \n\nperformance in 2017, with B900 billion in infrastructure projects \nplanned under the Transport Infrastructure Action Plan, 2017 \nfor double-tracking railways, extending mass rapid transit lines, \nand expanding highways. Most of the projects are expected to \nbe implemented in 2018 and 2019. Further, \ufb01ve large projects \nin the Eastern\u00a0Economic Corridor selected for fast-tracking are \ntargeted for approval by the end of this year and implementation \nimmediately through public\u2013private partnership. Major \ninfrastructure upgrades in the corridor aim to expand a deep \nseaport and improve its links to business parks, airports, the \ncapital, and adjacent coastal areas. The\u00a0implementation of public \ninvestment projects is expected to be smoother than in the\u00a0past \nas government agencies become more familiar with a new \nprocurement system introduced last year. \n\nPrivate investment is also expected to pick up, albeit \nmodestly, as capacity utilization tightens in some sectors after \nthe huge drawdown of inventories in recent years. Last year\u2019s \nrise in export demand has pushed up utilization in some key \nindustries to where new investment in machinery and equipment \nis warranted to expand capacity. The\u00a0implementation of big \npublic infrastructure projects, especially in transportation, could \nspur private investment in construction. The business outlook \nis more optimistic, prompting sharply higher applications for \ninvestment promotion support from the Board of Investment.\nDomestic consumption is forecast to pick up slightly. \n\nConsumer con\ufb01dence has improved, reaching in January 2018 the \nhighest level in 3 years. Government aid packages implemented in \nrecent years to help low-income farmers and others are expected \nto maintain their spending levels. A hike effective on 1 April 2018 \nin the daily minimum wage, by B5\u2013B22 or 2%\u20137% depending on \nthe sector, should help sustain private consumption. Household \ndebt is high but seems to have peaked. Growth\u00a0in public \nconsumption is expected to accelerate with a supplemental \nbudget to support local communities and agriculture\u00a0reform.\n\nThe stellar performance from tourism is expected to continue \n\n(Figure 3.30.7). Government promotion of tourism as market \neconomies overseas strengthen should continue to support higher \ntourist arrivals.

More investment will be \nneeded to meet tourist demand.\n\nHigher growth and a consequent tightening in the labor \nmarket could push up in\ufb02ation, as will higher global fuel prices. \nIn\ufb02ation is thus forecast to edge up but remain modest at 1.2% this \nyear and 1.3% next (Figure 3.30.8). Food prices will likely be kept \nin check with the recovery in agricultural production. The higher \nminimum wage is projected to have a minimal effect on in\ufb02ation.\nLooking again at the balance of payments, merchandise \nexport growth is expected to moderate this year and next after \nits strong performance in 2017. While baht appreciation and \nweaker global demand for electronics will somewhat dampen \nprospects for merchandise exports, net service exports should be \npositive as tourist arrivals continue to rise. Merchandise import \ngrowth is projected to outpace exports on increased demand for \nraw materials and intermediate goods needed to support large \ninfrastructure projects and higher manufacturing for export. \nThe\u00a0trade surplus should thus shrink, narrowing the current \naccount surplus from 10.8% of GDP last year to 8.0% this year \nand 7.5% next year (Figure 3.30.9). Portfolio and FDI in\ufb02ows \nare expected to increase, for a smaller \ufb01nancial account de\ufb01cit. \nInternational reserves will remain more than ample to cover \nnormal imports and to service short-term debt. \n\nWith continued low in\ufb02ation and a comfortable balance of \npayments, ample scope exists for monetary easing, even after \nallowing for an expected hike in US interest rates. Last year, the \ncentral bank left its policy interest rate unchanged and the baht \nfree to appreciate. Further large portfolio in\ufb02ows could push the \nbaht up further, threatening to hinder export competitiveness. \nManageable public and external debt means there is scope to \nstimulate growth through higher \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits in the near term. \nExternal risks to the economic outlook would include a \ndisappointing global economic recovery. A domestic risk is \npossible delay in implementing the government\u2019s ambitious \npublic infrastructure investment program, as most of the large \nEastern\u00a0Economic Corridor projects are expected to be \ufb01nanced \nthrough public\u2013private partnership, requiring negotiations with \nprivate \ufb01rms that could take longer than expected. Finally, \nuncertainty regarding the timing of the next general election \nmay\u00a0affect recovery in private investment.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014upgrading skills to  \nsupport Thailand 4.0\nThailand has embarked on an ambitious economic reform \nprogram known as Thailand 4.0 to accelerate growth over the \nlong run to 5%\u20136%.

The EEC targets B1.7 trillion in \npublic and private investment over the next 5 years to upgrade \ninfrastructure and industry. \n\nAmong the many factors needed for the program to succeed, \nthe most critical is upgraded workforce skills. Policy to enhance \nworkforce skills in support of Thailand 4.0 divides into three \nareas: enhancing the quality of secondary education; promoting \nthe study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in \nhigher education institutions; and forging stronger collaboration \nbetween educational institutions and the private sector. \n\nA large share of secondary school students lack basic skills \n\nin mathematics, reading, and science. Test results from the \nProgramme for International Student Assessment 2015 showed \nmore than 50% of Thailand\u2019s 15-year-old students do not have \nbasic reading skills or pro\ufb01ciency in mathematics, and 47% \nlack basic scienti\ufb01c knowledge (Figure 3.30.10). Enhancing the \nquality of secondary education across almost all subjects is thus \ncrucial to ensure that students possess the basic skills necessary \nto succeed in tertiary education. \n\nFurther, universities are not turning out enough graduates \nin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Less than \n20% of tertiary students are enrolled in science or engineering \n(Figure 3.30.11). Greater cooperation between local educational \ninstitutions and universities abroad can help boost the number \nof students with the technical skills needed for Thailand 4.0. \nRecognizing this, Thailand has opened up education in the EEC \nto foreign educational institutions. Carnegie Mellon University, \nfor example, is collaborating with King Mongkut\u2019s Institute of \nTechnology Ladkrabang to expand research and education in \nnew digital technologies.\n\nFinally, greater collaboration between the private sector \nand higher education and technical and vocational education \nand training institutions can help Thailand move away from \na current education system driven by supply toward one that \nresponds to demand. These partnerships can help ensure that \nthe training and education students receive equip them to meet \nthe demands of industry, thus making them more employable. \nEducation reform needs time to translate into upgraded \nskills in the young workforce. In the meantime, to \ufb01ll the skills \ngap, skilled personnel may need to be recruited from abroad. \nIncentives may be able to entice back highly skilled Thais \nworking abroad. Encouragingly, the government is offering tax \nincentives to foreign executives and specialists in companies \nsituated in the EEC.\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nDriven  by  rising  foreign  direct  investment,  vigorous  export  growth,  strengthening \nagriculture,  and  robust  domestic  demand,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  accelerate  from \n6.8%  last  year  to  7.1%  this  year,  then  ease  back  to  6.8%  in  2019.  Inflation  will  edge  up \nbut  remain  modest,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  narrow.  Closing  the  country\u2019s \nwidening skills gap is key to remaining attractive to foreign investors and sustaining growth. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth accelerated from 6.2% in 2016 to 6.8% in 2017, its highest \nrate since before the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. A hefty \nrise in exports, a strong increase in investment, and buoyant \nprivate consumption underpinned growth last year (Figure\u00a03.31.1).\nA rebound in global trade, especially in electronics, helped \n\nmerchandise exports rise by a whopping 21.2%, measured in \ndollar value. Another boost to aggregate demand came from the \n9.8% growth in domestic investment lifted by high foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) and rapid credit growth. Registered FDI surged \nby 47.0% in 2017 to reach nearly $36 billion, while disbursed \nFDI jumped by 10.8% to a record $17.5 billion. As the consumer \ncon\ufb01dence index rose to a high\u00a0117, private consumption \nincreased by 7.4%, more than offsetting slight moderation in \npublic consumption caused by continued \ufb01scal consolidation. \nRe\ufb02ecting buoyant private consumption, retail sales grew by \n10.9% in 2017 to a record $129.6 billion, equal to 58.6% of GDP. \nBy sector, industry and construction increased by 8.0% as \nthe rebound in aggregate demand helped the sector shrug off a \n7.1% contraction in mining to improve upon its 7.6% rise a year \nearlier. Within\u00a0industry, manufacturing rose by 14.4%, led by \nstrong export-oriented manufacturing, especially of electronics, \ntelecommunication products, and textiles. These performances \nmore than offset mild moderation in construction growth \nfrom 10.0% in 2016 to 8.7% last year, caused largely by banks \ntightening standards for credit to real estate.\n\nCoupled with strong domestic demand and a record 29.1% \nrise\u00a0in international tourist arrivals, services posted 7.4% growth, \nup from 7.0% in 2016. Thanks to better weather and strong \nexport demand, output from agriculture, forestry, and \ufb01sheries \ngrew by 2.9% last year, more than twice the pace in 2016. \n\nStrengthened aggregate demand put pressure on prices, \nas did higher international oil prices and continued upward \nadjustment to government-administered fees for public education \nand health\u00a0care.

A\u00a021.2% rise in \nmerchandise exports was led by 31.0% expansion for mobile \nphones and components, which now comprise 21% of all exports. \nImports grew even faster at 22.3%. Imports of telephone parts \njumped by 53.2%, while those of other electronic components \npicked up by 35.0%. This re\ufb02ected Viet Nam\u2019s growing integration \nin regional supply chains. Meanwhile, buoyant domestic \nconsumption drove imports of consumer goods higher by 17.0%. \n\nThe capital account recorded a surplus estimated to equal 8.9% \n\nof GDP, bolstered by strong FDI disbursements and an estimated \n$1.9\u00a0billion in portfolio capital in\ufb02ows as the government relaxed \nrestrictions on foreign ownership of domestic businesses. While \nsmall by regional standards, last year\u2019s portfolio capital in\ufb02ow \nwas a sevenfold increase over 2016. Surpluses in the current \nand capital account balances added up to an overall balance of \npayments surplus estimated to equal 5.6% of GDP (Figure 3.31.3).\n\nThe strengthening balance of payments allowed the State Bank \n\nof Viet Nam, the central bank, to increase foreign reserves to an \nestimated 3.0 months of import cover, up from 2.6 months at the \nbeginning of the year. The Viet Nam dong was stable, depreciating \nby 1.2% against the US dollar during the year (Figure\u00a03.31.4).\n\nWith in\ufb02ation rising but still moderate and an improving \nbalance of payments, the central bank cut policy interest rates in \nJuly 2017 by 25 basis points, taking the re\ufb01nancing rate down to \n6.25% and the discount rate down to 4.25%. Average commercial \nbank lending rates consequently fell by 0.5\u20131.0 percentage points \nduring the year. Declining lending rates and improving consumer \nand investor sentiment helped to stimulate credit growth to an \nestimated 18.0% in 2017, meeting the government target. Broad \nmoney (M2) supply increased by an estimated 16.0% year on year \n(Figure 3.31.5).\n\nEfforts to rein in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit began to pay dividends \n\nin\u00a02017. The official budget de\ufb01cit narrowed to equal an \nestimated 3.5% of GDP, down from 4.3% in 2016. Revenue \ngrew by 12.5% to equal 24.8% of GDP, up slightly from 24.5% \nin 2016. The rise in revenue was broad in that collections rose \nfrom personal income, corporate income, and value-added \ntax alike. Meanwhile,\u00a0expenditure grew by 9.3%, exceeding \nbudgeted growth by 2.0 percentage points. Public debt including \ngovernment debt guarantees fell to equal an estimated 61.3% of \nGDP by year-end from 63.6% a year earlier. \n\nProgress in divestment from state-owned enterprises picked \n\nup in 2017 but still fell short of the target. The government \nsold equity stakes in 39 state-owned enterprises, against a \ntarget of\u00a044.

The NPL ratio reportedly fell to 2.3% of all \noutstanding loans at the end of 2017, only marginally lower \nthan the 2.5% recorded at the end of 2016. This re\ufb02ected in part \nthe continued transfer of NPLs from banks to the state-owned \nViet\u00a0Nam Asset Management Company (VAMC). Meanwhile, \nNPLs held by both the VAMC and banks, combined with \npotential\u00a0bad debts, stood at an estimated 7.9% of outstanding \nloans at the end of 2017, down from 10.1% in 2016. A\u00a0National \nAssembly resolution effective from August 2017 that grants \nto the\u00a0VAMC additional powers to resolve NPLs is hoped to \naccelerate NPL resolution in the coming years.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 7.1% in 2018 before \neasing to 6.8% in 2019 (Figure 3.31.6). Growth will be led by \nvigorous export expansion, rising domestic consumption, strong \ninvestment\u00a0fueled by FDI, and strengthening agriculture.\n\nRobust private consumption is expected to be supported by \nrising incomes and stable in\ufb02ation. Prospects for private investment \nare bright. Business sentiment remains buoyant, as indicated in \nDecember\u00a02017 by upbeat business survey results and in February \n2018 by the Nikkei purchasing managers\u2019 index (Figure\u00a03.31.7). \nPrivate investment is projected to bene\ufb01t from Viet Nam having \nrisen 14 places in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business rankings for \n2018. The number of newly established enterprises hit a record high \nof 126,859 in 2017, up by 15.2% from 2016. The government target is \nfor an additional 135,000 new enterprises in 2018.\n\nBy sector, solid FDI should enable industry to maintain strong \n\ngrowth momentum. Continued strengthening in the US and the \neuro area will further boost manufacturing over the next 2 years. \nConstruction is projected to pick up in 2018 and 2019, bene\ufb01tting \nfrom last year\u2019s record FDI commitments and disbursements \n(Figure 3.31.8). The service sector is projected to sustain growth \nin 2018 and 2019, with tourist arrivals forecast to rise by 15%\u201320% \nin 2018 and bank lending to grow by 17%\u201318%. Agriculture is \nexpected to continue to pick up over the next 2 years, growing \nin\u00a02018 in line with the government target of 2.8%\u20133.0%.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to edge up but remain broadly stable, \n\n$ billion\n\naveraging 3.7% this year and rising to 4.0% in 2019 as strong \ndomestic demand and high bank lending are partly offset by stable \ndomestic food and transportation costs and smaller increases \nin administered prices for education, health care, electricity, \nand water.

Merchandise \nexports are forecast to rise by 15%\u201320% in 2018 and 2019. \nRemittances are likely to remain strong thanks to improving \nglobal prospects and a stable exchange rate. Rising exports will \nbe partly offset by faster import growth driven by rising global oil \nprices, strengthening domestic consumption, and higher imports \nof intermediate inputs for export-orientated manufacturing. \nStrong FDI and portfolio in\ufb02ows should bolster the capital \naccount balance and further strengthen the balance of\u00a0payments. \nMonetary policy needs to strike a balance between supporting \n\neconomic growth and managing in\ufb02ation. Credit growth is \nprojected to remain high, as in 2017, aided by interest rate cuts \nlate last year. Lending\u00a0interest rates may rise if in\ufb02ation edges \ntoward 4.0%. \n\nOn the \ufb01scal front, the government has set a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \ntarget for 2018 equal to 3.7% of GDP, seeking to encourage capital \ninvestment to support growth while consolidating \ufb01nances to \nsustain macroeconomic stability. The budget for 2018 emphasizes \ncapital expenditure by increasing its share of total spending to \n26.0% in 2018, up from a low of 21.0% in 2016. \n\nVulnerability in the \ufb01nancial sector to unresolved NPLs and \n\nundercapitalized banks poses a domestic risk to the outlook, \nas does unexpectedly rapid credit growth, though a resolution \nnewly passed by the National Assembly and revision to the Law \non Credit Institutions should remove some legal impediments to \neffective NPL resolution and bank restructuring. Meanwhile, any \nrise in trade protectionism, such as through the prospect of higher \nUS tariffs on steel and aluminum, would hit Viet Nam hard. \nSigni\ufb01cant reliance on the Republic of Korea for FDI and trade \nexposes Viet Nam to possible risks from geopolitical tensions. \nHeightened global \ufb01nancial volatility or disruption of capital \ufb02ows \nwould have signi\ufb01cant spillover into the domestic market.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014closing the skills gap \nViet Nam has an abundance of efficient labor working for \nrelatively low wages. This attracts large FDI in\ufb02ows especially \nfor labor-intensive export-oriented manufacturing. Since 2012, \nmanufacturing has absorbed on average 400,000 workers \nper\u00a0year (Figure 3.31.10).\n\nHowever, a skills gap is emerging as an obstacle to FDI \n\nabsorption and to business more generally. In its Global \nCompetitiveness Report 2017\u20132018, the World Economic Forum \ncited an \u201cinadequately educated workforce\u201d as the second-\nbiggest constraint on doing business in Viet\u00a0Nam (Figure\u00a03.31.11). \nSimilarly, a World Bank survey of employers found that \ufb01lling \nvacancies for jobs that require higher skills was a major \nchallenge\u00a0for most \ufb01rms, with 70%\u201380% of managerial and \ntechnical applicants reported as being underquali\ufb01ed. \n\n% of GDP\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThousand\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n3.31.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n7.1\n\n3.7\n\n2.5\n\n6.8\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.31.9\u2002Current account balance\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.31.10\u2002Employment by sector\n\nServices\nIndustry and construction\nAgriculture, \ufb01shery, and forestry\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: 2016 data is preliminary.\nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f290(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nTo address these skills gaps, Viet Nam needs to prioritize \nthree sets of initiatives toward strengthening its universities \nand its technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nsystem: expanding access, improving quality, and streamlining \ngovernance. \n\nExpanding access is key. Viet Nam\u2019s labor force is growing \n\nrapidly. From 38 million in 2000, it is projected to reach \n56\u00a0million by 2020. Despite signi\ufb01cant increases in funding, \nthe current supply of places offered in TVET institutions is \ninadequate to meet the needs of this workforce. Currently, just \n20% of workers nationwide hold formal university or vocational \nquali\ufb01cations (Figure 3.31.12).\n\nSecond is the need to improve quality. The Programme for \n\nInternational Student Assessment has found that secondary \nschool\u00a0students in Viet Nam substantially outperform their \npeers in Southeast\u00a0Asia, including those in much richer \ncountries such\u00a0as\u00a0Thailand and Malaysia, in some tasks. \nHowever, more progress is needed in developing the capacity \nof higher-education students for critical thinking, problem \nsolving, and people-management skills in real\u00a0world settings. \nRe\ufb02ecting this, Viet\u00a0Nam\u2019s ranking for the perceived quality \nof its higher education\u00a0systems in the Global Competitiveness \nReport 2017\u20132018 slipped by one spot to 84 out of nearly 140 \ncountries surveyed. Meanwhile, Viet Nam ranked only 120 for \nthe quality of its management schools, its lowest ranking across \nall index subcomponents. These results reveal an urgent need \nto match curriculums better with industry needs. Although \nreform has brought some progress in recent years, public \nuniversities and some TVET institutions are still hampered by \ninsufficient autonomy and outdated curriculums, while private \nuniversities are restricted from expanding their enrollment. \nAll\u00a0in all, a stronger and more consistent partnership between \nthe\u00a0government and the private sector is needed to upgrade \nhigher education toward international benchmarks and prepare \nstudents for future workplaces.\n\nFinally, there is a need to streamline university and \nTVET governance. Effective management is complicated by \nfragmentation of responsibility among the 13 line ministries \nand 63\u00a0provincial governments that administer some 2,000 \ninstitutions. While\u00a0accreditation has been compulsary for \nall institutions since 2005, enforcing common standards has \nbeen difficult in practice. Fragmentation has likewise made it \ndifficult to develop coordinated strategies toward achieving \nnational policy targets or to adopt jointly agreed standards and \nresponsibilities among training providers.\n\nAs changes in education and training can take a generation \n\nto\u00a0yield results, the time to modernize university and TVET \nsystems is now. This will ensure that inadequate worker skills \ndo not become a bottleneck constraining the country\u2019s future \ngrowth and development.\n\n3.31.11\u2002 Doing business:  \n\nMost problematic factors\n\nLimited access to \ufb01nance\n\nInadequately\neducated workforce\n\nCorruption\n\nPoor work ethic\nin national labor force\n\nTax regulations\n\nPolicy instability\n\nInadequate supply\nof infrastructure\n\nTax rates\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nInefficient government\n bureaucracy\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nScore\n\nNote: From a list of factors, respondents to the survey \nwere asked to select and rank the \ufb01ve most problematic \nfactors for doing business in their country. \nSources: Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018; \nInternational Monetary Fund. 2017.

These initiatives contributed to growth \nin construction during the year. Despite rainfall below average, \nsugarcane production increased by 18.2% from the 2016 harvest \n(Figure 3.32.2).\n\nTourism continued to be an important driver of growth, \n\nwith visitor arrivals setting yet another record.

The improved \ufb01scal position \nwas assisted by lower capital expenditure than expected \nbecause of delays affecting reconstruction. At the end of \nJuly\u00a02017, public debt equaled 46.7% of GDP, of which about \none-third was foreign debt.\n\nMonetary policy remained accommodative as the \n\npolicy interest rate stayed at 0.5% throughout 2017, keeping \ncommercial interest rates historically low. Liquidity improved \nsigni\ufb01cantly, largely from increased foreign reserves. Broad \nmoney increased by 6.1% during the year. Average rates for \ntime deposits of more than 24 months \ufb01rmed to 3.21%, or \n26 basis points higher than in 2016. However, the weighted \naverage commercial bank lending rate fell from 5.80% to \n5.66%. Private\u00a0sector credit increased\u2014albeit more slowly than \nin 2016\u2014by 11.6% to the equivalent of 71.7% of GDP. Lending \nfor investment grew by 25.0% during the year with increased \nlending to real estate and for building and construction. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is estimated at the equivalent \nof 5.2% of GDP in 2017, marginally higher than in the previous \nyear. Higher\u00a0imports of mineral fuels and miscellaneous \nmanufactured goods offset higher exports, mainly of sugar, \nmolasses, and mineral water. Foreign\u00a0currency reserves stood \nat $1.11 billion at the end of the year, sufficient to cover 5.5 \nmonths of retained imports of goods and nonfactor\u00a0services.\n\nEconomic prospects\nWith cyclone reconstruction tailing off, growth is projected to \ndecelerate to 3.6% in 2018. All sectors are expected to grow, \nhowever, with major contributions from public administration, \nwholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, agriculture, \naccommodation and food services, and construction. \nHigh\u00a0investment lending in 2017 and a number of ongoing \ntourism investments suggest that the private sector will \ngenerate higher tourism numbers. Growth at 3.3% in 2019 will \nbe well distributed, with tourism, agriculture, and construction \nexpected to be the major contributors.\n\nThe government has announced several infrastructure \ndevelopments over the next 2 years. While capital expenditure \nwill likely continue to be constrained by limited implementation \ncapacity in government agencies, public infrastructure \ninvestments are expected to facilitate additional private \nconstruction able to support growth over the next couple \nof years. The government aims to improve implementation \ncapacity through a number of reform initiatives and \npartnerships with the private sector.\n\n3.32.3\u2002Visitor arrivals\n\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia\nPaci\ufb01c islands\nOthers\n\nThousands\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: Fiji Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.32.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\u20023.6\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20135.0\n\n\u20023.3\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20134.8\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.32.4\u2002Inflation\n\n% \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\nForecast\n\nNote: In\ufb02ation in 2011 is in reference to 2005 prices, and \nfrom 2012 to 2016 in reference to 2011.\nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nFiji\u2002\u2002295\n\nTourism is on track for another record year, with bene\ufb01ts \n\n3.32.5\u2002Fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\nfrom new direct \ufb02ights to Japan and increased \ufb02ights to \nSingapore and San\u00a0Francisco.

Most recently, Cyclone Winston hit Fiji in 2016, \ncausing extensive property and infrastructure damage and lost \nproduction, particularly in agriculture. Economic growth fell \nin 2016 to 0.4% from 3.8% in the previous year.\n\nFiji\u2019s susceptibility to such events is exacerbated by \n\nclimate change, which is foreseen to have severe effects on the \neconomy by undermining agriculture and tourism, causing \nextensive damage to infrastructure, and worsening poverty and \nhardship, particularly for the majority of the population who \nlive in risk-prone coastal areas.\n\nA major challenge therefore facing Fiji is to build urban \n\ninfrastructure that can stand up to climate change while \nconserving the environment. Mainstreaming climate resilience \nin public investment decisions will increase costs and \ufb01nancing \nrequirements. The government needs to carefully consider the \n\ufb01scal risks associated with disasters, and to weigh the costs \nof \ufb01nancing before versus after a disaster strikes. While it has \nincreased spending on resilient infrastructure, the government \nhas simultaneously maintained \ufb01scal policies that ensure \nmacroeconomic stability. A cost-effective strategy of sovereign \nrisk \ufb01nancing will need to be developed to achieve an optimal \nlayering of disaster risk, including coverage for small and \nrecurrent losses, contingent credit, and \ufb01nancial instruments \nsuch as reinsurance and catastrophe \ufb01nancing for the high \ncosts imposed by disasters. Private sector \ufb01nancing may need \nto be actively promoted to supplement public sector efforts. \n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nGrowth  remained  soft  in  2017  as  foreign  exchange  shortages  and  fiscal  difficulties \ncontinued  to  pose  challenges.  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  meetings  will  provide \neconomic  stimulus  in  2018,  but  a  recent  earthquake  will  weigh  on  hydrocarbon  exports. \nIf\u00a0 fiscal  balance  could  be  achieved  without  reliance  on  volatile  resource  income, \ngovernment  finances  would  be  secure  when  prices  were  low,  and  savings  when  prices \nwere  favorable  could  be  channeled  into  a  sovereign  wealth  fund. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth in 2017 is estimated at 2.2%, a slight increase from \n2016 but below the 5.4% average realized over the past decade \n(Figure 3.33.1). Soft international commodity prices have \ncaused large shortfalls in government revenues in recent years, \nushering in a period of low growth and \ufb01scal consolidation. \nMining, which provides about 10% of GDP in Papua New \nGuinea (PNG), is estimated to have contributed more than \nhalf of GDP growth in 2017. Preliminary data indicate that the \nsector expanded by 13.6% during the year. The country\u2019s three \nlargest mines, Lihir, Ok Tedi, and Porgera, which together \nprovide more than three-quarters of mining revenue, all saw \noutput expand. Ok Tedi returned to full-year production in \n2017, and Lihir increased output by improving operational \nefficiency. There were also increased production and sales from \nRamu NiCo, the country\u2019s fourth largest mine, so named for \nits nickel and cobalt. Gold remains the most important metal \nexport by value, contributing over three-quarters of PNG metal \nrevenue, followed by copper at 12%.\n\nOil and gas, the second-largest component of GDP at 16%, \nbene\ufb01ted from higher prices in 2017. However, oil production \ndeclined as oil \ufb01elds aged, while gas production was steady.\nThe agriculture, forestry, and \ufb01sheries sector, which \n\nprovides about 18% of GDP, grew by an estimated 2.6% in 2017, \ndown from 3.4% in 2016. This sector, which employs some \n85% of people living in rural areas, includes agriculture for \ndomestic supply, commercial agriculture for export, and forest \nand marine production for export. The contribution to GDP \nfrom coffee, cocoa, and timber shrank in 2017, partly because of \nweaker prices, while the contribution from palm oil was higher \non modest price and production increases. \n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n% \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Edward Faber of the Papua New Guinea Resident Mission, \nADB, Port Moresby.\n\n3.33.1\u2002Economic growth\n\nMineral GDP\nNon-mineral GDP\n\nGDP growth\n\nK billion\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nSources: Papua New Guinea national budget documents, \nvarious years; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.33.2\u2002Inflation\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Bank of Papua New Guinea Quarterly \nStatistical\u00a0Tables.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002297\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption remained \nconstrained by difficulties in accessing foreign exchange and \nthe resulting damage to business con\ufb01dence, with wholesale \nand retail trade and the transport and storage industries both \nestimated to have expanded by only 2.0% in 2017. On the other \nhand, sustained public investment was largely responsible for \nwater supply and waste management growth by 5.5%, and \nelectricity and gas growth by 4.0%. In addition, boosts came \nfrom government spending related to elections in mid-2017 \nand preparations for the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation \n(APEC) meetings to be held in 2018.\n\nIn\ufb02ation eased to 4.7% in 2017 from 6.7% in 2016 as \nprices for some seasonal produce such as betel nut, fruit, and \nvegetables moderated after spiking because of the drought in \n2016 (Figure 3.33.2). A stable exchange rate for the PNG kina \nagainst the US dollar during the year limited any pass-through \nof imported in\ufb02ation. In 2017, in\ufb02ation was once again highest, \nat 11.5%, for alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and betel nut, but this \nwas down from 26.1% in 2016. Health-care costs came next, \nwith in\ufb02ation accelerating to 10.4% in 2017 from 8.0% in 2016. \nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit was estimated to equal 2.5% of GDP \n\nin\u00a02017, compared with a de\ufb01cit of 4.6% in 2016 (Figure 3.33.3). \nThis re\ufb02ected a 5.3% reduction in expenditure over the year \nagainst an increase in revenue by 4.7%. The ratio of debt to \nGDP in 2017 stood at the equivalent of 32.1% of GDP, slightly \nlower than the 32.6% recorded in\u00a02016 and within the revised \n35.0% legislated limit.\n\nThe Bank of Papua New Guinea, the central bank, \nmaintained its neutral monetary policy during 2017, leaving \nits main policy rate, called the kina facility rate, unchanged at \n6.25% throughout the year. However, excess liquidity in the \nbanking system renders monetary policy largely ineffective. \nBroad money supply declined by an estimated 0.9% in 2017 as \ncredit to the private sector faltered. \n\nThe foreign exchange rate remained stable throughout \n2017, at around K3.18 to the US dollar. The central bank tries to \nmanage foreign exchange imbalances by selectively intervening \nin currency markets. A foreign exchange trading band \ndetermines the speed of PNG kina depreciation. \n\nThe current account recorded a large surplus in 2017 equal \n\nto 13.9% of GDP. However, the surplus did not translate into \nhigher foreign exchange reserves as they were matched by a \nde\ufb01cit in the \ufb01nancial account caused by debt repayment on \na large lique\ufb01ed natural gas project and the use of offshore \nforeign currency accounts by mining \ufb01rms and oil and gas \ncompanies (Figure 3.33.4).

Most sectors are expected to expand, with the APEC \nmeetings providing an additional boost in 2018. However, a \nrecent earthquake will hold back growth in oil and gas in 2018. \nContinued difficulty in accessing foreign currency and \ufb01scal \nconstraints will also limit growth. \n\nMining is expected to grow moderately during the forecast \nperiod, though growth may be tempered by recent earthquake \ndamage to the Porgera mine. The country\u2019s largest mines are \nnot expected to expand production signi\ufb01cantly, but growth \nis expected at the Ramu NiCo mine and some smaller mining \noperations. Improved metal prices will translate into higher \ngrowth. Oil and gas are expected to contract in 2018 as oil \nproduction declines and the recent earthquake forces some oil \nand gas operations to suspend activity for an undetermined \nperiod. A rebound could follow as early as the latter part of \n2018, however, with a return to full production. \n\nThe agriculture, forestry, and \ufb01shery sector is projected to \ngrow by about 3% in 2018 and 2019 as output increases for all \nmajor crops. Coffee production is expected to rebound in 2018 \nwith favorable growing conditions, cocoa production is seen \nto increase as the area under cultivation expands, copra and \ncopra oil are expected to continue to bene\ufb01t from heightened \ninternational demand in recent years, and palm oil production, \nwhich accounts for some 45% of agricultural exports, should \ngrow modestly. Agricultural production for the domestic \nmarket will expand as well in line with a growing economy, \nan\u00a0expanding population, and investment in the sector. \n\nOn the demand side, the APEC meetings in 2018 will \nboost consumption of goods and services. Several meetings \nwill be held during the year, culminating in the main event in \nNovember. The PNG Treasury expects APEC-related growth \nat 6.5% in administration and support services, 6.2% in \ntransport and storage, 5.3% in hotels and restaurants, and 5.2% \nin information and communication technology. Construction \non government infrastructure projects, such as renovation \nof the Highlands Highway, will contribute to growth, as will \nearthquake relief and reconstruction. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to accelerate to 5.0% in 2018. Pass-\nthrough from higher oil prices will exert upward pressure, \nas will recent hikes in excise taxes on fuel and higher import \ntariffs under the 2018 budget. For example, diesel prices are \nexpected to rise by 5.8% with new excise taxes. Demand \nrelated to the APEC meetings is expected to exert additional \npressure on prices. Further, potential exists for currency \ndepreciation and resulting imported in\ufb02ation. In 2019, in\ufb02ation \nis expected to ease to 4.5% as the APEC effect dissipates and \ngrowth remains relatively soft. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002299\n\nTo \ufb01nance the de\ufb01cit, the government is looking to external \n\n3.33.5\u2002Resource revenue\n\nShare in gross \ndomestic product\n\nShare in\ntotal revenue\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2005\n\n2009\n\n2013\n\n2017 2019\nBudget\n\nSources: National budget documents, various years; \nnational \ufb01nal budget outcome reports, various years; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nUnder its \ufb01scal consolidation strategy, the government is \n\ntargeting de\ufb01cits equal to 2.5% of GDP in 2018 and 2.2% in \n2019. While budget expenditure is forecast to increase by 14.7% \nin 2018, partly to pay for APEC preparations, the government \nintends to counter it with a 16.0% increase in revenue. \nAccording to budget projections, over half of increased revenue \nis expected to be higher dividends from state-owned enterprises \nand one-off balance transfers from state authorities such\u00a0as the \nNational Fisheries Authority, which are reported to hold large \nidle cash balances. A further portion is expected to come from \nimproved revenue collection, as well as higher tax collection \nresulting from APEC activity. Achieving the de\ufb01cit target is \nlikely to be a challenge, raising the prospect of midyear budget \nrevisions, as have occurred in recent years. An additional weight \non the budget will be government expenditure on relief and \nreconstruction following the recent earthquake.\n\n\ufb01nancing from multilateral organizations and international \nmarkets, and it is considering a sovereign bond issue. \nDevelopment partner transactions in the pipeline worth about \n$600 million are likely to bring funds to PNG in the forecast \nperiod. However, additional foreign currency borrowing \ncomes with elevated risk should the currency depreciate. \nFinancing from domestic sources, which accounts for 72.8% of \ngovernment debt, has become increasingly tight as some foreign \nbanks operating in PNG have hit ceilings for such investment. \nThe\u00a0central bank has therefore ended up purchasing \ngovernment securities on occasion that the market declined to \ntake up. It has, however, succeeded in selling on almost half of \nits securities purchases under a new program that allows the \ngeneral public to invest directly in government securities.\n\nThe current account is forecast to sustain a surplus equal \nto 13.4% of GDP in 2018 and 13.8% in 2019, largely from higher \nexports of lique\ufb01ed natural gas. However, foreign exchange \nreserves will not improve commensurately as a signi\ufb01cant \nportion of foreign exchange proceeds from mining and gas \ncompanies will not be remitted to PNG.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014\ufb01scal consolidation \nPNG ran a broadly balanced budget in the 10 years to 2012. \nDuring that time, the economy grew strongly and the ratio \nof debt to GDP declined from 71.0% to 16.3%, leaving PNG \n\ufb01nances in a strong position. However, at the end of 2012, \ncommodity prices began to fall, in\ufb02icting a signi\ufb01cant shock \nto the PNG economy and undermining government revenue. \nNotably, resource revenue from mining and petroleum taxes \nand dividends were hit, falling from more than a quarter \nof total revenue during the boom years to under 5% in 2016 \nand\u00a02017 (Figure\u00a03.33.5). Increased revenue was matched by \n\n\f300(cid:144)(cid:144)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\ngreater expenditure with large increases in wages, public office \nrentals, health-care and education subsidies, and debt-service \ncosts. These trends brought \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits equal to 6.9% of GDP \nin 2013, 6.3% in 2014, 4.5% in 2015, and 4.6% in 2016. Financing \nthese de\ufb01cits became a challenge.\n\nIn mid-2017, PNG appeared to be on a path to another \nlarge de\ufb01cit, initially expected to equal 3.8% of GDP. However, \nthe outcome was better, estimated at 2.5%, because a new \ngovernment that assumed office in August 2017 took tough \naction to reduce expenditure in the 2017 supplementary \nbudget, mostly by cutting capital expenditure programs at the \nprovincial and district level.\n\nThis was followed by the release in November 2017 of the \nnew Medium Term Fiscal Strategy, 2018\u20132022, which aims to \nkeep the de\ufb01cit below 2.5% of GDP in 2018 and scale it back to \n1.0% by 2022. The strategy incorporates medium-term revenue, \nexpenditure, and debt strategies.\n\nUnder the Medium Term Revenue Strategy, the government \n\nhas developed a plan to improve tax compliance, collection, \nand administration. This includes enhancing information \ntechnology systems in the Inland Revenue Commission, \nestablishing a dedicated office to handle large taxpayers, \nand drafting a new law to simplify and modernize tax \nadministration. The strategy proposes to broaden the tax \nbase and review revenue collection from mines, which have \ntraditionally bene\ufb01ted from concessions.\n\nUnder the expenditure strategy, the government will tackle \n\nthe burgeoning public wage bill (Figure 3.33.6). Its aim is to \nlimit wage bill growth to no more than 5% annually and reduce \nthe wage bill from the current 49% of revenue (excluding \nresource and grant proceeds) to less than 40% by 2022. Finally, \nthe debt strategy seeks to roll total government debt back \nbelow 30% of GDP by 2022 from the current 32% and to reduce \nthe government\u2019s reliance on the domestic Treasury bill market \nby tapping external sources (Figure 3.33.7).\n\nCommitting to the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy and its \npath toward \ufb01scal consolidation is essential. It will also be a \nchallenge.

Over\u00a0the \nmedium term, the \ufb01scal strategy targets an NRPB of zero, \nmeaning a balanced budget before interest costs and without \nconsidering resource revenue. This would allow resource \nrevenue to \ufb02ow into savings, ideally into a sovereign wealth \nfund. If resource revenue picks up signi\ufb01cantly, the ratio could \nbe adjusted to, for example, a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.0% of GDP. \nAn NRPB would be useful because it would \ufb01x government \nbudgeting to the relatively stable segment of the economy \noutside of the resource sector. However, the real test for PNG \nwill be committing to these rules as production and prices \npick\u00a0up over the medium term. \n\n\fSolomon Islands\n\nCash  crops,  fishing  revenue,  and  construction  remained  strong  in  2017,  but  economic  growth \nnevertheless  slowed  as  logging  exports  declined.  Inflation  decelerated  on  lower  food  prices,  and \nthe  current  account  deficit  almost  halved.  Slower  growth  is  expected  in  2018  and  2019  as  new \nconstruction only partly offsets a likely further decline in logging output. Progress is being made in \nimplementing  a  much-needed  national  transport  plan,  but  challenges  remain.\n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth slowed to 3.2% in 2017 (Figure 3.34.1). \nLog\u00a0output decreased by almost 2% in 2017 to 2.65 million \ncubic meters from a high of 2.69 million cubic meters in 2016 \n(Figure 3.34.2). Meanwhile, the output of other major primary \nproducts increased, copra by 35% and \ufb01sh by 15%. Mining and \ntourism also expanded signi\ufb01cantly, albeit from low\u00a0bases.\n\nIndustry grew strongly, driven by construction to upgrade \n\nKukum Highway and the Mataniko Bridge. Manufacturing \ncontributed to growth as well with \ufb01sh processing in particular \ncontinuing to expand as in recent years. \n\nThe government maintained an expansionary budget \nin\u00a02017 with a budget de\ufb01cit estimated to equal 4.0% of GDP. \nRevenue collection rose but fell short of the government target. \nMeanwhile, government spending expanded by an estimated \n4.8%, which included a signi\ufb01cant increase for international \nscholarships for tertiary education. Government cash reserves, \nheld at the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, have declined \nsigni\ufb01cantly to less than 1 month of recurrent spending, \nundermining their usefulness as a \ufb01scal buffer. A weakened \n\ufb01scal position prompted the government to delay payment to \ncontractors and service providers, worsening domestic arrears. \nIn\ufb02ation decelerated in 2017 (Figure 3.34.3). Although fuel \n\nprices rose, prices were lower for imported and domestically \nproduced food, which accounts for 42.9% of the consumer \nprice index. The central bank maintained its accommodative \nmonetary stance and left the cash reserve requirement on \nbanks at 7.5%. Despite sufficient liquidity, growth in credit to \nthe private sector has slowed in recent years.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit almost halved in 2017 from \nthe equivalent of 4.9% of GDP in 2016 to 2.5%, re\ufb02ecting low \ninternational food prices, strong exports, and continued in\ufb02ows \n\nThis chapter was written by Jacqueline Connell of the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and \nCoordination Office, ADB, Sydney, and by Prince Cruz, consultant, Paci\ufb01c \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.34.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2.8\n\n1.8\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n2.6\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance and Treasury; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.34.2\u2002Logging output\n\nVolume\n\nLog price\n\nMillion cubic meters\n\n$/cubic meter\n\n3.00\n\n2.25\n\n1.50\n\n0.75\n\n0.00\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSolomon Islands\u2002\u2002303\n\nof grants from development partners. Merchandise exports \ngrew by an estimated 12.0% in 2017, up from fractional 0.6% \ngrowth in 2016. After several years of rising log output, the \nproduction reversal in 2017 and lower prices saw log exports \ndrop by an estimated 5.5% in 2017 from 2016. Conversely, \nfollowing several years of contraction, mineral exports \nrose with the resumption of production and exports from \nbauxite mines (Figure\u00a03.34.4). Service exports grew by 19.1%, \nlargely re\ufb02ecting higher tourism as cruise ships arrived on a \nregular basis and air arrivals increased by more than 10.0% \n(Figure\u00a03.34.5). The 75th anniversary in 2017 of the Guadalcanal \nlanding in World War II attracted increased tourist visits from \nthe US. Merchandise imports rose by an estimated 12.1% in 2017 \nowing to higher machinery and fuel imports.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is projected to moderate in 2018 and 2019. A decline \nin log output is expected to be partly offset by greater \noutput of nickel and bauxite and by construction associated \nwith the planned rehabilitation of the Gold Ridge gold \nmine. Supported\u00a0by development partners, the Tina River \nHydropower Development Project and undersea cable project \nare expected to contribute to growth starting in 2019. A delay \nto their implementation would pose a risk to the outlook. \nOther risks would be delays to the planned upgrade of several \nairports, which could constrain tourism growth. \n\nThe government operated on a recurrent budget in the \n\ufb01rst quarter of 2018, following a change in administration in \nNovember 2017. There can be no new capital expenditure until \nthe 2018 budget is passed, which is expected in April. The \ngovernment is likely to face spending pressures in the approach \nto elections in early 2019. On top of these pressures, payment \nof domestic arrears accrued in 2017 will likely keep the \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit at about 4% of GDP in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 3.34.6). \nIn\ufb02ation is expected to pick up in 2018 and 2019 as \ninternational commodity prices rise. The current account \nde\ufb01cit will likely narrow in 2018 before widening again \nin\u00a02019 with rising imports to support large infrastructure \nprojects (Figure 3.34.7). Rising prices for oil, which accounts \nfor approximately 20% of imports, could similarly cause the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit to widen in 2019.\n\nLogs and timber, which declined as a share of exports from \nan estimated 72% in 2016 to 63% in 2017, will likely experience \nfurther gradual declines. In recent years, production has \nroutinely surprised on the upside, but its eventual decline \nseems inevitable because output has long been far from \nsustainable. A risk to the outlook is an unexpectedly rapid \ncollapse of the logging industry, which could be triggered by \nenvironmental or government pressures. \n\n3.34.3\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nDomestic\nImported\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.34.4\u2002Mineral exports\n\nSI$ million\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.34.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20132.1\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20132.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.34.5\u2002Visitor arrivals by mode of travel\n\nAir\nCruise ship\n\nThousand visitors \n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nEstimate\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f304(cid:141)(cid:141)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nAnother risk to the outlook is a signi\ufb01cant slowdown in the \n\n3.34.6\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, which has become the key export \nmarket for commodities from the Solomon Islands.

Some 60% of the population lives on islands other \nthan the main island of Guadalcanal and relies on a limited \nnetwork of sea and air transport links. Most wharves and \ndomestic air\ufb01elds on the outer islands need rehabilitation. \nThese transport difficulties constrain tourism, limit access to \nbasic services, and restrict economic growth. \n\nA signi\ufb01cant challenge for Solomon Islands is to improve \nits transport infrastructure in line with its limited resources. \nProviding recurrent budgets for maintenance is important as \nwell because inadequate maintenance can accelerate wear and \ntear on transport assets, lengthen journey times, and cause \naccidents.\n\nIn 2016, the government updated its strategy with the \nNational Transport Plan, 2017\u20132036 and affirmed the role \nof the National Transport Fund as the key mechanism for \nmaintaining transport infrastructure with support from \ndevelopment partners. The plan identi\ufb01es transport priorities, \nmaps the number of potential bene\ufb01ciaries for each project, \nand estimates project cost. As the total cost of priority projects \nis greater than the entire GDP for 2016, assistance from \ndevelopment partners is critical. The National Transport \nPlan provides a roadmap toward better coordination between \ngovernment agencies, the public, and development partners. \nRecognizing the country\u2019s dependence on maritime \ntransport, the government has supported shipping operators \ndirectly and indirectly through grants offered to members \nof Parliament. While little evidence is available yet on the \ndevelopment impact of shipping grants made to members of \nParliament, the practice raises broader questions on the social \nbene\ufb01ts and commercial viability of various transport options, \nespecially in remote areas. The limited resources available to \nthe government make it vital to align funding with transport \npriorities. Ensuring that accountability frameworks are in place \nis equally important to maximize the bene\ufb01ts of investments in \nSolomon Islands\u2019 transport infrastructure.\n\n\fTimor-Leste\n\nThe  economy  contracted  as  political  impasse  held  back  public  spending  and  private \ninvestment  slowed.  Prospects  hinge  on  decisive  results  in  this  year\u2019s  election  and  a \nrestoration  of  public  spending  to  complement  large  private  projects  in  the  near  term. \nRecent  developments  in  oil  and  gas  boost  the  outlook  over  the  longer  term.  Renewed \nemphasis on skills development and a more facilitating approach to labor migration would \ngive  young  people  better  access  to  employment.\n\nLower public spending in 2017 was linked to political \n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nEconomic performance \nSharply reduced public spending and a slowdown in private \ninvestment caused GDP excluding the large offshore \npetroleum sector (hereafter GDP) to contract by 2.0% in 2017 \n(Figure\u00a03.35.1).

However, the government\u2019s 5-year \nprogram and a proposal to increase the 2017 budget by 16.1% \nwere rejected by Parliament. \n\nThe slowdown in public capital investment reduced \n\ndemand for machinery and construction services.

However, production from the Bayu-Undan \noil \ufb01eld continued to decline, falling by 18% in 2017. Domestic \nrevenue was in line with budget forecasts. Petroleum Fund of \nTimor-Leste investments performed exceptionally well. Its bond \nand equity investments earned $301.0 million, equal to 17.9% \nof GDP, and generated a return on assets of 10.4%, the highest \nsince the fund was established in 2005. \n\nThe fund ended the year with a balance of $16.8 billion, \nor $13,500 per capita (Figure 3.35.4). Strong performance in \npetroleum taxes and Petroleum Fund investments was re\ufb02ected \nin the current account surplus, estimated to equal 0.8% of GDP, \nup from a de\ufb01cit of 30.7% in 2016 despite higher merchandise \nimports.

In the meantime, the \ngovernment is restricted to monthly appropriations of no \nmore than a twelfth of the annual budget for 2017. This \nso-called duodecimal regime does not automatically enable the \ngovernment to use the petroleum fund to cover expenditure, \nas the law stipulates that withdrawals from the fund can \nbe made only with approval from Parliament. Government \ncash holdings were estimated at $369.6 million at the end of \nDecember 2017. With\u00a0these reserves and domestic revenue, \nthe government should be able to sustain operations until the \nelections, but expenditure in the \ufb01rst half of 2018 will likely be \nsigni\ufb01cantly lower than in recent years. The government may \nseek parliamentary approval for petroleum fund withdrawals \nto ensure that execution of the duodecimal budget is not \nconstrained. \n\nto be offset by accelerated spending after a new government \nis formed. It will immediately be tasked with formulating a \nbudget for the remainder of 2018 and another for 2019 and may \nuse this opportunity to scale up spending. The private sector \nshould also provide a boost in 2018. The Tibar Bay port project \nsecured its environmental license in February 2018, with \nconstruction expected to begin in the second half of the year. \nTotal investment in the port is estimated at $278.3 million, \nequal to 16.7% of GDP. \n\nSeveral other large private investment projects are poised \n\nto move ahead in 2018 and 2019. Investors are preparing to \nbuild a $100 million hotel and apartment complex on the \noutskirts of Dili beginning in the second half of 2018. Other \nresort developments are being considered, and plans for a \n$200\u00a0million cement factory near Baucau may go ahead before \nthe end of 2019. However, as political stability and government \nsupport are essential for private investment, there are clear \nrisks that project timelines may slip. \n\nAgriculture is expected to pick up in 2018 with a large \nincrease in coffee production and improved prospects for \nmaize and paddy following good rains. Oil and gas exploration \nonshore, led by a state-owned enterprise, is set to continue \nin 2018 and 2019.

The undiscounted value of Timor-Leste\u2019s share \nof these revenues is estimated at between\u00a0$21 billion and \n$28\u00a0billion. Further, the treaty increases Timor-Leste\u2019s share \nof Bayu-Undan revenues from 90% to 100% and gives the \ncountry exclusive rights to any revenue from the development \nof the smaller Buffalo oil \ufb01eld. \n\nThe new treaty awaits rati\ufb01cation by both Australia and \nTimor-Leste. A number of conditions need to be met before \nGreater Sunrise can be developed, which may not happen until \nwell into the 2020s. For now, the treaty will likely reassure \npolicy makers about long-term \ufb01scal sustainability and may \naccelerate infrastructure development on the south coast. \nRising imports for public and private investments and a gradual \ndecline in production from Bayu-Undan will mean continued \ncurrent account de\ufb01cits, projected to equal 15.2% of GDP in \n2018 and 22.0% in 2019 (Figure 3.35.6).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014providing opportunities \nfor\u00a0young workers\nTimor-Leste struggles to employ a young and growing \npopulation. A\u00a0recent survey found that, while GDP grew by \n16.9% from 2012 to 2016, formal employment in the private \nsector fell by 5.4% in that period (Figure 3.35.7). Formal \nemployment in 2016 stood at only 58,200 jobs, or 7.7% of the \nworking-age population. Construction, which was the largest \nprivate employer, with 32% of the total, is highly dependent on \npublic expenditure. \n\nDeclining employment from 2012 to 2016 re\ufb02ected fewer \n\njobs in retail, wholesale, restaurants, and accommodation, \nthough the actual change may be less than surveyed as \nmicro enterprises are not included (Figure 3.35.8). An annual \nenterprise skills survey with wider coverage found slightly \nhigher employment in the private sector, up by 3.7% in the \ufb01rst \n10 months of 2017. In any case, the current pace of job creation \nis clearly far too low, with only 4,000 new jobs each year \n(Figure 3.35.9). \n\nSustained job creation will depend on the development \n\nof tradable sectors such as tourism, agribusiness, and \nmanufacturing.

Most Timorese are eligible for \nPortuguese citizenship, enabling them to work in the European \nUnion, including 16,000\u201319,000 in the United Kingdom and \nsmaller numbers in Portugal and other countries. Remittances \nfrom migrant workers, including more than $28 million from \nthe United Kingdom in 2017, are increasingly important to \nTimorese households. \n\nMore government support for labor mobility can help to \nexpand opportunities for Timorese workers. The government \nhas long-established programs with Australia and the Republic \nof Korea to facilitate labor migration, with 750 Timorese \ncurrently participating. Such government-to-government \nprograms could be expanded in the coming years with more \npartner governments and concerted efforts to identify suitable \nworkers. The government should also consider options for \nsupporting migration to the European Union. Gaps\u00a0in public \nrecords leave some Timorese struggling to prove that they are \nentitled to Portuguese citizenship. Others\u00a0struggle to meet the \ncost of migration to Europe or to prepare for the opportunities \navailable there.

With  several  large  infrastructure  projects  completed  last  year,  growth \nis  expected  to  moderate  in  2018  and  2019.  Vanuatu\u2019s  ambitious  infrastructure  pipeline  is \nsupporting  its  current  and  future  growth  prospects,  but  the  accompanying  rise  in  public  debt \nposes  challenges  for  fiscal  management.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth was steady in 2017, driven by construction and the \ncontinued recovery of agriculture and tourism from the impact \nof Cyclone Pam in 2015 (Figure 3.36.1). Tourism was buoyed \nby the 2017 Paci\ufb01c Mini Games, which took place in Port Vila, \nand the return of codeshare \ufb02ights operated by Qantas and \nAir\u00a0Vanuatu. Air arrivals increased by an estimated 12% in \n2017. In contrast, cruise ship arrivals fell by an estimated 11% \nfrom a record high in 2016 as several cruise ships cancelled \ntrips to the newly upgraded Luganville wharf due to initial \nuncertainty about its operability (Figure 3.36.2).\n\nAgriculture continued to recover from Cyclone Pam, \nwith sector growth estimated at 5% in 2017. Production of \nmajor\u00a0crops such as copra and kava exceeded pre-cyclone \nlevels, but recovery in livestock production, mainly of cattle, \nhas been slower. \n\n Industry continued to expand with construction completed \n\non international wharfs at Lapetasi and Luganville and tourist \ninfrastructure in Port Vila. Private investment in hotels and \nother tourism projects also drove construction. \n\n2.5% surplus in 2016. Despite capital expenditure remaining \nlargely unchanged from 2016\u2014and signi\ufb01cantly lower than \nthe budgeted \ufb01vefold increase\u2014total government spending \nincreased by an estimated 22% over the previous\u00a0year. \nA\u00a0large part of the increase covered overdue payments for \ncivil\u00a0servants, costs associated with the Paci\ufb01c Mini Games, \nand tertiary scholarships. \n\nIn\ufb02ation accelerated to an estimated 3.2% in 2017. \n\nThe\u00a0largest increase was for domestic food, followed by higher \ntransport costs because of higher global fuel prices in the \nsecond half of the year (Figure 3.36.3).

The services sector, which provides nearly two-thirds \nof GDP, is projected to continue to expand slightly on higher \ntourism and public administration. Growth in agriculture is \nexpected to stabilize. Construction is set to remain strong \nin 2018 as some delayed reconstruction gets under way, but \nit is expected to wind down in 2019 and contribute less to \ngrowth that year. The government hopes it can raise its tax \nrevenues with a value-added tax (VAT) rate rise from 12.5% \nto 15.0% effective in January 2018. It projects that higher \nVAT collections will supply the bulk of the 24.5% increase in \nbudgeted domestic revenues (i.e., excluding grants) in 2018. \nThe government also foresees its wages and salary bill to \nrise by 23.3% to implement the verdict of the Government \nRemuneration Tribunal, which ruled in favor of higher public \nservice wages. In addition, as the grace period on some loans \nexpires, interest payments are budgeted to increase from 4% of \npublic revenues in 2017 to 5% in 2018. Fiscal de\ufb01cits equal to \nabout 1.8% of GDP are expected in 2018 and 2019. \n\nDomestic in\ufb02ation is projected to pick up to 4.8% in 2018, \n\nfueled by the VAT rate increase and higher public service \nremuneration, which may induce demands for similar wage \nhikes in the private sector. In\u00a02019, in\ufb02ation is expected to ease \nto 2.5%, which would be above the average of 1.5% over the \npast decade but below the 4.0% target set by the Reserve Bank \nof Vanuatu. \n\nthanks to higher earnings from agriculture and tourism. \nWith\u00a0cruise ships already returning to the international wharf \nat Luganville, visitor arrivals are expected to increase in 2018. \nAirport upgrades in Port\u00a0Vila, Luganville, and Tanna are \nexpected to increase air arrivals, with new international routes \npossibly opening to Port Vila. Compared with arrivals on \ncruise ships, visitors by air contribute more to tourism earnings \nbecause they stay longer and consume more goods and services \nonshore. Meanwhile, the production of key agricultural \nproducts is expected to continue growing. The de\ufb01cit is \nprojected to increase slightly in 2019, however, because higher \ncommodity prices will likely drive imports higher.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is expected to narrow in 2018, \n\n3.36.4\u2002 Domestic revenues (excluding grants)\n\n% of GDP, average 2010\u20132015\n\nCook\nIslands\n\nSamoa\n\nFiji\n\nPalau\n\nVanuatu\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f312(cid:129)(cid:129)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nA downside risk to the outlook is delay in implementing the \nlarge public infrastructure project pipeline. Implementation of \ndevelopment projects that outpaced expectations, on the other \nhand, would likely boost growth in 2018 and widen the current \naccount de\ufb01cit because of the need for higher capital imports.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014\ufb01nancing growth\nThe Government of Vanuatu is implementing a large \ninfrastructure pipeline with a view to boosting productivity, \nparticularly in the key tourism and agriculture sectors. \nWhile\u00a0much of the infrastructure spending is expected to \nbe sourced from concessional loans and development grants, \npublic debt is increasing rapidly. \n\nRecognizing the need to expand its revenue to maintain \n\npublic investment and to service debt, the government has \nembarked on a revenue reform initiative. Vanuatu\u2019s domestic \nrevenue has been low relative to comparable Paci\ufb01c island \neconomies (Figure 3.36.4). \n\ntariffs, and from the sale of second citizenships to wealthy \ninvestors (Figure 3.36.5). The recent increase in the VAT \nrate will boost revenue, particularly from tourist spending. \nThe\u00a0government has resolved to introduce an income tax in the \nfuture, which would ease Vanuatu\u2019s reliance on more regressive \ntaxes like the VAT.\n\nThe government needs to balance expansion of its revenue \n\nbase with continued support for private sector growth. \nAs\u00a0it increases taxes on businesses, the government should \nensure that other costs of doing business are minimized. \nWhile\u00a0expanding its revenue base, the government needs to \nensure as well that its tax administration is properly resourced \nto deal with tax policy changes. Updating the \ufb01nancial \nmanagement information system, training staff to operate it, \nand enhancing human resource capacity in tax administration \nwould help to support the government\u2019s revenue reform \ninitiative.\n\nVanuatu raises most of its revenue through VAT and import \n\n3.36.5\u2002 Government revenue\n\nValue added tax\nOther taxes\nGrants\nOther revenues\n\nVt billion\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nSources: Reserve Bank of Vanuatu; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fNorth Paci\ufb01c economies\n\nGrowth  in  2017  followed  recent  trends,  with  infrastructure  investment  boosting  economic \nactivity  in  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  and  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia, \nwhile  a  tourism  downturn  persisted  in  Palau.  The  outlook  is  similarly  mixed  and  depends \non the same growth drivers. Improving education can equip a young labor force with better \nskills  to  fill  domestic  employment  gaps  and  raise  potential  growth  over  the  long  term. \n\nEconomic performance \nThe drivers of growth in three North Paci\ufb01c economies in \n\ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended 30 September 2017) have been \nthe same as in recent years (Figure 3.37.1). Infrastructure \ninvestment fueled faster expansion in the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) and the Federated States of Micronesia \n(FSM). In Palau, on the other hand, an ongoing tourism slump \ncaused slight economic contraction. \n\nIn the RMI, growth more than doubled to 4.0% on \nstimulus from public investments funded by development \npartners, including infrastructure grants under the Compact of \nFree\u00a0Association with the US. Among these were two saltwater \nreverse osmosis plants in Ebeye able to desalinate 1,600 cubic \nmeters per day. \n\nSimilarly, the FSM recovered from slight contraction to \n\n2.0% growth as public investments picked up moderately, \ndespite a temporary suspension of US grants because of \nconcern about project management. Under transitional \narrangements, the FSM government will engage the \nUS\u00a0Army Corps of Engineers to help manage and implement \nprojects. Previously approved projects\u2014including a Kosrae \nState\u00a0Hospital upgrade and the reconstruction of homes and \npublic\u00a0facilities damaged by Typhoon Maysak on Chuuk and \nYap\u2014were unaffected by the suspension and contributed to \ngrowth last year.\n\nA tourism downturn in Palau worsened, pushing the \neconomy into a contraction of 0.5% in FY2017. Meanwhile, \nrevised official estimates show growth in FY2016 much weaker \nthan previously estimated, highlighting the extent of the \ncurrent economic slowdown. Tourist arrivals fell by 22.8% in \nFY2017, compounding a 13.1% decline in FY2016 (Figure\u00a03.37.2). \n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\nThousands\n\n180\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n3.37.1\u2002 GDP growth in the  \n\nNorth Pacific economies\n\nMarshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nPalau\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and \nRepublic of Palau FY2016 Economic Reviews.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.2\u2002Visitor arrivals in Palau by source\n\nJapan\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nOthers\n\nThis chapter was written by Norio Usui, Rommel Rabanal, and Cara Tinio of \nthe Paci\ufb01c Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: Palau Bureau of Labor and Immigration.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f314\u2007\u2007Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nThis reflected the closure of Jellyfish Lake, a\u00a0major tourist \nattraction, but also appreciation of the US dollar, the local \ncurrency. A sharp fall in the number of tourists from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, by 26.8%, accounted for much of \nthe decline, but arrivals from traditional markets also fell, \nwith Japan down 22.4% and Taipei,China down 43.2%. Slow \nimplementation of projects funded by development partners \nworsened the downturn.\n\nInflationary pressures increased but remained modest in \nall three economies in FY2017, driven by higher fuel prices and \ntheir spillover effects on consumer goods such as clothing and \nprocessed food, most of which must be shipped from abroad. \nAll three economies saw inflation return following price \ndeclines in the previous year. \n\nFiscal positions have weakened across the North Pacific. \n\nPreliminary estimates suggest that the Government of the \nRMI incurred a fiscal deficit equal to 2.0% of GDP in FY2017, \nreversing a surplus of 4.0% the previous year. Expenditures \ngrew by 60.9%, far outpacing a 23.3% increase in revenues and \ngrants partly because they included a transfer of $3 million \nto the Marshall Islands Social Security Authority as part of \nreform to the Social Security Fund. \n\nFiscal performance varied considerably within the FSM, \n\nwith the national government running a large surplus and \nmost states recording small deficits. State governments are \nresponsible for major public services but have been constrained \nby declines in the real value of US compact grants, while the \nnational government has benefited from higher revenue from \nfishing license fees (Figure 3.37.3). In FY2017, the national \ngovernment recorded a fiscal surplus equal to 7.0% of GDP, \ndown from 7.4% in the previous year because of significantly \nhigher expenditures.\n\nPalau\u2019s fiscal surplus similarly narrowed to the equivalent \nof 4.0% of GDP, from 4.7% in FY2016, as the falloff in tourism \nsharply dragged down revenues. This contrasted with the \nprevious year, when tax revenues increased despite weak \ntourism because the downturn was concentrated in lower-\nspending market segments. \n\nCurrent account balances likewise suffered in all three \neconomies. In the RMI and the FSM, surpluses narrowed in \nFY2017 as imports of construction materials and fuel for public \ninvestments expanded. Fishing license revenues continued \nto increase in the RMI but appear to have reached a plateau \nin the FSM. Palau\u2019s current account is usually in deficit as \nlarge surpluses in secondary income such as remittances are \ninsufficient to offset shortfalls in the trade and primary income \nbalances.

However, limited capacity to implement projects and a \nlack of alternative domestic opportunities hamper the economy. \n\nGDP growth in the FSM is projected to remain stable. \nAlthough unspent compact infrastructure grants present an \nopportunity to reinvigorate the economy, public investments \nare projected to increase only gradually because of limited \nproject implementation capacity. \n\nThe Infrastructure Development Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2025 will \n\ncontinue to guide FSM capital spending priorities, especially \ninvestments to mitigate risks from disasters and climate \nchange. Although the plan was expected to facilitate the \nimplementation of projects funded through the US compact \nand by other development partners, recent project management \nissues have stalled progress. A sustainable solution to \ncapacity issues would help harness more than $150 million in \ninfrastructure grants that have been unspent since the start of \nthe amended compact in 2004. This would both stimulate the \neconomy in the near term and raise potential growth through \nlonger-term productivity enhancements. \n\nPalau is likely to return to steady, moderate growth in \nFY2018 and FY2019, supported by the commencement of \nprivate investment in new hotels and of public infrastructure \nprojects funded by development partners. Gradual recovery \nin tourist arrivals is foreseen, but there is a risk that numbers \ncould continue to fall because the People\u2019s Republic of China \nhas imposed restrictions on advertisements for group tours to \ndestinations not formally approved by the government.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to rise slightly in all three economies \n\nin FY2018 before leveling off in FY2019, re\ufb02ecting international \nfood and fuel price trends (Figure 3.37.4). Rising commodity \nprices in the import bill are expected to further narrow \nthe FSM current account surplus slightly. By contrast, the \ncurrent account positions of the RMI and Palau are expected \nto improve despite larger commodity import bills. Project \ncompletion in the RMI will slow capital equipment imports, \nand in Palau the expected recovery in visitor arrivals should \nboost tourism receipts. \n\nFiscal sustainability remains a major concern. The \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit for the RMI is expected to widen gradually in FY2018 \nand FY2019 because of delayed reform to state-owned \nenterprises and the social security system.

Following recent gains in expanding \naccess to schooling, the North Paci\ufb01c economies must now \nimprove the quality of basic education. A 2013 review observed \nthat students in the FSM and the RMI have difficulty achieving \nbasic literacy standards in either the local language or English, \nas well as numeracy. Many fail to \ufb01nish high school or else \ngraduate without job skills.\n\nStudent performance is low. In the FSM, results from \nnational standardized tests in 2012\u20132017 showed only 22.0% \nof sixth graders meeting minimum competency expectations \nin mathematics. In reading, the share was only 29.3% despite \nmarked improvement in this subject from earlier test results \n(Figure 3.37.6). The corresponding \ufb01gures in the RMI were \n19.7% in mathematics and 18.5% in reading, with little if any \nprogress over time. \n\nWeak education outcomes stem from a combination of \nfactors, most notably de\ufb01cient teacher quality. The minimum \nquali\ufb01cation for teaching\u2014a 2-year associate\u2019s degree\u2014has \nnot been completed by 17% of teachers in the FSM and 38% \nin the RMI. Professional learning opportunities are similarly \nde\ufb01cient. In Palau, a practice certi\ufb01cation test in\u00a02013 found \nteachers scoring particularly low in math, with writing \nand reading results only slightly better. Even so, Palau \noutperformed all other participants, including the RMI \nand the\u00a0FSM, in a Paci\ufb01c literacy and numeracy assessment \nundertaken in 2015.\n\nA project currently under way in the RMI and the FSM \naims to improve the quality of basic education by strengthening \nteacher preservice and in-service programs.

A young \npopulation in the North Paci\ufb01c offers a substantial labor \nforce that can be harnessed to maximize potential growth \n(Figure\u00a03.37.7). Quality basic education provides a stable \nfoundation for developing employment skills through, for \nexample, stronger technical and vocational education and \ntraining. This can facilitate skills matching to \ufb01ll domestic \nemployment gaps in key sectors such as tourism in Palau \nand agribusiness or \ufb01sheries in the RMI and the FSM. \nMore\u00a0broadly, sustained investment in human capital over \nthe longer term will help ease current capacity constraints \nthat limit the growth potential of these small and dispersed \neconomies.\n\n\fSouth Paci\ufb01c economies\n\nTourism  supported  moderate  growth  in  the  Cook  Islands,  Samoa,  and  Tonga  last  year. \nGrowth in Samoa also benefited from strong agriculture, commerce, and communications, \nand  in  Tonga  from  active  electricity,  construction,  and  mining  and  quarrying  industries. \nGrowth this year and next will likely moderate further with higher fuel costs and, in Tonga, \ndamage  from  Cyclone  Gita.  These  economies  need  to  mitigate  economic  and  climate \nshock  risks  to  sustain  economic  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth in the Cook Islands in \ufb01scal year 2017 (FY2017, ended \n30\u00a0June 2017 in all three South Paci\ufb01c economies) was 3.5%, \nsubstantially slower than in the previous year, though only \n\ufb01shing failed to expand (Figure\u00a03.38.1). Visitor arrivals to the \nCook Islands rose by 14.9% from all leading markets, with the \nmost additional visitors from New Zealand (Figure 3.38.2). \nThe increase in tourism contributed to growth in retail, hotels \nand restaurants, and transport and communications. Utilities \nexpanded by an estimated 24.2% with the implementation of \nwater supply, sanitation, and renewable energy projects on \nouter islands. \n\nSamoa also slowed considerably in FY2017, with declines \nin construction as large capital projects neared completion, \ncommunications, and \ufb01shing, which more than offset \nexpansion in commerce and agriculture. Hotel and restaurant \nbusiness grew modestly as visitor arrivals were maintained. \nTonga grew by an estimated 2.8% in FY2017, slower than \n\nin the previous year. Agriculture, construction, electricity, \nand mining and quarrying contributed to growth, but \n\ufb01nancial services declined. Growth has been supported by \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, a $30 million upgrade of the Faua \ndomestic wharf on the island of Nuku\u2019alofa, improved tourism, \nand continued recovery in remittances. \n\nIn the Cook Islands, prices declined in FY2017 by 0.1%, as \nin FY2016 (Figure 3.38.3). Despite increases in import prices, \nlower costs for air transportation, mortgages and rents, and \nalcohol prolonged de\ufb02ation. In Samoa, rising import prices, \nparticularly for fuel, and increased taxes on tobacco and \nalcohol accelerated in\ufb02ation to 1.4%. Average food prices were \nalso higher. In general, prices for locally produced goods \nand services declined while prices for imports increased. \n\nThis chapter was written by Shiu Raj Singh of the South Paci\ufb01c Subregional \nOffice, ADB, Suva; Cara Tinio and Laisiasa Tora of the Paci\ufb01c Department, \nADB, Manila; and Noel Del Castillo, consultant, Paci\ufb01c Department, ADB, \nManila. \n\n3.38.1\u2002GDP growth in the South Pacific\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\nThousand visitors\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n\u2013100\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; Tonga Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.38.2\u2002Visitor arrivals to the South Pacific\n\nTotal\n\n% change\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; National Reserve Bank of Tonga.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002319\n\nHigh growth in agriculture strengthened supply to the \nfood manufacturing industry and helped stabilize prices for \ndomestically produced food. In Tonga, prices increased by \n7.4% in FY2017, largely because of higher customs duties and \nexcise\u00a0taxes.\n\nThe Cook Islands regularly records current account \nsurpluses because high income from tourism offsets de\ufb01cits \nin merchandise trade and investment income. In FY2017, the \ncurrent account surplus was estimated to equal 25.5% of GDP, \nlittle changed from FY2016 (Figure 3.38.4). In Samoa, the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit narrowed signi\ufb01cantly to 3.0% of GDP \nfrom 5.8% in the previous year on lower imports of goods and \nservices, as well as increased service credits and remittances. \nIn Tonga, the current account de\ufb01cit equaled 12.2% of GDP in \nFY2017, which was slightly lower than in FY2016 as exports \ncontinued to grow. At the end of FY2017, Samoa\u2019s gross \ninternational reserves provided 3.6 months of import cover, and \nTonga\u2019s reserves 7.6 months.\n\nThe Cook Islands ran a \ufb01scal surplus equal to 7.3% of GDP \n\nin FY2017, up from 3.9% on higher collections of income and \nvalue-added taxes, and increased \ufb01sheries revenue and grants, \nas well as stable operating expenditures. Net public debt, all of \nit external, fell from the equivalent of 24.8% of GDP in FY2016 \nto 17.9% in FY2017, well below the government ceiling of 35.0%. \nThe government maintained a debt-service reserve equal to \n4.4% of GDP in FY2017.\n\nIn Samoa, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit widened in FY2017 to \nthe equivalent of 1.1% of GDP from 0.4% in the previous \nyear, but de\ufb01cit expansion was contained by rigorous \nexpenditure control in line with the government\u2019s emphasis \non consolidation, as well as higher tax and nontax revenue. \nAn\u00a0operating surplus equal to 1.5% of GDP was achieved after \n5\u00a0years of operating de\ufb01cits since FY2012. At the end of the \n\ufb01scal year, external debt equaled 47.7% of GDP, down from \n50.7% at the end of FY2016. \n\nTonga\u2019s \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit remained unchanged at 0.4% of GDP \n\nin FY2017 as higher tax revenue balanced higher operating \nexpenditure, including a steeper wage bill. Debt was estimated \nto equal 42.4% of GDP at the end of FY2017.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is set to moderate in all three South Paci\ufb01c economies \nover the forecast period. Expansion in the Cook Islands \nis projected to continue at 3.5% in FY2018. Signi\ufb01cant \ncontributions will come from tourism, and large projects to \nimprove water supply and sanitation, and internet connectivity. \nHowever, growth is projected to slow slightly in FY2019 as \nthese infrastructure projects reach completion. \n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n3.38.3\u2002Inflation\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; Tonga Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.38.4\u2002Current account balance\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement; Central Bank of Samoa; Tonga Ministry of \nFinance and National Planning.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f320(cid:143)(cid:143)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nIn Samoa, the forecast is for signi\ufb01cantly slower growth in \nFY2018 with expected declines in manufacturing, because an \noperation assembling automotive wire harnesses closed, and \ntransportation, because of higher fuel prices. Fishing is forecast \nto level off. Growth is seen to increase to 2.0% in FY2019, \nsupported by tourism and stronger communications following \nthe establishment of high-speed broadband links with Fiji. \nA\u00a0service depot for submarine cables now being established is \nexpected to boost employment and output.\n\nTropical Cyclone Gita struck Tonga in February 2018. \nIt\u00a0was among the most powerful cyclones in Tongan history \nand caused severe damage on the main island of Tongatapu \nand neighboring \u2018Eua to government buildings, homes, \nand infrastructure for basic services, including water \nsupply, sanitation and waste management, electricity, and \ncommunications. With agriculture, \ufb01shing, and tourism \naffected, the economy is now forecast to shrink by 0.3% \nin FY2018. However, as in other Paci\ufb01c island economies \nfollowing disasters, growth is expected to rebound on \nreconstruction and recovery in agriculture and tourism, in \nTonga\u2019s case to 1.9% in FY2019. The government\u2019s immediate \ncyclone response plan envisages funding at $20 million, or the \nequivalent of 4% of GDP.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to remain moderate in all three \neconomies to the forecast horizon, in line with international \nprice movements. Higher international oil prices will likely \npush in\ufb02ation in the Cook Islands to 0.5% in FY2018 and \n1.0% in FY2019 and in Samoa to 2.0% and then 3.0%. Supply \ndisruption in Tonga will drive in\ufb02ation to 3.8% in FY2018 \nbefore it subsides to 0.5% in FY2019. \n\nThe Cook Islands will likely return to \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits. \n\nA\u00a0budgeted de\ufb01cit equal to 8.7% of GDP in FY2018 stems \nlargely from ambitious investments in water supply, renewable \nenergy, and roads (Figure 3.38.5). In FY2019, the de\ufb01cit is \nexpected to shrink to 3.8%. Although a decline in capital \nexpenditure will be largely paralleled by reduced grants from \ndevelopment partners, tax collection is expected to improve. \nDespite projected \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits, economic growth and cash \nbalances on hand should keep public debt manageable. Debt is \nexpected to be no more than the equivalent of 28.1% of GDP in \nFY2018 and 25.0% in FY2019.\n\nSamoa\u2019s \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is budgeted to equal 3.5% of GDP \nin both \ufb01scal years. In the past 2 years, actual \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits \nhave turned out lower than budgeted because of stringent \nexpenditure control and diligent revenue collection. Higher \nde\ufb01cits than in recent years are projected because the \ngovernment will need to boost output through \ufb01scal stimulus \nfollowing contraction in \ufb01shing and nonfood manufacturing. \nIn Tonga, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is forecast to remain near \npre-cyclone levels as emergency response will be funded \n\n3.38.5\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement; Samoa Ministry of Finance; Tonga Ministry \nof Finance and National Planning.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.38.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nCook Islands\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nSamoa\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nTonga\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n\u20022018\n\n\u20022019\n\n\u2002\u20023.5\n\n\u2002\u20020.5\n\n\u200223.6\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u2002\u20021.0\n\n\u200221.7\n\n\u2002\u20020.5\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20134.3\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u2002\u20023.0\n\n\u2002\u20133.2\n\n\u2002\u20130.3\n\n\u2002\u20023.8\n\n\u201314.8\n\n\u2002\u20021.9\n\n\u2002\u20020.5\n\n\u201315.9\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002321\n\n3.38.6\u2002Tonga\u2019s public wage bill\n\nShare of domestic revenue\nShare of recurrent expenditure\n\nGrowth\n\n%\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Government of Tonga budget statements, \nvarious years; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nby grants. Primarily because the government has resolutely \navoided any new borrowing that was not concessional, \nTonga\u2019s external debt is expected to grow slowly, reaching the \nequivalent of 43.2% of GDP in FY2018 and 44.6% in FY2019. \n\nDebt sustainability analyses in 2017, which included climate \n\nrisk in their baseline assumptions, raised the risk of debt \ndistress from moderate to high for both Samoa and Tonga. \nFrom 2018, both economies are eligible only for grants from \nmultilateral development banks, not loans. \n\nThe Cook Islands is forecast to run current account \nsurpluses in FY2018 and FY2019. Increased tourism earnings \nwill likely offset higher imports of goods and services for public \ninvestment projects implemented in the next 2 years, but the \nsurplus will narrow in FY2019 because of increased imports. \nSamoa\u2019s current account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen again to \nthe equivalent of 4.3% of GDP in FY2018 and 3.2% in FY2019 \non higher merchandise trade de\ufb01cits. In Tonga, the current \naccount de\ufb01cit is expected to jump to the equivalent of 14.8% of \nGDP in FY2018 and 15.9% in FY2019 on higher imports of food \nand reconstruction materials.\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014ensuring economic \nresilience\nThe Cook Islands is set to become the \ufb01rst Paci\ufb01c island \nnation to reach developed status based on income per capita. \nAny resulting decrease in grant in\ufb02ows can be countered \nwith improved mobilization of domestic revenue. With few \nfeasible livelihood options, the country can only become \nmore dependent on tourism. It has bene\ufb01ted from tourism \nfor many years and taken steps to mitigate risks posed by \ndisasters: developing contingent \ufb01nancing options, reducing \ndebt when possible, and strengthening cash reserves. Ensuring \nthe sustainability of tourism requires, however, policy and \ninfrastructure development that is sensitive to the impact \nof tourism on the environment and local sociocultural \nframeworks. As in other tourism-dependent economies, \nthe Cook Islands may wish to target the higher end of the \nmarket to rationalize capacity expansion without sacri\ufb01cing \npotential\u00a0income.\n\nSamoa is highly vulnerable to disasters. This was \n\ndemonstrated in September 2009, when a tsunami wiped out \nlong stretches of the south and southeast coasts of the main \nisland of Upolu, killing 143 people, injuring 310, and otherwise \naffecting over 12,000. Then in 2012, Tropical Cyclone Evan \ndestroyed over 600 homes, killed 14 people, displaced more \nthan 7,500, and caused economic damage and production \nlosses estimated to exceed $210 million, or nearly a third of \nGDP. The government has responded with measures to make \n\n\f322(cid:143)(cid:143)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\ninfrastructure assets and coastal communities climate resilient. \nHowever, Samoa has yet to integrate climate resilience and \ndisaster risk management into its national development plans \nand policies. It will need to develop strategies to cope with \ndisasters, ensure climate proo\ufb01ng, establish appropriate \ninstitutions, and maintain sufficient reserves to \ufb01nance disaster \nresponse and recovery.\n\nTonga must restrain public wage expenditure. Government \n\nspending on salaries crowds out public investment and asset \nmaintenance, undermines the implementation of national \ndevelopment priorities, and worsens exposure to shocks, \nincluding debt distress. Government spending on salaries \nrose by 14.3% in FY2017. Recognizing the serious implications \nfor \ufb01scal and debt sustainability, the government approved a \nnew public service salary structure with a revised pay scale \nthat provides remuneration based on updated performance \nassessments. The structure is expected to save costs by ending \nautomatic salary progression. In addition, the FY2018 budget \ntargets a public wage bill not to exceed 53% of domestic \nrevenues or 45% of operating expenditure (Figure 3.38.6). \nThe government must sustain reform to establish the \ufb01scal \ndiscipline needed to insulate the country from shocks.\n\n\fSmall island economies\n\nProspects  for  three  small  island  economies  in  the  Pacific  vary,  with  growth  forecast  to \naccelerate  in  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu  but  decelerate  in  Nauru.  Public  investments  financed  by \ndevelopment  partners  increased  significantly  in  2016  and  2017  and  will  continue  to  drive \neconomic growth in 2018 and\u00a02019. Further, public investments provide vital infrastructure \nthat  will  allow  these  economies  to  reap  the  benefits  of  improved  maritime  links.\n\nEconomic performance \nKiribati is enjoying sustained economic growth that averaged \n3.2% from 2012 to 2016. Growth accelerated to 2.5% in 2017 \nfrom 1.8% in 2016 on \ufb01shery revenue receipts that were 2.6% \nhigher than in 2016 (Figure 3.39.1). Higher revenue \ufb01nanced \nhigher public expenditure, particularly for wages, which \nincreased by 14.5% in 2017, and transfers to the outer islands, \nup by 30.2%. In addition, growth continues to be driven by \ninfrastructure investments supported by development partners, \nwhich equal in value 49.5% of GDP. \n\nNauru saw growth slow to an estimated 4.0% in \ufb01scal \nyear 2017 (FY2017, ended 30 June 2017) as phosphate exports \nweakened and activities connected with the Regional \nProcessing Center (RPC), an Australian facility for asylum \nseekers, reached a plateau. The service sector, having replaced \nthe phosphate industry as the main source of growth in 2013, \nprovided an estimated 75% of GDP in FY2017. \n\nIn Tuvalu, the economy expanded by 3.2% in 2017, slightly \n\nup from 2016. Although \ufb01shing license revenues declined by \n19% from the previous year, they continued to drive growth \nin tandem with projects supported by development partners \nwhose total value equaled 35.6% of GDP in 2017 (Figure\u00a03.39.2). \nGrowth was well above its long-term average of 2.1%. \nConsumption spending increased on a 2.5% boost to public \nsector wages that came on top of a 10.0% increment in 2016.\nAll three economies use the Australian dollar as their \ncurrency, and this, along with subdued global food prices, has \nbrought price stability in recent years. In Kiribati and Tuvalu, \nin\ufb02ation accelerated in 2017 as economic activity picked up. \nIn Nauru, in\ufb02ation slowed to an estimated 5.0%, in line with \nmoderating economic activity. \n\nThis chapter was written by Jacqueline Connell of the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and \nCoordination Office, ADB, Sydney; Laisiasa Tora of the Paci\ufb01c Department, \nADB, Manila; and Prince Cruz and Noel Del Castillo, consultants, Paci\ufb01c \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.39.1\u2002GDP growth\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n34.2\n\n36.5\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru\u00a0budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.39.2\u2002Fishing license revenue\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru\u00a0budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fCurrent account in\ufb02ows come largely from \ufb01shing license \n\n3.39.3\u2002 Grants\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.39.4\u2002Inflation\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n324(cid:11)(cid:11)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nfees, investment income from sovereign wealth funds, and \ngrant-\ufb01nanced infrastructure investments (Figure 3.39.3). \nHigher imports of goods and services for construction projects, \nfunded through loans from development partners, widened the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit in Tuvalu and narrowed the surplus \nin\u00a0Kiribati. \n\nIn Kiribati, increased outlays for copra subsidies and other \nspending more than offset strong revenue collection, causing a \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to 9.2% of GDP that reversed a 4.0% surplus \nin the previous year. In Nauru, government spending including \nRPC expenses continued to increase, by 17.4% over FY2016, \nnarrowing the \ufb01scal surplus to the equivalent of 10.4% of \nGDP in FY2017\u2014the surplus becoming a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.1% \nof GDP when including contributions to the intergenerational \ntrust fund.

In 2017, a \ufb01scal surplus equal to 10.9% of GDP \nlargely re\ufb02ected budget support grants and windfall \ufb01shing \nrevenue that offset falling tax revenue.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to moderate in all three small island \neconomies over the forecast period. In Kiribati, major projects \nwill continue, but revenue from \ufb01shing licenses is projected \nto decline. In Nauru, the economy is expected to contract \nin FY2018 as some refugees are resettled in the US, and the \nRPC, which provides some 35% of GDP, scales down. While \n\ufb01shery revenue is likely to remain stable, phosphate exports \nare expected to shrink as deposits diminish. Secondary mining, \nbelow the surface, offers some promise but would require \nsigni\ufb01cant investment. Economic contraction in Nauru will be \npartly offset by the planned construction of a seaport starting \nin FY2019, though possible delays pose a downside risk to the \noutlook (an upside risk is a delay in scaling down the RPC). \nIn Tuvalu, the economy is expected to grow moderately as \nconstruction on public projects continues.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to accelerate slightly in Kiribati in 2018 \n\nand 2019 as global commodity prices rise (Figure 3.39.4).

In Tuvalu, in\ufb02ation \nwill likely ease in 2018 as demand slows, then rise again in 2019 \non higher international food and fuel prices. \n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in Kiribati is projected to narrow to the \n\nequivalent of 7.3% of GDP in 2018 before widening again to \n10.9% in 2019 as \ufb01shing revenue declines and as grants for \n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru \nbudget documents; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru \nbudget documents; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSmall island economies\u2002\u2002325\n\nouter island development and copra subsidies remain high, \nhaving almost doubled from 10.7% in 2015 to 20.8% in 2017. \nIn\u00a0Nauru, lower RPC revenue is expected to be partly offset in \nboth \ufb01scal years by development partner support for the budget \nand contributions to the intergenerational trust fund. With \ntotal revenue expected to decline in FY2019, \ufb01scal discipline is \nneeded to accommodate capital spending, and particularly the \ngovernment\u2019s investment in construction of the new seaport. \nIn\u00a0Tuvalu, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is expected to widen in\u00a02018 \nand 2019 as revenues from \ufb01shing license fees and other \ntaxes\u00a0decline.\n\nThe current account surplus in Kiribati will narrow \n\nconsiderably as \ufb01shing revenue slows and imports of materials \nincrease for infrastructure projects. In Tuvalu, the current \naccount de\ufb01cit is expected to widen to about 30% of GDP in \n2018 and 2019 because the goods and services de\ufb01cit continues \nto outpace in\ufb02ows from \ufb01shing license fees and development \ngrants.

In\u00a02008, the \ngovernment established Kiribati Shipping Services Limited \nto \ufb01ll the transportation de\ufb01cit, but its \ufb02eet has deteriorated \nunder poor maintenance and management. The government \nrecently acquired two new vessels and is reviewing technical \nassistance recommendations from development partners \ntoward developing a long-term strategy to ensure corporate \nsustainability. \n\nNauru conducts more than 95% of its international trade \n\nby sea. A\u00a0fringing reef requires most cargo to be ferried on \nsmall barges from offshore moorings to the dock. Turnaround \nthat takes on average 21\u00a0days drives up shipping costs. \nRough\u00a0seas regularly render the port inoperable, typically \nclosing it for 3\u00a0months of the year. The resulting interruption \nof food and fuel supplies increases prices.

With support from development partners, the \ngovernment plans to establish a maintenance fund to be \n\ufb01nanced through budget allocations and port revenue. \n\nTuvalu, with nine atolls stretching over 900,000 square \nkilometers of the southwest Paci\ufb01c, views transportation as \na primary concern. Because many islands are too small for \nair\ufb01elds, marine transport is the only option for transporting \nessential goods such as food and fuel or people seeking \nmedical care or education. As inadequate docks preclude \naccess by larger vessels, small vessels must be used to ferry \ngoods and people. This is safe only in daylight and with \nsmooth seas, making transport costly and inefficient. In 2015, \nthe Government of Tuvalu adopted its National Strategy for \nSustainable Development, 2016\u20132020, which includes strategies \nto provide efficient, high-quality infrastructure and support \nservices. However, further project support may be needed to \nexpedite the creation of transport infrastructure. \n\n\fstatistical \nappendix\n\n\fStatistical notes and tables\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators \nfor\u00a0the 45 developing member economies of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in 18 tables. The economies are grouped into \ufb01ve \nsubregions: Central Asia, East Asia, South\u00a0Asia, Southeast Asia, \nand\u00a0the Paci\ufb01c. Most of the tables contain historical data from 2013 \nto 2017; some have forecasts for 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences \nin statistical methodology, de\ufb01nitions, coverage, and practices \nmake full comparability impossible. The national income accounts \nsection is based on the United Nations System of National Accounts, \nwhile the data on balance of payments are based on International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical data were \nobtained from official sources, statistical publications, and databases, \nas well as documents of ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank. \nFor\u00a0some economies, data for 2017 are estimated from the latest \navailable information. Projections for 2018 and 2019 are generally \nADB estimates made on the bases of available quarterly or monthly \ndata, though some projections are from governments.\n\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record \ntheir government \ufb01nance data by \ufb01scal year: Brunei Darussalam; \nFiji; Hong Kong, China; the Kyrgyz Republic; the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR); Singapore; Tajikistan; Thailand; \nand Uzbekistan. South Asian countries (except for Maldives and \nSri\u00a0Lanka), the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the \nRepublic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, Myanmar, Palau, Samoa, and \nTonga report all variables by \ufb01scal year.\n\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for \nseven tables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, \nA6, A11, A12 and A14, the averages are computed using weights \nderived from gross national income (GNI) in current US dollars \nfollowing the World Bank Atlas method. The GNI data for 2013\u20132016 \nwere obtained from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators \nonline. Weights for 2016 were carried over through 2019. The GNI \ndata for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China were estimated using the \nAtlas conversion factor. For Table A13, the regional and subregional \ntotals were computed based on a consistent sum, which means \nthat if country data are missing for a given year, the sum excludes \nthat\u00a0country.\n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002329\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show data on output \n\ngrowth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries have been made to accommodate \na change in source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for \nAfghanistan, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan re\ufb02ect \ufb01scal year \ndata, rather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste \nre\ufb02ect GDP excluding the offshore petroleum sector.\n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows \nannual growth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor \ncosts, or basic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of \nvalue added by all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including \ntaxes less subsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added \nor similar taxes. Constant factor cost measures differ from market \nprice measures in that they exclude taxes on production and include \nsubsidies. Basic price valuation is the factor cost plus some taxes \non production, such\u00a0as property and payroll taxes, and less some \nsubsidies, such as for labor but not for products. Most economies use \nconstant market price valuation. Pakistan and Nepal use constant \nfactor costs, while Fiji and Maldives use basic prices.\n\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The\u00a0table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is de\ufb01ned as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. Data on per capita \ngross national income in US dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2016 \nare also shown, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s World Development \nIndicators online. The data for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China \nwere estimated using the Atlas conversion factor.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (%\u00a0per\u00a0year).\n\nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and agriculture\u2019s share of GDP in 2016 at current \nprices. The agriculture sector comprises plant crops, livestock, \npoultry, \ufb01sheries, and forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year).\n\nThe table provides the growth rates of value added in industry \nat constant prices and industry\u2019s share of GDP in 2016 at current \nprices. This sector comprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, \nconstruction, and utilities.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (%\u00a0per\u00a0year).\n\nThe table gives the growth rates of value added in services at \nconstant prices and services\u2019 share of GDP in 2016 at current \nprices. Subsectors generally include trade, banking, \ufb01nance, real \nestate, public administration, and other services. For Malaysia, \nelectricity, gas, water supply, and waste management are included \nunder\u00a0services.\n\nTable A6: In\ufb02ation (% per year). Data on in\ufb02ation rates are \n\nperiod averages. The in\ufb02ation rates presented are based on consumer \nprice indexes. The consumer price indexes of the following \neconomies are for a given city or group of consumers only: Cambodia \nis for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands is for Majuro, and Solomon \nIslands is for Honiara.\n\n\f330(cid:13)(cid:13)Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nTable A7: Change in money supply (% per year). This table \ntracks the annual percentage change in the end-of-period supply \nof broad money as represented by M2 for most countries. M2 is \nde\ufb01ned as the sum of M1 and quasi-money, where M1 denotes \ncurrency in circulation plus demand deposits, and quasi-money \nconsists of time and savings deposits including foreign currency \ndeposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government \ufb01nance. These tables give \n\nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the \ufb01scal balance \nof the central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in \nnominal terms. For Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Tajikistan, \ntransactions are those reported by the general government.\n\nTable A8: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central \n\ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both \ncurrent and capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as \na percentage of GDP at current prices. For\u00a0the Republic of Korea, \nrevenues exclude social security contributions. For Singapore, \nrevenues include the contribution from net investment returns. \nFor Kazakhstan, revenues include transfers from the national \nfund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Malaysia, \nSingapore, and Thailand; revenues from disinvestment are included \nfor India; and only current revenues are included for Bangladesh.\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). \nCentral government expenditures comprise all nonrepayable \npayments to both current and capital expenses, plus net lending. \nThese amounts are computed as a share of GDP at current prices. \nFor Thailand, expenditures refer to budgetary expenditures \nexcluding externally \ufb01nanced expenditures and borrowing. \nThose\u00a0for Tajikistan include externally \ufb01nanced public investment \nprograms. One-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\n\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of the central government (% of \nGDP). Fiscal balance is the difference between central government \nrevenues and expenditures. The difference is computed as a share \nof GDP at current prices. Data variations may arise from statistical \ndiscrepancies when, for example, balancing items for both central \nand local governments, and from differences in the concept used \nin the individual computations of revenues and expenditures \nas compared with the calculation of the \ufb01scal balance. For Fiji, \nthe \ufb01scal balance excludes loan repayments. For Thailand, the \n\ufb01scal balance is the cash balance of the combined budgetary and \nnonbudgetary balances. For Uzbekistan, the augmented \ufb01scal \nbalance includes the Fund for Reconstruction and Development. \nSome off-budget accounts are included in the computation of the \n\ufb01scal balance for Turkmenistan.\n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. \n\nThese\u00a0tables show selected international economic transactions \nof countries as recorded in the balance of payments.

These tables show the annual growth rates \nof exports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, \nprimarily obtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each \neconomy. Exports are reported free on board. Import data are \nreported free on board, except for the following economies, which \nvalue them on the basis of cost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; \nBhutan; Hong Kong, China; India; the Lao PDR; Myanmar; \nSingapore; and Thailand.\n\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures in this table are based on the export and import amounts \nused to generate tables A11 and A12.\n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current \naccount balance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, \nnet trade in services and factor income, and net transfers. The values \nreported are divided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. In the \ncase of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, official transfers are \nexcluded from the current account balance.\n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average).\nAnnual average exchange rates are quoted as the local currency per \nUS dollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \ninternational reserves are de\ufb01ned as the US dollar value of holdings \nof foreign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the \nIMF, and gold at the end of a given period. For Taipei,China, this \nheading refers to foreign exchange reserves only. In some economies, \nthe rubric is foreign assets and reserves of national monetary \nauthorities and national oil funds, e.g., net foreign reserves of the \nState Bank of Pakistan. The data for India are as of 2 March 2018.\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most \neconomies, external debt outstanding, public and private, includes \nmedium- and long-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. For \nCambodia and the Lao PDR, only public external debt is reported. \nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, the \n\ufb01gures for 2017 are as of the end of September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and \nservices). This table generally presents the total debt service \npayments of each economy, which comprise principal repayments \n(excluding on short-term debt) and interest payments on outstanding \nexternal debt, as a percentage of exports of goods and services. \nFor Cambodia and the Lao\u00a0PDR, debt service refers to external \npublic debt only. For Viet Nam, exports of goods are used as the \ndenominator in the calculation of the ratio; for the Philippines, \nexports of goods, services, and income are used as the denominator. \nFor Bangladesh, the ratio represents debt service payments on \nmedium- and long-term loans as a percentage of exports of goods, \nnonfactor services, and workers\u2019 remittances. For\u00a0Azerbaijan, the \nratio represents public and publicly guaranteed external debt service \npayments as a percentage of exports of goods and nonfactor services.\n\n\f332\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\n\nTable A1\u2002Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

A strong \nperformance in 2017 reflected a surge in exports, which will likely abate this year and next, and rapidly \nexpanding domestic demand. While the outlook is for steady growth, risks to it are decidedly on the \ndownside: Trade friction could weaken recently deepened trade links, tightening US monetary policy could \ndiminish investment in developing Asia, and rising domestic private debt may hamper growth.\n\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for economic growth, better-paid jobs, and \npoverty reduction. The latest technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence may threaten some jobs, \nhowever, and leave less-skilled workers behind. To maximize gains in productivity while safeguarding social \nwelfare, governments in developing Asia should protect workers but not preserve particular jobs. Meanwhile, \nthey should facilitate the countervailing forces in new technologies that generate new jobs. Dealing with the \ndownsides of new technology requires synchronized effort on skills development, labor regulation, social \nprotection, and income redistribution. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor.
