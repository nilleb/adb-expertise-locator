A strong \nperformance in 2017 reflected a surge in exports, which will likely abate this year and next, and rapidly \nexpanding domestic demand. While the outlook is for steady growth, risks to it are decidedly on the \ndownside: Trade friction could weaken recently deepened trade links, tightening US monetary policy could \ndiminish investment in developing Asia, and rising domestic private debt may hamper growth.\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for economic growth, better-paid jobs, and \npoverty reduction. The latest technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence may threaten some jobs, \nhowever, and leave less-skilled workers behind. To maximize gains in productivity while safeguarding social \nwelfare, governments in developing Asia should protect workers but not preserve particular jobs. Meanwhile, \nthey should facilitate the countervailing forces in new technologies that generate new jobs. Dealing with the \ndownsides of new technology requires synchronized effort on skills development, labor regulation, social \nprotection, and income redistribution. \nHA\nowSI\n TA\necN\nhn D\no\nAbout the Asian Development Bank logEV\ny AEL\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.

growth outlook for developing Asia remains vibrant. \nAsian\u00a0Development Outlook 2018 foresees continued momentum after growth \naccelerated to 6.1% in 2017. The region is expected to expand by 6.0% in \n2018 and 5.9% in 2019. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly industrialized \neconomies, the prospects for growth are even higher, at 6.5% in 2018 and \n6.4% in 2019. Traction for economic expansion will come from strong \nexternal demand, which is supported by a further pickup in growth this year \nin the major industrial economies, and robust domestic demand. Growth in \nthe People\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China is seen to continue its gradual moderation, \nto 6.6% this year and 6.4% next, as the authorities take actions to address \nfinancial risks, while India recovers from a temporary growth setback \nin\u00a02017, rebounding to 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% in 2019.\nCertain risks to this outlook require monitoring. The upswing in trade \ncould be threatened by rising trade tensions. Although the measures \nimplemented by the United States as of the end of March this year are \nunlikely to have a significant impact, the move away from trade openness \nis worrying. Further measures and countermeasures could dent business \nand consumer confidence. Meanwhile, capital flows to the region could \ndiminish if the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates faster than expected \nto keep fiscal stimulus there from igniting inflation. Within the region, \nthe buildup of private debt in some economies in the past few years needs \nclose\u00a0monitoring. Fortunately, most Asian economies are well positioned to \nmeet these challenges.\nThis year\u2019s publication draws attention to opportunities and concerns \npresented by new technologies in the workplace. The application of new \ntechnologies will boost productivity, but at the same time it will displace \ncertain types of jobs. Evidence shows, however, that rising demand and \nhigher output will create jobs, outweighing job displacement, especially \nwith the addition of new occupations and industries that will arise to \nmeet the new needs of producers and consumers. This transition will \nrequire a skilled\u00a0workforce and could put the less-skilled at a disadvantage. \nThe\u00a0challenge for governments is to ensure that workers are equipped with \nfoundational skills to enable lifelong learning and have the specialized skills \nrequired for working with new technologies. Governments must act to \nenhance and adapt skills development, labor regulation, social protection, \nand income redistribution. Finally, they must ensure that new technologies \ndevelop in ways that benefit people and protect their rights.\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nAsian Development Outlook 2018 was prepared by staff of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, East Asia Department, Pacific \nDepartment, South Asia Department, Southeast Asia Department, and Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional Economic Outlook \nTask Force, which met regularly to coordinate and develop consistent forecasts for \nthe region.\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each chapter. \nThe\u00a0subregional coordinators were Kenji Takamiya and Fatima Catacutan for \nCentral\u00a0Asia, Akiko Terada-Hagiwara for East Asia, Masato Nakane for South Asia, \nKwang Jo Jeong and Dulce Zara for Southeast Asia, and Rommel Rabanal and \nCara\u00a0Tinio for the Pacific. \nA team of economists in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment, led by Joseph E.

Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly \nindustrialized economies, growth should reach 6.5% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019.\nWith oil prices edging up and robust consumer demand continuing, in\ufb02ation is \npoised to pick up after dipping slightly last year. Consumer prices are projected \nto rise by 2.9% in both 2018 and 2019, or 0.6 percentage points more than \nin\u00a02017.\nThough prospects are \ufb01rm, risks are clearly to the downside. Protectionist \nmeasures and retaliation against them could undermine the recent pickup in \ntrade growth. In response to \ufb01scal stimulus, the United States Federal Reserve \nmay need to raise interest rates faster than currently expected, which could \ndiminish capital \ufb02ows to developing Asia.\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for better-paid jobs \nand economic growth. While new technologies displace jobs, they also unleash \ncountervailing forces that generate more jobs. As some workers may be left \nbehind, governments in developing Asia should respond to this challenge by \nensuring that workers are protected from the downside of new technologies \nand prepared to harness the new opportunities they provide. This will require \ncoordinated action on skills development, labor regulation, social protection, \nand income redistribution.\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank", "x(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nTurning strength into opportunity\nStrong tailwinds but tricky crosscurrents \n(cid:31) Asia and the Paci\ufb01c continue to enjoy steady growth. The region picked up \nsteam throughout last year to average 6.1% growth in gross domestic product \n(GDP), a 0.2 percentage point uptick from 2016. Excluding the high-income \nnewly industrialized economies, growth was 6.6%. The strong showing re\ufb02ected \nboth solid export demand and rapidly expanding domestic demand, including \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Momentum is likely to moderate only \nslightly to 6.0% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019, or 6.5% and 6.4% excluding the newly \nindustrialized economies. \n\u00bb  Growth accelerated across the major industrial economies. Aggregate \ngrowth in the United States, the euro area, and Japan rose to 2.3% from \n1.5% in 2016, while unemployment rates reached their lowest since the \nglobal \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. The pace of growth will continue at \n2.3% in\u00a02018, with US \ufb01scal expansion sustaining growth for the group as a \nwhole, before slowing to 2.0% in 2019. Gradual monetary tightening in the \nUS is expected to keep in\ufb02ation in check. Rising business con\ufb01dence in the \neuro area and Japan will be supported by accommodative monetary and \n\ufb01scal\u00a0policies. \n\u00bb  PRC growth accelerated on strong demand from home and abroad. \nThe\u00a0service sector grew by 8% on buoyant domestic demand, and net \nexports expanded as trade in intermediate manufactures rebounded. \nAssuming mildly tighter monetary and \ufb01scal policies in the PRC, growth is \nexpected to moderate from 6.9% in 2017 to 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019. \nFurther\u00a0progress on reforms such as strengthening \ufb01nancial sector regulation \nand supervision, and addressing debt issues would lay a foundation for solid \nmacroeconomic stability.\n\u00bb  India is set to rebound from a dip in growth following reform. Growth in \n\ufb01scal 2017 was estimated at 6.6%, 0.5 percentage points below the previous \nyear. The demonetization of large banknotes in late 2016 had lingering \neffects on small business and private credit, and reform that introduced a \nnational goods and services tax temporarily slowed business activity early \nin \ufb01scal 2017. While industry and agriculture slackened, services grew by a \nsolid 8.3%. Improved business regulation and buoyant tax revenue will bolster \ngrowth to the forecast horizon, as it accelerates to 7.3% in 2018 and 7.6% \nin\u00a02019.\n\u00bb  Growth in Southeast Asia is forecast steady this year and next. Although \nan expansion of technology exports in 2017 will moderate somewhat, \nrecovery in global commodity prices should continue to support exporters \nof primary goods. Growth in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand will \naccelerate thanks to strong investment and domestic consumption, while \nViet\u00a0Nam will bene\ufb01t from continued expansion of its industrial base. \nSoutheast Asia is expected to maintain its 2017 growth rate of 5.2% in 2018 \nand 2019. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xi\n\u00bb Events temper resource revivals in the Paci\ufb01c and Central Asia. Growth \nin the Paci\ufb01c will linger at the 2017 rate of 2.2% in 2018, following earthquake \ndamage that has temporarily disrupted gas production in Papua\u00a0New Guinea, \nbefore accelerating to 3.0% in 2019. Higher crude prices boosted growth \nin Central Asian oil producers in 2017, lifting subregional growth to 4.3%. \nHowever, as a rebound in industry in Kazakhstan moderates, growth in \nCentral\u00a0Asia is forecast to slow to 4.0% in 2018, picking up somewhat to 4.2% \nin 2019.\n(cid:31)  Strong consumer demand and rising commodity prices will lift in\ufb02ation. \nThe region experienced broadly stable in\ufb02ation at 2.3% in 2017, but higher \nincomes today and oil prices tomorrow will bring increases. With average Brent \ncrude oil prices rising above $60/barrel in 2018 and 2019 from $54 in 2017, \nin\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 2.9% in 2018 and 2019. Despite the \npickup, moderated in\ufb02ation expectations will hold price rises below the 10-year \naverage of 3.7%. Both years will see accelerating price rises in all subregions \nexcept Central Asia, where price-stabilizing policy will seek to tame in\ufb02ation that \nreached double digits in 2016. \n(cid:31)  Developing Asia\u2019s trade rebound will taper modestly. Exports grew in 2017 \nby 4.9% in real terms in the region\u2019s 10 largest economies, and imports by 7.7%. \nIn US dollar terms, exports rose by 9.6%, with growth in the second half hitting \n7.9% in the PRC and 16.5% in the \ufb01ve largest economies in Southeast Asia. \nCommodities and manufactures alike saw export growth, which was particularly \nstrong for trade within Asia of intermediate manufactures for assembly into \nelectrical and electronic goods, machinery, and equipment. Trade growth is \nexpected to slow somewhat in 2018 and 2019. Despite the rebound in exports, \nthe current account surplus of the PRC fell by 0.4 percentage points to equal \n1.4% of GDP in 2017. This helped narrow Asia\u2019s current account surplus with the \nrest of the world to 0.5% of global GDP.\n(cid:31)  Favorable as the growth outlook is, the risks to it are on the downside. Risks \nto trade are high on the list. Protectionist trade measures implemented by the\u00a0US \nso far in 2018 have not discernibly dented buoyant trade \ufb02ows to and from \ndeveloping Asia. However, further actions and retaliation against them could \nundermine the business and consumer optimism that underlies the regional \noutlook. Another risk is diminishing capital in\ufb02ows if the US Federal Reserve \nneeds to raise interest rates faster than markets expect to keep \ufb01scal expansion \nfrom overheating the economy. The trade revival last year has, however, \nreinforced strong trade links within Asia and built up \ufb01nancial buffers in many \nAsian economies, in particular in recovering commodity exporters. Asia\u00a0should \ntherefore be in a strong position to withstand most shocks.", "xii(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nPrivate debt and economic growth\n(cid:31) Developing Asia continues to accumulate private debt. Since the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, the ratio of private debt to GDP has declined in \nthe US and other advanced economies as companies and households strove to \ndeleverage. In contrast, ratios of household and non\ufb01nancial corporate debt to \nGDP have continued to rise in emerging markets, including those in Asia. In the \nPRC, for example, the corporate debt ratio rose from 96% of GDP at the end \nof 2008 to 163% at the end of the third quarter of 2017. In the same period, \nthe household debt ratio rose from 50% to 67% in Malaysia, 74% to 94% in the \nRepublic of Korea, and 45% to 68% in Thailand.\n(cid:31)  Does the private debt buildup pose a risk to regional growth? Private \ndebt accumulation spurs growth only in the short run. Evidence shows that \nthe positive effect of household debt growth in emerging economies typically \ndissipates after 2 years, turning negative in the medium term. The pattern is \nbroadly parallel in advanced economies. Similarly, corporate debt growth does \nnot seem to have any persistent positive effect on output growth. Further, as the \namount of private debt rises, the impact of additional debt on output growth \nbecomes smaller. \n(cid:31)  The results argue for closely monitoring the buildup of private debt. The \nregion would bene\ufb01t as well from macroprudential measures that help prevent \nexcessive credit buildup. The accumulation of both household and corporate \ndebt may pose a medium-term threat to the currently benign economic outlook \nfor the region. However, the lack of a persistent positive effect on output \nsuggests that not all of the added private debt is channeled into productive \ninvestments and activities. Strengthening regional \ufb01nancial systems would \nimprove the quality of private debt. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xiii\nOutlook by subregion\n(cid:31) Most of developing Asia will pause after a pickup in 2017. As only 14 of 45 \nindividual economies are forecast to see growth accelerate in 2018, aggregate \ngrowth rates in most subregions are projected to be unchanged or lower this \nyear. South Asia is the exception, as a rebound in India will lift growth above 7%, \nmaking it the fastest-growing subregion in developing Asia. Across the region, \ndomestic demand will remain as the key sustainer of growth. Central Asia and \nthe Paci\ufb01c will bounce back in 2019.\n(cid:31)  East Asia slows on moderating PRC growth and external trade. Economic \ngrowth in East Asia picked up by 0.3 percentage points to 6.3% in 2017 as strong \nexternal and internal demand lifted every economy in the subregion. Growth \naccelerated to 6.9% in the PRC on robust exports and private consumption, \nand surging coal exports and mining investment lifted Mongolia\u2019s growth rate \nfourfold to 5.1%. Expansion in the PRC should moderate to 6.6% in 2018 and \n6.4% in 2019 as economic policy leans further toward \ufb01nancial stability and a \nmore sustainable growth trajectory. Other economies in the subregion will see \nlower growth as well, mainly on account of moderating export growth. These \ndevelopments will tamp down East Asian economic expansion to 6.0% in 2018 \nand 5.8% in 2019. In\ufb02ation dipped in East Asia last year, re\ufb02ecting moderation \nin the PRC, where food prices fell. It will trend higher from 1.6% in 2017 to 2.3% \nin 2018 and 2.2% in 2019 as food prices rise, the PRC deregulates prices, and \nwages improve in most economies.\n(cid:31)  South Asia anticipates revived growth after a 2-year slowdown. Aggregate \ngrowth slipped 0.3 percentage points to 6.4% in 2017. This re\ufb02ected slackening \nin India, where growth fell to 6.6% with the lingering effects of demonetization \nin 2016, businesses adjusting in 2017 to a new goods and services tax, and \nagriculture subdued. The South Asian giant is expected to bounce back to \n7.3% in \ufb01scal 2018 and \ufb01rm to 7.6% in 2019 as the new tax regime improves \nproductivity and as banking reform and corporate deleveraging take hold to \nreverse a downtrend in investment. Elsewhere in South Asia, growth will stay \nrobust but generally not improve. The need to carry out revenue-enhancing \n\ufb01scal reform and to strengthen economic policy will temporarily brake expansion \nin Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Growth in South Asia as a whole is \nforecast to rise to 7.0% in 2018 and 7.2% in 2019. Very modest food price rises \nin India following bumper harvests there pushed average in\ufb02ation in South Asia \ndown to 4.0% in 2017. In\ufb02ation is forecast to revive to 4.7% in 2018 and to 5.1% \nin 2019, mainly on higher oil prices. \n(cid:31)  Southeast Asia is poised to sustain a higher growth path. Growth accelerated \nto 5.2% last year, 0.5 percentage points higher than in 2016. A turnaround in \nexports and robust domestic demand underpinned solid economic performances \nacross the subregion. As export growth moderates from last year\u2019s rebound, \nstronger domestic demand\u2014fueled by ambitious public infrastructure spending, \nsolid foreign direct investment, and robust household consumption\u2014should \nsee the subregion sustain average annual growth at 5.2% this year and next. \nGrowth this year in 8 of the 10 economies is projected to be equal or exceed \nthe 2017 rate, but Malaysia and Singapore are likely to unwind from last year\u2019s \nrapid expansion toward their long-term potential growth rates. In\ufb02ation, having ", "xiv(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nedged up 0.7 percentage points to 2.8% in 2017, is seen stabilizing at about 3.0% \nthis year and next, buoyed by strong domestic demand, higher minimum wages, \nhikes in administered prices, and rising international oil prices. Only Malaysia \nwill see in\ufb02ation cool in both 2018 and 2019 after changes to the price-setting \nmechanism for fuel and lubricants spiked transport costs in 2017.\n(cid:31)  Central Asia moderates after a notable recovery in 2017. Average growth \nin the subregion rose to 4.3% from 2.7% a year earlier as recession ended in \nAzerbaijan and expansion accelerated in six other economies, particularly in \npredominant Kazakhstan. Growth slowed only in Uzbekistan, where sharp \ncurrency devaluation to unify the exchange rate and other economic reform \nforfeited some expansion last year for future growth. Following a strong pickup \nin growth last year, Kazakhstan is projected to slow to 3.2% in 2018 but bounce \nback to 3.5% in 2019 as investment quickens. With expansion moderating in \nmost of its economies, Central Asia is projected to slow to 4.0% in 2018 and \nreaccelerate to 4.2% in 2019 with faster growth in all eight countries. A more \nstable exchange rate almost halved in\ufb02ation in Kazakhstan, trimming average \nin\ufb02ation in the subregion to 9.2% in 2017 from 10.6% in 2016, even though \nin\ufb02ation accelerated in the other seven economies, particularly in Uzbekistan. \nAs\u00a0recent currency devaluations slip further into the past, in\ufb02ation is projected \nto settle at 8.5% in 2018 and 7.9% in 2019. \n(cid:31)  The Paci\ufb01c will grow more slowly than the other subregions. Growth at \n2.2% in 2017 was determined largely by events in Papua New Guinea, the \nlargest Paci\ufb01c economy, where growth at a similar rate re\ufb02ected a slowdown in \nagriculture and contraction in oil and gas. Elsewhere, performance was mixed, \nwith Palau and Timor-Leste contracting. While these two economies will bounce \nback in 2018, all others will either maintain the pace or slow. Following an \nearthquake in February, growth in Papua New Guinea is expected to falter to \n1.8%, but recovery in Timor-Leste is expected to keep growth in the subregion as \na whole unchanged at 2.2% in 2018. An expected recovery in Papua New Guinea \nand continuing strength in Timor-Leste should contribute to aggregate growth of \n3.0% in 2019. Although in\ufb02ation in the Paci\ufb01c fell 1.0 percentage point to 3.8% \nin 2017, prices rose faster in eight economies, half of them escaping de\ufb02ation in \nthe previous year. As higher global commodity prices will boost in\ufb02ation in most \neconomies in 2018, subregional in\ufb02ation is forecast to reach 4.1% in 2018 before \ntapering to 3.9% in 2019.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xv\nHow technology affects jobs\nSummary\n\uf076  New technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for better-paid \njobs and economic growth.\n\uf076  Despite growing concern that new technologies could cause widespread job \nloss, optimism about developing Asia\u2019s job prospects springs from several \nobservations:\n\uf074  New technologies often automate only some tasks of a job, not the \nwhole\u00a0job. ATMs, for example, have not replaced bank tellers but \nbroadened their role in customer relationship management.\n\uf074  Job automation goes ahead only where it is both technically and \neconomically feasible. Both requirements tend to be met in capital-\nintensive manufacturing, where employment shares were already low \nin\u00a02015.\n\uf074  Rising demand offsets job displacement driven by automation.  \nIn 2005\u20132015, jobs created by rising domestic demand more than \ncompensated for job losses to technological advances.\n\uf074  Technological change and economic growth create new occupations \nand industries. Many new job titles have arisen in ICT, and new types \nof jobs will arise in health care and education and in \ufb01nance, insurance, \nreal\u00a0estate, and other business services.\n\uf076  Nevertheless, new technologies alter the skills required of the workforce and \nmay cause unemployment as some \ufb01rms downsize or close. They make the \nless-skilled more likely to experience lower wage growth, exacerbating income \ninequality.\n\uf076  Governments should respond to these challenges by ensuring that workers \nare protected from the downside of new technologies and able to harness the \nnew opportunities they provide. This will require coordinated action on skills \ndevelopment, labor regulation, social protection, and income redistribution.\n\uf076  Governments should use new technologies to improve education and skills \ndevelopment, as well as to deliver such public services as social protection \nprograms. Government support for new technologies must bene\ufb01t people \nand protect their rights and privacy. \nRising concern over technology displacing jobs\n(cid:31) Developing Asia has done remarkably well in creating jobs for its workers. \nOver the past 25 years, the region has created 30 million jobs annually in \nindustry and services. Job creation has come with improved productivity, rising \nearnings for workers, and large reductions in poverty. Contributing to this process \nare shifts in employment from sectors with low productivity and pay, typically \nsubsistence agriculture, to sectors with higher productivity and pay, typically \nin modern industry and services. But a larger part of productivity gains come \nfrom technological advances within sectors, such as high-yielding crop varieties \nin agriculture, modern machine tools in manufacturing, and information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) in services. The creation and adoption of new ", "xvi(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\ntechnologies is driven not only by investments in education, infrastructure, and \nresearch and development, but also by international trade and foreign direct \ninvestment. At the same time, macroeconomic stability and an investment \nclimate conducive to business have provided a foundation for technological \nadvance, sustained growth, and job creation.\n(cid:31)  Technological advances fuel productivity but also threaten jobs. Emerging \ntechnologies such as robotics, three-dimensional printing, arti\ufb01cial intelligence, \nand the internet of things will help drive future prosperity. Yet they also pose \nchallenges for workers. The apparel and footwear industries, for example, are \nexperimenting with completely automated production. Similarly, it is becoming \ntechnically feasible to automate more complex service tasks such as customer \nsupport. These developments have raised concern that automation could \ncause widespread job loss, slow wage growth, and worsen income inequality in \ndeveloped and developing economies alike. Some studies indicate that over half \nof the jobs in some economies in developing Asia are at risk.\nReasons for optimism on job prospects\n(cid:31) New technologies often automate only some tasks of a job, not the whole \njob. Any job consists of a number of tasks, and the tasks can be classi\ufb01ed as \neither routine or not, and either manual or cognitive. Automation targets mainly \nroutine tasks, such as soldering components onto a circuit board repeatedly on \nan assembly line, which is both routine and manual, or counting and dispensing \ncash in a bank, which is routine and cognitive. While task automation may \ndisplace some types of jobs, in other cases it restructures the job such that \nmachines handle only the routine tasks, freeing up workers to focus on more \ncomplex tasks. The introduction of ATMs, for example, changes the job for bank \ntellers to one of customer relationship management.\n(cid:31)  Job automation goes ahead only where both technically and economically \nfeasible. Data on industrial robots in Asia show the two largest users to be \nelectrical and electronics industries and automobile manufacturers, each \naccounting in 2015 for 39% of the total robot use but, together, only 13.4% \nof total manufacturing employment. By contrast, producers of textiles, \napparel, and leather goods and of food and beverages together accounted \nin the same year for only 1.4% of robot usage but 31.4% of manufacturing \nemployment. This\u00a0pattern re\ufb02ects both technological and economic feasibility. \nMore\u00a0technological sophistication is required to give a robot the dexterity to \nstitch cloth, for example, than to handle large metal parts. At the same time, \nlow\u00a0pay in apparel and footwear is a disincentive to automation. In 12 economies \nin developing Asia that account for 90% of employment in the region, an \nestimated 40% of manufacturing and service jobs entail mostly routine tasks, \neither manual or cognitive. However, many of these jobs are unlikely to be lost. \nSome will be restructured instead, and automating others will not be technically \nor economically feasible.\n(cid:31)  Rising demand offsets job displacement driven by automation. New \ntechnologies allow a given output to be produced by fewer workers. While \nsome workers are displaced, improved productivity and lower prices often \nspur higher demand. Increased demand may even expand the number of jobs ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xvii\nin factories that automate part of their production process. Moreover, the \nproductivity bene\ufb01ts of new technology in one industry lower production costs in \ndownstream industries through input\u2013output channels, contributing to increased \ndemand and employment across industries. An increase in demand and \nproduction in one industry heightens demand for upstream industries as well.\n\u00bb  Data show rising demand more than compensating for jobs displaced by \ntechnology. Using productivity as a broad measure of technological advance, \ninput\u2013output analysis of 12 economies in developing Asia was conducted for \n2005\u20132015, when modern machine tools and ICT equipment spread into \nfactories and offices in a big way. If output had remained the same, higher \nproductivity would have brought a 66% decrease in employment, equal to \n101 million jobs per annum. However, concurrently higher demand for goods \nand services more than offsets this with an associated 88% increase in \nemployment, equal to 134 million jobs per annum.\n\u00bb  Production returning to advanced economies may not threaten \nemployment in Asia. Even if automation in advanced economies attracts \nsome factories back to the home market, this is unlikely to happen on a large \nscale for lack of economic feasibility. In addition, in the 12 Asian economies \nstudied, employment in 2015 that depended directly and indirectly on \ufb01nal \ndemand in advanced economies was only 10%. Developing Asia is growing \nfast and relying less on exports and more on consumption-driven growth as a \nrising middle class generates higher demand for goods and services, including \nthose that are traditionally export-oriented. This suggests that so-called \n\u201creshoring\u201d may not be a major threat to employment in the region. \n(cid:31)  Technological change and economic growth create new occupations and \nindustries. New technologies give rise to new occupations and industries. \nAuto\u00a0repair workers and car salesman emerged alongside the car industry in the \n1900s, and more recently software engineers and app developers accompanied \nthe development of ICT. In addition, the greater complexity of modern \nproduction and growing demand for new personal services in health care, \neducation, \ufb01nance, and others areas are countervailing forces against job loss to \ntechnology as they create new occupations. \n\u00bb  New types of jobs have emerged to handle new technologies. A detailed \nanalysis of occupation titles in India, Malaysia, and the Philippines found \nthat 43%\u201357% of new job titles that emerged in the past 10 years are in\u00a0ICT. \nA large share of new job titles emerged in one of India\u2019s fastest growing \noccupation categories: craft and related workers. This was driven mainly \nby\u00a0the different types of specialized technicians needed to work with \ncomputer-controlled machines. Such trends will continue.\n\u00bb  Comparing occupations across regions shows scope for job growth \nin many sectors. Health care and education provide 15% of employment \nin the US, for example, while \ufb01nance, insurance, real estate, and other \nbusiness services provide 19%.

New jobs will appear, but they may require skills that \nsuch workers do not possess. Further, as \ufb01rms and industries adjust to new ways \nof producing and distributing goods and services, the resulting disruptions along \nexisting supply chains may cause unemployment. In addition to more job losses, \nroutine and manual workers will likely experience lower wage growth, worsening \nincome inequality. \n\u00bb  Demand will grow most for nonroutine cognitive, social, and ICT tasks. \nJobs requiring routine and manual tasks will be less in demand. This is \nsuggested by analysis of \ufb01ve economies in developing Asia showing that, \nover the past decade, annual expansion of employment in jobs intensive \nin nonroutine cognitive tasks, social interactions, and the use of ICT was \n2.6\u00a0percentage points faster than total employment. Average real wages for \nthese nonroutine jobs increased faster than for routine and manual jobs. \n\u00bb  Workers with weaker foundational skills could \ufb01nd themselves left \nbehind. Foundational skills\u2014those that are best learned as a schoolchild, \nencompassing not only basic reading, writing, numeracy but also digital \nliteracy and teamwork ability\u2014support transition into jobs that require \nhigher intensity of nonroutine and cognitive tasks. Without adequate skills \ndevelopment or retraining, workers with weaker foundational skills face \nhurdles in seizing the opportunities that new technologies provide.\n(cid:31)  Even some cognitively oriented but routine jobs may be displaced. The \nbusiness process outsourcing (BPO) industry is a case in point. Industry experts \nestimate that, in 2016, 47% of BPO workers in the Philippines worked at \nprocess-driven tasks requiring little abstract thinking. With the advent of new \ntechnologies, such jobs are likely to decline as a share of all BPO jobs. There will \nbe new opportunities driven by greater demand for more complex BPO services, \nwhich can expand along with technologies. But they will require more specialized \ntraining. Workers employed as medical transcriptionists, for example, may lose \ntheir jobs to increasingly sophisticated software able to recognize voice, text, and \nimage signals. Transitioning these workers into nonroutine cognitive jobs in the \nBPO industry will require retraining and skills development. \nThe role of government in harnessing technology for workers \n(cid:31) Governments must pursue education reform and promote lifelong learning. \nSchools need incentives to strengthen foundational skills that enable individuals \nto learn\u2014and to relearn. For imparting the specialized skills needed to work \nwith new technologies, universities and institutions specializing in technical \nand vocational education and training (TVET) are key, and they will have to \ncater not only to the rising number of graduates from secondary education \nbut also to adults seeking to upgrade their skills or retrain. These institutions \nmust be better integrated, as through credit transfer systems that enable TVET \ngraduates to pursue higher education and university students to acquire speci\ufb01c \ntechnical\u00a0skills. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xix\n(cid:31) Labor market \ufb02exibility needs to be accompanied by programs that support \nthe unemployed. Labor markets will need to be \ufb02exible to accommodate the \nreallocation of labor across \ufb01rms and industries necessary to realize the bene\ufb01ts \nof new technologies. Some governments need to eliminate excessive regulatory \nbarriers to hiring and \ufb01ring. All governments must pursue active labor market \nprograms that provide job placement services to match unemployed workers \nwith emerging employment opportunities, as well as training and retraining \nprograms that equip workers with skills in high demand. \n(cid:31)  Social protection systems must be strengthened. Workers need protection \nfrom income losses on account of unemployment. Social protection systems \nare essential as well for workers who may still be employed but in low-paid \ninformal jobs. Systems need to be strengthened in terms of unemployment \nbene\ufb01ts, expanded health insurance, public works programs, and income \ntransfers. Minimum wage laws should complement the role of social protection \nin supporting workers\u2019 welfare and tackling widening inequality.\n(cid:31)  Tax policies must fund social protection and counter widening income \ninequality. The actions needed, as noted above, on education and skills \ndevelopment, active labor market programs, and social protection will help \naddress worsening inequality. Funding these initiatives will require governments \nto raise more revenue. Broadening the tax base and improving tax administration \nare important, especially because government revenue is a low share of gross \ndomestic product in many Asian countries. Additionally, scope exists to make \nincome taxes more progressive and to expand receipts from taxes on capital gains, \ninheritance, and property, which will raise more revenue and narrow inequality. \n(cid:31)  New technologies can facilitate skills development, job-matching, and \nsocial protection. Machine learning and big data analytics are increasingly able \nto personalize services. Adaptive learning technology, for example, changes \nthe content taught and its sequence in response to student performance. \nThis\u00a0technique has enhanced learning outcomes in schools. New technologies \ncan improve job-matching by assessing and monitoring the evolution of \noccupations and providing users with instant feedback on what skills employers \nseek and how to acquire them, or what job is best for career growth. Finally, \ntechnological advances in biometric identi\ufb01cation can improve how social \nprotection programs function by reducing costs, overcoming implementation \nchallenges in sophisticated unemployment bene\ufb01t systems, and enabling the \ntracking of job-placement services. \n(cid:31)  Governments must ensure that new technologies develop in ways that \nbene\ufb01t people and protect their rights. Given the central role the internet \nplays in new technologies, developing a nationwide broadband backbone and \nother ICT infrastructure is essential, as is basic infrastructure for electricity \nsupply and transport. Public investments are needed to extend internet access \nto remote and lagging regions. Appropriate regulation of mobile and internet \nproviders is needed to ensure affordable services. Governments need to come \nto grips with the protection of personal data and privacy. Competition policy \nhas to evolve to ensure that large technology \ufb01rms abide by the norms of fair \ncompetition.

In the PRC, the service sector \nremained the main driver of growth in 2017 from the supply \nside, accelerating to 8.0% from 7.7% in 2016 and contributing \n4.0 percentage points to growth. Nonetheless, services \ncomprise just over 51% of GDP in the PRC, which is low by \ninternational standards. In India, services also grew by a \nhealthy 8.3%, notably passenger and cargo transport services. \nServices, particularly business service exports, remain a \nmainstay of the Indian economy.\nRecent developments in the two economies have differed \nin three ways. First are different trends in rural\u2013urban income \ndisparities. The\u00a0PRC has had some success in recent years \nin closing the rural\u2013urban income gap as rural households \nsaw real income increase faster than did urban residents \nin\u00a02017, for a ninth straight year\u2014though urban households \nstill earned 2.7\u00a0times more than their rural counterparts. ", "12\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2018\nIn India, rural wage growth slowed in 2017 as procurement \nprices in agriculture rose only sluggishly and as the effects of \ndemonetization lingered, especially affecting cash-dependent \nremote areas. With slowing rural wage growth, private \nconsumption growth in India slowed to 6.1% in 2017, the lowest \nrate in 5 years. \nThe second difference is how the trade balance affected \ngrowth. While both economies experienced signi\ufb01cant trade \ngrowth, only the PRC saw net exports increase\u2014and more than \nexpected. With price increases of nearly 23% for oil and 21% \nfor metals in 2017, incomes rose in neighboring commodity-\nproducing countries, raising their demand for PRC exports by \nmore than expected, particularly in the second half of 2017. \nBy contrast, net exports subtracted from growth in India, \nparticularly in the second half of the year. Oil imports rose by \n24% as international prices increased, but real demand was \nalso higher, particularly from \ufb01rms. In addition, demand for \nimports of gold and precious stones grew by 51.3%.\nThe third difference is the ratio of investment to GDP, \nwhich is higher than desired in the PRC and considered \ntoo low in India. In the PRC, investment still provides \nalmost 40% of GDP, which is very high by international \nstandards. Various\u00a0reforms have been applied to reduce that \nshare in recent years because the government realizes that \noverinvestment in some sectors is inefficient use of resources. \nIn 2017, \ufb01xed investment contributed 2.4 percentage points to \nGDP growth. In India, while the share of investment in GDP \nwas a healthy 31% in 2017, it could be higher.

Finally, the continued build up of private\u00a0debt in some \nregional economies since the global \ufb01nancial crisis could \nundercut growth. Developing\u00a0Asia is well\u00a0positioned to respond \nto these shocks. \nTrade risks\nRisks to trade are high on the list. As noted above, new trade \ntariffs implemented by the US to the end of March 2018 \nhave not discernibly dented buoyant trade \ufb02ows to and from \ndeveloping Asia. However, further action and retaliation \nagainst it could undermine the business and consumer \noptimism that underlies the regional outlook. \nSome countries have managed to negotiate exemptions \nfrom US steel and aluminum tariffs\u2014notably the ROK\u2014but \nthis has done little to ease heightened trade worries globally. \nTensions between the US and the PRC in particular have \nratcheted up. The US announced in 3\u00a0April\u00a02018 possible \ntariffs of 25% on more than 1,300 speci\ufb01c goods, affecting \nan estimated $50 billion a year of imports from the PRC, \nequal to 2% of PRC exports in 2017 or 0.4% of GDP. The \ntariffs overwhelmingly affect PRC exports of intermediate \ninputs, especially for renewable energy, electricity generation, \nand electrical and optical equipment. In\u00a0response, the PRC \nannounced reciprocal 25% tariffs on imports from the US that \naffect 128 categories of mainly agricultural goods, also worth \n$50\u00a0billion. Most of these tariffs will take effect in the coming \nmonths unless forestalled by a conciliatory agreement between \nBeijing and Washington. \nWhile the direct tariff costs of the announced measures \nmay be small compared with growth in trade forecast for \n2018, their disruption to supply chains could sabotage business \nexpansion plans in related industries, and uncertainty over \nthe global environment could dampen currently strong \nconsumption growth. Moreover, US \ufb01rms have strong links \nwith Asian value chains in manufacturing. Any shift of \nUS investors out of Asia would risk possibly interrupting, \ndiverting, or severing global production chains now operating \nin the region.\nStronger intraregional links may help mitigate any effects \nof rising global trade tensions. Consider the Trans-Paci\ufb01c \nPartnership. US\u00a0withdrawal in January 2017 did not, as \nsome feared, spell the end of negotiations.

Although signatories \nstill need to ratify the agreement, their intent to maintain ", "Turning strength into opportunity\u2002\u200223\nmovement toward trade openness is clear. Also, the Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership, led by the Association \nof Southeast\u00a0Asian Nations and encompassing 30% of global \nGDP and more\u00a0than 3.5\u00a0billion people, is progressing well. \nBy opening up new markets, both initiatives could dispel the \nclouds gathering over an otherwise bright horizon.\nCapital \ufb02ow risks\nA less headline-grabbing but nevertheless real risk is \ndiminishing capital in\ufb02ows if the Federal Reserve decides to \nraise interest rates faster than markets expect to keep \ufb01scal \nexpansion from overheating the US economy. The baseline \nassumption is that the Fed will gradually raise its benchmark \nrate 2 or 3 more times in 2018 to bring the midpoint of the \nfederal funds rate to about 2.1% by the end of 2018 and then \nraise it perhaps 2 more times in 2019 to reach 2.9% by the end \nof the year. This roughly aligns with market expectations. \nThe Fed raised its policy rate by a quarter point to 1.50%\u2013\n1.75% on 22 March 2018, as most market watchers expected, \nhaving predicted in\ufb02ation accelerating in the coming months. \nIf US core in\ufb02ation threatens to exceed 2%, the Fed may \nneed to enhance both the pace and the size of its policy rate \nadjustments, which could cause rapid capital out\ufb02ows from \ndeveloping Asia. \nSuch out\ufb02ows could create US dollar scarcity, possibly \nappreciating the dollar and ramping up the local currency cost \nof servicing foreign currency debt. While the \ufb01nancial effects \nof such repatriation would be unlikely to upend any economy\u2019s \nbalance of payments, it could very well mire developing Asia\u2019s \ntrade-driven growth.

In the post-crisis period, corporate debt \nstabilized while household debt decreased. Narrowing the \nfocus to the US, the dynamics of private debt were more \ndramatic, rising rapidly before the GFC and falling after, mostly \nled by household debt (Figure 1.2.2b). This is consistent with \nthe widely held view that the main cause of the GFC was a \nrapid increase in household debt under lax credit appraisal and \napproval. \nUnlike the advanced economies, emerging economies \ncontinued to accumulate private debt even after the GFC \n(Figure 1.2.2c). In Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, \nand Thailand, the four Asian economies hardest hit by the \nAsian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, the pronounced increase ", "28(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nin private debt before the earlier crisis was driven largely \nby corporate debt (Figure 1.2.2d). This is consistent with \nthe popular view that the crisis was precipitated by Asian \ncompanies borrowing heavily in foreign currency to \ufb01nance \ninvestment projects such as property that generated revenue \nonly in local currency, and that the surge of borrowing drove \ndown the quality of investment. \nIt bears noting that private debt expansion is not \nnecessarily a cause for concern in itself, especially in emerging \neconomies with immature \ufb01nancial systems. It may re\ufb02ect \nsimply the development of the national \ufb01nancial system from \na low base. Further, ease in borrowing can smooth investment \nand consumption to the bene\ufb01t of all. That said, rapid debt \naccumulation can affect growth adversely through several \nchannels. First, households and corporations may not be able \nto service their debt, undermining bank health, especially if \nloans are not backed by adequate collateral. Second, the need \nto allocate resources to pay debt service can syphon funds from \nconsumption and investment. Rising interest rates accentuate \nboth of these risks. \nThird, excessively leveraged \ufb01rms and households can \nin\ufb02ate asset prices. When the bubble bursts, banks and other \n\ufb01nancial institutions suffer a surge of bad loans and have \nto cut back on their lending, which hurts investment and \nconsumption. Because it generally takes some time for banks \nto repair their balance sheets, credit to \ufb01rms and households \nwill be disrupted for some time. Further, \ufb01rms and households \nhave to cut back on investment and consumption to repair their \nown damaged balance sheets. This is why recessions stemming \nfrom \ufb01nancial stress tend to be deeper and more persistent \nthan recessions from other causes, exacerbating volatility in \nthe business cycle. \nThe experience of the developed countries sheds light on \nhow harmful private debt buildup can be to economic growth. \nThe immediate cause of the GFC and the bad recession that \nfollowed was the rapid buildup of US private debt, which taxed \nprocedures to appraise loans for creditworthiness. The\u00a0world \neconomy has yet to recover fully from the loss of growth \nmomentum caused by that recession. \nIn light of these considerations, the ongoing escalation \nof global interest rates is putting the spotlight on the \nbuildup of private debt in Asia, in particular in Malaysia, \nthe Republic of Korea, and Thailand, where household \ndebt is large and growing, and in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, where corporate debt is fast expanding (ADB\u00a02017a). \nAlthough\u00a0developing Asia currently enjoys a positive \neconomic\u00a0outlook, rising corporate and household debt poses \nrisks to growth over\u00a0time. ", "Turning strength into opportunity(cid:29)(cid:29)29\nIntuitively, is private debt buildup  \nbad for growth?\nThe discussion above indicates that private debt buildup can \neither boost economic growth or hinder it. A positive credit \ndemand shock can result from an expectation that productivity \nor long-term income will increase, bringing subsequent output \ngrowth. The current Fourth Industrial Revolution, for example, \nis encouraging \ufb01rms to borrow and invest in potentially game-\nchanging new technologies, and it is encouraging individuals \nto borrow to invest in \ufb01rms that stand to bene\ufb01t from the \nrevolution. On the other hand, if credit supply shocks are \ndriven by lenders\u2019 irrationally exuberant expectations and \ndisregard for downside risks, debt accumulation in high-risk \nsectors eventually brings about a reversal in investor sentiment \nand subsequently harms growth. A recent example is the \nUS\u00a0subprime mortgage crisis that morphed into the GFC. \nIn sum, theoretical ambiguity renders the relationship \nbetween private debt growth and economic growth an \nempirical issue.

While the coefficients of household debt growth on \noutput growth in the same and the following\u00a0year are positive \nand statistically signi\ufb01cant, those for the third year and later \nare negative and statistically signi\ufb01cant. These\u00a0results suggest \nthat, while a buildup of household debt boosts output growth \nin the very short run, it predicts lower output growth for \n3\u00a0years starting with the fourth\u00a0year. In\u00a0contrast, no buildup of \ncorporate debt ever increased output growth, even in the short \nrun, but rather predicted lower output growth in 1\u20133\u00a0years, \nimplying that corporate debt buildup was likely a positive \nsupply shock, prompted by eager banks. While the estimated \ncoefficients of corporate debt were smaller, their negative impact \nwas comparable to that of household debt.\nThe results also indicated that, as the debt amount rose, \nthe negative impact of debt growth on output growth declined. \nYet,\u00a0in the advanced economies where the existing debt amount \nwas relatively high, further additions to debt harmed output \ngrowth in the medium term. This implied the possible existence \nof a threshold amount beyond which debt growth threatened to \nharm economic growth.\nIn emerging economies, which were generally less \ufb01nancially \ndeveloped and indebted, growth in household debt had a \nsigni\ufb01cantly positive impact on output growth in the short term, ", "32(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nbut the effect turned negative in the \ufb01fth year and persist in the \nsixth year. By contrast, corporate debt growth had a signi\ufb01cantly \nnegative impact on output growth in the \ufb01rst 4\u00a0years. \nAgain, the opposite sign of the coefficients on interaction \nterms between debt amount and debt growth suggests that \n\ufb01nancial sector development helps to stabilize the effect of debt \ngrowth on output growth. Further, in emerging markets, the \nhousehold debt amount had a negative impact on output growth \nafter 5 years but did not have any signi\ufb01cant impact in the short \nterm. On the other hand, the amount of corporate debt generally \nhad no signi\ufb01cant impact on output growth in the long run.\nThe empirical analysis further indicated that, in advanced \nand emerging economies alike, household debt was lower than \ncorporate debt but increasing slightly faster, while the annual \ngrowth rate of corporate debt was more variable.\nConcluding observations  \nand policy implications\nEvidence revealed in Park, Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) suggests \nthat the positive effect of private debt growth on output growth \nis short-lived in emerging economies, and the effect is limited to \nhousehold debt growth. In fact, the evidence indicates that the \nrelationship between both household debt growth and corporate \ndebt growth on the one hand, and economic growth on the other, \nis negative in the medium term. This strengthens the case for \npolicy makers in developing Asia to closely monitor the buildup \nof private debt, especially in light of the potential risk that debt \nbuildup poses for \ufb01nancial stability as global liquidity tightens. \nIn addition to monitoring credit developments, it could be useful \nto pursue macroprudential measures that stemmed excessive \ncredit buildup. Also useful would be early warning systems that \ncould trigger action from supervisory authorities if signs emerged \nof excessive borrowing, falling lending standards, or inability to \nservice debt. The analysis further points to the need for \ufb01nancial \nsector development as a means to alleviate the impact of private \ndebt growth on boom\u2013bust cycles. \nThese results may be controversial, but they are \ufb01rst steps \ntoward empirically examining the relationship between private \ndebt growth and output growth, an important policy issue that \nmerits further research. Park, Shin, and Tian (forthcoming) \nfocused on the quantity of debt, but the quality of debt matters at \nleast as much to \ufb01nancial stability and economic growth. If\u00a0debt \nis used to \ufb01nance unproductive activities, its effect is more likely \nto be negative. If private debt growth largely re\ufb02ects credit \nsupply shocks driven by irrationally exuberant lenders who ignore \ndownside risks, debt will build up in high-risk sectors, as it did in \nthe US housing market before the US\u00a0subprime mortgage crisis \nand in many Asian corporations before the Asian \ufb01nancial\u00a0crisis.

Job creation has \nbeen accompanied by improved productivity, rising earnings \nfor workers, and large reductions in poverty. Contributing \nto this process are shifts in employment from sectors with \nlow productivity and pay, such as agriculture, to sectors \nwith higher productivity and pay. However, a larger part of \nthe aggregate productivity gains come from sector-speci\ufb01c \nimprovements in productivity, mainly thanks to technological \nadvances such as high-yielding crop varieties in farming, \nmodern machine tools in manufacturing, and information and \ncommunication technology in services.1\nThe jobs challenge is far from over. From 2015 to 2030, the \nlabor force in developing Asia is projected to increase by about \n11 million per year. So Asia needs more jobs but also better \njobs. The broad contours of action and policy needed to meet \nthe jobs challenge are well known: timely and appropriate \ninvestments in education, infrastructure, and research and \ndevelopment, as well as a policy framework emphasizing \nmacroeconomic stability, openness to trade and foreign \ndirect investment, and an investment climate conducive to \nbusiness (ADB 2015a, 2017a). However, concern is growing \nthat some elements of this framework will no longer improve \nlabor market outcomes for many workers. Paradoxically, the \nconcern stems from the fundamental driver of human progress \nthroughout history: technological change. \nThis chapter was written by Elisabetta Gentile, Rana Hasan, and Sameer Khatiwada, \nall in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, with \ntechnical support from Donald Jay Bertulfo, Erik Jan Eleazar, John Paul Flaminiano, \nPia\u00a0Marie Medrano, Rhea Molato, Orlee Velarde, and Mia Kim Veloso.

In particular, the \ngrowing sophistication of robotics and AI raise the possibility \nof unprecedented automation and displacement of labor. \nIn\u00a0apparel and footwear manufacturing, for example, \n\u201cworkerless factories\u201d are being tested using completely \nautomated production. In services, it is becoming technically \nfeasible to automate more complex tasks in occupations \nsuch\u00a0as customer support. How will new technologies affect \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia\u2019s ability to generate more and better jobs? \nThis is the central question of this chapter. Considering \nthe many\u00a0uncertainties that arise in any analysis of a nascent \nand rapidly evolving phenomenon, the question is addressed \nthrough several exercises that together shed light on how the \nrelationship between technology and jobs will likely play out \nin the region. The exercises are embedded within an analytical \nframework that clari\ufb01es the different channels through which \ntechnology affects jobs. Moreover, they focus on different \naspects of technology and capture their effects in various ways, \nsome more direct than others. Thus, while some exercises look \nat the effects of automation through, for example, the adoption \nof industrial robots in manufacturing, others take a broader \nview of technology and capture its effects through more \nefficient production or distribution of goods and services along \nthe global supply chain.\nThe analysis concludes that several forces will likely work \nagainst the pervasive job displacement that some predict. \nIn\u00a0the\u00a0\ufb01rst\u00a0place, the economic feasibility of automating \nin many parts of Asia today lags technological feasibility, \nleaving the adoption of\u00a0the latest laborsaving technologies \nsome ways\u00a0off. Perhaps most importantly, higher productivity \nwill generate more demand for novel goods and services, \nproviding a powerful countervailing force to automation-driven \ndisplacement of labor. Moreover, technological advances and \neconomic growth will generate new occupations and industries, \nfurther contributing to job\u00a0growth.\nClearly, though, new technologies and automation will \nimpose hardships on some workers. Several types of jobs will \nbe lost. While new ones will appear, they will require skills \nthat workers do not yet possess, and they may arise in locations \nremoved from the homes of displaced workers. Low\u00a0wage \ngrowth and higher unemployment among the less-skilled \ncould become, alongside other causes of income inequality, \na feature of labor markets if governments fail to take action. \nAccordingly, this chapter looks at the implications for public \npolicy, especially on education and skills development, and on \nlabor regulations and social protection systems, while touching \non other topics.

Similarly, the use of modern machine tools \nsuch as numerically controlled lathes in manufacturing, and \nof information and communication technology in services, has \nbeen crucial in raising factory and office productivity, allowing \nbetter wages for workers.\nHowever, concern is growing that the very latest \ntechnologies could prove to be disruptive for workers, \ndisplacing jobs without creating nearly enough new ones. \nThis\u00a0could be particularly problematic for countries with a lot \nof young workers.

To the \nextent that increased demand requires hiring more \nworkers, it could offset the displacement effect from \nautomation.\n(iii) Reinstatement effect.Automation can spawn new \nlabor-intensive tasks and jobs, raising demand for \nlabor. New job categories could emerge as AI is \nintroduced into production, for example, or when a \nmore sophisticated industrial robot is introduced on a \nfactory \ufb02oor and needs programming or tending. \nCross-industry effects. Adopting new technology in \none industry has an impact on productivity and jobs in \nother\u00a0industries. There are two main channels through which \ncross-industry effects change labor demand.\n(i) Spillover effect. As one industry adopts new \ntechnology, positive spillover affects other industries \nin at least three ways. First, \ufb01rms in downstream ", "64(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nindustries bene\ufb01t from cheaper and/or better-quality \ninputs, while \ufb01rms in upstream industries bene\ufb01t \nif the output of the automating industry expands. \nSecond, other industries learn the bene\ufb01ts of adopting \nthe new technology. Third, workers with new skills \nand knowledge move between industries, spreading \ntechnological know-how.\n(ii) Income effect. When technology complements labor, \nworkers\u2019 higher incomes create positive spillover on \nother industries through increased demand for goods \nand services. A software developer whose income \nhas increased thanks to complementarity between \nautomation and human labor, for example, may want \nto buy a bigger car, a faster computer, better health \ncare, more vacations, or other leisure services. \nAggregate impact on employment. Still other factors in\ufb02uence \nhow technology affects jobs.\n(i) Complementarity between labor and technology.\nIf workers carry out tasks that are complemented \nby automation, demand for such workers will likely \nincrease, as will their wages. If workers perform tasks \nthat can be done solely by machines, they are likely \nto be displaced. That said, the technical feasibility \nof automating a set of tasks does not necessarily \nmake automation economically viable. The price of \nnew technology relative to labor cost is a crucial \ndeterminant of whether automation takes place. \n(ii) Elasticity of labor supply. An example would \nbe a within-industry effect with technology \ncomplementing human labor. Even if demand for \ntasks supplied by a software developer rises, there \ncan be no signi\ufb01cant change in employment unless \nthere is an adequate supply of appropriately skilled \nworkers. Assuming labor supply is not very elastic, \nwages earned by software developers and researchers \ntend to rise, which incentivizes more workers to enter \nthose jobs. However, high labor supply elasticity\u2014an \nabundance of workers with the requisite training as a \nsoftware developer\u2014could mitigate wage gains. \n(iii) Demand response to income elasticity. Rising \nincomes in one industry create demand for goods \nand services in other parts of the economy, but \nthis depends on how responsive demand is to \nincreased income. Consider again the example of \nsoftware developers whose labor is complemented by \nautomation. How much of the increase in wages are \nthey willing to spend on goods and services supplied \nby other sectors? The answer will help determine \nemployment and wages in the other sectors.", "How technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)65\n(iv) Workforce skills. To take advantage of automation and \nnew types of tasks created in the economy, workforce \nskills need to match technological requirements. New \ntasks require new skills, and education and training \nare key. A mismatch between skills and technologies \nslows the adjustment of employment and wages, \nhindering productivity growth. \nIndeed, careful investigation of time series data spanning \nmany decades shows these forces at play, countering the job \ndisplacement effects that arise when new technologies allow a \ngiven output to be produced by fewer workers (Box 2.1.2).\n2.1.2\u2002Productivity and employment: different forces at play \nBessen (2017), an analysis of employment data spanning  sheds light on interindustry linkages and final demand \ndecades, powerfully illustrates the idea that laborsaving  effects (Autor and Salomons 2017).

Three empirical exercises are conducted to back this \nstatement. \nFirst, this section examines trends in Asia\u2019s robot usage and \nshows that robots tend to be concentrated in capital-intensive and \nhigh-wage industries. A key point is that, even if it is technically \nfeasible to replace a job with machines, it may not be economically \nfeasible. \nSecond, analysis of the relationship between technology and \nemployment in global value chains provides further insight into \nhow various forces have affected jobs and will shape their future. \nDecomposition of employment changes from 2005 to 2015 using \na demand-based input\u2013output approach is instructive about \nhow different forces affect job numbers, types, and locations in \nglobal value chains. While the technologies needed for extreme \nautomation are only just starting to appear, advances such as \ncomputer numerically controlled machines and modern ICT \ntools were already coming online in factories and \ufb01rms in Asia \nover the period covered. Two results stand out: Rising demand, \nspurred by improved efficiency or labor productivity, more \nthan compensates for technology-induced displacement of jobs. \nFurther,\u00a0any\u00a0\u201creshoring\u201d of production to advanced economies may \nnot be a major threat to employment in developing Asia. \nThird, this section examines changes in occupation titles, which \nshow that advances in technology have created new jobs. This is a \nprominent countervailing force against the displacement effect of \ntechnology (Lin 2011).

In manufacturing, the most affected occupations are \nroutine manual\u2014typically blue-collar workers without college \ndegrees.

However, results vary by skills group, \nwith robotics reducing hours worked and wages for low- and \nmiddle-skilled workers, but having had no signi\ufb01cant effect on \nhigh-skilled workers. \nSo, simple correlation between robot density and \nemployment growth yields a somewhat ambiguous picture. \nWhen jobs are divided into routine and not, however, routine \nemployment negatively correlates with robot density, while \nnonroutine employment positively correlates (Figure\u00a02.2.3). \nEmpirical analysis corroborates these descriptive trends.\nIndeed, there is no signi\ufb01cant relationship between \nadopting robots and overall employment (Table 2.2.1a). But \nwhen robot adoption is disaggregated by type of employment, \nthe relationship is different: Routine employment decreases \nwith the increased usage of robots, while nonroutine \nemployment increases (Table 2.2.1b).

Production units can be nearby or located \nanywhere on the globe, and labor contributes to virtually every \ntask along the chain. Two additional factors have made this \nunbundling possible: trade liberalization and lower transport \ncosts through improved logistics, infrastructure, and transport \ntechnology. This process redistributed global economic activity, \nwith Asian economies emerging as key players. In\u00a02016, Asia\u2019s \nGVC participation, measured as the share of gross exports of \nvalue added used for further processing through cross-border \nproduction networks, was 61.1% (ADB\u00a02017b). This was second \nonly to the European Union.", "How technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)73\nGVCs signi\ufb01cantly affect employment in participating \neconomies. Changes in the structure of GVCs, in particular \nthose caused by new technology, have corresponding effects on \nemployment. Developing economies that boost production for the \nexport market often see a signi\ufb01cant increase in manufacturing \njobs. In\u00a0Bangladesh, for example, the emergence of GVC-oriented \ngarment exports has created more than 3 million new jobs over the \npast 2 decades (Farole and Cho 2017). In\u00a0most low-cost, routine, \nlabor-intensive GVCs such as garments, footwear, and electronics, \nthe\u00a0largest employment share is occupied by young women, many of \nthem newcomers to the workforce.\nGVCs have made it easier for developing economies to adopt \nnew technologies. For example, technologies developed in high-\nincome economies, such as numerically controlled machines and \nmodern ICT tools, are used by factories and \ufb01rms all along GVCs. \nArguably, business use of ICT has been a boon for women in the \nlabor market (Box 2.2.3).\nWhile new technologies improve productivity, they raise \ntwo main concerns for developing economies. First, extreme \nautomation can have signi\ufb01cant implications for\u00a0jobs. As Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution technologies such as digital manufacturing \nbecome more sophisticated and cost-effective, \ufb01rms in developing \neconomies could lose many jobs if reshoring production back to \nadvanced economies becomes feasible. In fact, however, if the cost \nof new technologies lowers signi\ufb01cantly, it is conceivable that \ufb01rms \nin developing economies may use them too.\nSecond, to the extent that upgrading technology is skill-biased, \nit shifts demand from workers with lower skills to those with higher \nskills, widening inequality. This poses a problem for developing \neconomies competitive in low- to medium-skill activities, as using \nadvanced technology could create a shortage of high-skilled workers \nand surplus of medium- and low-skilled workers.\nCombining multiregional input\u2013output tables developed by \nthe Asian Development Bank with employment data from labor \nforce surveys4 allows research that examines the relationship \nbetween technology and jobs along supply chains in 12 economies \nin developing Asia, covering 35 sectors from 2005 to 2015.5\nThe\u00a012\u00a0economies accounted for 90% of employment in developing \nAsia in 2015.6 In the tables, a GVC is de\ufb01ned by \ufb01nal products \nproduced by a particular industry in a particular economy. \nFor\u00a0example, \u201ctextiles and textile products \ufb01nalized in the PRC\u201d is \nconsidered a GVC that encompasses a wide range of \ufb01nal products, \nfrom garments to awnings and canopies (Timmer et al. 2014).\nThe analytical framework developed in Reijnders and de Vries \n(2017) is used to analyze changes in demand for jobs by modeling \nthe input\u2013output structure of the world economy.

Third, GVC employment is in\ufb02uenced \nby conditions in the economy and globally, such as total demand \nfor goods and services and changes in consumer preferences.", "How technology affects jobs(cid:30)(cid:30)75\nStructural decomposition analysis (SDA) of the \nmultiregional input\u2013output tables achieves two objectives. \nFirst, it quanti\ufb01es changes in labor demand associated with \ntechnological change and task relocation. Second, it examines \nthe relative magnitude of these GVC-speci\ufb01c channels with \nrespect to conditions globally and within an economy. \nThe decomposition of change in an economy\u2019s number of \njobs from 2005 to 2015 occurs on two levels (Figure 2.2.4). \nAt\u00a0the \ufb01rst level, the change in employment is decomposed into \nchange within the GVC, or changes in employment within the \nproduction structure or GVC of a speci\ufb01c \ufb01nal product, and \nchange between GVCs, or changes in employment resulting \nfrom shifts in consumer demand for different products. \nIf,\u00a0for\u00a0example, consumers suddenly spend more on electronics \nthan garments, there will be greater demand for employment \nin the electronics production chain and less in the garments \nchain. Finally, income refers to changes in employment caused \nby changes in global demand for goods and services. In \npractice, higher income in real terms will increase demand for \ngoods and services, which in turn will increase employment.\nThe SDA further decomposes the within-GVC channel \ninto (i) technology within the GVC, or changes in employment \nassociated with changes in efficiency within a speci\ufb01c GVC; \n(ii)\u00a0task relocation, or changes in employment as the location \nchanges for one production task or more; and (iii) country-level \nefficiency, or changes in employment from efficiency changes in \nthe economy.7\nThe GVC for garments in the PRC is used to illustrate \nhow to operationalize technology within the GVC and \ntask relocation. If machines replace workers at one or \nmore of the production tasks in the GVC, this will lower \nthe number of jobs in the GVC needed to meet given \ndemand. This channel is labeled \u201ctechnology within GVCs.\u201d \nIf\u00a0PRC\u00a0garment manufacturers decide to relocate one or \nmore of the production tasks to Thailand, the jobs for \nthose tasks will be lost in the PRC and gained in Thailand. \n2.2.4\u2002Decomposing changes in labor demand\nTechnology Own country\nChange\nTask relocation Within GVC Income\nin Employment\nRest of the world\nBetween GVC\nFirst level Second level\nGVC = global value chain.\nSource: Based on Reijnders and de Vries (2017).", "76(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nAssuming\u00a0other\u00a0factors\u00a0are\u00a0constant\u2014for example, workers \nin the PRC and Thailand are equally productive\u2014the total \nnumber of jobs in the GVC is unchanged, but fewer workers \nare employed in the PRC and more in Thailand.

It bypasses the formidable \ndifficulty of examining the employment implications of \nspeci\ufb01c technological innovations. As noted in Autor and \nSalomons (2017), the diversity of speci\ufb01c innovations de\ufb01es \nboth consistent classi\ufb01cation and comprehensive measurement. \nIn\u00a0the model presented here, countrywide economic conditions, \nwhich would include the effects of improved economic \ninstitutions or rising educational attainment, are captured \nby country-level efficiency, while technology within the GVC \ntranscends national boundaries and captures technological \nadvances along a speci\ufb01c production chain.\nFinally, the second stage of the SDA further decomposes \nthe income channel into \u201cown country,\u201d or demand for goods \nand services originating within a speci\ufb01c country, and \u201crest \nof the world,\u201d or demand from abroad for goods and services. \nThe purpose is to see what fraction of employment depends on \ndomestic demand and what fraction foreign demand.\nThis analysis has two outliers. During 2005\u20132015, the \nglobal commodities bust hit hard in Mongolia, an economy \nheavily reliant on mining, causing a major decline in \nemployment in services.

The taxonomy developed in Autor, Levy, \nand Murnane (2003), which classi\ufb01es occupations as routine manual, \nroutine cognitive, nonroutine manual, and nonroutine cognitive, \nallows for an SDA of changes in employment by occupation type. \nUnfortunately, this exercise is not possible for agricultural employment \nbecause it is difficult to distinguish routine and nonroutine occupations \nin the sector.\nThe results of the SDA by occupation type are presented in \nFigure\u00a02.2.6 for manufacturing and services. The trends are the same \nas in Figure 2.2.5, but changes in employment are distributed across \noccupation types. It can be observed on the left that technology \nchange within a GVC correlates with lower employment across \ncountries and occupation types in both manufacturing and services. \nHowever, the decrease in nonroutine employment, especially \nnonroutine cognitive employment, is less pronounced than for routine \nemployment. Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet\u00a0Nam even show an \nincrease in nonroutine employment in services. The \ufb01ndings suggest \nthat technological advances along the supply chain may have been \nskill-biased in 2005\u20132015. This should not be surprising, as modern \nmachine tools and ICT have been used in production for some time.\nIt can be observed on the right that task relocation in \nmanufacturing appears to have a positive effect on nonroutine \nemployment as well. In India, Indonesia, and the PRC, task relocation \nis associated with increases in nonroutine occupations, both cognitive \nand manual (Box 2.2.5). Bangladesh and Thailand show increases \nin nonroutine manual occupations, and Malaysia shows an increase \nin\u00a0nonroutine cognitive occupations. In\u00a0services (excluding outliers in \nthe Philippines and Viet Nam), changes in employment are generally \nvery small and mixed.\nNew technology pushing up the share of nonroutine jobs\nThe analysis above quanti\ufb01es the prevalence of routine and nonroutine \nemployment. In Figure 2.2.7, the focus shifts to employment shares. \nIn general, the magnitude of the change in employment share for \nmanufacturing is smaller and more uniform than for services, which \nhave more diverse dynamics. An\u00a0increased employment share of \nnonroutine cognitive occupations accompanies technological advances \nwithin the GVC (Figure 2.2.7a). For\u00a0nonroutine manual occupations, \nroughly half the economies show increased employment share, the \nrest decreased. Finally, the change in employment share for both \nroutine cognitive and routine manual occupations associated with \nnew technology is decidedly negative for manufacturing and mainly \nnegative for services. These results follow from Figure 2.2.6, which \nshows that, although the impact of technological advances is generally \na reduction in both routine and nonroutine jobs (conditional on their \nsatisfying the same demand), it is larger for routine jobs.

Indeed, that \nreshoring did not happen in 2005\u20132015 does not mean it will not \nhappen in the near future.\nTo determine how dependent employment in developing Asia is \non \ufb01nal demand from advanced economies, the approach adopted \nin Los, Timmer, and de Vries (2015) is used.

However, bearing in \nmind that reshoring aims to move production closer to customers \nand thereby shorten the time required to get a product to market, \nlower production costs, and improve efficiency, it is noteworthy that \nconsumer markets in advanced economies are increasingly saturated, \neven as demand from Asia\u2019s expanding middle class increases. \nFigure\u00a02.2.8 shows that, while the share of jobs servicing \ufb01nal \ndemand from the rest of the world is only 7% in the 12 economies as \na whole, it is well over 20% in Malaysia; Taipei,China; and Thailand. \nMarkets in the rest of the world have a high potential for growth \nas well, such that the importance of \ufb01nal demand from advanced \ncountries to employment in developing countries will likely decline \nover time.\nEmergence of new occupations  \nand new industries\nOne of the less-appreciated channels through which technology \naffects the labor market is its creation of new occupations and \nentirely new industries with new jobs.

Analysis of \nIndia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam shows the \nemployment structure in the region shifting toward jobs intensive in \nnonroutine cognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks. These\u00a0tasks \ngenerally complement technological progress and may\u00a0not be readily \nautomated. They tend to require more education and/or relatively \nadvanced training. At the same time, the labor market is moving \naway from jobs intensive in manual tasks, which tend to require \nskills that workers with basic education can acquire. Such\u00a0jobs are \nmore likely to be replaced by machines. The magnitude of these \nchanges in the past decade or so is sizable, and the trend will \nlikely persist. The major challenge for Asian economies is to cope \nwith this structural transformation in the nature of jobs. If\u00a0Asia\u2019s \nworkers are not given the skills in demand\u2014particularly to \ufb01ll jobs \nintensive in nonroutine and cognitive tasks\u2014they may be left behind. \nIncomes\u00a0for the few with the required skills will rise, exacerbating \ninequality.\nTrends in employment and wages  \nby task intensity in the region\nFive indicators here describe the intensity with which workers are \nrequired to perform various types of tasks. Four of them pertain \nto nonroutine cognitive, social interactive, routine cognitive, and \nmanual tasks.8 A \ufb01fth indicator, for ICT tasks, describes computer \nuse at work to capture jobs intensive in tasks that may directly \ncomplement new technologies. The\u00a0methodology used to construct \nthese indicators is presented in Box 2.3.1. Task\u00a0intensity can be \nmeasured, making it possible to examine the task-biased technical \nchange hypothesis: Technological progress and information \ntechnology (IT) will likely displace jobs consisting of mainly routine \nand manual tasks while increasing demand for jobs that involve \na lot of abstract and complex cognitive tasks. Occupations and \nindustries in which workers are frequently required to provide \nadvice, teach, or negotiate, among other tasks, score high in \nsocial interaction, while high scores in the complex or nonroutine \ncognitive indicator indicate high intensity in tasks such as writing, \nusing advanced mathematics, or solving complex problems.

The growth \ndifference between jobs with high and low task intensity means \nthat employment is shifting toward occupations and industries \nrequiring high cognitive, social, and ICT task intensity. This is \nconsistent with relatively slow growth in demand for manual \nwork and for work not intensive in the use of congnitive, social, \nand ICT skills. \nIn some countries, the shift in employment across job \ntypes has been substantial. From 2000 to 2014, more than \n25% of Indonesian workers shifted into jobs intensive in social \ninteraction, 20% migrated to high-intensive jobs in nonroutine \ncognitive tasks, and 17% moved away from high-intensive \nmanual jobs. Similarly in Thailand, 18% of those employed \nshifted into high-intensive ICT jobs within just 10 years. \nTo properly compare the speed of these changes across \neconomies, the growth rate of the share of jobs with high \nintensity across task types is annualized, which is much like \ncomparing employment growth in these jobs with growth in \ntotal employment (Figure 2.3.2). The speed of change varies \nby the type of task and worker. The categories nonroutine \ncognitive, social interaction, and ICT show that changes are \noccurring faster in higher-income Asian economies considered \nhere. Thailand stands out when both wage and self-employed \nworkers are considered, for example, and Indonesia for wage \nworkers alone. In particular, Thai growth in employment in \nhigh-intensive jobs in these three categories has outpaced \nthat of total employment by 4.7 percentage points on average. \nLess\u00a0dramatic shifts have occurred in the Philippines and \nViet\u00a0Nam. However, the mean speed of change is considerable. \nEach\u00a0year, growth in Asian employment in jobs intensive in \nICT, social interaction, and nonroutine cognitive tasks is on \naverage 2.6 percentage points faster than overall employment. \nHow have wages evolved across job types?

", "100(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nThe role of government in \nharnessing technology for workers\nWhile new technology remains central to creating productive \njobs, there are some concerns from a worker\u2019s perspective. \nThe\u00a0previous section showed that job prospects for occupations \nintensive in cognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks will \nlikely expand, while those intensive in manual tasks will \nlikely shrink. Given the smaller supply of workers pro\ufb01cient in \ncognitive, social interaction, and ICT tasks, it is not surprising \nthat wage increases have been higher in these occupations. \nIf the trend persists, inequality in the region will continue \nto deepen (ADB 2012). The worst case would see the wages \nof less-skilled workers hardly increase at all, which is what \nhappened in the developed economies of today during the \ufb01rst \nindustrial revolution. Then, the average wage of workers barely \nincreased over several decades despite a dramatic increase in \nlabor productivity in manufacturing (Bessen 2015).9\nThe other major issue is labor displacement. Disruption \naffecting particular types of occupations, industries, and \ufb01rms \nwill render some of their workers unemployed, unless and until \nthey acquire the skills needed for emerging occupations and \nindustries. The process is neither easy nor cheap.\nThis section presents various options on how policy \nmakers can deal with these issues. First, education and skills \ndevelopment systems will need to equip Asian workers with the \nskills required to \ufb01ll the jobs generated by new technologies. \nSecond, labor regulations and social protection systems must \nbe designed to protect worker incomes, even as \ufb01rms retain \n\ufb02exibility to adjust workplace practices and job numbers as \neconomic conditions change. Finally, policy on taxes and \nexpenditure will need to ensure sufficient resources for \neducation and skills development and for social protection, and \nthey should bring about more equitable income distribution. \nEducation and skills development\nDespite tremendous progress in expanding access to education, \nskills gaps remain a concern across developing Asia. More \nthan 100 million children of primary and secondary school \nage are not in school, and many more leave school without \nbasic literacy and numeracy. This has ripple effects on their \nemployment prospects and widens skills gaps in the labor \nmarket. In 2016, 46% of employers in Asia and the Paci\ufb01c \nreported difficulty in \ufb01lling vacancies for skilled positions \n(ManpowerGroup 2016). ", "How technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)101\nAsymmetric information aggravates skills gaps and \nmismatches. Educational curricula often misalign with labor \nmarket needs, while education and training programs are \ntypically slow to adapt to changes in skills demand. Although \nworkers may want to acquire new skills, they often do not \nknow what skills employers want or their own employment or \nearnings prospects. Employers, for their part, consider training \na risky investment because newly trained employees may leave \nthe company, perhaps leveraging their newly acquired skills. \nThis creates a vicious cycle of employers looking to hire those \nalready with the needed skills while jobseekers do not know \nthe skills they need and have no opportunity to learn them \non\u00a0the job.\nEven when individuals have the right skillsets for certain \ntypes of jobs, they may struggle to connect with the right \nemployer. Progress is being made in matching jobseekers with \npotential employers thanks to the diffusion of recruitment \nportals. No longer relying solely on personal networks, \njobseekers can now learn about hundreds of vacancies and \ntheir skills requirements. So far, these portals bene\ufb01t mainly \nurban mid- to high-skilled workers, but they are expanding \nrapidly. In Indonesia, for example, the networking platform \nLinkedIn doubled its users from 4 million to 8 million between \n2015 and 2017, with 70% of new users in the 25\u201344 age group.\nThe big challenge facing Asia and the Paci\ufb01c today is to \nimprove learning outcomes and to prepare for a structural \ntransformation of the economy and the workplace. The good \nnews is that technology, having contributed to the problem, \ncan\u00a0offer solutions.\nFoundational skills in a technology-driven economy\nA technology-driven economy makes it more important \nthan ever to learn how to relearn. Solid foundational skills \ncontinue to be a crucial prerequisite to further learning. \nTraditionally, foundational skills included basic reading, \nwriting, and numeracy, but they have grown to encompass \ntwo more categories: social and emotional skills, and digital \nliteracy (Figure 2.4.1). These skills build on each other to \npromote further learning (Acosta et al. 2017, Durlak et al. 2011, \nOECD\u00a02013b).

However, learning how to do \nresearch\u2014to make sense of and analyze digital content\u2014is now \nas essential as basic reading and writing skills (OECD 2016b).\nBeyond hardware, two elements are fundamental to \nsuccessful digital literacy programs (World Bank 2016). \nFirst, such programs are more effective when embedded in \nmainstream learning. Standalone programs are less effective \nbecause they do not contextualize the use of technology. \nThis requires adapting curricula and learning materials for \ntraditional subjects to integrate digital technologies. Second, \nteachers must train to adapt pedagogical practices and \nunderstand how to use digital technologies to support learning. \nMany programs have failed because they focused on hardware \nuse, with inadequate attention to teacher training.\nSocial and emotional skills affect a range of individual \noutcomes, including learning, employment trajectories, health, \nand overall life satisfaction. De\ufb01nitions and terminology vary, \nbut social and emotional skills are generally understood as \nskills \u201cinvolved in achieving goals, working with others, and \nmanaging emotions\u201d (OECD 2015). They include behavioral \ntraits such as perseverance, self-control, and resilience, as \nwell as such social skills as interacting effectively with others. \nThese skills are malleable, particularly from early childhood to \nadolescence, and therefore can best be taught and strengthened \nthrough childhood education.\nRecognizing that different types of foundational skills \nbuild on one another, pedagogical approaches are now \nevolving to develop these skills in tandem. For example, \nmany schools are now encouraging students to adopt a \n\u201cgrowth mindset.\u201d The\u00a0concept is based on the idea that one\u2019s \nskills are not inherent but can be developed through effort, \ncommitment, good learning strategies, and support from others \n(Dweck\u00a02007).

A similar \nprinciple is often used in educational software, especially \nthrough the gami\ufb01cation of learning, which relies on trial and \nerror and on learning by doing.\nLeveraging new technologies  \nto build foundational skills\nEducational technology and e-learning are rapidly growing \nglobally, not least in Asia. With some 600 million young \nstudents increasingly connected and eager to use game- \nand social-based learning, new services and products are \n\ufb02ooding the region. Interest in mobile learning is growing as \nsmartphone usage increases.\nThese initiatives, driven by global and Asian information \ntechnology startups, are changing the education landscape. \nSome are developing initiatives removed from traditional \neducational arenas, while others are developing tools and \nservices for educators and learners to use in school or at home. \nOne challenge for educators is to determine how best to work \nwith these technology-led businesses to improve learning \noutcomes cost-efficiently and effectively.\nTechnology can contribute to foundational skills in several \nways. It provides new content to users, thus improving access \nto learning and teaching resources. Importantly, it contributes \nto changing pedagogical practices, ushering in an era of \nlearning that is more student-centered.\nSoftware that enables self-paced learning and that \ntailors teaching to individual students is an important new \ntrend. In its simplest form, self-paced learning occurs when \nstudents progress at their own speed through a learning \nprogram, some moving faster than others toward more \ncomplex material. Adaptive software takes this a step further, \ndirecting students through individualized learning pathways. \nFor\u00a0example, students having more difficulty than others with \na particular concept are given more detailed explanations and \nmore exercises for practice. Further, the software forwards \nindividualized data to teachers so they can target speci\ufb01c \nstudents for additional tutoring or more advanced teaching. \nThis promotes more inclusive learning cost-effectively. Progress \nin machine learning and arti\ufb01cial intelligence will make this \ntype of software more sophisticated. As it disseminates, it will \nchange the role of educators from teacher\u00a0to mentor.\nJob-relevant skills in a technology-driven economy\nJob-relevant skills are of two types. Transversal skills, which \nare transferable across occupations and sectors, include \ninterpersonal skills, the ability to think critically, and the \nability to solve problems.

Specialized skills, by contrast, \nrelate to a particular occupation (such as teaching), task \n(coding), or knowledge area (anthropology). They are typically \nacquired through technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET), higher education, and work experience. \nSpecialized skills are likely to depreciate quickly, particularly \nin a time of fast-evolving technology, and thus require \nregular updating and upgrading. With more automation and \nmachine learning, higher-order specialized skills applicable to \nnonroutine tasks will be particularly valuable.\nTVET and higher education systems alike face a complex \nset of challenges. They must expand to accommodate the rising \nnumber of graduates, as well as adults seeking to upgrade their \nskills or retrain. At the same time, they need to improve the \nrelevance of the training and education they provide to respond \nto fast-changing labor market demand.\nStronger links between TVET and higher education can \nbring progress toward this goal. To better respond to labor \nmarket demand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, for example, \nis transforming many of its universities into polytechnics, \nand Indonesia is expanding its network of polytechnics. \nCredit\u00a0transfer systems are developing to enable TVET \ngraduates to pursue higher education\u2014allowing, for example, a \ntechnician to become an engineer\u2014and a university student to \nchoose a more vocationally oriented track. This is an important \nstep toward expanding skillsets in the whole workforce. \nHowever, these efforts must be embedded in a comprehensive \napproach that provides opportunities for experienced workers \nto upgrade their skills. It involves, for instance, a framework \nfor recognizing prior learning and developing programs for \nworking adults.\nStrengthening linkages between \ufb01rms, universities, and \nvocational schools is essential to make higher education and \nTVET systems more responsive to technological change. \nTraditional approaches remain relevant, such as involving \nindustry partners in the design and delivery of TVET programs \nand promoting workplace learning. New technologies provide \nopportunities for deeper and broader partnerships. Online \ncollaborative platforms, for example, can facilitate development \nof joint projects, including applied research, between schools \nand enterprises.\nLeveraging new technologies for job-relevant skills \nand learning to relearn\nMachine learning and big data analysis can help assess and \nmore closely monitor in real time the evolution of occupations \nand their task content and required skillsets.

As Asia and the Paci\ufb01c \nbecome better connected, these services can improve labor \nmarket intermediation and address the problem of asymmetric \ninformation.\nWith fast-evolving technology rapidly depleting skills, \nlearning to relearn is becoming the new normal. A major \nimplication of lifelong learning is that education and training \nhave to be interwoven with full-time work, so content must \nbe provided in a format that is short, convenient, and mobile. \nShorter online education and training programs are emerging \nin response to this growing demand. So-called \u201cnanodegrees\u201d \nwere developed following the mixed results of massive open \nonline courses. These nanodegrees develop skillsets for targeted \nprofessions, incorporating user experience and acknowledging \nthe need to transform content to make it as easy as possible \nto assimilate.

Because digital technologies in particular allow \nsome types of work to be done remotely, they have great \npotential to accelerate the rise of part-time, on-call, or \ntemporary employment\u2014arrangements the International \nLabour Organization calls nonstandard forms of employment. \nWhile such forms grant employers \ufb02exibility and allow workers \nto pursue new opportunities in the labor market, perhaps while \nreconciling work with the demands of home life, they often \noffer little job security. For some workers it can mean cycling \nbetween short-term jobs and unemployment beset by worries \nover when they will next \ufb01nd work and be paid. Such workers \nmay also have meager social security coverage and face greater \noccupational safety and health risks. Finally, they are less likely \nto join a union.

By extension, labor regulation \nincludes the social protection elements most often tied to work \nsuch as health care, income replacement when a job is lost, \nand help in \ufb01nding a new job through information and other \nsupport from public and private sources.\nThe key policy challenge today is that labor regulations and \nsocial protection systems now current globally were designed \nfor an era when the expected norm was full-time employment \nwith a single company over the long term.

The prospect of a worker remaining in one job \nwith a single employer over the long term looks less and less \nlikely for large groups of workers. \nWhile a detailed examination of current labor regulations \nand social protection systems\u2014and how they need to evolve\u2014\nis\u00a0beyond the scope of this chapter, the concept of \u201cprotected \nmobility\u201d seems an appropriate guiding principle (Auer 2005). \nA central aspect of this is to ensure that a highly mobile \nlabor market\u2014and one dealing out more frequent spells of \nunemployment\u2014has mechanisms that protect worker incomes. \nFirst, labor regulations must avoid two extremes: one that \nleaves workers with too little protection, and the other that \nimposes high labor costs that only encourage \ufb01rms to automate. \nUsing cross-country panel data on manufacturing industries, \nHasan, Mitra, and Sundaram (2013) found more restrictive \nlabor regulations associated with higher capital intensity in \nmanufacturing, especially in developing economies and in \nsectors that either require more frequent labor adjustment or, \nlike garments and footwear, are labor intensive and employ \nmore unskilled workers.\nSecond, at a time when job security will likely erode, any \ntemptation to restrict job dismissals through blunt means \nmust be avoided. The Centre for Business Research Labour \nIndex database at the University of Cambridge, which covers \n22 economies in developing Asia, reports that employers \nmust obtain prior permission from the state to dismiss an \nindividual in India, Indonesia, and, since 2008, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Such requirements can make layoffs very \ncumbersome and costly for \ufb01rms, effectively raising the cost \nof hiring labor in the \ufb01rst place. In general, policy makers \nshould be guided by the principle of protecting workers rather ", "How technology affects jobs(cid:29)(cid:29)107\nthan protecting\u00a0jobs. In developing countries, transitioning \nworkers to more productive sectors and \ufb01rms, especially from \ninformal to formal employment, is essential to creating good \njobs. Theory and evidence both support the conclusion that \nrestricting dismissals undermines workers\u2019 welfare when a \nbetter alternative is severance pay or unemployment insurance \n(Ranjan, Hasan, and Eleazar, 2018).\nThird, even severance pay has its drawbacks as workers \nenter periods of unemployment.10 Policy makers, especially \nin middle-income countries, should consider unemployment \ninsurance tailored to developing country circumstances. \nSuch systems can function alongside more traditional public \nworks programs, such as India\u2019s Mahatma Gandhi National \nRural Employment Guarantee Act, which provides to the \nneedy 100 days of wage employment annually on public \nworks. Worldwide, and especially in advanced economies, \nunemployment insurance systems more effectively \nprovide adequate income protection without imposing \nlarge efficiency costs (Vodopivec 2013). The catch is that \nsuch unemployment insurance systems are demanding, \nboth \ufb01nancially and administratively. They\u00a0therefore \nneed to be tailored to the developing economy capacities \n(Box\u00a02.4.1). Fortunately,\u00a0digital\u00a0technologies allow biometric \nidenti\ufb01cation, as in India\u2019s Aadhaar system, initiated in \n2008 and now covering 1.2 billion people. As they also allow \ndigitized administrative records that can be shared securely \nand accurately, they hold great promise for building the \nadministrative capacity required to manage a modern system of \nunemployment bene\ufb01ts. Other large-scale digital ID initiatives \nin Asia include Indonesia\u2019s e-KTP card, Malaysia\u2019s MyKad, and \nPakistan\u2019s NADRA.\nFourth, minimum wages are an important way for \npolicy\u00a0makers to ensure that less-skilled workers enjoy a decent \nstandard of living and to counter inequality. Good design \nprinciples are crucial in setting minimum wages. They need \nto avoid being either too generous or too meager, and they \nshould rise in line with productivity gains. A rule of thumb is \nfor minimum wages to be 30%\u201340% of the median wage, or \n25%\u201335% of the mean wage (IMF 2016). Different minimum \nwages for different locations should accurately re\ufb02ect \ndifferences in the cost of living. At\u00a0the same time, governments \nmust resist pressure to introduce different minimum wages for \ndifferent sectors or categories of workers. The more types of \nminimum wage there are, the more likely lobbyists and special \ninterest groups will interfere and keep the market from playing \nits vital role in allocating resources.\nFifth, rather than create regulatory barriers to nonstandard \nforms of employment such as part-time contract labor, it may \nbe better to regulate more neutrally.

Ensuring \ngood quality and growth in fund assets is therefore important \nto maintain and improve Azerbaijan\u2019s creditworthiness, toward \nkeeping moderate the cost of borrowing for development.\nIn December 2016, the government adopted a strategic road \nmap that calls for rules-based SOFAZ transfers, ending the link \nbetween transfers and oil prices. This entails setting SOFAZ \nbudget transfers in line with a medium-term \ufb01scal framework \nthat provides clear revenue targets and expenditure limits to \nensure \ufb01scal sustainability. Beyond this reform, strengthening \nthe broader economy and improving tax administration would \nincrease non-oil revenue, thereby reducing the need for SOFAZ \nbudget transfers, as could more efficient public investment \nmanagement.

The\u00a0program aims \nto improve public administration and the delivery of services \nsuch\u00a0as education and health care, heighten transparency in the \npublic sphere to \ufb01ght corruption (as the name suggests), and \nreduce the transaction costs that \ufb01rms incur to meet registration \nand other regulatory requirements and to pay taxes.\nTaza Koom\u2019s current action plan covers the year beginning in \nAugust\u00a02017. It includes projects on information infrastructure, \ncyber security to enable a cashless economy, and the streamlined \ndelivery of services by regional and municipal governments. Its \ndigital infrastructure project is laying \ufb01ber-optic lines, expanding \naccess to mobile high-speed internet and the applications \navailable, and providing means to achieve a more fault-tolerant \nnetwork with improved data transmission. Another project aims \nto ensure the availability of information in multiple languages, \nincluding Kyrgyz. \nWhile the Taza Koom program has the potential to advance \ndiversi\ufb01cation through digitalization, additional measures would \nhelp achieve this goal.\nOne would be to accelerate reform to improve the business \nclimate by addressing problems with contract enforcement, \nreliable electricity supply, resolving insolvency, and paying taxes\u2014\nall areas where the country ranks especially low, at\u00a0100 or worse \namong 190 countries covered in the most recent World Bank \nDoing Business survey.\nOthers would be to improve the management of public \ninvestment, encourage private investors to \ufb01ll supply gaps in \ninfrastructure for energy and other areas, and increase job \ntraining so that workers can satisfy the skills requirements of new \njobs. Also helpful would be reform to trade policies that would \nmaximize bene\ufb01ts from preferential arrangements accorded by \nthe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trading partners.", "Tajikistan\nGrowth  rose  to  7.1%  in  2017  as  the  external  environment  strengthened  and  public \ninvestment continued.

There were strong expectations \nof a commensurate \ufb01scal response to mitigate social risks, \npromote the private sector, and sustain the delivery of public \nservices, as evidenced by an unprecedented review of the \n2018 state budget in December 2017. However, two key factors \nhave limited the capacity of the budget to respond effectively: \neroding \ufb01nances, as rising outlays and a decline in revenues \nfrom weak commodity prices worsened indebtedness, and \nfragmentation of the budget framework with the transfer of \ncapital expenditures for state development programs to a new \noff-budget fund. While global commodity prices are projected \nto rebound and restore revenue with help from planned tax \nreform, \ufb01scal fragmentation remains a serious concern because \nit undermines government efforts to decentralize and make \npublic spending more efficient. \n Public \ufb01nancial management must be strengthened to cope \nwith a persistent \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit, mounting needs for \ufb01nancing \n(including foreign borrowing), new development programs, and \nongoing \ufb01scal decentralization. A rationalized, consolidated, \nand forward-looking system of public \ufb01nancial management \nwould strengthen \ufb01scal policy by clearly informing policy \nmakers on the resources available, the constraints on their \nuse in addressing desired objectives, and options that would \nsupport economic stabilization. \nMuch remains to be done to make public spending more \nefficient.

What is \nultimately needed is a coherent and comprehensive internal \ncontrol framework that goes beyond ensuring the legality of \ntransactions. Another need is an effective internal audit system \ncovering all government agencies. In 2018, the government \nsubmitted a draft procurement law to Parliament, but it \ndescribes only a general platform for public procurement \nwithout comprehensively going into procurement practices. \nAdditional legislation is thus required to align domestic \nprocurement with internationally accepted practice. On a more \npositive note, the government established a single oversight \nbody to make basic procurement data readily available \nand provide an institutional focus for improving public \nprocurement.\nFinally, the government must improve its management of \nreform. This requires drawing on all available resources inside \nand outside of government, and on implementing global best \npractices, especially after the substantial downsizing of the \npublic sector that took place in 2017. In addition, successful \nreform will require effective communication about proposed \nmeasures and their motivations to citizens, government \nemployees, development partners, and investors, both domestic \nand international.

Real\u00a0estate \ninvestment growth will weaken further in response to \npurchase restrictions in more cities, though available housing \nstocks in larger cities are already low and demand remains \nstrong, harboring an upside risk to the forecast. Excess capacity \nand high debt will continue to limit investment in heavy \nindustry, and enterprises that pollute the environment will face \nadditional constraints on investment (and production) imposed \nby the government as part of ongoing structural reform. \nGovernment investment in infrastructure will remain \nsizeable, but its growth rate is projected to decline, the \ngovernment having already started to streamline infrastructure \nspending both on and off budget to control growth in local \ngovernment debt. As bond yields drive up \ufb01nancing costs, \nconstraints are stiffening as well on government-owned policy \nbanks, which have provided heavily subsidized loans on a large \nscale for infrastructure projects, shantytown reconstruction, \nand social housing. As a result, infrastructure investment \ngrowth has already weakened since December 2017, scuttling \nseveral major infrastructure projects that had been pursued \nas public\u2013private partnerships. These developments cannot \nbe fully compensated by stronger investment in emerging \nindustries, consumer-oriented industries, and services because \nmost of them are less capital intensive. However, investment in \nexport-oriented industries may increase, especially if the surge \nin exports continues. This possibility harbors an upside risk to \nthe forecast.\nThe trend in exports and imports over the forecast period \nshould be a continuation from 2017, tempered by the pattern \nof growth in the major industrial economies\u2014the US, the euro \narea, and Japan\u2014which is expected to accelerate in 2018 and \nmoderate in 2019.

However, the ratio of \nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; Ministry of Finance.\ntax revenue to GDP in the PRC, excluding social security \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\ncontributions, was only 17.5% in 2017, after peaking at 18.6% \nin 2012 and 2013. By comparison, in 2014, the ratio was 25% \non average in the advanced economies of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 21% in \nthe 10 emerging economies in the Group of 20 (G20). \nThe stagnation of tax revenue in the PRC can be explained \nby heavy dependence on indirect taxes, whose growth has \nslowed following value-added tax reform that eased the tax \nburden for enterprises in the service sector. Indeed, direct \ntaxes in the PRC make only a small contribution to tax revenue \nequal to 5% of GDP, compared with 11% in the OECD countries \nand 7%\u20138% in the G20 emerging economies. The lackluster \ncollection of direct taxes re\ufb02ects mainly low receipts of \npersonal income taxes, equal to 1.4% of GDP and much lower \nthan the OECD norm of 8.4%. This suggests that there is \nsubstantial potential in the PRC to raise more revenue from \npersonal income taxes. Another issue is that the tax system in \nthe PRC does little to narrow income inequality, which remains \na big concern for the country. The difference between Gini \ncoefficients, the usual measure of inequality, before and after \ntaxes and transfers is only 3% in the PRC, compared with over \n30% in OECD countries.\nThree main reasons explain the low contribution of \npersonal income taxes to revenue and their limited use to \naddress inequality. First, a high standard personal exemption \nof CNY42,000, or twice the average annual national wage, \nnarrows the income tax base such that fewer than 20% of \nwage earners pay it. Second, the top marginal rate of 45% \napplies only to income above CNY960,000, which is the highest \nbracket of income distribution and almost 35 times the average \nannual national wage. In contrast, in OECD countries, the \npersonal exemption is only one quarter of the average annual \nnational wage, and the top marginal rate starts to apply at \naround 4 times the average. Third, personal income is not \ntaxed on a consolidated basis but according to a multicategory \nsystem that subjects income from different sources to different ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia  People\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002187\ntax schedules. Depending on the category, income from some \nsources is taxed at progressive rates (as are wages and salaries), \nwhile others are taxed at a \ufb02at rate (rental and lease income, \namong others) or even tax-exempt (interest on savings deposits \nand bonds).\nTaxes on wage income are rendered even less progressive \nby the highly regressive structure of social security \ncontributions. A \ufb02at and slightly different contribution rate \nis applied to employees\u2019 gross wages in each province and \nlocality. Nationwide, the rate averages 11%. The social security \ncontribution base to which the contribution rate applies is \nthe employee\u2019s salary in the previous year, except for those \nearning below a threshold, who must pay a \ufb01xed minimum \namount, and those earning above a threshold, who pay a \n\ufb01xed maximum amount. The lower threshold is generally \nset at 60% of the previous year\u2019s average local wage, and \nthe top threshold at 300% of that wage. As the earnings of \nabout 30% of urban workers are below the lower threshold, \nthese low-income workers effectively make social security \ncontributions higher than 11% of their income. Meanwhile, for \nthe top earners, the effective rate is lower than 11%. Indeed, \nthe tax bite on low incomes is substantial and grows as income \nfalls. This is not only regressive, because it worsens inequality, \nbut potentially a disincentive for low-income workers to enter \nformal employment. This barrier to entry is further exacerbated \nby employer social security contributions that are relatively \nhigh, almost 35% of payroll on the average, more than double \nthe 16% average in the 10 advanced economies in the G20 and \nsubstantially more than the 25% norm in the European Union. \nThese issues suggest to the government a future direction \nfor tax reform. First, adjustment to the standard personal \nallowance that, for example, replaces it with a well-calibrated \ntax credit, could signi\ufb01cantly broaden the personal income tax \nbase and make it more progressive. Second, a good complement \nto the \ufb01rst reform would be to simplify the tax rate structure \nwith fewer income categories such that higher rates capture \nmore income from upper-middle earners. Third, levying social \nsecurity contributions on the actual income of all earners, \nwithout thresholds, would make them much less regressive. \nFurther, by removing regressive taxation as a disincentive to \nseeking formal wage employment, social security reform could \nmake both personal income tax and social security receipts \nmore\u00a0buoyant. \nThese reforms will likely be initiated within the forecast \nperiod and gradually help raise revenue, address inequality, \nand strengthen labor market \ufb02exibility and enterprise \ncompetitiveness over the long term.

The current account de\ufb01cit is projected to equal 2.7% \nof GDP in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. \nThe outlook has downside risks. Weather is an obvious \nconcern. With local government elections in February 2018 \nhaving dealt the ruling coalition an unexpected setback, \npolitical uncertainty could damage investor con\ufb01dence and \nundermine the reform agenda. An unexpectedly large rise \nin global interest rates or volatility in capital markets could \nsharply limit planned borrowing and increase its cost.\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming state-owned \nenterprises\nState-owned enterprises (SOEs) are estimated to account for \nsome 17% of economic activity in Sri Lanka, their dominating \npresence spanning infrastructure services, banking and \ninsurance, hotels, media, salt production, plantations, and \nlivestock. \nWhile \ufb01nance SOEs are pro\ufb01table, the sector loses money \nas a whole. Publicly guaranteed debt including SOE debt is \nestimated at the equivalent of 4.2% of GDP. Additional SOE \n\ufb01nancial obligations were estimated to equal 11.9% of GDP at \nthe end of 2016. SOE demand for \ufb01nancing thus potentially \ncrowds out credit to the private sector. Continued losses \nundermine \ufb01scal consolidation and divert resources from \nproductive developmental needs. Weak SOE \ufb01nances and \ntheir lack of high-quality public service delivery constrain \nproductivity and growth.\nUnder the ongoing program with the IMF, statements of \ncorporate intent signed for the \ufb01ve largest SOEs are expected \nto enhance oversight and \ufb01nancial discipline. An outcome of \nthese statements is a requirement that fuel and electricity come \nunder an automatic pricing mechanism, which the cabinet \nis expected to approve in 2018. The government\u2019s approach \nunder its Vision 2025 economic program is to improve SOE \ngovernance structures by enhancing accountability and to \nrestructure them to make them commercially viable, in part \nthrough cost-re\ufb02ective pricing and targeted subsidies to the \npoor to ensure\u00a0equity. \nThe government is considering a proposal to set up a state-\nowned holding company along the lines of Singapore\u2019s Temasek \nHoldings. Critical to its success would be an appropriate \nregulatory framework, a governance structure, accountability \nmechanisms, an adequate pool of technocrats, and arm\u2019s length \ndistance from politics.", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia  Sri Lanka\u2002\u2002245\nWorldwide, SOE reform is inevitably intertwined with \npolitics.

Meaningful \nand sustained\u00a0SOE reform depends on building a political \nconsensus and ring-fencing the reform process from change in \nthe political order. \nEqually important is that future reform draw upon lessons \nfrom past experience. It must avoid institutional lapses such as \nthe divesture of Lanka Marine Services, a provider of bunker \nfuel. Following a complaint \ufb01led by the Committee on Public \nEnterprises that there were irregularities in the privatization \nprocess that bene\ufb01ted a private holding company, the Supreme \nCourt in 2009 reversed the privatization and ordered that the \nenterprise be reverted to state ownership. Experience with \nthe use of management contracts for plantations has been \nsimilarly problematic, partly because short contract duration \ndisincentivizes investment to enhance productivity.\nThe liberalization of the telecom sector in the late 1990s \noffers several positive lessons. In 1997, the government initiated \nreforms in the sector with the sale through competitive \nbidding of its 35% stake in Sri Lanka Telecom. An employee \nshare ownership plan was instituted to counter anticipated \ntrade union resistance, with union members encouraged \nto study similar privatization processes. Privatization was \naccompanied by the setting up of the Telecommunications \nRegulatory Commission as an independent regulator to pursue \nreform to make the industry more competitive. Competition, \ncontestability, and regulation oriented toward competition \nwere crucial to successful reform in the industry.\nOwnership change is not a panacea for underperforming \nSOEs. What\u00a0may matter more toward improving performance \nis to institutionalize incentives while strengthening \naccountability and governance.

The program has already gathered \nmomentum, with public spending on infrastructure estimated \nto rise by nearly a percentage point of GDP last year to reach \n5.4%. This is a remarkable achievement for the \ufb01rst year. \nHowever, considering the wide array of infrastructure projects \nunder the program, the challenge for the government is to \nensure that government departments, and other implementing \nagencies have the adequate absorptive capacity to roll out and \nimplement such large and complex projects. \nEncouragingly, efforts are already under way to enhance \nthe absorptive capacity of government agencies, including their \ntechnical and institutional capabilities for project readiness \nand budget execution. Initiatives include a proposed shift \nfrom a multiyear budget system to an annual cash-based \nsystem effective in January 2019 with a view to improving \nbudget execution. A budget reform bill is being pursued in the \nlegislature to institutionalize improvements in the \ufb01nancial \nmanagement, budgeting, accountability, and result-orientation \nof the budget process and public spending. \nBuilding on these recent initiatives, concerted efforts \non three fronts should help further enhance the absorptive \ncapacity of government agencies: making interagency \ncoordination more cohesive; fostering stronger partnership \nbetween government agencies, the private sector, and \ndevelopment partners; and strengthening the skills of staff in \nimplementing public agencies. \nThe timely completion of infrastructure projects requires \nmore cohesive interagency coordination in planning and \nbudgeting bodies and in sectoral government departments and ", "276(cid:12)(cid:12)Asian Development Outlook 2018\nline agencies.

Building on this initiative, \nthe task force has potential to serve as a center for interagency \ncoordination and strategic planning for infrastructure \ndevelopment.\nAnother way to expand absorptive capacity in public \nsector bodies would be to strengthen partnerships between \nthe government, the private sector, and development partners. \nThe\u00a0private sector and development partners can bring in \ntechnical support, innovation, and new ideas for project \npreparation and implementation. \nFinally, there is an urgent need to augment technical \ncapacity within agencies. Some projects such as long-span \nbridges and tunnels are technically complex and beyond \nprevious experience in the Philippines. These projects need \nto\u00a0be pursued with international best practices, knowledge, and \ninnovation.

The strategy incorporates medium-term revenue, \nexpenditure, and debt strategies.\nUnder the Medium Term Revenue Strategy, the government \nhas developed a plan to improve tax compliance, collection, \nand administration. This includes enhancing information \ntechnology systems in the Inland Revenue Commission, \nestablishing a dedicated office to handle large taxpayers, \nand drafting a new law to simplify and modernize tax \nadministration.

Its aim is to \nlimit wage bill growth to no more than 5% annually and reduce \nthe wage bill from the current 49% of revenue (excluding \nresource and grant proceeds) to less than 40% by 2022. Finally, \nthe debt strategy seeks to roll total government debt back \nbelow 30% of GDP by 2022 from the current 32% and to reduce \nthe government\u2019s reliance on the domestic Treasury bill market \nby tapping external sources (Figure 3.33.7).\nCommitting to the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy and its  3.33.7\u2002Public debt\npath toward \ufb01scal consolidation is essential.

A strong \nperformance in 2017 reflected a surge in exports, which will likely abate this year and next, and rapidly \nexpanding domestic demand. While the outlook is for steady growth, risks to it are decidedly on the \ndownside: Trade friction could weaken recently deepened trade links, tightening US monetary policy could \ndiminish investment in developing Asia, and rising domestic private debt may hamper growth.\nNew technologies drive higher productivity, the foundation for economic growth, better-paid jobs, and \npoverty reduction. The latest technologies in robotics and artificial intelligence may threaten some jobs, \nhowever, and leave less-skilled workers behind. To maximize gains in productivity while safeguarding social \nwelfare, governments in developing Asia should protect workers but not preserve particular jobs. Meanwhile, \nthey should facilitate the countervailing forces in new technologies that generate new jobs. Dealing with the \ndownsides of new technology requires synchronized effort on skills development, labor regulation, social \nprotection, and income redistribution. \nHA\nowSI\n TA\necN\nhn D\no\nAbout the Asian Development Bank logEV\ny AEL\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.
