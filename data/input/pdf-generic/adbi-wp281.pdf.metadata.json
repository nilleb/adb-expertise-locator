This  paper  argues  that  in  the  EU  (i)  private  sector  partners \nremain risk-averse; and (ii) risk-pooling across a larger number of tax-payers tends to reduce \nthe  cost  of  risk  to  zero,  making  EU  funds  highly  desirable  and  sought  after  for  public \ninfrastructure development. This paper argues that private equity has not been forthcoming \nto the extent that had been expected by those propagating this method of finance. In those \ninstances where private non-publicly guaranteed resources have been used, the distribution \nof risks between public and private partners remained asymmetric, with public governmental \nbodies carrying the financial risks, which ultimately may become a contingent liability for the \ncountry\u2019s public finances. However, EU and European Investment Bank (EIB) public funding \nis used not simply because the risks are spread more widely, but rather because EU rules \nand  regulations  for  using  such  funds  lead  to  better  preparation  of  projects  and  greater \nefficiency gains in project implementation and delivery. \n\n \nJEL Classification: G32, H44, O19 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nContents \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 4 \n\nRationale and Conceptual Framework for using PPPs ............................................... 4 \n\n2.1  Risk distribution as a determining factor in the use of PPPs ............................. 6 \n2.2  Choosing the right level of risk distribution ....................................................... 6 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement Systems and PPP Extensions ............................................................ 12 \n\n3.1  Turn-key procurement or Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) ................................ 12 \n3.2  Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) .......................................................... 13 \n3.3  Divestiture or Build-Own-Operate PPPs ......................................................... 15 \n\n4. \n\nPreconditions for Successful PPP Implementation................................................... 16 \n\n4.1  Procurement and the Development of Advanced Tendering Systems ............ 16 \nLegal and institutional requirements ............................................................... 16 \n4.2 \n\n5. \n\nUse and Financing of PPPs in the EU...................................................................... 20 \n\n5.1  The legal and institutional framework for PPPs in EU member states ............ 20 \n5.2  European Commission Guidelines for PPPs .................................................. 21 \n\n6. \n\nRisk and the Involvement of Private Equity .............................................................. 22 \n\n6.1  Financial Implications of Risk ......................................................................... 22 \n6.2  Type and allocation of risks ............................................................................ 25 \n6.3  State budgeting of PPPs ................................................................................ 26 \n6.4  Hybrid PPPs and state budgeting .................................................................. 28 \n6.5  Performance of PPPs in the European Union ................................................ 28 \n\n7. \n\nUse of PPPs for EU Cross-Border Infrastructure ..................................................... 32 \n\n7.1  Suitability and effectiveness of alternative PPP structures ............................. 32 \n7.2  Hybrid PPPs in the EU: mixing grants with private funding ............................. 33 \n\n8. \n\nThe Role of the European Investment Bank in PPPs ............................................... 36 \n\n8.1  Role of the EIB in European PPPs ................................................................. 37 \nImpact of PPPs on the EIB............................................................................. 39 \n8.2 \n\n9. \n\nIllustrative Examples of PPP in the EU .................................................................... 40 \n\n9.1  The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) ........................................................... 40 \n9.2  Beiras Litoral and Alta Shadow Toll Road, Portugal ....................................... 41 \n9.3  M5 toll motorway, Hungary ............................................................................ 41 \n9.4  Perpignan\u2014Figueiras Rail Concession, cross-border link between France and \nSpain 42 \n9.5  Trakia Motorway Project, Bulgaria ................................................................. 42 \n\n10. \n\nConclusions and Lessons Learned .......................................................................... 43 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 45 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nA lack of infrastructure is proving a major constraint in sustaining and expanding Asia\u2019s \neconomic  growth,  in  particular  in  (re-)  emerging  fast-developing  countries  such  as \nIndia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, and Viet Nam. Inadequacies \nof economic infrastructure mean that it is more difficult to make growth inclusive for the \npoor, many of whom reside in remote and sparsely connected parts of their countries.  \n\nInternationally,  interest  in  public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  is  growing  because  it \nseems to offer a solution that can overcome barriers to development due to a lack of \ninfrastructure.  Economic  growth  is  to  an  important  extent  dependent  on  the \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  particularly  in  transport  and  utilities  such  as  water, \npower,  and telecommunications.  In  addition,  as  countries  develop,  there  is  a  need to \nimprove social infrastructure for health and education, as well as many other facilities, \nincluding prisons. \n\nPPPs  allow  governments  to  expand  the  provision  of  services  by  using  market  tools, \nrather  than  publicly  provided  and  managed  facilities.  It  increases  the  number  of \nservices  that  can  be  provided  within  a  given  state  budget  and,  more  importantly,  it \nincreases  their  value  in  terms  of  quality  and  performance.  In  some  areas,  such  as \ninformation  technology  and  defense,  the  combination  of  public  and  private  interests \ncan create commercial value to some applications. \n\nIn recent years several Asian governments have actively been promoting PPPs in the \nkey  infrastructure  sectors  of  transport,  power,  urban  infrastructure  and  tourism. \nBringing  in  more  private  finance  into  key  areas  such  as  road  building,  waterways, \npower  generation,  seaports,  airports,  etc.  would \nthe  capability  of \ngovernments  to  tackle  infrastructure  deficits.  PPPs  could  be  an  effective  means  to \nenhance  the  financing  of  the  long  list  of  essential  infrastructure  projects  across  the \neast and south-east Asian sub-regions.  \n\nincrease \n\nThe  member  states  of  the  European  Union  (EU)  as  well  as  the  EU  institutions \nthemselves  have  been  increasingly  using  PPPs  to  accelerate  the  development  of \nambitious trans-national infrastructure. To build the planned so-called Trans European \nNetworks will require a financial outlay estimated in excess of \u20ac500 billion. For the EU, \nthese are a central part of its strategy to integrate the economies of the EU and create \nan effective and functioning single market, able to reap the growth benefits associated \nwith EU-wide economies of scale.  \n\nThis  paper  presents  the  EU\u2019s  rationale  for  using  PPPs  and  its  experience,  with \nnumerous instances of successful PPPs using a wide variety of forms, does not offer a \nsignificantly different scenario from that of its member states. The novel feature is that \nthe  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  can  and  does  provide  a  framework  for  co-\noperation and tying together several national governments. It can provide a technical \ncapability  for  authoritative  risk  assessments.  It  can  also  provide  financial  resources. \nHowever, the number of cases where significant additional risk-bearing resources from \nnon-public entities remain comparatively limited. \n\n2.  RATIONALE AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR \n\nUSING PPPS \n\nIn  the  last  two  decades  there  has  been  an  important  increase  in  the  use  of  public \nprivate  partnerships.  The  driver  of  these  partnerships  is  often  limited  public  funds \ncombined with an increasing acceptance that the private sector is often better able to \nhandle many of the traditional tasks of the public sector. Often the private sector has \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nshown better ability in increasing quality and efficiency of services, due to the need to \nintegrate risks into the planning process.  \n\nOne can summarize the reasons for implementing PPPs as follows: \n\n\u2022  To provide additional capital; \n\n\u2022  To provide better management and implementation skills; \n\n\u2022  To provide more added value; \n\n\u2022  To more efficiently allocate risks, thus improving the identification of needs and \n\nthe optimal use of resources over the whole life of a project;  \n\n\u2022  The  potential  advantages  of  PPPs  over  traditional  public  procurement \n\nprocedures are presented in Table 1 below. \n\nTable 1: Potential Advantages of PPPs \n\nAcceleration of \ninfrastructure provision \n\nFaster implementation \n\nReduced whole life costs \n\nBetter risk allocation \n\nPPPs allow the public sector to change the upfront \ncapital expenditure of a project into a flow of yearly \nservice payments, allowing projects to be delivered \nearlier and reducing public funding constraints. \nThe  incentives  by  the  private  sector  to  deliver  on \ntime  and  according  to  specifications  increase. \nRisks of design and construction are transferred to \nthe  private  sector.  Payments  based  on  delivery \nand  quality,  or  the  need  to  charge  user  fees \nencourages efficiency and quality. \nWhile  PPPs  tend  to  be  more  expensive  on  paper, \nas these integrate risk costing, the final costs have \nbeen  lower,  as  time  and  cost  overruns  have  been \ncut considerably. \nA core principle of PPPs is the allocation of risk to \nthe partner best able to manage it. \n\nBetter incentives to perform  The allocation of risk to the private sector and the \nstricter  links  between  delivery  and  the  returns  to \nthe  developers  and  operators  increase  efficiency \nand quality. \n\nGeneration of additional \nrevenues \n\nImproved quality of service  Depending  on  the  PPP  used,  the  private  sector \nprofit  level  may  depend  on  the  quality  of  delivery. \nDemand  for  the  service  and  thus  fee  returns  may \ndepend on quality. \nDue  to  increases  in  quality  and  efficiency  the \nprivate  sector  may  manage  to  increase  profits, \nreducing  the  need  of  any  subvention  during  the \nlifecycle of the project. \nThe  involvement  of  private  sector  management  in \nthe  public  sector  introduces  (into  the  civil  service) \nelements  of  performance  benchmarking  rather \nthan  the  traditional  delivery  of  services  without \nseeking to achieve   value for money. \n\nEnhanced public \nmanagement \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \n\nDespite all these benefits, PPPs require a mature market with a well-developed private \nsector  to  ensure  sufficient  competition  for  the  tenders.  Contracting  is  complex, \nespecially given the need to take into account the whole life cycle of the projects. The \nprivate sector does not have the same incentives as the public sector in the provision \nof public services, thus the specifications and outputs required from the public sector \nhave  to  make  commercial  sense  for  the  private  sector.  If  there  is  a  lack  of \ninfrastructure due to a market failure, the private sector will not participate if the social \nbenefits  of  the  project  cannot  be  transformed  into  a  financial  return  to  the  private \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\noperator.  Also,  the  level  of  risk  may  limit  the  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  large \ninfrastructure projects, where returns only accrue in the long-term, increasing the risks \nof  overestimating  revenue  streams.  In  some  areas  traditional  public  procurement  is \nunavoidable,  where  the  state  finances,  owns,  and  operates  the  facilities,  with  the \nprivate sector only providing specific services for a short time.  \n\n2.1  Risk distribution as a determining factor in the use of \n\nPPPs \n\nThe  distinguishing  feature  between  standard  public  procurement  procedures  and \ndifferent  types  of  PPPs  is  the  distribution  of  risks.  The  kind  of  risk-sharing  used \ndetermines the type of contractual agreement. This has been reviewed in a European \nCommission  document1 on  regional  policy.  It  specifies  which  PPPs  are most  suitable \nfor  which  kind  of  projects,  developing  a  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  guideline.  Other  public  inter-\ngovernmental  institutions  such  as  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) and the World Bank seek to propagate the use of PPPs.2\n \n\nThe  kind  of  partnership  between  a  public  and  a  private  partner  depends  on  the \ndistribution of responsibilities on the following risks (see also 7.2 below): \n\n\u2022  Construction risk\n\n related to the design and the construction phase; \n\nPerformance and availability risk\ncontractual specification and the final product;  \n\n related to the (mis)match between the \n\n where the market price of an asset at the end of the \n\nResidual value risk\ncontractual agreement is lower than expected, for example the value of a \npublic infrastructure asset when it  reverts to the public sector after the end of \nthe concession to a private entity;  \n\nFinancial risk\n\n linked to the interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; \n\n related to the risk that actual use of the asset after completion is \n\nDemand risk\nlower than expected with the project perhaps becoming non-viable if service \ncharges are supposed to cover construction and/or maintenance costs; and \n\nGovernance risk\nto the contractual obligations and stipulated terms and conditions. \n\n, where the public authorities are unwilling or unable to adhere \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the first three of these types of risk are essentially of \nan  additive  nature.  However,  the  latter  three  relating  to  financial,  demand  and \ngovernance  risks  are  essentially  of  a  multiplicative  nature.  This  means  that  their \nimpact on financial outcomes is likely to result in a much greater degree of uncertainty.  \n\n2.2  Choosing the right level of risk distribution \n\nThe value for money of a PPP project depends principally on (i) the distribution of risks \nbetween the public and private sector; and (ii) the quality of the project preparation. It \nis clear that PPPs have the potential to reduce the expenses for the government or at \nleast  spread  them  differently  over  time.  However,  the  potential  of  PPPs  to  be  more \ncost effective and require less total expenditures is based on very specific conditions, \ngenerally known as the Arrow-Lind conditions.3\n  \n\n                                                \n1 European Commission 2003. \n2 OECD. 2007  \n3 We are here concerned with total costs including public expenditure and user charges. PPPs are often \n\nused to transfer costs from the public purse to the private user. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nIn  a  seminal  article,  these  authors  discussed  \u201cwhether  it  is  appropriate  to  discount \npublic investment in the same way as private investments\u201d. They concluded that \u201cwhen \nthe risks  associated  with  a  public  investment  are  publicly  borne,  the  total  cost  of  risk \nbearing  is  insignificant  and,  therefore,  the  government  should  ignore  uncertainty  in \nevaluating public investments\u201d  4 This radical suggestion was based on the notion that \nthe  impact  of  publicly-financed  investments  on the  tax  burden  of  individual  taxpayers \nwas  much  smaller  than  the  potential  impact  on  shareholders  of  private  companies. \nThe  authors  proved  that  if  the  number  of  taxpayers  were  infinite,  the  costs  of  risk-\nbearing  \u201care  negligible\u201d. 5\n Of  course,  it  will  never  be  the  case  for  a  private  equity \ninvestor that the number of shareholders will be infinite, and hence the attitude to risk \nwill  always  remain  fundamentally  different.  Private  investors  will  therefore  demand  a \nhigher risk premium than public-sector decision makers. The latter may indeed choose \nto follow Arrow-Lind\u2019s conclusions and approach uncertainty as if it did not matter.  \n\nThis section analyzes the conditions for optimal risk allocation in a context of certainty \nas  well  as  of  uncertainty.  Three  important  conclusions  are  derived.  First,  the  risk-\nspreading aspect of public investment, leading to a lesser risk-averseness than private \ninvestors,  means  that  the  optimal  transfer  of  risk  from  public  to  private  operators  is \nfundamentally limited. \n\n2.2.1  Optimal risk distribution without Uncertainty \n\nFrom  an  accounting  point  of  view,  publicly  financed  infrastructure  should  be  less \nexpensive  than  private-sector  financed  infrastructure.  The  costs  of  construction  and \nmanagement should be the same for a project regardless who funds it. However, the \nprivate  sector  will  require  a  profit  and  will  demand  high  rates  of  return  to  cover  the \ninevitable risks in complex infrastructure projects. Apart from the potential of spreading \ncapital  costs  over  time,  there  is  no  a  priori  reason  for  the  Net  Present  Value  of  a \nproject  funded  by  the  state  to  be  more  cost-effective  than  a  privately  funded  and \ninfrastructure \noperated  project.  Only \ndevelopment  is  unable to  achieve  optimal  efficiency  in  its  management and  resource \nuse would PPPs be able to achieve cost-effectiveness. \n\nfunded  and  operated \n\nif  wholly-publicly \n\nOne of the main reasons is the different attitudes to risk taken by private operators, in \naccordance  with  Arrow-Lind  conditions. 6\n Being  more  risk-averse  than  the  state, \nprivate-sector  project  preparation  is  undertaken  in  much  greater  detail.  In  PPPs  the \ndifficulty  for  the  authorities  is  to  strike  the  right  balance  between  risk  distribution,  the \nrisk premiums of the private sector, and the level of detail in the contract specification. \nPoor  decision-making  and  bad  preparation  with  regard  to  any  of  those  three  may \nrapidly erode the efficiency gains from any PPP. \n\nDepending on the project characteristics, the optimal level of risk-sharing differs. Some \nrisks  are  so  high  and  unpredictable  that  it  often  requires  some  risk  to  be retained  by \nthe  public  sector to  attract  any  private  sector  involvement.  Exchange  rate  risks  are  a \nclassic example of these and may require the state to engage in swap-arrangements \nand other methods of hedging for future payments in different currencies. \n\nThe  principal  rule  is  that  the  risks  are  carried  by  the  party  most  able  to  handle  and \nminimize  the  risks.  Avoiding  construction  delays  and  cost  overruns  is  often  better \nhandled by the private sector. However, the subsequent demand risk may be too high \nfor the private sector to handle, with its requirement that profitability is high enough for \nrepayment  of  capital  and  interests. This  is  particularly  the  case for  public  assets  and \nservices  where  demand  is  independent  from  private  sector  activity.  For  example, \n\n                                                \n4 Arrow and Lind (1970), p. 163. \n5 Arrow and Lind (1970), p. 174. \n6 Arrow and Lind (1970) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nmotorway  building  and  maintenance  companies  have  few,  if  any,  instruments  to \ninfluence the future level of traffic demand. \n\nThe  \u201cvalue-for-money\u201d  realized  is  thus  a  non-linear  function  of  the  degree  of  risk \ntransfer from public to private operators. Figure 2 shows the relationship between risk \npremiums  and  savings  due  to  efficiency  gains  of  PPPs,  assuming  quadratic \nrelationships.  In  this  case,  the  analysis  is  straightforward.  If  the  public  sector  and \nprivate  sector  had  no  efficiency  differences,  the  total  cost  of  a  project  would  be \ncheaper  than  using  private  financial  resources  and  private  operators.  The  private \nsector exhibits Arrow-Lind behavior with higher risk aversion than the public sector and \nthus  would  demand  higher  risk  premiums.  A  good  example  is  a  concession  for  an \ninfrastructure  asset  where  the  state  pays  the  operators  according  to  demand.  This \ncould  be  a  shadow  toll  for  motorways.  The  payment  would  also  need  to  cover  the \ncapital  costs.  The  private  financial  sector  and  the  operator  would  seek  high  risk \npremiums  included  in  the  shadow  toll  to  take  into  account  possible  demand \nfluctuations.

This  is  due  to  the  weak  integration  of  risk  factors  in \nestimations.  Thus  the  total  costs  have  repeatedly  (and  generally  systematically) \nexceeded  initial  estimations.  This  has  been  extensively  reported  and  discussed  in \nacademic  literature  and  attributed  mainly  to  \u2018optimism  bias\u2019  and  the  incentive  of \nstrategic  misrepresentation  of  costs  (see  e.g.,  Flyvbjerg,  Skamris,  Holm,  and  Buhl \n2002 and 2005). Public operators are also generally considered to be less efficient in \nkeeping  costs  down,  because  the  profit  incentive  is  missing.  For  that  reason  the \nfinancing,  building  and  operating  of  infrastructure  projects  are  better  handled  by  the \nprivate  sector,  because  the  private  sector  has  greater  incentive  to  keep  costs  down \nand to account fully for risks.  \n\nDue to the size of the outlay, the long-term lifecycle and the large number of different \ntypes of risks linked to large public infrastructure, the private sector will in general not \nundertake  the  development  of  infrastructure  without  public  sector  support  or \nguarantees.  The  PPPs  offer  de  facto  risk-sharing  elements  such  as,  for  example, \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nguarantees  on  future  revenues  from  operating  the  infrastructure,  which  makes  the \nprivate investment viable.  \n\nAssuming  that  the  total  costs  of  a  uniquely  public  sector  development  approach  are \nknown  (i.e.,  certainty),  there  has  to  be  a  point  of  optimum  risk  transfer  to  the  private \nsector.  Initially,  giving  the  private  sector  only  very  limited  risk  transfer  at  R1  will \neliminate the private sector\u2019s efficiency incentives, so that involving the private sector \nwith  a  low  risk  transfer  actually  makes  total  costs  (depicted  on  the  y-axis)  higher. \nHence R1 represents the \u201cworst\u201d allocation of risk from the point of view of the public \nsector. As the degree of transfer of risk increases (a movement from left to right along \nthe  x-axis  of  Figure  2  above),  so  do  the  efficiency  incentives  of  the  private  sector. \nAssuming non-linear quadratic cost functions, the decision makers will seek to ensure \nthat  the marginal  benefits  (MB)  of the  risk transfer  exceed  the marginal costs  MC.  In \neffect, this is the case where the additional cost savings are higher than the additional \ncosts of paying the private sector a risk premium.  \n\nThe point of optimum risk transfer is where the MB = MC at R2 in Figure 2. With further \nrisk transfers, to the right of this point, the MC of the additional risk premiums exceed \nthe  MB  of  the  efficiency  gains.  Hence  at  point  R2  we  have  the  lowest  total  costs,  in \neffect  below  TC2,  the  costs  which  would  have  incurred  without  involvement  of  the \nprivate  partners.  This  cost  reduction,  due  to  a  PPP-approach,  constitutes  the  \u2018social \nprofit\u2019 of the risk transfer.  \n\n2.2.2  Optimal risk distribution with Uncertainty \n\nHowever, there are various difficulties which decision makers encounter in the capture \nof this  social  profit  through  PPPs. The first  is  the  inherent  difficulty  in  estimating  with \ncertainty  ex-ante  what  the  total  costs  of  a  publicly-built  and  operated  infrastructure \nproject  will  be.  The  second  is  the  incentive  of  the  private  sector  to  seek  lower  risk \ntransfer  while  negotiating  high  risk  premiums  (and  hence  profits).  Badly  negotiated \ndeals  could  make  the  projects  costlier  and  more  inefficient  than  wholly  publicly  built \nand  operated  ones.  Figure  3  seeks  to  demonstrate  these  uncertainties  and  the \nbehavioural effects which can strongly affect the viability of a project.  \n\nFigure  3  represents  the  case  where  the  high  premiums  demanded  by  the  private \nsector,  as  well  as  the  uncertainty  of  the  total  costs  of  the  project,  affect  strongly  the \nbenefits  of risk  transfers. The  marginal  cost  curve  shifts to the right, reflecting  higher \nrisk  premiums  demanded  by  private  partners.  Moreover,  the  marginal  benefit  curve \nmay  move  to  the  right  as  well,  reflecting  the  case  in  which  the  differences  between \nprivate  and  public  sector  efficiency  levels  are  less  pronounced.  In  general,  one  of \nthese two effects would be sufficient to yield the outcome depicted in Figure 3 below.   \n\nFigure 3 shows that the optimum risk allocation R3 under uncertainty is to the left of R2 \nobtained  above\u2014greater  uncertainty  leads  to  demands  for  higher  risk  premiums  and \npossibly  lesser  private  sector  efficiency  gains.  Hence,  the  optimal  degree  of  risk \ntransfer from public to private partners is less and involvement of the private sector is \nreduced. The case drawn in Figure 3 remains \u201cspecial\u201d in the sense that the resulting \ntransfer of risks still leads to net efficiency gains for the public sector. The total costs \nfor  the  public  sector  is  within  the  error  margin  of  the  total  cost  estimation  of  the \ninfrastructure\u2014without  public-private  partnership  the  total  costs  would  have  been \nhigher. This  critically  depends  on the  degree  of shift  of the  marginal  cost  and  benefit \ncurves  in  response  to  uncertainty  and  the  resulting  behavioral  responses  of  private \nsector partners. \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nFigure 2: Allocation of Risks with Uncertainty and Behavioral effects \n\nMarginal Costs & \nMarginal Benefits \n\nMC cost of \nPPP (Risk \npremiums \ncharged) \n\nMB of PPP \n(cost \nreduction) \n\nTotal public cost \nuncertainty \n\nTC of \nPPP  \n\nOptimal risk \nallocation \n\nR3 \n\nR2 \n\nDegree of Risk \ntransfer \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s compilation \n\nAs  discussed  below,  ensuring  that  the  private  sector  offers  a  competitive  cost  for \nconstruction and operation can be ensured through competitive tenders. While for the \nlevel of interest charged by the private financial sector, the existence of strict selection \nprocedures  and  solid  loan  guarantees  can  keep  those  down.  The  intervention  of  the \nEIB  and  the  loan  guarantee  offered  by  the  EIB  in  conjunction  with  the  European \nCommission serves this purpose. Partial public co-financing can also reduce costs and \nrisks for the private sector, but it also can reduce their efficiency incentives. \n\nHowever,  in  complex  and  large  infrastructures,  the  contactors  able  to  provide  the \nnecessary technical ability are few. In some countries there may only be one capable \nof  performing  the  work.  This  gives  the  contractors  the  power  to  negotiate  terms  and \nthis may ultimately lead to the erosion of PPP benefits. In the EU, the rules attempt to \nlimit  the  power  of  contractors  through  tendering  rules  and  by  allowing  bids  from \ncompanies based in any EU member state.

The transparency of procurement processes in a number of member \nstates has been questioned. \n\n3.  PROCUREMENT SYSTEMS AND PPP EXTENSIONS \n\nThe  different  models  of  PPPs  are  presented  in  Figure  3  and  based  on  international \nnomenclature  as  developed  by  the  OECD  and  adopted  by  the  EU.  This  figure \nrepresents the distribution of the project development and financial risks depending on \nthe procurement agreement. Each PPP should try to ensure that risks are distributed \nto those parties best able to handle it.  \n\nIn the traditional public procurement the private sector can compete for bids for design \nand construction of public infrastructure, but beyond this the role of the private sector \nis  limited.  Nevertheless,  there  are  extensions  to  the  traditional  public  procurement \nscheme.  These  extensions  are  (i)  service  contracts;  (ii)  operation  and  management \ncontracts  and  leasing  contracts.  However,  these  extensions  are  rarely  considered \nPPPs in a strict sense. \n\nService  contracts  are a  very  limited  and  specific  form  of public-private  co-operation \nused  for  simple  short  term  operational  requirements.  The  private  sector  procures, \noperates and maintains an asset for a short period of time. As the management stays \nin  public  hands  this  is  to  be  regarded  more  as  a  method  for  the  use  of  the  technical \nskills of the private sector. \n\nOperation and management contracts transfer the responsibility for asset operation \nand  management  to  the  private  sector.  These  are  generally  for  a  short  period  but \nextendable. The public sector bears the investment and financial risk, while the private \nsector  is  paid  based  on  performance  and  the  achievement  of  specific  objectives. \nThese  agreements  are  to  be  found  in  the  transitional  periods  of  a  privatization  of  a \nutility. \n\nIn the case of Leasing we have for the first time the full transfer of risks to the private \nsector  of  maintaining  an  asset.  The  private  sector  buys  the  operation  and \nmanagement  of  an  asset  for  a  fixed  period  of  time.  The  private  sector  will  have  the \nincentive to operate the asset efficiently to reduce costs while meeting the operational \nefficiency.  The  public  sector  risk  stays  in  the  areas  of  construction,  capital \nimprovement and financing. Leasing is suitable for infrastructure assets that generate \nan independent revenue stream, such as public transport.  \n\n3.1  Turn-key procurement or Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) \n\nThe aforementioned agreements, even if transferring some public sector operations to \nthe private sectors, are only a very limited form of partnership with the private sector. \nWhen  referring  to  PPPs,  the  first  real  form  of  partnership  starts  with  BOT7\n or  more \ncomplex agreements. In BOT agreements the private party bears the responsibility for \nthe  whole  operational  life  of  the  project:  design,  construction,  and  operation.  The \ncombination  of  these  responsibilities  under  one  single  operator  fosters  efficiency \ngains.  \n\nWhile  the  public  sector  specifies  in  detail  the  standards  and  output  quality \nrequirements  of  the  asset,  the  private  party  needs  to  consider  how  to  reach  the \nstandards  within  the  specified  budget.  Private  parties  need  to  take  into  account  that \nany  problems  in  design  and  construction  will  affect  profitability  during  operation  and \nmaintenance.  \n\n                                                \n7 Also called Design-Build-Operate-Transfer DBO or \u201cturnkey\u201d \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nFrom the public budget and expenditure point of view these BOT agreements help to \navoid  many  of  the  known  shortcomings  and  inefficiencies  observed  in  publicly \nmanaged  assets,  including  less  rigorous  financial  discipline.  Nevertheless,  the  public \nsector, having assumed the whole financial risk, needs to be extremely careful in the \nspecification of standards and outputs. This form of PPP requires the public sector to \nfinance  the  whole  project  cycle  in  full,  which  can  extend  over  a  period  of  20  years. \nBOTs are often used for mass-transit or wastewater treatment plants. \n\n3.2  Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) \n\nA  further  type  of  PPP  arrangement  emerges  when  the  financial  responsibility  in  the \nform of concessions is transferred to the private sector. This is usually referred to as a \nDesign-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) PPP scheme.8\n In this case the whole lifecycle \nand the finances of the project are taken over by the private party. This form of PPP \nusually  grants  an  operator  the  right  to  build  and  run  a  public  facility  over  25  to  30 \nyears,  financing  the  investment  through  revenues  generated  by  user  fees,  or \nalternatively shadow tolls i.e., payments by the state to the private operator based on \nthe level of use of the asset. The private party will thus finance, build and manage the \nasset. It may be also be paid by the state in relation to its performance (e.g., shadow \ntolls based on the use of a motorway). Ownership of the asset will however remain in \nthe hands of the state and it reverts to its control after the end of the concession. \n\nThis  is the most common  and  most  attractive form  of PPP  and  is  frequently found  in \nEU member states, particularly for transport infrastructure. This reflects that it transfers \nthe  financial  responsibility  to  the  private  sector,  reducing  public  outlays.  The  level  of \nrisk taken by the private party can be total, with the government having to intervene if \nthe standards and outputs are not satisfactory, i.e., taking control, or issuing a fine or \neven  appointing  a  new  private  partner/contractor.  However,  more  often  than  not \ngovernments  do  take  a  risk  by  guaranteeing  that  the  private  party  is  bailed  out  if \noverruns  in  project  timing  or  costs  affect  the  financial  viability  of  the  private  party\u2019s \noperation,  or  if  demand risks  after  construction can make  the  project  non  viable.  It  is \nclear that in the case of large public infrastructures of national interest the bankruptcy \nof a private operator will in any case de facto force the government to take over control \nof  the  operation.  This  reduces  the  risk  for  operators  but  also  their  incentive  to  be \nefficient. However, in projects with a long-term maturity and important risks, this may \nbe the only way to ensure the private sector continues to participate in the provision of \ninfrastructure perceived to be in the public interest. \n\n                                                \n8 Also referred to as maintenance concession, BOOT, or BOOT concession \n\n \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Responsibility/Risk According to Type of Procurement System \n\n \n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nSource: European Commission. 2003, p. 18 \n\n3.3  Divestiture or Build-Own-Operate PPPs \n\nDivestiture  is  a  different  method  of  partnership  where  the  government  sells  shares  of \npublic  assets  to  the  private  sector.  This  is  usually  the  case  with  privatization  processes. \nThe difference with previously described forms of PPP is that the asset is now owned by \nthe private sector. However, the state retains some control by regulating the activities of \nthe company, e.g., avoiding monopolistic pricing, price discrimination, or the use of quota \nin the provision of the services. \n\nThe  level  of  divestiture  is  variable,  with  partial  divestitures  being  very  popular.  The \ngovernment  transfers  part  of  a  public  company\u2019s  assets,  blending  the  responsibilities \nbetween public and private parties. This introduces private management and operational \nefficiency while protecting the public interest and national assets. There is no blue print for \nsuch  arrangements  and  detailed  ownership  and  operational  arrangements  vary  case  by \ncase. \n\nIn the case of BOO the government is transferring the full construction and management \nof a public asset to the private sector. This is the case were public services are given over \nto the private sector. The government, however, regulates the provision of the services.  \n\nThese groups of PPP mechanisms have many variants, and EU member states may use \ndifferent  acronyms.  For  example,  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  the  DBFOs  are  called \nPrivate Finance Initiatives (PFIs). \n\nThe  effectiveness  of  alternative  PPP  structures  is  presented  in  Table  2  below.  DBFO  is \nperceived to perform better than alternative procurement models on effectiveness criteria; \nhowever, the implementation constraints are considered to be \u201cvery high\u201d.  \n\nTable 2: The Effectiveness of Alternative PPP Structures \n\nImproved \nService  \n\nEnhanced \nOperationa\nl Efficiency  \n\nEnhanced \nRisk \nSharing  \n\nLife \nCycle \nCosting  \n\nLeveraging \nof Public \nFunds  \n\nImplementa\ntion \nConstraints  \n\nAcceler\nated \nImplem\nent \nation  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nPossibl\ne  \n\nPrivate Outsourcing  \nService \nContracts  \nManagement \nContracts  \n\nYes  \n\nPossible  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nNo  \n\nLow  \n\nModerate  \n\nLeasing  \n\nPossible  \n\nYes  \n\nSome  \n\nNo  \n\nModerate  \n\nIntegrated Private Development  \nBOT  \nPrivate Investment  \nDBFO \nConcessions  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nSource: European Commission. 2003, p. 30 \n\nYes  \n\nSome  \n\nYes  \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nVery High  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\n4.  PRECONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL PPP \n\nIMPLEMENTATION \n\n4.1  Procurement and the Development of Advanced Tendering \n\nSystems \n\nThe tendering phase is essential to ensure that the quality of the outputs is the same as \nthat  of  public  provision.  PPPs  have  the  potential  of  blending  public  interest  and  private \nefficiency, but this potential can only be unleashed if the tendering and public procurement \nprocess are very well managed. It requires a very high degree of expertise by the public \nsector. \n\nTo  find  the  best  contractors,  it  is  necessary  to  have  clear  procurement  regulators  which \ninform  properly  the  private  sector  and  guarantee  a  level  playing  field  in  the  process  of \nawards. The tendering process has to be designed so as to maximize the benefit of a PPP \nrelationship.  This  may  mean  that  tendering  processes  may  require  separate  stages  and \neven complex pre-award discussions with companies to verify their capacity to deliver.  \n\nFor  complex  developments,  the  EU  has  started  using  negotiated  competitive  tendering, \nwhich  includes  negotiations  on  the  details  of  the  tender  after  a  pre-selection  with  two  to \nthree  frontrunners.  This  is  sometimes  necessary  when  the  public  sector  is  not  able  to \nspecify  in  detail  each  aspect  of  the  wished  asset  or  service  and  the  private  sector  is \nrequested \nto  propose  alternatives.  The  negotiated  procedure  has  been  used \ninternationally  to  seek  the  best  value  for  money,  allocate  risk  better,  and  encourage \ninnovative solutions. \n\nTender  procedures  are  complex  and  may  be  difficult  to  sustain  for  some  companies. \nDepending  on  the  project  and  complexity,  the  public  sector  may  cover  costs  associated \nwith  the  tender  procedure,  especially  after  pre-selection.  A  guarantee  of  intellectual \nproperty protection should be guaranteed for the innovations which the tendering party is \noffering. \n\nThe  allocation  of  risk  is  a  cornerstone  for  efficient  PPPs.  Excessive  risk  for  the  private \nsector  will  damage  the  tendering  procedure,  and  too  little  risk  to  the  private  sector  may \naffect efficiency negatively. \n\n4.2  Legal and institutional requirements \n\nThe development of successful PPP investments is influenced by a number of issues, in \nparticular the legal framework and the availability of sufficient private enterprises with the \nknow-how  to  perform  the  required  works.  Also,  it  is  necessary  that  an  \u201copen  economy\u201d \napproach with national treatment is guaranteed in order to attract foreign companies. The \nlack  of  sufficient  competition  in  tendering  will  result  in  a  narrower  choice  of  contractors, \nhigher prices and the risk of not finding a sufficiently suitable private company, increasing \nthe risk that the project objectives are not realized. \n\nThe  legal  framework  has  to  be  conducive  to  private  involvement,  in  particular  if  private \nfunding  is  sought  from  international  commercial  lenders.  The  legal  environment  is  of \nparamount importance. Even in the EU, some member states, especially the newest, have \nregulatory  sphere.  Regulatory  uncertainty  and \nencountered  problems \nunpredictability  will  keep  financial  institutions  at  bay.  The  legislative  and  regulatory \nprovisions  need  to  be  well  developed  and  articulated  before  attempting  to  implement \nPPPs.  \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nThere is a need to identify elements which would affect private sector participation, such \nas  the  viability  of  the  project  or  market  distortions.  Public  procurement  regulations \nregulating  relationships  between  the  public  sector  and  the  private  sector  need  to  be \nclarified  especially  those  concerning  the  benefits  and  obligations  for  each  party  and  the \ndistribution  of  risks  over  the  life  cycle  of  the  project.  The  public  sector  needs  to  have \nspecific  teams  specialized  in  setting  up  PPPs,  able  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  specific \nprojects. \n\nSome of the issues that need to be taken into account are the following: \n\n\u2022  Legal  capacity  of  the  parties  and  the  legal  requirements  of  the  state  to  provide \n\n\u2022  General  legislation  determining  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  providing  public \n\n\u2022  Legislation  clearly  setting  the  conditions  for  participation  of  foreign  companies  or \n\n\u2022  The existence of a legal basis for cost recovery mechanisms \n\n\u2022  The ability to provide guarantees to the private contracting parties over the period \n\nservices \n\nservices \n\nfinancial institutions \n\nof their involvement \n\n\u2022  Clear land and property rights including intellectual property laws \n\n\u2022  Clear land acquisition rules \n\n\u2022  Planning permission requirements \n\n\u2022  Licenses \n\n\u2022  Transparency of national laws \n\n\u2022  Administrative capacity to negotiate and follow the contracts \n\n\u2022  Provisions for dispute settlement \n\n\u2022  The role and requirements for any state finance participation \n\n\u2022  Clear competition and antitrust legislation \n\n\u2022  Clear labor and social security laws \n\n\u2022  Clear tax and accounting liabilities \n\n\u2022  Open  and  clear  procurement  procedures  with  very  clear  project  specification \n\n\u2022  Rights  to  step  in  in  the  event  of  project  failure  and  availability  of  alternative \n\nrequirements \n\ncontractors \n\n\u2022  Reputation (environmental, social) of the projects \n\n\u2022  Credit standing of the public sector counterparty \n\n\u2022  Certainty of the project cash flows to meet debt service requirements \n\nThe  above  list  of  desirable  preconditions  has  been  adapted  from  OECD  and  European \nCommission guideline documents with some additions from interviews with specialists. \n\nIn  addition  it  is  important  to  clarify  requirements  on  environmental  or  social  impact \nassessment,  and  in  particular  which  requirements  international  lenders,  especially \ninstitutional  lenders  such  as  the  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  other  publicly  financed \ndevelopment banks would require if their funds are to be involved. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nDepending  on  the  kind  of  uncertainties  and  foreseeable  problems  with  some  projects, \nspecific  provisions  can  be  used  to  eliminate  some  of  the  risks  for  private  contractors, \nmaintaining  however  the  incentives  to  provide  the  goods  on  time  and  at  specified  cost \nusing  BOT  PPPs  or  mixtures  between  BOT  and  DBFO.

USE AND FINANCING OF PPPS IN THE EU \n\nThe  use  of  PPPs  in  the  EU  has  been  increasing  since  the  early  1990s,  with  the  UK \npioneering  the  process.  It  was  soon  taken  up  by  Portugal,  Spain,  Greece,  the \nNetherlands,  Denmark,  and  Sweden,  with  other  countries  following  suit.  PPPs  are \ngenerally  perceived  as  having  been  a  success  and  evaluations  concord  that  PPPs \nhave achieved higher levels of efficiency and a comparable and even superior service \nresult compared with traditional public sector procurement methods. \n\nThis  positive  performance,  however,  is  built  upon  certain  strict  regulatory  and \nadministrative prerequisites. If these are absent, there is a distinct likelihood that PPPs \nwill be unsuccessful. \n\n5.1  The legal and institutional framework for PPPs in EU \n\nmember states \n\nEach  member  state  has  a  different  approach  to  PPPs,  and  there  is  no  overarching \ndefinition across the EU. It covers a wide range of contractual arrangements between \nthe private and the public sector aimed at operating public infrastructure or delivering \npublic  services.  While  any  PPP  arrangement  needs  to  fulfill  the  basic  EU  rules  on \npublic procurement to guarantee the proper functioning of the internal market, it is up \nto  member  states  how  to  configure  or  regulate  PPPs.  Some  countries  posses  a \ndedicated  law  or  regulation,  others  a  comprehensive  legal  PPP  framework,  and  yet \nothers  no  legal  provisions  at  all.  Several  states  have  not  yet  gained  experience  in \nPPPs, see Table 4. \n\nAn  important  factor  in  the  development  of  successful  PPPs  in  member  states  is  the \nexistence  of  a  specialized  unit  promoting  PPPs.  \u201cPartnership  UK\u201d  in  the  United \nKingdom is at the forefront of promoting PPPs in the UK and abroad, and has adapted \nevaluation  tools  to  measure  their  impact. 9\n In  the  new  member  states  there  is,  for \nexample,  the  recently  established  \u201cPPP  Centrum\u201d  in  the  Czech  Republic,  created \nspecifically for such purposes. \n\nAs emphasized above, the legal frameworks can influence positively or negatively the \nperformance of PPPs. Successful PPPs are characterized by the transfer of financial \nrisk  totally  or  in  part  to  the  private  sector.  This  risk  transfer  is  what  makes  the \nperformance of PPPs superior, as private suppliers will tend to avoid running into time \nand  cost  overruns,  even  if  PPPs  do  incorporate  a  risk  premium.  In  Spain,  however, \nlegislation  on  PPPs  exempts  the  private  sector  from  risks  by  spelling  out  that  the \ngovernment always maintains responsibility in contracts involving the public party. \n\n                                                \n9 Comprehensive  information  on  PPP  use  in  the  UK  can  be  found  at  http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/ \n\nDOCUMENTS/PUBLIC_PRIVATE_PARTNERSHIPS/ppp_index.cfm  \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nTable 4: Status of PPP Institutional and Legal Structures in EU Member States \n\nUnit \nPPP \n\nPPP \nlaw \n\nPPP \nUnit  \n\nPPP \nlaw \n\n \n\n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\n\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 \n\n \n \nAustria \n\n\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\n \n \nCyprus \nCzech \nRepublic \nEstonia \nHungary \nLatvia \nLithuania \nMalta \nPoland \nSlovakia \nSlovenia \nBulgaria \nRomania \nCandidate countries: \n\u25b2\u25b2 \nTurkey \n \n \nSource: Adapted from PriceWaterHouseCoopers (2005) \n\nBelgium \nDenmark \nFinland \nFrance \nGermany \nGreece \nIreland \nItaly \nLuxembourg  _ \nNetherlands  \u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 \nPortugal \nSpain \nSweden \nUK \n\n\u25a0\u25a0 \n \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0\u25a0 \n \n\u25a0\u25a0 \n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \n\u25a0 \n \n \n\u25a0\u25a0 \n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \n \n \n\n\u25b2\u25b2 \n \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n \n\u25b2 \n\u25b2\u25b2 \n\u25b2 \n\n\u25b2\u25b2 \n \n \n\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 \n\n \n\n\u25a0\u25a0 \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \n\u25a0 \n \n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \n \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0 \n\u25a0\u25a0 \n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 \n \n\n\u25b2 Need for PPP unit \nidentified and some action \ntaken (or only a regional \nPPP unit existing) \n\u25b2\u25b2 PPP unit in progress (or \nexisting but in a purely \nconsultative capacity) \n\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 PPP unit existing \n(actively involved in PPP \npromotion) \n\u25a0 Legislation being proposed \n\u25a0\u25a0 Comprehensive legislation \nbeing drafted / some sector \nspecific legislation in place \n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Comprehensive \nlegislation in place \n\n5.2  European Commission Guidelines for PPPs \n\nThe  decision  to  use  or  not to  use  PPPs  lies  in  the  hands  of member  states. The  EU \nthrough  its  funds  for  structural  development  and  the  European  Investment  Bank  are \nready to co-finance projects which use the form of PPP for delivering public goods. \n\nThe  EU  is  neutral  as  to  whether  or  not  public  authorities  choose  to  provide  a  public \nservice themselves or entrust it to a third party. The form it is adopting, whether using \nnormal  public  procurement,  concessions  or  PPPs,  is  also  for  the  member  state  to \ndecide.  However,  the  involvement  of  private  parties  in  public  works  or  services  is \nregulated at EU level. \n\nThe law on public procurement and concessions aims to create an internal market in \nwhich  the  free  movement  of  people,  goods,  services,  as  well  as  the  right  of \nestablishment  and  the  principles  of  equal  treatment,  transparency,  and  mutual \nrecognition  are  guaranteed.  While  for  PPPs  the  rules  on  public  procurement  and \nconcessions  are  considered  sufficient,  the  European  Commission  has  produced  an \ninterpretation  of  the  rules  specifically  for  PPP.  The  current  legislation  on  public \nprocurement is the following: \n\nDirective 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 \ncoordinating  the  procurement  procedures  of  entities  operating  in  the  water,  energy, \ntransport, and postal services sectors (30.04.2004)  \n\nDirective 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 \non  the  coordination  of  procedures  for  the  award  of  public  works  contracts,  public \nsupply contracts and public service contracts (30.04.2004)  \n\nCommission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1564/2005  of  7  September  2005  establishing \nstandard  forms  for  the  publication  of  notices  in  the  framework  of  public  procurement \nprocedures  pursuant  to  Directives  2004/17/EC  and  2004/18/EC  of  the  European \nParliament and of the Council  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  directives  and  regulations  on  public  procurement,  the  Commission \nhas  issued  Communications  to  clarify  the  application  of  this  legislation  on  PPPs.  In \n2004 it launched a green paper combined with a public consultation to find issues that \n\n \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nhave  to  be  resolved  at  Community  level  on  PPPs.  This  was  followed  by  two \nCommunications interpreting Community law for PPPs. Those are: \n\nCommunication  from  the  Commission  to  the  European  Parliament,  the  Council,  the \nEuropean  Economic  and  Social  Committee  and  the  Committee  of  the  Regions  on \nPublic-Private  Partnerships  and  Community  Law  on  Public  Procurement  and \nConcessions (COM/2005/0569 final) \n\nCommission  interpretative  Communication  on  the  application  of  Community  law  on \nPublic  Procurement  and  Concessions  to  Institutionalized  Public-Private  Partnerships \n(IPPP), C(2007)6661 \n\nThere  are  many  formats  for  PPPs  used  in  the  different  countries.  The  EU  legislation \ndistinguishes  mainly  between  two  systems,  the  institutional  PPPs  and  contractual \nPPPs.  The  first  are  characterized  by  the  creation  of  an  institutional  joint  company,  a \nsingle  purpose  company  or  vehicle  held  by  the  public  and  private  parties  jointly.  For \nthe  specific  agreements \ninternational \nnomenclature  (OECD)  for  its  own  analytical  purposes,  but  member  states  are  not \nrequired to use this nomenclature.  \n\nthe  European  Commission  used \n\nthe \n\n6.  RISK AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF PRIVATE EQUITY \n\nThe  different  parties  in  a  PPP  agreement  have  different  objectives.  In  some  cases \nPPPs  are  not  possible  if  public  sector  goals  are  not  compatible  with  those  of  the \nprivate  sector.  In  the  case  of  universal  service  provision,  for  example,  the  private \nsector is not prepared to make losses to ensure that there is universal coverage with \nan  infrastructure  asset  or  service. In  such  cases, funding  and  demand risk  has to  be \nborne by the state.  \n\nTable  7  identifies  the  different  requirements  of  the  partners  in  an  agreement. \nDepending on what kind of project is planned, this can clarify the kind of approach to \nbe taken. \n\nIt  is  clear  that  the  private  sector  seeks  profits  while  the  public  sector  has \nconsiderations  relating  to  maximizing  social  welfare  as  well  as  equity.  The  public \nsector  has  therefore  an  obligation  to  ensure  that  services  for  the  population  are \nimproved,  projects  are  concluded  faster,  and  state  budget  expenditure  is  reduced. \nThere  are  thus  a  number  of  areas  where  public  and  private  sector  interests  may \nconverge. \n\nPPPs  involving  private  financing  are  also  likely  to  require  loans  from  international \nfinancial  institutions  such  as  the  EIB  in  Europe,  ADB  in  Asia,  or  the  World  Bank,  as \nwell  as  from  commercial  banks.  Such  institutions  require  rigorous  analysis  of  the \nfinancial returns of the project and the capabilities of the private contractors. \n\n6.1  Financial Implications of Risk \n\nRisk will determine the level of participation by the private sector as well as costs, as \nrisk  will  be  integrated  in  the  form  of  a  risk  premium  by  the  private  contracting  party. \nRevenue risks are the most fundamental factors affecting the private sector. Utilization \nlevels and user fees or tariffs determine the future viability of a project. Depending on \nthe  sector,  historic  price  data  may  or  may  not  exist.  For  roads,  traffic  data,  future \npotential,  and  willingness  to  pay  are  all  used  to  assess  the  viability  of  a  project.  But \nthere are always risks in the final estimates. The existence or quality of parallel routes \nmay affect considerable future revenues. Often shadow pricing of tolls with additional \ncompensatory payments are used if actual toll receipts fall short of forecasts.  \n\n \n\n22 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nPricing  of  the  potential  contractors  in  the  tender  procedure  also  needs  prior  precise \ncosts  studies to  be  carried  out  by the  state. To calculate  whether  bidders  are  putting \nforward reasonable figures (neither unreasonably and unrealistically low nor too high) \nthere is a need for public  sector  comparators, based on similar projects previously  \nundertaken  by  the  state.  This  would  help  evaluate  the  value  for  money  of  proposed \nprojects. \n\nIt  has  to  be  noted  that  experience  partially  contradicts  the  rules  on  risk  distribution. \nThere  is  in  practice  hardly  any  PPP  where  risks  are  fully  transferred  to  the  private \nsector. This is due to the public service nature of the projects financed. A collapse of a \npublic service cannot be accepted. Governments around the world have usually bailed \nout private operators which could not cover the capital requirements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nTable 5: Requirements of PPP Partners under Different PPP Arrangements \n\nPrivate Sector \nRequirements  \n\nService \nContracts  \n\nManagement \nContracts  \n\nLeases  \n\n Fair Profit  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nBOT \nAgree-\nments  \nRequired  \n\nDBFO \nConces-\nsions  \nRequired  \n\nPartial \nDivesti-\nture  \nRequired  \n\nFull \nDivestiture \n\nRequired  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nAutomatic  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\n\u2013  \nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nReward for Risk \nMitigation  \nClear Legal / \nRegulatory Structure  \n Growth Potential  \n\n Political Support  \n\n Political Stability  \n\nBeneficiary \nGovernment \nRequirements \n Leveraging Funding  \n\n Accelerating Project \nImplementation  \n Improving Service \nLevels  \n Improving Service \nCoverage  \n Efficiency Gains  \n\n Ease of \nImplementation  \nLender \nRequirements \nRigorous Financial \nAnalysis  \nConservative \nCost/Revenue \nAssumptions  \nCertainty of Grant \nand State funding  \nClear Legal regulator \nstructure  \n Technical Ability of \nOwner/Operator  \n Political Stability  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\nSource: Based on European Commission. 2003, p. 18 \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nImportant  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes  \n\nYes \n\nYes \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\n \n\nYes  \n\n\u2013  \n\nYes  \n\n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\n\u2013  \n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\n6.2  Type and allocation of risks \n\nThe  public  sector  also  runs  risks  by  having  to  award  to  a  company  a  public  infrastructure \ndevelopment  or  service  which  in  the  end  it  may  not  be  able  to  deliver.  Another  risk  is  that \nlarge contracts for long periods may create a monopoly provider in the private sector which \nwill  impact  costs  and  quality.  Finally,  corruption  can  cause  severe  impacts  on  selection, \ncosts and quality. \n\nConstruction  risks for  large  infrastructures  are  important.  Cost  overruns  and  delays  have \nbeen  common  in  public  sector  procurement.  In  PPPs,  however,  these  have  been \nconsiderably reduced when the private sector has borne the costs of such risks. The tender \nwill include a risk premium, but the overall costs of the project are often lower as the private \nsector tends to avoid overruns more efficiently. \n\nFor  international  operations  foreign  exchange  risk  is  a  considerable  problem.  Project \nviability  can  be  affected  if  lenders  are  foreign.  For  developing  countries  this  risk  is  not \nnegligible. \n\nRegulatory / contractual risk is a problem for the private sector. Governments may change \ntheir  contractual  terms.  This  is  a  risk  especially  for  sensitive  issues  such  as  user  fees.  In \nsome  cases,  public  opinion  on  the  infrastructure  and  the  service  charges  may  prompt  the \ngovernment  to  renege  on  its  agreement.  Such  situations  may  cause  strains  also  with \nfinancial lenders. \n\nIn  some  countries,  political  risks  are  considerable.  These  are  not  only  to  be  found  in \ncountries  with  unstable  political  systems,  but  also  in  stable  democracies.  Infrastructure \nassets  that  have  the  potential  to  attract  popular  opposition,  such  as  waste  incinerators  or \nroads  and  motorways,  may  create  enough  pressure  for  politicians  to  renege  on  their \nposition;  this  is  a  public  acceptance  risk.  When  such  risks  exist,  private  contractors  will \nrequire compensatory guarantees or risk insurance which adds to the cost of the project.  \n\nUnforeseen  environmental  concerns  during  project  development  or  archaeological \nfindings may also create calls to take mitigating actions which should be taken into account \nin the provisions of the PPP agreements. \n\nLatent  Defect  risk  may  appear  in  privatized  infrastructure  assets,  when  concessions  are \ngiven  to  improve  and  maintain  existing  infrastructures.  The  state  of  these  assets    may  be \nworse than anticipated adding to costs. \n\nHidden  Protectionism  private  contractors  are  concerned  over  preferences  by  public \nofficials,  often  these  are  preferences  to  offer  the  contracts  to  national  companies. \nSometimes these preferences are caused by popular political pressure. Foreign contractors \nare  sometimes  mistrusted.  This  has  occurred  in  the  new  member  states.  The  Commission \nconsiders the popular opposition to the involvement of a foreign company as the cause for \nthe abandonment of a concession for a motorway in Hungary. Interestingly the Commission \nnotes  that  open  public  procurement,  instead  of reducing  opposition to foreign  participation, \nincreases  it,  probably  due  to  lack  of  information  when  contracts  are  awarded  in  a  less \ntransparent manner. Proper public procurement and PPPs should be carefully prepared and \nconsulted  with  civil  society  if  there  is  a  risk  of  disruption.

This has important \nimplications  in  public  expenditure  reporting  and  thus  for  the  determination  of  the  budget \ndeficit.  Within  the  EU,  all  budget  deficit  reporting  is  central  because  of  the  budget  deficit \ncriteria of the EU, especially for members of the Euro zone. The financial reporting (or not) of \nPPPs has therefore both economic and political importance.  \n\nPPPs can be off balance sheet if the private sector bears most of the financial risks of the \nPPPs.  Concessions  with  user  fees  fully  financing  the  project  and  with  demand  and \nconstruction risks can be treated off balance (Figure 3 presents a schematic view). \n\nProjects where finance is private and the risks are fully held by the private sector are not to \nbe included in the government budget. \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nBudget decision tree on DBFO contracts \n\nPPP is private \ninvestment \n\nWill government be \nthe main \npurchaser?  \n\nYes \n\nWill the partner \nbear the \nconstruction \n\n \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nWill the partner \nbear the availability \nrisk? \n\nWill the partner \nbear the demand \nrisk? \n\nYes \n\nPPP is on \ngovernment\u2019s \nbalance sheet \n\nSource: EIB 2004, p.20 \n\n \n\n6.3.1  Projects on balance sheet upfront \n\nDBOF projects where the public sector partner carries the construction risk in relation to the \nproject or carries both the availability and demand risk have to be budgeted up front.  \n\nIf the DBOF project is on the Government\u2019s balance sheet, then the full construction costs \ncount  against  the  government  budget  over  the  construction  period.  The  capital  element  of \nthe subsequent annual payments by government does not affect the budget balance but the \ninterest and service charge element does. \n\n \n\n \n\nNo \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nDesign, Build, Finance (DBF) projects where the contract between the private sector partner \nand  the  government  has  the  characteristics  of  a  financial  lease  i.e.  the  government  is \neffectively  buying  rather  than  hiring  the  asset  and  the  balance  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of \nownership lie with the government. \n\nProjects that do not involve private sector finance. These could be either:  \n\na) Conventional public procurement projects; \n\nb) Design, Build, Operate (DBO) projects or \n\nc) Design, Build (DB) projects.  \n\n6.3.2  Projects off balance sheet with payments spread over the period of \n\nimplementation \n\nFor DBOF projects where the private sector partner carries the construction risk and carries \neither the availability or the demand risk in relation to the project, the balance sheet will not \nbe  affected  upfront  but  the  impact  will  be  spread  over  the  PPP  contract  period.  The  same \napplies  to  Design,  Build,  Finance  (DBF)  projects  where  the  contract  between  the  private \nsector  partner  and  the  government  has  the  characteristics  of  an  operating  lease  i.e.  the \ngovernment is effectively hiring rather than buying the asset and the balance of the risks and \nrewards of ownership lie with the private sector partner. \n\nIn this case, during the construction period there is no impact on the budget balance or the \nnational  debt.  However, after  the  construction  period  and  during the  operating  phase, the \ngovernment budget balance and the government debt are worsened by the amounts of the \nregular unitary payment paid by government to the private sector partner.   \n\n6.4  Hybrid PPPs and state budgeting \n\nIn some cases a project may be partially funded by capital grant from government and the \nbalance  funded  by  user  charges.  Government  grants  do  not  necessarily  bring  a  project  on \nbalance sheet provided they do not cover the majority (more than 50%) of the capital cost. In \ncases  where  the  capital  grant  from  government  exceeds  50%  of  the  total  capital  cost,  the \nasset will be recorded on the government\u2019s balance sheet over the construction period and \nwill  therefore  affect  the  government  budget  over  this  period.  However,  the  government \nbudget and debt impact will be reduced by the imputed value of the sale of the concession to \nthe private sector partner. The net impact on the budget upfront will therefore be the value of \nthe  capital  grant  paid  to  the  private  sector  partner.  The  user  charges  will  accrue  to  the \nprivate  sector  partner  as  they  are  paid  and  will  have  no  impact  on  the  government  budget \n(except where there is gain-sharing provided for in the contract). \n\n6.5  Performance of PPPs in the European Union \n\nReviews of PPPs in the EU were performed for the European Parliament (2006a and 2006b) \nand present the stages of adoption across EU countries. The mix of first movers can appear \nstrange  at  first  sight.  On  the  one  hand  there  are  countries  which  are  economically  and \nadministratively  very  developed  and,  on  the  other  hand,  poorer  Mediterranean  cohesion \ncountries10\n. The wealthier and mostly Nordic countries considered the PPPs as an option to \nincrease the value for money for the provision of public services. These counties considered \nthat the private sector is able to deliver a certain number of goods more efficiently than the \npublic  sector  and  would  be  able  to  handle the financial  risks  better.  For the  Mediterranean \n\n                                                \n10 Cohesion  countries  in  the  EU  are  those  which  have  an  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  per  capita \nbelow  90%  of  the  EU  average.  The  present  cohesion  countries  are  Bulgaria,  Cyprus,  the  Czech  Republic, \nEstonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Spain \nis eligible for a phasing-out period after losing this status in 2006.  \n\n \n\n28 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\ncohesion  countries,  PPPs  were  necessary  to  implement  ambitious  heavy  infrastructural \ninvestment programs (especially in transport) which would not have been possible to finance \nthrough the public sector alone. However, PPPs were rarely used to cover the co-financing \nrequirements  of  EU  funds,  but  rather  to  finance  other  public  projects,  sometimes  separate \nparts of a single project. This will be further discussed below. \n\nToday  the  most  advanced  users  of  PPPs  are  not  always  those  who  started  earlier.  These \nare  the  UK,  France,  Ireland,  Germany,  and  Italy.  These  advanced  users  have  expanded \nPPPs  to  many  sectors,  including  healthcare,  education,  and  prisons  and  have  the \nappropriate legal and regulatory tools, as well as specialized task forces to ensure that PPP \nexpertise is developed and centralized. \n\nIt is estimated that in the EU (also including Norway and Turkey) PPP deals between 1995 \nand 2004 were estimated to be worth US$120 billion. Of that total, the UK accounted for two-\nthirds, while Spain and Portugal each accounted for 9%\u201310% (Figure 4). \n\nFigure 4: Average 2000 to 2005 PPP Activity as a Percentage of Mean GDP \n\nSource PriceWaterhouseCoopers 2005, p.37 \n\n \n\nThe  UK  has  the  largest  program  of  PPPs,  with  800  projects  signed  since  1992.  The  most \ncommon form of  PPP  is  the  PFI,  with  650  developments  worth  a  total  capital  value  of  \u00a359 \nbillion to date (data from UK HM Treasury, March 2008). The PFIs have the characteristic of \nbeing  financed  by  the  private  sector  completely  with  the  public  sector  only  providing \ntechnical  and  legal  support.  According  to  the  EIB  (2004)  public  procurement  in  the  UK \nrepresents  25%  of  all  PPPs  in  the  EU.  While  the  UK  uses  PPPs  across  the  government \nexpenditure  portfolio,  other  countries  use  PPPs mainly  for transport  infrastructure,  but  they \nare being extended to other sectors, in particular to water, health and education.  \n\nThe share of PPP in EU public expenditure has not yet been estimated in any detail, but that \nPPPs  are  nevertheless  sparingly  used  can  be  inferred  by  the  estimates  for  the  UK  for \n2004/05 fiscal year (Sawyer, 2005). The value of PPPs in total public expenditure was less \nthan  1%  of  public  expenditure.  However,  using  public  investment  after  depreciation  and \nasset sales as an indicator, one can estimate that the \u00a34 billion directly contracted over the \nperiod represents a sixth of the total \u00a322 billion public investment.  \n\nOther  countries  have  been  less  enthusiastic  in  embracing  PPPs.  In  some  countries, \ntransferring development and management of public infrastructures to the private sector runs \ncounter to established public policy traditions. The transfer of healthcare, education or prison \nfacilities to the private sector has encountered considerable resistance from citizens of some \nmember  states.  For  some  utilities  and  transport  infrastructure  such  popular  constraints  do \nnot  exist,  but  the  administrative  structures  do  not  promote  it.  The  vast  majority  of  public \ninfrastructure  is  still  funded  by  public  (national  or  EU)  resources  through  traditional  public \nprocurement.  While  the  success  of  PPPs  in  various  countries  is  changing  attitudes,  heavy \n\n \n\n29 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nadministrative  requirements  combined  with  a  prevailing  view  in  some  quarters  that  normal \nprocurement methods can be cheaper  keeps some public authorities away from embracing \nPPPs.  \n\nThe \u201cintermediate adopters\u201d of PPPs are Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, where PPPs \nhave  been  successfully  used  mainly  in  major  infrastructure  projects. In these  countries  the \nextension to other sectors has been hampered by political or administrative barriers. Greece \nhas implemented some advanced PPPs for the building of Athens airport, roads and leisure \nfaculties, but there is an absence of PPP initiatives in all other sectors. Figure 5 presents the \nuse of PPPs in EU member states by sector. \n\nAmong  the  group  of  \u201clatecomers\u201d  to  PPPs,  such  as  Luxembourg  or  Sweden,  the  main \nargument cited against the use of PPPs is the aforementioned resistance to allow the private \nsector  to  intervene  in  the  public  domain.  It  is  also  the  case  that  the  better  management  of \npublic finances and larger public resources in such countries reduce the need for embarking \non  the  often  difficult  route  of  PPPs  to  provide  public  services.  Even  within  member  states \nthere are differences across regions. \n\nFor  the  new  member  states,  the  PPP  experience  has  been  mixed  and  not  immediately \nsuccessful.  Initially,  PPPs  were  considered  an  appropriate  solution  given  budgetary \nconstraints in the public sector and the possibility to spread costs over the whole life cycle of \na  project  and  avoiding  the  need  to  finance  the  construction  phase.  Favorable  lending \nconditions from international financial institutions encouraged this position. The use of PPPs \nhas,  however,  been  very  limited.  The  main  problem  has  been  the  difficulty  in  overcoming \nhuman resource deficiencies and administrative capacity. Some of the most common causes \nof  problems  were  inappropriate  risk  evaluations  and  the  overestimation  of  potential  final \ndemand11\n. \n\nSome of the reluctance to use PPPs originates from within the European Commission itself, \nin particular the Directorate-General for Regional Policy. Its position with regard to PPPs is \nstill  lukewarm.  By  contrast,  the  DG  responsible  for  Trans  European  Networks  is  actively \npromoting  PPPs.  The  large  discrepancy  in  budgetary  means  between  the  two  institutions \nmay well be a central reason for this divergence in position.  \n\nMost  member  states  and  the  EU  institutions  have  largely  preferred  a  public  finance  only \napproach  to  infrastructure  development,  due  to  its  relative  simplicity.  The  EU  provides \nconsiderable  structural  funding  to  poorer  member  states,  either  as  grants,  which  for  some \ncountries  can  cover  over  85%  of  costs  or  through  loans  by  the  EIB.  However,  with \ninfrastructure requirements exceeding the joint capacity of EU support and national funding \nand  with  pressures  to  control  public  deficits,  member  states  and  the  EU  institutions  have \nincreasingly  experimented  with  PPPs.  The  EIB  has  been  of  great  help  in  providing  the \ntechnical knowledge and necessary guarantees to attract private funding. \n\nUsually  PPPs  are  only  considered  where  EU  structural  support  is  low  compared  to  project \nsize,  such  as  is  the  case  of  Trans  European  Networks  (TENs)  in  wealthy  EU  countries, \nwhere support is in the order of 10% of costs. In poorer member states with support covering \nup  to  85%  of  public  expenditure,  PPPs  are  not  encouraged  as  pressure  to  comply  with \nexpenditure  timescale  restrictions  discourages  the  lengthy  and  complex  PPP  procurement \nand  financial  engineering  requirements  involved.  Most  of  the  efficiency  gains  and  risk \ntransmission  to  private  operators  is  also  lost  when  a  large  part  of  the  infrastructure  is \nfinanced by the public sector and thus risk transfer to the private sector is very limited. \n\n                                                \n11 Brenck, A., et al. 2005, p. 82\u2013111. \n\n \n\n30 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nFigure 5: Use of PPPs in EU member states by sector  \n\nSource: PWC (2005), p.36 \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\n \n\n7.  USE OF PPPS FOR EU CROSS-BORDER \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE \n\nThe use of PPP financing for cross-border infrastructure is a complex subject. The EU does \nnot  have  a  stated  preference  for  PPPs,  and  it  is  in  the  hands  of  member  states  how  to \nfinance  and  run  public  projects.  Hence,  the  use  of  PPPs  varies  considerably  between \nmember  states.  The  use  of  PPPs  has  in  effect  been  quite  limited.  In  fact,  most  national \ngovernments  view  PPPs  as  a  last  resort,  as  these  are  time  consuming  and  complex  to \nprepare.  Many  TEN  projects  in  poorer  member  states  and  regions  are  financed  by  a \nsubstantial contribution from EU funds. Thus the use of hybrid PPPs where public alongside \nprivate funding is involved is discouraged. Many wealthier member states avoid PPPs, with \nthe exception of the UK and to a certain extent France and Italy.  \n\nThe  fact  that  co-financing  of  transport  infrastructure  can  cover  up  to  75%  (in  some  cases \n85%)  of  costs  in  cohesion  countries12\n discourages  the  use  of  private  funding  for  remaining \ncosts.  According  to  PriceWaterhouseCoopers  (2006)  the  way  funds  are  officially  reported \ndiscourages the combination of private funding with EU funds, even if the regulations do not \nexclude the use of private financing for \u201ccohesion\u201d projects. \n\nWhat  seems  to  be  recurrent  practice  is  to  use  different  procurement  systems  for  different \nsections of a project, such as transport projects. This means that a road from A to C through \nB is financed from A to B by public funds (EU funds and national) and from B to C through a \nPPP.  For  other  infrastructure,  such  as  water  treatment  plants,  public  funds  may  cover  the \nconstruction,  while  the  network  itself  is  financed  through  private  funds.  The  private  sector \nthen  operates  the  whole  system  and  uses  fees  to  recover  the  capital  investment  and \noperational costs of the whole project, excluding the public grants. While this simplifies some \nof  the  administrative  issues,  it  goes  counter  to  the  idea  of  a  PPP  containing  the  whole  life \ncycle of an integrated infrastructure asset, blending capital and operational costs. One of the \nreasons  that  DPFOs  offer  value  for  money  is  that  they  reduce  the  risk  of  time  and  cost \noverruns. \n\nAlso  worth  noting  is  that  in  most  cases,  cross-border  infrastructure  is  treated  differently  on \neither side of a border. Member states have their own administrative and financial systems \nto  develop  infrastructure  in  their  territory  and  there  is  often  little  coordination  between \ncountries. Cases where cross-border infrastructure has been treated as a single joint project \nare  very  rare,  but  the  EU  has  created  a  supranational  regulation  allowing  for  European \ncompanies.  Not  originally  designed  for  this  purpose,  this  regulation  has  facilitated  the \nimplementation of cross-border projects as a single operation. \n\n7.1  Suitability and effectiveness of alternative PPP structures  \n\nThe  various  forms  of  PPP  all  have  advantages  and  disadvantages  and  are  more  or  less \nsuitable  depending  on  the  project.  PPP  structures  are  not  a  \u201cbetter\u201d  solution  to  traditional \nprocurement  per  se  and  have  a  number  of  significant  drawbacks,  particularly  the  rigorous \nrequirements  imposed  on  the  tender  procedure.  Ultimately,  the  final  choice  will  depend  on \nthe project contents and the sector of activity. \n\nThe  case  of  transport  infrastructure.  Transport  was  one  of  the  first  areas  where  PPP  was \nused.  The  decision  to  use  a  PPP  as  well  as  its  type  will  partially  depend  on  the  potential \nprofitability of the infrastructure asset. Traditional or BOT procurement systems are generally \nused  where  the  public  sector finances the totality  of the  infrastructure  asset  and the  public \nsector will pay user fees based on the performance of the private sector, but taking over the \n                                                \n12 Cohesion countries: Countries which have an average GDP per capita below 90% of the EU average. \n\n \n\n32 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\ndemand risk. There is also another variant were the construction phase is in the hands of the \nprivate sector, but the public sector pays the fees over the operational period based on the \nprivate  sector\u2019s  performance.  It  is  for  the  private  sector  to  achieve  the  quality  of  service \ncontractually required. \n\nFor  motorways,  DBFO  could  be  based  on  a  toll system. This  is the  case  in  projects  which \nhave  long-term  profitability.  The  private  sector  finances,  maintains,  and  operates  the \nmotorway,  repaying  construction  costs  from  toll  returns.  Tolls  can  be  real  or  shadow  tolls. \nShadow tolls are payments by the state which are based on the use of the motorway, thus \ndemand risk is in the private sector even if the public sector actually pays the whole lifecycle. \nWith real tolls, the public sector transfers all the risks to the private sector and does not use \npublic  resources.  Of  course  shadow  tolls  have  disadvantages:  as  motorists  do  not  pay  for \nusage costs, allocation of resources may not be rational.  \n\nFor small transport infrastructure projects PPPs are not recommended, unless bundled in a \nlarger contract. \n\nThe  case  of  water  projects.  The  wastewater  treatment  and  water  distribution  sectors  have \nseen  the  participation  of  the  private  sector  for  a  number  of  years.  The  EU  has  introduced \nvery high standards in the water sector13\n resulting in substantial capital requirements. Many \ncountries  are  looking  at  PPPs  to  find  the  resources  and  expertise  to  handle  the  costs  and \noperational needs. The reasoning behind the choice of PPP is similar to the transport sector \nand depends on the size of the projects, the ability to charge users and risk transfer. There is \na  tendency  to  transfer  costs  fully  to  water  users  to  ensure  the  rational  use  by  consumers, \nwhich  favors  a  DBFO  concession  type  of  PPP  with  user  charges.  The  public  sector  is \nincreasingly less suited to operating the complex treatment processes. \n\nIn addition to transport and water infrastructure PPPs have been increasingly applied in the \nhealth  and  education  services,  where  the  private  sector  has  financed  and  built  facilities  in \nexchange  for  a  maintenance  and  operational  contract  for  an  extensive  period  after \ncompletion. \n\n7.2  Hybrid PPPs in the EU: mixing grants with private funding \n\nEU regulations for structural funds, cohesion funds, pre-accession funds or Trans European \nTransport  Networks  (TEN-T)  allow  for  EU  grant  support  to  be  co-financed  by  public  or \nprivate funding. The use of financial PPP mechanisms to co-finance EU grants has however \nbeen scant.  \n\nThe  use  of  EU  grants  in  PPPs  has  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.  Grants  can  add  to  the \nviability of a project, but increase the burden of the national authorities in a PPP procedure \nas the objectives of EU funds also need to be taken into account. The EU Commission has \nguidelines on the use of EU funds for infrastructures.  \n\nThe  concession  of  grants  should  in  theory  only  occur  if  the  financial  viability  of  an \ninfrastructure project of national and EU importance is not assured, thus not allowing a full \nPPP.  In  practice,  however, grants  have  not  been  assessed  according to  the  viability  of the \ninfrastructure under PPP arrangements. \n\nDue  to  limitations  in  public  budgets,  especially  in  the  new  member  states,  there  is  an \nincreased interest in mixing EU grants with private funding, such as to reduce the burden on \nthe public budget for co-financing the operations. Hybrid PPPs are thus considered as ways \nto  avoid  national  public  expenditure  contributions  to  infrastructure  rather  than  making  the \nprojects  viable  for  the  private  sector.  There  is  pressure  to  commit  EU  funds  to  projects  to \n\n                                                \n13 The  EU  has  advanced  and  stringent  drinking  and  waste  water  directives  setting  standards  for  all  member \n\nstates. \n\n \n\n33 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\navoid losing the annual budgeted amount or the return of any under-spent amounts two or \nthree years after committing to a project14\n. \n\nTo a certain extent, the existence of an EU grant can attract private funding to the project. \nProject  viability  risks  are  reduced  as  well  as  political  risks. On the  downside,  the  efficiency \ngains  of  a  PPP  with  a  full  lifecycle  costing  are  partially  lost  and  user  fees  and  returns  to \ninvestors  will  be  distorted.  The  EU  attaches  conditions  to  the  grants  which  can  cause \ndifficulties  in reaching  agreement  on  private  involvement,  in  particular  on  restrictions  in  the \nlevel  of  profits for  the  private  sector  as grants for  private  infrastructure have  strict  limits  on \nthe level of profits from user fees. This is designed to discourage the public or private sector \nto rely unduly on the benefit of an EU grant. Concessions thus allow only for user fees that \ncover  maintenance  of  the  infrastructure,  recovery  of  the  costs  from  lending  and  a  small \ndetermined  margin  of  profit.  Unfortunately,  this  also  implies  that  user  fees  attached  to  any \ninfrastructure  developed  with  EU  funding  cannot  incorporate  the  real  cost  of  the \ndevelopment, which runs counter to economic theory on optimal use of infrastructure.  \n\nEU strategy on private sector profit requires that the private sector does not receive profits \nresulting  from  the  receipt  of  a  grant.  Figure  6  describes  the  European  Commission\u2019s \nobjective,  which  is  to  eliminate  from  the  charges  of  the  operators  undue  profits  (Y-X) \ngenerated by the additional social impact from B to C of the grant. This requires a calculation \nof what the benefits for the private operator would be in the absence of the project grant.  \n\nThe  diagram  shows  three  outcomes  where  the  negotiation  totally  or  partially  eliminates \nprofits generated by the grant. Payments should limit the profits to the line X, which is based \non  the  repayment  of  the  privately-financed  capital  and  normal  profits  in  the  absence  of  a \ngrant.  When  the  price  negotiated  is  above  the  optimal,  the  final  social  benefit  or  value  for \nmoney,  however,  may  be  lower  or  higher.  This  depends  on  the  way  users  are  charged.  If \npayments  are  based  on  actual  tolls,  higher  payments  would  reflect  better  the  costs  of  the \nproject and the use would be more rational. In transport it could reduce pollution increasing \nsocial  benefits. It  is for the  public  sector to  determine  the  level  of  charges. Of  course,  with \nshadow  tolls  or  other  public  payments  to  the  operator  over  the  lifetime  of  the  project, \npayments should avoid being in excess of level X. \n\n                                                \n14 As a basic principle, the n+2 rule (n+3 for a transition period in new member states) requires that annual grant \nfunds offered to member states need to be committed to projects in that year\u2019s budget and spent within two to \nthree years.  \n\n \n\n34 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nAccounting for Private Sector Excessive Profits. \n\nPrivate sector profit & repayment of \ncapital \n \n\nNegotiated fees to \navoid excessive \nprofits \n\nY \n\nX \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\nA \n\nB \n\nC \n\nOA: Social \nbenefit of a \npurely public \nprocurement \nproject \n\nAdditional \nsocial \nbenefit of a \nPPP \n\nAdditional \nbenefit of a \ngrant \n\nD \n\nSocial benefit \nValue for Money \n\nUnclear final social \nbenefit depending on \nfee renegotiation, due \nto impacts on \noperation and use by \nsociety. \n\nSource: Adapted and expanded version from European Commission (2003), p. 62 \n\n \n\nFor  new  EU  member  states  the  initial  tendency  in  any  case  has  been  to  match  EU  funds \ndirectly to public funds, not leaving any space for private funding. This  is partly because of \nlack of knowledge about PPPs within public administrations. In practice, even if PPPs were \nconsidered,  the  administrative  capacity  of  the  countries  and  the  lack  of  appropriate \nbureaucratic procedures have impeded private involvement in infrastructure projects. Hence, \nlimited private participation was not primarily a response to the rules regarding the use of EU \ngrant funds. \n\n35 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nTable 7: European Commission Requirements on Hybrid PPPs  \n\nCommission \nRequirements  \n\nService \nContracts  \n\nManagement \nContracts  \n\nLeases  \n\nBOT \nAgreements  \n\nRelevant  \n\nDBFO \nConces-\nsions1  \nRelevant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nRelevant  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\nRequired  \n\n\u2013  \n\nYes  \n\nAttaining European \nStandards  \nMaximizing Societal \nBenefits  \nTransparency / Open \nCompetition  \nReasonable Control of \nGrant Funds  \nAvoiding Undue Private \nProfit  \nEfficiency Gains  \n\nLeveraging Private \nFunds  \n \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\n\u2013  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nDesirable  \n\nImportant  \n\nImportant  \n\nSource: Based on European Commission 2003, p. 18 \n\nNote: For partial or full divestiture the requirements are the same as for DBFO concessions \n\nHybrid PPPs using EU funding also have additional particularities. Although member states \nare responsible  under  strict  EU guidelines for the  approval  and  implementation  of  projects, \nfor  large  infrastructure  projects  the  EU  has  prior  control  in the  approval  process  (this  is for \ncohesion funds for transport infrastructure projects costing over \u20ac50 million and \u20ac25 million \nfor  environmental  infrastructure). In the case  of  infrastructure funds for  candidate  countries \nto the EU, the European Commission always exercised prior implementation control, limiting \nconsiderably the room for manoeuvre of governments. The new Instrument of Pre-accession \nAssistance  to  candidate  countries,  (IPA),  introduces  better  shared  responsibilities  in  the \napproval and implementation of projects with a gradual transfer to national authorities. This \nis to improve the smoothness in the introduction of EU practices.  \n\nHowever,  there  are  barriers  in  the  use  of  hybrid PPPs,  especially for  DBFOs,  even  though \nthese  are  increasingly  used  to  spread the  costs of  infrastructure  over time. This  allows  the \ninitial costs to be carried by the private financial sector which is then repaid through yearly \nservice charges which cover the repayments and interest  from loans and a service fee for \nthe  operator,  e.g.,  in  relation  to  shadow  tools.  Unfortunately,  such  arrangements  are \ndiscouraged  if  EU  funds  are  used.  First  EU  co-financing  rules  do  not  allow  covering \noperational expenditure, although this can be circumvented as it is, in effect repaying capital \nexpenditure.  The  most  difficult  barrier  is  the  multiannual  framework  of  the  EU  budget.  The \nEU budget is a very rigid instrument which is agreed for seven years without the flexibility of \nnational budgets. The EU cannot commit funds beyond these seven-year periods, creating a \nbudgetary risk for the national government and the operator. The restrictions placed on EU \nexpenditure discourage DSFO PPPs linking payments over the life of the project. \n\n8.  THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK IN \n\nPPPS \n\nThe  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  was  established  by  the  European  Economic \nCommunity  in  1958  with  a  mandate  to  lend  money  to  the  public  and  private  sectors  for \nprojects of European interest, such as: \n\n\u2022  Regional cohesion and convergence \n\n\u2022  Support for SMEs \n\n\u2022  R&D and innovation \n\n\u2022  Transport \n\n \n\n36 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\n\u2022  Environment \n\n\u2022  Energy \n\nThe EIB is a non-profit making and policy driven bank and limits its activities to offering long-\nterm loans for investment projects.  \n\nThe EIB is owned by the member states of the EU and they jointly contribute to its capital, \neach  country  contributing  in  relation  to  its  economic  weight  within  the  EU.  The  subscribed \ncapital in 2007 was \u20ac164.8 billion. The statutory lending ceiling is set at 250% of subscribed \ncapital.  \n\nLiquidity  is  monitored  with  a  view  to  matching  disbursement  needs.  Consistently  earned \nprofits are generally transferred to reserves and policies and controls are in place to manage \nrisk. \n\nAs EU member states are the shareholders of the EIB, it carries the highest credit rating of \ntriple-A  (AAA).  Hence,  the  EIB  can  easily  raise  capital  at  very  competitive  terms.  The  EIB \ncannot lend more than 50% of the total cost of any individual project.  \n\nThe projects which the bank invests in have to be in line with EU objectives, and these must \nbe  sound  economically, financially,  technically,  and  environmentally,  and  should  be  able  to \nattract other sources of funding. The EIB is an autonomous institution of the EU and it makes \nits own decisions purely on the merits of each project.  \n\n8.1  Role of the EIB in European PPPs \n\nThe  EIB  has  traditionally  borrowed  to  co-finance  public  infrastructure  developments  in \nmember  states,  especially  those  receiving  EU  regional  development  grants.  It  has  also \nborrowed for  projects  outside the  EU. The  bank concentrates  its  efforts on  poorer  member \nstates and in 2005, 93% of its signed loans were granted within the enlarged EU with a large \npart benefiting from guarantees from member states or public institutions.  \n\nIn 2006 the EIB lent \u20ac45,7 billion; with 87.1% of this amount going to EU member states, 7% \nto enlargement countries, 3% to Mediterranean neighbors, 1.8% to ACP-OCT-South Africa15\n \nand 1.1% to Asia and Latin America (EIB data). \n\nThe  EIB  has  no  specific  preference  for  lending  to  public  or  private  funds  but  has  been \npromoting  a  larger  use  of  PPPs.  The  bank  promotes  its  role  as  a  complementary  financial \nintermediary alongside other funders, i.e. commercial banks and capital markets. Many EIB \nloans to PPP projects are either bank-guaranteed or monoline-insured.  \n\nThe bank is very attentive to credit tests and is known for its conservative approach to the \nquality  of  projects.  EIB  involvement  in  any  project  is  considered  as  a  strong  guarantee  for \ncommercial banks in their decision to finance parts of a PPP.  \n\nMany PPPs are underpinned by public sector support; often some components of the risks \nare fully borne by the public sector, such as demand risks, which reduce the EIB\u2019s risks and \nalso the risks borne by the private sector financier. \n\nThe role  of  PPPs  has  been  steadily  increasing  in  the  EIB\u2019s  portfolio:  over  \u20ac20  billion  since \n2006 (despite a fall in 2004\u20132005, Figure 6), but this only accounts for a small fraction of EIB \nlending , which is mostly given over to the co-financing  with public funds. \n\n                                                \n15 ACP:  African  Caribbean  and  Pacific,  OCT:  Overseas  Countries  and  Territories.  The  twenty-one \nOCTs depend constitutionally on four of the EU Member States: Denmark, France, the Netherlands, \nand the UK. OCT nationals are EU citizens. However, these countries do not form part of Community \nterritory. Accordingly, Community law does not apply directly to them but they benefit from associate \nstatus conferred on them by the EU Treaty. \n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nFigure 6: Value of PPP Signatures per Year, million \u20ac \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: EIB (2005), p.21 \n\nA very large share of the bank\u2019s lending has focused on transport, even if other sectors have \nincreased in importance over recent years, such as significant investment in education and \nhealth in the UK (See figure 7).  \n\nFigure 7: Breakdown per Sector \n\nSource: EIB (2005), p.21 \n\nThe median loan maturity of transport projects is 20 years.

Synthesis Report. Appendix I, p.32 \n\nThe  EIB  has  a  positive  influence  on  the  stability  and  added  value  of  the  projects  it  co-\nfinances.  The  bank  offers  long  loan  maturities  and  capital  grace  periods  which  are \nparticularly appropriate for large infrastructure projects. This improves the affordability of the \ninvestment for the public sector, but also for potential private lenders. The solid analysis and \ninput of the EIB in project appraisal and selection has also increased the economic quality of \nprojects. The bank does not sell project debt until maturity, contrary to common practice with \nother lenders. \n\nAs an impartial not-for-profit organization, the bank participates closely in the whole project, \nfrom  design  to  selection  of  contractors  and  monitoring.  The  EIB  has  developed  flexible \nfinancing  structures  for  PPPs  and  adapts  the  financial  system  to  the  needs  of  the  project. \nThe bank has reinforced specific procedures for facilitating PPPs. One area is the extension \nof different financial mechanisms and of securitization to facilitate the participation of private \nlenders.  \n\nThe EIB also has set up a Structured Finance Facility (SFF), in order to match the types of \nfunding to the requirements of projects with a high-risk profile. This facility assists in pursuing \nits equity financing and guarantee operations in favor of large-scale infrastructure schemes. \nThe EIB had total reserves of \u20ac750 million over the period 2004 to 2007 for the purpose of \ngenerating operations amounting to between \u20ac1.5 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion, providing a broad \nmix of financial products: \n\n\u2022  senior loans and guarantees incorporating pre-completion and early operational risk;  \n\n\u2022  subordinated loans and guarantees ranking ahead of shareholder subordinated debt;  \n\n\u2022  mezzanine  finance,  including  high-yield  debt  for  industrial  companies  in  transition \n\nfrom SME scale or in the course of restructuring;  \n\n\u2022  project-related derivatives. \n\nThe  aim  of  the  SFF  is  increase  the  added  value  of  priority  projects  by  complementing  the \ncommercial banks and capital markets.  \n\n8.2 \n\nImpact of PPPs on the EIB \n\nThe  increasing  importance  of  PPPs  in  the  EIB  has  required  an  increased  in  the  bank\u2019s \nappraisal,  structuring  and  negotiating  capacity.  The  appraisal  of  risks  requires  the \ncoordinated work of different parts of operational branches of the bank. The analysis of the \npromoter\u2019s  technical  and  market  studies,  in-house  assessment  of  risk  and  the  capacity  to \nperform detailed analysis of the technical merits of contracts is necessary. \n\nThe bank has had to increase its monitoring capacity, in particular in cases  where projects \nrely on revenues from the asset. The increased demands also needed proper integration in \nthe pricing and cost recovery agreements negotiated with the borrowers.  \n\n \n\n39 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nThe  EIB\u2019s  success  in  operating  in  the  EU  is  partially  due  to  the  EU\u2019s  solid  regulatory \nframework and the relatively low political risks involved when lending to projects linked to EU \nobjectives and national objectives which are underpinned by the support of governments in \nthe beneficiary countries.  \n\nThe  imposition  by  the  EU  of  public  procurement  rules  to  member  states  has  facilitated  the \nwork  of  the  EIB,  avoiding  the  need  for  the  bank  to  create  the  basic  structures  of  public \nprocurement in each country and every case. The member states can rely on the guidance \nof the EU and the assistance of other member states in developing the needed structures. \nThe bank nevertheless advises the countries on adapting the procurement procedure to the \nneeds of PPP contracts. \n\n9.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF PPP IN THE EU  \n\nFour  case  studies  have  been  selected  for  their  particular  characteristics  and  the  different \nlessons than can be drawn from them. The text concentrates on these lessons rather than \nthe  details  of  the  project  development.  The  case  studies  chosen  are:  the  Channel  Tunnel \nRail  Link  between  France  and  the  UK;  the  Beiras  Litoral  and  Alta  Shadow  Toll  Road, \nPortugal; the M5 tolled motorway, Hungary; the Perpignan Figueiras Rail Concession, cross-\nborder link between France and Spain; the Trakia Motorway Project, Bulgaria.16\n  \n\n9.1  The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) \n\nThe Channel Tunnel rail link is a good example of a highly complex and very costly cross-\nborder project. Interestingly, the planning and financing of the service and the UK side of the \ndevelopment were undertaken separately to the French side of the construction. France has \nprovided  the  rail  tracks  and  the  French  Eurotunnel  company  was  set  up  to  use  half  the \ntunnel\u2019s capacity. The trains themselves are made in France using tested TGV17\n technology. \n\nThis paper only discusses the British side of the Channel Tunnel. This was envisaged as a \nPPP  concession,  with  the  private  sector  designing,  building,  financing  and  operating  the \n and \nCTRL  for  90  years.  Initially,  Eurostar  was  owned  and  launched  by  SNCF,  SNCB\nBritish  Rail.  In  June  1996,  the  UK  operations  were  sold  to  London  &  Continental  Railways \n(LCR). In October 1996, LCR changed the name to Eurostar UK Ltd (EUKL).  \n\n18\n\nThe first part of the CTRL was completed in 1993. However, passenger numbers were less \nthan half expectations. These were vastly overestimated and also did not take into account \nthe  emergence  of  low-cost  airline  companies.  LCR  would  not  be  able  to  recover  the \ninvestment.  However,  as  a  private  initiative,  the  planning  permission  only  mentioned  the \nprivate consortium LCR as promoter. The government could not offer state aid without  the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s approval.  \n\nFinally,  a  complex  refinancing  agreement  was  agreed  in  which  LCR  would  complete  the \nproject  and  sell  it  to  rail  operator  Railtrack,  which  was  formerly  state-owned  but  is  now \nprivatized.  LCR  obtained guarantees form  the  UK government  on financing  the  design  and \nconstruction  work.  Unfortunately,  Railtrack  was  unable  to finance  its  operations  and  had to \nbe  taken  into  administration  by  the  government.  In  1998  LCR  awarded  a  management \ncontract  to  Intercapital  and  Regional  Rail,  owned  by  the  National  Express  Group,  SNCF, \nSNCB and British Airways. \n\n                                                \n16 The  main  source  of  information  is  the  European  Commission\u2019s  Resource  Book  on  PPP  case  studies  from \n\n2004. For the Bulgarian Trakia concession, recent reports have been used. \n\n17 Trains \u00e0 Grande Vitesse\u2014French for Fast Speed Train \n18 French and Belgian national public railway companies \n\n \n\n40 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nWhile the CTRL was completed with a delay of seven years and at a cost of \u00a35 billion, it is \nimportant to note the positive points: private engineering and building companies were able \nto deliver results on time and in budget. It was the rather weak estimates on passenger use \nand  lack  of  financing  for  the  development  of  links  with  the  remaining  rail  network  that \naffected the project. In fact the government did not link the CTRL properly to the national rail \ngrid, nor did it develop other high speed train routes within the UK. The TGV which in France \nand Belgium was able to run at 300 km/h had to reduce speed to 140 km/h in the UK. After \nthe eventual completion of the CTRL trains were finally able to run at 270 km/h in the UK. \n\nInterestingly  enough,  difficulties  in  the  airline  sector  due  to  prolonged  security  controls \ncombined  with  shortening  train  travel  times  have  increased  the  demand  for  Eurostar \nservices. Nevertheless only ten million passengers a year were expected in 2010, compared \nwith the original forecast of 21 million.19\n \n\n9.2  Beiras Litoral and Alta Shadow Toll Road, Portugal \n\nPortugal is a frontrunner in the use of PPPs for infrastructure. One of the country\u2019s projects \nwas  a  167km  motorway  which  links  with  the  Spanish  road  infrastructure.  The  government \nlaunched bids for a PPP DBFO, where the recovery of costs is handled with shadow tariffs \nbased on vehicle distance usage. No EU funds were used, but the project was supported by \nan EIB loan.  \n\nProblems  started  at  an  early  stage.  The  government  did  not  specify  clearly  standards  of \nquality  and  service  in  the  tendering  process.  This  meant  alterations  to  the  specification  at \nlater stages affected the bidding process. This caused delays and led to a repetition of the \ntendering  process.  Final  costs  turned  out  to  be  three  times  the  original  estimates  and \nshadow tolls had to be raised as a consequence. \n\nCosts estimates from bidders were not assessed well because there were no public sector \ncomparators.  It  was  thus  not  possible  to  assess  if  the  PPP  was  offering  a  better  outcome \nthan traditional public procurement.  \n\nThe  mishandling  of  precise  specifications  and  requirements  meant  that  the  government \nsubsequently  had  to  cover  the  delays  and  costs  of  implementing  environmental  Impact \nassessments  as  a  result  of  which  projects  were  adapted.  The  private  operators  cannot  be \nblamed for these administrative errors.  \n\nThe  increases  in  shadow  tolls  due  to  the  larger-than-expected  costs  meant  that  the  state \nbudget  from  the  highway  agency  was  unable  to  cover  the  shadow  toll  payments.  This  has \nprompted the government to introduce actual tolls. Luckily usage of the highways is high and  \ntoll cost requirements are therefore sustainable. \n\nIn the meantime Portugal has created a specialized unit for PPPs to avoid similar problems \nwith future PPPs. \n\n9.3  M5 toll motorway, Hungary \n\nThe M5 toll motorway is an important part of the Trans European Network. Interestingly, the \nPPP  uses  no  EU  grants.  The  sources  of  funds  have  been  equity  from  the  concessionaire \nAKA as well as loans from the EBRD and commercial banks. The concession transferred all \nrisks to AKA but emergency provisions were agreed.  \n\nConstruction  was  a  success,  completed  in  1997  on  schedule  and  even  ahead  of  schedule \nfor some sections. However, traffic volumes were below expectations as road-users diverted \n\n                                                \n19 In  November  2010  the  British  Government  sold  a  30-year  concession  to  run  the  rail  tunnel  to  a  Canadian \npension fund for \u00a3 2.1 billion. Industry sources estimated that usage of the tunnel was still one-third below its \ncapacity. \n\n \n\n41 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nto national roads to avoid tolls. AKA thus had to request support from the revenue shortfall \nmechanism provided in the agreement to operate the motorway. This allows for AKA to draw \nsupport from the state for several years, repayable after debts to senior lenders have been \nrepaid and if revenues allow.  \n\nIn 2004 the toll system was changed to a vignette system, where users buy a permit to use \nmotorways for a specified period of time, e.g. a week, month or year. The motorway is thus \nnow financed through availability payments, independent of traffic flows, thus eliminating the \nuser risks of the operator. \n\n9.4  Perpignan\u2014Figueiras Rail Concession, cross-border link \n\nbetween France and Spain \n\nWhile  not  yet  completed, this  cross-border rail  link  is  a good  example  of  a  successful  PPP \nwith  very  complex  institutional  challenges.  This  link  is  part  of  the  Trans  European  Network \nand it is considered a priority to link the Spanish to the French and European rail networks.  \n\nA BOT concession was developed and a European Company was set up. The design of the \nproject is in the hands of the two countries and the private sector will build and operate the \nlink for 50 years. A substantial subsidy consisting of an EU grant and state subsidies will be \nprovided which cover 57% of the construction costs. The remaining funds have to be offered \nby private partners, in the form of own equity and commercial loans.  \n\nInteresting  in  the  agreement  is  that  the  private  party  will  be  levying  fixed  tolls  to  train \noperators,  tolls  which  are  publicly  approved.  Maintenance  standards  and  availability \nperformance are set very high, with penalties for non-performance, including termination of \nthe contract.  \n\nThis  PPP  is  presented  as  a  flagship  example  of  how  to  set  them  up  in  a  highly  complex \ninfrastructure  challenge  in  a  cross-border  area.  The  procedure  was  robust  and  took  into \naccount the specific needs to draw in technically apt bidders. Standards have been set high, \nthe state subsidy allows for the private sector to take on risks which would not be possible \nwithout such support. Thus the state does not transfer the whole costs, but it does transfer \ndemand and availability risks.  \n\n9.5  Trakia Motorway Project, Bulgaria \n\nThe Trakia motorway negotiations for a concession for a motorway stretch of 190 kilometers \nrecently collapsed. Negotiations have been difficult and have gone on for several years. The \nstart of construction is more than two years behind schedule. \n\nThe Trakia motorway is an important link between the capital and one of the major town and \nports of the country, Burgas. Other parts of the motorway have already been completed. The \nreason  for  the  recent  collapse  of  the  negotiations  is  to  be  found  partially  in  the  external \nmarket  environment.  While  the  Bulgarian  government  had  awarded  a  concession  to  a \nBulgarian-Portuguese consortium, this consortium has failed to obtain private finance. Given \nthe  credit  crunch  and  rising  interest  rates,  the  banks\u2019  perspective  of  the  project\u2019s  forecasts \nand  profitability  have  been  affected.  A  deep  crisis  in  the  present  government  and  the \nfreezing of substantial amounts of EU support to the country under allegations of fraud also \nmakes it difficult for the PPP to be easily renegotiated.  \n\nThe  Trakia  motorway  concession  process  was  complex  and  arduous  and  suffered  from \nconsiderable  problems  and  delays  due  to  administrative  mismanagement  of  the  tendering \nprocedure  which  was  investigated  by  the  EU.  Initial  government  guarantees  violated  EU \nstate  aid  rules.  Once  these  barriers  were  removed,  however,  the  reduced  availability  of \nprivate  credit,  reflecting  the  fall-out  from  the  \u201csub-prime\u201d  financial  crisis  has  effected  the \nagreement. \n\n \n\n42 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nPolitical  instability,  the  already  complex  uncertainties  of  the  project  and  the  credit  crunch \nhave led to guarantees and the risk premiums for commercial banks being raised. The banks \nare  pulling  out  as  the  state  is  not  in  a  position  to  renegotiate  the  agreement.  The  new \nguarantees  and  demands  also  put  into  question  the  viability  and  the  value  for  money \narguments for the use of a PPP rather than normal procurement.  \n\n10.  CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED \n\nThis discussion paper has analyzed the conditions for optimal risk allocation within PPPs in \na  context  of  certainty  as  well  as  of  uncertainty.  Three  important  conclusions  can  be \nobserved.  \n\nFirst,  the  risk-spreading  aspect  of  public  investment,  leading  to  less  risk-averseness  than \nprivate investment, means that the optimal transfer of risk from public to private operators is \nfundamentally limited.  \n\nSecond, the larger size of the EU budget and its specific methods of funding through a share \nof  VAT  indirect taxes  will  indeed  mean  that the perception  of  risks  borne  by  individual  tax-\npayers tends to be negligible, although these are definitely not zero. Irrespective, neither the \nEU nor the EIB, assume high risks in their investment or co-financing of public infrastructure \nin  the  EU. Whereas  the  budget  of  the  European  Communities  contributes  grant  funding  to \ntrans-national infrastructure, the lending policy of the EIB tends to be quite conservative and \nassume  low,  if  not  zero,  risks.  In  all  cases,  final  contingent  liabilities  remain  with  national \ngovernments rather than supra-national institutions.  \n\nThird, the main contribution of the EU to trans-national infrastructure appears to be ensuring \nthat  the  marginal  benefits  of  private  sector  involvement\u2014in  effect  efficiency  gains\u2014remain \nquite  high.  Grant  funding  for  feasibility  studies  and  preparation,  combined  with  supra-\nnational  coordination  and  regulation  have  meant  that  the  quality  of  project  and  investment \npreparation has remained high.  \n\nThe EU continues to pursue ambitious plans to develop the Trans European Networks. The \ncosts  are  estimated  over  two  decades  to  exceed  \u20ac500  billion.  For  this  reason,  the  EU \ninstitutions  and  member  states  have  increasingly  explored  the  use  of  PPPs  to  achieve  the \nneeded infrastructure development.  \n\nPPPs  have  demonstrated  themselves  to  be  generally  less  costly  than  normal  procurement \ndue  to  the  increased  efficiency  of  the  private  sector.  In  the  EU,  however,  PPPs  are  still \nlimited  in  number,  due  to  their  complexity  and  in  many  cases  a  lack  of  administrative \nexperience  in  this  field.  Setting  up  PPPs  for  large  infrastructure  projects  is  complex  and \nmistakes  in  the  development  process  can  create  higher  costs  in  the  future  than  normal \nprocurement.  The  use  of  PPPs  has  thus  been  highly  variable  across  countries  and  even \nregions within countries.  \n\nFor large infrastructure projects planned for crossborder operations, PPPs pose a particular \nchallenge.  Transfer  of  risks  to  the  private  sector  is  hampered  by  the  large  scale  and  long-\nterm  horizons  involved.  Governments  thus  have  to  offer  important  guarantees,  such  as \ndemand  guarantees,  or  grants.  The  failure  of  a  private  operator  of  a  large  public \ninfrastructure  asset  forces  the  state  to  take  over  its  operations.  Failed  PPPs  will  ultimately \nalways be taken over by the public sector. \n\nAnother area of concern for the public sector is the possible failure of PPPs due to changes \nin the financial sector, such as changes in the risk premiums due to financial crises. \n\nPPPs  can  potentially  allow  countries  to  develop  infrastructure  faster  and  at  lower  cost,  but \nPPPs  are  not  a  panacea,  bringing  with  them  also  higher  risks  of  failure  if  project  details, \nservice  level  requirements  and  risk  allocation  are  not  extremely  well  planned,  defined  and \n\n \n\n43 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nagreed. Governments need thus to create specialized units to handle the process and often \nhire specialized consultants. \n\nIn Europe, the European Investment Bank has played a pivotal role in organizing PPPs for \nEuropean  projects.  By  handling  difficult  procurement  systems,  such  as  competitive  tender \nprocedures  and  helping  to  develop  administrative  capacity,  the  EIB  has  become  a  point  of \nreference  for  large  and  complex  projects.  The  involvement  of  the  EIB  in  infrastructure \nprojects presents clear guarantees to private financial institutions of the viability and quality \nof projects, leading to reduced risk premiums. The EIB also offers credit guarantees. In this \nparticular sense, the EIB does provide a useful role model for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \noperations across Asia. \n\n \n\n44 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 281                                                           Van der Geest and N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ferrer \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nArrow, K.J., and R.C.

This  paper  argues  that  in  the  EU  (i)  private  sector  partners \nremain risk-averse; and (ii) risk-pooling across a larger number of tax-payers tends to reduce \nthe  cost  of  risk  to  zero,  making  EU  funds  highly  desirable  and  sought  after  for  public \ninfrastructure development. This paper argues that private equity has not been forthcoming \nto the extent that had been expected by those propagating this method of finance. In those \ninstances where private non-publicly guaranteed resources have been used, the distribution \nof risks between public and private partners remained asymmetric, with public governmental \nbodies carrying the financial risks, which ultimately may become a contingent liability for the \ncountry\u2019s public finances. However, EU and European Investment Bank (EIB) public funding \nis used not simply because the risks are spread more widely, but rather because EU rules \nand  regulations  for  using  such  funds  lead  to  better  preparation  of  projects  and  greater \nefficiency gains in project implementation and delivery. \n", " \nJEL Classification: G32, H44, O19 \n", " \n"]}
