Macroeconometric\nmodels of national economies are widely used for both policy analysis and forecasting.\nCountries have developed macroeconometric models to design long-term development plans\nand to assess the effects of economic policies.  A macroeconometric model is particularly useful\nin the early stage of economic development. The model facilitates conducting in-depth policy\nanalysis as well as to forecast the future course of the economy. Systematic analyses on the\nimpacts of Government\u2019s policies are an integral part of economic planning in developing countries.\nThere are several existing macroeconometric models of the Nepalese economy. The existing\nmodels such as Sharma (1989) and Alamgir and Ra (2001) treat gross domestic product (GDP)\nas an exogenous variable.  These models usually stipulate different growth paths and then examine\nthe necessary policy changes to achieve the pre-specified target growth rates. Nepal\u2019s Tenth Plan,\nthe 5-year development plan, covering fiscal year (FY) 2003\u2013FY2007 is established by this approach\nas it specifies normal and low growth paths in advance and then compares corresponding policy\nscenarios.\nAs the Nepalese economy is becoming increasingly market-driven, most of the equations\nused in the model are demand oriented. The Nepal Macroeconometric Model (NMM) takes the\nKeynesian income-expenditure approach where GDP is determined endogenously.  Among a\nnumber of exogenous variables, five variables are defined as policy variables: taxes, regular\nexpenditures, development expenditures, foreign borrowing, and the exchange rate. Considering\nthat economic growth is influenced by policy changes, the newly developed NMM is better suited\nfor alternative policy analysis. The NMM provides answers to the effects of conducting in-depth\nscenario analysis for alternative policy options.\nBeyond the general purpose of macroeconometric modeling, the NMM has two specific\nand practical objectives. First, the NMM can be used to conduct debt sustainability analysis. Public\nborrowing, both internal and external, is crucial to maintain sustainable growth in Nepal. Therefore,\nmanaging public debt within a sustainable level has become one of the most important policy\ntasks. Second, the NMM provides policymakers or local experts an opportunity to increase their\nmodeling knowledge and thus better understand the structure of the Nepalese economy. Efforts\nhave been taken to make sure that the model is easily accessible without need for professional or\ntechnical support. Armed with a user-friendly version of the model, policymakers, who may not be\nfamiliar with statistical analysis, can conduct policy scenario analysis through menu-driven options.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a brief overview of the\nexisting models, and Section III explains the data source and the variable definitions used in the\nNMM.  Section IV discusses the main characteristics and the structure of the model, in particular,\nthe specifications of the behavioral equations. Section V develops the baseline policy scenarios\nand two alternative scenarios consistent with the Tenth Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007), the current guide\nfor economic policy in Nepal. Section VI compares the forecasting results of the NMM under three\npolicy scenarios with those of the Tenth Plan. The final section concludes.", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nII. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS MODELS\nA brief summary of the history of economic modeling exercises in Nepal including Sharma\n(1989) and Alamgir and Ra (2001) is presented below. In the early 1980\u2019s, individual researchers\nfirst attempted to use statistical models for economic analysis in Nepal. In 1987, the Water and\nEnergy Commission developed a macro model for forecasting energy demand. A multi-sector,\neconomy-wide model was first introduced in 1985 by Khanal, Thapa and Elbers (1987).\nA macro model was developed as part of the link model for the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation countries to examine the implications of regional trade on its member\neconomies.1 A combined macro and input-output model was also introduced in the preparation of\nlong-term industrial plans in 1989. The input/output model of 39 sectors was jointly developed and\ncombined with the macro model to derive policy implications of alternative development strategies\nat the detailed industry level as well as at the national economy level.2 The main objective of the\nmodel was to determine the optimum volume of investment under an acceptable rate of inflation,\nacceptable ratio of deficit, realistic level of foreign assistance, and a stipulated per capita\nconsumption growth rate. A similar version of the macroeconomic model was also used in the\nformulation of the Eighth Plan.\nA slightly different, yet closely related model in the framework of flow-of-funds accounting\nwas developed for the National Planning Commission Secretariat Project. The flow-of-funds\naccounting\u2014such as Revised Minimum Standard Model -extended (RMSM-X) commonly used in\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, was integrated into a consistent accounting\nframework: the budget and other pubic sector account, the balance of payments (BOP) or the rest\nof the world account, the monetary sector account, the private sector account, and the relevant\nvariables from the national accounts. Such an integrated set of accounts is believed to help conduct\npolicy analysis, analyzing overall macroeconomic management performance, evaluating country\ncreditworthiness, and providing macroeconomic frameworks for public sector investment programs\nand structural adjustment programs. In 1990, a simple macroeconomic accounting framework\nwas employed to examine the possibility of policy coordination between exchange rate policy and\nfiscal policy for more effective management of the economy.3\nWhile the Tenth Plan was being formulated, the integrated macro and input-output model\nwas used to set the growth rates as well as to determine the investment levels at both the sectoral\nand aggregate level without disrupting macroeconomic stability. Special attention should be drawn\nto two macroeconomic models: Alamgir and Ra (2001) and Sharma (1989).  A common feature of\nthe two models is that GDP is predetermined or stipulated before estimating individual equations.\nThese models implicitly assume that the supply side determines aggregate output, and they predict\neach endogenous variable in a way that is consistent with the given output level. This may be\ninterpreted as a supply-side production approach, although the aggregate production function is\n1 Khanal, D. R.  and G. N. Sharma. 1992. A Macroeconometric Model of Nepal in SAARC Link.

Since GDP is driven by exogenous variables only, the previous models are not a\nsystem of simultaneous equations per se. The procedure for the macroeconomic projections in\nthe Alamgir and Ra (2001) model starts with the projection of GDP growth by major economic\nsectors based on the growth elasticity derived from historical data adjusted for structural changes.\nIII. DATA \nIn contrast to the previous macroeconomic models, GDP is determined on the demand\nside in the NMM. Before explaining the structure of the model, brief explanations of the variable\ndefinitions and the data source of the NMM is presented below.\nA. Definition of the variables and the Sample Period\nThe NMM is a medium-sized annual macroeconometric model.4 There are 59 variables\nand 37 equations and the number of endogenous variables is equal to the number of equations. Of\nthese equations, 20 are behavioral equations and 17 are identities. Among the exogenous variables,\nfive variables are policy variables: taxes, regular expenditures, development expenditures, foreign\nborrowing, and the exchange rate. Given the peg of the Nepalese rupee to the Indian Rupee,\nmonetary variables are not considered as policy variables.\nThe currency unit of all variables in the model is the Nepalese rupee, including the variables\nin the BOP account. The variables denominated in US dollars are converted to Nepalese rupees\nby multiplying the period average or the end of the period exchange rate. The currency denomination\nis not a major issue in estimation and simulation. Nevertheless, denomination by domestic currency\nis preferred since it is more efficient when the values of the variables from different sources are\ncompared. For instance, the exports of goods and non-factor services in the national income\naccount can be easily compared with the merchandise exports in the BOP account once all the\nvariables are denominated in domestic currency.\nAs for the sample period, data were available for the sample period from FY1975 to FY2004.\nThere are concerns regarding the reliability of national income account data before FY1984 due to\npotential data inconsistency. However, the advantage of a relatively large number of observations\nin a time series for obtaining more robust and reliable estimates outweighed the risk. Nevertheless,\nto minimize potential data inconsistency, the model is solved from FY1985 to FY2004 in historical\nsimulation.\nB. Data Adjustments and Transformations\nThe sources of the data are the Government of Nepal, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and\nNepal Rastra Bank (NRB).  The data for final demand, prices, and money were obtained from the\nEconomic Survey of MOF and Quarterly Economic Bulletin, Current Economic Scenario, and\n4 The model is based on annual data from 1974/75 to 2001/2002.  Sufficient data are not available to build a\nquarterly model.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 3", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nBudget Speech of NRB.5  Some of the presentation of the data, however, differ from the international\nstandard and are not appropriate for policy analysis, especially for debt sustainability analysis. A\nmodified data set has been used in the country analysis after adjusting the government data in line\nwith the International Monetary Fund format. The reported government finance statistics and the\nBOP statistics are extensively adjusted as the raw data are recorded on cash payment basis.6\nThe adjusted data is expected to make the forecast results more consistent with international\nstandards.\nAs will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs, the difference between the two data\nsystems makes it difficult to directly compare the forecasting results of the Tenth Plan with our\nsimulation results. The Tenth Plan is based on the reported government statistics. Appropriate\nadjustment of the variables is required to compare the forecasts of the Tenth Plan with those of the\nNMM.\nThe fiscal year of the Government of Nepal ends on 15 July. In our report, a convention is\nused such that figures after \u2018FY\u2019 denote the year that the fiscal year ends. Under this system,\nFY2002 includes the time period from 16, July 2001 to 15, July 2002. The unique dating convention\nmakes it necessary to adjust foreign variables in the model to maintain data coherence. The\ncurrent and the previous calendar year consumer price indexes (CPIs) were averaged to construct\nthe Indian CPI for each fiscal year: the Indian CPI for FY1975 is the average of the CPIs of 1974\nand 1975.\nOnly the nominal values of the components of GDP are available for each fiscal year since\nthe Government of Nepal does not publish the components of real GDP. Thus, real variables were\ncalculated in two-steps. The first step was to obtain the GDP deflator, which is the ratio of nominal\nGDP to real GDP (GDP at constant price). In the second step, each component of nominal GDP\nwas divided by the same GDP deflator to get the corresponding component of real GDP. The\ndifference between the sum of real components and real GDP forms the real statistical discrepancy.\nThe monthly interest rates were averaged to construct the annual interest rate for each\nfiscal year and the lending rate of commercial loans was used as the representative market interest\nrate. However, as only the range of the lending rate was available, the median value of the range\nand their monthly averages were used as a proxy for the annual interest rate.\nIV. THE STRUCTURE OF THE MODEL\nA. Main Characteristics\nThe NMM is not a substitute but a complement to the previous models. Nevertheless, the\n5 Data not published in the documents were provided by local consultants.\n6 Ministry of Finance. 2003. Economic Survey: Fiscal Year 2002/2003.

Since the Financial Comptroller General\u2019s Office\nrecords actual disbursements and authorizes payments on loans, that office is the original source of foreign\ngrants and foreign loans.\n4 June 2005", "Section IV\nThe Structure of the Model\ncharacteristic is that the NMM is a Keynesian income-expenditure model in which the demand\nside determines GDP. The supply side is not explicitly specified as the aggregate production function\nis not estimated.7 Its basic features are drawn from the Korea Development Institute (KDI) macro\nmodel that had been used to design successive 5-year economic development plans in Korea.8\nDue to the lack of quarterly data the NMM is an annual model while the KDI used a quarterly\nmacroeconometric model. The NMM is also a mid-sized model with 37 equations.9 A medium-\nsized model has an advantage in policy analysis as it incorporates more detail of the structure of\nthe economy.\nSecond, the NMM distinguishes policy variables from simple exogenous variables. For any\nstructural model to work, some exogenous variables need to be specified externally. Among\nexogenous variables, there are some over which governments have a significant degree of control.\nThese policy variables are different from simple exogenous variables that are determined by\nnoneconomic forces or foreign sectors; grants and foreign borrowing are two important exogenous\nvariables in the government account in the NMM. The NMM treats grants as a simple exogenous\nvariable because the government is unlikely to determine its amount. On the other hand, foreign\nborrowing is treated as a policy variable. The Government of Nepal has influence on how much is\nto be borrowed, either domestically or abroad, to finance government expenditures. There are five\npolicy variables in the current version of the NMM: taxes, regular expenditures, development\nexpenditures, foreign borrowing, and the exchange rate. Selecting appropriate policy variables is\nan important step in conducting policy simulation analysis.\nThird, the role of the price block in the NMM is not conventional. Prices usually connect the\nreal and monetary sector in a macroeconometric model. A shock to the monetary sector affects\nthe real sector through a price block. A shock arising from the real sector also changes the price\nvariable indirectly via monetary variables. In the NMM, however, this monetary propagation\nmechanism does not hold; the Nepalese CPI is almost completely explained by the Indian CPI. No\nother domestic variables, nominal or real, have explanatory power once the Indian CPI is included\nin the Nepalese price equation. Moreover, the estimated coefficient on the Indian CPI is close to\none, implying that the Nepalese price is unit elastic with respect to the Indian CPI. This is a very\ninteresting finding in that price stability in Nepal crucially depends on the Indian economy. The\ndominant influence of the Indian price on the Nepalese price is due to the pegging of the Nepalese\nrupee to the Indian rupee. Consequently, the price variables are modeled not to reflect changes in\ndomestic aggregate demand or supply in the NMM.\nFourth, as is the case for prices, the NMM attempts to incorporate Nepal\u2019s strong economic\nties with India in international transactions. India has been Nepal\u2019s most important trading partner,\nalthough economic relationships with other countries are also becoming important. The proportion\nof Nepal\u2019s exports going to India was 84% in 1975; the corresponding figure declined to 61% in\n2002. Similarly, the proportion of imports from India decreased from 81% in 1975\n7 The supply side is not modeled in the current version due to the lack of sufficient data on employment and\ncapital stocks.\n8 Baek, E. 1994. The Use of Economic Data and Models In Economic Planning. KDI. Discusses the history of the\ndevelopment and the main characteristics of the KDI model.\n9 A medium-size model usually consists of more than 30 equations.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 5", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\n to 42% by 2002.10 Bilateral trade volume was used as an independent explanatory variable in the\nexport and import equations to reflect the close ties with India.\nAnother interesting characteristic in the BOP account is the role of the foreign exchange\nrate, which is defined as Nepalese rupee per US dollar. The foreign exchange rate is usually one of\nthe most important variables in international trade. However, the impact of the exchange rate on\ntrade in Nepal is quite limited since the Nepalese rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee and India is\nthe major trading partner of Nepal. The exchange rate variables were incorporated in the trade\nequations since the changes in the exchange rate with respect to the US dollar can affect trade\nwith the rest of world by changing the relative prices with other countries.\nB. The Specifications and Estimation Results\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the NMM consists of 5 building blocks: final demand, prices,\ncredit and money, government, and the BOP. Given the estimated behavioral equations and\naccounting identities, an external or policy shock initially disturbs a specific relation and then affects\nthe economy through the propagation mechanism across the five building blocks.  All the variables\ngo through a dynamic adjustment process until the economy finds a new equilibrium. The estimation\nresults and a brief description of the behavioral equations in each block is presented below.\n1. Final Demand Block\nFinal demand or real GDP is defined as the sum of private consumption, government\nconsumption, private fixed investment, government fixed investment, increase in stock or inventory,\nexports of goods and services less imports of goods and services, and statistical discrepancies.\nNominal GDP is the product of the real GDP and GDP deflator.\nPrivate Consumption\nPrivate consumption is specified as a function of the distributed lags of disposable income.11\nA polynomial distributed lag (PDL) specification is employed to avoid a potential multi-collinearity\nproblem induced by the lagged income terms. Private consumption fits a first degree polynomial to\nthe coefficients of six lags of order, constraining the far end to be zero.The restriction means that\npast income does not affect current consumption after 6 years. Without the restriction, the number\nof PDL parameters estimated should be two. With the far end restriction in place, it is reduced by\none to account for the restriction. The original seven parameters of current and past incomes can\nbe easily recovered from the PDL estimate even though they are reported here. This specification\nturns out to be the best one among the different combinations of degrees of polynomials, lag\norders, and constraints. A PDL specification leads the estimated private consumption to be\nsufficiently smooth, consistent with actual private consumption. Real interest rate is not included\nas an explanatory variable in the consumption function since the estimated coefficient is not\n10 The export ratio declined to 9.4% in 1993, and the import ratio fell to 26.5% in 1997. They have been increasing\nsince 1994 and 1998, respectively.\n11 The figures in parenthesis are t-statistics.

It is thereby implied that the real interest rate plays no role in the inter-temporal\nconsumption decisions. The commercial loan rate, one of the market interest rates, was fixed at\n12.5% from 1975 to 1986 and has been adjusted infrequently since 1986. The real balance, money\nsupply 2 (M2) divided by CPI is also not significant in explaining private consumption behavior.\nLog(CP)= 0.34 + 0.14*PDL(Log(GDP-TAX/PGDP*100),6),  sum of lags = 0.97                                    (Equation 1)\n(1.2)                                (39.1)                                                           (39.1)\nThe sum of the estimated coefficients on the distributed lags is 0.97, indicating that the\nlong-run elasticity of private consumption with respect to disposable income is close to one. The\nestimation result suggests that, in the long-run, private consumption varies one for one along with\ndisposable income.\nGovernment Consumption\nGovernment consumption in the final demand block is a part of two types of government\nexpenditures, regular and development,  which are exogenous variables in the NMM. Government\nconsumption is modeled as an endogenous variable and as a function of regular expenditures\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 7", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nand development expenditures in the government block, divided by the GDP deflator. The\nspecification is based on a simple relationship between the government account and national\nincome account. Since regular and development expenditures are policy variables, government\nconsumption is also a policy variable in the NMM.\nThe estimation result shows that government consumption is more sensitive to regular\nexpenditures than development expenditures. A 1% increase in regular expenditures and\ndevelopment expenditures leads to 0.62% and 0.17% increases in government consumption,\nrespectively. It is not surprising that regular expenditures are more closely related to government\nconsumption. Development expenditures are more likely related to government investment than\ngovernment consumption. Other variables such as the real interest rate do not help explain\ngovernment consumption.\nLog(CG) = 5.86 + 0.62*Log(REGEXP/PGDP) + 0.17*Log(DEVEXP/PGDP)                                         (Equation 2)\n                           (31.7)                    (16.2)                                      (2.7)\nPrivate Fixed Investment\nTotal investment consists of private fixed investment, government fixed investment, and\nincreases in stock or inventory. Increases in stock may well be an important component in the\nbusiness cycle. However, it is not correlated with excess demand pressure in Nepal.12 Rather, the\nincrease in stock is heavily influenced by the fluctuations in agricultural production that, in turn, are\ngreatly affected by exogenous factors such as climate. Hence, the increase in stock is assumed\nto be exogenous.\nPrivate fixed investment is usually one of the most difficult parts to estimate since it is\nextremely sensitive to business cycles and depends on investors\u2019 future expectations. In the private\nfixed investment equation, the real interest rate and development expenditures are used as\nindependent variables.  Other variables such as output and credit availability do not have sufficient\nexplanatory power. As in the private consumption equation, a PDL specification for development\nexpenditure is used in order to reflect a lag structure between expenditures and investment. Private\nfixed investment fits a first-degree polynomial to the coefficients of six lags of order, constraining\nthe far end to be zero. The estimated long-run elasticity of private fixed investment is around 1.60,\nimplying that private fixed investment is highly sensitive to the government\u2019s development\nexpenditures. One possible explanation for this is that private investors are likely to extract\ninformation about future business conditions from the government development expenditures or\nthe government investment may have multiplier effects on the private sector.

The estimated elasticity of private fixed investment with respect to the real\ninterest rate is 0.59, suggesting that a higher interest rate discourages private investment. The\npresence of the real interest rate in the private investment equation represents a channel through\nwhich monetary shocks are transmitted to the real sector.\nGovernment Fixed Investment\nAs in the case of government consumption, government fixed investment is correlated\nwith regular expenditures and development expenditures. Foreign borrowing is also considered\nsince a substantial amount of government investment is likely to be financed by borrowing from\nabroad. In addition, the real interest rate is expected to affect government investment through a\ntransmission channel from the monetary sector to the real sector. In contrast to government\nconsumption, government fixed investment is more strongly influenced by development expenditures\nthan regular expenditures. The estimated coefficient on development expenditures is almost twice\nas large as the estimated coefficient on regular expenditures. The negative coefficient estimate on\nthe real interest rate implies that a rise in the real interest rate reduces government fixed investment.\nHowever, government investment is less sensitive to the real interest rate than private investment.\nAlthough foreign borrowing is an important source of financing for government investment, the\nestimated coefficient is not statistically significant. However, if development expenditure is excluded,\nforeign borrowing becomes a significant factor. This is understandable given that development\nexpenditures are mostly financed through foreign borrowing. To emphasize the importance of\nforeign financing in domestic investment, foreign borrowing is included in the government investment\nequation together with development expenditure.\nLog(FCG) = -1.13 + 0.85 * Log(DEVEXP/PGDP*100) + 0.32 * Log(REGEXP/PGDP*100)                   (Equation 4)\n                               (-1.3)                         (5.2)                                                    (4.6)\n- 0.32*Log(INT -PCHY(CPI)) + 0.02*Log(FBORR/PGDP)\n                   (-2.6)                                        (0.3)\nExports and Imports of Goods and Non-factor Services\nTwo bridge equations are estimated to link exports and imports in the BOP account to the\nexports and imports in the national income account. Exports and imports in the national income\naccount were regressed on the merchandise exports and imports in the balance of payments\naccount. Notably, exports and imports in the national income account include non-factor services\nas well as goods exports and imports while those of the balance of payments account include only\nmerchandise exports and imports.14 A dummy variable, DUM9498, is constructed to improve the\nfitness of the export estimation.\n14 Non-factor services include shipping, passenger, and other transport services, and travel, as well as current\naccount transactions not separately reported (e.g., not classified as merchandise, non-factor services, or transfers).\nThese include transactions with nonresidents by government agencies and their personnel abroad, and also\ntransactions by private residents with foreign governments and government personnel stationed in the reporting\ncountry.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 9", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nThe estimation results of the two bridge equations confirm the close ties between the\nnational income account and BOP account.

Price Block\nConsumer Price Index\nThe price block consists of the CPI and the GDP deflator.  An interesting finding is that\nmost of the fluctuations in the CPI in Nepal can b e explained by the fluctuations in the CPI in India.\nThe serial correlation adjusted coefficient on the Indian CPI is 1.03, suggesting that there is nearly\na one-for-one relation between the two countries\u2019 CPIs. Other than the Indian CPI, no variable is\nfound to be significant, although M2 is included in the price equation in the NMM to link the monetary\nsector to the real sector. An attempt was made to estimate the effect of the excess demand\npressure on the price, but the coefficient was found to be insignificant.\nLog(CPI) = -0.41 + 1.03*Log(INDP) + 0.02*Log(M2) + [AR(1) = 0.82]                                                    (Equation 7)\n   (-1.2)              (5.6)                    (0.2)                      (5.9)\nGDP Deflator\nA bridge equation is estimated for the GDP deflator. Since the GDP deflator in Nepal is\nconstructed using the same data used in constructing the CPI, the GDP deflator and CPI exhibit\nalmost identical fluctuations. The elasticity of the GDP deflator with respect to CPI is 0.92. The\nexchange rate displayed marginal explanatory power for the GDP deflator and was not included in\nthe equation.\nLog(PGDP) = 0.43 + 0.92*Log(CPI) + [AR(1) = 0.43]                                                                                 (Equation 8)\n                                 (11.2)          (99.3)                     (2.5)\n3. Money and Credit Block\nM2 is the sum of net foreign assets and domestic credit. Domestic credit consists of\nprivate domestic credit, government domestic credit, and claims on government enterprises.\nThree behavioral equations were specified for net foreign asset, private domestic credit,\n10 June 2005", "Section IV\nThe Structure of the Model\nand government domestic credit.15 Since the Nepalese rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee and\nthe domestic currency is fully convertible for all current account transactions, the money supply is\nendogenously determined in the model.  In principle, interest rates should also be included as an\nendogenous variable.  However, it is difficult to find a variable that has significant explanatory\npower in the interest rate equation. Moreover, the interest rate has generally been fixed with infrequent\nadjustments in Nepal. Therefore, without theoretical justification, treating the interest rate as an\nexogenous variable cannot be avoided in the NMM. It has been more difficult to get good estimation\nresults for variables in the money and credit block compared with variables in other blocks. Also,\nmany variables in the money and credit block are stock variables. Therefore, where necessary,\nstock variables were transformed into flow variables (by taking their differences) before estimation.\nNet Foreign Assets\nNet foreign assets is one of the crucial variables in the NMM\u2019s propagation mechanism, but\nit is very difficult to find a good specification for net foreign assets. Net foreign assets affect the\naggregate money supply, and M2 then influences the price level and real economic variables.  A\nsurplus in the overall balance in the BOP block leads to an increase in net foreign assets and vice\nversa.  Following this linkage between accounts, changes in net foreign assets of the central bank\nare directly linked to the overall balance in the NMM.\nD  (NFA) = -1548.60 + 0.96*OB                                                                                                                        (Equation 9)\n                          (-2.2)          (6.3)\nChanges in net foreign assets are very closely correlated with the overall balance in BOP account;\nthe coefficient estimate is around 0.96.\nPrivate Domestic Credit\nDomestic credit includes private domestic credit, government domestic credit, and claims\non government enterprises. Private domestic credit further subdivides into household loans,\ncorporate loans, and security holdings. Theoretically, these components are all very sensitive to\nthe market interest rate and economic conditions. In addition, corporate loans are likely to be\naffected by future economic prospects as well as current economic conditions. Nominal GDP\nwas used to represent current economic conditions. Given the serial correlation of nominal GDP,\nit was assumed that future business prospects are also incorporated in nominal GDP.  As expected,\nchanges in private domestic credit are positively correlated with nominal GDP. In contrast, the\ninterest rate was excluded since the coefficient estimate on the market interest rate is not significant.\nD  (DCP) = -993.71 + 0.04*GDPN                                                                                                               (Equation 10)\n   (-1.4)          (13.2)\n15 Claims on the Government are treated as exogenous.

Lagged variables of government domestic credit and the budget\nsurplus were also included.

Government Block\nThere is only one behavioral equation in the government block: non-tax revenue. All other\nendogenous variables in the block are defined by simple accounting identities. The current revenue\nof the government is defined as the sum of tax and non-tax revenue. Government expenditures\ninclude regular expenditures and development expenditures. The overall balance of the government\nis defined by government current revenue and sales of fixed assets, which can also be calculated\nas capital revenue minus government expenditures and lending less repayment. Since the\ngovernment can actively use taxes, regular expenditures, and development expenditures to exercise\ncontrol over the economy, those three variables are considered as policy variables in the model.\nExcluding foreign grants, the government finances the overall budget deficit through foreign\nborrowing or domestic borrowing. The use of the cash balance is included in domestic borrowing\nin our model.\nNon-tax Revenue\nNon-tax revenue includes charges, fees, fines, forfeitures, receipts from sales of\ncommodities, royalties and sales of fixed assets, principal and interest payments, etc. Since these\ncomponents are likely to be influenced by nationwide economic activities, non-tax revenue is\nregressed on nominal GDP and the coefficient is found to be statistically significant.\nLog(NTAX)=  -5.77 + 1.15*Log(GDPN) + [AR(1)=0.29]                                                                        (Equation 12)\n(-15.3)           (35.3)                      (1.6)\n5.  Balance of Payments Block\nMerchandise exports and imports, foreign loans, amortization, and official capital grants\nare specified in this block. Two bridge equations for foreign loans and official capital grants are\nspecified to link them to foreign borrowing and foreign grants in the government block, respectively.\nNet services and net transfers are both exogenous variables in the NMM.16 The current balance,\ncapital balance, and overall balance are defined by accounting identities in the BOP.\n16 Net services of the BOP block include non-factor and factor services.\n12 June 2005", "Section IV\nThe Structure of the Model\nMerchandise Exports\nMotivated by close economic ties with India, exports to India are included in the equation\nalong with the exchange rate. Since the dependence of exports on India is directly taken into\naccount, this may not be a desirable approach. However, exports to a foreign country primarily\ndepends on foreign income.  Since Nepal\u2019s major trading partner is India, exports to India may be\nused as a proxy for the Indian income variable. A dummy variable, DUM97, is included in the\nspecification to improve the fit.17 Other potentially important variables such as world trade volume\nand the relative price of Nepal with respect to other trading partner countries are found to be\ninsignificant.\nIt is expected that a depreciation of the currency increases exports and merchandise exports\nin Nepal are indeed positively correlated with the exchange rate before FY1997. However, exchange\nrate and merchandise exports move in opposite directions since FY1997, which is inconsistent\nwith economic theory. The unusual finding could be explained by a structural change that affects\nexports around FY1997, and that the normal economic relationship between exports and the\nexchange rate is expected to resume soon. The interaction term of exports to India and the dummy\nvariable is included for the time being as the variable for exports to India before 1997 is not found\nto be significant in the export equation.\nLog(XRUP) = 2.30 + 1.91*Log(ERA) \u2013 2.89*(DUM97*Log(ERA))                                                       (Equation 13)\n                                 (14.6)           (37.6)                            (-1.7)\n+ 0.65*(DUM97*Log(XIND)) + 6.13*DUM97\n                   (2.3)                                (1.3)\nMerchandise Imports\nMerchandise imports are specified as a function of real GDP, the exchange rate, and imports\nfrom India along with the dummy variable, DUM97. Replacing real GDP with nominal GDP adversely\naffects the simulation results substantially, suggesting that price changes do not play a role in\nimport demand. The estimated short-run income elasticity of merchandise imports is 0.61. The\nexchange rate is negatively correlated with imports (estimated coefficient of -0.13). Imports from\nIndia also plays an important role to explain merchandise imports.  While the estimated coefficient\non DUM97 is not significant, the interaction terms of the dummy variable with GDP or the exchange\nrate are highly significant.18\nLog(MRUP) = -6.02 + 0.78*Log(MRUP(-1)) + 0.61*Log(GDP) + 0.17*Log(MIND)                           (Equation 14)\n(-2.0)                 (8.5)                            (1.9)                        (2.3)\n- 0.13*Log(ERA) + 0.47*(DUM97*Log(GDP)) - 1.44*(DUM97*Log(ERA))\n          (-0.8)                               (3.5)                                        (-3.6)\n17 DUM97 is 1.00 for the years since 1997.\n18 Import demand responds more strongly to gross domestic product  and the exchange rate since FY1997,\npossibly due to structural changes.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 13", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nForeign Loans and Official Capital Grants\nForeign loans and official capital grants in the BOP account are linked to foreign borrowing\nand foreign grants in the government block by two bridge equations.

As expected, the long-run elasticity of foreign loans of BOP block with respect to\nforeign borrowing in the government block is 1.00 whereas the short-run elasticity is only 0.37.\nOfficial capital grants is not directly regressed on foreign grants. A simple bridge equation may\nadversely affect the simulation results due to the strong persistence of official capital grants.\nChanges in official capital grants was regressed on a 4-year moving average of foreign grants to\nreduce the problem of persistence.

Nominal GDP was\nconsidered as an explanatory variable since amortization usually depends on the borrower\u2019s ability\nto service and pay down the debt. The dummy variable, DUM97, was included to make adjustments\nto the slope of nominal GDP and constant term. The coefficient estimate on the interaction term of\ndummy variable and nominal GDP is negative, suggesting that amortization has become less\ndependent on income since 1997.\nLog(-AMORT) = -17.47 + 2.06*Log(GDPN) - 0.93*(DUM97*Log(GDPN)) + 11.34*DUM97              (Equation 16)\n                                        (-33.1)              (42.8)                             (-2.4)                               (2.3)\nForeign Aid Disbursements\nWhen a foreign loan contract is signed, the amount is not directly paid to the borrower.\nInstead, a loan account is opened in the creditor\u2019s books under the name of the borrower, and the\nloan amount is credited to that account. Withdrawal from the account is approved only after fulfillment\nof the requirements attached to the loan contracts. Foreign grants are paid in a similar way when\na foreign grant contract is signed. Two equations are designed in the model for the purpose of\nrelating foreign aid disbursement (the sum of foreign loans and foreign grants) to foreign borrowings\nand foreign grants in the government block. There should be a one-for-one long run relationship\nbetween the two  foreign loans and two foreign grants, respectively. As expected, the short-run\nelasticity of foreign loans (foreign aid disbursements) with respect to foreign borrowing in the\ngovernment block is 0.37, but its long-run elasticity is close to 1.00.                      \n14 June 2005", "Section IV\nThe Structure of the Model\nLog(LOAN)= 0.28 + 0.37*Log(FBORR) + 0.62*Log(LOAN(-1))                                                      (Equation 17)\n                                       (1.3)                (5.0)                           (10.1)\nLog(GRANT)=  -0.04 + 1.00*Log(FGRT)                                                                                                 (Equation 18)\n  (-0.4)           (69.3)\n6.  Block Linkages\nOnce the coefficients in each behavioral equation are estimated, a simulation can be\nconducted to solve for each endogenous variable. Given certain initial values, interactions among\nvariables across blocks are repeated until the system finds the equilibrium for the economy.\nTherefore, it is important to understand how the variables or blocks are linked to each other in the\nsystem.\nThe government block is crucial for determining final demand. In particular, private fixed\ninvestment as well as government consumption and government fixed investment are strongly\naffected by government expenditures. The interest rate, from the money and financial block,\ndetermines fixed investment. Real exports and imports of goods and non-factor services in the\nfinal demand block are directly linked to the BOP block through simple bridge equations. The price\nblock also affects final demand by converting nominal variables to real variables.\nThe price block is almost exogenous in the sense that prices are primarily determined by\nexogenous variables. Prices do affect variables in other blocks, but not vice versa. Prices in Nepal\nis a function of the Indian price and exchange rate, both of which are determined exogenously.  The\neffect of the M2 is relatively weak since under the fixed exchange rate regime, the monetary authority\ncannot control the monetary base while the price level is greatly affected by the exchange rate.\nThe money and credit block is linked to final demand, government, and BOP.  The aggregate\nM2 is the sum of private and government domestic credits and net foreign assets. Nominal GDP\nfrom the final demand block determines the change in domestic private credit. In contrast, the\nchange in domestic government credit is determined by the overall government deficit from the\ngovernment block. The change in net foreign assets is determined by the overall balance from the\nBOP block.\nThe government block is directly linked only to the final demand block. Nominal GDP from\nthe final demand block plays a role as a scale variable in the non-tax revenue equation. Other\nimportant variables in the government block are mainly policy variables, including tax revenue,\ndevelopment expenditures, regular expenditures, and foreign borrowing.\nThe BOP block is linked to the final demand block and the government block.  Imports of\ngoods and services are primarily determined by nominal GDP. Foreign loans and official capital\ngrants are connected with the variables in the BOP block.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 15", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nC. Evaluation of the In-sample Forecasting Performance\nWell-specified individual behavioral equations are a prerequisite for a good\nmacroeconometric model. From a statistical perspective, individual equation estimation should\nexhibit high goodness of fit, and the coefficient estimates should be statistically significant. However,\ngood statistical properties in individual equations do not necessarily imply a good performance of\nthe model as a whole. Rather, good forecasting performance of the model depends on how well\nthe relations between behavioral equations are linked and if the coefficient estimates are\neconomically reasonable. Tests need to be carried out to determine whether the predicted values\nfrom the system trace the actual history of the variables reasonably well to evaluate the forecasting\nperformance of the model.\nThe model is evaluated for both within-sample and out of sample predictive performances.\nThe evaluation of within-sample performance is mainly via conventional statistics such as the root\nmean square percentage error (RMSPE). Out-of-sample forecasting performance is evaluated\nusing stochastic simulations. Out-of-sample forecasting performance is not discussed in this\npaper. Stochastic simulations of variables by adding random shocks were performed using the\nNMM and a more in-depth discussion is presented in the paper on debt sustainability.19\nThe RMSPE is one of the most widely used statistics for testing the performance of a\nmodel.

As expected, among the components of GDP the\nforecasting errors for consumption and import are quite low, while those for investment and exports\nare relatively high. The model forecasts of the prices (CPI and PGDP) are also satisfactory; RMSPE\nfor current account balance is relatively high and unsatisfactory.  Since net foreign assets is directly\nlinked to the BOP and as it  is also a component of the aggregate money supply, RMSPE for net\nforeign assets and M2 are also high.\n19 ADB. 2004.

POLICY SCENARIOS\n The primary purpose of developing the NMM is to provide guidelines for macroeconomic\nplanning and management by forecasting the future path of the economy. However, forecasting\nperformance usually declines with the length of the forecasting horizon. In the case of Nepal,\nconsidering the rapidly changing economic structure, it is more likely to be so. Taking this into\nconsideration, the forecasting horizon is set at 5 years.20\nIt follows that a set of assumptions are needed on the future values of exogenous variables\nincluding government policy variables. In particular, since policy variables have great influence on\nthe course of the economy, it is important to set the future values of policy variables in a consistent\nway. The NMM has five policy variables: (i) tax revenue, (ii) development expenditures, (iii) regular\nexpenditures, (iv) foreign borrowings, and (v) exchange rate. A point to be noted is that under a\nfixed exchange rate regime, exchange rate policy can be regarded as part of monetary policy.\nConsequently, the policy variables in the NMM are mostly fiscal policy variables and a variable for\nthe exchange rate.21\nPolicy variables can be affected by the socioeconomic environment and political change.\nTherefore, three different policy scenarios are considered in this paper, according to the different\npolitical and social situations that Nepal may face. Initially, a baseline scenario and then two additional\nscenarios consistent with Nepal\u2019s Tenth Plan are presented. Detailed explanations for the three\nscenarios are provided in the following subsections. A time series technique is considered to\nproduce the projections for future values in all three scenarios for other exogenous variables.\n20 In the user-friendly version the forecasting horizon can be set as either 5 years or 10 years.\n21 Efforts to internalize the exchange rate in an alternative setup was not successful. Since the Nepalese rupee was\nfixed to the Indian rupee in the past, the exchange rate did not show a significant response to any domestic\nmacroeconomic variable.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 17", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nFigure 2: Historical and Policy Simulations22\nGross Domestic Product (Real)\n320000 390000\n     \n280000 GDP Historical 380000 GDP scenario\n370000\n240000\n360000\n200000 350000\n340000\n160000\n330000\n120000\n320000\n80000 310000\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 2005 2006 2007\n         \nGDP GDP (Baseline) GDP GDP(HG) GDP (LG)\n     \n \nConsumer Price Index\n160 195\nCPI Historical CPI scenario\n140 190\n120\n185\n100\n180\n80\n175\n60\n170\n40\n20 165\n0 160\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 2005 2006 2007\nCPI CPI (Baseline) CPI CPI (HG) CPI (LG)\n \nDomestic Credit\n250000 420000\nDC Histrorical 400000 DC scenario\n200000 380000\n360000\n150000\n340000\n100000 320000\n300000\n50000 280000\n260000\n0 2004 2005 2006 2007\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000\nDC DC (HG) DC (LG)\nDC DC (Baseline)\n22 HG denotes high growth scenario and LG denotes low growth scenario.\n18 June 2005", "Section V\nPolicy Scenarios\nBroad Money (M2)\n \n240000 310000\n   \nM2Historical M2scenario\n200000   300000  \n290000\n160000\n280000\n120000\n270000\n80000\n260000\n40000 250000\n0 240000\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 2005 2006 2007\n   M2 M2(Ba seline) M2 M2 (H G) M2(LG) \n     \nCurrent Revenue\n60000 80000\nCURREV Historical CURREV scenario\n50000\n75000\n40000\n70000\n30000\n65000\n20000\n60000\n10000\n0 55000\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 2005 2006 2007\nCURREV CURREV (Baseline) CURREV CURREV (HG) CURREV (LG)\nCurrent Account Balance\n10000 -12000\nCB historical CB scenario\n0 -16000\n-10000 -20000\n-20000 -24000\n-30000 -28000\n-40000 -32000\n-50000 -36000\n1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2004 2005 2006 2007\nCB CB (Baseline) CB CB (HG) CB (LG)\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 19", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nA.  Baseline Scenario\nInstead  of making ad hoc assumptions on the policy variables, the baseline scenario\nsimply extrapolates recent trends of policy variables as well as exogenous variables over the next\n5 years. Simple extrapolation of policy variables using a time series technique implies that political\nor social changes are not considered and that the recent trends in policy variables continue. A time\nseries model of auto regression [AR(2)] with a time trend does a reasonably good job for most\nvariables.23 Table 2 shows the forecasted values for policy variables. The second column, FY1986\u2013\nFY2002, indicates the actual values during the period from FY1986 to FY2002.  The   last column\nshows the averages of predicted values from FY2003 to FY2007.24\nTable 2: Policy Variables under Baseline Scenario\n(%)\n  Variables                              FY1986- FY2005- Variables FY1986-        FY2005-\n                                                 FY2004 FY2007 FY2004        FY2007\nTAX/GDPN        8.1                10.7 REGEXP/GDPN        7.2             13.5\nDEVEXP/GDPN                           10.2        5.5 FBORR/(-)OVSURFG             59.2             17.8\nERA        8.0        5.7 FBORR/GDPN        3.1               0.6\nNote 1: Figures for ERA (exchange rate) refer to the depreciation rates.\nNote 2: A minus sign in front of overall balance after grants (OVSURFG) denotes a government deficit after grants.\nWhile the average tax ratio was 8% over the last 17 years, it is forecast to rise to 10.7%\nover the next 3 years in the baseline scenario. The share of government expenditures out of\nnominal GDP is forecasted to increase slightly over the next 3  years. However, the composition of\ngovernment expenditures is expected to change markedly. The share of regular expenditures will\nincrease from 7.2% to 13.5%, whereas the share of development expenditures is expected to\ndecline from 10.2% to 5.5%. The decline of development expenditures can be attributed to the\nrecent decline in foreign borrowing, the major financing source for development expenditures.\nThe foreign borrowing ratio is forecast to decrease from 59.2% to 17.8% reflecting the\nrecent drop in foreign borrowing. The actual ratio of foreign borrowing over budget deficit (FBORR/\n(-)OVSURFG) was 40.8%, 17.9% and 13.8% in FY2001, FY2002, and FY2003, respectively. The\nhuge drop in the foreign borrowing ratio (with respect to the government\u2019s overall balance after\ngrants) reflects its downward trend in recent years. As the recent declining trend in foreign\nborrowings is due to the onset of political instability in 2001/02, the return of political stability in the\nnear future would lead to an understated foreign borrowing ratio in the baseline forecast.\n23 Reported tax revenue and reported regular expenditures by the AR(2)+trend model were forecasted. Necessary\nadjustments of firm registration fees, loans and investments, and principal payments were also made. These\nadjustments for the period of FY2003\u2013FY2007 are discussed in the next section.  For other exogenous  variables,\nthe following assumptions or time series models were used. STD =0, FDI=0 for all periods, AR(2)+trend\nspecification (IS, DCO, OM2, INT, CAPREV, PRPAY, PECO), AR(1)+trend specification (XIND, MIND, NTRS), AR(2)\nspecification (INDP, NSER).\n24 The figures in Table 4 follow the ADB format, and therefore, differ from the official Government of Nepal statistics.\n20 June 2005", "Section V\nPolicy Scenarios\nHowever, if political stability is not restored, the baseline scenario indicates that it will become\nincreasingly difficult for Nepal to obtain external financing in the form of loans and grants.25 The\nNepalese rupee is expected to depreciate against the US dollar, yet the rate of depreciation will\nslow from 8.0% to 5.7% over the next 3 years.\nB. Two Policy Scenarios\nThe political situation often imposes a constraint on government policies and affects resource\nallocation. However, it is difficult to address the uncertainty about future changes in the political\nand socioeconomic environment in the policy simulation.  Indeed, future political situation seems\nunpredictable in Nepal. Taking this into account, the baseline scenario documented in the previous\nsubsection implicitly assumes that recent trends in policy variables will continue to hold in Nepal.\nNevertheless, alternative scenarios can be considered to examine how the economy responds to\nthe alternative policy shocks associated with them.\nNepal formulated the Tenth Plan to implement an appropriate development strategy for the\nperiod from FY2003 to FY2007. Given the uncertain fiscal prospects and political climate, the\nTenth Plan addresses two alternative scenarios: an optimistic normal growth scenario and a\npessimistic low growth scenario. In line with these scenarios in the Tenth Plan, two policy scenarios\nare developed. They are also named as normal growth scenario (NGS) and low growth scenario\n(LGS). Future values for policy variables in NGS and LGS are specified to match those of the\ncorresponding variables in the Tenth Plan. Although the exchange rate is a policy variable in the\nNMM, the future path of exchange rate is not included in the Tenth Plan. Therefore, the exchange\nrate is forecast by AR(2) plus a time trend model which is used for both the NGS and LGS.\nTable 3: Average Growth Rates of Policy Variables under NGS and LGS\n(%)\nVariables FY1986- NGS LGS Variables FY1986- NGS LGS\nFY2004 2005-07 2005-07 FY2004          2005-07        2005-07\nTAX      15.7     9.6     6.1 REGEXP      17.0     2.6     3.5\nDEVEXP      10.4     7.4     7.4 FBORR      27.0   35.2   33.1\nERA        8.0             5.7     5.7 FGRTa      20.0   11.2   11.9\na Not a policy variable but a simple exogenous variable.\nTable 3 shows the average growth rates of the policy variables and also reports the growth\nrates of foreign grants though it is an exogenous variable and not a policy variable in the NMM.\nUnder both NGS and LGS, tax revenues will rise, but at a much slower rate than in the past 19\nyears. Since economic growth is higher under NGS, the growth rate of tax revenue is also expected\nto be higher under NGS than LGS. Compared to the past, development expenditures are likely to\nincrease rapidly under NGS but much more slowly under LGS. In contrast, the growth rates of\n25 Two possible paths for foreign grants were considered. Even though foreign grants are not policy variables, the\namount can be affected by domestic situations.\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 21", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nregular expenditures are lower than that of development expenditures under both NGS and LGS.\nThe time-series extension predicts that the depreciation rate of the Nepalese rupee against the US\ndollar will decrease during the Tenth Plan period, FY2005\u2013FY2007. It may be surprising that the\ngrowth rate of foreign borrowing is higher during the Tenth Plan period.  Foreign borrowings have\nsomewhat recovered in FY2004 since the substantial decline in FY2002 and FY2003 and they are\nassumed to rebound to normal levels in FY2005 in NGS and LGS, leading to a higher growth rate\nof foreign borrowings in Table 3.26  However, the growth rates of foreign grant inflows are assumed\nto decline under NGS and LGS.\nWhile Table 3 shows the growth rates of the policy variables under NGS and LGS, Table 4\nshows the level of the policy variables to compare their forecast under the baseline scenario in\nTable 2. In Table 4, policy variables are scaled by nominal GDP, while foreign borrowing is scaled\nby the government\u2019s overall balance after grants.27\nTable 4: Policy Variables under NGS and LGS\n(%)\n   Variables FY1986-  NGS LGS Variables FY1986-  NGS LGS\nFY2004 2005-07 2005-07 FY2004         2005-07      2005-07\n   TAX/GDPN         8.1     9.2     9.1 REGEXP/GDPN        8.6     8.1    8.9\n   DEVEXP/GDPN       10.2     7.2     6.2 FBORR/(-)OVSURFG      59.2          125.0         168.9\n   ERA         8.0     5.7     5.7 FBORR/GDPN        3.1     1.6    1.6\nWhile the growth rate of tax revenue is expected to slow under the two scenarios, the tax\nburdens scaled by nominal income will rise by 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively. The higher tax burdens\nsuggest that taxes will be more important in financing government expenditures in the future,\nparticularly under the NGS scenario.  Despite the lower tax revenue under LGS, total government\nexpenditures will be higher. An interesting finding is that the composition of government expenditures\nchanges dramatically. The volume of development expenditures exceeded that of regular\nexpenditures during the FY1986\u2013FY2004 sample period, but this will not be the case during the\nTenth Plan period.  The change in the composition of expenditures is more significant under LGS.\nThe decline in development expenditures is related to the anticipated decline of foreign borrowings\nunder NGS and LGS, a major financing source of development expenditures. The average ratio of\nforeign borrowing to nominal GDP is expected to decline from 3.1% to 1.6% under both scenarios.\n26 Foreign borrowing decreased by 61% in FY2002; normal growth scenario and low growth scenario assume that\nit increases by 148% and 143%, respectively, in FY2004.\n27 Solution values were used for GDPN and OVSURFG under NGS and LGS from FY2003\u2013FY2007.\n22 June 2005", "Section VI\nForecasting  Results by Policy Scenarios\nVI.

However, private consumption is expected to decline sharply whereas government\n         \ninvestments are expected to increase and CPI inflation will be around 5.3%.

Reflecting the\nsharp drop in foreign borrowing in the baseline scenario, the percentage of borrowing from domestic\nsources to finance the budget deficit is predicted at over 86%. It should be noted, however, that if\nthe sharp decline in foreign borrowing was due to temporary political instability, the projected volume\nof domestic financing might be overestimated.\nTable 5: Baseline Simulation\n(%)\n   Variables FY1998-04 FY2005-07 Variables FY1998-04 FY2005-07\n  Actual  Baseline    Actual  Baseline\n   CP             3.7              2.9 M2            15.3              2.9\n   CG             5.5            10.8 CURREV/GDPN            11.2            11.3\n   FCP             1.6             -3.1 OVSURFG/GDPN             -3.3             -4.8\n   FCG             3.1              5.4 DBORR/(-)OVSURFG            53.1            86.3\n   GDP             3.6              2.8 TB/GDPN           -15.1           -15.9\n   GDPN             8.5              7.8 CB/GDPN             -5.7             -7.1\n   CPI             5.3              5.3 KB/GDPN              7.2              4.5\n   DC           14.0            13.9 OB/GDPN              1.5             -2.7\n   NFA           15.9             -6.3 FAD/GDPN              4.4              3.3\nNote: Except for the ratios with respect to GDPN or OVSURFG, the other figures are average annual growth rates.\nB.

First, private consumption, the\nlargest component of domestic demand, is determined by disposable income that, in turn, is\nprimarily affected by GDP. Even though the tax rate is higher under NGS than LGS, private\nconsumption grows faster under NGS due to higher disposable income or GDP. Given the\nspecification of the private consumption equation, however, it is more appropriate to argue that\nconsumption is higher under the NGS because GDP is higher rather than vice versa. The growth\nrate of nominal regular expenditures in Table 3 and the inflation rate in Table 6 suggest that the\ngrowth rates of real regular expenditures are essentially negative. Since government consumption\nis primarily determined by the real regular expenditures, the growth rates of government consumption\nare negative under both scenarios. Moreover, government consumption cannot explain the GDP\ngrowth rate differentials since the growth rates of regular expenditures are higher under the LGS\nthan that of the NGS as can be seen in Table 3. Second, fixed investments, both real private fixed\ncapital (94/95 base year) and real government fixed investment (94/95 base year), are primal\ncomponents in explaining the different GDP growth rates. In the NMM, Real Government Fixed I\n24 June 2005", "Section VII\nConclusion\nnvestment (94/95 base year) is specified to be a function of development expenditures and is\nassumed to grow at 15.1% under NGS and 6.9% under LGS. The difference between the two\ngrowth rates of development expenditures leads to huge difference in the growth rates of fixed\ninvestment and thereby, the GDP growth rates.\nThird, foreign demand cannot be responsible for the different GDPs because the growth rates for\nexports are almost identical under NGS and LGS. Imports, however, grow at a faster rate under\nNGS than LGS as the volume of imports depends greatly on domestic economic activity.\nConsequently, the trade deficit is larger under NGS. Foreign direct investment, private capital, and\nerrors and omissions are the same under both policy scenarios. Official loans and capital grants\nvary depending on the scenarios for foreign borrowing and the assumption for grants.  Due to the\nassumption of a larger volume of grants under LGS, the ratio of the capital balance to nominal\nGDP is higher under LGS than NGS, though the difference is small. In sum, development expenditure\nis the most important factor that can explain the growth rate differentials between the NGS and the\nLGS.\nC. Comparison with the Tenth Plan\nTable 7 compares the annual forecasts of the NMM with those of the Tenth Plan\u2014the\ncurrent guide for economic policy in Nepal. The comparison shows that the forecasts from the\ntwo  models are consistent. However, while the NMM forecasts for FY2005 are higher than those\nof the Tenth Plan, the average growth projection of the Tenth Plan is more optimistic than that of\nthe NMM in the normal growth scenario. The average growth rate forecasts in the Tenth Plan are\n7.2% in normal scenario and 5.2% in low scenario and 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively, in the NMM.\nTable 7: Comparison with the Tenth Plana\n(%)\nFY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007\nNor Low Nor Low Nor Low Nor Low Nor Low\n10th Plan 3.3          2.0 6.1  4.0 6.5  4.5 7.5  5.0 7.5  6.0\nGDP growth\nNMM 3.6         3.6 3.5  3.5        7.4  6.5 3.9  2.8 5.2  3.9\na Nor and Low denote the normal scenario and the low scenario, respectively.

The model is useful for policy simulations, economic planning and debt sustainability\nanalysis. The new model and the Tenth Plan produce comparable forecasts, suggesting that the\nmodel demonstrates good forecasting capacity and versatile potential for policy simulations. The\nsatisfactory within-sample forecasting capacity of the model is illustrated by conventional measures\nNRM Working Paper Series No.  1 25", "Nepal Macroeconometric Model\nSungsup Ra and Chang Yong Rhee\nof the predictive accuracy of the model such as root mean square percentage error, which were\ncomputed for several key variables in both static and dynamic runs of the model.\nA comparison of the forecasts of the NMM with those of the Tenth Plan indicates that the\ngrowth projection of the Tenth Plan is overly optimistic compared with that of the NMM. The\nforecasting results show that political stability and the inflow of foreign borrowings are very important\nfactors in determining the long run growth prospects for the Nepalese economy.\n26 June 2005", "References\nREFERENCES\nADB. 2004.
