However, \ninitial  expectations  have  turned  out  to  be  overly  optimistic.  Coordination  problems \nbetween  agencies,  constraints  on  aid  absorption  capacity,  and  inequities  in  aid \ndistribution  among  regions  have  hampered  reconstruction.  Infrastructure  reconstruction \ntargets  have  not  been  fully  met.  Initial  expectations  that  the  tsunami  experience  would \nlead to peace were not fulfilled, inequitable distribution exacerbated mistrust, and large-\nscale  conflict  has  resumed.  Macroeconomic  management  and  efficient  absorption  of  a \nlarge,  necessarily  temporary,  inflow  of  foreign  funds  has  been  a  daunting  task. \nConstruction  costs  rapidly  escalated,  producing  unanticipated  funding  gaps  and \naggravating  fiscal  deficit  problems.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  highlights  the  need  for \nanticipating  such  cost  increases  when  assessing  needs  following  major  disasters,  as \nwell as the need for formulation of  a phased programme of reconstruction which takes \ninto account the supply side constraints of construction inputs.  \n\nJEL Classifications: Q54, F35, H54, I38, O19 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\n1. BACKGROUND \n\nThe earthquake that caused the tsunami on 26 December 2004 occurred at 6:58 am Sri \nLanka time with the first large wave hitting the east coast at 8:35 am. Within a very short \ntime over 36,000 people were dead (this total includes the 5,644 who remain classified \nas \u2018missing\u2019), and several hundred thousand had been displaced. Massive damage had \nalso  been  inflicted  on  thousands  of  houses  and  other  buildings,  railways,  bridges, \ncommunication networks, and other infrastructure and capital assets.  \n\nAlthough  Sri  Lanka  had  experienced  periodic  droughts,  floods,  landslides,  and  the \noccasional  cyclone,  in  recorded  history  it  had  never  experienced  a  tsunami,  or  indeed \nany other type of natural disaster of this scale and magnitude.1 Although the country was \ncompletely  unprepared  for  a  disaster  of  this  scale,  the  relief  effort  that  got  underway \nalmost \nthe \ngovernment and international agencies\u2014was able to feed, clothe, and shelter survivors; \nprovide the injured with medical attention; and ensure that the thousands of bodies were \ncremated  or  buried,  avoiding  any  disease  outbreaks.  The  initial  response  is  generally \nagreed \nthe  understandable  confusion  which \naccompanied this effort at times.  \n\nto  have  been  a  success  despite \n\nimmediately\u2014initially  organized  by \n\nlocal  communities, \n\nfollowed  by \n\nHowever,  as  described  in  our  earlier  report  on  this  issue  (Jayasuriya,  Steele  and \nWeerakoon,  2006),  it  became  clear  as  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  phase \nproceeded  that  moving  from  the  immediate  relief  effort  to  addressing  the  massive \nreconstruction  tasks  posed  a  different  set  of  challenges  that  was  in  many  ways  more \ncomplex.  The  tsunami  had  come  at  a  time  of  deterioration  of  the  macroeconomic \nenvironment:  GDP  growth  was  slowing  from  the  second  quarter,  inflationary  pressure \nhad  been  persistently  building  from  the  middle  of  2004,  fiscal  and  external  current \naccount deficits were growing, and the currency was rapidly depreciating.  \n\nAs  explained  in  the  earlier  report,  the  tsunami\u2014paradoxically\u2014brought  a  measure  of \nstability  to  the  economy,  which  had  been  straining  under  growing  macroeconomic \nimbalances.  For  Sri  Lanka,  as  for  other  affected  countries  that  were  ready  to  accept \nexternal  assistance,  the  promised  international  assistance  appeared  to  be  more  than \nadequate to cover the full costs of immediate relief and reconstruction, and produced an \nalmost  euphoric  (though  impermanent)  national  mood.  In  particular,  it  provided  an \nunanticipated source of foreign capital inflows for the relief and reconstruction effort and \nenabled  the  country  to  avoid  the  slide  towards  a  currency  crisis.  Not  only  did  the \nadditional influx of foreign capital allow Sri Lanka to maintain a fairly healthy balance of \npayments  (BOP)  during  2005\u20132006,  but  relief  and  reconstruction-related  expenditures \nalso  boosted  GDP  growth  to  a  healthy  annual  average  of  6.7  per  cent  over  the  same \nperiod.  \n\nWhile the tsunami diverted attention away from the growing structural imbalances in the \neconomy,  they  were  not  eliminated.  As  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  phase \nproceeds\u2014albeit  at  a slower  pace than  initially  anticipated\u2014issues  taking  centre stage \n\n                                                 \n1 Sri Lanka had no effective domestic hazard warning system, and had not felt the need to be part \nof  international  early  warning  systems,  such  as  the  Tsunami  Warning  System  (TWS)  in  the \nPacific (which has 26 member countries).  \n \n\n \n\n1\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nrelate  to  the  effectiveness  with  which  resources  were  mobilized,  the  effectiveness  of \ndelivering  assistance  and  its  coordination,  and  the  gaps  opening  up  in  financing \nreconstruction  and  the  implications  of  these  financing  gaps  for  macroeconomic  policy \nmanagement.  The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  contribute  to  the  discussions and  debates  on \nappropriate policies for the medium-term reconstruction effort by providing an analysis of \nsome  of  the  priority  issues  emerging  from  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  of  post-tsunami \nreconstruction and rehabilitation. We update and expand the discussion and analysis of \nthe earlier report and draw on a survey of affected households in an attempt to obtain a \nbroader  understanding  of  the  perceptions  of  the  recovery  process  at  the  grass-roots \nlevel.2   \n\n2. IMPACT OF THE TSUNAMI \n\nThe  final  death  toll  has  been  estimated  at  around  36,000.  Initial  estimates  of  those \ndisplaced placed the number around 800,000. By mid-2005 this number had come down \nfound  alternative  sources  of \nto  around  516,000  as  some  of \naccommodation  with \nto  buildings  and  physical \ninfrastructure was massive. Tens of thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed, \nmany  hotels  were  severely  damaged,  and  six  hotels  were  completely  washed  away. \nMore than 240 schools were destroyed or sustained serious damage. Several hospitals, \ntelecommunication networks, and the coastal railway network were also damaged.  \n\nfriends  and  relatives.

The  first  survey  was  carried  out  in  April  2005  (IPS-TS  2005) \ncovering 622 households in six affected districts. The second survey of the same households was \ncarried out in July 2006 (IPS-TS 2006). See Appendix 1 for details on methodology and coverage \nof the survey. \n\n \n\n2\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nwere  severely  damaged.  The  Eastern  Province  was  particularly  hard  hit  accounting  for \nnearly  half  of  total  deaths  and  displaced  persons  as  well  as  numbers  of  houses \ndamaged  (Table  1).  The  severity  of  the  tsunami  disaster  in  the  Northern  and  Eastern \nProvinces  compounded  problems  arising  from  two  decades  of  conflict  between  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The \nmajority  of  an  estimated  360,000  conflict-related  internally  displaced  people  lived  in \nthese  two  provinces.  From  the  very  early  stages,  there  were  concerns  about  how \nassistance could be channelled to LTTE-controlled areas. However, basic relief supplies \ndid manage to get through to affected people during the early phases of the relief effort. \n\nTable 1: Key Human and Asset Loss by District/Province \n\nDistrict/Province \n\nGalle \nMatara \nHambantota \nSouthern Province \nColombo \nGampaha \nKalutara \nWestern Province \nAmpara \nBatticaloa \nTrincomalee \nEastern Province \nJaffna \nMullaitivu \nKillinochchi \nNorthern Province \nTotal \nNotes: aAs of January 2005; bAs of October 2005.  \nSource: Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). \n\nNo. of \nDeathsa \n4,214 \n1,342 \n4,500 \n10,056 \n79 \n6 \n256 \n341 \n10,440 \n2,840 \n1,078 \n14,354 \n2,640 \n3,000 \n500 \n6,200 \n30,955 \n\nNo. of \nDisplaceda \n128,077 \n13,305 \n17,723 \n159,105 \n31,239 \n1,449 \n27,713 \n60,401 \n75,238 \n61,912 \n81,643 \n218,727 \n39,907 \n22,557 \n1,603 \n64,067 \n502,366 \n\nNo. of Damaged \nHousesb \n12,781 \n7,464 \n4,084 \n24,329 \n5,984 \n675 \n6,124 \n12,783 \n24,438 \n17,948 \n8,074 \n50,460 \n5,109 \n5,556 \n288 \n10,953 \n98,525 \n\n   \nThe preliminary assessment of damages completed by end-January 2005 through a joint \neffort  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  (JBIC),  and  the  World  Bank  (WB)  estimated  that  Sri  Lanka  had  suffered \nasset  damages  of  around  US$1  billion  (4.5  per  cent  of  GDP),  and  estimated  that  the \nmedium-term financing needs (including immediate relief) would be around US$1.5\u20131.6 \nbillion  (7.5  per  cent  of  GDP).  The  largest  financing  needs  were  in  the  housing  sector.3 \nThe destruction of private assets was substantial (US$700 million), in addition to public \ninfrastructure  and  other  assets.  Loss  of  current  output  in  the  fisheries  and  tourism \nsectors\u2014which were severely affected\u2014was estimated at US$200 million and US$130 \nmillion, respectively. Key industrial, agricultural, and metropolitan centres were relatively \nunaffected and the damage to capital assets was primarily to the tourism and fisheries \nsectors, each of which contributes only around 1.5\u20132 per cent of GDP.  \n\n                                                 \n3 The significant differences between total recovery needs and damages in some sectors are due \nto the fact that the recovery strategy for those sectors focuses on long-term development targets \nrather than merely on restoration. \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 2: Estimates of Losses and Needs Assessment on Reconstruction and \nRebuilding (US$ million) \n \nADB/JBIC/WBa \n\n \n \nHousing \nRoads \nWater & \nsanitation \nRailways \nEducation \nHealth \nAgriculture \nFisheries \nTourism \nPower \nEnvironment \nMicrofinance \nOther \nTotal ($ bn.) \n\nLosses \n306\u2013341\n60\n42\n\nNeeds \n437\u2013487\n200\n117\n\nGOSL \nFeb. 05b  May 05c \n400 \n353 \n205 \n\n400\n210\n190\n\n15\n26\n60\n3\n97\n250\n10\n10\n\u2014\n90\n0.9\u20131.0\n\n130\n45\n84\n4\n118\n130\n67\u201377\n18\n\u2014\n180\n1.5\u20131.6\n\n77\n90\n100\n10\n250\n58\n\u2014\n30\n150\n239\n1.8\n\n- \n170 \n100 \n10 \n200 \n \n115 \n30 \n157 \n424 \n2.2 \n\n \nNotes: aADB/JBIC/WB (2005); bGOSL (2005d); cGOSL (2005c); dMFP (2005), Budget Speech \n2006, (December 2005). \nSource: ADB/JBIC/WB and GOSL. \n \nThese aggregate figures for financing needs were quite close to the government\u2019s own \nestimate  of  US$1.8  billion  presented  in  February  2005,  though  there  were  some \nimportant  differences  at \n(GOSL,  2005d). \nSubsequently,  the  GOSL  firmed  up  the  country\u2019s  total  investment  needs  to  be  US$2.2 \nbillion  (GOSL  2005c).4 Some  of  the  differences  between  these  estimates  reflected  the \ngovernment\u2019s more ambitious longer-term plans while the donor assessment was largely \ngeared  to  restoring  the  pre-tsunami  situation.  In  line  with  the  regional  variation  in  the \nextent of damages incurred, the largest financing needs were identified in the East (45 \nper  cent),  followed  by  the  South  (26  per  cent),  North  (19  per  cent),  and  West  (10  per \ncent).  \n\nlevel  damage  estimates \n\nthe  sector \n\n3. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE \n\nIn  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  tsunami,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  Law  and \nOrder set up an operations centre, the Centre for National Operations (CNO), to handle \nthe  response,  and  the  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  was  appointed  as  the  Commissioner \nGeneral  of  Essential  Services  to  oversee  the  coordination  of  government  agencies \ninvolved in rescue and relief. Three task forces were set up to address specific aspects \nof the relief effort: the Task Force for Rescue and Relief (TAFRER); the Task Force for \nLogistics,  Law  and  Order  (TAFLOL);  and  the  Task  Force  for  Rebuilding  the  Nation \n(TAFREN). \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4 The GOSL identified its needs for a 3\u20135 year rehabilitation phase. \n\n4\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nWhile  there  were  hiccups  and  confusion  in  organizing  the  relief,  for  a  country  that  had \nnot  previously  experienced  such  a  disaster,  Sri  Lankan \ninstitutions  responded \nreasonably well. Essential medical aid, emergency food, and other relief supplies were \nmobilized  within  a  day.  Temporary  shelter  for  the  displaced  was  provided  in  schools, \nother  public  and  religious  buildings,  and  tents.  Communities  and  groups  cooperated \nacross  barriers  that  had  divided  them  for  decades.  Public  and  private  sector \norganizations  cooperated  and  organized  relief  efforts  at  many  levels.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  past \ninvestments  in  public  health  paid  off  in  this  emergency:  the  broad-based  public  health \nsystem and community awareness of basic sanitary and hygienic practices ensured that \nthere were no disease outbreaks.  \n\nOnce  the  immediate  relief  and  rehabilitation  measures  for  provision  of  food,  shelter, \nclothing,  clean  water,  and  sanitary  and  medical  facilities  to  affected  families  had  been \nprovided,  it  was  necessary  to  address  community  needs  to  cope  with  the  trauma  and \nstart  rebuilding  lives.  The  initial  provision  of  cash  grants  to  meet  immediate  needs \nincluded  (i)  compensation  of  SLRs.15,000  (US$150)  for  victims  towards  funeral \nexpenses; (ii) payment of SLRs.375 (US$3.75) in cash and rations for each member of \nthe  family  unit  per  week;  and  (iii)  a  payment  of  SLRs.2,500  (US$25)  towards  basic \nkitchen  equipment.  These  initial  measures  were  largely  successful,  though  there  were \nsome  problems  with  lack  of  coordination. 5  Overall,  the  emergency  relief  was  quite \nsuccessful in meeting the immediate needs of the affected people.6 \n\n4. SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT \n\nThe  tsunami  struck  at  a  time  when  the  Sri  Lankan  macro  economy  was  already  under \npressure on several fronts, reigniting fears of a slide into the kind of crisis that was seen \nin  2001  when  the  economy  contracted  by  1.5  per  cent  (Table  3).  On  the  policy  front, \nthere  was  considerable  unease  within  the  business  and  investor  community  about  the \ndirection  of  economic  policy  under  a  new  government  elected  in  April  2004.  Its \nprogramme, with the stated goal of \u201cgrowth with equity,\u201d and a strong emphasis on rural \neconomic development, was viewed by sections of the business and investor community \nas being populist and interventionist.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5  For  example,  while  food  rations  were  generally  available,  there  were  problems  with  the \nprovision  of  adequate  variety  and  quality  in  some  locations;  complaints  emerged  about  the \napplication of different rules in different areas for the distribution of rations and cash grants.  \n6 An assessment of the initial response to the tsunami at the Sri Lanka Development Forum 2005 \ncan be found at www.erd.gov.lk/DevForum/ \n \n\n5\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 3: Selected Macroeconomic Indicators: 2001\u20132005 \n\nUnit \n\nUS$ billion \n% \n% \n% \n% \n% of GDP \n% of GDP \n \n\nNATIONAL \nACCOUNTS \nGDP \nGDP growth \n  Agriculture \n  Industry \n  Services \nInvestment \nSavings \nEXTERNAL \nSECTOR \nExports  \nImports \nTrade balance  % of GDP \nCurrent a/c \nbalance  \nFDI \nOfficial reserves  US$ million \nTourist arrivals \n\nUS$ million \nUS$ million \n\n% of GDP \n% of GDP \n\n\u2018000 \npersons \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n15.1\n-1.5\n-3.4\n-2.1\n-0.5\n22.0\n15.8\n\n4817\n5974\n-7.3\n\n-1.4\n0.5\n1338\n\n16.4\n4.0\n2.5\n1.0\n6.1\n21.3\n14.5\n\n4699\n6105\n-8.5\n\n-1.4\n1.1\n1700\n\n18.2\n6.0\n1.6\n5.5\n7.9\n22.1\n15.9\n\n5133\n6672\n-8.4\n\n-0.4\n0.9\n2329\n\n19.4\n5.4\n-0.3\n5.2\n7.6\n25.0\n15.9\n\n5757\n8000\n-11.2\n\n-3.2\n1.1\n2196\n\n23.2 \n6.0 \n1.5 \n8.3 \n6.4 \n26.5 \n17.3 \n \n\n6347 \n8863 \n-10.7 \n\n-2.8 \n1.0 \n2735 \n\n26.0\n7.4\n4.7\n7.2\n8.3\n28.7\n17.1\n\n6883\n10253\n-12.5\n\n-4.9\n1.7\n2837\n\n \n\n250\n\n408\n\n340\n\n202\n\n356 \n \n\n14.2\n13.74\n\n336794 393174 500642 566202 549308  559603\n410\n\n25.4\n17.0\n-8.4\n93.0\n\n27.5\n16.7\n-10.8\n103.2\n\n25.4\n16.5\n-8.9\n105.4\n\n23.7\n15.7\n-8.0\n105.8\n\n23.5\n15.4\n-8.2\n105.5\n\n24.7 \n16.1 \n-8.7 \n93.9 \n \n\nTourist earnings  US$ million \nFISCAL \nVARIABLES \nGovt. \n% of GDP \nexpenditure \nGovt. revenue \n% of GDP \nFiscal balance  % of GDP \n% of GDP \nGovt. debt  \n \nPRICES AND \nMONEY \nRate of inflation  % \nInterest ratea \n% \nBroad money \n(M2) \nExchange rate \nASPIb  \nNotes: a2-month Treasury bill rate ; bAll share price index. \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Annual Report, various issues.  \n \nEconomic  growth  began  to  slow  from  the  second  quarter  of  2004  and  ended  the  year \nwith  a  growth  rate  of  5.4  per  cent.  While  the  election-related  uncertainties  and  the \nensuing policy vacuum no doubt contributed to the slowdown in economic activity, some \npolicy  weaknesses  and  the  slow  pace  of  reforms  contributed  to  the  lacklustre \nperformance.  The  most  visible,  and  potentially  the  most  destabilizing  manifestation  of \nweakening  macroeconomic  management  in  2004  was  a  persistent  build  up  of \ninflationary  pressure  from  the  mid-year  onwards.  Inflationary  pressure  was  fuelled  on \nmultiple  fronts,  not  least  by  the  conduct  of  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  driven  by \nincreased subsidies and transfers.  \n\n17.8\n107.7\n1922.2  2722.4\n\n% change \nRs/US$ \n1985=100 \n\n19.6\n104.6\n1506.9\n\n15.3\n96.7\n1062.1\n\n13.4\n96.7\n815.1\n\n13.6\n93.2\n621.0\n\n11.6 \n10.37 \n\n19.1 \n102.1 \n\n13.7\n12.96\n\n7.6\n7.65\n\n6.3\n7.24\n\n9.6\n9.91\n\n \n\n6\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nDomestic  imbalances  were  exacerbated  by  a  ballooning  oil  import  bill  which  saw  the \ncurrent account deficit on BOP widening to over 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2004 (from 0.4 \nper cent in 2003). This was accompanied by a deceleration of capital inflows, with long-\nterm  inflows  to  the  government  (consisting  primarily  of  foreign  concessional  loans) \ndeclining  by  US$130  million  in  2004.  Foreign  borrowings  by  the  commercial  banking \nsector increased significantly in 2004 raising the country\u2019s foreign private debt exposure. \nThe currency depreciated by 8.5 per cent against the US dollar despite efforts to bolster \nthe exchange rate, which contributed to the decline in Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves \nfrom US$2.3 billion at the beginning of 2004 to US$1.9 billion by November.  \n\nThese domestic and external developments led to an acceleration of inflation from mid-\n2004, and real interest rates turned negative. Symptoms of a bubble economy began to \nemerge:  a  sharp  increase  in  credit growth  in  excess  of  20  per  cent  and  a  boom  in  the \nColombo stock market unsupported by major indicators of economic fundamentals. The \npeace  process  between  the  GOSL  and  the  LTTE  appeared  to  have  stalled,  and  with \nprivatization  initiatives  shelved  concerns  over  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  reduce  the \nfiscal deficit began to increase. Markets started to get jittery with the growing realization \nthat  fundamental  imbalances  in  the  economy  were  intensifying.  Though  the  external \npayments  situation  improved  marginally  in  December  2004,  rupee  depreciation  again \ngathered pace. On 17 December 2004, the currency fell to an historical low of SLRs.105 \nagainst the US dollar. \n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  immediate  negative  impact  on  output  as  measured  by  the \nGDP  figure  was  expected  to  be  fairly  limited,  ranging  from  a  0.5  to  a  0.7  per  cent \nreduction  in  2005  GDP.  The  relatively  small  impact  on  GDP  appeared  somewhat \nsurprising given the extent of human and asset losses. This was not only owing to the \nfact  that  only  a  relatively  small  sector  of  the  economy  was  affected,  but  also  because \nGDP captures only the annualised flow of damages to the stock of asset damages, and \nspending on relief efforts was expected to have an immediate positive effect on current \nGDP.   \n\n5. REHABILITATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND RECOVERY PHASE \n\n5.1 Recovery Targets and Actual Progress \n\nThe government planned the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase to be spread over \nthree  to  five  years  (GOSL,  2005c).  Nevertheless,  there  were  pronouncements  at  the \npolitical level that all permanent housing needs would be met within a year. Over time, it \nhas  become  clear  that  these  were  optimistic  pledges.  In  fact,  housing  needs,  for \nexample,  had  not  been  met  fully  even  by  the  end  of  2006,  while  reconstruction  of \ndamaged schools and hospitals, and rehabilitation of roads, bridges, etc. is likely to take \nlonger than envisaged. \n\n5.1.1 Infrastructure \n\nA total of 182 schools and 222 health institutions were affected by the tsunami. Targets \nin  the  education  and  health  sectors  included  the  reconstruction  and  renovation  of  183 \nschools, four universities, seven Vocational Training Authorities, 444 internally displaced \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nperson  (IDP)  schools  (schools  used  as  refugee  camps),  and  the  reconstruction  and \nrenovation of 102 health institutions.  \n\nThe pace of recovery, particularly of larger scale infrastructure projects, has been slow \nwith  an  estimated  50  per  cent  of  construction  projects  yet  to  commence  by  end  2006 \n(GOSL, 2006). By end  2006, 57 per cent of damaged schools were estimated to be in \nvarious stages of construction with only 10 per cent of projects completed and handed \nover  (GOSL,  2006).  Similarly,  in  the  health  sector  only  55  of  a  total  of  102  damaged \nbuildings have been completed (Table 4). \n\nTable 4: Progress in Education and Health Infrastructure \n\n \nNo. affected \nWithout donors \nCompleted \nIn-progress \nNot commenced \nSource: GOSL (2006). \n\nEducation \n\n183 \n11 \n18 \n105 \n49 \n\nHealth \n102 \n\u2014 \n55 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \nThe bulk of infrastructure damage was to roads and railways (Table 5). A total length of \napproximately 800 kilometres of national road network and 1,500 kilometres of provincial \nand  local  government  roads  were  damaged.  The  railway  infrastructure  on  a  160-\nkilometre-long stretch along the tsunami-affected coastline was also severely damaged. \nThe target date for completion of road and bridge reconstruction was set at 2009. As we \nshall  discuss  below,  this  target  date  may  prove  difficult  to  meet  because  of  serious \ncapacity constraints and cost escalations. The government itself has recognised that the \nconstruction  industry  does  not  have  the  necessary  contractors,  equipment,  or  skilled \nworkforce for such a major reconstruction effort (GOSL, 2005a).  \n\nTable 5: Progress in Infrastructure \n \n\n \nWater & sanitation \n\nDamage \n \n\nRoads  \n\nBridges  \n\nRehabilitation of \n1.172 km of roads  \n25 major bridges \n\nProgress 2006 \n130 projects planned.

As  described  in  detail \nlater,  a  significant  proportion  of  relocated  households  was  found  to  have  inadequate \naccess to water, roads, pre-schools, and health clinics, and was worse-off than before.  \n\nthe  rehabilitation  of  damaged \n\ninfrastructure,  new  demands \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\n5.1.2 Housing \n\nThe  immediate  requirement  in  housing  was  to  provide  \u201ctransitional\u201d  shelters  where  a \ntotal  of  57,057  transitional  shelter  units  were  estimated  to  be  needed  to  accommodate \n50  per  cent  of  the  500,000  internally  displaced  (GOSL,  2005a).  The  remainder  of  the \ndisplaced were assumed to have received shelter from friends, relatives, etc. Progress \non  providing  transitional  shelters,  by  and  large,  was  fairly  good;  by  end-2005  over \n56,000 units had been completed.7  \n\nTable 6: Post-tsunami Numbers of Displaced Persons in Transitional Shelters \n\nDec. 2006 \n\n42,525 \n98,525 \n\nJune 2006a \n \n42,196 \n\nDec. 2005 \n \n53,000 \n\nJan. 2005 \n \n56,000 \n\n \n \nGovernment \nCamps \nPrivate Homes \nTotal \nNote: aPost housing policy revision. \nSource: RADA (2006). \n \nThe total number of displaced persons as of January 2005 was estimated at 98,525, of \nwhom  56,000  were  in  government  camps  (transitional shelter)  while  the  rest  were  with \nfamilies/friends  (RADA,  2006).  By  end  December  2005  the  numbers  of  displaced  had \ndropped  to  85,525,  of  whom  53,000  were  in  transitional  shelters.  This  figure  was \nestimated at around 40,000 by end 2006.  \n\n \n17,083 \n\n32,367 \n74,563 \n\n32,525 \n85,525 \n\n \n17,083 \n\nThere have been significant revisions regarding housing policy. An initial declaration by \nthe government of a buffer zone between land and sea of 100 metres on the south and \nsouthwest  coast  and  200  metres  on  the  north  and  east  coast  of  the  country  led  to  the \ninitiation of two types of housing programmes: (i) donor-built housing reconstruction and \n(ii) home owner-driven housing reconstruction. No reconstruction of houses (partially or \nfully damaged) was to be allowed within the buffer zone. Thus, all affected households \nwithin  the  demarcated  buffer  zone  were  to  be  provided  with  a  house  built  with  donor \nassistance on land allocated by the state while allowing them to retain ownership of the \noriginal  land.  Households  were  not  required  to  demonstrate  ownership  of  the  land  to \nqualify for such assistance.  \n\nFor  those  whose  damaged  houses  were  deemed  to  be  outside  the  designated  buffer \nzone, the government agreed to provide grants and loans for households to re-build at \nthe  same  location.  In  order  to  qualify  for  the  entitlement,  households  were  required  to \nprove  ownership  of  the  land.  The  criteria  set  down  in  terms  of  financing  such \nreconstruction  included  an  assessment  of  damages  on  a  points  basis  where  a  house \ndeemed to be more than 40 per cent damaged would qualify for a grant of SLRs.250,000 \n(US$2,500) in four instalments, based on progress. A grant of SLRs.100,000 (US$1,000) \nwas  made  available  to  rebuild  a  house  deemed  to  be  less  than  40  per  cent  damaged, \ndisbursed in two stages.   \n\n                                                 \n7 As of end 2006, 42,096 of the 57,057 shelters originally constructed had been decommissioned \nwith only 14,961 shelters remaining occupied (GOSL, 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nPredictably, the buffer zone became a politically controversial issue from the very outset. \nThe limits were set in a fairly arbitrary manner, not taking into account topographical and \nother  relevant  features  of  the  land  that  would  affect  hazard  risk.  There  was  also \ndissatisfaction that the rules were not to be applied across all building units, with tourist \nenterprises being permitted to rebuild within the designated zone. Many of the tsunami-\naffected  fishermen,  for  example,  argued  the  need  to  retain  land  close  to  the  sea  to \nsustain their livelihoods. \n\nHowever,  IPS-TS  2006  results  showed  that  about  60  per  cent  of  surveyed  households \nthought  that  the  government\u2019s  original  buffer  zone  rule  was  a  \u201cgood  idea.\u201d  Data  at  the \nGrama Niladari Division (GND) level agreed with this finding; almost all Grama Niladaris \n(GNs)  (village  level  government  officers)  interviewed  agreed  that  the  government\u2019s \noriginal  buffer  zone  policy  was  \u201cgood.\u201d  Paradoxically,  they  were  also  happy  with  the \nrelaxation  of  the  buffer  zone  in  2006.  Although  there  were  delays  in  providing  housing \nbecause  of  the  buffer  zone  rule,  most  households  saw  the  prospect  of  better  housing \nbecause of this policy: IPS-TS 2005 results found that most houses that were destroyed \nwere smaller than the minimum floor area of 500 square feet specified for new houses \nunder the donor-driven programme; in other words, a majority of households would get \nsuperior  replacement  houses,  at  least  in  terms  of  floor  area.8 Moreover,  while  all  new \nhouses  are  to  be  built  with  permanent  housing  materials,  a  large  share  of  destroyed \nhouses  had  been  made  of  temporary  housing  material.9 Also,  households  that  did  not \nhave  legal  ownership  of  land  were  given  houses  under  the  donor-driven  programme.10 \nThese  factors  may  have  outweighed  the  costs  incurred  by  many  households  due  to \ndelays in housing progress caused by the 2005 buffer zone rule. \n\nBut there was widespread popular opposition on many levels to the buffer zone policy. \nBy  end  2005,  the  government  had  largely  abandoned  the  idea  of  enforcing  the  buffer \nzone  restrictions.  In  particular,  the  scarcity  of  land  with  which  to  relocate  affected \nhouseholds  highlighted  the  impracticality  of  enforcing  such  a  zone  in  the  face  of  the \nneed to ensure permanent housing within a reasonable period of time. A more relaxed \nbuffer zone policy was announced in May 2006 along with a \u201cRevised Tsunami Housing \nPolicy.\u201d11 It was essentially aimed at ensuring that all tsunami-affected people return to \ntheir houses or get new houses by the end of 2006. The policy document promised \u201ca \nhouse  for  a  house,  regardless  of  land  ownership.\u201d  It  defined  two  zones  (not  buffer \nzones)12 with  four  housing  options  with  the  cost  being  shared  by  the  government  and \ndonors (see Box 2).  \n\n                                                 \n8 About 53 per cent of the surveyed houses made unusable by the tsunami were less than 450 \nsquare feet, while only 10 per cent were bigger than 600 square feet. \n9 About 32 per cent of roofs of the surveyed houses were made of cadjan or metal sheets, while \nclose to half of the surveyed houses had walls made of temporary material. \n10 About 13 per cent of surveyed households inside the buffer zone owned houses on \ngovernment land, while a further 9 per cent owned houses built on other people\u2019s private land. \n11 The new boundaries were set according to the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) Coastal \nManagement Plan of 1997. \n12 Zone 1 referred to any state reservation within tsunami-affected areas while Zone 2 is any area \noutside Zone 1. \n\n \n\n10\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nBox 2: Revised Tsunami Housing Policy \n\n1)  Government  land  +  donor-built  house  under  the  donor-driven  housing \nprogramme primarily for all those who previously lived within the buffer zone. \n2)  Government  land  +  government  cash  grant  (SLRs.250,000)  to  construct  a \nnew  house  +  regulated  donor  assistance  provided  to  complete  the  houses \n(not  less  than  SLRs.250,000  depending  on  costs  to  meet  the  minimum \nstandard house) through co-financing agreement. \n\n3)  Government  cash  grant  (SLRs.150,000  for  three  divisions  in  Ampara  and \nSLRs.250,000  for  Colombo)  to  purchase  land  +  government  cash  grant \n(SLRs.250,000) to construct a house + regulated donor assistance provided \nto  complete  (not  less  than  SLRs.250,000,  depending  on  costs,  to  meet  the \nminimum standard house) through co-financing agreement. \n\n4)  Housing  reconstruction  grant  (SLRs.250,000  for  fully  damaged  homes  and \nSLRs.100,000  for  partially  damaged  homes)  +  regulated  donor  assistance \nprovided to complete only fully damaged houses as required for meeting the \nminimum standard house through co-financing agreement. \n\nSource: RADA (2006). \n \n\nThe revised housing policy pushed the total housing needs to around 110,000 units. The \nkey change was a decision to extend house eligibility to those without legal ownership of \nland  outside  the  former  buffer  zone  and  to  offer  housing  to  extended  family  members \nliving in the affected households. \n\nSecondly,  in  contrast  to  the  earlier  policy,  the  government  and  donors  were  to  jointly \nprovide for a minimum of SLRs.500,000 (US$5,000) cash support to a tsunami-affected \nfamily  to  build  a  house.  The  significant  cost  escalation  of  construction  material  and \nlabour, already clearly visible by end 2005, undoubtedly forced a revision of the earlier \nestimates.  Under  the  revised  policy,  the  GOSL  was  to  provide  the  cash  grant,  initially \nreimbursed  by  different  development  banks  and  bilateral  donors. 13  The  grant  of \nSLRs.250,000  (US$2,500)  each  from  the  government  and  donors  was  to  be  given  in \ninstalments;  a  first  instalment  of  SLRs.50,000  (US$500)  by  the  government  matched \nequally by the donor and thereafter followed accordingly. The beneficiary was to receive \nfull  title  to  the  property  in  the  resettlement  area  (while  retaining  legal  ownership  of \nproperty within the re-designated buffer zone). \n\nFinally, under the donor-built reconstruction programme, standard building requirements \nwere set down by the GOSL of a floor area of 500 square feet; the donor was to make \navailable  common  infrastructure  for  housing  clusters,  and  the  government  was  to \nprovide  services  up  to  the  relocation  site.  The  technical  specifications  were  revised  to \nensure  a  more  equitable  basis.  This  was  primarily  a  response  to  the  initial  experience \nwhere  donors  build  houses  of  widely  varying  quality,  with  some  houses  costing  only \nSLRs.400,000  and  others  being  valued  at  over  SLRs.1  million  (US$4,000  to  over \nUS$10,000), causing friction amongst recipients.14  \n\n                                                 \n13 Extended since to co-financing arrangements through local and foreign NGOs as well.  \n14 Sunday Times, 14 May 2006. About 3 per cent of the households surveyed in the IPS-TS 2006 \nhad  shifted  from  one  NGO-allocated  list  to  another.  The  most  common  reasons  for  switching \nwere: expectation of better assistance, to move closer to the sea, or because the first NGO had \nfailed to deliver a house. \n\n \n\n11\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nThe  new  housing  policy  requirements  are  identified  under  a  homeowner-driven \nprogramme  and  a  relocation  housing  programme.  Overall,  revisions  to  the  housing \npolicy (involving a higher cash grant component and a significant increase in the number \nof  housing  units  deemed  necessary)  meant  that  questions  would  be  raised  about  the \nability  to  meet  the  costs  of  reconstruction  within  the  commitments  made  by  donors.  It \nalso created much confusion amongst the beneficiary households. Only about a quarter \nof  the  households  surveyed  in  the  IPS-TS  2006  were  clear  about  their  housing \nentitlements. Close to 60 per cent indicated that they would like legal advice regarding \ntheir rights as a homeowner. \n\nTable 7: Housing Requirements \n \nOriginal \n(2005) \n\nRevised \n(2006) \n\nCompleted \n(end \n2006) \n46,531 \n34,988 \n11,543 \n \n14,488 \n\n55,525 \n32,497 \n23,028 \n \n43,000 \n\n79,184 \n39,823 \n39,361 \n \n29,830 \n\nHomeowner-driven Programme \nPartially damaged  \nFully damaged  \n \nRelocation Housing Programme \nSource: GOSL, (2006). \n \nAs of November 2006, 46,531 partially or fully damaged houses had been rehabilitated, \nrecording  an  85  per  cent  completion  rate.  Nevertheless,  a  funding  gap  of  US$  107 \nmillion has been identified to complete most of the fully damaged houses (GOSL, 2006). \nIn contrast to the progress in the homeowner-driven rehabilitation, progress in relocating \ntsunami-affected  families  has  been  much  slower  at  only  50  per  cent  of  required  units \nhaving  been  completed  by  November  2006.  As  the  target  in  this  scheme  was  reduced \nsubstantially, the government estimates that sufficient funds are available to successfully \ncomplete this programme (GOSL, 2006). \n\nThe lack of clarity regarding housing entitlements and distribution was apparent from the \nsurvey  results.  The  IPS-TS  2005  and  2006  data  give  information  on  the  location  of \nhouseholds  with  respect  to  the  2005  buffer  zone,  and  house  and  land  tenure  for  559 \nhouseholds. Of these, 268 were eligible for the donor-driven new housing and 157 were \neligible  for  owner-driven  housing  reconstruction.  A  total  of  134  households  were  not \neligible for a new house either because they were not homeowners before the tsunami \n(70  per  cent  of  134)  or  because  they  were  outside  the  2005  buffer  zone,  and  were \nhomeowners without land tenure (30 per cent of 134). \n\nThe  survey  found  considerable  inequities  in  the  distribution  of  new  houses.  Housing \nprogress was worst for people who were actually eligible for donor-driven new housing. \nAbout 65 per cent of such households were still to be found in temporary housing as of \nmid-2006. At the same time, about 56 per cent of households who were not eligible for a \nnew house had received a house. There appeared to be inconsistencies between official \ngovernment policy on housing and actual practice. Some households eligible to relocate \nunder  the  donor-driven  housing  programme  had  rebuilt  (19  per  cent),  while  others \neligible  to  rebuild  under  the  owner-driven  housing  programme  had  relocated  (16  per \ncent).  Some  households  had  received  houses  outside  both  these  programmes,  and \nothers  who  were  not  eligible  to  receive  a  house  under  either  programme  had  also \nreceived houses (see Table 8).  \n\n \n\n \n\n12\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 8: Housing Situation as at July 2006 \n(by eligibility under the 2005 housing programme) \n\nDonor Built on \nOld Site \n\nTemporary \nHousing \n\nNIa \n\nTotal \n\n \n175 \n65.3 \n26 \n16.6 \n59 \n44.0 \n260 \n\n \n11 \n4.1 \n22 \n14.0 \n24 \n17.9 \n57 \n\n \n52 \n19.4 \n76 \n48.4 \n34 \n25.4 \n162 \n\nRebuilt  Relocated\n \n25 \n9.3 \n25 \n15.9 \n17 \n12.7 \n67 \n\nEligibility \n \n \nDonor-driven \n268 \n \n100.0 \nOwner-driven \n157 \n \n100.0 \nNot eligibleb \n134 \n \n100.0 \nTotal \n559 \nNotes: aNo information; bHouseholds not owning a house before the tsunami (70% of 134) and \nhouseholds owning a house on encroached land (30% of 134) outside the buffer zone were not \neligible for a new house under the 2005 housing policy.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on IPS TS 2005 and IPS TS 2006 data. \n \nThere were coordination problems across various donors, especially those who provided \nhouses  without  adhering  to  government  plans.  According  to  local-level  government \nofficials,  the  reluctance  of  local  non-government  agencies  to  share  information  on  aid \ndistribution  and  their  beneficiaries  exacerbated  the  problem  of  coordination  and \nmonitoring.  \n\n \n5 \n1.9 \n8 \n5.1 \n0 \n0.0 \n13 \n\nTable  9  confirms  the  significant  regional  variation  in  housing  progress  across  the \ncountry.  The  uneven  progress  is,  in  part,  due  to  the  resurgence  of  conflict  in  the  north \nand east of the country from end 2005 (Figure 1). The Eastern Province with the highest \nrequirement  of  housing  is  lagging  well  behind.  The  Western  Province  was  also  behind \nthe  Southern  Province,  most  likely  due  to  greater  difficulties  in  obtaining  suitable  land. \nThe survey results were consistent with national data and showed that housing progress \nwas best in the Southern Province for those outside the 2005 buffer zone. Less than 6 \nper  cent  of  surveyed  households  in  this  region  were  in  temporary  housing.  Housing \nprogress  was  worst  for  those  in  the  Eastern  Province\u2014for  households  both  within  and \noutside the 2005 buffer zone. Progress was especially poor for households affected by \nthe conflict.  \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 9: Status of Housing Progress by Region \n(end November 2006) \n\nHomeowner-driven \n\nRelocation \n\nRequirement\n11,405 \n6,048 \n1,469 \n18,922 \n60 \n253 \n5,290 \n5,603 \n21,347 \n19,499 \n3,635 \n44,481 \n4,424 \n5,193 \n611 \n10,228 \n79,184 \n\nCompleted \n9,590 \n5,409 \n1,344 \n16,343 \n53 \n234 \n4,537 \n4,824 \n10,298 \n9,581 \n3,378 \n23,257 \n1,720 \n387 \n0 \n2,107 \n46,531 \n\nRequirement \n3,720 \n2,120 \n4,643 \n10,483 \n1,387 \n436 \n2,862 \n4,685 \n3,721 \n2,961 \n2,872 \n9,554 \n4,257 \n458 \n393 \n5,108 \n29,830 \n\nCompleted \n2,793 \n1,372 \n4,162 \n8,327 \n107 \n218 \n1,687 \n2,012 \n871 \n850 \n884 \n2,605 \n1,348 \n53 \n143 \n1,544 \n14,488 \n\n \n \nDistrict/Province \nGalle \nMatara \nHambantota \nSouthern Province \nColombo \nGampaha \nKalutara \nWestern Province \nAmpara \nBatticaloa \nTrincomalee \nEastern Province \nJaffna \nMullaitivu \nKillinochchi \nNorthern Province \nTotal \nSource: GOSL (2006). \n \n\nFigure 1: Survey Results on Housing Progress by Effect of Conflict \n\n)\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nl\nu\nm\nu\nc\n(\n \ns\ne\ns\nu\no\nh\n \nf\no\n\n \n.\n\no\nN\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nn\na\nJ\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nb\ne\nF\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nr\na\nM\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nr\np\nA\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\ny\na\nM\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nl\n\nu\nJ\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\ng\nu\nA\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\np\ne\nS\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nt\nc\nO\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nv\no\nN\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nc\ne\nD\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\nn\na\nJ\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nb\ne\nF\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nr\na\nM\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nr\np\nA\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\ny\na\nM\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nl\n\nu\nJ\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\nMonth (when rebuilding started or relocated)\n\nrebuilt - conflict affected\n\nrebuilt - conflict not affected\n\nrelocated - conflict affected\n\nrelocated - conflict not affected\n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using IPS-TS 2006 data. \n\n \n\n \n\n14\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\n \nKey  reasons  cited  for  the  overall  slow  progress  in  housing  relocation  have  included  a \nlack of commitment by nongovernment organizations (NGOs), impact of the conflict, lack \nof  infrastructure  in  new  locations,  and  poor  communications  strategies.  In  the  case  of \ndonor  housing,  it  has  been  pointed  out  that  many  donors  that  had  large  amounts  of \nfunds at their disposal and had pledged to build large numbers of housing units failed to \nmeet even 50 per cent of their original targets (GOSL, 2006).  \n\nThese  findings  are  consistent  with  the  survey  results:  lack  of  land  and  delays  in \nobtaining donor assistance were cited as the main reasons for the slow progress in the \ndonor-driven housing programme. The survey results also suggested that some people \nfound  that  they  were  worse-off  in  terms  of  quality  of  housing  and  access  to  services \n(Table 10). There were claims that people\u2019s lifestyles were not taken into consideration \nwhen  designing  the  new  houses.  For  instance,  the  percentage  of  households  using \nexpensive sources of fuel for cooking such as gas and electricity increased from 10 per \ncent to 18 per cent, primarily because many of the new houses did not include a kitchen \nwith a chimney to allow use of firewood for cooking.   \n\nTable 10: Quality of Housing Before and After Tsunami for Relocated Households \n\n \nHouse design \nConstruction materials \nused for housing \nAccess to services \n(water, electricity, road) \nPrimary school within 1 \nkm \nClinic within 1 km \n\nNo. \n69 \n\n69 \n\n69 \n\n73 \n\n73 \n\nBetter Now  Worse Now  No Difference \n41% \n\n42% \n\n14% \n\n27% \n\n14% \n\n10% \n\n1% \n\n49% \n\n63% \n\n62% \n\n59% \n\n21% \n\n20% \n\n29% \n\n40% \n\nto  consider  converting  donor-driven  housing  projects \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using IPS-TS 2005 and 2006 data. \n \nThe  relatively  smooth  progress  of  the  homeowner-driven  housing  programme  vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe relocation programme has encouraged the Reconstruction and Development Agency \n(RADA) \nto  owner-driven \nprogrammes.  Owner-driven  housing  programmes  were  reportedly  more  effective \nbecause  families  got  the  funds  directly  into  their  own  hands.15   Owner-driven  housing \nprojects  not  only  progressed  faster  but  also  proved  to  be  cheaper  than  donor-driven \nprojects.  The  cost  of  a  single  donor-assisted  housing  unit  was  estimated  to  range \nbetween  SLRs.0.4\u20131.6  million  (US$4,000\u201316,000)  even  without  the  additional  costs  of \nsite preparation, land-filling, drainage, and infrastructure provision (GOSL, 2006). \n\nConsidering these factors, RADA urged the international NGOs (INGOs) to transfer their \ntsunami reconstruction funds to the Treasury so that the government could direct funds \nto  the  victims.  Additional  funding  of  around  US$50  million  was  needed  to  shift  house \nconstruction previously under donor-driven programmes into owner-driven programmes \n(MFP,  2006).  RADA  argued  that  this  would  be  the  most  practical  way  of  resolving  the \nlogistical  problems  that  INGOs  faced  in  constructing  houses  themselves.  Many  donors \nhad concerns about allowing the government to choose beneficiaries. To address those \nconcerns and to ensure transparency, it was proposed that donors who opted to convert \n\n                                                 \n15 Daily Mirror, 28 January 2006. \n\n \n\n15\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nto the owner-driven programme could be given a list of beneficiaries, so that they could \nverify their needs and make payments directly to those families. However, with the sole \nexception of the Red Cross (which had complied with the request to cooperate with the \ngovernment and converted two-thirds of their pledges (US$25 million)), INGOs showed \nno enthusiasm to transfer funds to the government.16 \n\nEscalating  costs  of  building  materials  and  skilled  construction  labour  may  also  have \ncontributed to slow progress in housing.  All interviewed key informants reported that the \ncost of building materials and the wages of carpenters and masons had increased since \nthe tsunami, with more than three-quarters stating that construction costs had increased \nby \u201ca lot.\u201d  \n\n5.1.3 Livelihoods \n\nAn estimated 150,000 people lost their main source of income because of the tsunami.17 \nAbout  50  per  cent  of  these  were  in  the  fisheries  sector,  with  others  distributed  among \nagriculture  (4\u20135  per  cent),  tourism,  and  small  and  micro  enterprise-related  sectors \n(GOSL, 2005a). In all surveyed districts, people received some livelihood support. Types \nof livelihood assistance have included grants in kind (income-generating assets such as \nfishing boats and equipment), cash grants, loans, training (vocational, business support, \netc.), cash-for-work, and temporary employment.  \n\nAccording  to  official  sources,  around  75  per  cent  of  the  affected  families  had  regained \ntheir  main  source  of  income  by  end  2005  (GOSL,  2005a).  This  is  supported  by  the \nsurvey results where 71 per cent of interviewed households claimed they had regained \ntheir previous source of livelihood. Only 8 per cent of heads of households had changed \ntheir  livelihood,18 while  21  per  cent  were  still  unemployed.19 Thus,  within  a  year  of  the \ntsunami,  most  people  were  back  in  their  previous  occupations.  However,  this  did  not \nmean that people regained their previous level of income. According to our household-\nlevel survey, on average close to 60 per cent of households considered their real family \nincome\u2014in  terms  of  their  ability  to  cover  basic  needs  such  as  food  and  health\u2014to  be \nlower than their pre-tsunami income.  \n\nThere were regional variations in income recovery patterns. Compared to the Southern \nProvince, a higher proportion of Eastern Province households felt that they were worse-\noff.20 According to the survey data\u2014in both the Southern and Eastern provinces\u2014poor \ndistribution  of  livelihood-related  assets,  the  buffer  zone  rule,  and  damages  to  work \nplaces  have  affected  livelihood  recovery.  In  addition  to  these,  inability  to  participate  in \nemployment training (due to security reasons) has also slowed down livelihood recovery \nin the Eastern Province.  \n                                                 \n16 Sunday Observer, 27 August 2006. \n17 RADA estimates place those who have lost livelihoods at 200,000 with a further 125,000 jobs \nbeing lost indirectly (see www.rada.gov.lk).   \n18 About a half of the household heads that have changed their livelihoods come from one GND, \nin the Eastern Province.   \n19  Further,  the  current  housing  situation  does  not  appear  to  have  any  effect  on  livelihood \nrecovery. \n20 Key informants in almost all surveyed districts in the Southern Province, and in around half of \nthe surveyed districts in the Eastern Province, thought people are better-off now because of aid, \ntraining, and more employment opportunities. There were also considerable differences between \nclusters of villages.  \n \n\n \n\n16\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nThe damage to tourism infrastructure was quite significant and affected tourism-related \nlivelihoods.  A  total  of  53  (out  of  242)  large  hotels  and  a  further  248  small  hotels  were \ndamaged  or  destroyed.  In  terms  of  hotel  rooms,  about  3,500  out  of  a  total  of  13,000 \nrooms  available  in  medium  to  large-scale  hotels  were  out  of  service  in  February  2005. \nApproximately  210  small  enterprises  that  rely  on  the  tourism  industry  were  also \ndestroyed along the coastline. They were mostly enterprises engaged in informal sector \nactivities, and 190 of them were not formally registered with the tourist board. Of the 53 \nlarge-scale hotels damaged, 41 were back in operation by end 2005.  \n\nDespite the gradual restoration of infrastructure damage to tourist facilities, recovery in \nlivelihoods  in  the  sector  was  slow.  Sri  Lanka  saw  the  largest  ever  number  of  tourist \narrivals  in  2004  and  although  recorded  \u201ctourist\u201d  arrival  numbers  did  not  fall  steeply  in \n2005, many of those counted as tourists were aid workers visiting the country rather than \ngenuine tourists. Tourism earnings, in fact, dropped sharply in 2005 (see Table 3). This \nsuggests  that  many  potential  tourists  were  discounting  Sri  Lanka  as  a  desirable  travel \ndestination in the aftermath of the tsunami. Recovery in tourism was further constrained \nby  an  escalation  in  ethnic  conflict-related  incidents  from  the  end  of  2005  that  deterred \nthe return of tourists in numbers comparable to pre-tsunami levels. Thus, while damage \nto  infrastructure  was  relevant,  it  was  the  negative  psychological  impact  of  the  tsunami \nand the subsequent political conflicts that seem to have played a more significant role in \nhampering recovery in the tourist sector.  \n\nBy contrast, recovery of fisheries-related livelihoods was swifter despite the fact that this \nwas the most badly affected sector. Those engaged in fishing or related activities made \nup  over  one-third  of  the  affected  households.  In  total,  over  100,000  people  in  the \nfisheries  sector  were  displaced,  16,434  houses  were  damaged  and  13,329  destroyed, \nand  nearly  4,870  fishermen  lost  their  lives  with  a  further  136  reported  missing  (MFAR, \n2006).  In  terms  of  equipment,  as  set  out  in  Table  11  an  estimated  75  per  cent  of  the \nfishing fleet (32,000 boats) had been totally destroyed or severely damaged (around 23 \nper  cent  were  made  un-seaworthy  and  54  per  cent  were  destroyed),  and  one  million \nfishing nets were lost. Apart from these, the basic infrastructure of the fishing industry, \nsuch as boatyards, cold rooms, ice plants, and fish markets, were damaged. Damage to \nfishery  harbours  and  other  infrastructure  facilities,  government  services  facilities,  coast \nconservation  structures,  etc.,  was  placed  at  US$275  million,  while  repair  and \nreplacement costs for the damaged fleet were estimated at US$60 million. \n\nBy end 2006, the fisheries harvest had been restored to 70 per cent of the pre-tsunami \nlevel  with  most  of  the  affected  fishers  returning  to  their  occupation  (GOSL,  2006)  The \nrelatively rapid recovery of the fisheries sector can be attributed primarily to the relatively \nrapid progress in replacement of the fishing boats and equipment. The fisheries sector \nreceived more immediate assistance than other affected sectors and was able to replace \nmost  of  its  productive  assets  fairly  quickly.  A  large  proportion  of  destroyed  boats  had \nbeen replaced, and all damaged boats were repaired by end 2005.21 \n\n                                                 \n21 There is some debate about the exact numbers of boats damaged and repaired. For most boat \ntypes,  the  number  of  crafts  repaired  has  exceeded  the  numbers  reported  as  damaged.  It  has \nbeen suggested that boat owners in non-tsunami-affected areas may have transferred their boats \nto  these  areas  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  get  minor  repairs  done,  that  there  may \nhave been mis-categorisation of beach seine crafts as traditional crafts, and that boats classified \nas destroyed may have been repaired and put back to sea. \n\n \n\n17\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 11: Fishing Boats Destroyed and Damaged \n\nReplaced \n\nDamaged \n\nDestroyed \n\nNo. \n676 \n783 \n3,211 \n2,435 \n161 \n7,266 \n\n2004 \nFleet \n1,581 \n1,493 \n11,559 \n15,934 \n1,052 \n31,619 \n\nRepaired \n780 \n904 \n4,258 \n3,479 \n134 \n9,555 \n\n \n \nBoat Type \nMulti-day \nOne day boats \nFRP boats \nTraditional crafts \nBeach seine crafts \nTotal \nNote: FRP=fiberglass reinforced plastic  \nSource: MFAR (2006).  \n \nHowever,  there  have  been  complaints  about  the  poor  quality  of  repairs.  According  to \nresults of a survey carried out in December 2005, 8 per cent of the repaired boats were \nnot  being  used  due  to  dissatisfaction  with  the  repairs. 22 Inadequate  technical  inputs \nand/or supervision, lack of boat-building knowledge and expertise on the part of NGOs \n(as well as the fishers), and the absence of proper contracts for after-sales services are \nblamed  for  poor-quality  repairs,  with  boat-builders  using  low-quality  material,  reducing \nthe thickness, etc., to meet deadlines and profit from the opportunity.  \n\nNo. \n187 \n276 \n4,480 \n11,158 \n818 \n16,919 \n\n0 \n29 \n4,321 \n8,636 \n204 \n13,190 \n\nBy  end  2005,  78  per  cent  of  the  destroyed  fishing  fleet  had  been  replaced  (this  figure \nhad  risen  to  95  per  cent  by  mid-2006)23 with  pledges  for  more  than  6,000  boats  still \noutstanding. But 19 per cent of the new boats provided were found not to be seaworthy. \nLack  of  coordination  in  distribution  efforts  also  led  to  conflicts  and  problems  over  the \nincreasing numbers of boats, the quality of boats, etc. For many NGOs, the provision of \nsmall  fishing  boats  was  seen  as  an  \u201cattractive\u201d  tsunami  aid  programme  that  had  high \nvisibility but was easy to implement and not too expensive.  \n\nThe result of this focus on providing small fishing boats, however, may be an oversupply \nof  boats.  Such  an  oversupply  is  likely  to  be  unhealthy  for  the  fisheries  sector  in  the \nlonger  term  due  to  the  prospect  of  over-fishing.  The  oversupply  can  be  attributed  to \nseveral factors. There was no reliable data on the fishing fleet prior to the tsunami, and \nthe  damage  assessments  done  by  a  large  number  of  agencies  had  their  weaknesses. \nSometimes,  people  who  were  not  familiar  with  the  community  of  fishers  were \nresponsible  for  gathering  data  on  previous  boat  ownership;  this  permitted  many  non-\nfishers to acquire boats. Misidentifications and overlaps occurred as a result of delays in \nissuing  Entitlement  Cards  by  MFAR.  Also,  the  same  beneficiary  list  was  sometimes \nprovided to more than one NGO to speed up the recovery process. There was a lack of \ncoordination between the fisheries authorities and the NGOs, poor coordination between \nNGOs  themselves,  and  competition  amongst  these  agencies  which  led  to  errors  and \nmiscalculations  (MFAR,  2006).  Anecdotal  evidence \nfrom  district-level  authorities \nindicated that reluctance to share information on the part of some NGOs made the task \nof coordinating even more difficult.  \n\nMany  genuine  beneficiaries  did  not  receive  new  boats  because  allocations  were  not \nproperly  targeted.  Based  on  extrapolations  from  the  findings  of  a  survey  done  by  the \nauthorities  in  December  2005,  only  6,067  of  the  13,190  (46  per  cent)  boats  distributed \n\n                                                 \n22 Cited in MFAR (2006). \n23 RADA (2006). \n\n \n\n18\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nwent  to  \u201cgenuine\u201d  beneficiaries.  Some  small,  local  agencies  had  provided  boats  to \n\u201cfriends and relatives\u201d and had bypassed the fishing authorities.24 \n\ninformal,  small-scale \n\nAccess to credit is a vital element for  livelihood  recovery.  Most  of  the tsunami-affected \nindustries\u2014an  estimated  25,000  micro-\nbusinesses  were \nenterprises  were  damaged  in  the  disaster.  In  addition,  15,000  tsunami  survivors  were \npreviously  involved  in  self-employed  and  informal  sector  activities  such  as  food \nprocessing,  coir  manufacture,  carpentry,  and  tailoring.  While  over  forty  organizations \nwere  involved  in  a  host  of  micro-finance  programmes  established  to  assist  small-  and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  the  primary  sources  of  credit  were  two  major \ngovernment finance schemes.  \n\nPrior  to  the  tsunami,  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  had  been  implementing  a  micro-\nfinance  scheme  (Susahana)  through  the  two  state-owned  commercial  banks.  The \nSusahana loan is provided with no repayment required for the first year and interest at a \nfixed  rate  of  6  per  cent  thereafter.  The  National  Development  Trust  Fund  (NDTF)  also \noffered  similar  terms  through  its  partner  organizations.  Following  the  tsunami,  lending \nescalated  and  by  June  2006,  25,735  loans  and  grants  of  SLRs.4,769  million  (US$47 \nmillion)  had  been  provided  to  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (RADA, \n2006). The majority of these loans were disbursed in the south and west of the country. \nThe  Susahana  scheme  had  reportedly  disbursed  US$36  million  to  8,000  borrowers  in \nthe tsunami-affected areas by September 2005. Of these loans, 75 per cent were in the \nsouth and west of the country. 60 per cent of the NDTF scheme was also disbursed in \nthe  south,  with  only  40  per  cent  going  to  the  north  and  east  of  the  country  (GOSL, \n2005a).   \n\nUnfortunately,  the  procedures  and  processes  associated  with  loan  approval  and \ndisbursement  seemed  weighted  against  those  worst-affected  by  the  tsunami,  with  the \nemphasis placed on ensuring high probability of repayment or loan recovery rather than \non meeting the credit needs of those most in need. Despite claims to the contrary, and \nits stated intention to reach the micro-entrepreneurs, the Susahana lending scheme had \nbeen  set  up  in  a  way  that  made  it  very  difficult  for  small  tsunami-affected  micro-\nentrepreneurs  to  obtain  access  to  the  loans.  The  conditions  for  access  were  quite \nonerous.  Guarantors  with  a  permanent  income  above  a  certain  threshold  level  were \nrequired before a loan was approved. Collateral was required, for which land within the \nbuffer zone was not acceptable. Loans were only to be given to businesses registered \nbefore  the  tsunami,  which  ruled  out  many  smaller,  unregistered  businesses.  These \nconditions  ruled  out,  in  most  cases,  people  hoping  to  take  up  new  livelihoods  in \nresponse  to  their  changed  post-tsunami  circumstances,  from  causes  such  as,  for \nexample, the death of the main earner, disability, or new responsibilities for the care of \nfamily members.  \n\nIn fact, it has been acknowledged that the many affected businesses in the buffer zone \nwere hit especially hard because they were unable to access bank credit, and that banks \nhave  been  reluctant  to  relax  their  collateral  requirements  (GOSL,  2005a).  It  was  also \nfound  that  very  few  new  clients  were  reached  by  the  subsidized  schemes  and  a \n\n                                                 \n24 The efficiency implications of the misallocation of these fishery assets may be corrected over \ntime as those who were mistakenly given boats etc. may subsequently sell them to genuine fisher \nfolks who can make use of them. But this would not be much consolation for people who had lost \nassets and lack the necessary finances to buy them, even at discount prices.  \n\n \n\n19\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nconsiderable  number  of  small  entrepreneurs  were  left  with  no  access  to  credit.  The \nsurvey results confirm these findings: Only a few households (16 per cent of the sample) \neven applied for credit. Many households did not apply for loans because they were not \naware that they were eligible to receive them, or because they felt that their applications \nwould be rejected. Most of those who applied did receive a loan, but they had to provide \ncollateral and sometimes a guarantor in order to obtain it. The average size of the loan \nwas fairly small at less than SLRs.100,000 (US$1,000).  \n\nOn  a  positive  note,  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  micro-credit  providers  improved \ncooperation and coordination in an attempt to try to maintain the micro credit culture that \nthe  post-tsunami  supply  of  micro-credit  funds  at  low  interest  rates  was  in  danger  of \nundermining. \n\nIn  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  tsunami,  a  cash  grant  livelihood  assistance \nprogramme  was  announced  in  January  2005,  offering  a  monthly  cash  grant  of \nSLRs.5,000  (US$50)  to  each  tsunami-affected  household  for  a  period  of  four  months. \nOver  250,000  households  received  the  first  two  instalments  on  time  immediately \nfollowing the introduction of the programme.25 However, concerns were soon expressed \nin some quarters about the need for proper targeting. The Ministry of Finance Directives \nthen  directed  local  government  officials  to  revise  the  lists  of  eligible  beneficiaries \naccording to a set of eligibility criteria. There were complaints from both affected families \nand even some government officials that the criteria were not very clear, or were not in \nthe public domain. This created much confusion and payments halted at a time of acute \nneed.  The  government  circulars  announcing  the  revised  criteria  were  quite  broad.  This \nmeant  that  local  government  officers  had  considerable  room  to  exercise  discretion, \nresulting  in  wide  variations  in  interpretation,  allegations  of  corruption,  and  delays  and \nlong back-logs of appeals. Interviews with relevant stakeholders, including both affected \nfamilies and government officials, suggested that households having access to \u201cregular \nincome\u201d  were  no  longer  eligible.  It  took  several  months  to  draw  up  new  lists  of  those \neligible to receive the grant, with the number of recipients eligible for the third payment \ndeclining by 25 per cent to 165,000 while the fourth monthly payment was still \u201con-going\u201d \na year after the tsunami (GOSL, 2005a).  \n\nIn  assessing  the  value  and  benefits  of  changes  to  this  programme,  it  should  be  noted \nthat even households with a \u201cregular\u201d post-tsunami income had suffered a major loss of \nwealth  in  terms  of  property  and  possessions,  and  were  cash  poor.  There  was  a  high \nprobability that they would have to borrow from high interest, informal sector lenders to \nmeet many pressing needs. The decision to take recipients with a regular income off the \nlist  after  only  two  monthly  payments  generated  perverse  incentives,  effectively \npenalizing  not  only  those  who  had  held  on  to  previous  jobs,  but  perhaps,  even  more \nimportantly, those who had managed to obtain regular employment after the tsunami. If \ndonor  assistance  was  available  for  this  programme\u2014and  it  is  hard  to  see  why  funds \nwere not available if the May 2005 pledges were honoured\u2014these cutbacks seem hard \nto justify. Moreover, since bank accounts had to be opened for the cash grant transfer, \nthe system was extremely cost effective\u2014many other tsunami livelihood projects had far \n\n                                                 \n25  This  had  some  other  cash  grant  components  too,  including  a  grant  for  a  family  death. \nAccording  to  the  IPS-TS  2005  data  (collected  in  April/May  2005),  all  surveyed  districts  had \nreceived funds of SLRs.15,000 for deaths, SLRs.2500 for kitchen equipment, and a SLRs.5000 \nlivelihood grant and food/cash coupon.    \n\n \n\n20\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nhigher  transactions  costs  with  as  much  as  30  per  cent  spent  on  administrative \noverheads.    \n\nThis  experience  with  trying  to  shift  the  livelihoods  grants  programme  to  a  targeting \nscheme  only  a  couple  of  months  after  the  disaster  holds  lessons  of  much  wider \napplicability  for  post-disaster  situations.  By  all  accounts,  the  initial  grants  scheme  was \nvery effective in reaching most of the affected population. It provided cash at a time of \ngreat  need,  and  even  helped  to  link  people  with  little  prior  engagement  to  the  formal \nfinancial sector because they had to set up bank deposit accounts to receive the funds. \nUnfortunately, the scheme only provided two timely grants before the emphasis shifted \nto targeting. In theory, it seems obvious that grants should be distributed to those who \nare \u201ctruly needy,\u201d and therefore that grants should be properly targeted. But, in practice, \nthe  costs  of  such  narrow  targeting  must  also  be  taken  into  account.  In  the  immediate \naftermath of a major disaster, particularly in a poor country, the vast majority of affected \npeople  are  \u201ctruly  needy.\u201d  Markets  are  dislocated,  assets  have  been  destroyed,  and \nrecords are destroyed or missing. In such circumstances, the cost of trying to exclude a \nrelatively  small  proportion  of  people  from  the  small  temporary  grants  scheme  through \ntargeting can far exceed any benefits.  \n\nIn Sri Lanka\u2019s case, grants were delayed for all recipients, including those in dire need; \nadministrative  resources  were  diverted  away  from  the  urgent  tasks  of  recovery  and \nreconstruction,  which  created  room  for  petty  officials  to  engage  in  corruption  and \naggravated  community  divisions  and  tensions.  Any  expected  benefits  from  the  rush  to \nimplement targeting, only two months after tsunami, must be contemplated in the light of \nthe  \u201csuccess\u201d  with  targeting  achieved  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  long-established  national  poverty \nalleviation programme (Samurdhi): the leakage in the Samurdhi programme is estimated \nto be 40 per cent!  \n\n5.1.4 Trauma and Stress \n\nThe survey found some evidence of mental and physical health problems related to the \ntsunami.  About  11  per  cent  of  the  households  knew  someone  who  had  committed \nsuicide  because  of  the  tsunami.  There  were  reports  of  more  sleeping  difficulties,  and \nchildren  experiencing  nightmares  that  were  linked  to  trauma  associated  with  the \ntsunami. A large number of households\u201433 per cent of households in the sample\u2014had \nbeen  offered  or  given  counselling  for  distress. The  percentage  of  people  who  received \ncounselling  was  higher  in  the  Eastern  Province,  possibly  because  counselling  was \nalready  taking  place  in  those  areas  for  sufferers  of  conflict-related  mental  health \nproblems.   \n\nTwelve per cent of households had family members who had been injured in the tsunami \nor whose health had deteriorated afterwards: A large proportion of such households (77 \nper  cent)  claimed  that  this  affected  their  income-earning  capacity  and/or  day-to-day \nactivities. \n\nIn  many  cases,  the  decline  in  school  attendance  after  the  tsunami  has  not  been  fully \nreversed and attendance was reported to be poor even at the end of 2006, with over 25 \nper  cent  of  children  still  not  attending  school  (GOSL,  2006).  These  findings  are \nsupported by the survey; nearly 30 per cent of households reported having children who \nhad  not  yet  restarted  schooling  after  the  tsunami.  The  schooling  problem  existed  in \nareas other than just those affected by conflict, indicating that the problem cannot solely \n\n \n\n21\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nbe  attributed  to  the  conflict.  Thirty-one  per  cent  of  the  households  reported  that  the \nperformance of children who were attending school had fallen.  \n\n5.2 Assistance \n\nThere was a strong international public response to the appeal for recovery assistance. \nMultilateral  and  bilateral  donors  and  NGOs  pledged  US$3.4  billion  for  post-tsunami \nrecovery  activities  at  the  first  Sri  Lanka  Development  Forum  held  in  May  2005  (MFP, \n2005; GOSL, 2006).26 This comprised (concessional) loans amounting to US$798 million \nand the balance in grants. NGOs pledged a total of US$853 million on a grant basis. The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  pledged  US$268  million  by  way  of  both  emergency  relief \nand a debt moratorium. Bilateral donors extended the debt moratorium providing further \nrelief of US$263 million.  \n\nThe  government  reported  that  around  US$2.2  billion  (of  the  total  pledges  of  US$2.8 \nbillion,  which  excluded  debt  relief)  could  be  considered  as  firm  commitments  from  the \ninternational  community  (GOSL,  2005a).  In  addition,  an  estimated  US$150  million  was \nreportedly received as contributions from domestic sources, without taking into account \nrelief  disbursements  (for  which  figures  are  not  available).  However,  actual  committed \nfunds made available to the government appear to have fallen over time to US$ 2 billion \nfrom the previous \u201cfirmly committed\u201d figure of US$2.2 billion (Table 12). At the end of the \nsecond  year  of  reconstruction,  total  foreign  grant  expenditure  relative  to  commitments \nwas  only  35  per  cent  and  foreign  loan  expenditure  was  40  per  cent.  While  individual \nagencies  varied  in  performance,  the  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  had  spent  on \naverage  29  per  cent  and  32  per  cent  respectively  of  committed  funds  by  end  2006.  In \naddition, although the initial needs assessment was placed at US$2.2 billion and a total \nof US$2.9 billion was secured as committed funds, the funding gap for the reconstruction \nprocess as at end 2006 was estimated at US$247 million (Table 13). \n\nExpenditure \n\nTable 12: Sources of Foreign Assistance and Expenditures (US$ million) \n \nPledges \n378 \n444 \n240 \n31 \n16 \n492 \n339 \n1,940 \n \n1,458 \n1,462 \n \n3,402 \n\n \nInternational NGOs \nInternational organizations \nUnited Nations \nNational NGOs \nPrivate sector \nBilaterals \nMultilaterals/IFIs \nTotal foreign grants \n \nTotal foreign loans \nGovernment funding \n \nGrand total \n\nCommitments \n272 \n319 \n109 \n22 \n16 \n912 \n396 \n2,046 \n \n940 \n944 \n \n2,990 \n\n171 \n76 \n65 \n9 \n7 \n261 \n125 \n714 \n \n377 \n381 \n \n1,095 \n\nNote: IFI=international financial institution \nSource: GOSL (2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n26 The US$3.4 billion includes debt relief/moratorium and IMF support. \n\n22\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nThis  low  rate  of  expenditure  (absorption  of  available  assistance)  is  not  surprising  and \nhighlights the constraints that hinder rapid reconstruction. Sri Lanka\u2019s past performance \nin aid absorption has been poor: The rate of aid utilization in recent years has been only \naround 20\u201322 per cent, having improved from around 13\u201315 per cent towards the end of \nthe 1990s. Many reasons have been cited for such low levels of aid utilization, including \npolitical  interference  with  regard  to  planning,  implementation  and  allocation  of  funds; \nstaffing and related problems in project  management; implementation delays (including \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, complex and costly procurement procedures), and excessive \nconditionality imposed by donors. Another important factor has been the non-availability \nof adequate counterpart funds (local funds with appropriation).  \n\nTable 13: Sector Allocation Overview (US$ million) \n\n \nHousing \nLivelihood \nSocial service \nInfrastructure \nOther \nTotal \n\nFunding Gap \n107 \n20 \n85 \n35 \n \n247 \n\nSource: GOSL (2006). \n\nCommitments \n486 \n416 \n393 \n861 \n833 \n2,990 \n\nExpenditure \n162 \n186 \n137 \n134 \n476 \n1,095 \n\n \nDespite  the  initial  euphoria  in  the  aftermath  of  the  tsunami  about  the  volume  and \nadequacy of foreign assistance, it became clear over time that a substantial proportion of \nreconstruction  would  have  to  be  domestically  financed.  In  2006,  the  government  had \ncommitted US$1.5 billion in domestic funds (over one-third of total reconstruction costs \nas  initially  estimated)  for  tsunami  reconstruction.  Thus,  at  the  end  of  two  years,  two \nproblems with the funding of the reconstruction effort could be identified: the inability of \nthe country to utilise available foreign assistance in a timely manner, and a widening gap \nbetween \nforeign  assistance  received  and  reconstruction \nrequirements.  \n\nthe  actual  amount  of \n\n5.3 Delivery and Coordination of Assistance \n\nCoordination  of  the  relief  and  reconstruction  effort  emerged  as  a  key  issue  from  the \nbeginning of the relief effort, and it continued to be a major issue as the reconstruction \nand  recovery  phase  started.  In  Sri  Lanka,  coordination  was  required  across  three \ngroups: (a) among the various government agencies, (b) between the numerous donor \nagencies,  and  (c)  with  the  LTTE  which  was  in  de  facto  control  of  a  part  of  the  country \nthat was heavily affected by the tsunami. Sri Lanka\u2019s governance structure is such that \nprovincial  government  agencies  have  considerable  powers,  and  this  meant  that \ncoordination  was  required  not  only  between  the  various  central  government  agencies, \nbut  also  between  the  central  government  and  local  government  agencies.  The \ninvolvement  of  major  bilateral  and  multilateral  donor  agencies  naturally  required  that \ntheir  activities  be  coordinated,  both  among  themselves  and  with  the  government.  Sri \nLanka  has  long  experience  working  with  major  donor  agencies  and  several  INGOs \nmaintain  long  established  operations  in  the  country.  There  had  been  some  welcome \nmoves  towards  donor  coordination  even  prior  to  the  tsunami  in  the  context  of  conflict-\nrelated  donor  reconstruction  programmes.  Thus,  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  JBIC  had \nalready  established  a  partnership  that  enabled  a  needs  assessment  to  be  done \nimmediately  after  the  tsunami.  However,  coordination  with  donor  agencies  and  NGOs \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nbecame  a  vastly  more  complicated  issue  due  to  the  numbers  and  practices  of  the \nnumerous  international  NGOs  (not  counting  large  numbers  of  individuals  and  small \ngroups) who came in after the tsunami. Before long, some 180 NGOs were operating in \nthe  tsunami-affected  regions  of  Sri  Lanka,  making  coordination  a  difficult  and  complex \ntask.  In  addition,  establishing  effective  coordination  with  the  LTTE  raised  difficult  and \nsensitive political and constitutional issues.  \n\nAs  mentioned  previously,  the  government  initially  set  up  a  Centre  for  National \nOperations  (CNO)  and  three  task  forces  to  address  the  coordination  challenge. \nSubsequently,  the  Task  Force  for  Rebuilding  the  Nation  (TAFREN)  became  the  lead \nagency  charged  with  the  task  of  overseeing  the  recovery  and  reconstruction  phase.27 \nWhile  an  overarching  authority  such  as  TAFREN  was  clearly  necessary  to  coordinate \npost-disaster reconstruction, the structure and composition of TAFREN was such that it \nwas not able to be fully effective in that role. TAFREN was dominated by private sector \nrepresentatives,  and  lacked  links  to  line  ministries  and  clear  lines  of  authority.  This \ngreatly  hampered  its  ability  to  efficiently  coordinate  activities  among  government \nagencies. Reconstruction activities had been divided into sectors, such as housing and \nwater and sanitation. This meant that coordination across several agencies, often falling \nunder different ministries, was needed to implement even relatively minor reconstruction \nactivities.  For  example,  three  different  agencies  had  to  be  brought  together  to  ensure \nthat  new  housing  units  could  get  access  to  water,  sanitation,  and  electricity  supplies. \nThough TAFREN attempted to monitor the line agencies and to play a coordinating role \nas  a  \u201cone-stop-shop,\u201d  its  effectiveness  was  limited  because  its  role  and  authority \nremained unclear.  \n\nIn  November  2005,  a  decision  was  taken  to  amalgamate  TAFREN,  TAFOR,  and  the \nTask  Force  for  Logistics  and  Law  and  Order  (TAFLOL)  into  the  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment Authority (RADA). RADA was given wide powers by an Act of Parliament. \nIt  was  given  authority  over  organizations  working  on  post-tsunami  reconstruction  and \ndevelopment,  and  could  monitor  and  control  their  activities  as  well  as  issue  \u201clicenses\u201d \nthat would provide legal authority for them to carry out specific activities. In theory, this \nwould enable RADA to exercise efficient coordination. However, potential drawbacks to \nthe vesting of such wide powers in a single, centralised body are that it could overly limit \nthe  powers  of  all  other  agencies  and  actors,  ignore  inputs  and  feedback  from  line \nministries  and  local-level  agents,  reduce  flexibility  and  scope  for  local  initiatives  and \nactions, and make the reconstruction effort too centrally-driven.  \n\nField observations confirmed that lack of adequate coordination resulted in considerable \nmal-distribution  of  aid.  This  was  clearly  visible,  for  example,  in  the  way  that  the \ndistribution  of  new  boats  had  been  conducted,  and\u2014as  described  in  a  report  by  the \nAuditor  General\u2014in  payment  of  housing  assistance.28 Large  payments  were  made  for \nhouses with minor or no damage, NGOs provided houses to families who were not at all \n                                                 \n27 After  one  month,  with  the  conclusion  of  immediate  relief  operations  TAFRER  and  TAFLOL \nwere amalgamated to a single entity\u2014the Task Force for Relief (TAFOR)\u2014to implement all relief \nmeasures,  and  the  operations  of  the  CNO  were  scaled  down.  In  February,  the  CNO  was \ndissolved  and  officials  returned  to  line  ministries.  TAFOR  and  TAFREN  took  over  the \nresponsibilities of the CNO. With the completion of transitional housing, TAFOR was expected to \nwind down operations and its responsibilities passed to the line ministries. \n28 This report on the tsunami rehabilitation covers the period 26 December 2004 to 30 June 2005. \nSee GOSL (2005b). \n \n\n \n\n24\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\naffected by the tsunami, and government grants were given to people who had already \nreceived houses constructed by NGOs.  \n\nThe  lack  of  adequate  coordination  was  not  only  due  to  weaknesses  on  the  part  of  the \ngovernment-established  coordinating  bodies.  A  major  problem  was  that  some  NGOs \nwere  simply  not  willing  to  be  \u201ccoordinated,\u201d  preferring  to  act  alone  pursuing  their  own \nagendas. INGOs, as well as some domestic NGOs (particularly those with good foreign \nlinks),  had  access  to  relatively  large  amounts  of  money.  With  their  own  funds  secure, \nthey  saw  few  incentives  to  improve  coordination.  In  fact,  some  were  openly  hostile  to \nany government action that seemed to place \u201ccontrols\u201d on their independence.  \n\nFurther,  the  presence  of  large  numbers  of  donors/NGOs  at  times  led  to  competitive \nbehaviour.  In  several  places  deep  mistrust  developed  between  local  NGOs  (who  have \noften been working in the local area for many years) and some INGOs and other foreign \nagencies  who  came  to  distribute  tsunami  assistance.  Local  NGOs  claim  to  have  been \n\u201ccrowded out\u201d by some of the better financially endowed larger INGOs, who \u201cpoached\u201d \nstaff  and  resources.  INGOs  varied  widely  in  experience,  skills,  and  operating  styles. \nMany \u201cnew\u201d INGOs lacked experience and local knowledge, and in their haste to spend \nfunds  and  disburse  goods  and  equipment  often  disregarded  local  circumstances  and \ncommunity needs. Certainly some INGOs and agencies had valuable expertise in large-\nscale disaster relief (such as provision of transitional shelters and other relief measures), \nbut  domestic  NGOs  (and  INGOs  that  have  operated  in  Sri  Lanka  for  a  long  period) \nusually  have  a  much  greater  appreciation  of  local  conditions  and  sensitivities.  Greater \ninteraction,  engagement  and  coordination  between  them  would  have  clearly  benefited \nthe  overall  relief  and  reconstruction  effort.  New  mechanisms  have  since  been  put  in \nplace  to  improve  coordination  of  donor  activities  at  regional  and  local  levels  through \nregular meetings and consultations held by regional administrative officers. However, it \nis too early to judge their effectiveness.  \n\nThe  problems  caused  by  some  INGOS  should  not,  however,  be  seen  as  typical  of  all \nINGOs. In fact, in many cases INGOs played a very positive role. About 44 per cent of \nthe households surveyed felt that INGOs were more effective in delivering aid, while only \n11 per cent felt that the local NGOs were more effective.  \n\nCoordination with the LTTE proved to be the most difficult and contentious issue. While \ndiscussions  to  establish  a  mechanism  for  aid-sharing  began  soon  after  the  tsunami,  a \nmutually  acceptable  arrangement  for  aid-sharing  to  enable  assistance  to  flow  into  the \nLTTE-controlled  areas  proved  elusive.  Sections  within  the  government  and  within  the \nmajority  community  were  opposed  to  any  deal  that  even  appeared  to  provide  de  facto \nrecognition  of  the  LTTE  as  the  administrative  power  in  regions  controlled  by  it.  The \nLTTE, for its part, was unwilling to accept an arrangement that diluted its administrative \nand political power in areas under its control. After long, drawn-out negotiations, a MOU \nsetting  out  an  aid-sharing  deal  between  the  GOSL  and  the  LTTE,  the  Post-Tsunami \nOperation  Management  Structure  (P-TOMS),  was  signed  in  June  2005.  The  P-TOMS \nagreement  envisaged  the  setting  up  of  a  Regional  Fund  to  allow  donors  to  channel \ntsunami  funds  directly  to  the  Northern  and  Eastern  Provinces.  A  multilateral  agency \n(anticipated to be the World Bank) was to be appointed as the custodian.  \n\nHowever, this agreement promptly ran into political opposition. It was challenged in the \ncourts through a fundamental rights petition and the Supreme Court ruled in July 2005 \n\n \n\n25\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nthat  certain  elements  were  to  be  put  on  hold  pending  clarification,29 though  the  overall \nmechanism  was  not  unconstitutional.  The  situation  was  aggravated  further  by  the  fact \nthat  several  major  donors  who  had  supported  the  idea  of  a  joint  mechanism  for  aid \ndistribution  between  the  GOSL  and  the  LTTE  declined  to  channel  aid  directly  to  the \nRegional Fund once the MOU was signed, claiming that the LTTE remains a \u201cproscribed \nterrorist organization\u201d in their countries. After the presidential election in November 2005, \nwith  the  election  of  a  new  President  who  publicly  opposed  the  agreement,  P-TOMS \nbecame  totally  inoperative.  The  conflict  between  the  GOSL  and  the  LTTE  intensified \nsoon  after.  The  renewed  violence  disrupted  not  only  the  lives  of  the  tsunami-affected \npeople  in  the  area,  but  also  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in  internally  displaced  persons, \nplacing further pressure on aid agencies. There can be little doubt that these problems \nled  to  inequitable  distribution  of  aid,  with  the  most  severely  affected  North  and  East \nmissing out on their fair share. \n\nWhile  these  political  factors  affected  the  distribution  of  aid  across  regions,  there  has \nbeen no strong evidence of widespread corruption or political influence in the distribution \nof aid within the provinces. Though some petty corruption appears to have affected the \ndistribution  of  cash  grants  once  targeting  was  introduced,  the  overall  aid  distribution \nappears  to  have  been  reasonably  free  of  overt  political  interference  and  corrupt \npractices.  According  to  the  household  survey  respondents,  very  few  households  had \npaid bribes to government or NGO officials to receive aid, and very few were aware of \ninstances where politicians had interfered directly. \n\n5.4 Cost Escalation \n\nAs mentioned, at the time of the May 2005 meeting of the Sri Lanka Development Forum, \nthe  aid  promises  of  the  international  community  seemed  to  more  than  cover  all \nreconstruction  financing  needs.  Unfortunately,  there  was  a  fundamental  flaw  in  the \nestimates:  They  were  based  on  costs  and  prices  that  prevailed  immediately  after  the \ntsunami  disaster,  adjusted  for  some  expected  national-level  inflation.  These  estimates \nhave proven to be gross underestimates; clear evidence soon emerged that construction \ncosts  were  rising  rapidly  over  time.  This  was,  of  course,  not  surprising.  The  scale  of \nconstruction that was envisaged was several times larger than that undertaken in a normal \nperiod,  and  naturally  implied  sharp  increases  in  demand  for  construction  labour  and \nmaterials.30 \n\nTotal construction costs for the planned houses for tsunami-affected families had already \nrisen  by  30\u201350  per  cent  by  August  2005,  according  to  data  obtained  from  companies \nand  organizations  involved  in  house  building  and  from  field  interviews  (Table  14).  By \nSeptember 2006, costs had exceeded initial estimates by 60\u201380 per cent or more. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n29 Specifically, these elements were the Regional Fund and the location of the regional committee \nin the rebel-held Kilinochchi city. \n30 There were varying estimates of the extra demand for house construction, but they all pointed \nto a massive increase in demand for scarce construction labour and materials. According to the \nChamber  of  Construction  Industry,  as  reported  in  the  Daily  Mirror,  21  February  2005,  it  was \nestimated  that  at  least  100,000  additional  workers  would  be  required,  including  about  13,000 \nmasons, 2,000 carpenters, 2,500 painters, and nearly 54,000 unskilled labourers. \n\n \n\n26\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nTable 14: Cost Escalation in Housing Construction \n\nAugust 2005 \n\nComments \n\nEstimate \n(SLRs.) \n\n1,000,000  Houses with all basic \ninfrastructure facilities \n(electricity, water supply, \nsanitation for each house, \nroads, etc.). \n\n850,000 \n600,000 \n550,000\u2013 \n650,000 \n\nJaffna \nHambantota \nAll other areas (houses \nwith little basic \ninfrastructure) \n\n> 500,000  With basic infrastructure \n\n(with electricity but no \nwater supply) \n700,000  With basic infrastructure \n\nDonor \n\nUnit \nArea \n(sq. \nft.) \nRed Crossa   600  \n\nInitial \nEstimate \n(SLRs.) \n\n625,000  \n(March) \n\nCARE \nInternational \n\n550 \n\n450,000 \n(March) \n\nAitken \nSpence Co. \nLtd.b \nWorld \nVision \nLankac \nCARITAS \nSri Lanka \nSarvodaya \nMovementd \n\n550 \n\n500 \n\n500 \n\n500 \n\n450,000 \n(March) \n\n550,000 \n(March) \n\n500,000 \n(May) \n500,000 \n(May) \n\n650,000 \n\nA basic house (no mention \nof infrastructure) \n\n650,000  With only a few basic \ninfrastructure facilities \n\n600,000 \n700,000 \n\nSeptember 2006 \n\nComments \n\nCost per housing unit with a \ntiled roof, basic infrastructure. \nPrice escalation since last year \nis about 22% due to increase in \nprices of factors like fuel and \nlabour.    \nThis is the average.

The recovery was better \nthan  initially  anticipated,  and  was  broad-based.  There  was  continued  expansion  in \nindustry  and  services,  as  well  as  a  recovery  in  agriculture  following  improved  weather \nconditions, and this good growth performance continued into 2006. \n\nTable 15: GDP Growth Rates (in percent) \n \n2004 \n-0.3 \n1.6 \n5.2 \n6.6 \n7.6 \n13.1 \n5.4 \n\n \nAgriculture \n  Fishing \nIndustry \n  Construction \nServices \n  Hotels & restaurants \nGDP \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Annual Report 2006.  \n\n2005 \n1.9 \n-42.2 \n8.3 \n8.9 \n6.2 \n-27.5 \n6.0 \n\n2006 \n\n4.7 \n51.7 \n7.2 \n8.0 \n8.3 \n6.3 \n7.4 \n\n \n\nThe tsunami reconstruction undoubtedly brightened prospects for Sri Lanka\u2019s short-term \neconomic outlook.

Despite added fiscal pressures, there was little effort \nto curtail spending in other areas, fuelling inflationary pressures from policies unrelated \nto tsunami reconstruction.32 Fiscal profligacy in the face of higher spending on tsunami-\nrelated  rehabilitation  aggravated  inflationary  pressures  in  the  economy.  The  initial \nresponse  to  rising  inflationary  pressure  was  slow,  and  interest  rates  remained \nunchanged allowing credit growth to expand at a rate of over 20 per cent.

Elections \nwere  due  in  late  2005  and  the  government  was  keen  to  keep  inflation  in  check.  This \ngenerated political pressures to resist any exchange rate depreciation which could have \nintensified  domestic  inflation.  There  is  some  evidence  to  suggest  that  the  tsunami-\nrelated capital inflows were used to prop up the nominal exchange rate in 2005, and this \nmay have been a factor in the slow absorption of aid flows. There was also a significant \nincrease in inward remittances from 6.7 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 7.7 per cent by 2006. \nWhile  some  of  the  increase  may  reflect  assistance  provided  to  affected  family  and \nfriends,  the  increase  could  also  reflect  better  earnings  performance  of  the  majority  of \nmigrants employed in the oil rich Middle Eastern countries. Sri Lanka managed to record \nan  overall  surplus  of  US$500  million  on  the  BOP  in  2005  (compared  with  a  deficit  of \nUS$205 million in 2004) and official reserves showed a sharp improvement.  \n\nFigure 5: Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rate \n\n \n\n0\n0\n1\n=\n9\n9\n9\n1\n \nc\ne\nD\n-\nn\na\nJ\n\n115\n110\n105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n65\n60\n55\n\nN\nA\nJ\n\nB\nE\nF\n\nR\nA\nM\n\nR\nP\nA\n\nY\nA\nM\n\nN\nU\nJ\n\nL\nU\nJ\n\nG\nU\nA\n\nP\nE\nS\n\nT\nC\nO\n\nV\nO\nN\n\nC\nE\nD\n\nN\nA\nJ\n\nB\nE\nF\n\nR\nA\nM\n\nR\nP\nA\n\nY\nA\nM\n\nN\nU\nJ\n\nL\nU\nJ\n\nG\nU\nA\n\nP\nE\nS\n\nT\nC\nO\n\nV\nO\nN\n\nC\nE\nD\n\nN\nA\nJ\n\nB\nE\nF\n\nR\nA\nM\n\nR\nP\nA\n\nY\nA\nM\n\nN\nU\nJ\n\nL\nU\nJ\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nNEER\n\nREER\n\n \n\nNotes: The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate \n(REER) are based on trade composition with 24 trading partners. \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka (www.centralbanklanka.org) \n\n \nThe influx of increased foreign capital reversed the sharp devaluation of the rupee vis-\u00e0-\nvis the US dollar at end 2004, leading to a nominal appreciation of over 5.5 per cent in \nthe  week  following  the  disaster. 33  The  nominal  effective  exchange  rate  (NEER) \nappreciated by 7.7 per cent in 2005 (compared to a depreciation of 11 per cent in 2004). \n\n                                                 \n33 The  currency  depreciated  to  SLRs.105.47  per  US  dollar  on  17  December  2004\u2014the  highest \nrate  in  the  interbank  market.

To  the  extent  that  this  real  appreciation  was  a \nresult of tsunami-related aid flows, it would have had the standard Dutch disease effects \non Sri Lanka\u2019s exports. \n\nAid  flows  following  a  disaster  are,  by  their  nature,  temporary.  As  the  tsunami-related \ncapital inflows eased over time, the government was compelled to seek other forms of \nexternal  funds  to  finance  the  expanding  fiscal  deficit.  In  December  2005  Sri  Lanka \nsought a sovereign credit rating as the first step to raising an estimated US$0.5\u20131 billion \nin  the  international  bond  market.  Sri  Lanka  was  assigned  a  BB-  (below  investment \ngrade) and a B+ by two rating agencies. But, with the escalation in domestic hostilities \nthe  credit  outlook  was  downgraded  from  stable  to  negative  in  April  2006.  In  2006,  for \nexample,  the  government  raised  US$580  million  by  issuing  2\u20133-year  maturity  dollar \nbonds  (Sri  Lanka  Development  Bonds)  at  rates  of  120\u2013140  basis  points  above  the \nLondon Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) despite the inherent risks involved in recourse to \nforeign commercial borrowings.  \n\nThus, the overall macroeconomic trends raised serious concerns about the sustainability \nof the country\u2019s post-tsunami burst of GDP growth once the temporary aid flows ceased.  \n\n5.6 Social Cohesion \n\nThe  spontaneous  solidarity  that  united  communities  immediately  after  the  tsunami \nrekindled  hopes  that  the  ethnic  divisions  that  had  cost  the  country  so  dearly  in  recent \nyears  might  finally  be  waning.  However,  the  North  and  East  have  since  seen  an \nescalation  in  hostilities  between  the  GOSL  and  the  LTTE,  and  the  country  has  been \nplunged back into large-scale conflict. We have already referred to the political problems \nthat derailed the P-TOMS agreement on tsunami aid allocations to the LTTE-controlled \nareas  and  undermined  the  possibilities  for  a  lasting  peace.  This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to \nwhat  happened  in  Aceh,  Indonesia,  where  the  tsunami  created  conditions  for  the \ncessation of a long-running secessionist war.  \n\nThere  is  evidence  that  the  post-tsunami  relief  and  reconstruction  activities  may  have \ncontributed to increased social tensions among various groups in affected communities. \nMany poor households who were unaffected by the tsunami were unhappy because they \nwere  ineligible  for  tsunami  aid.  This  was  particularly  important  in  the  conflict-affected \nEastern  Province  where  large  numbers  of  people  have  suffered  from  the  two-decade-\nlong conflict and have been internally displaced for long periods of time. \n\nThe  manner  in  which  tsunami-damaged  physical  assets  were  replaced  in  some \ninstances undermined the social capital of an area by exacerbating existing tensions and \nrivalries. In some places, tensions developed between fishers and other groups because \nthe  latter  felt  that  the  fishing  industry  received  greater  attention.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSIONS \n\nFor  Sri  Lanka,  facing  a  major  natural  disaster  and  coping  with  the  subsequent \nreconstruction and recovery needs has been a unique experience. In the circumstances, \nthe  initial  relief  effort  can  be  considered  a  success.  An  unusually  large  amount  of  aid, \nfrom  a  very  large  number  of  organizations,  arrived  in  a  very  short  time.  Also,  a  large \nproportion  of  aid  flowed  through  individual,  private,  and  nongovernment  organisation \nhands  instead  of  through  the  traditional  donor  agencies  or  the  United  Nations.  This \nfacilitated  rapid  relief  and  early  initiation  of  reconstruction  activities,  but  also  raised \nissues  of  coordination  and  aid  absorption,  and  posed  some  unique  challenges.  The \nproblems and issues that emerged included:  \n\n\u2022  Problems related to the absorptive capacity of government and households; \n\u2022  Very high transaction costs and major coordination problems caused by a large \n\n\u2022  Rapid increases in demand for labour and raw materials leading to construction \n\nnumber of donor organizations;  \n\ncost escalation; \n\n\u2022  Excessive  focus  on  the  quantity  of  aid  disbursement  that  undermined  the \n\neffectiveness of aid (e.g., mal-distribution, poor quality fishing boats, etc.); \n\n\u2022  Lack of adequate local capacity to provide the information necessary for effective \n\ncoordination and monitoring of aid distribution;  \n\n\u2022  Lack of clear and transparent information-sharing mechanisms between various \n\ngovernmental and non-governmental agents; and \n\n\u2022  Differences in levels of assistance provided to tsunami-affected households and \n\nconflict-affected households in the North and the East.  \n\n \n\nIt must also be pointed out that many initial fears about a range of likely problems either \nproved  to  be  not  well  founded  or  were  resolved  effectively.  In  particular,  large-scale \ncorruption did not become a major problem, perhaps because the reconstruction did not \ninvolve large-scale infrastructure projects. Cases of petty corruption were recorded, such \nas officials abusing discretionary powers (for example, determining eligibility for different \ntypes  of  housing  aid  and  cash  grants).  In  several  such  cases  the  government  took \ndisciplinary action. There were also fears that large-scale imports of food as aid would \ndepress  domestic  producer  prices  and  hurt  farmers.  But  the  government  ensured  that \nnew food purchases by the World Food Programme were domestically sourced to help \nfarmers  recover  and  maintain  rural  incomes.  However,  the  problems  with  tsunami  aid \nallocation  and  distribution  have  aggravated  regional  disparities  and  perceptions  of \nregional/ethnic bias in policy.  \n\nThere  is  no  doubt  that,  at  the  initial  relief  stage,  what  is  most  important  is  to  ensure \ndelivery  of  basic  food, clothing,  medicines,  and  shelter.  But  aid  in  kind  may  not  be  the \nmost  effective  mode  of  assistance  later,  when  markets  and  links  with  the  rest  of  the \neconomy  have  been  re-established.  Substantial  amounts  of  aid  in  kind  provided  later \nwere  wasted  because  they  did  not  meet  the  requirements  or  the  preferences  of  the \naffected households. In contrast, cash grants allow households the flexibility to spend on \ngoods and services they actually desire.  \n\nAnother  issue  is  whether  assistance  should  be  narrowly  targeted  to  the  \u201cmost  needy\u201d \ngroups  only,  or  provided  to  all  affected  people.  The  beneficiary  lists  drawn  up  by \ngovernment agencies not only delayed distribution of grants, but also appeared to be an \ninefficient,  corruption-prone  process.  In  principle,  systems  can  be  created  where  the \n\n \n\n33\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nmost  needy  \u201cself  select,\u201d  and  these  can  work  fairly  effectively  in  some  circumstances. \nBut  it  is  not  clear  that  the  savings  made  justify  the  costs  in  delays,  the  incentives  for \ncorruption, and the likelihood that some truly needy groups miss out altogether.  \n\nA  major  challenge  is  to  devise  appropriate  administrative  mechanisms  to  ensure \neffective cooperation and coordination between central government and local agencies, \nand to ensure that central coordination does not end up stifling local initiatives. Decision-\nmaking  in  disaster  situations  requires  a  complex  balance  of  roles  between  the  central \ngovernment  and  the  locally-affected  areas,  and  the  central  government  must  be \nresponsive to the concerns and feedback from local agents. Sri Lanka initially tended to \nhave  an  overly  centralized  system,  and  there  were  concerns  that  local  governments \nwere  not  given  enough  freedom  to  make  decisions  and  implement  them.  Also,  the \ncentral  government  seemed  to  have  rushed  to  establish  new  institutions  specifically  to \ndeal  with  tsunami-related  aid  distribution,  ignoring  or  bypassing  existing  institutions, \nresulting in the reduced effectiveness of reconstruction efforts. \n\nthe \n\ntsunami  disaster  also  raised \n\nissues  of  macroeconomic \nThe  aftermath  of \nmanagement that have relevance for any country affected by a major disaster. Sri Lanka \nwas faced with the challenge of absorbing a large, but necessarily temporary, inflow of \nforeign funds. In itself this is a complex and difficult task. But the task was made even \nmore difficult by the need to direct those funds efficiently to emergency relief, and then to \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  assets  and  infrastructure.  The  initial \nassumption  that  foreign  financing  was  more  than  adequate  for  reconstruction  was \nquickly dispelled as the large-scale reconstruction programme quickly raised demand for \nconstruction  inputs  that  produced  steep  increases  in  construction  costs.  In  turn,  this \nproduced  funding  gaps  that  had  to  be  filled  either  by  the  government\u2014widening  the \nalready \nthe \ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  political  factors  that  slowed  absorption  of  foreign \nassistance  may  have  helped  to  restrain  such  cost  increases,  thereby  allowing  a  larger \nshare  of  tsunami  expenditures  to  be  effective  in  asset  rehabilitation  rather  than  be \ncaptured  by  construction  input  owners.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  highlights  the  need  for \nfactoring  in  such  cost  increases  when  assessing  needs  following  major  disasters,  and \nthe  need  for  formulation  of  a  phased  programme  of  reconstruction  which  takes  into \naccount the supply side constraints on construction inputs.  \n\nfiscal  deficit\u2014or  by  additional \n\nforeign  assistance.

These  consisted  of:  the \nTrincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara districts from the Eastern Province, the Jaffna and \nMullaitivu districts from the Northern Province, and the Hambantota, Matara, and Galle \ndistricts from the Southern Province. \n\nIn  these  eight  districts,  Grama  Niladhari  Divisions  (GNDs)  were  first  identified  where \nmore  than  50  per  cent  of  houses  were  made  unusable  due  to  being  completely  or \n \nseverely damaged using Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) data.   \n\n \n\nThe 16 GNDs for the study were distributed across the eight districts based on the level \nof housing damage in each district (Table A.1). Within the districts, GNDs were chosen \nbased on socio-economic data so as to select a representative set of GNDs considering \nethnicity, religion, livelihoods, and the location with respect to the 2005 buffer zone (the \n\u201cno-build\u201d  zone).  Socio-economic  data  for  this  purpose  were  obtained  from  the  2001 \nCensus by the DCS for the Southern districts. Since census data did not extend to the \ndistricts in the Eastern and the Northern provinces, socio-economic information for these \nprovinces  was  obtained  through  key  informants  from  those  areas.  Key  informant \ninformation was also used to select GNDs with households both within and outside the \n2005  buffer  zone.  (Information  given  by  key  informants  in  this  regard  was  not  entirely \naccurate,  and,  as  a  result,  some  GNDs  that  were  mostly  within  the  no-build  zone \nremained in the sample).  \n\nTable A.1: Distribution of GNDs across Selected Districts \n\nDistrict \n\nJaffna \nMullaitivu \nTrincomalee \nBatticaloa \nAmpara \nHambantota \nMatara \nGalle \n\nNumber of Unusable \nHouses \n3,686 \n5,137 \n4,643 \n9,905 \n10,566 \n1,290 \n2,401 \n6,169 \n\nNo. of GNDs \nSelected for Survey \n1 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n4 \n1 \n1 \n2 \n\nNote: Information from Mullaitivu was not available for the selection process \n\nA  sample  of  45  households  from  the  list  of  unusable  houses  for  each  GND  was \nrandomly  selected  for  the  household  survey,  with  30  households  outside  the  no-build \nzone and 15 within. However, in some GNDs there were less than 30 houses outside the \nbuffer  zone.  In  these  instances,  more  households  from  within  the  buffer  zone  were \ninterviewed to make up the sample. The households were selected using DCS tsunami \ncensus  data  where  available.  For  the  two  GNDs  where  DCS  data  were  not  available, \nhousehold lists obtained from Grama Niladharis (GNs) were used as a frame. \n\nDue to delays in obtaining access, the survey could not cover the Jaffna and Mullaitivu \ndistricts of the Northern Province. Therefore, information is available only for 14 GNDs in \nthe Southern and Eastern provinces. Information from the selected GNDs was collected \n\n36\n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 75 \n\nWeerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n\nat  several  levels  in  April  2005.  To  obtain  community-level  perspectives  on  rebuilding, \nrelocation,  and  land  issues,  focus  groups  were  conducted  in  all  GNDs.  In  addition, \ncommunity-level  information  to  ascertain  community  characteristics  and  information  on \nrebuilding,  relocation,  and  land  issues  was  obtained  through  key  informant  interviews \nbased on a structured questionnaire. In addition to these interviews, information on land \nsupply  in  the  GNDs  was  obtained  from  the  relevant  Divisional  Secretary\u2019s  Office,  also \nbased  on  a  structured  questionnaire.  The  household-level  interviews  were  conducted \nusing a structured household questionnaire. The questionnaires were drafted in English \nand translated to Sinhala and Tamil for use in different GNDs. \n\nIn  July  2006,  an  attempt  was  made  to  resurvey  all  the  622  households  that  were \ninterviewed for the April 2005 survey with the view to gaining updated information on the \nprogress  of  the  reconstruction  effort.  The  survey  was  designed  to  address  issues  of \npermanent housing paucity, recovery in livelihoods, etc., to get a clearer picture of where \nSri  Lanka  stood  in  the  reconstruction  process  one  and  a  half  years  after  the  tsunami \ndisaster. In addition to the housing survey, three key informant interviews in each GND \nwere  conducted.  When  a  household  could  not  be  located,  randomly  selected \nreplacement houses were surveyed from the GND. The resulting database consisted of \n595 households, of which 564 were from the original 622 households. \n\n \n\n37\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["This study updates and extends the report on the Post-Tsunami Recovery: Issues \nand Challenges in Sri Lanka, ADBI Research Paper 71, published in June 2005, \nusing  more  recent  data  on  the  progress  of  the  reconstruction  effort  and  also \ndrawing on a survey of affected households.
