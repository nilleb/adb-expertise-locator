However, \ninitial  expectations  have  turned  out  to  be  overly  optimistic.  Coordination  problems \nbetween  agencies,  constraints  on  aid  absorption  capacity,  and  inequities  in  aid \ndistribution among regions have hampered reconstruction. Infrastructure reconstruction \ntargets have not been fully met. Initial expectations that the tsunami experience would \nlead to peace were not fulfilled, inequitable distribution exacerbated mistrust, and large-\nscale conflict has resumed. Macroeconomic management and efficient absorption of a \nlarge,  necessarily  temporary,  inflow  of  foreign  funds  has  been  a  daunting  task. \nConstruction  costs  rapidly  escalated,  producing  unanticipated  funding  gaps  and \naggravating  fiscal  deficit  problems.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  highlights  the  need  for \nanticipating such cost increases when assessing needs following major disasters, as \nwell as the need for formulation of a phased programme of reconstruction which takes \ninto account the supply side constraints of construction inputs.  \nJEL Classifications: Q54, F35, H54, I38, O19 \n ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n1. BACKGROUND \nThe earthquake that caused the tsunami on 26 December 2004 occurred at 6:58 am Sri \nLanka time with the first large wave hitting the east coast at 8:35 am. Within a very short \ntime over 36,000 people were dead (this total includes the 5,644 who remain classified \nas \u2018missing\u2019), and several hundred thousand had been displaced. Massive damage had \nalso  been  inflicted  on  thousands  of  houses  and  other  buildings,  railways,  bridges, \ncommunication networks, and other infrastructure and capital assets.  \nAlthough  Sri  Lanka  had  experienced  periodic  droughts,  floods,  landslides,  and  the \noccasional cyclone, in recorded history it had never experienced a tsunami, or indeed \nany other type of natural disaster of this scale and magnitude.1 Although the country was \ncompletely unprepared for a disaster of this scale, the relief effort that got underway \nalmost  immediately\u2014initially  organized  by  local  communities,  followed  by  the \ngovernment and international agencies\u2014was able to feed, clothe, and shelter survivors; \nprovide the injured with medical attention; and ensure that the thousands of bodies were \ncremated or buried, avoiding any disease outbreaks. The initial response is generally \nagreed  to  have  been  a  success  despite  the  understandable  confusion  which \naccompanied this effort at times.  \nHowever,  as  described  in  our  earlier  report  on  this  issue  (Jayasuriya,  Steele  and \nWeerakoon,  2006),  it  became  clear  as  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  phase \nproceeded  that  moving  from  the  immediate  relief  effort  to  addressing  the  massive \nreconstruction tasks posed a different set of challenges that was in many ways more \ncomplex.  The  tsunami  had  come  at  a  time  of  deterioration  of  the  macroeconomic \nenvironment: GDP growth was slowing from the second quarter, inflationary pressure \nhad  been  persistently building  from  the  middle  of  2004,  fiscal  and  external  current \naccount deficits were growing, and the currency was rapidly depreciating.  \nAs explained in the earlier report, the tsunami\u2014paradoxically\u2014brought a measure of \nstability  to  the  economy,  which  had  been  straining  under  growing  macroeconomic \nimbalances. For Sri Lanka, as for other affected countries that were ready to accept \nexternal assistance, the promised international assistance appeared to be more than \nadequate to cover the full costs of immediate relief and reconstruction, and produced an \nalmost  euphoric  (though  impermanent)  national  mood.  In  particular,  it  provided  an \nunanticipated source of foreign capital inflows for the relief and reconstruction effort and \nenabled  the  country  to  avoid  the  slide  towards  a  currency  crisis.  Not  only  did  the \nadditional influx of foreign capital allow Sri Lanka to maintain a fairly healthy balance of \npayments (BOP) during 2005\u20132006, but relief and reconstruction-related expenditures \nalso boosted GDP growth to a healthy annual average of 6.7 per cent over the same \nperiod.  \nWhile the tsunami diverted attention away from the growing structural imbalances in the \neconomy,  they  were  not  eliminated.  As  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  phase \nproceeds\u2014albeit at a slower pace than initially anticipated\u2014issues taking centre stage \n                                                 \n1 Sri Lanka had no effective domestic hazard warning system, and had not felt the need to be part \nof international early warning systems, such as the Tsunami Warning System (TWS) in the \nPacific (which has 26 member countries).  \n \n  1", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nrelate to the effectiveness with which resources were mobilized, the effectiveness of \ndelivering  assistance  and  its  coordination,  and  the  gaps  opening  up  in  financing \nreconstruction and the implications of these financing gaps for macroeconomic policy \nmanagement. The aim of this study is to contribute to the discussions and debates on \nappropriate policies for the medium-term reconstruction effort by providing an analysis of \nsome  of  the  priority  issues  emerging  from  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  of  post-tsunami \nreconstruction and rehabilitation. We update and expand the discussion and analysis of \nthe earlier report and draw on a survey of affected households in an attempt to obtain a \nbroader understanding of the perceptions of the recovery process at the grass-roots \nlevel.2   \n2. IMPACT OF THE TSUNAMI \nThe final death toll has been estimated at around 36,000. Initial estimates of those \ndisplaced placed the number around 800,000. By mid-2005 this number had come down \nto  around  516,000  as  some  of  the  misplaced  found  alternative  sources  of \naccommodation  with  friends  and  relatives.  Damage  to  buildings  and  physical \ninfrastructure was massive. Tens of thousands of houses were damaged or destroyed, \nmany hotels were severely damaged, and six hotels were completely washed away. \nMore than 240 schools were destroyed or sustained serious damage. Several hospitals, \ntelecommunication networks, and the coastal railway network were also damaged.  \nBox 1: Immediate Impact \n \nKilled/missing persons: 35,322  \nInjured persons: 21,441  \nInternally displaced persons: 516,150  \nWidowed, orphaned, affected elderly and disabled persons: 40,000 \nLost livelihoods: 150,000 (75% of the total fishing fleet) \nValue of lost assets: US$900 million \nHouses destroyed: 89,000 \nSchools destroyed or damaged: 183 \nSchools used as camps for IDPs: 446 \nSchoolchildren affected: 200,000 \nHealth facilities destroyed or damaged: 102 \nTourism infrastructure damaged:  Large hotels: 53 out of 242 \n          Small hotels: 248 \n          Related small enterprises: 210 \nCultivated arable land affected by salinity: 23,449 acres \nNote: IDP = internally displaced person \nSource: GOSL (2006). \n \nThe geographic impact of the tsunami was uneven. Much of the coastal belt of the \nNorthern, Eastern and Southern Provinces and some parts of the Western Province \n                                                 \n2 Two household surveys of the tsunami-affected families were carried out by the Institute of \nPolicy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS). The first survey was carried out in April 2005 (IPS-TS 2005) \ncovering 622 households in six affected districts. The second survey of the same households was \ncarried out in July 2006 (IPS-TS 2006).

The Eastern Province was particularly hard hit accounting for \nnearly  half  of  total  deaths  and  displaced  persons  as  well  as  numbers  of  houses \ndamaged (Table 1). The severity of the tsunami disaster in the Northern and Eastern \nProvinces  compounded  problems  arising  from  two  decades  of  conflict  between  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The \nmajority of an estimated 360,000 conflict-related internally displaced people lived in \nthese  two  provinces.  From  the  very  early  stages,  there  were  concerns  about  how \nassistance could be channelled to LTTE-controlled areas. However, basic relief supplies \ndid manage to get through to affected people during the early phases of the relief effort. \nTable 1: Key Human and Asset Loss by District/Province \n \nDistrict/Province  No. of  No. of  No. of Damaged \nDeathsa  Displaceda  Housesb \nGalle  4,214  128,077  12,781 \nMatara  1,342  13,305  7,464 \nHambantota  4,500  17,723  4,084 \nSouthern Province  10,056  159,105  24,329 \nColombo  79  31,239  5,984 \nGampaha  6  1,449  675 \nKalutara  256  27,713  6,124 \nWestern Province  341  60,401  12,783 \nAmpara  10,440  75,238  24,438 \nBatticaloa  2,840  61,912  17,948 \nTrincomalee  1,078  81,643  8,074 \nEastern Province  14,354  218,727  50,460 \nJaffna  2,640  39,907  5,109 \nMullaitivu  3,000  22,557  5,556 \nKillinochchi  500  1,603  288 \nNorthern Province  6,200  64,067  10,953 \nTotal  30,955  502,366  98,525 \nNotes: aAs of January 2005; bAs of October 2005.  \nSource: Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). \n   \nThe preliminary assessment of damages completed by end-January 2005 through a joint \neffort  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC), and the World Bank (WB) estimated that Sri Lanka had suffered \nasset damages of around US$1 billion (4.5 per cent of GDP), and estimated that the \nmedium-term financing needs (including immediate relief) would be around US$1.5\u20131.6 \nbillion (7.5 per cent of GDP).

In line with the regional variation in the \nextent of damages incurred, the largest financing needs were identified in the East (45 \nper cent), followed by the South (26 per cent), North (19 per cent), and West (10 per \ncent).  \n3. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE \nIn the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, the Ministry of Public Security, Law and \nOrder set up an operations centre, the Centre for National Operations (CNO), to handle \nthe response, and the Secretary to the Ministry was appointed as the Commissioner \nGeneral  of  Essential  Services  to  oversee  the  coordination  of  government  agencies \ninvolved in rescue and relief. Three task forces were set up to address specific aspects \nof the relief effort: the Task Force for Rescue and Relief (TAFRER); the Task Force for \nLogistics, Law and Order (TAFLOL); and the Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation \n(TAFREN). \n \n                                                 \n4 The GOSL identified its needs for a 3\u20135 year rehabilitation phase. \n  4", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nWhile there were hiccups and confusion in organizing the relief, for a country that had \nnot  previously  experienced  such  a  disaster,  Sri  Lankan  institutions  responded \nreasonably well. Essential medical aid, emergency food, and other relief supplies were \nmobilized within a day. Temporary shelter for the displaced was provided in schools, \nother public and religious buildings, and tents. Communities and groups cooperated \nacross  barriers  that  had  divided  them  for  decades.  Public  and  private  sector \norganizations cooperated and organized relief efforts at many levels. Sri Lanka\u2019s past \ninvestments in public health paid off in this emergency: the broad-based public health \nsystem and community awareness of basic sanitary and hygienic practices ensured that \nthere were no disease outbreaks.  \nOnce the immediate relief and rehabilitation measures for provision of food, shelter, \nclothing, clean water, and sanitary and medical facilities to affected families had been \nprovided, it was necessary to address community needs to cope with the trauma and \nstart  rebuilding  lives.  The  initial  provision  of  cash  grants to  meet  immediate  needs \nincluded  (i)  compensation  of  SLRs.15,000  (US$150)  for  victims  towards  funeral \nexpenses; (ii) payment of SLRs.375 (US$3.75) in cash and rations for each member of \nthe family unit per week; and (iii) a payment of SLRs.2,500 (US$25) towards basic \nkitchen equipment. These initial measures were largely successful, though there were \nsome  problems  with  lack  of  coordination.5 Overall,  the  emergency  relief  was  quite \nsuccessful in meeting the immediate needs of the affected people.6 \n4. SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT \nThe tsunami struck at a time when the Sri Lankan macro economy was already under \npressure on several fronts, reigniting fears of a slide into the kind of crisis that was seen \nin 2001 when the economy contracted by 1.5 per cent (Table 3). On the policy front, \nthere was considerable unease within the business and investor community about the \ndirection  of  economic  policy  under  a  new  government  elected  in  April  2004.  Its \nprogramme, with the stated goal of \u201cgrowth with equity,\u201d and a strong emphasis on rural \neconomic development, was viewed by sections of the business and investor community \nas being populist and interventionist.  \n \n                                                 \n5 For  example,  while  food  rations  were  generally  available,  there  were  problems  with  the \nprovision of adequate variety and quality in some locations; complaints emerged about the \napplication of different rules in different areas for the distribution of rations and cash grants.  \n6 An assessment of the initial response to the tsunami at the Sri Lanka Development Forum 2005 \ncan be found at www.erd.gov.lk/DevForum/ \n \n  5", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nTable 3: Selected Macroeconomic Indicators: 2001\u20132005 \nNATIONAL  Unit  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nACCOUNTS \nGDP  US$ billion  15.1 16.4 18.2 19.4 23.2  26.0\nGDP growth  %  -1.5 4.0 6.0 5.4 6.0  7.4\n  Agriculture  %  -3.4 2.5 1.6 -0.3 1.5  4.7\n  Industry  %  -2.1 1.0 5.5 5.2 8.3  7.2\n  Services  %  -0.5 6.1 7.9 7.6 6.4  8.3\nInvestment  % of GDP  22.0 21.3 22.1 25.0 26.5  28.7\nSavings  % of GDP  15.8 14.5 15.9 15.9 17.3  17.1\nEXTERNAL     \nSECTOR \nExports   US$ million  4817 4699 5133 5757 6347  6883\nImports  US$ million  5974 6105 6672 8000 8863  10253\nTrade balance  % of GDP  -7.3 -8.5 -8.4 -11.2 -10.7  -12.5\nCurrent a/c \nbalance   % of GDP  -1.4 -1.4 -0.4 -3.2 -2.8  -4.9\nFDI  % of GDP  0.5 1.1 0.9 1.1 1.0  1.7\nOfficial reserves  US$ million  1338 1700 2329 2196 2735  2837\nTourist arrivals  \u2018000 \npersons  336794 393174 500642 566202 549308  559603\nTourist earnings  US$ million  202 250 340 408 356  410\nFISCAL     \nVARIABLES \nGovt. \nexpenditure  % of GDP  27.5 25.4 23.7 23.5 24.7  25.4\nGovt. revenue  % of GDP  16.7 16.5 15.7 15.4 16.1  17.0\nFiscal balance  % of GDP  -10.8 -8.9 -8.0 -8.2 -8.7  -8.4\nGovt. debt   % of GDP  103.2 105.4 105.8 105.5 93.9  93.0\nPRICES AND     \nMONEY \nRate of inflation  %  14.2 9.6 6.3 7.6 11.6  13.7\nInterest ratea  %  13.74 9.91 7.24 7.65 10.37  12.96\nBroad money \n(M2)  % change  13.6 13.4 15.3 19.6 19.1  17.8\nExchange rate  Rs/US$  93.2 96.7 96.7 104.6 102.1  107.7\nASPIb   1985=100  621.0 815.1 1062.1 1506.9 1922.2  2722.4\nNotes: a2-month Treasury bill rate ; bAll share price index. \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Annual Report, various issues.  \n \nEconomic growth began to slow from the second quarter of 2004 and ended the year \nwith a growth rate of 5.4 per cent. While the election-related uncertainties and the \nensuing policy vacuum no doubt contributed to the slowdown in economic activity, some \npolicy  weaknesses  and  the  slow  pace  of  reforms  contributed  to  the  lacklustre \nperformance. The most visible, and potentially the most destabilizing manifestation of \nweakening  macroeconomic  management  in  2004  was  a  persistent  build  up  of \ninflationary pressure from the mid-year onwards. Inflationary pressure was fuelled on \nmultiple fronts, not least by the conduct of an expansionary fiscal policy driven by \nincreased subsidies and transfers.  \n  6", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n \nDomestic imbalances were exacerbated by a ballooning oil import bill which saw the \ncurrent account deficit on BOP widening to over 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2004 (from 0.4 \nper cent in 2003). This was accompanied by a deceleration of capital inflows, with long-\nterm  inflows  to  the  government  (consisting  primarily  of  foreign  concessional  loans) \ndeclining by US$130 million in 2004. Foreign borrowings by the commercial banking \nsector increased significantly in 2004 raising the country\u2019s foreign private debt exposure. \nThe currency depreciated by 8.5 per cent against the US dollar despite efforts to bolster \nthe exchange rate, which contributed to the decline in Sri Lanka\u2019s gross official reserves \nfrom US$2.3 billion at the beginning of 2004 to US$1.9 billion by November.  \nThese domestic and external developments led to an acceleration of inflation from mid-\n2004, and real interest rates turned negative. Symptoms of a bubble economy began to \nemerge: a sharp increase in credit growth in excess of 20 per cent and a boom in the \nColombo stock market unsupported by major indicators of economic fundamentals. The \npeace process between the GOSL and the LTTE appeared to have stalled, and with \nprivatization initiatives shelved concerns over the government\u2019s ability to reduce the \nfiscal deficit began to increase. Markets started to get jittery with the growing realization \nthat fundamental imbalances in the economy were intensifying. Though the external \npayments situation improved marginally in December 2004, rupee depreciation again \ngathered pace. On 17 December 2004, the currency fell to an historical low of SLRs.105 \nagainst the US dollar. \nAgainst this backdrop, the immediate negative impact on output as measured by the \nGDP figure was expected to be fairly limited, ranging from a 0.5 to a 0.7 per cent \nreduction  in  2005  GDP.  The  relatively  small  impact  on  GDP  appeared  somewhat \nsurprising given the extent of human and asset losses. This was not only owing to the \nfact that only a relatively small sector of the economy was affected, but also because \nGDP captures only the annualised flow of damages to the stock of asset damages, and \nspending on relief efforts was expected to have an immediate positive effect on current \nGDP.   \n5. REHABILITATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND RECOVERY PHASE \n5.1 Recovery Targets and Actual Progress \nThe government planned the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase to be spread over \nthree to five years (GOSL, 2005c). Nevertheless, there were pronouncements at the \npolitical level that all permanent housing needs would be met within a year. Over time, it \nhas  become  clear  that  these  were  optimistic  pledges.  In  fact,  housing  needs,  for \nexample, had not been met fully even by the end of 2006, while reconstruction of \ndamaged schools and hospitals, and rehabilitation of roads, bridges, etc. is likely to take \nlonger than envisaged. \n5.1.1 Infrastructure \nA total of 182 schools and 222 health institutions were affected by the tsunami. Targets \nin the education and health sectors included the reconstruction and renovation of 183 \nschools, four universities, seven Vocational Training Authorities, 444 internally displaced \n  7", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nperson (IDP) schools (schools used as refugee camps), and the reconstruction and \nrenovation of 102 health institutions.  \nThe pace of recovery, particularly of larger scale infrastructure projects, has been slow \nwith an estimated 50 per cent of construction projects yet to commence by end 2006 \n(GOSL, 2006). By end 2006, 57 per cent of damaged schools were estimated to be in \nvarious stages of construction with only 10 per cent of projects completed and handed \nover (GOSL, 2006). Similarly, in the health sector only 55 of a total of 102 damaged \nbuildings have been completed (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Progress in Education and Health Infrastructure \n \n  Education  Health \nNo. affected  183  102 \nWithout donors  11  \u2014 \nCompleted  18  55 \nIn-progress  105  \u2014 \nNot commenced  49  \u2014 \nSource: GOSL (2006). \n \nThe bulk of infrastructure damage was to roads and railways (Table 5). A total length of \napproximately 800 kilometres of national road network and 1,500 kilometres of provincial \nand  local  government  roads  were  damaged.  The  railway  infrastructure  on  a  160-\nkilometre-long stretch along the tsunami-affected coastline was also severely damaged. \nThe target date for completion of road and bridge reconstruction was set at 2009. As we \nshall discuss below, this target date may prove difficult to meet because of serious \ncapacity constraints and cost escalations. The government itself has recognised that the \nconstruction industry does not have the necessary contractors, equipment, or skilled \nworkforce for such a major reconstruction effort (GOSL, 2005a).  \nTable 5: Progress in Infrastructure \n \n  Damage  Progress 2006 \nWater & sanitation    130 projects planned.

By end December 2005 the numbers of displaced had \ndropped  to  85,525,  of  whom  53,000  were  in  transitional  shelters.  This  figure  was \nestimated at around 40,000 by end 2006.  \nThere have been significant revisions regarding housing policy. An initial declaration by \nthe government of a buffer zone between land and sea of 100 metres on the south and \nsouthwest coast and 200 metres on the north and east coast of the country led to the \ninitiation of two types of housing programmes: (i) donor-built housing reconstruction and \n(ii) home owner-driven housing reconstruction. No reconstruction of houses (partially or \nfully damaged) was to be allowed within the buffer zone. Thus, all affected households \nwithin the demarcated buffer zone were to be provided with a house built with donor \nassistance on land allocated by the state while allowing them to retain ownership of the \noriginal land. Households were not required to demonstrate ownership of the land to \nqualify for such assistance.  \nFor those whose damaged houses were deemed to be outside the designated buffer \nzone, the government agreed to provide grants and loans for households to re-build at \nthe same location. In order to qualify for the entitlement, households were required to \nprove  ownership  of  the  land.  The  criteria  set  down  in  terms  of  financing  such \nreconstruction included an assessment of damages on a points basis where a house \ndeemed to be more than 40 per cent damaged would qualify for a grant of SLRs.250,000 \n(US$2,500) in four instalments, based on progress. A grant of SLRs.100,000 (US$1,000) \nwas made available to rebuild a house deemed to be less than 40 per cent damaged, \ndisbursed in two stages.   \n                                                 \n7 As of end 2006, 42,096 of the 57,057 shelters originally constructed had been decommissioned \nwith only 14,961 shelters remaining occupied (GOSL, 2006). \n  9", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nPredictably, the buffer zone became a politically controversial issue from the very outset. \nThe limits were set in a fairly arbitrary manner, not taking into account topographical and \nother  relevant  features  of  the  land  that  would  affect  hazard  risk.  There  was  also \ndissatisfaction that the rules were not to be applied across all building units, with tourist \nenterprises being permitted to rebuild within the designated zone. Many of the tsunami-\naffected fishermen, for example, argued the need to retain land close to the sea to \nsustain their livelihoods. \nHowever, IPS-TS 2006 results showed that about 60 per cent of surveyed households \nthought that the government\u2019s original buffer zone rule was a \u201cgood idea.\u201d Data at the \nGrama Niladari Division (GND) level agreed with this finding; almost all Grama Niladaris \n(GNs)  (village  level  government  officers)  interviewed  agreed  that  the  government\u2019s \noriginal buffer zone policy was \u201cgood.\u201d Paradoxically, they were also happy with the \nrelaxation of the buffer zone in 2006. Although there were delays in providing housing \nbecause of the buffer zone rule, most households saw the prospect of better housing \nbecause of this policy: IPS-TS 2005 results found that most houses that were destroyed \nwere smaller than the minimum floor area of 500 square feet specified for new houses \nunder the donor-driven programme; in other words, a majority of households would get \nsuperior replacement houses, at least in terms of floor area.8 Moreover, while all new \nhouses are to be built with permanent housing materials, a large share of destroyed \nhouses had been made of temporary housing material.9 Also, households that did not \nhave legal ownership of land were given houses under the donor-driven programme.10 \nThese factors may have outweighed the costs incurred by many households due to \ndelays in housing progress caused by the 2005 buffer zone rule. \nBut there was widespread popular opposition on many levels to the buffer zone policy. \nBy end 2005, the government had largely abandoned the idea of enforcing the buffer \nzone  restrictions.  In  particular,  the  scarcity  of  land  with  which  to  relocate  affected \nhouseholds highlighted the impracticality of enforcing such a zone in the face of the \nneed to ensure permanent housing within a reasonable period of time. A more relaxed \nbuffer zone policy was announced in May 2006 along with a \u201cRevised Tsunami Housing \nPolicy.\u201d11 It was essentially aimed at ensuring that all tsunami-affected people return to \ntheir houses or get new houses by the end of 2006. The policy document promised \u201ca \nhouse for a house, regardless of land ownership.\u201d It defined two zones (not buffer \nzones)12 with four housing options with the cost being shared by the government and \ndonors (see Box 2).  \n                                                 \n8 About 53 per cent of the surveyed houses made unusable by the tsunami were less than 450 \nsquare feet, while only 10 per cent were bigger than 600 square feet. \n9 About 32 per cent of roofs of the surveyed houses were made of cadjan or metal sheets, while \nclose to half of the surveyed houses had walls made of temporary material. \n10 About 13 per cent of surveyed households inside the buffer zone owned houses on \ngovernment land, while a further 9 per cent owned houses built on other people\u2019s private land. \n11 The new boundaries were set according to the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) Coastal \nManagement Plan of 1997. \n12 Zone 1 referred to any state reservation within tsunami-affected areas while Zone 2 is any area \noutside Zone 1. \n  10", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nBox 2: Revised Tsunami Housing Policy \n1)  Government  land  +  donor-built  house  under  the  donor-driven  housing \nprogramme primarily for all those who previously lived within the buffer zone. \n2)  Government land + government cash grant (SLRs.250,000) to construct a \nnew house + regulated donor assistance provided to complete the houses \n(not  less  than  SLRs.250,000  depending  on  costs  to  meet  the  minimum \nstandard house) through co-financing agreement. \n3)  Government cash grant (SLRs.150,000 for three divisions in Ampara and \nSLRs.250,000  for  Colombo)  to  purchase  land  +  government  cash  grant \n(SLRs.250,000) to construct a house + regulated donor assistance provided \nto complete (not less than SLRs.250,000, depending on costs, to meet the \nminimum standard house) through co-financing agreement. \n4)  Housing reconstruction grant (SLRs.250,000 for fully damaged homes and \nSLRs.100,000 for partially damaged homes) + regulated donor assistance \nprovided to complete only fully damaged houses as required for meeting the \nminimum standard house through co-financing agreement. \nSource: RADA (2006). \n \nThe revised housing policy pushed the total housing needs to around 110,000 units. The \nkey change was a decision to extend house eligibility to those without legal ownership of \nland outside the former buffer zone and to offer housing to extended family members \nliving in the affected households. \nSecondly, in contrast to the earlier policy, the government and donors were to jointly \nprovide for a minimum of SLRs.500,000 (US$5,000) cash support to a tsunami-affected \nfamily to build a house. The significant cost escalation of construction material and \nlabour, already clearly visible by end 2005, undoubtedly forced a revision of the earlier \nestimates. Under the revised policy, the GOSL was to provide the cash grant, initially \nreimbursed  by  different  development  banks  and  bilateral  donors.13 The  grant  of \nSLRs.250,000 (US$2,500) each from the government and donors was to be given in \ninstalments; a first instalment of SLRs.50,000 (US$500) by the government matched \nequally by the donor and thereafter followed accordingly. The beneficiary was to receive \nfull title to the property in the resettlement area (while retaining legal ownership of \nproperty within the re-designated buffer zone). \nFinally, under the donor-built reconstruction programme, standard building requirements \nwere set down by the GOSL of a floor area of 500 square feet; the donor was to make \navailable  common  infrastructure  for  housing  clusters,  and  the  government  was  to \nprovide services up to the relocation site. The technical specifications were revised to \nensure a more equitable basis. This was primarily a response to the initial experience \nwhere donors build houses of widely varying quality, with some houses costing only \nSLRs.400,000  and  others  being  valued  at  over  SLRs.1  million  (US$4,000  to  over \nUS$10,000), causing friction amongst recipients.14  \n                                                 \n13 Extended since to co-financing arrangements through local and foreign NGOs as well.  \n14 Sunday Times, 14 May 2006. About 3 per cent of the households surveyed in the IPS-TS 2006 \nhad shifted from one NGO-allocated list to another. The most common reasons for switching \nwere: expectation of better assistance, to move closer to the sea, or because the first NGO had \nfailed to deliver a house. \n  11", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nThe  new  housing  policy  requirements  are  identified  under  a  homeowner-driven \nprogramme  and  a  relocation  housing  programme.  Overall,  revisions  to  the  housing \npolicy (involving a higher cash grant component and a significant increase in the number \nof housing units deemed necessary) meant that questions would be raised about the \nability to meet the costs of reconstruction within the commitments made by donors. It \nalso created much confusion amongst the beneficiary households. Only about a quarter \nof  the  households  surveyed  in  the  IPS-TS  2006  were  clear  about  their  housing \nentitlements. Close to 60 per cent indicated that they would like legal advice regarding \ntheir rights as a homeowner. \nTable 7: Housing Requirements \n \n  Original  Revised  Completed \n(2005)  (2006)  (end \n2006) \nHomeowner-driven Programme  55,525  79,184  46,531 \nPartially damaged   32,497  39,823  34,988 \nFully damaged   23,028  39,361  11,543 \n       \nRelocation Housing Programme  43,000  29,830  14,488 \nSource: GOSL, (2006). \n \nAs of November 2006, 46,531 partially or fully damaged houses had been rehabilitated, \nrecording an 85 per cent completion rate. Nevertheless, a funding gap of US$ 107 \nmillion has been identified to complete most of the fully damaged houses (GOSL, 2006). \nIn contrast to the progress in the homeowner-driven rehabilitation, progress in relocating \ntsunami-affected families has been much slower at only 50 per cent of required units \nhaving been completed by November 2006. As the target in this scheme was reduced \nsubstantially, the government estimates that sufficient funds are available to successfully \ncomplete this programme (GOSL, 2006). \nThe lack of clarity regarding housing entitlements and distribution was apparent from the \nsurvey results. The IPS-TS 2005 and 2006 data give information on the location of \nhouseholds with respect to the 2005 buffer zone, and house and land tenure for 559 \nhouseholds. Of these, 268 were eligible for the donor-driven new housing and 157 were \neligible for owner-driven housing reconstruction. A total of 134 households were not \neligible for a new house either because they were not homeowners before the tsunami \n(70 per cent of 134) or because they were outside the 2005 buffer zone, and were \nhomeowners without land tenure (30 per cent of 134). \nThe survey found considerable inequities in the distribution of new houses. Housing \nprogress was worst for people who were actually eligible for donor-driven new housing. \nAbout 65 per cent of such households were still to be found in temporary housing as of \nmid-2006. At the same time, about 56 per cent of households who were not eligible for a \nnew house had received a house. There appeared to be inconsistencies between official \ngovernment policy on housing and actual practice. Some households eligible to relocate \nunder  the  donor-driven  housing  programme  had  rebuilt  (19  per  cent),  while  others \neligible to rebuild under the owner-driven housing programme had relocated (16 per \ncent). Some households had received houses outside both these programmes, and \nothers who were not eligible to receive a house under either programme had also \nreceived houses (see Table 8).  \n  12", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nTable 8: Housing Situation as at July 2006 \n(by eligibility under the 2005 housing programme) \n \nDonor Built on  Temporary \nEligibility  Rebuilt  Relocated Old Site  Housing  NIa  Total \n             \nDonor-driven  52  25  11  175  5  268 \n  19.4  9.3  4.1  65.3  1.9  100.0 \nOwner-driven  76  25  22  26  8  157 \n  48.4  15.9  14.0  16.6  5.1  100.0 \nNot eligibleb  34  17  24  59  0  134 \n  25.4  12.7  17.9  44.0  0.0  100.0 \nTotal  162  67  57  260  13  559 \nNotes: aNo information; bHouseholds not owning a house before the tsunami (70% of 134) and \nhouseholds owning a house on encroached land (30% of 134) outside the buffer zone were not \neligible for a new house under the 2005 housing policy.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on IPS TS 2005 and IPS TS 2006 data. \n \nThere were coordination problems across various donors, especially those who provided \nhouses  without  adhering  to  government  plans.

In the case of \ndonor housing, it has been pointed out that many donors that had large amounts of \nfunds at their disposal and had pledged to build large numbers of housing units failed to \nmeet even 50 per cent of their original targets (GOSL, 2006).  \nThese  findings  are  consistent  with  the  survey  results:  lack  of  land  and  delays  in \nobtaining donor assistance were cited as the main reasons for the slow progress in the \ndonor-driven housing programme. The survey results also suggested that some people \nfound that they were worse-off in terms of quality of housing and access to services \n(Table 10). There were claims that people\u2019s lifestyles were not taken into consideration \nwhen designing the new houses. For instance, the percentage of households using \nexpensive sources of fuel for cooking such as gas and electricity increased from 10 per \ncent to 18 per cent, primarily because many of the new houses did not include a kitchen \nwith a chimney to allow use of firewood for cooking.   \nTable 10: Quality of Housing Before and After Tsunami for Relocated Households \n  No.  Better Now  Worse Now  No Difference \nHouse design  69  42%  41%  14% \nConstruction materials \n69  27%  49%  21% \nused for housing \nAccess to services \n69  14%  63%  20% \n(water, electricity, road) \nPrimary school within 1 \n73  10%  62%  29% \nkm \nClinic within 1 km  73  1%  59%  40% \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using IPS-TS 2005 and 2006 data. \n \nThe relatively smooth progress of the homeowner-driven housing programme vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe relocation programme has encouraged the Reconstruction and Development Agency \n(RADA)  to  consider  converting  donor-driven  housing  projects  to  owner-driven \nprogrammes.  Owner-driven  housing  programmes  were  reportedly  more  effective \nbecause families got the funds directly into their own hands.15  Owner-driven housing \nprojects not only progressed faster but also proved to be cheaper than donor-driven \nprojects.  The  cost  of  a  single  donor-assisted  housing  unit  was  estimated  to  range \nbetween SLRs.0.4\u20131.6 million (US$4,000\u201316,000) even without the additional costs of \nsite preparation, land-filling, drainage, and infrastructure provision (GOSL, 2006). \nConsidering these factors, RADA urged the international NGOs (INGOs) to transfer their \ntsunami reconstruction funds to the Treasury so that the government could direct funds \nto the victims. Additional funding of around US$50 million was needed to shift house \nconstruction previously under donor-driven programmes into owner-driven programmes \n(MFP, 2006). RADA argued that this would be the most practical way of resolving the \nlogistical problems that INGOs faced in constructing houses themselves. Many donors \nhad concerns about allowing the government to choose beneficiaries. To address those \nconcerns and to ensure transparency, it was proposed that donors who opted to convert \n                                                 \n15 Daily Mirror, 28 January 2006. \n  15", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nto the owner-driven programme could be given a list of beneficiaries, so that they could \nverify their needs and make payments directly to those families. However, with the sole \nexception of the Red Cross (which had complied with the request to cooperate with the \ngovernment and converted two-thirds of their pledges (US$25 million)), INGOs showed \nno enthusiasm to transfer funds to the government.16 \nEscalating costs of building materials and skilled construction labour may also have \ncontributed to slow progress in housing.  All interviewed key informants reported that the \ncost of building materials and the wages of carpenters and masons had increased since \nthe tsunami, with more than three-quarters stating that construction costs had increased \nby \u201ca lot.\u201d  \n5.1.3 Livelihoods \nAn estimated 150,000 people lost their main source of income because of the tsunami.17 \nAbout 50 per cent of these were in the fisheries sector, with others distributed among \nagriculture  (4\u20135  per  cent),  tourism,  and  small  and  micro  enterprise-related  sectors \n(GOSL, 2005a). In all surveyed districts, people received some livelihood support. Types \nof livelihood assistance have included grants in kind (income-generating assets such as \nfishing boats and equipment), cash grants, loans, training (vocational, business support, \netc.), cash-for-work, and temporary employment.  \nAccording to official sources, around 75 per cent of the affected families had regained \ntheir main source of income by end 2005 (GOSL, 2005a). This is supported by the \nsurvey results where 71 per cent of interviewed households claimed they had regained \ntheir previous source of livelihood. Only 8 per cent of heads of households had changed \ntheir livelihood,18 while 21 per cent were still unemployed.19 Thus, within a year of the \ntsunami, most people were back in their previous occupations. However, this did not \nmean that people regained their previous level of income. According to our household-\nlevel survey, on average close to 60 per cent of households considered their real family \nincome\u2014in terms of their ability to cover basic needs such as food and health\u2014to be \nlower than their pre-tsunami income.  \nThere were regional variations in income recovery patterns. Compared to the Southern \nProvince, a higher proportion of Eastern Province households felt that they were worse-\noff.20 According to the survey data\u2014in both the Southern and Eastern provinces\u2014poor \ndistribution  of  livelihood-related  assets,  the  buffer  zone  rule,  and  damages  to  work \nplaces have affected livelihood recovery. In addition to these, inability to participate in \nemployment training (due to security reasons) has also slowed down livelihood recovery \nin the Eastern Province.  \n                                                 \n16 Sunday Observer, 27 August 2006. \n17 RADA estimates place those who have lost livelihoods at 200,000 with a further 125,000 jobs \nbeing lost indirectly (see www.rada.gov.lk).   \n18 About a half of the household heads that have changed their livelihoods come from one GND, \nin the Eastern Province.   \n19 Further,  the  current  housing  situation  does  not  appear  to  have  any  effect  on  livelihood \nrecovery. \n20 Key informants in almost all surveyed districts in the Southern Province, and in around half of \nthe surveyed districts in the Eastern Province, thought people are better-off now because of aid, \ntraining, and more employment opportunities. There were also considerable differences between \nclusters of villages.  \n \n  16", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nThe damage to tourism infrastructure was quite significant and affected tourism-related \nlivelihoods. A total of 53 (out of 242) large hotels and a further 248 small hotels were \ndamaged or destroyed. In terms of hotel rooms, about 3,500 out of a total of 13,000 \nrooms available in medium to large-scale hotels were out of service in February 2005. \nApproximately  210  small  enterprises  that  rely  on  the  tourism  industry  were  also \ndestroyed along the coastline. They were mostly enterprises engaged in informal sector \nactivities, and 190 of them were not formally registered with the tourist board. Of the 53 \nlarge-scale hotels damaged, 41 were back in operation by end 2005.  \nDespite the gradual restoration of infrastructure damage to tourist facilities, recovery in \nlivelihoods in the sector was slow. Sri Lanka saw the largest ever number of tourist \narrivals in 2004 and although recorded \u201ctourist\u201d arrival numbers did not fall steeply in \n2005, many of those counted as tourists were aid workers visiting the country rather than \ngenuine tourists. Tourism earnings, in fact, dropped sharply in 2005 (see Table 3). This \nsuggests that many potential tourists were discounting Sri Lanka as a desirable travel \ndestination in the aftermath of the tsunami. Recovery in tourism was further constrained \nby an escalation in ethnic conflict-related incidents from the end of 2005 that deterred \nthe return of tourists in numbers comparable to pre-tsunami levels. Thus, while damage \nto infrastructure was relevant, it was the negative psychological impact of the tsunami \nand the subsequent political conflicts that seem to have played a more significant role in \nhampering recovery in the tourist sector.  \nBy contrast, recovery of fisheries-related livelihoods was swifter despite the fact that this \nwas the most badly affected sector. Those engaged in fishing or related activities made \nup  over  one-third  of  the  affected  households.  In  total,  over  100,000  people  in  the \nfisheries sector were displaced, 16,434 houses were damaged and 13,329 destroyed, \nand nearly 4,870 fishermen lost their lives with a further 136 reported missing (MFAR, \n2006). In terms of equipment, as set out in Table 11 an estimated 75 per cent of the \nfishing fleet (32,000 boats) had been totally destroyed or severely damaged (around 23 \nper cent were made un-seaworthy and 54 per cent were destroyed), and one million \nfishing nets were lost. Apart from these, the basic infrastructure of the fishing industry, \nsuch as boatyards, cold rooms, ice plants, and fish markets, were damaged. Damage to \nfishery harbours and other infrastructure facilities, government services facilities, coast \nconservation  structures,  etc.,  was  placed  at  US$275  million,  while  repair  and \nreplacement costs for the damaged fleet were estimated at US$60 million. \nBy end 2006, the fisheries harvest had been restored to 70 per cent of the pre-tsunami \nlevel with most of the affected fishers returning to their occupation (GOSL, 2006) The \nrelatively rapid recovery of the fisheries sector can be attributed primarily to the relatively \nrapid progress in replacement of the fishing boats and equipment. The fisheries sector \nreceived more immediate assistance than other affected sectors and was able to replace \nmost of its productive assets fairly quickly. A large proportion of destroyed boats had \nbeen replaced, and all damaged boats were repaired by end 2005.21 \n                                                 \n21 There is some debate about the exact numbers of boats damaged and repaired. For most boat \ntypes, the number of crafts repaired has exceeded the numbers reported as damaged. It has \nbeen suggested that boat owners in non-tsunami-affected areas may have transferred their boats \nto these areas to take advantage of the opportunity to get minor repairs done, that there may \nhave been mis-categorisation of beach seine crafts as traditional crafts, and that boats classified \nas destroyed may have been repaired and put back to sea. \n  17", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nTable 11: Fishing Boats Destroyed and Damaged \n \n  2004  Damaged  Destroyed \nBoat Type  Fleet  No.  Repaired  No.  Replaced \nMulti-day  1,581  676  780  187  0 \nOne day boats  1,493  783  904  276  29 \nFRP boats  11,559  3,211  4,258  4,480  4,321 \nTraditional crafts  15,934  2,435  3,479  11,158  8,636 \nBeach seine crafts  1,052  161  134  818  204 \nTotal  31,619  7,266  9,555  16,919  13,190 \nNote: FRP=fiberglass reinforced plastic  \nSource: MFAR (2006).  \n \nHowever, there have been complaints about the poor quality of repairs. According to \nresults of a survey carried out in December 2005, 8 per cent of the repaired boats were \nnot being used due to dissatisfaction with the repairs.22 Inadequate technical inputs \nand/or supervision, lack of boat-building knowledge and expertise on the part of NGOs \n(as well as the fishers), and the absence of proper contracts for after-sales services are \nblamed for poor-quality repairs, with boat-builders using low-quality material, reducing \nthe thickness, etc., to meet deadlines and profit from the opportunity.  \nBy end 2005, 78 per cent of the destroyed fishing fleet had been replaced (this figure \nhad risen to 95 per cent by mid-2006)23 with pledges for more than 6,000 boats still \noutstanding. But 19 per cent of the new boats provided were found not to be seaworthy. \nLack of coordination in distribution efforts also led to conflicts and problems over the \nincreasing numbers of boats, the quality of boats, etc. For many NGOs, the provision of \nsmall fishing boats was seen as an \u201cattractive\u201d tsunami aid programme that had high \nvisibility but was easy to implement and not too expensive.  \nThe result of this focus on providing small fishing boats, however, may be an oversupply \nof boats. Such an oversupply is likely to be unhealthy for the fisheries sector in the \nlonger term due to the prospect of over-fishing. The oversupply can be attributed to \nseveral factors. There was no reliable data on the fishing fleet prior to the tsunami, and \nthe damage assessments done by a large number of agencies had their weaknesses. \nSometimes,  people  who  were  not  familiar  with  the  community  of  fishers  were \nresponsible for gathering data on previous boat ownership; this permitted many non-\nfishers to acquire boats. Misidentifications and overlaps occurred as a result of delays in \nissuing Entitlement Cards by MFAR. Also, the same beneficiary list was sometimes \nprovided to more than one NGO to speed up the recovery process. There was a lack of \ncoordination between the fisheries authorities and the NGOs, poor coordination between \nNGOs themselves, and competition amongst these agencies which led to errors and \nmiscalculations  (MFAR,  2006).  Anecdotal  evidence  from  district-level  authorities \nindicated that reluctance to share information on the part of some NGOs made the task \nof coordinating even more difficult.  \nMany genuine beneficiaries did not receive new boats because allocations were not \nproperly targeted. Based on extrapolations from the findings of a survey done by the \nauthorities in December 2005, only 6,067 of the 13,190 (46 per cent) boats distributed \n                                                 \n22 Cited in MFAR (2006). \n23 RADA (2006). \n  18", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nwent  to  \u201cgenuine\u201d  beneficiaries.  Some  small,  local  agencies  had  provided  boats  to \n\u201cfriends and relatives\u201d and had bypassed the fishing authorities.24 \nAccess to credit is a vital element for livelihood recovery. Most of the tsunami-affected \nbusinesses  were  informal,  small-scale  industries\u2014an  estimated  25,000  micro-\nenterprises were damaged in the disaster. In addition, 15,000 tsunami survivors were \npreviously  involved  in  self-employed  and  informal  sector  activities  such  as  food \nprocessing, coir manufacture, carpentry, and tailoring. While over forty organizations \nwere involved in a host of micro-finance programmes established to assist small- and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  the  primary  sources  of  credit  were  two  major \ngovernment finance schemes.  \nPrior to the tsunami, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had been implementing a micro-\nfinance  scheme  (Susahana)  through  the  two  state-owned  commercial  banks.  The \nSusahana loan is provided with no repayment required for the first year and interest at a \nfixed rate of 6 per cent thereafter. The National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) also \noffered similar terms through its partner organizations. Following the tsunami, lending \nescalated and by June 2006, 25,735 loans and grants of SLRs.4,769 million (US$47 \nmillion) had been provided to micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (RADA, \n2006). The majority of these loans were disbursed in the south and west of the country. \nThe Susahana scheme had reportedly disbursed US$36 million to 8,000 borrowers in \nthe tsunami-affected areas by September 2005. Of these loans, 75 per cent were in the \nsouth and west of the country. 60 per cent of the NDTF scheme was also disbursed in \nthe south, with only 40 per cent going to the north and east of the country (GOSL, \n2005a).   \nUnfortunately,  the  procedures  and  processes  associated  with  loan  approval  and \ndisbursement seemed weighted against those worst-affected by the tsunami, with the \nemphasis placed on ensuring high probability of repayment or loan recovery rather than \non meeting the credit needs of those most in need. Despite claims to the contrary, and \nits stated intention to reach the micro-entrepreneurs, the Susahana lending scheme had \nbeen  set  up  in  a  way  that  made  it  very  difficult  for  small  tsunami-affected  micro-\nentrepreneurs  to  obtain  access  to  the  loans.  The  conditions  for  access  were  quite \nonerous. Guarantors with a permanent income above a certain threshold level were \nrequired before a loan was approved. Collateral was required, for which land within the \nbuffer zone was not acceptable. Loans were only to be given to businesses registered \nbefore  the  tsunami,  which  ruled  out  many  smaller,  unregistered  businesses.  These \nconditions  ruled  out,  in  most  cases,  people  hoping  to  take  up  new  livelihoods  in \nresponse  to  their  changed  post-tsunami  circumstances,  from  causes  such  as,  for \nexample, the death of the main earner, disability, or new responsibilities for the care of \nfamily members.  \nIn fact, it has been acknowledged that the many affected businesses in the buffer zone \nwere hit especially hard because they were unable to access bank credit, and that banks \nhave been reluctant to relax their collateral requirements (GOSL, 2005a). It was also \nfound  that  very  few  new  clients  were  reached  by  the  subsidized  schemes  and  a \n                                                 \n24 The efficiency implications of the misallocation of these fishery assets may be corrected over \ntime as those who were mistakenly given boats etc. may subsequently sell them to genuine fisher \nfolks who can make use of them. But this would not be much consolation for people who had lost \nassets and lack the necessary finances to buy them, even at discount prices.  \n  19", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nconsiderable number of small entrepreneurs were left with no access to credit. The \nsurvey results confirm these findings: Only a few households (16 per cent of the sample) \neven applied for credit. Many households did not apply for loans because they were not \naware that they were eligible to receive them, or because they felt that their applications \nwould be rejected. Most of those who applied did receive a loan, but they had to provide \ncollateral and sometimes a guarantor in order to obtain it. The average size of the loan \nwas fairly small at less than SLRs.100,000 (US$1,000).  \nOn a positive note, there is evidence to suggest that micro-credit providers improved \ncooperation and coordination in an attempt to try to maintain the micro credit culture that \nthe post-tsunami supply of micro-credit funds at low interest rates was in danger of \nundermining. \nIn  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  tsunami,  a  cash  grant  livelihood  assistance \nprogramme  was  announced  in  January  2005,  offering  a  monthly  cash  grant  of \nSLRs.5,000 (US$50) to each tsunami-affected household for a period of four months. \nOver  250,000  households  received  the  first  two  instalments  on  time  immediately \nfollowing the introduction of the programme.25 However, concerns were soon expressed \nin some quarters about the need for proper targeting. The Ministry of Finance Directives \nthen  directed  local  government  officials  to  revise  the  lists  of  eligible  beneficiaries \naccording to a set of eligibility criteria. There were complaints from both affected families \nand even some government officials that the criteria were not very clear, or were not in \nthe public domain. This created much confusion and payments halted at a time of acute \nneed. The government circulars announcing the revised criteria were quite broad. This \nmeant  that  local  government  officers  had  considerable  room  to  exercise  discretion, \nresulting in wide variations in interpretation, allegations of corruption, and delays and \nlong back-logs of appeals. Interviews with relevant stakeholders, including both affected \nfamilies and government officials, suggested that households having access to \u201cregular \nincome\u201d were no longer eligible. It took several months to draw up new lists of those \neligible to receive the grant, with the number of recipients eligible for the third payment \ndeclining by 25 per cent to 165,000 while the fourth monthly payment was still \u201con-going\u201d \na year after the tsunami (GOSL, 2005a).  \nIn assessing the value and benefits of changes to this programme, it should be noted \nthat even households with a \u201cregular\u201d post-tsunami income had suffered a major loss of \nwealth in terms of property and possessions, and were cash poor. There was a high \nprobability that they would have to borrow from high interest, informal sector lenders to \nmeet many pressing needs. The decision to take recipients with a regular income off the \nlist  after  only  two  monthly  payments  generated  perverse  incentives,  effectively \npenalizing not only those who had held on to previous jobs, but perhaps, even more \nimportantly, those who had managed to obtain regular employment after the tsunami. If \ndonor assistance was available for this programme\u2014and it is hard to see why funds \nwere not available if the May 2005 pledges were honoured\u2014these cutbacks seem hard \nto justify. Moreover, since bank accounts had to be opened for the cash grant transfer, \nthe system was extremely cost effective\u2014many other tsunami livelihood projects had far \n                                                 \n25 This  had  some  other  cash  grant  components  too,  including  a  grant  for  a  family  death. \nAccording to the IPS-TS 2005 data (collected in April/May 2005), all surveyed districts had \nreceived funds of SLRs.15,000 for deaths, SLRs.2500 for kitchen equipment, and a SLRs.5000 \nlivelihood grant and food/cash coupon.    \n  20", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nhigher  transactions  costs  with  as  much  as  30  per  cent  spent  on  administrative \noverheads.    \nThis experience with trying to shift the livelihoods grants programme to a targeting \nscheme  only  a  couple  of  months  after  the  disaster  holds  lessons  of  much  wider \napplicability for post-disaster situations. By all accounts, the initial grants scheme was \nvery effective in reaching most of the affected population. It provided cash at a time of \ngreat need, and even helped to link people with little prior engagement to the formal \nfinancial sector because they had to set up bank deposit accounts to receive the funds. \nUnfortunately, the scheme only provided two timely grants before the emphasis shifted \nto targeting. In theory, it seems obvious that grants should be distributed to those who \nare \u201ctruly needy,\u201d and therefore that grants should be properly targeted. But, in practice, \nthe costs of such narrow targeting must also be taken into account. In the immediate \naftermath of a major disaster, particularly in a poor country, the vast majority of affected \npeople are \u201ctruly needy.\u201d Markets are dislocated, assets have been destroyed, and \nrecords are destroyed or missing. In such circumstances, the cost of trying to exclude a \nrelatively small proportion of people from the small temporary grants scheme through \ntargeting can far exceed any benefits.  \nIn Sri Lanka\u2019s case, grants were delayed for all recipients, including those in dire need; \nadministrative resources were diverted away from the urgent tasks of recovery and \nreconstruction,  which  created  room  for  petty  officials  to  engage  in  corruption  and \naggravated community divisions and tensions. Any expected benefits from the rush to \nimplement targeting, only two months after tsunami, must be contemplated in the light of \nthe \u201csuccess\u201d with targeting achieved in Sri Lanka\u2019s long-established national poverty \nalleviation programme (Samurdhi): the leakage in the Samurdhi programme is estimated \nto be 40 per cent!  \n5.1.4 Trauma and Stress \nThe survey found some evidence of mental and physical health problems related to the \ntsunami. About 11 per cent of the households knew someone who had committed \nsuicide because of the tsunami. There were reports of more sleeping difficulties, and \nchildren  experiencing  nightmares  that  were  linked  to  trauma  associated  with  the \ntsunami. A large number of households\u201433 per cent of households in the sample\u2014had \nbeen offered or given counselling for distress. The percentage of people who received \ncounselling  was  higher  in  the  Eastern  Province,  possibly  because  counselling  was \nalready  taking  place  in  those  areas  for  sufferers  of  conflict-related  mental  health \nproblems.   \nTwelve per cent of households had family members who had been injured in the tsunami \nor whose health had deteriorated afterwards: A large proportion of such households (77 \nper cent) claimed that this affected their income-earning capacity and/or day-to-day \nactivities. \nIn many cases, the decline in school attendance after the tsunami has not been fully \nreversed and attendance was reported to be poor even at the end of 2006, with over 25 \nper  cent  of  children  still  not  attending  school  (GOSL,  2006).  These  findings  are \nsupported by the survey; nearly 30 per cent of households reported having children who \nhad not yet restarted schooling after the tsunami. The schooling problem existed in \nareas other than just those affected by conflict, indicating that the problem cannot solely \n  21", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nbe attributed to the conflict. Thirty-one per cent of the households reported that the \nperformance of children who were attending school had fallen.  \n5.2 Assistance \nThere was a strong international public response to the appeal for recovery assistance. \nMultilateral and bilateral donors and NGOs pledged US$3.4 billion for post-tsunami \nrecovery activities at the first Sri Lanka Development Forum held in May 2005 (MFP, \n2005; GOSL, 2006).26 This comprised (concessional) loans amounting to US$798 million \nand the balance in grants. NGOs pledged a total of US$853 million on a grant basis. The \nInternational Monetary Fund pledged US$268 million by way of both emergency relief \nand a debt moratorium. Bilateral donors extended the debt moratorium providing further \nrelief of US$263 million.  \nThe government reported that around US$2.2 billion (of the total pledges of US$2.8 \nbillion, which excluded debt relief) could be considered as firm commitments from the \ninternational community (GOSL, 2005a). In addition, an estimated US$150 million was \nreportedly received as contributions from domestic sources, without taking into account \nrelief disbursements (for which figures are not available). However, actual committed \nfunds made available to the government appear to have fallen over time to US$ 2 billion \nfrom the previous \u201cfirmly committed\u201d figure of US$2.2 billion (Table 12). At the end of the \nsecond year of reconstruction, total foreign grant expenditure relative to commitments \nwas only 35 per cent and foreign loan expenditure was 40 per cent. While individual \nagencies varied in performance, the bilateral and multilateral agencies had spent on \naverage 29 per cent and 32 per cent respectively of committed funds by end 2006. In \naddition, although the initial needs assessment was placed at US$2.2 billion and a total \nof US$2.9 billion was secured as committed funds, the funding gap for the reconstruction \nprocess as at end 2006 was estimated at US$247 million (Table 13). \nTable 12: Sources of Foreign Assistance and Expenditures (US$ million) \n \n  Pledges  Commitments  Expenditure \nInternational NGOs  378  272  171 \nInternational organizations  444  319  76 \nUnited Nations  240  109  65 \nNational NGOs  31  22  9 \nPrivate sector  16  16  7 \nBilaterals  492  912  261 \nMultilaterals/IFIs  339  396  125 \nTotal foreign grants  1,940  2,046  714 \n       \nTotal foreign loans  1,458  940  377 \nGovernment funding  1,462  944  381 \n       \nGrand total  3,402  2,990  1,095 \nNote: IFI=international financial institution \nSource: GOSL (2006).  \n \n                                                 \n26 The US$3.4 billion includes debt relief/moratorium and IMF support. \n  22", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nThis low rate of expenditure (absorption of available assistance) is not surprising and \nhighlights the constraints that hinder rapid reconstruction. Sri Lanka\u2019s past performance \nin aid absorption has been poor: The rate of aid utilization in recent years has been only \naround 20\u201322 per cent, having improved from around 13\u201315 per cent towards the end of \nthe 1990s. Many reasons have been cited for such low levels of aid utilization, including \npolitical interference with regard to planning, implementation and allocation of funds; \nstaffing and related problems in project management; implementation delays (including \ninfrastructure bottlenecks, complex and costly procurement procedures), and excessive \nconditionality imposed by donors. Another important factor has been the non-availability \nof adequate counterpart funds (local funds with appropriation).  \nTable 13: Sector Allocation Overview (US$ million) \n \n  Funding Gap  Commitments  Expenditure \nHousing  107  486  162 \nLivelihood  20  416  186 \nSocial service  85  393  137 \nInfrastructure  35  861  134 \nOther    833  476 \nTotal  247  2,990  1,095 \nSource: GOSL (2006). \n \nDespite  the  initial  euphoria  in  the  aftermath  of  the  tsunami  about  the  volume  and \nadequacy of foreign assistance, it became clear over time that a substantial proportion of \nreconstruction would have to be domestically financed. In 2006, the government had \ncommitted US$1.5 billion in domestic funds (over one-third of total reconstruction costs \nas initially estimated) for tsunami reconstruction. Thus, at the end of two years, two \nproblems with the funding of the reconstruction effort could be identified: the inability of \nthe country to utilise available foreign assistance in a timely manner, and a widening gap \nbetween  the  actual  amount  of  foreign  assistance  received  and  reconstruction \nrequirements.  \n5.3 Delivery and Coordination of Assistance \nCoordination of the relief and reconstruction effort emerged as a key issue from the \nbeginning of the relief effort, and it continued to be a major issue as the reconstruction \nand  recovery  phase  started.  In  Sri  Lanka,  coordination  was  required  across  three \ngroups: (a) among the various government agencies, (b) between the numerous donor \nagencies, and (c) with the LTTE which was in de facto control of a part of the country \nthat was heavily affected by the tsunami. Sri Lanka\u2019s governance structure is such that \nprovincial  government  agencies  have  considerable  powers,  and  this  meant  that \ncoordination was required not only between the various central government agencies, \nbut  also  between  the  central  government  and  local  government  agencies.  The \ninvolvement of major bilateral and multilateral donor agencies naturally required that \ntheir activities be coordinated, both among themselves and with the government. Sri \nLanka has long experience working with major donor agencies and several INGOs \nmaintain long established operations in the country. There had been some welcome \nmoves towards donor coordination even prior to the tsunami in the context of conflict-\nrelated donor reconstruction programmes. Thus, the World Bank, ADB, and JBIC had \nalready  established  a  partnership  that  enabled  a  needs  assessment  to  be  done \nimmediately after the tsunami. However, coordination with donor agencies and NGOs \n  23", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nbecame a vastly more complicated issue due to the numbers and practices of the \nnumerous international NGOs (not counting large numbers of individuals and small \ngroups) who came in after the tsunami. Before long, some 180 NGOs were operating in \nthe tsunami-affected regions of Sri Lanka, making coordination a difficult and complex \ntask. In addition, establishing effective coordination with the LTTE raised difficult and \nsensitive political and constitutional issues.  \nAs  mentioned  previously,  the  government  initially  set  up  a  Centre  for  National \nOperations  (CNO)  and  three  task  forces  to  address  the  coordination  challenge. \nSubsequently, the Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN) became the lead \nagency charged with the task of overseeing the recovery and reconstruction phase.27 \nWhile an overarching authority such as TAFREN was clearly necessary to coordinate \npost-disaster reconstruction, the structure and composition of TAFREN was such that it \nwas not able to be fully effective in that role. TAFREN was dominated by private sector \nrepresentatives, and lacked links to line ministries and clear lines of authority. This \ngreatly  hampered  its  ability  to  efficiently  coordinate  activities  among  government \nagencies. Reconstruction activities had been divided into sectors, such as housing and \nwater and sanitation. This meant that coordination across several agencies, often falling \nunder different ministries, was needed to implement even relatively minor reconstruction \nactivities. For example, three different agencies had to be brought together to ensure \nthat new housing units could get access to water, sanitation, and electricity supplies. \nThough TAFREN attempted to monitor the line agencies and to play a coordinating role \nas  a  \u201cone-stop-shop,\u201d  its  effectiveness  was  limited  because  its  role  and  authority \nremained unclear.  \nIn November 2005, a decision was taken to amalgamate TAFREN, TAFOR, and the \nTask Force for Logistics and Law and Order (TAFLOL) into the Reconstruction and \nDevelopment Authority (RADA). RADA was given wide powers by an Act of Parliament. \nIt was given authority over organizations working on post-tsunami reconstruction and \ndevelopment, and could monitor and control their activities as well as issue \u201clicenses\u201d \nthat would provide legal authority for them to carry out specific activities. In theory, this \nwould enable RADA to exercise efficient coordination. However, potential drawbacks to \nthe vesting of such wide powers in a single, centralised body are that it could overly limit \nthe  powers  of  all  other  agencies and  actors,  ignore  inputs  and  feedback  from  line \nministries and local-level agents, reduce flexibility and scope for local initiatives and \nactions, and make the reconstruction effort too centrally-driven.  \nField observations confirmed that lack of adequate coordination resulted in considerable \nmal-distribution  of  aid.  This  was  clearly  visible,  for  example,  in  the  way  that  the \ndistribution of new boats had been conducted, and\u2014as described in a report by the \nAuditor General\u2014in payment of housing assistance.28 Large payments were made for \nhouses with minor or no damage, NGOs provided houses to families who were not at all \n                                                 \n27 After one month, with the conclusion of immediate relief operations TAFRER and TAFLOL \nwere amalgamated to a single entity\u2014the Task Force for Relief (TAFOR)\u2014to implement all relief \nmeasures, and the operations  of the CNO were scaled down. In February, the CNO  was \ndissolved  and  officials  returned  to  line  ministries.  TAFOR  and  TAFREN  took  over  the \nresponsibilities of the CNO. With the completion of transitional housing, TAFOR was expected to \nwind down operations and its responsibilities passed to the line ministries. \n28 This report on the tsunami rehabilitation covers the period 26 December 2004 to 30 June 2005. \nSee GOSL (2005b). \n \n  24", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \naffected by the tsunami, and government grants were given to people who had already \nreceived houses constructed by NGOs.  \nThe lack of adequate coordination was not only due to weaknesses on the part of the \ngovernment-established coordinating bodies. A major problem was that some NGOs \nwere simply not willing to be \u201ccoordinated,\u201d preferring to act alone pursuing their own \nagendas. INGOs, as well as some domestic NGOs (particularly those with good foreign \nlinks), had access to relatively large amounts of money. With their own funds secure, \nthey saw few incentives to improve coordination. In fact, some were openly hostile to \nany government action that seemed to place \u201ccontrols\u201d on their independence.  \nFurther, the presence of large numbers of donors/NGOs at times led to competitive \nbehaviour. In several places deep mistrust developed between local NGOs (who have \noften been working in the local area for many years) and some INGOs and other foreign \nagencies who came to distribute tsunami assistance. Local NGOs claim to have been \n\u201ccrowded out\u201d by some of the better financially endowed larger INGOs, who \u201cpoached\u201d \nstaff and resources. INGOs varied widely in experience, skills, and operating styles. \nMany \u201cnew\u201d INGOs lacked experience and local knowledge, and in their haste to spend \nfunds and disburse goods and equipment often disregarded local circumstances and \ncommunity needs. Certainly some INGOs and agencies had valuable expertise in large-\nscale disaster relief (such as provision of transitional shelters and other relief measures), \nbut domestic NGOs (and INGOs that have operated in Sri Lanka for a long period) \nusually have a much greater appreciation of local conditions and sensitivities. Greater \ninteraction, engagement and coordination between them would have clearly benefited \nthe overall relief and reconstruction effort. New mechanisms have since been put in \nplace to improve coordination of donor activities at regional and local levels through \nregular meetings and consultations held by regional administrative officers. However, it \nis too early to judge their effectiveness.  \nThe problems caused by some INGOS should not, however, be seen as typical of all \nINGOs. In fact, in many cases INGOs played a very positive role. About 44 per cent of \nthe households surveyed felt that INGOs were more effective in delivering aid, while only \n11 per cent felt that the local NGOs were more effective.  \nCoordination with the LTTE proved to be the most difficult and contentious issue. While \ndiscussions to establish a mechanism for aid-sharing began soon after the tsunami, a \nmutually acceptable arrangement for aid-sharing to enable assistance to flow into the \nLTTE-controlled areas proved elusive. Sections within the government and within the \nmajority community were opposed to any deal that even appeared to provide de facto \nrecognition of the LTTE as the administrative power in regions controlled by it. The \nLTTE, for its part, was unwilling to accept an arrangement that diluted its administrative \nand political power in areas under its control. After long, drawn-out negotiations, a MOU \nsetting out an aid-sharing deal between the GOSL and the LTTE, the Post-Tsunami \nOperation Management Structure (P-TOMS), was signed in June 2005. The P-TOMS \nagreement envisaged the setting up of a Regional Fund to allow donors to channel \ntsunami funds directly to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. A multilateral agency \n(anticipated to be the World Bank) was to be appointed as the custodian.  \nHowever, this agreement promptly ran into political opposition. It was challenged in the \ncourts through a fundamental rights petition and the Supreme Court ruled in July 2005 \n  25", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nthat certain elements were to be put on hold pending clarification,29 though the overall \nmechanism was not unconstitutional. The situation was aggravated further by the fact \nthat several major donors who had supported the idea of a joint mechanism for aid \ndistribution between the GOSL and the LTTE declined to channel aid directly to the \nRegional Fund once the MOU was signed, claiming that the LTTE remains a \u201cproscribed \nterrorist organization\u201d in their countries. After the presidential election in November 2005, \nwith the election of a new President who publicly opposed the agreement, P-TOMS \nbecame totally inoperative. The conflict between the GOSL and the LTTE intensified \nsoon after. The renewed violence disrupted not only the lives of the tsunami-affected \npeople in the area, but also led to a sharp increase in internally displaced persons, \nplacing further pressure on aid agencies. There can be little doubt that these problems \nled to inequitable distribution of aid, with the most severely affected North and East \nmissing out on their fair share. \nWhile these political factors affected the distribution of aid across regions, there has \nbeen no strong evidence of widespread corruption or political influence in the distribution \nof aid within the provinces. Though some petty corruption appears to have affected the \ndistribution of cash grants once targeting was introduced, the overall aid distribution \nappears  to  have  been  reasonably  free  of  overt  political  interference  and  corrupt \npractices. According to the household survey respondents, very few households had \npaid bribes to government or NGO officials to receive aid, and very few were aware of \ninstances where politicians had interfered directly. \n5.4 Cost Escalation \nAs mentioned, at the time of the May 2005 meeting of the Sri Lanka Development Forum, \nthe  aid  promises  of  the  international  community  seemed  to  more  than  cover  all \nreconstruction  financing  needs.  Unfortunately,  there  was  a  fundamental  flaw  in  the \nestimates: They were based on costs and prices that prevailed immediately after the \ntsunami disaster, adjusted for some expected national-level inflation. These estimates \nhave proven to be gross underestimates; clear evidence soon emerged that construction \ncosts were rising rapidly over time. This was, of course, not surprising. The scale of \nconstruction that was envisaged was several times larger than that undertaken in a normal \nperiod,  and  naturally  implied  sharp  increases  in  demand  for  construction  labour  and \nmaterials.30 \nTotal construction costs for the planned houses for tsunami-affected families had already \nrisen by 30\u201350 per cent by August 2005, according to data obtained from companies \nand organizations involved in house building and from field interviews (Table 14). By \nSeptember 2006, costs had exceeded initial estimates by 60\u201380 per cent or more. \n \n                                                 \n29 Specifically, these elements were the Regional Fund and the location of the regional committee \nin the rebel-held Kilinochchi city. \n30 There were varying estimates of the extra demand for house construction, but they all pointed \nto a massive increase in demand for scarce construction labour and materials. According to the \nChamber of Construction Industry, as reported in the Daily Mirror, 21 February 2005, it was \nestimated that at least 100,000 additional workers would be required, including about 13,000 \nmasons, 2,000 carpenters, 2,500 painters, and nearly 54,000 unskilled labourers. \n  26", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nTable 14: Cost Escalation in Housing Construction \nDonor  Unit  Initial  August 2005  September 2006 \nArea  Estimate  Estimate  Comments  Estimate  Comments \n(sq.

Despite added fiscal pressures, there was little effort \nto curtail spending in other areas, fuelling inflationary pressures from policies unrelated \nto tsunami reconstruction.32 Fiscal profligacy in the face of higher spending on tsunami-\nrelated  rehabilitation  aggravated  inflationary  pressures  in  the  economy.  The  initial \nresponse  to  rising  inflationary  pressure  was  slow,  and  interest  rates  remained \nunchanged allowing credit growth to expand at a rate of over 20 per cent.

Elections \nwere due in late 2005 and the government was keen to keep inflation in check. This \ngenerated political pressures to resist any exchange rate depreciation which could have \nintensified domestic  inflation.  There  is  some evidence  to  suggest  that  the  tsunami-\nrelated capital inflows were used to prop up the nominal exchange rate in 2005, and this \nmay have been a factor in the slow absorption of aid flows. There was also a significant \nincrease in inward remittances from 6.7 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 7.7 per cent by 2006. \nWhile some of the increase may reflect assistance provided to affected family and \nfriends, the increase could also reflect better earnings performance of the majority of \nmigrants employed in the oil rich Middle Eastern countries.

As the tsunami-related \ncapital inflows eased over time, the government was compelled to seek other forms of \nexternal funds to finance the expanding fiscal deficit. In December 2005 Sri Lanka \nsought a sovereign credit rating as the first step to raising an estimated US$0.5\u20131 billion \nin the international bond market. Sri Lanka was assigned a BB- (below investment \ngrade) and a B+ by two rating agencies. But, with the escalation in domestic hostilities \nthe credit outlook was downgraded from stable to negative in April 2006. In 2006, for \nexample, the government raised US$580 million by issuing 2\u20133-year maturity dollar \nbonds (Sri Lanka Development Bonds) at rates of 120\u2013140 basis points above the \nLondon Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) despite the inherent risks involved in recourse to \nforeign commercial borrowings.  \nThus, the overall macroeconomic trends raised serious concerns about the sustainability \nof the country\u2019s post-tsunami burst of GDP growth once the temporary aid flows ceased.  \n5.6 Social Cohesion \nThe  spontaneous  solidarity  that  united  communities  immediately  after  the  tsunami \nrekindled hopes that the ethnic divisions that had cost the country so dearly in recent \nyears  might  finally  be  waning.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSIONS \nFor  Sri  Lanka,  facing  a  major  natural  disaster  and  coping  with  the  subsequent \nreconstruction and recovery needs has been a unique experience. In the circumstances, \nthe initial relief effort can be considered a success. An unusually large amount of aid, \nfrom a very large number of organizations, arrived in a very short time. Also, a large \nproportion of aid flowed through individual, private, and nongovernment organisation \nhands instead of through the traditional donor agencies or the United Nations. This \nfacilitated rapid relief and early initiation of reconstruction activities, but also raised \nissues of coordination and aid absorption, and posed some unique challenges. The \nproblems and issues that emerged included:  \n\u2022  Problems related to the absorptive capacity of government and households; \n\u2022  Very high transaction costs and major coordination problems caused by a large \nnumber of donor organizations;  \n\u2022  Rapid increases in demand for labour and raw materials leading to construction \ncost escalation; \n\u2022  Excessive  focus  on  the  quantity  of  aid  disbursement  that  undermined  the \neffectiveness of aid (e.g., mal-distribution, poor quality fishing boats, etc.); \n\u2022  Lack of adequate local capacity to provide the information necessary for effective \ncoordination and monitoring of aid distribution;  \n\u2022  Lack of clear and transparent information-sharing mechanisms between various \ngovernmental and non-governmental agents; and \n\u2022  Differences in levels of assistance provided to tsunami-affected households and \nconflict-affected households in the North and the East.  \n \nIt must also be pointed out that many initial fears about a range of likely problems either \nproved to be not well founded or were resolved effectively. In particular, large-scale \ncorruption did not become a major problem, perhaps because the reconstruction did not \ninvolve large-scale infrastructure projects. Cases of petty corruption were recorded, such \nas officials abusing discretionary powers (for example, determining eligibility for different \ntypes of housing aid and cash grants). In several such cases the government took \ndisciplinary action. There were also fears that large-scale imports of food as aid would \ndepress domestic producer prices and hurt farmers. But the government ensured that \nnew food purchases by the World Food Programme were domestically sourced to help \nfarmers recover and maintain rural incomes. However, the problems with tsunami aid \nallocation  and  distribution  have  aggravated  regional  disparities  and  perceptions  of \nregional/ethnic bias in policy.  \nThere is no doubt that, at the initial relief stage, what is most important is to ensure \ndelivery of basic food, clothing, medicines, and shelter. But aid in kind may not be the \nmost effective mode of assistance later, when markets and links with the rest of the \neconomy have been re-established. Substantial amounts of aid in kind provided later \nwere wasted because they did not meet the requirements or the preferences of the \naffected households. In contrast, cash grants allow households the flexibility to spend on \ngoods and services they actually desire.  \nAnother issue is whether assistance should be narrowly targeted to the \u201cmost needy\u201d \ngroups  only,  or  provided  to  all  affected  people.  The  beneficiary  lists  drawn  up  by \ngovernment agencies not only delayed distribution of grants, but also appeared to be an \ninefficient, corruption-prone process. In principle, systems can be created where the \n  33", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nmost needy \u201cself select,\u201d and these can work fairly effectively in some circumstances. \nBut it is not clear that the savings made justify the costs in delays, the incentives for \ncorruption, and the likelihood that some truly needy groups miss out altogether.  \nA  major  challenge  is  to  devise  appropriate  administrative  mechanisms  to  ensure \neffective cooperation and coordination between central government and local agencies, \nand to ensure that central coordination does not end up stifling local initiatives. Decision-\nmaking in disaster situations requires a complex balance of roles between the central \ngovernment  and  the  locally-affected  areas,  and  the  central  government  must  be \nresponsive to the concerns and feedback from local agents. Sri Lanka initially tended to \nhave an overly centralized system, and there were concerns that local governments \nwere not given enough freedom to make decisions and implement them. Also, the \ncentral government seemed to have rushed to establish new institutions specifically to \ndeal with tsunami-related aid distribution, ignoring or bypassing existing institutions, \nresulting in the reduced effectiveness of reconstruction efforts. \nThe  aftermath  of  the  tsunami  disaster  also  raised  issues  of  macroeconomic \nmanagement that have relevance for any country affected by a major disaster. Sri Lanka \nwas faced with the challenge of absorbing a large, but necessarily temporary, inflow of \nforeign funds. In itself this is a complex and difficult task. But the task was made even \nmore difficult by the need to direct those funds efficiently to emergency relief, and then to \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  damaged  assets  and  infrastructure.  The  initial \nassumption  that  foreign  financing  was  more  than  adequate  for  reconstruction  was \nquickly dispelled as the large-scale reconstruction programme quickly raised demand for \nconstruction inputs that produced steep increases in construction costs. In turn, this \nproduced funding gaps that had to be filled either by the government\u2014widening the \nalready  larger  fiscal  deficit\u2014or  by  additional  foreign  assistance.  Arguably,  the \ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  political  factors  that  slowed  absorption  of  foreign \nassistance may have helped to restrain such cost increases, thereby allowing a larger \nshare of tsunami expenditures to be effective in asset rehabilitation rather than be \ncaptured by construction input owners. Sri Lanka\u2019s experience highlights the need for \nfactoring in such cost increases when assessing needs following major disasters, and \nthe need for formulation of a phased programme of reconstruction which takes into \naccount the supply side constraints on construction inputs.  \n  34", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \n \nReferences \nADB,  JBIC,  and  WB.  2005.

These  consisted  of:  the \nTrincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara districts from the Eastern Province, the Jaffna and \nMullaitivu districts from the Northern Province, and the Hambantota, Matara, and Galle \ndistricts from the Southern Province. \nIn these eight districts, Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs) were first identified where \nmore than 50 per cent of houses were made unusable due to being completely or \nseverely damaged using Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) data.       \nThe 16 GNDs for the study were distributed across the eight districts based on the level \nof housing damage in each district (Table A.1). Within the districts, GNDs were chosen \nbased on socio-economic data so as to select a representative set of GNDs considering \nethnicity, religion, livelihoods, and the location with respect to the 2005 buffer zone (the \n\u201cno-build\u201d zone). Socio-economic data for this purpose were obtained from the 2001 \nCensus by the DCS for the Southern districts. Since census data did not extend to the \ndistricts in the Eastern and the Northern provinces, socio-economic information for these \nprovinces  was  obtained  through  key  informants  from  those  areas.  Key  informant \ninformation was also used to select GNDs with households both within and outside the \n2005 buffer zone. (Information given by key informants in this regard was not entirely \naccurate,  and,  as  a  result,  some  GNDs  that  were  mostly  within  the  no-build  zone \nremained in the sample).  \nTable A.1: Distribution of GNDs across Selected Districts \n \nDistrict  Number of Unusable  No. of GNDs \nHouses  Selected for Survey \nJaffna  3,686  1 \nMullaitivu  5,137  1 \nTrincomalee  4,643  2 \nBatticaloa  9,905  4 \nAmpara  10,566  4 \nHambantota  1,290  1 \nMatara  2,401  1 \nGalle  6,169  2 \nNote: Information from Mullaitivu was not available for the selection process \nA  sample  of  45  households  from  the  list  of  unusable  houses  for  each  GND  was \nrandomly selected for the household survey, with 30 households outside the no-build \nzone and 15 within. However, in some GNDs there were less than 30 houses outside the \nbuffer zone. In these instances, more households from within the buffer zone were \ninterviewed to make up the sample. The households were selected using DCS tsunami \ncensus data where available. For the two GNDs where DCS data were not available, \nhousehold lists obtained from Grama Niladharis (GNs) were used as a frame. \nDue to delays in obtaining access, the survey could not cover the Jaffna and Mullaitivu \ndistricts of the Northern Province. Therefore, information is available only for 14 GNDs in \nthe Southern and Eastern provinces. Information from the selected GNDs was collected \n  36", "ADBI Discussion Paper 75  Weerakoon, Jayasuriya, Arunatilake, and Steele \nat several levels in April 2005. To obtain community-level perspectives on rebuilding, \nrelocation, and land issues, focus groups were conducted in all GNDs. In addition, \ncommunity-level information to ascertain community characteristics and information on \nrebuilding, relocation, and land issues was obtained through key informant interviews \nbased on a structured questionnaire. In addition to these interviews, information on land \nsupply in the GNDs was obtained from the relevant Divisional Secretary\u2019s Office, also \nbased on a structured questionnaire. The household-level interviews were conducted \nusing a structured household questionnaire. The questionnaires were drafted in English \nand translated to Sinhala and Tamil for use in different GNDs. \nIn  July  2006,  an  attempt  was  made  to  resurvey  all  the  622  households  that  were \ninterviewed for the April 2005 survey with the view to gaining updated information on the \nprogress of the reconstruction effort. The survey was designed to address issues of \npermanent housing paucity, recovery in livelihoods, etc., to get a clearer picture of where \nSri Lanka stood in the reconstruction process one and a half years after the tsunami \ndisaster. In addition to the housing survey, three key informant interviews in each GND \nwere  conducted.  When  a  household  could  not  be  located,  randomly  selected \nreplacement houses were surveyed from the GND. The resulting database consisted of \n595 households, of which 564 were from the original 622 households. \n  37"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070830084133Z", "ModDate": "D:20070830164508+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0 (Windows)", "Author": "f2i", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Cover page_Sri Lanka.doc"}}
