\nbetween 31 August and 6 November, while 10-year \nbond yield movements were mixed due to individual \nmarket differences.1 Global financial conditions improved \nduring the review period as investment sentiment was \nboosted by the enhanced performance of key advanced \neconomies in the third quarter (Q3) of 2020. However, \nsome caution remained as confirmed coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) cases rose in many advanced economies and \nuncertainty about the global economic recovery lingered.\n\nBetween 31 August and 6 November, 2-year and  \n10-year bond yields rose in the United\u00a0States\u00a0(US)  \nand declined in other developed economies (Figure A).  \nIn the US, 2-year and 10-year government bond yields \nrose by 2 basis points (bps) and 11 bps, respectively. The \nuptick in yields was largely due to expectations of a new \nphase of spending on pandemic relief despite uncertainty \nregarding the timing and size of the stimulus package \nfollowing the US\u00a0election.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve noted that the US economy \nshowed signs of recovery during Q3 2020 and left \nmonetary policy unchanged at its September meeting, it \nalso acknowledged uncertainty regarding the impact of \nCOVID-19. US\u00a0economic data have been mixed. Retail \nsales growth contracted to 0.6% month-on-month in \nOctober from 1.6% month-on-month in September, and \nthe unemployment rate fell to 6.9% in October from \n7.9% in September. Gains in nonfarm payrolls, however, \ndeclined to 672,000 in September and 638,000 in \nOctober from 1.5 million in\u00a0August.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also upgraded its 2020 gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth forecast to \u20133.7%  \nin September from \u20136.5% in June, and it revised \ndownward the GDP growth forecasts for 2021 and  \n2022 from 5.0%\u00a0and 3.5%, respectively, to 4.0%  \nand 3.0%. \n\nAt the press conference following the Federal Reserve \nmeeting, Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that it \n\nNov-19\n\nJan-20 Mar-20 May-20\n\nJul-20\n\nSep-20\n\nNov-20\n\neuro area\n\nJapan\n\nUK\n\nUS\n\nUK = United Kingdom, US = United States.\nNote: Data as of 6 November 2020.\nSource: Bloomberg LP.\n\nwould take time for the US economy to return to its pre-\nCOVID-19 output level and that additional fiscal support \nwould be required. The Federal Reserve subsequently \nalso left its monetary policy stance unchanged during its \n4\u20135\u00a0November meeting.\n\nIn line with the Federal Reserve, the European Central \nBank (ECB) left its monetary policy unchanged at \nits monetary policy meeting on 10 September. The \nECB also noted some improvement in economic \nperformance in the euro area, but remained cautious \nover uncertainty associated with COVID-19. The ECB\u2019s \nforecast for 2020 GDP growth was revised upward \nto \u20138.0% in September from \u20138.7% in June, while the \n2021 and 2022 GDP forecasts were lowered slightly \nto 5.0% and 3.2%, respectively, from 5.2% and 3.3%. \nThe euro area\u2019s economic recovery remained weak, \nas industrial production declined 6.8% year-on-year \n(y-o-y) in September and fell 6.7% y-o-y in August. \nThe recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the euro area also \nheightened uncertainty over the economic recovery, while \nexpectations of further monetary easing pulled bond \nyields down in the euro area.\n\n1\u2002Emerging East Asia comprises the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet\u00a0Nam.\u00a0\n\n\f2\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nIn line with the ECB\u2019s forecasts, the euro area\u2019s GDP \ngrowth improved in Q3 2020, with GDP expanding \n12.6%\u00a0quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in Q3 2020 after \ndeclining 11.8% q-o-q in the prior quarter. However, \non a y-o-y basis, GDP growth was negative at \u20134.4% in \nQ3\u00a02020, which was still an improvement from a decline \nof \u201314.8% posted in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020.\n\nDuring its 29 October monetary policy meeting, the ECB \nagain left its monetary policy unchanged. However, the \nECB noted that rising COVID-19 cases were dampening \ngrowth and initial data suggested that fourth quarter \ngrowth would be weaker. The ECB also hinted that \nit might ease monetary policy in December when its \neconomic forecasts are updated.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) also left its monetary \npolicy unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on \n17\u00a0September. While the BOJ noted some gains in \nthe domestic economy\u2019s performance, the recovery is \nconsidered to be delicate. Japan\u2019s 2-year and 10-year \nyields marginally fell 1 bp each, despite expectations of \nexpanded stimulus that could increase the debt supply \nto fund spending. The BOJ again left its monetary policy \nunchanged on 29 October. Updated economic forecasts \nfrom the BOJ showed a downgrade in 2020 GDP growth \nto \u20135.8% from \u20134.7% in July. The GDP forecast for 2021 \nwas adjusted upward to 3.6% from 3.3%. However, the \n\nTable A: Changes in Global Financial Conditions\n\nBOJ noted that the forecasts were highly uncertain given \nthe impact of COVID-19. Japan posted an annualized \nquarterly GDP growth of 21.4% in Q3 2020 from \u201328.8% \nin Q2\u00a02020.  However, concerns that the gains may not \nbe sustained led to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to call \nfor a third extra budget.\n\nBetween 31 August and 6 November, yields on 2-year \ngovernment bonds fell in most emerging East Asian \nmarkets, while 10-year bond yield movements were mixed \n(Table A). The declining short-term bond yields reflected \nthe accommodative monetary policies of most central \nbanks in the region.\n\nAll emerging East Asian markets except the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam recorded \ncontractions in Q3 2020 GDP. However, while all \nother emerging East Asian economies recorded GDP \ncontractions in Q3 2020, the pace of decline moderated \ncompared with Q2 2020. The most significant \nimprovement was noted in Malaysia as GDP declined to \n\u20132.7% y-o-y in Q3 2020 from \u201317.1% y-o-y in Q2\u00a02020 \nbuoyed by the easing of quarantine restrictions. In \nSingapore, advance estimates showed that GDP \ncontraction slowed to \u20137.0% y-o-y in Q3 2020 from \n\u201313.3% y-o-y in Q2 2020, fuelled by the recovery in the \nmanufacturing sector.

In contrast, Viet Nam experienced an \neconomic recovery in Q3 2020, with GDP growth rising \nto 2.6%\u00a0y-o-y from 0.4% y-o-y in Q2 2020, buoyed by \nstrong exports. The PRC\u2019s GDP expanded 3.2% y-o-y in \nQ2 2020, and accelerated to 4.9% y-o-y in Q3 2020, the \nfastest growth rate among all regional markets.\n\nIndonesia, 10-year government bond yields fell by 57\u00a0bps \nduring the review period amid efforts by BI to boost \nliquidity through macroprudential measures that included \nlowering banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios and increasing \ncentral bank bond purchases, among others. Foreign bond \ninflows in October also helped push down rates. Viet\u00a0Nam \nposted a decline of 32 bps between 31\u00a0August and \n6\u00a0November, as SBV reduced policy rates on 1 October to \nsupport the economy. In Singapore and Thailand, 10-year \nyields fell 23 bps and 11 bps, respectively.\n\nTo support economic recovery, regional central banks are \nexpected to maintain their accommodative monetary \nstances. During the review period, all regional central \nbanks held their policy rates steady, while the State Bank \nof Vietnam (SBV) further reduced its refinancing rate by \n50 bps to 4.00% on 1 October to support the economy. \nOn 19 November, both Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and \nBank Indonesia (BI) reduced their respective policy rates \nby 25 bps each. From January through 20 November, \nemerging East Asia\u2019s central banks lowered policy rates, \nwith a few central banks cumulatively cutting policy rates \nby 100 bps or more, including Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \n(200 bps), SBV (200 bps), BI (125 bps), and Bank Negara \nMalaysia (125 bps) (Table\u00a0B). \n\nThe movement of 10-year bond yields depended \nlargely on market-specific factors as well as individual \ngovernment responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe weak economic outlook and subdued inflation were \nreflected in long-term bond yields across the region. In \n\nThe PRC\u2019s bond market continued to buck the regional \ntrend on the back of the domestic economic recovery, \nwith the 2-year government bond yield gaining 38 bps \nbetween 31 August and 6 November, and the 10-year \nyield rising 18 bps. In the Philippines, the 10-year yield \nrose 19 bps due to an expected higher budget deficit \nin 2021 as well as increased government borrowing. In \nMalaysia, the 10-year yield rose 8 bps. A few markets \nwitnessed a marginal change in the 10-year government \nbond yield, including the Republic of Korea (4 bps) and \nHong Kong, China (\u20134 bps).\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nCOVID-19 continues to cast a dark cloud over global \neconomic prospects.

While there has been some progress in the \ndevelopment of treatments and vaccines, there is still a lot \nof uncertainty about when safe and effective treatments, \nand especially vaccines, will become widely available.\n\nThe bottom line is that the world is not out of the \nwoods on the health front, which largely explains \nwhy a full-fledged global recovery is nowhere in \nsight yet. The unprecedented restrictions on the \nmovement of individuals due to lockdowns, community \nquarantines, stay-at-home orders, and travel bans is \ncrimping economic activity. Even when authorities \nrelax restrictions, plenty of anecdotal evidence\u2014such \nas Google community mobile data\u2014indicates that \nindividuals are often reluctant to venture outside over \nconcerns that they may become infected. Furthermore, \nauthorities have sometimes been forced to reintroduce \nstringent restrictions in response to a second wave\u2014that \nis, a large increase in confirmed cases after a period of \nstabilization and decline. While the reintroduction is \nnecessary to safeguard public health, it inevitably has a \nnegative impact on economic activity in the short term.\n\nBoth the US and Europe have recently begun to \nexperience a second wave of COVID-19. Europe, in \nparticular, is experiencing a spike in new infections despite \nhaving tackled the first wave much more effectively than \nthe US. In response, the governments of many European \ncountries, including big economies\u2014such as Germany, \nFrance, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain\u2014have \nreintroduced various restrictions. There are growing \nconcerns that Europe may experience a double-dip \nrecession as the restrictions will hinder mobility and \neconomic activity, causing a second recession just when \nthe region had been recovering from the prior one. \nEurope\u2019s economy may contract in the fourth quarter \nof 2020 instead of growing at a healthy pace, as was \nwidely expected before the second wave. Until a safe and \neffective COVID-19 vaccine is developed and distributed \nwidely, the viral cloud of fear and uncertainty will limit \nglobal mobility and\u00a0growth. \n\nDespite the gloomy and uncertain economic outlook, \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slightly \n\nupgraded its short-term global growth forecast. In its \nWorld\u00a0Economic Outlook, released in October 2020, the \nIMF forecast that the world economy would contract \nby 4.4% in 2020, whereas in June it had forecast a \nlarger contraction of 5.2%. According to projections, the \nworld economy will grow by 5.2% in 2021, slightly down \nfrom its June forecast of 5.4%. The\u00a0improvement in the \nforecast for the global economy\u2019s contraction in 2020 \nwas driven by substantially upgraded growth projections \nfor advanced economies. The IMF is now forecasting a \ncontraction of 5.8% for this group of countries in 2020, \ncompared to a significantly bigger contraction of 8.1% \nin its June forecast. On the other hand, for emerging \nmarkets and developing economies, the IMF\u2019s 2020 \ngrowth forecast was \u20133.3% in October versus \u20133.1% in \nJune. For 2021, the IMF\u2019s October growth forecast for \nadvanced economies was 3.9%, down from its 4.8% \nforecast in June. Its October forecast for growth of 6.0% \nin 2021 for emerging markets and developing economies \nwas slightly up from the 5.8% forecast in June. It remains \nto be seen whether the second wave of COVID-19 and \nthe reintroduction of restrictions in advanced economies, \nespecially Europe, will perceptibly affect global growth \noutcomes in 2020 and 2021.\n\nDeveloping Asia is not immune to the negative economic \nimpact of COVID-19, but the impact is noticeably smaller \nthan in the rest of the world. Partly, this is due to the \nfact that the region has done a relatively good job of \ncontaining the pandemic. Although some Asian countries, \nmost notably India, have suffered major outbreaks, \nAsia has mostly weathered the COVID-19 storm better \nthan other regions. This is especially true in East Asia, \nparticularly the PRC, where everyday life is returning to \na semblance of normalcy as a result of the remarkable \nsuccess in containing the disease. In fact, the PRC is the \nlone bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economic \nlandscape. Its economy grew by a healthy 4.9% y-o-y in \nQ3 2020 after an expansion of 3.2% in Q2 2020 and a \nhistoric contraction in the first quarter. \n\nAccording to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Outlook Update, released in September \n2020, the PRC\u2019s economy is expected to grow by \n1.8% in 2020 and 7.7% in 2021. The corresponding \nfigures for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) are \u20133.8% and 5.5%; for the Republic of \nKorea, the expected growth rates are \u20131.0%\u00a0and 3.3%; \nand for Hong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China, the respective figures are \n\u20136.5% and\u00a05.1%. Output in developing Asia as a whole is \n\n\fprojected to shrink by 0.7% in 2020 before expanding \nby 6.8% in 2021. The PRC\u2019s recovery is contributing to \nthe resilience of other ASEAN+3 economies that trade \nheavily with the PRC, especially since the PRC\u2019s growth \nappears to be increasingly broad-based.2 In particular, \nretail sales, a good bellwether of domestic demand, \nhave risen since August after contracting during the first \n7\u00a0months of the year. \n\nNotwithstanding some positive trends, including the \ngathering momentum of the PRC\u2019s recovery, the overall \neconomic outlook for ASEAN+3 remains subject to a \ngreat deal of uncertainty. The fundamental reason is \nthat the global economic outlook will remain uncertain \nand negative until there is some clarity on when and if \nCOVID-19 will recede. The second wave of new cases, \nwhich is forcing European governments to reintroduce \nrestrictions that restrict mobility and hamper economic \nactivity, is a stark reminder that the virus can derail \neconomic recovery at any time until it is firmly brought \nunder control. Until then, economic recovery is more \nlikely to be an intermittent and fitful stop-and-go process \nrather than a smooth continuous one. Furthermore, \nmany negative effects of the pandemic\u2014such as large-\nscale unemployment and business closures\u2014are likely \n\nFigure B.1: Equity Indexes in Emerging East Asia\n\nGlobal and Regional Market Developments  \u20035\n\nto\u00a0persist for some time.\n\nAs economic performance in major advanced economies \nstrengthened and the results of the US election became \nmore clear, investor sentiment improved on expectations \nof an additional stimulus package in the US. Most equity \nmarkets in emerging East Asia posted gains during \nthe review period (Figure B.1). Among regional equity \nmarkets, the Philippines gained the most with a 13.6% \nincrease, as the economy showed signs of recovery with \nthe easing of social restrictions. In Viet Nam, the equity \nmarket rose 6.4% as the government was successful in \ngradually lifting restrictions put in place in response to \nthe COVID-19 outbreak. In contrast, declines in equity \nmarkets were noted in Thailand (\u20133.9%), which was \ndriven by rising political concerns, and in the PRC (\u20132.5%) \n(Figure B.2)\n\nFrom August through October, investment sentiment \nwas subdued amid rising COVID-19 cases in Europe \nand uncertainty related to the US election, which led \nto capital outflows from the region\u2019s equities markets. \nInflows, however, were noted in early November, buoyed \nby strong inflows in the markets of the PRC and the \nRepublic of Korea (Figure\u00a0C). The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas significantly shaped global capital flows.

In addition, central banks around the world have \neased monetary policies, with many EME central banks \nimplementing quantitative easing (QE) measures for the first \ntime. Recent Asian Development Bank Institute research \nexamined the impact of COVID-19 on bond yields, stock \nprices, and exchange rates for a sample of 38 advanced \nand emerging markets (Beirne et al. 2020). In addition, \nthe effect of the pandemic on EME equity and bond flows \nacross 14 EMEs was assessed. This research also estimated \nthe effectiveness of COVID-19-related policy responses on \nfinancial markets and capital flow dynamics.\n\nFigure B1 demonstrates that COVID-19 has had the greatest \nrelative effect on sovereign bond markets across both \nadvanced and emerging economies. In addition, based on \nan empirical analysis over the period from 4 January 2010 to \n30\u00a0April 2020, Beirne et al. (2020) show that the magnitude \nof the effect of COVID-19 on financial markets is notably \nhigher for emerging rather than advanced economies by a \nfactor of around two across bond, stock, and exchange rate \nmarkets. In particular, bond yields in European and Asian EMEs \nare estimated to have declined by 24 basis points (bps) and \n14 bps over the sample period, respectively, due to COVID-19. \nWhile EME bond yields rose sharply at the onset of COVID-19, \ncoupled with substantial net capital outflows, it is striking that \nthe overall effect on bond yields was negative, which may seem \ncounterintuitive since an increase in COVID-19 cases might \nbe expected to worsen financial market turmoil and increase \nsovereign bond yields. There are two explanations for why the \noverall effect on bond yields was negative. First, government \nbonds were perceived as safer assets than corporate bonds \ngiven that the corporate sector, with few exceptions, was \nvery heavily affected by COVID-19 lockdowns. With many \nbusinesses fighting for survival, sovereign bonds were seen as \nthe better alternative, even if the crisis also cast questions on \nthe sustainability of public debt. Second, the crisis gave way \nto extremely accommodative central bank policies in most \neconomies, with slashes in interest rates and new rounds \nof QE policies in all major advanced economies. Turning to \nthe impact on stock markets, the greatest relative impact \nof COVID-19 is estimated to have been in advanced Asian \neconomies and Latin America, whose markets plunged sharply. \n\nFigure B1: Relative Impact of COVID-19 on  \nFinancial Markets and Capital Flows\n\nAll Advanced Economies\n\nAdvanced Europe\n\nAdvanced Asia\n\nAll EMEs\n\nEmerging Europe\n\nEmerging Asia\n\nLatin America\n\n\u2013100 \u201380\n\n\u201360\n\n\u201320\n\n0\n\n20\n\n\u201340\n%\n\nSovereign bond yields\nEquity \ufb02ows\n\nStock prices\nBond \ufb02ows\n\nExchange rates\n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, EMEs = emerging market economies.\nNote: The estimation period runs from 4 January 2010 to 30 April 2020, \nwith COVID-19 defined as the number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 \ncases per one million population. The statistically significant coefficients for \nthe COVID-19 variable are reported via a panel regression that uses each of \nthe asset markets and capital flows as dependent variables, expressed as a \npercentage relative to the total. These results are consistent with an updated \nestimation by the authors over the period from 4 January 2010 to 31 August \n2020.\nSource: J. Beirne, N. Renzhi, E. Sugandi, and U. Volz. 2020.

Tokyo: Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute.\n\nOn exchange rates, advanced Asian economies were most \naffected in relative terms, experiencing currency depreciations \ndue to COVID-19, although the magnitude of these effects \nwas not as large overall when compared to the effects on \nstock and bond markets. With regard to EME capital flows, \nCOVID-19 has led to significant outflows of both equities and \nbonds, reflecting investors\u2019 flight to safety.\n\nWhile there has been substantial heterogeneity across  \nregions in the magnitude of the effects of COVID-19 on \nmarkets, the results in Beirne et al. (2020) show that this has \nalso been the case in relation to the effectiveness of policy \nresponses. Compared to EMEs, fiscal stimulus packages in \nadvanced economies have had around twice the impact in \nterms of compressing sovereign bond yields. On monetary \npolicy, while interest rate reductions passed through along \nthe yield curve with similar magnitudes in both advanced \nand emerging economies, the impact on bond yields due to \nQE was statistically significant for advanced economies only. \nHowever, the advanced economy QE measures spilled over  \nto EMEs, reducing EME bond yields by around 27 bps.  \n\na \n\n This box was written by John Beirne (Research Fellow) of the Asian Development Bank Institute and Ulrich Volz (Director of the SOAS Centre for Sustainable Finance) of the \nSOAS University of London.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fGlobal and Regional Market Developments  \u20037\n\nBox 1:  Global Financial Markets and Capital Flows: COVID-19 Impacts and Policy Responses \n\ncontinued\n\nAs regards stock markets, interest rate reductions were more \neffective in advanced compared to emerging economies by a \nfactor of around two. In addition, QE measures in advanced \neconomies, as well as spillovers to EMEs, helped to boost \ndomestic stock prices by around 12% and 16%, respectively. \nMoreover, QE by central banks in emerging Asia helped to \nincrease stock prices by around 6%. The impact of fiscal \npolicy on stock markets was confined to European advanced \neconomies and EMEs overall, increasing stock prices by an \naverage of around 8%. At the global level, while the magnitude \nof the effect of policy responses on exchange rates was \nmuch lower than in other markets, QE measures in EMEs led \nto a rise in net capital inflows by around 14% in the case of \nequities and around 16% in the case of bonds. Moreover, fiscal \nstimulus packages in EMEs increased net equity inflows by \naround 9%.\n\nOverall, although heightened uncertainty due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has affected the financial markets \nof EMEs more detrimentally than advanced economies, \nit appears that most EMEs have performed well in their \npolicy responses to the pandemic. Whereas fiscal stimulus \npackages have contributed to restoring confidence in \ndomestic financial markets, QE policy measures and interest \nrate reductions have also been effective in Asian economies \nby supporting stock prices. Notably, these measures also \n\nhelped to stabilize capital flows. The scale of bond and \nequity capital outflows from EMEs highlights the importance \nof strengthening the domestic investor base to be less reliant \non international portfolio investment. The COVID-19 crisis \nhas illustrated the need for concerted efforts at bolstering \ndomestic financial resource mobilization in EMEs and \nfor reducing exposure to international portfolio capital \nand financial contagion. The extent of capital outflows \nalso strengthens the case for reviving discussions around \nthe management of capital flows and the development \nof a global financial safety net. It\u00a0is important for EMEs \nto develop further their overall policy toolkits to respond \nto spikes in financial market volatility and crisis episodes, \nnotably with the use of QE measures. With conventional \nmonetary policy having easing limits and fiscal policy space \nconstrained by excessive public debt, using QE\u00a0policies can \nbe a potent stimulator in domestic markets, particularly \nwhere inflation expectations are contained and exchange \nrates are flexible. \n\nReferences\n\nJ.

As of 7 October, \nASEAN as a whole had suffered over 500,000 confirmed \ncases and over 10,000 deaths. To contain the pandemic, \nthe region\u2019s governments imposed various restrictions\u2014\nlockdowns, community quarantines, and travel bans\u2014which \nlimited the mobility of people within and across countries.  \nAs a result, the region was hit hard economically. According to \nthe forecast of the Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update, \nwhich was released in September 2020, the 10\u00a0economies of \nASEAN will collectively shrink by 3.8% in 2020, although they \nwill bounce back into positive territory with growth of 5.5% \nin 2021. In addition to the COVID-19-related restrictions, \nthe dire global outlook is another major factor in the region\u2019s \nsevere economic downturn.\n\nASEAN\u2019s relatively high level of economic globalization, in \nterms of both trade and capital flows, suggests that COVID-19 \nmay adversely affect not only the region\u2019s economic \ngrowth but also its financial stability. The region suffered a \ndevastating blow during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis as \na result of a sudden and sharp reversal of capital flows. Since \nthen, ASEAN economies have strengthened fundamentals to \nprotect themselves from another financial crisis. These robust \nfundamentals served ASEAN well during the 2007\u20132009 \nglobal financial crisis, which had only a limited impact on the \nregion\u2019s financial stability. Nevertheless, the unprecedented \nscale and global nature of the COVID-19 shock, in \nconjunction with the region\u2019s relative financial openness, \nposes a clear and present danger to financial stability. The \nglobal financial market turmoil of March 2020 also affected \nASEAN economies, as evident in the tangible depreciation \nof their currencies (Figure B2.1). Financial conditions have \nsubsequently turned more benign in ASEAN and the rest of \nthe world. Nevertheless, if the pandemic persists, instability \nmay return to financial markets.\n\nA major contribution to the restoration of financial stability \nin ASEAN in 2020 has been the concerted implementation \n\nFigure B2.1: Depreciation of Select ASEAN  \nCurrencies vs. the United States Dollar,  \n1 January\u201323 March 2020 (%)\n\nVND\n\nTHB\n\nSGD\n\nPHP\n\nMYR\n\nIDR\n\n\u201316.34\n\n\u20131.61\n\n\u20131.32\n\n\u20138.13\n\n\u20137.95\n\n\u20138.01\n\n%\n\n\u201318\n\n\u201316\n\n\u201314\n\n\u201312\n\n\u201310\n\n\u20138\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20132\n\n0\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, IDR = Indonesian rupiah, \nMYR = Malaysian ringgit, PHP = Philippine peso, SGD = Singapore dollar,  \nTHB = Thai baht, VND = Vietnamese dong.\nSource: Bloomberg LP.\n\nof expansionary monetary policy. Like their counterparts \nelsewhere, the central banks of ASEAN have cut benchmark \ninterest rates decisively (Figure B2.2). They have also taken \nother measures to inject additional liquidity into their financial \nsystems. These include reducing reserve requirement ratios, \ncreating funds for lending to firms, implementing temporary \nsuspensions of interest repayments, and relaxing payment \nconditions for loans related to COVID-19. In addition, ASEAN \ngovernments have launched fiscal stimulus packages to \nsupport growth and protect vulnerable groups. Such fiscal \nstimulus indirectly supports financial stability by boosting \ngrowth and thus preventing a rise in business closures and \nnonperforming loans. At the same time, stimulus expands \nfiscal deficits and public debt, which can eventually pose \na risk to financial stability. While these strong domestic \npolicy measures are the primary defense against financial \nturbulence, regional financial safety nets can also make a \nsignificant contribution.\n\nRegional financial safety nets matter because there can \nbe significant spillovers across the region from major \nshocks. This was painfully evident during the 1997/98 Asian \nfinancial crisis. In response to that crisis, ASEAN created the \nASEAN+3 financial cooperation initiative.c The Chiang Mai \nInitiative Multilateralization (CMIM) process emerged in \n\na \n\n This box was written by Donghyun Park (Principal Economist) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Pitchaya Sirivunnabood (Capacity Building and Training Economist) of \nthe ADB Institute, and Santi Setiawati (Intern) of the ADB Institute.\n\nb  Unless otherwise stated, data for ASEAN in this box include the markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\nc  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of ASEAN plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fGlobal and Regional Market Developments  \u200311\n\nBox 2: The Effect of COVID-19 on Financial Stability in ASEAN\u2003continued\n\nFigure B2.2: Policy Rate Changes in Select ASEAN \nEconomies, 31 December 2019\u20137 October 2020 (bps)\n\n\u201375\n\nThailand\n\n\u2013100\n\n\u2013125\n\n\u2013175\n\n\u2013200\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nViet Nam\n\n\u2013250\n\n\u2013200\n\n\u2013150\n\n\u2013100\n\n\u201350\n\n0\n\nbasis points\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, bps = basis points. \nNote: Negative value denotes reduction of policy rate.\nSource: Various central bank websites.\n\nMarch 2010 under the ASEAN+3 initiative as a network of \nbilateral swap arrangements amounting to USD120 billion. \nCMIM\u2019s implementation and surveillance processes are \nbeing strengthened to improve its effectiveness and speed in \ntackling financial crisis. \n\nSeparately, the ASEAN Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance \n(ADRFI) scheme is being developed to strengthen regional \nfinancial resilience in the context of climate change and \nnatural hazards. The comprehensive framework is designed to \nequip ASEAN member countries with risk management and \nrisk transfer capabilities. ADFRI will enable them to overcome \nthe financial burden caused by extreme events through both \nex-ante and ex-post arrangements.\n\nASEAN has yet to develop a regional mechanism for the \nCOVID-19 pandemic crisis or similar shocks. The policy gap \n\nin both the CMIM and ADRFI initiatives for dealing with \ntransnational disease outbreaks includes the lack of technical \nand financial capacity building and public health sector \ncooperation among ASEAN countries. This includes funding \nhospitals and medical clinics; health care training for lower-\nincome countries; and the stockpiling of medicines, alcohol, \nsurgical masks, vaccines, and other emergency equipment \nto quickly tackle the spread of a transnational disease. \nAt the global and regional levels, international financial \ninstitutions have also supported countries affected by the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. The International Monetary Fund uses \nthe Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to support \nits member countries, while multilateral development banks \nlike the Asian Development Bank are supporting countries\u2014\nincluding Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia\u2014through \ngrants and loans. Although this financial support is helpful, \nit is nowhere near enough to respond to a systemic \nfinancial\u00a0crisis.\n\nAppropriate and timely policies supported by regional \ncooperation can reduce the negative economic impacts of \nthe pandemic. We propose three policy recommendations. \nFirst, the establishment of an ASEAN task force on \npandemics would facilitate the coordination and alignment \nof policy responses among member countries. A regional \nframework for policy responses can create public trust \nand promote transparency. Second, the building-up of \nan ASEAN pandemic network\u2014consisting of hospitals, \nhealthcare workers, pharmaceutical companies, and research \ninstitutions\u2014is needed to share information and knowledge \non healthcare resources for mitigating pandemic-related \nshocks and preparing financing schemes. Third, regional \nfinancial safety nets must be strengthened, including their \nrole in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and other similar \nshocks to financial stability.\n\n\f12\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nBox 3: Local Currency Bond Markets and Exchange Rate Risks\n\nThe 1997/98 Asian financial crisis underlined the importance \nof developing local currency (LCY) bond markets to boost \nfinancial resilience.a LCY bond markets mobilize private sector \nsavings into long-term investments, while also mitigating \ncurrency and maturity mismatches in the balance sheets of \npublic and private institutions. LCY bond markets absorb \ncapital inflows, thereby contributing to financial stability.b \nPark, Shin, and Tian (2018) showed that LCY bond markets \nalso play a significant role in stabilizing currencies against \nexternal shocks.c\n\nIn recent decades, LCY bond markets in emerging Asian \neconomies have expanded rapidly, catching up to European \nLCY markets in size. Since the Asian Bond Markets Initiative \nwas launched in 2002 by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) and the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, \nand the Republic of Korea\u2014a grouping collectively known as \nASEAN+3\u2014regional LCY bond markets have experienced \nrapid growth. As of June 2020, LCY bonds outstanding in \nemerging East Asia had reached USD17.2 trillion, a more \nthan 14-fold increase since 2002. Furthermore, LCY bonds \noutstanding as a share of the region\u2019s gross domestic product \nreached 91.6% in 2020. The rapid development of regional \nLCY bond markets has reduced financial vulnerability to \nsudden capital flow reversals, as evidenced by the resilience \nof the region\u2019s financial systems and economies during the \n2007\u20132009 global financial crisis and the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d \nin\u00a02013. \n\nWell-developed LCY bond markets allow domestic borrowers \nto tap LCY funding when exchange rates are volatile, \nthus mitigating currency risk in investments and project \nimplementation. Figure B3.1 confirms that demand for LCY \nfinancing in Asia rose in recent years when exchange rates \nwere more volatile.\n\nCurrency depreciation adversely affects balance sheets in \nboth the public and private sectors, especially when exposure \nto foreign currency financing is large. When a domestic \ncurrency weakens, it becomes more costly to repay foreign \ncurrency debt. LCY bonds thus offer a financing solution that \nis cheaper and free of exchange-rate risk for LCY investment \nand spending. Figure B3.2 reveals that when emerging market \ncurrencies depreciate, the demand for LCY financing tends \nto increase, as evidenced by greater LCY bond issuance in \n\nFigure B3.1: Currency Volatility and Local Currency \nBond Issuance\n\n17 Mar\n2016\n\n23 Mar\n2020\n\n29 Jun\n2016\n\n11 Nov\n2016\n\n0.009\n\n20 Jun\n2013\n\n0.006\n\nmean+2SD\n\n0.003\n\n0.000\n\n%\n98\n\n96\n\n94\n\n\uf07e\n\n0\n\n1 Jan\n2013\n\n1 Jan\n2014\n\n1 Jan\n2015\n\n1 Jan\n2016\n\n1 Jan\n2017\n\n1 Jan\n2018\n\n1 Jan\n2019\n\n1 Jan\n2020\n\n7-day currency volatility\n\nLCY share to total issuance\n\nLCY = local currency, SD = standard deviation.\nNotes: \n1.

This implies that better developed LCY bond \nmarkets serve as an important alternative funding source for \nlocal borrowers when the domestic currency weakens.\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \nsoured global investment sentiment and caused turmoil in \nglobal financial markets in March and April 2020, putting \nemerging market currencies under pressure. A huge amount \nof financing will be needed to tackle COVID-19 and its \neconomic effects. As evidenced by Figures B3.1 and B3.2, LCY \nbond issuance is an important funding mechanism for public \nand private sector borrowers in emerging markets, especially \nthose facing significant uncertainty. \n\nLarger LCY bond markets also offer central banks an \nadditional tool for monitoring liquidity in the financial system. \nDuring market turmoil, major central banks trade LCY bonds \nto smooth liquidity conditions in the financial sector and \n\na \n\n This box was written by Donghyun Park (Principal Economist), Shu Tian (Economist), and Mai Lin Villaruel (Economics Officer) in the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nb  ADB. 2019.

We measure recovery duration as the number of \nyears required to re-attain prerecession levels of output and \nemployment. We then rely on existing literature on business \ncycle dynamics to identify candidate variables that can \nhelp account for variations in recovery duration following \ndifferent kinds of shocks. By asking which of these variables \nare operative in the COVID-19 recession, we can then draw \ninferences about the duration of the recovery under different \nscenarios.\n\nThe main findings of the empirical analysis are as follows. \nFor gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, both the \namplitude of the recession and the presence of a double-\ndip increase recovery duration, as expected; that is, severe \nrecessions and double-dip recessions lengthen the time it \ntakes an economy to recover. Similarly, both global recessions \nand the presence of a financial crisis lengthen recovery \ndurations. There is also some indication that experiencing \nboth supply and demand shocks\u2014as is during the current \nCOVID-19 recession\u2014lengthens recovery time. Recession \namplitude, double-dip, financial crisis, and both shock \nvariables remain significant when included simultaneously. \n\nAdditional analysis indicates that the results for the duration \nof employment recoveries are broadly similar with the results \nfor GDP per capita recoveries. In addition, we find that \neconomies with floating exchange rate regimes did better \nin general, albeit not in response to global recessions. This \nis likely because flexible exchange rates are not very useful \nif all economies are in trouble simultaneously. Also, there \nis evidence that trade openness is associated with faster \nrecoveries. This is consistent with the idea that recovery \n\nData and Empirical Methodology\n\nOur primary data are real gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita in national accounts and employment. These \nwere collected from the Penn World Table 9.1. Dates of \nfinancial crises were obtained from Reinhart and Rogoff \n(2009) and Laeven and Valencia (2018). De facto exchange \nrate regimes were taken from Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and \nRogoff (2019). We considered 23 advanced economies and \n21 major emerging markets. The sample period of GDP and \nemployment for advanced economies is from 1950 to 2017. \nThe sample period of GDP and employment for emerging \nmarkets varies. For some, it is also from 1950 to 2017, but \nfor others the sample starts as late as 1990. The frequency \nis annual in all cases. The recovery duration of per capita \nGDP and employment is defined as how many years it \ntakes for the two variables to recover to their levels at the \npreceding business cycle peak. For the entire sample, we \nfind that it takes real GDP per capita and employment \naround 4 years and 3 years, respectively, to recover to their \nprevious peak. \n\nThe business cycle chronology is calculated by applying \nthe Bry and Boschan (1971) algorithm as coded by Jorda, \nSchularick, and Taylor (2013) for both advanced economies \nand emerging markets. Then we calculate the duration of \nrecoveries, which is defined as number of years for GDP \nper capita from peak to recovery of prior peak. Then we \ninvestigate the determinants of the duration by employing a \nparametric survival model with a Weibull distribution. We \nestimate both pooled regressions and panel regressions with \nrandom effects. The coefficients estimated determine the \nhazard rate so that a positive sign on a coefficient means that \nit shortens the duration of the recovery.\n\nThe dependent variable is the duration of the GDP recovery, \ndefined as number of years for GDP per capita from previous \npeak to recovery of prior peak. We estimate coefficients based \non the panel survival model with a Weibull distribution. A \nnegative sign on a coefficient means that it lengthens the \ntime to recovery (i.e., it reduces the likelihood of the ongoing \nrecovery spell ending in the current period).\n\na \n\n This box was written by Barry Eichengreen (Professor of Economics and Political Science) in the University of California at Berkeley, Donghyun Park (Principal Economist) in the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank, and Kwanho Shin (Professor of Economics) in Korea University.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fGlobal and Regional Market Developments  \u200315\n\nBox 4: The Duration of Recoveries from Economic Shocks Like COVID-19\u2003continued\n\nis aided by the ability to substitute exports for domestic \ndemand.\n\nSome implications for developing Asia\u2019s post-COVID-19 \nrecovery prospects\n\nWhat are the implications of these findings for recovery from \nthe COVID-19 recession in general and in developing Asian \neconomies in particular? A number of our empirical results \npoint in the direction of lengthy recoveries. The COVID-19 \nrecession is unusually severe, which will make for extended \nrecoveries if history is any guide. The fact that the COVID-19 \nrecession is global points in the same direction. It means that \neconomies, including a growing number of emerging markets \nin Asia and globally, that had been moving in the direction of \nmore freely floating exchange rates will not be able to exploit \nthat policy flexibility by depreciating their currencies and \ncrowding-in exports since their export markets are also likely \nto slowly recover. It means that the tendency for economies \n\nthat are more open to trade to recover more quickly, \nsomething that normally works in developing Asia\u2019s favor, will \nbe less potent this time.\n\nAnother troubling omen is that the COVID-19 recession \ninvolves both aggregate supply and aggregate demand \nshocks, as first supply was disrupted by lockdowns and then \nhouseholds and firms reduced their spending owing to the \nloss in incomes. Our results strongly suggest that these are \nthe recessions from which recovery is slowest. The negative \nsupply shock is unavoidable under the circumstances, but the \nnegative demand shock can be mitigated by policy. Emerging \nmarkets, including those in Asia, have responded more \naggressively than to previous recessions. Some of those with \ngreater fiscal space than in previous recessions have used this \nadvantage more aggressively. In addition, the rapid responses \nof multilaterals such as the International Monetary Fund and \nthe Asian Development Bank have provided low-income \neconomies with additional fiscal space.\n\nRisks to Economic Outlook  \nand Financial Stability\n\nDownside risks continue to dominate upside risks \nto the global and regional economic outlook and to \nfinancial stability. The overriding downside risk remains \nthe uncertain trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nEurope\u2019s recent experience suggests that economic \nperformance will be inextricably linked to success \nin containing outbreaks. In February, the European \nUnion (EU) suffered a major outbreak that began in \nItaly and soon spread to the rest of the continent. EU \ngovernments imposed lockdowns and other stringent \nrestrictions that helped contain the disease but also \ntook a heavy toll on the economy. Reduced mobility \nand economic activity sharply lowered the EU\u2019s GDP \nin Q2 2020 by more than 10.0% q-o-q. However, the \nrestrictions helped to bring the pandemic under control, \nas evident in a sharp decline in cases and deaths. \nThis allowed governments to ease restrictions, which \nimmediately boosted demand and growth. Third quarter \ngross domestic growth reached almost 10.0% q-o-q, and \nthere was growing optimism about a sustained recovery. \nHowever, a virulent second wave of COVID-19 cases \nstruck Europe in October, and optimism quickly turned \nto pessimism. In response, governments across the \ncontinent have imposed a new round of restrictions. In \n\nSeptember, the ECB forecast that the euro area would \ngrow at a healthy pace of more than 3% in the fourth \nquarter of 2020. However, some economists are now \npredicting an outright contraction. \n\nEmerging East Asian economies have fared relatively \nwell in terms of containing COVID-19. In particular, the \nPRC, which is a major engine of growth for the region, has \nseen normality return to everyday life after successfully \ncontaining COVID-19. As\u00a0a result, its economic recovery \nis gathering momentum and becoming more broad-\nbased. Most promisingly, whereas the recovery in \nQ2\u00a02020 was driven by public infrastructure investment \nand exports, consumption began to show signs of life \nin the third quarter as the PRC\u2019s retail sales rose by \n3.3%\u00a0y-o-y in September.\n\nThe key takeaway for Asia from Europe\u2019s second wave \nis that economic performance is intimately linked to \nthe state of public health. Furthermore, the European \nexperience suggests that even an apparently robust \nrecovery is powerless in the face of sudden and \nunexpected worsening of the COVID-19 situation. \nTherefore, if the PRC and other emerging East Asian \neconomies suffer a sharp spike in cases and deaths that \ntests their public health capacity, it is likely that economic \ngrowth and financial stability will also be tested.\n\n\f16\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nThe main upside risk is the rapid development of a \nsafe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. The mere news \nof a breakthrough vaccine would sharply lift business \nand consumer confidence. Overall, there is cause for \noptimism as several candidates have already reached \nPhase 3 clinical trials, which typically involve thousands of \nparticipants to confirm and evaluate the overall risks and \nbenefits of a vaccine. At the same time, the temporary \nsuspension of clinical trials by AstraZeneca and Johnson \n& Johnson due to sick participants suggests that there is \nstill some work left.\n\nWhile COVID-19 dominates all other risks, there \nare nevertheless some significant risks besides the \npandemic. The conflict between the PRC and the US, \nwhich seems to be rooted in structural differences, \nshows no signs of abating. On a positive note, tensions \nbetween the two have not become noticeably worse \nin recent months. Emerging East Asian economies \n\ndepend on close economic links with both the PRC and \nthe US. As such, persistent conflict between the two \neconomic giants represents a significant source of risk \nand uncertainty. Political and social instability due to \nvarious factors is another source of risk and uncertainty. \nIn many countries, central governments are grappling \nwith growing opposition from the general population and \nregional governments to lockdowns and other COVID-19 \nrestrictions. In the US, there are widespread concerns \nabout whether the government transition following the \npresidential election on 3\u00a0November can be completed \nsmoothly and without major disruption. Any prolonged \nlegal disputes over the election outcome could harm \nUS and global financial stability. Other countries, such \nas Thailand, are experiencing political instability due to \ncountry-specific factors. Finally, as always, a number of \ngeopolitical risks, including geopolitical tensions in the \nMiddle East, loom on the horizon.\n\n\fBond Market Developments\nin the Third Quarter of 2020\n\nSize and Composition\n\nThe outstanding amount of local currency \nbonds in emerging East Asia reached \nUSD18.7\u00a0trillion at the end of September.\n\nAt the end of September, the size of emerging \nEast\u00a0Asia\u2019s local currency (LCY) bond market reached \nUSD18.7\u00a0trillion.3 The region\u2019s bond market growth \nmoderated to 4.8% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in the \nthird quarter (Q3) of 2020 from 5.0% q-o-q in the \nsecond quarter (Q2) (Figure 1a). The slowdown in growth \nwas primarily driven by a weaker expansion in corporate \nbonds.

Corporate bond market growth also slowed in \nViet Nam and Hong Kong, China in Q3 2020 compared \nwith Q2\u00a02020. The rest of the emerging East Asia\u2019s \ncorporate bond markets posted faster growth in Q3 2020 \nthan in Q2 2020, but the weaker growth in the PRC and \nthe Republic of Korea curtailed the region\u2019s overall growth \nin Q3 2020.\n\nASEAN economies accounted for 7.0% of emerging \nEast\u00a0Asia\u2019s corporate bond market at the end of \nSeptember. Among ASEAN economies, Malaysia, \nSingapore, and Thailand had the largest corporate \nbond markets with outstanding bond stocks of \nUSD176.9\u00a0billion, USD130.2 billion, and USD118.9 billion, \nrespectively. The Philippines and Indonesia followed, \nwith outstanding bond stocks of USD33.7 billion and \nUSD29.6 billion, respectively. Viet Nam remained home \nto the region\u2019s smallest corporate bond market, with \nan outstanding stock of USD10.6 billion at the end of \nSeptember.\n\nEmerging East Asia\u2019s total LCY bond market was \nequivalent to 95.6% of the region\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) at the end of September, climbing \nfrom 91.6% at the end of June and 82.5% at the end of \nSeptember 2019 (Table 2). The share of government \nbonds to GDP, expressed as a percentage, increased \nto 58.8% at the end of Q3 2020 from 55.7% at the end \nof Q2\u00a02020, while the corporate bonds-to-GDP share \nincreased to 36.8% from 35.9%. The rising bonds-to-\nGDP share in Q3 2020 is attributed to the expansion \nof all bond markets in the region during the quarter, \nlargely due to governments raising funds for their \nCOVID-19 responses, while economic output continued \nto experience moderate to negative growth due to the \nlingering adverse impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe bond markets of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nand Singapore were the largest in the region, measured \nas a percentage of GDP, at the end of Q3 2020, with \ntheir GDP shares each exceeding 100%. The Republic of \nKorea\u2019s bond market had the highest GDP share in the \nregion at 141.7%. Indonesia and Viet Nam accounted for\nthe smallest bond market shares at 25.0% each.

Viet Nam had the lowest government \nbonds-to-GDP share at 20.5%, while Indonesia had the \nlowest corporate bonds-to-GDP share at 2.8%.\n\nForeign Investor Holdings\n\nThe foreign holdings share of LCY government \nbonds declined in most markets in Q3 2020.\n\nThe foreign investor holdings share at the end of Q3\u00a02020 \nwas lower than at the end of Q2 2020 in Indonesia, \nThailand, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, while it increased \nin the PRC and Malaysia (Figure 2). Lingering uncertainty \nand risk surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic weighed \ndown foreign investor sentiment, negatively impacting \ninvestment in most markets in the region.\n\nForeign investors continued to increase their holdings \nof the PRC\u2019s government bonds. The share of foreign \nholdings increased to 9.4% at the end of September from \n9.1% at the end of June. Government bonds in the PRC \nhave higher returns compared to advanced economies \nsuch as the United States (US) and Japan, resulting in \nsustained foreign interest in the domestic bond market. \nThe stability of the Chinese yuan is also a factor in the \n\nFigure 2: Foreign Holdings of Local Currency Government \nBonds in Select Asian Markets (% of total)\u00a0\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nJapan\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nViet Nam\n\nPhilippines\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n%\n\n2\n%\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSep-20\n\nJun-20\n\nMar-20\n\nNote: Data for Japan and the Republic of Korea as of 30 June 2020.\nSource: AsianBondsOnline.\n\nincrease in foreign holdings. Moreover, the PRC published \nnew draft rules in September making foreign access to \nthe LCY bond market easier to further boost the market\u2019s \ndevelopment. Foreign investor demand was also driven \nby news that PRC government bonds would be included \nin the FTSE Russell World Government Bond Index in \nOctober 2021.\n\nMalaysian government securities continued to attract \nforeign participation in the bond market with the share \nof offshore holdings climbing to 23.6% at the end of \nSeptember from 22.7% at the end of June. Favorable \nyields amid high global liquidity and signs of domestic \neconomic recovery supported the bond market\u2019s \nappeal to foreign investors. The increase in Malaysian \ngovernment bonds\u2019 weight in the Government Bond\nIndex-Emerging Markets Global Diversified Index as well \nas the decision to keep Malaysia\u2019s bonds in the FTSE \nRussell World Government Bond Index, with another \nreview to follow in March 2021, has also lent a boost \nto demand. Malaysia has the second-largest share of \nforeign-held government bonds in the region.\n\nForeign ownership of government bonds in Indonesia and \nin the Philippines further declined in Q3 2020. Indonesia \nreached a share of 27.0% at the end of September, a record \nlow dating to June 2012, over concerns about Indonesia\u2019s \ndebt monetization plan. The share of offshore holdings \nhas fallen about 10 percentage points from the start of the \nyear. Foreign investor sentiment toward the local bond \nmarket remained weak in Q3 2020 as evidenced by low \nto negative monthly fund flows. The massive borrowings \nby the government to fund its pandemic response were \nmainly absorbed by domestic investors, resulting in the \nslide in the share of foreign holdings. Despite the decline, \nIndonesia continued to have the highest foreign holdings \nshare in the region. In the Philippines, foreign ownership of \ngovernment bonds dropped to its lowest level since data \nare available, falling to 1.5% at the end of September from \n1.9% at the end of June. While foreign funds returned to \nthe government bond market in September, the inflow was \nmerely enough to have a small offsetting impact on past \noutflows. Domestic investors are the main participants in \nthe local government bond market expansion.\n\nForeign participation in Thailand\u2019s government bond \nmarket has not fully recovered from the initial impact of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in the share of debt \npaper held by foreign investors continued to decline in \n\n\fQ3 2020, as increases in debt were largely absorbed by \ndomestic investors. The foreign holdings share was down \nto 14.0% at the end of September, its lowest level since \nDecember 2016, even as monthly fund flows have been \npositive since June.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the share of foreign ownership was \npractically unchanged in Q3 2020, remaining at 0.6% \nat the end of September. The foreign holdings share in \nViet\u00a0Nam is the smallest in the region.\n\nThe uptrend in the foreign holdings share in the Republic \nof Korea\u2019s government bond held through the end of \nJune. Foreign investors held 13.0% of Korean government \nbonds, up from 12.8% at the end of March and the highest \nlevel of foreign ownership share since data are available. \nThe appeal of government bonds is owed to high returns \nas well as sound fiscal and financial conditions in the \neconomy.\n\nForeign Bond Flows\n\nForeign buying of government bonds was \nsustained in most emerging East Asian markets \nin Q3 2020.\n\nInflows of foreign funds into government bond markets \ncontinued in Q3 2020 in most emerging East Asian \neconomies after rebounding in Q2 2020 (Figure 3). This \nresulted in total net inflows of USD29.9 billion in the \nregion during the quarter. Ample global liquidity, high-\nyielding government debt, and some signs of recovery \namong emerging East Asian economies amid progress in \nCOVID-19 containment measures were the key factors \ndriving the positive flows. The highest monthly net inflows \nin the region during Q3 2020 were recorded in July, \namounting to an aggregate of USD11.7 billion, with only \nthe Philippines experiencing outflows. Foreign buying, \nhowever, decelerated in succeeding months, registering \nonly USD7.9 billion in aggregate net inflows in September, \nwith Indonesia and the Republic of Korea registering \noutflows.\n\nThe PRC attracted USD23.3 billion in foreign funds in \nQ3\u00a02020, its highest quarterly inflow total to date. Its \nlargest monthly inflows during the quarter occurred in \nAugust with USD9.0 billion.

Figures were computed based on 30 September 2020 exchange rates to avoid \n\ncurrency effects. \n\nSources: People\u2019s Republic of China (Wind Information); Indonesia (Directorate \nGeneral of Budget Financing and Risk Management, Ministry of Finance); \nRepublic of Korea (Financial Supervisory Service); Malaysia (Bank Negara \nMalaysia); Philippines (Bureau of the Treasury); and Thailand (Thai Bond Market \nAssociation).\n\nhave fueled foreign participation in the LCY debt market. \nThe PRC had the highest fund inflows among all emerging \nEast Asian economies during the quarter.\n\nIn the Republic of Korea, cumulative net inflows \namounted to USD2.7 billion in Q3 2020, which was \npartially offset by the foreign sell-off in September. \nThe fund outflows in September, amounting to \nUSD26.5\u00a0million, were the first since the start of the year. \nProfit-taking by investors, following 8 months of foreign \nbuying, mainly caused the outflows.\n\nOverseas investors continued to pour funds into the \nMalaysian and Thai government debt markets in Q3\u00a02020. \nMalaysia received total inflows of USD2.9\u00a0billion during \nthe quarter, with the bulk occurring in July before slowing \nin August and September. In Thailand, total inflows \namounted to USD1.4 billion during the quarter with \nthe highest monthly total occurring in September at \nUSD0.8 billion. Relatively higher returns in these markets, \nespecially as real interest rates were pushed higher by \ndeflation, drove the continued foreign buying.\n\n\f24\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nIndonesia saw foreign fund outflows in Q3 2020 as \nconcerns about the struggle to contain COVID-19 \npersisted. Indonesia had total net outflows of \nUSD0.3\u00a0billion during the quarter due to fund withdrawals \nin August and September that offset the foreign buying \nin July. Investor concerns about a potential weakening of \nBank Indonesia\u2019s independence also sparked the capital \noutflows. In September, Indonesia\u2019s parliament received \na recommendation to give government ministers voting \nrights at monetary policy meetings and to allow the \ncentral banks to fund fiscal deficits.\n\nIn the Philippines, net foreign funds outflow amounted \nto USD0.3 billion in Q3 2020, an improvement from \nthe previous quarter\u2019s USD2.0 billion withdrawals. \nForeign investors sold Philippine government bonds from \nMarch to August. In the months of Q3 2020, outflows \nin July amounted to USD0.2 billion, tapering off in \nAugust to USD92.0 million, before registering inflows of \nUSD46.9\u00a0million in September. This improvement was \nlikely brought about by some optimism with the gradual \nreopening of the economy and progress in COVID-19 \ncontainment as evidenced by declining daily cases.\n\nLocal Currency Bond Issuance\n\nTotal LCY bond sales in emerging East Asia \nclimbed to USD2.2 trillion in Q3 2020, as \ngovernments borrowed to support large-scale \nstimulus programs.\n\nLCY bond issuance in emerging East Asian markets \ncontinued to expand in Q3 2020, buoyed by governments \nseeking to fund large-scale stimulus programs and \nrecovery measures amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Total \nbond sales reached USD2.2 trillion in Q3 2020 on a \n6.4%\u00a0q-o-q expansion (Table 3). Growth, however, \nmoderated due to a high base effect following the \n21.5%\u00a0q-o-q issuance hike posted in the preceding \nquarter. Issuance in Q3 2020 was largely driven by higher \nsales of Treasury instruments and other government \nbonds. Central bank issuance also contributed to the \ngrowth but to a much lower extent. In contrast, the \nvolume of issuance by corporates fell short of the \nprevious quarter\u2019s volume. Seven out of nine emerging \nEast Asian bond markets posted a higher issuance \nvolume in Q3\u00a02020 than in the previous quarter, with the \nRepublic\u00a0of Korea and Malaysia as the exceptions. Both \nmarkets recorded q-o-q declines in issuance in Q3 2020 \nvis-\u00e0-vis Q2 2020.\n\nOn an annual basis, issuance growth expanded at a \nfaster pace of 39.8% y-o-y in Q3 2020 compared with \n32.5%\u00a0y-o-y in Q2 2020. Except for Viet Nam, all regional \nbond markets recorded y-o-y increases in bond issuance \nin Q3 2020. Viet Nam was the sole market that posted a \ny-o-y contraction in issuance.\n\nGovernment bonds continued to account for a larger \nshare of issuance than corporate bonds, representing \n61.2% of the region\u2019s issuance total during the quarter, \nup from the previous quarter\u2019s 58.5%. In Q3 2020, LCY \ngovernment bond issuance totaled USD1,374.1 billion \non growth of 11.4% q-o-q and 51.8% y-o-y. Driving \nmuch of the growth in government bond issuance was \nTreasury instruments and other government bonds, \nwhich comprised 75.2% of the total government bond \nissuance during the quarter. The markets of the PRC, \nIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam saw \nq-o-q increases in their issuance of Treasury and other \ngovernment bonds during the quarter. On the other \nhand, lower issuance volumes of Treasury and other \ngovernment bonds were observed in Hong Kong,\u00a0China; \nthe Republic of Korea; and Malaysia. Singapore \nmaintained the same volume of issuance in Q3 2020 \ncompared with the previous quarter.\n\nCentral bank issuance recovered in Q3 2020, with \ngrowth rising 8.2% q-o-q after contracting 1.4% \nq-o-q in Q2\u00a02020. Most of the region\u2019s central banks \nincreased their issuance in Q3 2020, particularly in \nHong\u00a0Kong,\u00a0China; Indonesia; the Philippines; Singapore; \nand Thailand. On the other hand, the Bank of Korea and \nBank Negara Malaysia reduced their issuance, while the \nState Bank of Vietnam had no issuance.\n\nIn contrast, corporate bond issuance across the region \ndeclined a marginal 0.6% q-o-q to USD870.7 billion.  \nOn a y-o-y basis, however, corporate bond issuance grew \n24.3% in Q3 2020, which was lower than the previous \nquarter\u2019s 38.8% rise. The PRC and the Republic of Korea, \nwhich are home to the region\u2019s first- and second-largest \ncorporate bond markets, respectively, each recorded a low \nvolume of issuance during the quarter.

Growth moderated to 6.9% q-o-q \nin Q3 2020 after surging 31.2% q-o-q in Q2\u00a02020 as \nthe government continued to stimulate the economy, \nleading to a high base effect. Government bond issuance \ndrove much of the growth, particularly Treasury bonds \nand local government bonds, driven by government \ndirectives for increased spending to support fiscal \npolicies and pursue projects that were derailed by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The government also increased \nits quota of local government bonds by CNY1.6\u00a0trillion \nin 2020 compared to last year\u2019s and pushed local \ngovernments to tap the quota for issuing bonds in a bid to \nboost economic recovery. Local governments were also \nrequired to complete their 2020 issuances by October. \nCorporate bond issuance posted marginal growth of 0.2% \nin Q3\u00a02020 from 15.9%\u00a0q-o-q in Q2 2020 due to rising \ninterest rates. On an annual basis, the PRC\u2019s issuance \nactivities quickened to 52.5%\u00a0y-o-y in Q3 2020 from \n48.2% y-o-y in Q2 2020.\n\nLCY bond issuance in the Republic of Korea totaled \nUSD189.2 billion in Q3 2020, down 11.5% q-o-q \nfollowing a 4.0% q-o-q hike in the preceding quarter. \nAll bond segments recorded declines in issuance during \nthe quarter. Government bond issuance slowed by \n14.5%\u00a0q-o-q, but with the volume still relatively high, \nas the government sought to finance its supplemental \nbudgets. Issuance of central bank instruments also \ndropped during the quarter, falling 10.5% q-o-q \nas the Bank of Korea added liquidity. For the third \nconsecutive quarter, the volume of new corporate bond \nissuance decelerated, falling 8.9%\u00a0q-o-q as corporates \nreconsidered their borrowing plans due to uncertainties in \nthe economy. On a y-o-y basis, bond issuance moderated \nto 12.6% in Q3 2020 from 16.2% in Q2\u00a02020.\n\nIn Hong Kong, China, bond issuance climbed to \nUSD144.7\u00a0billion in Q3 2020 on growth of 5.2% q-o-q \nthat followed a 1.4% q-o-q hike in the prior quarter. \nIssuance of Exchange Fund Bills and Exchange Fund \n\n\fNotes picked up during the quarter, rebounding to expand \n10.0% q-o-q after contracting 1.5% q-o-q in Q2 2020 \ndue to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u2019s decision in \nthe earlier quarter to reduce issuance to increase liquidity. \nOn the other hand, the issuance of Hong Kong Special \nAdministrative Region Bonds declined in Q3\u00a02020. \nMeanwhile, corporate bond sales contracted 8.2% q-o-q \nin Q3 2020 following growth of 9.8% q-o-q in Q2 2020. \nOn a y-o-y basis, LCY bond issuance surged 9.8% in \nQ3\u00a02020, up from 2.2% in Q2\u00a02020.\n\nTotal bonds sales from ASEAN economies tallied \nUSD337.4 billion in Q3 2020, with the share of the \nregional total climbing to 15.0%. Aggregate bond issuance \nswelled to 17.5% q-o-q and 23.5% y-o-y in Q3 2020 \nfrom 4.8% q-o-q and 2.1% y-o-y in Q2 2020. Five out \nof six ASEAN economies for which data are available \nrecorded q-o-q increases in bond issuance during the \nquarter, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. The exception was Malaysia, \nwhich pared its issuance volume in Q3 2020 compared \nwith the previous quarter. Among ASEAN economies, the \nlargest issuers in Q3 2020 were Singapore, Thailand, and \nIndonesia.\n\nLCY bond issuance from Singapore summed to \nUSD147.7\u00a0billion in Q3 2020, with growth inching up \nto 6.8% q-o-q from 6.2% q-o-q in Q2 2020. The hike \nstemmed from an increase in the issuance of government \nbonds, while corporate bond issuance contracted during \nthe quarter. Government bond issuance edged higher on \ngrowth of 7.5% q-o-q, driven largely by the 9.3% q-o-q \nhike in the issuance of Monetary Authority of Singapore \nbills. The volume of issuance of Singapore Government \nSecurities bills and bonds was unchanged from the \nprevious quarter. Corporate bond issuance during the \nquarter weakened 16.1% q-o-q following a 50.8%\u00a0q-o-q \nexpansion in Q2 2020. On an annual basis, LCY bond \nissuance in Singapore slipped to 18.1% y-o-y from \n19.9%\u00a0y-o-y in Q2 2020.\n\nThailand saw total bond sales in Q3 2020 of \nUSD93.3\u00a0billion, as growth accelerated 20.9% q-o-q  \nfrom only 3.1% q-o-q in Q2 2020. Much of the q-o-q \nexpansion stemmed from increased issuance volume \nby the government, particularly Treasury and other \ngovernment bonds. Treasury bond issuance surged \n67.1%\u00a0q-o-q as the government aimed to boost economic \ngrowth through increased fiscal spending. New issuance \nof central bank instruments also rebounded during the \n\nBond Market Developments in the Third Quarter of 2020\u200327\n\nquarter, rising 11.2% q-o-q following a decline of 0.4% \nin the previous quarter. Corporate bond issuance also \nrecovered, rising 27.4% q-o-q in Q3 2020 after contracting \n23.7% q-o-q in the previous quarter. LCY bond issuance in \nThailand rebounded on growth of 23.4%\u00a0y-o-y following a \ndecline of 14.1% y-o-y in Q2\u00a02020.\n\nIn Indonesia, LCY bond issuance remained active as \nissuance reached USD41.4 billion in Q3 2020, with \ngrowth accelerating to 44.3% q-o-q from 37.5% q-o-q in \nQ2 2020. Growth was boosted by increased issuance of \nTreasury instruments as the government expedited fiscal \nspending to pump-prime the economy in response to the \nadverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Issuance of \ncentral bank bills also climbed during the quarter, rising \n17.9% q-o-q. Corporate bond sales were quite active \nduring the quarter, as issuance rose more than four-fold \nin Q3 2020. On a y-o-y basis, issuance volume slightly \ndipped to 78.5% from 79.4% in Q2 2020.\n\nLCY bond sales in Malaysia totaled USD21.6 billion in \nQ3 2020 on a 4.5% q-o-q contraction. The decline in \nissuance stemmed from lower bond sales of Treasury \ninstruments and the absence of Bank Negara Malaysia \nissuance during the quarter. On the other hand, corporate \nbond issuance climbed 12.1% q-o-q in Q3 2020 after \ndeclining 15.7% q-o-q in the preceding quarter. On a y-o-y \nbasis, bond issuance grew 6.3% in Q3 2020 following a \n16.7% contraction in Q2 2020.\n\nIn the Philippines, LCY bond sales nearly doubled to \nreach USD25.4 billion in Q3 2020. Overall growth soared \n77.0%\u00a0q-o-q after a decline of 19.6% q-o-q in the prior \nquarter. Government bond issuance grew 65.4% q-o-q \non the back of a 57.9% q-o-q hike in the issuance of \nTreasury instruments and the resumption of issuance \nof central bank bills by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \n(BSP). Q3\u00a02020 marked the first issuance of central \nbanks bills by the BSP since the 1980s.

August and September saw several issuances \nof bonds, with tenors ranging from 10 years to 40 years, as \ninstitutional investors sought longer-term bonds to match \nthe duration of their long-term liabilities.\n\nGovernment Bond Yield Curves\n\nGovernment bond yield curves shifted down \nbetween 31 August and 30 October in most \nmarkets in emerging East Asia.\n\nCOVID-19 continued to weigh on market outlook \nbetween 31 August and 30 October, creating a highly \nuncertain economic outlook. In particular, rising \nCOVID-19 cases, such as in the US and the euro area are \nplacing pressure on the economic recovery. Additionally, \nuncertainties regarding the direction of the US economic \npolicy and stimulus also dampened investor sentiment.\n\nIn the US, the Federal Reserve left monetary policy \nunchanged during its 15\u201316 September meeting. The \nFederal Reserve noted that data indicate that the US \neconomy improved in Q3 2020; however, uncertainty \nremains due to COVID-19. Federal Reserve Chairman \nJerome Powell has said that it would take time before the \neconomy returns to its pre-COVID-19 levels and that it \nwould require additional support, including fiscal stimulus. \nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s updated forecast in September was \nnot substantially different from that in June, but the new \nforecast for full-year growth in 2020 improved to \u20133.7% \nfrom \u20136.5%. The Federal Reserve also left monetary policy \nunchanged during its 4-5 November meeting.\n\nBoth the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of \nJapan (BOJ) left their monetary policies unchanged at \ntheir respective monetary policy meetings on 29 October. \nBoth central banks noted improvements in Q3 2020, \nwhile also stating that concerns remained. In the euro \narea, the ECB indicated that it may make adjustments to \nmonetary policy in December, while the BOJ downgraded \nits GDP forecast for fiscal 2020 from previous forecasts \nmade in July.\n\nIn emerging East Asia, the uncertain economic outlook led \ncentral banks in the region to maintain its accommodative \nmonetary policy. This largely impacted the shorter-end \nof the curve in most markets, as the region\u2019s 2-year \n\n\fBond Market Developments in the Third Quarter of 2020\u200333\n\nyields trended downwards, with the exception of the \nPRC, Singapore, and Thailand. The PRC\u2019s 2-year yield \nhas consistently risen as its economy recovers after \nhaving successfully dealt with the COVID-19 epidemic \n(Figure\u00a07a). Both Singapore and Thailand\u2019s 2-year yields \nrose as investors shunned shorter tenors, preferring longer \nones (Figure\u00a07b).\n\n10-year yield moved upward 16 basis points (bps) \nbetween 31\u00a0August and 30 October, on continued \neconomic growth (Figure\u00a08a). In contrast, continued \ninvestor uncertainty regarding the direction of the \nPhilippine economy led to a jump of 17\u00a0bps in its 10-year \nyield (Figure 8b). Hong\u00a0Kong, China\u2019s; the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s; and Malaysia\u2019s 10-year yields also rose, but the \nincreases were marginal.\n\nIn contrast to the 2-year yield movements, 10-year yields \nclimbed among a majority of markets. The steepest rise \ncame from the PRC and the Philippines. The PRC\u2019s  \n\nThe largest decline in 10-year yields was seen in \nViet\u00a0Nam, with a 33-bps drop for the review period as its \n\nFigure 7a: 2-Year Local Currency Government  \nBond Yields\u00a0\n\nFigure 7b: 2-Year Local Currency Government  \nBond Yields\u00a0\n\n%\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n%\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nOct-19 Dec-19\n\nFeb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nOct-19 Dec-19\n\nFeb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nSingapore\nUnited States \n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\nUnited States\n\nNote: Data as of 30 October 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nNote: Data as of 30 October 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nFigure 8a: 10-Year Local Currency Government  \nBond Yields\u00a0\n\nFigure 8b: 10-Year Local Currency Government  \nBond Yields\u00a0\n\nOct-19 Dec-19\n\nFeb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nOct-19 Dec-19\n\nFeb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nSingapore\nUnited States \n\nIndonesia\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\nViet Nam\nUnited States\n\nNote: Data as of 30 October 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nNote: Data as of 30 October 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\n%\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\f34\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\ncentral bank was the only one to reduce rates in October. \nIndonesia\u2019s 10-year yields also plunged, as investor \ninterest returned in October, following the passage of \nan Omnibus Law, which provided easing regulations for \nbusinesses and\u00a0labor.\n\nSingapore\u2019s 10-year yield fell, the opposite of its 2-year \nyield, as the economy is expected to slow down into \nthe fourth quarter as the resurgence of cases in other \neconomies will cap external demand. Similarly, Thailand \nsaw an increase in the 2-year yield but a drop in its  \n10-year yield, as concerns over debt oversupply dissipated. \nThe government announced that it would only borrow \nTHB1.47 trillion for the fiscal year beginning 1 October \n2020, which is 11% lower than the preceding year.\n\nYield curves overall shifted downward for most markets \nin emerging East Asia, but the rationale for each market\u2019s \nmovement was different (Figure 9). The PRC, with the \nentire yield curve shifting upward, and Malaysia, whose \nyield curve movements were mixed, were the exceptions.\n\nViet Nam\u2019s entire yield curve shifted downward following \nthe central bank\u2019s easing, while Indonesia\u2019s yield curve \nshifted downward for nearly all tenors amid renewed \ninvestor interest. Singapore\u2019s yield curve also shifted \ndownward for most tenors over a lack of inflationary \npressures and uncertainty over the global economic \nrecovery. In the Republic of Korea, yields largely \nfell for most maturities amid fears of new wave of \nCOVID-19\u00a0cases.\n\nIn the Philippines, yields at the shorter-end fell, but rose \nat the longer-end, due to higher investor risk aversion. \nIn Thailand, yields rose at the shorter-end but fell at \nthe longer end, buoyed by a recovery in bond inflows in \nOctober.\n\nThe 2-year versus 10-year yield spreads were mixed \nacross the region (Figure 10). The PRC, Indonesia, \nSingapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam showed a decline in \nthe spread. All other emerging East Asian economies \nshowed a rising yield spread during the review period.\n\nWhile economic growth remains a concern, some \neconomies\u2019 GDP recovered in Q3 2020. In the PRC, \nGDP growth accelerated to 4.9% y-o-y in Q3 2020 from \n3.2%\u00a0y-o-y in Q2 2020, reflecting steady but gradual \nrecovery. Viet Nam\u2019s economy likewise recovered in \nQ3\u00a02020, with GDP growth rising to 2.6% y-o-y from \n\n0.4% y-o-y in the previous quarter, the only market in \nthe region which consistently posted positive growth \ndespite the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining \nmarkets continued to post negative y-o-y growth rates in \nQ3\u00a02020, but at a slower pace compared to the previous \nquarter. This includes Hong Kong, China (\u20133.5% from \n\u20139.0%); Indonesia (\u20133.5% from \u20135.3%); the Republic of \nKorea (\u20131.3% from \u20132.7%); Malaysia (\u20132.7% from \u201317.1%); \nthe Philippines (\u201311.5% from \u201316.9%); and Thailand (6.4% \nfrom \u201312.1%).\n\nThe overall weak economic environment led to a decline \nin inflation in August and September in most emerging \nEast Asian markets for which data are available. In \nparticular, Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; and Thailand \nremained in deflationary territory during the review \nperiod, while Indonesia\u2019s inflation was stable (Figure\u00a011a). \nThe main exception to the regional trend was the \nRepublic of Korea, which has experienced a steady rise \nin inflation since having moved out of deflation in June \n(Figure 11b).\n\nDespite declines in inflation, central banks in the region \nhave largely held off on raising policy rates during the \nreview period after having aggressively eased monetary \npolicy in previous months. During the review period, \nthe Philippines reduced rates by a cumulative 175 bps \n(Figure\u00a012a). In July, Bank Negara Malaysia and Bank \nIndonesia further reduced rates. The lone exception was \nViet Nam, whose central bank reduced its policy rate on \n1 October by 50 bps, for a cumulative rate reduction of \n200\u00a0bps year-to-date through 30 October (Figure 12b). \nSubsequently, both Bangko ng Sentral ng Pilipinas and \nBank Indonesia implemented a surprise rate cut of 25 bps \non 19 November.\n\nThe movement of corporate spreads was largely \nmixed across the region.\n\nAAA-rated corporate versus government yield spreads \nfell in the PRC between 31 August and 15 October as \nthe economy continued to recover from the impact of \nCOVID-19. Corporate spreads also narrowed in Thailand \nduring the review period. Yield spreads rose for longer \ntenors in Malaysia and shifted upward in the Republic of \nKorea (Figure 13a).\n\nFor lower-rated corporate bonds, spreads fell in both the \nPRC and Malaysia, while they rose in Thailand, and were \nunchanged in the Republic of Korea (Figure 13b).\n\n\fBond Market Developments in the Third Quarter of 2020\u200335\n\nFigure 9: Benchmark Yield Curves\u2014Local Currency Government Bonds\n\nChina, People's Rep. of\n\nHong Kong, China\nHong Kong, China\n\nIndonesia\n\nYield (%)\n4.1\n\n3.6\n\n3.1\n\n2.6\n\n2.1\n\n0\n\nYield (%)\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\nYield (%)\n2.0\n\nYield (%)\nYield (%)\n1.0\n\n0.7\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n\u20130.2\n\nYield (%)\n4.2\n\n3.5\n\n2.8\n\n2.1\n\n1.4\n\n1.8\n\n1.3\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\nYield (%)\n0.2\n\n\u20130.1\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.7\n\n\u20131.0\n\nYield (%)\n8.2\n\nYield (%)\n4.5\n\n6.9\n\n5.6\n\n4.3\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n2.7\n\n1.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.0\n\nYield (%)\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.3\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n2\n\n4\n4\n\n6\n6\n\n8\n8\n\n10\n10\n\n12\n12\n\n14\n14\n\n16\n16\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\n\n24\n\n27\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nYield (%)\n1.6\n\nYield (%)\n2.3\n\nYield (%)\n3.6\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\nJapan\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\nSources: Based on data from Bloomberg LP and Thai Bond Market Association.\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\n\f36\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nFigure 10: Yield Spreads between 2-Year and 10-Year \nGovernment Bonds\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nIndonesia\n\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\nJapan\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nBasis points\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\nSource: AsianBondsOnline computations based on Bloomberg LP data.\n\nFigure 11a: Headline Inflation Rates\n\nFigure 11b: Headline Inflation Rates\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20134\n\n2.98\n\n1.42\n\n0.00\n\n\u20130.70\n\n\u20132.20\n\nSep-19 Nov-19\n\nJan-20 Mar-20 May-20\n\nJul-20\n\nSep-20\n\nSep-19\n\nNov-19\n\nJan-20 Mar-20 May-20\n\nJul-20\n\nSep-20\n\nHong Kong, China\nIndonesia\nSingapore\n\nThailand\nViet Nam\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nJapan\nKorea, Rep. of\n\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nNote: Data as of 30 September 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nNote: Data as of 30 September 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\n2.30\n\n1.70\n\n1.00\n\n0.00\n\n\u20131.40\n\n\fFigure 12a: Policy Rates\n\nFigure 12b: Policy Rates\n\nBond Market Developments in the Third Quarter of 2020\u200337\n\n%\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n%\n1.5\n\n1.2\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n%\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n%\n11.8\n\n11.6\n\n11.4\n\n11.2\n\n11.0\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4.7\n\n3.9\n\n3.1\n\n2.3\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n2.25\n\n1.75\n\n0.50\n\n0.50\n\n4.00\n\n4.00\n\n2.95\n\nOct-19 Dec-19 Feb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nOct-19 Dec-19 Feb-20 Apr-20 Jun-20 Aug-20 Oct-20\n\nKorea, Rep. of\nMalaysia\n\nPhilippines\nThailand\n\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nIndonesia\n\nViet Nam\n\nNote: Data as of 30 October 2020.\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nNotes:\n1.

The \nnew rules combined the two existing regulations into \none and also made application requirements easier and \nsimplified procedures. The new regulations took effect on \n1 November.\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China  \nIssues USD-Denominated Bonds \n\nIn October, the Government of the PRC issued \nUSD6.0\u00a0billion worth of 3-year, 5-year, 10-year,  \nand 30-year bonds. The bonds are the first USD-\ndenominated bonds issued by the Government  of the \nPRC since 1996 that are marketed to United States (US) \ninvestors under 144a Rules. The USD1.25\u00a0billion 3-year \nbond was issued with a coupon rate of 0.40%, while the \nUSD2.25\u00a0billion 5-year bond was issued with a coupon \nrate of 0.55%. The\u00a0USD2.0 billion 10-year bond was \nissued with a coupon rate of 1.2%, and the USD0.5 billion \n30-year bond\u00a0was issued with a coupon rate of 2.25%.\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority Holds \nCountercyclical Capital Buffer at 1.0%\n\nOn 12 October, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority \n(HKMA) announced that the countercyclical capital \nbuffer (CCyB) would remain unchanged at 1.0%. The \nHKMA noted that the latest data based on the second \nquarter indicators signaled the need for a higher CCyB of \n2.5%. However, the HKMA deemed that considering the \nhigh level of uncertainty facing the economy, holding the \nCCyB steady at 1.0% was more appropriate. A lower CCyB \nreleases additional liquidity into the banking system by \n\nIndonesia\n\nIndonesia\u2019s Parliament  \nApproves 2021 State Budget\n\nIn September, the Indonesian Parliament approved \nthe 2021 state budget, which calls for a deficit \nequivalent to 5.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). \nThe 2021 state budget estimates revenue will reach \nIDR1,743.7\u00a0trillion, while state spending is expected to \ntotal IDR2,750.0\u00a0trillion. The underlying macroeconomic \nassumptions for the 2021 state budget include \n(i)\u00a0economic growth of 5.0%, (ii) average inflation of  \n3.0%, (iii) an exchange rate of IDR14,600 per USD1, \n(iv) an average 10-year bond yield of 7.29%, and \n(v)\u00a0Indonesian crude oil price of USD45 per barrel.\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nThe National Assembly Passed  \nthe Fourth Supplementary Budget\n\nOn 22 September, the National Assembly passed \nthe fourth supplementary budget of 2020 worth \nKRW7.8\u00a0trillion. This brings the aggregate amount of all \nfour supplementary budgets to KRW62.2 trillion. The \nbudget is expected to fund additional coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) relief programs to support small businesses \nand low-income households.\n\nThe Republic of Korea  \nAnnounces New Fiscal Rules\n\nOn 5 October, the Government of the Republic of Korea \nannounced new fiscal rules to address the rapid increase \nin national debt. Although the economy\u2019s fiscal soundness \nand debt ratios are still considered low compared to its \nsimilarly rated peers, the government aims to maintain \n\n\f40\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nits fiscal sustainability. One rule is to maintain the \ngovernment-debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% and the \nconsolidated fiscal balance deficit at 3% or less of GDP. \nImplementation is expected to take effect starting in 2025 \nafter a transition period of 3 years.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  \nApproves Provisional Advance  \nto the Government of the Philippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nFTSE Russell Keeps Malaysia  \nin Its FTSE World Government Bond Index\n\nOn 24 September, FTSE Russell decided to keep Malaysia \nin its FTSE World Government Bond Index, but the \neconomy remained on the data provider\u2019s FTSE Russell \nFixed Income Watch List for possible exclusion. In its \nSeptember 2020 fixed-income review, FTSE Russell \nacknowledged Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s policy reforms to \nenhance secondary market bond liquidity and improve \nforeign exchange market structure. FTSE Russell will \ncontinue to monitor developments in the Malaysian bond \nmarket as Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s policies take effect and \nassess whether these regulatory reforms translate into \npractical improvements for international participants.\n\nPhilippines\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  \nIssues Central Bank Securities\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) started issuing BSP \nsecurities on 18 September as an additional instrument \nto manage liquidity in the financial system. According to \nthe BSP, this initiative will help the central bank shift to \nmore market-based monetary operations and support \nthe implementation of monetary policy under the interest \nrate corridor framework. The addition of BSP securities \nto the supply of risk-free financial instruments in the \nbanking system could help in the development of the \nlocal currency bond market. The BSP securities will \nbe one of the monetary policy tools to mop up excess \nliquidity. Initial offerings will be small in volume and have \nshorter tenors but will eventually be scaled up and have \nlonger maturities. The issuance of the securities is allowed \nunder the New Central Bank Act that was signed in \nFebruary\u00a02019.\n\nOn 1 October, the BSP approved the Government \nof the Philippines\u2019 request for a provisional advance \nof PHP540.0\u00a0billion to be used for budget deficit \nfinancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This came \nafter the Bureau of the Treasury fully settled the \nprevious PHP300.0\u00a0billion repurchase agreement on \n29\u00a0September. The fresh funds will be settled on or \nbefore 29 December and will have zero interest. The new \ntranche is pursuant to Section 89 of the New Central \nBank Act as amended in the Bayanihan II Act, which \nallows the government to avail of provisional advances \nfrom the central bank of up to PHP846.0 billion. Market \nparticipants expect the new funds to lift some burden \nfrom the government to increase borrowing.\n\nSingapore\n\nMonetary Authority of Singapore  \nExpands Access to Liquidity Facilities\n\nOn 3 September, the Monetary Authority of Singapore \n(MAS) announced various measures to enhance financial \ninstitutions\u2019 access to Singapore dollar and US dollar \nfunding. On 28 September, a Singapore Dollar Term \nFacility was launched to provide financial institutions \nflexible options in terms of SGD-denominated borrowing \nat longer tenors. The facility, which compliments \nthe overnight MAS Standing Facility, offers SGD-\ndenominated funds with 1-month and 3-month tenors. \nThe new facility makes available more options for \ncollateral composed of cash and other marketable \nsecurities in various currencies. For domestic systemically \nimportant banks, residential property loans may be \npledged as collateral with the Singapore Dollar Term \nFacility. MAS also enhanced the US Dollar Facility, \nestablished in March, which allows banks to borrow \nUS dollars by pledging SGD-denominated collateral. \nSimilar to the Singapore Dollar Term Facility guidelines, \noptions for collateral for the US Dollar Facility were also \nexpanded.\n\n\fPolicy and Regulatory Developments\u200341\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission  \nand Thai Bond Market Association  \nLaunch Environment, Social, and \nGovernance\u00a0Bond Hub \n\nOn 21 October, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the Thai Bond Market Association jointly launched an \nenvironment, social, and governance (ESG) information \nplatform to support investors and issuers of ESG bonds \nby making information publicly available. The ESG bond \ninformation hub was created by the Thai Bond Market \nAssociation from a platform developed by Luxembourg \nGreen Exchange. \n\nMinistry of Finance Issues Guidance  \non Bond Issuance Information Disclosure\n\nOn 14 August, the Ministry of Finance issued Circular \nNo. 77/2020/TT-BTC to provide guidance on its \nexisting decrees, Decree No. 81/2020/ND-CP and \nDecree\u00a0No.\u00a0163/2018/ND-CP, on the provision of bond \nissuance information in the domestic market.

Climate change, which poses a long-\nterm challenge to sustainable development, has hit the \npoor especially hard and could potentially push more \nthan 100\u00a0million people back into poverty by 2030. \nThere is now plenty of evidence showing that negative \nenvironmental and social externalities have significant \nnegative impacts on economic development. Box 5 \nreviews extant knowledge on how various environmental \nand social challenges can hamper economic growth.\n\nThe pandemic has sharply curtailed global economic \ngrowth and worsened social conditions worldwide. \nFurthermore, COVID-19 poses a disproportionately larger \nthreat to poor and vulnerable groups such as low-income \nhouseholds and small and medium-sized enterprises. \nIn many economies, the process of sustainable \ndevelopment has been disrupted by falling fiscal revenues \nand increased expenditures to contain COVID-19 and \nmitigate its negative economic impacts. Nevertheless, \nglobal policy makers are aware that pursuing a sustainable \ndevelopment path is important to prevent future shocks. \nWith limited policy scope, mobilizing private financial \nresources for green and inclusive investments becomes \nvital to achieving a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe importance of environmental and social externalities \nis now widely acknowledged in financial markets. \nAmid the market turmoil caused by COVID-19 during \nthe first quarter of 2020, environmental- and social-\nthemed financing instruments showed resilience and \neven outperformed conventional funds. As a result, \nmore attention is being paid to financing that integrates \nsocial impacts such as social bonds, sustainable bonds, \nsustainable loans, and sustainability-linked bonds. Box\u00a06 \nreviews the development of green and social finance \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile conventional wisdom may have once suggested \nthat investors only care about financial returns and \ntherefore do not consider environmental and social \nexternalities, this is no longer the case. Box 7 reviews \nexisting knowledge and outlines a few reasons why \nexternalities matter, including lower systematic and \nidiosyncratic risks, client demands and fund flow \nconcerns, hedging for climate-related risks, and social \npressure.\n\nIn addition to investors, existing evidence shows that \nsustainable finance also benefits other stakeholders \nby delivering economic benefits in terms of rising \nshareholder value, lower funding costs, a broader investor \nbase, innovation, and increased growth and employment. \nBox 8 summarizes the findings in the literature and \ndetails the positive economic impacts of green and social \nfinance.\n\n\fBox 5: Environmental and Social Externalities and Economic Growth and Development\n\nRapid population growth and economic development is \nupsetting the world\u2019s ecological balance.a Environmental \ndegradation is evident in air, water, land, and noise pollution, \nas well as in the loss of natural habitat. Environmental \ndeterioration has given rise to reproductive, mental health, \nand other public health problems. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich was succeeded by the Paris Agreement in 2016, \nrequired countries to make concrete commitments in the \nfight against global climate change. The agreements reflect \na growing recognition that the international community \nmust mitigate the disastrous effects of climate change \nand environmental destruction, including natural hazards \nand occurrences of infectious diseases, to achieve the \nUnited\u00a0Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs). \n\nRapid environmental pollution has been linked to climate \nchange. It also directly affects health, as evident in rising \nmorbidity and mortality rates. Many studies find evidence \nthat air pollution leads to a deterioration of productivity and \ngrowth. Air pollution is a silent killer since the poisonous \npollutants are invisible to the human eye. While most studies \ndocument outdoor air quality, the World Bank (2019) has \nalso found that many people die from poor indoor air quality, \nespecially in developing economies, where households are \nexposed to dirty fuels. A study of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), the world\u2019s most populous country and \na manufacturing powerhouse, show that a decline in air \npollutants can translate into higher labor productivity. Fu, \nViard, and Zhang (2017) estimate that reducing PM2.5 \n(sulfur dioxide) by 1% through methods other than lowering \nmanufacturing output would generate annual productivity \ngains of CNY57,600 (110.5) for the average firm and \nCNY9.2\u00a0billion (17.6), or 0.06% (0.12%) of the PRC\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP), across all firms.b\n\nThe effect of pollutants is not unidirectional. Ho, Oueghlissi, \nand el Ferktaji (2019) find that there is bidirectional causality \nbetween GDP and carbon dioxide emissions. This implies \nthat either a virtuous or a vicious cycle can ensue between a \ncountry\u2019s environmental state and its economic growth. The \nnegative externalities from polluted cities harm neighboring \ncities, where nearby cities that stand in the way of wind from \na polluted city show increased pollution. In addition, air \npollution can induce an exodus of highly skilled workers from \nurban areas who want to avoid such pollution, as the harmful \neffects of air pollution impair the productivity of the workforce \n\nFinancing a Sustainable Recovery \u200343\n\nand its quality of life (Fu, Viard, and Zhang\u00a02017). Air pollution \nalso harms mental health. As the average concentration of \nparticulate matter increases, the probability that the exposed \npopulation will experience a deterioration of mental health \nalso rises. Chen, Oliva, and Zhang (2018) estimated that, in \nthe PRC, the annual increase in health expenditures resulting \nfrom air pollution totaled USD22.88\u00a0billion in 2014-2015.\n\nWater pollution, which is known to affect ecosystems, \nagriculture, and health, is an important driver of economic \ngrowth. According to Damania et al. (2019), when the \nbiological oxygen demand, an indicator of water pollution, \nexceeds 8 milligrams per liter then the annual GDP growth \nof downstream regions is reduced by 0.83 percentage points \nrelative to a mean growth rate of 2.33% used in the study \n(Figure B5). Access to water is important since shortages \nlimit economic growth and job creation. The UN (2016) \nhas estimated that about 50% of the world\u2019s workers are \nemployed in eight key water-based and natural-resource-\ndependent industries. An improved water supply in Africa, \nfor example, could generate an estimated economic return of \nabout USD28.4 billion a year, or nearly 5% of the continent\u2019s \nGDP. There is also evidence that water quality exceeds the \neffect of water quantity on growth. El Khanji and Hudson \n(2016), using a panel of 177 economies covering the period \n\nFigure B5: Water Pollution and Gross Domestic \nProduct Growth\n\nPercentage points\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nMiddle-income\ncountries\n\nHigh-income\ncountries\n\nAll countries\n\nMean GDP\n\nReduction in GDP growth\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\nNote: Annual mean GDP growth is 2.33%.\nSource: Damania et al. 2019.

Thus, the study suggests that \nimproving water quality will also strengthen economic growth.\n\nSocial development can contribute to sustainable economic \ngrowth. Investment in areas such as education, sanitation, \nhealth care, gender equality, and affordable housing fosters \nsocial development, which in turn fosters economic \ndevelopment. An especially important contribution of social \ninvestment is that it promotes the type of inclusive growth \nthat enables vulnerable groups to take part in and benefit \nfrom development. \n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) comprise \na vulnerable group that plays a vital role in economic \ndevelopment. In particular, SMEs are an engine of job \ncreation and a catalyst for mobilizing local resources for rural \ndevelopment. The World Bank (2020) has estimated that \nformal SMEs contribute up to 40% of GDP in many emerging \neconomies. SMEs also contribute to the achievement \nof the UN Sustainable Development Goals via income \ndistribution and poverty alleviation. In Asia and the Pacific, \nSMEs have also greatly contributed to the growth of exports \n(Jabbour\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2020). \n\nAnother vulnerable group is women. Reducing gender \ninequality benefits social development and inclusive growth. \nBased on indicators of education performance in science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics, labor market \nactivity, wages, and work-life balance, the European Institute \nfor Gender Equality (2017) found that measures to improve \ngender equality would add about 10.5 million jobs and lift per \ncapita GDP by 4%\u201310% in the European Union by 2050. In \nAsia and the Pacific, reducing barriers to female participation \nin the labor force would mitigate the negative economic \nimpact of population aging on the region\u2019s economic growth \n(Asian\u00a0Development Bank 2011). However, Kabeer and \nNatali (2013) found that while promoting gender equality \nfosters growth, there is no guarantee that economic growth \nwill foster gender equality on its own in the absence of \nsupportive measures such as promoting female education. \nGirls and women often suffer from unequal access to \neducation, health care, finance, and technology, especially in \ndeveloping\u00a0economies.\n\nMany economies have yet to tap the full potential of female \nparticipation in the workforce. A vast literature on gender \ninequality shows that female labor participation contributes \ntangibly to social development and inclusive growth. The \n\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) (2019) reported \nthat 132\u00a0million school-aged girls are currently not in school, \nand about 14.95 million girls are married off as child brides. \nThe economic cost of child marriage may be as high as \nUSD1.7\u00a0billion in Niger relative to delaying the girls\u2019 marriage \nage to 20 (World Economic Forum 2018, World Bank 2019). \nUsing industry-level data for a group of developing economies \nin the 1990s, Bertay, Dordevic, and Sever (2020) found that \nallocating female labor to more productive uses significantly \nboosts economic growth. As such, increased female labor \nparticipation is imperative and should be given high priority in \nthe public policy agenda. \n\nPoor sanitation and lack of access to affordable housing are \nsocial problems that reduce human well-being and social and \neconomic development (World Health Organization [WHO] \n2019). A large number of economy-level studies confirm \nthat the failure to address these issues heightens the risk of \nhealth problems and lowers productivity. UNICEF and WHO \n(2017) report that while 2.1 billion people gained access to \nbasic sanitation services between 2000 and 2017, 2.0 billion \npeople still lack such access. A cost\u2013benefit analysis by WHO \nin 2012 found that USD1.0 invested in sanitation generates \nan average economic return of USD5.5 in terms of lower \nhealth costs, higher productivity, and fewer premature deaths. \nWithin Asia, the returns are USD8.8 in East Asia and USD5.0 \nin Southeast\u00a0Asia.\n\nBased on UN data, only 13 of the world\u2019s cities have adequate \naffordable housing (UN HABITAT 2016). Affordable housing \npolicies not only promote social stability but also provide \neconomic opportunities. For instance, many SMEs are home-\nbased enterprises that provide work, income, and services \nfor many people (Tipple 2005). In addition, affordable \nhousing enables the clustering of younger people who are \nindispensable for the knowledge economy (Florida 2019). \n\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a multidimensional \nglobal public health crisis (Manisalidis et al. 2020). The \npandemic\u2019s lingering effects on physical and mental health \nwill be more numerous and varied than what medical experts \ninitially expected (Mayo Clinic 2020, Couzin-Frankel 2020). \nWhile a healthy and productive workforce is an important \ningredient of sustainable and inclusive economic growth \n(UN 2019), COVID-19\u2019s persistent effects will impact the \nproductivity of the workforce in many economies.\n\nEncouragingly, many economies have begun to adopt \nsustainable and socially responsible practices. Economy-\nlevel evidence points to a significant and positive impact \n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fFinancing a Sustainable Recovery \u200345\n\nBox 5:  Environmental and Social Externalities and Economic Growth and Development \n\ncontinued\n\nof improved environment, social, and governance (ESG) \npolicies on economic growth (Wang, Yu, and Zhong 2020). \nThe effect is larger in countries with stronger ESG incentives, \nmore robust corporate and social responsibility, and effective \nlaw enforcement systems (Wang, Yu, and Zhong 2020). In a \nsimilar vein, governments with a better ESG performance can \nimprove market risk perception and thus benefit from lower \ngovernment bond spreads and financing costs (Crifo, Diaye, \nand Oueghlissi 2017). Granular firm-level studies show that \nstronger ESG policies in the corporate sector have a significant \nand positive effect on national-level economic performance. \nIn a study of 30 economies at different income levels, Zhou et \nal. (2020) show that a 1-percentage-point increase in average \neconomic, social, and governance performance leads to gains \nof 0.06%, 0.09%, and 0.16%, respectively, in the log of GDP \nper capita. The results hold for both developed economies \nwith more systematic ESG policies and, more interestingly, \nfor developing economies too. This suggests that a proactive \nadoption of stronger ESG policies can contribute to growth \n(Tarmuji, Maelah, and Tarmuji 2016). \n\nA fresh perspective that recognizes and strengthens the \nnexus between environmental and social factors on one \nhand, and economic growth on the other, is the blueprint for \nsustainable development in the future. With appropriate and \nconducive policies that protect the environment and address \nvarious social needs, governments can become catalysts of \nsustainable development.\n\nReferences\n\nAsian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

This means that the region must leverage \nand mobilize resources from the private sector to finance \ninvestments promoting green and inclusive economic \ngrowth that reduces poverty, benefits vulnerable groups, and \ndecreases inequality. \n\nExtant environment, social, and governance (ESG) debt \ninstruments can be broadly classified into two major \ncategories: bonds and loans. Widely used bond instruments \ninclude green bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, \nand sustainability-linked bonds. These are fixed-income \nproducts designed to fund investments that generate positive \nenvironmental and social outcomes. On the other hand,  \nESG-themed loans such as green loans and sustainability-\nlinked loans (SLLs) are bank products that finance or \nrefinance, in whole or in part, new and/or existing eligible \n\nprojects with clear benefits to the environment and social \nsustainability.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), \ngreen and social financing was clearly on the rise, making it \none of the most promising areas in development finance.c \nGreen bonds were the forerunner of ESG bonds. The total \nglobal value of green bonds grew from USD1.5 billion to \nUSD257.5 billion between 2007 and 2019. Green bonds \ncomprised the largest category of ESG bond issuances in \n2019, accounting for more than half (56%) of issuance in the \nsustainable debt market. Figure B6.1 shows the growth of \nglobal green bonds, which have gained traction in Asia and the \nPacific, with the region now accounting for 12% of global green \nbonds. According to Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) data, \nthe issuance of green bonds in Asia and the Pacific reached \nUSD33.1 billion in 2019. In Southeast Asia, which accounts for \nabout 25% of the regional total, issuance nearly doubled to \nUSD8.1 billion in 2019 from USD4.1 billion in 2018.\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, a slowdown in the green \nbond market\u2019s expansion has been observed and attributed \nto investors\u2019 shifting appetite toward social and sustainability \n\nFigure B6.1: Green Bond Issuance\n\nFigure B6.1a\n\nUSD billion\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nFigure B6.1b\n\nUSD billion\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n50\n\n0\n\nUSD billion\n1,000\n\n950\n\n900\n\n850\n\n800\n\n750\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nAfrica\nNorth America\n\nLatin America\nEurope\n\nAsia Paci\ufb01c\nSupranational\n\nJan\n-20\n\nFeb\n-20\n\nMar\n-20\n\nApr\n-20\n\nMay\n-20\n\nJun\n-20\n\nJul\n-20\n\nAug\n-20\n\nMonthly\n\nTotal (RHS)\n\nRHS = right-hand side, USD = United States dollar. \nSources: Authors\u2019 compilations based on data from Climate Bonds Initiative monthly market blogs and HSBC.\n\na \n\nb \nc \n\n This box was written by Cynthia Castillejos-Petalcorin (Senior Economics Officer) and Donghyun Park (Principal Economist) in the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n ADB. 2017.

In Asia and the Pacific, the CBI noted that \nissuance in the second quarter (Q2) fell to its lowest level \nsince the first quarter (Q1) of 2017, with January\u2013June 2020 \ngreen bond issuance amounting to only USD10.7 billion. \nDespite the market downturn in 2020, green bonds have still \nheld up better than investment-grade corporate credit.d\n\nEven as green bond issuance slows, the COVID-19 \npandemic has heightened the need to support vulnerable \ngroups and improve public health and sanitization, \nunderscoring the urgent need for social and sustainability \nfinancing. There has been significant growth in social and \nsustainability bond issuance as sovereigns and corporates \ntap the debt market. Social bond issuance rose from a \nmere USD277\u00a0million in 2014 to USD20.0 billion in 2019, \naccording to the CBI. In the first half of 2020, social bond \nissuance reached USD10.9\u00a0billion in Q1 2020 and then tripled \nto USD33.0\u00a0billion in Q2 2020.

Issuance volume totaled USD63.6 billion in Q1 2020 \nbefore more than doubling to USD130.9 billion in Q2 2020. \nConsequently, Asia and the Pacific (including Japan) now \naccounts for 16% of the global sustainability bond market. \nWithin the region, large social bond issuances, from both \nsovereigns and corporates, came from the Republic of \nKorea (USD9.5 billion), Japan (USD9.3 billion), the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (USD0.9 billion), India (USD0.5 billion), \nand the Philippines (USD0.4 billion).e A common use of the \nproceeds has been to extend loans to financially strapped \nsmall businesses and to finance development of coronavirus \nvaccines.\n\nThe issuance of sustainability bonds, whose proceeds are \nused for green and social projects, stood at USD46.0\u00a0billion \nin full-year 2019. With increased attention from investors, \nsustainability bond issuance volume exploded to \nUSD56.7\u00a0billion during the first half of 2020, more than twice \nthe amount issued in the first half of 2019. The number of \nissuances soared by 94% from the previous year, according to \nRefinitiv. Some of the largest issuances of sustainability bonds \nin Asia and the Pacific to date in 2020 include (i) Japan\u2019s \nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group issuance in September \nworth JPY150 billion (USD1.42 billion); (ii) the Government \nof Thailand\u2019s dual-tranche USD966 million bond issuance \nin September, the first of its kind among members of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, which was three \ntimes oversubscribed; and (iii) a triple-tranche offer of USD-\ndenominated bonds by the Government of Indonesia in June \nworth USD4.3 billion, including a USD1 billion bond with a \n50-year tenor, a first in Indonesian history.f A sukuk (Islamic \nbond) variant of ESG-themed bonds was also issued by \nIndonesia in June 2020, raising another USD2.5 billion from a \ntriple-tranche global sukuk that was 6.7 times oversubscribed.g \nThe common theme of the aforementioned issuances is the \nfinancing of activities to help cope with the impact of the \npandemic. \n\nInterestingly, investors remain keen on pandemic-related \nbonds despite the risk associated with weaker global \n\nd \n\n C.

Moody\u2019s Investors Service revised its \nforecast for social and sustainability bond volumes to \nUSD150\u00a0billion in 2020, up from its previous forecast of \nUSD100 billion.h \n\nSimilar trends have been observed for green and social-\nthemed loans. The demand for SLL products picked up in \n2019, peaking in the fourth quarter, as this modality facilitates \nthe entry of companies into sustainable financing. SLL \nlending volume jumped 89% from USD188.3 billion in 2018 \nto USD122 billion in 2019.i However, in the first half of 2020, \nsustainable lending fell to USD79.1 billion, slightly declining \nfrom the same period in 2019. During Q2 2020, a total of \nUSD31.9 billion of SLL products was issued (Figure B6.3).\n\nNotwithstanding the strong demand for ESG blended bonds \nand loans, there are some concerns, especially as they relate \nto the lack of ESG ratings standardization. This should not \nimpact the issuance of much-needed ESG financing, but \nrather could be a catalyst in fast-tracking efforts to harmonize \nand strengthen ESG ratings information.

It has become \none of the fastest growing areas in development finance in \nrecent years.a Green and social finance helps address E&S \nissues such as food security, renewable and clean energy, \naffordable and accessible housing, healthcare, quality jobs, \nenvironmental protection, and education, among others \n(Camilleri 2020). By\u00a0allocating capital to socially responsible \nand environmentally sustainable projects, and pricing the risks \nof negative externalities, green and social finance can guide \ninvestments toward generating positive externalities for the \nnatural environment and vulnerable groups. \n\nThe literature has discussed the different motivations of \ninvestors to avoid negative green and social externalities. First, \nE&S practice serves as insurance against systematic risk in \nthe economy. Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017) suggested \nthat (i) corporates can build social capital via practicing \nsocial responsibility, and (ii) a high level of social capital \nstrengthens the perception of trustworthiness and thus boosts \ntrust among stakeholders. Lins, Servaes, and Tamayo (2017) \nfound that social capital pays off during a crisis when overall \nconfidence is low and the value of trust increases. Specifically, \nthey document that, during a crisis, firms with a higher level \nof social responsibility show superior performance than their \npeers in terms of profitability, productivity, and fund-raising \nability, as they are supported by stakeholders\u2019 commitment \nto help such as through credit lines and sales. Hence, \ninvestments with positive E&S externalities offer insurance \nbenefits against systematic risk such as a financial crisis or \na pandemic. Similarly, Albuquerque, Koskinen, and Zhang \n(2019) developed a model showing that firms with social \nresponsibility policies have lower profit elasticity in response \nto aggregate shocks, resulting in less systematic risk and \nhigher firm valuations. They document supportive empirical \nevidence for this prediction. \n\nSecond, E&S compliance helps hedge against negative \ncorporate events and the idiosyncratic risks of firms. E&S \npractices serve as reputation capital that help cushion \nagainst shocks or future E&S negative incidents. Godfrey, \nMerrill, and Hansen (2009) found that businesses\u2019 voluntary \nactions to improve social conditions create moral capital \nthat provides insurance-like benefits and gains positive \nattribution from stakeholders. Facing negative corporate \n\nevents, this buffering of goodwill from stakeholders will \nreduce negative judgement and sanctions, and reduce the \nloss of shareholder value. Empirical evidence shows that \ncompared to firms following an E&S initiative, firms that \ndo not have an E&S practice will face huge costs\u2014which \nreduces capital expenditure and eventually affects their  \ncore business in the context of negative E&S incidents  \n(Ho, Nguyen, and Vu 2020)\u2014and experience greater \nreductions in firm value because of reputational damage \n(Aouadi and Marsat 2018). When corporates are involved \nin E&S scandals, investors face risk. Chen, Dong, and Lin \n(2020) have indicated that institutional investors can lower \nportfolio risk more by controlling negative externalities than \nby boosting positive externalities. \n\nThird, E&S investment can be motivated by preferences \nand signaling for sustainability and social responsibility by \nvarious stakeholders such as managers, shareholders, clients, \nand society at large. Riedl and Smeets (2017) showed that \nboth intrinsic social preference (without self-benefit) and \nsocial signaling (with self-benefit such as social image and \nreputation) of investors play important roles in investing \nin E&S assets, and investors forgo financial returns via \nsustainable and responsible mutual funds by bearing higher \nmanagement fees and lower returns. Similarly,  Bia\u0142kowski \nand Starks (2016) found that flows into sustainable and \nresponsible mutual funds show greater persistence than flows \ninto conventional funds, as they are also driven by clients\u2019 \nnonfinancial considerations. Similarly, Ghoul and Karoui \n(2017) documented that fund flows are less sensitive to the \nperformance of mutual funds that hold more assets with \nhigh social responsibility levels, which is driven by clients\u2019 \nnonfinancial utility. Social norms and pressures also motivate \nE&S investment. Dyck et al. (2019) showed that institutional \ninvestment has a causal impact on holding companies\u2019 E&S \nperformance. This impact is more pronounced for investors \ncommitted to E&S activism and for foreign investors from \ncountries with strong social norms. \n\nFourth, investing in E&S-themed assets can help manage \nportfolio risks during a transition to low-carbon investments. \nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures \n(2017) outlined key climate-related risks (transition risk \nand physical risk) and opportunities during a low-carbon \ntransition that have financial implications for companies.b \n\na \n\nb \n\n This box was written by Shu Tian (Economist) and Mai Lin Villaruel (Economics Officer) in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank.\n Transition risk includes policy and legal risks due to changes in regulations and litigation, technology risk due to creative destruction in green technology, market risk due to \nclimate-related changes in market supply and demand, and reputation risk due to stakeholders\u2019 changing perceptions toward green development. Physical risk includes acute \nrisk from disasters and chronic risk driven by climate change patterns. Opportunities include resource efficiency and energy sources to save costs, products and services with \nlow-emission features, markets with new opportunities, and resilience to better respond to climate-related risks.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fFinancing a Sustainable Recovery \u200351\n\nBox 7: Why Environmental and Social Externalities Matter for Financial Markets\u2003continued\n\nDafermos, Nikolaidi, and Galanis (2018) found that climate \nchange will harm both the financial and nonfinancial sectors \nby weakening the economic fundamentals of firms, thereby \nleading to financial instability. Dikau and Volz (2020) \nindicated that climate-related risks challenge monetary and \nfinancial stability, which has led central banks to consider \nincorporating climate-related risks into their macroprudential \npolicy framework to safeguard macro-financial stability. For \nexample, climate change may adversely affect price stability \nby influencing food and energy prices, which indirectly affects \ncore inflation (Volz 2017). \n\nIn recent years, climate- and social-related risks have \nattracted attention that may challenge financial stability \nand thus invite new macroprudential policies. The Bank for \nInternational Settlements (2019) has indicated that climate \nchange risk may pose a new type of systematic risk to financial \nstability.\n \nThe outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has \nunderscored the role of financial stability amid shocks when \nbusinesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, \nhave difficulty repaying their liabilities (Asian Development \nBank 2020). As risks associated with climate change and \nsocial inclusiveness have gained regulatory and central bank \nattention in terms of the need to improve macroprudential \npractices, investments with E&S impacts can help boost \nportfolio resilience and strengthen the financial sector \nregulatory framework. \n\nSuch risks already show a real impact on financing costs and \ninvestment portfolios. In financial markets, investors have \ndifferent incentives with regard to E&S externalities. Investors \ninfluence business investments via different mechanisms, \nsuch as ownership and monitoring efforts (Chen, Dong, \nand Lin 2020) and by conveying a preference for improved \nE&S performance (Dyck et al. 2019). Ethical investors \nsuch as green investors are also essential in risk-sharing in \nfinancial markets and thus can affect the cost of capital \namong polluting firms shifting to low-carbon operations \n(Heinkel, Kraus, and Zechner 2001). Rich evidence has been \ndocumented showing that firms with environmental concerns \nhave a less diversified investor base and a higher cost of \ncapital (Seltzer, Starks, and Zhu 2020; Painter 2020; Battiston \nand Monasterolo 2020; de Greiff, Delis, and Ongena 2018;  \nNg and Rezaee 2015; and Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz 2020), \nwhile firms pursuing E&S practices, such as issuing green \nbonds, benefit from better investor profiles and a lower cost of \ncapital (Ghoul et al. 2011, Chava 2014). \n\nReferences\n\nAsian Development Bank. 2020.

Such knowledge will facilitate \npolicy making and increase market participation in green and \nsocial finance for sustainable development.\n\nThe literature has extensively discussed the economic \nimpact of green and social finance from different aspects \nsuch as company value, cost of funding, employment, \ngreen innovation, and investor base. From the business and \nshareholder perspective, tapping green and social finance \nhas positive impacts on firm value, and it therefore benefits \nshareholders. The literature has also documented that \nfirms with superior social responsibility and environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) performances have a lower \ncost of capital, a better credit rating, and improved financial \nperformance (Goss and Roberts 2011, Chava 2014). Green \nand social finance provides direct funding for companies to \nmake clean investments in climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, and signals a commitment to emissions reduction \nand sustainable production. With increasing awareness of \nsocial responsibility among the investor community, such \nsignals generate positive feedback from financial markets, \nwhich benefits companies through higher firm values, lower \nfunding costs, and a broadened investor base.\n\nEvidence has shown that tapping green and social financing is \nrelated to higher firm values. Tang and Zhang (2020) showed \nthat when companies announce a green bond issuance, their \nstocks witnessed an average 1.72% cumulative abnormal \nreturn over a 20-day event window and had about 7% more \nliquidity compared with matched firms. The authors attribute \nthis favorable market reaction to positive signaling, better \ninformation transparency, greater investor attention, and an \nexpanded investor base. Flammer (2020) also documented \nhow positive stock market reactions to green bond issuance \nannouncements are stronger for first-time green bond issuers \nand certified green bond issuers. Zhou and Cui (2019) found \nthat companies\u2019 green bond issuances are associated with \nimproved profitability such as return on invested capital, net \nprofit margin on sales, and return on assets. \n\nAs a leading green and social finance instrument, the cost of \ngreen bonds has attracted extensive discussion. Green bonds \n\nare documented to generate similar or lower costs compared \nto matched conventional bonds (Ehlers and Packer 2017, \nBaker et al. 2018, Hachenberg and Schiereck 2018, and Zerbib \n2019). A strong environmental commitment\u2014as evidenced \nby green labels, green bond certification, and independent \nverification\u2014also generates significant cost advantages for \ngreen bond issuers. Such issuers benefit from a yield reduction \nof 8 basis points compared to conventional bonds (Gianfrate \nand Peri 2019) and 6 basis points relative to peer green bonds \n(Hyun, Park, and Tian 2020). One key driver for the yield \nbenefit on green bonds is the high demand for green bonds \ngiven their limited supply.b The Climate Bonds Initiative has \nfrequently reported oversubscriptions for new green bond \nofferings in its series of market monitoring reports, indicating \nprevailing investor perceptions of excess demand for green \nbonds relative to supply. \n\nThe cost convenience of green bonds also holds when \ncompared to bank loans. Alonso-Conde and Rojo-Su\u00e1rez \n(2020) evaluated the impacts of green bonds versus \nconventional bank loan financing on the profitability of an \nenvironmentally friendly project. They found that investments \nfinanced by green bonds earn a higher internal rate of return \nfor shareholders, which was driven by the lower financing \ncosts of green bonds relative to bank loans. They argue that \ngreen finance provides economic and financial incentives for \nshareholders of green projects and helps align shareholders\u2019 \nobjectives with the United Nations Sustainable Development \nGoals.\n\nIn addition to higher firm values and lower costs, tapping \ngreen and social financing has been shown to broaden the \nissuer base and attract new types of investors such as ethical \ninvestors and socially responsible investment funds. Giudice \n(2017) summarized a number of studies conducted by major \ninvestment banks and found that around 89% of all investors \nexpressed an interest in or are familiar with sustainable \ninvestments, and 65% of them are already conducting \nsustainable investing. Rising awareness of sustainable \ninvestments enables the broadening of the investor base as \ncompanies signal their environmental and social commitment \nby tapping social and green finance. Empirical evidence \nindicates that green bond issuances help sovereigns and \ncorporates attract new investors and that these green bond \ninvestors have a long-term investment horizon. By issuing \ngreen bonds, companies see increased bond ownership \namong long-term and ethical investors (Flammer 2020).\n\na \n\n This box was written by Shu Tian (Economist) and Mai Lin Villaruel (Economics Officer) in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank.

Nemoto and Lian (2020) \nshowed that Japanese firms with higher corporate social \nresponsibility rankings demonstrated greater resilience amid \nmarket turmoil in the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. Amundi (2020) \nfound that during the market sell-off in March 2020, ESG-\nthemed funds showed greater resilience than conventional \nfunds, with 62% of large ESG funds outperforming the MSCI \nWorld Index. \n\nIn addition, investing in green- and social-themed instruments \nhelps investors to meet client demand and preferences for \nsustainability and responsibility. During the past decade, \nincreasing awareness of climate change has directed more \nfunding into many sustainability-themed sectors, such as \nclean energy, green building, sustainable transport, energy \nefficiency, pollution prevention, climate adaptation, and \nsustainable agriculture (Lee, Thwing-Eastman, and Marshall \n2020). Such awareness among stakeholders has also directed \ninvestors, especially institutional investors, to invest in \nenvironmental initiatives. Recent developments in the green \nand social finance market\u2014such as international standards, \nprinciples, and independent certifiers\u2014has strengthened \ninvestor confidence in terms of reputation risk.\n\nGreen and social finance also provides funding to support a \nlow-carbon transition. Policy makers face complex decision-\nmaking scenarios in which some sectors will be negatively \naffected during the redistribution of investment toward a \nlow-carbon economy. Evidence shows that green and social \nfinance contributes to economic development by directing \ninvestment toward high value-added sectors. Glomsr\u00f8d and \nTaoyuan (2016, 2018) found that green finance (i.e., labeled \ngreen bonds) can help shift investment from coal industries to \nother high value-added industries, which will increase future \nsavings and investment, and lead to a 1.6% increase in gross \ndomestic product among sample economies. The reallocation \nof investment via green finance also leads to a 2%\u20134% lower \nrate of return on capital, as well as income redistribution since \nincome is shifted from investors to wage earners. The income \nredistribution also contributes to demand and gross domestic \nproduct growth.\n\nEmployment is a key factor to consider as the energy sector \nexperiences low-carbon reform. Renewable energies are \nwidely recognized for their potential for green job creation, \ngiven their less capital-intensive and more labor-intensive \nbusiness nature. Ram, Aghahosseini, and Breyer (2020) \nargue that renewable technologies can create jobs during the \nlow-carbon transition. Under the assumption that the world\u2019s \nelectricity generation will be entirely from renewable sources \nby 2050, they project that the number of jobs directly related \nto energy will be 35 million globally, or 1.5 times as high as the \n2015 level of around 21 million jobs, with solar photovoltaic \nreplacing coal as the leading job-creating technology in \nthe electricity sector and accounting for around 64% of \ntotal jobs in the sector by 2050. Green finance through the \ndirect funding of low-carbon investments will contribute to \nemployment and local economic development. Using both \ncomputable general equilibrium and input\u2013output models, \nPerrier and Quirion (2018) find that shifting investment \ntoward low-carbon sectors yields jobs if the investment is \ndirected to sectors with relatively lower wages and a higher \nshare of labor in value added. They suggest that a double \ndividend (employment and environmental) can be achieved \nby encouraging the development of low-carbon, labor-\nintensive sectors. \n\nAnother important issue that matters for economic \ndevelopment is innovation. Green and social finance can \nprovide funding to facilitate innovation in green technologies. \nFor example, Zhou and Cui (2019) showed that green bond \nissuance is positively associated with the innovation capacity \nof companies, as evidenced by year-on-year growth in total \nresearch and development expenses, and in research and \ndevelopment expenses as a share of total operational income. \nGreen innovation has also been found to be positively related \nto firms\u2019 profitability (Aguilera-Caracuel and Ortiz-De-\nMandojana 2013). \n\nGreen and social finance can facilitate the transition to an \nenvironmentally friendly and inclusive future. Besides the \npositive externalities it delivers, green and social finance can \nalso provide the world with economic benefits. However, \ngiven the huge amount of funding needed to meet the \npledged climate change targets, the size of green and social \nfinance remains relatively small. Action is needed to develop \nthe market and mobilize more resources to address social and \nenvironmental challenges.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n\fFinancing a Sustainable Recovery \u200355\n\nBox 8: Economic Consequences of Green and Social Finance\u2003continued\n\nReferences\n\nJ.

Bond market \ndevelopment can affect bank efficiency in many aspects. \nFirst, bond markets compete with the banking sector not \nonly for loans but also for deposits. Government bonds \nserve as an alternative risk-free investment vehicle for \ndepositors; therefore, banks need to increase deposit \nrates to attract more funding. Meanwhile, corporate bond \nmarkets provide an alternative source of financing for the \nprivate sector, which becomes a potential competitor \nof banks. Firms with the highest credit quality have the \noption to tap bond markets for financing via corporate \nbond issuances. Hence, a large bond market will force \nbanks to improve the efficiency of their asset allocation \nto maintain profitability and challenge banks\u2019 cost \nefficiency given possible higher funding costs. Second, \nbond markets offer more investment instruments for \nbanks\u2019 asset portfolios. Banks can invest in government \nbonds and high-rated corporate bonds, thus better \nmanaging the liquidity and credit quality of their asset \nportfolios, albeit at the cost of lower returns. Third, banks \ncan issue corporate bonds to obtain stable financing with \nthe desired maturity, which can mitigate the duration \ngap between assets and liabilities on banks\u2019 balance \nsheets, albeit with higher funding costs. Fourth, bond \n\nmarkets provide market-based benchmarking for banks \nto price their loans and deposits. Hence, bond market \ndevelopment affects banks\u2019 operation in terms of \nassets and liability management, as well as liquidity risk \nmanagement.  \n\nWhile many developing economies\u2019 financial systems \nremain largely bank-centered, recent decades have seen \nthe rapid development of capital markets. Thus, it is \nimportant to understand how bond market development \nis related to the profit and cost efficiencies of commercial \nbanks. This study constructs a sample of commercial \nbanks from 27 economies in Asia and the Pacific from \n2004 to 2017 and considers how their efficiency is \nrelated to three bond market development indicators: \n(i)\u00a0aggregated bond market size as a share of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), (ii) government bond market \nsize as share of GDP, and (iii) corporate bond market \nsize as a share of GDP. In addition to bond market \ndevelopment, a number of other related variables are also \nconsidered in this study, including economic, banking-\nindustry, and bank-specific attributes such as GDP \ngrowth, inflation, income level, banking sector openness \nand regulation, bank size, and leverage ratio. \nThis study utilizes parametric stochastic frontier analysis \nto estimate bank efficiency. This technique provides \nunbiased systematic estimates for an unbalanced \npanel data sample during which bank efficiency can be \ninfluenced by country-specific and bank-specific factors, \nand thus is widely used in cross-economy studies. The \ndependent variable is bank profit or cost inefficiency; \nthus, the negative sign of a coefficient will indicate that \nthe variable has a positive impact on bank profit or cost \nefficiency.  \n\nThe empirical results are presented in two parts. The \nfirst is the effect of overall bond market development. \nThe development of all three bond market types \n\n7\u2002 This is shortened version of D. Park, S. Tian, and Q. Wu. 2020. Bank Efficiency and the Bond Markets: Evidence from the Asia and Pacific Region. Asian Development Bank Economics \n\nWorking Paper Series. No. 612. https://www.adb.org/publications/bank-efficiency-bond-markets-asia-pacific.\n\n\f(i.e.,\u00a0aggregate, corporate, and government) has a positive \neffect on bank profit efficiency but a negative effect \non bank cost efficiency. The results are robust when \ncontrol variables are introduced. The effect is persistently \nsignificant for the total bond market and the government \nbond market, but not for the corporate bond market. The \nresults indicate that banks are generally more profit-\nefficient, but less cost-efficient, in an economy with a \nrelatively more developed bond market (Figure 14). This \nfinding confirms the competitor role of bond markets. \nWhen large clients can tap corporate bond markets for \nfinancing, banks are forced to lend to smaller clients \nby improving asset management skills and profitability. \nMeanwhile, a larger government bond market means \ndeposit pricing is more market-based, which will increase \nbanks\u2019 funding costs. In addition, when banks issue \nbonds to finance themselves, they also face higher costs. \nThus, a developed bond market is associated with lower \ncost efficiency. Consistent with the relevant literature, \nthe results show that banks are generally more efficient \nin economies with a higher degree of capital account \nopenness, more constraints on cross-border investment, \nfaster economic growth, a lower inflation rate, and higher \nincome levels. As for bank attributes, larger banks are \nmore profit-efficient but less cost-efficient, and a higher \ncapital ratio reduces (increases) bank profit (cost) \nefficiency. Banking-industry specific characteristics have \na mixed effect on bank efficiency. Less stringent banking \nentry requirements, higher asset concentration, greater \nsupervisory independence and private monitoring power, \n\nFigure 14: Effect of the Level of Bond Market \nDevelopment on Bank Inefficiency (% of GDP)\n\nBank Efficiency and Bond Markets: Evidence from Asia and the Pacific\u200357\n\nand a higher rate of foreign ownership of banks all help to \nimprove bank profit efficiency, while the impacts of these \nfactors on bank cost efficiency are trivial. \n\nThe second part of the results looks beyond the level \nof bond market development and examines the impact \nof bond market structure on bank profit and cost \nefficiencies. The result shows that while total bond \nmarket development has a positive and significant impact \non bank profit efficiency, the share of corporate bonds \nto total bond market size has a positive but insignificant \neffect on bank profit efficiency (Figure 15). Furthermore, \na larger share of local currency (LCY) corporate bonds \nas share of total LCY bonds is found to significantly \nimprove bank profit efficiency, while the positive and \nsignificant impact of total bond market size remains. The \nstructure of the corporate bond market has a mixed effect \non bank cost efficiency. The role of total bond market \nsize on banks\u2019 cost efficiency remains insignificant, but \na larger share of corporate bonds to total bonds shows \na significant role in improving banks\u2019 cost efficiency. \nHowever, when LCY corporate bonds as a share of total \nLCY bonds is considered in the analysis, total bond \nmarket size showed a significant negative impact on bank \ncost efficiency.\n\nOverall, we find that bond market development has \nimportant implications for the banking sector.

They also offer asset and liability pricing \nbenchmarks. On\u00a0the assets end, the competition and \nasset pool effects benefit banks with higher profit \nefficiency as banks improve asset allocation and build \ncapacity to extend more loans to smaller clients that do \nnot have access to capital markets that could increase \nreturns on assets. Meanwhile, a larger bond market \nlowers banks\u2019 overall cost efficiency because government \nbonds compete for depositors and force banks to \nraise costs on deposits, and bank bond issuance also \ncomes with higher costs than deposits. The structure \nof the bond market also matters to bank efficiency as \ngovernment bonds and corporate bonds have different \nimplications for banks. \n\nThe findings of this paper have important policy \nimplications for economies with a very low level of bond \nmarket development, or those without a functioning \nbond market, and for economies with a high level of bond \nmarket development but an unbalanced bond market \nstructure. The bond market works like a double-edged \nsword for bank management. On the asset side, banks \ncan invest in the corporate bond market to diversify risk \nin their asset portfolios, but they also face competition \nfrom the corporate bond market in that some clients \nwill use direct financing from the bond market. On the \nliability side, banks may obtain stable funding from the \ncorporate bond market, but they need to pay higher \nfinancing costs as government bonds compete for \ndeposits and lead to higher funding costs for bank \nbond financing.  Policy makers need to ensure a well-\nfunctioning and balanced bond market to better finance \neconomic growth and development.\n\n\f \nMarket Summaries\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nYield Movements\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) yield curve for \nlocal currency (LCY) bonds shifted upward between \n31\u00a0August and 30 October (Figure 1).

The PRC\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate accelerated from \n3.2%\u00a0year-on-year (y-o-y) in the second quarter (Q2) \nof 2020 to 4.9% y-o-y in the third quarter (Q3) of 2020. \nGrowth in all three major sectors of the PRC\u2019s economy \naccelerated in Q3 2020. The fastest y-o-y acceleration \nwas in the tertiary sector (from 1.9% to 4.3%), followed \nby the secondary sector (from 4.7% to 6.0%). The \nprimary sector\u2019s growth accelerated from 3.3% y-o-y to \n3.9%\u00a0y-o-y.\n\nThe PRC\u2019s industrial production growth momentum also \ncontinued. In September, industrial production growth \nrose to 6.9% y-o-y from 5.6% y-o-y in August. The PRC\u2019s \nindustrial production was negative in Q1 2020 and had a \ngrowth rate of 3.9% in April. The PRC\u2019s inflation rate fell to \n1.7% y-o-y in September from 2.4% y-o-y in August.\n\nSize and Composition\n\nLCY bonds outstanding in the PRC rose 5.4% quarter-on-\nquarter (q-o-q) in Q3 2020, after expanding 5.6%\u00a0q-o-q \nin Q2 2020, to reach CNY98.2 trillion (USD14.5 trillion) \nat the end of September. On a y-o-y basis, LCY bonds \noutstanding grew 19.9% y-o-y (Table 1).\n\nFigure 1: The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Benchmark \nYield Curve\u2014Local Currency Government Bonds\n\nYield (%)\n\n4.1\n\n3.6\n\n3.1\n\n2.6\n\n2.1\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nGovernment bonds. The PRC\u2019s government bond \nmarket growth accelerated in Q3 2020 to 6.6% q-o-q \nfrom 5.4%\u00a0q-o-q in Q2 2020 as the central government \ncontinued to fund its fiscal stimulus programs. The growth \nrate of Treasury bonds outstanding sped up to 8.7% q-o-q \nfrom 5.5% q-o-q during the same period.\n\nWhile local governments continued to issue special bonds \nand received a quota increase in 2020 of CNY1.6\u00a0trillion \ncompared with 2019, growth slowed slightly to 6.1%\u00a0q-o-q \nin Q3 2020 from 6.2% q-o-q in Q2 2020 due to a high \nbase effect. Growth in policy bank bonds accelerated to \n5.0%\u00a0q-o-q from 4.2% q-o-q in the same period.\n\nCorporate bonds. The PRC\u2019s corporate bond market\u2019s \ngrowth slowed to 3.2% q-o-q in Q3 2020 from \n5.9%\u00a0q-o-q in Q2 2020. The slowdown in growth was \nlargely due to the increased cost of funding as interest \nrates rose.\n\nRising interest rates led to a decline in commercial \npaper outstanding of 4.6% q-o-q in Q3 2020 (Table\u00a02). \nHigher interest rates make the refinancing of short-\nterm commercial paper more expensive.

Yields fell at the shorter-end of  \nthe yield curve as bonds with maturities of 3 years or  \nless shed an average of 6 basis points (bps). The 2-year \ntenor showed the largest drop at 12 bps. Yields rose at  \nthe longer-end of the curve, with the yield for the  \n10-year tenor inching up 1 bp, while the 15-year tenor \ngained 12 bps. The spread between the 2-year and  \n10-year tenors widened from 32 bps to 45 bps during \nthe\u00a0review period.\n\nHeightened uncertainty, brought about by the lingering \nimpact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and \nexacerbated by political risks, led to the drop in yields \nat the shorter-end of the curve. The rise in yields at the \nlonger-end of the curve reflected concerns about the \ndebt burden implied by the rising cost of the government\u2019s \nrelief efforts to boost the economy.\n\nDeclining yields also reflected the lingering weakness \nin Hong Kong, China\u2019s economy. Hong Kong, China\u2019s \ngross domestic product fell 3.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) \nin the third quarter (Q3) of 2020, a narrower decline \nthan the 9.0% y-o-y contraction in the second quarter \n(Q2). The improvement stemmed mainly from increased \nexports, particularly to the People\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China \n(PRC). Merchandise exports rose 3.9% y-o-y in Q3 2020, \nrebounding from the 2.2%\u00a0y-o-y decline in the prior \nquarter.

The HKMA noted that the latest \ndata based on Q2 2020 indicators signaled the need for \na higher CCyB of 2.5%. However, the HKMA deemed \nthat considering the high level of uncertainty facing the \neconomy, holding the CCyB steady at 1.0% was more \nappropriate. A lower CCyB releases additional liquidity \ninto the banking system by raising banks\u2019 lending capacity \nto support the economy. The CCyB is an integral part of \nthe Basel III regulatory capital framework designed to \nincrease the resilience of the banking sector in periods of \nexcess credit growth.\n\n\f68\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nIndonesia\n\nYield Movements\n\nLocal currency (LCY) government bond yields in \nIndonesia declined for most maturities between \n31\u00a0August and 30 October (Figure 1). Yields for bonds \nwith maturities of 4 years or less fell an average of \n37\u00a0basis points (bps), while yields shed an average of \n16\u00a0bps for maturities of 5 years or more. The exceptions \nto the declining trend in yields were the 7-year maturity, \nwhich gained by 7 bps, and the 3-year and 6-year bonds, \nwhich were unchanged during the review period. The \n2-year versus 10-year spread narrowed from 219 bps on \n31\u00a0August to 213 bps on 30 October.\n\nThe overall trend of declining yields was driven by \nexpectations that Bank Indonesia would continue to \nmaintain an easy monetary policy stance amid low inflation \nand a weak economic outlook. Bank Indonesia has kept its \n7-day reverse repurchase rate steady at 4.00% since July. \nThe policy rate had been lowered by a cumulative 100\u00a0bps \nyear-to-date through the end of October. While there was \nstill room to cut rates further, the central bank opted to \nutilize other monetary policy tools and macroprudential \nmeasures to ensure the stability of the Indonesian rupiah. \nIn its meeting held on 12\u201313\u00a0October, Bank Indonesia\u2019s \nBoard of Governors decided to hold its policy rate steady, \nwhile also keeping unchanged the deposit facility rate \nat 3.25% and the lending facility rate at 4.75%. At their \ncurrent levels, the rates were deemed appropriate to \nensure the rupiah\u2019s stability.\n\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in \nIndonesia has taken a toll on economic growth. A \nresurgence in the number of cases led the government \nto re-enforce social restrictions in September, further \ndampening investor sentiment in the bond market. This \nhas led foreign investor holdings in the LCY government \nbond market to drop from 30.2% at the end of June to \n27.0% at the end of September. In October however, \ninvestor interest picked up, leading to capital inflows for \nthe first time since July, buoyed by the passage of the \nOmnibus Bill on Job Creation that is expected to improve \ninvestment climate in Indonesia.\n\nReal gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second \nquarter (Q2) of 2020 contracted 5.3% year-on-year \n\nFigure 1: Indonesia\u2019s Benchmark Yield Curve\u2014 \nLocal Currency Government Bonds\n\nYield (%)\n8.2\n\n6.9\n\n5.6\n\n4.3\n\n3.0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\n(y-o-y) after a 3.0% y-o-y expansion in the first quarter. \nWhile economic recovery has slowly taken ground, gross \ndomestic product growth in the third quarter (Q3) of \n2020 weakened but at a slower pace.

For full-year 2020, the Ministry of Finance \nrevised downward its economic growth projection in \nSeptember to between \u20130.6% and \u20131.7% from its previous \nestimate of between \u20130.2% and \u20131.1% in August.\n\nAmong emerging East Asian currencies, the Indonesian \nrupiah depreciated the most year-to-date through \n30\u00a0October, falling 5.2% vis-\u00e0-vis the United States dollar.\n\nSize and Composition\n\nThe LCY bond market in Indonesia continued to expand \nto reach a size of IDR3,940.6 trillion (USD264.8 billion) \nat the end of September (Table 1). Overall growth \naccelerated to 9.9% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in \nQ3 2020 after rising 7.8% q-o-q in Q2 2020. The \nfaster growth stemmed largely from the expansion in \ngovernment bonds, particularly Treasury bills and bonds, \ndue to the government\u2019s increased borrowing needs \nto support its stimulus measures and recovery efforts \namid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Government bond yields remained \nrange-bound during the review period, with yield changes \nalmost negligible (Figure 1). Yields for 1-year, 5-year, \nand 10-year bonds rose 2 basis points (bps) on average. \nMeanwhile, the yield for tenors of less than 1\u00a0year fell 1\u00a0bp \non average, and the yield for the remaining tenors fell \n2 bps on average. The spread between the 2-year and \n10-year yield inched up to 73 bps from 69 bps during the \nreview period.\n\nYields at the shorter-end were almost unchanged amid \nexpectations of the Bank of Korea maintaining the base \nrate in its October monetary policy meeting. Meanwhile, \nyield movements in the rest of the curve were minimal \ngiven continued supply\u2013demand imbalances in the \ngovernment bond market and uncertainties in the \neconomic policy measures of major developing economies. \nOversupply concerns continued to impact market \nsentiment amid expectations of increased bond issuance \nfollowing the approval of the fourth supplementary budget \nand the release of the proposed 2021 fiscal budget.\n\nIn September, yields for tenors of more than 1 year \nsaw a decline, albeit by only 10 bps on average, as the \nannouncement of the Bank of Korea in the early part of \nthe month\u2014of plans to purchase up to KRW5 trillion \nof Korea Treasury Bonds by the end of 2020\u2014was \nnot enough to ease supply concerns. The pessimistic \noutlook on the Republic of Korea\u2019s economic growth \nalso contributed to the downward trend. However, this \ntrend was almost reversed in October leading up to the \nmonetary policy meeting and as market players awaited \nthe result of elections in the United States (US).\n\nOn 22 September, the National Assembly approved \nthe fourth supplementary budget to be used to provide \nsupport to various sectors hit by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The approved budget amounted \nto KRW7.8 trillion, bringing the aggregate supplementary \nbudgets to KRW62.2 trillion.

In October, the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance announced fiscal rules to address the rapid \nincrease in national debt resulting from increased bond \nissuances.\n\nOn 14 October, the Bank of Korea decided to leave the \nbase rate unchanged at 0.50% amid uncertainties that \ncould affect the global and domestic economic outlook. \nThe global economic recovery has slowed due to a \nresurgence in virus cases and uncertainties in economic \npolicy measures to be implemented in major developing \nmarkets. The same trend has been observed in the \ndomestic economy. Despite the recovery in exports, \nprivate consumption was dampened by the reimposition \nof lockdown measures as the number of new virus cases \nrose. The Bank of Korea expects risks to the economic \noutlook to remain elevated, maintaining its August \nforecast of a 1.3% contraction in economic growth in  \nfull-year 2020.\n\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s economy rebounded in the third \nquarter (Q3) of 2020, posting growth of 1.9% quarter-\non-quarter (q-o-q) in real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, based on advance estimates from the Bank \nof Korea, following a contraction of 3.2% q-o-q in the \nsecond quarter (Q2) of 2020. This was largely driven by \nthe 15.6% q-o-q jump in exports in Q3 2020 after a sharp \n16.1% q-o-q decline in the previous quarter. However, \nboth government and private consumption declined in \n\n\fRepublic of Korea\u200375\n\nQ3 2020. Private spending fell 0.1% q-o-q in Q3 2020, \na reversal from the 1.4% q-o-q increase in Q2 2020, as \nstricter lockdowns were re-implemented. Government \nspending also posted a decline of 0.1% q-o-q from \n1.5%\u00a0q-o-q growth in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, \ngross fixed capital formation fell at a faster pace of \n1.9%\u00a0q-o-q versus 0.4% q-o-q during the same period in \nreview. Consumer price inflation turned positive in July, \nreaching 0.3% y-o-y before gradually rising to 0.7% in \nAugust and 1.0% in September.\n\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s LCY bond market registered its \nfirst net foreign outflows for the year in September at \nKRW31 billion as foreign investors took profits, particularly \nfor short-term securities with tenors of less than 1 year. \nThe outflows from this category surpassed the foreign \nbuying volume of mid- to long-term tenors.\n\nThe Korean won strengthened during the review period, \nappreciating 4.7% versus the US dollar to KRW1,134.8 per \nUSD1.0 as of 30 October. This can be attributed to the \nweakening of the US dollar. Furthermore, the currency \nappreciation has been tied to the strengthening of the \nChinese yuan, as both currencies are linked through the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China being one of the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s major trading partners.\n\nSize and Composition\n\nThe size of the Republic of Korea\u2019s LCY bond \nmarket inched up 1.9% q-o-q to KRW2,602.1\u00a0trillion \n(USD2,223.7\u00a0billion) at the end of September (Table\u00a01). \n\nThe marginal growth was lower than the 3.1%\u00a0q-o-q \ngrowth posted in Q2 2020. Growth for the quarter \ncontinued to be mainly driven by the government sector, \nparticularly the rise in the stock of central government \nbonds, while the corporate segment rose at a slower pace. \nCompared with the same period in 2019, the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s domestic bond market rose 9.8% year-on-year \n(y-o-y), almost at par with the 9.5% y-o-y increase posted \nin Q2 2020.\n\nGovernment bonds. The outstanding size of the Republic \nof Korea\u2019s LCY government bond market rose 3.0% \nq-o-q to KRW1,069.1 trillion at end-September. The \nmain driver of the growth was the 4.2% q-o-q rise in \ncentral government bonds to KRW707.7 trillion. Bonds \nissued by state-owned entities also posted an increase of \n2.3%\u00a0q-o-q to KRW194.6 trillion. Monetary Stabilization \nBonds issued by the Bank of Korea registered a decrease \nof 1.3% q-o-q to KRW166.7 trillion.\n\nIssuance of government bonds declined in Q3 2020 to \nKRW99.1 trillion due to there being a higher base after \nissuance surged in Q2 2020 as the government needed \nto fund the supplementary budgets and other fiscal \nmeasures implemented to lessen the economic impact of \nthe pandemic.\n\nCorporate bonds. The Republic of Korea\u2019s LCY \ncorporate bond market posted marginal growth of \n1.1%\u00a0q-o-q in Q3\u00a02020, increasing the corporate bond \nstock to a size of KRW1,533.0 trillion at the end of \nSeptember.

The rating agency cited the Republic of Korea\u2019s \n\u201csteady macroeconomic performance, robust external \nfinances, and sufficient fiscal headroom\u201d as the reasons \nbehind the rating affirmation. These, along with other \ngovernment policies to control the spread of the virus, \nhave helped mitigate the economic impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, especially in comparison with its \nsimilarly rated peers. In addition, the rating agency also \nforecast a 1.1% economic contraction in 2020, based on a \ngradual recovery in the second half of the year supported \nby the rebound in exports in recent months. The fiscal \n\nRepublic of Korea\u200379\n\ndeficit for 2020 is also expected to widen to 4.4% of \nGDP in 2020 given the rise in government debt following \nfinancial stimulus to address the economic impact of the \nvirus, but it is still considered modest compared to its \npeers.\n\nPolicy, Institutional,  \nand Regulatory Developments\n\nThe National Assembly Passed  \nthe Fourth Supplementary Budget\n\nOn 22 September, the National Assembly passed \nthe fourth supplementary budget of 2020 worth \nKRW7.8\u00a0trillion. This brings the aggregate amount of all \nfour supplementary budgets to KRW62.2 trillion. The \nbudget is expected to fund additional COVID-19 relief \nprograms to support small businesses and low-income \nhouseholds.\n\nThe Republic of Korea  \nAnnounces New Fiscal Rules\n\nOn 5 October, the Government of the Republic of Korea \nannounced new fiscal rules to address the rapid increase \nin national debt. Although the economy\u2019s fiscal soundness \nand debt ratios are still considered low compared to its \nsimilarly rated peers, the government aims to maintain \nits fiscal sustainability. One rule is to maintain the \ngovernment-debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% and the \nconsolidated fiscal balance deficit at 3% or less of GDP. \nImplementation is expected to take effect starting in 2025 \nafter a transition period of 3 years.\n\nThe Bank of Korea and the People\u2019s Bank  \nof China Renew Currency Swap Agreement\n\nOn 22 October, the Bank of Korea and the People\u2019s\u00a0Bank \nof China signed the renewal of the Korean Won\u2013\nChinese Yuan Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement for \nanother 5\u00a0years.

Yields of tenors from 1 month to \n6 years declined an average of 10 basis points (bps). The \nlonger-end of the yield curve (from 7 years to 15 years) \nincreased an average of 2 bps, while the 30-year tenor \njumped 17 bps. The yield spread between 2-year and  \n10-year government bonds expanded from 84 bps to \n96\u00a0bps during the review period.\n\nYield (%)\n4.2\n\n3.5\n\n2.8\n\n2.1\n\n1.4\n\nFigure 1: Malaysia\u2019s Benchmark Yield Curve\u2014 \nLocal Currency Government Bonds\n\nThe decline in yields at the shorter-end of the curve can \nbe attributed to the effect of Bank Negara Malaysia\u2019s \n(BNM) cumulative 125-bps reduction in the overnight \npolicy rate year-to-date through 30 October. Attractive \nreal yields, which are driven by persistent consumer price \ndeflation and high liquidity in the financial system, also \ncontributed to high demand for government securities. \nAdding to the demand were foreign capital inflows \nafter Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and \nGovernment Investment Issues were given a higher weight \nin the JP Morgan Government Bond Index\u2013Emerging \nMarket Index in September.\n\nOn the other hand, the low demand for long-term securities \nreflects some investors\u2019 flight to safety amid uncertainties \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nExcess supply concerns may also be a factor as Malaysia\u2019s \nfiscal deficit is projected to increase following the \ngovernment\u2019s stimulus programs that will be funded  \nthrough domestic borrowing. In August, Malaysia\u2019s \nParliament raised the government\u2019s debt ceiling to 60%  \nof its gross domestic product from 55% as part of measures \nto counter the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBNM\u2019s monetary policy committee previously reduced \nits policy rate in July but decided to keep it steady at \n1.75% during its latest meeting in September given \nthe committee\u2019s cautiously optimistic outlook for the \neconomy. Despite some resurgence in COVID-19 cases, \nanalysts expect BNM to maintain its policy rate during its \nmeeting in November as its accommodative and stimulus \npackages are deemed sufficient to support the economy \nduring the pandemic.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s economy contracted 2.7% year-on-\nyear (y-o-y) in the third quarter (Q3) of 2020, an \n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nimprovement from the contraction of 17.1% y-o-y in the \nsecond quarter (Q2) of 2020, as economic activities \nresumed after the easing of Movement Control Order \nmeasures. The sharp decline in Q2 2020 prompted \nthe World Bank in September to downgrade its full-\nyear 2020 economic growth forecast for Malaysia to \n\u20134.9%\u00a0y-o-y from \u20133.1%\u00a0y-o-y in June. This was in line \nwith BNM\u2019s forecast for growth of between \u20135.5% y-o-y \nand \u20133.5%\u00a0y-o-y. BNM and the World Bank are cautiously \noptimistic about the economy\u2019s gradual recovery in the \nsecond half of 2020 as economic activities resumed in \nMay. Analysts, however, are still wary that recent spikes in \nCOVID-19 cases will greatly affect Malaysia\u2019s economic \nrecovery, especially as restrictions may be reintroduced.\n\nPrices of basic goods and services in Malaysia decreased \n1.4% y-o-y in September, the same rate of decline \nrecorded in August, after contracting 1.3% y-o-y in July. \nConsumer prices were pulled down by declines in the \ncost of transport; housing, water, electricity, gas, and other \nfuels; and clothing and footwear. BNM expects negative \ninflation for full-year 2020 due to falling global oil and \nother commodity prices.\n\nSize and Composition\n\nMalaysia\u2019s LCY bond market expanded 1.9% quarter-\non-quarter (q-o-q) in Q3 2020 to reach a size of \nMYR1,583.7\u00a0billion (USD381.0 billion), up from \nMYR1,554.8 billion at the end of Q2 2020 (Table 1). \nThe growth corresponds to a 6.1% y-o-y jump from \n\n\fMalaysia\u200381\n\nTable 1: Size and Composition of the Local Currency Bond Market in Malaysia\n\nTotal\n\n\u2003Government\n\n\u2003\u2003Central Government Bonds\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003of which: Sukuk\n\n\u2003\u2003Central Bank Bills\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003of which: Sukuk\n\n\u2003\u2003Sukuk Perumahan Kerajaan\n\n\u2003Corporate\n\n\u2003\u2003of which: Sukuk\n\nOutstanding Amount (billion)\n\nGrowth Rate (%)\n\nQ3 2019\n\nQ2 2020 \n\nQ3 2020\n\nQ3 2019 \n\nQ3 2020\n\nMYR\n\n1,493\n\n786\n\n749\n\n331\n\n10\n\n4\n\n27\n\n707\n\n559\n\nUSD\n\n357\n\n188\n\n179\n\n79\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\n169\n\n133\n\nMYR\n\n1,555\n\n829\n\n797\n\n367\n\n5\n\n0\n\n27\n\n726\n\n582\n\nUSD\n\n363\n\n193\n\n186\n\n86\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n169\n\n136\n\nMYR\n\n1,584\n\n848\n\n820\n\n377\n\n4\n\n0\n\n24\n\n735\n\n592\n\nUSD\n\nq-o-q\n\ny-o-y\n\nq-o-q\n\ny-o-y\n\n381\n\n204\n\n197\n\n91\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n177\n\n142\n\n0.3 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n(0.6)\n\n10.9 \n\n133.3 \n\n(3.9)\n\n(0.2)\n\n0.7 \n\n(34.2)\n\n(20.0)\n\n(60.8)\n\n8.3 \n\n8.3 \n\n9.9 \n\n10.1 \n\n16.7 \n\n(5.6)\n\n8.3 \n\n13.2 \n\n1.9 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.9 \n\n2.7 \n\n6.1 \n\n8.0 \n\n9.6 \n\n13.8 \n\n\u2013\n\n(100.0)\n\n(10.1)\n\n(10.1)\n\n1.3 \n\n1.7 \n\n3.9 \n\n6.0 \n\n( ) = negative, \u2013 = not applicable, MYR = Malaysian ringgit, q-o-q = quarter-on-quarter, Q2 = second quarter, Q3 = third quarter, USD = United States dollar, y-o-y = year-on-year.\nNotes:\n1.

The growth \nin the LCY bond market in Q3 2020 was supported by \nexpansions in both LCY government and corporate bonds, \nwhich accounted for 53.6% and 46.4%, respectively, of \nthe total LCY bonds outstanding at the end of September. \nTotal outstanding sukuk (Islamic bonds) at the end of \nthe review period stood at MYR993.2 billion on growth \nof 1.7% q-o-q from MYR976.2 billion at the end of \nthe previous quarter, spurred by increased stocks of \ngovernment and corporate sukuk.\n\nIssuance of LCY bonds in Q3 2020 declined 4.5% q-o-q \nto MYR90.0 billion from MYR94.2 billion in Q2 2020, \ndriven by decreased government bond issuance.\n\nGovernment bonds. The LCY government bond market \ngrew 2.3% q-o-q to MYR848.4 billion in Q3 2020, up \nfrom MYR829.0 billion in the previous quarter. The \ngrowth was due to the 2.9% q-o-q increase in outstanding \ncentral government bonds, which comprised 96.7% of \ntotal outstanding LCY government bonds. Outstanding \ncentral bank bills, which comprised a 0.5%\u00a0share of \ntotal LCY government bonds outstanding at the end \nof September, contracted 20.0% q-o-q as some bills \nmatured. The outstanding stock of Sukuk Perumahan \nKerajaan (2.8%\u00a0of total outstanding LCY government \nbonds) declined 10.1%\u00a0q-o-q from the previous quarter.\n\nLCY government bonds issued in Q3 2020 fell \n14.0%\u00a0q-o-q to MYR51.6 billion from MYR60.0 billion  \nin the previous quarter, as issuance of Treasury bills \n\ndeclined and no central bank bills were issued during the \nquarter. The lack of issuance of Bank Negara Monetary \nNotes may be attributed to the central bank\u2019s liquidity \nenhancement measures. Another move to expand \nliquidity in the LCY bond market was the increased \nissuance of MGS from the previous quarter, as MGS \nswitch auctions were conducted in September. The \ngovernment redeemed some illiquid bonds and replaced \nthem with more liquid benchmark MGS. The high level of \nMGS issuance may also be attributed to the government\u2019s \nfunding needs for its economic programs to battle the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, issuance \nvolume of Government Investment Issues slightly \ndeclined from the previous quarter.\n\nCorporate bonds. LCY corporate bonds outstanding \nexpanded 1.3% q-o-q to MYR735.3 billion in Q3 2020 \nfrom MYR725.8 billion in Q2 2020.

The \nissuance was via the state-owned funding vehicle\u2019s \nIslamic MTN program. Government-owned utility \ncompany Tenaga Nasional Berhad issued three tranches \nof Islamic MTNs, with its MYR1.5 billion 20-year tranche \nrecording the highest issuance amount during the quarter. \nMalaysia\u00a0Rail Link issued two multitranche bonds.

A total \nof MYR12.0\u00a0billion in net capital inflows were recorded \nin Q3 2020, with most of the inflows coming in July. \nThe September inflows were driven by increased foreign \nholdings of MGS after the JP Morgan Government Bond \nIndex\u2013Emerging Market Index gave more weight to \nMalaysian debt securities. The net inflows in Q2 2020 \nand Q3 2020 were due to improving global investor \nsentiment and a sustained nonresident investor base \nin the Malaysian LCY bond market. However, investors \nremain cautious as FTSE Russell retained Malaysia on its \nfixed-income watch list for possible exclusion from its \nFTSE World Government Bond Index. As a share of LCY \ngovernment bonds, foreign holdings increased to 23.6% at \nthe end of Q3 2020 from 22.7% at the end of Q2 2020.\n\nAt the end of Q2 2020, financial institutions and social \nsecurity institutions led all investors in LCY government \nbond holdings with 35.5% and 30.1% of the total, \nrespectively (Figure 3).

Yields on bonds with 1-month, \n3-month, and 2-year maturities dropped on an average \nof 7 basis points (bps). The remaining tenors all saw \nincreases in their yields. Bond yield for 1-year tenor \nincreased the least at 0.6 bps, while those for 6-month \nand 3-year to 10-year tenors increased an average of \n15\u00a0bps. Larger yield increases were seen in 20-year and \n25-year maturities at 45 bps and 29 bps, respectively. This \nsteepening led to a widening of the yield spread between \n2-year and 10-year tenors during the review period from \n69 bps to 89 bps.\n\nThe decline in government bond yields at the shorter-\nend of the curve was due largely to the accommodative \nmonetary policy stance of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas \n(BSP) and the inflation rate remaining subdued. \n\nThe reverse repurchase rate was held steady at 2.25% for \nthe second consecutive time during the BSP\u2019s monetary \npolicy meeting on 1 October, citing easing inflation and \nencouraging signs of domestic economic recovery. Since \nthe start of the year through October 2020, the central \nbank had slashed 175\u00a0bps from the policy rate, placing it \nto a historically low level. The BSP maintained the view \nthat the pause will allow it to evaluate previous easing \nmeasures\u2019 effect in the economy. The BSP is expected to \nreassess its policy actions based on the third quarter (Q3) \neconomic performance which remained sluggish.

The \nuncertainty and risks surrounding the pandemic have \nmade investors position their funds in the more liquid \nportion of the curve as they await fresh developments. \n\nOn the other hand, yield increases at the longer-end \nof the curve stem from expectations that inflation may \npick up with the further reopening of the economy and \neasing of quarantine restrictions that will spur economic \nactivities. Gloomy economic growth forecasts may have \nalso weighed on investor sentiment, leading some to trim \ntheir demand for long-term investments to avoid looming \nrisks. \n\nConsumer price inflation picked up to 2.5% y-o-y in \nOctober after easing in September (2.3% y-o-y) and \nAugust (2.4% y-o-y). The acceleration mainly came \non the back of higher prices of heavily-weighted food \nand non-alcoholic beverages. Inflation rate averaged \n2.5% for the first 10 months of the year and is within the \ngovernment target of 2.0%\u20134.0% for full-year 2020. With \ndomestic demand remaining weak due to the coronavirus \n\nThe Philippine economy remained in a recession \nafter recording a GDP contraction of 11.5% y-o-y in \nQ3\u00a02020; however, it was an improvement from the \nrevised 16.9%\u00a0y-o-y decline in Q2 2020. The double-\ndigit decline in growth rate can be attributed to the \n2-week reimposition of stricter quarantine measures in \nAugust in some areas, including the country\u2019s economic \ncenter of Metro Manila, after daily cases of COVID-19 \n\n8\u2002BSP forecast as of October 2020.\n\n\f86\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nhad escalated.

At the end of Q3 2020, \ngovernment bonds comprised 79.9% of the LCY bond \nmarket, and corporate bonds accounted for the remaining \n21.1%.\n\nThe Philippine peso sustained its strength against the \nUnited States (US) dollar despite the recession and \nthe extended community quarantine resulting from the \nPhilippines having the highest number of COVID-19 \ncases in emerging East Asia.9 The strength of the peso is \ngenerally traced to low domestic demand that reflects \nlow imports and thus weak demand for US dollars. In \nOctober, the exchange rate movement was range-bound, \nprompted by the passage of the 2021 Philippine national \nbudget, continued reopening of the economy, decline \nin daily COVID-19 cases, easing of some community \nquarantine restrictions, and ongoing negotiations over \na COVID-19 pandemic stimulus package as well as \nelections in the US.

At the end of March, MAS decided \nto reduce the slope of its exchange rate policy and \nlower the midpoint of its policy band. These measures \nweakened the exchange rate and arrested deflation, \nsupporting Singapore\u2019s export-oriented economy \namid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nSingapore\u2019s nonoil domestic exports have been expanding \nmonthly since June, with August exports recording \n7.7%\u00a0year-on-year (y-o-y) growth.\n\nIn October, MAS kept its monetary policy unchanged. \nThe appreciation rate of the Singapore dollar nominal \neffective exchange rate remained at zero, and the \ncenter of the policy band was left unchanged. MAS \nexpects the economy to continue improving in the last \nquarter of 2020, albeit at a weak pace. The sluggish \ngrowth is expected to continue until 2021 amid limited \nimprovements in domestic services and cross-border \ntravel. The central bank also factored in receding deflation \nrisks in its monetary policy decision.

As cases remain low and testing \nand tracing scale up, Singapore may see a transition to \nPhase 3 by the end of 2020.\n\nConsumer price inflation in Singapore was flat in \nSeptember after falling 0.4% y-o-y in both August \nand July. The overall steady prices of basic goods and \nservices was driven by smaller price declines for services, \nelectricity, and gas, and private transport. Core inflation, \nwhich excludes the cost of accommodations and private \ntransport, was \u20130.1% y-o-y, compared with \u20130.3% y-o-y \nrecorded in August. Domestically, inflationary pressures \nare expected to remain subdued. MAS projects inflation \nfor full-year 2020 to fall between \u20130.5% and 0.0%.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the world \neconomy, authorities in Singapore are ensuring continued \nsupport to employees and businesses by extending \n\n\f92\u2003Asia Bond Monitor\n\nthe duration of various relief measures. Expected to \nsave hundreds of thousands of jobs, the government\u2019s \nwage subsidy was extended to May 2021. Subsidies for \nemployee trainings in various sectors were extended \nto June 2021. The government\u2019s program ensuring that \nbusinesses have access to loans has been extended \nto September 2021. The extension of relief measures \nprevented Singapore\u2019s economic growth from dipping \nfurther. \n\nSize and Composition\n\nSingapore\u2019s LCY bond market expanded 1.8% q-o-q in \nQ3\u00a02020 to reach SGD489.5 billion (USD358.5 billion) \nat the end of September, up from SGD480.6 billion at the \nend of June (Table 1). On an annual basis, growth slowed \nto 9.8% y-o-y in Q3 2020 from 11.9% y-o-y a year earlier. \nThe expansion in the LCY bond market was supported by \ngrowth in both government and corporate bonds, which \naccounted for 63.7% and 36.3%, respectively, of total LCY \nbonds outstanding at the end of Q3 2020.\n\nIssuance of LCY bonds in Q3 2020 increased 6.8%\u00a0q-o-q \nto SGD201.7 billion from SGD188.8 billion in Q2 2020, \ndriven by rising government bond issuance. This was \nslightly offset by a drop in the issuance of corporate \nbonds.\n\nGovernment bonds. The LCY government bond market \ngrew 2.0% q-o-q to SGD311.7 billion in Q3 2020 from \nSGD305.7 billion in the previous quarter, spurred by \nthe new MAS floating-rate notes. On an annual basis, \noutstanding Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bills \n\nand bonds, which comprised 61.4% of total outstanding \nLCY government bonds at the end of September, jumped \n17.7% y-o-y. Since July 2019, 6-month SGS bills have \ngradually replaced 24-week MAS bills in order to meet the \ndemand for short-term SGD-denominated securities as \nSGS bills are more accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\nLCY government bond issuance in Q3 2020 rose \n7.5%\u00a0q-o-q. The growth was due to an increase in MAS \nbills spurred by issuances of 6-month floating-rate notes \nmeant to promote the use of the Singapore Overnight \nRate Average as a benchmark in Singapore\u2019s financial \nmarket.\n\nCorporate bonds. LCY corporate bonds outstanding \nincreased 1.6% q-o-q in Q3 2020 to reach \nSGD177.8\u00a0billion at the end of September, up from \nSGD174.9 billion at the end of June, buoyed by the \nincrease in outstanding corporate bonds in the real estate \nand finance industries.\n\nThe top 30 LCY corporate bond issuers in Singapore \naccounted for combined outstanding bonds of \nSGD88.0\u00a0billion, or 49.5% of the total LCY corporate \nbond market, at the end of Q3 2020 (Table 2). The \ngovernment-owned Housing & Development Board \ncontinued to be the largest issuer with outstanding LCY \ncorporate bonds amounting to SGD26.0 billion (14.6% of \ntotal LCY corporate bonds outstanding). By industry type, \nreal estate companies continued to comprise the largest \nshare (43.4%) among the top 30 issuers of LCY corporate \nbonds with SGD38.2 billion of aggregate LCY corporate \nbonds outstanding at the end of Q3 2020.\n\nTable 1: Size and Composition of the Local Currency Bond Market in Singapore\n\n\u2003\u2003SGS Bills and Bonds\n\nTotal\n\n\u2003Government\n\n\u2003\u2003MAS Bills\n\n\u2003Corporate\n\nOutstanding Amount (billion)\n\nGrowth Rate (%)\n\nQ3 2019\n\nQ2 2020\n\nQ3 2020\n\nQ3 2019\n\nQ3 2020\n\nUSD \n\nSGD\n\nUSD \n\nUSD \n\nq-o-q\n\ny-o-y\n\nq-o-q\n\ny-o-y\n\nSGD\n\n446\n\n277\n\n163\n\n114\n\n169\n\n322\n\n200\n\n118\n\n83\n\n122\n\n481\n\n306\n\n195\n\n111\n\n175\n\n345\n\n219\n\n140\n\n80\n\n126\n\nSGD\n\n489\n\n312\n\n191\n\n120\n\n178\n\n358\n\n228\n\n140\n\n88\n\n130\n\n4.9 \n\n5.6 \n\n25.8 \n\n11.9 \n\n15.0 \n\n33.0 \n\n(14.0)\n\n(3.5)\n\n3.8 \n\n7.2 \n\n1.8 \n\n2.0 \n\n(1.7)\n\n8.4 \n\n1.6 \n\n9.8 \n\n12.5 \n\n17.7 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.4 \n\n( ) = negative, MAS = Monetary Authority of Singapore, q-o-q = quarter-on-quarter, Q2 = second quarter, Q3 = third quarter, SGD = Singapore dollar, SGS = Singapore Government \nSecurities, USD = United States dollar, y-o-y = year-on-year.\nNotes:\n1.

On 28\u00a0September, \na Singapore Dollar Term Facility was launched to \nprovide financial institutions flexible options in terms \nof SGD-denominated borrowing at longer tenors. The \nfacility, which compliments the overnight MAS Standing \nFacility, offers SGD-denominated funds with 1-month \nand 3-month tenors. The new facility makes available \nmore options for collateral composed of cash and other \nmarketable securities in various currencies. For domestic \nsystemically important banks, residential property loans \nmay be pledged as collateral with the Singapore Dollar \nTerm Facility. MAS also enhanced the US Dollar Facility, \nestablished in March, which allows banks to borrow \nUS dollars by pledging SGD-denominated collateral. \nSimilar to the Singapore Dollar Term Facility guidelines, \noptions for collateral for the US Dollar Facility were also \nexpanded.\n\n\fThailand\n\nYield Movements\n\nMovements in Thailand\u2019s local currency (LCY) \ngovernment bond yield curve were mixed between \n31\u00a0August and 30 October (Figure 1). Bonds with \nmaturities of 2 years or below gained 3 basis points (bps) \non average, while the 3-year tenor held steady, and the \n4-year tenor jumped 10 bps. Meanwhile, yields fell an \naverage of 6 bps for bonds with maturities of 5 years or \nlonger, with the 20-year tenor showing the steepest drop \nat 16 bps. Yields dropped an average of 3 bps across all \ntenors. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year tenors \nnarrowed from 89 bps to 78 bps during the review period.\n\nThe rise in yields at the shorter-end of the curve reflected \nweakened appetite for Thai sovereign bonds amid the \nrecession brought by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \nand rising political uncertainty. Expectations of a gradual \nrecovery helped boost yields for tenors with maturities of \n5 years or more.\n\nThailand\u2019s gross domestic product dropped 6.4% year-\non-year (y-o-y) in the third quarter (Q3) of 2020 after \ndeclining 12.1% y-o-y in the second quarter. Economic \ncontraction narrowed in the third quarter as easing of \nbusiness lockdowns and expansion of government relief \nefforts boosted consumption and domestic tourism. \nThe\u00a0National Economic and Social Development Council \nrevised its full-year 2020 gross domestic product  \ngrowth forecast to \u20136.0% from the earlier projection  \nof 7.3%\u20137.8% decline, while predicting 2021 growth to  \nbe within a range of 3.5% to 4.5%.\n\nConsumer prices fell 0.7% y-o-y in September, marking \n7 straight months of deflation. Falling energy prices, \nparticularly retail gasoline and electric bills, as well as \ndepressed demand due to COVID-19, drove deflationary \npressures.\n\nThailand\u2019s benchmark interest rate remained at a record \nlow as the Bank of Thailand (BOT) decided to leave it \nunchanged at 0.5% in September. The BOT previously \ncut the policy rate by 25 bps in May.

The ESG bond \ninformation hub was created by the Thai Bond Market \nAssociation from a platform developed by Luxembourg \nGreen Exchange.\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nYield Movements\n\nThe yields of local currency (LCY) government securities \nin Viet Nam fell across the length of the curve between \n31 August and 30 October (Figure 1). Yields on bonds \nwith 1-year and 2-year maturities dropped 14 basis points \n(bps) and 10\u00a0bps, respectively, while yields on bonds \nwith tenors from 3 years to 15 years had larger declines \nranging from 31 bps to 50 bps, with 7-year bonds having \nthe largest drop. The yield spread between the 2-year and \n10-year tenors narrowed from 240 bps to 217 bps during \nthe review period.\n\nAs elsewhere in the region, a low-interest-rate \nenvironment and abundant liquidity in the financial \nsystem, as a result of the State Bank of Vietnam\u2019s (SBV) \naccommodative monetary policy stance, and easing \ninflation drove the downward movement of the yield \ncurve. Good volume participation was observed in bond \nauctions as investors continued to pick government \nbonds as a safe investment. Smaller yield declines for \nbonds with shorter maturities reflected investor interest \nin this portion of the curve, given the uncertainties \nbrought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic.\n\nThe SBV reduced the refinancing interest rate by 50 bps \nto 4.00%, effective 1 October, to sustain the domestic \neconomic recovery. It was the third time in 2020 that the \ncentral bank had lowered the benchmark interest rate, \nresulting in a total rate cut of 200 bps, as part of its effort \nto prop up the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWeak inflationary pressures remained to keep yields \nfloored. Consumer price inflation sustained its downtrend \nin October to 2.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) from 3.0% y-o-y \nin September, despite aggressive monetary easing by \nthe SBV. Transport largely pulled down the inflation rate \nas prices declined 13.5% y-o-y. Meanwhile, the price of \nfood and catering services increased 9.5% y-o-y. Inflation \nfor the first 10 months of the year averaged 3.7% y-o-y, \nand the General Statistics Office of Viet Nam expects \nit to remain within the government\u2019s target of below \n4.0%\u00a0y-o-y for full-year 2020.\n\nViet Nam\u2003101\n\nFigure 1: Viet Nam\u2019s Benchmark Yield Curve\u2014 \nLocal Currency Government Bonds\n\nYield (%)\n3.6\n\n2.7\n\n1.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n30-Oct-20\n\n31-Aug-20\n\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nViet Nam\u2019s economic expansion gained momentum in \nthe third quarter (Q3) of 2020 on growth of 2.6% y-o-y, \nup from revised growth of 0.4% y-o-y in the second \nquarter (Q2); however, it is the slowest pace of Q3 growth \nrecorded since 2011. The growth was largely supported \nby the gradual resumption of business operations as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, including its partial resurgence \nduring the quarter, was successfully contained.\n\nThe Vietnamese dong\u2019s exchange rate was stable from \n1 July through 30 October, with movement in the range \nof VND23,165 to VND23,206 to USD1. The stability of \nthe dong was supported by the weakness of the United \nStates dollar and the economy\u2019s high trade surplus, which \nallowed the SBV to build its foreign exchange reserves and \nmanage the exchange rate.\n\nSize and Composition\n\nViet Nam\u2019s LCY bond market grew 11.6% quarter-on-\nquarter (q-o-q) in Q3 2020, recovering strongly from a \ndecline of 1.4% q-o-q in the preceding quarter (Table\u00a01). \nTotal bonds outstanding registered VND1,514.3 trillion \n(USD65.3 billion) at the end of September, supported by \nthe government and corporate bond market segments, \nwhich both expanded during the quarter.

The size of the government bond \nmarket grew 9.1% q-o-q in Q3 2020 to VND1,268.6\u00a0trillion, \nafter declining 7.8% q-o-q in Q2\u00a02020. The expansion \nwas driven by Treasury bonds, which grew 10.8% q-o-q, \nor double the growth rate in Q2\u00a02020, on the back \nof increased issuance from the State Treasury. There \nwere no outstanding central bank bills at the end of \nQ3\u00a02020 as the SBV continued to support liquidity in \nthe market. Government-guaranteed and municipal \nbonds outstanding posted a decline in Q3\u00a02020, albeit at \na slower pace of 2.7% q-o-q compared with 6.1%\u00a0q-o-q \nin Q2 2020. On an annual basis, total government debt \noutstanding grew 6.9% y-o-y in Q3\u00a02020.\n\nIssuance of government bonds in Q3 2020 totaled \nVND116.9 trillion, more than doubling the amount issued \nin Q2 2020. The State Treasury had a higher bond \noffering volume as it continued to raise funds for the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic response. Auctions \nwere met favorably by investors as safe assets like \ngovernment bonds remained attractive amid lingering \nuncertainty.\n\nCorporate bonds. Corporate bonds outstanding \ncontinued to increase in Q3 2020, reaching \nVND245.7\u00a0trillion, on growth of 26.9% q-o-q and \n129.1%\u00a0y-o-y. While the corporate bond market grew, \nissuance activity in Q3 2020 was rather meek. Debt sales \nby corporates amounted to VND67 trillion, down from \nVND83 billion in Q2 2020. The decline is attributed to \nthe government\u2019s Decree No. 81/2020/ND-CP, which \n\nraises the standards for corporate bond issuance in the \nmarket. The bulk of the issuance was seen in August as \nfirms took advantage of the time before the regulation \ncame into effect on 1 September. In September, debt sales \nfrom the corporate sector dropped sharply by about 70% \nfrom August.\n\nThe combined bonds outstanding of the top 30 issuers \nin the corporate market amounted to VND189.4 trillion, \nor 77.1% of the total debt stock in the corporate segment \n(Table 2). Nearly half of the outstanding bonds, totaling \nVND93.7 trillion, were from the banking sector, followed \nby property firms with VND47.5 trillion, or 25.1% of the \ntotal. The Bank for Investment and Development of \nVietnam, Vinhomes, Masan Group, Vietnam International \nCommercial Joint Stock Bank, and Ho Chi Minh City \nDevelopment Joint Stock Commercial Bank had \nthe largest amounts of bonds outstanding with over \nVND10\u00a0trillion each.\n\nBanking and property firms remained the largest issuers in \nQ3 2020, as their combined debt sales comprised almost \n75% of the total corporate issuances during the quarter. \nNotable issuances listed in Table 3 were largely from \nbanks and comprised of medium-term tenors. HSBC\u2019s \n(Viet Nam) VND600 billion issuance was the first debt \nsale of a foreign commercial bank in the local market. \nProceeds will be used in the bank\u2019s operations and as a \nchannel to diversify its funding sources to accelerate its \nbusiness growth in Viet Nam.\n\n\fTable 2: Top 30 Issuers of Local Currency Corporate Bonds in Viet Nam\n\nOutstanding Amount\n\nIssuers\n\nLCY Bonds\n (VND billion)\n\nLCY Bonds \n(USD billion)\n\nState-Owned\n\nListed \nCompany\n\nType of Industry\n\nViet Nam\u2003103\n\nBank for Investment and Development of Vietnam\n\n20,350\n\nVinhomes \n\n3.
