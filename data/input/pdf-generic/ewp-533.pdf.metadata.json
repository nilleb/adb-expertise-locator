It identifies five use cases, including digital identity, \ntrade finance, project aid monitoring, smart energy, and supply chain management. A discussion of the \nmain  benefits,  risks  and  implementation  challenges  suggests  that  experimentation  with  distributed \nledger technology can produce immediate significant benefits in some areas, while others require further \nresearch  and  investment,  as  well  as  additional  technical,  infrastructural,  or  regulatory  development. \nDevelopment  lenders  can  play  a  role  in  helping  unleash  these  technologies\u2019  positive  developmental \nimpact throughout the Asian region. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: blockchain, developing Asia, distributed ledger technology, financial technology \n \nJEL codes: G21, MI3, O33 \n \n \n \n\n\f\u00a0\n\nI.  \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nCommercial  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  are  adopting  blockchain  and  distributed  ledger \ntechnologies  (DLTs)  at  a  breathtaking  speed  and  huge  sums  are  being  invested  in  research  and \ndevelopment. More recently, national governments, international development banks, and aid agencies \nhave started collaborating with technology firms to find out how to best leverage these technologies. \nBecause DLTs are a new and rapidly evolving phenomenon, it can be difficult to cut through the hype \nand objectively evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of these exciting technologies.   \n \n\nThis  paper  takes  a  first  pass  at  assessing  feasible  areas  of  practical  implementation  for  DLTs \nmainly in the context of development finance. In particular, we attempt to provide preliminary answers \nto the following questions: \n \n\n(i)  Where in a developing country context have DLTs been successfully applied and what are \n\nfurther areas for practical implementation in developing Asia? \n\n(ii)  What are the limitations of DLT implementation and what are the steps required to further \n\ntheir development for broader applicability? \n\n \n\nTo get at these questions, we identify five particular use cases and assess their implementation \nlimits and potential. The DLT use cases described in section III have been selected for their potential to \nimpact key areas of development finance and accelerate progress toward key objectives in commonly \npursued  projects,  such  as  trade  finance  or  the  provision  of  legal  identity  to  the  poor.  Without  the \nambition of comprehensiveness, the goal is to assess whether integrating DLT solutions might in some \ncases help achieve the goals of existing projects and processes in these areas.  \n \n\nBefore turning to specific applications, the next section provides a gentle introduction to the \nconcept of blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies. For a deeper and more precise insight, \nthe  reader  should  consult  the  sources  indicated  in  footnotes  as  well  as  in  the  additional  technical \nreferences section.   \n \n \n\nII.  \n\nTYPES OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR STRENGTHS  \n\nAND WEAKNESSES \n\n \nBlockchains and DLTs are shared (\u2018distributed\u2019 or \u2018decentralized\u2019) digital ledgers that use cryptographic \nalgorithms to verify the creation and transfer of digitally represented assets or information over a peer-\nto-peer  network.1    They  operate  via  an  innovative  combination  of  distributed  consensus  protocols, \ncryptography and inbuilt economic incentives based on game theory. The digital asset \u2018native\u2019 to the first \nblockchain ever developed is the cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin\u2014a nonstate form of digital money \nthat  went  into  circulation  in  2009  and  has  since  enjoyed  considerable  success.2  Beyond  nonstate \ncryptocurrencies, however, DLTs can also be used to represent, track, and trade many other types of \nassets and information, including: \n \n\nfiat (government-issued) money (Wild 2016); \n\n(i) \n(ii)  stocks, bonds, derivatives and other financial products (DTCC 2016); \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1   This cursory introduction is intended for nontechnical readers and is adapted from Maupin (2017). \n2   For  a  technical  explanation,  see  Nakamoto  (2008).  For  nontechnical  readers,  Wikipedia\u2019s  page  on  Bitcoin  provides  an \n\naccessible introduction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).  \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\n(iii)  real and intellectual property rights (Shin 2016); \n(iv)  contract rights (Morrison 2016); \n(v) \n\nthe movement of goods and services across a global supply chain (Higgins 2016, Parker \n2016a, 2016b); \n\n(vi)  the expenditure of public or private funds (Samburaj 2016, Parker 2016c); \n(vii)  personal and sensor-based data and messages; 3 and \n(viii) the delivery of digital entitlements and digital identity to end-beneficiaries.4 \n \nDLTs  can  be  set  up  in  either  public  or  private  configurations,  and  they  can  be  configured  to \naccommodate greater or lesser degrees of user privacy. These and other design choices must be tailored \nto the specific goals pursued in each DLT use case. Broadly speaking, DLTs can be specified to exhibit \ncertain innovative properties which make them a highly useful tool in structuring the global economy, \nfor instance: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndistributed  consensus\u2014no  central  point  of  control  or  failure  (no  choke  points  or \nintermediaries), \ntransaction  transparency/auditability\u2014every  ledger  entry  can  be  made  verifiable  and \nretraceable across its full history (accountability), and \n\n(iii)  party  identity  abstraction\u2014individual  parties  can  transact  with  one  another  across  the \n\nnetwork without revealing their full identities (enhanced privacy). 5 \n\n \n\nIt is thanks to these and other properties that DLTs are often called the Internet of Value. They \nallow individuals and organizations to exchange value (e.g., money, or assets, or monetized data streams) \nacross  borders  in  the  same  way  the  internet  allows  us  to  exchange  simple  information  on  a  global, \ndecentralized, peer-to-peer basis. And much like exchanging information on the internet, exchanging \nvalue on a distributed ledger can be fast and cheap\u2014in some cases considerably faster and cheaper than \nthe  existing  \u2018legacy\u2019  systems  of  our  global  financial  order.  This  makes  DLTs  an  attractive  vehicle  for \naccomplishing numerous economic and noneconomic objectives, as discussed in section III. \n\n \nThe structural properties of DLTs very much affect the technical feasibility of the applications \nthat  can  be  built  on  top  of  them.    Understanding  these  structural  features  is  therefore  a  necessary \nprerequisite to being able to evaluate potential DLT use cases in a meaningful way.  DLTs come in four \nbasic types: \n \n\n(i) \n\nPublic,  permissionless  blockchains.    These  are  blockchains  in  which  anyone  can \nparticipate in principle. With a little bit of technical know-how and an internet enabled \ndevice,  anyone  can  connect  to  the  protocol  and  either  transact  over  the  blockchain \n(\u2018users\u2019)  or  view  the  transactions  taking  place  on  the  blockchain  (\u2018viewers\u2019).    Likewise, \nanyone  with  sufficient  time  and  resources  can  devote  computing  power  toward \nperforming  the  mathematical  computations  that  secure  the  network  by  grouping \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3   Some  projects  are  collecting  field  data  from  Internet-of-Things  (IoT)  device  sensors  and  using  distributed  ledgers  to \ntransmit  the  data  and  make  them  available  for  analysis  via  distributed  data  marketplaces.    See,  for  example,  IOTA \nDevelopment  Roadmap  and  Github  Repository  (https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01)  and \nMasked Authenticated Messaging (https://github.com/iotaledger/MAM.ixi). \n\n4   For example, AID:Tech (https://aid.technology/) pioneered the delivery of international aid to Syrian refugees in Lebanon \n\nusing blockchain technology. \n\n5   These and other characteristics are explained in DTCC Connection (2016). \n\n\f \n\nDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   3 \n\ntransactions  into  a  chain  of  tamper-proof  blocks  at  regular  intervals  (\u2018miners\u2019).6  As  a \nreward for performing these computations, the most efficient miners regularly receive new \nunits of the blockchain\u2019s native token (e.g., Bitcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain, or Ether on \nthe Ethereum blockchain) (Nakamoto 2008, Buterin 2015).  The protocol code is open \nsource, and decisions on changes to the code are adopted by majority consensus.  In short, \nthere  are  no  formal  barriers  to  the  entry,  use,  or  viewing  of  a  public,  permissionless \nblockchain. \n\nStrengths.  Ease of use and right of access are major advantages of public, permissionless \nblockchains.  These chains also tend to be relatively secure, thanks to the large amounts \nof energy and computing power devoted by financially motivated miners to maintaining \nthe  security  of  the  network.    As  open-source  protocols,  they  are  subject  to  continual \nvetting, which means bugs in the code are often spotted and fixed quickly. Transparency \nis another major feature of most public blockchains. That is, all transactions that have ever \noccurred  on  the  network  can  be  viewed  by  anyone  at  any  time\u2014from  the  very  first \ntransaction to the most recent one.  Such transparent, real-time public recordkeeping can \nbe very useful in cases where the goal is to hold a blockchain\u2019s participants accountable \nfor their transactions.  This will become apparent in some of the use cases described in \nsection III. \n \nWeaknesses.  The flip side of the coin is that there are some instances in which personal \nprivacy  concerns  may  trump  public  accountability  concerns  (ShenTu  and  Yu  2015).  In \nsuch cases, the transparency of most public blockchains is a bug and not a feature.  This \nconcern has been mitigated, to a large degree, by the emergence of next generation public \nblockchains  using  advanced  cryptographic  techniques  such  as  zero-knowledge  proofs7 \nand ring signatures8 to enhance user privacy. \n \nWhat cannot be sufficiently mitigated at present are the scalability limitations of public \nblockchains.    The  mathematical  processes  through  which  transactions  are  batched, \nconfirmed,  and  strung  together  in  tamper-proof  chains  are  extremely  energy  intensive, \ncostly, and slow.  As of the time of writing, the Bitcoin network\u2019s electricity consumption \namounts  to  0.09%  of  total  world  energy  consumption.    This  means  a  single  Bitcoin \ntransaction consumes enough electricity to power 7.55 households in the United States \nfor an entire day (Digiconomist 2017).  Average processing costs are around $44.88 per \ntransaction,  a  figure  corresponding  to  a  4.56%  processing  fee  for  Bitcoin  miners \n(Blockchain.Info  2017a). \n  The  number  of  outstanding  unconfirmed  transactions, \nmeanwhile, ranges between 4,000 and 9,300, and the average transaction confirmation \ntime  is  45  minutes  (Blockchain.Info  2017b,  2017c).  It  is  important  to  note  that  the \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6   The term \u2018mining\u2019 refers to the computational process by which transactions on the blockchain network are batched and \nconfirmed into data \u2018blocks\u2019 (released with an interval of around every 10 minutes on Bitcoin) and then \u2018chained\u2019 together \nin a publicly verifiable way, which makes it highly difficult (economically cost prohibitive) for anyone to go back and tamper \nwith earlier entries in the chain.  For technical details, see Nakamoto (2008). Most public, permissionless chains use either \n\u2018proof-of-work\u2019  or  \u2018proof-of  stake\u2019  consensus  algorithms.    For  details  on  the  differences  between  the  two,  consult  the \ntechnical references section. \n\n7   Zcash  is  the  leading  cryptocurrency  using  cutting-edge  cryptography  to  make  peer-to-peer  money  transactions  secure \nfound  on  the  Zcash  website  (ZCash. \n\nwithout  being  publicly  viewable.  Technical  specifications  may  be \nhttps://z.cash/about.html?page=0). See also Miers et al. (2013) and Ben-Sasson et al. (2014). \n\n8   Monero  is  the  leading  cryptocurrency  employing  ring  signatures  to  offer  a  higher  degree  of  anonymity  to  its  users.    As \ncompared  with zero  knowledge  proofs,  ring  signatures  are a  slightly  less  anonymous  but much  more  thoroughly  battle-\ntested method of privacy enhancement.  For details, see Monero. https://getmonero.org/. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncorresponding figures for Ethereum and certain other public blockchains are somewhat \nbetter. Moreover, many innovative ideas for scaling public blockchains are currently under \nactive development around the world and several of these will likely succeed.9 Even so, \nthese  statistics  underscore  that  public,  permissionless  blockchains  face  very  serious \nscaling limitations at present.  Difficult technical problems remain to be solved before they \nwill become capable of meeting large-scale usage demand. \n\n(ii)  Private,  permissioned  blockchains.  These are blockchains on which only parties who \nhave been granted access (\u2018permission\u2019) may participate in transacting, mining, or viewing \ntransactions.    Their  code  may  be  either  open  or  closed  source,  but  in  most  cases  it  is \nmaintained  by  developer  teams  seconded  or  contracted  by  the  parties  who  have \npermission to participate in the chain.  Private blockchains are a popular solution among \nconsortiums of actors with shared interests.  An example of this is Ripple, an effort to make \ninterbank settlement processes faster and cheaper by connecting multinational banks via \na single shared ledger.10 \n\nStrengths.    Because  access  to  private  chains  is  controlled,  the  number  of  nodes \nparticipating in the network can be kept to a smaller number.  Privacy concerns can be \ndealt  with  by  concluding  confidentiality  agreements  among  the  approved  participants, \nand/or  by  employing  the  newer  cryptographic  techniques  just  described  in  respect  of \npublic chains.  Moreover, all participants can be required to perform \u2018mining\u2019 operations \nas a condition of participation, rather than in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards.  This \nallows private chains to consume less energy, process more transactions per second, and \ndo so at much lower cost than public chains. \n \nWeaknesses.   Private blockchains are  not as broadly distributed as public chains, which \nimplies increased cybersecurity risks.11  More significantly, because their security depends \nupon all approved participants in the chain acting in good faith, it is necessary to restrict \naccess  to  only  trusted  participants,  and  then  to  regularly  audit  and  verify  that  these \nparticipants are indeed acting in accordance with the terms agreed.  From a technical and \ncosts  standpoint,  it  is  not  always  clear  that  it  makes  economic  sense  to  use  private \nblockchains among known, trusted parties, where more traditional networked-database \nsolutions such as Oracle, MySQL, and NoSQL might well suffice.12 \n\n(iii)  Hybrid  blockchains.    As  the  name  suggests,  hybrid  blockchains  combine  some  of  the \nfeatures of both public, permissionless and private, permissioned blockchains.  A hybrid \nchain might, for example, be configured to be \u2018permissioned\u2019 with respect to the chain\u2019s \nusers and miners but \u2018public\u2019 with respect to its viewers.  Alternatively, a hybrid chain might \nuse a combination of open-source and closed-source code.

The  main  advantage  offered  by  hybrid  chains  is  the  flexibility  to  pick  and \nchoose design features according to the use case.  Different types of users can be given \ndifferent levels of access and use rights; different privacy and transparency features can \nbe tailored to specific classes of users, actions, or categories of information; different types \nof security features and identity practices may be adopted for different purposes; and so \non. Thanks to this flexibility, hybrid blockchains and the consortiums promoting them are \ncurrently  receiving  substantial  research  and  development  support \nlarge \nmultinational corporations and global financial institutions.15 \n \nWeaknesses.  Hybrid chains require a great deal of custom design work, which can make \nthem time-consuming and costly to build.  Their  specificity and complexity also create \nsignificant barriers to interoperability.  If not addressed from the beginning as part of their \ninitial design scheme, these interoperability barriers may lead to lock-in effects.  This, in \nturn,  can  stifle  innovation  by  inhibiting  healthy  competition  among  distributed  ledger \nplatforms, leading to rising prices for users over time. \n\nfrom \n\n(iv)  DAG-based  distributed  ledgers  (\u2018tangle\u2019).    The  IOTA  tangle  is  a  newer  type  of \ndistributed  ledger  technology  which  uses  Directed  Acyclic  Graphs  (DAGs)  to  transmit \nand confirm transactions in an asynchronous rather than \u2018chained\u2019 way.16  It was conceived \nas a lightweight protocol for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment to facilitate micro-\nscale  machine-to-machine  transactions  among  billions  of  connected  devices.17    In \ncontrast to blockchains, the tangle has no dedicated \u2018miners.\u2019  Instead, each IoT connected \ndevice that transmits a new transaction to the network must perform the computational \ncalculations necessary to confirm two other transactions as a precondition for having its \nown transaction confirmed (Schiener 2017). \n\nStrengths.    There  are  several  advantages  to  using  a  DAG-based  tangle  rather  than  a \nblockchain.  The first is zero transaction fees.  Because there is no need to compensate \nminers for securing the network, it is possible to \u201ctransact even sub-cent values Peer-to-\nPeer without any transaction fees for either the sender or the recipient\u201d (Schiener 2017).  \nSecond, the  tangle scales organically.  By design, it becomes faster and more secure as \nnetwork traffic grows.  Third, the tangle\u2019s distributed consensus protocol allows it to be \n\u2018partition tolerant.\u2019  This means portions of the network\u2019s traffic can split off from the main \ntangle for extended periods of time and continue to operate without internet connectivity \n(e.g., over Bluetooth, or theoretically even TV or radio bandwidth); these partitions can \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n13   Several of the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger projects, for example, and various ongoing Enterprise Ethereum experiments. \n\nSee Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. https://entethalliance.org/about/.  \n\n14   This alliance focuses on developing \u2018enterprise-grade software capable of handling the most complex, highly demanding \n\napplications at the speed of business.\u2019  See Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. https://entethalliance.org/about. \n\n15   The Monetary Authority of Singapore has taken a lead role in promoting experimentation with hybrid chains.

Public blockchains rely on the economic incentives generated by the mining \nprocess to protect the network from malicious attacks.19  Because a DAG-based tangle \ndoes not have miners, it must ensure that no bad actor can attempt to cheat the network \nby  strategically  selecting  the  transactions  it  gets  to  confirm.    The  IOTA  tangle  guards \nagainst  this  possibility  by  directing  which  participating  device  confirms  which  new \ntransactions via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Random Walk algorithm. As discussed in the \nproject\u2019s White Paper, this method should theoretically prove sufficient once the tangle \nreaches a large enough scale (Popov 2017).  However, the formal bounds at which this \npoint will be achieved have not yet been mathematically proven.20  In the meantime, the \ntangle must rely on a network of trusted nodes to verify that transaction confirmations are \nbeing done in a random, and not strategic, manner.21  The tangle as presently implemented \nis therefore not yet fully decentralized.22 \n\n \n\nTo summarize then, distributed ledger technologies today come in a stunning array of shapes \nand sizes.  Each has unique advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to understand these in \norder  to  evaluate  the  prospect  of  DLTs  to  be  beneficially  deployed  in  the  development  assistance \ncontext. \n \n \n\nIII.  \n\nDISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY USE CASES \n\n \nThere  has  been  a  mushrooming  of  use  cases  to  implement  DLT.  Some,  such  as  remittances  and \nmicrofinance, have received broader attention than others, and are omitted in this paper due to space \nconstraints. Here we take a closer look at five other areas of application with a clear bearing on core \ndevelopment issues, including digital identity, trade finance, project aid monitoring, smart energy, and \nsupply chain management. Each use case has the potential to deliver tangible improvements in terms of \ndevelopment outcomes and carries implications for the ways in which official development finance may \nbe deployed in support of their adaptation. Use cases also face a great deal of challenges and limitations, \nwhich in many cases will require further technical, infrastructural, or regulatory developments before \nthey can be put to work in support of development across Asia and elsewhere. \n \n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n18   The first proof of concept of this kind of partition tolerance was recently demonstrated.  See Freiburg (2017). \n19   In  essence,  the  resource  costs  involved  in  mining  new  tokens  (such  as  bitcoins)  are  high  enough  that  it  becomes \neconomically infeasible for any single bad actor to acquire sufficient hashing power to cheat the rest of the network.  For a \nbrief  explanation  of  the  Bitcoin  blockchain\u2019s  so-called  \u201851%  Attack\u2019  problem,  see  Bitcoin  Wiki.  \u201cMajority  Attack.\u201d \nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Majority_attack.  It is important to note that the 51% attack problem is more than a theoretical \npossibility.  It has been actively discussed by some parties in the past.  See Von Wirdum (2017). \n\n20   See Popov (2017) for an updated version of his white paper, which also provides some further details. \n21   This set of nodes is called \u2018the Coordinator\u2019 in the IOTA ecosystem.  For a defense of this approach, see S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 (2017). \n\nFor a critique of it, see Wall (2017).  \n\n22   In  this  sense,  it  currently  evinces  analogous  security  weaknesses  in  respect  of  central  attack  points  as  do  private \npermissioned blockchains.  A key difference is that in the tangle this de facto centralization is intended as a transitional \nfeature only, whereas in private permissioned blockchains it is a permanent design feature. \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   7 \n\nUse Case 1:  Digital Identity\u2013A Gateway to All Other Use Cases \n\nA. \n \nEvery aspect of human development rests upon the bedrock of trusted identity.  Without a verifiable \nidentity of some kind, it is impossible to open a bank account, start a business, conclude a legally binding \ncontract, access essential government services, obtain educational credentials, or conduct just about \nany other imaginable type of economic or social activity on a broader scale.23  State authorities attempt \nto fill this gap by issuing official identities to natural and legal persons falling within their jurisdiction.  \nThey  do  so  by  issuing  written  documents  such  as  birth  certificates  and  citizen  identification  (ID) \nnumbers,  which  can  in  turn  be  used  to  obtain  both  locally  recognized  identity-related  documents \n(identity  cards,  driver\u2019s  licenses,  marriage  certificates,  tax  ID  numbers,  business  licenses,  etc.)  and \nglobally recognized ones (e.g., passports).  This process works better in some states than others.  Today, \naround  1.1  billion  people  worldwide\u2014particularly  in  rural  Africa  and  Asia\u2014still  lack  legal  identities \n(World Bank 2017).  It was for this reason that the United Nations (UN) in 2015 made the provision of \nlegal  identities  for  all,  including  birth  registrations,  an  explicit  focus  of  its  revised  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (UN SDGS 2017).24 \n \n\nBut even once legal identities have been issued, the question  of how to keep official records \ncontinuously up-to-date remains problematic. A never-ending string of ordinary events can necessitate \nthe alteration, suspension, or revocation of legal identities and the various entitlements associated with \nthem.    Births,  deaths,  marriages,  name  changes,  declarations  of  court-determined  legal  incapacity, \nbankruptcy  or  insolvency,  and  many  other  events  can  alter  the  legal  rights  and  duties  attached  to  a \nparticular identity.  Even economically advanced \u2018good governance\u2019 states have long struggled to find \nways of making their many disparate recordkeeping systems talk to one another such that all records are \nkept current.   \n \nThis  lack  of  interregistry  communication  impedes  global  development  efforts  by  making  it \nextremely  expensive  and  time  consuming  for  transacting  parties  to  verify  one  another\u2019s  legally \nrecognized identities and entitlements.  This is as true of local transactions as it is of global ones.  For \ninstance,  a  simple  contract  for  the  sale  of  a  parcel  of  land  by  one  neighbor  to  another  requires  the \nverification of both parties\u2019 identities and their legal capacity to contract, as well as a verification of the \nseller\u2019s current ownership entitlement to the land. To take a cross-border example, a large international \nfinancial transfer requires the verification of the sending and receiving parties\u2019 identities, a confirmation \nof the mutual recognition of those identities by the different countries in question, and a confirmation \nthat neither of them is prohibited under any national or international regulation from transferring money \ninternationally  (e.g.,  by  reason  of  being  on  a  terrorism  or  money  laundering  watch  list).  Similarly,  in \nrelation to DLT-based trade finance further described below, the global diffusion of a company identifier \nsystem  will  facilitate  the  risk  assessment  and  ownership  tracking  necessary  for  smaller  companies  in \ndeveloping countries to be granted access to finance and the global economy. \n \n\n1. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n\nDistributed ledger technologies offer a technical solution to this complex problem for the first \ntime  in  history,  and  on  a  global  scale.

People transacted with those whom \nthey knew and trusted.  While such models worked well on a local level, they proved incapable of establishing trust among \nparties wishing to transact beyond their immediate communities. \n\n24   In particular, UN Sustainable Development Goal target 16.9 states: \u201cBy 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth \n\nregistration.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\nuPort \n\n(https://netki.com/), \n\nCivic \n(https://sovrin.org/),  Netki \n(https://www.civic.com/)  and  others,  are  building  DLT  solutions  for  real-time  self-sovereign  digital \nidentity  management.  The  concept  of  self-sovereign  identity  could  herald  radical  changes  in  global \neconomic organization by turning the data collection practices and revenue models of many existing \ninternet-era  businesses  on  their  heads.25    More  importantly,  within  the  international  development \ncontext, it promises to enable billions of currently excluded persons to integrate into the global finance \nand commerce systems.  As described in the 2016 Caribou Digital/Omidyar paper: \n \n\n(https://www.uport.me/), \n\nOpen,  decentralized  systems  enable  individuals  to  fully  own  and  manage  their  own \nidentities,  leading  to  the  idea  of  \u201cself-sovereign\u201d  identity  systems.  These  systems  use \ncombinations  of  distributed  ledger  and  encryption  technology  to  create  immutable \nidentity  records.  The  individual  creates  an  identity  \u201ccontainer\u201d  that  allows  them  to \naccept attributes or credentials from any number of organizations, including the state, \nin a networked ecosystem that is open to any organization to participate (e.g., to issue \ncredentials). Each organization can decide whether to trust credentials in the container \nbased on which organization verified or attested to them; in other words, a mortgage \ncompany may accept a credential issued by a leading global bank, but not one issued by \na  local  bank.  Importantly,  this  model  does  not  require  a  state-based  credential  to  be \ninitiated (the state credential can be added at a later time, or not at all), which removes \na barrier to adoption. \n\n \n\nThe flexibility and modularity of the self-sovereign identity approach makes it ideal for adoption \nin developing country contexts where there are significant gaps in official state recordkeeping.  In fact, \nthose gaps might make it easier for developing countries to adopt such solutions than more developed \nones, where large sunk investments in traditional recordkeeping systems often create institutional path-\ndependencies and high transition costs.   \n \n\nAn example of a development-focused start-up using self-sovereign identity as an anchor for its \nwork is Taqanu (https://www.taqanu.com/), which describes itself as \u201ca bank for refugees and for people \nwithout fixed address.\u201d  Taqanu takes advantage of the fact that, while many refugees don\u2019t have identity \ndocuments, many do have phones.  It allows refugees to sign up to have their social media data compiled \nand analyzed in a way that makes it possible for regulated banks to verify the refugees\u2019 identities to a \nsufficient  degree  of  probability  to  offer  them  basic  banking  services\u2014even  if  they  can\u2019t  provide  a \ngovernment-issued birth certificate, passport, or other recognized national identity document.   \n\n \nProviding  financial  system  access  to  excluded  populations  is  one  of  the  most  important \ndevelopmental use cases of DLTs, and further examples are presented in the following sections.  For \npresent  purposes,  the  Taqanu  example  illustrates  that  the  creation  of  verifiable  digital  identities  is  a \ngateway issue for pretty much every possible DLT use case.  Without them, users of DLT solutions could \nnever trust that their counterparties to a transaction: (i) are who they claim to be, and (ii) are entitled to \ncarry out the intended transaction.  Digital identity is therefore the key to the success of all other DLT \nuse cases.  This renders investment in self-sovereign identity infrastructure a necessary prerequisite for \nevery other type of development assistance for which DLT solutions might be explored. \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n25   Companies  like  Google,  Amazon,  Facebook,  and  Apple\u2014whose  revenue  models  depend  upon  monetizing  the  large \nvolumes of data collected from their users\u2014will need to find new ways of generating revenue if users become empowered \nto decide on a granular level which data they share, with whom, and for what specific purposes. \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   9 \n\n2. \n\nRisks and Implementation Challenges \n\n \nIn  order  for  its  benefits  to  be  realized,  advocates  of  self-sovereign  identity  posit  that  three  core \nrequirements must be met: \n \n\nSecurity\u2014the identity information must be kept secure, \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Controllability\u2014the user must be in control of who can see and access their data, and \n(iii)  Portability\u2014the user must be able to use their identity data wherever they want and not \n\nbe tied to a single provider (Tobin and Reed 2017). \n\n \n\nMany of the leading actors in this space are cooperating under the auspices of the Decentralized \nIdentity  Foundation  to  make  this  vision  a  reality.26    While  the  broader  vision  is  shared,  however,  key \nimplementation details have yet to be agreed upon. For example, the security pillar requires the use of \ncryptographically secure methods of protecting users\u2019 data. Most digital identity service providers today \nuse  cryptographic  functions  based  on  elliptic  curves  whose  security  robustness  has  been  thoroughly \nvetted within the context of contemporary processing environments.  But cryptographers warn these \nfunctions will most likely prove vulnerable to hacking with the advent of quantum computing, which may \nno longer be very far away (The Japan Times 2017).   \n\n \nTo guard against this risk, all information stored in a user\u2019s digital identity wallet should ideally \nbe stored in a quantum-proof way. This is theoretically feasible using known cryptographic techniques.27  \nHowever, building these into a self-sovereign identity wallet in a user-friendly manner\u2014such that the \nuser  does  not  need  any  technical  knowledge  to  keep  his/her  data  secure\u2014poses  nontrivial  design \nchallenges.  Addressing  these  will  require  systematic  adherence  to  user-centered  design  principles \ntogether  with  comprehensive  beta  testing  of  design  features  in  developing  country  environments  in \nadvance of any live deployment of the technology.  \n\n \nThe portability pillar also constitutes a risk at present due to the fact that many of the leading \nfirms in the self-sovereign identity race are building their solutions for a specific DLT, e.g. the Bitcoin or \nEthereum  blockchains.    But  data  portability  requires  platform  neutrality  if  it  is  to  mean  anything  in \npractice.  Digital identity solutions that are open source and platform agnostic (capable of being used \nacross multiple distributed ledgers) may be more likely to deliver high performance at lower cost to users \nin  the  long  run.    There  is  a  risk  that  hype  factors  associated  with  the  current  popularity  of  particular \nblockchains  may lead development funders to commission digital identity \u2018proof of concepts\u2019 tied to \nthose specific blockchains, even if the structural design features of the blockchain in question are not \nwell suited to the long-term success of the project at hand.  To mitigate this risk, development funders \nshould adopt a policy of publishing public tenders for all DLT-based proof of concepts\u2014including those \nwhose  financial  implications  would  ordinarily  place  them  below  the  usual  budget  threshold  for  a \nmandatory public tender call.  This can help prevent situations that may lead to lock-in effects. \n \n\nIn addition to these technical risks, mounting evidence makes clear that digital identity efforts \ncan only assist with the achievement of concrete development objectives if properly situated within a \nbroader reform agenda.

Solutions that are open source and platform agnostic (capable of being used across multiple \ndistributed ledgers, as opposed to tied specifically to one particular blockchain) are probably more likely to deliver high \nperformance at low cost to the users in the long run. \n\n27  For  a \n\nlay  description,  see  Wikipedia.  \u201cPost-quantum  Cryptography.\u201d  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum \n\n_cryptography. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f10   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\naccess to birth certificates, for example, would lead to human rights protection and a fairer distribution \nof resources and opportunities.  A 2007 Asian Development Bank (ADB) study tested this assumption \ndirectly  by  investigating  whether  improved  access  to  some  form  of  legal  identity  improved  the \nlivelihoods of the poor by helping them obtain services, benefits, and other rights (Vandenabeele and \nLao 2007). Based on field work in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, it found that the actual benefits \nfrom  owning  a  legal  identity  are  limited  by  the  obstacles  encountered  in  individual  country \ncircumstances, and more generally by weak institutions and widespread corruption.  In other words, the \nprovision  of  legal  identity  must  be  linked  to  the  delivery  of  essential  services  relevant  to  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods in order to have a real world impact. \n \n\nSelecting which essential services should be linked to a potential self-sovereign digital identity \ninitiative is also an important policy decision. For example, primary education funding in Nepal premised \non the introduction of registration laws and legal identity requirements was found to exclude women \nand minorities most in need of assistance, because these groups faced the highest barriers to obtaining \nbirth  certificates  in  the  first  place.    Program  design  should  therefore  take  into  account  the  risk  that \nintroducing  a  legal  identity  regime  may  limit  the  range  of  project  beneficiaries.    For  some  essential \nservices,  superior  development  outcomes  may  be  reached  by  providing  them  to  everyone,  with  or \nwithout identity.28 \n \nLast  but  not  least,  poor  governance,  weak  institutions,  corruption,  and  resource  constraints \nfundamentally  weaken  the  state\u2019s  capacity  to  enforce  laws  intended  to  protect  citizens\u2019  rights.    The \nprovision of legal identity makes little difference in such contexts without complementary reforms in \nthese  areas.  Although  self-sovereign  identity  systems  can  fill  the  void  left  by  a  weak  state  in  a \ncircumscribed  area  of  application,  its  benefits  cannot  expand  without  an  appropriate  enabling \nenvironment. Put differently, legal identity and the technologies underlying it are important facilitating \ntools, but they cannot substitute for development policy as such.   \n\n \nUse Case 2:  Trade Finance for Improved Accessibility of Small and Medium Enterprises29 \n\nB. \n \nA recent ADB survey found that the trade finance gap reached $1.5 trillion in 2016 (ADB 2016). Access \nto trade finance is particularly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because they \noften lack collateral, a documented history of past commercial and financial transactions, and sufficient \nknowledge of the financial industry and instruments on offer. The survey finds that, as a result, 57% of \ntrade finance requests by SMEs are rejected, compared to only 10% by multinational companies. SMEs \nin  Asian  economies  account  for  98%  or  more  of  all  enterprises,  and  the  limitations  they  encounter \nimpacts economic growth and employment at the aggregate level (ADBI 2016).  \n \n\nGovernments  in  Asia  have  been  devising  a  variety  of  policies  and  programs  to  improve  SME\u2019s \naccess to trade finance. For example, the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand \nand the Small Industries Development Bank of India were established to cater especially to SMEs. In the \nPhilippines, the central bank set up a credit fund to guarantee bank lending to SMEs and cooperatives. \nJapan and several other countries in the region have created public credit registries to allow banks to make \ninformed decisions on SME loan requests. Legal frameworks have been enacted to help SMEs provide the \ncollateral demanded by banks, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) introduction in 2007 of a \nnew property law and Thailand\u2019s Business Collateral Act in 2015 (ADBI 2016). \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n28   Prenatal healthcare and childhood vaccination programs may be examples. \n29   This section reflects insight from a discussion with Steven Beck, Head of ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   11 \n\nWhile national and regional initiatives\u2014including ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program\u2014help bridge \nthe gap, there is increasing expectation on technology to make a difference. Leading companies in the \nglobal  e-commerce  sector,  such  as  Amazon  and  PayPal,  have  established  their  own  lending  arms \ncatering mostly to SMEs, and platforms such as Alibaba and eBay provide training and advice especially \ntargeted at smaller companies. Compared to regular bank loans, the minimum size of loans by these e-\ncompanies  is  smaller,  procedures  are  more  streamlined,  and  access  and  disbursement  times  are \nconsiderably  shorter.  As  a  result,  lending  to  small  businesses  has  seen  rapid  growth  in  the  advanced \nmarkets, except for the PRC, but it has yet to penetrate developing markets, where the demand for SME \nfinancing is highest (The Banker 2017).  \n\n \nIn developing countries, DLT is expected to be a real game changer, especially for SMEs. From \nthe cumbersome and slow process it is now\u2014involving layers of paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles\u2014\nDLT  will  involve  broadly  accessible  and  scalable  smart  contracts  that  will  execute  automatic  money \ntransfers as merchandise ships across international borders and predefined commercial and financial \ntrigger  events  take  place.  Such  automaticity  through  DLT  is  estimated  to  cut  costs  drastically, \nbroadening financial access to SMEs that are currently excluded.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA small pilot project on a DLT platform involved dairy exports worth nearly $100,000 and is reported \nhaving  succeeded  by  reducing  processing  times  to  a  few  hours  only,  from  what  along  traditional \nfinancing channels would have taken a week or longer (Jemima 2016).  Deloitte built a similar proof of \nconcept for  an Indian bank using a private permissioned ledger based on the Ethereum protocol.  As \ndescribed in the press release, \u201cthe platform helped the bank reduce the time taken for issuing a [letter \nof credit] significantly from 20 to 30 days (as has been the industry norm) to a few hours and provided \nan  unprecedented  visibility  to  all  involved  stakeholders\u201d  (Deloitte  2017).    A  consortium  of  eight \nEuropean banks is building a similar solution to provide trade finance to SMEs within Europe (Finextra \n2017), and several more multinational banks have recently joined the IBM/UBS effort (Arnold 2017).  \n \n\nMeanwhile, an interesting new start-up called Sweetbridge is aiming to lower the cost of trade \nfinance by allowing firms\u2014especially SMEs\u2014to engage in a sort of finance smoothing across their own \npayment cycles.  As described by Banker (2017), \u201cit is common for a big firm to buy goods from small \nmanufacturers,  but  then  to  pay  the  suppliers  slowly.    These  suppliers  must  engage  in  price  factoring \narrangements to insure they have enough cash flow to continue operations.  This increases costs not \nonly for the supplier, but across the end-to-end supply chain.\u201d To solve this problem, Sweetbridge plans \nto allow firms to collateralize their own assets and committed revenues as security for temporary trade \nfinancing.  These collateralized assets, which enter a sort of smart contract version of an escrow account \non the Sweetbridge blockchain, allow  the firms to take out I-Owe-Me\u2019s to finance their own current \npurchases with their own future earnings, thereby cutting out months of payment delays, mounds of \npaperwork,  and  (in  the  aggregate)  trillions  in  annual  trade  financing  costs  (Nelson  et  al.  2017).   This \nproject is currently still in the design phase (alpha), but will soon launch into beta testing, and will surely \nbe a hot area to watch.30 \n\n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n30   An  earlier  entrant  in  the  space,  called  Skuchain,  already  offers  some  of  the  trade  finance  functionality  proposed  by \nSweetbridge.  However, Skuchain operates in a more traditional manner, bringing together existing financiers and suppliers \non  a  common  blockchain  similar  to  the  Deloitte  and  IBM  pilots.

Furthermore, for a trade finance platform \nto fully leverage DLT and the automaticity of smart contracts, it would have to bring on board not only \nbanks,  but  also  shipping  agents,  freight  forwarders,  ports,  customs,  and  insurance  companies.  Some \nprogress  in  this  direction  is  being  reported,  but  is  fraught  with  coordination  and  implementation \ndifficulties that will take time to sort out.31 \n \n\nAlso, trade finance is heavily paper based and the various platforms for monitoring of supply \nchains  and  trade  transactions  are  fragmented  and  do  not  communicate  with  those  underlying  the \nemerging DLT trade finance. Further diffusion of new technologies is bound to be limited until all the \ncomponents  pertaining  to  the  various  aspects  of  trade  finance  transactions  have  been  digitized  and \nsystems\u2019  interoperability  has  been  fully  established  (The  Banker  2017).  National  governments  and \ninternational organizations like the ADB can play a key role in removing these remaining obstacles to \nDLT finance by promoting the diffusion of global digital standards among companies under their sphere \nof  influence.  Major  stepping  stones  in  that  direction  are  the  diffusion  of  digitization  and  identifier \nsystems for companies, which are essential also for the spread of DLT trade finance.  \n\n \nGlobal harmonized digital identities for companies worldwide\u2014or digitization in short\u2014assigns \nfirms an ID number that is linked to databases which banks and other stakeholders can use to access \ninformation underlying lending decisions. For this purpose, the G20 mandated the Financial Stability \nBoard to create the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).  Established in 2014, GLEIF has \nsince enrolled nearly 500,000 companies with a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) against a small fee. GLEIF \nis  currently  able  to  identify  firms  and  will  next  develop  capacity  to  identify  corporate  ownership \nstructures  and  assets.  Its  global  diffusion  will  lay  the  foundation  for  accessing  and  tracking  the  huge \namounts of data necessary for the establishment and operation of DLT-based trade finance, facilitating \nrisk  assessment  and  having  a  significant  impact  on  access  to  finance  for  SMEs.  It  is  now  the  role  of \ngovernments  and  international  organizations  to  create  the  necessary  incentives  for  companies  to \nacquire LEIs and to map any extant national ID systems with LEI to cement its foundational function for \nthe digitization of companies.32 \n \n\nA  further  enabling  factor  will  be  the  World  Trade  Board\u2019s  Digital  Standards  in  Trade  (DST) \ninitiative, for launch in January 2018. It aims to fill the lack of common standards in the trade system by \nproviding  a  fully  digitized  and  seamless  end-to-end  throughput  in  trade  transactions  worldwide  that \nwould help the various participants in a trade transaction communicate and share data with each other. \nLed  by  a  steering  committee  that  sets  its  direction  and  work  plan,  the  DST  will  adopt  standards  by \nworking  groups  consisting  of  private  and  public  sector  stakeholders  and  participants  involved  in  all \naspects of trade transactions. Unlike banks, shipping or freight forwarders that focus on standardizing \ndocuments only within the industry group they pertain to, DST\u2019s horizontal approach to interoperability \ncuts through all the interlinked transactions, from the time an exporter has a purchase order, all the way \nto its delivery to the buyer. Through the provision of technical assistance and capacity building, ADB \nand other multilateral development banks can support  DST and the adoption of common standards \namong  developing  country  stakeholders,  such  as  ports,  customs  authorities,  financial  intermediaries, \nand SMEs (World Trade Board 2017). \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n31   See Arnold (2017), where recent such efforts are described. \n32   Further on GLEIF\u2019s potential, see Beck (2016).  \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   13 \n\nIn  parallel  to  these  efforts,  international  development  lenders  should  keep  a  close  watch  on \nprojects  like  Sweetbridge,  which  could  potentially  eliminate  altogether  the  need  for  publicly  funded \ntrade financing for SMEs, thereby freeing up funds for other projects.  The best way to contribute to the \nultimate  success  of  such  initiatives  is  to  partner  with  them.    Public  trade  finance  providers  can  help \nidentify  and  recruit  suitable  SMEs  to  participate  in  proof  of  concept  and  pilot  tests  and  should  also \ncommit funds to help intensively test and assess the performance of the extremely complex sets of smart \ncontracts that will be required to make the vision of self-funded trade finance for SMEs a global reality. \n\n \nUse Case 3:  Project Aid Monitoring and Results-Based Disbursements \n\nC. \n \nMeasuring the impact of disbursed development aid and verifying the compliance of loan recipients with \nconditionality requirements are among the most central concerns of international development banks.  \nDLTs offer improved ways of conducting these assessments thanks to their ability to generate real-time \nperformance data.  This in turn enables lenders and donors to finance suitable development projects \nunder a pay-for-performance model.  It also allows complex projects to be reassessed and restructured \nmore quickly when it becomes evident that they are not achieving their intended aims. \n \n\nOn the pay-for-performance side, some of the most promising DLT ideas make use of sensor-\nbased and imaging technologies to collect accurate real-time field data.  The data gathering devices are \nintegrated  directly  onto  a  distributed  ledger,  which  transmits  the  data  for  real-time  monitoring  and \nanalysis, and in some cases, even makes automatic payouts based on predefined data triggers.33   \n\n \nOne prominent ongoing experiment that could potentially benefit from the introduction of a \nDLT in aid disbursements involves the provision of compensatory income transfers to indigenous groups \nwho protect their forests from clear-cutting (Hansen et al. 2013). Satellite photos of a group\u2019s customary \nterritory are taken at regular intervals to monitor the progress of deforestation.  If the images show no or \nlittle deforestation, the local people receive payments in compensation for the income they could have \nearned from selling the timber.  The compensation amount is tied directly to the preservation of the \nforest,  as  verified  by  unfalsifiable  external  data.  Early  results  indicate  that  this  program  is  proving \nsuccessful in slowing the progress of deforestation in certain parts of South America.34  It could in the \nfuture also be extended to encourage active reforestation in parts of the world where clear-cutting has \nled to soil erosion, biodiversity losses, and the elimination of important natural carbon sinks.   \n \n\n1. \n\nBenefits \n\n \nWhile  such  programs  can  operate  without  distributed  ledgers,  significant  benefits  can  be  derived  by \nintegrating DLTs into their workflow.  Collecting the information via a DLT would allow dedicated nodes \nto perform automated data analytics and/or employ machine learning to monitor and analyze the data \nsent by cameras or sensors in real time.   This reduces the time lags and costs associated with extracting \nproject performance data and analyzing it manually \u2018off-chain.\u2019 Additionally, once the data have been \ncollected and evaluated, they can be passed through smart contracts that generate automatic payments \nand send them back to the project participants in accordance with predefined instructions.   \n\n \nIn the case of the forest preservation project, the smart contract could be programmed to send \nback a certain amount of money if the satellite images show deforestation has been halted in the region, \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n33   For a listing of projects exploring the integration of data gathering devices and DLTs, see Postscapes (2017).  \n34   See Hansen et al. (2013) at abstract, finding however that \u201cBrazil\u2019s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset \n\nby increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\na slightly lower amount if it has slowed by a certain percentage on a month-to-month basis, and an even \nlower amount if it has slowed by less.  Executing payments \u2018on chain\u2019 in this manner eliminates the cost \nof arranging and using separate payment channels as well as the costs associated with generating an \naudit trail for payments, since the DLT transactions themselves serve as the audit trail.  Accountability \nreports  for  both  donors  and  recipients  can  also  be  generated  automatically  without  any  additional \nadministrative overhead. \n \n\nWhile the deforestation project is only a theoretical example, there are already live projects using \nDLTs to collect field data from IoT sensors.35  An experimental project in Germany is currently collecting \nweather sensor data from 30 rooftop devices and making micropayments to the owners of the devices \nin  exchange  for  the  data.36    The  same  concept  could  easily  be  applied  to  administer  crop-insurance \nprograms in vulnerable agrarian communities.  IoT devices could be deployed to monitor rainfall, hours \nof sunlight, wind speeds, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors in the region.  This could be \ncombined with time-lapse photography or satellite imagery to monitor the state of crop health across \nthe entire growing cycle.  The information could then be used to pay out on micro-insurance contracts \nin  the  event  small  farmers  lose  their  crops  due  to  adverse  weather  conditions.    Such  a  system  could \nrender it unnecessary to perform onsite investigations to rule out dishonest self-reporting or corruption; \nthe fact that the relevant conditions are monitored throughout the crop\u2019s life cycle makes it difficult to \ncheat the system.  \n \nAn interesting start-up in the UK called Alice (https://alice.si/) is using similar ideas to encourage \nmore  effective  charitable  giving.  Alice  allows  donors  to  donate  money  via  smart  contracts  toward \ncharitable projects they find worthwhile\u2013but on condition that the project achieves certain predefined \noutcomes.  The money is released as and when the desired benchmarks are reached. If only some of \nthem are achieved, only some of the pledged money is paid out. This kind of pay-for-performance model \nobviously only works for charitable organizations that are in a position to either self-fund or secure loans \nto finance their projects up-front.  Over time, however, those that develop reputations for successfully \nachieving  project  outcomes  should  see  their  up-front  cost  of  borrowing  fall.    Development  lenders \nshould  actively  track  the  information  gleaned  from  such  smart  contract-based  pay-for-performance \nsystems  and  use  this  information  to  make  better  informed  and  lower-risk  lending  decisions  when \nfinancing development projects. \n \n\n2 \n\nRisks and Implementation Challenges \n\n \nThe  major  implementation  hurdles  to  deploying  DLT-based  development  aid  and  conditionality \nassessment strategies are relatively straightforward.  They can only succeed in environments where it is \npossible to deploy field-based or remote sensors capable of providing relevant and accurate assessment \ninformation.  Devices deployed in a crop insurance context, for example, must be able to stand up to \nadverse weather conditions over extended periods.  They must also be engineered and deployed in such \na way as to make it difficult for the sensors to be tampered with or tricked into recording false data.  They \nmust have access to a stable power supply or have sufficient internal battery capacity to continue to \noperate.  And of course, they will only be useful if adequate infrastructure is in place to allow them to \nconnect  and  send  updates  to  a  DLT  on  a  regular  basis.    Hardware  costs  and  connectivity  gaps  are \ntherefore important limiting factors.

For  persons  who  are  currently  excluded  from  the  global  financial \nsystem, this means solving all of the challenges detailed in respect of the digital identity and financial \naccess  use  cases  described  above  as  a  precondition  to  integrating  automatic  payment  systems  into \nDLT-based pay-for-performance schemes. \n \nD. \n \nJust  as  sensors  and  cameras  can  be  integrated  with  DLTs,  so  too  can  meters  of  various  kinds.    This \nexplains why smart energy and smart mobility are among the most active areas of DLT experimentation.  \nOn the energy front, smart transactive microgrids are of particular interest in regions where sunlight is \nplentiful  but  centralized  electricity  production  or  distribution  is  inadequate.37    Microgrids  have  been \ndefined as \u201celectricity distribution systems containing loads and distributed energy resources, (such as \ndistributed  generators,  storage  devices,  or  controllable  loads)  that  can  be  operated  in  a  controlled, \ncoordinated way either while connected to the main power network or while islanded\u201d (CIGR\u00c9 C6.22 \nWorking Group 2015).  \n \n\nA \n\nleading \n\n(BMG. \nhttps://www.brooklyn.energy/about).  The BMG is a community-driven initiative launched in 2016 with \nthe following stated aims: \n \n\nMicrogrid \n\nBrooklyn \n\nexample \n\nproject \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n(i) \n\nincrease the amount of clean, renewable energy generated in the community by \nmembers of the community; \n\n(ii)  develop a connected network of distributed energy resources which will improve \n\nelectrical grid resiliency and efficiency; \n\n(iii)  manage  these  distributed  energy  resources  during  power  outages  and \n\nemergencies to protect the community and local economy; and \n\n(iv)  create  financial  incentives  and  business  models  that  encourage  community \ninvestment  in  their  energy  future, creating  energy  and  jobs  that  boost  the  local \neconomy. \n\n \n\nThe basic idea is to transform energy consumers into \u2018prosumers\u2019 while simultaneously replacing \ndirty energy with clean energy.  In essence, community members contribute to local renewable energy \nproduction  by  installing  solar  panels  on  their  rooftops.    A  device  called  a  transactive  grid  element \ncontinuously measures their energy production and consumption.  This information is shared with other \nparticipants over a DLT\u2014in this case a private permissioned blockchain\u2014which in turn enables them \nto act upon the information in concert in response to changing energy conditions within the grid.  At any \ngiven time, a microgrid participant might be producing more energy than it consumes, in which case it \nsells its excess energy to others, or consuming more than it produces, in which case it purchases the \nshortfall from others.  \n\n \n \n \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n37   For an overview of academic work on microgrid structures, see Stadlera et al.

This eliminates the need for cyclical meter checks \nand postconsumption billing processes.   \n \n\nDLTs can also help facilitate the financing for such projects.  In South Africa, a start-up called \nthe SunExchange (https://thesunexchange.com/) makes it possible for investors to purchase solar cells \nand lease them to schools and businesses in developing nations. The company identifies suitable sites \nfor its projects; arranges for the purchase, delivery, and installation of the solar cells; and  insures the \nprojects against fire, damage, and theft.  Once the project goes live, the SunExchange collects monthly \nrental fees out of the proceeds from the electricity generation and automatically distributes them back \nto investors, who can opt to be paid in either national currencies or Bitcoin.38 \n\n \nOther  projects  are  attempting  to  create  worldwide  markets  for  incentivizing  local  renewable \nenergy  production  and  allowing  local  producers  to  trade  with  one  another  over  a  distributed  ledger.  \nSolarcoin, for example, is a cryptocurrency whose value is defined in terms of electricity.  One Solarcoin \nrepresents  one  megawatt  hour  of  solar  electricity  generation.    The  Solarcoin  foundation  plans  to \ndistribute 99% of its coins to verified solar electricity producers for the production of 97,500 terawatt \nhours  over  40  years.    The  Solarcoin  project  is  in  its  infancy,  and  important  questions  of  technical \nimplementation as well as incentive structure design remained to be answered. But if projects like this \nmanage  to  gain  wide  enough  adoption,  green  energy-backed  cryptotokens  could  one  day  become \nintegrated  into  the  global  carbon  trading  system\u2014a  key  mechanism  for  reducing  carbon  emissions \nunder  the  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC).39    Indeed,  the  UNFCCC \nSecretariat  is  so  convinced  of  the  potential  of  DLTs  to  assist  with  climate  change  mitigation  that  it \ndecided to cosponsor a DLT climate hackathon that took place alongside the 23rd Conference of the \nParties meeting in Bonn in November of 2017.40  Similarly, ADB and other developing lenders have been \nactively pursuing the idea of DLT adoption in their efforts at climate change mitigation (Zhai 2017). \n\n \nAs a complement to clean energy production, DLT-based initiatives to encourage green mobility \noptions are also advancing rapidly.  Electric vehicle (EV) sales have gained market share quickly in many \nmarkets, thanks to advancements in EV technology and favorable tax incentives.  Analysts expect this \ntrend to accelerate further in the wake of several governments\u2019 recent announcements of dates beyond \nwhich the sale of new nonelectric vehicles will be prohibited within their borders.41  Within Asia, the PRC \nis leading the charge in setting aggressive targets for electric vehicle quotas as a means of tackling the \ncountry\u2019s smog problem (McDonald 2017). \n\n \nThese developments have lead DLT innovators to partner with auto manufacturers to solve the \nproblem  of  inadequate  public  charging  station  infrastructure.    Pilot  projects  built  on  the  IOTA  and \nEthereum  platforms  in  Europe  (innogy  2017,  ZF  2017)  and  the  United  States  (Spector  2017), \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n38   In principle, similar models could be applied to micro wind energy generation projects in suitable locations provided micro \n\nwind turbine technologies can be further improved to sufficient efficiency levels. \n\n39   See Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which addresses internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. \n40   The hackathon brought 100 developers from around the world to Bonn for 4 days to \u2018hack\u2019 intensively on 5 climate change \nproblems  for  which  DLTs  could  potentially  provide  solutions,  including  identification  and  tracking  of  emissions,  carbon \n  See  Hack4Climate. \npricing,  distributed \nhttps://www.hack4climate.org/#home. \n\nland  use, \n\nsustainable \n\nsustainable \n\ntransport. \n\nenergy, \n\nand \n\n41   Norway has been the most aggressive on this front, announcing a ban on the sale of new cars with combustion engines as \n\nfrom 2025. See Hockenos (2017). \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   17 \n\nrespectively, use DLTs to connect electric car owners and private charging station owners in a peer-to-\npeer sharing economy.  Doing so extends the range of electric vehicles by enabling them to recharge in \nplaces  where  public  charging  stations  are  not  available.    It  also  greatly  increases  the  efficiency  and \nreduces the cost of ownership of private charging stations by putting them to work on behalf of others \nduring periods when their owners would ordinarily leave them idle.  Enabling these kinds of peer-to-peer \nmarkets  reduces  the  level  of  EV  infrastructure  funding  required  of  governments  to  meet  aggressive \ntargets for electric vehicle adoption. \n\n \n2. \n\nRisks and Implementation Challenges \n\n \nAn  obvious  limitation  of  microgrids  is  that  the  energy  production  and  consumption  patterns  of \nparticipants within a closely-knit community are highly correlated.  All produce more energy on sunny \ndays than cloudy ones; all tend to push energy during the day and pull energy at night; and so on.  To \nsmooth out consumption and production spikes, it is necessary to pursue one or more of three solutions: \n \n\nimprove energy storage solutions (battery capacity and efficiency); \n\n(i) \n(ii)  connect microgrids to main grids, so that load balancing can be performed by the \n\nmain grid; or \n\n(iii)  connect  microgrids  to  one  another  in  such  a  way  as  to  counterbalance  the \nproduction and consumption patterns of one grid by matching it up with a grid \ndisplaying opposite (or at least uncorrelated) patterns. \n\n \n\nDLTs can solve the peer-to-peer payments component of the second and third solutions, but \nthey  cannot  help  much  with  the  actual  electricity  distribution.  It  is  expensive  and  inefficient  to  send \nenergy across large distances, since much energy is lost in transit.  Indeed, this is one of the arguments \nin  favor  of  microgrids  as  a  sustainable  energy  source  in  the  first  place.    Connecting  noncorrelated \nmicrogrids together to balance out each other\u2019s load patterns is therefore only practicable in regions \nwhere  two  or  more  noncorrelated  types  of  micro-energy  production  can  be  located  within  close \nproximity to one another\u2014for example, solar, hydro, and wind power.  In regions where the conditions \nfor this are not favorable, connecting microgrids to main grids provides an alternative in some cases.   But \nagain, distance poses a barrier, especially for remote and/or difficult to reach places, such as outlying \nislands, mountainous regions, and sparsely settled communities spread across large areas.  If microgrids \nare  to  prove  a  sustainable  solution  for  remote  areas  of  developing  Asia,  then,  investment  in  battery \ncapacity improvements will often be the best way forward. \n\n \nWith  respect  to  peer-to-peer  mobility  markets,  the  major  barrier  to  adoption\u2014apart  from \nsufficient  micro-payment  solutions  and  adequate  road  networks\u2014is  access  to  the  private  finance \nneeded  to  purchase  electric  vehicles  and  electric  charging  stations  in  the  first  place.    Development \nlenders should consider partnering with innovative companies like the SunExchange to explore creative \nfinancing  solutions  that  cover  the  initial  set-up  costs  of  transitioning  to  smart  peer-to-peer  electric \nvehicle markets.   \n \nSuch crowd-funded investment or leasing  models  could conceivably incentivize not  only the \npurchase of private charging stations but also of electric vehicles.  Development projects could scope \nwhat routes need to be outfitted with private charging stations and actively solicit local property owners \nto  allow  their  installation  in  return  for  earning  a  percentage  of  the  revenues  generated.  Micro-\nentrepreneurs wishing to provide DLT-powered taxi or ride-sharing services could likewise lease their \nelectric vehicles from groups of crowd-funders or private owners rather than having to bear the full cost \nof  purchase  up-front.    All  of  this  would  require  the  strategic  deployment  of  hundreds  of  smart  IoT \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\ndevices, however, which in turn can only be done in local environments where political stability and the \nphysical  security  of  property  are  relatively  high.    Similarly  to  the  other  use  cases,  the  successful \ndeployment  of  DLT  to  the  energy  sector  will  have  to  be  accompanied  by  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening to establish the necessary preconditions.  \n\n \nMultilateral lenders have built up a substantial stake in developing countries\u2019 energy sectors and \nhave a crucial role to play in establishing an enabling environment for the diffusion of new technologies. \nAround  $5  billion  per  year  of  ADB  lending  goes  to  the  energy  sector.  Half  of  this  goes  to  renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency projects, and the other half goes to transmission and distribution systems. \nThis  provides  large  scope  for  ADB  to  actively  facilitate  the  introduction  of  DLT  and  other  advanced \ntechnologies to its energy sector operations, thus fostering development impacts and crucial technology \ntransfers across the region (Zhai 2017).  \n\n \nUse Case 5:  Sustainable Supply Chain Management \n\nE. \n \nManaging global supply chains in a way that ensures products and services are produced in accordance \nwith  recognized  human  rights  principles,  sound  consumer  safety  norms,  and  environmental  best \npractices  presents  a  major  challenge  for  modern  firms  and  governments.    Even  where  there  is  broad \nagreement concerning the standards to be adhered to\u2014for example, the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals,  or  the  carbon  targets  of  the  Paris  Agreement  Roadmap\u2014it  is  no  simple  task  to  monitor  the \ncompliance  of  each  step  of  the  production  process  within  a  global  supply  chain  that  can  sometimes \nentail hundreds, or even thousands, of input components from disparate vendors in dozens of countries.  \nApplying DLTs to supply chain management can help reduce the complexity of this problem, even if it \ncan\u2019t fully solve it. \n \n\n1. \n\nBenefits \n\n \nProvenance,  a  company  offering  platforms  for  openly  shared  product  information,  used  blockchain \ntechnology to tag and track tuna caught by fishermen in Indonesia during the first half of 2016 (Hannam \n2016). To register the origin of the catch in the blockchain, fisherman sent text messages at the time of \nthe  catch  with  geospatially  tagged  information  that  was  first  validated  and  then  made  part  of  an \nunalterable blockchain record testifying to the location of the catch.42 This information gives consumers \nthe ability to trace back the origin of their fish \u2018from hook to fork\u2019 (Banker 2017).  Catch data of this type \ncan also be proactively monitored by local authorities to intercept fishing vessels that exceed their catch \nlimits and/or prevent too many vessels from overfishing particular marine areas.  \n \n\nIBM  is  working  with  several  partners  to  develop  a  similar  project  that  seeks  to  track  the \nprovenance of perishable products for food safety reasons. 43 The aim is to log harvested food products \nat their source, then use radio frequency identification, or RFID, tags to track their progress from the \nsource  through  shipping  and  processing  channels  and  eventually  into  retail  stores.    By  doing  so,  the \ncompanies  hope  to  \u2018create  further  transparency  in  the  food  sector  by  tracking  food  transactions \nthroughout the world and using this information to quickly identify and isolate any food source that is \ncontaminated.\u201944    This  would  allow  companies,  in  the  case  of  contamination  scares,  to  pull  only  the \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n42   See  Banker  (2017),  where  he  notes,  \u201cProvenance  takes  information  from  sensors  or  RFID  tags  and  records  it  on  the \n\nblockchain to track the fish from \u2018hook to fork.\u2019\u201d \n\n43   Partners include Dole, Golden State Foods, Kroger, McCormick and Company, Nestl\u00e9, Tyson Foods, Unilever, and Walmart.  \nSupply  Chain.\u201d \n\n\u201cBlockchain \n\nproject, \n\n(2017). \n\ndetails \n\nIBM\u2019s \n\nIBM. \n\nsee \n\nFor \n\nfor \n\nof \n\nSee  Webb \nhttps://www.ibm.com/blockchain/supply-chain/. \n\n44   IBM. \u201cBlockchain for Supply Chain.\u201d https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/supply-chain/. \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   19 \n\nspecifically  affected  food  products  from  circulation  and  focus  remediation  efforts  on  the  individual \nfarms, plants, or shipping facilities that produced the contamination.  There are several countries\u2014also \nin Asia\u2014where product contamination episodes frequently generate health crises.  Making use of DLT-\nbased pinpoint tracking abilities could thus potentially save dozens of lives and millions of dollars each \nyear. \n \n\nDLT-based supply chain management can also help monitor and meet environmental targets. \nA  California-based  start-up  called  Xpansiv  (https://www.xpansivdata.com/)  is  using  IoT  devices  to \ncapture the environmental attributes of commodities so that they can be differentiated according to \ntheir climate friendliness.  For example, a pilot project in Wyoming is measuring the level of escaped \nmethane emanating from natural gas wells and feeding this data in real time to a blockchain (Xpansiv \nData  2017).    Because  the  data  is  recorded  without  human  intervention,  there  is  no  opportunity  for \nintentional underreporting of harmful emissions.  The emissions generated as a byproduct of the natural \ngas extraction can then be attached to the product on a per unit basis.   \n\n \nThis  approach  allows  states  to  legally  justify\u2014for  example  under  article  XX  of  the  WTO\u2019s \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\u2014assigning different taxes and customs duties to otherwise like \nproducts that are produced in more, or less, environmentally friendly ways.  By extension, it is possible \nto imagine associating other process-related attributes with specific products on a granular level.  These \ncould include the payment of fair wages, the observance of worker safety rules and consumer protection \nstandards, and more.  In principle, anything that can be reliably measured can be tracked via a DLT and \nreflected in a product\u2019s ultimate price.   \n\n \nDLT-based global supply chains might even one day program smart contracts to automatically \nadjust the prices paid to each supplier along the way in accordance with the supplier\u2019s demonstrated \nlabor,  environmental,  or  consumer  protection  performance  in  each  case.    In  short,  DLTs  promise  to \nimprove  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  global  supply  chain  practices  while  simultaneously \nreducing  the  costs  associated  with  tracking  and  documenting  both  desirable  and  undesirable  by-\nproducts of production processes. \n \n\n2. \n\nRisks and Implementation Challenges \n\n \nAs  was  the  case  with  the  smart  energy  and  smart  mobility  use  cases  described  above,  DLT-based \nsustainable supply chain management will only be as good as the devices and technologies supporting \nit.    Considerations  of  IoT  device  robustness  and  tamper  proofness,  electrification  and  connectivity \nbarriers, user design challenges, etc. therefore apply here as well.   \n \n\nAn  even  more  difficult  hurdle  in  many  supply  chain  management  use  cases  is  the  threshold \nquestion  of  what  to  measure  and  how  to  measure  it.    For  example,  building  carbon  footprints  into \nproduct  prices  by  automatically  capturing  and  transmitting  production  process  data  across  a  supply \nchain via a DLT presupposes that there is an agreed global definition of \u2018carbon footprint\u2019 and a globally \nagreed set of methods for measuring and reporting it.  Otherwise, the carbon footprint reported by Nike \nversus  Adidas  in  connection  with  the  manufacture  of  a  single  pair  of  running  shoes  might  very  well \namount to the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges.  Such information only becomes valuable \nto the extent that it is standardized and hence capable of meaningful comparison.  This highlights the \nneed  for  development  lenders  to  partner  with,  participate  in,  and/or  provide  technical  and  financial \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 533 \n\nsupport  to  standards-making  bodies  to  develop  broad-based  consensus  around  and  adoption  of \nsensible sustainable development-related standards.45 \n\n \nFinally,  even  once  standards  have  been  agreed,  practical  implementation  challenges  often \nremain.  Some by-products of production processes\u2014like methane gas emissions\u2014lend themselves to \neasy measurement, but others will require the invention of brand new tracking methods and devices.  \nDevising  a  system  to  accurately  associate  laborer  wages  paid  with  each  unit  of  a  particular  product \nmanufactured is a nontrivial process engineering problem.  So, too, is figuring out how to apportion units \nof desirable and undesirable attributes to a complex product across each step of its production cycle \nalong a global supply chain. There are difficult questions of organizational management and production \nprocess design embedded in these tasks.   \n\n \nThis is no doubt why most DLT proof of concepts for supply chain management have so far \nfocused on the simplest cases\u2014like whole fresh food products moving from source to consumer with \nlittle or no processing required along the way.  Extending this idea to more complex supply chains will \nrequire a significant investment of time and resources in project scoping exercises and feasibility studies. \n \n \n\nIV.  \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n \nAs this study has shown, there are many exciting areas of potential application of DLTs within the Asian \ndevelopment context.  All five of the use cases investigated promise to deliver tangible improvements \nto  the  process  of  financing,  deploying,  tracking,  and  evaluating  development  assistance  in  key  target \nsectors.    Common  denominators  in  terms  of  benefits  to  be  realized  from  the  deployment  of  DLTs \ninclude:  increased  transparency  and  accountability,  reduced  transaction  and  monitoring  costs, \nimproved real-time data collection and analysis possibilities, and expanded participation opportunities \nfor currently vulnerable, excluded, and underserved populations.  Overall, the foregoing survey has made \nclear that there are areas within each of the five use cases where DLT experimentation can be expected \nto  produce  immediate  significant  benefits,  others  where  midterm  potential  can  be  released  with  a \nmoderate amount of further research and investment, and still others where important technical pieces \nare  still  missing  and  hence  longer-term  potential  can  only  be  realized  after  considerable  additional \ntechnical, infrastructural, or regulatory development. \n \n\nThe key to determining which of DLTs\u2019 many potentially beneficial use cases fall into which of \nthese three baskets lies in understanding the major risks and implementation challenges associated with \neach.  In undertaking this sorting exercise: \n \n\n(i)  Development lenders such as the ADB should give due regard to underlying infrastructure \nrequirements\u2014especially  electrification  and  connectivity\u2014before  embarking  on  overly \nambitious DLT proof of concepts.   \n\n(ii)  Experimental projects should be selected and conceptualized on the basis of prevailing \nconditions on-the-ground, so that the appropriate DLT architecture can be selected for \neach case.   \n\n(iii)  DLT project design must cater to end-user limitations and minimize as much as possible \nthe gap between what the technology is capable of and what the average target user can \nactually do with it. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n45   An interesting project to make the standard-setting process itself more open and more efficient using DLTs is Collaborase \n\n(https://collaborase.com/). \n\n\fDistributed Ledger Technologies for Developing Asia   |   21 \n\n(iv)  Wherever  possible,  platform-neutral  solutions  should  be  preferred  to  platform-specific \nones to avoid the lock-in effects of committing to currently popular DLTs which might \nquickly be eclipsed by superior ones as DLT innovation continues to progress. \n\n(v)  For  projects  involving  integration  with  IoT  sensors  and  those  providing  automatic  data \nreporting and analysis, the development of broadly shared standards and definitions like \nthe  Digital  Standards  in  Trade  Initiative  should  be  pursued  in  advance  of  project \nimplementation  so  that  the  data  derived  from  the  DLT  integration  is  meaningful  and \nactionable.   \nInvestment  in  self-sovereign  digital  identity  solutions,  both  for  individuals  and  for  legal \nentities  (including  SMEs,  for  example,  through  the  GLEI)  should  be  prioritized  as  a \ngateway condition for the success of all other DLT use cases.   \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nOverall, the positive disruptive potential of distributed ledger technologies in the development \ncontext  is  enormous.    By  assessing  them  carefully  and  investing  in  them  strategically,  international \ndevelopment  lenders  can  play  a  key  role  in  helping  unleash  their  positive  developmental  impact \nthroughout the Asian region. \n \n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\f\u00a0\n\nREFERENCES\uf02a \n\n \nTechnical References \n \nBen-Sasson,  Eli,  Alessandro  Chiesa,  Christina  Garman,  Matthew  Green,  Ian  Miers,  Eran  Tromer,  and \nMadars  Virza.  2014.  \u201cZerocash:  Decentralized  Anonymous  Payments  from  Bitcoin.\u201d \nProceedings  of  the  IEEE  Symposium  on  Security  &  Privacy,  Oakland.  http://zerocash \n-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf. \n\n \nButerin,  Vitalik.  2015.\u201cA  Next  Generation  Smart  Contract  and  Decentralized  Application  Platform.\u201d \n\nEthereum White Paper. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper. \n\n \nCroman, Kyle, Christian Decker, Ittay Eyal, Adem Efe Gencer, Ari Juels, Ahmed Kosba, \n \nAndrew Miller, Prateek Saxena, Elaine Shi, Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, Dawn Song, and Roger \n \nWattenhofer. 2016. \u201cOn Scaling Decentralized Blockchains.\u201d Position paper delivered at the Financial \nCryptography  &  Data  Security  20th  International  Conference,  Barbados.  http://fc16.ifca.ai/ \nbitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf. \n\n \nMiers,  Ian,  Christina  Garman,  Matthew  Green,  and  Aviel  D.

Ironically, that same hype is what hinders the objective evaluation of the benefits \nand drawbacks of these exciting technologies. This paper takes a first pass at assessing feasible areas of \npractical implementation for DLTs mainly in the context of development finance. It takes a closer look \nat five use cases\u2014digital identity, trade finance, project aid monitoring, smart energy, and supply chain \nmanagement\u2014to assess their implementation limits and potential. This paper also points to areas of \npotential application of DLTs within the Asian development context, including providing financial system \naccess to billions of excluded populations. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people.
