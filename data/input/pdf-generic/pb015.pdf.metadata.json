As of 5 May\n2003, SARS has infected more than 6,500 people worldwide, and\ncaused mounting concern. A number of East and Southeast Asian\neconomies, including People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong,\nChina; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Viet Nam have been put under\nconsiderable strain. The epidemic has also affected other economies,\nalthough to a lesser extent.\n\nSome  positive  developments  and  improved  public  health\nmeasures in recent weeks have added weight to arguments that\nSARS, although serious, will cause only a temporary shock to\neconomic growth. However, the implications stemming from SARS\nextend beyond the short-term horizon. The impact of SARS, and\nreactions to it, raise many questions. Two are particularly important:\n\n(i) Why has attention to SARS been so prominent given its\n\nrelatively low morbidity and mortality?\n\n(ii) How should governments deal with unexpected shocks\n\nrelated to the outbreak of contagious diseases?\n\nThis brief assesses the economic impact of SARS in a number\nof East and Southeast Asian economies and explores these issues.\n\nShort-term Economic Impact of SARS\n\nChannels through which the Impact of SARS is Felt\n\nIn the short term, SARS mainly affects economic growth by\n\nreducing demand:\n\n(i) Consumer confidence has dramatically declined in a number\nof economies, leading to a significant reduction in private\nconsumption spending. Much of the impact stems from the\ngreat uncertainty and fear generated by SARS.  People have\nopted to stay at home to reduce the probability of infection.\n(ii) Service exports, in particular tourism-related exports, have\n\nbeen hard hit.\n\n(iii) Investment  is  affected  by  reduced  overall  demand,\nheightened uncertainties, and increased risks. Excess\ncapacity will emerge or increase. Furthermore, foreign\n\n\finvestment inflow may be delayed or reduced in reaction to\nSARS.\n\n(iv) While increased government spending will mitigate the\nimpact, the ability of governments to revive economies\nfacing widespread reductions in private spending is limited.\n\nAlthough SARS has affected every component of aggregate\ndemand, private consumption has particularly borne the brunt of the\nimpact. Services involving face-to-face contact have been dealt a\nsevere  blow  by  the  widespread  fear  of  infection  through  such\ninteractions. Tourism, transportation (particularly airlines), and retailing\nhave  been  the  hardest  hit  sectors  as  consumers  shun  shops,\nrestaurants, and entertainment venues; and travelers cancel trips. As\nvisitor arrivals have dropped, hotel occupancy rates have fallen\nsignificantly in Hong Kong, China and in Singapore. The reduction of\nhotel rates has not been able to lure travelers back. Airlines such as\nCathay Pacific have canceled a large number of flights. Tourism\naccounts  for  over  9%  of  GDP  in  East Asia  and  about  11%  in\nSoutheast Asia. The SARS-induced stress on this industry will be felt\nby other industries in the two subregions.\n\nWhile the East and Southeast Asian subregions have been the\nmost affected, the impact of SARS has spread elsewhere, through (i)\nthe spread of the virus and the disease itself; (ii) reduction in import\ndemand by Asian economies, especially for tourism-related services;\nand (iii) weakened consumer and investor sentiment because of\nincreased uncertainty.\n\nOne factor that might offset this negative impact is the rebound\nof private spending when SARS is brought under control. Consumers\nmay compensate for their reduction in consumption by subsequently\nincreasing their spending. While domestic consumption could quickly\nchange once confidence resumes, it may take a longer period for\nforeign travelers and investors to return.\n\nThe Impact of SARS\u2014Macroeconomic Simulations\n\nThe impact of SARS critically depends on\n\nthe seriousness of SARS\nthe duration of SARS\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii) the structure of an economy, particularly the importance of\n\nservice industries in GDP\n\n2\n\n\fThe recently published Asian Development Outlook 2003\nforecasts (ADB 2003) reflect an assumption that the most intensive\nimpact will be confined to 2 months. The implementation of effective\ncontainment measures against SARS in a number of economies since\nMarch has lent support to this perspective. However, many questions\nremain unanswered about the development and nature of SARS, and\nthese unknown factors complicate analysis of its impact. In order to\nallow for these lacunae, two scenarios are considered here. One\nassumes that SARS will have a serious impact in the second quarter\nof 2003, and the other assumes that it will have a major impact in the\nsecond and third quarters of 2003. Given the uncertainties involved,\nwe need to monitor and evaluate developments closely, and to be\nprepared  to  revisit  the  estimates  as  circumstances  change.\nFurthermore, any scenario design will involve a degree of arbitrariness\nand judgment. The results are thus indicative rather than definitive.\n\nIt is also assumed that the initial impact will mainly be through\nreduced demand for services. The reduction in service sector growth\nis  then  translated  to  an  equivalent  reduction  in  autonomous\nconsumption expenditure, which is used as the input for the scenarios.\nThe  macroeconomic  simulations  use  the  Oxford  Economic\nForecasting model (OEF). The results show that GDP growth in East\nand Southeast Asian economies is likely to be reduced by around 0.2-\n1.8 percentage points in 2003 if SARS persists for a quarter in\nindividual economies. If the impact of SARS extends into the third\nquarter of 2003, GDP growth is likely to be reduced by 0.5 to 4.0\npercentage points in individual economies (Table 1).\n\nA reduction in GDP growth of this magnitude will mean large\nlosses in income and output. The estimated income loss ranges from\nUS$12.3-28.4 billion for East and Southeast Asia as a whole under\nthe two scenarios. Of particular concern is the fact that SARS will not\nonly induce hardship for many, but also intensify the problems faced\nby the poorest and most vulnerable groups in society due to their\nlimited access to medical services.\n\nThe weakening of demand will further reduce inflation and\nintensify deflationary pressure in some economies, including PRC;\nHong Kong, China; and Taipei,China. Weakened demand will also\ncause the unemployment rate to rise. Although reduced service\nexports will lower foreign exchange receipts, imports may be lowered\neven more due to a significant weakening of domestic demand in the\neconomies concerned. This means that the current account balance\nmay not worsen in the short run.\n\n3\n\n\fTable 1.

The pronounced impact of SARS can be attributed to\nthe combination of two aspects of information about the illness:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nthe almost costless and rapid transmission of information\ndue  to  the  development  of  modern  media  and\ncommunication technologies, and\nthe lack of sufficient medical information on SARS.\n\nInformation is a valuable resource.  A lack of information creates\ndifficulties for individuals to accurately evaluate the consequences of\na particular event. SARS is a new disease. It will take time for\nscientists to totally understand the virus. Developing an effective\ndiagnosis and treatment is an even more difficult and time-consuming\nprocess. On the other hand, information on the causalities induced\nby SARS is freely available and tends to dominate the media while\n\n4\n\n\feffective  treatment  remains  elusive.  This  naturally  leads  to  a\nsomewhat exaggerated perception about the danger of the disease.\nConsequently, there has been heightened uncertainty and perhaps a\ndegree of overreaction in some cases.\n\nHow should Governments Respond\nto SARS and Similar Situations?\n\nTwo aspects of SARS warrant government intervention. The first\nis that the information that needs to be collected and disseminated\nto effectively assess SARS displays the characteristics of a public\ngood. Second, there are externalities related to contagious diseases\nin the sense that they affect third parties in ways that are not reflected\nin market transactions. Public goods and externalities are typical\nareas where there are market failures, and government action is\nneeded to correct such failures.\n\nProvision and Acquisition of Accurate Information\n\nThe accurate, timely, and transparent provision of information on\nthe  nature  and  extent  of  SARS  by  governments  is  critical  for\ncontaining the epidemic and reducing public fears and uncertainty.\nGovernments need to work closely with medical professionals to\ngenerate and disseminate accurate information about the risks and\nextent of a disease, and preventative measures available. A balance\nneeds to be struck between alerting people to the risks involved and\npreventing people from panicking and overreacting.  Due to the highly\neffective channels of information transmission now in place, any\napparent lack of transparency in providing information is likely to\ncause second-guessing and panic among the general population.\nGovernments therefore need to utilize the increasing influence and\nreach of the modern media to disseminate information so as to ensure\nrational thinking and sensible actions prevail.\n\nContaining the Disease\n\nThe SARS epidemic demonstrates that with the increased flow\nof people, goods and services, and information across borders, both\npositive and negative developments can quickly be transmitted within\na country and spill over to other countries. Early identification and\ncontainment are critical, as any delays will create greater costs later\non. As pointed out by Baltimorem (2003), Nobel prize laureate in\n\n5\n\n\fmedicine, targeted and aggressive public health responses need to\nbe combined with a rational evaluation of risks so as to minimize\ndisruption to people\u2019s lives.\n\nGovernment Budget\n\nThe occurrence of sudden, unexpected shocks such as SARS\nstretches government resources. At the same time, the resulting\ndecrease in economic activity will reduce government revenue. This,\ntogether with increased public spending to prevent and combat the\ndisease, will worsen government fiscal positions. In some cases,\nactive stimulus packages may also be needed to revive the economy.\nThe possibility of episodes like SARS emphasizes the need for\ngovernments to implement prudent fiscal policies, to accumulate\nprimary surpluses, and to set aside appropriate amounts in their\nbudgets for unexpected contingencies.\n\nBeyond SARS\u2014Developing Long-term Strategies\nand Capacities to Deal with Contagious Diseases\n\nSARS is not the first outbreak of a contagious disease in the\nmodern era. One can be certain that it is not the last one either.\nFurthermore,  the  rise  of  drug-resistant  microbes  and  global\nresurgence of formerly controlled diseases such as tuberculosis\nmeans that the provision of effective public health measures is more\nimportant than ever. In the longer term, as SARS abates, attention\nneeds to be directed toward considering broad issues germane to all\nepidemics such as:\n\n(i) how to minimize the occurrence of contagious diseases,\n(ii) how governments can best respond to such emergency\n\n(iii) how health systems can be strengthened to cope with such\n\n(iv) how international cooperation can most effectively be carried\n\nsituations,\n\nsituations, and\n\nout.\n\nThe relatively effective containment of SARS in Hong Kong,\nChina and in Singapore shows that the capacity of the health system\nis critical in reducing the duration of diseases such as SARS. In\naddition to improving the health system itself, two aspects are\nparticularly relevant:\n\n6\n\n\f(i) Sufficient and suitably targeted public spending to generate\nresearch that ensures effective diagnosis and treatment of\ndiseases is imperative. Public funding devoted to forward-\nlooking  research  on  contagious  and  communicable\ndiseases is essential.\n\n(ii) Given the global implications of contagious diseases,\ngovernments need to intensify cooperation and coordination.\nAs well as coming up with common responsive measures\nto diseases that have already struck such as SARS, there\nis a particular need for developed countries and more\nadvanced developing member countries to devote funds\ntoward undertaking collaborative anticipatory and proactive\nresearch on combating such diseases. Much effort is also\nneeded  to  develop  effective  policy  measures  and\ninstitutional capacity for preventing, reporting, monitoring,\nand containing all contagious diseases.\n\nConclusions\n\nSARS has caused serious disruption to short-term economic\ngrowth. Its long-term impact largely depends on whether governments\ncan speedily implement effective public health policies. Given the\nexternalities related to contagious diseases, governments need to\nplay a major role in preventing and containing diseases, and in\ngenerating  research  outcomes  to  facilitate  rapid  and  effective\ndiagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe SARS epidemic demonstrates that:\n\n(i) The  accurate,  timely,  and  transparent  provision  of\ninformation  on  the  nature  and  extent  of  diseases  by\ngovernments is critical for educating the public about the real\nrisks and reducing public fears and uncertainties. A balance\nneeds to be struck between alerting the public to the\npotential  dangers  involved  and  preventing  panic  and\noverreaction to the danger concerned.\n\n(ii) Early identification and containment is critical, as any\n\ndelays will create greater costs later on.\n\n(iii) SARS is merely one of many contagious diseases that\ncould potentially flare up. Public policy needs to go beyond\nSARS to make provisions for all contagious diseases.\nEfforts need to be put into applying and maintaining the\n\n7\n\n\flessons learned from the SARS crisis after it is controlled.\nIn particular, there is a need to minimize the occurrence of\nall  contagious  diseases;  to  effectively  respond  to\nemergency situations; and to strengthen health systems so\nthat they have the ability to cope with similar situations in\nthe future.\n\n(iv) The global implications of serious contagious diseases\nmeans that governments need to intensify cooperation and\ncoordination.  There is a particular need for developed\ncountries and more advanced developing member countries\nto devote funds toward undertaking collaborative, proactive,\nand forward-looking research on combating such diseases.\nCounties also need to commit to collaborative schemes to\ndevelop  effective  policy  frameworks  and  institutional\ncapacity for preventing, reporting, monitoring, and containing\nall contagious diseases.\n\n(v) The  occurrence  of  emergency  situations  such  as  the\noutbreak of SARS shows that government budgets need to\nbe prudent so that they are capable of handling unheralded\npublic health crises.  An appropriate amount of funds should\nbe set aside to cope with such contingencies.\n\nIf good strategies can be drawn up from the lessons learned in\ncombating the spread of SARS, the world at large will benefit in the\nlong run.\n\nReferences\n\nAsian Development Bank, 2003.
