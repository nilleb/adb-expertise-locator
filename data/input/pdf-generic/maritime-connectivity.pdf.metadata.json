Introduction \nArchipelagic Southeast Asia (aSEA) covers five Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) member countries\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nSingapore\u2014together with Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Timor-Leste.1 The aSEA region \nincludes the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area \n(BIMP-EAGA) and the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT). \nThe key to understanding the region lies in an appreciation of its archipelagic nature. aSEA \nincludes more than 24,000 islands spread across 5,200 km from east to west and 3,400 km \nfrom north to south. It has a population of over 350 million, 225 million of whom live in \nIndonesia with a further 87 million living in the Philippines (Green, 2008).\nTo the inhabitants of the archipelago, the sea is at once a link and a barrier, as well as a \nresource and a challenge. On the positive side of the ledger, the sea provides food and \nemployment, while the danger of an unsustainable marine environment and the fact that \nproximity to the sea heightens vulnerability to national disaster are potential negatives. \nThis paper provides a detailed overview of maritime connectivity in the aSEA region. Section \n2 discusses the economic diversity and development gaps that exist among and within the \naSEA countries. Section 3 argues for the importance of improving maritime connectivity in \nbridging this economic divide as well as its role in economic development and poverty \nalleviation. Section 4 examines the development of the maritime sector including assessing \nthe demand for maritime transport and the supply of shipping services in the aSEA region. \nSection 5 assesses the region's existing maritime infrastructure, particularly the adequacy \nand efficiency of ports. The region's maritime policies related to shipping and ports are \nexamined in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 provides key policy recommendations that could \nstrengthen maritime connectivity in the aSEA region. This final section also highlights the \ncosts and potential problems that may arise with the implementation of policies to improve \nmaritime connectivity. \n2. The aSEA Economies\nThe aSEA economies are extremely diverse (see Table 1, page 36). Their population varies \nfrom 225 million in Indonesia to 40,000 in Brunei. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nvaries  from  $440  in  Timor-Leste  to  over  $35,000  in  Singapore.  aSEA  countries  differ \nsignificantly in their reliance on foreign trade. Measured by the ratio of exports to GDP, the \ndegree of trade openness varies widely from 2.2% in Timor-Leste to 230.9% in Singapore. \nWhile the ASEAN member nations of aSEA are at first glance diverse, they share a number \nof  common  features.  Singapore  is  a  mature  economy  with  a  level  of  GDP  per  capita \ncomparable with many advanced western industrial nations. Having experienced strong \n                                                           \n \n1\n   Where relevant, this report will make reference to Thailand as well. ", "2 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\neconomic growth in the 1980s and early 1990s, Malaysia has enjoyed renewed growth \nfollowing the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Brunei is a wealthy country heavily \ndependent on earnings from oil. Indonesia developed rapidly in the 1980s on the basis of \nlabor-intensive manufacturing (mainly centered on Java) but has failed to maintain early \nmomentum. The Philippines has yet to show higher sustained growth. These countries have \na number of features in common: relatively open economic policies; low and reducing levels \nof  tariff  protection;  and  a  strong  reliance  on  export-led  economic  growth.  Indonesia, \nMalaysia and the Philippines also have in common that large areas of the country are not \nwell-connected and much poorer than the main centers (eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia, \nsouthern Philippines). \nPNG and Timor-Leste are at a much earlier stage of economic growth than their ASEAN \ncounterparts. Not only is their GDP per capita much lower, but Timor-Leste\u2019s very low trade \nintensity reflects the country\u2019s wider political and economic problems. PNG and Timor-\nLeste\u2019s transport needs and existing service patterns differ significantly from those of the \nASEAN members of aSEA. Timor-Leste has extremely limited airline and shipping links. \nPNG's connectivity is also poor and tends to be oriented towards Australia rather than \nSoutheast Asia.\nThe development gap between the ASEAN members of aSEA and PNG can be considered \nanalogous with that between the more advanced ASEAN countries (the ASEAN-6) and the \nnewer and less developed members i.e., Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet \nNam.\n3. The Importance of Maritime Connectivity \nImproved  connectivity,  especially  through  transport  links,  is  an  essential  condition  for \neconomic growth. Transport links not only provide physical access to resources, but also \nenable  producers  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  in  domestic  and  foreign  markets, \nleading to economies of scale and specialization. \nAt  the grassroots level, local transport links\u2014whether provided by road, rail, or water \ntransport\u2014are  essential  if  local  communities  are  to  sell  their  produce  in  neighboring \nmarkets and purchase a range of manufactured goods with the proceeds. The existence of \nlocal transport links make possible specialization of production according to comparative \nadvantage and facilitate the emergence of a local and regional economy. In many areas of \narchipelagic Southeast Asia, poor roads and non-existent rail communications mean that \nsea or river transport is required to access local urban centers. \nSince poverty and isolation (the absence of basic transport services) are closely correlated, \nimproved  connectivity  is  a  necessary  condition  for  poverty  alleviation.  World  Bank \nexperience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia has shown that the provision of \nbasic access through all-weather roads contributes to the reduction of poverty in rural \nareas,  especially  when  combined  with  programs  for  socioeconomic  development. \nEconomic growth, made possible by the provision of improved transport links, contributes to ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  3 \npoverty  reduction  by  generating  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  by \nincreasing government capacity for income redistribution (Liu and Gannon 1999). \nThe  impact  of  improvements  in  connectivity  on  poverty  may  be  direct  or  indirect.\nConnectivity  has  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  where  improvements  in  transport  or \ncommunications create additional income and employment. The construction of an all-\nweather local road, a bridge linking two islands or the provision of a regular shipping \nservice where none existed before will lead to an expansion of employment opportunities in \nlocal industry. Transport improvements have an indirect impact when investment in a new \nfacility sets off a chain reaction that creates upstream or downstream employment benefits. \nFor  example,  port  privatization  coupled  with  improvements  in  local  roads  may  lower \ncontainer  movement  costs,  thereby  increasing  the  competitiveness  of  agricultural \nprocessing industries. While the indirect effects of transport improvements may be very \nimportant,  relatively  little  is  known  about  them  and  forecasting  their  scale  is  difficult. \nHowever, case studies of economic development suggest that there is considerable scope \nfor improvements in connectivity to play a direct role in poverty alleviation (Liu and Gannon, \n1999).\nImproved connectivity at a regional level widens the potential market available to local \nproducers,  providing  opportunities  to  specialize  in  agricultural  or  industrial  production \naccording to comparative or competitive advantage. The economies of scale generated \nmay enable firms to lower the unit price of their products and further widen their market. \nLinks between regional economies may develop within the borders of a country or between \nregions located in neighboring countries. \nIn a globalized world, efficient connections between the aSEA region and international \nmarkets are absolutely essential. Over the past two decades, the growth of global trade has \nconsistently outpaced the growth of world GDP. In developing countries in Asia, including \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, trade liberalization and the globalization of \nproduction have been the main drivers of economic growth. The aSEA region has also \nenjoyed an acceleration of economic growth as a result of globalization. \nThe  ASEAN  members  of  aSEA  experienced  a  period  of  economic  expansion  and \nunprecedented prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s, attributable to political stability, sound \nmacroeconomic management and an open international trading environment. Under the \nimpact of trade liberalization, internationally traded aSEA production increased more rapidly \nthan national income, the commodity composition of trade changed significantly, and major \nchanges took place in the pattern of trade flows. In particular, there has been a significant \nincrease  in  intra-Asia  trade  especially  between  ASEAN  countries  and  the  PRC.  Intra-\nASEAN trade has also increased significantly over the past two decades. \nSince the bulk of the aSEA region\u2019s international trade is carried by sea, access to high \nquality  international  shipping  services  is  of  paramount  importance.  In  an  increasingly \ncompetitive world, nations with access to efficient and reliable shipping services have a \ncompetitive advantage over those that are poorly served. In an ideal world, shipowners \nwould offer shippers relatively frequent services to a wide range of destinations, shipping \ncapacity would be matched to the volume of cargo available, the vessels employed would ", "4 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nbe as large as possible so as to benefit from economies of scale, transit times would be \nminimized, and freight rates would reflect the cost of providing the shipping service. \n4. Shipping Services and the Development of the \nMaritime Sector \nThe differing physical and commercial characteristics of commodities carried by sea have \nled to the emergence of specialist types of shipping. General cargo is carried on liner \nservices operated by cellular container or roll-on roll-off vessels. The hallmarks of a liner \nservice are regularity of sailings and diversity of cargoes carried. Bulk dry cargo, formerly \ncarried by tramp vessels which plied for hire and were typically employed carrying grain or \nore cargoes under voyage or time charters, is now carried almost exclusively by specialist \nbulk carriers. Bulk liquid cargoes (e.g., crude oil, refined oil, etc.) are carried by tankers. \n4.1 Demand for Maritime Transport in the aSEA Region \n4.1.1. Demand for Regional Container (General Cargo) Shipping Services \nDemand for regional container shipping services arises from several sources: \n(cid:2)  Services linking regional ports with other regional ports and/or the major cities of \nmember countries. Since most aSEA countries reserve their coastal shipping trades \nfor vessels owned and crewed by their nationals (i.e., they have adopted a policy of \ncabotage), overseas owned vessels are usually excluded from these trades; \n(cid:2)  Services linking regional ports in Country A with regional ports in Countries B, C \nand D. Typically, shipping services between regions located in different countries \nare provided by vessels beneficially owned by citizens of one of the countries or by \nvessels owned by third parties; \n(cid:2)  Services linking ports in Country A with major hub ports such as Singapore, \nPelabuhan Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) and Port Klang. \nTrade growth between the economically advanced ASEAN countries has been particularly \nrapid. As far as maritime trade is concerned, the largest trade flows are between Singapore, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The two-way exchange of products between Singapore \nand Malaysia is the most significant trade flow between ASEAN members, although a high \nproportion of this traffic is carried by road or rail. \nContainerized  cargoes  form  a  very  significant  share  of  intra-ASEAN  trade.  Many \ncommodities previously handled in bulk are now moving in containers. For example, while \nlarge shipments of low quality rice are still shipped in bulk or breakbulk form, premium \nquality  rice  is  now  packed  in  retail  packs  or  50kg  woven  poly  bags  and  shipped  in \ncontainers. Even exports of steel scrap are sometimes containerized. In short, there has ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  5 \nbeen a marked shift from bulk and breakbulk to containerized cargoes over the past twenty \nyears. Major commodities in the intra-ASEAN trades shipped in containers include \n(cid:2)  Agricultural products (e.g., rice, sugar, and beans); \n(cid:2)  Consumer products; \n(cid:2)  Raw materials (including palm oil); \n(cid:2)  Electrical and electronic products; and \n(cid:2)  Automotive components and some built-up cars (most built-up cars are shipped by \nspecialist car carriers). \nDemand patterns for regional container shipping services vary widely across the aSEA \nregion. For example, Brunei Darussalam does not have a developed manufacturing sector \nand relies heavily on imports of foodstuffs, manufactured goods, construction materials and \nchemicals.  While  the  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  imports  are  containerized,  Brunei \nDarussalam\u2019s exports are shipped in bulk, creating a problem of container repositioning for \nshipping companies. The Philippines also imports a wide variety of containerized consumer \ngoods and manufactures while containerized exports are limited. Over 90% of containers \nare exported empty. In contrast, Malaysia has a healthy two-way traffic in containerized \ncargoes, as does Singapore. The trading patterns of PNG and Timor-Leste do not generate \nlarge container flows to and from aSEA member economies. \nA substantial share of intra-aSEA trade is carried on vessels employed either in mainline \ntrades  or  on  intra-Asian  feeder  container  services.  In  times  of  relatively  low  demand, \nmainline carriers frequently carry intra-aSEA cargo on vessels employed in the Asia-Europe \nand trans-Pacific trades. However, during 2002\u20132008 the demand for space on long-haul \ncontainer services by Chinese exporters led to shortages of shipping space for intra-aSEA \ncargoes. Given the impact of the financial market crisis of 2008 on world trade, this problem \nmay have been resolved for the time being. \nDemand  for  shipping  services  between  the  less-developed  provinces  of  Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and the Philippines, as well as between the ASEAN members of aSEA and PNG \nand Timor-Leste, is very limited. Despite attempts at sub-regional cooperation such as \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, shipowners report difficulties in maintaining sufficient cargo to \nsustain regular services.  \n4.1.2. Demand for Mainline International Container Shipping Services \nSince the 1980s Asian newly industrializing countries have enjoyed rapid, export-oriented \neconomic growth, driven by Japanese firms choosing to move production offshore, by the \nquest  for  low-cost  production  in  Southeast  Asia  by  European  and  US  firms,  and  by \ndeclining US industrial competitiveness. As a result, the volume of manufactured goods \ncarried by sea has grown sharply. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade ", "6 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nand Development (UNCTAD), manufactures account for over 70 % of world merchandise \ntrade by value.2\nMaritime  trade  includes  consumption  goods  as  well  as  intermediate  goods,  parts  and \nsemifinished products. As much of this trade is carried in containers, world containerized \ntrade has grown significantly. As a major producer of manufactures, Asia has been at the \nforefront of this growth. \nThere are three major East-West container flows in the Northern Hemisphere: Asia-Europe; \nTrans-Pacific (linking Asia and North America); and Trans-Atlantic (linking Europe and North \nAmerica). According to UNCTAD estimates, the Asia-Europe trade\u2014with a total cargo flow \nof 27.7 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), of which 17.7 million TEU were shipped \non  the  dominant  leg  from  Asia  to  Europe\u2014overtook  the  Trans-Pacific  as  the  largest \ncontainerized trade lane in 2007. Container traffic on the Trans-Pacific totaled 20.23 million \nTEU in 2007, with 15.4 million TEU being carried on the dominant eastbound leg from Asia \nto North America. \nThe scale of container shipment on North-South trades (e.g., Australasia\u2013Northeast Asia, \nAustralasia\u2013Southeast Asia) is increasing but is much smaller than those in the East\u2013West \ntrades.\n4.1.3 Demand for Bulk and Breakbulk Shipping Services \nBulk shipping is conventionally sub-divided into dry bulk and tankers. Dry bulk vessels \nhandle cargoes of minerals and agricultural products. The tanker market includes crude oil \ncarriers, product carriers, liquid natural gas and Liquefied petroleum gas carriers. While \neconomies of scale in bulk shipping dictate the use of large vessels wherever possible, \nintra-aSEA bulk flows tend to be of limited size. As a result, the very large bulk carriers \nemployed in the carriage of iron ore and coal from Australia and Brazil to the PRC and \nJapan are not found in intra-aSEA trades. It was also noted that bulk shippers are now \nmoving to ship product in containers unless they have sufficient volume to justify using \nPanamax-sized vessels.3\nCommodities shipped in bulk or break-bulk form in the aSEA region include \n(cid:2)  Rubber (exports from Malaysia and Indonesia are shipped in break-bulk or \ncontainerized form to aSEA destinations and by bulk carrier to long-haul markets); \n(cid:2)  Palm oil (exported from Indonesia and Malaysia to the Philippines and Singapore in \nsmall 15,000-20,000dwt product tankers); \n(cid:2)  Sawn timber (shipped in bulk or break-bulk vessels from Indonesia and Malaysia to \n                                                           \n \n2   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). 2008. Review of Maritime Transport \n2008. New York and Geneva, United Nations, p. 8. \n3   The term \"Panamax\" refers to bulk carriers whose dimensions allow them to transit the Panama Canal. In \npractice, such vessels rarely exceed 70,000dwt (deadweight tonnage). ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  7 \nThailand, processed and exported in containers); \n(cid:2)  Rice (Thailand and Viet Nam ship government-purchased contract rice to Indonesia \nand the Philippines in relatively small 8,000-15,000dwt bulk carriers, while higher \nvalue varieties, e.g., jasmine rice, is packed in retail packs or 50kg woven poly bags \nand shipped in containers); \n(cid:2)  Oil, gas and petroleum products (Brunei Darussalam exports natural gas and oil to \nSingapore,  the  US,  Japan  and  South  Korea,  while  Indonesia  exports  oil  to \nMalaysia);\n(cid:2)  Coal (exports of Indonesian coal to the aSEA region, notably to Malaysia for electric \npower generation, are shipped in small bulk carriers 5,000\u201320,000dwt or barges \nwhile exports of Indonesian coal shipped further afield are carried in Capesize \nvessels); and \n(cid:2)  Cement and raw materials for fertilizer production (the Philippines imports cement \nand raw materials for fertilizer production from Thailand and Viet Nam in handy size \nbulk carriers). \nWhereas bulk carriers typically carry a single, homogeneous cargo (e.g., coal, iron ore, \nwheat), breakbulk vessels usually carry heterogeneous cargoes in parcel size lots. They \nmay also carry general and project cargoes. Breakbulk vessels are typically small in size, \nenabling them to service a wide range of ports, including private wharves and jetties. Such \nvessels carried a high proportion of intra-aSEA cargoes until the late 1960s. \nBreakbulk shipping survives in certain specialist trades. For example, logs and sawn timber \nas well as rubber are shipped in breakbulk from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Similarly, \nsome  rice  exports  from  Thailand  are  still  handled  by  breakbulk  vessels.  Interviews \nconducted in Thailand in 2004 suggested that low quality rice, exported in 50kg bags, is \nhand-stowed on board breakbulk vessels known as \"tween-deckers.\"4 It was noted that \nIndonesia imports between 600,000-1,000,000 tons of rice a year, mostly from Thailand and \nViet  Nam.  Raw  materials  for  the fertilizer industry are commonly shipped in breakbulk \nvessels as is coal destined for cement works in Thailand. \n4.2 Supply of Shipping Services in the aSEA Region \n4.2.1 Supply of Container Shipping Services \nSince  the  1980s,  shipowners  operating  in  the  major  East-West  container  trades  have \ndeveloped new types and patterns of shipping services to replace the former \"out-and-back\"\nservices between individual countries.5 These changes have been driven by the scale of \ncargo flows between the three major Northern Hemisphere cargo-generating regions, Asia, \nNorth America and Europe, as well as by economies of vessel size and the intensity of \ncompetition in container shipping markets.  \n                                                           \n \n4   See PDP/Meyrick. 2005. Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services. Final Report, \nThailand, March. \n5   Prior to containerization, cargo liners typically sailed from Country A to Country B, turned around and sailed \nback to Country A.   ", "8 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nThe need to offer a high quality service between major ports as well as maximize the \nutilization of slot capacity has led to the development of first tier \"round-the-world\" and \n\"pendulum\" services.6 These share a number of common features: the ships employed are \nlarge enough (4,500\u201310,000TEU) to benefit from economies of vessel size; port calls are \nlimited to regional hub ports or load centers; and cargoes to and from these hub ports are \ncarried by feeder container or secondary liner services. The emerging pattern of mainline \nand  feeder  services  is  analogous  with  the  \"hub-and-spoke\"  networks,  which  evolved \nfollowing the deregulation of US domestic aviation. Intense competition between the major \ncontainer  lines  operating  in  the  East\u2013West  trades  guarantees  freight  rates  reflect  cost \neconomies.\nIntense competition and economies of vessel size lie behind recent increases in the size of \ncontainer  ships.  Economies  of  vessel  size  arise  from  the  technical  characteristics  of \ncontainer shipping: the capital cost per container slot falls as vessel size increases, while \nthe ratio of crew to carrying capacity as well as the consumption of fuel per unit of cargo \ncarried  decline  as  vessel  size  increases.  Lloyd\u2019s  Maritime  Asia  has  estimated  the \nconstruction cost of a 6,000TEU containership is only 50% above that of a 3,000TEU \nvessel. The fuel consumption of the 6,000TEU vessel is 30% above that of the smaller \nvessel, while crew size is the same. The largest vessels currently employed in the Asia-\nEurope and trans-Pacific trades can carry around 10,000TEU. \nThe recognition that early container services tended to serve an excessive number of ports, \nthus increasing costs, led to attempts to minimize the number of ports of call by main line \nvessels. This led to the development of regional hubs or load centers such as Singapore, \nPort Klang, and PTP. The preferred hub port varies between shipping lines. The volume of \ntransshipment  cargo  available,  the  cost  of  using  a  port\u2019s  facilities  and  the  level  of  its \nproductivity (containers handled per hour) each enter into the equation when a line chooses \na hub port. Singapore remains the major hub for aSEA traffic. However, during the past \ndecade Malaysian ports\u2014especially Port Klang and PTP\u2014have challenged Singapore\u2019s hub \nstatus. CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd have chosen to focus their Southeast Asian services on \nPort Klang, relying on the volume of transshipment cargo flowing into Port Klang from \nPeninsular Malaysia, which tends to be routed via Port Klang rather than Singapore.7 Three \nmajor container shipping operators\u2014Maersk, Sealand, and Evergreen\u2014used their market \npower in defecting from Singapore to PTP in 2002\u20132003.8 APL and Yang Ming remain \nwedded  to  Singapore,  arguing  that  the  volume  of  transshipment  cargo  available  over \nSingapore is the crucial determinant in their choice of hub port. \nIn addition to major Round-the-World and Pendulum services operated by large container \nvessels, second-tier container services, operated by vessels appreciably smaller than those \n                                                           \n \n6   Pendulum services are usually operated by vessels too large to transit the Panama Canal.

Such \nvessels incur higher costs per container. However, the marketing advantage gained by \noffering direct calls, rather than an indirect service via a major hub port, may offset the \nhigher costs of operation. Within the aSEA region, such services not only call at the regional \nhubs but at other major regional ports such as Tanjung Priok (Jakarta), Manila, Laem \nChebang and Bangkok. \n4.2.2 Supply of Regional Shipping Services \nAt the regional level, the quality of shipping services varies markedly depending on the \ndegree of development of the region in question and the extent to which production in a \ngiven region is export-oriented. \nMost  aSEA  ports  serving  export-oriented  regions  receive  relatively  frequent  shipping \nservices. As noted above, the intra-ASEAN trades have expanded rapidly over the past \ntwenty years. Many vessels employed in these trades are feeder vessels.9\nThe  range  of  container  shipping  services  operating  exclusively  between  aSEA  ports  is \nlimited. Shipowners interviewed in Malaysia and Thailand in 2004\u20132005 argued that cargo \nvolumes were insufficient to make intra-aSEA or intra-ASEAN services profitable on a stand-\nalone basis. The scale of cargo movements between Northeast and Southeast Asia (and \nvice versa) makes it more profitable to operate services from the PRC to Southeast or South \nAsian ports, calling at one or more aSEA ports en route. \nTable 2 (page 36) shows the number of direct container services between the various \nmembers of aSEA. The table includes First and Second Tier services, Asian feeder and \nintra-aSEA services. It provides a measure of maritime connectivity across the aSEA region. \nNote that the pattern of container services in Southeast Asia is highly complex, a result of \nthe number of competing shipping companies as well as the fact that many shipping lines \noffer several service \"strings\" on a given route, i.e., services with different patterns of port \ncalls. The table highlights the importance of Singapore and Malaysia as regional hubs for \ncontainer shipping.  \nShipping services connecting the less developed regions of aSEA suffer by comparison. For \nexample,  while  relatively  frequent  container  shipping  services  connect  ports  along  the \ncoasts of East Malaysia and Brunei with Southeast Asia\u2019s major hub ports, Singapore, Port \nKlang and PTP, shipping services between Philippine ports within the BIMP-EAGA region \nand their counterparts in Indonesia, East Malaysia and Brunei are infrequent or non-existent. \nTable 3 (page 36) shows feeder container services operating between Port Klang/Singapore\nand ports in East Malaysia and Brunei. Such services not only carry cargo between regional \nports, but cargo from East Malaysia and Brunei to/from Singapore or Peninsular Malaysia, \nas well as transshipment cargo to/from East Malaysia and Europe. The number of operators \n                                                           \n \n9   In 2007, it was found that more containers were shipped in intra-ASEAN trades (42 million TEU) than in other \nmajor trades.", "10 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nand the frequency of sailings suggest substantial two-way cargo movement. It was noted \nthat a number of container ports, including Bintulu and Sandakan, aspire to achieve regional \nhub status. \nSimilarly, a number of Indonesian ports, including some within BIMP-EAGA, are within the \nhinterland of Singapore and Port Klang. They too benefit from relatively frequent sailings by \nfeeder container vessels. It was found that Philippine ports within the BIMP-EAGA region \ntend to be served by Filipino domestic shipping services rather than being part of the \nregional container feeder system hubbing on Singapore or Port Klang. \n4.2.3 Poor Connectivity on \"Thin\" Regional Routes \nInfrequent maritime connections between less developed regions of aSEA countries have \ndiscouraged economic development. For example, shipping services between Philippine \nports and member provinces of BIMP-EAGA in Indonesia, East Malaysia and Brunei, are \nunsatisfactory. While roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) ferry services between Zamboanga (Philippines) \nand  Sandakan  (Malaysia)  are  operated  by  two  Zamboanga-city  based  companies  i.e., \nAleson Shipping Lines and Sampaguita Shipping, the ferry service between General Santos \nCity (Philippines) and Bitung (Indonesia) has been suspended. Similarly, PNG and Timor-\nLeste  have  poor  maritime  connectivity  with  ASEAN  members  of  aSEA.  The  only \ncontainerized service linking Timor-Leste with the other members of aSEA is the Perkins \nservice between Darwin-Dili-Singapore. \"Thin\" cargo flows on regional shipping routes have \ndiscouraged entrepreneurs from opening new routes or purchasing new equipment. \nThe development of maritime economic corridors (MECs) can address the issue of poor \nconnectivity  on  \u201cthin\u201d  regional  routes.  The  corridor  development  concept  hinges  on  an \nevolution from transport corridors, to trade corridors, to corridors where many dimensions of \neconomic development are taken into account. In a maritime setting, such corridors can \nintegrate  highly  scattered  island  economies  with  multiple  economic,  social  and  even \nenvironmental  benefits.  In  archipelagic  nations  such  as  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines, \nMECs can be domestic but most likely will have a bigger impact when crossing borders.\nMECs  in  aSEA  revolve  around  Ro-Ro  vessels,  associated  port  facilities,  roads  and \nsupporting  policies  and  regulations,  as  has  been  successfully  implemented  in  the \nPhilippines  (see  Box).  The  Philippine  approach  and  experience  warrants  serious \nconsideration  for  the  aSEA  region  as  a  whole.  On  the  supply  side,  it  has  the  great \nadvantage that large upfront capital investments are not needed. Hence, the entire system \ncan be built in a gradual and modular fashion, including port facilities and road connections. \nHowever, what is more important in this case is the introduction of effective policies and \nregulations to support maritime economic corridor development. In terms of impact, MECs \nwill significantly boost economic activity by linking small island economies into the wider \nregional  transport  networks,  substantially  lowering  transport  and  associated  transaction \ncosts, thereby encouraging more trade and traffic between adjacent islands. \nA detailed analysis of the potential benefits of MECs, however, is beyond the scope of this \npaper. Briefly, such benefits include an increase in economic opportunities, direct benefits \nfor the poor in terms of lower transport costs (economic and social) and better market ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  11 \naccess, concentration of development along corridors thereby achieving economies of scale \nand more efficient land use, and access to a wider variety of good and services. ", "12 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nBox: Marine Economic Corridor applied in the Philippines \nIn the Philippines, the Strong Republic Nautical Highway is a prime example of a successful MEC. Prior to \n2005, Ro-Ro services did exist in the Philippines, but they were hampered by regulatory restrictions. Only \nafter  the  government  introduced  policies  to  promote  the  nautical highway, supported with appropriate \nregulations and presidential orders, did the concept take off. The system consists of 3 north-south corridors \nsupported with a number of lateral links: \n(cid:2)  The Western Nautical Highway, already operational, links Luzon to Mindanao by way of the major \nislands of Mindoro, Panay, Guimaras and Negros, with the port of Batangas serving as the gateway to \nVisayas and Mindanao; \n(cid:2)  The Eastern Nautical Highway, also known as the Pan Philippine Highway and mostly completed, links \nthe islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao, with Surigao City serving as the gateway to \nMindanao; and \n(cid:2)  The Central Nautical Highway, the last of the highways to be developed, links Luzon with Misbate, \nCebu, and Bohol, with the port of Balingoan (Misamis Oriental) acting as the gateway to Mindanao. \nA major benefit of the Nautical Highway lies in improved local connectivity for the islands along each of the \nroutes. For example, prior to the development of the Western Nautical Highway, the island of Mindoro had \nextremely poor shipping links to the Visayas (Panay and Guimaras). There was very  little cargo and \npassenger traffic southbound from Mindoro, almost all traffic being northbound from Mindoro to Luzon \n(Basilico, 2008). \nAlthough the Western Nautical Highway has only been in existence for five years a number of benefits have \nalready become apparent:\n(cid:2) Reduced Transport Costs. A 2006 study conducted by the Center for Research and Communication \nsuggests that the Western Nautical Highway has substantially reduced transport costs. \n(cid:2) Changes in Patterns of Freight and Passenger Movements. The reduction in transport costs coupled \nwith the efficiency and flexibility of the Nautical Highway has led to a shift in the way shippers transport \ntheir goods. For example, Nestl\u00e9 Philippines now chooses to make small, frequent and direct deliveries \nto its clients, using the Nautical Highway where appropriate. As a result, the company has closed 33 of \nits 36 distribution centers. Similarly, whereas bus operators tended to serve either the northern or the \nsouthern section of the route between Luzon and Mindanao prior to the existence of the Nautical \nHighway, some bus operators now choose to operate through buses from Manila to destinations in \nMindanao.\n(cid:2) Increases in Agricultural Productivity. The opening of the Western Nautical Highway has created new \nmarkets for farmers (Basilo, 2008). For example, farmers in San Jose (Occidental Mindoro) who used to \nsell onions and other agricultural produce to Manila now have the option of shipping their products \nsouthwards into Panay, Negros and Mindanao. Fruits such as mangosteen and durian grown in Davao \nare able to be marketed in Iloilo and Bacolod. Such developments enable farmers to increase their \nacreage and production, with benefits to agricultural productivity. \n(cid:2) Enhanced Investment. Over the period 2003\u201306, investment in Roxas is estimated to exceed P100 \nmillion. This is said to have generated over 2,000 jobs and to have increased business and property tax \ncollections. Similarly, investment boomed following the development of the Port of Danqay. Basilo \nsuggests that a year after the port became operational, substantial commercial development\u2014appliance \nstores, retail outlets, drugstores, restaurants, banks and transport terminals\u2014was evident. The number \nof petrol stations increased from two to seven. By 2006, 879 business establishments operated in the \nmunicipality, a 15% increase over the number for 2005. \n(cid:2) Enhanced Tourism Potential. Until recently the potential for tourism along the Philippines western \nseaboard was constrained by poor transport links. The introduction of Ro-Ro services between Luzon-\nMindoro and Mindoro-Pasay has stimulated tourist traffic. Dangay Port in Roxas (Mindoro Occidental) \nhas developed as a point of departure for the Boracay Islands, while Caticlan serves as a jumping off \npoint to Panay Island. Over the period 2003-06 tourist receipts on Boracay grew by more than 50%, in \nIloilo by 30%, in Bacolod by 15% and in Dapitan by 200%. ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  13 \n \n4.2.4 Supply of Local Shipping Services \nThe types of vessel employed in local trades vary widely across the aSEA region, depending \non local custom, depth of water available and the nature of port facilities. At the most basic \nlevel, vessels may have to be loaded and unloaded directly on to a beach. In other cases, \nprimitive wharf facilities may be provided, although mechanical cargo handling equipment is \nrarely available. In the aSEA region, rivers and estuaries are often shallow due to silting, \nmandating the use of shallow draft vessels. Typically, small sailing or motor vessels collect \nexport cargoes from coastal villages for consolidation in regional ports, a process commonly \nreferred to as coastal accumulation. In Indonesia, the prahu shipping sector performs this \ntask. Until recently most prahus were sailing vessels.Since the 1970s, motor vessels have \nsteadily replaced sailing vessels. The largest of the vessels now employed, the prahu pinisi, \nrarely carry the traditional two-masted rig. Similarly many so-called auxiliary sailing vessels \n(prahu layar motor) are now for all intents and purposes motor vessels. The sails are merely \na decoration to avoid the more stringent manning and seaworthiness requirements for motor \nvessels (Dick, 1987). \nThe prahu sector is an important segment of Indonesian coastal shipping. Official estimates \nsuggest that the sector had a 14% share of inter-island trade. The importance of the sector \nappears  to  be  much  greater  than  official  statistics  would  suggest.  Unofficial  estimates \nsuggest that the tonnage carried by the prahu sector is understated by at least a half and \nperhaps by as much as two-thirds. \nInterviews  conducted  in  Malaysia  and  Thailand  in  2004\u20132005  suggest  that  traditional \nshipping services, employing small motor vessels, tug and barge, sailing craft and junks, still \nflourish in Southeast Asia, The vessels employed are small enough to use local ports or \nprivate wharves. Many of the vessels are Indonesian-owned and employed in what are \nknown as barter trades. Vessels employed in these trades typically carry a range of cargoes \nfrom Indonesia (forest products, charcoal, coal or coke), unload at a Malaysian or Thai port, \nsell the cargo and purchase a back-loading cargo of foodstuffs, beverages or manufactures.  \nOn  one  visit  to  the  breakbulk  wharf  at  Port  Klang  (Southpoint),  a  junk  was unloading \ncharcoal from Sumatra. The owner intended to purchase cases of Coca-Cola as back-\nloading  for  Sumatra.  While  most  of  these  cargoes  are  cleared  by  customs,  the \nheterogeneous nature of the cargoes means that it is difficult to develop an accurate picture \nof the trade from available customs records. \n4.2.5 Supply of Bulk and Breakbulk Shipping Services \nHistorically, the intra-Asian bulk trades have been heavily dependent on small handy-sized \nbulk carriers. In this highly fragmented market, two Thai companies\u2014Precious Shipping ", "14 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nand Thoresen Thai Agencies\u2014have emerged as specialist operators of handy-sized bulk \ncarriers.10\nDuring the past decade many small bulk carriers have been scrapped and owners have \nbeen reluctant to order replacement tonnage. As a result freight rates for handy-sized bulk \ncarriers have risen sharply. In turn, high freight rates have encouraged shippers to switch to \ncontainers unless they generate sufficient cargo volumes to use larger Panamax sized bulk \ncarriers.\n5. Maritime Infrastructure: Adequacy and Efficiency \nof Ports \n5.1 The Port Task \nPorts  are  the  gateways  through  which  maritime  trade  must  pass.  If  a  port\u2019s physical \ninfrastructure is inadequate and/or if it is operationally inefficient, the costs incurred by \nshipping lines will be higher than necessary, forcing them to increase charges for handling \nimports and exports. As a result, trade growth will suffer and regional economic growth will \nbe somewhat more constrained than would otherwise be the case. \nPorts require a large number of specialist tasks and players. While the provision of wharves \nand cargo handling areas are of central importance, ports also require dredged channels, \nnavigation aids, pilots, towage services, stevedoring services, customs clearance facilities, \nand  an  efficient  interface  with  land  transport. Typically  such  services  are  provided  by \ndifferent agents, some in the public and some in the private sector. Ownership and intensity \nof competition in the provision of such services differ greatly. \nThe archipelagic nature of the aSEA region means that countries\u2014with the exception of \nBrunei Darussalam, Singapore and Timor-Leste\u2014require many ports. Typically, a handful of \nports  owned  and  operated  by  government  or  government-linked  corporations  handle \ninternational deep-sea container traffic. Secondary ports, owned by national or provincial \ngovernments,  are  served  by  shipping  lines  operating  near-sea  regional  and  domestic \nshipping services. \nEven a brief review of each aSEA port is beyond the scope of this paper. Fortunately, \nASEAN has listed the ports that member nations consider to be of significance to the \ndevelopment of the intra-ASEAN trade (see Table 4, page 38). Almost all ports listed in Table \n4 handle container and general cargo and a significant proportion of them have common \nuser facilities for bulk dry cargoes. Table 4 also shows the inland connectivity of the ports: \nthe road, rail and inland waterway connections to and from each port. It was found that rail \nand inland waterway connectivity were limited. The limited inland waterway connectivity was \na surprising finding given the archipelagic nature of Southeast Asia. \n                                                           \n \n10  Hand, M. 2008.

", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  15 \n5.2 Container Ports \nContainer handling facilities within the ASEAN countries have had to adapt to changes in \nthe size and nature of container vessels as well as changing service patterns. By the mid- \n1980s, containerization had been almost universally adopted on main line trades.11 The \nsubsequent growth of trade flows, the employment of larger vessels on mainline trades, \nand the emergence of new service patterns in both mainline and feeder trades have had \nimportant implications for ASEAN ports.  \nNot  surprisingly,  port  investment  undertaken  in  the early phase of containerization has \nproved inadequate and facilities have had to be expanded. While some ports have met \nthese  challenges  successfully,  others  have  been  slower  to  react  to  the  changing \nenvironment (Trace, 1997). Table 5 (page 39) shows the container volumes handled by \nmajor aSEA ports over the period 2000\u20132008. \nThe efficiency of container ports in the aSEA region varies widely. The region\u2019s major hub \nports\u2014Singapore, Port Klang and PTP\u2014are highly efficient by world standards. However, \nthe  productivity  achieved  in  the  region\u2019s  other  main  ports\u2014Bangkok,  Laem  Chebang, \nJakarta, and Manila\u2014is of a lower order. In general, productivity in regional ports suffers as \na result of inadequate investment and poor management. \nWithin the ASEAN region, the pivotal position of the Port of Singapore has been maintained \nover the past decade despite intense competition from Malaysian ports. Singapore is the \naSEA region's main transshipment port. While the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) does \nnot publish the number of transshipment containers handled, it was estimated that between \n60 and 70 per cent of containers handled may be for transshipment (Robinson, 1991). This \nwould suggest that between 16.7 to 19.5 million of the 2007 container throughput of 27.9 \nmillion should be classified as transshipment cargo. Typically achieving 100-110 container \nmoves per hour (MPH), port productivity in Singapore is high by world standards. \nSingapore's dominant position depends on continuing efforts on the part of the government \nand the PSA to create and sustain the port's competitive advantage. The efficiency with \nwhich containers are handled and the cost-effectiveness of shipping cargo via Singapore \ncombine to create a service that is qualitatively different from that offered by other ports in \nthe region. The continuing growth of container throughput has made it necessary to further \ndevelop container handling facilities. By 2004, Singapore\u2019s four main container terminals \n(Tanjong Pagar, Keppel, Brani, and Pasir Panjang) had reached capacity. An additional three \nberths were commissioned at Pasir Panjang Terminal (PPT) in 2005 and a further five berths \nin 2006. With the addition of further berths at PPT, Singapore\u2019s container handling capacity \nwill increase to 31 million TEU by 2011.12\n                                                           \n \n11   By the late 1990s containerization had been widely, though not exclusively, adopted in secondary trades, \nincluding those serving low labour cost developing economies. \n12  See Neil Dekker, Well prepared, Containerisation International, July 2005.

In 1993, the Malaysian government declared Port Klang to be the \nnational load centre (i.e., the major Malaysian gateway for imports and exports). However, it \nis the development of PTP that has posed a more serious competitive threat to Singapore. It \nwas noted that prior to the expansion of Port Klang and the development of PTP, around \n90%  of  Malaysian  cargo  was  handled  by  Singapore.  Subsequently,  the  Malaysian \ngovernment  introduced  measures  actively  encouraging  Malaysian  shippers  to  use \nMalaysian ports, including a doubling of duties on laden trucks leaving Malaysia. In the two \nmain Malaysian ports, as in Singapore, container handling rates are high. For example, PTP \nachieves approximately 100 to 110 MPH which is similar to that of Singapore. \nIn contrast, Indonesia\u2019s ports are characterized by relatively poor turnaround times and \ninefficient work practices. Jakarta\u2019s International Container Terminal (JICT) was found to be \none of the least efficient of the region\u2019s main terminals, judged by productivity and unit costs \n(Ray, 2003). Jakarta\u2019s container handling rate in mid-2008 was 40-45 MPH, less than half \nthe rate achieved in Singapore and PTP.13 A recent USAID/Senada study finds that the entire \nport system is highly inefficient and in urgent need of upgrading (based on performance \nindicators for all the major commercial ports).14\nPort  performance  data  for  19  regional  container  ports  in  Indonesia  suggest  that  berth \noccupancy  rates  are  high  by  international  standards,  leading  to  berthing  delays  and \nexcessive  waiting  time,  while  average  turnaround  time  is  high.  Working  time  as  a \npercentage  of  turnaround  time  is  high. As  the  USAID/Senada  study  observed  that  the \nIndonesian  cargo  fleet  is  spending  too  much  time  sitting  idle  or  waiting  at  ports. The \ncomparatively poor performance of Indonesia\u2019s commercial port system is usually attributed \nto the following reasons: \n(cid:2)  Geographic constraints: Indonesia has few natural deep-water harbors and a river \nsystem prone to serious siltation that restricts port depth; \n(cid:2)  Lack of port infrastructure: Many regional ports lack container handling equipment \nsuch  as  gantry  cranes  and  straddle  trucks,  forcing  shipping  lines  to  employ \nexpensive self-geared vessels. The USAID/Senada study notes long delays in some \nregional ports, notably Panjang in Lampung and Belawan in North Sumatra, caused \nby breakdowns in container handling equipment; \n(cid:2)  Work practices: Many ports operate on a one-shift basis. As the USAID/Senada \nstudy  notes,  \"\u2026the  manner  in  which  labor  is  used...effectively  institutionalizes \nunder-utilization  of  port  facilities  and  limits  the  potential  for  efficiency \nimprovements\"15;\n                                                           \n \n13  Note however that the container terminals at Jakarta typically operate 2-3 cranes per vessel, while Singapore \nand PTP load and unload using 3-5 cranes per vessel.

The main container \nterminals  in  Manila\u2014South  Harbor  (ATI)  and  MICT  (International  Container  Terminal \nServices Incorporated)\u2014compete for custom. Crane rates at these terminals, 25\u201330 moves \nper hour (MPH) at MICT and up to 20MPH at ATI, while lower than the rates achieved in \nSingapore and PTP are higher than those in Indonesia. \nThe overriding port development problem for Thailand in the 1970s and 1980s lay in the \nadequacy of Bangkok\u2019s East Quay (Klong Toey) wharves to handle an increasing volume of \ntrade coupled with the timing of the construction of alternative deep-water facilities on the \nGulf  of  Thailand.  This  policy  dilemma  intensified  following  containerization.  Container \nfacilities at Klong Toey could handle only feeder vessels and space behind the wharves was \nlimited,  a  serious  deficiency  for  a  port  in  which  90 % of containers were packed and \nunpacked within the port boundaries. Given the port's proximity to metropolitan Bangkok, \nroads leading to the port were extremely congested.16\nA 1978 World Bank study noted that Klong Toey would only be able to handle the growth of \ntraffic  until  1990.  Thereafter  Thailand  would  require  a  deep-water  port  on  the  Gulf  of \nThailand. In July 1983, the Eastern Seabord Development Committee formally approved the \nconstruction of new ports at Mab Ta Phut and Laem Chabang. \nOpened in 1991, Laem Chebang handled 4.6 million TEU by 2007. The development of the \nport  has  been  accelerated  by  a  government  decision  limiting  container  throughput  at \nBangkok to 1 million TEU per annum. In recent years, Laem Chebang has attracted calls by \ncarriers serving mainline trades as well as calls by feeder container vessels. For example, \nCMA CGMs Asia India-Middle East service, employing 2,500TEU vessels, makes direct calls \nat Laem Chebang, while APL began direct sailings between Laem Chebang and Karachi in \nApril 200817. Laem Chebang\u2019s aspirations to become a major hub port are unlikely to be \nrealized as the port lies some distance from major shipping routes between Southeast and \nNortheast Asia. The cost of diverting large container vessels is likely to outweigh the benefits \nof port calls at Laem Chebang.18\nContainer handling rates in Port Moresby in PNG and Dili in Timor-Leste are low by aSEA \nstandards.

Improvement works at the port, including wharf extension, \nwere undertaken by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, with $5.7 million of bilateral \naid from Japan. \n5.3 Bulk and Breakbulk Ports \nMost ports mentioned above possess bulk as well as container handling facilities. Bulk and \nbreakbulk ports may be divided into common user facilities and purpose built bulk ports \nassociated with and often developed by a particular firm or industry. The aSEA countries do \nnot possess the large scale bulk handling facilities that characterize Australian, Brazilian and \nSouth African coal and iron ore export ports as well as their Japanese and Chinese import \ncounterparts. As noted above, bulk shipments to and from the aSEA region tend to be \ncarried in handy-sized bulkers. More recently, Panamax vessels have been introduced into a \nlimited number of trades. \nAlthough Singapore is predominantly a container port, it handles breakbulk and specialized \ncargoes through its multi-purpose terminals at Pasir Panjang and Sembawang, while bulk \ncargoes are handled by dedicated facilities at Jurong Port. Pasir Panjang and Sembawang \nwharves handle about 20 million tons of break bulk and specialized cargoes annually. Pasir \nPanjang wharves have dedicated ro-ro and car carrier facilities. Dry and liquid bulk cargoes \nare handled by Jurong Port. \nSimilarly,  Port  Klang has  both  container  and  bulk  handling  facilities.19  The  North  Port, \nWestport and Southpoint facilities all have dry bulk berths. Berths No. 24 and No. 25 at \nNorthport  can  handle  vessels  of  45,000dwt  with  a  draught of 11m. The berths handle \nfertilizer, sugar, maize, feed meal and cement imports as well as palm kernel exports. Berth \nNo. 4 at Southpoint handles bulk cargoes of wheat, maize and feed meal. Westport has \nthree dry bulk terminals: \n(cid:2) DB1 Terminal has two 200m berths allowing vessels with a draught of 14.4m to be \nhandled. This terminal has two gantry grab unloaders capable of discharging 2,000 \ntons/hour. \n(cid:2) DB2 Westport Slag Terminal has a 250m berth capable of handling vessels of 3.5m \ndraught. This terminal handles fertilizer, silica, sand and slag. \n(cid:2) Westport Cement Terminal can accommodate vessels of up to 35,000dwt with a \ndraught of 11m. \nPrivate  jetty/terminal  development  in  the  Chao  Praya  River  (Bangkok)  was  driven  by \n                                                           \n \n19  For further details see: PDP/Meyrick, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, \nFinal Report, Malaysian Country Report, March 2005.

Vessels using these ports may need to be self-geared. \nAs a result, loading and discharging tend to be slow, congestion delays are common and \ncargo handling costs are higher than the need be. \nAs far as barter trades are concerned, there is a lack of investment in Port Klang\u2019s Southport \n(now called Southpoint). This port specializes in handling barter trade between Indonesia \nand Malaysia (normally carried in small motorized coastal vessels, junks and landing craft). \nSuch minor trades tend to be invisible to the authorities and are in danger of being crowded \nout, physically and financially. Physically, the importance of providing adequate facilities for \nthe container and major bulk trades may result in a diminution of the space available for \nminor trades. Financially, investment in facilities for barter trades is not attractive to major \nport  operators  (such  as  DP  World  and  PSA).

Maritime Policies \n6.1 Shipping Policies \nASEAN as an institution was a relatively late convert to the benefits of liberalization of \nshipping markets. This is understandable given that a reasonably open market for shipping \nservices  to,  from,  and  within  ASEAN  had already existed by the late 1990s. With the \nexception  of  cabotage  limitations,  ASEAN  (and  non-ASEAN)  shipowners  faced  few \nrestrictions regarding the routes on which they could operate or the cargoes they could \ncarry.\nThe major ASEAN initiative in the maritime area is the Roadmap Towards an Integrated and \nCompetitive Maritime Transport in ASEAN.20 Recognizing that the ASEAN countries are at \ndifferent  stages  in  economic  development  and  have  differing  factor  endowments,  the \nRoadmap develops a set of principles rather than focusing on clear-cut goals. ASEAN \ncountries accepting the Roadmap commit themselves to: \n(cid:2) Foster competition in shipping markets; \n(cid:2) Adhere  to  the  principle  of  free  competition  on  a  commercial  basis  for  cargo \nmovements to from or between ASEAN countries; \n(cid:2) Prevent or minimize the imposition of unjustifiable fees, surcharges or imposts by \nshipping lines or associations of shipping lines with a dominant position in any trade \nto from or within ASEAN; \n(cid:2) Ensure  that  any  international  shipping  operations  retained  under  government \nownership are corporatized and operated in accordance with commercial principles; \n(cid:2) Refrain  from  providing  preferential  access  to  routes,  cargoes  or  contracts  to \ngovernment-owned  lines,  and  to  adopt  a  timetable  for  the  removal  of  such \npreferences where they currently exist; \n(cid:2) Work collectively and progressively towards the development of a single integrated \nASEAN shipping market; and \n(cid:2) Develop guiding principles for the provision of port services based on the cost of \nservice and infrastructure provision. \nIn the absence of leadership from ASEAN, liberalization of shipping policies has taken place \non a country-by-country basis, with notable differences in the policy stance of individual \naSEA  members.  In  some  aSEA  countries,  shipping  policies  have  been  the  subject  of \nconsiderable debate and careful formulation while in some others, they have developed \npolicies  on  an  ad  hoc,  spur-of-the-moment  basis.  The  government  of  the  Philippines \nconsciously  set  out  to  accelerate  the  development  of  its  maritime  industry.  Under \nPresidential Decree 474 (Maritime Industry Decree), the government sought to enhance the \ncompetitive position of Philippine flag vessels operating in foreign trades; strengthen the \nbalance  of  payments  by  increasing  the  inflow  of  foreign  exchange;  and  generate  job \n                                                           \n \n20  See ASEAN Secretariat, Roadmap Towards an Integrated and Competitive Maritime Transport in ASEAN, \n2006.The Roadmap furthers the goals enunciated in the Vientiane Action Programme (2004\u201310) and the \nASEAN Transport Action Plan (2005\u201310).

Similarly, Malaysia has a long-standing and systematic program designed to \nencourage the growth of the Malaysian fleet. In contrast, PNG and Timor-Leste have poorly \narticulated shipping policies. \n6.1.2 Coastal Shipping Policy (Cabotage) \nMost  aSEA  members  currently  reserve  their  coastal  trades  for  domestic  shipping.  For \nexample, Indonesia's regulation PP17(1988) reserves coastal trades for Indonesian flag \nvessels, provides operating subsidies for vessels used on selected inter-island routes, and \nrequires that crews be Indonesian citizens.21 Indonesia\u2019s cabotage policy does not appear to \nhave  been  effective  in  reserving  domestic  cargoes  for  Indonesian  owned  and  flagged \nvessels. It was estimated that foreign flag vessels carried 52% of coastal tonnage in 1997 \ncompared to 35% in 1985.22\nPNG coastal shipping is reserved for PNG-owned and registered vessels.23 The Merchant \nShipping Act (1980) gives the power to grant a license to a person to engage in the coastal \ntrade. A coastal trading license may only be granted to: the owner of the ship or the \ncharterer of the ship. Ships registered under the Act may be granted a license for a period of \n8 years. Where no ship is available to provide a particular shipping service or where a ship \nholding a license operates a service that is deemed inadequate, inefficient or unreasonably \ncostly,  a  coastal  trading  permit  to  an  unregistered  vessel  and/or  a  vessel  registered \noverseas could be issued. \nSimilarly, Malaysia\u2019s Cabotage Act (1980) requires all vessels employed in coastal trades, \nincluding vessels trading between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia, to be licensed by \nthe Domestic Shipping Licensing Board (DSLB). The DSLB grants three types of licenses: \n(cid:2)  Unconditional (permanent) licenses are granted to Malaysian-owned and registered \nvessels with 100% Malaysian crews.\n(cid:2)  Conditional (temporary) licenses are granted to vessels meeting some, but not all, of \nthese conditions. \n(cid:2)  Temporary licenses are granted to foreign operators when there is inadequate capacity \nin the coastal trades. \nThe  Merchant  Shipping  (Amendment  and  Extension)  Act  (1984)  contains  exemption \nprovisions that have, in fact, led to a relaxation of cabotage restrictions. These were invoked \nin  1994  to  allow  foreign-flagged  vessels  to  carry  transshipment  cargoes  between  the \nMalaysian ports of Penang and Port Klang, and extended to cover transshipment cargo \nbetween Penang, Johor and Port Klang in 1997. The exemptions were designed to enhance \n                                                           \n \n21  See PDP/Meyrick & Associates, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, \nIndonesia Country Report, Final Report, March 2005, p. 2. \n22  See Containerisation International, September 1997. \n23  See Pacific Island Forum Secretariat, Review and Analysis of Forum Island Country Shipping Regulations, \n2001.", "22 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nPort Klang\u2019s position as a hub port and have since been extended to support the emerging \nhub of PTP. \nGiven the imbalances in cargo flows in the aSEA region, there would appear to be efficiency \ngains available if the coastal trades of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand \nwere opened up to greater competition. \n6.1.3 Ship Registration and Ship Ownership \nThe governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand invested \nin the development of national merchant fleets in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s, \nSoutheast Asian countries were concerned with the power wielded by foreign shipping \ncompanies organized into shipping conferences.24 Freight rates in trades such as Asia-\nEurope were considered excessive and the introduction of containerization appeared likely \nto enhance conference power25. Southeast Asian countries were also concerned about the \nforeign exchange outflows required to pay for shipping services provided by predominantly \nforeign owners. \nIn this light, Malaysia established the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC) \nin 1968. A major reason for the establishment of MISC was the perception that the Far \nEastern Freight Conference had a stranglehold over trade. Malaysia established a second \nnational  line,  Perbadanan  National  Shipping  Lines  in  1982  to  assist  in  developing  a \nbalanced  and  diversified  fleet.  Similarly,  Thailand  has  a  clearly  articulated  policy  of \ndeveloping a national fleet.\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, the inefficiencies of state-owned shipping had become \nself-evident, as had the fact that government ownership tended to distort shipping markets. \nASEAN governments now moved to privatize government-owned lines. For example, MISC \nwas listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 1997, although the government remains \nthe major shareholder. Singapore\u2019s national shipping line, Neptune Orient Line (has been \nprivatized  and  is  listed  on  the  Singapore  Stock  Exchange.  The  commercialization  of \ngovernment shipping operations is generally considered to have led to improved operating \nefficiency and reduced distortions in shipping markets. \nCurrently, aSEA countries differ in the degree of openness of their ship registries. For \nexample, a vessel on the Philippine register must be owned by citizens or permanent \nresidents of the Philippines. If it is owned by a corporation, at least 60% of the subscribed \ncapital must be provided by Filipino citizens. Similarly, under Malaysia's Merchant Shipping \n                                                           \n \n24  Shipping conferences are associations of shipowners serving a particular trade, formed for the purpose of \ncontrolling capacity and raising freight rates above levels that would prevail in a more competitive \nenvironment.\n25\n  The capital cost of container vessels, the cost of containers themselves, as well as wharf cranes, fork-lift \ntrucks etc., were beyond the reach of most shipping companies. As a result, hitherto competing shipping \ncompanies formed container consortia to spread the costs. For instance, a trade served by a dozen shipping \ncompanies prior to containerization, might be served by only two or three container consortia. ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  23 \nOrdinance (1952), a vessel must be 51% owned by Malaysian interests to be eligible to fly \nthe national flag. Greater flexibility in the requirements for vessel registration by number of \naSEA countries has enabled national shipowners to achieve cost reductions without resort \nto flagging out. \n6.1.4 Application of Competition Policy to Liner Shipping \nIn general, aSEA countries\u2014unlike developed western economies such as the US and \nAustralia\u2014have not attempted to control the activities of shipping conferences. Neither \nSingapore nor Malaysia has attempted to regulate the activities of liner shipping. While the \nThai government has not pursued an active anti-trust policy in the maritime sector, the \nPrices of Goods and Services Act B.E. 2542 (1999) and the Business Competition Act B.E.\n2542 (1999) would appear to give it the power to act against conferences if considered \nnecessary. However, under s.35(2) of the Business Competition Act, enterprises must be \ndeclared \"controlled businesses\" before action can be taken. The maritime sector has not \nbeen declared as a business of this type. In today\u2019s competitive shipping environment, the \npressure to control the activities of shipping conferences is more muted than in the 1960s \nand 1970s. \n6.1.5 Maritime Subsidies, Grants, and Cargo Preference \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have historically offered various forms of \nsubsidy,  grants  or  cargo  preference  to  encourage  the  development  of  national  fleets. \nMalaysia has a long-standing program of support for national shipowners. The Industrial \nDevelopment Bank was set up in August 1979 to provide loans at concessional rates of \ninterest  to  shipowners,  ship  builders  and  ship  repairers.  Improved  benefits,  aimed  at \npromoting fleet expansion, were made available to Malaysian shipowners in 1982. Similarly, \nMalaysia\u2019s 2001 Budget added RM1 billion to the National Shipping Fund to boost the \nnational merchant fleet. Malaysian shippers that can demonstrate that they have supported \nnational carriers will benefit from income tax concessions. \nUnder  the  Ship  Mortgage  Decree  (1978), Philippine  citizens  may  obtain  preferential \nmortgage loans for the purpose of financing the construction, acquisition or initial operation \nof vessels. Philippine shipping enterprises are exempt from the payment of income tax on \nincome derived directly from Philippine overseas shipping, while the Merchant Shipping Act \n(1985) allows exporters to deduct 150% of overseas freight and port charges from their \ntaxable income if they use national flag carriers. \nA number of aSEA member countries\u2014including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand\u2014\nhave  historically  granted  cargo  preference  to  their  own  vessels.  Thailand\u2019s  Mercantile \nMarine Promotion Act (1978) required government generated cargo to be carried by national \nflag vessels. Similarly, Ministerial Regulation No. 2527 (1984) required all private firms \nengaged in business transactions with government agencies or state enterprises to carry \nimports in Thai vessels where possible. Presidential Decree 18-82 reserved Indonesian \ngovernment cargoes for national flag carriers. ", "24 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nGenerally speaking, maritime subsidies, grants and cargo preference policies were wound \nback  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s.  Thailand  no  longer  has  any  bilateral  agreements \nrestricting access to cargo. Such residual restrictions as exist are limited to government-\ncontrolled cargoes. The Final Report of the ASEAN Maritime Transport Development Study \nfound that there are no restrictions on access to cargoes to and from Thailand, except only \nthe transport of goods from certain countries to Thailand which is required to be serviced by \nThai  flag  vessels  if  such  goods  are  purchased  by  government  agencies  or  public \nenterprises.\n6.2 Policies Relating to Ports \n6.2.1 Ownership and Management of Ports and Terminals \nAlthough a number of port authorities in the aSEA region are formally corporatized or \noperate under separate statutes that provide a high degree of independence, others remain \nbranches of the public service. For example, the Ports Department of Brunei Darussalam \nowns and operates Muara port, providing a wide range of port services, including wharf \nfacilities, towage, and pilotage. Stevedoring and road haulage are provided by the private \nsector. \nIndonesia\u2019s  1,700  ports  are  organized  in  a  hierarchical  system.  Of  these,  111  ports \n(including 25 main or strategic ports) are deemed commercial ports and are controlled by \nfour state-owned corporations i.e., Indonesian Port Corporations (IPCs) I, II, III and IV. A \nfurther 614 noncommercial ports operate on a small scale. In addition, about 1,000 special \npurpose or dedicated private ports service the needs of private companies.26\nIn the main ports, almost all functions are undertaken by the IPCs. They control the port \napproaches,  pilotage,  towage,  wharves  and  most  of  the  cargo  handling.  Competition \nbetween ports is limited by the requirement that IPCs cross-subsidies each other to ensure \nfinancial sustainability. Port tariffs are determined centrally and imposed uniformly across \nports  (Senada,  November  2008).  However,  shipowners  have  complained  that  the  port \ncharges were too high, with the charges at Tanjung Priok said to be among the highest in \nSoutheast Asia.27 In this light, Indonesia\u2019s 2008 Shipping Law removes the IPCs\u2019 legislated \nmonopoly on commercial ports. \nMalaysia\u2019s six major ports\u2014Port Klang, Bintulu, Johor (including PTP), Kemaman, Kuantun \nand Penang\u2014are controlled by Federal Port Authorities (FPAs), and all ports under FPAs \nare either corporatized or privatized. \nThe Philippine archipelago has more than 1,000 seaports, 123 of which operate under the \njurisdiction of the Philippines Port Authority (PPA). The PPA has a dual role as regulator and \noperator. The final report of the ASEAN Maritime Transport Development Study noted that \n                                                           \n \n26  USAID/Senada, Indonesian Ports Sector Reform and the 2008 Shipping Law, August 2008, p.7. \n27\n  PDP/Meyrick, Promoting Efficientand Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, Final Report, Indonesian \nCountry Report, March 2005. ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  25 \nthe PPA has financial autonomy, with the port revenues it collects remaining with the PPA \nrather  than  accruing  to  government.  Port  charges  in  the  Philippines  are  controlled  by \ngovernment, with common charges applying in all ports. \nUntil the creation of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in 1996, the Port of \nSingapore Authority (PSA) acted as both regulator and port operator. Today, the MPA is the \nregulatory body responsible for overseeing Singapore\u2019s port and maritime affairs, while the \nPSA functions as a provider of port services. The PSA was corporatized in October 1997. \nThe Port Authority of Thailand (PAT) has jurisdiction over the major ports of Bangkok and \nLaem Chebang. Other common user ports (e.g., Songkhla) are under the control of the \nHarbors Department. \nUntil 2002, the major ports in PNG were owned and operated by the loss-making Papua \nNew Guinea Harbors Board. In attempting to minimize losses, the Board neglected essential \nmaintenance and ignored the need for capital spending to improve ageing infrastructure.28\nThe Board was corporatized in 2002, the new entity being known as PNG Harbors Ltd \n(PNGHL). Currently, PNGHL operates 16 of the 22 declared ports in PNG. Only two PNGHL \nports, Port Moresby and Lae, are commercially viable. \n6.2.2 Models of Port Administration \nThe managerial model adopted by ports varies across countries and as between ports. The \nADB has argued that port organizational structures may be grouped into three categories:29\n1.  Landlord Port: the port owns the land and basic infrastructure but allows the private \nsector to lease out berths and backup areas either through a capital lease or concession \nagreement. Worldwide this is the most common governance structure; \n2.  Operating (Service) Port: the port provides not only infrastructure, berths and equipment \nbut also provides services to vessels and their cargo; and \n3.  Resource  (Tool)  Port:  the  port  owns  the  land,  infrastructure  and  fixed  equipment, \nprovides common-user berths and rents out equipment and space to cargo-handling \ncompanies and other commercial operators, on a short-term basis. \nMany public ports have adopted a mix of these strategies. Table 6 (page 40) suggests that a \nmajority of aSEA ports have adopted the Resource (Tool) or Operating (Service) forms. \nPAT has adopted different managerial models in Bangkok and Laem Chebang. At Bangkok \n(Klong Toey) PAT is both owner and operator, providing all port services except stevedoring. \nIn  contrast,  PAT  has  adopted  a  landlord  model  at  Laem  Chebang,  being  content  to \nsupervise the operation of the port while others provide essential services. \n6.2.3. Port Privatization \n                                                           \n \n28  Papua New Guinea Harbours Limited, Briefing Paper on the Functions and Activities of Papua New Guinea \nHarbours Limited, February 2004. \n29  ADB. 2000.

Klang Container Terminal (KCT) was privatized in \n1986, followed by the sale of the remaining berths at North Port (Port Klang) to Klang Port \nManagement (KPM) in 1992. KCT and KPM later merged their operations to form Northport. \nSubsequently, a major new container terminal at Westport (Port Klang) was constructed.30\nSimilarly, in 1998 the Indonesian government adopted a policy of privatizing the major \ncontainer terminals. Major facilities are now operated by the private sector, including foreign \nowned corporations. For example, Hutchison operates the JICT Terminal at Tanjung Priok \n(Jakarta) while P & O Ports operates the terminal at Tanjung Perak, Surabaya. In general, \nthe performance and productivity of these facilities has improved over the past decade, \nalthough there have been concerns over congestion at Tanjung Priok and Tanjung Perak \n(Surabaya).\nIn the Philippines, Executive Order No. 12 (1994) encourages competition in the provision of \ncargo  handling  and  other  port  services.  Under  the  government\u2019s  de-monopolization \nprogram, shipowners, operators and charterers may either use port services provided by the \nPPA or enter into contracts with one or more privately-owned port service contractors.

The  WTO  has  noted  that  as  late  as  1994, \nSingapore prohibited foreign firms from engaging in customs clearance services and in the \nPort of Singapore\u2019s core services in cargo handling. Until 1992, exclusive foreign ownership \nof shipping agencies was also prohibited.32 In a number of Southeast Asian ports, foreign \nregistered vessels paid higher port dues and/or faced discrimination in the handling of their \ncargoes.\nIndonesia  does  not  allow  foreign  investors  to  own  more  than  49%  of  a  range  of  port \nservices,  including  wharves,  stevedoring,  towage,  container  terminals, Ro-Ro terminals, \nliquid and dry bulk terminals. The 49% cap makes investment more problematical in that \nforeign investors have to find domestic partners. Given the inefficiency of Indonesian ports, \nmore liberal rules on foreign investment would enable crucial upgrades in capacity using \nbest international practice and technology. \nOver the past 15 years, the move towards corporatization and privatization has removed \nmany of the barriers. Port operators such as Hutchison, DP World and PSA have become \ndirectly involved in the development and operation of foreign ports. Liberalization in the \nprovision of port services and the encouragement of private investment in port facilities have \nenhanced productivity and accelerated port development. Formal discrimination between \nvessels owned and registered domestically and those owned and registered abroad in the \nterms and conditions of supply of port services has been virtually abandoned. Similarly, \nrestrictions on foreign participation in the provision of freight forwarding and inland haulage \nhave been relaxed in many economies. \n7. Conclusion \nWhile direct government intervention in the provision of international shipping services does \nnot appear necessary or desirable, governments can promote the efficiency of international \nshipping services by improving the performance of ports and inland transport networks as \nwell as by encouraging more efficient and reliable domestic and regional shipping services. \nIn  this  regard,  this  paper  suggests  the  following  policy  recommendations  to  improve \nmaritime connectivity in the aSEA region:\na) Strengthen Regional Connectivity on \"Thin\" Routes \nRegional maritime connectivity can be improved by promoting the growth of transport links \nalong economic corridors\u2014especially maritime economic corridors.

In such corridors, a chain of islands each with \nits  road  network  and  the  necessary  ports  to  allow  Ro-Ro  ferry  connections  between \nadjacent islands appears to be relatively common. In this context, pre-feasibility studies to \nexamine the economic potential of the following corridors should be undertaken: \n(cid:2)  East\u2013West Corridor (linking Singapore\u2013Java\u2013Bali\u2013Lombok\u2013Timor-Leste\u2013West Papua\u2013\nPapua New Guinea); and the \n(cid:2)  North\u2013South Corridor (linking Papua New Guinea\u2013West Papua\u2013Indonesia\u2013Philippines\u2013\nThailand).\nRo-Ro vessels would appear the ideal means of maritime transport on these economic \ncorridors. Their ability to accommodate large trucks (and, if necessary, railway freight cars) \nas well as their speed of turnaround in ports offers flexibility and economy. \nHowever, regional routes with \"thin\" cargo flows that are considered important for social or \ndevelopmental reasons may need to be subsidized in the short term. At the same time, \nthese subsidy payments should be tied to clearly defined objectives and should be justified \nwithin the framework of a comprehensive transport policy. Furthermore, subsidies should be \ntransparent and subject to regular review. \nThere has been a tendency for governments to seek value for taxpayer funds by putting out \nsubsidized service to tender. Wherever practical, subsidies should be awarded on the basis \nof an open and competitive tendering process and tender periods should be of a limited \nduration.\nb) Encourage Regional Cargo Consolidation and Port Rationalization \nRegional ports face a \"chicken and egg\" dilemma. Shipping lines will only serve ports \noffering sufficient cargo to make calls economically viable, while shippers are reluctant to \nuse a port unless it receives regular calls by shipping lines. Since trade volume is the main \ndeterminant  of  maritime  connectivity,  it  is  commonly  argued  that  appropriate  domestic \ninitiatives should be undertaken to build a large enough cargo base to attract shipowners. \nIn principle, this problem might be solved by \n(cid:2)  Giving shipping lines fiscal incentives to call at the port(s) in question (e.g., exemption \nfrom income tax for a given period or granting investment allowances or access to credit \nat concessionary rates). Incentives such as these may solve the problem in the short \nterm. However, a shipping line in receipt of subsidies may lack the incentive to chase \ncargo  volumes.  In  this  case,  governments  may  need  to  insert  a  sunset  clause  to \ndiscourage permanent subsidization. \n(cid:2)  Offering shipping lines a minimum cargo guarantee. To make this viable, it may be \nnecessary  to designate specific ports as cargo consolidation centers. For example, ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  29 \nDavao might be designated as the collection point for Mindanao cargoes. Clearly a \ncargo consolidation centre must be strategically located. Ideally, it would be the port that \noffered the minimum total transport cost for a given region. \nThe creation of cargo consolidation centers implies port rationalization i.e., a reduction in the \nnumber of commercial ports in the interest of greater efficiency. Such a policy has both \nadvantages and disadvantages. The use of larger vessels, making fewer calls at well-\nequipped regional ports could reduce the costs incurred by international shipowners. In a \ncompetitive shipping market, such reductions should be passed on to shippers. However, \ntotal transport costs will be minimized only if feeder container services or land transport links \nare efficient and competitive. However, it was noted that port rationalization\u2014which will see \nsome ports and regions lose their direct international links\u2014is likely to be a contentious \npolicy issue politically. Since some shippers are likely to have higher costs imposed on \nthem, the question of compensation may well be raised.\nc) Encourage Investment in Port and Inland Transport Infrastructure \nMajor hub ports in the aSEA region such as Singapore, Port Klang and PTP are efficient by \nworld  standards.  However,  it  was  found  that  other  regional  and  local  ports  suffer  by \ncomparison. In some of these ports, the lack of investment in physical infrastructure may \nlimit the size of vessels visiting the port and force shipowners to use costly self-geared \nships.\nNonetheless, substantial gains are possible if ports can enhance their productivity and \nefficiency. Since berth hire charges (based on the size of the vessel and the time spent in \nport) constitute a major component of port costs, the longer the ship takes to load/unload, \nthe higher the berth hire charges. Efficient ports lower ship turnaround time, increasing \nvessel productivity and leading to lower port and voyage costs. \nRaising  port  efficiency  usually  requires  a  combination  of  investment  in  physical \ninfrastructure,  improvements  in  the  interface  between  the  port  and  its  hinterland, \nimprovements in port governance, and privatization of those port services capable of being \nprovided competitively. \nThere are several ways to bring about desired improvement in the quantity and quality of \nport  infrastructure.  For  example,  local  or  regional  sinking  funds  aimed  specifically  at \nimproving facilities in local and regional ports might be set up. Given the importance of the \nbarter trades within the region as highlighted in this paper, there is a pressing need to \nimprove facilities to handle breakbulk and minor bulk cargoes. \nGovernments and port authorities may need to cooperate to improve the interface between \na port and inland transport. Inadequate storage within a port, an inefficient interface between \nthe port and road transport operators, and congestion on roads in the immediate vicinity of \nthe port may seriously detract from port efficiency. \nd) Improve Governance Structures and Create Competitive Markets for Port Services \nWhile  the  landlord  port  model  has  been  widely  adopted,  the  operating  (service)  and \nresource (tool) models also have their adherents. Whichever form is adopted, it is important ", "30 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nto  implement  the  package  fully.  Government-owned  ports  should  be  corporatized  or \nprivatized rather than operated by the public sector. \nIt was found that common charges apply across ports in aSEA countries such as the \nPhilippines and Indonesia. Ideally, port pricing should reflect the underlying cost of service \nprovision on a port-by-port basis. Cross-subsidization between ports raises the cost of using \nefficient ports. \nThere is a general presumption in economics that efficient service provision is most likely to \nbe achieved where services are delivered in a competitive market. Ideally, government \nshould  separate  potentially  competitive  port  services\u2014including  towage,  mooring,  and \nstevedoring\u2014from  port  infrastructure  development  and  regulatory  control.  For  example, \nsince competition in the provision of stevedoring has been shown to lead to improvements in \nservice quality and lower costs of cargo handling, a port authority should issue a stevedoring \nlicense to any firm demonstrating the requisite skills. Exclusive licenses should only be \ngranted where they can be shown to be in the best interest of the efficient working of the \nport. Port authorities can encourage the development of competitive stevedoring services by \nhiring cargo handling equipment to stevedores. \ne) Reassess the Costs and Benefits of Cabotage \nGiven the imbalances in cargo flows in the aSEA region, there would appear to be efficiency \ngains available if the coastal trades of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand \nwere opened up to overseas vessels. Access to coastal trade would enable shipowners to \ndevelop new route patterns designed to minimize the back-haul problem. To reassess the \ncosts and benefits of cabotage, a variety of policy options could be considered which are \nhighlighted below. \nModified Cabotage Regulations\nAs is the case with container transport to/from Port Klang in Malaysia, certain trades might \nbe excluded from cabotage rules. This might be done by adopting a quota system allowing \nforeign flag vessels to gain partial access to coastal shipping markets, or by replacing \nexisting licensing provisions with a tariff or tax with the aim of reduced the tariff or tax over \ntime. Another possible option is to adopt a Single or Continuing Voyage Permit system, \nenabling foreign flag vessels to operate on the coast for a specified period of time. \nRegional Cabotage \nUnder this option national cabotage regulations would be replaced by regional free trade in \nshipping  services.  aSEA  members  taking  part  in  the  scheme  would  simply  exchange \ncabotage rights. A shipowner domiciled in a signatory nation would be able to operate \ninternational or coastal services throughout the region. \nOpen Seas \nAny user of coastal shipping services would be free to use the services of a shipping \noperator of his choice, domestic or foreign. Under this option, government would continue to \nregulate to ensure compliance with safety and environmental laws. ", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  31 \nThe opening of coastal trades to greater competition by abolishing or modifying cabotage \npolicies has the potential to lower domestic transport costs and encourage innovation in the \nprovision of shipping services. \nf) Encourage Supply Chain Integration \nThe services provided by ports and shipping companies form a segment of a total supply \nchain, stretching from the farm or factory in the country of origin through to the point of final \nconsumption of the good in question. In an ideal world, the cost of transport would be \nminimized  along  the  entire  supply  chain.  Supply  chain  integration,  involving  the \nharmonization of operations and standards across the chain, may be necessary to effect \nsuch cost minimization.\nIn the absence of monopoly control over a given supply chain, strategic collaboration or \nstrategic alliances may be necessary if the benefits of supply chain integration are to be \nachieved. It was noted that it may be advantageous for the governments of aSEA countries \nto create an environment conducive to strategic collaboration. Specific measures likely to \nenhance strategic collaboration include: tax incentives; relaxation of foreign equity limits \nencouragement of players to use state-of-the-art information technology across the supply \nchain;  as  well  as  the  development  of  education  and  training  programs  on  supply \nmanagement (Tongzon 2009). \nWhile sizeable benefits are achievable through enhanced maritime connectivity, there are \nnevertheless  costs  and  potential  problems  associated  with  strategy  implementation. \nSubstantial direct costs would be incurred in upgrading infrastructure and providing shipping \nservices, especially where regional port facilities require substantial investment and where \nmany  islands  require  improved  maritime  connectivity  (as  in  the  case  of  BIMP-EAGA) \n(Tongzon 2009). \nFurthermore,  improving  maritime  connectivity  between  less  developed  regions  appears \nlikely  to  incur  substantial  indirect  costs,  especially  in  the  short  run.  Subsidies,  tax \nconcessions and other incentives may be necessary to persuade shipowners to offer the \ndesired services or to persuade shippers to route cargo via regional load centers. \nAttempts to improve maritime connectivity between less-developed regions of aSEA may \ncreate political problems and involve political costs. For example, while it may be in the \nregional interest for a hub port to be developed in Country A (as distinct from countries B, C \nand  D),  the  national  interests  of  countries  B,  C and D may favor the development of \ndomestic hub ports. There is a possibility of trade diversion occurring when one particular \nport  is  selected  for  development  over  others.  For  example,  it  is  conceivable  that  the \nupgrading  and  expansion  of  port  facilities  at  Bintulu  may  divert  Malaysian  trade  from \nSingapore.\nThe building of complementarities among regional economies may conflict with national \npriorities and policies. For example, enhancing maritime connectivity between Mindanao \n(Philippines) and Sabah (Malaysia) may divert cargoes from Manila. Tongzon argued that \nthis trade-off between national and regional interests must be seen in a strategic and holistic \nperspective.", "32 | ADBSOUTHEASTASIAWORKINGPAPERSERIESNO.1\nThere may be a need to separate those policy recommendations that hold out promise of \nshort-term gains from those whose pay-offs are likely to be in the long term. A similar \nseparation may be needed for policy recommendations that can be implemented given \nexisting legislation and customs from those that require fundamental shifts in law, custom or \npractice.\nFinally,  careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  sequencing  of  policy  measures \ndesigned  to  enhance  regional  connectivity.  Before  setting  a  definite  timeline  for \nimplementing  policy  measures  designed  to  enhance  regional  maritime  connectivity,  the \ninterrelatedness of such measures have to be thoroughly understood.

Many of the islands are poor, remote from main centers of economic \nactivity, and not well connected. Improving maritime connectivity is key to the development \nof this region. This paper provides a brief overview of the state of maritime connectivity in the \nregion, including demand and supply of shipping services, and existing infrastructure.  Southeast Asia\nThe paper also reviews the region\u2019s maritime policies and offers key policy recommendations \nWorking Paper Series\nto strengthen connectivity. \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.
