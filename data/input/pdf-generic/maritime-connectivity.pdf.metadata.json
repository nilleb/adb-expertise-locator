Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nSoutheast Asia\nWorking Paper Series\n\nMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic \nSoutheast Asia: An Overview\n\nKeith Trace, Barend Frielink, and Denis Hew\nNo. 1   |   August 2009\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. WPS090622\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nADB SERD.indd   1\n\n31/08/2009   3:12:21 PM\n\n\fADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series\n\nMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia:  \nAn Overview \n\nKeith Trace+, Barend Frielink, and Denis \nHew++\n\nNo. 1       August  2009 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n+ Keith  Trace  is  a  Consultant  at PDP Australia \nPty  Ltd,  Sydney,  Australia.

Introduction \n\nArchipelagic  Southeast  Asia  (aSEA)  covers  five  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN) member countries\u2014Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nSingapore\u2014together  with  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  and  Timor-Leste.1  The  aSEA  region \nincludes  the  Brunei  Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East ASEAN  Growth Area \n(BIMP-EAGA) and the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT). \n\nThe key to understanding the region lies in an appreciation of its archipelagic nature. aSEA \nincludes more than 24,000 islands spread across 5,200 km from east to west and 3,400 km \nfrom  north  to  south.  It  has  a  population  of  over  350  million,  225  million  of  whom  live  in \nIndonesia with a further 87 million living in the Philippines (Green, 2008).\n\nTo  the  inhabitants  of  the  archipelago,  the  sea  is  at  once  a  link  and  a  barrier,  as  well  as  a \nresource  and  a  challenge.  On  the  positive  side  of  the  ledger,  the  sea  provides  food  and \nemployment,  while  the  danger  of  an  unsustainable  marine  environment  and  the  fact  that \nproximity to the sea heightens vulnerability to national disaster are potential negatives. \n\nThis paper provides a detailed overview of maritime connectivity in the aSEA region. Section \n2 discusses the economic diversity and development gaps that exist among and within the \naSEA  countries.  Section  3  argues  for  the  importance of improving maritime connectivity in \nbridging  this  economic  divide  as  well  as  its  role  in  economic  development  and  poverty \nalleviation. Section 4 examines the development of the maritime sector including assessing \nthe demand for maritime transport and the supply of shipping services in the aSEA region. \nSection  5  assesses  the  region's  existing  maritime  infrastructure,  particularly  the  adequacy \nand  efficiency  of  ports.  The  region's  maritime  policies  related  to  shipping  and  ports  are \nexamined  in  Section  6.  Finally,  Section  7  provides  key  policy  recommendations  that  could \nstrengthen  maritime  connectivity  in  the  aSEA  region.  This  final  section  also  highlights  the \ncosts and potential problems that may arise with the implementation of policies to improve \nmaritime connectivity. \n\n2. The aSEA Economies\n\nThe aSEA economies are extremely diverse (see Table 1, page 36). Their population varies \nfrom 225 million in Indonesia to 40,000 in Brunei. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \nvaries  from  $440  in  Timor-Leste  to  over  $35,000  in  Singapore.  aSEA  countries  differ \nsignificantly in their reliance on foreign trade. Measured by the ratio of exports to GDP, the \ndegree of trade openness varies widely from 2.2% in Timor-Leste to 230.9% in Singapore. \n\nWhile the ASEAN member nations of aSEA are at first glance diverse, they share a number \nof  common  features.  Singapore  is  a  mature  economy  with  a  level  of  GDP  per  capita \ncomparable  with  many  advanced  western  industrial  nations.  Having  experienced  strong \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n1\n\n   Where relevant, this report will make reference to Thailand as well. \n\n\f2 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\neconomic  growth  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  Malaysia  has  enjoyed  renewed  growth \nfollowing  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  the  late  1990s.  Brunei  is  a  wealthy  country  heavily \ndependent  on  earnings  from  oil.  Indonesia  developed  rapidly  in  the  1980s  on  the  basis  of \nlabor-intensive  manufacturing  (mainly  centered  on  Java)  but  has  failed  to  maintain  early \nmomentum. The Philippines has yet to show higher sustained growth. These countries have \na number of features in common: relatively open economic policies; low and reducing levels \nof  tariff  protection;  and  a  strong  reliance  on  export-led  economic  growth.  Indonesia, \nMalaysia  and  the  Philippines  also  have  in  common  that  large  areas  of  the country are not \nwell-connected and much poorer than the main centers (eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia, \nsouthern Philippines). \n\nPNG  and  Timor-Leste  are  at  a  much  earlier  stage  of  economic  growth  than  their  ASEAN \ncounterparts. Not only is their GDP per capita much lower, but Timor-Leste\u2019s very low trade \nintensity  reflects  the  country\u2019s  wider  political  and  economic  problems.  PNG  and  Timor-\nLeste\u2019s  transport  needs  and  existing  service  patterns  differ  significantly  from  those  of  the \nASEAN  members  of  aSEA.  Timor-Leste  has  extremely  limited  airline  and  shipping  links. \nPNG's  connectivity  is  also  poor  and  tends  to  be  oriented  towards  Australia  rather  than \nSoutheast Asia.\n\nThe development gap between the ASEAN members of aSEA and PNG can be considered \nanalogous with that between the more advanced ASEAN countries (the ASEAN-6) and the \nnewer  and  less  developed  members  i.e.,  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet \nNam.\n\n3. The Importance of Maritime Connectivity \n\nImproved  connectivity,  especially  through  transport  links,  is  an  essential  condition  for \neconomic  growth.  Transport  links  not  only  provide  physical  access  to  resources,  but  also \nenable  producers  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  in  domestic  and  foreign  markets, \nleading to economies of scale and specialization. \n\nAt  the  grassroots  level, local  transport  links\u2014whether  provided  by  road,  rail,  or  water \ntransport\u2014are  essential  if  local  communities  are  to  sell  their  produce  in  neighboring \nmarkets and purchase a range of manufactured goods with the proceeds. The existence of \nlocal  transport  links  make  possible  specialization  of  production  according  to  comparative \nadvantage and facilitate the emergence of a local and regional economy. In many areas of \narchipelagic  Southeast  Asia,  poor  roads  and  non-existent  rail  communications  mean  that \nsea or river transport is required to access local urban centers. \n\nSince poverty and isolation (the absence of basic transport services) are closely correlated, \nimproved  connectivity  is  a  necessary  condition  for  poverty  alleviation.  World  Bank \nexperience  with  rural  highways  in  Africa  and  South  Asia  has  shown  that  the  provision  of \nbasic  access  through  all-weather  roads  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  poverty  in  rural \nfor  socioeconomic  development. \nareas,  especially  when  combined  with  programs \nEconomic growth, made possible by the provision of improved transport links, contributes to \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  3 \n\npoverty  reduction  by  generating  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  by \nincreasing government capacity for income redistribution (Liu and Gannon 1999). \n\nThe  impact  of  improvements  in  connectivity  on  poverty  may  be  direct  or  indirect.\nConnectivity  has  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  where  improvements  in  transport  or \ncommunications  create  additional  income  and  employment.  The  construction  of  an  all-\nweather  local  road,  a  bridge  linking  two  islands  or  the  provision  of  a  regular  shipping \nservice where none existed before will lead to an expansion of employment opportunities in \nlocal industry. Transport improvements have an indirect impact when investment in a new \nfacility sets off a chain reaction that creates upstream or downstream employment benefits. \nFor  example,  port  privatization  coupled  with  improvements  in  local  roads  may  lower \ncontainer  movement  costs, \nthe  competitiveness  of  agricultural \nincreasing \nprocessing  industries.  While  the  indirect  effects  of  transport  improvements  may  be  very \nimportant,  relatively  little  is  known  about  them  and  forecasting  their  scale  is  difficult. \nHowever, case studies of economic development suggest that there is considerable scope \nfor improvements in connectivity to play a direct role in poverty alleviation (Liu and Gannon, \n1999).\n\nthereby \n\nImproved  connectivity  at  a  regional  level widens  the  potential  market  available  to  local \nproducers,  providing  opportunities  to  specialize  in  agricultural  or  industrial  production \naccording  to  comparative  or  competitive  advantage.  The  economies  of  scale  generated \nmay  enable  firms  to  lower  the  unit  price  of  their  products  and  further  widen  their  market. \nLinks between regional economies may develop within the borders of a country or between \nregions located in neighboring countries. \n\nIn  a  globalized  world,  efficient  connections  between  the  aSEA  region  and  international \nmarkets are absolutely essential. Over the past two decades, the growth of global trade has \nconsistently outpaced the growth of world GDP. In developing countries in Asia, including \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, trade liberalization and the globalization of \nproduction  have  been  the  main  drivers  of  economic  growth.  The  aSEA  region  has  also \nenjoyed an acceleration of economic growth as a result of globalization. \n\nThe  ASEAN  members  of  aSEA  experienced  a  period  of  economic  expansion  and \nunprecedented  prosperity  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  attributable  to  political  stability,  sound \nmacroeconomic  management  and  an  open  international  trading  environment.  Under  the \nimpact of trade liberalization, internationally traded aSEA production increased more rapidly \nthan national income, the commodity composition of trade changed significantly, and major \nchanges took place in the pattern of trade flows. In particular, there has been a significant \nincrease  in  intra-Asia  trade  especially  between  ASEAN  countries  and  the  PRC.  Intra-\nASEAN trade has also increased significantly over the past two decades. \n\nSince  the  bulk  of  the  aSEA  region\u2019s international  trade  is  carried  by  sea,  access  to  high \nquality  international  shipping  services  is  of  paramount  importance.  In  an  increasingly \ncompetitive  world,  nations  with  access  to  efficient  and  reliable  shipping  services  have  a \ncompetitive  advantage  over  those  that  are  poorly  served.  In  an  ideal  world,  shipowners \nwould  offer  shippers  relatively  frequent  services  to  a  wide  range  of  destinations,  shipping \ncapacity would be matched to the volume of cargo available, the vessels employed would \n\n\f4 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nbe  as  large  as  possible  so  as  to  benefit  from  economies  of  scale,  transit  times  would  be \nminimized, and freight rates would reflect the cost of providing the shipping service. \n\n4. Shipping Services and the Development of the \nMaritime Sector \n\nThe  differing  physical  and  commercial  characteristics  of commodities carried by sea have \nled  to  the  emergence  of  specialist  types  of  shipping.  General  cargo  is  carried  on  liner \nservices  operated  by  cellular  container  or  roll-on  roll-off  vessels.  The  hallmarks  of  a  liner \nservice are regularity of sailings and diversity of cargoes carried. Bulk dry cargo, formerly \ncarried by tramp vessels which plied for hire and were typically employed carrying grain or \nore cargoes under voyage or time charters, is now carried almost exclusively by specialist \nbulk carriers. Bulk liquid cargoes (e.g., crude oil, refined oil, etc.) are carried by tankers. \n\n4.1 Demand for Maritime Transport in the aSEA Region \n\n4.1.1. Demand for Regional Container (General Cargo) Shipping Services \n\nDemand for regional container shipping services arises from several sources: \n\n(cid:2)  Services  linking  regional  ports  with  other  regional  ports  and/or  the  major  cities  of \nmember countries. Since most aSEA countries reserve their coastal shipping trades \nfor vessels owned and crewed by their nationals (i.e., they have adopted a policy of \ncabotage), overseas owned vessels are usually excluded from these trades; \n\n(cid:2)  Services  linking  regional  ports  in  Country A  with  regional  ports  in  Countries  B,  C \nand  D.  Typically,  shipping  services  between  regions  located  in  different  countries \nare provided by vessels beneficially owned by citizens of one of the countries or by \nvessels owned by third parties; \n\n(cid:2)  Services linking ports in Country A with major hub ports such as Singapore, \n\nPelabuhan Tanjung Pelepas (PTP) and Port Klang. \n\nTrade growth between the economically advanced ASEAN countries has been particularly \nrapid. As far as maritime trade is concerned, the largest trade flows are between Singapore, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The two-way exchange of products between Singapore \nand Malaysia is the most significant trade flow between ASEAN members, although a high \nproportion of this traffic is carried by road or rail. \n\nContainerized  cargoes  form  a  very  significant  share  of  intra-ASEAN  trade.  Many \ncommodities previously handled in bulk are now moving in containers. For example, while \nlarge  shipments  of  low  quality  rice  are  still  shipped  in  bulk  or  breakbulk  form,  premium \nquality  rice  is  now  packed  in  retail  packs  or  50kg  woven  poly  bags  and  shipped  in \ncontainers.  Even  exports  of  steel  scrap  are  sometimes  containerized.  In  short,  there  has \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  5 \n\nbeen a marked shift from bulk and breakbulk to containerized cargoes over the past twenty \nyears. Major commodities in the intra-ASEAN trades shipped in containers include \n\n(cid:2)  Agricultural products (e.g., rice, sugar, and beans); \n(cid:2)  Consumer products; \n(cid:2)  Raw materials (including palm oil); \n(cid:2)  Electrical and electronic products; and \n(cid:2)  Automotive components and some built-up cars (most built-up cars are shipped by \n\nspecialist car carriers). \n\nthe  majority  of \n\nDemand  patterns  for  regional  container  shipping  services  vary  widely  across  the  aSEA \nregion. For example, Brunei Darussalam does not have a developed manufacturing sector \nand relies heavily on imports of foodstuffs, manufactured goods, construction materials and \nimports  are  containerized,  Brunei \nthe  country\u2019s \nchemicals.  While \nDarussalam\u2019s exports are shipped in bulk, creating a problem of container repositioning for \nshipping companies. The Philippines also imports a wide variety of containerized consumer \ngoods  and  manufactures  while  containerized  exports  are  limited.  Over  90%  of  containers \nare  exported  empty.  In  contrast,  Malaysia  has  a  healthy  two-way  traffic  in  containerized \ncargoes, as does Singapore. The trading patterns of PNG and Timor-Leste do not generate \nlarge container flows to and from aSEA member economies. \n\nA  substantial  share  of  intra-aSEA  trade  is  carried  on  vessels  employed  either  in  mainline \ntrades  or  on  intra-Asian  feeder  container  services.  In  times  of  relatively  low  demand, \nmainline carriers frequently carry intra-aSEA cargo on vessels employed in the Asia-Europe \nand  trans-Pacific  trades.  However,  during  2002\u20132008  the  demand  for  space  on  long-haul \ncontainer  services  by Chinese exporters led to shortages of shipping space for intra-aSEA \ncargoes. Given the impact of the financial market crisis of 2008 on world trade, this problem \nmay have been resolved for the time being. \n\nDemand  for  shipping  services  between  the  less-developed  provinces  of  Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and the Philippines, as well as between the ASEAN members of aSEA and PNG \nand  Timor-Leste,  is  very  limited.  Despite  attempts  at  sub-regional  cooperation  such  as \nBIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT,  shipowners  report  difficulties  in  maintaining  sufficient  cargo  to \nsustain regular services.  \n\n4.1.2. Demand for Mainline International Container Shipping Services \n\nSince  the  1980s Asian  newly  industrializing  countries  have  enjoyed  rapid,  export-oriented \neconomic growth, driven by Japanese firms choosing to move production offshore, by the \nquest  for  low-cost  production  in  Southeast  Asia  by  European  and  US  firms,  and  by \ndeclining  US  industrial  competitiveness.  As  a  result,  the  volume  of  manufactured  goods \ncarried  by  sea  has  grown  sharply. According  to  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade \n\n\f6 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nand  Development  (UNCTAD),  manufactures  account  for  over  70  %  of  world  merchandise \ntrade by value.2\n\nMaritime  trade  includes  consumption  goods  as  well  as  intermediate  goods,  parts  and \nsemifinished  products. As  much  of  this  trade  is  carried  in  containers,  world  containerized \ntrade  has  grown  significantly. As  a  major  producer  of  manufactures, Asia  has  been  at the \nforefront of this growth. \n\nThere are three major East-West container flows in the Northern Hemisphere: Asia-Europe; \nTrans-Pacific (linking Asia and North America); and Trans-Atlantic (linking Europe and North \nAmerica). According  to UNCTAD estimates, the Asia-Europe trade\u2014with a total cargo flow \nof  27.7  million  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEU),  of  which  17.7  million TEU  were shipped \non  the  dominant  leg  from  Asia  to  Europe\u2014overtook  the  Trans-Pacific  as  the  largest \ncontainerized trade lane in 2007. Container traffic on the Trans-Pacific totaled 20.23 million \nTEU in 2007, with 15.4 million TEU being carried on the dominant eastbound leg from Asia \nto North America. \n\nThe  scale  of  container  shipment  on  North-South  trades  (e.g., Australasia\u2013Northeast Asia, \nAustralasia\u2013Southeast Asia) is increasing but is much smaller than those in the East\u2013West \ntrades.\n\n4.1.3 Demand for Bulk and Breakbulk Shipping Services \n\nBulk  shipping  is  conventionally  sub-divided  into  dry  bulk  and  tankers.  Dry  bulk  vessels \nhandle cargoes of minerals and agricultural products. The tanker market includes crude oil \ncarriers,  product  carriers,  liquid  natural  gas  and  Liquefied  petroleum  gas  carriers.  While \neconomies  of  scale  in  bulk  shipping  dictate  the  use  of  large  vessels  wherever  possible, \nintra-aSEA  bulk  flows  tend  to  be  of  limited  size.  As  a  result,  the  very  large  bulk  carriers \nemployed  in  the  carriage  of  iron  ore  and  coal  from  Australia  and  Brazil  to  the  PRC  and \nJapan  are  not  found  in  intra-aSEA  trades.

They \nmay  also  carry  general  and  project  cargoes.  Breakbulk  vessels  are  typically  small  in  size, \nenabling them to service a wide range of ports, including private wharves and jetties. Such \nvessels carried a high proportion of intra-aSEA cargoes until the late 1960s. \n\nBreakbulk shipping survives in certain specialist trades. For example, logs and sawn timber \nas well as rubber are shipped in breakbulk from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Similarly, \nsome  rice  exports  from  Thailand  are  still  handled  by  breakbulk  vessels.  Interviews \nconducted  in  Thailand  in  2004  suggested  that  low  quality  rice,  exported  in  50kg  bags,  is \nhand-stowed  on  board  breakbulk  vessels  known  as  \"tween-deckers.\"4  It  was  noted  that \nIndonesia imports between 600,000-1,000,000 tons of rice a year, mostly from Thailand and \nViet  Nam.  Raw  materials  for  the  fertilizer  industry  are  commonly  shipped  in  breakbulk \nvessels as is coal destined for cement works in Thailand. \n\n4.2 Supply of Shipping Services in the aSEA Region \n\n4.2.1 Supply of Container Shipping Services \n\nSince  the  1980s,  shipowners  operating  in  the  major  East-West  container  trades  have \ndeveloped new types and patterns of shipping services to replace the former \"out-and-back\"\nservices  between  individual  countries.5  These  changes  have  been  driven  by  the  scale  of \ncargo flows between the three major Northern Hemisphere cargo-generating regions, Asia, \nNorth  America  and  Europe,  as  well  as  by  economies  of  vessel  size  and  the  intensity  of \ncompetition in container shipping markets.  \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\nThailand, March. \n\nback to Country A.   \n\n4   See PDP/Meyrick. 2005.

The  emerging  pattern  of  mainline \nand  feeder  services  is  analogous  with  the  \"hub-and-spoke\"  networks,  which  evolved \nfollowing the deregulation of US domestic aviation. Intense competition between the major \ncontainer  lines  operating  in  the  East\u2013West  trades  guarantees  freight  rates  reflect  cost \neconomies.\n\nIntense competition and economies of vessel size lie behind recent increases in the size of \ncontainer  ships.  Economies  of  vessel  size  arise  from  the  technical  characteristics  of \ncontainer  shipping:  the  capital  cost  per  container  slot  falls  as  vessel  size  increases,  while \nthe  ratio  of  crew  to  carrying  capacity  as  well  as  the  consumption  of  fuel  per  unit  of  cargo \ncarried  decline  as  vessel  size  increases.  Lloyd\u2019s  Maritime  Asia  has  estimated  the \nconstruction  cost  of  a  6,000TEU  containership  is  only  50%  above  that  of  a  3,000TEU \nvessel.  The  fuel  consumption  of  the  6,000TEU  vessel  is  30%  above  that  of  the  smaller \nvessel,  while  crew  size  is  the  same.  The  largest  vessels  currently  employed  in  the  Asia-\nEurope and trans-Pacific trades can carry around 10,000TEU. \n\nThe recognition that early container services tended to serve an excessive number of ports, \nthus  increasing  costs,  led  to  attempts  to  minimize  the  number  of  ports  of  call  by  main  line \nvessels. This  led  to  the  development  of  regional  hubs  or  load  centers  such  as  Singapore, \nPort Klang, and PTP. The preferred hub port varies between shipping lines. The volume of \ntransshipment  cargo  available,  the  cost  of  using  a  port\u2019s  facilities  and  the  level  of  its \nproductivity (containers handled per hour) each enter into the equation when a line chooses \na  hub  port.  Singapore  remains  the  major  hub  for  aSEA  traffic.  However,  during  the  past \ndecade Malaysian ports\u2014especially Port Klang and PTP\u2014have challenged Singapore\u2019s hub \nstatus. CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd have chosen to focus their Southeast Asian services on \nPort  Klang,  relying  on  the  volume  of  transshipment  cargo  flowing  into  Port  Klang  from \nPeninsular Malaysia, which tends to be routed via Port Klang rather than Singapore.7 Three \nmajor  container  shipping  operators\u2014Maersk,  Sealand,  and  Evergreen\u2014used  their  market \npower  in  defecting  from  Singapore  to  PTP  in  2002\u20132003.8  APL  and  Yang  Ming  remain \nwedded  to  Singapore,  arguing  that  the  volume  of  transshipment  cargo  available  over \nSingapore is the crucial determinant in their choice of hub port. \n\nIn  addition  to  major  Round-the-World  and  Pendulum  services  operated  by  large  container \nvessels, second-tier container services, operated by vessels appreciably smaller than those \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n6   Pendulum services are usually operated by vessels too large to transit the Panama Canal.

Such \nvessels  incur  higher  costs  per  container.  However,  the  marketing  advantage  gained  by \noffering  direct  calls,  rather  than  an  indirect  service  via  a  major  hub  port,  may  offset  the \nhigher costs of operation. Within the aSEA region, such services not only call at the regional \nhubs  but  at  other  major  regional  ports  such  as  Tanjung  Priok  (Jakarta),  Manila,  Laem \nChebang and Bangkok. \n\n4.2.2 Supply of Regional Shipping Services \n\nAt  the  regional  level,  the  quality  of  shipping  services  varies  markedly  depending  on  the \ndegree  of  development  of  the  region  in  question  and  the  extent  to  which  production  in  a \ngiven region is export-oriented. \n\nMost  aSEA  ports  serving  export-oriented  regions  receive  relatively  frequent  shipping \nservices.  As  noted  above,  the  intra-ASEAN  trades  have  expanded  rapidly  over  the  past \ntwenty years. Many vessels employed in these trades are feeder vessels.9\n\nThe  range  of  container  shipping  services  operating  exclusively  between  aSEA  ports  is \nlimited.  Shipowners  interviewed  in  Malaysia  and Thailand in 2004\u20132005 argued that cargo \nvolumes were insufficient to make intra-aSEA or intra-ASEAN services profitable on a stand-\nalone  basis.  The  scale  of  cargo  movements  between  Northeast  and  Southeast Asia  (and \nvice versa) makes it more profitable to operate services from the PRC to Southeast or South \nAsian ports, calling at one or more aSEA ports en route. \n\nTable  2  (page  36)  shows  the  number  of  direct  container  services  between  the  various \nmembers  of  aSEA.  The  table  includes  First  and  Second  Tier  services,  Asian  feeder  and \nintra-aSEA services. It provides a measure of maritime connectivity across the aSEA region. \nNote  that  the  pattern  of  container  services in Southeast Asia is highly complex, a result of \nthe  number  of  competing  shipping  companies  as  well  as  the  fact  that  many  shipping  lines \noffer  several  service  \"strings\"  on  a  given  route,  i.e.,  services  with  different  patterns  of  port \ncalls.  The  table  highlights  the  importance  of  Singapore  and  Malaysia  as  regional  hubs  for \ncontainer shipping.  \n\nShipping services connecting the less developed regions of aSEA suffer by comparison. For \nexample,  while  relatively  frequent  container  shipping  services  connect  ports  along  the \ncoasts of East Malaysia and Brunei with Southeast Asia\u2019s major hub ports, Singapore, Port \nKlang  and  PTP,  shipping  services  between  Philippine  ports  within  the  BIMP-EAGA  region \nand their counterparts in Indonesia, East Malaysia and Brunei are infrequent or non-existent. \n\nTable 3 (page 36) shows feeder container services operating between Port Klang/Singapore\nand ports in East Malaysia and Brunei. Such services not only carry cargo between regional \nports, but cargo from East Malaysia and Brunei to/from Singapore or Peninsular Malaysia, \nas well as transshipment cargo to/from East Malaysia and Europe. The number of operators \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n9  \n\nIn 2007, it was found that more containers were shipped in intra-ASEAN trades (42 million TEU) than in other \nmajor trades.\n\n\f10 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nand  the  frequency  of  sailings  suggest  substantial  two-way  cargo  movement.  It  was  noted \nthat a number of container ports, including Bintulu and Sandakan, aspire to achieve regional \nhub status. \n\nSimilarly, a number of Indonesian ports, including some within BIMP-EAGA, are within the \nhinterland of Singapore and Port Klang. They too benefit from relatively frequent sailings by \nfeeder  container  vessels.  It  was  found  that  Philippine  ports  within  the  BIMP-EAGA  region \ntend  to  be  served  by  Filipino  domestic  shipping  services  rather  than  being  part  of  the \nregional container feeder system hubbing on Singapore or Port Klang. \n\n4.2.3 Poor Connectivity on \"Thin\" Regional Routes \n\nInfrequent  maritime  connections  between  less  developed  regions  of  aSEA  countries  have \ndiscouraged  economic  development.  For  example,  shipping  services  between  Philippine \nports  and  member  provinces  of  BIMP-EAGA  in  Indonesia,  East  Malaysia  and  Brunei,  are \nunsatisfactory. While roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) ferry services between Zamboanga (Philippines) \nand  Sandakan  (Malaysia)  are  operated  by  two  Zamboanga-city  based  companies  i.e., \nAleson Shipping Lines and Sampaguita Shipping, the ferry service between General Santos \nCity  (Philippines)  and  Bitung  (Indonesia)  has  been  suspended.  Similarly,  PNG  and  Timor-\nLeste  have  poor  maritime  connectivity  with  ASEAN  members  of  aSEA.  The  only \ncontainerized  service  linking  Timor-Leste  with  the  other  members  of  aSEA  is  the  Perkins \nservice between Darwin-Dili-Singapore. \"Thin\" cargo flows on regional shipping routes have \ndiscouraged entrepreneurs from opening new routes or purchasing new equipment. \n\nThe  development  of  maritime  economic  corridors  (MECs)  can  address  the  issue  of  poor \nconnectivity  on  \u201cthin\u201d  regional  routes.  The  corridor  development  concept  hinges  on  an \nevolution from transport corridors, to trade corridors, to corridors where many dimensions of \neconomic  development  are  taken  into  account.  In  a  maritime  setting,  such  corridors  can \nintegrate  highly  scattered  island  economies  with  multiple  economic,  social  and  even \nenvironmental  benefits.  In  archipelagic  nations  such  as  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines, \nMECs can be domestic but most likely will have a bigger impact when crossing borders.\n\nMECs  in  aSEA  revolve  around  Ro-Ro  vessels,  associated  port  facilities,  roads  and \nsupporting  policies  and  regulations,  as  has  been  successfully  implemented  in  the \nPhilippines  (see  Box).  The  Philippine  approach  and  experience  warrants  serious \nconsideration  for  the  aSEA  region  as  a  whole.  On  the  supply  side,  it  has  the  great \nadvantage that large upfront capital investments are not needed. Hence, the entire system \ncan be built in a gradual and modular fashion, including port facilities and road connections. \nHowever,  what  is  more  important  in  this  case  is  the  introduction  of  effective  policies  and \nregulations  to  support  maritime  economic  corridor  development.  In  terms  of  impact,  MECs \nwill  significantly  boost  economic  activity  by  linking  small  island  economies  into  the  wider \nregional  transport  networks,  substantially  lowering  transport  and  associated  transaction \ncosts, thereby encouraging more trade and traffic between adjacent islands. \n\nA detailed analysis of the potential benefits of MECs, however, is beyond the scope of this \npaper.  Briefly,  such  benefits  include  an  increase  in  economic  opportunities,  direct  benefits \nfor  the  poor  in  terms  of  lower  transport  costs  (economic  and  social)  and  better  market \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  11 \n\naccess, concentration of development along corridors thereby achieving economies of scale \nand more efficient land use, and access to a wider variety of good and services. \n\n\f12 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nBox: Marine Economic Corridor applied in the Philippines \n\nIn  the  Philippines,  the  Strong  Republic  Nautical  Highway  is  a  prime  example  of  a  successful  MEC.  Prior  to \n2005,  Ro-Ro  services  did  exist  in  the  Philippines,  but  they  were  hampered  by  regulatory  restrictions.  Only \nafter  the  government  introduced  policies  to  promote  the  nautical  highway,  supported  with  appropriate \nregulations and presidential orders, did the concept take off. The system consists of 3 north-south corridors \nsupported with a number of lateral links: \n(cid:2) \n\nThe  Western  Nautical  Highway,  already  operational,  links  Luzon  to  Mindanao  by  way  of  the  major \nislands of Mindoro, Panay, Guimaras and Negros, with the port of Batangas serving as the gateway to \nVisayas and Mindanao; \nThe Eastern Nautical Highway, also known as the Pan Philippine Highway and mostly completed, links \nthe  islands  of  Luzon,  Samar,  Leyte  and  Mindanao,  with  Surigao  City  serving  as  the  gateway  to \nMindanao; and \nThe  Central  Nautical  Highway,  the  last  of  the  highways  to  be  developed,  links  Luzon  with  Misbate, \nCebu, and Bohol, with the port of Balingoan (Misamis Oriental) acting as the gateway to Mindanao. \n\n(cid:2) \n\n(cid:2) \n\nA major benefit of the Nautical Highway lies in improved local connectivity for the islands along each of the \nroutes.  For  example,  prior  to  the  development  of  the  Western  Nautical  Highway,  the  island  of  Mindoro  had \nextremely  poor  shipping  links  to  the  Visayas  (Panay  and  Guimaras).  There  was  very  little  cargo  and \npassenger  traffic  southbound  from  Mindoro,  almost  all  traffic  being  northbound  from  Mindoro  to  Luzon \n(Basilico, 2008). \n\nAlthough the Western Nautical Highway has only been in existence for five years a number of benefits have \nalready become apparent:\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(cid:2)\n\n(cid:2)\n\nReduced  Transport  Costs.  A  2006  study  conducted  by  the  Center  for  Research  and  Communication \nsuggests that the Western Nautical Highway has substantially reduced transport costs. \nChanges in Patterns of Freight and Passenger Movements. The reduction in transport costs coupled \nwith the efficiency and flexibility of the Nautical Highway has led to a shift in the way shippers transport \ntheir goods. For example, Nestl\u00e9 Philippines now chooses to make small, frequent and direct deliveries \nto its clients, using the Nautical Highway where appropriate. As a result, the company has closed 33 of \nits  36  distribution  centers.  Similarly,  whereas  bus  operators  tended  to  serve  either  the  northern  or  the \nsouthern  section  of  the  route  between  Luzon  and  Mindanao  prior  to  the  existence  of  the  Nautical \nHighway,  some  bus  operators  now  choose  to  operate  through  buses  from  Manila  to  destinations  in \nMindanao.\nIncreases in Agricultural Productivity. The opening of the Western Nautical Highway has created new \nmarkets for farmers (Basilo, 2008). For example, farmers in San Jose (Occidental Mindoro) who used to \nsell  onions  and  other  agricultural  produce  to  Manila  now  have  the  option  of  shipping  their  products \nsouthwards into Panay, Negros and Mindanao. Fruits such as mangosteen and durian grown in Davao \nare  able  to  be  marketed  in  Iloilo  and  Bacolod.  Such  developments  enable  farmers  to  increase  their \nacreage and production, with benefits to agricultural productivity. \nEnhanced  Investment.  Over  the  period  2003\u201306,  investment  in  Roxas  is  estimated  to  exceed  P100 \nmillion. This is said to have generated over 2,000 jobs and to have increased business and property tax \ncollections.  Similarly,  investment  boomed  following  the  development  of  the  Port  of  Danqay.  Basilo \nsuggests that a year after the port became operational, substantial commercial development\u2014appliance \nstores, retail outlets, drugstores, restaurants, banks and transport terminals\u2014was evident. The number \nof  petrol  stations  increased  from  two  to  seven.  By  2006,  879  business  establishments  operated  in  the \nmunicipality, a 15% increase over the number for 2005. \nEnhanced  Tourism  Potential.  Until  recently  the  potential  for  tourism  along  the  Philippines  western \nseaboard  was  constrained  by  poor  transport  links.  The  introduction  of  Ro-Ro  services  between  Luzon-\nMindoro  and  Mindoro-Pasay  has  stimulated  tourist  traffic.  Dangay  Port  in  Roxas  (Mindoro  Occidental) \nhas  developed  as  a  point  of  departure  for  the  Boracay  Islands,  while  Caticlan  serves  as  a  jumping  off \npoint to Panay Island. Over the  period 2003-06 tourist receipts on Boracay grew by more than 50%, in \nIloilo by 30%, in Bacolod by 15% and in Dapitan by 200%. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  13 \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Supply of Local Shipping Services \n\nThe types of vessel employed in local trades vary widely across the aSEA region, depending \non local custom, depth of water available and the nature of port facilities. At the most basic \nlevel, vessels may have to be loaded and unloaded directly on to a beach. In other cases, \nprimitive wharf facilities may be provided, although mechanical cargo handling equipment is \nrarely  available.  In  the  aSEA  region,  rivers  and  estuaries  are  often  shallow  due  to  silting, \nmandating the use of shallow draft vessels. Typically, small sailing or motor vessels collect \nexport cargoes from coastal villages for consolidation in regional ports, a process commonly \nreferred  to  as  coastal  accumulation.  In  Indonesia,  the  prahu shipping  sector  performs  this \ntask. Until recently most prahus were sailing vessels. Since the 1970s, motor vessels have \nsteadily replaced sailing vessels. The largest of the vessels now employed, the prahu pinisi, \nrarely carry the traditional two-masted rig. Similarly many so-called auxiliary sailing vessels \n(prahu layar motor) are now for all intents and purposes motor vessels. The sails are merely \na decoration to avoid the more stringent manning and seaworthiness requirements for motor \nvessels (Dick, 1987). \n\nThe prahu sector is an important segment of Indonesian coastal shipping. Official estimates \nsuggest that the sector had a 14% share of inter-island trade. The importance of the sector \nappears  to  be  much  greater  than  official  statistics  would  suggest.  Unofficial  estimates \nsuggest  that  the  tonnage  carried  by  the  prahu sector  is  understated  by  at  least  a half and \nperhaps by as much as two-thirds. \n\nInterviews  conducted  in  Malaysia  and  Thailand  in  2004\u20132005  suggest  that  traditional \nshipping services, employing small motor vessels, tug and barge, sailing craft and junks, still \nflourish  in  Southeast  Asia,  The  vessels  employed  are  small  enough  to  use  local  ports  or \nprivate  wharves.  Many  of  the  vessels  are  Indonesian-owned  and  employed  in  what  are \nknown as barter trades. Vessels employed in these trades typically carry a range of cargoes \nfrom Indonesia (forest products, charcoal, coal or coke), unload at a Malaysian or Thai port, \nsell the cargo and purchase a back-loading cargo of foodstuffs, beverages or manufactures.  \n\nOn  one  visit  to  the  breakbulk  wharf  at  Port  Klang  (Southpoint),  a  junk  was  unloading \ncharcoal  from  Sumatra.  The  owner  intended  to  purchase  cases  of  Coca-Cola  as  back-\nloading  for  Sumatra.  While  most  of  these  cargoes  are  cleared  by  customs,  the \nheterogeneous nature of the cargoes means that it is difficult to develop an accurate picture \nof the trade from available customs records. \n\n4.2.5 Supply of Bulk and Breakbulk Shipping Services \n\nHistorically, the intra-Asian bulk trades have been heavily dependent on small handy-sized \nbulk  carriers.  In  this  highly  fragmented  market,  two  Thai  companies\u2014Precious  Shipping \n\n\f14 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nand  Thoresen  Thai Agencies\u2014have  emerged  as  specialist  operators  of  handy-sized  bulk \ncarriers.10\n\nDuring  the  past  decade  many  small  bulk  carriers  have  been  scrapped  and  owners  have \nbeen reluctant to order replacement tonnage. As a result freight rates for handy-sized bulk \ncarriers have risen sharply. In turn, high freight rates have encouraged shippers to switch to \ncontainers unless they generate sufficient cargo volumes to use larger Panamax sized bulk \ncarriers.\n\n5. Maritime Infrastructure: Adequacy and Efficiency \nof Ports \n\n5.1 The Port Task \n\nPorts  are  the  gateways  through  which  maritime  trade  must  pass.  If  a  port\u2019s physical \ninfrastructure  is  inadequate  and/or  if  it  is  operationally  inefficient,  the  costs  incurred  by \nshipping lines will be higher than necessary, forcing them to increase charges for handling \nimports and exports. As a result, trade growth will suffer and regional economic growth will \nbe somewhat more constrained than would otherwise be the case. \n\nPorts require a large number of specialist tasks and players. While the provision of wharves \nand cargo handling areas are of central importance, ports also require dredged channels, \nnavigation aids, pilots, towage services, stevedoring services, customs clearance facilities, \nand  an  efficient  interface  with  land  transport.  Typically  such  services  are  provided  by \ndifferent agents, some in the public and some in the private sector. Ownership and intensity \nof competition in the provision of such services differ greatly. \n\nThe  archipelagic  nature  of  the  aSEA  region  means  that  countries\u2014with  the  exception  of \nBrunei Darussalam, Singapore and Timor-Leste\u2014require many ports. Typically, a handful of \nports  owned  and  operated  by  government  or  government-linked  corporations  handle \ninternational  deep-sea  container  traffic.  Secondary  ports,  owned  by  national  or  provincial \ngovernments,  are  served  by  shipping  lines  operating  near-sea  regional  and  domestic \nshipping services. \n\nEven  a  brief  review  of  each  aSEA  port  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  Fortunately, \nASEAN  has  listed  the  ports  that  member  nations  consider  to  be  of  significance  to  the \ndevelopment of the intra-ASEAN trade (see Table 4, page 38). Almost all ports listed in Table \n4  handle  container  and  general  cargo  and  a  significant  proportion  of  them  have  common \nuser facilities for bulk dry cargoes. Table 4 also shows the inland connectivity of the ports: \nthe road, rail and inland waterway connections to and from each port. It was found that rail \nand inland waterway connectivity were limited.

By the mid- \n1980s,  containerization  had  been  almost  universally  adopted  on  main  line  trades.11  The \nsubsequent  growth  of  trade  flows,  the  employment  of  larger  vessels  on  mainline  trades, \nand  the  emergence  of  new  service  patterns  in  both  mainline  and  feeder  trades  have  had \nimportant implications for ASEAN ports.  \n\nNot  surprisingly,  port  investment  undertaken  in  the  early  phase  of  containerization  has \nproved  inadequate  and  facilities  have  had  to  be  expanded.  While  some  ports  have  met \nthese  challenges  successfully,  others  have  been  slower  to  react  to  the  changing \nenvironment  (Trace,  1997).  Table  5  (page  39)  shows  the  container  volumes  handled  by \nmajor aSEA ports over the period 2000\u20132008. \n\nThe  efficiency  of  container  ports  in  the  aSEA  region  varies  widely. The  region\u2019s  major  hub \nports\u2014Singapore,  Port  Klang  and  PTP\u2014are  highly  efficient  by  world  standards.  However, \nthe  productivity  achieved  in  the  region\u2019s  other  main  ports\u2014Bangkok,  Laem  Chebang, \nJakarta, and Manila\u2014is of a lower order. In general, productivity in regional ports suffers as \na result of inadequate investment and poor management. \n\nWithin the ASEAN region, the pivotal position of the Port of Singapore has been maintained \nover  the  past  decade  despite  intense  competition  from  Malaysian  ports.  Singapore  is  the \naSEA  region's  main  transshipment  port.  While  the  Port  of  Singapore Authority  (PSA)  does \nnot publish the number of transshipment containers handled, it was estimated that between \n60 and 70 per cent of containers handled may be for transshipment (Robinson, 1991). This \nwould  suggest  that  between  16.7  to  19.5  million  of  the  2007  container  throughput  of  27.9 \nmillion  should  be  classified  as  transshipment  cargo.  Typically  achieving  100-110  container \nmoves per hour (MPH), port productivity in Singapore is high by world standards. \n\nSingapore's dominant position depends on continuing efforts on the part of the government \nand  the  PSA  to  create  and  sustain  the  port's  competitive  advantage.  The  efficiency  with \nwhich  containers  are  handled  and  the  cost-effectiveness  of  shipping  cargo  via  Singapore \ncombine to create a service that is qualitatively different from that offered by other ports in \nthe region. The continuing growth of container throughput has made it necessary to further \ndevelop  container  handling  facilities.  By  2004,  Singapore\u2019s  four  main  container  terminals \n(Tanjong Pagar, Keppel, Brani, and Pasir Panjang) had reached capacity. An additional three \nberths were commissioned at Pasir Panjang Terminal (PPT) in 2005 and a further five berths \nin 2006. With the addition of further berths at PPT, Singapore\u2019s container handling capacity \nwill increase to 31 million TEU by 2011.12\n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n11   By  the  late  1990s  containerization  had  been  widely,  though  not  exclusively,  adopted  in  secondary  trades, \n\nincluding those serving low labour cost developing economies. \n\n12   See Neil Dekker, Well prepared, Containerisation International, July 2005.

In  1993,  the  Malaysian  government  declared  Port  Klang  to  be  the \nnational load centre (i.e., the major Malaysian gateway for imports and exports). However, it \nis the development of PTP that has posed a more serious competitive threat to Singapore. It \nwas  noted  that  prior  to  the  expansion  of  Port  Klang  and  the  development  of  PTP,  around \n90%  of  Malaysian  cargo  was  handled  by  Singapore.  Subsequently,  the  Malaysian \ngovernment \nto  use \nMalaysian ports, including a doubling of duties on laden trucks leaving Malaysia. In the two \nmain Malaysian ports, as in Singapore, container handling rates are high. For example, PTP \nachieves approximately 100 to 110 MPH which is similar to that of Singapore. \n\nintroduced  measures  actively  encouraging  Malaysian  shippers \n\nIn  contrast,  Indonesia\u2019s  ports  are  characterized  by  relatively  poor  turnaround  times  and \ninefficient work practices. Jakarta\u2019s International Container Terminal (JICT) was found to be \none of the least efficient of the region\u2019s main terminals, judged by productivity and unit costs \n(Ray,  2003).  Jakarta\u2019s  container  handling  rate  in  mid-2008  was  40-45  MPH,  less  than  half \nthe rate achieved in Singapore and PTP.13 A recent USAID/Senada study finds that the entire \nport  system  is  highly  inefficient  and  in  urgent  need  of  upgrading  (based  on  performance \nindicators for all the major commercial ports ).14\n\nPort  performance  data  for  19  regional  container  ports  in  Indonesia  suggest  that  berth \noccupancy  rates  are  high  by  international  standards,  leading  to  berthing  delays  and \nexcessive  waiting  time,  while  average  turnaround  time  is  high.  Working  time  as  a \npercentage  of  turnaround  time  is  high.  As  the  USAID/Senada  study  observed  that  the \nIndonesian  cargo  fleet  is  spending  too  much  time  sitting  idle  or  waiting  at  ports.  The \ncomparatively poor performance of Indonesia\u2019s commercial port system is usually attributed \nto the following reasons: \n\n(cid:2)  Geographic constraints: Indonesia has few natural deep-water harbors and a river \n\nsystem prone to serious siltation that restricts port depth; \n\n(cid:2)  Lack  of  port  infrastructure:  Many  regional  ports  lack  container  handling  equipment \nsuch  as  gantry  cranes  and  straddle  trucks,  forcing  shipping  lines  to  employ \nexpensive self-geared vessels. The USAID/Senada study notes long delays in some \nregional ports, notably Panjang in Lampung and Belawan in North Sumatra, caused \nby breakdowns in container handling equipment; \n\n(cid:2)  Work  practices:  Many  ports  operate  on  a  one-shift  basis.  As  the  USAID/Senada \nstudy  notes,  \"\u2026the  manner  in  which  labor  is  used...effectively  institutionalizes \nfor  efficiency \nunder-utilization  of  port \nimprovements\"15;\n\nfacilities  and \n\nthe  potential \n\nlimits \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n13   Note however that the container terminals at Jakarta typically operate 2-3 cranes per vessel, while Singapore \nand PTP load and unload using 3-5 cranes per vessel. On a per crane basis, the main container terminals in \nJakarta achieve 18-22 MPH whereas Singapore and PTP achieve 30-35 MPH. (See USAID/Senada, \nIndonesian Port Sector Reform and the 2008 Shipping Law, August 2008, p.11.) \n\n14   USAID/Senada, Indonesian Port Sector Reform and the 2008 Shipping Law, August 2008, p. 6. \n15   See USAID/Senada, Indonesian Port Sector Reform and the 2008 Shipping Law, August 2008, p. 14. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  17 \n\nInformal payments (bribes) to cut queuing time; and \n\n(cid:2) \n(cid:2)  Poor  connectivity:  Roads  in  the  vicinity  of  ports  are  often  congested  and  very  few \n\nports have sufficient space for container stuffing and unstuffing. \n\nIn  the  Philippines,  Manila,  Batangas,  Subic  Bay,  Cebu,  Iloilo,  Cagayan  de  Oro,  Davao, \nGeneral  Santos  and  Zamboanga  handle  overseas  container  cargoes.  The  main  container \nterminals  in  Manila\u2014South  Harbor  (ATI)  and  MICT  (International  Container  Terminal \nServices Incorporated)\u2014compete for custom. Crane rates at these terminals, 25\u201330 moves \nper  hour  (MPH)  at  MICT  and  up  to  20MPH  at ATI,  while  lower  than  the  rates  achieved  in \nSingapore and PTP are higher than those in Indonesia. \n\nThe  overriding  port  development  problem  for  Thailand  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  lay  in  the \nadequacy of Bangkok\u2019s East Quay (Klong Toey) wharves to handle an increasing volume of \ntrade  coupled  with  the  timing  of  the  construction  of  alternative  deep-water  facilities  on  the \nGulf  of  Thailand.  This  policy  dilemma  intensified  following  containerization.  Container \nfacilities at Klong Toey could handle only feeder vessels and space behind the wharves was \nlimited,  a  serious  deficiency  for  a  port  in  which  90  %  of  containers  were  packed  and \nunpacked  within  the  port  boundaries.  Given  the  port's  proximity  to  metropolitan  Bangkok, \nroads leading to the port were extremely congested.16\n\nA 1978 World Bank study noted that Klong Toey would only be able to handle the growth of \ntraffic  until  1990.  Thereafter  Thailand  would  require  a  deep-water  port  on  the  Gulf  of \nThailand. In July 1983, the Eastern Seabord Development Committee formally approved the \nconstruction of new ports at Mab Ta Phut and Laem Chabang. \n\nOpened in 1991, Laem Chebang handled 4.6 million TEU by 2007. The development of the \nport  has  been  accelerated  by  a  government  decision  limiting  container  throughput  at \nBangkok to 1 million TEU per annum. In recent years, Laem Chebang has attracted calls by \ncarriers serving mainline trades as well as calls by feeder container vessels. For example, \nCMA CGMs Asia India-Middle East service, employing 2,500TEU vessels, makes direct calls \nat Laem Chebang, while APL began direct sailings between Laem Chebang and Karachi in \nApril  200817.  Laem  Chebang\u2019s  aspirations  to  become  a  major  hub  port  are  unlikely  to  be \nrealized as the port lies some distance from major shipping routes between Southeast and \nNortheast Asia. The cost of diverting large container vessels is likely to outweigh the benefits \nof port calls at Laem Chebang.18\n\nContainer handling rates in Port Moresby in PNG and Dili in Timor-Leste are low by aSEA \nstandards.  Port  Moresby  handles  both  container  and  bulk  cargoes.  Since  the  PNG \nmanufacturing sector is weak, the number of containers required for exports is very limited\n                                                           \n\n \n\n16   The Klong Toey wharves are located on the Chao Phraya River about 4 kilometers downstream of Bangkok. \nConstruction of the port commenced in 1939, but was not completed until 1954. By the early 1960s the port \nand the roads surrounding it were seriously congested. See M. Falkus, Bangkok in the Nineteenth and \nTwentieth Centuries, in F. Broeze (ed.), Gateways of Asia: Port Cities of Asia in the 13th-20th Centuries, \n1997.\n\n17   Hand, M. 2008. Thai ports continue to grow.

July. \n\n\f18 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nand the cargo imbalance in the container trades is very noticeable. Labor problems on the \nwharves  have  led  to  low  container  handling  rates.  The  port  of  Dili  is  the  only  international \nport  of  entry  to  Timor-Leste.  It  has  a  wharf  length  of  300m  and  can  accommodate  two \nvessels  of  up  to  5,000dwt  having  a  draught  of  up  to  6.1m.  Roll-on  roll-off  facilities  are \navailable for frontloading vessels. Improvement works at the port, including wharf extension, \nwere  undertaken  by  the  United  Nations  Peacekeeping  Force,  with  $5.7  million  of  bilateral \naid from Japan. \n\n5.3 Bulk and Breakbulk Ports \n\nMost ports mentioned above possess bulk as well as container handling facilities. Bulk and \nbreakbulk  ports  may  be  divided  into  common  user  facilities  and  purpose  built  bulk  ports \nassociated with and often developed by a particular firm or industry. The aSEA countries do \nnot possess the large scale bulk handling facilities that characterize Australian, Brazilian and \nSouth African coal and iron ore export ports as well as their Japanese and Chinese import \ncounterparts.  As  noted  above,  bulk  shipments  to  and  from  the  aSEA  region  tend  to  be \ncarried in handy-sized bulkers. More recently, Panamax vessels have been introduced into a \nlimited number of trades. \n\nAlthough Singapore is predominantly a container port, it handles breakbulk and specialized \ncargoes  through  its  multi-purpose  terminals  at  Pasir  Panjang  and  Sembawang,  while  bulk \ncargoes are handled by dedicated facilities at Jurong Port. Pasir Panjang and Sembawang \nwharves handle about 20 million tons of break bulk and specialized cargoes annually. Pasir \nPanjang wharves have dedicated ro-ro and car carrier facilities. Dry and liquid bulk cargoes \nare handled by Jurong Port. \n\nSimilarly,  Port  Klang has  both  container  and  bulk  handling  facilities.19  The  North  Port, \nWestport  and  Southpoint  facilities  all  have  dry  bulk  berths.  Berths  No.  24  and  No.  25  at \nNorthport  can  handle  vessels  of  45,000dwt  with  a  draught  of  11m.  The  berths  handle \nfertilizer, sugar, maize, feed meal and cement imports as well as palm kernel exports. Berth \nNo.  4  at  Southpoint  handles  bulk  cargoes  of  wheat,  maize  and  feed  meal.  Westport  has \nthree dry bulk terminals: \n\n(cid:2)  DB1  Terminal  has  two  200m  berths  allowing  vessels  with  a  draught  of  14.4m  to  be \nhandled.  This  terminal  has  two  gantry  grab  unloaders  capable  of  discharging  2,000 \ntons/hour. \n\n(cid:2)  DB2 Westport Slag Terminal has a 250m berth capable of handling vessels of 3.5m \n\ndraught. This terminal handles fertilizer, silica, sand and slag. \n\n(cid:2)  Westport  Cement  Terminal  can  accommodate  vessels  of  up  to  35,000dwt  with  a \n\ndraught of 11m. \n\nPrivate  jetty/terminal  development  in  the  Chao  Praya  River  (Bangkok)  was  driven  by \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n19   For further details see: PDP/Meyrick, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, \n\nFinal Report, Malaysian Country Report, March 2005. Details of bulk and breakbulk handling facilities for each \ncountry may be found in the individual country reports. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  19 \n\ngovernment berths giving priority to vessels discharging imports, forcing export shippers to \nbuild  their  own  facilities  to  handle  cargoes  such  as  sorghum,  sugar,  rice,  chemicals  and \nsteel. There are now 128 private terminals along the river. Over 60% of these are dedicated \nto a single export cargo. \n\nCorporatization  and  privatization  have  tended  to  concentrate  investment  in  the  region\u2019s \nmajor ports such as Singapore, Port Klang, PTP and Laem Chebang. Investment has also \nfocused  on  container  handling  berths  and  equipment  and  on  major  bulk  handling \ninstallations. The losers in this process have been the minor ports and/or those sections of \nthe major ports handling lower volume breakbulk and especially those handling informal or \nbarter trade cargoes. \n\nInvestment needs of regional ports have tended to be put in the \"too hard\" basket, especially \ninvestment  in  handling  equipment.  Vessels  using  these  ports  may  need  to  be  self-geared. \nAs  a  result,  loading  and  discharging  tend  to  be  slow,  congestion  delays  are  common  and \ncargo handling costs are higher than the need be. \n\nAs far as barter trades are concerned, there is a lack of investment in Port Klang\u2019s Southport \n(now  called  Southpoint).  This  port  specializes  in  handling  barter  trade  between  Indonesia \nand Malaysia (normally carried in small motorized coastal vessels, junks and landing craft). \nSuch minor trades tend to be invisible to the authorities and are in danger of being crowded \nout, physically and financially. Physically, the importance of providing adequate facilities for \nthe  container  and  major  bulk  trades  may  result  in  a  diminution  of  the  space  available  for \nminor  trades.  Financially,  investment  in  facilities  for  barter  trades  is  not  attractive  to  major \nport  operators  (such  as  DP  World  and  PSA).  Meanwhile,  following  port  privatization, \ngovernments will opt out of the responsibility to provide port facilities. This creates a funding \ngap in the provision of handling facilities for barter trades. \n\n\f20 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\n6. Maritime Policies \n\n6.1 Shipping Policies \n\nASEAN  as  an  institution  was  a  relatively  late  convert  to  the  benefits  of  liberalization  of \nshipping markets. This is understandable given that a reasonably open market for shipping \nservices  to,  from,  and  within  ASEAN  had  already  existed  by  the  late  1990s.  With  the \nexception  of  cabotage  limitations,  ASEAN  (and  non-ASEAN)  shipowners  faced  few \nrestrictions  regarding  the  routes  on  which  they  could  operate  or  the  cargoes  they  could \ncarry.\nThe major ASEAN initiative in the maritime area is the Roadmap Towards an Integrated and \nCompetitive  Maritime  Transport  in ASEAN.20  Recognizing  that  the ASEAN  countries  are  at \ndifferent  stages  in  economic  development  and  have  differing  factor  endowments,  the \nRoadmap  develops  a  set  of  principles  rather  than  focusing  on  clear-cut  goals.  ASEAN \ncountries accepting the Roadmap commit themselves to: \n\n(cid:2)  Foster competition in shipping markets; \n(cid:2)  Adhere  to  the  principle  of  free  competition  on  a  commercial  basis  for  cargo \n\nmovements to from or between ASEAN countries; \n\n(cid:2)  Prevent  or  minimize  the  imposition  of  unjustifiable  fees,  surcharges  or  imposts  by \nshipping lines or associations of shipping lines with a dominant position in any trade \nto from or within ASEAN; \n\n(cid:2)  Ensure  that  any  international  shipping  operations  retained  under  government \nownership are corporatized and operated in accordance with commercial principles; \n(cid:2)  Refrain  from  providing  preferential  access  to  routes,  cargoes  or  contracts  to \ngovernment-owned  lines,  and  to  adopt  a  timetable  for  the  removal  of  such \npreferences where they currently exist; \n\n(cid:2)  Work  collectively  and  progressively  towards  the  development  of  a  single  integrated \n\n(cid:2)  Develop  guiding  principles  for  the  provision  of  port  services  based  on  the  cost  of \n\nASEAN shipping market; and \n\nservice and infrastructure provision. \n\nIn the absence of leadership from ASEAN, liberalization of shipping policies has taken place \non  a  country-by-country  basis,  with  notable  differences  in  the  policy  stance  of  individual \naSEA  members.  In  some  aSEA  countries,  shipping  policies  have  been  the  subject  of \nconsiderable  debate  and  careful  formulation  while  in  some  others,  they  have  developed \npolicies  on  an  ad  hoc,  spur-of-the-moment  basis.  The  government  of  the  Philippines \nconsciously  set  out  to  accelerate  the  development  of  its  maritime  industry.  Under \nPresidential Decree 474 (Maritime Industry Decree), the government sought to enhance the \ncompetitive  position  of  Philippine  flag  vessels  operating  in  foreign  trades;  strengthen  the \nbalance  of  payments  by  increasing  the  inflow  of  foreign  exchange;  and  generate  job \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n20   See ASEAN Secretariat, Roadmap Towards an Integrated and Competitive Maritime Transport in ASEAN, \n2006.

Similarly,  Malaysia  has  a  long-standing  and  systematic program designed to \nencourage the growth of the Malaysian fleet. In contrast, PNG and Timor-Leste have poorly \narticulated shipping policies. \n\n6.1.2 Coastal Shipping Policy (Cabotage) \n\nMost  aSEA  members  currently  reserve  their  coastal  trades  for  domestic  shipping.  For \nexample,  Indonesia's  regulation  PP17(1988)  reserves  coastal  trades  for  Indonesian  flag \nvessels, provides operating subsidies for vessels used on selected inter-island routes, and \nrequires that crews be Indonesian citizens.21 Indonesia\u2019s cabotage policy does not appear to \nhave  been  effective  in  reserving  domestic  cargoes  for  Indonesian  owned  and  flagged \nvessels. It was estimated that foreign flag vessels carried 52% of coastal tonnage in 1997 \ncompared to 35% in 1985.22\n\nPNG  coastal  shipping  is  reserved  for  PNG-owned  and  registered  vessels.23  The  Merchant \nShipping Act (1980) gives the power to grant a license to a person to engage in the coastal \ntrade.  A  coastal  trading  license  may  only  be  granted  to:  the  owner  of  the  ship  or  the \ncharterer of the ship. Ships registered under the Act may be granted a license for a period of \n8 years. Where no ship is available to provide a particular shipping service or where a ship \nholding a license operates a service that is deemed inadequate, inefficient or unreasonably \ncostly,  a  coastal  trading  permit  to  an  unregistered  vessel  and/or  a  vessel  registered \noverseas could be issued. \n\nSimilarly,  Malaysia\u2019s Cabotage Act  (1980) requires  all  vessels  employed  in  coastal  trades, \nincluding vessels trading between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia, to be licensed by \nthe Domestic Shipping Licensing Board (DSLB). The DSLB grants three types of licenses: \n\n(cid:2)  Unconditional  (permanent)  licenses  are  granted  to  Malaysian-owned  and  registered \n\nvessels with 100% Malaysian crews.\n\n(cid:2)  Conditional  (temporary)  licenses  are  granted  to  vessels  meeting  some,  but  not  all,  of \n\n(cid:2)  Temporary licenses are granted to foreign operators when there is inadequate capacity \n\nthese conditions. \n\nin the coastal trades. \n\nThe  Merchant  Shipping  (Amendment  and  Extension)  Act  (1984)  contains  exemption \nprovisions that have, in fact, led to a relaxation of cabotage restrictions. These were invoked \nin  1994  to  allow  foreign-flagged  vessels  to  carry  transshipment  cargoes  between  the \nMalaysian  ports  of  Penang  and  Port  Klang,  and  extended  to  cover  transshipment  cargo \nbetween Penang, Johor and Port Klang in 1997. The exemptions were designed to enhance \n\n                                                           \n\n21   See PDP/Meyrick & Associates, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, \n\nIndonesia Country Report, Final Report, March 2005, p. 2. \n\n22   See Containerisation International, September 1997. \n23   See Pacific Island Forum Secretariat, Review and Analysis of Forum Island Country Shipping Regulations, \n\n \n\n2001.\n\n\f22 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nPort Klang\u2019s position as a hub port and have since been extended to support the emerging \nhub of PTP. \n\nGiven the imbalances in cargo flows in the aSEA region, there would appear to be efficiency \ngains  available  if  the  coastal  trades  of  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines  and  Thailand \nwere opened up to greater competition. \n\n6.1.3 Ship Registration and Ship Ownership \n\nThe governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand invested \nin  the  development  of  national  merchant  fleets  in  the  1960s  and  1970s.  In  the  1960s, \nSoutheast  Asian  countries  were  concerned  with  the  power  wielded  by  foreign  shipping \ncompanies  organized  into  shipping  conferences.24  Freight  rates  in  trades  such  as  Asia-\nEurope were considered excessive and the introduction of containerization appeared likely \nto enhance conference power25. Southeast Asian countries were also concerned about the \nforeign exchange outflows required to pay for shipping services provided by predominantly \nforeign owners. \n\nIn this light, Malaysia established the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC) \nin  1968.  A  major  reason  for  the  establishment  of  MISC  was  the  perception  that  the  Far \nEastern  Freight  Conference  had  a  stranglehold  over  trade.  Malaysia  established  a  second \nnational  line,  Perbadanan  National  Shipping  Lines  in  1982  to  assist  in  developing  a \nbalanced  and  diversified  fleet.  Similarly,  Thailand  has  a  clearly  articulated  policy  of \ndeveloping a national fleet.\n\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, the inefficiencies of state-owned shipping had become \nself-evident, as had the fact that government ownership tended to distort shipping markets. \nASEAN governments now moved to privatize government-owned lines. For example, MISC \nwas listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in 1997, although the government remains \nthe  major  shareholder.  Singapore\u2019s  national  shipping  line,  Neptune  Orient  Line  (has  been \nprivatized  and  is  listed  on  the  Singapore  Stock  Exchange.  The  commercialization  of \ngovernment shipping operations is generally considered to have led to improved operating \nefficiency and reduced distortions in shipping markets. \n\nCurrently,  aSEA  countries  differ  in  the  degree  of  openness  of  their  ship  registries.  For \nexample,  a  vessel  on  the  Philippine  register  must  be  owned  by  citizens  or  permanent \nresidents of the Philippines. If it is owned by a corporation, at least 60% of the subscribed \ncapital must be provided by Filipino citizens. Similarly, under Malaysia's Merchant Shipping \n                                                           \n\n \n\n25\n\n24   Shipping conferences are associations of shipowners serving a particular trade, formed for the purpose of \n\ncontrolling capacity and raising freight rates above levels that would prevail in a more competitive \nenvironment.\n\n   The capital cost of container vessels, the cost of containers themselves, as well as wharf cranes, fork-lift \ntrucks etc., were beyond the reach of most shipping companies. As a result, hitherto competing shipping \ncompanies formed container consortia to spread the costs. For instance, a trade served by a dozen shipping \ncompanies prior to containerization, might be served by only two or three container consortia. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  23 \n\nOrdinance (1952), a vessel must be 51% owned by Malaysian interests to be eligible to fly \nthe national flag. Greater flexibility in the requirements for vessel registration by number of \naSEA countries has enabled national shipowners to achieve cost reductions without resort \nto flagging out. \n\n6.1.4 Application of Competition Policy to Liner Shipping \n\nIn  general,  aSEA  countries\u2014unlike  developed  western  economies  such  as  the  US  and \nAustralia\u2014have  not  attempted  to  control  the  activities  of  shipping  conferences.  Neither \nSingapore nor Malaysia has attempted to regulate the activities of liner shipping. While the \nThai  government  has  not  pursued  an  active  anti-trust  policy  in  the  maritime  sector,  the \nPrices of Goods and Services Act B.E. 2542 (1999) and the Business Competition Act B.E.\n2542  (1999)  would  appear  to  give  it  the  power  to  act  against  conferences  if  considered \nnecessary.  However,  under  s.35(2)  of  the  Business  Competition  Act,  enterprises  must  be \ndeclared  \"controlled  businesses\"  before  action  can  be  taken.  The  maritime  sector  has  not \nbeen declared as a business of this type. In today\u2019s competitive shipping environment, the \npressure  to  control  the  activities  of  shipping conferences is more muted than in the 1960s \nand 1970s. \n\n6.1.5 Maritime Subsidies, Grants, and Cargo Preference \n\nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have historically offered various forms of \nsubsidy,  grants  or  cargo  preference  to  encourage  the  development  of  national  fleets. \nMalaysia  has  a  long-standing  program  of  support  for  national  shipowners.  The  Industrial \nDevelopment  Bank  was  set  up  in  August  1979  to  provide  loans  at  concessional  rates  of \ninterest  to  shipowners,  ship  builders  and  ship  repairers.  Improved  benefits,  aimed  at \npromoting fleet expansion, were made available to Malaysian shipowners in 1982. Similarly, \nMalaysia\u2019s  2001  Budget  added  RM1  billion  to  the  National  Shipping  Fund  to  boost  the \nnational merchant fleet. Malaysian shippers that can demonstrate that they have supported \nnational carriers will benefit from income tax concessions. \n\nUnder  the  Ship  Mortgage  Decree  (1978), Philippine  citizens  may  obtain  preferential \nmortgage loans for the purpose of financing the construction, acquisition or initial operation \nof  vessels.  Philippine  shipping  enterprises  are  exempt  from  the  payment  of  income  tax  on \nincome derived directly from Philippine overseas shipping, while the Merchant Shipping Act \n(1985)  allows  exporters  to  deduct  150%  of  overseas  freight  and  port  charges  from  their \ntaxable income if they use national flag carriers. \n\nA number of aSEA member countries\u2014including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand\u2014\nhave  historically  granted  cargo  preference  to  their  own  vessels.  Thailand\u2019s  Mercantile \nMarine Promotion Act (1978) required government generated cargo to be carried by national \nflag  vessels.  Similarly,  Ministerial  Regulation  No.  2527 (1984)  required  all  private  firms \nengaged  in  business  transactions  with  government  agencies  or  state  enterprises  to  carry \nimports  in  Thai  vessels  where  possible.  Presidential  Decree  18-82  reserved  Indonesian \ngovernment cargoes for national flag carriers. \n\n\f24 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nGenerally  speaking,  maritime  subsidies,  grants  and  cargo  preference  policies  were  wound \nback  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s.  Thailand  no  longer  has  any  bilateral  agreements \nrestricting  access  to  cargo.  Such  residual  restrictions  as  exist  are  limited  to  government-\ncontrolled cargoes. The Final Report of the ASEAN Maritime Transport Development Study \nfound that there are no restrictions on access to cargoes to and from Thailand, except only \nthe transport of goods from certain countries to Thailand which is required to be serviced by \nThai  flag  vessels  if  such  goods  are  purchased  by  government  agencies  or  public \nenterprises.\n\n6.2 Policies Relating to Ports \n\n6.2.1 Ownership and Management of Ports and Terminals \n\nAlthough  a  number  of  port  authorities  in  the  aSEA  region  are  formally  corporatized  or \noperate under separate statutes that provide a high degree of independence, others remain \nbranches  of  the  public  service.  For  example,  the  Ports  Department  of  Brunei  Darussalam \nowns  and  operates  Muara  port,  providing  a  wide  range  of  port  services,  including  wharf \nfacilities,  towage,  and  pilotage.  Stevedoring  and  road  haulage  are  provided  by  the  private \nsector. \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  1,700  ports  are  organized  in  a  hierarchical  system.  Of  these,  111  ports \n(including  25  main  or  strategic  ports)  are  deemed  commercial  ports  and  are  controlled  by \nfour  state-owned  corporations  i.e.,  Indonesian  Port  Corporations  (IPCs)  I,  II,  III  and  IV.  A \nfurther 614 noncommercial ports operate on a small scale. In addition, about 1,000 special \npurpose or dedicated private ports service the needs of private companies.26\n\nIn  the  main  ports,  almost  all  functions  are  undertaken  by  the  IPCs.  They  control  the  port \napproaches,  pilotage,  towage,  wharves  and  most  of  the  cargo  handling.  Competition \nbetween ports is limited by the requirement that IPCs cross-subsidies each other to ensure \nfinancial  sustainability.  Port  tariffs  are  determined  centrally  and  imposed  uniformly  across \nports  (Senada,  November  2008).  However,  shipowners  have  complained  that  the  port \ncharges  were  too  high,  with the charges at Tanjung Priok said to be among the highest in \nSoutheast Asia.27 In this light, Indonesia\u2019s 2008 Shipping Law removes the IPCs\u2019 legislated \nmonopoly on commercial ports. \n\nMalaysia\u2019s six major ports\u2014Port Klang, Bintulu, Johor (including PTP), Kemaman, Kuantun \nand  Penang\u2014are  controlled  by  Federal  Port Authorities  (FPAs),  and  all  ports  under  FPAs \nare either corporatized or privatized. \n\nThe Philippine archipelago has more than 1,000 seaports, 123 of which operate under the \njurisdiction of the Philippines Port Authority (PPA). The PPA has a dual role as regulator and \noperator. The  final  report  of  the ASEAN  Maritime Transport  Development  Study  noted  that \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n26   USAID/Senada, Indonesian Ports Sector Reform and the 2008 Shipping Law, August 2008, p.7. \n27\n\n   PDP/Meyrick, Promoting Efficient and Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, Final Report, Indonesian \n\nCountry Report, March 2005. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  25 \n\nthe  PPA  has  financial  autonomy,  with  the  port  revenues  it  collects  remaining  with  the  PPA \nrather  than  accruing  to  government.  Port  charges  in  the  Philippines  are  controlled  by \ngovernment, with common charges applying in all ports. \n\nUntil the creation of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in 1996, the Port of \nSingapore Authority (PSA) acted as both regulator and port operator. Today, the MPA is the \nregulatory body responsible for overseeing Singapore\u2019s port and maritime affairs, while the \nPSA functions as a provider of port services. The PSA was corporatized in October 1997. \n\nThe  Port Authority  of  Thailand  (PAT)  has  jurisdiction  over  the  major  ports  of  Bangkok  and \nLaem  Chebang.  Other  common  user  ports  (e.g.,  Songkhla)  are  under  the  control  of  the \nHarbors Department. \n\nUntil  2002,  the  major  ports  in  PNG  were  owned  and  operated  by  the  loss-making  Papua \nNew Guinea Harbors Board. In attempting to minimize losses, the Board neglected essential \nmaintenance  and  ignored  the  need  for  capital  spending  to  improve  ageing  infrastructure.28\nThe  Board  was  corporatized  in  2002,  the  new  entity  being  known  as  PNG  Harbors  Ltd \n(PNGHL). Currently, PNGHL operates 16 of the 22 declared ports in PNG. Only two PNGHL \nports, Port Moresby and Lae, are commercially viable. \n\n6.2.2 Models of Port Administration \n\nThe managerial model adopted by ports varies across countries and as between ports. The \nADB has argued that port organizational structures may be grouped into three categories:29\n1.  Landlord  Port:  the  port  owns  the  land  and  basic  infrastructure  but  allows  the  private \nsector to lease out berths and backup areas either through a capital lease or concession \nagreement. Worldwide this is the most common governance structure; \n\n2.  Operating (Service) Port: the port provides not only infrastructure, berths and equipment \n\nbut also provides services to vessels and their cargo; and \n\n3.  Resource  (Tool)  Port:  the  port  owns  the  land,  infrastructure  and  fixed  equipment, \nprovides  common-user  berths  and  rents  out  equipment  and  space  to  cargo-handling \ncompanies and other commercial operators, on a short-term basis. \n\nMany public ports have adopted a mix of these strategies. Table 6 (page 40) suggests that a \nmajority of aSEA ports have adopted the Resource (Tool) or Operating (Service) forms. \n\nPAT has adopted different managerial models in Bangkok and Laem Chebang. At Bangkok \n(Klong Toey) PAT is both owner and operator, providing all port services except stevedoring. \nIn  contrast,  PAT  has  adopted  a  landlord  model  at  Laem  Chebang,  being  content  to \nsupervise the operation of the port while others provide essential services. \n\n6.2.3. Port Privatization \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\nManila.\n\n28   Papua New Guinea Harbours Limited, Briefing Paper on the Functions and Activities of Papua New Guinea \n\nHarbours Limited, February 2004. \n\n29   ADB. 2000. Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector Investment in Infrastructure: Ports.\n\n\f26 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nMalaysia was one of the pioneers of the wave of privatization of port services that has swept \nthrough the world over the past 20 years. Klang Container Terminal (KCT) was privatized in \n1986, followed by the sale of the remaining berths at North Port (Port Klang) to Klang Port \nManagement (KPM) in 1992. KCT and KPM later merged their operations to form Northport. \nSubsequently, a major new container terminal at Westport (Port Klang) was constructed.30\n\nSimilarly,  in  1998  the  Indonesian  government  adopted  a  policy  of  privatizing  the  major \ncontainer terminals. Major facilities are now operated by the private sector, including foreign \nowned  corporations.  For  example, Hutchison operates the JICT Terminal at Tanjung Priok \n(Jakarta) while P & O Ports operates the terminal at Tanjung Perak, Surabaya. In general, \nthe  performance  and  productivity  of  these  facilities  has  improved  over  the  past  decade, \nalthough  there  have  been  concerns  over  congestion  at  Tanjung  Priok  and  Tanjung  Perak \n(Surabaya).\n\nIn the Philippines, Executive Order No. 12 (1994) encourages competition in the provision of \ncargo  handling  and  other  port  services.  Under  the  government\u2019s  de-monopolization \nprogram, shipowners, operators and charterers may either use port services provided by the \nPPA or enter into contracts with one or more privately-owned port service contractors. There \nare  two  main  terminal  operators  in  the  Philippines:  Dubai  Port  World\u2019s  Joint  venture Asian \nTerminals (ATI) and locally based International Container Terminal Services.31\n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n30   Descriptions and physical details of Malaysia\u2019s major ports can be found in: PDP/Meyrick, Promoting Efficient \nand Competitive Intra-ASEAN Shipping Services, Final Report, Malaysian Country Report, March 2005. \n\n31   Hand, M. 2007. Failing to satisfy port operators. Lloyd's List Maritime Asia. April. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  27 \n\n6.2.4 Foreign Investments in Ports \n\nDuring  the  1950s  and  1960s  foreign  shipowners,  suppliers  of  port  services  and  land \ntransport operators faced a variety of formal and informal barriers that prevented them from \noffering  their  services  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  WTO  has  noted  that  as  late  as  1994, \nSingapore prohibited foreign firms from engaging in customs clearance services and in the \nPort of Singapore\u2019s core services in cargo handling. Until 1992, exclusive foreign ownership \nof  shipping  agencies  was  also  prohibited.32 In  a  number  of  Southeast Asian  ports,  foreign \nregistered vessels paid higher port dues and/or faced discrimination in the handling of their \ncargoes.\n\nIndonesia  does  not  allow  foreign  investors  to  own  more  than  49%  of  a  range  of  port \nservices,  including  wharves,  stevedoring,  towage,  container  terminals,  Ro-Ro  terminals, \nliquid  and  dry  bulk  terminals.  The  49%  cap  makes  investment  more  problematical  in  that \nforeign investors have to find domestic partners. Given the inefficiency of Indonesian ports, \nmore  liberal  rules  on  foreign  investment  would  enable  crucial  upgrades  in  capacity  using \nbest international practice and technology. \n\nOver  the  past  15  years,  the  move  towards  corporatization  and  privatization  has  removed \nmany  of  the  barriers.  Port  operators  such  as  Hutchison, DP World and PSA have become \ndirectly  involved  in  the  development  and  operation  of  foreign  ports.  Liberalization  in  the \nprovision of port services and the encouragement of private investment in port facilities have \nenhanced  productivity  and  accelerated  port  development.  Formal  discrimination  between \nvessels  owned  and  registered domestically and those owned and registered abroad in the \nterms  and  conditions  of  supply  of  port  services  has  been  virtually  abandoned.  Similarly, \nrestrictions on foreign participation in the provision of freight forwarding and inland haulage \nhave been relaxed in many economies. \n\n7. Conclusion \n\nWhile direct government intervention in the provision of international shipping services does \nnot appear necessary or desirable, governments can promote the efficiency of international \nshipping services by improving the performance of ports and inland transport networks as \nwell as by encouraging more efficient and reliable domestic and regional shipping services. \nIn  this  regard,  this  paper  suggests  the  following  policy  recommendations  to  improve \nmaritime connectivity in the aSEA region:\n\na) Strengthen Regional Connectivity on \"Thin\" Routes \nRegional maritime connectivity can be improved by promoting the growth of transport links \nalong  economic  corridors\u2014especially  maritime  economic  corridors.  As  discussed  earlier, \nthe Nautical Highway in the Philippines offer a practical example of a successful maritime \n\n                                                           \n\n \n\n32 \"Signal Decision\". Lloyd's Maritime Asia, March 1992.  \n\n\f28 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\ncorridor.\n\nWhat seems clear is that the archipelagic nature of this region makes the development of \nmaritime economic corridors very favorable. In such corridors, a chain of islands each with \nits  road  network  and  the  necessary  ports  to  allow  Ro-Ro  ferry  connections  between \nadjacent islands appears to be relatively common. In this context, pre-feasibility studies to \nexamine the economic potential of the following corridors should be undertaken: \n\n(cid:2)   East\u2013West Corridor (linking Singapore\u2013Java\u2013Bali\u2013Lombok\u2013Timor-Leste\u2013West Papua\u2013\n\nPapua New Guinea); and the \n\n(cid:2)   North\u2013South Corridor (linking Papua New Guinea\u2013West Papua\u2013Indonesia\u2013Philippines\u2013\n\nThailand).\n\nRo-Ro  vessels  would  appear  the  ideal  means  of  maritime  transport  on  these  economic \ncorridors. Their ability to accommodate large trucks (and, if necessary, railway freight cars) \nas well as their speed of turnaround in ports offers flexibility and economy. \n\nHowever, regional routes with \"thin\" cargo flows that are considered important for social or \ndevelopmental  reasons  may  need  to  be  subsidized  in  the  short  term.  At  the  same  time, \nthese subsidy payments should be tied to clearly defined objectives and should be justified \nwithin the framework of a comprehensive transport policy. Furthermore, subsidies should be \ntransparent and subject to regular review. \n\nThere has been a tendency for governments to seek value for taxpayer funds by putting out \nsubsidized service to tender. Wherever practical, subsidies should be awarded on the basis \nof  an  open  and  competitive  tendering  process  and  tender  periods  should  be  of  a  limited \nduration.\n\nb) Encourage Regional Cargo Consolidation and Port Rationalization \nRegional  ports  face  a  \"chicken  and  egg\"  dilemma.  Shipping  lines  will  only  serve  ports \noffering  sufficient  cargo  to  make  calls  economically  viable,  while  shippers  are  reluctant  to \nuse a port unless it receives regular calls by shipping lines. Since trade volume is the main \ndeterminant  of  maritime  connectivity,  it  is  commonly  argued  that  appropriate  domestic \ninitiatives should be undertaken to build a large enough cargo base to attract shipowners. \n\nIn principle, this problem might be solved by \n(cid:2)  Giving  shipping  lines  fiscal  incentives  to  call  at  the  port(s)  in  question  (e.g.,  exemption \nfrom income tax for a given period or granting investment allowances or access to credit \nat  concessionary  rates).  Incentives  such  as  these  may  solve  the  problem  in  the  short \nterm.  However,  a  shipping  line  in  receipt  of  subsidies  may  lack  the  incentive  to  chase \ncargo  volumes.  In  this  case,  governments  may  need  to  insert  a  sunset  clause  to \ndiscourage permanent subsidization. \n\n(cid:2)  Offering  shipping  lines  a  minimum  cargo  guarantee.  To  make  this  viable,  it  may  be \nnecessary  to  designate  specific  ports  as  cargo  consolidation  centers.  For  example, \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  29 \n\nDavao  might  be  designated  as  the  collection  point  for  Mindanao  cargoes.  Clearly  a \ncargo consolidation centre must be strategically located. Ideally, it would be the port that \noffered the minimum total transport cost for a given region. \n\nThe creation of cargo consolidation centers implies port rationalization i.e., a reduction in the \nnumber  of  commercial  ports  in  the  interest  of  greater  efficiency.  Such  a  policy  has  both \nadvantages  and  disadvantages.  The  use  of  larger  vessels,  making  fewer  calls  at  well-\nequipped  regional  ports  could  reduce  the  costs  incurred  by  international  shipowners.  In  a \ncompetitive  shipping  market,  such  reductions  should  be  passed  on  to  shippers.  However, \ntotal transport costs will be minimized only if feeder container services or land transport links \nare efficient and competitive. However, it was noted that port rationalization\u2014which will see \nsome  ports  and  regions  lose  their  direct  international  links\u2014is  likely  to  be  a  contentious \npolicy  issue  politically.  Since  some  shippers  are  likely  to  have  higher  costs  imposed  on \nthem, the question of compensation may well be raised.\n\nc) Encourage Investment in Port and Inland Transport Infrastructure \nMajor hub ports in the aSEA region such as Singapore, Port Klang and PTP are efficient by \nworld  standards.  However,  it  was  found  that  other  regional  and  local  ports  suffer  by \ncomparison.  In  some  of  these  ports,  the  lack  of  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  may \nlimit  the  size  of  vessels  visiting  the  port  and  force  shipowners  to  use  costly  self-geared \nships.\n\nNonetheless,  substantial  gains  are  possible  if  ports  can  enhance  their  productivity  and \nefficiency. Since berth hire charges (based on the size of the vessel and the time spent in \nport)  constitute  a  major  component  of  port costs, the longer the ship takes to load/unload, \nthe  higher  the  berth  hire  charges.  Efficient  ports  lower  ship  turnaround  time,  increasing \nvessel productivity and leading to lower port and voyage costs. \n\nRaising  port  efficiency  usually  requires  a  combination  of \nin  physical \ninfrastructure,  improvements  in  the  interface  between  the  port  and  its  hinterland, \nimprovements in port governance, and privatization of those port services capable of being \nprovided competitively. \n\ninvestment \n\nThere  are  several  ways  to  bring  about  desired  improvement  in  the  quantity  and  quality  of \nport  infrastructure.  For  example,  local  or  regional  sinking  funds  aimed  specifically  at \nimproving facilities in local and regional ports might be set up. Given the importance of the \nbarter  trades  within  the  region  as  highlighted  in  this  paper,  there  is  a  pressing  need  to \nimprove facilities to handle breakbulk and minor bulk cargoes. \n\nGovernments and port authorities may need to cooperate to improve the interface between \na port and inland transport. Inadequate storage within a port, an inefficient interface between \nthe port and road transport operators, and congestion on roads in the immediate vicinity of \nthe port may seriously detract from port efficiency. \n\nd) Improve Governance Structures and Create Competitive Markets for Port Services \nWhile  the  landlord  port  model  has  been  widely  adopted,  the  operating  (service)  and \nresource (tool) models also have their adherents. Whichever form is adopted, it is important \n\n\f30 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nto  implement  the  package  fully.  Government-owned  ports  should  be  corporatized  or \nprivatized rather than operated by the public sector. \n\nIt  was  found  that  common  charges  apply  across  ports  in  aSEA  countries  such  as  the \nPhilippines and Indonesia. Ideally, port pricing should reflect the underlying cost of service \nprovision on a port-by-port basis. Cross-subsidization between ports raises the cost of using \nefficient ports. \n\nThere is a general presumption in economics that efficient service provision is most likely to \nbe  achieved  where  services  are  delivered  in  a  competitive  market.  Ideally,  government \nshould  separate  potentially  competitive  port  services\u2014including  towage,  mooring,  and \nstevedoring\u2014from  port  infrastructure  development  and  regulatory  control.  For  example, \nsince competition in the provision of stevedoring has been shown to lead to improvements in \nservice quality and lower costs of cargo handling, a port authority should issue a stevedoring \nlicense  to  any  firm  demonstrating  the  requisite  skills.  Exclusive  licenses  should  only  be \ngranted  where  they  can  be  shown  to  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  efficient  working  of  the \nport. Port authorities can encourage the development of competitive stevedoring services by \nhiring cargo handling equipment to stevedores. \n\ne) Reassess the Costs and Benefits of Cabotage \nGiven the imbalances in cargo flows in the aSEA region, there would appear to be efficiency \ngains  available  if  the  coastal  trades  of  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines  and  Thailand \nwere opened up to overseas vessels. Access to coastal trade would enable shipowners to \ndevelop  new  route  patterns  designed  to  minimize  the  back-haul  problem.  To  reassess  the \ncosts  and  benefits  of  cabotage,  a  variety  of  policy  options  could  be  considered  which  are \nhighlighted below. \n\nModified Cabotage Regulations\nAs is the case with container transport to/from Port Klang in Malaysia, certain trades might \nbe excluded from cabotage rules. This might be done by adopting a quota system allowing \nforeign  flag  vessels  to  gain  partial  access  to  coastal  shipping  markets,  or  by  replacing \nexisting licensing provisions with a tariff or tax with the aim of reduced the tariff or tax over \ntime.  Another  possible  option  is  to  adopt  a  Single  or  Continuing  Voyage  Permit  system, \nenabling foreign flag vessels to operate on the coast for a specified period of time. \n\nRegional Cabotage \nUnder this option national cabotage regulations would be replaced by regional free trade in \nshipping  services.  aSEA  members  taking  part  in  the  scheme  would  simply  exchange \ncabotage  rights.  A  shipowner  domiciled  in  a  signatory  nation  would  be  able  to  operate \ninternational or coastal services throughout the region. \n\nOpen Seas \nAny  user  of  coastal  shipping  services  would  be  free  to  use  the  services  of  a  shipping \noperator of his choice, domestic or foreign. Under this option, government would continue to \nregulate to ensure compliance with safety and environmental laws. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview   |  31 \n\nThe  opening  of  coastal  trades  to  greater  competition  by  abolishing  or  modifying  cabotage \npolicies has the potential to lower domestic transport costs and encourage innovation in the \nprovision of shipping services. \n\nf) Encourage Supply Chain Integration \nThe  services  provided  by  ports  and  shipping  companies  form  a  segment  of  a  total  supply \nchain, stretching from the farm or factory in the country of origin through to the point of final \nconsumption  of  the  good  in  question.  In  an  ideal  world,  the  cost  of  transport  would  be \nminimized  along \nthe \nharmonization  of  operations  and  standards  across  the  chain,  may  be  necessary  to  effect \nsuch cost minimization.\n\nthe  entire  supply  chain.  Supply  chain \n\nintegration, \n\ninvolving \n\nIn  the  absence  of  monopoly  control  over  a  given  supply  chain,  strategic  collaboration  or \nstrategic  alliances  may  be  necessary  if  the  benefits  of  supply  chain  integration  are  to  be \nachieved. It was noted that it may be advantageous for the governments of aSEA countries \nto  create  an  environment  conducive  to  strategic  collaboration.  Specific  measures  likely  to \nenhance  strategic  collaboration  include:  tax  incentives;  relaxation  of  foreign  equity  limits \nencouragement  of  players  to  use  state-of-the-art  information  technology  across  the  supply \nchain;  as  well  as  the  development  of  education  and  training  programs  on  supply \nmanagement (Tongzon 2009). \n\nWhile  sizeable  benefits  are  achievable  through  enhanced  maritime  connectivity,  there  are \nnevertheless  costs  and  potential  problems  associated  with  strategy  implementation. \nSubstantial direct costs would be incurred in upgrading infrastructure and providing shipping \nservices,  especially  where  regional  port  facilities  require  substantial  investment  and  where \nmany  islands  require  improved  maritime  connectivity  (as  in  the  case  of  BIMP-EAGA) \n(Tongzon 2009). \n\nFurthermore,  improving  maritime  connectivity  between  less  developed  regions  appears \nlikely  to  incur  substantial  indirect  costs,  especially  in  the  short  run.  Subsidies,  tax \nconcessions  and  other  incentives  may  be  necessary  to  persuade  shipowners  to  offer  the \ndesired services or to persuade shippers to route cargo via regional load centers. \n\nAttempts  to  improve  maritime  connectivity  between  less-developed  regions  of  aSEA  may \ncreate  political  problems  and  involve  political  costs.  For  example,  while  it  may  be  in  the \nregional interest for a hub port to be developed in Country A (as distinct from countries B, C \nand  D),  the  national  interests  of  countries  B,  C  and  D  may  favor  the  development  of \ndomestic  hub  ports.  There  is  a  possibility  of  trade  diversion  occurring  when  one  particular \nport  is  selected  for  development  over  others.  For  example,  it  is  conceivable  that  the \nupgrading  and  expansion  of  port  facilities  at  Bintulu  may  divert  Malaysian  trade  from \nSingapore.\n\nThe  building  of  complementarities  among  regional  economies  may  conflict  with  national \npriorities  and  policies.  For  example,  enhancing  maritime  connectivity  between  Mindanao \n(Philippines)  and  Sabah  (Malaysia)  may  divert  cargoes  from  Manila.  Tongzon  argued  that \nthis trade-off between national and regional interests must be seen in a strategic and holistic \nperspective.\n\n\f32 | ADB SOUTHEAST ASIA WORKING PAPER SERIES NO. 1\n\nThere  may  be  a  need  to  separate  those  policy  recommendations  that  hold  out  promise  of \nshort-term  gains  from  those  whose  pay-offs  are  likely  to  be  in  the  long  term.  A  similar \nseparation  may  be  needed  for  policy  recommendations  that  can  be  implemented  given \nexisting legislation and customs from those that require fundamental shifts in law, custom or \npractice.\n\nFinally,  careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  sequencing  of  policy  measures \ndesigned \nfor \nimplementing  policy  measures  designed  to  enhance  regional  maritime  connectivity,  the \ninterrelatedness of such measures have to be thoroughly understood. \n\nto  enhance  regional  connectivity.

Manila. \n\n\fMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia: An Overview\n\nThe archipelagic region of Southeast Asia consists of 24,000 islands, spread across \n5,200 kilometers (km) from east to west and 3,400 km from north to south, with a population \nof about 350 million. Many of the islands are poor, remote from main centers of economic \nactivity, and not well connected. Improving maritime connectivity is key to the development \nof this region. This paper provides a brief overview of the state of maritime connectivity in the \nregion, including demand and supply of shipping services, and existing infrastructure. \nThe paper also reviews the region\u2019s maritime policies and offers key policy recommendations \nto strengthen connectivity. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nSoutheast Asia\nWorking Paper Series\n\nMaritime Connectivity in Archipelagic \nSoutheast Asia: An Overview\n\nKeith Trace, Barend Frielink, and Denis Hew\nNo. 1   |   August 2009\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No. WPS090622\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\nADB SERD.indd   1\n\n31/08/2009   3:12:21 PM\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ADB Southeast Asia Working Paper Series\n", "Maritime Connectivity in Archipelagic Southeast Asia:  \nAn Overview \n", "Keith Trace+, Barend Frielink, and Denis \nHew++\n", "No. 1       August  2009 \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "+ Keith  Trace  is  a  Consultant  at PDP Australia \nPty  Ltd,  Sydney,  Australia.
