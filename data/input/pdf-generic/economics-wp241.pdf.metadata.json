Merchandise trade of ADEs has \ngrown at a much faster rate in the global context, with a distinct intraregional \nbias. Global production sharing has become a unique feature of the economic \nlandscape of the region, with the People\u2019s Republic of China playing a pivotal \ncomplementary role as the premier assembly center within the regional \nproduction networks. According to the projections made within the standard \ngravity modelling framework, total real nonoil trade of ADEs would increase \nat an average annual rate of 8.2 during the next 2 decades, with a notable \nconvergence of individual countries\u2019 rates to the regional average. The share of \nintraregional trade in total nonoil trade would increase steadily from 53% in 2010 \nto 58% in 2030.  The trade-to-GDP ratio would increase from 39.4% and 74.4% \nbetween these 2 years. These predictions need to be treated with caution as they \nare based on the assumption that the trade structure pertaining to the estimation \nperiod will remain unchanged in the next 2 decades.", "", "I.  Asian Trade Flows: Trends, Patterns,  \nand Projections to 2030\nThe purpose of is paper is two-fold: to examine emerging trends and patterns of \nmerchandise trade in Asia over the past 4 decades and to generate projections for Asian \ntrade through to 2030 using the standard gravity model of international trade. The paper \ncovers 12 major Asian developing economies (ADEs), namely, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nPakistan; the Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam.1 To gain \nperspective, trends and patterns of merchandise trade of the ADEs are examined in the \ncontext of the commercial policy environment, growth and structural change in these \ncountries, and institutional and technological factors governing international production \nand global trade. Relating to the latter, a key theme running through this paper is the \nimplications of global production sharing2\u2014that is, the geographic separation of activities \ninvolved in producing a good (or service) across two or more countries\u2014for rapid trade \ngrowth in these countries.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly surveys the policy environment \nshaping countries\u2019 participation in the global economy. Section III examines general \npatterns of trade since 1970, encompassing trade flows over time in aggregate, by \nmajor partners, and by major commodity groups. This section also examines geographic \npatterns of trade, with emphasis on the implications of the growing importance of \nglobal production sharing. Section IV presents the estimates of trade equations for the \n12 economies and preliminary trade flow predictions based on these estimates. The final \nsection summarizes the main findings and draws out some general inferences.\nII.  The Policy Context\nRapid growth and structural change in ADEs over the past 4 decades has been \nunderpinned by notable reduction in barriers to international trade. There has been \nsignificant import liberalization in the PRC; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; \nthe Philippines; Taipei,China; and Thailand since the mid-1980s. India and Viet Nam \nembarked on trade reforms in the early 1990s. Trade liberalization in all these economies \n1  These economies account for over 96% of total foreign trade of all countries in Northeast and Southeast Asia.\n2  An array of alternative terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including international production \nfragmentation, vertical specialization, slicing the value chain, and  outsourcing.", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nhas been predominantly unilateral and nondiscriminatory, and was also aided by \nmultilateral liberalization under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its \nsuccessor, the World Trade Organization (since 1991). Historically countries in Asia have \nnot been enthusiastic toward preferential trading agreements (PTAs), with the exception \nof some trade preferences within the ASEAN region that presumably had only trivial trade \nflow effects. Since then, the advent of the European Union and the rise of regionalism \nin North America led to a proliferation of PTAs in the region. It is too early to assess the \ntrade flow implications of these PTAs, but the available circumstantial evidence suggest \nthat so far the impact would have been rather small. The preference utilization rates \nof the PTAs remains very low, given the narrow preference margins resulting from the \nongoing process of multilateral and unilateral tariff reductions, and the administrative cost \nand complications involved in meeting the rules of origins involved for benefiting from \ntariff preferences (Plummer 2007, Baldwin 2006).\nThis section aims to provide an overview of the process of trade opening in the region \nand the current state of openness to trade. The discussion is based on three broad \nsets of indicators of openness to international trade, namely, the Sachs\u2013Warner binary \nclassification, revealed trade orientation measured as exports or total trade (exports + \nimports) as a percentage of GDP, and average tariff rate. All these measures have their \nshortcomings (as discussed below), but together they enable us to assert with reasonable \nconfidence whether an economy is broadly open.\nTable 1 depicts the patterns and chronology of liberalization status of Asian economies \nbased on the Sachs\u2013Warner binary index of trade regime shifts. The index classifies  \nthe postwar trade policy history of a given economy into two subperiods  \n(closed economy = 0 and open economy = 1) based on the timing of sustained trade \nopening.3 This is of course a somewhat blunt characterization of liberalization status. \nGiven the complexity of economic policy reform, a binary classification of liberalization \nstatus naturally involves a significant element of subjectivity (Rodriguez and Rodrik \n2000), simply binary (0/1) classification. However it has the attraction of a clear analytical \nfoundation, a long time series, and comprehensive country coverage.\nAccording to this classification, Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and Thailand \nhave always remained open throughout the postwar era. Japan; the Republic of Korea; \nand Taipei,China completed the transition from closed to open trade regimes by the \n1960s. By the turn of the century (the end point of the time coverage of Wacziarg and \nWelch 2003), only the PRC and Viet Nam, which are not covered in the classification, \nremained closed. However, in the ensuing years these two countries have undertaken \nsignificant tariff cuts (Table 2) and dismantled most nontrade barriers (NTBs) and \nrestrictions on foreign exchange dealings on current account transactions mainly as \n3  See Table 2, Note 1 for the criteria used in identifying the year of demarcation. The original Sachs\u2013Warner \nclassification covered 100 countries (78 developing and 22 developed countries) over the period 1945\u20131994.  \nWacziarg and Welch (2003) have updated the classification to 2000, while expanding the coverage to 131 \ncountries.", "Asian Trade Flows | 3\npart of their WTO accession commitments4 (Bergesten et al. 2009, Athukorala 2006). \nConsequently, from about 2005, the \u201csocialist economic system\u201d characterization remains \nthe only Sachs\u2013Warner closed economy criterion applicable to these countries.\nTable 1: Liberalization Status/Dates and Data on Trade Policy1\nData on Trade Policy (Sachs\u2013Warner criteria)\nLiberalization \nStatus/Dates  Average Tariff2 NTB Coverage3 Black-market Export Marketing \nduring1  (1990\u201399) (1990\u201398) Premium4 Boards/Socialist \n1945\u20132000 (%) (%) (1990\u201399) (%) State\nHong Kong, China Always open \u2014 2.1 -0.02 0\nMalaysia Always open 11.7 19.6 1.35 0\nSingapore Always open 0.32 2.1 0.8 0\nThailand Always open 29.54 17.5 1.8 0\nTaipei,China 1963 9.85 \u2014 0.95 0\nKorea, Rep. of 1968 11.3 25.0 0.03 0\nIndonesia 1970 16.27 31.3 7.1 0\nPhilippines 1988 19.09 \u2014 4.36 0\nPakistan 1991 54.73 \u2014 9.74 0\nIndia 1994 48.63 93.8 7.45 0\nChina, People's Rep. of5 Remains closed 31.06 \u2014 35.89 1\nNTB = nontrade barrier.\n\u2014 means exact figure is not available, but it is commonly believed to be well below the Sachs\u2013Warner criteria.\n1 Based on the application of Sachs\u2013Warner criteria, which classifies a country as open if does not  satisfy all these five criteria for \nthe entire duration of a give time period:  (i) Nontariff barrier coverage of intermediate and capital goods imports of 40% or more; \n(ii) Average tariff on intermediate and capital goods imports of 40% or more; (iii) A black market exchange rate that is depreciated \nby 20% or more relative to the official exchange rate;  (iv) A socialist economic system (as defined by Kornai 1992); and (v) A state \nmonopoly on major exports.\n2 Unweighted average tariff.\n3 Core nontariff barrier frequency on capital goods and intermediates, including quotas, licensing, prohibitions, and administered \npricing.\n4 [(parallel exchange rate/official exchange rate) \u2013 1]*100.\n5 Remains closed, based on the black market exchange rate premium.\nSources: Sachs and Warner 1995 and Wacziarg and Welch (2003).\nAverage applied most favored nation (MFN) tariff rates of ADEs are summarized in \nTable 2. It is important to note at the outset that tariff rates can be used to compare \ntrade openness across countries when there is little reliance on NTBs; in the presence \nof binding NTBs, tariff rates naturally tend to understate the trade-impeding impact of \nthe trade regime. Average tariff comparisons also need to allow for partial reforms. \nMost countries in the region have been compensating exporters for duties paid on \nimported inputs. These typically take the form of duty exemptions or drawbacks, or the \nestablishment of export processing zones. However there is evidence that almost all \ncountries in the region have dismantled most binding NTBs and scaled down selective \nincentives for export producers (Panagariya 2007, Krueger 2010). \n4  After the PRC\u2019s accession to membership in January 2001 and Viet Nam in January 2006, all 12 ADEs are now \nbound by WTO multilateral disciple.", "4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nTable 2: Average Applied Tariff  Rates1 in Asian Developing Economies, 1980\u20132004 \n(percent)\nEconomy/Group 1980\u20131984 1985\u20131989 1990\u20131994 1995\u20131999 2005\u20132006\nChina, People's Rep. of 49.5 39.3 40.0 18.8 12.8\nKorea, Rep. of 17.5 9.7 9.3 8.0\nTaipei,China 26.5 16.8 12.5 8.4 5.5\nIndonesia \u2014 13.7 13.4 6.4 8.5\nMalaysia \u2014 14.9 14.3 6.9 7.6\nSingapore \u2014 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2\nPhilippines 29.3 27.8 23.7 13.3 5.9\nThailand 41.2 40.3 37.2 19.6 8.9\nViet Nam \u2014 \u2014 13.4 13.7 14.4\nIndia  74.3 93.5 57.0 33.7 16.8\nPakistan 66.7 58.5 41.6 13.1\nMemo Items\n  Developing Countries 45.4 42 34.0 19.7 13.2\n  Low Income 73.3 64 46.7 23.1 15.7\n  Middle Income 32.9 28.9 27.3 15.0 9.5\n  High Income 22.9 9.1 0.4 3.6 2.8\n\u2014 means data not available.\n1  Simple averages of most favored nation rates.\nSources: Nicita and Olarreaga (2006) and WTO (2006).\nThere has been a universal trend toward lower tariffs across the ADEs over the past \n2 decades. In some economies, the declines have been very large, more than halving \nsince the 1980s as in the PRC; India; Japan; the Republic of Korea; the Philippines; \nTaipei,China; and Thailand. Within Asia, the East Asian economies are generally more \nopen than those of South Asia. In 2004, India and Pakistan had the highest average \ntariffs, with the Indian figure being three times that of the PRC. Hong Kong, China and \nSingapore have of course always had negligible protection. The average tariff rates in \nother countries mostly range up to 10%. Importantly, though not adequately recorded \nhere, the East Asian economies were much quicker than the two major South Asian \ncountries to adopt partial reforms that enabled exporters to operate on an effective free-\ntrade footing.\nThe export/GDP ratio,5 the standard revealed openness measure, is reported in Table 3. \nThe trade/GDP ratio is a comparison between a net and a gross concept; trade is \nmeasured in gross terms (intermediate material inputs + value added) whereas GDP \nis essentially measured on a value-added basis (that is, net of intermediate material \ninputs). Thus, the measured change in trade orientation is sensitive to changes in import \nintensity of export production. As will be seen later, over the past decade there has been \na palpable shift in the export composition away from primary products and toward labor-\nintensive light manufacturing and, more recently, the ongoing process of international \nproduction fragmentation within high-tech industries. The increase in measured trade \norientation could partly reflect the fact that these new product lines are relatively \n5  Exports are generally regarded as preferable to total trade (or imports) as the numerator in calculating this ratio \nbecause restrictiveness of a given country\u2019s policy regime is presumably better captured by export performance.", "Asian Trade Flows | 5\nmore import-intensive compared to the former. Another limitation for cross-country \ncomparisons is that the ratios need to be adjusted for size, in recognition of the fact \nthat small countries by definition will trade more than larger ones. However, as already \nnoted, the usefulness of this measure in its own right as an indicator of trade openness \nis limited because, by construct, it is driven by structural shifts in production and trade \npatterns. Of particular relevance in this connection is the ongoing process of international \nproduction fragmentation, which involves small value-added additions at various stages \nof the production process of a given final good in various countries, thus resulting in \ninflated trade values relative to GDP. Even in small countries, at least 60% of GDP is \ngenerated by nontradable sectors. Thus an export share of much more than 30%\u201340% \ncan arise only when export production involves adding fairly small amounts of value to \nimported inputs (Krugman 1995, 335). These limitations notwithstanding, the intercountry \ndifferences and the time profile revealed by this measure are broadly consistent with \nthose already observed.\nTable 3: Trade Orientation of Selected Asian Economies,1 1969/70\u20132006/07 (percent)\n1969/70 1974/75 1979/80 1984/85 1989/90 1994/5 1999/00 2006/7\nKorea, Rep. of 15 27 30 33 30 28 40 45\nChina, People's Rep. of 3 5 10 11 18 24 21 41\nHong Kong, China 92 85 90 108 131 138 138 206\nTaipei,China 18 23 33 39 42 43 51 70\nIndonesia 14 27 33 24 25 27 40 30\nMalaysia 40 45 56 54 73 92 121 114\nPhilippines 21 23 23 24 28 35 53 45\nSingapore 80 95 103 134 174 190 240\nThailand 16 20 24 23 35 41 64 73\nViet Nam \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 30 33 53 75\nIndia 4 6 7 5 7 11 13 22\nPakistan 8 13 12 10 15 17 14 15\nDeveloping Countries2 10 13 15 16 20 23 26 33\n\u2014 means data not available.\n1  Exports of goods and services relative to GDP (at current prices), 2-year averages.\n2  Low- and middle-income countries per the World Bank country classification.\nSources: World Bank, World Development Indicators Database; Taipei,China: Council for Economic Planning and Development; \nCambodia and Lao PDR: Asian Development Bank, Key Indicators Database.\nOpenness to trade is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful global \neconomic integration. Equally important is the conduciveness of the business \nenvironment. International competitiveness requires high quality infrastructure, \nboth hard and soft, especially for successful participation in time-sensitive global \nproduction and purchasing networks. Labor markets need to reflect underlying supply \nand demand conditions, with wage growth and differentials driven by productivity. \nPrudent macroeconomic management is required to provide a stable and predictable \ncommercial policy environment, and to ensure that exchange rate outcomes do not impair \ncompetitiveness. Above all, political stability and policy certainty figure prominently among \nprerequisites for profitable long-term investment, particularly for multinational enterprises \n(MNEs).", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nIn recent years there have been various attempts to build databases on the business \nenvironment of a large number of countries based on investor surveys or other subjective \nassessments covering large number of countries. Tables 4 and 5 show the rankings of \nADEs in two of these that have by far the widest country coverage among the alternative \ndatabases, namely, the Doingbusiness database and Logistic Performance Index (LPI) \ndatabase of the World Bank. Doingbusiness ranks countries (85 countries in the latest \nupdate) in terms of ease of doing business using 10 criteria. The LPI specifically focuses \non the quality of trade-related logistic provisions, based on a worldwide survey of global \nfreight forwarders and express carriers, complemented by a number of qualitative and \nquantitative indicators of the domestic logistics environment, institutions, and performance \nof supply chains.\nThe ease of doing business data summarized in Table 4 confirm the superiority of East \nAsia over South Asia, with the four Asian newly industrialized economies (NIEs)\u2014Hong \nKong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China\u2014along with Malaysia \nand Thailand ranking the highest. The PRC ranks ahead of India by a wide margin. The \ndifferences between Northeast and Southeast Asia are not significant. Nevertheless \nthis ranking exercise is at best indicative and also presumably reflects the development \nparadigms of the institution preparing the data. The PRC and Viet Nam fare poorly, in \nspite of the sweeping reforms of the past 2 decades, and even when they are obviously \ncommercially attractive to foreign investors. Naturally the country ranking in terms of \nthe LPI (Table 5) is remarkably similar to that based on the Doingbusiness database. \nSingapore tops the overall logistics quality raking. The other major transshipment hub \nin the region, Hong Kong, China, is fourth on the global ranking and second among \nADEs. The data also reveal significant differences among countries at similar levels of \ndevelopment. Countries in Northeast and Southeast Asia have higher rankings.

The \ncombined share of ADEs in total world merchandise exports increased continuously from \nless than 5% in 1970 to 22% by 2008 (Figure 1a).6 The region accounted for over a third \nof total increment in world exports over this period. Focusing on world nonoil trade (trade \nnet of oil and gas) to gain a better comparative picture,7 the increase in ADEs\u2019 world \nexport share turns out to be even sharper, from about 4% in the early 1970s to over \nnearly 25% in 2008 (Figure 1b).\nThe rise of the PRC has been a dominant factor behind the share increase in the ADEs\u2019 \nworld market shares from about the early 1990s. But the upward trend in world market \nshares of the other countries that began in the early 1970s has continued unabated \nthroughout the period. Thus, on first inspection, there is no indication of the PRC \n\u201ccrowding out\u201d its neighbors\u2500the PRC\u2019s market share gains has been at the expense of \nthat of the rest of the world, not from the rest of Asia. This observation is consistent with \nthe inferences coming from a number of recent studies that have systematically examined \nthe impact of the PRC\u2019s rise in export performance on the other countries in the region \n(Athukorala 2009, Greenaway at al. 2008, Eichengreen et al. 2007).\nAt the individual country level, market share gains have varied notably over time \n(Table 1).8 Among the nine largest ADEs, only Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; and the \nPhilippines have smaller world trade shares than India, which is by far the dominant \nSouth Asian economy. Notwithstanding the notable export expansion in recent years, \nIndia still accounts for a mere 1.1% of total world trade, equivalent to less than 5% of \nADEs\u2019 total trade. Pakistan is the only country among the 12 ADEs to record a decline \nin market share (other than Hong Kong, China, whose export production base has \n\u201cmigrated\u201d to the PRC since about the early 1990s).\nRapid export growth in developing Asia has been underpinned by a pronounced \nshift in export structure away from primary commodities and toward manufactures \n(Table 6). From about the early 1990s, manufactures accounted for over four fifths of \ntotal merchandise exports from these economies, up from 84.3% in 1969/1970 some \n4 decades ago. Given the nature of their resource endowments, the four Asian NIEs \n(Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China) relied very heavily \non manufacturing for export expansion from the outset. However, beginning in the 1970s, \na notable shift toward manufacturing is observable across all economies, at varying \nspeeds and intensity. The combined shares of the ASEAN countries other than Singapore \nincreased from a mere 11% to 71.0% between these two time points. Among individual \n6  Trade data throughout the paper are measured in current US dollars unless otherwise indicated.  \n7  Oil and gas account for a significant (albeit declining) share in export only in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.  \n8  In this and other trade data tables, data are presented as 2-year averages to smooth out the impact of yearly \nfluctuations in trade.", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\ncountries, Indonesia and Viet Nam had a significantly lower share of manufactures in their \nexports, reflecting both their comparative advantage and their later adoption of export-\noriented industrialization strategies.\nFigure 1a: Share in Total World  Merchandise Trade:\nAsian Developing Economies and the PRC, 1970\u20132008 (percent)\n25.0\n20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\n0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8\n7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\nExports: ADEs Imports: ADEs Exports: PRC Imports: PRC\nFigure 1b:  Share in World  Nonoil Trade:\nAsian Developing Economies and the PRC, 1970\u20132008 (percent)\n30.00\n25.00\n20.00\n15.00\n10.00\n5.00\n0.00\n0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8\n7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\nExports: ADEs Imports: ADEs Exports: PRC Imports: PRC\nSource:  Based on data compiled from the UN Comtrade database.", "Asian Trade Flows | 11\nTable 6: Developing Asia in World Trade (percent)\nTotal (nonoil) Trade Manufacturing Trade Manufacturing Share  \nin Total Exports\n1969/70 1989/90 2007/8 1969/70 1989/90 2007/8 1969/70 1989/90 2007/8\n(a ) Exports\nDeveloping  Asia 4.7 13.4 24.4 3.1 14 27.4 44.3 84.3 84.9\n   PRC 0.8 2.9 12.7 0.5 3 14.9 45.1 83.6 93.4\n   Hong Kong, China 0.9 1.7 0.6 1.3 2 0.6 95.1 96.5 89.3\n   Korea, Rep. of 0.3 2.2 3.0 0.3 2.6 3.5 75.4 93.6 87.6\n   Taipei,China 0.6 2.7 2.0 0.6 3.1 2.4 71.5 91.9 91.8\n   Indonesia 0.3 0.5 0.9 0 0.4 0.6 3.8 55.6 41.5\n   Malaysia 0.8 1.0 1.6 0.1 0.7 1.6 7.2 60.4 70.9\n   Philippines 0.5 0.3 0.6 0.1 0.3 0.6 10.3 62.8 83.8\n   Singapore 0.2 1.1 1.2 0.1 1.3 1.4 45.9 91.2 70.6\n   Thailand 0.3 0.8 1.3 0 0.6 1.3 7.7 59.6 76.5\n   Viet Nam 0.4 0 0 0.3 13.5 59.2\n   India 0.9 0.6 1.1 0.7 0.5 1.1 71.5 67.7\n   Pakistan  0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 71.8 80.9\nMemo items\nEast Asia 11 23.8 30.7 12 26.7 34.8 72.5 90.3 86.6\n    Japan 6.3 10.4 4.6 8.9 12.7 7.4 93.4 98 93.2\nNAFTA 25.5 17.5 13.8 24.1 16.2 13.6 62.8 74.5 71.1\nEU15 46.3 41.1 34.3 53.4 42.2 34.9 76.6 82.7 77.4\nDeveloping countries 14.7 20.9 44.4 5.9 19.3 44.0 26.8 74.2 61.2\nDeveloped countries 85.3 79.1 55.6 94.1 80.7 56.0 73.3 82.2 75.2\nWorld 100 100 100.0 100 100 0.0 66.5 80.6 68.3\n    US$ billion 205 2386 12056 137 1922 9766\n(b)  Imports\nDeveloping East Asia 5.1 12.9 20.4 5.3 13.3 21.1 69.7 83 71.4\n  PRC 0 2.3 7.8 0 2.3 7.7 81 70.0\n  Hong Kong, China 1.3 3.1 3.4 1.3 3.4 3.9 69.5 87.5 90.2\n  Korea, Rep. of 0.9 2.3 2.2 0.8 2.2 2.2 59.9 74.8 59.2\n  Taipei,China 0.6 1.7 1.4 0.6 1.7 1.4 69.7 80.1 76.2\n  Indonesia 0.4 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.8 0.6 80.7 83 57.7\n  Malaysia 0.5 1 1.1 0.5 1 1.1 63.9 85.6 72.3\n  Philippines 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.3 0.4 77.3 76.4 65.3\n  Singapore 0.9 1.9 1.9 0.9 2.1 2.1 63.7 87.4 68.6\n  Thailand 0.5 1.1 1.1 0.7 1.1 1.1 85.9 84.1 68.5\n  Viet Nam 0 0 0.5 0 0 0.5 60.3 69.3\n  India 1.2 0.7 1.3 1.6 0.7 1.2 94.9 77.7 46.6\n  Pakistan  0.7 0.2 0.2 0 0.2 0.2 0 68.1 51.1\nMemo items 0.0 0.0 0.0\nEast Asia 11.6 19.9 24.4 8.3 18.3 24.6 47.6 74.1 67.0\nJapan 6.5 7 0.6 3 5 3.6 30.4 57.7 49.3\nNAFTA 25 17.4 20.0 20.9 15.8 19.1 55.5 73.1 66.0\nEU15 45.5 40.8 35.4 46.2 41.1 34.5 67.7 81.1 67.9\nDeveloping countries 16.5 21.6 40.1 18.6 21.4 40.2 74.9 80 68.3\nDeveloped countries 83.5 78.4 59.9 81.4 78.6 59.8 64.8 80.7 67.4\nWorld 100 100 100.0 100 100 0.0 66.5 80.6 67.8\n    US$ billion 205 2386 12056 137 1922 9766\nEU = European Union, NAFTA = North American Free Trade Agreement, PRC = People's Republic of China.\n1  Excluding Asian developing economies.\n2  Excluding Japan.\n3  Based on the United Nations country classification.\nSources: Compiled from UN Comtrade database and Trade Data CD-ROM; for Taipei,China: Council for Economic Planning and \nDevelopment.", "12 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nWithin manufacturing, machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) played a pivotal role \nin the structural shift in the export composition of ADEs (Tables 7 and 8). The share \nof machinery and transport equipment in the export structures of some of the more \nindustrialized economies of East Asia is particularly high. By contrast, that for Indonesia, \nViet Nam, and all of South Asia is much smaller. Within the machinery and transport \nequipment category, information and communication techology (ICT) products have been \nthe most dynamic component of Asian export expansion. By 2007/2008, over 58% of total \nworld ICT exports originated from Asia, up from 30.8% in 1994/1995 (Table 8); the PRC \naccounted for 25.4% of total world ICT exports, up from 4.2% in 1994/1995.

Global Production Sharing \nThe fast growth of machinery trade in Asia has been driven by rapid growth of \ninternational fragmentation of production in world trade and the increasingly deep \nintegration of East Asian countries into the global production networks (Athukorala 2005, \nNg and Yeats 2003). Linking Southeast Asia to the global electronics production networks \nbegan in 1968 with the arrival of two US companies, National Semiconductors and \nTexas Instruments, which set up plants in Singapore to assemble semiconductor devices \n(Athukorala 2008). From about the late 1970s, the MNEs with production facilities in \nSingapore began to relocate some low-end assembly activities in neighboring countries \n(particularly in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand) in response to the rapid growth of \nwages and land prices. Many newcomer MNEs to the region also set up production bases \nin these countries, bypassing Singapore. From about the early 1990s the emergence \nof the PRC as the global factory of electrical and electrical goods assembly based on \nparts and components imported from other countries contributed to rapid expansion of \nproduction networks in the region. More recently, regional production networks have \nbegun to expand to Viet Nam. Over the past 3 decades, the process of global production \nsharing has created a new division of labor among countries in the region, based on skill \ndifferences involved in different stages of the production process and relative wages, and \nimproved communication and transport infrastructure (Ando and Kimura 2010). As will \nbe seen below, the formation of production networks has dramatically transformed the \nspatial patterns of international trade in the region, with a notable \u201cmagnification\u201d effect on \nrecorded trade flows operating through multiple border-crossing of parts and components \non the expansion of intraregional trade.\nThe most ubiquitous indicator of the intensity of fragmentation-based specialization in \nworld trade is the share of parts and components in total manufacturing trade (Table 9, \nPanel A).9 Over the past 2 decades there has been a sharp increase in the share \nof parts and components (henceforth referred to as components for brevity) in world \nmanufacturing trade from 19.3% in 1992/1993 to 27.1% in 2006/2007 (Table 9). This \nshare has increased at much faster rate in ADEs, from 17.3% to 34.0%.

The PRC\u2019s manufacturing trade patterns differ from its \nEast Asian neighbors. In particular, the components share in the total manufacturing \nimports of the PRC (44% in 2006/2007) is much larger compared to the corresponding \nshare in its manufacturing exports (25.6%). This difference between the PRC and the \nother countries in the region is consistent with the earlier observation that the PRC\u2019s rise \nin world trade has brought about a notable shift in the division of labor within regional \nproduction networks, with ASEAN countries playing an increasing role in producing \nparts and components for the rapidly growing final assembly activities in the PRC. The \nbulk of components used in final assembly in the PRC come from other countries in the \nregion.

Intraregional Trade\nA notable outcome of the rapid expansion of production networks has been been the \nrapid growth of cross-border trade in parts and components within the regions. For \ninstance, in 2006/2007, components accounted for 53.9% of intra-ADE exports (59.5% \nof imports) compared to 34.0% in the regions total exports (44.2% of total imports). \nInterestingly component share in intra-ADE trade is much higher compared to that of \nintraregional trade in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the EU-15. \nDriven largely by component trade, the share of intraregional nonoil trade in total world \ntrade of ADEs increased continuously from about 20% in 1985 to over 52% by 2008 \n(Figure 2). Until about the late 1990s, both intraregional trade shares of imports exports \nclosely moved together. However, the time pattern has changed notably from then on. \nWhile the intraregional impost share has continued to increase at a faster rate, the \nintraregional export-to-GDP ratio virtually stagnated or recorded a mild decline in some \nyears. Consequently, the rate of increase in total intraregional trade share has remarkably \nslowed. This notably asymmetry in the growth of intraregional exports and imports (and \nthe consequent slow expansion in total intraregional trade) is a reflection of East Asia\u2019s \nunique role within global production networks, in particular the PRC\u2019s role as the premier \nassembly center within these networks based on parts and components procured from \nthe rest of East Asia (Athukorala 2009).", "Asian Trade Flows | 19\nFigure 2: Intraregional Trade Shares of ADEs, 1986\u20132007 (percent)\na.

The CEPII distance measure is a \ncomposite measure of the bilateral great-circle distance between major cities of each \neconomy compiled by taking into account the trading significance of each city in each \neconomy. Export shares for 2000 are used in compiling the distance measure for each \neconomy. For a complete listing of variables and data sources see Appendix Table 1.\nA.  Trade Equations\nOf the three standard panel data estimation methods (pooled ordinary least squares \n[OLS], random effects, and fixed effects estimators), the fixed effect estimator is \nnot appropriate in this case because the model contains a number of time-invariant \nexplanatory variables that are central to the analysis. In experimental runs, both pooled \nOLS and random-effects estimators are used. The Bruesch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier \ntest failed to reject the null hypothesis of random effects, favoring the use of pooled \nOLS estimator. The preferred (pooled OLS) estimates are reported in Table 12. Note \nthat PGDP and PGDP could not be retained in the final estimates because of their high \nI J \ncorrelation with the counterpart GDP variables. Common border dummy was deleted in \nthe final estimates because of its high correlation with the distance variable.\nThe coefficients of the two standard gravity variables (GDP in pairs, and the distance) \nare statistically significant with the hypotheses signs in all cases. The coefficient of the \ndistance variable is well within the range of 0.7\u20131.20 commonly found in various gravity \nmodel applications. The coefficient of GDP in pairs is consistently closer to unity. The \nLPI performs remarkably well in explaining both imports and exports, with statistically \nsignificant and positive coefficients in all cases. The other control variables are not \nuniformly significant across all countries, both on import and export sides. These variables \nhave been retained in a given equation only if the coefficients carried the expected sign \nwith a t-ratio of more than unity. In terms of the overall fit the export equations generally \nperforms better (with R2 s of closer to 0.80) than the import equations (R2s of around \n0.65). As one would expect, estimated equations (both exports and imports) for nonoil \ntrade generally exhibit a better overall fit compared to those for total trade.

Trade Projections\nThe estimated equations are used for predicting trade flows for the period 2010\u20132030. \nThe methodology involved estimating total trade for each country as the sum of bilateral \ntrade flows estimated using the estimated import and export equations. In making these \nprojections, GDP projections generated in this research project are used for the ADEs. \nGDP projections for the other trading partner countries of ADEs come from the USDA \ndatabase.\nTrade flow projections (US$ billion) for total merchandise trade and nonoil merchandise \ntrade for the ADEs are reported in Appendix Table 2. It is important note that these \nperditions are based on the assumption that the past trade patterns will continue \nunchanged for the ensuing 2 decades. In reality, the nature of trade orientation of an \neconomy changes with the passage of time reflecting both structural changes in the \ndomestic economy and changes in global trade patterns. The following discussion \nfocuses on predictions for nonoil trade because the degree of dependence on oil and gas \ntrade varies significantly among the countries. \nAnnual growth rates of projected trade flows are reported in Table 12. Total nonoil exports \nfrom ADEs are projected to grow at an annual rate of 7.9% during 2010\u20132020 and 9.9% \nduring 2020\u20132030 (Table 12, panel a). Predicted growth rates of imports for the two \nsubperiods are 8.4% and 6.8%, respectively. A comparison of the estimates on export \nand import sides points to a mild tendency for narrowing of the overall trade deficit of the \nregion over the years. The annual growth rate of exports from the PRC is projected to \ndecline from 10.4% during 2010\u20132020 to 8.1% between the 2 decades. Predicted import \nand export growth rates varies notably among the 12 economies, with significant slowing \ndown of trade expansion in three NIEs (the Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China) \ncompared to the other countries. Overall the estimates point to a notable convergence in \nthe rate of trade expansion among the countries over the years.\nIntraregional nonoil trade in ADEs are projected to grow at a slightly faster rate compared \nto their overall (global) trade (compare figures reported in Panel A and B in Table 12). \nExports from these countries to regional markets during 2010\u20132030 will grow at 9.2% \ncompared to 8.5% growth in the region\u2019s total exports. The comparable figures on \nthe import side are 8.4% and 7.1%, respectively. During these 2 decades the PRC\u2019s \nintraregional exports are protected to grow at 10.5% compared to an overall export \ngrowth rate of 9.2%. In all other countries intraregional trade would also grow at a \nfaster rate compared to overall trade, driven by trade expansion associated with faster \neconomic growth.", "28 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nReflecting these growth rate differentials between intraregional and total trade, \nintraregional share in total trade of ADEs will increase continuously during 2000\u20132030 \n(Table 13, Figure 3). Intraregional nonoil export share in ADEs would reach 64.9% in \n2030 from 56.9% in 2010. The increase on the import side would be from 53.5% to \n59.5%. Intraregional trade shares are predicted to increase in all countries in the region, \nwith those of the second-tier ADEs increasing at a faster rate compared to the Republic \nof Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. The PRC\u2019s intraregional export and import shares \nare predicted to increase from 51.6% to 59.6%, and 41.7% to 81.9%, respectively, \nbetween 2010 and 2030. \nTrade openness of the region, measured by the trade-to-GDP ratio, is projected to \nincrease sharply from 39.4% in 2010 to 74.4% in 2030. Among the 12 economies, \nHong Kong, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and the Philippines are notable for maintaining \nvery high trade/GDP ratios for a long period of time (Krugman 1995). By the end of the \nprojection period, Thailand and Viet Nam too are likely to join this group of \u201csuper trading \neconomies\u201d. The PRC\u2019s degree of trade openness is projected to increase from 41.7% in \n2010 to 81.9% in 2030. The degree of trade openness of India and Pakistan is projected \nto remain low compared to their East Asian counterparts. As already noted, these figures \nneed to be treated with caution: they are based on the assumption that patterns of trade \npertaining to the estimation period 1986\u20132008 will continue unchanged during the ensuing \n2 decades. In particular, it is important to take into account the likely impact of the current \npolicy emphasis in the PRC on rebalancing growth.", "Asian Trade Flows | 29\nd.\ne\nal Es 11098069122222229997990

Concluding Remarks\nDeveloping Asian economies have become increasingly open to foreign trade and \ninvestment over the past 4 decades, but still there are notable contrasts patterns \nbetween East and South Asia, particularly between the PRC and India, notwithstanding \nconverging growth rates. India and other South Asian countries have continued to remain \nunderperformers. \nGlobal production sharing has become an integral part of the economic landscape of \nEast Asia. The degree of dependence on this new form of international specialization \nis proportionately larger in East Asia, in particular in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), than in North America and Europe. A highly important recent \ndevelopment in international fragmentation of production has been the rapid integration \nof the PRC into the regional production networks. This development is an important \ncounterpoint to the popular belief that the PRC\u2019s global integration would crowd out other \ncountries\u2019 opportunities for international specialization. The PRC\u2019s imports of components \nfrom countries in ASEAN and other developing East Asia countries have grown rapidly, \nin line with the equally rapid expansion of manufacturing exports from the PRC to \nextraregional markets, mostly North America and Europe. \nThe PRC\u2019s emergence as a major trading power and an investment location is not a \nzero sum proposition from the perspective of the region. The PRC\u2019s rapid integration \ninto regional production networks is an important counterpoint to the popular belief that \nits global integration would crowd out other countries\u2019 opportunities for international \nspecialization. The PRC\u2019s imports of components from countries in ASEAN and other \ndeveloping East Asian countries have grown rapidly, in line with the equally rapid \nexpansion of manufacturing exports from the PRC to extraregional markets, mostly North \nAmerica and Europe. The PRC\u2019s pivotal role with regional production networks also \nseems to have added further dynamism to regionwide MNE operations. The migration of \nsome production processes within vertically integrated high-tech industries to the PRC \nopens up opportunities for producing original-equipment-manufactured goods and back- \noffice service operations in other countries. Even if the PRC continues to remain relatively \nattractive as an assembly center, not all stages of production within vertically integrated \nglobal industries are going to move there; supply chain managers are reluctant to source \nall of their inputs from just one nation, preferring instead to diversify the risk of exchange \nrate instability or supply disruptions. There is also evidence that rapid growth in wages \nhas already begun to erode some of the PRC\u2019s cost advantages, encouraging firms in \nthe PRC to relocate labor-intensive manufacturing activities to low-wage countries in the \nregion.\nA notable outcome of the rapid expansion of production networks has been the rapid \ngrowth of cross-border trade in parts and components within the regions; component \nshare in intra-ADE trade is much higher compared to that of intraregional trade in NAFTA ", "34 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 241\nand EU-15. Driven largely by cross-border component trade, the share of intraregional \nnonoil trade in total world trade of ADEs increased continuously from about 20% in 1985 \nto over 52% by 2008. The intraregional share of imports has increased at a much faster \nrate compared to the intraregional share of exports, reflecting ADEs\u2019 unique role within \nglobal production networks, in particular the PRC\u2019s role as the premier assembly center \nwithin these networks based on components procured from the other countries in the \nregion. \nAccording to projections based on the standard gravity modelling framework, total nonoil \nexports and imports from ADEs would increase at an annual rate of 8.5% and 7.8% \nduring 2010\u20132030, exhibiting a mild slowdown in the rate of growth over time. The growth \nof intraregional trade would be about 1.2 percentage points faster, resulting in an increase \nin intraregional share in total exports and imports of countries in the region from 53.5% to \n9.5%, and 56.9% to 63.3%, respectively.

Data for Taipei,China are obtained from the trade \ndatabase (based on the same classification system) of the Council for Economic Planning and \nDevelopment.\nTo analyze the growing importance of regional production networks in determining trade patterns, \ndetailed (5-digit) data for the period 1992\u20132008 are used. Although the SITC Rev. 3 was \nintroduced in the mid-1980s, a close examination of country-level data shows that data recording \nsystems in many countries had considerable gaps in the coverage parts and components trade \nuntil the early 1990s. Therefore 1992 is used as the starting year for data disaggregation. \nIn previous studies of international production fragmentation and trade patterns (e.g., Ng and \nYeats 2003, Athukorala 2005, Athukorala and Yamashita 2008) commodity coverage was limited \nto parts and components, which can be directly identifiable based on the commodity nomenclature \nof the US Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). These items are confined to the \nproduct classes of machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) and SITC 8. However, there is \nevidence that global production sharing has been spreading beyond SITC 7 and 8 to other product \ncategories, such as pharmaceutical and chemical products (SITC 5) and machine tools and \nvarious metal products (SITC 6). This study uses a list of parts and components encompassing the \nentire spectrum of manufacturing trade. The list was compiled by mapping parts and components \nin the UN Broad Economic Classification (BEC) Registry (available at http:/www. unstats.un.org/\nunsd/cr/registry) in the product list of the WTO Information Technology Agreement with the \nHarmonized System (HS) of trade classification at the 6-digit level. Information gathered from firm-\nlevel surveys conducted in Malaysia and Thailand as part of this author\u2019s ongoing research in this \nfield was used to fill gaps in the list. Data compiled at the HS 6-digit level were converted to SITC \nfor the final analysis using the UN HS-SITC concordance.\nThere is no hard and fast rule applicable to distinguishing between parts and components and \nassembled products in international trade data. The only practical way of doing this is to focus \non the specific industries in which network trade is heavily concentrated. Once these industries \nare identified, assembly trade can be tentatively estimated as the difference between parts \nand components, directly identified based on the list here, and recorded trade in these product \ncategories (Krugman 2008). This is the procedure followed here. Guided by the available literature \non production sharing, seven product categories are identified: office machines and automatic \ndata processing machines (SITC 75), telecommunication and sound recording equipment (SITC \n76), semiconductors and semiconductor devices (SITC 772 and 776), electrical goods (SITC \n77-772-776), road vehicles (SITC 78), professional and scientific equipment  (SITC 87), and \nphotographic apparatus (SITC 88). It is quite reasonable to assume that these product categories \ncontain virtually no products produced from start to finish in a given country. Admittedly however, \nthe estimates based on this list do not provide a full coverage of final assembly in world trade. \nFor instance, outsourcing of final assembly does takes place in various miscellaneous product \ncategories such as clothing, furniture, sport goods, and leather products. However, it is not \npossible to meaningfully delineate parts and components and assembled goods in reported \ntrade in these product categories because they contain a significant (though unknown) share \nof \u201chorizontal\u201d trade. Likewise, assembly activities in software trade have recorded impressive \nexpansion in recent years, but these are lumped together in the UN data system with \u201cspecial \ntransactions\u201d under SITC 9. However, the magnitude of the bias resulting from the failure to ", "Asian Trade Flows | 39\ncover these items is unlikely to be substantial because network trade in final assembly is heavily \nconcentrated in the product categories covered in the decomposition.\nThe data are tabulated using importer records, which are considered to be more appropriate for \nanalyzing trade patterns than the corresponding exporter records. It is generally believed that data \ncompiled from importer records are less susceptible to recording errors, and reveal the origins and \ncomposition of trade more accurately than other records, because there are normally important \nlegal penalties for incorrectly specifying this information on customs declarations. Importer records \nare also presumably less susceptible to double-counting and erroneous identification of the source/\ndestination country in the presence of entrepot trade, for example, the PRC\u2019s trade through Hong \nKong, China; and Indonesia\u2019s trade through Singapore (Ng and Yeats 2003,  Feenstra et al. 2005).\nAppendix Table 1: Variables Construction and Data Sources for Gravity Model Estimation\nLabel  Definition  Data Source/Variable Construction\nX, M Value of bilateral trade (imports and exports)  in  Exports (at CIF price, US$): compiled from \nUS$ measured at constant (2000) prices.  importer records of  UN-COMTRADE online  \ndatabase.

Total real nonoil trade of ADEs is predicted to increase \nat an average annual rate of 8.2 % during the next two decades, with a notable convergence of \nindividual countries\u2019 rates to the regional average. The share of intraregional trade in total nonoil \ntrade would increase steadily from 53% in 2010 to 58% in 2030.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. WPS113392\n< 0113 3929 >\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Prema-chandra Athukorala", "CreationDate": "D:20110413150726+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "Asian trade, trade patterns, global production sharing, economic working paper no. 241", "ModDate": "D:20110413164354+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "This paper provides trade flow projections for major Asian developing economies (ADEs) up to 2030 against the backdrop of an in-depth analysis of policy shifts and trade patterns over the past 4 decades. Merchandise trade of ADEs has grown at a much faster rate in the global context, with a distinct intraregional bias. Global production sharing has become a unique feature of the economic landscape of the region, with the People\u2019s Republic of China playing a pivotal complementary role as the premier assembly center within the regional production networks. According to the projections made within the standard gravity modelling framework, total real nonoil trade of ADEs would increase at an average annual rate of 8.2 during the next 2 decades, with a notable convergence of individual countries\u2019 rates to the regional average. The share of intraregional trade in total nonoil trade would increase steadily from 53% in 2010 to 58% in 2030.  The trade-to-GDP ratio would increase from 39.4% and 74.4% between these 2 years. These predictions need to be treated with caution as they are based on the assumption that the trade structure pertaining to the estimation period will remain unchanged in the next 2 decades.", "Title": "Asian Trade Flows: Trends, Patterns, and Projections (No. 241)", "Trapped": "False"}}
