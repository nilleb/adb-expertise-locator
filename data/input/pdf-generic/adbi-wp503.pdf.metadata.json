In  order  to  overcome \ndeflation and achieve sustainable economic growth, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently set an \ninflation target of 2% and implemented an aggressive monetary policy so this target could be \nachieved  as  soon  as  possible.  Although  prices  started  to  rise  after  the  BOJ  implemented \nmonetary  easing,  this  may  have  been  for  other  reasons,  such  as  higher  oil  prices.  Oil \nbecame expensive as a result of the depreciated Japanese yen and this was one of the main \ncauses  of  the  rise  in  inflation.  This  paper  shows  that  quantitative  easing  may  not  have \nstimulated  the  Japanese  economy  either.  Aggregate  demand,  which  includes  private \ninvestment,  did  not  increase  significantly  in  Japan  with  lower  interest  rates.  Private \ninvestment  displays  this  unconventional  behavior  because  of  uncertainty  about  the  future \nand because Japan\u2019s population is aging. We believe that the remedy for Japan\u2019s economic \npolicy  is  not  to  be  found  in  monetary  policy.  The  government  needs  to  implement  serious \nstructural changes and growth strategies. \n\n \nJEL Classification: E47, E52, Q41, Q43 \n\n \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n        Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................ 3 \n\n1.1 \n1.2 \n1.3 \n\nJapan\u2019s Stagnant Economy after the Bubble Bursts ....................................... 3 \nRecent Monetary Policy of the Bank of Japan ................................................ 5 \nHow Higher Energy Prices Can Create Inflation ............................................. 5 \n\nModel......................................................................................................................... 7 \n\nEmpirical Analysis...................................................................................................... 9 \n\n3.1 \n3.2 \n\nData Analysis ................................................................................................. 9 \nEmpirical Results ......................................................................................... 10 \n\n4. \n\nConcluding Remarks ............................................................................................... 13 \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 14 \n\n \n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\n ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nIn  the  early  1990s,  Japan\u2019s  real  estate  and  stock  market  bubble  burst  and  the  economy  went \ninto  a  tailspin.  Since  then,  Japan  has  suffered  from  sluggish  economic  growth.  Almost  2 \ndecades  later, the  collapse  of Lehman  Brothers  in  September  2008  sparked  a global financial \ncrisis that threatened the entire world economy. This was followed by a catastrophic earthquake \nand tsunami that struck northeastern Japan in March 2011. Japan\u2019s government budget deficit-\nto-gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  ratio  breached  200%  in  2010,  mainly  because  of  the  high \nshare of pension fund payments in government spending, and the efficiency and effectiveness \nof  public  investment  was  called  into  question.  The  Japanese  economy  required  a  stimulus  to \nescape  from  this  pattern  of  long-term  sluggish  growth.  In  December  2012,  the  Liberal \nDemocratic  Party  won  a  general  election,  making  Shinzo  Abe  the  prime  minister  of  Japan,  a \npost that he had previously held in 2007. \u201cAbenomics\u201d refers to the economic policies advocated \nby  the  prime  minister  after  the  election,  which  were  designed  to  revive  the  sluggish  economy \nwith \u201cthree arrows\u201d: (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) more aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of \nJapan,  and  (iii)  structural  reforms  to  boost  Japan\u2019s  competitiveness  and  economic  growth \n(Yoshino  and Taghizadeh  2014a). The  Bank  of  Japan  settled  on  an  inflation  target  of 2%  and \nimplemented a monetary easing policy.  \n\nIn this paper we focus on the government\u2019s aggressive policy of monetary easing and pose two \nquestions.  First,  does  Japanese  aggregate  demand,  which  includes  private  investment, \nincrease  significantly  when  the  interest  rate  drops  following  an  easing  of  monetary  policy? \nSecond, has the inflation rate in Japan been affected by the aggressive monetary easing policy \npursued by the Bank of Japan, or are there other reasons for the increase in the inflation rate, \nsuch as higher oil prices? In order to answer these questions, in the first section of the paper we \nexplain the reasons for Japan\u2019s stagnant economy. We then attempt to shed some light on the \nBOJ\u2019s  recent  monetary  policy  and  to  explain  how  higher  energy  prices  increased  inflation  in \nJapan.  In  the  second  section,  we  develop  our  model.  In  the  third  section  we  conduct  the \nempirical analysis and in the fourth we present the paper\u2019s concluding remarks. \n\n1.1  Japan\u2019s Stagnant Economy after the Bubble Bursts \n\nThe  sudden  imposition  of  tight  monetary  policy  in  1990  pushed  land  and  stock  prices  down \nabout  one-third  from  their  peak  level.  The  annual  real  growth  rate  of  the  economy  was  below \n2% for most of the 1990s and the unemployment rate rose to almost 5% in 2002 and 2003. Paul \nKrugman  has  argued  that  Japan  is  currently  in  a  liquidity  trap;1 a  situation  in  which  monetary \npolicy is ineffective in lowering interest rates. However, our empirical analysis indicates that the \nproblems of the Japanese economy stem from other sources.  \n\nAggregate demand, which includes private investment, has not increased significantly in Japan \nwith  lower  interest  rates.  Private  investment  displays  this  unconventional  behavior  because  of \nuncertainty  about  the  future  and  because  Japan\u2019s  population  is  aging.  In  other  words,  the \ncurrent monetary policy has not been effective. \n\nThe  large  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  of  Japan  to  other  Asian  countries  has  shifted  the \ninvestment\u2013saving (IS) curve to the left, as shown in Figure 1. In such circumstances, because \nmonetary  policy  is  ineffective,  fiscal  policy  needs  to  be  used  to  shift  the  IS  curve  back  to  the \nright so that the economy can recover. However, the dilemma in Japan is that, despite the huge \nincrease  in  government  investment,  the  IS  curve  has  not  shifted  enough  to  the  right.  This  is \n\n                                                \n1 http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/1998%202/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nbecause  the  effectiveness  of  public  works  has  drastically  diminished,  compared  with  that \nundertaken during the period of high growth (Yoshino and Nakahigashi 2000). \n\nFigure 1: The Ineffectiveness of Monetary Policy in Japan \n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \n\nSource: Yoshino and Sakakibara (2002). \n\n \n\n \n\nPublic  investment  has  not  had  a  sufficient  impact  on  Japan\u2019s  gross  national  product  (GNP) \nbecause it has been distributed ineffectively. The bulk of the increase in public investment has \nbeen  concentrated  in  the  countryside,  where  it  has  had  a  much  smaller  impact  than  it  would \nhave had in urban areas. Public investment in the agricultural sector has also been much less \neffective  than  in  the  industrial  and  service  sectors.  The  result  of  this  increasing  rural  and \nagricultural bias in the allocation of public investment is that the multiplier of public investment \nhas declined sharply (Yoshino, Kaji, and Kameda 1998). This means that public investment has \nonly increased budget deficits; it has been unable to bring about the recovery of the Japanese \neconomy. \n\nSeveral other factors have contributed to the stagnant economy in the last 2 decades: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  bursting  of  the  bubble  was  followed  by  a  credit  crunch  because  banks \nwere  less  willing  to  make  investment  loans.  Falling  land  prices  made  them \nreluctant to make loans because of the anticipated fall in the value of collateral. \nPrudential  measures \nin  1998,  as  well  as  higher  capital \nrequirements, forced banks to reduce the number of loans they made by even \nfurther.  The  growing  proportion  of  nonperforming  loans  in  the  banks\u2019  loan \nportfolios  meant  that  they  reduced  their  lending  in  order  to  build  up  their  loss \nprovisions.  The  failures  of  several  large  financial  institutions  also  reduced  the \navailability of loans. \n\nintroduced \n\nCapital  flows  became  more  sensitive  to  interest  rates.  Lower  interest  rates  in \nJapan  encouraged  an  outflow  of  investment  to  the  United  States  (US)  and \nother countries (Yoshino and Sakakibara 2002). \n\nThe level of consumption has decreased. The fall in the propensity to consume \nhas  been  mainly  a  result  of  workers\u2019  concerns  about  possible  layoffs.  In \naddition, the fall in asset prices has lowered consumption, including that of the \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\ncorporate  sector,  because  Japanese  companies and  individuals  are  no  longer \nas  wealthy  as  they  were.  Another  reason  for  the  decrease  in  the  level  of \nconsumption is the demographic change. Japan\u2019s biggest problem is its aging \npopulation. The number of elderly and retired people is rising while the younger \ngeneration is shrinking, and usually elderly people consume less than younger \ngenerations. \n\n1.2  Recent Monetary Policy of the Bank of Japan  \n\nThe Government of Japan and the BOJ delivered a joint statement on overcoming deflation and \nachieving sustainable economic growth on 22 January 2013. The BOJ set a price stability target \nof  2%  (year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the  consumer  price  index).  On  4  April  2013,  the  BOJ \nannounced  that,  based  on  a  decision  by  its  Monetary  Policy  Meeting,  it  would  purchase \nJapanese  government  bonds,  effective  5  April  2013.  This  decision  was  taken  at  the  first \nMonetary Policy  Meeting after Haruhiko Kuroda had taken up his post as the new governor of \nthe  BOJ.  Approximately \u00a57.5 trillion  per month  of  Japanese government bonds (2-year  bonds, \n5-year  bonds,  10-year  bonds,  20-year  bonds,  30-year  bonds,  40-year  bonds,  floating-rate \nbonds, and inflation-indexed bonds) would be purchased, thus increasing the monetary base, in \ncontrast  to  previous  attempts  at  an  expansionary  monetary  policy  which  mainly  focused  on \nbuying short-term government bonds (Yoshino and Taghizadeh 2014a). Although prices started \nto rise after the BOJ implemented monetary easing, it was unable to raise levels of investment \nand aggregate demand.2 Japan\u2019s recent inflation has mainly stemmed from other sources such \nas higher energy prices as a result of the depreciation of the Japanese yen after the easing of \nmonetary policy.3 \n\n1.3  How Higher Energy Prices Can Create Inflation \n\nA  simple  aggregate  supply  and  demand  model  will  demonstrate  how  higher  energy  prices \nresulting from the depreciation of the yen can create inflation in Japan.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n2 For more information on the impact of monetary policy on global oil prices see, inter alia, Taghizadeh and Yoshino \n\n(2013a; 2014); Yoshino and Taghizadeh (forthcoming). \n\n3 In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a large tsunami. The \ndamage  to Japan  resulted  in an  immediate shutdown  of  about  10  gigawatts  (GW)  of  nuclear  electric  generating \ncapacity. Between the 2011 Fukushima disaster and May 2012, Japan lost all of its nuclear capacity as a result of \nscheduled  maintenance and  lack  of  government  approvals to  return to operation. Japan replaced  this significant \nloss  of  nuclear  power  with  generation  from  imported  natural  gas,  low-sulfur  crude  oil,  fuel  oil,  and  coal.  This \ncaused the price of electricity to rise for the government, utilities, and consumers, and led to inflation. Increases to \nthe cost of fuel imports have resulted in Japan\u2019s top 10 utilities losing over $30 billion in the past 2 years. Japan \nspent $250 billion on total fuel imports in 2012, a third of the country\u2019s total import value. Japan consumed over 4.7 \nmillion  barrels  per  day  (bbl/d)  of  oil  in  2012.  The  increased  cost  of  imported  energy  had  a  significant  negative \nimpact  on  the  Japanese  economy.  For  more  information  on  the  impact  of  higher  energy  prices  on  the  economy \nsee, inter alia, Taghizadeh and Yoshino (2013b); Taghizadeh et al. (2013). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nFigure 2:  How Higher Energy Prices Can Create Inflation \n\nNote: We assume that there is technological progress, which is why the output level in full employment also increases. \n\n \n\nSource: Yoshino and Taghizadeh (2014b). \n\nIn Figure 2, the economy is initially in equilibrium with a price level PQ0 and a real output level \nQ0 at point A. AD is the aggregate demand curve and AS is the aggregate supply curve. The \naggregate  supply  curve  has  an  increasing  slope  to  show  that,  at  some  real  output  level,  it \nbecomes difficult to increase real output despite increases in the general level of prices. At this \noutput level, the economy achieves full employment. Let us suppose that the initial equilibrium, \npoint A, is below the full employment level.  \n\nWhen  the  relative  price  of  energy  resources  (e.g.,  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  coal)  increases,  the \naggregate supply curve shifts to AS\u2019. The employment of existing labor and capital with a given \nnominal wage rate requires a higher general price for output, if sufficient amounts of the higher-\ncost energy resources are to be used.  \n\nThe productivity of existing capital and labor resources is reduced so that potential real output \ndeclines to Q1. In addition, the same rate of labor employment occurs only if real wages decline \nsufficiently to match the decline in productivity. This, in turn, happens only if the general level of \nprices  rises  sufficiently  (PQ1),  given  the  nominal  wage  rate.  This  moves  the  economy  to  the \nlevel of output (Q1) and price level (PQ1). This point is indicated in Figure 2 at point B, which is \na  disequilibrium  point.  Given  the  same  supply  of  labor  services  and  existing  plant  and \nequipment, the output associated with full employment declines as producers reduce their use \nof  more  expensive  energy  resources  and  as  plant  and  equipment  become  economically \nobsolete. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  on  the  demand  side  of  the  economy,  when  the  price  of  energy  resources \nrises,  consumption  of  them  declines.  Because  of  this  drop  in  consumption,  the  aggregate \ndemand  curve  shifts  to  AD\u2019,  which  in  turn  reduces  the  prices  from  the  previous  disequilibrium \nlevel  at  PQ1  and  sets  them  to  PQ2  as  the  final  equilibrium  price.  This  lowers  output  levels \nbecause of the reduction in consumption in the economy, from the previous point of Q1 to Q2. \nThis point is indicated in Figure 2 at point C, which is the final equilibrium point.   \n\nThe economy may not adjust instantaneously to point C, even if this is the new equilibrium. For \nexample,  price  rigidities  due  to  slow-moving  information  or  other  transaction  costs  can  keep \nnominal  prices  from  adjusting  quickly.  Consequently,  output  and  prices  move  along  an \nadjustment path such as that indicated by the arrow in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows how this has \nplayed out in the Japanese economy. \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nFigure 3:  Oil Price and Inflation Rate in Japan \n\nInflation rate \n\n/\n\n \n)\nL\nK\nY\nP\nJ\n(\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \nl\ni\n\nO\n\n100000\n\n90000\n\n80000\n\n70000\n\n60000\n\n50000\n\n40000\n\n30000\n\n20000\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n10.00%\n\n8.00%\n\n6.00%\n\n4.00%\n\n2.00%\n\n0.00%\n\n-2.00%\n\n-4.00%\n\n-6.00%\n\n-8.00%\n\n-10.00%\n\n \n\ne\n\nt\n\na\nr\n \nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\n\nl\nf\n\nn\n\ni\n \nI\n\nP\nP\n\n \n\nOil price \n\n1\nQ\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\nQ\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\nQ\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\nKL = kiloliter. \n\nNote:  The  inflation  rate  is  the  producer  price  index  (PPI)  growth  rate  for  all  commodities  based  on  the  year-on-year \nchange. The oil price is the average cost, insurance and freight (CIF) imported crude oil price in Japan, in Japanese yen \nper kiloliter.  \n\nSource: Bank of Japan database and the Energy Data and Modelling Center (EDMC) database of the Institute of Energy \nEconomics, Japan (IEEJ). \n\nFigure 3 shows the movements of the inflation rate in Japan and the import price of crude oil in \nyen.  It  is  clear  that  in  most  cases  they  followed  same  path  and  Figure  3  clearly  shows  the \nsignificant  association  between  these  two  variables.  Rising  oil  prices  during  Q1  1994  to  Q1 \n2014 had various causes. In the first part of the period it resulted from higher crude oil demand, \nespecially from emerging economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Brazil, and \nthe Middle East, which steadily led to higher global oil prices. More recently, especially since the \nBOJ implemented an easing of monetary policy, import prices have risen in yen terms because \nof the depreciation of the currency, leading to inflation. \n\n2.  MODEL \n\nThe New Keynesian approach to monetary policy analysis has emerged in recent years as one \nof the most influential and prolific areas of research in macroeconomics.4 It has provided us with \na  framework  that  combines  the  theoretical  rigor  of  real  business  cycle  theory  with  Keynesian \ningredients  such  as  monopolistic  competition  and  nominal  rigidities.  The  framework  has  also \nbecome  the  basis  for  the  new  generation  of  models  being  developed  at  central  banks,  and \nincreasingly  used  for  simulation  and  forecasting  purposes  (see  Gali,  Smets,  and  Wouters \n[2012]). \n\nIn  this  section,  we  will  try  to  develop  a  model  with  a  New  Keynesian  approach  that  includes \naggregate supply (Phillips Curve), aggregate demand side, and monetary policy blocks, in order \nto  capture  the  impact  of  monetary  policy  and  oil  price  shocks  on  the  economy.  We  aim  to \nanswer  these  questions  (i)  can  monetary  easing  stimulate  GDP  in  Japan,  and  (ii)  has  the \naggressive  monetary  policy  of the  BOJ  raised  aggregate  demand  and  caused  inflation,  or  has \n\n                                                \n4 See Gali and Gertler (2007) for a quick introduction to the New Keynesian framework. The textbooks by Woodford \n\n(2003) and Gali (2008) provide a more comprehensive treatment and analysis of the New Keynesian model. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\ninflation in Japan stemmed from other sources, such as higher oil prices, which have shifted the \naggregate supply to the left leading to inflation? \n\nBelow  are  three  equations  that  constitute  the  simplest  possible  version  of  our  New  Keynesian \nmodel, and in the subsequent section we use these equations simultaneously in order to run our \nempirical  analysis.  The  first  equation  in  our  simultaneous  equation  model  (SEM),  the  New \nKeynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC), can be derived from aggregating the price-setting decisions \nby firms, combined with an equation describing the relationship between marginal cost and the \nlevel of activity. It takes the form in equation (1).  \n\n{\napap p\nE\n\n}\n\n+\n\n=\n\nt\n\n+\n1\n\nt\n\nt\n\ny\n\n(\n\n \n\n \n\ny\n\nt\n\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nt\n\n)\n\n+\n\na\noil\n\np\n\noil\nt\n\n+\n\na\n\ngas\n\np\n\ngas\nt\n\n+\n\nu\n\nt\n\n                                (1)\n\nwhere \n\ntp  is  the  inflation  rate, \n\n{\n\n}1+t\n\ntE p  is  the  expected  inflation  rate,  (\ntp\n\noil\ntp  and \n\ngas\n\ny \u2212\nt\n\n)t\n\ny\n\n represents \n\n are crude oil and \ndeviations of (log) output from (log) steady state (or trend level), \nnatural gas prices respectively, which are two main energy carriers and two production inputs, \ntu is a cost-push shock. \n\nand changes in their prices could affect the general level of prices, and \n\nThe second key block of the model relates the output gap positively to its expected one-period-\nahead value, negatively to the real interest rate, and positively to the exchange rate ( te ). When \nthe  domestic  currency  depreciates,  this  will  tend  to  increase  exports  and  decrease  imports, \nwhich will allow output to increase, which can be seen in the left-hand side of equation (2). The \n\nreal interest rate is defined as the difference between the long-term nominal interest rate (\nand the expected inflation rate (\n\ntE p ).

The  simplest \npossible  such  description  is  given  by  a  version  of  the  so-called  \u201cTaylor  rule,\u201d  which  takes  the \nform: \n\n \n\n   \n\ni\n\nSN\nt\n\n=\n\n\u03b3p\u03b3\u03b3\np\ny\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0\n\nt\n\n(\n\ny\n\nt\n\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nt\n\n)\n\n+\n\nv\n\nt\n\n                                             (3) \n\nwhere \n\nSN\n\nti\n\n is the short-term nominal interest rate and \n\ntv  is the monetary shock. \n\nSince  the  interest  rate  in  equation  2  is  the  long-term  interest  rate  and  the  interest  rate  in \nequation  3  is  the  short-term  interest  rate,  in  order to  be  able to run the SEM,  we  need  to  add \none more block, which is called a \u201cbridge equation\u201d.

Moreover at the same time it allows us to see the impact of monetary \npolicy on the output gap. This means that by carrying out the empirical analysis in Section 3 of \nthis paper using the model, we should be able to answer to the two questions posed above:  (i) \ncan monetary easing stimulate GDP in Japan, and (ii) has the aggressive monetary policy of the \nBOJ  raised  aggregate  demand  and  caused  inflation,  or  has  inflation  in  Japan  stemmed  from \nother sources, such as higher oil prices, which shift the aggregate supply to the left leading to \ninflation? \n\n3.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS5 \n\n3.1  Data Analysis \n\nWe used quarterly data from Q2 1994 to Q2 2014, a period that includes the era during which \nthe  BOJ  adopted  a  zero  interest  rate  policy.  In  Q1  2002  the  short-term  interest  rate  (the \nmonetary policy interest rate of the BOJ) was almost zero. This forced us to separate the period \nof our analysis into two subperiods. The first, from Q2 1994 to Q4 2001, showed that the value \nof  the  short-term  interest  rate  was  significant  and  more  than  zero,  and  the  second,  from  Q1 \n2002 to Q2 2014, showed that the BOJ had adopted a zero interest rate monetary policy. For \nmost of this subperiod the short-term interest rate was almost zero. \n\nThe inflation rate that we used in our survey was the growth rate of the producer price index of \nJapan for all commodities based on year-on-year change. The output gap was the variation in \nthe  real GDP  of  Japan from GDP  in  a  situation of full  employment for the  country. In  order  to \nestimate the GDP in a situation of full employment, we carried out the Hodrick Prescott filter on \nthe real GDP. The price of oil is the average CIF imported crude oil price in Japan, in Japanese \nyen per kilo liter. The price of gas is the average CIF imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) price \nin  Japan  in  yen  per  ton.  As  for  the  short-term  interest  rate,  call  rates  (the  average  of  the \nuncollateralized overnight rate) in Japan were used. For the long-term interest rate we used the \nJapanese  government  bond  interest  rate.  And  finally  for  the  exchange  rate  we  used  the  US \ndollar\u2013Japanese  yen  spot  rate  average  for  the  quarter,  in  the  Tokyo  market.  The  sources  of \ndata were the Trade Statistics of Japan, the Bank of Japan database, and the Energy Data and \nModelling Center database of the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). \n\nTo evaluate the stationarity of the series, we used an augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test. The results \nsuggest that, with the exception of the short-term interest rate, the inflation rate, and the GDP \ngap,  which  were  all  stationary,  all  other  variables  are  non-stationary.  These  variables  include \ncrude  oil  price,  gas  price,  long-term  interest  rate,  and  the  exchange  rate.  However,  when  we \napplied  the  unit  root  test  to the first  difference  of  the  variables,  we  were able  to reject  the  null \n\n                                                \n5 Identification of SEM: One significant issue in simultaneous equations is identification, meaning that we must first \ndetermine whether the equation is identified or not.  If the equation is not identified, then estimating its parameters \nis meaningless. This is because the estimates obtained cannot be interpreted, and therefore will not provide any \nuseful information. Two popular ways for checking whether equations are identified or not are (i) the rank condition \nand  (ii)  the  order  condition.  The  order  condition  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  for  identification.  The \nrank condition is both a necessary and sufficient condition for identification. The results of the order condition show \nthat simultaneous equations are identified. However, as mentioned earlier, the order condition is a necessary but \nnot  sufficient  condition  for  identification  and  there  is  one  more  step  to  go,  which  is  the  rank  condition.  The  rank \ncondition tells  us  whether  the  structural  equations  we  are checking  for identification  can be  distinguished  from  a \nlinear  combination  of  all  structural  equations  in  the  simultaneous  equation  system.  Results  of  the  rank  condition \nshow that our simultaneous equations are identified, hence we can start the empirical analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nhypothesis of unit roots for each of the variables. These results suggest that the crude oil price, \ngas  price,  long-term  interest rate,  and  exchange  rate  variables  each  contain  a  unit root. Once \nthe unit root test was performed and it was discovered that the variables are non-stationary in \nlevel  and  stationary  in  the  first  differences  level,  they  were  integrated  of  order  1.  Hence, \nvariables will appear in our SEM in first differences form.  \n\nIn the next step, in order to identify the cointegrating vectors among the variables, we conduct a \ncointegration analysis using Johansen\u2019s technique by assuming a linear deterministic trend for \ntwo cases, with intercept and with intercept and trend. The results suggested we should accept \nthe  null  hypothesis  of  non-cointegrating  variables,  which  means  there  are  no  cointegrating \nvectors among the variables. \n\n3.2  Empirical Results \n\nA  regression  would  need  to  be  run  in  order to  assess the  impact  of the BOJ\u2019s  easy  monetary \npolicy and higher energy prices on the Japanese economy. We ran the regression for our SEM \nusing  the  weighted  two-stage  least  squares  (W2SLS)  method.  The  results  are  summarized  in \nTable  1.  W2SLS  is  an  instrumental-variable  estimation  methodology,  for  instruments  we  used \nlagged  values  of  the  two  exogenous  variables  we  have  in  this  survey:  oil  price  and  gas  price. \nWe used the Akaike Information Criterion to select the lag orders in which the maximum lag is \nset to three lags of each variable. \n\nTable 1: Empirical Results   \n\nQ2 1994\u2013Q4 2001 \n \n\nQ1 2002\u2013Q2 2014 \n \n\n0.89 (4.08)** \n\n0.69 (2.18)* \n\n0.06 (3.27)** \n\n0.03 (0.45) \n\n-0.36 (-1.12) \n\n-0.24 (-0.45) \n\n0.07 (2.59)** \n\n0.05 (1.17) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-0.02 (-4.71)** \n\n-0.02 (-1.09) \n\n-0.33 (-1.66) \n\n0.09 (2.18)* \n\n0.42 (1.52) \n\n0.07 (1.17) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNotation \n \n\n)y\n\n \n\n)1(\u2212p  \n(\ny \u2212\noilp  \ngasp\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(\n)p\u2212LNi\n))1(\n(\n\u2212 \u2212 y\ny\ne  \n \n\n)1(\n\n\u2212\n\n \n\n(\n\ny \u2212\n\n)y\n\n \n\np  \n\n \n\nSNi\n\n \n\n \nPhillips curve \nInflation ratep  \n     Lagged inflation rate \n\n  \n\n     GDP gap \n\n     Crude oil price \n\n     Gas price \n\n \nAggregate Demand \n)y\nGDP gap (\n     Long-term real interest rate \n\ny \u2212\n\n \n\n \n\n     Lagged GDP gap \n\n     Exchange rate \n\n \nTaylor Rule \nShort-term interest rate  SNi\n     Inflation rate \n\n  \n\nBridge equation \nLong-term real interest rate  LNi\n     Short-term interest rate \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n     GDP gap \n\n4.76 (2.72)**  \n\n3.89 (3.01)** \n\n1.21 (0.67) \n\n1.94 (2.16)* \n\nNote: T-statistics are in parentheses; * indicates significance at 5%; ** indicates significance at 1%. \n\n3.50 (3.16)** \n \n\n4.44 (2.67)* \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\n)y\n\ny \u2212\n\nThe  first  part  of  the  empirical  results  is  for  the  Phillips  curve,  which  is  the  aggregate  supply \nfunction. The y-axis of the Phillips curve is the inflation rate and the x-axis is  (\n, which is the \nGDP gap. Usually the aggregate supply curve is upward slopping, which means the GDP gap \nand  the  rate  of  inflation  should  be  positively  related.  Our  results  for  Q2  1994\u2013Q4  2001  are  in \naccordance with an upward sloping aggregate supply, which means a larger GDP gap tended to \nlead  to  a  higher  inflation  rate  in  the  first  period.  When  the  economy  is  in  an  inflationary \nenvironment, that will accelerate current inflation even more, so in this situation lagged inflation \nshould have a positive impact on the current inflation rate, which is what happened in the first \nperiod  of  our  analysis.  However  after  2002,  Japan  was  faced  with  deflation  and  a  decreasing \nGDP  gap,  so  the  results  show  that  the  lagged  inflation  rate  and  the  GDP  gap  in  the  Phillips \ncurve are not significant in the second period of our analysis, which is valid. This means (i) the \ncurrent year\u2019s inflation was not affected by lagged inflation rates, and (ii) because the economy \nwas in recession, the GDP gap was negative and had no impact on the inflation rate. However, \nthe  increasing  crude  oil  price  shifted  up  the  aggregate  supply  curve  because  imports  of  oil \ncreated inflationary pressure. Therefore the positive sign of the crude oil price in both periods is \ncorrect. This finding is in accordance with what is happening now in the Japanese economy. As \nmentioned earlier, the second arrow of Abenomics is an aggressive easing of monetary policy. \nAlthough  inflation  was  created  after  the  launch  of  this  policy,  we  believe  this  stemmed  mainly \nfrom other sources, especially from higher oil prices. Following the easy monetary policy of the \nBOJ,  the  yen  started  to  depreciate  heavily,  which  raised  prices  of  crude  oil  and  other  energy \nimports, pushing up production costs, and creating inflation. Our empirical analysis supports this \nassertion. In the second period, the sign of the output gap in the Phillips curve equation was not \nsignificant,  which  means  that  the  economy  was  in  recession  and  aggregate  demand  did  not \nraise  enough  to  have  an  impact  on  price  levels.  However,  the  higher  oil  prices  in  yen,  which \nwere mainly a result of easy monetary policy, had significant impact on the general price levels \nand have been a negative development for Japanese manufacturers.   \n\nFigure 4: Crude Oil Import Price of Japan  \n\n \nn\ne\ny\n \ne\ns\ne\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\n13000\n\n12000\n\n11000\n\n10000\n\n9000\n\n8000\n\n7000\n\n6000\n\nImported crude \n oil price in US dollars \n \n\nImported crude \noil price in yen \n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n \nr\na\n\nl\nl\n\no\nd\n \nS\nU\n\n \n\n1\n0\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n.\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n.\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n.\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n.\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n.\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n.\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\nNote:  Import  prices  are  the  CIF  prices  in  Japan.

Oil is imported crude oil + imported petroleum \nproducts. Gas is imported LNG. Other energy sources include coal, nuclear power, hydropower, and new energy.  \n\nSource: General Energy Statistics, Agency of Resources and Energy, Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry of Japan, \nMETI. \n\nIt is clear the main energy source for Japan is oil and petroleum products. In the first period of \nour analysis (Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001) the average share of oil and petroleum products in the primary \nenergy demand of Japan was almost 54%, although in the second period (Q1 2002\u2013Q2 2014) \nthis  share  diminished  to  about  48%.  That  is  why  oil  price  fluctuations  had  such  an  impact  on \nJapan\u2019s macroeconomic variables, including the inflation rate in both periods. Gas represents a \nmuch  smaller  share of  Japan\u2019s  energy  supply,  11%  in  the first  period  and  17%  in  the  second. \nFollowing  the  March  2011  earthquake  and  catastrophic  tsunami  in  Japan  that  shut  down  all \nnuclear  power  plants  in  the  country,  LNG  imports  increased  dramatically  and  they  are  still \ngrowing.  In  future,  if  Japan  continues  to  keep  its  nuclear  power  plants  closed,  we  can  expect \nLNG prices to exert a significant influence on the macroeconomic variables of the country.  \n\nThe  next  part  of  Table  1  shows  the  results  for  the  aggregate  demand.  When  the  real  interest \nrate  goes  down,  investment  should  go  up,  so  the  sign  of  the  interest  rate  in  the  empirical \nfindings should be negative. In both periods it is negative, although after 2002, because of the \nlong-term  recession,  even  when  the  interest  rate  was  lower,  investment  did  not  accelerate, \nwhich is evidence for the vertical IS curve that can be seen in Figure 1. The lagged GDP gap in \nboth  periods  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  current  value  of  GDP.  Exchange  rates \naffect  both  exports  and  imports.  If the  value  of  the  domestic  currency  appreciates,  this should \nreduce exports and raise imports, meaning aggregate demand should go down. So the sign of \nthe  exchange  rate  in  this  equation  should  be  positive.  In  this  example  both  periods  show \npositive signs for the exchange rate, although only in the first period it has a significant value. \n\nThe third part of the empirical results is the Taylor rule, which depends on inflation and the GDP \ngap. If the inflation rate keeps on going up, the central bank will tighten monetary policy, so the \ninflation rate should have a positive sign (Yoshino et al. 2014). In both periods it is positive, but \nonly in the second period is it significant. With regard to the GDP gap, from Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001 \nthis  gap  was  widening.  When  the  current  GDP  is  higher  than  the  full  employment  GDP,  this \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nmeans  the  economy  is  accelerating.  At  this  point,  the  central  bank  usually  tries  to  tighten  the \nmoney market, so the GDP gap in the Taylor rule should have a positive sign. After 2002, Japan \ny \u2212 became negative. The central bank then lowered the short-\nwas faced with recession, so \nterm interest rate, and again the GDP gap in Taylor rule should have a positive sign. \n\ny\n\nThe  last  part  of  Table  1  is  for  the  bridge  equation,  which  shows  positive  and  significant \nassociation between the short-term and the long-term nominal interest rates. \n\n4.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nCurrently the Bank of Japan is trying to achieve an inflation target of 2% by quantitative easing \nin order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. However, the present \ninflation rate may be the result of several factors, in particular the increase in the price of oil in \nyen terms. Based on our empirical results, after Q1 2002, the inflation rate was not affected by \nthe  GDP  gap  but  by  the  higher  oil  prices  as  a  result  of  the  depreciated  Japanese  yen.  This \nmeans that inflation in Japan may be caused less by a recovery in the Japanese economy than \nby an increase in the oil price, which implies Japan is experiencing stagflation.6 In order to avoid \nthis, Japan  needs  growth  strategies  and  changes  for  the  economy,  which  is  dominated  by  an \naging population. Monetary policy has not had a strong impact on this movement because from \nQ1  2002\u2013Q2  2014,  the  long-term  real  interest  rate  has  not  had  a  significant  impact  on \naggregate demand. The Government of Japan needs to focus on structural change and growth \nstrategy rather than on monetary policy. \n\n \n\n                                                \n6 This finding is in accordance with that of Taghizadeh and Yoshino (2014b). They found that higher oil prices create \nmore  inflation  in  advanced  economies  (US  and  Japan  in  their  survey)  than  in  emerging  economies  (the  PRC  in \ntheir survey). The reason is that in emerging economies aggregate supply is shifting to forward because of higher \ngrowth in outputs, so they can avoid high inflation during oil shocks. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f ADBI Working Paper 503 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n          \n\n \n\n              Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n\nGal\u00ed, J. 2008.

In  order  to  overcome \ndeflation and achieve sustainable economic growth, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently set an \ninflation target of 2% and implemented an aggressive monetary policy so this target could be \nachieved  as  soon  as  possible.  Although  prices  started  to  rise  after  the  BOJ  implemented \nmonetary  easing,  this  may  have  been  for  other  reasons,  such  as  higher  oil  prices.  Oil \nbecame expensive as a result of the depreciated Japanese yen and this was one of the main \ncauses  of  the  rise  in  inflation.  This  paper  shows  that  quantitative  easing  may  not  have \nstimulated  the  Japanese  economy  either.  Aggregate  demand,  which  includes  private \ninvestment,  did  not  increase  significantly  in  Japan  with  lower  interest  rates.  Private \ninvestment  displays  this  unconventional  behavior  because  of  uncertainty  about  the  future \nand because Japan\u2019s population is aging. We believe that the remedy for Japan\u2019s economic \npolicy  is  not  to  be  found  in  monetary  policy.  The  government  needs  to  implement  serious \nstructural changes and growth strategies. \n", " \nJEL Classification: E47, E52, Q41, Q43 \n", " \n"]}
