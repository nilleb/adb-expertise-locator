INTRODUCTION \nIn the early 1990s, Japan\u2019s real estate and stock market bubble burst and the economy went \ninto  a  tailspin.  Since  then,  Japan  has  suffered  from  sluggish  economic  growth.  Almost  2 \ndecades later, the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sparked a global financial \ncrisis that threatened the entire world economy. This was followed by a catastrophic earthquake \nand tsunami that struck northeastern Japan in March 2011. Japan\u2019s government budget deficit-\nto-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio breached 200% in 2010, mainly because of the high \nshare of pension fund payments in government spending, and the efficiency and effectiveness \nof public investment was called into question. The Japanese economy required a stimulus to \nescape  from  this  pattern  of  long-term  sluggish  growth.  In  December  2012,  the  Liberal \nDemocratic Party won a general election, making Shinzo Abe the prime minister of Japan, a \npost that he had previously held in 2007. \u201cAbenomics\u201d refers to the economic policies advocated \nby the prime minister after the election, which were designed to revive the sluggish economy \nwith \u201cthree arrows\u201d: (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) more aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of \nJapan,  and  (iii)  structural  reforms  to  boost  Japan\u2019s  competitiveness  and  economic  growth \n(Yoshino and Taghizadeh 2014a). The Bank of Japan settled on an inflation target of 2% and \nimplemented a monetary easing policy.  \nIn this paper we focus on the government\u2019s aggressive policy of monetary easing and pose two \nquestions.  First,  does  Japanese  aggregate  demand,  which  includes  private  investment, \nincrease significantly when the interest rate drops following an easing of monetary policy? \nSecond, has the inflation rate in Japan been affected by the aggressive monetary easing policy \npursued by the Bank of Japan, or are there other reasons for the increase in the inflation rate, \nsuch as higher oil prices? In order to answer these questions, in the first section of the paper we \nexplain the reasons for Japan\u2019s stagnant economy. We then attempt to shed some light on the \nBOJ\u2019s recent monetary policy and to explain how higher energy prices increased inflation in \nJapan. In the second section, we develop our model. In the third section we conduct the \nempirical analysis and in the fourth we present the paper\u2019s concluding remarks. \n1.1  Japan\u2019s Stagnant Economy after the Bubble Bursts \nThe sudden imposition of tight monetary policy in 1990 pushed land and stock prices down \nabout one-third from their peak level. The annual real growth rate of the economy was below \n2% for most of the 1990s and the unemployment rate rose to almost 5% in 2002 and 2003. Paul \n1\nKrugman has argued that Japan is currently in a liquidity trap;  a situation in which monetary \npolicy is ineffective in lowering interest rates. However, our empirical analysis indicates that the \nproblems of the Japanese economy stem from other sources.  \nAggregate demand, which includes private investment, has not increased significantly in Japan \nwith lower interest rates. Private investment displays this unconventional behavior because of \nuncertainty about the future and because Japan\u2019s population is aging. In other words, the \ncurrent monetary policy has not been effective. \nThe large foreign direct investment (FDI) of Japan to other Asian countries has shifted the \ninvestment\u2013saving (IS) curve to the left, as shown in Figure 1. In such circumstances, because \nmonetary policy is ineffective, fiscal policy needs to be used to shift the IS curve back to the \nright so that the economy can recover. However, the dilemma in Japan is that, despite the huge \nincrease in government investment, the IS curve has not shifted enough to the right. This is \n                                                \n1 http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/projects/bpea/1998%202/1998b_bpea_krugman_dominquez_rogoff.pdf \n3 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nbecause  the  effectiveness  of  public  works  has  drastically  diminished,  compared  with  that \nundertaken during the period of high growth (Yoshino and Nakahigashi 2000). \nFigure 1: The Ineffectiveness of Monetary Policy in Japan \n \n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Yoshino and Sakakibara (2002). \nPublic investment has not had a sufficient impact on Japan\u2019s gross national product (GNP) \nbecause it has been distributed ineffectively. The bulk of the increase in public investment has \nbeen concentrated in the countryside, where it has had a much smaller impact than it would \nhave had in urban areas. Public investment in the agricultural sector has also been much less \neffective than in the industrial and service sectors. The result of this increasing rural and \nagricultural bias in the allocation of public investment is that the multiplier of public investment \nhas declined sharply (Yoshino, Kaji, and Kameda 1998). This means that public investment has \nonly increased budget deficits; it has been unable to bring about the recovery of the Japanese \neconomy. \nSeveral other factors have contributed to the stagnant economy in the last 2 decades: \n(i)  The bursting of the bubble was followed by a credit crunch because banks \nwere less willing to make investment loans. Falling land prices made them \nreluctant to make loans because of the anticipated fall in the value of collateral. \nPrudential  measures  introduced  in  1998,  as  well  as  higher  capital \nrequirements, forced banks to reduce the number of loans they made by even \nfurther.  The  growing  proportion  of  nonperforming  loans  in  the  banks\u2019  loan \nportfolios meant that they reduced their lending in order to build up their loss \nprovisions. The failures of several large financial institutions also reduced the \navailability of loans. \n(ii)  Capital flows became more sensitive to interest rates. Lower interest rates in \nJapan encouraged an outflow of investment to the United States (US) and \nother countries (Yoshino and Sakakibara 2002). \n(iii)  The level of consumption has decreased. The fall in the propensity to consume \nhas  been  mainly  a  result  of  workers\u2019  concerns  about  possible  layoffs.  In \naddition, the fall in asset prices has lowered consumption, including that of the \n4 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \ncorporate sector, because Japanese companies and individuals are no longer \nas wealthy as they  were.  Another reason for the decrease in the level of \nconsumption is the demographic change. Japan\u2019s biggest problem is its aging \npopulation. The number of elderly and retired people is rising while the younger \ngeneration is shrinking, and usually elderly people consume less than younger \ngenerations. \n1.2  Recent Monetary Policy of the Bank of Japan  \nThe Government of Japan and the BOJ delivered a joint statement on overcoming deflation and \nachieving sustainable economic growth on 22 January 2013. The BOJ set a price stability target \nof 2% (year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index). On 4 April 2013, the BOJ \nannounced  that,  based  on  a  decision  by  its  Monetary  Policy  Meeting,  it  would  purchase \nJapanese  government  bonds,  effective  5  April  2013.  This  decision  was  taken  at  the  first \nMonetary Policy Meeting after Haruhiko Kuroda had taken up his post as the new governor of \nthe BOJ. Approximately \u00a57.5 trillion per month of Japanese government bonds (2-year bonds, \n5-year  bonds,  10-year  bonds,  20-year  bonds,  30-year  bonds,  40-year  bonds,  floating-rate \nbonds, and inflation-indexed bonds) would be purchased, thus increasing the monetary base, in \ncontrast to previous attempts at an expansionary monetary policy which mainly focused on \nbuying short-term government bonds (Yoshino and Taghizadeh 2014a). Although prices started \nto rise after the BOJ implemented monetary easing, it was unable to raise levels of investment \n2\nand aggregate demand.  Japan\u2019s recent inflation has mainly stemmed from other sources such \nas higher energy prices as a result of the depreciation of the Japanese yen after the easing of \n3\nmonetary policy.  \n1.3  How Higher Energy Prices Can Create Inflation \nA simple aggregate supply and demand model will demonstrate how higher energy prices \nresulting from the depreciation of the yen can create inflation in Japan.  \n   \n                                                \n2 For more information on the impact of monetary policy on global oil prices see, inter alia, Taghizadeh and Yoshino \n(2013a; 2014); Yoshino and Taghizadeh (forthcoming). \n3 In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a large tsunami. The \ndamage to Japan resulted in an immediate shutdown of about 10 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear electric generating \ncapacity. Between the 2011 Fukushima disaster and May 2012, Japan lost all of its nuclear capacity as a result of \nscheduled maintenance and lack of government approvals to return to operation. Japan replaced this significant \nloss of nuclear power with generation from imported natural gas, low-sulfur crude oil, fuel oil, and coal. This \ncaused the price of electricity to rise for the government, utilities, and consumers, and led to inflation. Increases to \nthe cost of fuel imports have resulted in Japan\u2019s top 10 utilities losing over $30 billion in the past 2 years. Japan \nspent $250 billion on total fuel imports in 2012, a third of the country\u2019s total import value. Japan consumed over 4.7 \nmillion barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil in 2012. The increased cost of imported energy had a significant negative \nimpact on the Japanese economy. For more information on the impact of higher energy prices on the economy \nsee, inter alia, Taghizadeh and Yoshino (2013b); Taghizadeh et al. (2013). \n5 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nFigure 2:  How Higher Energy Prices Can Create Inflation \n \nNote: We assume that there is technological progress, which is why the output level in full employment also increases. \nSource: Yoshino and Taghizadeh (2014b). \nIn Figure 2, the economy is initially in equilibrium with a price level PQ0 and a real output level \nQ0 at point A. AD is the aggregate demand curve and AS is the aggregate supply curve. The \naggregate supply curve has an increasing slope to show that, at some real output level, it \nbecomes difficult to increase real output despite increases in the general level of prices. At this \noutput level, the economy achieves full employment. Let us suppose that the initial equilibrium, \npoint A, is below the full employment level.  \nWhen the relative price of energy resources (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, coal) increases, the \naggregate supply curve shifts to AS\u2019. The employment of existing labor and capital with a given \nnominal wage rate requires a higher general price for output, if sufficient amounts of the higher-\ncost energy resources are to be used.  \nThe productivity of existing capital and labor resources is reduced so that potential real output \ndeclines to Q1. In addition, the same rate of labor employment occurs only if real wages decline \nsufficiently to match the decline in productivity. This, in turn, happens only if the general level of \nprices rises sufficiently (PQ1), given the nominal wage rate. This moves the economy to the \nlevel of output (Q1) and price level (PQ1). This point is indicated in Figure 2 at point B, which is \na  disequilibrium  point.  Given  the  same  supply  of  labor  services  and  existing  plant  and \nequipment, the output associated with full employment declines as producers reduce their use \nof  more  expensive  energy  resources  and  as  plant  and  equipment  become  economically \nobsolete. \nOn the other hand, on the demand side of the economy, when the price of energy resources \nrises,  consumption  of  them  declines.  Because  of this  drop  in  consumption, the  aggregate \ndemand curve shifts to AD\u2019, which in turn reduces the prices from the previous disequilibrium \nlevel at PQ1 and sets them to PQ2 as the final equilibrium price. This lowers output levels \nbecause of the reduction in consumption in the economy, from the previous point of Q1 to Q2. \nThis point is indicated in Figure 2 at point C, which is the final equilibrium point.   \nThe economy may not adjust instantaneously to point C, even if this is the new equilibrium. For \nexample, price rigidities due to slow-moving information or other transaction costs can keep \nnominal  prices  from  adjusting  quickly.  Consequently,  output  and  prices  move  along  an \nadjustment path such as that indicated by the arrow in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows how this has \nplayed out in the Japanese economy. \n \n6 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nFigure 3:  Oil Price and Inflation Rate in Japan \n100000 10.00%\n90000 8.00%\n80000 6.00%\nPY/KL)  6700000000 Inflation rate  24..0000%% n rate \nJ o\ne ( 50000 0.00% ati\nOil pric 3400000000 --42..0000%% PPI infl\n20000 -6.00%\n10000 -8.00%\nOil price \n0 -10.00%\n111111111111111111111\nQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ\n456789012345678901234\n999999000000000011111\n999999000000000000000\n111111222222222222222\n \nKL = kiloliter. \nNote: The inflation rate is the producer price index (PPI) growth rate for all commodities based on the year-on-year \nchange.

It is clear that in most cases they followed same path and Figure 3 clearly shows the \nsignificant association between these two variables. Rising oil prices during Q1 1994 to Q1 \n2014 had various causes. In the first part of the period it resulted from higher crude oil demand, \nespecially from emerging economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Brazil, and \nthe Middle East, which steadily led to higher global oil prices. More recently, especially since the \nBOJ implemented an easing of monetary policy, import prices have risen in yen terms because \nof the depreciation of the currency, leading to inflation. \n2.  MODEL \nThe New Keynesian approach to monetary policy analysis has emerged in recent years as one \n4\nof the most influential and prolific areas of research in macroeconomics.  It has provided us with \na framework that combines the theoretical rigor of real business cycle theory with Keynesian \ningredients such as monopolistic competition and nominal rigidities. The framework has also \nbecome the basis for the new generation of models being developed at central banks, and \nincreasingly  used  for  simulation  and  forecasting  purposes  (see  Gali,  Smets,  and  Wouters \n[2012]). \nIn this section, we will try to develop a model with a New Keynesian approach that includes \naggregate supply (Phillips Curve), aggregate demand side, and monetary policy blocks, in order \nto capture the impact of monetary policy and oil price shocks on the economy. We aim to \nanswer these questions (i) can monetary easing stimulate GDP in Japan, and (ii) has the \naggressive monetary policy of the BOJ raised aggregate demand and caused inflation, or has \n                                                \n4 See Gali and Gertler (2007) for a quick introduction to the New Keynesian framework. The textbooks by Woodford \n(2003) and Gali (2008) provide a more comprehensive treatment and analysis of the New Keynesian model. \n7 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \ninflation in Japan stemmed from other sources, such as higher oil prices, which have shifted the \naggregate supply to the left leading to inflation? \nBelow are three equations that constitute the simplest possible version of our New Keynesian \nmodel, and in the subsequent section we use these equations simultaneously in order to run our \nempirical analysis. The first equation in our simultaneous equation model (SEM), the New \nKeynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC), can be derived from aggregating the price-setting decisions \nby firms, combined with an equation describing the relationship between marginal cost and the \nlevel of activity. It takes the form in equation (1).  \n  p =a E {p }+a (y \u2212 y )+a poil +a pgas +u                                 (1)\nt p t t+1 y t t oil t gas t t\nwhere  p  is  the  inflation  rate,  E {p } is  the  expected  inflation  rate,  (y \u2212y )  represents \nt t t+1 t t\ndeviations of (log) output from (log) steady state (or trend level),  poil and  pgas are crude oil and \nt t\nnatural gas prices respectively, which are two main energy carriers and two production inputs, \nand changes in their prices could affect the general level of prices, and u is a cost-push shock. \nt\nThe second key block of the model relates the output gap positively to its expected one-period-\nahead value, negatively to the real interest rate, and positively to the exchange rate (e ). When \nt\nthe domestic currency depreciates, this will tend to increase exports and decrease imports, \nwhich will allow output to increase, which can be seen in the left-hand side of equation (2). The \nreal interest rate is defined as the difference between the long-term nominal interest rate (iLN) \nt\nand the expected inflation rate (E {p }). The resulting equation is given by: \nt t+1\n1\n      (yt \u2212 yt)=\u2212\u03b2 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8ebitLN \u2212Et{pt+1}\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6+\u03b2yEt{(yt+1 \u2212 yt+1)}+\u03b2eet                           (2)\ni\nThe third equation in the model is describing how monetary policy is conducted. The simplest \npossible such description is given by a version of the so-called \u201cTaylor rule,\u201d which takes the \nform: \n    iSN =\u03b3 +\u03b3p +\u03b3 (y \u2212 y )+v                                              (3) \nt 0 p t y t t t\nwhere iSN  is the short-term nominal interest rate and v  is the monetary shock. \nt t\nSince the interest rate in equation 2 is the long-term interest rate and the interest rate in \nequation 3 is the short-term interest rate, in order to be able to run the SEM, we need to add \none more block, which is called a \u201cbridge equation\u201d. This takes the form below: \n     iLN =\u03bb +\u03bbiSN                                                           (4) \nt 0 i t\nConsidering the above, the resulting SEM is given by: \n\uf8ebp =a E {p }+a (y \u2212y )+a poil +a pgas +u \uf8f6\n\uf8ec t p t t+1 y t t oil t gas t t \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n  \uf8ec\uf8ec(yt \u2212yt)=\u2212\u03b2i \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8ebitLN \u2212Et{pt+1}\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6+\u03b2yEt{(yt+1\u2212yt+1)}+\u03b2eet\uf8f7\uf8f7                                (5) \n\uf8eciSN =\u03b3 +\u03b3p +\u03b3 (y \u2212y )+v \uf8f7\n\uf8ec t 0 p t y t t t \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ediLN =\u03bb +\u03bbiSN \uf8f8\nt 0 i t\n8 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nEquation 5 enables us to capture impact of higher energy prices (oil and gas) and the output \ngap on the inflation rates. Moreover at the same time it allows us to see the impact of monetary \npolicy on the output gap. This means that by carrying out the empirical analysis in Section 3 of \nthis paper using the model, we should be able to answer to the two questions posed above:  (i) \ncan monetary easing stimulate GDP in Japan, and (ii) has the aggressive monetary policy of the \nBOJ raised aggregate demand and caused inflation, or has inflation in Japan stemmed from \nother sources, such as higher oil prices, which shift the aggregate supply to the left leading to \ninflation? \n3.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS5 \n3.1  Data Analysis \nWe used quarterly data from Q2 1994 to Q2 2014, a period that includes the era during which \nthe  BOJ  adopted  a  zero  interest rate  policy. In Q1  2002  the  short-term  interest rate (the \nmonetary policy interest rate of the BOJ) was almost zero. This forced us to separate the period \nof our analysis into two subperiods. The first, from Q2 1994 to Q4 2001, showed that the value \nof the short-term interest rate was significant and more than zero, and the second, from Q1 \n2002 to Q2 2014, showed that the BOJ had adopted a zero interest rate monetary policy. For \nmost of this subperiod the short-term interest rate was almost zero. \nThe inflation rate that we used in our survey was the growth rate of the producer price index of \nJapan for all commodities based on year-on-year change. The output gap was the variation in \nthe real GDP of Japan from GDP in a situation of full employment for the country. In order to \nestimate the GDP in a situation of full employment, we carried out the Hodrick Prescott filter on \nthe real GDP. The price of oil is the average CIF imported crude oil price in Japan, in Japanese \nyen per kilo liter. The price of gas is the average CIF imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) price \nin Japan in yen per ton. As for the short-term interest rate, call rates (the average of the \nuncollateralized overnight rate) in Japan were used. For the long-term interest rate we used the \nJapanese government bond interest rate. And finally for the exchange rate we used the US \ndollar\u2013Japanese yen spot rate average for the quarter, in the Tokyo market. The sources of \ndata were the Trade Statistics of Japan, the Bank of Japan database, and the Energy Data and \nModelling Center database of the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). \nTo evaluate the stationarity of the series, we used an augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller test. The results \nsuggest that, with the exception of the short-term interest rate, the inflation rate, and the GDP \ngap, which were all stationary, all other variables are non-stationary. These variables include \ncrude oil price, gas price, long-term interest rate, and the exchange rate. However, when we \napplied the unit root test to the first difference of the variables, we were able to reject the null \n                                                \n5 Identification of SEM: One significant issue in simultaneous equations is identification, meaning that we must first \ndetermine whether the equation is identified or not.  If the equation is not identified, then estimating its parameters \nis meaningless. This is because the estimates obtained cannot be interpreted, and therefore will not provide any \nuseful information. Two popular ways for checking whether equations are identified or not are (i) the rank condition \nand (ii) the order condition. The order condition is a necessary but not sufficient condition for identification. The \nrank condition is both a necessary and sufficient condition for identification. The results of the order condition show \nthat simultaneous equations are identified. However, as mentioned earlier, the order condition is a necessary but \nnot sufficient condition for identification and there is one more step to go, which is the rank condition. The rank \ncondition tells us whether the structural equations we are checking for identification can be distinguished from a \nlinear combination of all structural equations in the simultaneous equation system. Results of the rank condition \nshow that our simultaneous equations are identified, hence we can start the empirical analysis. \n \n9 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nhypothesis of unit roots for each of the variables. These results suggest that the crude oil price, \ngas price, long-term interest rate, and exchange rate variables each contain a unit root. Once \nthe unit root test was performed and it was discovered that the variables are non-stationary in \nlevel  and  stationary  in  the  first  differences  level,  they  were  integrated  of  order  1.  Hence, \nvariables will appear in our SEM in first differences form.  \nIn the next step, in order to identify the cointegrating vectors among the variables, we conduct a \ncointegration analysis using Johansen\u2019s technique by assuming a linear deterministic trend for \ntwo cases, with intercept and with intercept and trend. The results suggested we should accept \nthe null hypothesis of non-cointegrating variables, which means there are no cointegrating \nvectors among the variables. \n3.2  Empirical Results \nA regression would need to be run in order to assess the impact of the BOJ\u2019s easy monetary \npolicy and higher energy prices on the Japanese economy. We ran the regression for our SEM \nusing the weighted two-stage least squares (W2SLS) method. The results are summarized in \nTable 1. W2SLS is an instrumental-variable estimation methodology, for instruments we used \nlagged values of the two exogenous variables we have in this survey: oil price and gas price. \nWe used the Akaike Information Criterion to select the lag orders in which the maximum lag is \nset to three lags of each variable. \nTable 1: Empirical Results  \n  Notation  Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001  Q1 2002\u2013Q2 2014 \nPhillips curve       \np\nInflation rate  \np\n     Lagged inflation rate     (\u22121)  0.89 (4.08)**  -0.36 (-1.12) \n     GDP gap  (y\u2212 y)  0.69 (2.18)*  -0.24 (-0.45) \n     Crude oil price  poil  0.06 (3.27)**  0.07 (2.59)** \n     Gas price  pgas  0.03 (0.45)  0.05 (1.17) \n       \nAggregate Demand \nGDP gap(y\u2212 y)           \n( )\n     Long-term real interest rate    iLN \u2212p     -0.02 (-4.71)**  -0.02 (-1.09) \n( )\n     Lagged GDP gap  y \u2212y     -0.33 (-1.66)  0.42 (1.52) \n(\u22121) (\u22121)\n     Exchange rate  e    0.09 (2.18)*  0.07 (1.17) \n         \nTaylor Rule         \nShort-term interest rate iSN  \np\n     Inflation rate      1.21 (0.67)    1.94 (2.16)* \n     GDP gap  (y\u2212 y)    4.76 (2.72)**     3.89 (3.01)** \nBridge equation           \nLong-term real interest rate iLN \n     Short-term interest rate  iSN    3.50 (3.16)**    4.44 (2.67)* \n \n \nNote: T-statistics are in parentheses; * indicates significance at 5%; ** indicates significance at 1%. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n10 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nThe first part of the empirical results is for the Phillips curve, which is the aggregate supply \nfunction. The y-axis of the Phillips curve is the inflation rate and the x-axis is (y\u2212y), which is the \nGDP gap. Usually the aggregate supply curve is upward slopping, which means the GDP gap \nand the rate of inflation should be positively related. Our results for Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001 are in \naccordance with an upward sloping aggregate supply, which means a larger GDP gap tended to \nlead  to  a  higher  inflation  rate  in  the  first  period. When  the  economy  is  in  an  inflationary \nenvironment, that will accelerate current inflation even more, so in this situation lagged inflation \nshould have a positive impact on the current inflation rate, which is what happened in the first \nperiod of our analysis. However after 2002, Japan was faced with deflation and a decreasing \nGDP gap, so the results show that the lagged inflation rate and the GDP gap in the Phillips \ncurve are not significant in the second period of our analysis, which is valid. This means (i) the \ncurrent year\u2019s inflation was not affected by lagged inflation rates, and (ii) because the economy \nwas in recession, the GDP gap was negative and had no impact on the inflation rate. However, \nthe increasing crude oil price shifted up the aggregate supply curve because imports of oil \ncreated inflationary pressure. Therefore the positive sign of the crude oil price in both periods is \ncorrect. This finding is in accordance with what is happening now in the Japanese economy. As \nmentioned earlier, the second arrow of Abenomics is an aggressive easing of monetary policy. \nAlthough inflation was created after the launch of this policy, we believe this stemmed mainly \nfrom other sources, especially from higher oil prices. Following the easy monetary policy of the \nBOJ, the yen started to depreciate heavily, which raised prices of crude oil and other energy \nimports, pushing up production costs, and creating inflation. Our empirical analysis supports this \nassertion. In the second period, the sign of the output gap in the Phillips curve equation was not \nsignificant, which means that the economy was in recession and aggregate demand did not \nraise enough to have an impact on price levels. However, the higher oil prices in yen, which \nwere mainly a result of easy monetary policy, had significant impact on the general price levels \nand have been a negative development for Japanese manufacturers.   \nFigure 4: Crude Oil Import Price of Japan  \n13000 140\n12000 Imported crude  130\n oil price in US dollars \n  120\n11000\nn \nese ye10000 110100 dollar \nan 9000 S \np 90 U\na\nJ\n8000\n80\nImported crude \n7000 oil price in yen  70\n6000 60\n135791135791135791135\n000001000001000001000\n1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.3.3.3.3.3.3.4.4.4.\n111111111111111111111\n000000000000000000000\n222222222222222222222  \nNote: Import prices are the CIF prices in Japan.

Figure 5 shows the shares of oil, gas, and other energy sources in \nthe energy basket of Japan from January 1994 to June 2014. \nFigure 5: Share of Different Energy Sources in the Japanese Energy Basket,  \nJanuary 1994\u2013June 2014 \n100%\n90% Others (e.g., coal, \n80% nuclear, new energy) \n70%\n60%\nGas \n50%\n40%\n30% Oil \n20%\n10%\n0%\n1197531197531197531197531\n0100000100000100000100000\n4.4.5.6.7.8.9.9.0.1.2.3.4.4.5.6.7.8.9.9.0.1.2.3.4.\n9999999900000000000011111\n9999999900000000000000000\n1111111122222222222222222\n                                       \nNote: Shares are calculated by the calorific value of the energy sources. Oil is imported crude oil + imported petroleum \nproducts. Gas is imported LNG. Other energy sources include coal, nuclear power, hydropower, and new energy.  \nSource: General Energy Statistics, Agency of Resources and Energy, Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry of Japan, \nMETI. \nIt is clear the main energy source for Japan is oil and petroleum products. In the first period of \nour analysis (Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001) the average share of oil and petroleum products in the primary \nenergy demand of Japan was almost 54%, although in the second period (Q1 2002\u2013Q2 2014) \nthis share diminished to about 48%. That is why oil price fluctuations had such an impact on \nJapan\u2019s macroeconomic variables, including the inflation rate in both periods. Gas represents a \nmuch smaller share of Japan\u2019s energy supply, 11% in the first period and 17% in the second. \nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake and catastrophic tsunami in Japan that shut down all \nnuclear power plants in the country, LNG imports increased dramatically and they are still \ngrowing. In future, if Japan continues to keep its nuclear power plants closed, we can expect \nLNG prices to exert a significant influence on the macroeconomic variables of the country.  \nThe next part of Table 1 shows the results for the aggregate demand. When the real interest \nrate goes down, investment should go up, so the sign of the interest rate in the empirical \nfindings should be negative. In both periods it is negative, although after 2002, because of the \nlong-term recession, even when the interest rate was lower, investment did not accelerate, \nwhich is evidence for the vertical IS curve that can be seen in Figure 1. The lagged GDP gap in \nboth periods did not have a significant impact on the current value of GDP. Exchange rates \naffect both exports and imports. If the value of the domestic currency appreciates, this should \nreduce exports and raise imports, meaning aggregate demand should go down. So the sign of \nthe exchange rate in this equation should be positive. In this example both periods show \npositive signs for the exchange rate, although only in the first period it has a significant value. \nThe third part of the empirical results is the Taylor rule, which depends on inflation and the GDP \ngap. If the inflation rate keeps on going up, the central bank will tighten monetary policy, so the \ninflation rate should have a positive sign (Yoshino et al. 2014). In both periods it is positive, but \nonly in the second period is it significant. With regard to the GDP gap, from Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001 \nthis gap was widening. When the current GDP is higher than the full employment GDP, this \n12 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nmeans the economy is accelerating. At this point, the central bank usually tries to tighten the \nmoney market, so the GDP gap in the Taylor rule should have a positive sign. After 2002, Japan \nwas faced with recession, so  y\u2212 y became negative. The central bank then lowered the short-\nterm interest rate, and again the GDP gap in Taylor rule should have a positive sign. \nThe  last  part  of  Table  1  is  for  the  bridge  equation,  which  shows  positive  and  significant \nassociation between the short-term and the long-term nominal interest rates. \n4.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nCurrently the Bank of Japan is trying to achieve an inflation target of 2% by quantitative easing \nin order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. However, the present \ninflation rate may be the result of several factors, in particular the increase in the price of oil in \nyen terms. Based on our empirical results, after Q1 2002, the inflation rate was not affected by \nthe GDP gap but by the higher oil prices as a result of the depreciated Japanese yen. This \nmeans that inflation in Japan may be caused less by a recovery in the Japanese economy than \n6\nby an increase in the oil price, which implies Japan is experiencing stagflation.  In order to avoid \n \nthis, Japan needs growth strategies and changes for the economy, which is dominated by an \naging population. Monetary policy has not had a strong impact on this movement because from \nQ1  2002\u2013Q2  2014,  the  long-term  real  interest  rate  has  not  had  a  significant  impact  on \naggregate demand. The Government of Japan needs to focus on structural change and growth \nstrategy rather than on monetary policy. \n \n   \n                                                \n6 This finding is in accordance with that of Taghizadeh and Yoshino (2014b). They found that higher oil prices create \nmore inflation in advanced economies (US and Japan in their survey) than in emerging economies (the PRC in \ntheir survey). The reason is that in emerging economies aggregate supply is shifting to forward because of higher \ngrowth in outputs, so they can avoid high inflation during oil shocks. \n13 \n ", " ADBI Working Paper 503                                 Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary \n \nREFERENCES \nGal\u00ed, J. 2008.
