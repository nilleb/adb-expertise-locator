INTRODUCTION \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nTrade economists have long argued the case that increased openness to international \nmarkets can, under the right circumstances, boost productivity, which is the backbone \nof  sustained  growth  in  per  capita  incomes.  The  distribution  of  the  gains  from  trade  in  \na  way  that  conforms  to  each  society\u2019s  view  of  equity  is  an  issue  best  addressed  \nby  complementary  policies  such  as  welfare  and  social  safety  net  measures.  But  the \nexperience of many developing countries suggests that trade can be an important part \nof  promoting  economic  growth,  which  can  help  reduce  poverty.  Trade  is  therefore \nintimately  linked  to  Sustainable  Development  Goal  (SDG)  1  which  relates  to  ending \npoverty,  and  SDG  8  which  relates  to  promoting  sustained,  inclusive,  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth.  The  relationship  between  trade  and  growth  is  not  as  simple  and \ndirect  as  was  believed  by  some  commentators  in  the  1990s,  but  there  is  a  broad \nconsensus  that  without  openness  to  international  markets  for  goods,  services,  labor, \nand  capital,  it  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  bring  about  rapid  economic  growth  \nand development. \n\nThe  motivation  for  this  paper  is  not,  however,  to  delve  further  into  the  links  between \ntrade  and  economic  outcomes,  such  as  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Instead,  it \nexamines  the  ways  in  which  openness  to  trade  can  help  improve  development \noutcomes  other  than  through  channels  such  as  income  and  productivity.  It  focuses \nspecifically  on  the  case  of  health.  The  intuition  is  simple:  trade  openness  reduces \nprices  and  increases  access  and  variety  for  consumers.  The  point  holds  just  as \nstrongly for products that are important for health-related development outcomes as it \ndoes  for  consumer  goods.  This  paper  makes  a  case  for  priority  liberalization  of  trade \npolicies  affecting  \u201cdevelopment  products\u201d  such  as  those  used  in  health  services.  It \nargues that trade can, and should, play a role in attaining SDGs other than 1 and 8, in \nparticular SDG 3: ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages. \n\nTrade  and  health  is  an  issue  that  has  been  extensively  examined  over  the  last  \n10\u201315 years. However, that discussion has focused largely on the issue of intellectual \nproperty  rights.  Trade  agreements  now  routinely  include  chapters  on  protection  of \nintellectual property rights. At the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Agreement on \nTrade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  (TRIPS  Agreement)  lays  down \nminimum  standards  for  protection  in  member  states.  Pharmaceuticals  are  a  product \nwhere intellectual property issues loom large from a development standpoint, because \nthere could be a conflict between promoting innovation on the one hand, and extending \naccess to crucial medications on the other. Indeed, many developing countries were so \nconcerned about this conflict in the context of the AIDS epidemic that they successfully \ncampaigned for the 2001 Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health.  \n\nAnother  aspect  of  trade  and  health  that  has  received  considerable  attention  is  the  \ntrade  in  health  services.  Trade  in  health  services  can  be  delivered  in  all  four  modes  \nof supply, as defined by WTO\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services. One of the \nmost  prevalent  forms  of  trade  in  health  services  is  by  medical  travel,  i.e.,  when  a \npatient  seeks  medical  treatment  abroad.  The  focus  of  this  paper  is  on  trade  of  all \nphysical goods that enter the health sector. These goods are either those that can be \nused  directly  for  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  patients  or  those  that  are  necessary  for \ntesting and medical research.  \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 first shows how international trade in health \nproducts  has  evolved  in  recent  years.  It  then  outlines  trade  policies  affecting  six  core \ngroups  of  health-related  products,  and  identifies  their  effects  on  the  world\u2019s  poor. \nSection  3  examines  the  special  case  of  vaccines,  and  reports  on  an  econometric \nanalysis  that  establishes  the  important  role  of  logistics  services\u2014which  are  traded \ninternationally\u2014in  promoting  access.  Section  4  presents  evidence  from  the  world \nmarket for  insulin,  a  crucial  product  in the management  of  diabetes. The final  section \nconcludes, and addresses policy implications. \n\n2.  TRADE AND TRADE POLICIES  \n\nIN HEALTH PRODUCTS \n\nIn terms of economic mechanisms, the most obvious linkage between trade and health \nis on the consumption side. We know that health expenditures around the world have \nbeen  increasing  rapidly,  especially  in  fast-growing  economies.  According  to  general \nprinciples,  open  trade  can  facilitate  the  access  of  health-care  providers  or  patients  to \nhealth products at competitive prices, and in new varieties.  \n\nHelble  (2012)  maps  out  the  \u201cuniverse\u201d  of  health  products  covering  207  subheadings  \nof  the  Harmonized  System  (HS).  The  list  consists  of  products  in  three  groups: \n(i) medicines, (ii) chemicals used in the production of pharmaceuticals, and (iii) hospital \nand  laboratory  inputs  and  equipment  (Figure  1).  This  \u201cuniverse\u201d  of  health  products \nconsists of a carefully selected list. However, as stated by the author, the list is only an \napproximation of the full trade. Some subheadings might include products that are not \nonly  used  in  the  public  health  domains,  such  as  syringes  used  in  medical,  surgical, \ndental,  or  veterinary  sciences  (HS  901831).  On  the  other  hand,  the  author  excludes \nwhere  the  subheading  captures  products  that  are,  in  the  majority,  non-health  related. \nFor  example,  malaria  bed  nets  fall  under  HS  630493:  \u201cNot  knitted  or  crocheted,  of \nsynthetic  fibers;  articles  for  interior  furnishing,  or  synthetic  fibers.\u201d  Despite  these \ncaveats, analyzing international exchanges in these health products gives us important \ninsights into the role of trade for public health. \n\nFigure 1: Product Groups Related to Public Health \n\nSource: Helble (2012). \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\n2.1  International Trade of Health Products \n\nFirst,  we  study  the  evolution  of  world  trade  in  all  health  products  since  2002.  \nWe  therefore  download  all  imports  in  health  products  reported  by  201  countries.  \nFigure  2  depicts  the  evolution  of  international  trade  of  health  products  since  2002  by \nworld  region  (World  Bank  classification  of  world  regions).  Overall,  we  observe  that \ninternational  trade  in  health  products  increased  rapidly.  The  biggest  trader  of  health \nproducts  is  region  Europe  and  Central  Asia.  North  America  is  the  second-largest \nmarket for health products. However, developing countries have been expanding their \nrole as a provider of health products.  \n\nFigure 2: Trade in Health Products 2002\u20132014 by Region  \n(measured by imports reported by countries) \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 shows the relative shares of the seven world regions. Europe and Central Asia \nas  well  as  North  America  account  for  the  lion\u2019s  share  in  international  trade  in  health \nproducts. However, their combined share fell from 81.9% in 2002 to 74.0% in 2014. As \na corollary, the shares of regions with developing countries rose steadily. The share of \nEast  Asia  and  the  Pacific  increased  from  less  than  11.7%  in  2002  to  16.0%  in  2014. \nThe relative increase was largest in South Asia (from 0.1% to 1.5%) and Sub-Saharan \nAfrica (from  0.6% to  1.2%). Despite the considerable  expansion  of the market  shares  \nof  developing  countries,  one  should  not  forget  that  the  developing  countries  also  \nhave by far the largest needs. If we take the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development  (OECD)  membership  as  a  benchmark  for  the  level  of  economic \ndevelopment,  we  know  that  the  population  share  of  non-OECD  countries  was  about \n83%  of  the  world  in  2014;  however,  the  imports  of  health  products  only  amounted  \nto  24%.  The  example  of  South  Asia  illustrates  this  point.  Even  though  South  Asia \nrepresents 24% of the world population, it only absorbs 1.5% of internationally traded \nhealth products. There is, of course, a significant production of some health products in \nthat region, but substitution of local production for imports could result in higher prices \nor reduced access to high-quality varieties in some cases. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nFigure 3: Shares of Trade in Health Products 2002\u20132014 by Region  \n(measured by imports reported by countries)  \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n2.2   Tariffs on Health Products \n\n \n\nTariffs  and  nontariff  measures  (NTMs)  restrict  access  to  health  products.  Tariffs  are \nrelatively  easy  to  measure  as  they  are  reported  to  international  bodies,  including  the \nWTO.  In  contrast,  comparable  international  records  on  NTMs  are  sparse.  Yet,  NTMs \nplay  an  important  role  for  health  products.  Developed  countries,  in  particular,  have \nstringent  standards  for  medicines  and  other  health  products.  It  is  important  to \nemphasize at the outset that although some NTMs, such as quality controls, can have \nimportant public benefits that justify their use, the same cannot be said of tariffs. Tariffs \nsimply transfer income from consumers to local producers and the government, with an \nadditional  cost  in  economic  efficiency.  There  is  no  public  policy  objective,  such  as \nconsumer  protection,  that  is  achieved  by  tariffs.  Conceivably,  there  could  be  an \nargument  that,  in  order  to  promote  infant  industries  in  developing  countries,  it  is \nimportant  to  protect  producers  of  health  products.  However,  that  position  has  proved \nproblematic  in  historical  context,  as  infants  rarely  \u201cgrow  up.\u201d  In  addition,  it  is  difficult, \nfrom  a  development  perspective,  to  accept  that  promotion  of  a  particular  domestic \nindustry  trumps  the  public  health  objective  of  ensuring  maximum  possible  access  to \nhealth products. \n\nTo  assess  the  barrier  stemming  from  tariffs,  we  first  downloaded  the  latest  applied \nMost  Favored  Nation  (MFN)  tariffs  for  the  six  commodity  introduced  above  for \n160 countries.  The  simple  averages  of  the  applied  MFN  tariff  across  all  countries  for \nthe  six  commodity  groups  are  presented  in  Figure  4.  At  this  level  of  aggregation,  we \nobserve  that  the  average  tariffs  are  rather  low,  ranging  between  2.8%  and  4.4%. \nHowever,  the  simple  average  hides  substantial  difference  across  regions,  across \ncountries, and across individual products. In a second step, we therefore look at seven \ndifferent regions.  \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nFigure 4: Applied Most Favored Nation Tariff on Health Product Groups  \n\nNote: Tariff data based on latest available year, but not older than 2010. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nFigure 5: Applied Most Favored Nation Tariff on Health Product Groups  \nby World Region  \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: Tariff data based on latest available year, but not older than 2010. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nAverage  applied  tariff  MFN  rates,  by World  Bank  developing  region,  are  presented  in \nFigure  5.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  these  are  statutory  tariff  rates  that  apply  \nto everyday imports of health-related products. In cases of emergency relief, countries \ntypically  do  not  levy  customs  duties  on  incoming  supplies.  So  the  focus  here  is  \non policies that can affect the general level of health and health-care service provision \nin  a  country  in  ordinary  times,  not  emergencies.  We  note  that  the  tariffs  have  \nbeen  coming  down  in  the  past  years.  On  average,  the  most  protected  developing \nregion  is  South Asia.  Although  the  average  tariff  is  relatively  low,  at  about  8%  for \npharmaceuticals  and  6%  for  medical  instruments,  it  seems  difficult  to  justify  at  all  on \ndevelopment grounds, as discussed earlier. \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nOn average, tariff rates on pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are relatively low, \nand  a  wide  range  of  countries  allow  duty-free  access.  However,  the  fact  that  tariffs \npersist  at  all  is  puzzling  in  light  of  the  importance  of  ensuring  access  to  affordable \nmedicines for poor people. From a political economy perspective, it would be important \nto know what forces in some developing countries align to prevent the entry of low-cost \nhealth products from the world market. In some cases, it is likely infant industries. But \nthere also appear to be countries that levy tariffs on imported medicines even though \nthey do not have significant domestic capacity.  \n\nMoreover, the regional averages conceal considerable variation across countries. The \ntwo  largest  countries  in  South  Asia  also  have  the  highest  tariffs:  India  at  10%  and \nPakistan  at  12%.  In  the  case  of  India,  protection  of  the  domestic  pharmaceuticals \nindustry  is  one  possible  political  economy  explanation  for  the  existence  of  this \nsignificant import tax. However, that industry is already globally competitive and seems \nto have little need of protection on infant industry grounds. Countries in other regions, \noften without significant domestic manufacturing capacity, also impose significant tariffs \non  pharmaceuticals.  Examples  include  Tunisia  and  Djibouti  (11%),  Ghana  (9%),  and \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (8%). \n\nIn  most  regions,  average  tariff  rates  on  medical  equipment  are  lower  than  for \npharmaceuticals.  However,  the  averages  again  mask  considerable  cross-country \nvariation: in fact, the countries with the highest tariffs in this sector apply them at levels \nthat far exceed those for pharmaceuticals. For example, Djibouti taxes foreign medical \ninstruments at an average rate of 24%, Iran applies a 14% tariff, and rates in the next \n10  most  protected  countries  (covering  five  of  the  six  World  Bank  regions)  are \napproximately  10%.  There  are  undoubtedly  political  economy  motivations  for  these \ntariffs in each country, in addition to possible revenue-raising objectives.  \n\nTo  have  a  more  detailed  looked  at  the  tariff  levels  of  health  products,  we  study  the \ntariffs at the highest level of disaggregation, 6 digit HS. For our analysis, we look at the \nlatest available tariff (but not older than 2010) of 158 countries in 190 health products. \nOut  of  the  possible  30,020  observations,  we  are  able  to  gather  20,486  tariff  lines.  In \nTable  1,  we  measure  the  percentage  of  tariff  lines  that  are  equal  or  above  a  certain \nlevel. We observe that on less than 55% of all tariff lines are import duties of less than \n5%  levied.  On  more  than  13%  of  all  tariff  lines,  the  import  duties  are  still  above  10% \nand on almost 5% of the tariffs lines, we found rates above 15%.  \n\nTable 1: Percentage of Tariff Lines Protected with High Import Duties \n\n \n\nTariff level \n\nPercentage of Tariff Lines with a Tariff of \u2026 \n<15% \n\n0% \n\n5%\u226410% \n27.6% \n\n10%\u226415% \n7.3% \n\n2.1% \n\n% of tariff lines \n\n49.0% \n\nNote: Tariff data based on latest available year, but not older than 2010. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nTo know the countries that still maintain high tariffs on health products, we counted the \nnumber of countries that have at least half of their tariff lines above a certain threshold \nof import duties. Table 2 presents the results. In our sample, 25 countries impose on at \nleast  half  of  their  health products  import  duties  of  above  5%.  Among these  countries, \nwe  find  a  few  advanced  economies  such  as  Chile  and  the  Republic  of  Korea. \nFurthermore,  the  list  includes  two  large  countries:  Brazil  and  India.  However,  most  of \nthe  countries  are  among  the  poorest  in  the  world,  including  several  least-developed \ncountries in Africa and Asia. Table 2 also presents the results when the cutoff of 10%, \n15%,  and 20%  is  applied.  Logically,  the  number  of  countries falls.  In  the  last  column, \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nwe  see  that  the  Bahamas,  Djibouti,  and  Bermuda  are  the  countries  with  the  highest \nprotection of health products.  \n\nTable 2: Countries with High Applied Tariffs on Health Products \n\nApplied Tariff  \n(simple average) \n25.9 \n\nApplied Tariff  \n(simple average) \n6.3 \n\nCountry Name \n\nThe Bahamas \n\nDjibouti \nBermuda \nAnguila \nIran, Islamic Republic of \nMaldives \nGhana \nCuba \nIndia \nEthiopia \nAruba \nNepal \nCameroon \nPakistan \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nCountry Name \n\nCongo, Democratic \nRepublic of the \nCentral African Republic \nBrazil \nAlgeria \nChad \nArgentina \nThe Gambia \nSierra Leone \nVenezuela \nFrench Polynesia \nUzbekistan \nBangladesh \nSamoa \nLao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic \n\n20.0 \n15.1 \n14.8 \n12.2 \n10.8 \n10.0 \n8.1 \n8.0 \n7.7 \n7.6 \n6.8 \n6.8 \n6.7 \n\nTable 3: Most Protected Products with Applied Tariffs Above 10%  \nby Number of Countries \n\nNumber of Countries with \nApplied Tariff above 10% \n54 \n\nProduct \nCode \n\n900630 \n\n940210 \n940290 \n401511 \n300692 \n701720 \n290410 \n701790 \n\n401490 \n\nProduct Description \n\nCameras for medical or surgical examination  \n(or other purposes)  \nDentists', barbers', or similar chairs and parts thereof \nOther medical, surgical, dental, or veterinary furniture \nSurgical gloves of vulcanized rubber \nWaste pharmaceuticals \nLaboratory, hygienic, or pharmaceutical glassware \nSulfonated derivatives of hydrocarbons \nOther laboratory, hygienic, or pharmaceutical \nglassware \nOther hygienic or pharmaceutical articles of \nvulcanized rubber \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3 \n6.1 \n6.0 \n6.0 \n6.0 \n5.9 \n5.7 \n5.7 \n5.4 \n5.4 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n5.1 \n\n48 \n32 \n30 \n30 \n25 \n25 \n23 \n\n23 \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nThe  analysis  allowed  us  to  better  gauge  the  distribution  of  the  applied  tariffs  as  well  \nas  to  know  the  countries  that  maintain  the  highest  tariff  levels.

All  these  additional  purposes  probably  account,  in  \nmost  countries,  for  a  small  share  compared  with  cameras  used  for  medical  or  \nsurgical purposes.) \n\nIn Tables 4 and 5, we highlight two product groups with particularly high tariffs: surgical \ngloves  and  cameras  for  medical  or  surgical  examinations.  Nineteen  countries  levy \napplied  tariffs  of  20%  or  more  on  surgical  gloves.  It  is  difficult  to  see  which  of  these \ncountries could have an interest in protecting a domestic industry of surgical gloves, as \nseveral  of  the  countries  are  small  economies  with  small  industrial  bases.  For  health \ncare,  surgical  rubber  gloves  are  heavily  used  and  thus  constitute  an  important  input. \nLowering  the  tariffs  for  rubber  gloves  could  therefore  make  a  direct  contribution  to \nlower health-care costs.  \n\nCameras for medical or surgical examination of internal organs are another example of \nhealth products with high tariffs. The list of countries with applied tariffs exceeding 20% \nincludes  46  countries,  of  which  almost  20  are  least-developed  countries.  The  less \ndeveloped and least-developed countries, in particular, have no domestic industry that \nmight compete with imports. Levying high tariffs is a direct burden for public health. \n\nWe  have  just  examined  several  specific  types  of  health-related  products,  albeit \nimportant ones. The findings are symptomatic of a more general problem: activist trade \npolicies  that  insulate  countries  from  world  markets  can  push  up  prices  and  limit \navailability of important development products, i.e., goods that play a particular role in \npromoting  the  SDGs  other  than  through  income  channels.  Trade  can  be  a  lever  to \npromote non-income objectives in the SDGs such as the health goals of SDG 3. \n\nTable 4: Countries with an Applied Most Favored Nation Tariff of 20% or More  \non Surgical Gloves of Vulcanized Rubber (Harmonized System Code 401511) \n\nAlgeria \nThe Bahamas \nBotswana \nCongo, Rep. of the \nDjibouti \nFiji \nThe Gambia \nIran, Islamic Rep. of \nJordan \nLesotho \n\nNote: Least-developed countries in bold. \n\nSource: Authors. \n\n \n\nMaldives \nNamibia \nPakistan \nSamoa \nSouth Africa \nSwaziland \nTonga \nTuvalu \nViet Nam \n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nTable 5: Countries with an Applied Most Favored Nation Tariff of 20% or More  \non Specially Designed Cameras (Harmonized System Code 900630) \n\nAlgeria \nAnguila \nAntigua and Barbuda \nThe Bahamas \nBarbados \nBelize \nBenin \nBurkina Faso \nCambodia \nCameroon \nCentral African Republic \nChad \nCongo, Dem.

If \nappropriately  designed  and  implemented,  such  NTMs  can  further  important  public \npolicy  objectives  such  as  ensuring  consumer  safety  and  promoting  public  health.  Our \nintention  is  not  to  suggest  that  they  be  rolled  back,  but  instead  to  highlight  their \nprevalence and to highlight the need for detailed assessments of the costs and benefits \nof different regulatory options. \n\nfrom  various \n\nNTMs  are  notoriously  difficult  to  measure  and  quantify.  In  2009,  a  group  of  technical \nexperts \ninternational  organizations  developed  a  classification  of \n16 chapters,  ranging  from  technical  regulations  (chapter  1),  conformity  assessments \n(chapter  2),  pre-shipment  inspections  (chapter  3),  to  rules  of  origin  (chapter  15)  and \nexport-related measures (chapter 16). The data collection effort is still under way, and \nresults  are  currently  available  for  a  small  number  of  developing  countries  only. \nNonetheless, we review them in this paper. We also address some previous work that \nlooks directly at the health sector. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nOne of the rare surveys that studies NTMs was undertaken by the International Trade \nCenter  in  2010  (International  Trade  Center  2011),  focusing  on  antimalarial  products. \nThe  survey  was  based  on  phone  interviews  with  29  importers  and  6  exporters  of \nantimalarial  products  in  mostly  developing  countries.  Even  though  the  sample  size  is \nrather small, the results clearly show that NTMs are a major obstacle for international \ntrade  in  health  products.  The  authors  found  that  60%  of  interviewees  faced \nburdensome NTMs; only nongovernment organizations and international organizations \ndid  not  report  major  NTMs.  The  most  commonly  reported  NTM  related  to  product \nregistration  and  inspection  requirements.  Almost  half  of  NTMs  were  perceived  as \nburdensome  because  of  delays  in  administrative  procedures,  high  fees  and  charges, \nas well as lack of transparency and necessity for bribes. Several cases were reported \nin  which  the  product  registration  took  several  months  or  even  1  year.  Inspection  at \ncustoms  seems  to  take  a  long  time  due  to  congestion  in  the  port  and  insufficient \ncapacity of customs. Furthermore, many respondents reported that additional charges \nand  taxes  other  than  customs  duties  had  to  be  paid,  ranging  between  5%  and  10%. \nFinally,  high transportation  costs  between  or  within  countries  increase costs  of  drugs. \nThe  International  Trade  Center\u2019s  survey  on  antimalarial  drugs  illustrates  how  NTMs \nadd substantially to the final price of health products.  \n\nMore anecdotal evidence for NTMs comes from different country cases. For example, \nNigeria  bans  the  import  of  various  pharmaceutical  products.  The  ad  valorem  tariff  in \nthat case is effectively infinite on the covered products. Of particular concern is the fact \nthat  the  prohibition  list  includes  chloroquine,  a  drug  used  in  the  prevention  and \ntreatment  of  malaria,  as  well  as  various  antibiotics  and  deworming  treatments.  All  of \nthese  products  have  special  significance  in terms  of  health  outcomes  in  a  developing \ncountry like Nigeria. The rationale for the import bans is unclear, but there is likely to be \na political economy motivation. \n\nMehta (2005) reports findings based on interviews with 10 pharmaceutical enterprises \nin  India.  The  firms  produced  bulk  drugs  (intermediates  and  active  pharmaceutical \ningredients, A2 in our classification) and finished formulations in various dosage forms \n(A1  in  our  classification).  They  exported  to  developed  countries  and  developing \ncountries. The firms seemed to suffer from various kinds of NTMs in overseas markets, \nincluding  company  registration,  product  registration, World  Health  Organization\u2013Good \nManufacturing  Practice  certification,  packaging  and  labeling  requirements,  import  \nbans,  antidumping  measures,  and  pre-shipment  inspection.  The  incidence  of  NTMs \nvaried  across  export  markets.  In  developed  countries,  pharmaceutical  producers  in \nIndia  were  mainly  confronted  with  one  main  type  of  NTM  (company  and  product \nregistration),  while  in  developing  and  transition  economies,  various  NTMs  had  to  be \novercome.  Furthermore,  the  companies  reported  that  compliance  with  NTMs  involved \nconsiderable  financial  costs  and  time.  It  is  important  to  stress  that  although  some  of \nthese NTMs may have legitimate public policy objectives, others, like import bans and \nantidumping duties, are firmly rooted in the protection of markets, not people. \n\nThe  newly  updated,  though  only  partially  complete,  the  United  Nations  Conference  \non  Trade  and  Development (UNCTAD) Trade  Analysis  Information  System  (TRAINS) \ndatabase  makes  it  possible  to  give  more  systematic  insights  into  these  kinds  of \nquestions.  We  take  the  example  of  pharmaceutical  products  as  the  most  useful \nimplementation of new data, the NTM-Map database is organized at the two-digit level. \nOf  course,  pharmaceuticals  are  heavily  regulated  in  most  jurisdictions,  and  important \npublic  policy  objectives  are  furthered  by  many  such  regulations.  Nonetheless,  the \nprevalence  of  NTMs  is  striking.  Taking  the  sector  as  a  whole,  32  of  the  covered \ncountries  report  that  100%  of  pharmaceutical  imports  are  covered  by  some  kind  of \nNTM. Only 13 report a coverage ratio of less than 100%. Of those 13, coverage ratios \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nrange from 1% in Cote d\u2019Ivoire to just under 100% in Uruguay, with typical numbers in \nexcess of 50%. This preliminary analysis indicates that NTMs are very common in most \ncountries in the pharmaceuticals sector. \n\nIt  is  important  to  look  at  the  type  of  NTMs  being  used,  however.  Some  may  be \nimportant  for  public  health  and  consumer  protection,  at  least  if  well  administered,  \nwhile  others  may  be  more  protectionist  in  intent.  NTM-Map  database  distinguishes \nfive types  of  NTMs:  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  (SPS),  technical  barriers  to  \ntrade (TBTs), customs formalities, contingent protection (antidumping, safeguards, and \ncountervailing  duties),  and  quantity  control  measures  (such  as  licenses  and  quotas).  \nOf  these,  clearly  the  first  two  are  potentially  the  most  relevant  to  issues  such  as \nconsumer protection. \n\nTable 6 presents a breakdown of each economy\u2019s NTMs, showing coverage ratios for \nthe  five  categories  identified  in  the  previous  paragraph.  SPS  and  TBT  measures  are \ntypically  the  most  prevalent,  which  could  be  in  line  with  the  public  interest  if  the \nmeasures are appropriately designed and administered. Indeed, the absence of these \nmeasures  in  some  countries  (such  as  Cote  d\u2019Ivoire,  Guatemala,  and  Senegal)  is  a \ncause for concern. There need to be adequate quality controls in place to ensure that \npharmaceuticals, whether locally produced or imported, are safe and effective. \n\nThe other categories of NTMs are more troubling from an access and efficiency point  \nof  view.  Quantity  controls,  such  as  licenses  and  quotas,  are  applied  by  a  number  of \ncountries. Although licensing may be appropriate as a way of ensuring quality control, \nthe risk  is  that quantity control  measures  can  be  used to protect the  domestic market \nfor incumbents, or reduce efficiency and access considerably. This area is perhaps one \nthat  needs  attention  going  forward.  Customs  formalities  also  stand  out  in  some \ncountries. In line with recent advances in trade facilitation, there is a clear rationale for \nstreamlining  customs  formalities.  Although  administration  of  SPS  and  TBT  measures \nmay  require  some  additional formalities  at the  border, they  should  be kept  as  light  as \npossible.  Finally,  Pakistan  stands  out  for  its  extensive  use  of  contingent  protection \nmeasures against foreign pharmaceuticals. There is no public health rationale for these \nNTMs, and they are much more likely to be protectionist in intent and effect.  \n\nTable 6: Percentage of Imports by Value Affected by Listed Nontariff Measures, \nlatest available year, World Integrated Trade Solution \u2013 Trade Analysis \nInformation System  \n\n \n\nAfghanistan \nArgentina \nBenin \nBolivia \nBrazil \nBurkina Faso \nCape Verde \nChile \nChina, People\u2019s \nRepublic of \nColombia \nCroatia \n\nSPS  \n(%) \n0 \n96 \n0 \n78 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n86 \n0 \n\n91 \n16 \n\nTBT  \n(%) \n100 \n100 \n85 \n100 \n100 \n74 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n\n100 \n100 \n\nCustoms  \n(%) \n0 \n97 \n85 \n0 \n54 \n100 \n0 \n64 \n0 \n\nContingent \nProtection (%) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nQuantity \nControl (%) \n31 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n66 \n\n14 \n5 \n\n0 \n0 \n\n100 \n2 \n\ncontinued on next page \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nTable 6 continued \n\n \n\nCuba \nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire \nEcuador \nEl Salvador \nEstonia \nEuropean Union \nGambia \nGhana \nGuatemala \nGuinea \nHonduras \nHong Kong, China \nIndia \nKazakhstan \nMalawi \nMali \nMexico \nNepal \nNicaragua \nNiger \nNigeria \nPakistan \nPanama \nParaguay \nPeru \nRussian Federation \nRwanda \nSenegal \nSri Lanka \nTajikistan \nTogo \nTurkey \nUruguay \nVenezuela \n\nSource: Authors. \n\nSPS  \n(%) \n40 \n0 \n81 \n100 \n19 \n28 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n73 \n11 \n70 \n100 \n0 \n74 \n100 \n100 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n94 \n89 \n0 \n100 \n2 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n57 \n83 \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nTBT  \n(%) \n61 \n0 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n100 \n99 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n100 \n92 \n100 \n96 \n95 \n95 \n93 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n100 \n89 \n96 \n100 \n99 \n\nCustoms  \n(%) \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n8 \n4 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n98 \n0 \n0 \n55 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n40 \n0 \n\nContingent \nProtection (%) \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n39 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nQuantity \nControl (%) \n61 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n11 \n0 \n75 \n0 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n100 \n83 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n6 \n100 \n100 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n0 \n0 \n54 \n0 \n\nSPS = sanitary and phytosanitary measures, TBT = technical barrier to trade. \n\nEven though we lack systematic empirical evidence on NTMs for health products in all \ncountries,  the  studies  demonstrate  the  importance  of  NTMs.  It  seems  that  health \nproducts  in  developing  countries  are  subject  to  these  additional  trade  barriers.  The \npresence  of  numerous  NTMs  translates  into  additional  large  costs  for  importers  and \npatients. We conjecture that import duties are only a small fraction of the costs that are \ninvolved in importing health products. To ease trade in health products, the reduction of \nNTMs is as important as tariff elimination.  \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nOverall,  we  have  strong  evidence  that  tariffs  and  NTMs  both  considerably  undercut \nsome  countries\u2019  ability  to  move  forward  on  SDG  3.  The  effect  of  tariffs  and  NTMs  on \nhealth  products  is  to  push  prices  up,  and  limit  availability  on  the  domestic  market. \nThere is no health rationale for putting in place tariffs that make it harder for consumers \nto  access  important  health-related  goods.  Indeed,  the  opposite  is  true:  increased \nopenness  would  undoubtedly  result  in  lower  prices  and  improved  availability,  which \nwould  help  promote  improved  health  outcomes.  Some  NTMs  might  be  justified  to \nprotect  public  health.  However,  many  NTMs  seem  to  be  more  burdensome  than \nnecessary,  and  even  necessary  NTMs  need  to  be  administered  in  an  efficient  and \ntransparent way. As a result, access to health products is more expensive, delayed, or \nimpossible.  We  still  lack  systematic  data  to  quantify  combined  impact  of  tariffs  and \nunnecessary  NTMs.  However,  we  can  certainly  state  that  both  significantly  hinder \naccess to health products and are thus bad for health. \n\n3.  CASE STUDY 1: VACCINES \n\nThe previous section showed that a variety of countries continue to apply active trade \npolicies to health-related products, and it argued that the result would be to decrease \navailability and increase cost, which is a negative outcome in terms of SDG 3. So what \ndo the data say about trade policy and health outcomes? This section provides some \nbasic exploratory analysis, focusing on example of vaccines. \n\nThe lens for looking at trade and vaccination rates as a health outcome is logistics, an \ninternationally  traded  service.1 The  rationale  for  expecting  a  connection  between  the \ntwo is that vaccines require careful handling if they are to be moved from port or factory \nto the hinterland in a usable state. To measure trade policy, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics \nPerformance Index (LPI) is used, specifically the subindex measuring the competence \nand  quality  of  logistics  services\u2014a  variable  that  should  be  linked  to  trade  policy. \nResults  are  presented  using  the  immunization  rate  for  diphtheria,  pertussis,  and \ntetanus, but similar conclusions follow if the measles immunization rate is used instead. \n\nFigure 6 shows the association between the two variables. The line of best fit is upward \nsloping,  in  line  with  the  contention  that  better  logistics  and  trade  facilitation \nperformance is associated with better handling of vaccines, which in turn increases the \nimmunization rate. The association is statistically significant at the 1% level (R2 = 0.16). \nMoreover,  the  association  between  these  two  variables  remains  strong  even  when \nconfounding  influences  are  accounted  for.  Shepherd  and  Pasadilla  (2011)  report \nresults  from  an  OLS  regression  of  the  immunization  rate  on  the  LPI  logistics \ncompetence  index,  with  a  set  of  control  variables  including  per  capita gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP),  the  percentage  of  GDP  spent  on  health,  and  an  index  of  government \neffectiveness  from  the  World  Governance  Indicators.  The  coefficient  on  the  LPI \nremains statistically significant at the 1% level. In addition, an interaction term with per \ncapita  GDP  is  negative,  which  indicates  that  the  association  between  logistics \nperformance  and  the  vaccination  rate  is  stronger  in  lower-income  countries.  These \nresults  hold  even  if  a  dummy  is  introduced  for  Sub-Saharan  African  countries,  the \nregion  where  vaccination  is  most  problematic  and  logistics  weakest.  The  evidence  in \nthis  case  connecting  better  trade  policy\u2014in  this  case  improved  logistics  and  trade \nfacilitation\u2014with improved health outcomes in terms of SDG 3 is strong. \n\n                                                \n1   This  section  draws  on  B.

CASE STUDY 2: INSULIN \n\nTrade  openness  is  typically  a  necessary,  but  not  sufficient,  condition  to  ensure  that \nprices are lower compared with a closed regime. In the field of pharmaceuticals, prices \nare  often  regulated  and/or  the  pharmaceutical  companies  enjoy  monopoly  power.  In \nthis  subsection,  we  would  like  to  study  the  case  of  insulin,  which  is  the  main  drug  to \ncounter  diabetes.  As  diabetes  has  become  a  major  public  health  problem  around  the \nworld, insulin trade has also increased rapidly. In contrast to most other drugs, insulin \nhas two dedicated HS subheadings. Most insulin products are traded under HS 300331 \n\u201cmedicaments  containing  insulin  (not  in  measured  doses  or  put  up  for  retail  sale).\u201d \nHS 300431  covers  medicaments  containing  insulin  put  in  packings  for  retail  sale,  for \nwhich international trade is more than 99% (in value terms) compared with international \ntrade  of  HS  300331.  For  our  analysis,  we  will  therefore  only  study  trade  flows  and \ntariffs for HS 300431.  \n\nAs  we  can  see  in  Figure  7,  trade  in  insulin  has  increased  drastically  over  the  last \n2 decades,  both  in  terms  of  volume  (kilogram)  and  value  (US$).  The  expansion  is \nparticularly marked after 2000.  \n\nFigure  8  illustrates  the  import  values  of  medicaments  containing  insulin  among \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries  and  \nnon-OECD  countries,  setting  the  value  in  1995  as  100.  The  need  for  insulin  appears  \nto  be  growing  in  both  country  groups.  However,  whereas  OECD  countries  started  to \nimport much more from 2000 onward, non-OECD countries followed only a few years \nlater. From 2000 to 2013, insulin imported in value terms by OECD countries grew by \n13.96% annually while that imported by non-OECD countries grew by 15.05%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nFigure 7: Evolution of Volumes and Values of Harmonized System Code 300431, \n1995\u20132013 \n\nSource: Helble and Aizawa (2016). \n\nFigure 8: Evolution of Imports of Harmonized System Code 300431  \n($, indexed to 1995 = 100) \n\n \n\n \n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n\nSource: Helble and Aizawa (2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nThe  global  insulin  market  is  dominated  by  three  major  pharmaceutical  companies: \nNovo  Nordisk,  Eli  Lilly,  and  Sanofi-Aventis.  However,  more  and  more \nlocal \nmanufacturers  in  off-patent  countries  have  become  active  in  the  market,  especially  in \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  and  the  Russian  Federation.  The  insulin \nmedicines  produced  by  different  producers  yield  comparable  health  outcomes. \nHowever,  the  prices  charged  by  different  producers  and  across  countries  differ \nconsiderably.  Figure  9  shows  the  evolution  of  the  average  landed  unit  prices2 for  HS \n300431  coming from OECD  countries  and  non-OECD  countries. We observe  that  the \nprice for insulin imported from OECD countries is substantially and continuously higher \ncompared with the price levied by producers in non-OECD countries.  \n\nFigure 9: Evolution of Average Import Unit Prices of Harmonized  \nSystem Code 300431, 1995\u20132013  \n(simple average) \n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n\nSource: Helble and Aizawa (2016). \n\n \n\nThe  source  of  the  traded  insulin,  however,  is  only  one  determinant  of  the  price.  \nHelble  and  Aizawa  (2016)  analyze  the  trade  and  prices  of  insulin  for  186  importing \ncountries  between  1995  and  2013  and  study  various  determinants  explaining  the  \nprice  differences  across  countries  and  years.  The  authors  find  that  pharmaceutical \ncompanies  systematically  apply  price  discrimination.  In  other  words,  the  higher  the \nnational  income  per  capita,  the  higher  the  price  for  insulin.  More  interestingly,  the \nauthors  find  evidence  that  market  forces  attenuate  the  potential  for  discriminating \nprices fully. Their study shows that the greater the number of sources a country uses to \nimport  insulin  and  the  larger  the  volume,  the  lower  the  price  tends  to  be.  In  addition, \ninstitutional factors seem to play a role. In countries where most of the expenditure is \nout-of-pocket,  prices  seem  to  be  higher,  indicating  that  atomistic  buyers  have  less \nnegotiating power. Finally, lower tariffs appear to have a significant effect on prices.  \n\n                                                \n2   The unit price is defined as the ratio between value and weight. In the case of insulin, the weight is in \n\nkilograms. Unit values are commonly used in the trade literature as a proxy for prices per unit.  \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nOverall,  the  study  shows  that  trade  has  become  a  vital  instrument  to  fight  diabetes \ninsulin  across  the  world.  However,  an  open  trade  regime  is  not  enough  to  guarantee \nlow prices. Pharmaceutical companies often attempt to discriminate prices according to \nincome levels. Governments can counteract by enlarging the pool of source countries \nand  by  building  up  health  systems  that  lower  out-of-pocket  payments.  This  example \nshows  that  trade  can  be  an  important  force  in  promoting  improved  health  outcomes, \nbut it of course cannot succeed alone. General health policy is of course vital. The key, \nas explored in this paper, is in getting the two to work productively together. \n\n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nThis paper has provided a first look at one important non-income linkage from a more \nopen trading system to the SDGs, specifically SDG 3, which deals with health. There is \nclear  evidence  that  developing  countries  apply  tariffs  and  NTMs  that  have  the  effect  \nof  increasing  prices  and  decreasing  availability  of  health-related  products  such  as \npharmaceuticals,  vaccines,  and  medical  equipment.  The  case  for  liberalizing  trade  in \nthese products is strong. In addition, there is compelling evidence that improving trade \nfacilitation  performance\u2014using  the WTO\u2019s  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  as  a  starting \npoint\u2014could  be  linked  to  improved  handling  of  health-related  products  such  as \nvaccines, which in turn would boost usage. The case of insulin showed that trade is key \nfor  the  supply  of  insulin  to  patients  across  the  world.  Studying  the  price  differences \nacross  countries,  we  observed  that  the  price  of  insulin  has  various  determinants. \nPharmaceutical  companies  typically  charge  higher  prices  in  markets  with  higher  per \ncapita  income.  The  level  of  competition  and  size  of  the  market  are  additional  factors \nthat influence the final price. Government can try to leverage the competition between \nmanufacturers  as  well  as  their  purchasing  power  to  bring  down  the  price  of  insulin. \nBuilding  up  health  systems  that  lower  out-of-pocket  payments  is  another  option  to \nmake insulin more affordable to patients.  \n\nOne  area  of  tension  for  trade  and  health  outcomes  is  the  protection  of  intellectual \nproperty rights. That protection can promote innovation by pharmaceutical companies, \nwhich, in turn, can improve patient outcomes. However, market size effects combined \nwith  the  very  high  development  costs  for  new  medications  mean  that  even  strong \nprotection of intellectual property rights has proved insufficient to generate treatments \nfor  some  common  developing  country  ailments  like  malaria.  However,  private  sector \nfunding  through  foundations  is  changing  that  position  somewhat,  by  providing \nincentives for development-relevant drug research. \n\nIt is important to remember that the principal constraint in terms of improving people\u2019s \nhealth  in  developing  countries  is  the  weakness  of  the  health  services  sector  and \ndelivery  systems.  For  many  conditions,  medicines  are  available  and  off-patent,  which \nmeans  they  can  be  produced  quite  cheaply,  including  by  developing  country \nmanufacturers  of  generics  in  countries  such  as  India  and  Brazil.  Facilitating  the \nmovement of generic drugs to poorer developing countries is an important health policy \nobjective,  but  one  that  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  public  and  private  sector  spending  \non  health  care,  including  through  the  development  of  delivery  infrastructure  and \nprofessional  services.  We  therefore  need  to  stress  the  importance  of  complementary \npolicies such as infrastructure and human resources development, as an adjunct to a \nliberal trade policy in relation to health products. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nAlthough  trade  has  a  relatively  low  profile  in  the  SDGs  and  their  companion  targets,  \nit  is  by  no  means  absent  from  the  package  of  measures  available  to  policy  makers  \nto  promote  the  SDGs.  Trade  economists  need  to  do  more  to  show  that  trade  can \nbenefit  sustainable  development  through  non-income  channels. Work on liberalization \nof environmental goods and services is another important example from outside health: \nby  the  same  reasoning  as  was  presented  here,  liberalization  in  these  sectors  can \ndirectly  help  achieve  the  SDGs  by  promoting  sustainability.  Future  policy  research \ncould  usefully  concentrate  on  identifying  more  examples  like  health  and  the \nenvironment\u2014areas  in  which  trade  can  promote  sustainable  development  through  \nnon-income  channels.  Similarly,  analysts  in  other  areas  featured  more  prominently  in \nthe  SDGs  should  be  looking  to  include  trade  in  the  conversation  on  how  best  to \npromote sustainable and inclusive growth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 643 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nHelble and Shepherd \n\nHelble, M. 2012.

At  the  same  time,  trade  in  health  products  is \nhampered  by  substantive  trade  barriers.  In  this  paper,  we  present  evidence  that  countries \naround the  world  still  apply  tariffs  and  nontariff measures that  increase prices  and  limit  the \navailability  of  health-related  products  such  as  pharmaceuticals,  vaccines,  and  medical \nequipment. The case for liberalizing trade in these products is therefore strong. In addition, \nwe show that improving trade facilitation performance, using the World Trade Organization\u2019s \nTrade  Facilitation  Agreement  as  a  starting  point,  can  be  linked  to  improved  handling  of \nhealth-related products such as vaccines which, in turn, would boost usage. In the last part \nof the paper, we study the price differences for insulin across countries. We observe that the \nprice of insulin has various determinants, one of them being open trade: the higher the level \nof competition between manufacturers, the lower the price of insulin. In summary, lowering \ntrade barriers on health products can make a substantive contribution to building up health \nsystems and lowering out-of-pocket payments of patients. \n \nJEL Classification: F14, I11, I15, I18 \n \n", " \n"]}
