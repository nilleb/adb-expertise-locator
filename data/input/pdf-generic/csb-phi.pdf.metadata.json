Voluntary assistance \nor charity connotes for Filipinos an equal status between the \nprovider of assistance and the recipient, which is embodied \nin the terms damayan (assistance of peers in periods of crisis) \nand pagtutulungan (mutual self-help). The Western notion \nof kawanggawa (charity) may have been introduced to the \nPhilippines by Catholic missionaries.1\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, the Roman Catholic \nChurch and the religious orders established the first welfare \norganizations in the Philippines. They founded parochial schools, \norphanages, and hospitals that were mostly reserved for the \nlocal elite. The church also established foundations and cofrad\u00edas \n(brotherhoods), which encouraged neighborly behavior, such as \nvisiting the sick and helping with town fiesta preparations. \n\nThe American colonial government delineated the boundaries \nbetween state provision of public goods, religious philanthropy, \nand private philanthropy. The Philippine Corporation Law \nof 1906 recognized the right to create private nonprofit \norganizations, and the government subsidized the operation \nof some of these organizations. The American Red Cross and \nthe Anti-Tuberculosis Society set up branches in the country. \nThe American Methodist and Protestant churches as well as the \nChurch of England established schools and hospitals. \n\nWith support from the government, hundreds of farmer credit \ncooperatives were created in the 1920s and 1930s, soon \nclaiming more than 100,000 farmers as members. At the \nsame time, dissatisfaction among peasants fueled growth in \nmembership of the Congress of Labor Organizations, a labor \nfederation linked to the communist movement. The communist \nmovement stimulated a counterreaction from the government, \nreligious organizations, and non-communist organizations. \nThe Catholic Church expanded its social agenda to direct \nengagement with workers and peasants and the Jesuits. \nProtestant and other non-Catholic churches expanded their \nservices into rural development, cooperatives, and credit unions \nor cooperatives, as well as agricultural development. \n\nCountry and Government Context\n\nThe Republic of the Philippines is an archipelago \nof more than 7,000 islands in Southeast Asia. Its \npopulation in 2010 was estimated at 94 million.a\n\nThe country was a Spanish colony from 1521 to \n1898. Following the Philippine Revolution, \nindependence was declared on 12 June 1898 \nand the First Philippine Republic was established. \nIt was then claimed by the United States and, \nafter the Philippine\u2013American War (1899\u20131902), \nbecame an American colony for nearly half \na century. After a brief Japanese Occupation \nduring World War II, the Philippines regained \nindependence on 4 July 1946. The country was \nplaced under martial law from 1972 to 1981 \nand formal political democracy was reestablished \nonly after the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\nThe president serves for a single 6-year term \nand is chief executive, head of state, and \ncommander-in-chief. The country has a \nbicameral legislature\u2014a Senate with 24 members \nelected nationally and a 280-member House \nof Representatives with district and party-list \nrepresentatives. The current president, Benigno \nS. Aquino III, was elected in May 2010.\n\nThere are two official languages, Filipino and \nEnglish, as well as eight other major languages \nand about 80 lesser-spoken languages and \ndialects. The Philippines is a lower-middle-income \ncountryb with \u201cmedium human development\u201d \nranking in 112th (of 187 countries) in the \nworld on the United Nations 2011 Human \nDevelopment Index.\n\nThe adult literacy rate as of 2008 stands at \n98.5% for females and 97.0% for males. The \npoverty incidence as of 2009 is 26.5% of the \npopulation. Life expectancy at birth is 69 years \nfor males and 74 years for females as of 2007.c\n\na  Based on the 2000 Census on Population and Housing by \n\nthe Inter-Agency Working Group on Population Projections.\n\nb  ADB. 2011.

The country\u2019s per capita gross \ndomestic product was $2,007 in 2010.\n\nc  See note b.\n\n\fThen-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law \nin 1972 when there was little space for civil society \nand almost no tolerance for advocacy nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) during his rule. In areas where \nthe government bureaucracy could not deliver necessary \nsocial services, other development stakeholders, \nparticularly NGOs, had to step into that role. However, \nsome organizations either fled underground by joining \nthe armed struggle of the Communist Party of the \nPhilippines, or sought shelter by affiliating with a \nuniversity or religious institutions. During the Marcos \ndictatorship, many civil society organizations (CSOs) \nbuilt up strong relationships with poor communities. \nThe activism of CSOs eventually contributed to the \nPeople Power Revolution of 1986 that ousted Marcos \nand brought Corazon Aquino to power. \n\nThere are many types of CSOs in the country, but the \nmore important types are people\u2019s organizations, \ndevelopment NGOs, and cooperatives. People\u2019s \norganizations are membership organizations \nrepresenting marginalized groups and often organized \nbased on sector, issue, or geographical area. \nDevelopment NGOs act as intermediate agencies and \ninstitutions that typically operate with a full-time staff \ncomplement and provide a wide range of services to \nprimary organizations, communities, and individuals. \nA cooperative is an association of persons who \nhave voluntarily joined together to make \u201cequitable \ncontributions to the capital required, patronizing their \nproducts and services and accepting a fair share of the \nrisks and benefits of the undertaking in accordance with \nuniversally accepted cooperative principles.\u201d4 \n\nPresident Corazon Aquino restored democracy to the \nPhilippines, and several pieces of legislation favorable \nto civil society\u2019s development were passed soon after, \nincluding the Cooperative Code of 1990 and the \nWomen in Development and Nation Building Act of \n1992. Government line agencies opened NGO liaison \noffices, and NGOs were permitted to negotiate directly \nwith bilateral funding institutions for financing. Many \nin the Philippine development community began to \nwelcome CSO management of overseas development \nassistance (ODA) funds, recognizing CSOs as effective \nchannels for funneling support to needy communities.\n\nOwing to the favorable legal environment and the \ninflow of ODA funds to the country, the number \nof CSOs mushroomed during the administration of \nPresident Aquino from 1986 to 1992. The rapid growth \nof CSOs during the period may also be attributed to \nthe government\u2019s move to institutionalize civil society \nparticipation in national and regional development \nplanning. However, in addition to those with good \nintentions, organizations of dubious integrity \nengaged in questionable practices. Some of these \nwere established by politicians, businesspersons, and \nbureaucrats to advance personal, rather than public, \nwelfare. In response, 10 of the largest NGO networks \nformed the Caucus of Development NGO Networks \n(CODE-NGO) in 1991 to promote professionalism \nas well as to expand the reach of CSOs and increase \ntheir effectiveness.2\n\nToday, Philippine civil society organizations are widely \nseen as some of the most vibrant and advanced in the \nworld. The Philippines has the largest number of NGOs \nper capita in Asia, and many believe that if civil society \nhas contributed to democratization anywhere, it is in \nthe Philippines3. Many of the key international NGOs \nand networks are based in the Philippines and headed \nby Filipinos. \n\nIt is difficult to put a definite number to all the CSOs \nin the country, partly because many are unregistered, \nbut also because there is no single official and updated \ndatabase on those that register with government \nagencies. In addition, studies that attempt to count civil \nsociety groups use various definitions and may therefore \ninclude or exclude various types of CSOs. However, \none of the latest and most comprehensive studies puts \nthe range of registered and non-registered CSOs at \n249,000\u2013497,000.5 It was estimated that 40% of these \norganizations were non-registered.\n\nCSOs in the Philippines engage in a broad range of \nactivities, the most common being in (i) education, \ntraining, and human resource development; \n(ii) community development; (iii) enterprise \ndevelopment and employment generation; (iv) health \nand nutrition; (v) law, advocacy, and politics; and \n(vi) sustainable development. It is worth noting that \npolitical activism takes on a larger role for Filipino CSOs \nthan elsewhere. Indeed, CSOs played major roles in \nachieving Filipino independence from the Spanish and \nthe Americans, in toppling the Marcos regime, and in \nending the administration of President Joseph Estrada.\n\nGovernment\u2013Civil Society Relations\n\nSince the 1986 People Power Revolution, the government \nhas always maintained some openness to civil society. \nHowever, the democratic space for CSOs has been \nexpanded or constricted through the years depending \non the inclinations of those in power (both elected \nand appointed leaders and bureaucrats), the general \npolitical conditions, and the positioning of CSOs with the \nincumbent political leaders, among other factors. \n\nPresident Fidel V. Ramos, who served from 1992 to \n1998, won the presidency by a slim margin and \n\n\fthereafter sought to expand his base of support among \nvarious sectors of society, including CSOs. He advanced \nthe Social Reform Agenda to engage CSOs in national \npolicy development processes. \n\nA section of the CSO sector campaigned for Joseph \nEstrada in 1998, and some of the leaders were \nappointed to Cabinet positions. However, many other \nCSOs soon became disenchanted with President Estrada \nover various issues, including cronyism, corruption, \ninept governance, poor economic performance, and \nlimitations on press freedom. \n\ncitizen assessment of local governments\u2019 performance; \nand the Electronic Watch, which creates a mechanism \nfor citizens to provide feedback on the performance \nof their local government units (LGUs) through the \ninternet. The Government of the Philippines has \npartnered with various CSOs for its Full Disclosure \nPolicy, Seal of Good Housekeeping for LGUs, and other \nprograms aimed at promoting good governance. \nCSOs are also monitoring the government\u2019s road and \nother infrastructure projects, and closely watching and \nparticipating in the implementation of the Conditional \nCash Transfer (CCT) Program. \n\nThis pattern repeated itself with President Gloria \nMacapagal-Arroyo who came to power in 2001 \nwith strong civil society backing. Government\u2013CSO \nrelations, however, soured after she was accused in \n2005 of electoral fraud in her victory in the May 2004 \npresidential election. Her declaration of a state of \nemergency in February 2006 amid strong opposition \nto her administration raised concerns about a threat to \ncivil liberties. \n\nBenigno Simeon C. Aquino was elected president \nin May 2010 with strong support from CSOs and \nvolunteer groups who were mobilized through the \nanticorruption and antipoverty focus of his campaign \nplatform and the legacy of his parents, the martyred \nNinoy Aquino, and former President Corazon Aquino. \nThe assumption to office of President Aquino marked \nimprovements in the openness of the government to \nCSOs based on constructive engagement \u2014both as \nwatchdogs to help ensure that government policies \nand guidelines are followed and as support groups \nhelping to implement government projects and deliver \npublic services. \n\nDuring this period, CSOs have clamored for increased \naccountability and transparency in government.6 For its \npart, the Aquino Administration promoted governance \nand anticorruption as the core priorities of its \ndevelopment agenda and introduced reform measures \nwhich included the creation of a Cabinet Cluster on \nGood Governance and Anti-Corruption chaired by the \npresident himself. Under the president\u2019s leadership, the \ncountry also became a founding member of the Open \nGovernment Partnership, a global multilateral initiative \nthat aims to secure more transparent, effective, and \naccountable governments.\n\nIn 2011, President Aquino approved the Good \nGovernance and Anti-Corruption Plan 2012\u20132016 that \nincludes a program to help strengthen the Department \nof the Interior and Local Government\u2019s partnership \nwith CSOs. Projects under the cluster plan include the \nCitizen Satisfaction Index System, which institutionalizes \n\nThe government continues to open its doors to CSO \nparticipation not only in national and local planning \nprocesses, but now also in budget preparation and \nexecution and in audit. The Department of Budget \nand Management (DBM) issued National Budget \nMemorandum No. 109 in 2011 to require six national \ngovernment agencies and three government-owned \nand controlled corporations to partner with CSOs in \nundertaking a participatory process for the formulation \nof the national budget for 2012. \n\nThe following year, National Budget Memorandum \nNo. 112 implemented the bottom\u2013up approach in \nbudgeting and further expanded CSO engagement in \nbudget preparation for 2013. The DBM also created \na CSO Desk that will monitor CSO participation in \nbudget preparations. \n\nThe government also promotes a system of public \nprocurement that standardizes procedures and \nincreases transparency. The current procurement \nsystem allows civil society to attend meetings of bids \nand awards committees and to be given access to \nrelevant documents.\n\nThe Legal Framework for Civil Society\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, forged \nand shaped in the aftermath of the 1986 People \nPower Revolution, clearly recognizes participation \nand empowerment, including the important role of \nCSOs. This may be seen in several provisions of the \nConstitution, most prominently in the following:\n\n \u0084 Article II, Section 23: \u201cThe State shall encourage \nnon-governmental, community-based, or sector \norganizations that promote the welfare of \nthe nation.\u201d\n\n \u0084 Article XIII, Section 15: \u201cThe State shall respect \n\nthe role of independent people\u2019s organizations to \nenable the people to pursue and protect, within \nthe democratic framework, their legitimate and \n\n\fcollective interests and aspirations through peaceful \nand lawful means. [\u2026]\u201d\n\n \u0084 Article XIII, Section 16: \u201cThe right of the people \n\nand their organizations to effective and reasonable \nparticipation at all levels of social, political and \neconomic decision-making shall not be abridged. \nThe State shall, by law, facilitate the establishment \nof adequate consultation mechanisms.\u201d\n\nlegal status that permits them to enter into contracts \nand open a bank account. There are four government \nagencies that provide primary registration, which gives \na legal or juridical personality to a CSO: the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (SEC), the Cooperative \nDevelopment Authority (CDA), the Department of Labor \nand Employment (DOLE), and the Housing and Land \nUse Regulatory Board (HLURB). \n\nMany laws also recognize and promote CSOs and their \nrole in the development of the country. Among the \nmost important is the Local Government Code (LGC) of \n1991. The LGC devolves authority, assets, and personnel \nof various national government agencies to LGUs to \nprovide primary responsibility for basic services and \nfacilities. It further provides for the participation of \nCSOs in local government planning and policy making \nand in the delivery of social services. The code mandates \nthe formation of local development councils, which \nplay a role in local planning, and it also provides for the \nformation of other local special bodies, including the \nlocal health and school boards, all of which must also \nhave CSO members. In addition, several administrative \norders of the central government, implementing the \nconstitutional provisions and the LGC regarding public \nparticipation, require that all local councils in all levels \nshould be represented by various NGOs and people\u2019s \norganizations such as farmers\u2019 cooperatives and \nfishers\u2019 associations.\n\nAnother important law for CSOs is the Social Reform \nand Poverty Alleviation Act of 1997, which created \nthe National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC), \na coordination and oversight body headed by the \npresident of the country to ensure that social reform \naddresses the basic inequities in Philippine society. It \nis composed of the heads of 14 major government \ndepartments, the presidents of local government \nleagues, and 14 basic sector representatives. \nThe 14 sector representatives are elected by and \naccountable to assemblies of sector CSOs and their \nelected sector council.\n\nSelf-regulation has long been seen by many as a \nnecessary ingredient to promoting accountability \nand good governance among CSOs. Philippine CSOs \nhave been at the cutting edge of CSO self-regulation. \nCODE-NGO, the largest coalition of development \nCSOs in the country, established the Code of Conduct \nfor Development NGOs in 1991. It was the first CSO \ncoalition to adopt a code of conduct in Asia, and \nprobably one of the first in the world.\n\nIt is not legally mandatory for CSOs in the Philippines \nto register with the government, and many people\u2019s \norganizations and other small organizations do not \ndo so. However, only registered organizations gain a \n\nMany types of CSOs register with the SEC, including \ndevelopment NGOs, people\u2019s organizations, farmers\u2019 \nassociations, athletic and sports associations, social \nwelfare organizations, and civic clubs. On the other \nhand, the CDA registers various types of cooperatives \nthat may include savings and credit cooperatives, \nconsumer cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, \nand multipurpose cooperatives. The DOLE registers \nlabor unions, labor federations, and rural workers\u2019 \nassociations in accordance with the Labor Code of \nthe Philippines. The HLURB registers homeowners\u2019 \nassociations (HOAs) based on the Magna Carta for \nHomeowners and Homeowners\u2019 Associations. At least \nfive incorporators may organize and register a HOA.\n\nIn addition to their primary registration with these \nagencies, CSOs wishing to take on particular activities \nneed secondary registration or licenses or permits from \nother government agencies. For example, CSOs that \nwould like to perform social work or social welfare \nroles, such as operating orphanages or children\u2019s \ninstitutions, or nonprofit health institutions, need to \nobtain licenses from the Department of Social Welfare \nand Development and the Department of Health, \nrespectively, while nonprofit educational institutions \nmust have permits to operate from the Department of \nEducation, the Commission on Higher Education, or the \nTechnical Education and Skills Development Authority.\n\nRegistered CSOs are required to submit annual \nreports, including audited financial statements, to \ntheir registration agency. However, in general, these \nagencies are not able to effectively monitor the \nnumerous organizations registered with them.7 Due to \nthe lack of resources, they can only investigate CSOs \nwhen complaints are filed against these organizations \nor when they are involved in irregularities frequently \nreported by the media. Certain tax incentives have long \nbeen given to various types of CSOs in recognition of \ntheir nonprofit nature and their contribution to the \ngeneral welfare and to national development. They are \nexempted from income tax on revenues from donations, \ngrants, gifts, and other sources, provided that their net \nincome does not benefit any private individual. \n\nIn 1998, six of the largest NGO coalitions in the country \nestablished the Philippine Council for NGO Certification \n(PCNC). Through a memorandum of agreement, the \n\n\fGovernment of the Philippines has given PCNC the \nauthority to certify NGOs based on specific standards. \nThe PCNC certification process was envisaged to \nencourage local donations to NGOs, which were \nconsidered highly significant, especially at a time when \nresources channeled to social development projects, \nparticularly from foreign donors, were diminishing. \nFrom 1998 to March 2010, PCNC received 1,311 \napplications for certification and certified 1,071 CSOs.8\n\nBagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan)\nBayan was created in 1985 by more than 1,000 mass \norganizations. It fights for national and social liberation \nagainst imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat \ncapitalism. Bayan fights for the nationalistic and \ndemocratic needs of the people through legal and \nmilitant forms of struggle, and, though it does not \nparticipate in armed struggle, Bayan respects the right \nof others to take such an option.\n\nUmbrella and Coordinating Bodies\n\nThere are many umbrella groups of CSOs in the country, \nmost of which are organized according to sector, \nsuch as federations or alliances of organizations of \nworkers or trade unions, farmers, fishers, urban poor, \nwomen, indigenous peoples, and youths. Umbrella \ngroups may also be formed based on geographical \narea (provincial/city or regional alliances) or on issues \nand causes.9\n\nThe more established national networks and coalitions \nof CSOs include the following:\n\nAssociation of Foundations (AF)\nAF was created in 1972 as a network of foundations \nand NGOs.

It is \ncomposed of national networks of NGOs and people\u2019s \n\nThe large number of NGOs has given rise to concerns \nabout the ability of the government to regulate all these \norganizations and to ensure that resources channeled \nto them are actually being used for their declared \n\n\fgoals and objectives. CODE-NGO\u2019s Code of Conduct \nfor Development NGOs is a manifestation of the CSO \ncommunity\u2019s commitment to promote professionalism \nand accountability in its operations. The Code of \nConduct has since been signed by over 1,000 NGOs and \nwas recently updated to provide for clearer enforcement \nmechanisms.10 It further calls on the Philippine \ndevelopment NGO community to adopt the principles, \ngoals, and provisions embodied in the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe PCNC\u2019s certification process is one of the very few \ngovernment-recognized NGO certification systems \nin the world and has been the subject of discussion \nand possible replication by NGOs in different \ncountries. It ensures professionalism, accountability, \nand transparency within the NGO and nonprofit \nsector in the Philippines by providing a Seal of \nGood Housekeeping, which will hopefully also help \nidentify NGOs of good standing for funding agencies \nand partners.\n\nCivil Society Capacity\n\nThe strength of Philippine CSOs lies in their number, \nthe extensive networking with the sector and with \nother sectors or society, the experience and skills from \nmany years of development work, the dedication \nand creativity of CSO leaders and workers, and the \nflexibility that is linked to the small size of most CSOs. \nA survey conducted for the Civil Society Index11 (CSI) \nin the Philippines found that 46% of the population \nconsidered themselves as active members of at least one \nCSO, 37% were inactive members, and only 17% said \nthat they do not belong to any CSO.12 Complementing \nthis, most CSOs, especially NGOs, sector organizations, \nand cooperatives, are linked together through \nprovincial, regional, and national networks or \nfederations or coalitions.13 This may also pose difficulties \nin selecting the appropriate CSOs with which to engage \nand could hinder having a unified constructive voice \nfrom civil society. \n\nAside from their number, CSOs in the country have the \nskills, coalition/network building capacity, and links with \nallies in government that are needed to put forward \nand successfully advocate social reform laws and \npolicies, including the Anti-Violence against Women \nand Children Act, the more recent Comprehensive \nAgrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms Act, \nthe Urban Development and Housing Act, and the \nIndigenous Peoples Rights Act, to name a few.\n\nCSOs have also proven themselves to be excellent \nalternative providers of services to the poor, particularly \nto those underserved by the government. They are \n\nknown to be flexible, adaptable, and capable of \ninnovative approaches to development challenges. \nFurther, CSOs typically incur lower costs under fewer \nbureaucratic project implementation processes than \nthe government.\n\nPhilippine civil society has also been able to tap \ncorporate resources to support poverty alleviation \ninitiatives. Philippine Business for Social Progress \n(PBSP) is the largest corporate-led social development \nfoundation in the Philippines. Committed to poverty \nreduction, PBSP is the first of its kind in Asia being \nthe only nonprofit consortium of corporations leading \nthe advocacy on and the practice of corporate social \nresponsibility. It has grown its membership base to \nover 230 small, medium-sized, and large corporations, \nraising P1.7 billion ($41 million) annually from member \ncontributions that go to implementing, monitoring, and \nevaluating development projects nationwide.\n\nAs a result of the experience and expertise of Philippine \nCSOs many of their capable staff become trainers and \nmentors for others within the country, regionally, and \nglobally. Foreign NGOs and governments often send \nstaff to the Philippines to learn about civil society and \nthe relationship between the government and CSOs.\n\nHowever, it has been noted that many CSOs, particularly \nNGOs, are dependent on external funding and are \naffected by lack of staff for the successor generation \nand weak internal governance. Philippine CSOs secure \ntheir funding through membership dues, donations, \nsubsidies, and revenue from income-generating \nactivities. The CSI organizational survey showed that \ntraders and business associations, trade and labor \nunions, and homeowners\u2019 associations rely mainly \non membership fees and service fees and sales  \n(89%\u2013100%) for their revenues. On the other hand, \nNGOs obtain 70% of their revenues from foreign \ndonors, corporate donors, and the government. \nIndividual donations and membership fees account for \n85% of the revenues of religious and spiritual groups. \nDependence on external funding is critical in view of \nthe decline of external or donor support for the country \nsince the 1990s.14\n\nWhile it is true that many CSOs operate on the basis of \nvolunteerism, the more stable and capable CSOs rely \non paid full-time staff to deliver their programs and \nservices. The ability of many CSOs to keep their staff \nhas been affected by the lack of funds. Many local \nCSOs have also lost many of their high-performing \nstaff to better paying and more stable institutions, \nincluding the government and the business sector, but \nalso to corporate foundations, international NGOs, and \ndonor agencies. At the same time, CSOs, particularly \n\n\fNGOs, have recently not been able to attract as many \nyoung graduates and talented youths into their field \nas they used to. These developments may slow down \ncivil society\u2019s sustained constructive engagement with \nthe government.\n\nThe increasing number of thriving CSOs is a sign of \nwillingness of the public to engage in development, \nbut their capacity in constructively doing so needs to \nbe developed. Many CSOs may have been missing \nopportunities currently offered by the government \ndue to their lack of technical knowledge about how \ngovernment works. CSOs need to be trained in \nparticipatory audit, for example, or in understanding \npublished government financial reports. This is \nparticularly true for large development projects, in \nwhich only very few CSOs with strong track records \nare able to participate. CSOs also recognize the need \nto strengthen their internal governance, starting with \na more involved and active Board of Trustees. There \nhave been some reported cases of mismanagement of \nCSO funds. A survey of 120 CSOs conducted for the \nCSI showed that 36% perceive that corruption happens \nfrequently (24%) or very frequently (12%) within \ncivil society.\n\nADB\u2013Civil Society Cooperation in \nthe Philippines\n\nThe Philippines is not only a founding member of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and its 11th largest \nshareholder,15 it is also ADB\u2019s host country. In the \nPhilippines, ADB\u2019s development partnership includes a \nwide range of stakeholders representing government, \ncivil society, donor institutions, the business community, \nand research and academic institutions.\n\nTo increase relevance, ADB is intensifying or creating \npartnerships outside the national government, with \ngovernment-owned and -controlled corporations, LGUs, \nthe Supreme Court and other pillars of justice, business \ngroups, and civil society. For instance, ADB takes the \npreparation of its country partnership strategy for the \nPhilippines as an opportunity for establishing linkages \nwith CSOs and collaborating with other development \npartners. ADB also engages in other knowledge \nmanagement activities in pursuit of this goal. \n\nADB has engaged with various CSOs in the Philippines \nfor many years, partly because its headquarters is in \nthe country. ADB has committed to strengthening \npartnerships in the implementation of its country \npartnership strategy in the Philippines through, among \nothers, stakeholder consultations and the establishment \n\nof an advisory board of eminent people, including \nacademics and CSO representatives. Also, as part of \nits focus on strengthening governance and reducing \ncorruption, ADB continues to support constructive \nengagement between CSOs and the national and \nlocal governments. \n\nADB Country Partnership Strategy \n2011\u20132016\n\nIn consultation with the government and other \nrelevant stakeholders including CSOs, ADB formulated \nthe Country Partnership Strategy for the Philippines. \nIt defines ADB\u2019s strategic approach in the Philippines \nfor 2011\u20132016 aligned with ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework Strategy 2020, the country\u2019s own \ndevelopment strategy, ADB\u2019s comparative strengths, \nand complementary efforts by its development partners.\n\nConsultations during its preparation provided \nopportunities for CSOs to contribute to ADB\u2019s \nmedium-term strategic approach in the Philippines. \nIn 2011, ADB\u2019s Philippines Country Office organized \nCSO consultation meetings in Manila for separate \ndiscussions on the following key issues: governance, the \nsocial sector, and infrastructure and the environment. \nAnother round of consultations was organized in \nother parts of the country where key CSOs, as well as \nrepresentatives from business groups and academia, \nparticipated in the discussions. CSO participation in the \ncountry partnership strategy formulation demonstrated \na bottom\u2013up participatory process with a wide range \nof stakeholders in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The \nprocess also helped shape the strategic focus of ADB\u2019s \ncountry program on governance, the social sector, \nthe environment, climate change, and disaster risk \nmanagement, in particular. Consultations with CSOs \nalso contributed to a better understanding of country \npriorities and critical development constraints at the \nnational and the local level.\n\nADB-Supported Activities Involving \nCivil Society\n\nCivil society has become a much more influential actor \nin development, demanding greater accountability \nand transparency as well as engagement on key \nissues, such as human rights, good governance, \nand climate change at the national, regional, and \nglobal levels. The strength and capacity of CSOs in \nthe Philippines open up more opportunities for ADB \nto engage with them more effectively, not only in \n\n\fprojects but also in policy dialogue and development. \nHistorically, CSOs in the Philippines have participated \nin ADB policy reviews, such as for the Safeguard Policy \nStatement, the Public Communications Policy, and the \nAccountability Mechanism. \n\nAt the project level, ADB directly supports the social \nprotection reform agenda of the Government of the \nPhilippines, including the implementation of its CCT \nProgram. Through CCT, cash grants are extended to \neligible poor families for as long as they meet certain \nagreed conditions that include keeping children in \nschool and bringing them to health centers for basic \nhealth care. \n\nThe CCT Program promotes various roles of CSOs that \ninclude implementation of the subcomponents of the \nproject, monitoring, and support for the grievance \nredress system, among others. The loan component \nincludes financing of biannual spot checks by a CSO \nof CCT implementation and system performance. In \nparticular, ADB supports the government and partner \nagencies to hold policy dialogues among multiple \nstakeholders, including CSOs, to build consensus \naround an action plan of priority reforms and to \nenhance the capacity of people in national and \nlocal institutions to implement the CCT Program. \nCSO consultations organized in Luzon, Visayas, \nand Mindanao culminated in a consensus statement \ndemonstrating civil society support. \n\nADB cooperates with Sa Aklat Sisikat Foundation (SAS) \nunder the Computer Access Mentorship Program \nproject to help improve the skills of public school \nteachers. SAS is an NGO that bridges the education \ngap in the Philippines by advocating functional literacy \nand progressive teacher and administrator training. \nSince 1999, SAS has been upgrading the skills of public \nelementary schoolteachers in teaching reading. It has \ndeveloped a culturally sensitive curriculum and a pool \nof high-quality trainers. The SAS program on face-to-\nface training of teachers will be expanded into an online \ntraining model. \n\nTogether with the Partnership for Transparency Fund \n(PTF), ADB provided technical assistance to strengthen \ncivil society\u2019s role in the fight against corruption. \nTwo projects in the Philippines addressed corruption \nissues in city administration and the education sector. \nThe projects highlighted the key roles that CSOs play in \nbuilding public awareness of anticorruption approaches. \nThe NGO Ecolink used popular mass media formats, \nsuch as radio, mobile telephony, poster making, law \nadvocacy, and catalyzing of citizen\u2019s coalitions and \nstudent \u201cgraftwatchers,\u201d to heighten awareness \namong communities in Southern Philippines about \n\nthe misuse of government vehicles. The Ateneo School \nof Government\u2019s Textbook Walk project organized \nvolunteers to keep track of public procurement and \ndelivery of school textbooks. ADB support enabled the \nproject to ensure that government-purchased textbooks \nreach their intended destination.\n\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction\n\nThe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) was \nestablished in May 2000 to provide grants for poverty \nreduction initiatives with the direct participation of \ncommunity groups, NGOs, and other CSOs. It is a tool \nfor local communities and CSOs to actively participate \nin the development process. Since its founding until \nDecember 2010, the Government of Japan has \nprovided $446 million for the fund.16 The JFPR is \nwidely recognized as one of the primary grant facilities \navailable to NGOs. They are routinely involved in the \ndifferent stages of the project cycle and play many \nroles, including as executing and/or implementing \nagency; as a resource NGO providing information, \ncommunity organization, or other specialized services; \nor even as consultants to ADB in the course of the \nproject\u2019s supervision.\n\nSince its start, the JFPR has supported 130 projects \nacross Asia and the Pacific, including 9 in  \nthe Philippines.17\n\nCommunity groups or other CSO may collaborate in \nconceptualizing and designing the proposed grant \nwith the ADB project officer managing an existing and \nrelated ADB-financed project. However, only ADB staff \ncan officially submit JFPR applications. Civil society \ngroups are advised to establish contact with the country \nteams directly or through the NGO anchors and civil \nsociety specialists in ADB resident missions.\n\nThrough JFPR, ADB is working to raise the income \nlevels of the poor coastal communities in Berau (East \nKalimantan), Indonesia and in Balabac (Palawan), \nPhilippines by pilot-testing support mechanisms for \nsustainable livelihoods. The initiative aims to develop \nmodel alternative livelihoods that will involve women \nand indigenous people in the development process. \n\nDeveloping Sustainable Alternative Livelihoods in \nCoastal Fishing Communities in the Coral Triangle: \nIndonesia and Philippines, a $2 million project \napproved in 2011, was designed in consultation \nwith NGOs including The Nature Conservancy and \nthe World Wide Fund for Nature. ADB will engage \nthe services of local NGOs to help undertake social \npreparation, mobilization, and empowerment of the \n\n\flocal communities for microenterprise or livelihood \ndevelopment for revenue generation. \n\nurban poverty reduction program that includes a risk \nreduction and management component. \n\nADB also helped increase and diversify the income-\ngenerating opportunities for the poor in Southern \nPhilippines, leading to decreased poverty incidence \nin the project areas. The project Supporting the \nSustainable Livelihood for the Poor in the Southern \nPhilippines formed livelihood activities in about \n250 barangays (the smallest political unit in the \nPhilippines) in Mindanao, Eastern Visayas, Bicol, and \nthe MIMAROPA Region. The project was carried out \nin partnership with two regional NGO networks\u2014\nMindanao Coalition of Development NGO Networks \nand the Philippine Partnership for the Development \nof Human Resources in Rural Areas in the Visayas. \nProposals for development activities were prepared at \nthe village and municipal levels by selected people\u2019s \norganizations and NGOs through participatory \nprocesses that involved beneficiaries.\n\nIn Negros Occidental, ADB piloted an innovative \ncommunity-based approach for the provision of \nelectricity through renewable energy sources, \nparticularly in off-grid areas of the province. The \nproject has set up and operates eight renewable \nenergy systems in off-grid areas and is establishing \ntwo sustainable revolving fund mechanisms\u2014one for \nelectricity connection to poor households and one for \nlivelihood development. It promotes the development \nof renewable energy resources and the management \nof these resources by the direct beneficiaries\u2014poor \ncommunities who gain greater livelihood opportunities \nthrough access to modern power supply.\n\nThrough the Renewable Energy and Livelihood \nDevelopment for the Poor in Negros Occidental project, \nADB cooperated with Winrock, an international \nNGO that works together with LGUs and local CSOs, \nincluding the Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, \nAlternative Indigenous Development Foundation, and \nSustainable Rural Enterprise.\n\nOne of the successful projects supported by the JFPR \nis the Strategic Private Sector Partnerships for Urban \nPoverty Reduction in Metro Manila implemented by the \nPBSP from 2002 to 2006. The project targeted 23 poor \ncommunities in various Metro Manila cities. It aimed to \n(i) promote demonstrable strategic business sector \ninvolvement in integrated urban poverty reduction \nprograms through a focused, strategic framework; \n(ii) create a strong multisector coalition capable of \nadvocating urban poverty programs and policies in \na sustainable manner; (iii) improve living conditions \nof 5,823 households, comprising an estimated \n35,000 individuals; and (iv) undertake an integrated \n\nThe PBSP actually worked with 34 HOAs, surpassing \nthe target of 23. More than 2,000 households \nwere provided loans for housing construction \nand improvement, and legalization of electrical \nconnections. The time spent by corporate employees \nwho volunteered in the communities was valued \nat $460,000, and all the HOAs benefited from \ninfrastructure projects, including multipurpose centers, \nroads, alleys, and drainage. \n\nCSO Concerns about ADB Initiatives\n\nADB recognizes CSOs as development partners and \nstrives to address issues and concerns raised by CSOs on \nADB operations. The following are some of the projects \nin which CSOs have raised concerns:\n\n \u0084\n\n \u0084\n\nProject sustainability and dependence on fossil fuels \nunder the Philippine Energy Efficiency Project\nEnvironmental and health impacts under the Visayas \nBase Load Power Development Project\n\n \u0084 Need for adequate public consultation in supporting \nthe e-Trikes (electric tricycles) project under the \nMitigation of Climate Change through Increased \nEnergy Efficiency and the Use of Clean Energy\n\nADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism,18 provides a \nforum in which people negatively affected by ADB-\nassisted projects can voice their concerns and report \nalleged noncompliance of ADB\u2019s operational policies \nand procedures.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 \n\nThis and the next paragraphs describing the history of \nCSOs in the country are based mainly on ADB. 2007.

It is distinct from the government and the private sector and consists of a diverse range of individuals, \ngroups, and nonprofit organizations. They operate around shared interests, purposes, and values with a varying degree \nof formality and encompass a diverse range\u2014from informal unorganized community groups to large international \nlabor union organizations. Of particular relevance to ADB are nongovernment organizations, community-based \norganizations and people\u2019s organizations, foundations, professional associations, research institutes and universities, \nlabor unions, mass organizations, social movements, and coalitions and networks of civil society organizations (CSOs) and \numbrella organizations.a \n\nADB recognizes CSOs as development actors in their own right whose efforts complement those of governments and \nthe private sector, and who play a significant role in development in Asia and the Pacific. ADB has a long tradition of \ninteracting with CSOs in different contexts, through policy- and country strategy-level consultation, and in designing, \nimplementing, and monitoring projects.\n\nIn 2008, ADB launched Strategy 2020, which articulates the organization\u2019s future direction and vision until 2020.b Above \nall, Strategy 2020 presents three complementary strategic agendas to guide ADB operations: inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. These agendas reflect the recognition that it is not only the \npace of growth but also the pattern of growth matters in reducing poverty in the region. In this new strategic context, \npartnerships with a range of organizations, including CSOs, will become central to planning, financing, implementing, and \nevaluating ADB projects.\n\na  ADB. 2012.

In areas where \nthe government bureaucracy could not deliver necessary \nsocial services, other development stakeholders, \nparticularly NGOs, had to step into that role. However, \nsome organizations either fled underground by joining \nthe armed struggle of the Communist Party of the \nPhilippines, or sought shelter by affiliating with a \nuniversity or religious institutions. During the Marcos \ndictatorship, many civil society organizations (CSOs) \nbuilt up strong relationships with poor communities. \nThe activism of CSOs eventually contributed to the \nPeople Power Revolution of 1986 that ousted Marcos \nand brought Corazon Aquino to power. \n", "There are many types of CSOs in the country, but the \nmore important types are people\u2019s organizations, \ndevelopment NGOs, and cooperatives. People\u2019s \norganizations are membership organizations \nrepresenting marginalized groups and often organized \nbased on sector, issue, or geographical area. \nDevelopment NGOs act as intermediate agencies and \ninstitutions that typically operate with a full-time staff \ncomplement and provide a wide range of services to \nprimary organizations, communities, and individuals. \nA cooperative is an association of persons who \nhave voluntarily joined together to make \u201cequitable \ncontributions to the capital required, patronizing their \nproducts and services and accepting a fair share of the \nrisks and benefits of the undertaking in accordance with \nuniversally accepted cooperative principles.\u201d4 \n", "President Corazon Aquino restored democracy to the \nPhilippines, and several pieces of legislation favorable \nto civil society\u2019s development were passed soon after, \nincluding the Cooperative Code of 1990 and the \nWomen in Development and Nation Building Act of \n1992. Government line agencies opened NGO liaison \noffices, and NGOs were permitted to negotiate directly \nwith bilateral funding institutions for financing. Many \nin the Philippine development community began to \nwelcome CSO management of overseas development \nassistance (ODA) funds, recognizing CSOs as effective \nchannels for funneling support to needy communities.\n", "Owing to the favorable legal environment and the \ninflow of ODA funds to the country, the number \nof CSOs mushroomed during the administration of \nPresident Aquino from 1986 to 1992. The rapid growth \nof CSOs during the period may also be attributed to \nthe government\u2019s move to institutionalize civil society \nparticipation in national and regional development \nplanning. However, in addition to those with good \nintentions, organizations of dubious integrity \nengaged in questionable practices. Some of these \nwere established by politicians, businesspersons, and \nbureaucrats to advance personal, rather than public, \nwelfare. In response, 10 of the largest NGO networks \nformed the Caucus of Development NGO Networks \n(CODE-NGO) in 1991 to promote professionalism \nas well as to expand the reach of CSOs and increase \ntheir effectiveness.2\n", "Today, Philippine civil society organizations are widely \nseen as some of the most vibrant and advanced in the \nworld. The Philippines has the largest number of NGOs \nper capita in Asia, and many believe that if civil society \nhas contributed to democratization anywhere, it is in \nthe Philippines3. Many of the key international NGOs \nand networks are based in the Philippines and headed \nby Filipinos. \n", "It is difficult to put a definite number to all the CSOs \nin the country, partly because many are unregistered, \nbut also because there is no single official and updated \ndatabase on those that register with government \nagencies. In addition, studies that attempt to count civil \nsociety groups use various definitions and may therefore \ninclude or exclude various types of CSOs.
