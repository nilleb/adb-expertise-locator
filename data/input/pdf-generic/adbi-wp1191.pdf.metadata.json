INTRODUCTION \nTo enable a proposed urban development, including its attendant infrastructure and \nfeeder transportation, one needs to possess at least the user rights over the land on \nwhich the development is supposed to take place. That urban development can be a \nbrownfield or greenfield development, and it may consist of, for instance, infrastructure, \nresidential,  commercial,  industrial,  redevelopment  or  mixed-use  development. \nDepending on the scale of the development and the present ownership structure, the \npromoter-sponsor-developer (be it public, private, or some combination) must acquire \none or more plots in a process that is called land assembly. After land assembly, \nfurther steps must be taken to make the location suitable for development. We refer to \nthat whole process as part of the administration function of land management.  \nLand management is a much broader term which, according to the United Nations \nEconomic Commission for Europe (1996) comprises the process by which natural and \nbuilt  resources  of  land  are  put  into  good  effect.  Enemark  (2005)  defines  a  land \nmanagement paradigm which includes land policies, land administration functions, and \na land information system. Land administration functions, which are the operational \npart of land management, ensure proper management of land tenure, land value, land \nuse, and its planning and development. The administration functions of land operate \nwithin the land policies and are facilitated by the information system (Enemark 2005). \nLand development is the strategic part of land administration that constitutes a series of \nsteps that are taken to achieve long-term goals. For the rest of the discussion, we refer \nto the strategic part of land administration as the land management strategy.  \nA  land  management  strategy  for  urban  development  usually  encompasses  the \nassembly  of  land  (through  securing  and  transferring  land  rights),  financing  of  the \ninvestment in buying or leasing land, reparcelling of that land into a new grid to make it \nsuitable for the proposed development, the provision of infrastructure and other public \nfacilities, distribution of building plots to end-users and/or investors (that want to buy \nthe land to build on), and the management and ownership of (part of) that land after the \nconstruction of the building(s) (Figure 1).  \nFigure 1: Land Management Strategy for Urban Development \n \nSource: Authors. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nAlthough (public) land management strategies are often part of a more comprehensive \nplanning process and the (private) development of land also often makes up part of \nintegrated land and real estate development projects, it is still useful to consider the \nland management strategy separately from the broader planning process and real \nestate development. There are at least four good reasons to do so.  \nFirst, land markets must be considered as markets with their own characteristics and \nprice mechanism (as separate from the real estate market, which requires land as an \ninput for property development, while there are other uses of land that do not require \nbuilding on it, such as agriculture or mining or parks). A land management strategy \nshould enable public and private stakeholders to act in the market in an efficient way. \nSecond, but closely related to the first argument\u2014public (and private) stakeholders in \nmost countries have developed policies and tools aimed at the land market. A land \nmanagement strategy can be regarded as the operationalization of a land policy and \nshould provide the framework for the use of land policy rules and guidelines. Third, the \nassembly of land that rezones or reassigns property rights interferes with existing \nindividual property rights over land and raises many legal debates over, for instance, \nexpropriation, the protection of individual property rights, and compensation that must \nbe paid for the compulsory acquisition of land. Fourth, since David Ricardo introduced \nhis theory on land rent (Ricardo 1817) and Henry George published his famous work \nProgress  and  Poverty,  in  which  he  argued  in  favor  of  the  nationalization  of  land \n(George 1881), political debates have questioned the so-called unearned increment  \nin  land  values  due  to  government  interventions.  Land  policy  in  most  countries  is \ninfluenced by that debate and is often used as an instrument to cream off part of that \nunearned increment.  \nThis  paper  does  not  aim  to  go  into  the  details  of  these  different  debates  and \narguments, but has a more modest and pragmatic objective, namely to provide an \ninternational, state-of-the-art overview of land management strategies used by local \ngovernments (and private stakeholders) in countries around the world aiming for an \nefficient and fair urban development process. Though we do refer to literature that \ncritically reviews the working of these models, we do not have the intention to evaluate \n(the outcomes of) the models in terms of, for instance, effectiveness, efficiency, and/or \nsocial equity. This paper in particular wants to present the characteristics of each of \nthese models and distinguish them from each other. This also implies that the paper is \nconcerned only with the land management strategies that are used for infrastructure, \npublic  spaces,  and  urban  development  projects,  and  a  complete  study  of  land \nmanagement is out of the scope.1 \n2.  OVERVIEW OF LAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES \nThe overview of land management strategies in this paper is mainly based on a \nliterature review, discussions in the ADBI seminar on land management in Asia (Tokyo, \nDecember 2018), and the authors\u2019 personal expertise. Land management strategies \nhave not been conceptualized concisely in literature and the scope differs between \ncountries and disciplines (Louw 2008). Some studies use the term \u2018land assembly\u2019 to \nindicate the entire process of making land available for urban development. Golland \n(2003), for instance, defines land assembly as the acquisition of land; land preparation; \nplanning of the built form, streets, open spaces, and main services; sub-division of land \n \n1  Land management for urban and periurban development obviously affects rural land markets as well, \nwhen former rural land is turned into urban. However, the paper\u2019s focus is on the strategies and \ninstruments to make land available for urban development (buildings, infrastructure, green space). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nfor buildings; and delivery of the planned form. According to Louw (2008, p. 70) a \ncrucial aspect of land assembly encompasses changes in land ownership by acquiring \nrequired land parcels to facilitate property development and infrastructure provisions. \nTherefore land assembly is considered as a specific stage in the property development \nprocess. In line with van der Krabben and Jacobs (2013), we prefer to speak of land \nmanagement strategies.  \nAccording to van der Krabben and Jacobs (2013, p. 775), land management strategies \nhave three objectives. Firstly, land must be made available for a proposed and desired \n(or  mandated  by  government)  development.  Changes  in  the  social  and economic \nconditions  over  time  necessitate  urban  redevelopment,  as  the  landownership  that \ncurrently exists is a response to past requirements (Louw 2008, p. 70). Landowners \nthemselves may not undertake redevelopment or co-operate with it due to various \nconstraints that they face or a preference for the status quo. Such situations require a \nform of land assembly\u2014land transfers from passive to active ownership. Second, a \nland management strategy requires that the costs of the public works are fully or \npartially recovered. This could be achieved through a positive balance between the \nvalue increment from new development and the costs incurred in development. A third \nmain objective, though politically contentious (Alterman 2009), is to capture part of the \nunearned increment in the land value resulting from the change in land use in the \ndevelopment  area  and  to  use  it  for  public  purposes.  We  may  add  here  a  fourth \nobjective, namely to offer an instrument to (re)distribute land-based wealth in a fair way \namongst landowners, land users, property developers and investors, and the public. \nTo achieve these objectives, different land management strategies can be applied. We \ndistinguish between partial land management strategies and a comprehensive land \nmanagement strategy (Figure 2). Partial land management strategies deal with certain \naspects  of  a  land  management  strategy,  while  comprehensive  models  offer  an \ninclusive approach covering all aspects of the process of land management. We are \naware that the division that we make here is artificial to a certain extent, since the  \ntools  and  instruments  that  are being  discussed  here  as  partial  land  management \nstrategies often are part of the comprehensive land management strategies as well. \nNevertheless, we think that the distinction is useful: it follows the academic literature on \nland policy; moreover, it relates to current policy debates in some countries on how \ninclusive or comprehensive land management strategies should be. \nThe (potential) use of the strategies and the (legal) tools and instruments are obviously \ncontextually  defined.  In  countries  where  land  is  state  owned,  land  management \nstrategies follow a completely different path from countries with private ownership of \nland. The strategy also depends on whether the process is participative (involving \nlandowners) or non-participative, as discussed by Shukla (2020). The use of certain \nlegal instruments and tools is constrained by planning and land laws. Institutional \ncapacity  problems  may  weaken  local  governments\u2019  positions  in  relation  to  land \nmarkets.  In  some  countries,  investment  strategies  for  local  governments  in  land \nmarkets are legally restricted. Finally, local land and real estate market conditions \ninfluence  the  effectiveness  of  both  public  and  private  sector  land  management \nstrategies (respectively, for instance, in terms of scarcity of land, market power by big \ndevelopers, and land prices, and in terms of real estate prices, vacancy rates, and \ndemand for real estate). The overview of land management strategies in this paper, \nhowever, does not take these context-related variations into consideration. \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nFigure 2: Land Management Strategies and Tools \n \nSource: Authors. \n3.  PARTIAL LAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES \nPossibly the most commonly applied development strategy for urban development is \nthe situation in which a private real estate developer or end user is in charge of (or has \nbeen commissioned to) a real estate development, from land acquisition to completion \nof the buildings, after which the public space that is part of the development is often \ntransferred to a public authority. Local governments may decide to support this strategy \nwith a variety of partial land management strategies and instruments.  \nBased  on  the  literature,  we  distinguish  ten  types  of  partial  land  management  \nstrategy: 1) compulsory public acquisition of land; 2) strategic public or private land \nbanking; 3) pre-emption rights; 4) graduated density zoning; 5) land bonds; 6) value \ncapture instruments; 7) inclusionary zoning; 8) land for infrastructure models; 9) the \nestablishment of markets for transferable development rights; and 10) public land  \nlease systems. \n3.1  Compulsory Public Acquisition of Land \nLand transfer from passive to active ownership sometimes requires compulsory public \nacquisition of land (also referred to as eminent domain, compulsory purchase, eviction, \nexpropriation, or resumption). Compulsory acquisition is simply defined as the power of \nthe sovereign to compulsorily acquire private land for public purposes such as building \ndams, roads, railways, hospitals, schools, and other public infrastructure. The most \npopular justification for the grant and exercise of this power to and by the government \nhas been social welfare maximization (Benson 2008). There is a strong argument to \nsupport that individuals\u2019 rights to property should give way to the social function of the \nproperty (Heller 2000) and priority should be given to the cumulative welfare of the \nsociety at large, over and above the personal interests of the affected landowners \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \n(Hong 2007). Of course, it would be more efficient and less confrontational if, in original \nplanning, certain plots or easements (slivers of land for rights of way expansion that \ncannot be built over outstanding subterranean sewering or services) for public building \npurposes could be reserved, as was done for school zones or public squares in the \nUnited States in 18th and 19th centuries. \nThere is a large body of literature related to the topic. Some of that literature discusses \nlegal aspects, particularly the conditions under which local governments are authorized \nto make use of compulsory public acquisition of land (Stoebuck 1972; Munch 1976; \nSagalyn et al. 2007; Jacobs 2008) and social conflicts arising from governments\u2019 use of \nexpropriation  powers  (Guo  2001;  Cohen  2005;  Labb\u00e9  2011).  While  compulsory \nacquisition in most countries concerns both ownership and user rights, in countries with \nstate ownership of land (e.g., People\u2019s Republic of China, Viet Nam), the acquisition \nconcerns the user rights only. Other literature discusses the compensation that must  \nbe paid to the landowners when their land has been expropriated by the state (Miceli \n1991; Zuhui and Hui 2002; Sluysmans et al. 2015; Holzmann-Gazit 2007). What is \nconsidered  just  compensation  differs  largely  amongst  countries,  ranging  from \ncompensation for the loss of the land based on the value of its original use to full \ncompensation based on the economic value of the land (which may be influenced by \nexpectations of a planned change in land use) and loss of income. We can at a \nminimum  agree  with  the  settled  international  law  standard  of  prompt,  adequate, \nequitable, and effective compensation in the broadest terms (though whether these are \nfully meaningful concepts for original owners\u2019 and indigenous peoples\u2019 relationship to \nthe land is another question entirely and is a dominant theme taken up in other parts  \nof this book). \nPrice  (2020)  explains  the  impact  of  the  history  of  property  institutions  on  the \nconstitutional status of private property rights in a country and the level of involvement \nof the original owners in land procurement processes, which is almost absent in the \ncompulsory acquisition process. He also explains how British and American roots in \nliberalism and individualism have created strong reliance on the coercive mechanism of \ncompulsory acquisition. Allen (2000) writes at length on the widespread adoption of \ncompulsory  acquisition  practices  across  commonwealth  countries  with  a  colonial \nhistory and strong borrowing from English land laws. Laws of land and compulsory \nacquisition in England have a very long history and are highly complex, involving \nlegislation and case law (Cox 2018). In the United States, compulsory acquisition is \nviewed as an attribute of sovereignty and does not require special legislation (Sullivan \n2018). That said, there is special legislation in place to define the limits of use of this \npower (Sullivan 2018). The Australian legislation does not mandate that compulsory \nacquisition be associated with public benefits, but the power is generally exercised for \nthe same (Searle 2018). There is a growing trend across a number of countries toward \nmore exceptional use of compulsory acquisition and/or more favorable treatment of \nlandowners (Searle 2018). Searle (2018) explains that when the legislation does not \nmandate public purpose for compulsory acquisition of land, as observed in America \nand Australia, then the underlying objective of social welfare maximization is put at risk, \nand assessment of whether the benefits of compulsory acquisition outweigh the costs \nis left to the courts to determine on a case-by-case basis.  \nUse of compulsory acquisition is less popular in countries that have communitarian \nroots and recognize the social function of private property, such as in Germany; the \nNetherlands;  Singapore;  and  Hong  Kong,  China.  Alternative  methods  of  land \nprocurement such as land pooling and other cooperative models are more popular in \nthese countries, which have limitations (be they legal or customary) on recourse to \ncompulsory  acquisition.  For  example,  in  Germany,  there  are  strict  constitutional \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nrequirements of the use of expropriation, thus limiting its use and entailing considerable \neffort and legal risks (Albrecht 2018), while Japan has avoiding relying on its powers \nthrough cultural caution and historical controversies (Stillman and Bharule 2020, Box \n25.3, p. 504).  \nHoltslag-Broekhof et al. (2018) explain the hierarchy of land procurement instruments \nused in the Netherlands based on their impact on private property rights. Given the \nemphasis on collaborative planning practices, the Dutch system positions compulsory \nacquisition at the bottom of the hierarchy as the least preferred option, because of its \nhigh negative impact on private property rights, strong interventionist approach, and \nhigh procedural costs (Holtslag-Broekhof et al. 2018). At the top of the hierarchy are \nthose instruments which rely on the willful participation of the original landowners,  \nsuch as voluntary land readjustment and voluntary land acquisition. Between the two \nextremes  of  voluntary  and  coercive  instruments  are  intermediate  methods  of  pre-\nemption and land consolidation (see section 3.3 below) (Holtslag-Broekhof et al. 2018).  \nIn Singapore, \u201cland can be acquired for any public purpose by any person, corporation \nor statutory board, for any work or an undertaking which, in the opinion of the Minister, \nis of public benefit or of public utility or in the public interest; or for any residential, \ncommercial or industrial purposes, the President may, by notification published in the \nGazette, declare the land to be required for the purpose specified in the notification\u201d \n(Christudason 2018, p. 127-128). The government is the deciding body on what is to  \nbe considered a public purpose, and in section 5(3), a declaration by the President is \nconclusive  that  land  is  required  for  such  a  purpose.  The  process  of  compulsory \nacquisition is finally implemented by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).  \nIn Hong Kong, China, freehold interest in all land is owned by the government, which \nassigns leasehold interest in the form of private property rights (Hastings and Adams \n2005).  The  power  of  compulsory  acquisition  of  private  property  is  allowed  under \nresumption rights of the Crown and/or specific ordinances of government and statutory \nauthorities to acquire land for public purposes (Ng 2002). On resumption of property, \nthe leaseholder is offered monetary compensation that is calculated using a definitive \nformula. There is also the possibility of a reverse compulsory acquisition to be initiated \nby  the  leaseholder  under  certain  circumstances  when  the  property  is  blighted  or \nreduced in value or use due to a change in zoning, planning regulations, and other \nactions by the government. The leaseholder may appeal to the Chief Executive-in-\nCouncil to acquire the property on payment of compensation.  \nFor properties with multiple owners, these rights are equally accessible to all co-owners \nwho hold an undivided share in the property. Regarding the compulsory acquisition of \nproperties under multiple ownership, the Land (compulsory sale for redevelopment) \nOrdinance Cap 545 was mooted in 1999 to facilitate land assembly by the private \nsector.  The  objective  was  to  overcome  constraints  in  assembling  land  under  the \nsystem  of  common  property  ownership  by  allowing  \u201cthe  majority  owner\u201d  of  the \nundivided shares in a lot to make an application to the Lands Tribunal for an order of \nsale of all the undivided shares. Subject to the satisfaction of all necessary conditions \nin the Ordinance, the property can be publicly auctioned and the proceeds divided \nproportionately among the co-owners. Amidst existing controversies over subsequent \ndisposal of compulsorily acquired land by public agencies to private developers, the \ninstitutional  arrangement  under  the  Land  (compulsory  sale  for  redevelopment) \nOrdinance that facilitates private compulsory acquisitions has further invited resistance \nfrom the landowners (Hastings and Adams 2005).  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \n3.2  Strategic Public or Private Land Banking \nWhile only a few countries make use of what we refer to as public comprehensive land \nbanking strategies (see section 4.2 below), the use of strategic public land banking is a \nmuch more common phenomenon.  \nIn the words of Alexander (2005), a land bank is an entity that assembles and banks \nland for short- or long-term strategic purposes. Public land banking is the mechanism \nfor the government to assemble land parcels, usually on the periphery of an urban \ncenter, with a view to developing or selling them for development at a future date \n(Stoebuck 1986). These developments may range from creating new towns to renewal \nof degenerated inner-city suburbs, and construction of large irrigation projects, future \nparks, or public buildings (Alexander 2005). In view of Fishman and Gross (1972, cited \nin Alexander 2005, p.143), public land banks are public bodies that acquire land in \nfuture urban growth areas to protect it from unplanned speculative development. Such \ninterventions are necessary to regulate the pace and direction of growth (Fishman and \nGross 1972). Depending on the laws that govern them or the jurisdictions that establish \nthem,  land  banks  differ  in  the  kinds  of  properties  that  they  hold.  Despite  these \ndifferences, one thing that is usually common among land banks is their focus of \nabandoned or vacant properties (van der Krabben and Jacobs 2013).  \nThe concept of land banking emerged in the United States as a planning instrument  \nin the latter part of the 20th century to create municipal land reserves for short- and \nlong-term control over urban planning. The earliest program was introduced in 1971 by \nthe St. Louis Land Reutilization Authority (the St. Louis Land Bank), and by 2004 it was \nexpanded to four other metropolitan areas of Cleveland, Louisville, Atlanta, and Flint \n(Alexander 2005).  \nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, urban areas were sprawling in an unregulated fashion, \nand inner-city suburbs were declining (Alexander 2005). There was a need for the local \ngovernment to take control of land, check urban sprawl, and regenerate inner cities \n(Alexander 2005). The concept of land banking was proposed with the intention of \ncreating  large-scale  land assemblies  that  can  facilitate  these  objectives.  Over  the \nyears,  the  close  relationship  between  urban  sprawl  and  regeneration  of  inner-city \nneighborhoods became evident, and the use of land banking was narrowed down  \nto assembling vacant, abandoned, and usually tax-delinquent parcels of land in the \ninner city for urban redevelopment opportunities in the future (Alexander 2005). The \nunderlying principle of the contemporary land banking model is that blighted properties \nin urban areas that are not reclaimed and redeveloped by market forces should be \nredeveloped and converted into assets for the community. \nLand banking as a land use planning tool can be used to shape and control the \ndevelopment of suburban communities. Land banking requires occasional exercise of \npowers  of  eminent  domain  and  is  therefore  implemented by  either  a  government \nagency or a corporation chartered by the government (Alexander 2005). Given the \ndifferences  in  the  socio-economic  configuration  of  cities  which  require  contextual \nsolutions, land banks vary significantly in their legal (and departmental) structure and \nfunction.  Thus,  land  banks  are  government  entities  which  have  no  fixed  form  or \nfunction. This has also caused legal problems for the courts, which have reluctantly \naccepted the \u2018public purpose\u2019 of large-scale land banking for community development \n(Stoebuck 1986). In summary, despite attracting the attention of planners at inception, \nland banking has failed to gain wider acceptance in the United States for reasons found \nin the realms of public opinion, politics, and economics (see further information, see \nStoebuck 1986).  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nOutside the United States, land banking has been used in Canada in the provinces  \nof Alberta and Saskatchewan. Large-scale land banking programs have also been \nimplemented in Australia; Denmark; Germany; the United Kingdom; Hong Kong, China; \nIsrael; the Netherlands; Norway; Finland; and Sweden. In the Netherlands, Finland, \nand Sweden, land banking is a successful strategy that has grown over the years, with \nan increasing amount of land under government possession (Valtonen, Falkenbach, \nand van der Krabben 2017). The bank acquires land by negotiation or, if necessary, \ncompulsory purchase. In the Netherlands, land banking is usually part of a public \ncomprehensive land banking model, with a broader purpose than just the banking of \nland (see section 4.3 below). Usually, land is disposed of through outright sale, but in \nsome cases long-term leasing is preferred. Linking the discussion back to Price (2020), \nland  banking  resonates  with  the  communitarian  ideology  of  public  ownership  of \nresources which is well understood by the Dutch and Swedish polity and society, and is \ncontrary to American liberalism and individualism (Stoebuck 1986).  \nIt is understandable that land banking requires the upfront cost of land to be incurred \nby the government. However, with the increase in value of the land during the holding \nperiod, significant profits can be made through the sale of land for market-intensive \nuses, and that can cause the original, less sophisticated landholders to lose trust in the \nintegrity of the process, especially in developing countries with corruption and conflict \nof interest challenges. This opportunity to make profit from land sales may at times \ncontradict the social welfare objectives of the government. \u201cConsidering the costs and \nbenefits of land banking to all of society, the question of whether, in strictly economic \nterms, benefits would exceed costs is unclear\u201d (Stoebuck 1986, p. 606). To counteract \nthis, in the Netherlands, the profits made from land sales are generally used to cover \ncosts of public amenities and to subsidize other loss-making development projects  \n(see section 4.3 below). \nApart  from  public  land  banking,  strategic  or  speculative  land  acquisitions  or  land \ngrabbing by private sector companies is a common phenomenon in most countries \naround the world due to the specific nature of land markets. Huge gains may arise \nthrough the rezoning of land, which may be legitimate and transparent or corruptly \ndecided, as well as the construction of new infrastructure and improved accessibility. \nThough  strategic  land  acquisitions  can  be  a  smart  investment  strategy  from  the \nperspective of a real estate developer who wants to use that land in the future for urban \ndevelopment, most literature addresses the problems caused by speculative private \nsector acquisitions and land grabbing. While the major part of that literature refers  \nto land grabbing problems in the Global South (Firmans 2000, 2004; von Braun and \nMeinzan-Dick 2009; Hall et al. 2011; McCarthy et al. 2012; McMichael 2012; Shatkin \n2016;  Steel  et  al.  2017),  speculative  land  acquisitions  and  corrupt  planning  and  \nland use management cause problems in other parts of the developed world as well \n(see, for example, Adams and Tiesdell 2012; and, most recently, LA city Planning and \nLand Use Management indictments in July 2020). \n3.3  Pre-Emption (or Right of First Refusal) \nPre-emption is the right that the landowner gives the state or local government to buy \nproperty  first  at  the  market  value  before  other  parties  (Zevenbergen,  Ferlan,  and \nMattason 2007). It comprises a formal instrument that entitles the public authority to the \nfirst option to buy a property under certain conditions (Holtslag-Broekhof, Hartmann, \nand Spit 2018). In the Netherlands, the Municipal Pre-emption Right Act (WVG) gives \nthe municipality the right to declare its interest in areas proposed for urban renewal and \nexpansion (Zevenbergen, Ferlan, and Mattason 2007). As and when the owner is \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nready to sell land over which municipal pre-emption has been imposed, the land is first \noffered to the municipality (Zevenbergen, Ferlan, and Mattason 2007). The market \nvalue at which the municipality would purchase land is determined using same rules as \nin  expropriation  law  (Zevenbergen,  Ferlan,  and  Mattason  2007).  Based  on  the \nestimated price, the municipality may decide either to buy the land or decline the sale. \nAlso, the owner has the choice of either accepting the estimated price or deciding not \nto sell at all. No appeal is possible for negotiation on price. If the municipality decides \nnot to buy the property, the owner is free to sell in the open market within the next  \nthree years. These rights are registrable in the Netherlands and are used to ensure that \npublic interests are protected (Zevenbergen, Ferlan, and Mattason 2007). Pre-emption \nrights are prevalent in other countries as well. In France, certain zones identified for \nfuture development by the government are declared Zones d\u2019Am\u00e9nagement Differ\u00e9 \n(zones of deferred development) (World Bank 2020). In these zones, the government \nhas the right of first refusal for any land transaction within a set timeframe. As a \nprocess, property owners who want to sell their land are required to declare their intent \nto sell. Within a set time frame (usually around two months), the government will either \naccept the owner\u2019s requested price or, in the case of a dispute over price, agree to a \nnegotiated  settlement.  Alternatively,  the  government  may  approach  the  court  to \ndetermine price, which is set at the market rate two years before the declaration of the \nright of pre-emption. This instrument enables the government to avoid the kind of land \nspeculation that may follow notification on changes to the urban development plans \n(World Bank, 2020). Pre-emption rights were used in the US alongside settlers\u2019 rights \nto purchase public land. These have been part of the Land Act 1804, the Desert Act, \nand the Homestead Act in the US. In Australia, pre-emption rights are not imposed by \nstatute, though, as a matter of contract law, parties can grant pre-emptive rights or first \nrights of refusal in relation to the sale of real estate. The use of pre-emption rights \ncalled shu\u2019fa is prevalent, and it provides a right of first refusal over the sale of a given \nland or property to its direct neighbors.  \n3.4  Graduated Density Zoning \nOften it is difficult to encourage redevelopment at a higher density within the city due to \nchallenges involved in assembling land from multiple small landowners and the typical \nproblem of holdout. Shoup\u2019s (2008) model of land assembling relies on voluntary \nassembly of land by the original owners through zoning incentives. For example, if a \ncity needs to increase density around a rail transit line, it may adopt the strategy of \nallowing, say, a multifamily housing development of up to 50 units on all plots greater \nthan one acre. If the value of land for 50 units significantly exceeds the existing value, \nthere is a strong incentive for landowners to come together voluntarily and pool land  \nto at least an acre and allow redevelopment. Shoup (2008) further explains that if \ngraduated density zoning is applied to an area that is large enough to allow multiple \ncollections of owners whose assembled land would trigger high density development, \nthe competition among landowners would reduce the power of holdout and induce the \nfear of being left out. That said, graduated density zoning cannot fully eliminate the \nincentive to hold out, which would result in isolated sites that cannot be combined with \nother  contiguous  parcels.  Nevertheless,  cooperation  among  the  original  owners \ncombined with competition among developers may shift and improve capital gains for \nthe original owners.  \nThe model has been practically executed in Simi Valley, a suburb of Los Angeles \n(Shoup 2008). The condition of having at least 13 acres of land for high density \ndevelopment in Simi Valley increased the incentive for the original owners to assemble \nand develop land voluntarily. As observed in this project, graduated density zoning \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \ndemotivates strategic holdouts, thus increasing the probability of a redevelopment that \ngenerates returns for the original owners, developers, and cities (Shoup 2008). \n3.5  Land Bonds \nLand bonds are financial bonds used by municipalities in many countries to provide \nfunding for investment in the acquisition of land for (future) urban development (Temel \n2001; Cullingworth 1994). Municipal land or infrastructure bonds are considered by \nmany as attractive financing constructs for developing countries in Asia (Leigland and \nThomas 1997; Platz 2009). Rehabilitation bonds are constantly evolving in the United \nStates, particularly in California and other areas with large redevelopment needs (see \nYoshino and Stillman 2017). \n3.6  Value Capture Instruments \nLand value capture refers to the \u2018creaming off\u2019 of increases in land value by a public \nbody from the landowner, where the increased land value is the result of rezoning the \nland or public infrastructure provision. A large body of literature discusses the legal \nright of a state body to take part of the landowner\u2019s development gain and use it for \npublic purposes (for an overview of that literature, see Alterman 2012; Mu\u00f1oz-Gielen \nand van der Krabben 2019). Perhaps the most documented dispute over taxing land \nvalue increase took place in the 1940s in the United Kingdom after publication of the \nUthwatt report in 1942. The Uthwatt Committee discussed, among other things, the \nintroduction of a betterment levy to capture the planning gain. A 100% betterment levy \nwas introduced in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act, and any development \nrequired a payment to the Central Land Board. Sale of land in private ownership to \ndevelopers  attracted  a  levy.  However,  the  political  controversy  about  the  new \nregulation became clear soon after when the subsequent Conservative government \nimmediately decided to abolish it in the 1954 Planning Act (Mu\u00f1oz-Gielen and van der \nKrabben 2019). \nOther literature discusses the instruments that can be used for land value capture (for \nan overview of that literature, see Alterman 2012; Mu\u00f1oz-Gielen and van der Krabben \n2019).  An  often-made  distinction  is  between  direct  and  indirect  value  capture \nmechanisms. According to Alterman (2009, p. 199):  \nDirect value capture mechanisms refer to an increase in the value of land of private \nowners through actions undertaken by public authorities or by the general community. \nThe rationale for value capture is thus the fact that the increase in value was not \ncaused  personally  by  an  individual  and  hence  should  be  shared  with  a  broader \ncommunity.  \nA  classic  example  would  be  where  services  are  supplied  to  an  off-grid  rural  or \nperiurban property, such as sewer pipes, and the homeowner readily pays the local \ngovernment a contribution toward the costs of the connection to the mains and its \nongoing maintenance by way of a sewer betterment fee or charge, as it replaces the \nold septic tank and the chore of having it emptied. Often, however, the betterment is \nnot compensated or charged to the benefitting homeowners, such as where a new stop \nfor a train or bus line is added, increasing access to the private property. \nThese types of direct value capture mechanisms are often referred to as betterments, \n(unearned) increments, or windfalls. Based on an international review of value capture \nmechanisms, Mu\u00f1oz-Gielen and van der Krabben (2019, p.6) claim that indirect value \ncapture instruments are now more commonly used: \u201c(n)ext to proposals of land value \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \ncapture based on a direct rationale (the community is the rightful owner of all or part of \nthe  increased  value  and  should  therefore  capture  it),  other  proposals  have come \nforward that are based on different, \u2018indirect\u2019 rationales, of which the internalization of \nnegative externalities of urban development is the most common one. These proposals \ndo  not  challenge  fundamental  ideological  principles  and  do  not  always  require  a \ndetailed regulation, which make them easier to introduce\u201d. Typical examples of indirect \nvalue capture instruments include developer obligations, infrastructure levies, impact \nfees, and agreements with developers, often to supply public goods and services, such \nas playgrounds, greenbelts, or low-rent, affordable housing (see below). \n3.7  Inclusionary Zoning \nInclusionary zoning, also known as inclusionary housing, can be considered as a \nspecial kind of value capture mechanism. Alongside \u2018regular\u2019 zoning ordinances, there \nare inclusionary zoning programs which require private developers who undertake \nresidential development to contribute a portion of their units toward affordable housing \nfor  those  who  are  crowded  out  in  the  upscaling  residential  market  (Calavita  and \nMallach 2009, p. 15). Though mainly applied by local governments in the United States \n(Ellickson 1981; Calavita, Grimes, and Mallach 1997), some have suggested the use of \ninclusionary zoning as an instrument in (Asian) developing countries as well (Meda \n2010; Turk and Altes 2014; Mukhija et al. 2015; Mishra and Mohanty 2017). \n3.8  Land for Infrastructure Models \nBased on the idea that both road and public transport infrastructure investments\u2014\nadding to improved locational accessibility\u2014lead to higher land and real estate prices, \nmany countries have implemented policies for integrated transit-oriented development \n(TOD) projects. These policies aim to integrate land and real estate development with \ntransport infrastructure investments in different ways. We consider these policies as \npartial land management strategies, since they may contribute to the financing of \ninvestment in land and also serve as a value capture mechanism. Next to many more \nstudies of how land value can be captured to finance TOD (including Cervero et al. \n2004; Cervero and Murakami 2009; Ingram and Hong 2012; Murakami and Gregory \n2012; Li 2013; Medda 2012; Sun et al. 2017), Suzuki et al. (2015) provide a good \noverview for developing countries in Asia and elsewhere of how land value capture \ninstruments can be used to optimize and finance TOD strategies. \nIn other contexts, many (developing) countries make use of different types of land  \nfor  infrastructure  models.  Public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  have  been  used  as \nsuccessful funding mechanism for the construction of major infrastructure projects in \nmany developing countries in Asia (ADB 2008). The most common PPP model is the \nbuild-operate-transfer  (BOT)  model.  Less  familiar  is  the  build-transfer  (BT)  model, \nwhich can be considered a land value capture tool. Land for infrastructure models can \nbe seen as a specification of the BT model. Investors are offered \u2018sweetheart\u2019 price \ndiscounts or attractive rights to develop the land as compensation for constructing  \nthe infrastructure. The advantage of these models is that the authorities are able to \ndevelop economic infrastructures without having to incur expenditure through public \nfunds. Investors generate their returns from the commercialization of acquired land. \nThe  possible  downside  of  the  land-for-infrastructure  mechanism  lies  in  the  public \nsector\u2019s weak position to negotiate the terms of the concession contract as public \nagencies aim to balance their urban planning objectives with motives for value capture. \nFrequently the original owners feel cheated when they see they were bought out at  \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nlow market prices and the benefit of the value added is reaped by wealthy private \ndevelopers who gain political advantage from their public sector partners. \n3.9  Establishment of Markets for Transferable  \nDevelopment Rights \nIn some countries such as Brazil, India, the Netherlands, and the US, markets for \ntransferable development rights have been established to support land development. \nFor this, usually two interventions are needed: first, the development right over land \nmust be separated from the ownership right over land; second, a market must be \ncreated where trading of development rights can take place. The establishment of a \nmarket for transferable development rights may serve two different purposes. First, in \nsome  countries,  governments  decide  to  create  a  market  for  development  rights, \nenabling them to raise an income from selling these rights. The income generated from \nselling the development rights can be used to finance the costs of urban transformation \nprojects and/or public infrastructure (Sandroni 2010; Smolka 2013; Suzuki et al. 2015). \nSecond,  transferable  development  rights  are  sometimes  offered  as  non-financial \ncompensation to landowners. The transfer of development rights is based on the ability \nto transfer additional value from one development to the other. This compensates for \nlosses  by  those  whose  planning  and  development  rights  are  reduced  due  to  a \ngovernment (planning) intervention (van der Veen et al. 2010; Alterman 2012).  \n3.10 Public Land Lease Systems \nIn countries with state ownership of land, after the development, the land remains state \nowned and user rights over that land are leased to the leaseholder for a certain time \nperiod. In Asia, the best-known example is the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s land  \nlease system (see, generally, [Wu and Yang 2020]). For urban development, local \ngovernments in the PRC would usually first expropriate rural land and service that land \nwith a basic infrastructure. Then the local government would sell the user rights of the \nserviced land to a user for a pre-specified use. The land concession fee is determined \neither by negotiated agreement or (predominantly) by competitive tendering or auction. \nLand leasing is the common way for local governments to capture land value in the \nPRC. The revenue generated as extra-budgetary revenue is used to pay for local \npublic infrastructure development, but there is usually no direct link between the lease \non a plot of land and the infrastructure provided on the plot (Ingram and Hong 2012). \nLand finance in the PRC is a significant type of fiscal revenue strategy for local \ngovernments to raise revenue through land leasing and land tax in the PRC (Wang  \net al. 2012). Other examples of public land lease systems can be found in Viet Nam \n(Labb\u00e9 and Musil 2013) and, in a very different context, the Netherlands (Ploeger and \nBounjouh 2017; Korthals Altes 2019). \n4.  COMPREHENSIVE LAND MANAGEMENT \nSTRATEGIES \nWe distinguish three types of comprehensive land management strategy: a private \nmarket land management strategy, a public comprehensive land banking strategy, and \na collaborative private-private land management strategy. \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \n4.1  Private Market Land Management Strategy \nFully private market land management strategies, in which a private land developer \nacquires land, puts in the infrastructure, and services the land with the intention to  \nsell building plots to other developers or end users, are not very common. Private \nsector developers usually prefer to invest in real estate development (land and property \ndevelopment)  and  not  in  land  development  alone.  Exceptions  are  public-private \npartnership land development agencies, which develop, for instance, industrial estates. \nAs stated above, when private developers invest in real estate development they often \ntake care of at least part of the land management activities, in which state bodies\u2019 \npartial land management strategies and instruments may support them. \n4.2  Public Comprehensive Land Banking Model \nIn a public comprehensive land banking model, a public authority acts as a land \ndeveloper that takes control over all aspects of the land development process, from the \nacquisition of the land to be developed to the ownership and management of the public \nspace after ready-to-build-on building plots have been sold to private developers and/or \nend users (van der Krabben and Jacobs 2013; Valtonen, Falkenbach, and van der \nKrabben 2017). With such a comprehensive public land development model, local \nauthorities are not only able to support a planned urban development (by offering \nbuilding plots and public facilities), but they can achieve broader planning goals as well \n(e.g., reserve land for affordable housing and greenbelts; provide higher-quality public \nfacilities; or use profits from the sale of building plots in a greenfield development  \nto subsidize the development of a brownfield development). A crucial aspect of this \ndevelopment strategy is that local authorities can use the net income from buying \n(usually farming) land and selling building plots to pay for all the necessary public \nfacilities for the development area. This public comprehensive land banking model \ndiffers from public strategic land banking because of its objectives: while strategic land \nbanking is mainly used to secure land for future urban development and to transfer it \nfrom passive to active ownership when the time is right, the aims of the comprehensive \nmodel are to develop the whole location, except for the buildings, and to achieve these \nbroader planning goals. Apart from the supposed planning-related benefits, several \nauthors warn of the financial risks for municipalities relying on this development model \nwithout a serious risk management strategy (Buitelaar 2010; van der Krabben and \nJacobs 2013; Valtonen, Falkenbach, and van der Krabben 2017), due to the effects of \nchanging housing market conditions on demand for and price of building plots. Others \nhave discussed the effectiveness and efficiency of this model (Hartmann and Spit \n2015), and the degree of discretional power municipalities have to apply this model and \nhow they make use of that (Woestenburg, Spit, and van der Krabben 2019). We are \naware of only a few countries making use of this development model. In Europe, \nextensive use of the development model seems to be limited to Finland (Viitanen et al. \n2003; Valtonen, Falkenbach, and van der Krabben 2017), Sweden (Caesar 2016), and \nthe Netherlands (Needham 1992; van der Krabben and Jacobs 2013; Buitelaar and \nBregman 2016). We are not aware of the use of a similar development model in  \nAsia. The PRC\u2019s land development model, based on its state ownership of land, has \nsimilarities  but  differs  in  comprehensiveness:  Chinese  cities  would  usually  lease \nunserviced land to private developers, requiring the developers to install the public \nfacilities. \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \n4.3  Collaborative Private-private Land Management Model \nCollaborative private-private land management models have sometimes been termed \n\u2018sleeping beauty\u2019\u2014potentially interesting but rarely useful in practice (Alterman 2012,  \np. 765). We distinguish them into urban land readjustment models (also referred to  \nas land consolidation and land pooling) and land trust models (distinguished into bank \ntrusts  and  community  land  trusts).  Urban  land  readjustment  models  have  been \npromoted for a long time by international development organizations such as UN-\nHABITAT (2012), the World Bank, the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy, and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, while the Asian Development Bank has successfully \nintroduced land trust models in several Asian countries (Kanda 2016; Yoshino et al. \n2018) for the self-finance of infrastructure costs and the fair distribution of development \ngain offered by these models. A Private Trust Law has been approved by the Cabinet \nin Thailand and is being reviewed by the Council of State, which will facilitate the \nintroduction of a land trust (Urapeepatanapong et al. 2016; Piewthongngam 2020).  \n4.3.1  Urban Land Readjustment \nAs a mechanism for land consolidation, urban land readjustment (ULR)\u2014also known \nas land pooling, replotting, land reassembly, reparcellation, repartition, Kakaku seiri  \n(in Japan) and Umlegung (in Germany)\u2014assembles and reparcels land by possible \nswapping of land positions among landowners without the need for any transaction, so \nthat part of the land can be used for public services and infrastructure that benefits \nexisting landowners as well as the city. Land readjustment is also used for planned \ndevelopment of urban fringe lands. A government agency assembles (often irregular) \nland parcels and then subdivides them into a planned grid layout of streets, open \nspaces, and serviced lots. Some of the plots are retained for cost recovery, while the \nremaining plots (slightly reduced in area) are transferred back to the landowners for \ndevelopment or sale (Archer 1992, p. 155). The process is most popularly used when \nland parcels are fragmented, and existing boundaries are in conflict with proposed \nplanning  outlines.  The  mechanism  supports  land-based  financing  of  the  proposed \ndevelopment  plan  in  the  sense  that  in  addition  to  land  required  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment, a portion of land is retained by the public agency for commercial sale in \nthe market to recover the cost of development. The underlying assumption of ULR is \nthat all necessary public infrastructure costs will be paid from the development gain \nthat results from the proposed development. Reparcelling of the land results in higher \nland values for participating landowners as well. Urban land readjustment also differs \nfrom  alternative  development  strategies  because  all  individual  land  and  property \nowners in an urban land readjustment project share the development gain (and the \nrisks) of the (re)development of the area equally (van der Krabben and Lenferink 2018, \np. 115).  \nCompared to the compulsory acquisition of land, which requires huge upfront cost,  \nland readjustment is financially less burdensome for public agencies, particularly for \ndeveloping economies. Unlike in the case of compulsory acquisition, where landowners \nat  times  lose  all  their  land  in  return  for  monetary  compensation,  under  land \nreadjustment they receive back a new parcel of land, proportional in size or value to  \nthe  original  land  parcel,  that  offers  them  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  the  new \ndevelopment. The size of land received after readjustment is smaller, but the value is \nraised due to infrastructure improvements and other developments caused by the \nproject. As much care as possible is taken to minimize displacement by allocating the \nnew land parcel near to each owner\u2019s original parcel. \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nLand  assembly  and  development  through  land  readjustment  generates  desirable \noutcomes for all stakeholders by creating planned development patterns, increasing \nland values, and limiting displacements. This is not to say that the process is free of \nchallenges. Often it is difficult to get landowners on board when they do not recognize \nthe social function of property, or distrust the motives, commitment, and abilities of the \ngovernment and sponsors, and are consequently less motivated to contribute a portion \nof land for public amenities (Hong and Brain 2012). Also, lack of representativeness of \noriginal landowners in the planning process, unclear or unrecognized land titles, and \npoor ownership records make it logistically difficult to implement the process (Hong and \nBrain 2012; Price 2020). \nULR has been used in many EU countries, but not in the United Kingdom and Ireland. \nWhile Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, France, Spain, and Norway \nhave long traditions in using ULR (although in some of these countries the instrument \nhas indeed appeared a \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019), other countries in Europe (Albania, Armenia, \nCroatia, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, and the Russian Federation) \nhave also used forms of land consolidation. The Netherlands has a more than 100-year \ntradition of agricultural land readjustment, but until recently lacked regulation for urban \nland readjustment (van der Krabben and Needham 2008). With the introduction of a \nnew planning law in 2018, however, ULR regulation has now been introduced here as \nwell (van der Krabben and Lenferink 2018).  \nGlobally, different forms of land readjustment can be found in Asia (the PRC; India; \nIndonesia; Japan; Nepal; the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea; the Republic  \nof  Korea;  Taipei,China;  Thailand;  Turkey;  and  Pakistan),  in  Africa  (Egypt,  Kenya, \nMorocco, and Zimbabwe), in North and Central America (Canada, Mexico, and the \nUnited States), in South America (Chile and Colombia), in the Middle East (Israel, \nLebanon), and in Australia (Home 2007; Demetriou et al. 2011). Particularly, in Japan \n(Sorensen 2000), the Republic of Korea (Kresse et al. 2020), and Taipei,China (Lin \n2005), ULR has proven to be very successful in transforming traditional places in \nmodern cities. Different countries have used different models for land readjustment, \nthough the underlying principles have been the same.  \nIn  general,  an  urban  land  readjustment  scheme  has  the  following  characteristics  \n(van der Krabben and Lenferink 2018, p. 116):  \nAll property owners are invited to temporarily transfer their property rights to a third \nparty to allow the reparcelling of the land. (\u2026) The land readjustment scheme can only \nbe implemented when all property owners participate or can be enforced to participate. \n(\u2026) After a decision has been taken, the third party will reparcel the land into building \nplots that match the layout of the new development plan for the location. Consequently, \nall owners are assigned a building plot to build on, equal to their original share, either in \nvalue or in size (if not, compensation takes place). The value increase of the land as a \nresult of the land readjustment will first be used to cover the costs of the process and to \nmake land available for necessary public facilities related to the new development. The \nremaining will go to the owners. In some countries, also the costs for the realization of \npublic facilities are paid out of the value increase.  \nThe participation of landowners is necessary for ULR to materialize, and different \nauthorities  have  different  regulations  around  this.  Some  require  the  voluntary \nparticipation  of  all;  others  require  majority  participation  (the  rest  could  be  without \nconsent); and some are compulsory.  \nIn Japan, land readjustment has been well utilized, in place of compulsory acquisition, \nto provide land for roads, parks, and riverway improvements (Shultz and Schnidman \n1990). Land readjustment in Japan is executed under the Land Readjustment Act. In \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nsome cases where land readjustment has been used, public utility projects (such as \nsewers and gas mains) have also been included, though not mandated under the Land \nReadjustment Act. The infrastructure and public facilities are financed through the sale \nof financial resource land, which is retailed by the project authority executing land \nreadjustment. For projects which require a larger outlay, the cost of public facilities is \nshared by the national, prefectural, and local governments. An agreement by two-thirds \nof the affected households provides an automatic legal mandate for land readjustment \nto  proceed.  However,  in  practice,  very  rarely  is  this  mandate  used  to  force  the \nremaining one-third of households to participate against their will. Project authorities \nmake serious and patient attempts to obtain a consensus among all the households, \nwhich results in drawn-out implementation and deal-breaking delays. Taipei,China and \nthe Republic of Korea have followed similar processes for land consolidation to Japan. \nIn countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, where the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) is providing technical assistance for land consolidation, the procedures \nused are similar to land readjustment in Japan. However, these countries also have \nprovision for, and occasional resource to, compulsory acquisition of land under the \nLand  Acquisition  Act  (Agrawal  1999).  Land  readjustment  in  Indonesia  requires \nagreement by at least 85% of landowners covering at least 85% of the area as a  \nbasis to implement the project. Once the agreement of 85% of landowners is achieved, \nland from the remaining 15% of households is acquired compulsorily. Legal provisions \nfor  compensation  in  cases  of  compulsory  acquisition  in  Indonesia  are  frequently \ninadequate. This has resulted in the pressured participation of even those who do not \ninitially consent to land readjustment (Guild 2020).  \nLin (2005) analyzed the Neihu land readjustment project in Taipei,China. The land use \nprior to the project in this area was agriculture. The city required industrial sites to \nrelocate scattered illegal factories and land to augment the housing supply. These \nobjectives were achieved through a land readjustment project. Lin (2005) argued that \nland readjustment has not solved the problem of co-ownership. The readjusted land \nthat had a single owner was bought by developers, but land under co-ownership saw \nfew transactions, and was largely bought by speculators. For a land readjustment \nproject to succeed, it is important that the readjusted sites and developable land can be \nmarketed effectively.  \nIn the Republic of Korea, land readjustment serves broader social goals beyond the \nprovision of urban services, including for low-income housing (Shultz and Schnidman \n1990).  Western  areas  of  Germany  use  compulsory  land  readjustment  primarily  in \nperipheral areas for town expansion and renewal projects that are implemented by  \nthe local government (Shultz and Schnidman 1990). These projects do not require \nlandowner consent (Shultz and Schnidman 1990). With local authority approval, land \nreadjustment projects can also be undertaken by owners or developers. Due to the \ncompulsory nature of land readjustment in Germany, it takes one to three years for \nreplatting and two years or less for the installation of services, compared to five to  \nten years in other countries. A significant part of the project cost (as much as 90%) for \nthe provision of roads and open space is borne by landowners (Shultz and Schnidman \n1990).  In  Germany,  unlike  other  countries  with  land  readjustment  programs, \ncontributions from landowners to the cost of public projects usually take the form of \ncash rather than land to be sold to recover costs. There is, however, an upper limit  \nof 30% of the market value of the land, or the land itself, that can be taken from \nlandowners by the local authority for public use. Land readjustment, called land pooling \nin Australia, is used only in the one state of Western Australia (Shultz and Schnidman \n1990) where financing and transforming privately-owned land into planned, serviced \nbuilding sites has been attempted.  \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nAnother variant of ULR has been used in Lebanon in its reconstruction of the war-torn \nBeirut Central District (BCD). In this model, the redevelopment of BCD was handed \nover  to  a  private  company,  Solidere.  Instead  of  reparcelling  the  land  to  previous \nowners,  landowners  were  allocated  equity  shares  in  the  development  company, \nSolidere, in proportion to their land contribution. The company also issued shares in the \nopen market, which allowed it to raise cash from investors for development purposes. \nAn  enabling  legislation  locked  property  owners  in  a  compulsory  association  with \ninvestors and the shares replaced the deeds. The right to occupation or return for \nproperty owners was extinguished (Home 2007).  \nLi and Li (2007) discuss the case of vertical land readjustment in Hong Kong, China, as \na high-rise high-density city with limited opportunities for traditional horizontal land \nreadjustment.  Most  crucial  is  the  demand  for  residential  buildings,  for  which  the \ngovernment often relies on the redevelopment of old urban residential buildings to \nincreased height and density. While absolute ownership of all land rests with the \ngovernment, the leasehold ownership of land is distributed among apartment owners \nas an undivided share. This is popularly known as the tenancy-in-common system, \nwhere tenancy implies leasehold (and not rental tenant) ownership held in common by \nthe owners rather than by a single owner (Li and Li 2007). Using the case study of Lai \nSing Court, Li and Li (2007) explain the concept of vertical land readjustment, which \nmeans the redevelopment of an existing residential site in a way such that the original \nowners receive back a proportionate share of housing in the new development that  \nhas more units than in the previously existing building. The process requires the \ncooperation and participation of the original owners, as well as of the developer and \nauthority. Land readjustment in this case reduces the risks for the developer, as the \nrequirement to secure upfront financial commitment to buy property rights from the \nowners is not there. The gain from the project for developers is through the sale of \nextra floor area after completion of the project. The original owners have the flexibility \nto sell their strata contracts in the open market (Li and Li, 2007). The original owners, \non the other hand, work together under dedicated leadership provided by the chairman \nof the owners\u2019 association. In summary, a joint coordinated effort from all stakeholders \nand fair distribution of benefits of redevelopment have underpinned the success of this \nmodel (Li and Li 2007).  \nA perceived major drawback of land readjustment is the long gestation period for \nproject  execution  and  fulfillment  (Shultz  and  Schnidman  1990).  Japanese  land \nreadjustment projects, for instance, often face numerous administrative appeals filed by \nproperty  owners  who  object  to  the  property  redistribution  scheme.  Resolving  the \nconflicting interests of numerous owners in a large infrastructure project can take more \nthan a decade. Another drawback of land readjustment programs is that they lead to \nspeculation in real estate and a rise in land prices, as a result of to which objectives \nsuch as providing low- and moderate-income housing become untenable.  \nIn another criticism, Hong (2007) argues that the use of state power to take private \nproperty should only be for valid public purposes with just compensation. When the \nboundaries of private properties are readjusted to facilitate private redevelopment, the \npurpose can no longer be justified as purely public. As per the constitution, Hong \n(2007)  contends  that  the  basis  for  a  land  readjustment  agency  to  assemble  and \ntransfer private use rights for private development is unlawful. Not without reason, \nopponents have accused public authorities of using these public powers for private or \nunacceptably mixed public-private gains.  \nUsing the German land readjustment system as an example, Davy (2007) analyzes  \nthe legal issues associated with land readjustment. He argues that in 2001, the First \nChamber of the German Constitutional Court ruled that compulsory land readjustment \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \ndoes not equate to compulsory acquisition. Rather, land readjustment \u201cwould only use \nthe legislative power to determine the content and scope of property\u201d, which is within \nthe legal right of federal and state governments according to Article 14 of the German \nConstitution. The court also ruled that since the acquisition of land is temporarily and \nlargely for private use, the constitutional provision that governs the reasonableness of \ncompulsory acquisition could not be applied in cases of compulsory land readjustment. \nThis  ruling  has  enabled  the  use  of  compulsory  land  readjustment  for  assembling  \nland  for  redevelopment  projects  in  Germany.  However,  treating  compulsory  land \nreadjustment as a service to private landowners has constrained the government\u2019s \nability to procure land from property owners for public purposes or for land value \ncapture to finance local infrastructure (Davy 2007).  \nWe  observe  that  land  readjustment  can  be  a  time-consuming  process,  as  its \nimplementation  requires  that  land  is  assembled  through  consensus  rather  than \ncoercion.  Coercion  is  only  the  last  resort  when  all  attempts  for  consensus  have  \nbeen  exhausted.  Consequently,  land  readjustment,  although  preferable  for  its \nvoluntariness and acceptance, takes much longer than other planning instruments for \nassembling land.  \nIn terms of acceptability and applicability of land readjustment, small lots and lots with \nsuboptimal shapes have larger tendency to be redeveloped. Regarding ownership, lots \noccupied by the city are more likely to be assembled, while private owner-occupation \nreduces  the  likelihood  of  assembly  (Lindenthal,  Eichholtz,  and  Geltner  2017). \nLindenthal et al. also argue that the likelihood of joint redevelopment increases when \nlandowners have the same occupation and/or the same socio-political beliefs and \nreligion. A similar mechanism has been used in the case of Japan, where there has \nbeen wide application of land readjustment. It has been argued that Japanese society, \nwhere working culture is organized in groups, instills a collaborative and consensual \ndecision-making  that  facilitates  the  implementation  structure  of  land  readjustment. \nWithin this organizational framework, it may be asserted that in Western cultures, \nwhich  underscore  the  importance  of  individual  freedom  and  self-expression  over \ncollective or state control, land readjustment projects like in Japan would be difficult to \npropose  and  implement.  Sorensen  (2007)  disagrees  with  this  characterization, \ncontending that proposals for the readjustment of land in Japan have been just as \ncontentious and fiercely contested as in other countries.  \n4.3.2  Land Trusts \nA land trust model combines individual ownership rights with collective landownership \nby separating the ownership of land and structures on the land (Fujii 2016). The \nentrustee, who can be either a trust bank or a cooperative, acquires ownership of land \nfrom the original landowners in a certain area and manages and develops that land on \nbehalf of the entrusters (the original landowners). By entrusting their land to the trust \nbank or community land trust, the entrusters can benefit from the entrustee\u2019s efforts  \nto pool all land and invest in the development of that land in a more effective way.  \nIn Yoshino et al. (2018), we find the example of a real estate trust. Residents living  \nin  small  landed  houses  may  increase  the  efficiency  of  their  land  utilization  by \nconsolidating the land and building apartments or office blocks on it. The mechanism \nused is that land owners entrust their land to the trust bank, and the trust bank builds a \nlarge building on the consolidated land to effectively utilize the land. Landowners who \ncontributed land receive apartments in the building and part of the profit generated from \ncommercial leasing of space in the building as dividends from the trust bank (Yoshino \net al. 2018, p. 8). Similar to the land readjustment mechanism, the consolidation of land \nresults in more profitable development and the original owners can share in these \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nprofits.  In  a  land  readjustment  scheme,  the  original  landowners  will  receive  full \nownership of land and properties again after the readjustment has been completed; in \na land trust model, the original landowners receive user rights, while ownership of the \nland  remains  with  the  entrustee.  In  the  latter  case,  the  original  landowners  will \nadditionally receive part of the profits as dividends from the trust bank. \nA simplified model of land trust is presented in Figure 3. The entruster may decide not \nto give away the property immediately and instead leave it with the entrustee after \ndefining certain conditions for the beneficiary to receive the profit (Yoshino et al. 2018). \nThe land trust (or entrustee) receives trusts of real property or land from the entrusters \nand takes on the brokerage and appraisal of entrusted properties to the beneficiaries \n(Yoshino et al. 2018).  \nFigure 3: A Model of Land-Lease Arrangement Organized by a Land Trust Bank \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 adaptation of Yoshino et al. (2018, p. 7). \nThe application of the above model has been explained by Yoshino et al. (2018) in  \nthe  context  of  the  densely  populated  city  of  Tokyo,  where  small  landed  houses  \nare common. The original landowners may maximize the use of their property by \nconsolidating land through a land trust that can then construct a high-rise residential \nbuilding to actualize the development potential of the land. The original owners may \nbenefit  by  securing  a  bigger  apartment  unit  in  the  new  development,  while  also \nreceiving part of the development profit as dividends from the trust bank.  \nYoshino et al. (2018) advocate the land trust model as an inclusive method of land \nassembly where the original landowner can be party to development returns (see \nHossain and Yoshino [2020]). Also, there are financial incentives for those investing \nprivately in infrastructure projects which are otherwise unfeasible for the government, \nparticularly  in  developing  countries.  However,  this  method  has  been  rarely  used \noutside Japan, and therefore its practical challenges in developing Asia are yet to be \nexamined. \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \n5.  CONCLUSION \nWe aimed with this paper to prepare an overview of land use management strategies \nand instruments encountered in different parts of the world. We by no means had the \nintention to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and/or social equity of the different \nstrategies, but rather wanted to describe their basic features and how and where  \nthey are applied. For further reading of studies that have assessed the working of  \nthese strategies and instruments, we refer to many of the references used in this \npaper. We conclude with a warning to the reader. Though some of these strategies  \nand  instruments  may  seem  attractive  to  countries  in  which  they  are  missing  or  \nnot  used,  international  transfer  of  policies  and  instruments  is  often  not  without \nproblems. Attention to (differences in) institutional contexts, cultural expectations, legal \nprocedures, and market conditions is essential when considering in one country the \nuse of strategies and instruments that have been successfully applied in another. \n   \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1191  Van der Krabben, Tiwari, and Shukla \n \nREFERENCES \nAdams, D. and Tiesdell, S.

We attempt to provide an overview of the models and tools used for land management by grouping these models and tools, known by different names across disciplines and countries, along a primarily urban or periurban development continuum. The objective is to streamline the discussion on land management strategies on the basis of principles on which models and tools are based rather than their nomenclature.", "Title": "Land Use Management Strategies for Equitable Infrastructure and Urban Development: Overview of Strategies and Tools"}}
