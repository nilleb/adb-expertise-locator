Introduction\nDo countries with a larger \u201cmiddle class\u201d grow faster? A number of economists believe \nthat the answer to this question is in the affirmative. For example, Kharas and Gertz \n(2010) compare the growth experience of Brazil and the Republic of Korea and suggest \nthat the differential performance of the two countries can be explained by differences in \nthe relative sizes of the middle class in the two economies.1 Why should a larger middle \nclass help foster growth? Banerjee and Duflo (2008) identify three arguments that are \ncommonly made. The first argument is that the middle class is where entrepreneurs that \nfoster innovation and growth emerge from. A second argument stresses middle class \n\u201cvalues\u201d that encourage accumulation of human capital and savings. A third argument \nsuggests the consumption power of the middle class leads to diversification and \nexpansion of markets, which allow for the exploitation of economies of scale in production \n(see Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny 1989). In addition to these propositions, the middle \nclass may play a key role in better governance. In comparison to the poor, the middle \nclass may have the ability and power to demand better public service delivery and greater \naccountability from public officials, and support growth-oriented policies (Birdsall et al. \n2000). These arguments suggest that the presence of a strong middle class in a country \nshould have a significant positive influence on economic growth.\nThis paper seeks to examine the role of the middle class in consumption growth in a \ncross-country context. Starting with a structural growth model a la Mankiw, Romer, and \nWeil (1992) and a panel of 72 developing countries covering the period 1985\u20132006, \nwe explore whether the middle class is of direct importance to consumption growth or \nhas a more indirect effect on economic growth through its impact on factor inputs (i.e., \nhuman capital, savings, and labor force growth).2 As we explain in more detail below, the \nmeasure of consumption growth used is growth in mean per capita consumption, which \nis a better reflection of the welfare of the population within a country compared to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita consumption. We also examine which policies and \nenvironmental factors are potentially conducive to middle class development by exploring \nthe characteristics that influence the size and growth of the middle class.\n1  Kharas and Gertz (2010) note that both Brazil and the Republic of Korea achieved middle-income status in the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s. Brazil grew very rapidly from at least 1965 until 1980. By 1980, however, only around \n29% of its population was considered to be middle class and, between 1980 and 1996, its economy stalled. In \ncomparison, the Republic of Korea had 53% of its population considered as middle class in the early 1980s when \nit achieved middle-income status, and its economy continued to grow rapidly over the next decade until it had \nreached high-income status.\n2  Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005, 388) cite North and Thomas\u2019s (1973, 2) argument that factor inputs are \nnot the determinants of growth, they are growth (italics in original). ", "2 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nThe analysis investigates the relationships using three different middle class definitions \nbased on both absolute and relative measures of consumption expenditures. The \nabsolute middle class measure, defined as the share of the population living on $2\u2013$10 \nper person per day (in 2005 purchasing power parity [PPP] dollars), is similar to that in \nBanerjee and Duflo (2008). It assumes that those living on more than $2 per day have \na base amount of consumption that can contribute economically to growth.3 We also \nexamine a relative measure where the middle class is defined as the share of households \nthat have consumption expenditures between 75% to 125% of the median expenditures, \nas in Birdsall et al. (2000). This concept captures the idea that the middle class may be \nimportant not only for its consumption power, but also through its ability to form a political \nor economic action group that demands and implements policies that can contribute to \nmarket-oriented growth. It is related to the theories of the median voter whose support \nis often sought in the financing of productive public investments such as health or \neducation. Finally, we examine a relative measure used by Easterly (2001), which is \ndefined as the expenditure share held by the middle 60% of the expenditure spectrum. \nThis measure is closely linked to the notion of expenditure inequality. To our knowledge, \nthe use of such a diverse set of middle class measures to examine the means through \nwhich the middle class may have importance to economic growth in a cross-country \ncontext is unique.\nWe focus on developing countries for two reasons. First, the definition of middle class \nvaries across developing and developed countries. Income groups defined as middle \nclass in developing countries may belong to the poor class in developed countries. \nFor instance, Ravallion (2009) argues that while people living on $2\u2013$13 per day can \nbe treated as middle class in developing countries, they would be treated as poor by \nUS standards. Second, the growth path and factors that matter to growth in developed \ncountries are expected to differ fundamentally from the growth path and factors \ninfluencing growth in developing economies. Including developed countries in the sample \nmakes sense for growth studies that use data starting from the 1960s, or even the 1970s, \nbut given the timeframe of the available middle class data, developed countries are likely \nto have already reached their steady states, making our growth model less applicable to \nthem.\nOur key finding is that the middle class does have a role to play in driving consumption \ngrowth and that their role works primarily through human capital accumulation. In \nparticular, controlling for initial conditions and other factor inputs, we find a robust, \npositive, and significant relationship between the size of the middle class and economic \ngrowth through higher levels of schooling. This suggests a strong, indirect relationship \nbetween the middle class and growth. There is also evidence that the middle class \ncontributes to higher levels of savings in a country, but savings is estimated to be an \ninsignificant factor in our growth model.\n3  Chen and Ravallion (2010) find that those who are consuming $1.25 per person per day in 2005 PPPs are on the \ndeveloping country poverty line, and represent the set of people who are truly poor and unable to provide for \neven their basic needs.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 3\nOur analysis also shows that the middle class is positively associated with higher \nlevels of urbanization and better democracy, while a larger service sector, ethnic \nfractionalization, and landlocked countries are negatively related to the size of the middle \nclass. Another significant finding is that the size of the government in an economy is \npositively related to the size of the middle class; however, growth in the government\u2019s \nsize hurts the growth of the middle class. If one considers the size of the government \nsector as negatively associated with the size of the private sector, this finding suggests \nthat growth in the size of the private sector helps the growth of the middle class. Some \nimportant results are also found with regard to legal systems. Specifically, the French \nand German legal traditions (compared to the British system) are negatively related to \nthe size and the growth of the middle class, but the exact effect depends on the middle \nclass measure used. Overall, there is evidence to suggest that the middle class is not a \nhomogenous lot, and different segments of the middle class may possess different skills \nand capacities.\nOur paper offers support for the belief that policies that factor in the welfare of the middle \nclass and nurture their growth may be a more effective long-term strategy for alleviating \npoverty compared to policies focusing solely on the poor.4 One reason such policies \nmay be more effective is that growth that includes the middle class is likely to be more \nsustainable, given that more people across different racial and ethnic groups share in the \ngrowth process (Birdsall 2010). A politically and economically strong middle class is more \nlikely to hold a government accountable, which would, in turn, ensure the rule of law, \nprotection of property rights, and continued economic reform. Overall, the core strength of \nour study is to fill an important gap in the cross-country literature regarding the channels \nthrough which the middle class affects economic development and the determinants of its \nsize and growth.\nThe remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the literature \non the middle class. We specifically address the question of how aggregate country-level \ndata can capture the linkages between the middle class and economic growth. Section \nIII describes our econometric methodology, and Section IV describes the measures of \nmiddle class, and sample construction. Section V discusses the empirical findings, while \nSection VI presents robustness checks. Finally, Section VII concludes.\n4  To the extent that middle class growth channels are operative and significant, one can expect countries with a \nlarger middle class to lead to not only faster economic growth, but also faster poverty reduction. This is one of \nRavallion\u2019s (2009) findings, that countries growing faster also experience faster declines in poverty.", "4 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nII. Related Literature\nIncome earners are typically classified into three categories: the poor, the middle class, \nand the rich. The cross-country literature on economic development has traditionally \nfocused on the poor and on poverty (see, among others, Dollar and Kraay 2002, and \nLoayza and Raddatz 20105), while the interest in the middle class and the rich has only \nintensified relatively recently (see, for example, Piketty and Saez 2006, in relation to the \nrich). Each of the categories has a particular link to economic performance, as captured \nby different theories. The disparity, that is, the inequality, between the groups have also \nbeen of long interest to researchers, both theoretically and empirically. A number of \npapers study the determinants of inequality (e.g., the famous Kuznets 1955 hypothesis), \nand inequality\u2019s impact on economic growth yielding mixed empirical evidence.6 However, \nthe evidence generally indicates that there is a strong relationship between inequality and \nincome distribution within a country and a country\u2019s subsequent economic performance \n(Persson and Tabellini 1994) and human and physical capital investments (Galor and \nZeira 1993, Galor and Moav 2004).\nWhile the relationships between different groups within the income distribution are still \nof interest in the literature, one of the first cross-country studies focusing exclusively on \nthe middle class is that of Easterly (2001). Easterly\u2019s work is based on the concept of a \n\u201cmiddle-class consensus\u201d, which is defined as the coexistence of a higher share of middle \nincome groups in the income distribution, and a lower degree of ethnic conflict in the \nsociety. Easterly argues that the lack of a middle class consensus leads to polarization in \nsociety, paving the way for a struggle over resource endowments and ultimately resulting \nin lower broad-based investments in human capital by the \u00e9lite groups who hold the \npower. Easterly refers to 19th century England as having a middle class that facilitated \nindustrialization through political harmony, and concludes that countries with middle class \nconsensus grow faster.\nMore recently, Banerjee and Duflo (2008) have extended the interest in understanding the \nrole of the middle class. Drawing upon the literature at large, Banerjee and Duflo identify \nseveral distinct arguments about why the middle class is important for growth. First, to the \nextent that entrepreneurs typically emerge from the middle class, they generate increases \nin productivity and employment for society (see also Acemoglu and Zilibotti 1997). \nSecond, \u201cmiddle class values\u201d emphasize human capital accumulation and savings, both \nof which are key inputs into economic growth. Third, middle class people not only have \nthe resources to consume more than the poor, but they are also willing to pay a little \nextra for quality. The demand generated by the middle class, thus, feeds into investment \n5  Loayza and Raddatz (2010) find that growth plays a significant and substantial role in poverty alleviation, and that \ncomposition of sectoral growth is an important determinant of how much poverty reduction occurs. On the other \nhand, Birdsall (2010) argues that the focus on the middle class has been limited because of the laser-like focus of \nthe donor community on reducing absolute poverty.\n6  Some additional studies that explore the inequality\u2013growth relationship are Perotti (1996), Barro (2000), Forbes \n(2000), Banerjee and Duflo (2003), and Voitchovsky (2005). Notably, Perotti (1996), among others, uses the share of \nmiddle quintile(s) in income distribution as the inequality measure.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 5\nin production and marketing, and raises economywide income levels, especially by \nallowing the exploitation of economies of scale in production (Murphy, Shleifer, and \nVishny 1989).7\nUsing household surveys from 13 developing countries to distinguish between the \ndifferent channels through which the middle class may promote growth, Banerjee and \nDuflo\u2019s analysis finds little support for the entrepreneurship channel. Instead, they argue \nthat the single most important characteristic of the middle class is that they hold a steady \njob, and that the investment and consumption behavior supported by steady jobs is what \nmay enable the middle class to play a key role in spurring growth.\nFurther arguments can also be advanced for the role of the middle class in economic \ngrowth. It has long been posited that the middle ranks of society emphasize the necessity \nfor policy reform and democratic values. There is perceived to be an almost \u201cnatural\u201d \nlink between being middle class and a citizenship trait that supports good governance, \nelimination of corrupt and rent-seeking activities, public investment in health, education \nand infrastructure, openness, and modernization. The median-voter idea, as it applies to \npolicy determination in the political economy literature, is most likely to be reliant on the \nmiddle class, a factor governments need to consider because of the defining power of \nthis group over the policy outcomes. On the other hand, a stronger middle class is less \nlikely to be associated with factions, civil conflict, and political instability. A stronger middle \nclass should thus lead to a society with extended freedoms; and a political, social, and \neconomic environment that promotes economic growth. Economic growth that is inclusive \nof a larger middle class is also more likely to be sustained, precluding possible collapses \nthat would reverse the gains made.8\nIncreased focus on the middle class has recently resulted in suggestions to shift the \npolicy orientation of some perennial development issues. For instance, middle class-\ncentric approaches are suggested to have a greater impact in driving growth and reducing \npoverty than policies specifically aimed at the impoverished (Birdsall 2007 and 2010). In \nfact, using household survey per capita consumption growth models, Ravallion (2009) \nfinds that the size of the middle class, measured in absolute terms, has an important \nconnection to growth and poverty reduction.9 With projections by Bussolo, De Hoyos, and \n7  People above poverty can demand a more diverse set of goods (above subsistence). They also have more \nresources to save and invest relative to the poor. Once they reach a critical size, they may be instrumental in \ngenerating both the demand as well as the resources required, for moving developing countries from traditional \n(low productivity/wages) to modern (high productivity/wages) production structures. A useful formalization of this \nbasic insight is provided by Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989) who emphasize that as domestic markets become \nlarger, increasing returns for production technologies that are unprofitable with smaller market size become \nprofitable. Crucially, the emergence of a middle class is intimately related to an increase in domestic markets. \nAccording to Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1989, 546), the middle class are natural consumers of manufactured \ngoods.\n8  Hausman, Pritchett, and Rodrik (2005) find that countries experience growth accelerations followed by growth \ncollapses, and show that economic reform is a significant predictor of sustained growth.\n9  Ravallion finds that initial inequality retards growth only if there is a high incidence of poverty, but has little \nimplications for the nonpoor who are those consuming above $2 per day in 2005 PPP $s (i.e., the middle class). ", "6 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nMedvedev (2009); Kharas and Gertz (2010); and Kharas (2010), which project a large \nrise in middle class consumers over the next few decades, it is expected that the middle \nclass will play an ever-increasing and relevant role in development planning.\nThis paper contributes to a small but growing body of literature on the role of the middle \nclass in economic development. We adopt a structural growth model to examine the \ndirect and indirect (i.e., factor input) effects associated with the size of the middle class, \nas measured in both absolute and relative terms. While we do not directly test any \nparticular theory, our results shed significant light on some of the mechanisms mentioned \nabove, and how important the middle class is for economic development. This study \nmakes a significant contribution to the literature as no study to date has studied in detail \nhow the middle class drives growth in developing countries and through which channels. \nWe also investigate the economic and institutional factors that are potentially conducive to \nthe growth of the middle class, and what factors are essential to foster its development.\nIII.  Econometric Specification and Methodology\nOur analysis of the relationship between consumption growth and the size of the middle \nclass is based on a general empirical formulation of the augmented Solow growth model, \nwhere growth is determined by investment in human capital, savings, and labor force \ngrowth. This model is derived from a Cobb-Douglas production function Y = AF(K,H,N), \nwhere Y is output, K is physical capital stock, H is human capital, N is labor force, and A \ncaptures total factor productivity (TFP) and other factors such as investment climate and \ninstitutional characteristics, among others. We follow the approach of Mankiw, Romer, and \nWeil (1992) and Islam (1995), who provide a basis for estimating specifications according \nto the Solow model using a panel of cross-country data, to examine whether after \ncontrolling for the key factor inputs the middle class has an added effect in the model.10 \nWe further examine whether the middle class may have an indirect impact on economic \ngrowth through its effects on factor inputs, that is, by driving investment in human capital, \nsavings, and labor force growth.\nNext, on the assumption that the middle class contribute importantly to economic growth, \nwe examine which institutional and economic factors are potentially conducive to creating \na larger middle class. This analysis provides insights on the ways to foster middle class \nThe relationship between per capita income, wealth, and income distribution for a large set of countries is \ninvestigated by Solimano (2009). This study finds that growth is in favor of the lower middle class. However, as it \nrelies on simple correlations, this study sheds little light on the mechanisms through which the middle class has \nan impact on an economy.\n10 One modification that we make to the Solow growth model is to use per capita consumption growth instead of \noutput growth, in line with middle class measures available from household surveys. Likewise, savings replaces \nphysical capital investment in the model.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 7\ndevelopment by examining both the levels and the growth of the middle class as a \nfunction of various country characteristics.\nOur model regresses the dependent variables on lagged explanatory variables to better \ncapture the actual contribution of these variables to the observed levels of outcomes, \nrather than simply capturing the correlations.\nWe first start with a growth model. As there are compelling findings in the literature on the \nnonlinear relationship between variables that capture the profile of the income distribution \nand economic growth (Banerjee and Duflo 2003, Chen 2003, Voitchovsky 2005), we \ninclude a quadratic term for the middle class in various formulations of our model. \nSpecifically, we estimate growth models of the following form:\n\u2206lnC\ni,t =\u03b1+\u03b2lnC +\u03bblnH +\u03b4lnS +\u03c8lnN +\u03d5lnMC +\u03d5 lnMC2 +\u00b5 +\u03b5 (1)\nr i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r 1 i,,t\u2212r 2 i,t\u2212r i i,t\nwhere variables vary by country i, at time, t, and r represents the number of years \nbetween the current household survey and the household survey just prior to the \ncurrent household survey in our panel, H represents human capital, S savings, N labor \nforce growth,11 MC middle class measure, m country fixed effects, and \u03b5 the error term. \nSince we are using an unbalanced panel, the dependent variable, \u2206ln C/r represents \nthe average log per capita yearly growth rate between time t and t\u2013r. The logged \nspecification, which follows from Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992), captures the move \ntoward the steady state. Even though we estimate a structural growth model derived from \nformal theory, the fixed effects treatment limits the bias arising from omitted variables that \nare not captured by equation (1).\nOur parameters of interest are \u03c6  and \u03c6 , representing the direct effect of the middle \n1 2\nclass on growth. In the specifications where we use an absolute measure for the middle \nclass, we also include as a further control the size of the upper class. This allows \nus to better differentiate between a story where the total magnitude of consumption \nexpenditures leads to greater economic growth, versus one where the density or size of \na particular consumption expenditure bracket (for example, middle class versus upper \nclass) is what matters for economic growth.\nTo examine whether the middle class has an indirect effect on economic growth through \nfactor inputs I, we estimate human capital, savings, or labor force growth equations using \nthe following general form:12\n11 This variable is actually n + g + d, where n is labor force growth rate, with g + d being technology growth and \ndepreciation rate, jointly capped at 0.07, as standard in the literature.\n12 From this point on, we choose to perform the regressions without logs, unless noted otherwise, since the \nnonlogged relationship more closely approximates the normal distribution curve than the logged version. The \ninitial consumption variable is used in logs as part of the standard practice in the literature (logging such level \nvariables also addresses the heteroskedasticity problem).", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nI =\u03b7+\u03b3lnC +\u03beX +\u03b6MC +\u03b6 MC2 +\u00b5 +\u03c5    (2)\ni,t i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r 1 i,t\u2212r 2 i,t\u2212r i i,t\nIn addition to the middle class measures, we include a vector of controls, X  and log \ni,t-r\nper capita consumption, all in lags. Specifically, the controls commonly used in our factor \ninput models are urbanization, trade share in GDP, democracy, the share of services \nrelative to agriculture in GDP, and the share of industry relative to agriculture in GDP. \nThese variables capture important dimensions of the development process, as well as \nthe factors that are important to factor accumulation within a country. For instance, it is \ngenerally accepted that urbanization, trade openness, political freedom, and sectoral \ngrowth are associated with considerable factor rewards such as higher wages, profits, \nand rents, leading to higher levels of factor inputs.13 We also include additional controls \nthat may cause significant variability in the observed levels of factor inputs. In particular, \nfor human capital, proxied by the average level of schooling, we control for the share of \npublic spending on education as a share of GDP. For savings, we include the number of \nassassinations and riots as measures of political instability, log population (to proxy for \nthe size of the domesitic market), the share of population above 65, and the log price of \ninvestment. For labor force input, we include gender-specific measures of primary and \nsecondary schooling (see Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004).\nTo examine the factors that affect the size and the growth in the middle class, we use \nvariants of the following specifications:\nMC =\u03ba+\u03b8lnC +\u03c2Z +\u00b5 +u   (3)\nit i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r i it\n\u2206lnMC =\u03d1+\u03c7lnC +\u03c1\u2206lnZ +\u00b5 +\u03c3   (4)\nit i,t\u2212r i,t\u2212r i it\nIn these equations, Z  is a vector of variables generally argued to affect the size of the \ni,t-r\nmiddle class, and includes urbanization, trade share in GDP, democracy, the share of \nservices relative to agriculture in GDP, and the share of industry relative to agriculture \nin GDP, as well as log population, fertility, and government share in GDP. We include \nthe population variable to proxy for the size of the domestic market, as in Murphy et \nal. (1989), as it can capture the extent to which middle class activities may be able to \nexpand. Fertility is included as it is another important factor that is suggested to be \nrelated to middle class development. For example, Banerjee and Duflo (2008) find that \nthe middle class tends to have fewer children. As more children imply greater health, \neducation, and subsistence expenditures for families and, thus, fewer resources per \nperson, fertility may serve as a major constraint to middle class development. Finally, \ngovernment size can proxy the level of public investments that can support middle \nclass activities (Birdsall et al. 2000). Nevertheless, too big a government can erode the \neconomic freedom of the middle class through higher taxes and hamper its development.\n13 These effects can work jointly with, or independent of, the size of the middle class. This means the formulation \nin equation (2) captures the effects that are independent of the middle class. The relationship between these \nvariables and the middle class is explored in the next formulation.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 9\nMany time-invariant country characteristics such as ethnic fractionalization, religion, and \ntype of legal system, for instance, may also play significant roles in determining the size \nand growth of the middle class. The panel fixed effects treatment eliminates the time-\ninvariant factors from the models, in which case it is not possible to explicitly identify \nwhich time-invariant factors matter. Following Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared\u2019s \n(2009) approach, we recover the fixed-effect coefficient for each country from equations \n(3) and (4), and subsequently find their relationships with several time-invariant country \ncharacteristics using the following regression specification:\n\u00b5 =a+bW +\u03bd   (5)\ni i i\nwhere W is a vector of time-invariant country characteristics including ethnic \nfractionalization, a landlocked dummy, the French legal system, the German legal system \n(the British legal system is the base),14 the share of Protestant, Catholic, and Muslim \npeople in the population (other religions is the base); regional dummies including Latin \nAmerica, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, and Eastern \nand Central Europe (South Asia is the base); and transition economies. Our interest in \nexamining the role of ethnic fractionalization follows from Easterly (2001) who suggests \nthat ethnic fractionalization can impede the growth of the middle class. In addition, the \nliterature has shown that legal systems are the overarching structures determining several \nfinance-related arrangements, such as lending and borrowing, as well as the state\u2019s \nattitude toward economic activity. For instance, the German legal system is strict but \nefficient in credit allocation, while the British legal system is more protective of investors \nand supports \u201cunconditioned private contracts\u201d. Alternatively, the French legal tradition \nextends the power of the state into the markets, supporting \u201csocially-conditioned private \ncontracts\u201d (see La Porta et al. 1998, 1999, 2008). We therefore consider whether these \nlegal structures play any role in development of the middle class. Furthermore, different \nreligions may prescribe different values and actions for economic undertakings which, \nultimately, affect the size of the middle class. For example, the role of Protestantism \nis mentioned widely in the Weberian context. Finally, as regional factors and socialist \nheritage may affect the size of the different income classes in transition economies, they \nare included as further variables. These regressions provide important insights about the \ninstitutional and environmental factors that shape the size and growth of the middle class, \nwhich can help in understanding and forming more effective policy tools.\n14 La Porta et al. (2008) update their data, categorizing the former socialist countries into French or German legal \nsystems.", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nIV.  Data\nInvestigating the various channels through which the middle class has an impact on \neconomic growth, and the factors that may influence its size and growth, entails using \ndata from a variety of sources.\nA.   Measuring the Size of the Middle Class\nDefining the group of individuals comprising the middle class is far from easy, and \nencompasses a complex set of characteristics related to occupations, educational levels, \nearnings, and values. For example, Merriam Webster defines the middle class as follows:\na class occupying a position between the upper-class and the lower-class \n... a fluid heterogeneous socioeconomic grouping composed principally \nof business and professional people, bureaucrats, and some farmers and \nskilled workers sharing common social characteristics and values.\nEven if we restrict our attention to purely economic definitions based on income or \nexpenditure, there is little consensus on how to define the middle class. Past studies \nhave varied in using relative and absolute measures. Moreover, even within the class of \nabsolute measures, there is little agreement on what the appropriate thresholds should \nbe for differentiating between different classes. For example, Ravallion (2010) defines the \nmiddle class in developing countries as households with expenditures between $2 and \n$13 per person (in 2005 consumption PPP dollars). The lower cut-off of $2 represents \nthe median value of the national poverty line from a sample of 70 developing countries, \nwhile the upper cut-off of $13 represents the US poverty line in 2005 PPPs. Ravallion \nargues that these bounds can be thought of as encompassing those who are not deemed \npoor by the standards of developing countries, but are still poor by the standards of rich \ncountries. In contrast, Kharas and Gertz (2010)15 use thresholds of $10 and $100 per \nperson to define the middle class, while Milanovic and Yitzhaki (2002) define the middle \nclass as those living between the mean incomes of Brazil and Italy, which is roughly \nbetween $10 to $20 per day in 2005 PPPs. This definition is also used by Bussolo et \nal. (2007) and Bussolo et al. (2009). Banerjee and Duflo (2008) base their analysis on a \ndefinition of the middle class as individuals living on $2 to $10 per day.\nStill others rely on relative measures of middle class in an attempt to draw a closer \nconnection between political consensus and inequality. A common approach is to define \nthe middle class as those falling between 75% to 125% of the median income, as in \nThurow (1987) for the United States and Birdsall et al. (2000) for developing countries. \nOn the other hand, Easterly (2001) uses the expenditure/income share of the middle 60% \nas a measure of the middle class. Given there is a correlation of 0.90 between the middle \n15 Note that Kharas and Gertz (2010) substitute consumption levels obtained from household expenditure survey \ndata with national accounts data.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 11\n60% of the income distribution with the Gini coefficient, this middle class measure is very \nsimilar to a measure of inequality.\nWe do not attempt to debate the merits of using different measures and cut-offs for the \nmiddle class, but argue that between absolute and relative measures there is reason to \nexamine both in our analysis, as they relate to different reasons why the middle class is \nimportant for economic growth. Thus, we focus on three sets of middle class definitions: \n(i) an absolute measure, referred to as MC ($2\u2013$10), representing the share of the \npopulation living on $2\u2013$10 per day in 2005 PPP dollars; (ii) a relative measure, referred \nto as MC middle 60%, representing the share of the total consumption expenditure \naccruing to the middle 60% of the expenditure distribution; and (iii) a relative measure, \nMC median, representing the share of population that has expenditures at least above $2 \nper day and within 0.75%\u20131.25% of the median expenditure of the country.16 When using \nMC ($2\u2013$10), we include a measure for the upper class, HC ($10+), as a control and \ndiscuss the findings related to this class, where necessary.\nThe main data source for constructing the middle class measures at the country level \nis the World Bank\u2019s PovcalNet database (World Bank 2011a) of tabulated per capita \nconsumption distribution and mean per capita consumption based on an extensive set of \nhousehold surveys. The survey means are ultimately reported in 2005 PPP dollars.17 The \nuse of these data allows us to focus on per capita consumption growth that may better \ncapture the actual welfare of individuals and the middle class\u2019s ability to play a role in \nthe growth process, rather than the level of development as generally measured through \nnational account GDP per capita consumption measures.\nB.   Sample Construction\nThe full set of countries is listed in the Appendix, with the sizes of the various groups \naccording to each definition of middle class, in the first year of data available in our \nsample. We construct our sample by connecting our middle class measures with data \nfrom a variety of other sources. We use a measure of human capital as proxied by \naverage years of schooling from Barro and Lee (2010), saving as percentage of GDP \nfrom the World Development Indicators (World Bank 2011b), and labor force growth \nbased on Penn World Tables database 6.3 developed by the International Comparison \nProgram. Summary statistics and originating sources for each of the variables used in our \nempirical specifications are provided in Table 1.\nWe create two different sets of data for our analysis. The first data set is an unbalanced \npanel\u2014unbalanced purely due to survey availability in the relevant country\u2014where the \nlength of time between the two surveys can differ from year to year and from country to \n16 In actuality, we further specify that if the median income is below $2 per day then the middle class is captured as \nthose falling between $2 and $2.25 per day.\n17 This allows constructing the entire distribution based on Lorenz curve parameterizations, as detailed in Datt (1998) \nand ADB (2009).", "12 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\ncountry. As it is based on actual household survey data, it provides expenditure growth \nrates without having to make strong assumptions regarding the trajectory of growth for \nnonsurvey years. The second data set is a balanced panel constructed to represent \nshort-term growth rates in per capita consumption means using straight-line interpolation \nbetween survey data. The assumptions and the data underlying the construction of these \nmiddle class measures are further detailed in Chun (2010). This data set is used mainly \nas a robustness check. The unbalanced panel is the primary basis for the reported \ntables and subsequent discussion, as we expect this sample to more accurately capture \nthe impact of the middle class on outcomes and factors affecting the size of the middle \nclass.18\nTable 1 presents the basic statistics of the variables used in our analysis based on \nthe unbalanced panel. The average yearly growth of the log household per capita \nconsumption, based on the household survey mean, is 1.6%. The minimum and \nmaximum values of this variable, as well as its standard deviation, indicate a high degree \nof variance in the measure. Table 2 displays the correlations between the key variables \nin the unbalanced panel. The correlation between log change in per capita consumption \nmean and per capita consumption mean is negative (\u20130.21) as expected. On the other \nhand, MC ($2\u2013$10) and the MC median measure are highly and positively correlated with \neach other (0.76). We can see that the different middle class measures are substantially \ndifferent as the correlation between MC ($2\u2013$10) and the MC middle 60% is only 0.14, \nwhile the correlation between the MC median and MC middle 60% is 0.48. All these point \nto a highly skewed consumption distribution, where the median income is probably among \nthose who live on $2\u2013$10, and the middle 60% has much higher consumption levels than \nthose who live on $2\u2013$10 and, to some extent, than those around the median income. \nThis table also displays interesting features regarding the correlation between the middle \nclass measures and the factor inputs. Schooling has high correlations with MC ($2\u2013$10) \nand MC median (0.54 and 0.63, respectively), whereas its correlation with the MC middle \n60% is only 0.27. The same pattern is observed with savings, but with lower levels of \ncorrelation. Labor force growth is negatively correlated with all middle class measures, \nwith the correlation ranging between \u20130.20 and \u20130.41. In terms of the conjectured \ndeterminants of the middle class, correlations vary across a wide range, but MC middle \n60% exhibits comparatively lower correlations with the trade, urbanization, sectoral shares \nand population. Finally, the correlation among the variables that are thought to determine \nthe size of the middle class is not high, with the exception of fertility and agricultural value \nadded (the latter is used in combination with industry, and services value added as the \ndenominator), suggesting that the inclusion of most of these variables in the estimation \nprocess is capturing unique aspects of a country\u2019s institutional, economic, and cultural \nmakeup and, thus, will not create issues in estimation due to multicollinearity.\n18 In both data sets, we utilize the period after 1985 because surveys for years prior to this date are sparse.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 13\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\nVariables Source Mean Max.

Empirical Results\nA.   Does the Middle Class Have a Direct Effect on per Capita  \n  Consumption Growth?\nTable 3 presents the results of our growth regressions. Consistent with the convergence \nhypothesis that countries with higher inital income grow more slowly, we find the expected \nnegative sign for initial per capita consumption, which is highly significant across almost \nall specifications. Schooling is also positive and highly significant, reflecting the strong \nrelationship between higher levels of human capital and consumption growth. While the \nsavings variable is positively correlated with higher growth, it is statistically insignificant in \nall models. This is potentially due to the inability of the national accounts savings variable \nto sufficiently capture the relationship between savings and per capita consumption \ngrowth that is based on household survey data. Alternatively, it may simply reflect that \nin developing countries, savings is not efficiently converted into capital investment that \nleads to higher consumption growth. The coefficient on labor force growth, n + g + d, \nhas a negative relationship with consumption growth, as predicted by the Solow model, \nbut is insignificant in all specifications. The negative coefficient estimate captures the \nfact that, in the steady state, a rapidly growing labor force tends to slow down per capita \nconsumption growth due to the need for a greater amount of resources to be dedicated \nto support the new entrants into the labor force. Given the amounts of physical capital \nand human capital available in the economy, higher labor force growth results in less \nresources per person. However, the insignificant coefficient estimate in all specifications \nsuggests that, in developing countries, labor force growth is not a significant factor \nconstraining per capita consumption growth.\nAfter controlling for these primary inputs, we find that the coefficient estimate on the \nabsolute measure of MC ($2\u2013$10) is insignificant, indicating that there is no added effect \non growth from a larger portion of the population having more than some threshold \namount of consumption. On the other hand, we find that MC middle 60% has a nonlinear \nrelationship with growth. Given the coefficient estimates we obtain, the effect of an \nincrease in MC middle 60% on growth is always positive in our sample. Finally, the \nmedian measure as captured by those between 0.75%\u20131.25% of the median income is \nestimated to be insignificant.", "16 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nTable 3: Growth Regressions\u2014Linear and Nonlinear Specifications\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nVariables Linear Specification for MC\nInitial Mean Consumption -0.181*** -0.232*** -0.240*** -0.201*** -0.254*** -0.251***\n(-3.030) (-8.441) (-7.664) (-3.209) (-8.609) (-7.514)\nMC $2\u2013$10 2005 PPP  -0.000390 -0.0268\n(-0.0144) (-0.971)\nMC $2\u2013$10 2005 PPP Squared\nUpper Class $10+ 2005 PPP  -0.0217 -0.0211\n(-0.955) (-0.860)\nUpper Class $10+ 2005 PPP Squared\nMiddle 60% Income Share (Easterly) -0.0246 -0.0753\n(-0.214) (-0.609)\nMiddle 60% Income Share (Easterly) \nSquared\nMC 75%\u2013125% of the Median 0.0175 -0.000705\n(0.538) (-0.0208)\nMC 75%\u2013125% of the Median Squared\nAverage Years of Schooling 0.256*** 0.249*** 0.246***\n(4.083) (4.021) (3.975)\nSavings 0.0184 0.0208 0.0208\n(1.020) (1.163) (1.165)\nLabor Force Participation -0.0226 -0.0202 -0.0205\n(-1.210) (-1.080) (-1.096)\nConstant 0.965*** 1.281** 1.157*** 0.597* 1.009* 0.704***\n(3.298) (2.555) (7.674) (1.919) (1.872) (3.659)\nObservations 287 285 287 268 266 268\nAdjusted R-squared 0.131 0.134 0.133 0.179 0.179 0.175\nNumber of countries 72 72 72 70 69 70\n(7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12)\nVariables Nonlinear Specification for MC\nInitial Mean Consumption -0.156 -0.241*** -0.242*** -0.213* -0.254*** -0.252***\n(-1.457) (-8.899) (-7.712) (-1.894) (-8.663) (-7.511)\nMC $2\u2013$10 2005 PPP  0.216 0.171\n(1.028) (0.803)\nMC $2\u2013$10 2005 PPP Squared -0.0351 -0.0302\n(-1.157) (-0.977)\nUpper Class $10+ 2005 PPP  -0.0214 -0.0160\n(-0.818) (-0.560)\nUpper Class $10+ 2005 PPP Squared -0.00438 -0.00134\n(-0.613) (-0.182)\nMiddle 60% Income Share (Easterly) 12.18*** 7.234*\n(3.245) (1.727)\nMiddle 60% Income Share (Easterly)  -1.623*** -0.972*\nSquared\n(-3.253) (-1.746)\ncontinued.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 17\nTable 3: continued.\n(7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12)\nVariables Nonlinear Specification for MC\n(1.215) (0.480)\nMC 75%\u2013125% of the Median Squared -0.0293 -0.0133\n(-1.118) (-0.501)\nAverage Years of Schooling 0.255*** 0.205*** 0.242***\n(4.053) (3.079) (3.867)\nSavings 0.0190 0.0225 0.0205\n(1.049) (1.264) (1.145)\nLabor Force Participation -0.0224 -0.0181 -0.0206\n(-1.198) (-0.970) (-1.100)\nConstant 0.593 -21.57*** 1.027*** 0.372 -12.59 0.655***\n(1.395) (-3.063) (5.384) (0.854) (-1.613) (3.026)\nObservations 287 285 287 268 266 268\nAdjusted R-squared 0.130 0.171 0.134 0.175 0.188 0.172\nNumber of countries 72 72 72 70 69 70\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. \nMC = middle class, PPP = purchasing power parity.\nNote:  t-statistics in parentheses. All variables in natural logs.\nSource:  Authors\u2018 estimates using data from Table 1.\nIt is possible to interpret the middle class in the growth regressions (i.e., the direct \neffect) as the TFP effect. The estimated growth model is derived from a Cobb-Douglas \nproduction function Y = AF(K, H, N) where there are two sources of growth: (i) growth \nin factor inputs K, H, and N; and (ii) growth in TFP represented by A. This implies that \nholding factor inputs constant, any increase in Y will be due to an increase in TFP. \nTherefore, in our regression model, holding the factor inputs constant (and eliminating \ntime-invariant country-specific effects), the middle class variable is likely to capture the \neffect associated with TFP. Given that the MC middle 60% variable was to have a positive \nand significant effect with consumption growth, this structural interpretation suggests that \nproductivity could be higher when a greater share of total consumption is captured by the \nmiddle 60% of the consumption distribution. \nB.   Does the Middle Class Have an Effect on Factor Inputs?\nWhile there is some evidence that the middle class has a direct effect on per capita \nconsumption growth, it is possible that the middle class mainly affects economic growth \nindirectly through its impact on the levels of factor inputs. This subsection examines the \nrelationship between middle class measures and human capital, savings, and labor force \ngrowth.\n1.

Labor Force Growth\nTable 6 shows that all middle class measures are significantly related to labor force \ngrowth after including the controls. However, our absolute measure MC ($2\u2013$10) is \npositively and linearly related, while the relative measures MC middle 60% and MC \nmedian are negatively and nonlinearly associated with labor force growth. Positive \n(negative) sign implies that growth of labor force participation is increasing (decreasing) \nin the size of the middle class in developing countries. These contrasting signs are \ninteresting. Based on the Solow model, this suggests that the costs required to endow \nthe labor force with more resources are lower for those who live on $2\u2013$10 per day and ", "24 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nfacilitate higher growth in labor force participation, while for those who hold the middle \n60% and those who are around the median in the expenditure spectrum have higher \ncosts, which decrease over the range of reasonable values, suggesting a lower growth \nrate in labor force. The factor underlying these signs could be the skill levels associated \nwith each group. That is, those who are just above the subsistence consumption level \nare likely to hold more basic skills, which are less expensive to augment and which can \noperate with the existing factor inputs with no extra training. Others hold more specific \nskills so that they need to bear more costs for training that will enable them to use the \nfactor inputs associated with their specific skills. Differential skill levels would also indicate \nthat the MC measures capture different parts of the expenditure spectrum. Further, given \nall these, our results might also point to differential skill levels corresponding to a life that \nis just above subsistence consumption versus ability to organize around a consensus, \nwhich would, in turn, be able to attract concessions from the government for greater \ngroup welfare.19\nThe inclusion of the various other controls shows that the sign on the initial consumption \nmean is not consistent across the MC measures, nor is it significant. Among the controls, \nonly urbanization is significant but with a negative sign. This can again be explained with \nspecificity of the skills associated with economic activities and sectoral diversity in the \nurban sector, and the concurrent costs of improving the skills. No other control variables \nare significant in explaining the labor force growth in developing countries.20\nTable 7 summarizes the middle class\u2013related results. We find some evidence that the \nmiddle class influences directly per capita consumption growth; however, we find stronger \nevidence that a larger middle class is associated with greater factor accumulation in \nterms of higher levels of schooling and savings. The middle class contribution to the labor \nforce seems to depend on the skill levels captured by the measure. Given that human \ncapital is the only input factor that has a robust, positive, and significant relationship \nwith consumption growth, we conclude that it is mainly through this channel that the \nmiddle class has an impact on consumption growth. This also suggests that the following \naspects, namely, a larger portion of the population having a minimum threshold level \nof consumption, represented by our absolute measure; a more equal distribution of \nconsumption across the population as captured by the middle 60% measure; and having \npolitical and social consensus for policies supportive of the middle class, represented \nby the relative median measure, are all important as to why the middle class matters to \nhuman capital investment and subsequent consumption growth.\n19 It should be noted that had the negative relationship between labor force growth and per capita consumption \ngrowth been significant in the estimates of equation (1), a larger middle class could have potentially been growth-\nenhancing through lower labor force growth.\n20 In fact, higher levels of trade openness, greater democracy, and a higher industry share relative to agriculture \nall have negative signs but their significance levels are just outside the conventional limits. All these signs are \nconsistent with the skill specificity and cost explanation for respective variables.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 25\nTable 7: Summary of Robust Effects (after controls)\nGrowth Schooling Savings Labor Force\nMiddle Class  None Linear positive Nonlinear positive: Linear positive\n($2\u2013$10) increasing at a \ndecreasing rate\nUpper Class ($10+)  None Linear positive None Nonlinear positive:\nincreasing at a \ndecreasing rate\nMiddle 60%  Nonlinear positive: Nonlinear positive: None Nonlinear negative: \n(Easterly) increasing at a  increasing at a  decreasing at a \ndecreasing rate decreasing rate decreasing rate\n0.75%\u20131.25%  None Linear positive Nonlinear positive: Nonlinear negative:  \nAround Median  increasing at a  decreasing at a \ndecreasing rate decreasing rate\nSource:  Authors\u2018 estimates.\nC.   What Factors Affect the Size of the Middle Class?\nWe now examine what factors can contribute to a larger middle class and what factors \ncontribute to its growth. In our preliminary analysis, we find that initial consumption mean \nhas a nonlinear relationship with the size of the middle class, and therefore, we include a \nquadratic term for initial consumption in our formulation.\n1.  Absolute Measure\u2014MC $2\u2013$10\nTable 8a presents factors that are robustly associated with a larger middle class. Initial \nconsumption mean is positively related with the absolute measure with an effect that \nincreases at a decreasing rate. Further, higher levels of urbanization, a more democratic \ngovernment, and higher government share in GDP are all associated with a larger \nmiddle class (Models 1 and 2). This is consistent with findings that urban centers offer \nconsiderable positive spillovers and allow particular sectoral growth and production to \ntake place, resulting in stable employment productivity (Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr 2007). \nAlso, democratic regimes are associated with increased civil liberties, rule of law, as \nwell as greater political stability. Given that the middle class captured by this definition is \nlikely to be involved with relatively small economic activities, making them vulnerable to \nshocks and volatility, a stable political environment seems to provide the basic conditions \nfor a larger middle class size. A big government is associated with a larger middle class, \nconsistent greater provision of public investments such as health and education, and \nsteady jobs and earnings that state-owned enterprises provide (Birdsall et al. 2000). By \ncontrast, a higher share of services relative to agriculture is estimated to be negatively \nassociated with the size of the middle class. Our further regressions (unreported) show \nthat services share relative to agriculture is related to a larger upper class (those who \nlive on $10+ per day). Finally, fertility is negatively associated with the size of the middle \nclass, but is not statistically significant.21\n21 Fertility is negative and significant when the quadratic term of the initial consumption mean is not included in \nthe model. This seems to suggest that higher fertility becomes detrimental for the middle class at higher levels ", "26 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nTable 8a: Determinants of the Size of the Middle Class\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nMC ($2\u2013$10) Middle 60% 0.75%\u20131.125%  \naround Median\nLog Initial Mean Cons. 97.93*** 90.34*** -8.811* -9.907** 13.15* 12.30\n(5.570) (4.995) (-1.817) (-2.003) (1.719) (1.550)\nLog Initial Mean Cons.  -10.19*** -9.418*** 0.960** 1.055** -1.073 -0.980\nSquared\n(-5.798) (-5.196) (1.982) (2.129) (-1.403) (-1.232)\nTrade-to-GDP Ratio -0.00161 -0.000618 -0.000597 0.00381 0.0112 0.0106\n(-0.0437) (-0.0164) (-0.0588) (0.369) (0.698) (0.641)\nUrbanization 59.64*** 62.41** 3.053 11.22 18.57** 20.94\n(2.769) (2.024) (0.514) (1.330) (1.982) (1.548)\nDemocracy Index 1.519*** 1.459*** 0.0448 0.0571 0.216* 0.209\n(5.120) (4.812) (0.548) (0.689) (1.675) (1.572)\nServices/Agriculture Value  -0.698** -0.748** -0.167* -0.146 -0.492*** -0.507***\nAdded\n(-2.059) (-2.143) (-1.784) (-1.531) (-3.333) (-3.310)\nIndustry/Agriculture  0.229 0.567 0.250 0.348* 0.400 0.452\nValue Added\n(0.313) (0.746) (1.237) (1.676) (1.256) (1.355)\nLog Population -6.631 -1.207 -2.381\n(-0.608) (-0.404) (-0.498)\nFertility Rate -1.649 0.470 -0.406\n(-0.737) (0.768) (-0.414)\nGovernment Size 0.307* 0.0981** 0.0218\n(1.795) (2.098) (0.291)\nConstant -212.1*** -132.6 63.56*** 69.77** -26.08 -1.499\n(-4.920) (-1.146) (5.345) (2.208) (-1.390) (-0.0295)\nObservations 281 281 279 279 281 281\nNumber of Countries 71 71 70 70 71 71\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nCons = consumption, GDP = gross domestic product, MC = middle class.\nNote:  t-statistics in parentheses.\nSource:  Authors\u2018 estimates.\nThe time-invariant country characteristics offer additional insights on the determinants of \nthe MC ($2\u2013$10), as seen in Table 8b (Models 1 and 2). Lower levels of ethnic diversity \n(as captured by a measure developed by Desmet, Ortuno-Ortin, and Wacziarg 2009) \nare associated with a larger middle class. This is consistent with the theory and findings \nof Easterly (2001). In fact, our finding suggests that the coexistence of the middle class \nand ethnic concentration is not a random outcome, but that the latter shapes the former, \nhelping the formation of political consensus in the Easterly (2001) sense. On the other \nhand, countries that are based on the German legal system and, to some extent, the \nFrench legal structure are at a disadvantage in terms of the size of the middle class. \nof development. On another note, log population, which proxies the size of domestic markets, is positive and \nsignificant when fertility and urbanization are removed from the model. This suggests that urban areas and bigger \nfamilies already provide the middle class with larger domestic markets, so that the explanatory power of the proxy \nis washed out if the relevant variables are included in the model.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 27\nGerman legal tradition, characterized by strict credit policies, may be denying this group \naccess to sufficient credit opportunities.22 In addition, La Porta et al. (1999) establish that \nthe French legal heritage is associated with lower public employment, lower infrastructure \nquality, higher top tax rates, less secure property rights, and worse regulation. Thus, \nthese factors seem to be hampering middle class activities. Landlocked countries have \na smaller middle class as these countries tend to lack the benefits of sea access and \nsuffer from geographical disadvantages such as mountainous terrain, big steppes, and \ndesert plains.23 After taking into account time-varying economic indicators and other time-\ninvariant country characteristics, landlocked countries have, on average, a 19% smaller \nabsolute middle class than countries with sea access. Also, a larger Catholic population \nseems to be associated with a lower proportion of the population living on $2\u2013$10.\n2. Relative Measure\u2014MC Middle 60%\nThe factors contributing to a larger share of expenditures held by the MC middle 60% \nare shown in Table 8a (Models 3 and 4). In terms of economic indicators, only initial \nconsumption mean, the GDP share of industry relative to agriculture, and government \nsize seem to matter for the MC middle 60%. Initial consumption is negatively related \nwith the share of MC middle 60%, but the effect is declining at a decreasing rate. Given \nthat MC middle 60% is close to the notion of equality in the society, this result points out \nto a Kuznets (1955)-type nonlinear relationship between the level of development and \ninequality. Further, a larger share of industry GDP relative to agriculture leads to a larger \nshare of MC middle 60%. This is consistent with the notion that industry creates relatively \nbetter employment and earning opportunities for people in the middle class. As found \nabove, a big government provision seems to suggest a large middle class size.\nThe effects of time-invariant country characteristics on the size of the middle 60% \nare displayed in Table 8b (Models 3 and 4). We find some evidence that regional \ncharacteristics matter. Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have a significantly lower \nshare of the MC middle 60% that is unexplained by other country characteristics and \neconomic indicators, in comparison to South Asia. Again, given the relationship between \nMC middle 60% and equality, a lower share in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa \nis not surprising. Other regions appear to be no different from South Asia. Finally, the \nnegative impact of being landlocked emerges as a significant factor influencing the size of \nthe middle class.\n22 In line with La Porta et al. (2008), countries with a German legal system in our sample are Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nMongolia, Poland, and Slovenia, which constitute 11% of our sample. Because we hold the \u201ctransition\u201d effect \nconstant in the models, the legal system effect found here should not be driven by former socialist heritage. In \nfact, a number of former socialist countries now follow the French legal tradition.\n23 Landlocked countries in our sample include mountainous countries such as Armenia, Bolivia, Nepal, and the \nKyrgyz Republic; countries located on large steppes, such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia; and some African countries \nwith desert plains and sand dunes.", "28 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nTable 8b: Relationship between Middle Class Size and Time-Invariant Country \nCharacteristics\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nDependent Variable: Fixed Effects Coefficients  \nfrom the Corresponding Models Above\nEthnic Fractionalization 6.270 15.20** 2.498 3.622 1.421 4.608*\n(1.139) (2.384) (1.261) (1.563) (0.571) (1.771)\nLatin America and the  31.17*** 12.64 -3.483 -7.986** 4.993 -1.450\nCaribbean\n(3.692) (1.293) (-1.136) (-2.226) (1.308) (-0.363)\nSub-Saharan Africa 9.758 -3.881 -2.946 -6.688** 0.706 -4.123\n(1.508) (-0.518) (-1.209) (-2.345) (0.241) (-1.348)\nEast Asia and the Pacific 17.82** 10.81 -0.595 -1.945 1.100 -1.642\n(2.450) (1.283) (-0.216) (-0.602) (0.334) (-0.478)\nMiddle East 36.87*** 21.38** -0.904 -4.976 16.26*** 11.31***\n(4.490) (2.249) (-0.304) (-1.430) (4.378) (2.913)\nEastern Europe and  24.69** 0.405 0.978 -4.699 13.03*** 4.323\nCentral Asia\n(2.384) (0.0338) (0.264) (-1.082) (2.781) (0.883)\nShare of Protestant  -0.104 -0.203 -0.0218 -0.0514 -0.0780 -0.124**\nPopulation\n(-0.829) (-1.396) (-0.491) (-0.986) (-1.371) (-2.089)\nShare of Catholic  -0.219*** -0.182** -0.0286 -0.0303 -0.0471 -0.0392\nPopulation\n(-3.245) (-2.323) (-1.194) (-1.082) (-1.539) (-1.227)\nShare of Muslim  -0.0421 -0.0240 0.0210 0.0163 -0.0552* -0.0530*\nPopulation\n(-0.691) (-0.340) (0.958) (0.633) (-2.002) (-1.839)\nLandlocked -5.611* -11.80*** -1.762 -2.803** -5.358*** -7.291***\n(-1.735) (-3.150) (-1.538) (-2.090) (-3.664) (-4.770)\nFrench Legal System -10.25** -7.515 -0.117 -0.563 -3.762* -3.193\n(-2.381) (-1.508) (-0.0768) (-0.317) (-1.932) (-1.570)\nGerman Legal System -18.27*** -21.63*** 2.506 0.990 -0.877 -2.016\n(-2.937) (-3.003) (1.140) (0.385) (-0.312) (-0.686)\nTransition Economy 3.121 8.144 3.459 5.205 0.390 2.960\n(0.351) (0.790) (1.099) (1.413) (0.0969) (0.704)\nConstant -5.811 3.274 0.0334 4.049 -0.141 3.407\n(-0.911) (0.443) (0.0139) (1.438) (-0.0490) (1.130)\nObservations 71 71 70 70 71 71\nAdjusted R-squared 0.416 0.457 0.531 0.515 0.595 0.584\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.\nNote:  t-statistics in parentheses.\nSource:  Authors\u2018 estimates.\n3.

Initial per capita \nconsumption is positively associated with this measure of the middle class.24 In addition, \n24 Removing the quadratic term of the initial consumption mean makes the relationship significant and positive.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 29\na greater share of services relative to agriculture is associated with a smaller middle \nclass. Our further regressions (unreported) show that services share is positively related \nto the size of the lower group, that is, those who are below the 75% of the median \nconsumption.25 Given that services had a positive impact on the richer class, our results \nsuggest that possible employment opportunities created by the services sector have a \ndifferent impact on different classes. These results are not suprising, given that Birdsall \net al. (2000) find that during the globalization process, parts of the middle class based on \nthis median measure experienced increased upward mobility, while others experienced \nincreased uncertainty and downward mobility. Overall, these findings suggest that the \nservices sector is associated with different occupational categories and, correspondingly, \ndifferential skills and rewards. We also find that the impact of democratic government \nand urbanization on MC median is generally positive but the significance levels of these \nvariables is just outside the 10% level.\nTime-invariant country characteristics associated with MC median are examined in Table \n8b (Models 5 and 6). Ethnic concentration is again significant and positively related \nto a larger middle class. Landlocked countries are associated with a smaller relative \nmiddle class, while larger Muslim and Protestant populations are associated with a \nsmaller share of people within 0.75%\u20131.25% of the median income. The Middle Eastern \nregional characteristics seem to be associated with a much larger share of middle class, \ncompared to South Asia, which is no different from other regions.\nTo sum up, our results provide significant insights regarding the factors that are \nassociated with middle class size. In general, greater government involvement in the \neconomy, a lower services share relative to agriculture, higher urbanization levels, and \na democratic regime are associated with a larger middle class. Countries with greater \nethnic diversity and those that are landlocked are at a disadvantage in creating a larger \nmiddle class, whether defined with an absolute or a relative measure. The German legal \nsystem and, to some extent, the French law seem to be negatively associated with \nmiddle class size as well. There is also evidence to suggest that, after controlling for \nseveral factors, regional characteristics and some religions may affect the size of the \nmiddle class. Overall, our time-invariant factors are able to explain 42%\u201360% of country-\nfixed characteristics that affect the middle class.\nD.   What Factors Affect the Growth of the Middle Class?\nIn comparison to the size of the middle class, exploring the growth in its size can \noffer insights on the steps that can be taken to expand its size. Table 9a presents the \nregression results where the growth in middle class size is modeled as a function of \nthe growth of various explanatory variables. Due to the need to use lagged growth of \n25 Perhaps expectedly, both industry and services share relative to agriculture are insignificant for the upper group, \ni.e., those above 125% of the median consumption, implying that the sectoral employment opportunities do not \nexplain the size of this group.", "30 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nthe explanatory variables to overcome the reverse causation problem, in this analysis \nwe utilize the balanced panel data to keep the number of countries comparable to the \nanalysis of the size of the middle class. The results show that initial consumption is \nnonlinearly negative and significant for the absolute measure, as well as for the median \nmeasure, indicating a \u201cmiddle class convergence\u201d effect. In other words, developing \ncountries seem to experience a (conditional) convergence to a certain level of middle \nclass size, but at a slower rate over the range of middle class values. On the other hand, \nin contrast to the middle class size regressions, growth in the government\u2019s share in GDP \nis associated with decreases in middle class size using MC ($2\u2013$10) and MC middle 60% \nmeasures. This result is consistent with the explanation that an expansion in government \nsize erodes the economic freedom of its population by taxing people, and/or extending \nthe public sector\u2019s arm at the expense of the middle class. The picture becomes clearer if \none defines the private sector as \u201c1- public sector\u201d. To the extent that larger governments \nimply smaller private sectors, our finding suggests that smaller sizes of private sectors \nare associated with smaller middle class sizes, but growth in the size of the private sector \ncan pave the way for the growth in the middle class size.

Generally, two effects stand out: regional effects and being landlocked. \nEast Asia and the Pacific and the Middle East appear to be doing much better than South \nAsia and other regions in terms of the absolute measure, while Latin America, Eastern \nEurope, and Central Asia join them in terms of the relative median measure. We continue \nto find that a landlocked country not only has a smaller middle class, but also lower rates \nof middle class growth, as shown by the negative signs on the relative measures.\nVI.  Robustness Checks\nIn this section, we check the robustness of our results to the empirical specification and \nthe data used.27 \n(i)  Time Effects. In the main regressions specifications we excluded time \ndummies as their inclusion may be too restrictive if the dependent and \nindependent variables in our regressions are time-dependent and, hence, \nmay wash out the true relationship between the variables.28 We check \nthe robustness of our results to inclusion of the time dummies. We find \nthat most of the results related to the middle class remain intact with \nthe inclusion of time dummies in the models (not reported). The only \nexception is that the MC middle 60% becomes linearly positive (instead \nof nonlinearly) in the human capital model. On the other hand, schooling \nloses its significance in the growth model, which indicates that schooling \nhas a time-dependent relationship with consumption growth.\n(ii)  Different Samples. We exclude the transition and oil economies from the \nunbalanced sample, as Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) argue that these \neconomies may not follow the standard Solow growth model. None of our \nresults, especially those related to both factor inputs and middle class \nvariables in equation (1), seem to be driven by these countries.\n  Using the balanced panel of data created with straight-line interpolations \nand covering 72 countries every 3 years from 1990 to 2008, we find \nsimilar results to those of the unbalanced panel. The robust impact of the \nmiddle class on human capital and, through this channel, on growth, is \n27 The results discussed in this section are not shown, but are available upon request.\n28 For example, the size of the middle class across countries can grow over time due to technological spurts and \nproductivity shocks, or can shrink due to economic and financial crises. Likewise, many other variables such as \nschooling, urbanization etc., exhibit common movements across countries over time, with the world average \n(i.e., developing countries in our sample) increasing over time. Time dummies, if included in the model, not only \ncapture these common movements, but also weaken the relationship between the dependent and some of the \nindependent variables, because such movements are held constant in the model.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 33\nfound again.29 The direct effect on growth and the indirect effect on labor \nforce growth seem nonexistent with this data set, while the positive effect \non savings is observed with the absolute and the median measures. On \nthe other hand, the size effects related to government provision, fertility, \nservices and industry share relative to agriculture, and the effects related to \nlog population and government role in the growth of the middle class size \nare replicated, as above. Finally, the effects of ethnic fractionalization and \nthe German legal system on the size of the middle class and the effect of \nFrench legal tradition on the growth of the middle class are also repeated, \nas are the effects of regional factors.30\n(iii)  Control Variables. In the unbalanced sample, we use international \nmigration stock (and its change) in the labor force equation, but it is always \nestimated as insignificant. This may be because international migration \nis probably a more relevant issue for developed countries. In equations \n(3) and (4), we experimented with the absolute size of the services and \nindustry sectors. This did not make any material difference to our results.\n  It is possible that including the variables of vector X in equation (2) may \nbias the coefficient estimates of the middle class measures, given that \nsome of the variables in X may be highly correlated with the middle class \nvariables in equation (3). We find that even after dropping the variables \nthat are significant in equation (3) from the factor input models, none of the \nmiddle class effects seems to suffer from multicollinearity.31\nVII.  Conclusion\nOur examination of the contribution of the middle class to consumption growth suggests \nthat the importance of the middle class is found to occur indirectly, primarily through \nits contribution to factor inputs, chiefly human capital. The relationship between the \nmiddle class and the levels of human capital is shown to be robust, positive, and highly \nsignificant for all middle class measures. There is also evidence that a larger middle class \nis associated with higher levels of savings in a country, but savings is estimated to be \n29 The only difference this time is that all middle class measures seem to have nonlinear effects on schooling, which \nincreases at a decreasing rate.\n30 The only variable that is significant with the unbalanced panel but seemed insignificant in the two other samples \nis the level of democracy.\n31 One should not cause a misspecification problem while checking the appropriateness of the specification. We \nfirst regress each middle class measure on the variables in the X vector, as well as on country-fixed effects, as per \nequation (3). Then, we note the significant variables from this regression, and drop these variables from equation \n(2) if they are originally estimated to be insignificant (if they are originally significant in the factor input equations, \nthen they are relevant and cannot be dropped), and observe the changes in the effects of the middle class \nmeasures.", "34 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\ninsignificant in the growth model in our sample. We also find evidence that the share held \nby the middle 60% of the expenditure distribution may have a direct effect outside of its \ninfluence on growth through the factor inputs channel.\nOverall, these results are consistent with Banerjee and Duflo\u2019s (2008) conclusion, based \non an analysis of micro-level household survey data, that the middle class may matter for \ngrowth on account of their investments in human capital, something that is facilitated by \nsteady employment that seems to be a key characteristic of what it means to be middle \nclass. These results are also consistent with the view that a strong middle class is likely \nto lead to long-run development by positively affecting the proximate causes of growth \n(Acemoglu et al. 2005). The robust impact on consumption growth through schooling is \nalso consistent with the increased demand for human capital during the industrialization \nprocess as suggested by Galor\u2019s (2005) unified growth theory, indicating where the \ndemand may originate from. Our results also support the view that specifically targeting \nthe middle class may help in the fight against poverty, compared to policies that solely \naim to help the impoverished (Ravallion 2009, Birdsall 2010).\nTo the extent that policy makers would like to nurture the middle class, how should they \ndo so? Our analysis reveals that there appear to be many deeply embedded institutional \nand cultural characteristics that are country-specific that can present difficulties when \ntrying to foster the middle class. Specifically, countries with nondemocratic political \nsystems, German and French legal traditions, greater ethnic fractionalization, and those \nthat are landlocked, are found to have a significantly smaller middle class. However, \nour analysis also reveals avenues that foster growth of the middle class. For example, \nour results suggest that policies to spur on the private sector are likely to lead to faster \ngrowth of the middle class. They also suggest that policies that promote urbanization will \nboost the size of the middle class.", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 35\nAppendix: Countries in Unbalanced Panel and Middle \nClass Size from First Year in Data\nCountry First  MC HC Middle  0.75%\u20131.25% \nYear  ($2\u2013$10)  ($10+) 60% Median\nAlbania 1997 86.56 6.67 53.49 36.78\nArmenia 1996 57.83 4.34 43.88 23.48\nBangladesh 1986 18.97 0.23 52.70 8.87\nBotswana 1986 41.09 4.84 37.38 8.94\nBrazil 1987 52.1 18.99 34.25 17.97\nBulgaria 1989 14.31 85.79 55.71 47.15\nBurundi 1992 5 0.1 50.42 2.17\nCambodia 1994 22.44 0.86 44.99 8.56\nCameroon 1996 24.94 1.36 40.36 8.07\nCentral African  1993 8.97 0.57 33.00 2.61\nRepublic\nChile 1987 59.47 17.65 35.16 20.77\nChina, People\u2018s  1987 16.92 0.1 54.09 8.6\nRepublic of\nColombia 2003 55.05 19.14 34.82 18.89\nCosta Rica 1986 75.07 4.1 55.11 29.19\nCroatia 1998 19.62 80.48 54.66 41.14\nCote d\u2019Ivoire 1986 69.46 6.29 47.35 29.44\nDominican Republic 1986 61.13 9 43.99 23.2\nEcuador 1994 59.81 12.6 41.21 21.54\nEgypt 1991 70.65 2.44 50.50 37.65\nEl Salvador 1995 62.9 12.26 41.97 23.08\nEstonia 1993 70.45 27.92 47.18 31.19\nGambia 1998 17.72 0.77 40.71 5.25\nGhana 1988 21.51 0.22 50.34 8.5\nGuatemala 1987 27.93 2.36 34.47 7.4\nHonduras 1990 36.02 3.44 35.39 8.3\nIndia 1988 16.74 0.4 . 7.12\nIran 1986 66.11 20.07 42.82 24.46\nJamaica 1988 71.86 14.35 45.54 27.54\nJordan 1987 78.54 19.94 49.15 31.4\nKazakhstan 1993 78.35 4.73 52.11 33.93\nKenya 1992 37.67 3.72 33.54 9.31\nKyrgyz Republic 1993 56.51 13.9 40.40 19.87\nLao People\u2018s  1992 15.55 0.27 50.65 6.67\nDemocratic Republic\nLatvia 1993 86.41 13.69 53.95 39.62\nLesotho 1987 34.68 3.7 37.06 7.99\nLithuania 1996 75.63 23.79 51.81 36.82\ncontinued.", "36 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 245\nAppendix: continued.\nCountry First  MC HC Middle 0.75%\u20131.25%\nYear  ($2\u2013$10)  ($10+)  60%  Median\nMalawi 1998 6.93 0.55 38.19 2.43\nMalaysia 1987 67.47 20.65 42.60 24.97\nMali 1989 30.52 0.71 48.98 10.94\nMauritania 1987 35 1.17 47.12 10.31\nMoldova 1992 60.44 1.33 51.73 25.37\nMongolia 1995 57.64 0.36 52.27 21.55\nMorocco 1991 75.28 9.03 46.93 30.12\nMozambique 1997 7.19 0.41 42.86 2.74\nNepal 1996 11.9 0.45 46.44 4.7\nNicaragua 1993 45.92 5.65 36.98 9.5\nNigeria 1992 8.98 0.33 48.33 3.86\nPakistan 1987 11.19 0.32 49.74 4.76\nPanama 1995 50.96 29.4 37.80 18.55\nParaguay 1990 71.44 9.93 48.33 27.59\nPeru 1986 61.18 33.51 43.92 25.56\nPhilippines 1988 41.89 2.06 45.70 11.66\nPoland 1987 47.67 52.43 54.99 43.71\nRomania 1989 42.19 57.91 56.76 46.49\nRussian Federation 1996 61.17 29.96 44.25 25.72\nSenegal 1991 17.68 1.09 37.40 5.63\nSlovenia 1993 16.81 83.29 52.06 41.71\nSouth Africa 1993 44.59 14.89 32.70 16.26\nSri Lanka 1991 50.84 1.24 49.69 18.1\nSwaziland 1995 10.09 0.89 31.84 3.21\nTajikistan 1999 22.76 0.15 52.20 9.8\nTanzania 1992 9 0.1 50.95 3.85\nThailand 1988 56.43 4.46 43.63 22.08\nTrinidad and  1988 62.29 29.47 47.12 24.91\nTobago\nTunisia 1990 72.25 9.02 47.74 28.53\nTurkey 1987 76.24 16.54 43.55 29.26\nUganda 1989 14.16 0.41 45.12 5.01\nUkraine 1992 74.59 25.51 55.74 39.99\nVenezuela 1987 56.37 25.88 39.23 20.02\nViet Nam 1993 14.54 0.3 48.18 5.63\nYemen 1992 75.14 9.05 47.91 30.3\nZambia 1993 18.72 0.93 40.33 5.51", "The Role of the Middle Class in Economic Development: What Do Cross-Country Data Show? | 37\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D., and F.

Using different middle class \nmeasures and a panel of 72 developing countries spanning the period 1985\u20132006, \nthey find that a larger middle class influences growth primarily through higher levels of \nhuman capital investment. While institutional and cultural characteristics may present \nbarriers to fostering the middle class, enlarging governments, developing urban areas, \npromoting democracy, and limiting ethnic concentration are all potentially conducive to \nboosting the size of the middle class.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its \ndeveloping member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million \nstruggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through \ninclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration. \n  Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its \nmain instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, \nequity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. WPS113288\n< 0113 2885 >\nPrinted on recycled paper Printed in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Natalie Chun, Rana Hasan, and Mehmet Ulubasoglu", "CreationDate": "D:20110414102729+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)", "Keywords": "middle class, class stratification, cross-country, economic and consumption growth, investment, economic working paper no. 245", "ModDate": "D:20110415101106+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.9", "Subject": "This paper investigates the channels through which the middle class may matter for consumption growth and development.
