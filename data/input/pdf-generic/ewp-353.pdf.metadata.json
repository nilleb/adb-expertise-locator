Moreover,  the  share  of \nthe  service  sector  in  GDP  is  decreasing  while  many  developed  countries \nmaintain  a  positive  association  between  the  shares  of  the  sector  in  output  and \nper  capita  income.  This  paper  investigates  this  relationship  by  examining  the \ngross  provincial  product  of  76  provinces  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  the  service \nsector is a growth engine in the Thai economy. Using the fixed-effects model, the \nestimates  confirm  two  waves  of  growth.  Total  factor  productivity  and  revealed \ncomparative advantages are discussed to determine significant service activities. \nWholesale  and  retail  trade,  tourism  and  travel-related  activities,  transportation, \nand  construction  all  play  major  roles  in  contributing  to  Thailand\u2019s  economic \ngrowth.  The  government  should  continue  to  promote  these  services  with \nunambiguous  policies  suitable  for  each  region  and  province.  Educational \nservices also require more attention from pertinent agencies.    \n \n \n \n \nKeywords:  service  sector,  economic  growth,  structural  change,  Thai  economy, \neconomic development \n \nJEL codes: O14, O17, R11 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nI. INTRODUCTION \n \nAs is true in every newly industrializing economy, the economy of Thailand is mixed. Decisions \nregarding the production of goods and services are made in both the private and public sectors. \nFrom  the  early  1970s  to  the  mid-1990s,  Thailand  experienced  significant  economic  growth. \nBetween 1980 and 1990, the average growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was about \n7.6%, and the growth of exports was around 14%. Between 1990 and 1995, average growth in \nreal GDP reached 8.4%, and average export growth was 14.2% (Salvatore 2011). Since 2000, \nhowever,  Thailand  has  had  an  average  real  GDP  growth  of  only  about  4%.  While  Thailand  is \nwidely perceived as an economically developing country led by agricultural exports, the majority \nof the country\u2019s income is driven by the manufacturing and the service sectors. Since 1993, the \nagriculture sector has contributed only 300\u2013400 billion baht (B) per year to Thailand\u2019s real GDP \nwhile in 2009, the service sector generated about B2 trillion or almost 50% of GDP mostly from \nprivate sector services (Table 1). \n\n \nBased on this pattern, the Thai economy is in the first phase of economic development. \nAfter  resources  shift  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing,  there  will  be  a  final  shift  to  tertiary \nproduction or services (Fisher 1939, Clark 1940). This paper analyzes the status of Thailand\u2019s \nservice sector and investigates whether it is a growth engine for the economy. \n\n \n \nII. BASIC FACTS  \n \nBecause  the  service  sector  is  highly  diverse,  ranging  from  low-end  services  such  as  street \nvendors  to  high-end  services  in  the  financial  and  professional  sectors,  a  clear  definition  is \nrequired.   \n\nA. \n\n \nWhat is Thailand\u2019s Service Sector? \n \n\nLike  every  country,  Thailand  has  several  definitions  of  services  depending  on  derivation  and \nterms  of  use.  The  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  of  Thailand  defines  the \nservice sector as all economic activities except for those in the agriculture, manufacturing, and \nmining and quarrying sectors.1 Using this broad concept, Thailand defines its service sector as \ncomprising no fewer than a dozen economic activities. Since 1991, the General Agreement on \nTrade  in  Services  (GATS)  has  offered  a  different  definition  of  the  service  sector  and  has \npublished  a  service  sector  classification  list  (WTO  1995)  that  has  become  the  standard  for \nacademics  and  scholars.  A  third  classification  method  is  the  balance  of  payments,  an \nInternational Monetary Fund definition used mainly for international trade and finance statistics.  \n\n \nBecause  the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  and  GATS  propose \ndifferent  definitions  of  the  service  sector,  researchers  and  policymakers  have  a  more  difficult \ntime  studying  service  activities.  For  example,  the  national  definition  classifies  hotels  and \nrestaurants  as  major  service  activities  whereas  the  GATS  recognizes  each  as  services  within \ntourism  and  travel  (Table  2).  Multiple  definitions  make  data  collection  and  systematic  analysis \ndifficult which in turn generates high transaction costs when researchers and policymakers need \nmore information about particular services such as tourism or recreational services. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   This  is  the  International  Standard  Industrial  Classification  of  All  Economic  Activities  (ISIC)  for  objectively \n\nclassifying economic data. \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nTable 1: Gross Domestic Product in 1988 Prices by Economic Activity in Thailand, 1993\u20132009 (Baht million) \n\n \n\n  \nAgriculture \nAgriculture, hunting and forestry \nFishing \nNon-agriculture \nMining and quarrying \nManufacturing \nElectricity, gas and water supply \nConstruction \nWholesale and retail trade; repair of motor \n     vehicles, motorcycles and personal and \n     household goods \nHotels and restaurants \nTransport, storage and communications \nFinancial intermediation \nReal estate, renting and business activities \nPublic administration and defense; compulsory \n     social security \nEducation \nHealth and social work \nOther community, social and personal service \n     activities \nPrivate households with employed persons \nGross domestic product (GDP) \nPer capita GDP (Baht) \nService sector \nPrivate service sector \nNon-services \n\np = prediction, r = re-estimate.  \n\nSource: National Economic and Social Development Board \n \n \n\n1993\u20131997 \n274,652 \n225,894 \n48,758 \n2,584,062 \n48,445 \n930,871 \n75,894 \n169,805 \n\n1998\u20132002 \n304,785 \n255,337 \n49,449 \n2,683,356 \n63,541 \n1,071,093 \n97,317 \n81,541 \n\n491,047 \n104,068 \n238,223 \n198,424 \n108,986 \n\n76,562 \n65,223 \n30,715 \n\n42,408 \n3,391 \n2,858,714 \n48,121 \n1,604,745 \n1,528,183 \n1,253,969 \n\n465,085 \n112,647 \n291,245 \n98,949 \n120,278 \n\n97,042 \n83,246 \n41,481 \n\n56,483 \n3,408 \n2,988,142 \n47,938 \n1,548,722 \n1,451,679 \n1,439,420 \n\n2003 \n363,033 \n307,619 \n55,414 \n3,105,133 \n76,616 \n1,318,279 \n115,195 \n82,837 \n\n493,719 \n118,852 \n340,644 \n111,807 \n134,641 \n\n108,375 \n86,760 \n42,689 \n\n71,168 \n3,551 \n3,468,166 \n54,205 \n1,710,238 \n1,601,863 \n1,757,928 \n\n2004 \n354,431 \n296,996 \n57,435 \n3,333,758 \n80,837 \n1,426,338 \n122,525 \n88,790 \n\n2005 \n347,892 \n288,835 \n59,057 \n3,510,127 \n88,081 \n1,499,882 \n129,004 \n93,809 \n\n2006r \n365,428 \n301,608 \n63,820 \n\n2007r \n369,772 \n306,747 \n63,025 \n3,689,076  3,889,254 \n95,088 \n1,588,105  1,686,372 \n141,975 \n100,511 \n\n135,114 \n98,086 \n\n91,585 \n\n2008r \n385,225 \n320,058 \n65,167 \n3,979,608 \n95,280 \n1,751,411 \n147,603 \n95,190 \n\n2009p \n390,362 \n322,342 \n68,020 \n3,872,777 \n96,105 \n1,645,015 \n148,880 \n95,551 \n\n517,310 \n133,324 \n366,290 \n125,723 \n143,581 \n\n111,795 \n89,821 \n43,678 \n\n541,934 \n136,165 \n383,925 \n136,342 \n151,225 \n\n116,267 \n96,138 \n48,515 \n\n560,218 \n151,267 \n407,682 \n140,719 \n159,500 \n\n115,298 \n99,343 \n50,938 \n\n591,030 \n157,858 \n432,037 \n148,575 \n164,607 \n\n120,583 \n109,095 \n54,680 \n\n596,735 \n160,430 \n429,933 \n160,938 \n168,739 \n\n122,161 \n109,423 \n54,263 \n\n594,785 \n160,017 \n413,666 \n167,346 \n170,597 \n\n122,260 \n115,190 \n55,346 \n\n80,066 \n3,680 \n3,688,189 \n57,154 \n1,826,583 \n1,714,788 \n1,861,606 \n\n85,155 \n3,685 \n3,858,019 \n59,264 \n1,922,164 \n1,805,897 \n1,935,855 \n\n87,619 \n3,602 \n\n83,148 \n3,695 \n4,054,504  4,259,026 \n64,491 \n2,009,386  2,107,794 \n1,894,088  1,987,211 \n2,045,118  2,151,232 \n\n61,831 \n\n83,740 \n3,762 \n4,364,833 \n65,654 \n2,132,917 \n2,010,756 \n2,231,916 \n\n84,186 \n3,833 \n4,263,139 \n63,721 \n2,131,657 \n2,009,397 \n2,131,482 \n\n\fA Turning Point for the Service Sector in Thailand   \u0406   3 \n\nTable 2: Definitions of the Service Sector \n \n\nService Sector: NESDB Concept \n  1.

Using  the  purchasing  power \nparity method, Thailand\u2019s economy was estimated at about $601.4 billion which ranked it 25th \namong  226  countries.  Thailand  is  an  upper-middle  income  country,  and  its  economy  is \ncomprised  mainly  of  the  agriculture,  manufacturing,  and  service  sectors  which  contributed \napproximately 13.3%, 34%, and 52.7%, respectively to the GDP (CIA 2012). Thailand\u2019s service \nsector  has  long  been  viewed  as  an  indicator  of  economic  development.  Over  the  past  few \ndecades,  the  significance  of  the  service  and  manufacturing  sectors  in  terms  of  real  GDP  has \nincreased steadily while the share of real GDP derived from the agriculture sector has become \nless  important.  Among  the  three  major  sectors,  the  service  sector  has  contributed  the  largest \npercentage to the country\u2019s GDP since 1993 (Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Sector Share in GDP \n\n%\n\n30\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\nAgriculture\n\nManufacturing\n\nServices\n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n\n\f4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nThailand\u2019s  service  sector  contributed  from  0.6  percentage  points  to  3.4  percentage \npoints to GDP growth from 1993 to 2009 except in 1998 to 2002 after the Asian financial crisis \nand  again  in  2009  while  manufacturing  contributed  about  1.1  percentage  points  to  3.9 \npercentage points from 1993 to 2008 (Table 3). The agriculture sector has played a smaller role \nin  growth  and  income  as  its  share  in  GDP  stabilized  at  around  10%  during  the  study  period \ncontributing  less  than  0.5  percentage  points  to  GDP  growth.  Although  the  service  sector \ncontributed substantially to GDP growth from 1993 to 2008, over time its share in GDP seemed \nto  shrink  while  the  opposite  was  true  for  the  share  of  the  manufacturing  sector.  Figure  1 \nillustrates  these  trends.  This  reflects  the  changing  nature  of  the  Thai  economy.  Diminishing \nagricultural production implies that to some extent the country has developed according to the \nstructural  change  model  of  shifting  from  agriculture  to  manufacturing  to  services.  Whether \nThailand is currently at the secondary or tertiary stage is still unclear. \n\n \nLike  the  share  of  the  service  sector  in  GDP,  the  share  in  employment  has  been \nparamount  since  2003  and  in  2010  provided  work  for  about  18  million  people  (Table  4).  The \ntrends in the shares in GDP and in employment are, however, moving in opposite directions as \nthe  former  is  decreasing  while  the  latter  is  increasing.  In  contrast,  the  labor  force  in  the \nagriculture  sector  has  fluctuated  from  1998  to  2010  but  since  2008  has  shown  signs  of \ndecreasing in both size and in share of employment. While the manufacturing sector, as noted \npreviously  has  increased  its  share  in  GDP,  its  share  in  employment  has  remained  stable  at \nabout  15%.  The  average  wage  paid  in  services  has,  however,  been  higher  than  the  average \nwage paid in the other two sectors (Figure 2). \n\n \nIn  order  to  evaluate  the  relative  importance  of  individual  services,  the  share  of  each \nservice industry in sector output from 1993 to 2009 is plotted in Figure 3. The most outstanding \nservice  industry  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  GDP  is  wholesale  and  retail  trade 2  which \ncontributed as much as 14% of the total in 2009 or about 28% of the total service contribution. \nTransportation, storage, and communications ranked second contributing 9.7% of total GDP in \n2009  or  19%  of  total  service  output.  From  an  employment  perspective,  wholesale  and  retail \ntrade was again the most significant, generating jobs for about 6 million people in 2009. Hotels \nand restaurants (2.7 million jobs); construction (2.4 million); public administration, defense, and \nsocial  security  (1.5  million);  and  education  (1.2  million)  were  also  important  sources  of \nemployment.

Based  on  the  information  in  Figure  1  and  the  World  Factbook,  starting  in \n2009  we  can  observe  a  turning  point  where  the  shares  of  the  manufacturing  sector  decrease \nand those of the service sector increase.   \n \nC. \n \nFrom  2005  to  2010,  Thailand  had  a  trade  deficit  in  services  averaging  about  $8.9  billion  that \ngrew to almost $10 billion in 2011 (Table 5). In addition to transportation, royalties and licensing, \ncommunication  services,  and  insurance  services  have  caused  the  majority  of  the  deficit  while \ntravel  services  have  been  the  major  positive  component  since  2005.  It  is  noteworthy  that  in \n2010, the hotel and restaurant industry ranked second in employment in part due to the tourism \nindustry.  According  to  the  Thomas  White  International  website,  in  2007,  tourism  and  travel  in \nThailand contributed a staggering 6% of total GDP,  more  than in any other Asian nation. This \nconcurs with data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Service Profiles that show that in \n2010  Thailand  received  a  positive  net  trade  balance  of  payments  in  travel  equal  to  $14.644 \nmillion  which  ranked  it  first  among  the  Asian  countries  studied.  Moreover,  Bangkok,  has \nreceived  \"The  World's  Best  City  Award\"  for  four  consecutive  years  (2010\u20132013)  in  Travel  & \nLeisure.   \n\n \nThailand\u2019s inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in the service sector from 2005 to 2011 \naveraged  $3  billion  with  a  peak  in  2007  of  about  $3.8  billion.  The  majority  was  in  financial \nintermediation  and  real  estate  at  about  88%  of  gross  annual  FDI  (Table  6).  Thailand\u2019s  sector \nhas shown significant openness to trade in services by welcoming foreign investment. \n\n \n \n \n\nIII. SHARE OF OUTPUT MODEL \n \nBased on the framework in Eichengreen and Gupta (2009), the relationship between the share \nof output in the service sector and per capita income in Thailand was examined using provincial \ndata  for  the  first  time.  Data  for  this  study  came  from  the  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Board\u2019s gross regional and provincial product (GPP).

The plots are shown in Figure 4 in four categories. Plot (1) displays all provinces \nexcept Bangkok and vicinity and Phuket. The relationship appears wave-like with an increasing \ntrend in the service share when income is low and a decreasing trend when income is high. This \nrelationship differs from a major assumption in economic development: the service sector grows \nas  income  increases.  Plot  (2)  shows  Bangkok  and  vicinity  and  presents  a  parabolic  function. \nPlot (3) is for Phuket, Thailand\u2019s largest island, and confirms the conventional assumption that \nservice  output  and  income  are  directly  related.  Although  Phuket  and  Bangkok  seem  to  be \noutliers  in  our  model,  by  including  these  outliers  plot  (4)  still  maintains  a  wave-like  shape. \nTherefore  the  panel  data  model  uses  76  provinces  from  1995  to  2009  with  a  total  of  1,140 \nobservations and hypothesizes the wave-like shape as shown in Figure 4 plot (4). Because of \nthe  limitations  of  a  bounded  share  as  discussed  in  Eichengreen  and  Gupta,  the  relationships \nwere estimated in quartic form.   \n\n \nBefore determining the equation for the estimation, the relationships between the shares \nof GPP and per capita income in each of the three sectors were tested using the Lowess plots \nas  stated  in  Eichengreen  and  Gupta.  The  agricultural  share  of  output  declines  as  income \nincreases while the manufacturing share of output rises as income increases. The service share \nof  output  generally  decreases  as  income  increases  except  for  the  lowest  and  the  highest \nincome groups. This information is relevant to the fact stated in Figure 1. The Lowess plots for \nthe manufacturing share of GPP are similar to the plots from Eichengreen and Gupta, but the \ndeclining trend has not yet appeared. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n4   The plots presented in Figure 4 are uncontrolled for time and spatial dimensions; nevertheless, they help explain \n\nthe nature of the data used in the model. \n\n\f12   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nFigure 4: Scatter Plot of the Service Share of Gross Provincial Product \nand Log per capita Income \n \n\n(1) = (4)-(3)-(2)\n\nBangkok and Vicinity (2)\n\nPhuket (3)\n\nTotal (4)\n\nP\nP\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\nr\na\nh\nS\n\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\nS\n \ns\ne\nc\nv\nr\ne\nS\n\ni\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13 9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nLog of per Capita Income\n\n13\n\n \n\nGPP = gross provincial product. \n\nNote: There are no controls for any time or spatial dimensions.   \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n\n \n \nThe  fixed-effect  model  with  robust  standard  errors  was  run  with  the  service  sector\u2019s \npercentage of GPP as the dependent variable. The independent variables were the four powers \nof the natural log of real per capita income and a dummy variable for structural change in the \nThai economy. The dummy variable may be seen as post-financial crisis development factors. \nFixed-effect models control for the effects of time-invariant variables with time-invariant effects, \ni.e., the variable has the same effect across time such as gender, race, and some institutional \nfactors. Therefore, the equation was determined as follows:  \n\n \n(cid:1871)(cid:1857)(cid:1870)(cid:1874)(cid:1861)(cid:1855)(cid:1857)(cid:1871)(cid:1860)(cid:1853)(cid:1870)(cid:1857)(cid:3036)(cid:3047) (cid:3404) (cid:1829)(cid:1867)(cid:1866)(cid:1871)(cid:1872)(cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1872) (cid:3397)  (cid:3532) \u03b8(cid:2919)D(cid:2919) (cid:3397) \u03b1(cid:2869)Y(cid:2919)(cid:2930) (cid:3397) \u03b1(cid:2870)Y(cid:2919)(cid:2930)\n\n(cid:3036)\n\n(cid:2870) (cid:3397) \u03b1(cid:2871)Y(cid:2919)(cid:2930)\n\n(cid:2871) (cid:3397) \u03b1(cid:2872)Y(cid:2919)(cid:2930)\n\n(cid:2872) (cid:3397)\n\n\u03b5(cid:2919)(cid:2930)  \n\n \nThe estimates are displayed in Table 8. All models confirm the hypothesis of a quartic functional \nform and two waves of service sector growth.   \n\n \nThe service sector share in GPP and per capita income in model I (base case) and the \nrelationship between the service sector share in GPP and per capita income in model II (with a \ndummy  variable)  were  then  plotted  together  in  Figure  5.  This  figure  exhibits  two  types  of \nrelationships  based  on  estimates  from  both  models.  Each  relationship  pattern  indicates  that \nthere is a possibility for two waves of service sector growth in Thailand and also implies that the \nservice  sector  is  a  growth  engine  for  the  Thai  economy.

This  study  assumes  no  resources  move  between  provinces.  In  the  real  world,  there  is  labor/human \ncapital movement not only within a country but also among countries. \n\n\f14   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nThe first wave takes place when a province moves from lower to middle-income status, \nand  the  second  takes  place  when  a  province  moves  from  middle  to  high-income  status. \nTherefore  there  will  be  two  turning  points.  Figure  5  displays  information  that  is  especially \nimportant for Thailand.  \n\n \n\n\uf0b7  After a first turning point, provinces will experience a reduced service share in GPP as \nincomes move toward higher levels. Moreover, per capita income in the bottom 10% is \nlog per capita income less than 9.516 which is equal to per capita income of B13,577 a \nyear  (1988  prices).  All  of  the  lower  per  capita  income  provinces  are  located  in  the \nnortheastern region.6  \n\n\uf0b7  The high-income provinces have two distinct relationship patterns that could explain why \n\nthe service sector is a growth engine.   \n\n\uf0b7  The  first  possible  turning  point  for  the  estimates  in  model  II  occurs  when  per  capita \nincome  in  the  highest  8%  of  the  population  is  equal  to  the  log  per  capita  of  income \ngreater than 12 and equals per capita income of B163,169 a year (1988 prices).  There \nare  only  seven  provinces7 with  these  characteristics.  They  contain  industrial  parks  and \nare either near the capital or a marine port.  In this model, the service sector would be a \ngrowth engine for the Thai economy. \n\n\uf0b7  For the base case, our estimates show the possible turning point would be a point after \nlog per capita income greater than 13, or per capita income greater than B442,000 per \nyear (1988 prices). In the base case, the Thai economy would depend mainly upon the \nmanufacturing sector rather than services for growth. \n\n \n \nIV. TOWARD A POSSIBLE TURNING POINT \n \n\nShare of Output Model Revisited \n\nA. \n \nThailand\u2019s service sector could potentially experience a second wave of growth, particularly in \nhigh-income provinces near Bangkok. In this section, specific service activities are investigated \nin  order  to  offer  public  policy  advice.  The  service  sector  is  then  assessed  comparing  model  II \nwith  the  dependent  variables  of  private  service  sector  results  and  12  other  service  activities. \nBefore  doing  so,  data  on  12  service  activities  were  tested  in  scatter  plots  to  reveal  the \nrelationship between the share of the GPP and log per capita income. The plots indicated that \neach  service  activity  may  not  be  evidence  for  a  quartic  function  and  also  has  several  outlying \npoints.  Therefore,  estimating  the  share  of  each  service  in  GPP  using  the  model  discussed \nabove  is  not  statistically  significant  except  for  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  construction,  and \neducation. \n \n\nThe relationship between the private service sector share and log per capita income is \nalmost the same as the relationship seen in Figure 5 including a possible turning point for the \nservice  sector  share  in  GPP  at  high  per  capita  income  levels.  This  confirms  that  government \nservices  such  as  public  administration,  defense,  and  compulsory  social  security  play  a  lesser \nrole in per capita income. Based on the scatter plots, the share of government services in GPP \nhas  a  negative  relationship  with  the  log  of  per  capita  income.

Wholesale  and  retail  trade  in  Thailand  is \naround  10%\u201320%  of  GPP  which  indicates  two  waves  of  growth,  but  including  street  vendors \nand  flea  market  merchants  from  the  informal  economy  would  make  the  data  more  complete. \nThe  relationship  between  construction  and  income  is  linked  to  the  stability  of  Thailand\u2019s  real \nestate  and  infrastructure.  The  plots  indicate  that  returns  from  construction  must  increase  in \norder  for  income  to  increase  in  each  middle-income  province.  From  the  estimates,  wholesale \nand retail trade and construction are clearly the two waves of service sector growth that imply a \ngrowth engine for the Thai economy.  \n\n \nThe relationship between the share in GPP and per capita income for education services \npredicted by the model is downward sloping. This is completely different from the Group II plots \nin Eichengreen and Gupta. It should be noted that the average annual expenditure on education \nis about B1.2 billion (1988 prices) per province or B1,376 (1988 prices) per person. When the \naverage  GPP  grows  faster  than  the  rate  of  growth  in  expenditures,  the  share  in  GPP  will \ndecrease,  i.e.,  it  will  have  a  negative  relationship  with  per  capita  income.  Educational \nexpenditures  may  be  under-estimated,  especially  for  special  education  services  or  offsite \ntutoring. Agencies involved with education should investigate why this relationship is a converse \none when in most developed countries the relationship is positive.  \n \n\n\f16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nTotal Factor Productivity \n\nB. \n \nAlthough plots for the relationship between the service sector and per capita income indicate the \npossibility  for  service  sector  growth,  the  components  of  its  growth  can  be  determined  by  total \nfactor productivity (TFP). The latest TFP study for Thailand was done in 2009 by the National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  Board.  It  calculated  the  TFP  for  eight  economic  activities: \nagriculture,  mining,  manufacturing,  electricity,  construction,  retail  trade,  transportation,  and \nservices and other activities (NESDB 2009). Among these services, transportation was the most \nsignificant with a positive TFP between 1982 and 2007 except during the 1997 financial crisis. \nThis  may  be  due  to  the  country\u2019s  improvement  in  logistics,  mainly  in  road,  air,  and  sea \ntransportation.  The  TFP  for  retail  trade  is  positive  after  1999  while  for  services  and  other \nactivities it is positive after 2002 (Table 9).  \n\nRevealed Comparative Advantage \n\n \nIt is probable that income from retail trade is more than its recorded high as income from \nthe informal economy is not recorded. Although TFP indices have been positive in services and \nin  other  activities  since  2002,  the  reason  is  still  unclear  because  the  activities  have  been \ncumulated.  It  indicates  only  a  reason  for  growth;  if  it  continues,  we  may  expect  a  real  turning \npoint in service sector growth.  In terms of TFP, retail trade and transportation should be major \nservice activities for Thai economic growth.  \n \nC. \n \nAlthough trade in services and FDI implies high levels of openness in Thailand\u2019s service sector, \nit  does  not  imply  anything  about  competitiveness.  If  countries  have  information  about  their \ncompetitiveness in trade and investment, they can better implement trade policies and negotiate \nsuitable  agreements.  Using  the  revealed  comparative  advantage  (RCA)  index8 established  by \nBalassa (1965), important service activities in Thailand were examined. If the RCA for a service \nis greater than 1, it means that country has a level of competitiveness above the world average \nand a comparative advantage in that service. The opposite is true for an RCA less than 1. If any \nservices  in  Thailand  have  a  comparative  advantage,  Thailand  will  gain  from  trade  in  those \nservices, and they could be a growth engine for the Thai economy. \n \n\nRCAs  were  calculated  for  selected  economies  using  the  WTO  International  Trade \nStatistics  on  commercial  services  including  transportation,  tourism  and  travel,  and  other \nservices such as business services. Table 10 presents the RCAs for these services from 1990 \nto 2009. \n \nIn  transportation  among  selected  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nation  (ASEAN) \nmembers,  only  Singapore  consistently  maintained  a  comparative  advantage  throughout  the \ndecade.  This  is  related  to  the  fact  that  the  country  has  been  a  hub  for  both  sea  and  air \ntransportation.  Hong  Kong,  China;  Japan;  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  also  maintained \ncomparative advantages in transportation.   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n8   RCAs were estimated using the following steps. (i) Divide the value of the service exports under consideration by \nthe value of total exports for the country. (ii) Calculate the portion of the total value of those service exports in the \nworld divided by the value of total exports in the world. (iii) Divide (i) by (ii).  \n\n\fA Turning Point for the Service Sector in Thailand   \u0406   17 \n\nTable 9: Total Factor Productivity in Construction, Retail Trade, Transportation, and Services and Other Activities \n \n\nRetail Trade\n\nPeriod \n1982\u20131986 \n1987\u20131991 \n1992\u20131996 \n1997\u20131998 \n1999\u20132001 \n2002\u20132006 \n2007 \nAverage 1982\u20132007 \n\nPeriod \n1982\u20131986 \n1987\u20131991 \n1992\u20131996 \n1997\u20131998 \n1999\u20132001 \n2002\u20132006 \n2007 \nAverage 1982\u20132007 \n\nGDP\n\n6.2 \n17.3 \n8.3 \n\u201331.9 \n\u20135.3 \n5.1 \n2.0 \n4.1 \n\nGDP\n\n8.9 \n11.4 \n11.1 \n\u20132.2 \n6.8 \n5.6 \n6.0 \n8.0 \n\nConstruction\n\nLabor\n3.0 \n8.8 \n4.6 \n\u20138.2 \n1.2 \n2.7 \n0.0 \n3.2 \nTransportation\n\nCapital\n4.1 \n10.3 \n12.6 \n\u20131.8 \n0.9 \n1.9 \n2.7 \n5.6 \n\nLabor\n2.2 \n1.8 \n0.8 \n\u20130.3 \n0.5 \n0.2 \n\u20130.3 \n0.1 \n\nCapital\n2.8 \n6.8 \n10.1 \n4.4 \n1.7 \n2.2 \n2.6 \n4.9 \n\nTFP\n\u20130.9 \n\u20131.8 \n\u20138.9 \n\u201321.9 \n\u20137.4 \n0.5 \n\u20130.5 \n\u20134.7 \n\nTFP\n\n3.9 \n2.8 \n0.3 \n\u20136.3 \n4.6 \n3.3 \n3.8 \n2.2 \n\nGDP\n3.2 \n12.0 \n6.7 \n\u20138.1 \n2.0 \n3.6 \n3.2 \n4.7 \n\nGDP\n6.1 \n8.2 \n4.4 \n\u20135.2 \n\u20130.8 \n5.9 \n4.0 \n4.4 \n\nServices and Other Activities\n\nLabor\n0.6 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n0.0 \n0.3 \n0.5 \n2.1 \n0.4 \n\nLabor\n8.9 \n3.8 \n1.1 \n1.5 \n4.5 \n1.1 \n2.2 \n5.1 \n\nCapital\n3.1 \n9.1 \n9.4 \n0.2 \n\u20130.6 \n1.2 \n2.1 \n4.4 \n\nCapital\n2.4 \n3.3 \n4.9 \n1.3 \n0.0 \n0.6 \n0.9 \n2.3 \n\nTFP\n\u20130.5 \n2.1 \n\u20133.4 \n\u20138.4 \n2.3 \n2.0 \n0.9 \n\u20130.3 \n\nTFP\n\u20135.2 \n1.1 \n\u20131.6 \n\u20138.0 \n\u20135.4 \n4.2 \n0.9 \n\u20133.0 \n\nNote: GDP = gross domestic product, TFP= total factor productivity. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations. \n \n\n \n\n\f18   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nTable 10: Revealed Comparative Advantages in Services in Selected Economies, 1990\u20132009 \n \nTourism and Travel Related\n\n2009\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2005 \n\n2009\n\n1990\n\n1990 \n\nTransportation\n2005\n2000\n\nOther Services\n2005\n2000\n\nEconomy \n\nASEAN \nBrunei Darussalam \nCambodia \nIndonesia \nLao PDR \nMalaysia \nMyanmar \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nThailand \nOther Asian Economies \nPRC \nHong Kong, China \nRep. of Korea \nIndia \nTaipei,China \nDeveloped Economies \nAustralia \nCanada \nEU-27 \nJapan \nNew Zealand \nRussian Federation \nUnited States \n\n- \n- \n0.10 \n2.61 \n1.11 \n0.36 \n0.30 \n0.61 \n0.74 \n\n1.65 \n1.35 \n1.21 \n0.73 \n1.17 \n\n1.24 \n0.80 \n0.00 \n1.50 \n1.52 \n\u2013 \n0.98 \n\n0.00 \n0.72 \n0.00 \n0.56 \n0.86 \n0.71 \n0.59 \n1.77 \n1.00 \n\n0.52 \n1.35 \n1.96 \n0.53 \n0.88 \n\n0.95 \n0.82 \n0.98 \n1.57 \n1.19 \n1.58 \n0.77 \n\n2.19 \n0.51 \n0.97 \n0.67 \n0.90 \n2.17 \n0.92 \n1.54 \n1.00 \n\n0.90 \n1.37 \n2.35 \n0.47 \n1.00 \n\n0.87 \n0.77 \n0.96 \n1.51 \n0.85 \n1.59 \n0.74 \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n1.59 \n0.90 \n\n- \n1.37 \n2.37 \n- \n0.83 \n\n0.62 \n0.76 \n0.99 \n1.19 \n0.00 \n\u2013 \n0.72 \n\n- \n- \n2.55 \n0.72 \n1.32 \n0.62 \n0.47 \n1.08 \n2.03 \n\n0.89 \n0.87 \n1.02 \n1.00 \n0.74 \n\n1.27 \n1.02 \n- \n0.26 \n1.26 \n\u2013 \n1.12 \n\n0.00 \n2.25 \n3.08 \n2.38 \n1.14 \n1.11 \n2.00 \n0.57 \n1.70 \n\n1.69 \n0.46 \n0.72 \n0.68 \n0.59 \n\n1.50 \n0.86 \n0.96 \n0.20 \n1.63 \n1.12 \n1.10 \n\n1.12 \n2.85 \n1.30 \n2.65 \n1.64 \n2.03 \n1.81 \n0.42 \n1.73 \n\n1.43 \n0.58 \n0.48 \n0.52 \n0.70 \n\n2.00 \n0.91 \n0.91 \n0.23 \n2.19 \n0.86 \n1.02 \n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n0.48 \n1.96 \n\n- \n0.74 \n0.61 \n- \n0.87 \n\n2.41 \n0.94 \n0.87 \n0.32 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n0.95 \n\n- \n- \n0.28 \n0.02 \n0.63 \n1.84 \n2.01 \n1.23 \n0.27 \n\n0.61 \n0.86 \n0.82 \n1.21 \n1.10 \n\n- \n1.10 \n- \n1.29 \n0.30 \n\u2013 \n0.90 \n\n0.00 \n0.25 \n0.04 \n0.25 \n0.97 \n1.08 \n0.50 \n0.90 \n0.50 \n\n0.76 \n1.20 \n0.70 \n1.48 \n1.36 \n\n- \n1.20 \n1.00 \n1.27 \n0.40 \n0.61 \n1.00 \n\n0.37 \n0.19 \n0.84 \n0.22 \n0.69 \n0.43 \n0.58 \n1.07 \n0.59 \n\n0.80 \n1.06 \n0.65 \n1.52 \n1.17 \n\n- \n1.10 \n1.00 \n1.19 \n0.40 \n0.80 \n1.10 \n\n2009\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n1.02 \n0.57 \n\n- \n0.98 \n0.64 \n- \n1.13 \n\n- \n1.10 \n1.00 \n1.25 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n1.10 \n\nNote: \"\u2013\" means data not available; ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; EU-27 =  European Union, comprising Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, \nSpain, Sweden, United Kingdom; Lao PDR=Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Author's calculations using data from the World Trade Organization International Trade Statistics. \n\n \n\n\fA Turning Point for the Service Sector in Thailand   \u0406   19 \n\nIn  contrast,  the  ASEAN  countries  had  comparative  advantages  in  tourism  and  travel-\nrelated services except for Singapore. Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (US) also \nhad  comparative  advantages  in  travel  while  in  the  East  Asian  economies,  only  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China did. As expected, Canada, the European Union, and the US had comparative \nadvantages in other services since they generate  significant income from intellectual property. \nHong  Kong,  China;  India;  Singapore;  and  Taipei,China  also  had  comparative  advantages  in \nthese industries while other Asian countries including Thailand had comparative disadvantages. \nHoekman  and  Mattoo  (2008)  noted  that  India  has  shifted  from  \u201clow-end,  back-office  services\u201d \nsuch  as  data  management,  to  \u201chigh-end  services\u201d  like  customer  relations,  human  resource \nmanagement,  and  product  development  and  hypothesized  that  large  numbers  of  educated \npeople support the country\u2019s development. \n\n \nThe  competitiveness  of  Thailand\u2019s  service  sector  therefore  depends  mainly  on  tourism \nand travel as the RCA was greater than 1 throughout the decade. For transportation, although \nThailand\u2019s  Suvannabhumi  International  Airport  opened  in  2006,  the  RCA  decreased  slightly \nwhich is related to the fact that Thailand\u2019s marine transportation still needs attention. In addition, \nstrategic action plans for logistics are also required \n \nD. \n \nThis  research  demonstrates  that  the  service  sector  is  a  growth  engine  for  the  Thai  economy. \nThe possible turning point is shown in Figure 5. The following are policy recommendations for \nservice  activities  with  positive  TFP  indicators  or  an  RCA  greater  than  1,  namely  construction, \nwholesale and retail trade, transportation, and tourism and travel.   \n\nPolicy Recommendations \n\nAn  unambiguous,  politically  independent,  national  development  plan.  Figure  1  and \nFigure 5  indicate  that  the  service  sector  is  undergoing  a  structural  transition.  After  the  1997 \nfinancial crisis, the significance of manufacturing in GDP increased while the service sector has \nbeen  in  transition.  Before  2009,  there  was  no  national  strategic  plan  for  Thailand\u2019s  service \nsector, and the politics of the current (Yingluck) government have made implementing the plan \n(developed after 2009) difficult. Increasing the minimum wage to B300 a day (about 40%) wiped \nout  several  labor-intensive  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  In  addition,  the  current \ngovernment  does  not  pay  much  attention  to  the  concept  of  a  creative  economy  that \nconcentrates  on  service  sector  development  because  that  concept  was  initiated  by  the  former \ngovernment.  Thailand  needs  an  unambiguous,  politically  independent  national  plan  for  the \nservice  sector  that  is  sensibly  crafted  and  amenable  to  economic  and  social  changes  like \npopulation  aging  and  the  country\u2019s  role  in  the  Asian  Economic  Community  (AEC).  In  addition, \nthe national policy should incorporate objectives for decreasing the deficit in service trade and \nfor attracting FDI in infrastructure.  \n\n \nAs shown in Table 5, tourism and travel-related activities are the only ones that generate \na  surplus  in  service  trade.  As  stated  in  the  report  by  the  Thailand  Development  Research \nInstitute  Foundation  (2009),  many  service  activities  have  increased  their  deficits  over  the  past \n15  years,  for  example,  royalties  and  licensing  fees,  freight,  and  other  transportation.  This \nindicates  the  reliance  of  the  Thai  industrial  structure  on  external  technology.  To  reduce  the \ndeficits,  knowledge  and  innovation  must  be  upgraded.  Also,  as  shown  in  Table  6,  Thailand \nneeds  more  FDI  in  infrastructure  such  as  electricity,  water,  telecommunications,  and \ntransportation.  These  investments  will  generate  complementary  economic  growth  throughout \nthe country. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nRevised  data  collection  methods.  As  discussed,  Thailand  has  several  definitions  for  the \nservice  sector,  and  agencies  collect  data  for  different  purposes,  which  creates  complexities. \nThailand should start revising its system of data collection in as much detail as possible to make \nservice  data  and  classification  methods  comparable  to  those  of  other  countries.  The  revised \nsystem should gather data horizontally and vertically and include regional and provincial data. \nInformal  service  activities  such  as  street  vending,  driving  taxis,  and  offsite  tutoring  should  be \ncollected and included in estimates. \n\nAreas  and  services  with  potential. The scatter plots of the relationship between the service \nsector share in GPP and log per capita income by region show decreasing trends in the north, \nnortheast,  and  center  which  indicates  that  there  is  no  single  policy  for  developing  the  sector \n(Figure  7a).  Regions  in  which  service  activity  should  potentially  be  stimulated  are  provinces \naround Bangkok, those in the east, and those in the south. A closer look at selected provinces \nconfirms  that  boosting  service  activities  in  Bangkok  and  Phuket  should  be  a  priority  over \nsupporting those in Chiang Mai (Figure 7b).  \n\n \n \nFigure 7a: Scatter Plot of the Service Share of Gross Provincial Product \nand Log per capita Income \n \n\nBangkok and vicinity\n\nNortheastern\n\nNorth\n\nSouth\n\nWest\n\nCentral\n\nEastern\n\nTotal\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nLog of per capita income\n\n \n\nGPP = gross provincial product. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nP\nP\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\nr\na\nh\ns\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\ns\n \ns\ne\nc\nv\nr\ne\nS\n\ni\n\n\fA Turning Point for the Service Sector in Thailand   \u0406   21 \n\nFigure 7b: Scatter Plot for Selected Provinces \n \n\nP\nP\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\nr\na\nh\nS\n\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\nS\n \ns\ne\nc\nv\nr\ne\nS\n\ni\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n10\n\n10.5\n\n11\n\n11.5\n\n12\n\nLog of per capita income\n\nBangkok       Chiang Mai       Phuket\n\n \n\n \n\nGPP = gross provincial product. \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n\n \n \nThis  research  shows  that  construction,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  transportation,  and  tourism \nand travel-related activities should be gradually promoted in both public and private agencies to \nadvance economic growth. For wholesale and retail trade, the data indicate that there are both \nformal  and  informal  sectors.  Despite  studying  only  the  formal  sector,  it  was  evident  that \nwholesale and retail trade is a growth engine and that Thailand should continue to support it to \nreduce  transaction  costs  from  producers  to  consumers.  Since  wholesale  and  retail  trade  in \nThailand  is  labor-intensive,  the  country  should  prepare  for  the  AEC  labor  movement  and  its \nimpacts.  Transportation  and  construction  support  other  economic  activities,  so  decreasing  the \ncost of these services could benefit the country as a whole. The government should make it a \npolicy to upgrade these services. \n \n\nThe RCA index confirmed the importance of tourism and travel in the Thai economy in \nterms of generating income and jobs. Agencies should continue to promote different aspects of \ntourism such as medical, long-stay, and cultural tourism and should develop information support \nand systems for tourists. Thailand should consider revising its tourism industry especially with a \nview  to  sustainable  development.  The  government  should  study  how  to  optimize  the  types  of \ntourists and the income they generate rather than simply maximizing their numbers.  \n\n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nThe service sector is important in the Thai economy as it accounts for about half of the national \nGDP  and  employs  more  than  40%  of  the  labor  force.  Among  services,  wholesale  and  retail \ntrade,  transportation,  and  tourism  and  travel-related  activities  are  the  largest  contributors  to \nGDP  and  maintain  significant  shares  in  employment.  A  major  problem  with  Thailand\u2019s  service \nsector is the classification method used as most data from agencies are still in ISIC revision 3 or \nin a format that can be used for only routine reports, not for research. Even though two major \n\n\f22   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \n\nThai  agencies\u2014the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  and  the  Bank  of \nThailand\u2014released  relevant  data  in  April  2012  using  ISIC  revision  4,  the  data  covers  only  1 \nyear or present the new set of GDP with chain value measures. This study suggests revising the \ndata  collection  format  taking  into  account  Thailand\u2019s  strategies  for  high  economic  growth  and \nhigh volume in international trade.   \n \n\nThe  Thailand  Development  Research  Institute  Foundation  (2009)  reported  that  labor \nproductivity in the sector is low possibly because the sector is very labor intensive. This study \nexamined  the  relationship  between  the  service  sector  share  of  GPP  and  per  capita  income  in \norder to determine a possible turning point. Estimates from the study indicate that there are two \nwaves: lower-income provinces use services as a growth engine, but middle-income provinces \ndo not. Higher-income provinces (specifically the seven highest) have shown the potential for a \npossible turning point in which the service sector could function as a growth engine. As growth \nin services comes from growth in both the private and the public sectors, the government should \nsupport  the  private  sector  with  unambiguous  policies  suitable  for  each  region  and  province. \nBased  on  this  study,  Thailand  should  continue  to  promote  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  tourism \nand travel-related activities, transportation, and construction. These activities demonstrate one \nor more of the following: two clear waves in their share in GPP (wholesale and retail trade and \nconstruction); positive TFP indices (retail trade and transportation); and an RCA greater than 1 \n(tourism and travel-related activities). Because of comparative disadvantages in other services, \nespecially royalties and licensing, communication, and insurance, Thailand needs to upgrade its \nindustrial  and  service  structures.  Education  services  need  special  attention  because  of  their \ndeclining trend in the share of services compared with the situation in developed countries.  \u2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES \n \nBalassa, B. 1965.

Using estimates from a fixed-effects model, the study confirms two \nwaves of growth. In addition, total factor productivity and revealed comparative advantages are also discussed \nto determine the significant role of services and some service activities. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.7 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 828 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration.\n \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region.
