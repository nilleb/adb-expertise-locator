INTRODUCTION \n \nAs is true in every newly industrializing economy, the economy of Thailand is mixed. Decisions \nregarding the production of goods and services are made in both the private and public sectors. \nFrom the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, Thailand experienced significant economic growth. \nBetween 1980 and 1990, the average growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) was about \n7.6%, and the growth of exports was around 14%. Between 1990 and 1995, average growth in \nreal GDP reached 8.4%, and average export growth was 14.2% (Salvatore 2011). Since 2000, \nhowever, Thailand has had an average real GDP growth of only about 4%. While Thailand is \nwidely perceived as an economically developing country led by agricultural exports, the majority \nof the country\u2019s income is driven by the manufacturing and the service sectors. Since 1993, the \nagriculture sector has contributed only 300\u2013400 billion baht (B) per year to Thailand\u2019s real GDP \nwhile in 2009, the service sector generated about B2 trillion or almost 50% of GDP mostly from \nprivate sector services (Table 1). \n \nBased on this pattern, the Thai economy is in the first phase of economic development. \nAfter resources shift from agriculture to manufacturing, there will be a final shift to tertiary \nproduction or services (Fisher 1939, Clark 1940). This paper analyzes the status of Thailand\u2019s \nservice sector and investigates whether it is a growth engine for the economy. \n \n \nII. BASIC FACTS  \n \nBecause the service sector is highly diverse, ranging from low-end services such as street \nvendors to high-end services in the financial and professional sectors, a clear definition is \nrequired.   \n \nA.  What is Thailand\u2019s Service Sector? \n \nLike every country, Thailand has several definitions of services depending on derivation and \nterms of use. The National Economic and Social Development Board of Thailand defines the \nservice sector as all economic activities except for those in the agriculture, manufacturing, and \nmining and quarrying sectors.1 Using this broad concept, Thailand defines its service sector as \ncomprising no fewer than a dozen economic activities. Since 1991, the General Agreement on \nTrade in Services (GATS) has offered a different definition of the service sector and has \npublished a service sector classification list (WTO 1995) that has become the standard for \nacademics  and  scholars.  A  third  classification  method  is  the  balance  of  payments,  an \nInternational Monetary Fund definition used mainly for international trade and finance statistics.  \n \nBecause the National Economic and Social Development Board and GATS propose \ndifferent definitions of the service sector, researchers and policymakers have a more difficult \ntime  studying  service  activities.  For  example,  the  national  definition  classifies  hotels  and \nrestaurants as major service activities whereas the GATS recognizes each as services within \ntourism and travel (Table 2). Multiple definitions make data collection and systematic analysis \ndifficult which in turn generates high transaction costs when researchers and policymakers need \nmore information about particular services such as tourism or recreational services. \n \n                                                 \n1   This  is  the  International  Standard  Industrial  Classification  of  All  Economic  Activities  (ISIC)  for  objectively \nclassifying economic data.

Size, Growth, and Composition \n \nThe World Factbook records that in 2011 the Thai economy (measured by current GDP under \nthe official exchange rate) was estimated at about $345.6 billion. Using the purchasing power \nparity method, Thailand\u2019s economy was estimated at about $601.4 billion which ranked it 25th \namong  226  countries.  Thailand  is  an  upper-middle  income  country,  and  its  economy  is \ncomprised  mainly  of  the  agriculture,  manufacturing,  and  service  sectors  which  contributed \napproximately 13.3%, 34%, and 52.7%, respectively to the GDP (CIA 2012). Thailand\u2019s service \nsector has long been viewed as an indicator of economic development. Over the past few \ndecades, the significance of the service and manufacturing sectors in terms of real GDP has \nincreased steadily while the share of real GDP derived from the agriculture sector has become \nless important. Among the three major sectors, the service sector has contributed the largest \npercentage to the country\u2019s GDP since 1993 (Figure 1).  \n \nFigure 1: Sector Share in GDP \n \n60\n50\n40\n% 30\n20\n10\n0\n1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009\nAgriculture Manufacturing Services  \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. ", "4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \nThailand\u2019s  service  sector  contributed  from  0.6  percentage  points  to  3.4  percentage \npoints to GDP growth from 1993 to 2009 except in 1998 to 2002 after the Asian financial crisis \nand  again  in  2009  while  manufacturing  contributed  about  1.1  percentage  points  to  3.9 \npercentage points from 1993 to 2008 (Table 3). The agriculture sector has played a smaller role \nin growth and income as its share in GDP stabilized at around 10% during the study period \ncontributing  less  than  0.5  percentage  points  to  GDP  growth.  Although  the  service  sector \ncontributed substantially to GDP growth from 1993 to 2008, over time its share in GDP seemed \nto shrink while the opposite was true for the share of the manufacturing sector. Figure 1 \nillustrates these trends. This reflects the changing nature of the Thai economy. Diminishing \nagricultural production implies that to some extent the country has developed according to the \nstructural  change  model  of  shifting  from  agriculture  to manufacturing  to services.  Whether \nThailand is currently at the secondary or tertiary stage is still unclear. \n \nLike  the  share  of  the  service  sector  in  GDP,  the  share  in  employment  has  been \nparamount since 2003 and in 2010 provided work for about 18 million people (Table 4). The \ntrends in the shares in GDP and in employment are, however, moving in opposite directions as \nthe  former  is  decreasing  while  the  latter  is  increasing.  In  contrast,  the  labor  force  in  the \nagriculture  sector  has  fluctuated  from  1998  to  2010  but  since  2008  has  shown  signs  of \ndecreasing in both size and in share of employment. While the manufacturing sector, as noted \npreviously has increased its share in GDP, its share in employment has remained stable at \nabout 15%. The average wage paid in services has, however, been higher than the average \nwage paid in the other two sectors (Figure 2). \n \nIn order to evaluate the relative importance of individual services, the share of each \nservice industry in sector output from 1993 to 2009 is plotted in Figure 3. The most outstanding \nservice  industry  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  GDP  is  wholesale  and  retail  trade2 which \ncontributed as much as 14% of the total in 2009 or about 28% of the total service contribution. \nTransportation, storage, and communications ranked second contributing 9.7% of total GDP in \n2009 or 19% of total service output. From an employment perspective, wholesale and retail \ntrade was again the most significant, generating jobs for about 6 million people in 2009. Hotels \nand restaurants (2.7 million jobs); construction (2.4 million); public administration, defense, and \nsocial  security  (1.5  million);  and  education  (1.2  million)  were  also  important  sources  of \nemployment. Wholesale and retail trade thus appears to be the most significant service in the \nThai economy as it provided the largest contribution to the GDP and generated the most \nemployment.3 \n \n                                                 \n2   Wholesale and retail trade includes repairing motor vehicles and motorcycles as well as personal and household \ngoods. \n3   Street vendors and flea market merchants are becoming significant as the government promotes small and \nmedium-sized enterprises and labor shifts from the agriculture sector to the service sector.

Based on the information in Figure 1 and the World Factbook, starting in \n2009 we can observe a turning point where the shares of the manufacturing sector decrease \nand those of the service sector increase.   \n \nC.  Trade and Investment  \n \nFrom 2005 to 2010, Thailand had a trade deficit in services averaging about $8.9 billion that \ngrew to almost $10 billion in 2011 (Table 5). In addition to transportation, royalties and licensing, \ncommunication services, and insurance services have caused the majority of the deficit while \ntravel services have been the major positive component since 2005. It is noteworthy that in \n2010, the hotel and restaurant industry ranked second in employment in part due to the tourism \nindustry. According to the Thomas White International website, in 2007, tourism and travel in \nThailand contributed a staggering 6% of total GDP, more than in any other Asian nation. This \nconcurs with data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) Service Profiles that show that in \n2010 Thailand received a positive net trade balance of payments in travel equal to $14.644 \nmillion  which  ranked  it  first  among  the  Asian  countries  studied.  Moreover,  Bangkok,  has \nreceived \"The World's Best City Award\" for four consecutive years (2010\u20132013) in Travel & \nLeisure.   \n \nThailand\u2019s inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in the service sector from 2005 to 2011 \naveraged $3 billion with a peak in 2007 of about $3.8 billion. The majority was in financial \nintermediation and real estate at about 88% of gross annual FDI (Table 6). Thailand\u2019s sector \nhas shown significant openness to trade in services by welcoming foreign investment. \n \n \n \nIII. SHARE OF OUTPUT MODEL \n \nBased on the framework in Eichengreen and Gupta (2009), the relationship between the share \nof output in the service sector and per capita income in Thailand was examined using provincial \ndata  for  the  first  time.  Data  for  this  study  came  from  the  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Board\u2019s gross regional and provincial product (GPP). Provincial data are from 76 \nprovinces  and  include  16  economic  activities  classified  under  the  International  Standard \nIndustrial Classification Revision 3 and are available from 1995 to 2009.

The plots are shown in Figure 4 in four categories. Plot (1) displays all provinces \nexcept Bangkok and vicinity and Phuket. The relationship appears wave-like with an increasing \ntrend in the service share when income is low and a decreasing trend when income is high. This \nrelationship differs from a major assumption in economic development: the service sector grows \nas income increases.

Although Phuket and Bangkok seem to be \noutliers in our model, by including these outliers plot (4) still maintains a wave-like shape. \nTherefore the panel data model uses 76 provinces from 1995 to 2009 with a total of 1,140 \nobservations and hypothesizes the wave-like shape as shown in Figure 4 plot (4).

The service share \nof output generally decreases as income increases except for the lowest and the highest \nincome groups. This information is relevant to the fact stated in Figure 1.

Figure  5  displays  information  that  is  especially \nimportant for Thailand.  \n \n\uf0b7  After a first turning point, provinces will experience a reduced service share in GPP as \nincomes move toward higher levels. Moreover, per capita income in the bottom 10% is \nlog per capita income less than 9.516 which is equal to per capita income of B13,577 a \nyear (1988 prices). All of the lower per capita income provinces are located in the \nnortheastern region.6  \n\uf0b7  The high-income provinces have two distinct relationship patterns that could explain why \nthe service sector is a growth engine.   \n\uf0b7  The first possible turning point for the estimates in model II occurs when per capita \nincome in the highest 8% of the population is equal to the log per capita of income \ngreater than 12 and equals per capita income of B163,169 a year (1988 prices).  There \nare only seven provinces7 with these characteristics. They contain industrial parks and \nare either near the capital or a marine port.  In this model, the service sector would be a \ngrowth engine for the Thai economy. \n\uf0b7  For the base case, our estimates show the possible turning point would be a point after \nlog per capita income greater than 13, or per capita income greater than B442,000 per \nyear (1988 prices). In the base case, the Thai economy would depend mainly upon the \nmanufacturing sector rather than services for growth. \n \n \nIV. TOWARD A POSSIBLE TURNING POINT \n \nA.  Share of Output Model Revisited \n \nThailand\u2019s service sector could potentially experience a second wave of growth, particularly in \nhigh-income provinces near Bangkok. In this section, specific service activities are investigated \nin order to offer public policy advice. The service sector is then assessed comparing model II \nwith the dependent variables of private service sector results and 12 other service activities. \nBefore  doing  so,  data  on  12  service  activities  were  tested  in  scatter  plots  to  reveal  the \nrelationship between the share of the GPP and log per capita income. The plots indicated that \neach service activity may not be evidence for a quartic function and also has several outlying \npoints. Therefore, estimating the share of each service in GPP using the model discussed \nabove is not statistically significant except for wholesale and retail trade, construction, and \neducation. \n \nThe relationship between the private service sector share and log per capita income is \nalmost the same as the relationship seen in Figure 5 including a possible turning point for the \nservice sector share in GPP at high per capita income levels. This confirms that government \nservices such as public administration, defense, and compulsory social security play a lesser \nrole in per capita income. Based on the scatter plots, the share of government services in GPP \nhas  a  negative  relationship  with  the  log  of  per  capita  income.  Construction  and  related \nengineering services and wholesale and retail trade have a positive relationship between the \n                                                 \n6   The lowest per capita incomes are in Amnatcharoen, Buriram, Chaiyaphum, Kalasin, Mahasarakham, Mukdahan, \nNakhonphanom, Nongbualamphu, Roi-et, Sakonnakhon, Sisaket, Surin, and Yasothon. \n7   Those  are  Chachoengsao,  Chonburi,  and  Rayong  in  the  eastern  region;  Pathumthani,  Samutsakhon, \nSamutprakan in the Bangkok metropolitan area; and Phranakhonsriayuthaya in the central region.

Wholesale and retail trade in Thailand is \naround 10%\u201320% of GPP which indicates two waves of growth, but including street vendors \nand flea market merchants from the informal economy would make the data more complete. \nThe relationship between construction and income is linked to the stability of Thailand\u2019s real \nestate and infrastructure. The plots indicate that returns from construction must increase in \norder for income to increase in each middle-income province. From the estimates, wholesale \nand retail trade and construction are clearly the two waves of service sector growth that imply a \ngrowth engine for the Thai economy.  \n \nThe relationship between the share in GPP and per capita income for education services \npredicted by the model is downward sloping. This is completely different from the Group II plots \nin Eichengreen and Gupta. It should be noted that the average annual expenditure on education \nis about B1.2 billion (1988 prices) per province or B1,376 (1988 prices) per person. When the \naverage GPP grows faster than the rate of growth in expenditures, the share in GPP will \ndecrease,  i.e.,  it  will  have  a  negative  relationship  with  per  capita  income.  Educational \nexpenditures  may  be  under-estimated,  especially  for  special  education  services  or  offsite \ntutoring. Agencies involved with education should investigate why this relationship is a converse \none when in most developed countries the relationship is positive.  \n ", "16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \nB.  Total Factor Productivity \n \nAlthough plots for the relationship between the service sector and per capita income indicate the \npossibility for service sector growth, the components of its growth can be determined by total \nfactor productivity (TFP). The latest TFP study for Thailand was done in 2009 by the National \nEconomic and Social Development Board. It calculated the TFP for eight economic activities: \nagriculture,  mining,  manufacturing,  electricity,  construction,  retail  trade,  transportation,  and \nservices and other activities (NESDB 2009). Among these services, transportation was the most \nsignificant with a positive TFP between 1982 and 2007 except during the 1997 financial crisis. \nThis  may  be  due  to  the  country\u2019s  improvement  in  logistics,  mainly  in  road,  air,  and  sea \ntransportation. The TFP for retail trade is positive after 1999 while for services and other \nactivities it is positive after 2002 (Table 9).  \n \nIt is probable that income from retail trade is more than its recorded high as income from \nthe informal economy is not recorded. Although TFP indices have been positive in services and \nin other activities since 2002, the reason is still unclear because the activities have been \ncumulated. It indicates only a reason for growth; if it continues, we may expect a real turning \npoint in service sector growth.  In terms of TFP, retail trade and transportation should be major \nservice activities for Thai economic growth.  \n \nC.  Revealed Comparative Advantage \n \nAlthough trade in services and FDI implies high levels of openness in Thailand\u2019s service sector, \nit does not imply anything about competitiveness. If countries have information about their \ncompetitiveness in trade and investment, they can better implement trade policies and negotiate \nsuitable agreements. Using the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index8 established by \nBalassa (1965), important service activities in Thailand were examined. If the RCA for a service \nis greater than 1, it means that country has a level of competitiveness above the world average \nand a comparative advantage in that service. The opposite is true for an RCA less than 1. If any \nservices in Thailand have a comparative advantage, Thailand will gain from trade in those \nservices, and they could be a growth engine for the Thai economy. \n \nRCAs  were  calculated  for  selected  economies  using  the  WTO  International  Trade \nStatistics  on  commercial  services  including  transportation,  tourism  and  travel,  and  other \nservices such as business services. Table 10 presents the RCAs for these services from 1990 \nto 2009. \n \nIn  transportation  among  selected  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nation  (ASEAN) \nmembers, only Singapore consistently maintained a comparative advantage throughout the \ndecade. This is related to the fact that the country has been a hub for both sea and air \ntransportation.  Hong  Kong,  China;  Japan;  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  also  maintained \ncomparative advantages in transportation.   \n \n                                                 \n8   RCAs were estimated using the following steps.

Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (US) also \nhad comparative advantages in travel while in the East Asian economies, only the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China did. As expected, Canada, the European Union, and the US had comparative \nadvantages in other services since they generate significant income from intellectual property. \nHong Kong, China; India; Singapore; and Taipei,China also had comparative advantages in \nthese industries while other Asian countries including Thailand had comparative disadvantages. \nHoekman and Mattoo (2008) noted that India has shifted from \u201clow-end, back-office services\u201d \nsuch as data management, to \u201chigh-end services\u201d like customer relations, human resource \nmanagement, and product development and hypothesized that large numbers of educated \npeople support the country\u2019s development. \n \nThe competitiveness of Thailand\u2019s service sector therefore depends mainly on tourism \nand travel as the RCA was greater than 1 throughout the decade. For transportation, although \nThailand\u2019s Suvannabhumi International Airport opened in 2006, the RCA decreased slightly \nwhich is related to the fact that Thailand\u2019s marine transportation still needs attention. In addition, \nstrategic action plans for logistics are also required \n \nD.  Policy Recommendations \n \nThis research demonstrates that the service sector is a growth engine for the Thai economy. \nThe possible turning point is shown in Figure 5. The following are policy recommendations for \nservice activities with positive TFP indicators or an RCA greater than 1, namely construction, \nwholesale and retail trade, transportation, and tourism and travel.   \n \nAn  unambiguous,  politically  independent,  national  development  plan.  Figure  1  and \nFigure 5 indicate that the service sector is undergoing a structural transition. After the 1997 \nfinancial crisis, the significance of manufacturing in GDP increased while the service sector has \nbeen in transition. Before 2009, there was no national strategic plan for Thailand\u2019s service \nsector, and the politics of the current (Yingluck) government have made implementing the plan \n(developed after 2009) difficult. Increasing the minimum wage to B300 a day (about 40%) wiped \nout  several  labor-intensive  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  In  addition,  the  current \ngovernment  does  not  pay  much  attention  to  the  concept  of  a  creative  economy  that \nconcentrates on service sector development because that concept was initiated by the former \ngovernment.  Thailand  needs  an  unambiguous,  politically  independent  national  plan  for  the \nservice sector that is sensibly crafted and amenable to economic and social changes like \npopulation aging and the country\u2019s role in the Asian Economic Community (AEC). In addition, \nthe national policy should incorporate objectives for decreasing the deficit in service trade and \nfor attracting FDI in infrastructure.  \n \nAs shown in Table 5, tourism and travel-related activities are the only ones that generate \na surplus in service trade. As stated in the report by the Thailand Development Research \nInstitute Foundation (2009), many service activities have increased their deficits over the past \n15  years,  for  example,  royalties  and  licensing  fees,  freight,  and  other  transportation.  This \nindicates the reliance of the Thai industrial structure on external technology. To reduce the \ndeficits, knowledge and innovation must be upgraded. Also, as shown in Table 6, Thailand \nneeds  more  FDI  in  infrastructure  such  as  electricity,  water,  telecommunications,  and \ntransportation. These investments will generate complementary economic growth throughout \nthe country. \n ", "20   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \nRevised  data  collection  methods. As discussed, Thailand has several definitions for the \nservice sector, and agencies collect data for different purposes, which creates complexities. \nThailand should start revising its system of data collection in as much detail as possible to make \nservice data and classification methods comparable to those of other countries. The revised \nsystem should gather data horizontally and vertically and include regional and provincial data. \nInformal service activities such as street vending, driving taxis, and offsite tutoring should be \ncollected and included in estimates. \n \nAreas and services with potential. The scatter plots of the relationship between the service \nsector share in GPP and log per capita income by region show decreasing trends in the north, \nnortheast, and center which indicates that there is no single policy for developing the sector \n(Figure 7a). Regions in which service activity should potentially be stimulated are provinces \naround Bangkok, those in the east, and those in the south. A closer look at selected provinces \nconfirms  that  boosting  service  activities  in  Bangkok  and  Phuket  should  be  a  priority  over \nsupporting those in Chiang Mai (Figure 7b).  \n \n \nFigure 7a: Scatter Plot of the Service Share of Gross Provincial Product \nand Log per capita Income \n \nBangkok and vicinity Northeastern North\n100\n50\n0\nP\nP\nG South West Central\ne of  100\nar\nh\ns\nor  50\nct\ne\ns\ns  0\ne\nc\nvi 9 10 11 12 13\ner Eastern Total\nS\n100\n50\n0\n9 10 11 12 13 9 10 11 12 13\nLog of per capita income  \nGPP = gross provincial product. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n   ", "A Turning Point for the Service Sector in Thailand   \u0406   21 \nFigure 7b: Scatter Plot for Selected Provinces \n \n90\nP\nP\nG 85\nof \ne \nar\nh\nS\nor  80\nct\ne\nS\ns \ne\nc\nvi 75\ner\nS\n70\n10 10.5 11 11.5 12\nLog of per capita income\nBangkok       Chiang Mai       Phuket\n  \nGPP = gross provincial product. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculations using National Economic and Social Development Board data. \n \n \nThis research shows that construction, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and tourism \nand travel-related activities should be gradually promoted in both public and private agencies to \nadvance economic growth. For wholesale and retail trade, the data indicate that there are both \nformal  and  informal  sectors.  Despite  studying  only  the  formal  sector,  it  was  evident  that \nwholesale and retail trade is a growth engine and that Thailand should continue to support it to \nreduce transaction costs from producers to consumers. Since wholesale and retail trade in \nThailand is labor-intensive, the country should prepare for the AEC labor movement and its \nimpacts. Transportation and construction support other economic activities, so decreasing the \ncost of these services could benefit the country as a whole. The government should make it a \npolicy to upgrade these services. \n \nThe RCA index confirmed the importance of tourism and travel in the Thai economy in \nterms of generating income and jobs. Agencies should continue to promote different aspects of \ntourism such as medical, long-stay, and cultural tourism and should develop information support \nand systems for tourists. Thailand should consider revising its tourism industry especially with a \nview to sustainable development. The government should study how to optimize the types of \ntourists and the income they generate rather than simply maximizing their numbers.  \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nThe service sector is important in the Thai economy as it accounts for about half of the national \nGDP and employs more than 40% of the labor force. Among services, wholesale and retail \ntrade, transportation, and tourism and travel-related activities are the largest contributors to \nGDP and maintain significant shares in employment. A major problem with Thailand\u2019s service \nsector is the classification method used as most data from agencies are still in ISIC revision 3 or \nin a format that can be used for only routine reports, not for research. Even though two major ", "22   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 353 \nThai  agencies\u2014the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  and  the  Bank  of \nThailand\u2014released relevant data in April 2012 using ISIC revision 4, the data covers only 1 \nyear or present the new set of GDP with chain value measures. This study suggests revising the \ndata collection format taking into account Thailand\u2019s strategies for high economic growth and \nhigh volume in international trade.   \n \nThe Thailand Development Research Institute Foundation (2009) reported that labor \nproductivity in the sector is low possibly because the sector is very labor intensive. This study \nexamined the relationship between the service sector share of GPP and per capita income in \norder to determine a possible turning point. Estimates from the study indicate that there are two \nwaves: lower-income provinces use services as a growth engine, but middle-income provinces \ndo not. Higher-income provinces (specifically the seven highest) have shown the potential for a \npossible turning point in which the service sector could function as a growth engine. As growth \nin services comes from growth in both the private and the public sectors, the government should \nsupport the private sector with unambiguous policies suitable for each region and province. \nBased on this study, Thailand should continue to promote wholesale and retail trade, tourism \nand travel-related activities, transportation, and construction. These activities demonstrate one \nor more of the following: two clear waves in their share in GPP (wholesale and retail trade and \nconstruction); positive TFP indices (retail trade and transportation); and an RCA greater than 1 \n(tourism and travel-related activities). Because of comparative disadvantages in other services, \nespecially royalties and licensing, communication, and insurance, Thailand needs to upgrade its \nindustrial and service structures. Education services need special attention because of their \ndeclining trend in the share of services compared with the situation in developed countries.  \u2018 \n \n ", " \nREFERENCES \n \nBalassa, B. 1965.
