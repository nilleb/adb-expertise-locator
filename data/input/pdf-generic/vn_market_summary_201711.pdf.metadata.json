Yields shed an average \nof 30 basis points (bps) from the 1-year through the \n7-year maturities, and declined an average of 14 bps for \nmaturities of 10 years and above. As a result, the spread \nbetween the 2-year and 10-year tenors widened from \n136\u00a0bps on 1 September to 142 bps on 31 October. \n\nBucking the trend among its emerging East Asian peers, \nViet Nam saw declining bond yields during the review \nperiod. The rise in yields in advanced economies had little \nimpact on Viet Nam\u2019s yields since domestic investors are \nthe major participants in its bond market. However, the \nunwinding of quantitative easing measures by the United \nStates (US) Federal Reserve and the European Central \nBank, may push bond yields up in the medium-term.\n\nThe decline in yields was also driven by the State Bank \nof Vietnam easing its monetary policy. In July, the central \nbank reduced its policy rates by 25 bps each, which \nbrought the refinancing rate to 6.25% and the discount \nrate to 4.25%. The rate cut was aimed at boosting \neconomic growth following slowing growth in the first half \nof the year. Subsequently, in September, the government \nhas requested the State Bank of Vietnam to lower interest \nrates by 0.5% and to boost lending to achieve the credit \ngrowth target of 21%-22% for this year. Other central \ngovernment and line agencies, including the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment and Ministry of Finance were \nalso directed to speed up the release of funds for public \ninvestments. The government believes that its economic \ngrowth target of 6.7% for this year can be achieved given \nthese additional measures.\n\nIn the third quarter (Q3) of 2017, real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth climbed to 7.5% year-on-year \n(y-o-y) from a revised 6.3% y-o-y hike in the second \nquarter (Q2) of 2017. As a result of the strong economic \nexpansion during the quarter, real GDP growth for the \nJanuary\u2013September period rose to 6.4% y-o-y from \n5.7%\u00a0y-o-y in the first half of the year, closing the gap with \nthe government\u2019s full-year 2017 economic growth target. \n\nViet Nam\u2003127\n\nFigure 1: Viet Nam\u2019s Benchmark Yield Curve\u2014 \nLocal Currency Government Bonds\n\nYield (%)\n7.0\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n31-Oct-17\n\n1-Sep-17\n\nSource: Based on data from Bloomberg LP.\n\nThe industrial and construction sector and the services \nsector posted growth of more than 7.0% each during the \nfirst 9 months of the year. \n\nConsumer price inflation trended higher in July, August, \nand September before easing in October. Consumer \nprices rose 3.0 % y-o-y in October, down from 3.4% y-o-y \nfrom a month earlier due to slower increase in food prices. \nAmong the subindexes, medical and healthcare posted \nthe highest inflation rate at 32.1% y-o-y in October. On a \nmonth-on-month basis, consumer price inflation eased \n0.4% in October. \n\nSize and Composition\n\nViet Nam continues to have the smallest LCY \nbond market in emerging East Asia. At the end of \nSeptember, Viet Nam\u2019s LCY bonds outstanding reached \nVND1,044.2\u00a0trillion (USD46 billion) (Table 1). Growth \nwas higher on a quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) basis in \nQ3\u00a02017 at 2.4%, up from 1.9% q-o-q in Q2 2017. On a \ny-o-y basis, however, growth eased to 0.2% from 5.0% \nduring the same period. Much of the growth during the \nquarter came from an increase in the stock of central \nbank\u00a0bills. \n\nGovernment bonds. At the end of September, the LCY \ngovernment bond market rose to VND1,001.2 trillion, \nwith growth up 2.7% q-o-q and 0.2% y-o-y.
