Introduction\nIt is not hard to fathom why individuals migrate from poor regions of the world to more \nwealthy ones; they just crave a better life for them and for their families. The neoclassical \ntheory of migration (e.g. Todaro 1969) summarizes this behavior by suggesting that \nmigrant workers move to other countries in response to a series of \u201cpush\u201d factors related \nto the domestic economy and \u201cpull\u201d factors from the destination countries. The push \nfactors include poor governance and weak investment climate that may be reflected in \nlimited job opportunities especially for well-paying jobs. The pull factors are a combination \nof several aspects reflected in a better job opportunity, education system, health care, \nand living standards. Also, many individual circumstances can impact the overall cost \nof migrating such as the need to sell (buy) property in the home (host) country and the \npsychological cost of migrating. This is in addition to constraints such as language, skills, \nand other barriers that may prevent workers to move. Finally, as the new economics of \nlabor migration postulate (e.g. Stark and Bloom 1985) it is important to recognize that \nmigration maybe one of the household strategies to deal with the limitations of the home \ncountry economy (e.g. lack of credit or insurance markets).\nInternational migration dynamics have attracted the attention of academics and policy \nmakers because of its possible impacts in the home country macroeconomic conditions. \nThe current debate suggests that several features of the migration process should \nbe explored to evaluate its full impact in migrant-sending countries. For instance, the \nmigration of the most skilled and educated workers may end up leaving the home country \nwithout the skill labor that is essential to achieve sustained economic growth. The debate \nabout whether migration actually results in a brain drain and whether this affects the \nlong-term development prospects of the migrant-sending region or country has been \ndeliberated extensively in both the academic and policy circles (e.g. Beine et al. 2001; \nChau and Stark 1999; Docquier and Schiff  2009). \nAn additional characteristic of the migration process that has attracted the attention \nof policy makers is the development potential of worker\u2019s remittances, the money that \nmigrants send back to their country of origin. The academic and policy deliberations on \nthe topic suggest that the monetary sums that immigrants remit to their relatives and \nfriends can be a significant source of financial capital in developing countries (Fajnzylber \nand Lop\u00e9z 2008). Moreover, recorded remittances are in general less volatile than other \nnontrade foreign currency inflows, and often strengthen macroeconomic stability. \t", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nAn examination on the empirical data during 1990\u20132008 shows the coefficient of variation \nof remittance flows to developing countries was 0.77 against 0.80 for foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) and 1.34 for private debt, and 1.17 for portfolio equity flows. Official \ndevelopment assistance flows have, in fact, the lowest coefficient (0.33), but are not \nfully comparable because they include donor expenditure planned sometimes years in \nadvance.1 One of the key advantages of migrants\u2019 transfers over other foreign currency \nfunds flowing to developing countries, such as foreign aid, is that government intervention \nis not required, given that these flows are sent directly to family and friends. This attribute \nmakes remittances less prone to bureaucratic hitches, including corruption.\nWhile there is vast literature on the impacts that remittances have on specific aspects \nof the home country socioeconomic conditions, empirical studies on the impact of \nremittances on aggregate annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth have been \nfew for various reasons. For starters, the policy focus on this topic is relatively recent. \nAlso, and perhaps more important, data on remittance flows to developing countries are \nlacking. It was not until recently (a little over a decade ago) that government officials \nand policy institutions realized the towering importance of accurately collecting this \ninformation. Recording the volume of migrants\u2019 flows was just not a policy priority for \nmany developing countries. \nEvidence of the link between remittances and growth using large samples of countries \nand long-term measures of GDP growth is mixed. Barajas et al. (2009), for example, \nexamine a dataset for more than 80 countries across the world, and find no growth \neffects. However, Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz (2009), analyzing data for about 100 \ndeveloping countries, note that remittances promote growth in less financially developed \ncountries and thus present another way of financing investment. Similarly, Bettin and \nZazzaro (2009), using a new indicator of financial development measuring the efficiency \nof the domestic banking system, note that the impact of remittances on economic growth \nis negative (positive) in countries where bank efficiency is low (high). Catrinescu et al. \n(2009) use a large dynamic panel dataset to show that remittances exercise a weak \npositive effect on long-term macroeconomic growth, and the impact increases in the \npresence of sound economic policies and institutions. \nThis study contributes to the literature on remittances by providing an analysis of the \nimpact of remittances on GDP growth in developing Asian countries. We also explore \nthe possibility of remittances being an effective tool for the fight against poverty. Even \nif remittances are not conducive to GDP growth, these flows may be able to raise \nhousehold incomes above poverty levels, allowing for more investments in human capital \nand possibly easing credit constraints. This is extremely important for Asia that, as a \nconsequence of having a large share of the planet\u2019s population, holds about two thirds of \nthe world\u2019s poorest people.\n\u0004  It is also argued that foreign aid is not just a tool for promoting development but it has other objectives as well, \nsuch as being a sign of diplomatic approval or a reward to foreign governments for behavior desired by the donor. \nSee Burnside and Dollar (2000) for more on issues related to foreign aid flows.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u0018\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses the importance of \ninternational migration and remittances for Asia, followed by Section III with a discussion \nof the previous literature on the topic. Section IV introduces the data and empirical \nmethodology, while Section V presents the empirical results. The last section provides key \nfindings and their policy implications.\nII. Migration and Remittances in Asia\nAsia has a long history of migration. For some countries, such as the United States (US), \nAsian migration can be traced all the way back to the Gold Rush era (1880s). Nowadays, \nthe US remains one of the top destinations for migrants from Asia as the share of Asian \nmigrants going to this country is about 14%. In fact, migrants for the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) and the Philippines are the second and third largest immigrant groups in \nthe US, just behind migrants from Mexico (US Census Bureau 2003). The US is followed \nin the share of migrants by Saudi Arabia (6.5%), the Eurozone (4.4%) and the United \nArab Emirates (4%). Recent trends reveal that Asian migrants are no longer restricted \nin their orientation toward industrial economies, for intra-Asian migration has become \nmore pronounced (ADO, 2008). For instance, in Hong Kong, China, about 70% of the \ntemporary immigrants are originally from other Southeast Asian countries with noteworthy \nrepresentations of immigrants from the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand (Orozco and \nFedewa 2005).\nHowever striking these statistics are, it does not compare with the volume of remittances \nsent home by these expatriates. Remittances to Asia comprise the highest regional total \nin the globe (International Fund for Agricultural Development 2009) and for some of the \nrelatively smaller countries (e.g. Indonesia, Nepal, and Tajikistan) remittances constitute \na non-trivial portion of their national income. Half of the top 10 remittance-receiving \ncountries in the world in absolute terms (namely, India, PRC, Philippines, Bangladesh, \nand Viet Nam) are in Asia. In aggregate, these countries have about 100 million of their \nnationals living abroad. In 2008, East Asia and the Pacific continued to remain the largest \nrecipients of international remittances among all developing regions, with South Asia as \nthe second largest recipient. \nThe stability of remittance flows, which contribute significantly to private flows, can \ncounter the effects of falling FDI, debt, and equity flows during an economic downturn \nin the recipient country. Portfolio investment\u2014as in the case of passive holdings of \nsecurities\u2014without any active management, represents a low level of compromise on \nthe part of the investor. As such, it is relatively painless to run away at the first sign of \ntrouble. On the other hand, FDI typically requires a physical investment in the country \nand as such, these flows are expected to be somewhat sturdier. Nonetheless, the \nevidence suggests that investors are willing to sacrifice some of the initial investment on ", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\ninfrastructure to move operations and take advantage of profitable opportunities in other \ncountries. As such, FDI is also a fairly volatile flow, even if it is not as volatile as portfolio \ninvestment.\nRemittances to Asia have been particularly responsive to major crises in migrants\u2019 home \ncountries. For example, Sri Lanka reported a substantial increase in migrant transfers \nfollowing the 2004 tsunami (Savage and Harvey 2007). This jump occurred despite poorly \nfunctioning financial channels at the time (as many important money transfer agencies \nand banks were closed for a long period in some areas). Remittances played a similarly \nsupportive role after the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan (Suleri and Savage 2006) \nand remittances to the Philippines have been found to respond positively to rainfall-\nrelated shocks (Choi and Yang 2007). As also shown in Figure 1, the relative stability of \nremittance flows compared with other flows in the Philippines stands out, even when the \nglobal turmoil began in earnest. Another explanation could be that many Asian migrants \nhave been able to secure jobs that are somewhat resistant to cyclical fluctuations in \noutput (e.g. nurses from the Philippines) and hence have not been affected that seriously \nby the crisis.\nFigure 1: Recent Trends in Private Flows to the Philippines\n2500\n2000\n1500\nn\no\nmilli 1000\n$ \n500\n0\n-500\nJan Apr July Oct Jan Apr Jul Oct Jul Apr\n2007 2008 2009\nRemittances Foreign direct investment Foreign portfolio inflow\nNote:  The direct investment series represents the non-residents\u2019 investments in the Philippines from the balance of payments.\nSource:  CEIC Data Company Ltd., downloaded \u00040 September 2009.\nSince the onset of the crisis, the growth of remittances to Asia has decelerated (Figure 2). \nIt seems that the region will be significantly affected by the downturn. In particular, \nSouth Asia experienced sharp deceleration in the growth of remittance inflows in \n2008. Countries in Central, South, and Southeast Asia, where remittances contribute \nsubstantially to economic activity, are particularly exposed to the contagion. \t\nFor Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Philippines, the statistics for 2009 suggest that ", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u0018\nremittances are actually on the rise, which could be due to repatriation of life-long \nsavings. For example, Brown (1997) examining remittance behavior of Tongan and \nwestern Samoan migrants in Sydney, Australia found that migrants who plan to return \nhome have a higher propensity to remit and send money for asset accumulation and \ninvestment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also noted a sharp increase in \nremittances to Indonesia after the 1997 Asian slump (IMF 2005).\nFigure 2: Growth Rate of International Remittances to Asian Regions\n60\n48\n36\nnt\nce 24\ner\nP\n12\n0\n-12\n\u201c2005\u201d \u201c06\u201d \u201c07\u201d \u201c08\u201d\nCentral Asia East Asia South Asia\nSoutheast Asia Pacific\nNote:   Pacific excludes Cook Islands, Nauru, and Tuvalu.\nSource:  World Bank, Migration and Remittance data, July 2009, available: www.worldbank.org, downloaded 3\u0004 August 2009.\nThese facts illustrate the significant role of migration and remittances in the Asian \neconomy and indicate that it is crucial to have a detailed look at the potential of \nremittances in promoting growth and reducing poverty.\nIII. Previous Literature\nA.  Determinants of Remittances \nThe significant volume of remittances received by developing countries during the \nprevious two decades generated substantial interest. A large fraction of the literature has \nfocused on the determinants of these flows (e.g., Agarwal and Horowitz 2002; Blue 2004; \nBrown 1997; de la Briere, et al. 2002; Funkhouser 1995; Hoddinott 1994; Lucas and Stark \n1985; Merkle and Zimmerman 1992; Naufal 2007; Osili 2004; and Vargas-Silva 2009a), ", "\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\njust to name a few. The findings of these studies suggest that a wide range of variables \naffect the likelihood to remit and the amount remitted. There are also many reasons why \nmigrants send home part of their incomes, such as altruism, self-interest, loan repayment, \nand insurance motives. \nSeveral of these studies have used survey data from Asian countries, such as Brown \n(1997), who used survey data from Tonga and Western Samoa to show that while \naltruism is present as a motivation for migrants\u2019 remittances, there is also evidence of \nself-interest motives.2 Osaki (1999) investigates the role of gender on migrants\u2019 transfers \nin Thailand and finds differences in the coefficients for males and females for a number of \nconditioning variables.3 Yang (2008) uses information on migrants\u2019 remittances during the \n1997 Asian financial crisis to study the impact of exchange rate shocks on remittances. \nHis results suggest that appreciation of a migrant\u2019s currency against the Philippine peso \nleads to increases in household remittances received from overseas.4\nB.  Economic Impacts of Remittances \nWhile these and other prior studies provide an appealing discussion on the motives that \na migrant has for remitting money home, the current study is more preoccupied with the \nactual impact of remittances in the receiving economies. Remittances have the potential \nto impact a great number of variables in the recipient country. Consequently, the studies \nthat have assessed the macroeconomic impact of remittances are varied in their scope \nand policy conclusions. Generally speaking, remittances may have both favorable and \nunfavorable consequences. \nFor example, as a source of household income in poor regions, monetary inflows sent \nhome by migrants have a favorable impact on rebalancing growth by expanding domestic \ndemand. Such receipts also help smooth consumption and promote human capital \ndevelopment by increasing the capacity of households to spend on education, health, \nand nutrition. Remittances foster economic growth by spurring entrepreneurial activity, \nimproving labor productivity, and stimulating consumption and investment demands. If \nthey raise incomes of the poor, such flows could reduce poverty and income inequality.  \nThey may also contribute to macro stability of recipient economies by providing them \nwith foreign exchange and improving their creditworthiness. Moreover, by easing credit \nconstraints and funding physical infrastructures, remittances have the potential to \nstimulate financial and economic development. \nAt the same time remittances may have adverse consequences with both economic \nand social dimensions. They may stifle growth by causing exchange rate to appreciate, \nthereby dampening trade competitiveness; raising the level of inflation; providing \n2  See also Ahlburg and Brown (\u0004999), Brown (\u0004994) and Connell (2000) for more on remittances in the South Pacific.\n3  VanWey (2004), in another study using data from Thailand, found that women and migrants from poorer \nhouseholds behave more altruistically, while men and migrants from richer households behave more contractually.\n4  See also Choi and Yang (2007) for more on the determinants of remittances in the Philippines.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u0018\ndisincentives to work among recipients; and creating social problems such as marital \nconflicts and family stress. Moreover, if remittances benefit more the higher income \ngroups, they can increase income inequality. \nLiterature shows that remittances may, for instance, negatively impact the labor supply \nof the receiving households. An increase in remittances is an increase in non-labor \nor transfer income. As leisure is a normal good, the household would be expected to \ndemand more leisure after receiving transfers. Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2006a) find \nevidence that remittances tend to encourage Mexican men to change their allocation \nof labor supply across types of employment, but do not decrease their labor supply. \nConversely, they find a drop in the overall labor supply of Mexican women. Acosta (2006), \nusing information from El Salvador, also finds that remittances are negatively related to \nfemale labor supply, while male labor force participation does not seems to be sensitive to \nthese flows. But, the results in Rodriguez and Tiongson (2001) indicate that remittances \nreduce employment among men and women in the Philippines. In sum, the evidence \nstrongly suggests that remittances have a negative impact in the labor supply of receiving \nhouseholds with a particularly important effect in the labor supply of female members.5\nAnother key argument that remittances may harm receiving economies is that remittances \ncan generate inflationary pressures or cause a \u201cDutch Disease\u201d-like phenomenon. \nAfter receiving remittances in a foreign currency, the household will exchange these \nremittances for domestic currency. This can appreciate the local currency and crowd-out \nexports. Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) provide evidence that remittances cause \nappreciation of the real exchange rate for 13 Latin American economies. Acosta et al. \n(2009) provide similar evidence for 109 developing and transition countries. Vargas-Silva \n(2009b) provides further evidence of real exchange rate appreciation for the case of \nMexico. Finally, Javaid (2009) provides recent evidence of remittances causing \u201cDutch \nDisease\u201d for a group of South-East Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Pakistan and Philippines).6\nOn the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted a series of positive aspects \nof remittances. One of the main claims from those attesting that remittances have a \nfavorable impact on economic development is that remittances are frequently used for \ninvestment in the home country. For instance, there is evidence that remittances are \nregularly invested in small businesses by receiving households (Amuedo-Dorantes and \nPozo 2006b). Therefore, remittances can provide households with the initial capital \nnecessary to start a small enterprise. This is especially relevant for developing countries \nwhere credit markets are not well developed. Likewise, even if remittances are simply \n\u0004  In the case of Rodriguez and Tiongson (200\u0004) the negative labor supply response to remittances was more \nimportant for men than for women.\n\u0004  While there is plenty of evidence about the impact of remittances on the exchange rate, the result is not universal. \nFor instance, Amuedo-Dorantes et al. (2007), focusing in the case of small-island developing states, present \nevidence that suggest that while foreign aid tends to appreciate the real exchange rate, remittances do not have \nthe same impact.", "8 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nspent on household consumption, it could be claimed that the extra demand for products \nin the home country could benefit the receiving economy by generating a multiplier \neffect. Lastly, a number of papers study the impact of remittances on schooling in the \nhome country and find that remittances actually promote the schooling of children, thus \nincreasing domestic human capital levels (Edwards and Ureta 2003).\nC.  Impacts of Remittances on Economic Growth\nWith regard to remittances and aggregate income, there are two strands of the literature: \nfocusing on the impact of remittances on short-term fluctuations and concentrating on the \nimpact of remittances on long-term economic growth. A good perception of the business \ncycle and its relationship with remittances can be quite useful for Asian countries in order \nto react adequately to cyclical fluctuations in output. If remittances are countercyclical with \nrespect to the home economy, receiving countries could potentially use remittances as \npart of their strategy to offset negative cyclical fluctuations in output. In this regard, Sayan \n(2006) finds that remittances in Bangladesh are countercyclical and are synchronous with \nthe business cycle, whereas in India, remittances are also countercyclical but with a \t\n1-year lag.\nThe potential reasons for the response of remittances to cyclical fluctuations may be \nembedded on the motives for remitting. If the migrant cares about household well-being, \nand if the negative cyclical fluctuations are affecting an important share of the households \nin the home country, then remitters may respond with an increase in transfers. On the \nother hand, if remitters are mostly interested in investing in the home country, then \nremittances may decrease following negative cyclical fluctuations in output. While these \nare suitable explanations for the cyclical behavior of remittances, it is important to note \nthat just by simply looking at the business cycle behavior of remittances, we do not \nposses sufficient information to elucidate on the main motives for remitting on the part \t\nof migrants.\nA series of studies have focused directly on the relationship between remittances and \neconomic growth. Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz (2009) explore the relationship between \nremittances and the financial sector of the receiving country. They posit that in those \ncountries that lack proper credit markets, remittances may ease credit constraints by \nallowing entrepreneurs to obtain the necessary capital for business ventures. Using data \nfor about 100 developing countries, they find evidence that remittances promote growth \nin less financially developed countries. Mundaca (2009) presents a theoretical model \nin which remittances have a long-term impact on the receiving economy only if these \nflows are invested in long-run technology or used for capital investment. However, she \nargues that investment in those areas would only be possible in the presence of financial \nintermediaries that facilitate the lending of saved remittances money.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u0018\nCatrinescu et al. (2009) argue that previous remittances and growth studies (e.g. Chami \net al. 2003) suffer from endogeneity issues and have also failed to address the issue \nof how economic and governance policies that support the business environment in the \nreceiving country assist the impact of remittances. Using dynamic panel estimation, they \nfind that remittances exercise a weak positive effect on long-term macroeconomic growth. \nRuiz et al. (2009) reexamined the relationship between remittances and economic growth, \nwith special attention on the importance of the nonlinearity of this relationship. They show \nthat the relationship between remittances and growth is neither linear nor quadratic, \nproposing the use of a semiparametric model to avoid misspecification bias from imposing \nan arbitrary functional form. Their results suggest that there is evidence of a positive \nassociation between remittances and growth in parametric estimations; however, the \nevidence of such relationship vanishes when nonlinearity is taken into account by means \nof nonparametric techniques.\nD.  Impacts of Remittances on Poverty\nWhile economic growth and poverty reduction usually go hand in hand, it is possible for \na country to experience significant growth without a decrease in poverty (Rodrik 2000). \nAdams and Page (2005) are among the first to bring this subject to the spotlight and \nexplore whether remittances can be used as an effective tool for reducing poverty. They \nconstruct different indicators of poverty: a poverty headcount index (measuring the level \nof poverty), a poverty gap index (measuring the depth of poverty), and a squared poverty \ngap index (measuring the severity of poverty). Using data from 71 developing countries, \nthey find that remittances do in fact, reduce the level, depth, and severity of poverty. The \ninstruments used include distance, education, and government stability.\nJongwanich (2007) revisits the issue of remittances and poverty by giving special \nemphasis on possible endogeneity issues. The author employs panel GMM regressions \nin growth and investment equations to control for endogeneity and uses an instrumental \nfixed-effects transformation in human capital and poverty equations. Using data for \ndeveloping Asia and Pacific countries for 1993\u20132003, Jongwanich  finds that remittances \nhave a significant impact on poverty reduction by raising income. On the other hand, \nresults suggest that remittances have only a marginal impact on growth.\nBrown (2008) looks at the issue of remittances and poverty using survey data from \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. He conducts a series of \ncounterfactual experiments recognizing that remittances are preceded in most cases \nby migration of one or more household members. As such, to receive remittances, \nmost likely the household had to sacrifice the income that the migrant would have \nbeen otherwise contributing to the household. In the first counterfactual experiment, \nBrown assumes that in a world without migration (and hence, without remittances) the \nhousehold\u2019s income would be the same as the observed non-remittance income. That \nis, this scenario assumes that without migration, the migrant does not contribute to ", "10 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nhousehold income. Given that this is an unrealistic scenario for most households, the \nauthor also assumes a second scenario in which in a world without migration household \nincome depends on the characteristics of the migrant members. Results suggest that \nremittances are important in reducing poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, but \nnot so much in Armenia and Azerbaijan.\nIV. Methodology, Data, and Empirical Approach\nA.  Methodology \nOne common characteristic of many of the papers on remittances and growth discussed \nabove is that they were published in 2009. While there are several previous studies on \nthe topic (before 2009), the fact that so much work is been currently done focusing on \nthis specific topic implies that there is a current interest about this issue. This paper adds \nto the discussion of this now much in-vogue topic.\nWith regard to the empirical methodology, this paper deviates from the previous studies in \ntwo aspects. First, it focuses exclusively on the case of Asia, the region that receives that \nlargest share of remittances in the globe. Second, it presents the results using annual \ndata instead of the more traditional 5-year averages. The reason is that the regional \nsample has a severely limited number of observations. Nonetheless, for completeness, \nAppendix A of the paper replicates the results using 5-year averages of data. \nFurthermore, as mentioned above, in addition to discussing the impact of remittances \non growth, this paper also inquires on the impact of remittances on poverty reduction. \nThe key idea is that remittances could reduce poverty by increasing the income of the \nrecipients, without necessarily conducing to GDP growth. If that is in fact the case, then \none should think of remittances as an effective tool for the fight against poverty, instead \nof an instrument for achieving economic growth.\nTo explore the impact of remittances on growth and poverty in Asian economies, this \npaper conducts two separate sets of estimations. It starts by exploring the impact of \nremittances on growth and then the effect of remittances on poverty. The two equations of \ninterest are:\ng =f (R ,Y ,I ,O ,\u03c0 ,H )\nit it i1 it it it it   (1)\nand\nP =f (R ,Y ,I ,O ,\u03c0 )\nit it it it it it   (2)", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | 11\nIn Equation 1 (the growth equation), g  is economic growth (the logarithm of the growth \nit\nrate of GDP per capita) and Y  is the natural logarithm of initial GDP per capita. If there \ni1\nis catching up between the countries, it is expected that initial GDP per capita will have \na negative effect on growth, given that countries that were initially poorer should grow at \na faster rate. Conversely, if the gap between the countries is widening, then initial GDP \nper capita should have a positive impact on growth. The human capital measure (H ) is \nit\nthe primary school completion rate (percent of relevant group). I  represents investment \nit\nthat is measured as the natural logarithm of gross capital formation (percent of GDP). \nIt is expected for growth to go hand in hand with human capital and investment, given \nthe well-known benefits of human and physical capital for growth performances (Barro \nand Sala-i-Martin, 2003). The annual percent change in the GDP deflator is used as \nthe inflation rate (\u03c0 ). Andr\u00e9s and Hernando (1997), among others, show that inflation \nit\nhas a significant cost in terms of GDP growth. Meanwhile, O  represents openness and \nit\nit is estimated as the natural logarithm of export plus imports as a percentage of GDP. \nAs stated by Edwards (2001), whether openness favors economic growth or not is one \nof the oldest controversies in the economics profession. Nonetheless, at present, the \nbalance of evidence suggests that free trade results in more rapid economic growth and \nthat protectionism hurts economic performances. Recent evidence also suggests that \nopenness can have an indirect effect in reducing poverty in Asian countries (Pernia and \nQuising 2002). Finally, R  represents the natural logarithm of remittances as a percent of \nit\nGDP.\nIn Equation 2 (the poverty equation) P  refers to the log of the poverty measure used, \nit\nwhile\tY  refers to the natural logarithm of GDP per capita. While GDP per capita is widely \nit\nregarded as a useful indicator of well being in a country, a high GDP per capita is not \nnecessarily tied to lower poverty levels. \nB.  Data \nThe first step in an empirical paper with aggregate remittances data is to determine \nwhich series of remittances to employ in the estimation. There is a battery of reasons \nfor having concerns about the quality of remittances aggregate data, which range from \ninconsistencies in reporting formats by central banks in different countries to, as we \ndiscussed further below, difficulties in measuring informal flows. In some instances, \ncentral banks\u2019 reporting requirements do not allow remittances and compensation of \nemployees to be separately reported, and therefore, central banks report remittances and \ncompensation of employees together in one category. In other cases, remittances and \ncompensation of employees are reported individually.7\n7  The compensation of employees is the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an enterprise to \nnonresident employees of a country in return for work done by the nonresident employee during the accounting \nperiod. ", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nIn this regard, the World Bank Migration and Remittances Factbook (World Bank 2008, \nxii) argues that:\n  \u201cWorkers\u2019 remittances, as defined in the IMF Balance of Payments manual, \nare current private transfers from migrant workers who are considered \nresidents of the host country to recipients in their country of origin. If the \nmigrants live in the host country for a year or longer, they are considered \nresidents, regardless of their immigration status. If the migrants have lived \nin the host country for less than a year, their entire income in the host \ncountry should be classified as compensation of employees. Although the \nresidence guideline in the manual is clear, this rule is often not followed \nfor various reasons. Many countries compile data based on the citizenship \nof the migrant worker rather than on their residency status. Further, data \nare shown entirely as either compensation of employees or as worker \nremittances, although they should be split between the two categories if \nthe guidelines were correctly followed.  The distinction between these two \ncategories appears to be entirely arbitrary.\u201d\nAcknowledging these differences in the reporting of remittance data, we employ a broad \nmeasure of remittances recommended by the World Bank Migration and Remittances \nFactbook. This measure defines remittances as the sum of workers\u2019 remittances, \ncompensation of employees, and migrants\u2019 transfers. The World Bank (2008) argues \nfurther that to get a complete picture of remittances, one has to look at these three items \ntogether.\nExcept for the measure of remittances that comes from the World Bank Migration and \nRemittances Factbook (2008) all other series are taken from the World Development \nIndicators. The data is in annual frequency and covers the period from 1988 to 2007. \nPlease refer to Appendix B for more details about data construction and definitions.\nC.  Empirical Approach \nThis paper started with the intention of including all developing member countries of \nthe Asian Development Bank in the estimation.8 However, given the data problems for \nseveral countries, the estimations include only from 15 to 27 of the 44 Asian Development \nBank members. Also, while it is possible to think about other control variables to include \nas determinants of growth (or poverty), we are faced with significant data constraints.9\nThe analysis is conducted using different econometric approaches. First, we start by \nconducting a growth equation using annual data and an OLS estimation. At this point, we \nwould like to think that our set of independent variables explains all of what is different \n\u0004  See the members at: www.adb.org/Countries/.\n9  We especially recognize the importance of not including a budget surplus variable.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | 1\u0018\nabout a country, but that regrettably is unlikely. Therefore, we need to take care of \nunobserved heterogeneity. Controlling for heterogeneity is important given that we are \nusing data from countries that differ significantly in aspects such as size; location within \nAsia; and institutional, cultural, historical, and political background. To control for possible \nunobserved heterogeneity, we use fixed-effects and random-effects estimations.\nV. Results\nA.  Remittances and Economic Growth\nTable 1 summarizes the results of the estimation of the growth equation. Columns (1), (2), \nand (3) show the results obtained when we employ annual data using OLS, fixed-effects \nand random-effects estimations, respectively. Looking first at the control variables, we \ncan observe that investment and inflation stand out as the only control variables that are \nsignificantly different from zero in all three cases. As expected, investment and openness \ncome out to be positively related to growth. Surprisingly, the first column suggests \nthat inflation is also favorable for growth performance. However, once we control for \nheterogeneity in the fixed and random-effects estimations, the significance of the inflation \ncoefficient disappears.\nTable 1: Estimation Results: Annual GDP Growth\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nRemittances 0.0\u0004 0.\u00042 0.09 0.0\u0004 0.\u0004\u0004 0.\u00040\n(\u0004.\u0004\u0004) (2.\u00044)** (2.3)** (\u0004.\u00047) (2.7)*** (2.\u00043)***\n(Remittances)2 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 0.00 \u22120.0\u0004 \u22120.03\n(\u22120.33) (\u22122.\u00043)** (\u2212\u0004.44)\nInitial GDP 0.00 \u2212 \u22120.02 0.00 \u2212 \u22120.02\n(0.0\u0004) (\u22120.2) (0.03) (\u22120.\u0004\u0004)\nInvestment \u0004.02 \u0004.\u00047 \u0004.\u0004\u0004 \u0004.02 \u0004.23 \u0004.\u0004\u0004\n(\u0004.93)*** (\u0004.\u00042)*** (\u0004.4)*** (\u0004.9\u0004)*** (\u0004.\u00042)*** (\u0004.\u0004\u0004)***\nOpenness 0.\u00049 0.\u00049 0.32 0.\u00049 0.4\u0004 0.3\u0004\n(\u0004.9\u0004)** (2.7\u0004)*** (2.22)** (\u0004.9\u0004)** (2.2\u0004)** (2.\u00042)**\nInflation 0.0\u0004 0.00 0.00 0.0\u0004 0.00 0.00\n(2.33)** (0.\u00044) (\u0004.04) (2.34)** (0.43) (0.97)\nHuman  0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\nCapital (\u22120.\u00049) (\u22120.\u00047) (\u22120.42) (\u22120.\u0004\u0004) (\u22120.\u00044) (\u22120.\u00049)\nObs. \u000499 \u000499 \u000499 \u000499 \u000499 \u000499\nCountries \u2212 2\u0004 2\u0004 \u2212 2\u0004 2\u0004\nF / Wald Test 7.2\u0004 9.73 4\u0004.3\u0004 \u0004.\u00047 9.04 \u00040.9\u0004\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nNotes:   The dependent variable is logarithm economic growth.

The evidence regarding remittances \nusing annual data is robust once we control for country-specific factors and it indicates \nthat remittance transfers are positively related to output growth. The manner in which the \nnumbers are reported in the table allows the coefficient on remittances to be interpreted \nas follows: a 10% increase in remittances as a share of GDP in a given year leads to \nabout a 0.9\u20131.2% increase in annual growth. For comparison purposes, we repeat the \nexercise in Table 1 but estimating instead elasticises at the mean. The elasticities at the \nmean of the growth rate of GDP per capita with respect to remittances as a share of GDP \nare .032 (fixed effects) and .025 (random effects).\nThe literature already contains plenty of studies that have associated remittances to \nbusiness cycle fluctuations of the home and host country (Roache and Gradzka 2007; \nSayan 2006; Vargas-Silva 2008), while the impact of remittances on growth has provided \nmixed results (Catrinescu et al. 2009; Chami et al. 2005; Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz \n2009; Mundaca 2009; Ruiz et al. 2009). The results that we obtained using standard \nmethodologies suggest that remittances can help spur short-term fluctuations in output in \nAsia.\nThere are several concerns with regard to remittances growth equations. One such \nconcern lies with the possibility of nonlinearity. Although the previous results tend to \nsuggest that the impact of remittances on economic growth is positive, the relationship \nbetween these two variables can be nonlinear. It is probable that if remittances advance \ngrowth, their impact has diminishing returns. That is, there is a threshold after which the \nimpact of remittances on growth diminishes or disappears.10\nColumns (4), (5) and (6) of Table 1 report similar estimations to those discussed \npreviously but also including the square of remittances in the regression to check for \ndiminishing returns. In the three cases (OLS, fixed, and random effects with annual \ndata) we have evidence of remittances having a positive but decreasing effect on output. \nHowever, only in the case of fixed effects is the coefficient of the square of remittances \nsignificant.\nTwo additional potential concerns with the previous estimation lie with the difference \nbetween annual GDP growth and long-term economic growth and the possibility of \nendogeneity. It is often the case that growth equations are not simply estimated using \nannual data, but using 5-year averages of the data to assess the long-term impact. \nMoreover, there are reasons to suspect an endogenous relationship between remittances \nand GDP growth and studies typically address this issue by employing an instrumental \nvariable estimation. Given the small number of observations that we have for the 5-year \naverage estimations and the controversies surrounding the selection of an adequate \n\u00040 This possible nonlinearity has not been completely ignored by the previous literature. Chami et al. (200\u0004), Barajas \net al. (2009) and Catrinescu et al. (200\u0004) include a squared term of remittances in some of their specifications, \nwhile Ruiz et al. (2009) conduct a semi-parametric estimation to address the nonlinearity issue.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | 1\u0018\ninstrument for remittances, we do not address these issues in the main part of the paper. \nHowever, recognizing the potential importance of these two issues, we have included \nestimations addressing these two concerns in Appendix A of the paper.\nB.  Remittances and Poverty\nIn addition to the impact of remittances on annual GDP growth, we are also interested \nin the possibility of remittances being an effective tool for poverty reduction as specified \nin equation 2. Migration from developing countries allows poor households in developing \ncountries the opportunity of taking advantage of segmented job markets in which the pay \nreceived by one or more household members is higher than it would have been otherwise \nin the home country. The migrant may send back a share of his or her income that more \nthan compensates for the loss of income at home. As such, remittances may increase \nincomes of poor household and decrease poverty.\nTable 2 reports the results from the poverty equation. There is no unique standard \nmeasure of poverty such as the one for economic growth. For this reason we report fixed-\neffects and random-effects estimations using three alternative measures of poverty: (i) the \npoverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line (percent of population); (ii) the poverty \ngap at US$1.25 a day (percent, PPP); and (iii) the poverty headcount ratio at US$1.25 \na day (percent of population, PPP). These measures are different and, as we will see \nbelow, results differ with regard to the impact of remittances on these variables. \nTable 2: Estimation Results: Poverty\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nRemittances \u22120.0\u0004 \u22120.04 \u22120.\u00044 \u22120.07 0.00 \u22120.02\n(\u2212\u0004.22) (\u22120.9\u0004) (\u2212\u0004.\u00047)* (\u22122.0\u0004)** (0.0\u0004) (\u22120.33)\nGDP Per Capita \u22120.3\u0004 \u22120.4\u0004 \u22120.9\u0004 \u22120.93 \u2212\u0004.03 \u2212\u0004.02\n(\u22120.93) (\u22123.\u0004)*** (\u22122.\u0004)*** (\u22123.\u0004)*** (\u22123.2\u0004)*** (\u22127.7\u0004)***\nInvestment \u22120.\u0004\u0004 \u22120.\u00044 0.\u00042 0.4\u0004 0.24 0.2\u0004\n(\u22123.\u00042)*** (\u22124.03)*** (0.\u0004\u0004) (\u0004.\u0004\u0004)* (0.92) (0.92)\nOpenness \u22120.\u00040 0.02 \u22120.02 \u22120.22 \u22120.\u00047 \u22120.33\n(\u22120.3\u0004) (0.\u0004) (\u22120.7) (\u2212\u0004.2\u0004) (\u22120.\u00049) (\u2212\u0004.\u0004\u0004)*\nInflation 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n(0.\u00047) (0.\u00042) (.9) (0.74) (\u0004.\u00043)* (\u0004.03)\nObs. 40 40 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004\nCountries 20 20 20 20 20 20\nF/Wald Test 7.74 \u00040.\u0004\u0004 \u0004.32 42.\u00042 9.27 \u00040\u0004.9\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes:   (\u0004) fixed-effects estimation, dependent variable is the logarithm of poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line \n(percent of population); (2) random-effects estimation, dependent variable is the logarithm of poverty headcount ratio \nat the national poverty line (percent of population); (3) fixed-effects estimation, dependent variable is the logarithm of \npoverty gap at US$\u0004.2\u0004 a day (percent, purchasing power parity [PPP]) ; (4) random-effects estimation, dependent variable \nis the logarithm of poverty gap at US$\u0004.2\u0004 a day (percent, PPP) ; (\u0004) fixed-effects estimation, dependent variable is the \nlogarithm of poverty headcount ratio at US$\u0004.2\u0004 a day (percent of population, PPP) ; and (\u0004) random-effects estimation, \ndependent variable is the logarithm of poverty headcount ratio at US$\u0004.2\u0004 a day (percent of population, PPP).\n  The numbers in parentheses are the t-statistics. *, **, *** indicate \u00040 %, \u0004 % and \u0004 % level of significance respectively. \nSource:  Authors\u2019 estimates.", "1\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nThe first and third measures are headcount indexes and they are useful in estimating \nthe incidence of poverty. These are measures of the share of the population in a certain \ncountry whose income is below the poverty line, defined at the national and international \nlevels. The second measure deals with the poverty gap and provides information about \nthe depth of poverty. This variable measures how far below poor households are from \nthe poverty line. It is estimated as the mean shortfall of the total population from the \npoverty line, expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. Because this measure is \nnot as intuitive as the previous one, let us cite Adams and Page (2005) explanation of \nthis variable: \u201ca poverty gap of 10% means that the average poor person\u2019s expenditures \n(income) are 90% of the poverty line.\u201d Moreover, the first measure is relative for each \ncountry as it indicates the proportion of the national population whose incomes are below \nan official threshold set by the national government. On the other hand, the last two \nmeasures use the Asian Development Bank standard threshold of US$1.25 as the poverty \nline.11\nColumns (1) and (2) show the results when we use the poverty headcount ratio at the \nnational poverty line as the measure of poverty. Fixed effects are shown in column 1 \nand random effects are shown in column 2. Columns (3) and (4) display the results \nwhen we use the poverty gap at US$1.25 a day, fixed effects and random effects, while \ncolumns (5) and (6) replace as the dependent variable the poverty headcount ratio at \nUS$1.25 a day. It seems that using the first measure of poverty, we get the result\u2014 not \nunexpectedly\u2014that investment decreases poverty. In the case of the random-effects \nestimation, it seems that a higher GDP per capita is related to a lower poverty rate. \nMeanwhile, it seems that remittances have a negative impact on poverty, but the impact \nis not statistically significant. Nonetheless, for the next measure of poverty, the impact of \nremittances is still negative and it is significant in both cases. The coefficients suggest \nthat a 10% increase in remittances (as a percentage of GDP) can decrease the poverty \ngap (basically, the income by which families fall short of the poverty line) in Asian \ncountries by about .7\u20131.4%. Moreover, as we did with the first growth estimation in Table \n1, we also estimated the elasticities of the poverty gap with regard to remittances at the \nmean values. In this case, the estimation suggests that the elasticities at the mean are \n.07 for the fixed-effects estimation, and .04 for the random-effects estimation.\nFinally, with regard to the last measure we, once again, find mixed results between the \nfixed-effects estimation and the random-effects measure. In the random (fixed) effects \nestimations, remittances have a negative (positive) effect on poverty. However, in both \ncases, the coefficient is not significant. In sum, the estimated relationship between \nremittances and poverty depends on the selection of the measure of poverty and the \nmethodology used. Nevertheless, results hint that remittances decrease the poverty gap. \n\u0004\u0004 See the discussion at web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/\n0,,contentMDK:20202\u00049\u0004~menuPK:43\u00040\u0004\u0004~pagePK:\u00044\u00049\u0004\u0004~piPK:2\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004\u0004~theSitePK:4303\u00047,00.html.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | 1\u0018\nVI. Summary, Policy Recommendations  \nand Concluding Remarks\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the impact of remittance transfers in Asian countries. \nIn particular, we conduct this study to shed light on the possibility of remittances \nfostering annual GDP growth and abating poverty in the region. The previous literature \non remittances and growth (or poverty) has found mixed results, with most studies \nsuggesting that remittances have some potential for advancing economic growth agendas \nand decreasing poverty. A large portion of the literature is recent, which indicates current \ninterest in the topic.\nThe key findings of this study can be summarized as follows. Fixed-effects and random-\neffects estimations indicate that remittances affect home country real annual GDP per \ncapita growth positively. The results imply that a 10% increase in remittances as a portion \nof GDP leads to about a .9\u20131.2% increase in output growth. This figure is quite significant \ngiven that in many countries in Asia (e.g. Philippines, Tajikistan) remittances account \nfor more than 10% of GDP. The results using annual data also indicate that remittances \nimpact on growth is positive but decreasing, hence the impact is likely to be greater in \nthe new immigration countries, than in countries with an established migration culture. \nNonetheless, this result is not completely robust.\nThe impact of remittances on poverty depends on the measure of poverty used and \nthe methodology that is selected. It seems safe to conclude that remittances decrease \nthe poverty gap and ameliorate the depth of poverty. In this regard, the estimation \nsuggests that a 10% increase in remittances (as a percentage of GDP) can decrease \nthe poverty gap (the income by which families fall short of the poverty line) in Asian \ncountries by about 0.7\u20131.4%. The impact of remittances on the overall poverty rate is not \nstraightforward. Although mostly negative, it is not significant.\nThere is evidence in our results that remittances may have a positive impact on GDP \nper capita in the short run. Therefore, receiving countries should not necessarily think \nabout remittances as an instrument for long-term development, but also as a tool to \ntackle short-run fluctuations in output. This is not to say that remittances are automatic \nmechanisms that can correct negative cyclical fluctuations in output, but rather that \nthese flows could be part of the policies intended to address those cyclical fluctuations. \nHowever, this role of remittances is more practical for local fluctuations in output and \nin cases in which most of the destination economies remained relatively stable. In a \nsituation like the current financial crisis where the global economy is weak, migrants\u2019 \npockets are also suffering the downturn and therefore it would be difficult for many \nmigrants to compensate households for the poor economic conditions back home.", "18 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nIn the long run, remittances also seem to have a positive impact on output, but the \nrelationship is not significant (see results in Appendix A). This does not imply that \nremittances do not have long-term beneficial aspects for the receiving economy, but \nrather, those aspects are not revealed by the empirical relation between aggregate \nremittances and growth. Hence, as a long term bet, the positive impact of remittances on \neconomic growth may not pay off. Rather than taking this gamble, Asian countries should \nalso look into other complementary ways of propelling economic growth and development.\nFinally, remittances may or may not reduce poverty, depending on the poverty measure \nused and the methodology selected. Previous evidence suggests that migrants\u2019 transfers \ndo not always flow to the poorer households in a country and therefore have been even \ncharged with increasing inequality in receiving communities (Barham and Boucher 1998). \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that remittances increase the income of the remittance \nreceiving households and, therefore, should be part of any household income-increasing \npolicies in developing countries. Whether remittances would translate into a massive \nreduction of poverty in developing countries remains to be seen. Interestingly, our results \nare robust with regard to the negative effect of remittances on the poverty gap.  As such, \nremittances can be a useful weapon for reducing the depth of poverty. It is important to \nrecall that poverty rates simply indicate the percentage of the population of a country \nthat is poor by some standard, but they do not advise us on whether people are living in \nhopeless poverty or are just below poverty line. That of course makes a difference and, \ntherefore, the fact that remittances can reduce the depth of poverty is encouraging.\nWorldwide remittances transfers have increased dramatically in recent years and Asia has \nbeen at the center of this increase. With three of the four main remittances recipients in \nthe world located in the region, the possible impacts of these flows in receiving countries \nin the area have awakened the curiosity of academics and have captured the attention \nof key policy makers. Remittances are already being called a new development mantra, \nmanna from heaven, and even a present-day miracle. While the evidence above suggests \nthat the current impact of remittances on economic growth and poverty is not completely \nrobust, that does not imply that there are no policies that Asian countries can adopt to \nmake the most out of the inherent development potential of remittances. For instance, \nmany countries in the region (e.g., India and Pakistan) are already providing beneficial \nterms (e.g., higher interest rates, tax exemptions, flexible currency conversion) to financial \ninstruments (e.g., bonds) that are acquired by their expatriates. These types of policies \npromote the investment of migrants\u2019 monies into the financial sector of the receiving \neconomies and help enhance the financial literacy of both the migrant and the household. \nOther possible policies that have been adopted by countries in other regions of the world \ninclude matching flows of collective remittances by migrant organizations or hometown \nassociations (groups with members from the same region in the migrant-sending country) \nwith government funds to enhance the development impact of these transfers.12 This \n\u00042 For example, Mexico\u2019s \u201cthree for one\u201d program matches each US dollar contributed by a migrant or hometown \nassociation with three additional US dollars of government funds.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | 1\u0018\npolicy can be implemented by national, state, or even local governments interested in \ndevelopment projects. In both of these cases, the government can undertake the role \nof liaison between the migrants and the receiving economy. However, while playing this \nrole, the government must resist the temptation of directly managing, instead of just \nchanneling, remittance flows. Above all, it is imperative to remember that the key aspect \nof remittances is that these are largely flows from migrants to friends and family back \nhome. \nInternational organizations may help in coordinating efforts so that remittance flows are \nused to alleviate some of the market inefficiencies of receiving economies. For instance, \nmany international organizations (e.g., The Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank) are promoting the provision of loans to households for \nhome purchasing using remittances and the migrant as collateral. This course of action \ncan be especially valuable in developing countries where credit markets are not well \ndeveloped. There is often a lack of credit services in general, other times (especially in \nrural areas) households have land but lack ownership titles, have crops but no deeds, \nand run businesses without statutes of incorporation (De Soto 2000) and as such, it \nis virtually impossible to obtain credit from the few sources available, given the lack of \ncollateral.\nInternational organizations can also help steer remittances toward loans for small \nbusinesses. This task is very relevant for Asian developing countries, because in addition \nto dealing with credit market shortcomings, migration can be an instrument in dealing with \ninsurance market inefficiencies. It is possible to ponder that the possibility of receiving \nremittances may allow the household to enter more profitable, but riskier businesses, \ngiven that if things go south, remittances can be used as a source of support for the \nhousehold. By leaving the household and moving to another region or country, the \nmigrant will be subjected to risks that are mostly uncorrelated to those that the household \nfaces. The income risks in Asian developing countries are multiple. Typical sources of \nrisk include crop failure due to a drought, flooding, or frost; reduction in household labor \nincome due to the death or illness of a productive member of the household; crime; and \nthe possibility of government-sponsored real estate property redistribution programs (e.g., \nland reform). If household income is subjected to any of these jeopardies, the household \nwould be able to diversify income risk by sending a member abroad. Furthermore, most \nsmall businesses require an initial period of investment that is not accompanied by any \nprofits from the new venture. Remittances can help support the business during this \nperiod. Nonetheless, even with all these potential benefits of remittances in terms of small \nbusiness formation, many households lack the understanding and expertise necessary \nto start these enterprises. International organizations can be of great assistance if they \nprovide advice to households in this regard. Spreading this information will facilitate the \nuse of remittances as a tool for development.", "\u00180 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\nLast but not least, it is relevant to recall that migration is a phenomenon that has been \npresent during the entire history of civilization. As such, it is unlikely to disappear during \nthe upcoming decades. This fact has often created concerns in sending countries, given \nthe high cost of migration for sending regions in terms of the brain drain. This, however, \nis not necessarily a dreadful aspect of migration. First, it is argued that the departure of \nthe most educated individuals from a country may result in the creation of a brain bank \nthat provides local innovators access to priceless knowledge build up abroad (Agrawal et \nal. 2008). Moreover, as Chau and Stark (1999) demonstrate, it is possible for per capita \nincome in a country to be higher with migration than without migration. Moreover, they \nshow that allowing the migration of skilled workers can increase the welfare of the home \npopulation and, hence, a brain drain can lead to a welfare gain. Previous studies also \nsuggest that migrants are in a superior situation to invest in their home countries because \nthey have specific knowledge that other foreign investors lack. Non-migrant locals also \nhave this knowledge, but they often lack the valuable business expertise that is typically \nacquired abroad. Finally, it is often the case that migration is a two-way occurrence, with \nmany migrants returning back home after a few years abroad. The return of highly skilled \nexpatriates with specialized knowledge (e.g., engineers, scientists) can help improve \nresearch and development programs in Asia. In sum, countries should not be too anxious \nabout the brain drain that accompanies migration. Instead of trying to keep locals from \nmoving abroad, countries should embrace migration as part of humankind behavior and \npromote policies that make the best out of the migration of nationals to other countries.", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u00181\nAppendix A: Robustness\nIt is often the case that growth equations are not simply estimated using annual data, but using \n5-year averages of the data to assess the long-term impact. In this appendix, we also follow this \napproach by presenting the results obtained using 5-year averages instead of annual data. An \nobvious result of using 5-year averages is that we lose an important share of the observations. \nFinally, we also explore the robustness of the results to concerns such as endogeneity by \nconducting instrumental variable estimations. In that regard, we present estimations using the \ninstrument suggested by Barajas et al. (2009) as well as with other instruments used in previous \nremittances studies. \nTable A1 reports the results when we employ 5-year averages. By taking 5-year averages, we \nget rid of the short-term cyclical fluctuations in output. Table A1 suggests that it is still the case \nthat investment comes out as a dominant variable. There is also some evidence of economic \ngrowth being affected positively by human capital. Finally, initial gross domestic product (GDP) per \ncapita has a negative impact on growth performances, which indicates some catching up between \ncountries in the region. Meanwhile, the coefficient on remittances turns out to be not significant. \nThis seems to be the norm across estimation methodologies. Hence, it seems that remittances \nimpact growth in the short term, but not in the long term. For the case of 5-year averages data, \nwe also fail to find evidence of a diminishing relationship between remittances and growth (or of a \nlinear relationship for that matter).\nTable A1: Estimation Results: 5-Year Averages\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)\nRemittances \u22120.04 0.0\u0004 \u22120.03 \u22120.04 0.0\u0004 \u22120.03\n(\u22120.47) (0.44) (\u22120.42) (0.47) (0.33) (\u22120.3\u0004)\n(Remittances)2 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 0.00 \u22120.04 0.00\n(0.0\u0004) (\u22120.\u00043) (\u22120.09)\nInitial GDP \u22120.2\u0004 \u22120.\u00044 \u22120.27 \u22120.2\u0004 \u22120.4\u0004 \u22120.27\n(\u22122.\u00049)** (\u22120.\u00043) (\u22122.\u00043)** (\u22122.\u0004\u0004)** (\u22120.\u00049) (\u22122.0\u0004)**\nInvestment \u0004.\u0004\u0004 \u0004.\u0004\u0004 \u0004.\u00049 \u0004.\u0004\u0004 \u0004.7\u0004 \u0004.\u00049\n(4.\u0004)*** (2.\u0004\u0004)*** (3.97)*** (4.0\u0004)*** (2.\u0004\u0004)*** (3.9)***\nOpenness 0.07 0.\u00043 0.09 0.07 0.\u00040 0.09\n(0.34) (0.\u00049) (0.4\u0004) (0.34) (0.\u00044) (0.42)\nInflation 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n(0.\u0004) (\u22120.49) (0.\u0004\u0004) (0.\u0004) (\u22120.44) (0.\u0004\u0004)\nHuman Capital 0.0\u0004 0.03 0.0\u0004 0.0\u0004 0.03 0.0\u0004\n(\u0004.4) (\u0004.\u0004\u0004)* (\u0004.4\u0004) (\u0004.3\u0004) (\u0004.9)* (\u0004.4)\nObs. 7\u0004 7\u0004 7\u0004 7\u0004 7\u0004 7\u0004\nCountries \u2212 27 27 \u2212 27 27\nF / Wald Test 4.73 \u0004.9\u0004 2\u0004.\u00040 4.00 \u0004.7\u0004 24.\u00040\nGDP = gross domestic product.\nNotes:   The dependent variable is logarithm economic growth.

First, remittances \ntypically respond to changes in household income (e.g., altruistic remitters may decrease their ", "\u0018\u0018 |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 18\u0018\ntransfers as household income increases) and second, it may often be the case that for many \nhouseholds, income is strongly related to local macroeconomic conditions. As such, remittances, \nin addition to having an impact on growth, may be also responding to output growth. In this type \nof scenario, the estimated coefficients are biased and inconsistent. Therefore, we also conduct \nan instrumental variable estimation. The first set of instruments used is chosen based on the \ninstruments used by Adams and Page (2005) and Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004).\nAdams and Page (2005) used three instruments for remittances: distance between the remittance \nsending and receiving countries, level of education, and government stability. The first variable \ncannot be used without strong further assumptions that may not hold for the case of Asian \ncountries. Data on remittance bilateral flows is not readily available. Therefore, Adams and Page \n(2005) estimate the distance between the home country and the main remittance-sending country. \nThis works if flows were mainly coming from one specific country (e.g., US and Mexico), but as \nwe explained above, flows to Asian countries come from different parts of the world such as US, \nEurope, and Middle East. Therefore, just choosing one (or a combination) of these regions is not \nfeasible. But even more crucial, it is possible to attest that the distance variable is not as relevant \nfor a regional study such as the current one. For instance, while there is a distance gap between \nIndia and the Philippines, in relative terms, these are countries that are close to each other. \nHence, we feel that this instrument is better fitted for global studies. The second variable used by \nAdams and Page (2005) is education, which is one of our regressors and given the importance \nof education for economic growth, we prefer to use this variable as a regular regressor. As a \nconsequence, we are only left with government stability and we include this variable as one of our \ninstruments.\nAmuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) used as instruments education, the rate of vaccination \ncoverage of children less than 1 year of age, the crop production index, and the livestock \nproduction index. As we mentioned above, we prefer not to use education as an instrument. \nFurthermore, the rate of vaccination was not available for most countries in our sample. Hence, we \nare left with the last two variables, the crop production index and the livestock production index, \nwhich we also use as instruments.\nIn sum, to instrument remittances, we used the crop production index and the live stock production \nindex of the remittance-receiving country obtained from the World Development Indicators and \nthe government stability index for these countries from the Political Risk Services group. Due to \ndata limitations, we lose an important number of the observations in the instrumental variable \nestimation. In particular, we are left with only 101 observations for 15 countries for the annual \ndata set and 46 observations for 15 countries for the 5-year averages data set. The results from \nthe instrumental variable estimation are shown in Table A2. The results for columns (1) and (2) \nthat deal with annual data (fixed and random effect estimations) seem to differ somewhat from \nour previous findings. Remittances have a positive effect on economic growth when annual data \nis used, but the effect is significant only in the random effects estimation. The results using 5-\nyear averages are also not consistent. The fixed-effects estimation (column [3]) suggests that \nremittances have no significant impact on growth, yet the random-effects estimation (column [4]) \nsuggests otherwise. Given these mixed results, we explore the instrumental variable estimation \nfurther using the instrument recommended by Barajas et al. (2009).", "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth  | \u0018\u0018\nTable A2: IV Estimation Results for Economic Growth: Traditional Instruments\nVariable (1) (2) (3) (4)\nRemittances 0.\u0004\u0004 0.2\u0004 \u0004.\u00044 0.4\u0004\n(\u0004.0\u0004) (\u0004.\u00042)* (\u0004.\u0004\u0004) (\u0004.7\u0004)*\nInitial GDP \u2212 0.\u0004\u0004 \u22122.04 0.07\n(2.0\u0004)** (\u2212\u0004.32) (0.\u0004\u0004)\nInvestment \u0004.2\u0004 \u0004.37 2.43 3.00\n(4.9\u0004)*** (\u0004.49)*** (2.3\u0004)** (3.9\u0004)***\nOpenness \u22120.0\u0004 \u22120.30 \u2212\u0004.04 \u22120.39\n(\u22120.\u0004\u0004) (\u2212\u0004.\u0004\u0004) (\u22120.\u0004\u0004) (\u2212\u0004.03)\nInflation 0.0\u0004 0.0\u0004 0.00 0.02\n(0.7\u0004) (0.7\u0004) (\u22120.04) (0.3\u0004)\nHuman Capital 0.0\u0004 0.0\u0004 0.02 0.00\n(\u0004.4\u0004) (\u0004.2\u0004) (0.\u00049) (\u22120.\u0004\u0004)\nObs. \u00040\u0004 \u00040\u0004 4\u0004 4\u0004\nCountries \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004 \u0004\u0004\nF / Wald Test \u0004303.27 39.\u00047 \u0004\u0004.07 23.\u00040\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes:   The dependent variable is economic growth.

Barajas et al. (2009) recently proposed the use of the ratio of remittances to GDP of \nall the other countries in the sample as an instrument for remittances. This variable reflects the \nfunctioning of the global remittances system and can provide some indication of the reduction \nin the costs of remitting across time. Still, this is not a perfect instrument. It does not provide \ninformation about country-specific factors and it does not vary much from country to country. \nNonetheless, the instrument certainly has merit and it is an improvement over previous instruments \nin the literature, so for robustness purposes, we include Table A3 in which we provide the results \nof the fixed-effects estimation when such instrumental variable is selected. In all cases, the impact \nof remittances on economic growth seems to be positive. However, in none of the cases is the \nimpact significant.

The key results indicate that \nremittances positively affect the growth of home country real gross domestic product \nper capita, but only have a negligible effect on the overall poverty rate. The remittances, \nhowever, tend to reduce the poverty gap and thereby ameliorate the depth of poverty. \nThe robustness of the key results is assessed using 5-year average data, while the potential \nendogeneity issues in the estimation are addressed through the use of instrumental \nvariables.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their \npeople. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s \npoor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less \nthan $1.25 a day.  ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic \ngrowth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. \n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/economics\nISSN: 1655-5252\nPublication Stock No. \nPrinted in the Philippines"], "metadata": {"Author": "Carlos Vargas-Silva, Shikha Jha and Guntur Sugiyarto", "CreationDate": "D:20091215112904+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0)", "Keywords": "migration, migration process, remittances, impact of remittances, poverty, gross domestic product, gdp, people\u2019s republic of china, prc, economic growth, impacts, economic working paper number 182", "ModDate": "D:20100817152941+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 7.0", "Subject": "This study examines the potential of remittances for promoting economic growth and reducing poverty in Asian countries using data for more than 20 countries in the region for 1988\u20132007", "Title": "Remittances in Asia: Implications for the Fight against Poverty and the Pursuit of Economic Growth (No. 182)", "Trapped": "False"}}
