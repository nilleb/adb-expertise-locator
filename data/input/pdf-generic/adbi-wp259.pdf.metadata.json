International standard setters\u2019 and national regulators\u2019 response has been a global \nconcerted  effort  to  overhaul  and  tighten  financial  regulations.  However,  at  a  time  of \ndesigning stricter regulations, it is crucial to avoid a backlash against financial inclusion. \n\nIn  this  chapter,  we  argue  that greater financial  inclusion  presents  opportunities  to  enhance \nfinancial stability. Our arguments are based on the following insights: \n\n\u2014Financial  inclusion  poses  risks  at  the  institutional  level,  but  these  are  hardly  systemic  in \nnature.  Evidence  suggests  that  low-income  savers  and  borrowers  tend  to  maintain  solid \nfinancial  behavior  throughout  financial  crises,  keeping  deposits  in  a  safe  place  and  paying \nback their loans. \n\n\u2014Institutional  risk  profiles  at  the  bottom  end  of  the  financial  market  are  characterized  by \nlarge  numbers  of  vulnerable  clients  who  own  limited  balances  and transact  small  volumes. \nAlthough  this  profile  may  raise  some  concerns  regarding  reputational  risks  for  the  central \nbank  and  consumer  protection,  in  terms  of  financial  instability,  the  risk  posed  by  inclusive \npolicies is negligible. \n\n\u2014In addition, risks prevalent at the institutional level are manageable with known prudential \ntools and more effective customer protection. \n\n\u2014The  potential  costs  of  financial  inclusion  are  compensated  for  by  important  dynamic \nbenefits  that  enhance  financial  stability  over  time  through  a  deeper  and  more  diversified \nfinancial system. \n\nIn the following  pages, we  present the  current  state  of financial  inclusion globally. We  also \nexplore some trends in financial inclusion and what the most effective policies are to favor it. \nIn  doing  so,  we  suggest  that  innovations  aimed  at  countering  financial  exclusion  may  help \nstrengthen financial systems rather than weakening them. \n\n \nJEL Classification: E44, G15, G18, G20, G21, G28 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\nContents \n1.\n\nWhat Is Financial Inclusion? ........................................................................................... 1\n\n2.\n \n\nHow to Measure Progress? ............................................................................................ 3\n \n\n3.\n \n\nFinancial Inclusion Trends .............................................................................................. 4\n \n\n4.\n \n\nThe Relation between Poverty and Financial Inclusion: Recent Evidence ...................... 8\n \n\nMacroeconomic Evidence ............................................................................... 11\n \nMicroeconomic Evidence ................................................................................ 12\n \nFinancial Inclusion Policies: Recent Innovation ............................................................ 13\n \n\n4.1\n4.2\n \n \n\nAgent Banking ................................................................................................ 14\n \nMobile Payments ............................................................................................ 15\n \nDiversifying Providers ..................................................................................... 17\n \nState Bank Reform .......................................................................................... 18\n \nConsumer Protection ...................................................................................... 18\n \nFinancial Identity ............................................................................................. 19\n \nAssessment .................................................................................................... 20\n \nTrade-offs and Synergies between Financial Inclusion and Stability ............................. 21\n \n\n5.1\n5.2\n \n5.3\n \n5.4\n \n5.5\n \n5.6\n \n5.7\n \n \n\n \n\n6.1\n6.2\n \n \n\nFinancial Inclusion: A Potential Cause of Financial Instability?........................ 22\n \nFinancial Inclusion: Cushioning Crisis Impact at the Local Level? ................... 23\n \nConclusions and Recommendations: How Financial Inclusion Equips the Poor to Cope \n \nwith Instability .................................................................................................................. 24\n \n\nReferences ......................................................................................................................... 26\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\n1.  WHAT IS FINANCIAL INCLUSION?  \n\nFinancial  inclusion  aims  at  drawing  the  \u201cunbanked\u201d  population  into  the  formal  financial \nsystem so that they have the opportunity to access financial services ranging from savings, \npayments,  and  transfers  to  credit  and  insurance.  Financial  inclusion  neither  implies  that \neverybody  should  make  use  of  the  supply,  nor  that  providers  should  disregard  risks  and \nother  costs  when  deciding  to  offer  services.  Both  voluntary  exclusion  and  unfavorable  risk-\nreturn  characteristics  may  preclude  a  household  or  a  small  firm,  despite  unrestrained \naccess, from using one or more of the services. Such outcomes do not necessarily warrant \npolicy  intervention.  Rather,  policy  initiatives  should  aim  to  correct  market  failures  and  to \neliminate nonmarket barriers to accessing a broad range of financial services. 1\n\n  \n\nDespite  the  considerable  progress  made  by  microfinance  institutions,  credit  unions,  and \nsavings  cooperatives  over  the  last  two  decades,  the  majority  of  the  world\u2019s  poor  remain \nunserved  by  formal  financial  intermediaries  that  can  safely  manage  cash  and  intermediate \nbetween  net  savers  and  net  borrowers.  According  to  the  Consultative  Group  to  Assist  the \nPoor (CGAP), the absolute number of savings accounts worldwide is reported to exceed the \n2   And  yet  half  of  the  world\u2019s  adult  population\u20142.5  billion  people\u2014does \nglobal  population.\nnot, in fact, have access to savings accounts and other formal financial services.3\n \n\nFinancial inclusion as a policy objective represents the current consensus in a long-standing \ndebate on the contribution of finance to economic development and poverty reduction (see \nBox  1).  It  reflects  the  evolution  of  financial  sector  policies  in  developing  countries  over  the \npast  decades,  and  embodies  important  insights  into  the  positive  impact  that  financial \nservices  have  on  the  (economic)  lives  of  the  poor.\n   Financial  sector  policies  have  evolved \nthrough three stylized stages: first, fostering state-led industrial and agricultural development \nthrough  directed  credit;  second,  market-led  development \nliberalization  and \nderegulation;  and  third,  institution  building  that  aims  at  balancing  market  and  government \nfailures.  \n\nthrough \n\n4\n\n \n\nBox 1. Financial Development versus Inclusion \n\nConventional measures of financial development reflect traditional policy \nobjectives.  The  focus  on  aggregate  capital  accumulation  resulted  in \n\u201cdomestic  credit  to  the  private  sector\u201d  (as  a  percent  of  GDP)  being  the \nmost  prominent  measure  of  the  \u201cdepth\u201d  of  financial  development.  Its \nimpact  on  growth  is  well  established,  but  it  is  poorly  correlated  with \n\u201cbreadth\u201d  or  financial  access.  Hence  financial  deepening  and  financial \naccess are only weak substitutes as policy goals.  Growing evidence of \nlinks from inclusion to equity, growth, and poverty alleviation have turned \ninclusion into a stand-alone policy objective. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAt least until the 1980s, many developing countries channeled public funds to target groups \nlike  farmers  and  small  enterprises,  and  regulated  the  scope  of  activities  for  which  these \nfunds  could  be  used.  These  \u201cdirected  credit\u201d  programs  assumed  that  the  rural  poor  were \nunable to save or to afford market rates of interest, and therefore need loans at subsidized \nrates to build capital. Hence development banks lent at below-market rates to selected target \ngroups.  To  fund  cheap  loans,  deposit  rates  were  often  subject  to  regulatory  ceilings, \n                                                \n1 . Demirgu\u00e7-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan (2008). \n2.

The  development  benefits  of  financial  services  will  be  addressed  in  the  section  on  implications  for \nmacroeconomic efficiency and welfare. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nundermining  domestic  resource  mobilization.  The  results  of  \u201cfinancial  repression\u201d  were \ntypically  shallow  financial  systems  and  institutions  that  had  little  capacity  to  allocate \nresources  efficiently  according  to  risk-return  characteristics.  In  addition,  poor  targeting \nyielded  transfers  through  highly  repressive  subsidized  interest  rates,  and  subsidies \nweakened  financial  institution  performance.  Not  only  did  these  programs  typically  prove  to \nbe  unsustainable,  they  also  did  not  improve  outreach  of  financial  services  to  the  poor, \nparticularly in rural areas. \n\nAt  the  end  of  the  1980s,  a  new  approach  emerged  that  focused  on  the  performance  of \nfinancial institutions in delivering their services to segments of the population with little or no \naccess  to finance. The  changes  were substantial: the  new  approach  shifted  the  discussion \naway  from  individual  firms  and  households  onto  institutions  and  their  ability  to  provide \nservices  on  a  sustainable  and  widespread  basis.  Initial  experiences  in  Indonesia, \nBangladesh,  Bolivia,  and  some  other  countries  demonstrated  that  microfinance  and  rural \nfinance  conceived  as  \u201cbanking  with  the  poor\u201d  are  indeed  financially  viable  and  may  thus \nincrease  outreach  on  a sustainable  basis. These  encouraging  examples  led  to  a  new  view \ncalled the \u201cfinancial system\u201d paradigm.5\n  The underlying assumptions of this approach were \nthat  poor  people can generate  an  economic  surplus,  which  enables  them to  repay  the real \ncosts of loans and to save. The term microfinance came to replace \u201cmicrocredit,\u201d the former \nbeing  used  increasingly  to  refer  to  a  variety  of  financial  products  such  as  loans,  deposits, \ninsurance,  payments,  and  remittances  offered  by  a  variety  of  regulated  and  unregulated \nfinancial institutions.  \n\n6\n\nOver the  past few  years,  microfinance  has  undergone  a  rapid  transformation  as  its  links to \nthe  formal  financial  system  have  been  expanded.  Growing  theoretical  and  empirical \nevidence  suggests  that  financial  systems  that  serve  low-income  people  promote  pro-poor \n Lack  of  access  to  finance,  therefore,  adversely  affects  growth  and  poverty \ngrowth.\nalleviation. It makes it more difficult for the poor to accumulate savings and build assets to \nprotect  against  risks,  as  well  as  to  invest  in  income-generating  projects.  As  a  result,  the \ninterest  in  financial  sector  development  has  increasingly  focused  on  the  factors  that \ndetermine not only the depth but also breadth of access, in a move toward inclusive financial \nsystems. \n\nWith  this  increased  attention  to  the  poverty  alleviation  aspects  of finance,  policy  objectives \nare being constantly expanded to include more quality access to a wider range of financial \n7  This  trend  has  been  facilitated  by  the  development  and  rapid  diffusion  of \nservices.\ninformation and communication technology that dramatically reduces the cost of connecting \nusers to formal financial institutions through payment systems, with potential spillovers into a \nbroader range of services.8\n  \n\nAgainst  this  background,  financial  services  to  the  unbanked  have  become  a  major  area  of \ninterest for policymakers, practitioners, and academics who increasingly emphasize financial \ninclusion as a policy objective. The notion of building inclusive financial systems recognizes \nnot only the goal of incorporating as many poor and previously excluded people as possible \ninto  the  formal  financial  system,  but  it  also  assigns  to  mainstream  financial  institutions  the \n9\nrole of reaching out to the unbanked.\n  From this perspective, microfinance is now seen as \nan integral part of an inclusive financial system. As a result, financial inclusion has become \nan  important  policy  goal  that  complements  the  traditional  pillars  of  monetary  and  financial \nstability,  as  well  as  other  regulatory  objectives  such  as  consumer  protection.    Policies  to \nencourage  increased  access  for  the  previously  unbanked  must,  however,  take  into \n\n                                                \n5.  Otero and Rhyne (1994). \n6.

Today,  it  is \nunderstood  that  poor  households  rely  on  a  variety  of  financial  instruments  in  the  daily \nmanagement  of  their  cash  flows  and  risks,  and  in  their  endeavors  to  build  assets  through \nsaving.  Tools  such  as  financial  diaries  show  that  the  key  challenge  faced  by  these  low-\n11 The  average  income  at  the \nincome  households  is  the  irregularity  of  their  cash  flows.\ninternational  poverty  line  of  $2  a  day  translates  in  practice  into  a  highly  variable  flow  that \nrequires  active  management  to  smooth  consumption  and  reduce  vulnerability  to  various \nshocks, such as health risks, as well as to cope with major life cycle events.12\n \n\n2.  HOW TO MEASURE PROGRESS?  \n\nReliable and comprehensive data that capture various dimensions of financial inclusion are a \ncritical condition for evidence-based policymaking.13\n That includes the definition of consistent \nfinancial  inclusion  indicators  that  not  only  may  set  a  clear  direction  for  policymaking  by \ntranslating  the  concept  of  financial  inclusion  into  operational  terms  but  also  may  allow \ntracking progress and measuring outcomes of policy reforms. \n\nThis  presents  several  challenges,  though.  Thus  the  definition  of  financial  indicators  has \ntraditionally  been  shaped  by  previously  formulated  policy  objectives.  On  other  occasions, \nsome  indicators  may  introduce  important  distortions  into  the  analysis  prior  to  policymaking \ndiscussions by prioritizing aggregate volumes over numbers and characteristics of clients. \n\nBroadly speaking, financial inclusion can be measured through the following lenses in order \nof complexity:  \n\n\u2014Access:  the  ability  to  use  available  financial  services  and  products  from  formal \ninstitutions. Understanding levels of access may require insight into and analysis of \npotential  barriers  to  opening  and  using  a  bank  account  for  any  purpose,  such  as \ncost  and  physical  proximity  of  bank  service  points  (for  example,  branches  and \nATMs).  A  very  basic  proxy  for  access  can  be  derived  by  counting  the  number  of \nopen  accounts  across  financial  institutions  and  estimating  the  proportion  of  the \npopulation with an account.    \n\n\u2014Quality: the relevance of the financial service or product to the lifestyle needs of \nthe consumer. Quality encompasses the experience of the consumer, demonstrated \nin attitudes and opinions toward those products that are currently available to them.  \nThe measure of quality therefore would be used to gauge the nature and depth of \nthe relationship between the financial service provider and the consumer as well as \nthe choices available and consumers\u2019 levels of understanding of those choices and \ntheir implications.  \n\n\u2014Usage:  beyond  the  basic  adoption  of  banking  services,  usage  focuses  more  on \nthe permanence and depth of financial service and product use. Hence determining \n\n                                                \n10.

To measure usage, it is critical that information reflect the user\u2019s point of \nview, that is, data gathered through a demand-side survey.      \n\n\u2014Impact: measuring changes in the lives of consumers that can be attributed to the \nusage  of  a  financial  device  or  service  poses  serious  methodological  challenges  to \nsurvey design. \n\nThis  information  can  be  sourced  either  from  the  demand  side,  that  is,  at  the  individual, \nhousehold, or firm level, or from the supply side, that is, at the level of a financial institution, \nor from a combination of both. The key surveys that have produced relevant data have been \ncompiled by CGAP.14\n\n \n\nWith  all  these  elements  in  mind,  it  can  be  stated  that  measurement  of  financial  inclusion \nserves  two  primary  objectives  that  imply  different  data  needs:  first,  measuring  and \nmonitoring levels of financial inclusion, and second, deepening understanding about factors \nthat correlate with financial inclusion and, subsequently, the impact of policies.   \n\nThese primary objectives can be broken down to more basic levels (Figure 1). Measurement \ndata can be used to approximate the number of people who have access to or are currently \nusing some type of financial service or product. Provided these data can be linked to other \nin-country  factors,  such  as  population  characteristics,  they  can  also  help  identify  priorities \nand catalyze changes in policy and approach. If collected repeatedly, these data can also be \nused  to  monitor  progress  over  time.    On  the  other  hand,  data  can  also  deepen \nunderstanding of the problem of financial inclusion. This is typically entails a more complex \nmethod  of  design  and  collection.  This  type  of  data  is  more  appropriate  to  support  solution \nbuilding and impact measurement of policies put in place. \n\nFigure 1: Measurement Objectives \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Porteous (2009). \n\n3.  FINANCIAL INCLUSION TRENDS  \n\nThere has been significant but uneven progress toward financial inclusion around the world \nin recent years. Some of these steps have been driven by market-friendly policies that will be \npresented in more detail in a later section.  \n\n                                                \n14. Kneiding, Al-Hussayni, and Mas (2009).  \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nSome countries in Asia, such as India and Indonesia, have a long tradition of emphasizing \naccess to finance.15\n  At the regional level, these policy priorities have paid off: 25 percent of \nhouseholds living on less than $2 a day now have access to formal or semiformal financial \nservices, compared to 40\u201350 percent of the population as a whole.  \n\nOther success stories include: \n\n\u2014Mongolia: a successful turnaround of a state bank increased the number of deposit \naccounts by over 1.4 million since 2006, now reaching 62 percent of households. \n\n\u2014Philippines: mobile phone banking has expanded to serve to 4 million clients since \n2002. \n\n\u2014India:  access  to  credit  among  the  poor  is  up  from  7  percent  in  2004  to  20\u20135 \npercent in 2009, as the microfinance sector added 9.9 million clients. \n\n\u2014Bangladesh:  4\u20136  million  new  microcredit  clients  have  been  added  since  2006; \nfinancial  services  have  reached  about  55  percent  of  poor  households,  substantially \nexpanding access to savings. \n\n\u2014Viet Nam: 2.1 million new microfinance clients have been added since 2006. \n\nIn contrast, access in People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) appears to have declined since the \nreforms of the rural cooperatives. Also, India\u2019s poor have little access to deposits: \u201cno frills\u201d \naccounts have increased to over 28 million, but studies show that many of these are barely \nused.  \n\nParticularly in Asia, the poor are often served by public banks or nonbank entities, including \nnongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs),  with  private  sector  banks  playing  a  smaller  role. \nKey examples of these public banks and nonbank entities include:  \n\n\u2014Pakistan:  Post Savings Bank, with 3.6 million accounts in 2006. \n\n\u2014India:  post offices, with 60.8 million savings accounts as of March 2007. \n\n\u2014Bangladesh: Rural Development Board, with 4.7 million active borrowers in 2007. \n\n\u2014Viet  Nam:    Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  with  10  million  farmer \nclients in 2007, and Bank for Social Policy, with 6.79 million active borrowers in 2008.  \n\n\u2014Thailand: Government Savings Bank, with 36 million accounts in 2006.  \n\n\u2014Sri Lanka: state banks, which were used by 72 percent households by the end of \n2006. \n\nHowever,  despite  this  outreach,  service  quality  is  inferior,  and  most  institutions  depend  on \nsubsidies.

THE RELATION BETWEEN POVERTY AND FINANCIAL \n\nINCLUSION: RECENT EVIDENCE  \n\nAs  mentioned  previously,  collecting  reliable  financial  data  is  not  an  easy  task.  A  common \nobstacle  is  that  both  current  levels  and  recent  progress  in  financial  inclusion  vary \nsubstantially across countries. Most countries are only beginning to track financial inclusion, \nso data for projecting longer-term trends are not yet available.  In addition, comparing survey \nresults  across  countries is  often  difficult  because methodologies used  often  differ from  one \nsurvey to the next. \n\nCGAP\u2019s Financial Access 2009, a global survey of regulators with regard to financial access, \nfocuses on individual account holdings with regulated institutions. Using a statistical model to \nfill in data gaps, the survey finds 6.2 billion bank deposit accounts globally. Because of the \naforementioned challenges faced by survey collectors, this number may include substantial \ndouble counting of users, which may therefore mask a rather uneven distribution. Assuming \nthree bank accounts per banked adult, the CGAP survey arrives at an estimate of 2.6 billion \nunbanked adults in the developing world.22\n  \n\n23   It  suggests  that \nAnother  recent  survey  is  the  World  Bank\u2019s  composite  access  indicator.\nfinancial  inclusion  is  an  issue  well  beyond  households  living  on  less  than  $2  a  day  (see \nFigure  4).    Instead,  it  shows  how  in  many  countries,  the  number  of  financially  excluded \nadults significantly exceeds the adult population living under the $2-a-day poverty line.24\n\n \n\n                                                \n22.

Due to data constraints, information on poverty and inclusion is not necessarily from the same year for many \n\ncountries. Both variables are relatively slow moving, though. \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nFigure 4: Poverty and financial exclusion in absolute numbers \n\nPopulation in milions\n\nPopulation under 2$-Poverty Line\n\nPopulation without Access\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\na\ni\nr\ne\ng\nN\n\ni\n\nn\na\nt\ns\nk\na\nP\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\np\no\nh\nt\nE\n\ni\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\ne\nV\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nn\na\nz\nn\na\nT\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\nl\ni\n\nz\na\nr\nB\n\nl\n\na\np\ne\nN\n\na\nd\nn\na\ng\nU\n\nh\ns\ne\nd\na\ng\nn\na\nB\n\nl\n\na\nc\ni\nr\nf\n\nA\n \nh\nt\nu\no\nS\n\na\ny\nn\ne\nK\n\nt\np\ny\ng\nE\n\na\nn\na\nh\nG\n\ni\n\no\nc\nx\ne\nM\n\ni\n\na\nb\nm\no\no\nC\n\nl\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\na\nk\nn\na\nL\n \ni\nr\n\nS\n\ny\ne\nk\nr\nu\nT\n\no\nc\nc\no\nr\no\nM\n\na\nn\ni\nt\nn\ne\ng\nr\nA\n\nu\nr\ne\nP\n\ni\n\na\nv\n\ni\nl\n\no\nB\n\ni\n\na\nn\na\nm\no\nR\n\nr\no\nd\na\nu\nc\nE\n\ni\n\na\ns\ny\na\na\nM\n\nl\n\na\nu\ng\na\nr\na\nc\nN\n\ni\n\ni\n\ne\nn\na\nr\nk\nU\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\ns\nn\nu\nT\n\nd\nn\na\no\nP\n\nl\n\ne\n\nl\ni\n\nh\nC\n\na\ni\nr\na\ng\nu\nB\n\nl\n\ny\nr\na\ng\nn\nu\nH\n\ni\n\n \na\nc\nR\n \na\nt\ns\no\nC\n\nl\n\na\ne\nu\nz\ne\nn\ne\nV\n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\nd\ne\nF\n \nn\na\ns\ns\nu\nR\n\ni\n\na\ni\nt\na\no\nr\n\nC\n\ny\na\nu\ng\nu\nr\n\nU\n\nR\nY\nF\n\ni\n\n \n,\na\nn\no\nd\ne\nc\na\nM\n\n \n\n.\ng\ne\nz\nr\ne\nH\n&\n \na\nn\ns\no\nB\n\ni\n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations based on data from Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan (2008),  \n\nWorld Bank \u201cFinance for All\u201d access data \n(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRES/Resources/PRR_Data_for_Website.xls), and  \n\nWorld Bank World Development Indicators (http://data.worldbank.org). \n\nDoes  this  mean  there  is  not  a  clear  correlation  between  financial  inclusion  and  economic \ndevelopment?  It  seems  obvious  that  financial  inclusion  has  some  relationship  to  economic \ndevelopment. However, as Figure 5 shows, the correlation between GDP per capita and the \ncomposite  indicator  is  imperfect.25\n Thus,  for  a  given  income  level,  there  is  a  wide  variation \naround the conditional mean represented by the regression line. This means that many other \nfactors  play  a  role  determining  the  amount  of  people  without  access  to  formal  financial \nservices.  In  this  sense,  more  research  is  needed  to  analyze  how  policy,  by  making  the \nenvironment more conducive for the expansion of financial access, plays a role in reducing \nfinancial exclusion. \n\n                                                \n25.

Consistent with the evolution of policy objectives, the research focus has \nbeen first on macroeconomic aspects of financial system development; only in recent years \nhas it begun to address the microeconomic impacts of financial inclusion. \n\n4.1  Macroeconomic Evidence  \n\nFinancial  institutions  contribute  to  growth  by  reducing  information  asymmetries  that  would \notherwise hinder the efficient intermediation of resources among savers and investors. There \nis  substantial  evidence  that  financial  development  has  a  causal  impact  on  growth. 26   A \nprominent  explanation  is  Schumpeter\u2019s  view  that  finance  fuels  \u201ccreative  destruction\u201d  by \ntopple \nallocating \nincumbents.27 Along  these  lines,  access  to  finance  for  new  entrepreneurs  is  an  important \ningredient in the finance-growth nexus.28\n  \n\ninnovation  and  possibly \n\nto  newcomers \n\nthat  promote \n\nresources \n\n                                                \n26.

De la Torre, Gozzi, and Schmukler (2007). \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nMore  recently,  the  focus  has  shifted  to  links  between  finance  and  income  inequality.  Beck \nand  others  (2008)  found  a  link  between  financial  development,  reduced  income  inequality, \nand  poverty  alleviation:   the  aggregate  usage  of financial  services, that  is, deeper financial \nsystems, appears to reduce Gini coefficients, a measurement of inequality.    \n\nThere is also evidence at the macroeconomic level that broader financial systems enhance \neconomic  growth.  Gin\u00e9  and  Townsend  (2004)  show  that,  based  on  a  general  equilibrium \nmodel of the Thai economy, the expansion of access to the financial sector has significantly \nraised  Thailand\u2019s  growth  rate.  Conversely,  Banerjee  and  others  (2009)  emphasize  the \nefficiency and productivity losses associated with preferential access to finance by the better \noff, and suggest a potential first-order effect of access on investment and growth. \n\nFinally,  Pande  and  Burgess  (2005)  find  a  strong  positive  effect  on  rural  poverty,  using  a \n\u201cnatural experiment\u201d of new branching regulations in India that incentivized banks to expand \ninto  underserved  areas.  However,  the  high  cost  of  this  expansion  policy  outweighed  the \naggregate  benefits.  This  result  suggests  large  potential  benefits  from  technology-enabled, \nlower-cost branch expansion. \n\n4.2  Microeconomic Evidence  \n\nUntil very recently, the support for financial inclusion from a microeconomic  level has been \nsolely based on plausibility, anecdotal evidence, and data that were not subject to statistical \ntests,  such  as  claims  that  65  percent  of  Grameen  Bank  clients  cross  the  poverty  line. 29\n  \nEstablishing a causal link from the use of financial services to improvements in the lives of \nthe  poor  is  methodologically  challenging  and  very  expensive.  It  requires  eliminating \ninfluences  of  self-selection  and  survivor  biases  in  the  sample,  as  well  as  numerous \nunobservable  effects  that  may  confound  the  analysis.  The  method  of  choice  is  field \nexperiments  that  establish  this  link  through  the  creation  of  a  counterfactual  by  randomly \ndividing  a  subset  of the population  into  treatment  and  control groups.  Statistical  analysis  is \nthen used to identify the differential effects of the intervention, such as exposure to a certain \ntype of financial service.  \n\nThese  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCT)  are  critical  to  underpin  the  claim  that  financial \ninclusion  positively  affects  the  poor.  RCTs  are  not  without  shortcomings,  however:  while \nmethodological  rigor  produces  results  with  high  levels  of  internal  validity,  it  is  much  more \ndifficult to generalize beyond the specific context of the experiment, that is, external validity \nis substantially weaker.\n\n30\n\n \n\nA  number  of  RCTs  have  been  conducted  so  far.    In  Kenya,  a  randomly  selected  group  of \nrural poor were offered savings accounts. The impact was found to be highly positive: uptake \nwas  very  significant  for  female  clients,  and  female  market  vendors  reached  higher  daily \nexpenditure  levels  within  six  months  of  opening  an  account.\n There  was  no  evidence  that \nsavings  accounts  crowd  out  other  investments,  and  neither  was  there  evidence  that  the \nsavings  accounts  allowed  for  more  efficient  smoothing  over  bad  shocks,  particularly \nsickness.  This  study  also  shows  a  more  significant  positive  impact  of  savings  accounts  for \nwomen than for men.  \n\n31\n\nAnother  RCT  example  from  India  provides  evidence  that  the  effect  of  microcredit  depends \non household characteristics:  \n\n\u2014Business  owners  use  credit  to  expand  their  businesses,  as  demonstrated  by  an \nincrease in spending on durables and an increase in business profits.  \n\n                                                \n29.

Dupas and Robinson (2009). \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\n\u2014Those  initially  identified  as  having  a  low  propensity  to  start  a  business  do  not \nincrease \nfood  and \ntransportation.  \n\nincrease  consumption,  such  as \n\ninvestment  but \n\nrather \n\n\u2014Households  with  a  high  propensity  to  start  a  business  reduce  nondurable \nspending, increase durable spending, and reduce temptation spending.32\n \n\nOver  the  eighteen-month  period  of  study,  there  were  no  significant  effects  on  education, \nhealth, or women\u2019s empowerment. However, business outcomes were significantly positive, \nincluding  the  creation  of  new  businesses  and  the  profits  for  existing  business.  While  the \nimpact on female welfare could not be established (despite frequent claims to the contrary), \none has to take into account the limited time horizon. \n\nRecent  research  in  South  Africa  highlights  the  risk  management  benefits  of  financial \ninclusion.  33\n Loan  applicants  that  had  been  declined  \u201cat the margin\u201d  were  randomly  offered \nloans  and  turned  out  to  be  significantly  less  likely  to  report  leaving  a  job  after  entering  the \nexperiment than those rejected clients without loans. Treated households earned more and \nwere  more  likely  to  move  out  of  poverty.  Overall,  increased  access  to  credit  appears  to \nimprove  welfare.    The  study  does  present  evidence  that  short-term  loans  are  an  important \ncash flow management tool and that they have largely positive impacts on people\u2019s welfare, \nparticularly  in  the  area  of  employment  and  income.  The  study  also  found  that  loans  to \ncustomers at (or slightly beyond) the margin were actually profitable. \n\nGiven  the  difficulty  with  drawing  generalized  conclusions  from  RCTs,  new  tools  will  be \nneeded  to  deepen  understanding  about  which  services  matter  most  to  low-income \nhouseholds and microenterprises, how they impact welfare metrics, and how policy tools can \nhelp relax binding constraints on the access frontier. \n\nIn  conclusion,  recent  evaluation  techniques  suggest  that  positive  effects  of  microfinance \nexist,  but  they  may  be  not  as  overwhelming  as  assumed  or  may  take  more  time  to \nmaterialize.  There  is  room  for  further  research  to  produce  more  empirical  evidence  in \nsupport of the need to pursue financial inclusion as a policy objective. \n\n5.  FINANCIAL INCLUSION POLICIES: RECENT \n\nINNOVATION \n\nThe financial sector is prone to market failure and, therefore, is generally heavily regulated. \nThe low-income segment is particularly plagued by information asymmetries as participants \non  the  demand  side  often  lack  a  track  record  or  collateral  to  pacify  lenders\u2019  concerns.  In \naddition,  lenders  lack  experience  in  new  markets  at  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid  and  face \nadjustment  costs  regarding  business  processes.  At  the  same  time,  the  limited  size  of  both \nindividual  transactions  and  the  overall  market  pose  challenges  to  suppliers  that  need  to \nrecover fixed costs.  \n\nHowever,  once  the  pioneers  of  the  microfinance  revolution  demonstrated  tangible  market \nopportunities, substantial business model innovation has expanded the \u201caccess possibilities \nfrontier.\u201d34\n  More recently, technological innovation has dramatically lowered the fixed costs \nof reaching the low-income segment and attracted a broader range of new suppliers.  \n\nPolicies  are  a  key  complement  to  private  sector innovation  through regulatory frameworks, \npublic  ownership,  the  provision  of market  infrastructure,  and measures that  lower  demand-\nside  barriers.  Regulatory  frameworks  determine  the  set  of  institutions  that  are  allowed  to \nenter, shape the scope of available services, and affect institutions\u2019 cost of doing business. \n\n                                                \n32.

Beck and de la Torre (2006). \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nPrudential  regulation  is  critical  to  enable  financial  intermediation  and  facilitate  domestic \nresource mobilization and financial institution growth while simultaneously protecting savers. \nFurthermore,  public  ownership  has  frequently  expanded  outreach  into  segments  that  were \nconsidered beyond the scope of commercial approaches. Secured lending frameworks and \npublic credit registries facilitate transactions despite asymmetric information. Finally, the low \neducation  level  of  poor  clients  suggests  a  need  for  consumer  protection  and  financial \neducation policies.  \n\nPolicymakers  have  struggled  to  accompany  rapid  innovation.  They  have  been  particularly \nsuccessful where they facilitated experimentation within regulatory frameworks that carefully \nlimited  the  potential  risks.  In  some  cases,  policymakers  have  even  taken  the  lead  in \nintroducing new solutions to the market through regulatory or legislative measures or direct \nparticipation in the market. \n\nThe rapid pace of innovation has substantially increased the complexity of policymaking. On \nthe  one  hand,  this  calls  for  a  rethinking  of  policy  principles  with  respect  to  financial \ninclusion.35\n On the other hand, there is substantial scope for stepping up peer-to-peer advice \nas innovative solutions are being generated by developing country regulators.  \n\n36\n\nTo  capture  and  compare  emerging  policy  trends  in  developing  countries,  the  German \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  or  GTZ  (German  Technical  Cooperation) \nassessed  thirty-five  policy  solutions  geared toward  promoting financial  inclusion  across  ten \ncountries.\n   Six  solutions  were  found  to  be  particularly  effective.  Four  have  improved \nconditions for reaching the poor through various channels, including agent banking, mobile \npayments, diversification of providers, and state bank reforms. The remaining two solutions \nare  consumer  protection  and  financial  identity  policies,  which  play  key  roles  in  enabling \nfinancial inclusion. \n\n5.1  Agent Banking \n\nPolicies  that  enable  banks  to  contract  with  nonbank  retail  agents  as  outlets  for  financial \nservices  have  proven  highly  successful  in  advancing  financial  inclusion  where  bank \nbranches are not economically viable. Such policies leverage existing retail infrastructure as \ndelivery channels, and turn pharmacies, post offices, or supermarkets not only into agents of \nbanks but agents of financial inclusion. \n\nCollaboration among banks and agents has become possible as technology has reduced the \ncosts  and  risks  of  the  remote  exchange  of  information  to  carry  out  financial  transactions. \nCoupled  with  simplified  account  opening  procedures  and  other  incentives  to  use  this \nchannel,  such  as  the  delivery  of  cash  transfers,  financial  system  outreach  and  numbers  of \nusers can increase explosively, as recently observed in Brazil. \n\nBrazil was the early leader in agent banking through the large-scale introduction of \u201cbanking \ncorrespondents\u201d to distribute welfare grants to unbanked Brazilians. This solution addressed \na key physical access barrier: only 1,600 municipalities had bank branches in 2000. 37 Today, \nsome  95,000  correspondents  cover  all  of  the  5,500  municipalities,  and  nearly  12  million \naccounts  were  opened  at  agents  over  three  years.  The  Brazilian  success  has  inspired \nsimilar  approaches  in  Colombia,  Peru,  Mexico,  and  Chile. 38\n   In  2006  Colombia  passed \n\n                                                \n35.

With a huge percentage of population concentrated in large cities, the minority living \nin  remote  rural  areas  do  not  receive  enough  attention  in  terms  of  infrastructure, \ncommunications  development,  and  services.  This  is  particularly  evident  in  countries  like \nBrazil or Peru, where these minorities account for millions of people, affecting equally both \npoor  and  better-off  residents.  That  is  why,  as  shown  in  Figure  4,  in  countries  like  Brazil, \nRussia,  or  Mexico,  the  population  without  access  to  financial  services  outnumbers  the \npopulation living on less than $2 a day to a greater extent than holds in smaller countries. \n\nCritical  features  of  the  agent  banking  model  are  timely  transaction  settlement  to  minimize \nfraud,  simplified  account  opening  procedures,  and  customer  due  diligence  compliant  with \ninternational know-your-customer standards. The cost savings are substantial: according to \nthe  Peruvian  Superintendence  of  Banks,  forty  banking  agents  may  be  established  for \nroughly the same cost as one bank branch.40\n \n\nThe experience of Brazil offers valuable lessons for countries. A Brazilian agent is a service \nprovider  of  a  bank  or  other  financial  institution.  Any  institution  that  is  supervised  by  the \ncentral bank can contract an agent, and anyone can become an agent as long as the bank \ntakes the responsibility and the relationship is governed by a public contract. The success of \nthis model is based on its pragmatic and flexible approach. While the oversight is focused on \nthe financial institution, with the central bank getting access to all data on the agent, it also \ngives the financial institution enough freedom to articulate the relationship with the agent on \nits  own  terms.  The  Mexican  case  shows  that  know-your-customer  procedures  for  smaller \ntransaction authority can also be delegated to agents. \n\n5.2  Mobile Payments \n\nGlobally, 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions were projected for 2009, well over half of them \nin  the  developing  world. 41   Mobile  phone  penetration  in  developing  countries  has  almost \ntripled in the past five years, with Asia in particular showing high growth rates (see Figure 7). \nIn Kenya, for example, 47 percent of adults own a mobile phone, and the rate of ownership \nrises to 73 percent in urban areas and 80 percent in Nairobi.42\n\n \n\n                                                \n39.

Where  mobile  payments  have  taken  root,  regulators  have  tended  to \nadopt  a  \u201ctest  and  see\u201d  approach  that  allows  operators  to  experiment  and  develop  their \nbusiness  models  under  close  supervision.  Once  market  innovation  and  learning  have \nsatisfied  the  needs  of  regulators  and  mobile  operators,  regulation  has  been  created  and \nimplemented  to  provide  legal  certainty  and  to  create  a  level  playing  field  to  allow  new \nplayers. \n\n5.3  Diversifying Providers \n\nPolicymakers  have  adopted  various  regulatory  and  supervisory  strategies  to  manage  the \nrisks  of  licensing  a  wider  range  of  institutions  to  offer  deposit  and  insurance  products. \nStrategies to adapt banking regulations to the specific nature of microfinance include:  \n\n\u2014licenses for specialized institutions dedicated to taking microdeposits,  \n\n\u2014bank licenses for successfully transforming financial NGOs, or  \n\n\u2014licenses for nonbank financial institutions.  \n\nA tiered regulatory approach that differentiates institutions by permissible activities and limits \ncredit  risk  exposure  of  lower-tier  institutions  minimizes  risk  from  the  central  bank\u2019s \nstandpoint.46\n   Regardless  of  the  strategy  chosen,  high-level  political  leadership  has  proven \ncritical in catalyzing regulatory initiatives to broaden access. \n\nIn  Peru,  Bolivia,  and  Uganda,  regulators  have  incorporated  nonprofit  innovators  into  the \n   This  has  led  to  higher  savings, \nformal  system  by  creating  legal  paths  toward  a  license.\nbenefiting not only consumers but also institutions, enabling them to weather financial crises \nby making them less dependent on external and wholesale funding.  \n\n47\n\nIn  Bolivia  two  microfinance  NGOs  that  transformed  into  banks,  and  six  nonbank  deposit-\ntaking microfinance institutions (known as private financial funds), operating under a special \nregulatory  framework,  held  a  combined  $955  million  in  deposits  as  of  June  2008.  Of  this \namount, $458 million were held by the private financial funds, which opened almost 136,000 \n48  New laws, specially designed for previously \nnew savings accounts in the first half of 2008.\nunregulated NGOs, were passed in 2008.49\n The main difference from the preceding model is \nthat NGOs will not need to be transformed into private financial funds. Instead, they will keep \ntheir  nonprofit  status  and  be  allowed  to  collect  deposits  and  offer  extra  financial  services. \nNGOs will have the nature of nonbanking financial intermediaries but will be under the same \nrules as banks and financial entities. \n\nIn  Indonesia  the  entry  barriers  to  the  financial  sector  were  lowered  by  the  introduction  of \nsecond-tier  rural  banks  during  financial  sector  liberalization  in  the  late  1980s.  After  initial \nexplosive  growth  due  to  a  very  liberal  licensing  regime  and  postcrisis  consolidation,  today \nthere  are  1,800  rural  banks  that  hold  more  than  $2  billion  in  deposits  in  9.8  million \naccounts.\n\n50\n \n\n                                                \n46.

They are present in about 73 of 102 countries, where \nthey hold roughly 15 percent of banking assets.51  Public banks often are the only financial \ninstitutions  in rural  areas  with  large  branch  networks,  not  least  because governments  have \nused  public  banks  extensively  to  promote  savings  and  credit  in  areas  of  less  commercial \ninterest, such as agriculture or housing, and to implement social programs.52\n  \n\nThe global picture is rather mixed: some governments have closed down poorly performing \nstate banks as the least-cost choice, as did Benin, Brazil, and Peru, while others continue to \nsuffer  from  political  interference  and  mediocre  performance.  More  interesting,  however, \nsome  policymaker-pushed  reforms  have  demonstrated  the  potential  to  turn  financial \ninclusion into a new, profitable business for state banks.  \n\nRather  than  restructuring  the  whole  bank,  Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI)  and  Banco  do \nNordeste  in  Brazil,  for  example,  created  separate  lines  of  business  to  introduce  profitable \nmicrofinance  operations.  Key  success  factors  were  governance  reform  and  state-of-the-art \nmicrocredit technologies.  \nBRI  has  over  4,200  village  units  that  serve  3.5  million  borrowers  and  21  million  savers.53\n  \nThe  profit  of  BRI\u2019s  microfinance  operations  (27  percent  of  total  loan  portfolio)  cross-\nsubsidized the less successful banking operations during the Asian crisis.   \n\nBanco  do  Nordeste\u2019s  \u201cCrediAmigo\u201d  has  grown  rapidly,  becoming  to  be  the  second  largest \nmicrocredit program in Latin America since it was launched in the late 1990s. CrediAmigo is \na microfinance line of business that operates in 2,000 municipalities, providing microcredit to \n400,000 clients for a total portfolio of $155 million.\n\n54\n\n \n\n5.5  Consumer Protection \n\nEvery  year  150  million  new  customers  enter  financial  markets  worldwide.  Information \nasymmetry  between  consumers  and  banks  regarding  financial  products  and  services  puts \nthese  new  customers  at  a  disadvantage.  This  imbalance  is  greatest  when  customers  are \nless  experienced  and  the  products  are  more  sophisticated.  Progress  on  financial  inclusion \ntherefore carries the risk of producing more inexperienced and vulnerable customers. \n\nMany  financial  institutions  ensure  that  these  customers  are  well  served,  but  some  have \nabused  their  information  advantage  to  increase  profits  at  the  expense  of  consumers  who \nfound themselves overindebted, underinsured, or without a return on their investment.  This \nwas the case in Bolivia during the early 2000s, where the combination of financial illiteracy, \nunethical  practices  of  some  institutions,  and  some  voids  in  the  legal  framework  resulted  in \nabuses. Preventing these situations is critical.   \n\nConsumer  protection  is  generally  considered  to  be  a  regulatory  response  to  a  market \nfailure. 55\n Appropriate  regulation  should  correct  information  imbalance  and  encourage \nsustainable  market  expansion  through  timely  information  disclosure  throughout  the  service \nrelationship\u2014before,  during,  and  after  the  contract.    Disclosure  in  manageable  portions \nhelps consumers better understand their rights and obligations. \n\n                                                \n51. CGAP (2009b).  \n52.

Supervisory  tools \ninclude  reviewing  product-related  information,  conducting  on-site  reviews,  telephone \ninterviews, and media surveillance, as well as industry and consumer surveys. \n\nConsumer  education  can  help  balance  information  asymmetries  between  consumers  and \nproviders  of financial  services.  New,  inexperienced  entrants  to  the market  are  especially  in \nneed  of  education  about  their  rights  and  responsibilities.  Consumer  education  may  be \ndelivered  by  government  agencies,  consumer  associations,  or  the  industry,  but  most  often \nconsumer education programs are provided through public campaigns that use the Internet; \nprint, radio, and television media; advertising; publications; and training.\n\n58\n \n\nPeru has reduced the number of complaints across the financial system by 32 percent since \n2004 due to the implementation of a holistic system of consumer protection. The regulatory \nagency supervises consumer protection policies and procedures by financial institutions but \ndoes  not  directly  respond  to  complaints.  In  2008,  99  percent  of  nearly  400,000  complaints \nwere  successfully  handled  by  the  financial  institution  itself.  Of  the  remaining  4,000 \ncomplaints, two-thirds were referred to the Consumer Protection Commission, and one-third \nwas  referred  to  the  financial  ombudsman.  In  addition  to  oversight  by  the  regulator  and \nmultiple  channels  for  redress,  Peruvian  consumers  have  access  to  cost  information  about \nfinancial services, published daily in newspapers. When this information was first published, \ninterest rates dropped by as much as 15 percent in six months. \n\n5.6  Financial Identity \n\nIn most countries, credit information is only provided above a certain loan amount, effectively \nexcluding  poor  customers  from  the  demonstrated  benefits  of  information  cost  reduction \nprovided  by  credit  registries.  More  fundamentally,  such  clients  may  not  even  have  the \nidentification documents required to open a bank account.  \n\nPolicymakers have begun to address these barriers to access by narrowing the gap between \nthe  documentation \nthe  quality  of \ndocumentation prevalent among low-income clients. As a result, these policies endow clients \nwith a financial history and transform their transaction history into a financial asset that they \ncan use to leverage access to credit and other banking services. \n\nthreshold  associated  with  bank  accounts  and \n\nIn lowering documentation barriers to entry, regulators must decide on the level of risk they \nwant to accept to promote inclusion.  To reduce credit and identification risks, Indonesia has \nstarted  to  collect  local  information  in  the  informal  financial  sector,  especially  among  the \npooled funds that are popular among the rural poor. This is an opportunity to capture crucial \ninformation on financial identity and financial history. In India stringent know-your-customer \nnorms have been relaxed to allow the creation of low-risk, basic bank accounts with a letter \nfrom  the  local  government.  In  South  Africa,  the  regulator  has  allowed  industry  to  lead  the \nway  in  proposing  systems  to  identify  their  rural  clients,  as  long  as  providers  are  able  to \nensure the proper assessments, enforcement, and consumer protection. \n\n                                                \n56.  Regulatory  capture,  whereby  regulatory  agents  come  to  be  dominated  by  the  industry  they  regulate,  is  a \n\nrecognized feature of financial markets.  For an insightful take on regulatory capture, see Kay (2009). \n\n57.  Independent  advocates  are  rare  in  emerging  markets,  where  most  advocates  for  financial  customers  are \n\naffiliated with either the government or the industry.  \n\n58.  Examples  of  financial  education  delivery  channels  can  be  found  at  the  International  Gateway  for  Financial \nEducation (www.financial-education.org), a program developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development. \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nWith  regard  to  effective  anti\u2013money  laundering  (AML)  and  combating  the  financing  of \nterrorism (CFT) regimes, although successful policy reforms (for example, in Kenya) are not \nyet  formally  compliant  with  the  Financial  Action  Task  Force  (FATF)  guidelines,  regulators \nhave  adopted  alternative  mechanisms  to  ensure  minimum  compliance  with  AML-CFT \napproaches to client identification and verification. In the Philippines, regulators have played \nan  active  role  in  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  mobile  payments  and  have  shown \nstrong  commitment  to  implementing  an  AFL-CFT  regime  that  allows  financial  inclusion. 59 \nHowever,  particularly  in  the  light  of  rapid  adoption  of  technological  innovation,  developing \ncountry policymakers and regulators increasingly report barriers to financial inclusion due to \nincreasing identification burdens.60\n\n \n\n5.7  Assessment \n\nDeveloping  country  policymakers  are  faced  with  the  challenge  of  managing  trade-offs \nbetween  the  objective  of  financial  inclusion  and  other  objectives,  such  as  financial  stability \nand  consumer  protection.  The  policy  solutions  outlined  and  illustrated  above  have  been \nsuccessfully  implemented  in  this  respect.  To  summarize,  outstanding  success  stories \ninclude:  \n\n\u2014Brazil, where new regulations have achieved universal access in only four years by \nenabling partnerships between banks and third-party agents;  \n\n\u2014Kenya and the Philippines, where central banks have had a key role in supporting \nmobile phone payment schemes and left regulatory space to mobile phone operators; \n\n\u2014Bolivia  and  Uganda,  which  have  demonstrated  that  microdeposit-taking  can \nflourish in the regulated financial system with timely and appropriate policies; and \n\n\u2014Indonesia, which has proved how publicly owned financial institutions may become \nthe driving force behind economic development in rural areas. \n\nOverall,  the  available  evidence  suggests  that  a  balance  between  financial  stability  and \nfinancial inclusion objectives can be achieved. None of the recent policy reforms promoting \nfinancial  inclusion  has failed  in  the  sense that  it produced  deficient regulatory,  supervisory, \nor corporate governance practices, or unsound financial performance of market participants. \nTo  the  contrary,  the  policies  discussed  above  have  supported  an  accessible  and  stable \nfinancial sector environment. \n\nThe  above  policy  solutions  should  be  assessed  against  a  widely  accepted  set  of  policy \nprinciples for expanding access to finance. These principles entail: \n\n\u2014promoting entry of and competition among financial firms; \n\n\u2014building legal and information institutions and hard infrastructure; \n\n\u2014stimulating informed demand; \n\n\u2014ensuring the safety and soundness of financial services providers; \n\n\u2014protecting  low-income  and  all  customers  against  abuses  by  financial  services \nproviders; \n\n\u2014ensuring that usury laws, if used, are effective; \n\n\u2014enhancing cross-regulatory agency coordination; \n\n\u2014balancing government\u2019s role with market provision of financial services; \n\n                                                \n59.

TRADE-OFFS AND SYNERGIES BETWEEN FINANCIAL \n\nINCLUSION AND STABILITY \n\nAs it happened during the 1990s with the Tequila Effect (1994) or the Asian financial crisis \n(1997),  the  current  crisis  has  highlighted  the  immense  value  of  financial  stability  and \nmotivated a review of the policy tools available to prevent costly breakdowns of the financial \nsystem. Since financial inclusion has gained a much higher profile as a policy goal in recent \nyears, it is important to inquire to what extent there are trade-offs between the objectives of \nmaintaining systemic stability and including a growing number of users of financial services.  \n\nThis appears even more relevant since the origin of the current crisis in the subprime market \nat  least  initially  suggested  destabilizing  spillovers  from  the  lower  end  of  the  market  to  the \nremainder  of  the  system.  And  of  particular  concern  in  many  developing  countries  is  the \nadditional  regulatory  uncertainty  arising  from  the  rapidly  proliferating,  technology-driven \npolicy  solutions  that  boost  small-scale  transactions  flowing  through  the  national  payment \nsystem.  \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  lessons  learned  suggest  that  past  financial  crises  have  frequently \nbypassed  the  highly  localized  markets  at  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid:  the  microfinance \nsegment  of  BRI  remained  rock  solid  throughout  the  Indonesian  crisis,  and  anecdotal \nevidence  suggests  that  financial  institutions  catering  to  the  lower  end  tend  to  weather \nmacrocrises well and help sustain local economic activity.63  Could it even be possible that a \nmore diversified aggregate financial sector balance sheet, spread over a broader variety of \neconomic agents, might contribute to a more resilient economy that follows a higher growth \npath?  Jean  Claude  Trichet,  president  of  the  European  Central  Bank  seems  to  agree, \ndeclaring  that  financial  stability  is  made  up  of  three  factors:  the  amount  and  quality  of \ninformation  available  to  players,  the  adequacy-inadequacy  of  the  frameworks  for  crisis \nprevention and resolution, and the level of completeness of the market.64\n \n\nThis section aims at identifying links between financial stability and inclusion that could give \nrise  to  either  policy  conflicts  or  synergies,  and  outlines  questions  for  future  research.  To \nfacilitate regulatory decisionmaking, we highlight the potential costs and benefits of financial \ninclusion  with  respect  to  stability  and  stress  the  need  to  differentiate  among  policy  tools \naccording to their risk profiles given the desired outcome. \n\nFinancial stability is a widely accepted public goal because a sound financial system is one \nof the cornerstones for economic growth. However, this goal is substantially harder to define \n                                                \n61.

This does not preclude occasional failures of smaller institutions and \noccasional substantial losses at larger institutions; these \u201care part and parcel of the normal \nfunctioning of the financial system.\u201d65\n \n\nFinancial  inclusion  changes  the  composition  of  the  financial  system  with  regard  to  the \ntransactions that take place, the clients that use the various services, the new risks created, \nand  possibly  the  institutions  that  operate  in  newly  created  or  expanded markets.  Does this \nmix  tend  to  cause  financial  instability  or  make  it  more  likely  by  multiplying  the  sources  of \npotential  shocks,  or  does  it  counter  instability  by  rendering  the  financial  system  more \ndiversified?  Furthermore,  once  a  financial  crisis  has  occurred,  how  effective  is  financial \ninclusion in helping poor households cope with this particular external shock? \n\n6.1  Financial Inclusion: A Potential Cause of Financial Instability?  \n\nAccording to one definition that stresses asymmetric information, financial instability occurs \nwhen  shocks  to  the  system  dramatically  worsen  information  problems  so  that  financial \nintermediation  between  savings  and  productive  investment  opportunities  breaks  down. 66\n  \nAmong  these  shocks,  those  due  to  deteriorating  financial  sector  or  nonfinancial  balance \nsheets appear most closely related to financial inclusion.  \n\nThe exposure of financial institutions to risks from low-income markets depends on the share \nof their revenues that this line  of  business represents.  Specialized  microfinance  institutions \nare  most  prone  to  these  risks,  although  some  large  public  banks  have  developed  a \n67   However,  microfinance  clients  typically \nsignificant  footprint  in  the  low-income  segment.\nhave high repayment rates: when clients have few options in the formal sector, default likely \nimplies much higher future borrowing costs in the informal sector. Hence, as formal options \nproliferate,  credit  bureaus  become  more  important  to  keep  these  incentives  intact.  On  the \nother  hand,  the  regulation  and  risk-based  supervision  of  financial  services  in  low-income \nmarkets appears better understood than in other segments of the market.68\n  \n\nLarge  numbers  of  clients  that  frequently  transact  small  amounts  put  substantial  strain  on \nsupervisory  resources  but  pose  limited  systemic  risk  because  they  represent  such  a  small \nshare  of  overall  financial  sector  assets.  And  as  information  technology  proliferates, \nsupervisory  challenges will  likely  become more manageable.  As  a result,  regulators  are,  in \npractice,  more  concerned  with  issues  of  consumer  protection  raised  by  the  lack  of \nsophistication among low-income clients, and with reputational risks due to the large number \nof clients involved if a particular institution fails. \n\nThis view is confirmed by recent research on a new macroprudential framework that screens \ninstruments,  markets,  and \nInternational \ninstitutions.  The  study,  from \nSettlements,  identifies  two  types  of  externalities  as  the  key  drivers  of  systemic  risk:  joint \nfailures  of  institutions  resulting from their  common  exposures  at a  single  point  in  time,  and \nprocyclicality,  the  fact  that  the  dynamics  of  the  financial  system  and  of  the  real  economy \nreinforce each other, increasing the amplitude of booms and busts and undermining stability \nin both the financial sector and the real economy. 69\n  In addition, the research shows that the \n                                                \n65.

In addition, vast unmet demand makes bubbles less \nlikely to develop on a larger scale. \n\nIn  sum,  financial  inclusion  introduces  new  lines  of  business  with  idiosyncratic  risk  profiles \nthat can be appropriately regulated and supervised. The contribution to systemic risk is likely \nto  be  rather  low,  especially  relative  to  consumer  protection  and  reputational  risk \nconsiderations. Especially with respect to technology-based financial inclusion policies, such \nas mobile phone banking, regulatory concerns have focused on financial integrity rather than \nstability  through  FATF  policy  frameworks  to  combat  money  laundering  and  terrorist \nfinancing.  \n\nThe  implementation  of  FATF  standards  requires  a  risk-based  approach  similar  to  that \nrequired  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  institutions  serving  low-income  clients.  It  has  a \ndirect impact on financial inclusion because customer due diligence through restrictive know-\nyour-customer  rules  may  limit  outreach  potential.  National  regulations  risk  either  excluding \npeople  who  lack  certain  proofs  of  identity  or  imposing  prohibitive  cost  of  compliance  on \nfinancial institutions.73\n\n \n\n6.2  Financial Inclusion: Cushioning Crisis Impact at the Local \n\nLevel?  \n\nAn oft-cited feature of past crises, especially the Asian financial crisis, has been the stability \nand  growth  of  financial  institutions  catering  to  the  poor  amid  the  turmoil  that  toppled \ninternationally  exposed  corporate  lenders.  As  a  result,  local  economic  activities  could \ncontinue, at least to some extent, or recover more quickly.  \n\nMicrofinance institutions that do not mobilize deposits tend to be harder hit when a systemic \ncrisis  triggers  a  credit  crunch,  so  that  funds  for  on-lending  to  low-income  clients  are  no \nlonger  forthcoming  because  existing  credit  lines  cannot  be  rolled  over.  This  has  also  been \nobserved  during  the  current  crisis  (CGAP  2009a).  The  transmission  of  a  higher-level  crisis \nthrough  this  credit  channel  can  have  a  severe  consequences  for  the  local  economy  that \notherwise might be more isolated from national or even international shocks. \n\nIt remains an empirical question to confirm beyond anecdotal evidence how important local \nfinancial  intermediation  is  as  a  transmission  mechanism  for  (or  protection  against)  an \n                                                \n70.

Similarly, household use of savings for risk management during a crisis \nshould be better researched to explore the stability of the local financial system. \n\n7.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: HOW \n\nFINANCIAL INCLUSION EQUIPS THE POOR TO COPE \nWITH INSTABILITY \n\nThe  global  economic  crisis,  despite  its  roots  in  financial  sectors  of  industrial  countries,  will \nlikely  shift  the focus  of future financial  inclusion policies. The fundamental  rethinking  of the \nrole of government in finance triggered by the crisis has built huge momentum for regulatory \nchange.  Policymakers  should  seize  the  current  reform  drive  to  advance  financial  inclusion \npolicies that foster economic resilience. \n\nPostcrisis  opportunities  to  promote  financial  inclusion  hinge  on  the  careful  analysis  of  the \nrisks posed by the transactions of the poor. In the absence of such analysis, the heightened \nrisk  perception  could  usher  in  an  indiscriminate  restriction  of  innovation.  In  formulating \nfinancial inclusion policies, policymakers should leverage successful innovations developed \nby their peers that realized the benefits of financial inclusion in safe ways.  \n\nPeer-to-peer  exchange  among  developing  countries,  as  facilitated  by  the  Alliance  for \nFinancial  Inclusion\u2014a  global  network  of  policymakers  in  developing  countries\u2014will  help \nrefine  and  spread  these  insights  widely,  enabling  other  countries  to  adapt  and  scale  up \nsuccessful innovations.  \n\nMost important, the crisis calls for a shift from credit to savings. Access to savings should be \na top priority because it promises three important benefits: \n\n\u2014enhanced  household  capacity  to  manage  the  vulnerabilities  exposed  by  the \ndevastating impact of the crisis,  \n\n\u2014diversified  funding  base  of  financial  institutions  to  cushion  the  impact  of  a  global \ncredit crunch on domestic financial intermediation, and  \n\n\u2014deeper financial systems that enhance economic resilience by accelerating growth, \nfacilitating diversification, and reducing poverty.  \n\nThe 2.5 billion unbanked adults are especially vulnerable to economic shocks because they \nare confined to the inferior risk management features of informal finance. Low-income clients \nthat can build assets before a crash have somewhere to run for cover. \n\nResearch  has  revealed  substantial  pent-up  demand  for  formal  savings  that  help  overcome \nthe costly credit barriers to business expansion. As a result, income and expenditures grow, \nand  health  outcomes  prove  more  resilient  to turmoil.  Better  household  capacity  to  manage \nrisks  frees  up  public  expenditure  during  times  of  crisis.  Financial  inclusion  also  has  been \nshown  to  reduce  income  inequality.  Stronger  social  cohesion  helps  prevent  political \ninstability  and  permits  undivided  attention  to  crisis  management.  Social  safety  nets  can \nsimultaneously  boost  financial  inclusion  when  benefits  are  delivered  through  basic  bank \naccounts in the formal financial sector. With the subprime meltdown illustrating the dangers \nof  reckless  lending  practices,  consumer  protection  has  surfaced  on  the  policy  agenda. \nFinancial education initiatives have been gaining momentum recently; policymakers now see \na  stronger  rationale  to  build  financial  education  into  high  school  and  college  curricula,  and \nseek greater participation from the private sector in this endeavor. \n\nHowever, further research is needed, especially in the following fields: \n\n\u2014Key  barriers  to  access:  at  the  strategic  level,  systematic  diagnostic  efforts  to \nidentify  \u201cbinding  constraints\u201d  to  financial  access  will  help  policymakers  set  priorities \nfor action.  \n\n24 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\n\u2014Randomized  controlled  trials  (RCT):  more  effective  incorporation  of  RCT  into \nregulatory  decisionmaking  will  allow  for  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  impacts  of \nspecific  products  or  services,  and  should  be  used  more  systematically  to  obtain \ninsights into the appropriate sequencing of reforms.  \n\n\u2014Data and evidence: updated information on levels and trends of financial inclusion \nis  a  critical  step  toward  evidence-based  policy  decisions.  Data  collection  must  be \ntailored \nto  objectives  and  available  resources.  Policymakers  should  expand \ncollaboration with local researchers to build capacity for the collection of demand-side \ndata. \n\n\u2014Risk: greater risk analysis of the scaling-up of technology-based financial inclusion \npolicies  with  respect  to  financial  stability  is  necessary  to  fill  critical  knowledge  gaps \ndue to rapid recent innovation. \n\nOverall,  a  combination  of  showcasing  of  viable  business  models  at  the  bottom  of  the \npyramid,  technological  innovation  that  lowers  transaction  costs,  and  rapid  growth  and \nprogress  in  poverty  alleviation  over  the  past  years  has  helped  to  attract  substantial  private \nsector  investment  and  pushed  the  access  frontier  outwards.  Policymakers  have  facilitated \nstrong  results  by  adapting  regulatory  frameworks  to  financial  innovation  in  the  low-income \nmarket  segment,  and  have  been  able  to  do  so  without  falling  short  of  their  policy  goals  of \nfinancial  stability  or  customer  protection.  With  these  recommendations  in  mind,  there  is \npotential to make the necessary gains in expanding financial access without compromising \nfinancial  stability.  The  current  crisis  thus  offers  a  unique  opportunity  for  policymakers  to \nadvance financial inclusion policies that promote economic resilience. \n\n25 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 259 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nHannig and Jansen \n\nAguirre, Ernesto, Denise Dias, and Klaus Prochaska. 2008. \u201cDiagnostic Report on the Legal \n\nand Regulatory Environment for Branchless Banking in Colombia.\u201d Washington: \nCGAP.  \n\nAPEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Business Advisory Council. 2008. \n\n\u201cCommercially Sustainable Microfinance: A Strategy for Promoting Financial \nInclusion in APEC.\u201d Report of a workshop jointly organized by the Advisory Group on \nAPEC Financial System Capacity Building and the APEC Business Advisory Council. \nJakarta. \n\nBanco do Nordeste do Brasil. 2010. \u201cBackground\u201d \n\n(www.bnb.gov.br/Content/aplicacao/O_Banco/Historico_eng/gerados/hist_principal.a\nsp). \n\nBanerjee, Abhijeet, and others. 2009. \u201cThe Miracle of Microfinance?

International standard setters\u2019 and national regulators\u2019 response has been a global \nconcerted  effort  to  overhaul  and  tighten  financial  regulations.  However,  at  a  time  of \ndesigning stricter regulations, it is crucial to avoid a backlash against financial inclusion. \n", "In  this  chapter,  we  argue  that greater financial  inclusion  presents  opportunities  to  enhance \nfinancial stability. Our arguments are based on the following insights: \n", "\u2014Financial  inclusion  poses  risks  at  the  institutional  level,  but  these  are  hardly  systemic  in \nnature.  Evidence  suggests  that  low-income  savers  and  borrowers  tend  to  maintain  solid \nfinancial  behavior  throughout  financial  crises,  keeping  deposits  in  a  safe  place  and  paying \nback their loans. \n", "\u2014Institutional  risk  profiles  at  the  bottom  end  of  the  financial  market  are  characterized  by \nlarge  numbers  of  vulnerable  clients  who  own  limited  balances  and transact  small  volumes. \nAlthough  this  profile  may  raise  some  concerns  regarding  reputational  risks  for  the  central \nbank  and  consumer  protection,  in  terms  of  financial  instability,  the  risk  posed  by  inclusive \npolicies is negligible. \n", "\u2014In addition, risks prevalent at the institutional level are manageable with known prudential \ntools and more effective customer protection. \n", "\u2014The  potential  costs  of  financial  inclusion  are  compensated  for  by  important  dynamic \nbenefits  that  enhance  financial  stability  over  time  through  a  deeper  and  more  diversified \nfinancial system. \n", "In the following  pages, we  present the  current  state  of financial  inclusion globally. We  also \nexplore some trends in financial inclusion and what the most effective policies are to favor it. \nIn  doing  so,  we  suggest  that  innovations  aimed  at  countering  financial  exclusion  may  help \nstrengthen financial systems rather than weakening them. \n", " \nJEL Classification: E44, G15, G18, G20, G21, G28 \n", " \n"]}
