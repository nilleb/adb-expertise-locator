International standard setters\u2019 and national regulators\u2019 response has been a global \nconcerted  effort  to  overhaul  and  tighten  financial  regulations.  However,  at  a  time  of \ndesigning stricter regulations, it is crucial to avoid a backlash against financial inclusion. \nIn this chapter, we argue that greater financial inclusion presents opportunities to enhance \nfinancial stability. Our arguments are based on the following insights: \n\u2014Financial inclusion poses risks at the institutional level, but these are hardly systemic in \nnature. Evidence suggests that low-income savers and borrowers tend to maintain solid \nfinancial behavior throughout financial crises, keeping deposits in a safe place and paying \nback their loans. \n\u2014Institutional risk profiles at the bottom end of the financial market are characterized by \nlarge numbers of vulnerable clients who own limited balances and transact small volumes. \nAlthough this profile may raise some concerns regarding reputational risks for the central \nbank and consumer protection, in terms of financial instability, the risk posed by inclusive \npolicies is negligible. \n\u2014In addition, risks prevalent at the institutional level are manageable with known prudential \ntools and more effective customer protection. \n\u2014The  potential  costs  of  financial  inclusion  are  compensated  for  by  important  dynamic \nbenefits that enhance financial stability over time through a deeper and more diversified \nfinancial system. \nIn the following pages, we present the current state of financial inclusion globally. We also \nexplore some trends in financial inclusion and what the most effective policies are to favor it. \nIn doing so, we suggest that innovations aimed at countering financial exclusion may help \nstrengthen financial systems rather than weakening them. \n \nJEL Classification: E44, G15, G18, G20, G21, G28 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 259    Hannig and Jansen \n \nContents \n1.

WHAT IS FINANCIAL INCLUSION?  \nFinancial  inclusion  aims  at  drawing  the  \u201cunbanked\u201d  population  into  the  formal  financial \nsystem so that they have the opportunity to access financial services ranging from savings, \npayments, and transfers to credit and insurance. Financial inclusion neither implies that \neverybody should make use of the supply, nor that providers should disregard risks and \nother costs when deciding to offer services. Both voluntary exclusion and unfavorable risk-\nreturn  characteristics  may  preclude  a  household  or  a  small  firm,  despite  unrestrained \naccess, from using one or more of the services. Such outcomes do not necessarily warrant \npolicy intervention. Rather, policy initiatives should aim to correct market failures and to \neliminate nonmarket barriers to accessing a broad range of financial services.1  \nDespite the considerable progress made by microfinance institutions, credit unions, and \nsavings cooperatives over the last two decades, the majority of the world\u2019s poor remain \nunserved by formal financial intermediaries that can safely manage cash and intermediate \nbetween net savers and net borrowers. According to the Consultative Group to Assist the \nPoor (CGAP), the absolute number of savings accounts worldwide is reported to exceed the \nglobal population.2  And yet half of the world\u2019s adult population\u20142.5 billion people\u2014does \nnot, in fact, have access to savings accounts and other formal financial services.3 \nFinancial inclusion as a policy objective represents the current consensus in a long-standing \ndebate on the contribution of finance to economic development and poverty reduction (see \nBox 1). It reflects the evolution of financial sector policies in developing countries over the \npast  decades,  and  embodies  important  insights  into  the  positive  impact  that  financial \nservices have on the (economic) lives of the poor.4  Financial sector policies have evolved \nthrough three stylized stages: first, fostering state-led industrial and agricultural development \nthrough  directed  credit;  second,  market-led  development  through  liberalization  and \nderegulation; and third, institution building that aims at balancing market and government \nfailures.  \n \nBox 1. Financial Development versus Inclusion \n \nConventional measures of financial development reflect traditional policy \nobjectives.  The  focus  on  aggregate  capital  accumulation  resulted  in \n  \u201cdomestic credit to the private sector\u201d (as a percent of GDP) being the \nmost prominent measure of the \u201cdepth\u201d of financial development. Its \n  impact on growth is well established, but it is poorly correlated with \n\u201cbreadth\u201d or financial access. Hence financial deepening and financial \naccess are only weak substitutes as policy goals. Growing evidence of \n \nlinks from inclusion to equity, growth, and poverty alleviation have turned \ninclusion into a stand-alone policy objective. \n \n \nAt least until the 1980s, many developing countries channeled public funds to target groups \nlike farmers and small enterprises, and regulated the scope of activities for which these \nfunds could be used. These \u201cdirected credit\u201d programs assumed that the rural poor were \nunable to save or to afford market rates of interest, and therefore need loans at subsidized \nrates to build capital. Hence development banks lent at below-market rates to selected target \ngroups.  To  fund  cheap  loans,  deposit  rates  were  often  subject  to  regulatory  ceilings, \n                                                \n1 . Demirgu\u00e7-Kunt, Beck, and Honohan (2008). \n2.

The  results  of  \u201cfinancial  repression\u201d  were \ntypically  shallow  financial  systems  and  institutions  that  had  little  capacity  to  allocate \nresources  efficiently  according  to  risk-return  characteristics.  In  addition,  poor  targeting \nyielded  transfers  through  highly  repressive  subsidized  interest  rates,  and  subsidies \nweakened financial institution performance. Not only did these programs typically prove to \nbe unsustainable, they also did not improve outreach of financial services to the poor, \nparticularly in rural areas. \nAt the end of the 1980s, a new approach emerged that focused on the performance of \nfinancial institutions in delivering their services to segments of the population with little or no \naccess to finance. The changes were substantial: the new approach shifted the discussion \naway  from  individual  firms  and  households  onto  institutions  and their  ability  to  provide \nservices  on  a  sustainable  and  widespread  basis.  Initial  experiences  in  Indonesia, \nBangladesh, Bolivia, and some other countries demonstrated that microfinance and rural \nfinance conceived as \u201cbanking with the poor\u201d are indeed financially viable and may thus \nincrease outreach on a sustainable basis. These encouraging examples led to a new view \ncalled the \u201cfinancial system\u201d paradigm.5  The underlying assumptions of this approach were \nthat poor people can generate an economic surplus, which enables them to repay the real \ncosts of loans and to save. The term microfinance came to replace \u201cmicrocredit,\u201d the former \nbeing used increasingly to refer to a variety of financial products such as loans, deposits, \ninsurance, payments, and remittances offered by a variety of regulated and unregulated \nfinancial institutions.  \nOver the past few years, microfinance has undergone a rapid transformation as its links to \nthe  formal  financial  system  have  been  expanded.  Growing  theoretical  and  empirical \nevidence suggests that financial systems that serve low-income people promote pro-poor \ngrowth. 6 Lack  of  access  to  finance,  therefore,  adversely  affects  growth  and  poverty \nalleviation. It makes it more difficult for the poor to accumulate savings and build assets to \nprotect against risks, as well as to invest in income-generating projects. As a result, the \ninterest  in  financial  sector  development  has  increasingly  focused  on  the  factors  that \ndetermine not only the depth but also breadth of access, in a move toward inclusive financial \nsystems. \nWith this increased attention to the poverty alleviation aspects of finance, policy objectives \nare being constantly expanded to include more quality access to a wider range of financial \nservices.7 This  trend  has  been  facilitated  by  the  development  and  rapid  diffusion  of \ninformation and communication technology that dramatically reduces the cost of connecting \nusers to formal financial institutions through payment systems, with potential spillovers into a \nbroader range of services.8  \nAgainst this background, financial services to the unbanked have become a major area of \ninterest for policymakers, practitioners, and academics who increasingly emphasize financial \ninclusion as a policy objective. The notion of building inclusive financial systems recognizes \nnot only the goal of incorporating as many poor and previously excluded people as possible \ninto the formal financial system, but it also assigns to mainstream financial institutions the \nrole of reaching out to the unbanked.9  From this perspective, microfinance is now seen as \nan integral part of an inclusive financial system. As a result, financial inclusion has become \nan important policy goal that complements the traditional pillars of monetary and financial \nstability, as well as other regulatory objectives such as consumer protection.  Policies to \nencourage  increased  access  for  the  previously  unbanked  must,  however,  take  into \n                                                \n5.  Otero and Rhyne (1994). \n6.

Today,  it  is \nunderstood that  poor  households  rely  on  a  variety  of financial  instruments  in the  daily \nmanagement of their cash flows and risks, and in their endeavors to build assets through \nsaving. Tools such as financial diaries show that the key challenge faced by these low-\nincome households is the irregularity of their cash flows.11 The average income at the \ninternational poverty line of $2 a day translates in practice into a highly variable flow that \nrequires active management to smooth consumption and reduce vulnerability to various \nshocks, such as health risks, as well as to cope with major life cycle events.12 \n2.  HOW TO MEASURE PROGRESS?  \nReliable and comprehensive data that capture various dimensions of financial inclusion are a \ncritical condition for evidence-based policymaking.13 That includes the definition of consistent \nfinancial inclusion indicators that not only may set a clear direction for policymaking by \ntranslating  the  concept  of  financial  inclusion  into  operational  terms  but  also  may  allow \ntracking progress and measuring outcomes of policy reforms. \nThis presents several challenges, though. Thus the definition of financial indicators has \ntraditionally been shaped by previously formulated policy objectives. On other occasions, \nsome indicators may introduce important distortions into the analysis prior to policymaking \ndiscussions by prioritizing aggregate volumes over numbers and characteristics of clients. \nBroadly speaking, financial inclusion can be measured through the following lenses in order \nof complexity:  \n\u2014Access: the ability to use available financial services and products from formal \ninstitutions. Understanding levels of access may require insight into and analysis of \npotential barriers to opening and using a bank account for any purpose, such as \ncost and physical proximity of bank service points (for example, branches and \nATMs). A very basic proxy for access can be derived by counting the number of \nopen accounts across financial institutions and estimating the proportion of the \npopulation with an account.    \n\u2014Quality: the relevance of the financial service or product to the lifestyle needs of \nthe consumer. Quality encompasses the experience of the consumer, demonstrated \nin attitudes and opinions toward those products that are currently available to them.  \nThe measure of quality therefore would be used to gauge the nature and depth of \nthe relationship between the financial service provider and the consumer as well as \nthe choices available and consumers\u2019 levels of understanding of those choices and \ntheir implications.  \n\u2014Usage: beyond the basic adoption of banking services, usage focuses more on \nthe permanence and depth of financial service and product use. Hence determining \n                                                \n10.

To measure usage, it is critical that information reflect the user\u2019s point of \nview, that is, data gathered through a demand-side survey.      \n\u2014Impact: measuring changes in the lives of consumers that can be attributed to the \nusage of a financial device or service poses serious methodological challenges to \nsurvey design. \nThis information can be sourced either from the demand side, that is, at the individual, \nhousehold, or firm level, or from the supply side, that is, at the level of a financial institution, \nor from a combination of both. The key surveys that have produced relevant data have been \ncompiled by CGAP.14 \nWith all these elements in mind, it can be stated that measurement of financial inclusion \nserves  two  primary  objectives  that  imply  different  data  needs:  first,  measuring  and \nmonitoring levels of financial inclusion, and second, deepening understanding about factors \nthat correlate with financial inclusion and, subsequently, the impact of policies.   \nThese primary objectives can be broken down to more basic levels (Figure 1). Measurement \ndata can be used to approximate the number of people who have access to or are currently \nusing some type of financial service or product. Provided these data can be linked to other \nin-country factors, such as population characteristics, they can also help identify priorities \nand catalyze changes in policy and approach. If collected repeatedly, these data can also be \nused  to  monitor  progress  over  time.    On  the  other  hand,  data  can  also  deepen \nunderstanding of the problem of financial inclusion. This is typically entails a more complex \nmethod of design and collection. This type of data is more appropriate to support solution \nbuilding and impact measurement of policies put in place. \nFigure 1: Measurement Objectives \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Porteous (2009). \n3.  FINANCIAL INCLUSION TRENDS  \nThere has been significant but uneven progress toward financial inclusion around the world \nin recent years. Some of these steps have been driven by market-friendly policies that will be \npresented in more detail in a later section.  \n                                                \n14.

Also, India\u2019s poor have little access to deposits: \u201cno frills\u201d \naccounts have increased to over 28 million, but studies show that many of these are barely \nused.  \nParticularly in Asia, the poor are often served by public banks or nonbank entities, including \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), with private sector banks playing a smaller role. \nKey examples of these public banks and nonbank entities include:  \n\u2014Pakistan:  Post Savings Bank, with 3.6 million accounts in 2006. \n\u2014India:  post offices, with 60.8 million savings accounts as of March 2007. \n\u2014Bangladesh: Rural Development Board, with 4.7 million active borrowers in 2007. \n\u2014Viet Nam:  Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, with 10 million farmer \nclients in 2007, and Bank for Social Policy, with 6.79 million active borrowers in 2008.  \n\u2014Thailand: Government Savings Bank, with 36 million accounts in 2006.  \n\u2014Sri Lanka: state banks, which were used by 72 percent households by the end of \n2006. \nHowever, despite this outreach, service quality is inferior, and most institutions depend on \nsubsidies.  Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2, despite remarkable improvements in India \nand Bangladesh, an estimated 535 million people in these two countries still are excluded \nfrom financial services.

This  new  low-cost  delivery  channel  triggered  a  massive \nexpansion of formal financial services to 12 million clients in only six years. Other countries, \nsuch as Colombia and Peru, are replicating this model.  \nLatin  America  has  also  demonstrated  the  potential  of  conditional  cash  transfers  into \nsimplified  bank  accounts  as  a  way  to  connect  beneficiaries  to  formal  finance  while \nsimultaneously lowering delivery costs to the government.

THE RELATION BETWEEN POVERTY AND FINANCIAL \nINCLUSION: RECENT EVIDENCE  \nAs mentioned previously, collecting reliable financial data is not an easy task. A common \nobstacle  is  that  both  current  levels  and  recent  progress  in  financial  inclusion  vary \nsubstantially across countries. Most countries are only beginning to track financial inclusion, \nso data for projecting longer-term trends are not yet available.  In addition, comparing survey \nresults across countries is often difficult because methodologies used often differ from one \nsurvey to the next. \nCGAP\u2019s Financial Access 2009, a global survey of regulators with regard to financial access, \nfocuses on individual account holdings with regulated institutions. Using a statistical model to \nfill in data gaps, the survey finds 6.2 billion bank deposit accounts globally. Because of the \naforementioned challenges faced by survey collectors, this number may include substantial \ndouble counting of users, which may therefore mask a rather uneven distribution. Assuming \nthree bank accounts per banked adult, the CGAP survey arrives at an estimate of 2.6 billion \nunbanked adults in the developing world.22  \nAnother recent survey is the World Bank\u2019s composite access indicator.23  It suggests that \nfinancial inclusion is an issue well beyond households living on less than $2 a day (see \nFigure 4).  Instead, it shows how in many countries, the number of financially excluded \nadults significantly exceeds the adult population living under the $2-a-day poverty line.24 \n                                                \n22.

Consistent with the evolution of policy objectives, the research focus has \nbeen first on macroeconomic aspects of financial system development; only in recent years \nhas it begun to address the microeconomic impacts of financial inclusion. \n4.1  Macroeconomic Evidence  \nFinancial institutions contribute to growth by reducing information asymmetries that would \notherwise hinder the efficient intermediation of resources among savers and investors. There \nis substantial evidence that financial development has a causal impact on growth.26  A \nprominent  explanation  is  Schumpeter\u2019s  view  that finance fuels \u201ccreative  destruction\u201d  by \nallocating  resources  to  newcomers  that  promote  innovation  and  possibly  topple \nincumbents.27 Along these lines, access to finance for new entrepreneurs is an important \ningredient in the finance-growth nexus.28  \n                                                \n26.

Beck \nand others (2008) found a link between financial development, reduced income inequality, \nand poverty alleviation:  the aggregate usage of financial services, that is, deeper financial \nsystems, appears to reduce Gini coefficients, a measurement of inequality.    \nThere is also evidence at the macroeconomic level that broader financial systems enhance \neconomic growth. Gin\u00e9 and Townsend (2004) show that, based on a general equilibrium \nmodel of the Thai economy, the expansion of access to the financial sector has significantly \nraised  Thailand\u2019s  growth  rate.  Conversely,  Banerjee  and  others  (2009)  emphasize  the \nefficiency and productivity losses associated with preferential access to finance by the better \noff, and suggest a potential first-order effect of access on investment and growth. \nFinally, Pande and Burgess (2005) find a strong positive effect on rural poverty, using a \n\u201cnatural experiment\u201d of new branching regulations in India that incentivized banks to expand \ninto underserved areas. However, the high cost of this expansion policy outweighed the \naggregate benefits. This result suggests large potential benefits from technology-enabled, \nlower-cost branch expansion. \n4.2  Microeconomic Evidence  \nUntil very recently, the support for financial inclusion from a microeconomic level has been \nsolely based on plausibility, anecdotal evidence, and data that were not subject to statistical \ntests, such as claims that 65 percent of Grameen Bank clients cross the poverty line.29  \nEstablishing a causal link from the use of financial services to improvements in the lives of \nthe  poor  is  methodologically  challenging  and  very  expensive.  It  requires  eliminating \ninfluences  of  self-selection  and  survivor  biases  in  the  sample,  as  well  as  numerous \nunobservable  effects  that  may  confound  the  analysis.  The  method  of  choice  is  field \nexperiments that establish this link through the creation of a counterfactual by randomly \ndividing a subset of the population into treatment and control groups. Statistical analysis is \nthen used to identify the differential effects of the intervention, such as exposure to a certain \ntype of financial service.  \nThese randomized controlled trials (RCT) are critical to underpin the claim that financial \ninclusion positively affects the poor. RCTs are not without shortcomings, however: while \nmethodological rigor produces results with high levels of internal validity, it is much more \ndifficult to generalize beyond the specific context of the experiment, that is, external validity \nis substantially weaker.30 \nA number of RCTs have been conducted so far.  In Kenya, a randomly selected group of \nrural poor were offered savings accounts. The impact was found to be highly positive: uptake \nwas very significant for female clients, and female market vendors reached higher daily \nexpenditure levels within six months of opening an account.31 There was no evidence that \nsavings accounts crowd out other investments, and neither was there evidence that the \nsavings  accounts  allowed  for  more  efficient  smoothing  over  bad  shocks,  particularly \nsickness. This study also shows a more significant positive impact of savings accounts for \nwomen than for men.  \nAnother RCT example from India provides evidence that the effect of microcredit depends \non household characteristics:  \n\u2014Business owners use credit to expand their businesses, as demonstrated by an \nincrease in spending on durables and an increase in business profits.  \n                                                \n29.

However, business outcomes were significantly positive, \nincluding the creation of new businesses and the profits for existing business. While the \nimpact on female welfare could not be established (despite frequent claims to the contrary), \none has to take into account the limited time horizon. \nRecent  research  in  South  Africa  highlights  the  risk  management  benefits  of  financial \ninclusion. 33 Loan applicants that had been declined \u201cat the margin\u201d were randomly offered \nloans and turned out to be significantly less likely to report leaving a job after entering the \nexperiment than those rejected clients without loans. Treated households earned more and \nwere more likely to move out of poverty. Overall, increased access to credit appears to \nimprove welfare.  The study does present evidence that short-term loans are an important \ncash flow management tool and that they have largely positive impacts on people\u2019s welfare, \nparticularly in the area of employment and income. The study also found that loans to \ncustomers at (or slightly beyond) the margin were actually profitable. \nGiven the difficulty with drawing generalized conclusions from RCTs, new tools will be \nneeded  to  deepen  understanding  about  which  services  matter  most  to  low-income \nhouseholds and microenterprises, how they impact welfare metrics, and how policy tools can \nhelp relax binding constraints on the access frontier. \nIn conclusion, recent evaluation techniques suggest that positive effects of microfinance \nexist,  but  they  may  be  not  as  overwhelming  as  assumed  or  may  take  more  time  to \nmaterialize.

FINANCIAL INCLUSION POLICIES: RECENT \nINNOVATION \nThe financial sector is prone to market failure and, therefore, is generally heavily regulated. \nThe low-income segment is particularly plagued by information asymmetries as participants \non the demand side often lack a track record or collateral to pacify lenders\u2019 concerns. In \naddition, lenders lack experience in new markets at the bottom of the pyramid and face \nadjustment costs regarding business processes. At the same time, the limited size of both \nindividual transactions and the overall market pose challenges to suppliers that need to \nrecover fixed costs.  \nHowever, once the pioneers of the microfinance revolution demonstrated tangible market \nopportunities, substantial business model innovation has expanded the \u201caccess possibilities \nfrontier.\u201d34  More recently, technological innovation has dramatically lowered the fixed costs \nof reaching the low-income segment and attracted a broader range of new suppliers.  \nPolicies are a key complement to private sector innovation through regulatory frameworks, \npublic ownership, the provision of market infrastructure, and measures that lower demand-\nside barriers. Regulatory frameworks determine the set of institutions that are allowed to \nenter, shape the scope of available services, and affect institutions\u2019 cost of doing business. \n                                                \n32.

Secured lending frameworks and \npublic credit registries facilitate transactions despite asymmetric information. Finally, the low \neducation  level  of  poor  clients  suggests  a  need  for  consumer  protection  and  financial \neducation policies.  \nPolicymakers have struggled to accompany rapid innovation. They have been particularly \nsuccessful where they facilitated experimentation within regulatory frameworks that carefully \nlimited  the  potential  risks.  In  some  cases,  policymakers  have  even  taken  the  lead  in \nintroducing new solutions to the market through regulatory or legislative measures or direct \nparticipation in the market. \nThe rapid pace of innovation has substantially increased the complexity of policymaking. On \nthe  one  hand,  this  calls  for  a  rethinking  of  policy  principles  with  respect  to  financial \ninclusion.35 On the other hand, there is substantial scope for stepping up peer-to-peer advice \nas innovative solutions are being generated by developing country regulators.  \nTo  capture  and  compare  emerging  policy  trends  in  developing  countries,  the  German \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  or  GTZ  (German  Technical  Cooperation) \nassessed thirty-five policy solutions geared toward promoting financial inclusion across ten \ncountries.36   Six  solutions  were  found  to  be  particularly  effective.  Four  have  improved \nconditions for reaching the poor through various channels, including agent banking, mobile \npayments, diversification of providers, and state bank reforms. The remaining two solutions \nare consumer protection and financial identity policies, which play key roles in enabling \nfinancial inclusion. \n5.1  Agent Banking \nPolicies that enable banks to contract with nonbank retail agents as outlets for financial \nservices  have  proven  highly  successful  in  advancing  financial  inclusion  where  bank \nbranches are not economically viable. Such policies leverage existing retail infrastructure as \ndelivery channels, and turn pharmacies, post offices, or supermarkets not only into agents of \nbanks but agents of financial inclusion. \nCollaboration among banks and agents has become possible as technology has reduced the \ncosts and risks of the remote exchange of information to carry out financial transactions. \nCoupled  with  simplified  account  opening  procedures  and  other  incentives  to  use  this \nchannel, such as the delivery of cash transfers, financial system outreach and numbers of \nusers can increase explosively, as recently observed in Brazil. \nBrazil was the early leader in agent banking through the large-scale introduction of \u201cbanking \ncorrespondents\u201d to distribute welfare grants to unbanked Brazilians. This solution addressed \na key physical access barrier: only 1,600 municipalities had bank branches in 2000.37 Today, \nsome 95,000 correspondents cover all of the 5,500 municipalities, and nearly 12 million \naccounts were opened at agents over three years. The Brazilian success has inspired \nsimilar approaches in Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Chile.38  In 2006 Colombia passed \n                                                \n35.

With a huge percentage of population concentrated in large cities, the minority living \nin  remote  rural  areas  do  not  receive  enough  attention  in  terms  of  infrastructure, \ncommunications development, and services. This is particularly evident in countries like \nBrazil or Peru, where these minorities account for millions of people, affecting equally both \npoor and better-off residents. That is why, as shown in Figure 4, in countries like Brazil, \nRussia,  or  Mexico,  the  population  without  access  to  financial  services  outnumbers  the \npopulation living on less than $2 a day to a greater extent than holds in smaller countries. \nCritical features of the agent banking model are timely transaction settlement to minimize \nfraud, simplified account opening procedures, and customer due diligence compliant with \ninternational know-your-customer standards. The cost savings are substantial: according to \nthe  Peruvian  Superintendence  of  Banks,  forty  banking  agents  may  be  established  for \nroughly the same cost as one bank branch.40 \nThe experience of Brazil offers valuable lessons for countries. A Brazilian agent is a service \nprovider of a bank or other financial institution. Any institution that is supervised by the \ncentral bank can contract an agent, and anyone can become an agent as long as the bank \ntakes the responsibility and the relationship is governed by a public contract. The success of \nthis model is based on its pragmatic and flexible approach. While the oversight is focused on \nthe financial institution, with the central bank getting access to all data on the agent, it also \ngives the financial institution enough freedom to articulate the relationship with the agent on \nits own terms. The Mexican case shows that know-your-customer procedures for smaller \ntransaction authority can also be delegated to agents. \n5.2  Mobile Payments \nGlobally, 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions were projected for 2009, well over half of them \nin the developing world.41  Mobile phone penetration in developing countries has almost \ntripled in the past five years, with Asia in particular showing high growth rates (see Figure 7). \nIn Kenya, for example, 47 percent of adults own a mobile phone, and the rate of ownership \nrises to 73 percent in urban areas and 80 percent in Nairobi.42 \n                                                \n39.

Of this \namount, $458 million were held by the private financial funds, which opened almost 136,000 \nnew savings accounts in the first half of 2008.48  New laws, specially designed for previously \nunregulated NGOs, were passed in 2008.49 The main difference from the preceding model is \nthat NGOs will not need to be transformed into private financial funds. Instead, they will keep \ntheir nonprofit status and be allowed to collect deposits and offer extra financial services. \nNGOs will have the nature of nonbanking financial intermediaries but will be under the same \nrules as banks and financial entities. \nIn Indonesia the entry barriers to the financial sector were lowered by the introduction of \nsecond-tier rural banks during financial sector liberalization in the late 1980s.

They are present in about 73 of 102 countries, where \nthey hold roughly 15 percent of banking assets.51  Public banks often are the only financial \ninstitutions in rural areas with large branch networks, not least because governments have \nused public banks extensively to promote savings and credit in areas of less commercial \ninterest, such as agriculture or housing, and to implement social programs.52  \nThe global picture is rather mixed: some governments have closed down poorly performing \nstate banks as the least-cost choice, as did Benin, Brazil, and Peru, while others continue to \nsuffer  from  political  interference  and  mediocre  performance.  More  interesting,  however, \nsome  policymaker-pushed  reforms  have  demonstrated  the  potential  to  turn  financial \ninclusion into a new, profitable business for state banks.  \nRather than restructuring the whole bank, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) and Banco do \nNordeste in Brazil, for example, created separate lines of business to introduce profitable \nmicrofinance operations. Key success factors were governance reform and state-of-the-art \nmicrocredit technologies.  \nBRI has over 4,200 village units that serve 3.5 million borrowers and 21 million savers.53  \nThe  profit  of  BRI\u2019s  microfinance  operations  (27  percent  of  total  loan  portfolio)  cross-\nsubsidized the less successful banking operations during the Asian crisis.   \nBanco do Nordeste\u2019s \u201cCrediAmigo\u201d has grown rapidly, becoming to be the second largest \nmicrocredit program in Latin America since it was launched in the late 1990s.

Information \nasymmetry between consumers and banks regarding financial products and services puts \nthese new customers at a disadvantage. This imbalance is greatest when customers are \nless experienced and the products are more sophisticated. Progress on financial inclusion \ntherefore carries the risk of producing more inexperienced and vulnerable customers. \nMany financial institutions ensure that these customers are well served, but some have \nabused their information advantage to increase profits at the expense of consumers who \nfound themselves overindebted, underinsured, or without a return on their investment.  This \nwas the case in Bolivia during the early 2000s, where the combination of financial illiteracy, \nunethical practices of some institutions, and some voids in the legal framework resulted in \nabuses. Preventing these situations is critical.   \nConsumer  protection  is  generally  considered  to  be  a  regulatory  response  to  a  market \nfailure. 55 Appropriate  regulation  should  correct  information  imbalance  and  encourage \nsustainable market expansion through timely information disclosure throughout the service \nrelationship\u2014before, during, and after the contract.

Of  the  remaining  4,000 \ncomplaints, two-thirds were referred to the Consumer Protection Commission, and one-third \nwas referred to the financial ombudsman. In addition to oversight by the regulator and \nmultiple channels for redress, Peruvian consumers have access to cost information about \nfinancial services, published daily in newspapers. When this information was first published, \ninterest rates dropped by as much as 15 percent in six months. \n5.6  Financial Identity \nIn most countries, credit information is only provided above a certain loan amount, effectively \nexcluding  poor  customers from the  demonstrated  benefits  of  information  cost  reduction \nprovided  by  credit  registries.  More fundamentally,  such  clients  may  not  even  have  the \nidentification documents required to open a bank account.  \nPolicymakers have begun to address these barriers to access by narrowing the gap between \nthe  documentation  threshold  associated  with  bank  accounts  and  the  quality  of \ndocumentation prevalent among low-income clients. As a result, these policies endow clients \nwith a financial history and transform their transaction history into a financial asset that they \ncan use to leverage access to credit and other banking services. \nIn lowering documentation barriers to entry, regulators must decide on the level of risk they \nwant to accept to promote inclusion.  To reduce credit and identification risks, Indonesia has \nstarted to collect local information in the informal financial sector, especially among the \npooled funds that are popular among the rural poor. This is an opportunity to capture crucial \ninformation on financial identity and financial history. In India stringent know-your-customer \nnorms have been relaxed to allow the creation of low-risk, basic bank accounts with a letter \nfrom the local government. In South Africa, the regulator has allowed industry to lead the \nway in proposing systems to identify their rural clients, as long as providers are able to \nensure the proper assessments, enforcement, and consumer protection. \n                                                \n56. Regulatory capture, whereby regulatory agents come to be dominated by the industry they regulate, is a \nrecognized feature of financial markets.  For an insightful take on regulatory capture, see Kay (2009). \n57.

In the Philippines, regulators have played \nan active role in creating an enabling environment for mobile payments and have shown \nstrong commitment to implementing an AFL-CFT regime that allows financial inclusion.59 \nHowever, particularly in the light of rapid adoption of technological innovation, developing \ncountry policymakers and regulators increasingly report barriers to financial inclusion due to \nincreasing identification burdens.60 \n5.7  Assessment \nDeveloping  country  policymakers  are  faced  with  the  challenge  of  managing  trade-offs \nbetween the objective of financial inclusion and other objectives, such as financial stability \nand consumer protection. The policy solutions outlined and illustrated above have been \nsuccessfully  implemented  in  this  respect.  To  summarize,  outstanding  success  stories \ninclude:  \n\u2014Brazil, where new regulations have achieved universal access in only four years by \nenabling partnerships between banks and third-party agents;  \n\u2014Kenya and the Philippines, where central banks have had a key role in supporting \nmobile phone payment schemes and left regulatory space to mobile phone operators; \n\u2014Bolivia  and  Uganda,  which  have  demonstrated  that  microdeposit-taking  can \nflourish in the regulated financial system with timely and appropriate policies; and \n\u2014Indonesia, which has proved how publicly owned financial institutions may become \nthe driving force behind economic development in rural areas. \nOverall,  the available  evidence  suggests  that a  balance  between financial  stability  and \nfinancial inclusion objectives can be achieved. None of the recent policy reforms promoting \nfinancial inclusion has failed in the sense that it produced deficient regulatory, supervisory, \nor corporate governance practices, or unsound financial performance of market participants. \nTo the contrary, the policies discussed above have supported an accessible and stable \nfinancial sector environment. \nThe above policy solutions should be assessed against a widely accepted set of policy \nprinciples for expanding access to finance. These principles entail: \n\u2014promoting entry of and competition among financial firms; \n\u2014building legal and information institutions and hard infrastructure; \n\u2014stimulating informed demand; \n\u2014ensuring the safety and soundness of financial services providers; \n\u2014protecting  low-income  and  all  customers  against  abuses  by  financial  services \nproviders; \n\u2014ensuring that usury laws, if used, are effective; \n\u2014enhancing cross-regulatory agency coordination; \n\u2014balancing government\u2019s role with market provision of financial services; \n                                                \n59.

TRADE-OFFS AND SYNERGIES BETWEEN FINANCIAL \nINCLUSION AND STABILITY \nAs it happened during the 1990s with the Tequila Effect (1994) or the Asian financial crisis \n(1997),  the  current  crisis  has  highlighted  the  immense  value  of  financial  stability  and \nmotivated a review of the policy tools available to prevent costly breakdowns of the financial \nsystem. Since financial inclusion has gained a much higher profile as a policy goal in recent \nyears, it is important to inquire to what extent there are trade-offs between the objectives of \nmaintaining systemic stability and including a growing number of users of financial services.  \nThis appears even more relevant since the origin of the current crisis in the subprime market \nat least initially suggested destabilizing spillovers from the lower end of the market to the \nremainder of the system. And of particular concern in many developing countries is the \nadditional  regulatory  uncertainty  arising  from  the  rapidly  proliferating,  technology-driven \npolicy solutions that boost small-scale transactions flowing through the national payment \nsystem.  \nOn  the  other  hand,  lessons  learned  suggest  that  past  financial  crises  have  frequently \nbypassed  the  highly  localized  markets  at  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid:  the  microfinance \nsegment  of  BRI  remained  rock  solid  throughout  the  Indonesian  crisis,  and  anecdotal \nevidence  suggests  that  financial  institutions  catering  to  the  lower  end  tend  to  weather \nmacrocrises well and help sustain local economic activity.63  Could it even be possible that a \nmore diversified aggregate financial sector balance sheet, spread over a broader variety of \neconomic agents, might contribute to a more resilient economy that follows a higher growth \npath?  Jean  Claude  Trichet,  president  of  the  European  Central  Bank  seems  to  agree, \ndeclaring that financial stability is made up of three factors: the amount and quality of \ninformation  available  to  players,  the  adequacy-inadequacy  of  the  frameworks  for  crisis \nprevention and resolution, and the level of completeness of the market.64 \nThis section aims at identifying links between financial stability and inclusion that could give \nrise to either policy conflicts or synergies, and outlines questions for future research. To \nfacilitate regulatory decisionmaking, we highlight the potential costs and benefits of financial \ninclusion with respect to stability and stress the need to differentiate among policy tools \naccording to their risk profiles given the desired outcome. \nFinancial stability is a widely accepted public goal because a sound financial system is one \nof the cornerstones for economic growth. However, this goal is substantially harder to define \n                                                \n61.

This does not preclude occasional failures of smaller institutions and \noccasional substantial losses at larger institutions; these \u201care part and parcel of the normal \nfunctioning of the financial system.\u201d65 \nFinancial  inclusion  changes  the  composition  of  the  financial  system  with  regard  to  the \ntransactions that take place, the clients that use the various services, the new risks created, \nand possibly the institutions that operate in newly created or expanded markets. Does this \nmix tend to cause financial instability or make it more likely by multiplying the sources of \npotential  shocks,  or  does  it  counter  instability  by  rendering  the  financial  system  more \ndiversified? Furthermore, once a financial crisis has occurred, how effective is financial \ninclusion in helping poor households cope with this particular external shock? \n6.1  Financial Inclusion: A Potential Cause of Financial Instability?  \nAccording to one definition that stresses asymmetric information, financial instability occurs \nwhen  shocks  to  the  system  dramatically  worsen  information  problems  so  that  financial \nintermediation between savings and productive investment opportunities breaks down.66  \nAmong these shocks, those due to deteriorating financial sector or nonfinancial balance \nsheets appear most closely related to financial inclusion.  \nThe exposure of financial institutions to risks from low-income markets depends on the share \nof their revenues that this line of business represents. Specialized microfinance institutions \nare  most  prone  to  these  risks,  although  some  large  public  banks  have  developed  a \nsignificant footprint in the low-income segment.67  However, microfinance clients typically \nhave high repayment rates: when clients have few options in the formal sector, default likely \nimplies much higher future borrowing costs in the informal sector. Hence, as formal options \nproliferate, credit bureaus become more important to keep these incentives intact. On the \nother hand, the regulation and risk-based supervision of financial services in low-income \nmarkets appears better understood than in other segments of the market.68  \nLarge numbers of clients that frequently transact small amounts put substantial strain on \nsupervisory resources but pose limited systemic risk because they represent such a small \nshare  of  overall  financial  sector  assets.  And  as  information  technology  proliferates, \nsupervisory challenges will likely become more manageable. As a result, regulators are, in \npractice,  more  concerned  with  issues  of  consumer  protection  raised  by  the  lack  of \nsophistication among low-income clients, and with reputational risks due to the large number \nof clients involved if a particular institution fails. \nThis view is confirmed by recent research on a new macroprudential framework that screens \ninstruments,  markets,  and  institutions.  The  study,  from  the  Bank  for  International \nSettlements, identifies two types of externalities as the key drivers of systemic risk: joint \nfailures of institutions resulting from their common exposures at a single point in time, and \nprocyclicality, the fact that the dynamics of the financial system and of the real economy \nreinforce each other, increasing the amplitude of booms and busts and undermining stability \nin both the financial sector and the real economy.69  In addition, the research shows that the \n                                                \n65.

In addition, vast unmet demand makes bubbles less \nlikely to develop on a larger scale. \nIn sum, financial inclusion introduces new lines of business with idiosyncratic risk profiles \nthat can be appropriately regulated and supervised. The contribution to systemic risk is likely \nto  be  rather  low,  especially  relative  to  consumer  protection  and  reputational  risk \nconsiderations. Especially with respect to technology-based financial inclusion policies, such \nas mobile phone banking, regulatory concerns have focused on financial integrity rather than \nstability  through  FATF  policy  frameworks  to  combat  money  laundering  and  terrorist \nfinancing.  \nThe  implementation  of  FATF  standards  requires  a  risk-based  approach  similar  to  that \nrequired for regulation and supervision of institutions serving low-income clients. It has a \ndirect impact on financial inclusion because customer due diligence through restrictive know-\nyour-customer rules may limit outreach potential. National regulations risk either excluding \npeople who lack certain proofs of identity or imposing prohibitive cost of compliance on \nfinancial institutions.73 \n6.2  Financial Inclusion: Cushioning Crisis Impact at the Local \nLevel?  \nAn oft-cited feature of past crises, especially the Asian financial crisis, has been the stability \nand  growth  of  financial  institutions  catering  to  the  poor  amid  the  turmoil  that  toppled \ninternationally  exposed  corporate  lenders.  As  a  result,  local  economic  activities  could \ncontinue, at least to some extent, or recover more quickly.  \nMicrofinance institutions that do not mobilize deposits tend to be harder hit when a systemic \ncrisis triggers a credit crunch, so that funds for on-lending to low-income clients are no \nlonger forthcoming because existing credit lines cannot be rolled over. This has also been \nobserved during the current crisis (CGAP 2009a). The transmission of a higher-level crisis \nthrough this credit channel can have a severe consequences for the local economy that \notherwise might be more isolated from national or even international shocks. \nIt remains an empirical question to confirm beyond anecdotal evidence how important local \nfinancial  intermediation  is  as  a  transmission  mechanism  for  (or  protection  against)  an \n                                                \n70.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: HOW \nFINANCIAL INCLUSION EQUIPS THE POOR TO COPE \nWITH INSTABILITY \nThe global economic crisis, despite its roots in financial sectors of industrial countries, will \nlikely shift the focus of future financial inclusion policies. The fundamental rethinking of the \nrole of government in finance triggered by the crisis has built huge momentum for regulatory \nchange. Policymakers should seize the current reform drive to advance financial inclusion \npolicies that foster economic resilience. \nPostcrisis opportunities to promote financial inclusion hinge on the careful analysis of the \nrisks posed by the transactions of the poor. In the absence of such analysis, the heightened \nrisk  perception  could  usher  in  an  indiscriminate  restriction  of  innovation.  In  formulating \nfinancial inclusion policies, policymakers should leverage successful innovations developed \nby their peers that realized the benefits of financial inclusion in safe ways.  \nPeer-to-peer  exchange  among  developing  countries,  as  facilitated  by  the  Alliance  for \nFinancial Inclusion\u2014a global network of policymakers in developing countries\u2014will help \nrefine and spread these insights widely, enabling other countries to adapt and scale up \nsuccessful innovations.  \nMost important, the crisis calls for a shift from credit to savings. Access to savings should be \na top priority because it promises three important benefits: \n\u2014enhanced  household  capacity  to  manage  the  vulnerabilities  exposed  by  the \ndevastating impact of the crisis,  \n\u2014diversified funding base of financial institutions to cushion the impact of a global \ncredit crunch on domestic financial intermediation, and  \n\u2014deeper financial systems that enhance economic resilience by accelerating growth, \nfacilitating diversification, and reducing poverty.  \nThe 2.5 billion unbanked adults are especially vulnerable to economic shocks because they \nare confined to the inferior risk management features of informal finance. Low-income clients \nthat can build assets before a crash have somewhere to run for cover. \nResearch has revealed substantial pent-up demand for formal savings that help overcome \nthe costly credit barriers to business expansion. As a result, income and expenditures grow, \nand health outcomes prove more resilient to turmoil. Better household capacity to manage \nrisks frees up public expenditure during times of crisis. Financial inclusion also has been \nshown  to  reduce  income  inequality.  Stronger  social  cohesion  helps  prevent  political \ninstability and permits undivided attention to crisis management. Social safety nets can \nsimultaneously boost financial inclusion when benefits are delivered through basic bank \naccounts in the formal financial sector. With the subprime meltdown illustrating the dangers \nof  reckless  lending  practices,  consumer  protection  has  surfaced  on  the  policy  agenda. \nFinancial education initiatives have been gaining momentum recently; policymakers now see \na stronger rationale to build financial education into high school and college curricula, and \nseek greater participation from the private sector in this endeavor. \nHowever, further research is needed, especially in the following fields: \n\u2014Key  barriers  to  access:  at  the  strategic  level,  systematic  diagnostic  efforts  to \nidentify \u201cbinding constraints\u201d to financial access will help policymakers set priorities \nfor action.  \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 259    Hannig and Jansen \n \n\u2014Randomized  controlled  trials  (RCT):  more  effective  incorporation  of  RCT  into \nregulatory decisionmaking will allow for a deeper understanding of the impacts of \nspecific products or services, and should be used more systematically to obtain \ninsights into the appropriate sequencing of reforms.  \n\u2014Data and evidence: updated information on levels and trends of financial inclusion \nis a critical step toward evidence-based policy decisions. Data collection must be \ntailored  to  objectives  and  available  resources.  Policymakers  should  expand \ncollaboration with local researchers to build capacity for the collection of demand-side \ndata. \n\u2014Risk: greater risk analysis of the scaling-up of technology-based financial inclusion \npolicies with respect to financial stability is necessary to fill critical knowledge gaps \ndue to rapid recent innovation. \nOverall,  a  combination  of  showcasing  of  viable  business  models  at  the  bottom  of  the \npyramid,  technological  innovation  that  lowers  transaction  costs,  and  rapid  growth  and \nprogress in poverty alleviation over the past years has helped to attract substantial private \nsector investment and pushed the access frontier outwards. Policymakers have facilitated \nstrong results by adapting regulatory frameworks to financial innovation in the low-income \nmarket segment, and have been able to do so without falling short of their policy goals of \nfinancial stability or customer protection. With these recommendations in mind, there is \npotential to make the necessary gains in expanding financial access without compromising \nfinancial stability. The current crisis thus offers a unique opportunity for policymakers to \nadvance financial inclusion policies that promote economic resilience. \n25 ", "ADBI Working Paper 259    Hannig and Jansen \n \nREFERENCES \nAguirre, Ernesto, Denise Dias, and Klaus Prochaska. 2008. \u201cDiagnostic Report on the Legal \nand Regulatory Environment for Branchless Banking in Colombia.\u201d Washington: \nCGAP.  \nAPEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Business Advisory Council. 2008. \n\u201cCommercially Sustainable Microfinance: A Strategy for Promoting Financial \nInclusion in APEC.\u201d Report of a workshop jointly organized by the Advisory Group on \nAPEC Financial System Capacity Building and the APEC Business Advisory Council. \nJakarta. \nBanco do Nordeste do Brasil. 2010. \u201cBackground\u201d \n(www.bnb.gov.br/Content/aplicacao/O_Banco/Historico_eng/gerados/hist_principal.a\nsp). \nBanerjee, Abhijeet, and others. 2009. \u201cThe Miracle of Microfinance?
