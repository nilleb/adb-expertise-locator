Introduction\nFor decades the emphasis of development policy has been shifting, depending on \nwhat economists believe should be the best course of action for developing countries; \nin particular, where achieving high and sustained growth to help them catch up with \ndeveloped countries is concerned. Many economists in the newly formed nations \nfollowing decolonization after World War II implemented planning and import substitution \nstrategies after independence in the 1950s and 1960s. While for a time these strategies \nseemed to work, they ran out of steam. Likewise, institutions like the World Bank started \nrecommending market- and outward-oriented approaches that emphasized the virtues \nof the price mechanism. By the late 1980s, the different market-oriented views and \npolicies were consolidated into the so-called Washington Consensus reform package.1 \nHowever, toward the end of the 1990s, it became clear that the reform package \nadvocated by the Washington Consensus could not work without being supplemented \nby a solid governance and institutional foundation. Thus, the initial reform list advocated \nby supporters of the Consensus was augmented with a series of so-called second-\ngeneration reforms that emphasized the role of institutions and governance. However, \nthe augmented Washington Consensus reform package did not work either, as evidence \nshowed that countries that adopted and implemented comprehensive reform packages \nreaped small benefits. Rodrik (2006, 2) argues that \u201cthe question now is not whether \nthe Washington Consensus is dead or alive; it is what will replace it.\u201d In recent years, \neconomists have observed that countries that implemented well-focused reforms in key \nareas accelerated growth. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, and Viet Nam \nare good examples.\nIn the context described above, Hausmann et al. (2006) have recently analyzed how \ngrowth rates accelerated in the past. They define \u201cgrowth acceleration\u201d as an instance \n\u0004  The reform package was structured upon three key concepts, \u201cstabilization\u201d, \u201cliberalization\u201d, and \u201cprivatization\u201d, \nand included fiscal discipline, reorientation of public expenditures, tax reform, financial liberalization, unified and \ncompetitive exchange rates, trade liberalization, openness to foreign direct investment, privatization, deregulation, \nand secure property rights.", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nwhen a country starts growing by at least 3.5% per capita for a period of at least 8 years. \nThese authors find that growth accelerations are frequent phenomena, and that they \ndo not require a long \u201claundry list\u201d of reforms. They conclude that growth accelerations \nhappen when binding constraints on growth are removed. As a result, they have \nproposed a growth diagnostics approach to formulating growth strategies. This approach \nis becoming part of the toolkit used by donor agencies for purposes of formulating their \noperational strategies in developing countries.    \nThis paper aims at clarifying the primary objectives of the growth diagnostics approach \nand what in our view are some limitations for operational use. We emphasize that the key \nto benefiting from the full potential that this approach offers lies in a proper understanding \nof what it does; and being forewarned about the indiscriminate application of the \napproach to developing countries, for it can lead to misguided conclusions. The rest of \nthe paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we summarize the main features of the \ngrowth diagnostics approach. Section III discusses some important limitations of this \napproach. Section IV provides some final thoughts.\nII. What is the Growth Diagnostics Approach?\nThe growth diagnostics approach provides a framework for formulating hypotheses on \nwhat may be constraining a country\u2019s growth. This approach views economic growth \nas the result of an optimization process under constraints, and seeks to identify the \nfactors that are the most binding, in the sense that their removal would allow a growth \nspurt. It assumes a simple growth model whose production function depends on several \nfactors such as physical and human capital, governance, institutions, infrastructure, and \ngeography. The objective is to identify the binding constraints by estimating shadow \nprices whereby a higher shadow price reflects scarcity of the resource, indicating that the \nresource constraints growth. Hausmann et al. (2005) propose a methodology based on \na decision tree where low levels of private investment and entrepreneurship are seen as \nthe key problem. See Figure 1.", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  3\nFigure 1: Growth Diagnostics Decision Tree\nProblem: Low levels of private investment and entrepreneurship\nLow return to economic activity High cost of finance\nLow social returns Low appropriability Bad international Bad local finance\nfinance\ngovernment market\nfailures failures\ninformation coordination\npoor bad\nexternalities: externalities\ngeography infrastructure\n\u201cself-discovery\u201d\nmicro risks: macro risks: low domestic poor\nlow human\nproperty rights, financial, saving intermediation\ncapital\ncorruption, taxes monetary,\nfiscal instability\nSource: Hausmann et el. (2005).\nThe tree takes researchers through different branches (starting with two options: high cost \nof finance, or low returns) in order to determine the root causes of the problem, i.e., the \nbinding constraints to economic growth.\nThere is a connection between Hirschman\u2019s (1958) theory of unbalanced growth and the \ngrowth diagnostics approach that is worth highlighting. Hirschman argued that, in the \nabsence of sufficient resources, especially capital, entrepreneurs, decision makers and, \nabove all, the means and ability to bring them all into play, policy makers have to choose \nthe projects that will make the greatest contribution to development, relative to their cost. \nHirschman distinguished between substitution choices, those that involve a decision \nwhether to undertake project A or project B; and postponement choices, those that \ninvolve a decision in the sequence of projects. Hirschman was mainly concerned with the \nlatter type of decisions and argued that priority should be based on how advancement in \none project would induce progress in another. He argued that preference should be given \nto that sequence of projects that maximizes \u201cinduced decision making\u201d. Inducements \nresult from interdependence of activities, which can be measured in terms of backward \nand forward linkages.2\n2  Krugman (\u0004995) argued that Hirschman\u2019s idea of linkages was vague due to its lack of formalization. He argues \nthat some followers of Hirschman have identified linkages with \u201chaving a lot of entries in the input\u2013output table\u201d \n(Krugman \u0004995, 43). However, Krugman argued, \u201cHirschman\u2019s own discussion makes it clear that the idea involved ", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nIn the growth diagnostics approach of Hausmann et al. (2005), the focus is on identifying \nthe binding constraints for purposes of policy reform. The underlying idea is that removal \nof a supposedly low number of key constraints (i.e., focused intervention) will have a \nlarger impact on growth than the traditional approach based on a long list of reforms \nassociated, correctly or incorrectly, with the so-called Washington Consensus, which \nintended to remove all distortions at the same time. Therefore, there is a connection \nbetween the theory of unbalanced growth and growth diagnostics, in that both propose \nfocused interventions. According to Hausmann et al. (2005), countries that have \nconducted well-targeted reforms to remove the most severe binding constraints, such \nas the PRC in 1978 and India in 1980, display better growth performance than those \ncountries that undertook comprehensive economic reforms. The growth diagnostics \napproach also takes the view that each country has its own binding constraints. This is \nalso in sharp contrast with the traditional approach of directing the same Washington-\nconsensus-style reforms in all countries. \nIt is important to note that, by focusing on investment, the growth diagnostics approach is \nreminiscent of the idea that developing countries\u2019 main problem is the shortage of capital \nequipment and productive capacity (the latter understood as potential production). In \nterms of the production possibility frontier, the problem of many developing countries is \nthat some of the available resources are not fully utilized (e.g., people are unemployed). \nUnder these circumstances, it is clear that growth requires higher utilization of the \ncountry\u2019s production capacity. The country, therefore, has to try to get closer to the \ntransformation curve. This does not mean that developing countries do not suffer from \ninadequacy of effective demand or from allocative efficiency problems. Indeed they do. \nEffective demand problems are not entirely absent in developing countries and they can \neven become the binding constraints on production in developing countries at a fairly \nadvanced stage of industrialization (e.g., PRC, Malaysia, Thailand).3 Effective demand \nproblems (i.e., lack of demand) can be the result of, for example, being balance-of-\npayments constrained (McCombie and Thirlwall 1994). Certainly the problem of markets \nmay limit developing countries\u2019 growth rate. For example, the export sector of developing \ncountries could be expanded by bringing in foreign capital. Or, it could also be argued \nthat, in the countryside, the capacity for producing goods is so variable, and can be \nexpected to be so responsive to increases in demand that it can be thought of as being \ndemand-determined. 4\nthe interaction between market size and economies of scale. In Hirschman\u2019s definition of backward linkages, the \nrole of market-size externalities linked to economies of scale is quite explicit: an industry creates a backward \nlinkage when its demand enables an upstream industry to be established at least minimum economic scale. The \nstrength of an industry\u2019s backward linkages is to be measured by the probability that it will in fact push other \nindustries over the threshold. Forward linkages involve an interaction between scale and market size was well; in \nthis case the definition is vaguer, but seems to involve the ability of an industry to reduce the costs of potential \ndownstream users of its products and thus, again, push them over the threshold of profitability.\u201d\n3  Even in these cases one must be careful not to confuse bottlenecks in some markets with a generalized problem of \neffective demand. If anything, the PRC still suffers from weak domestic demand, and while there are a few isolated \nbottlenecks in the economy, in general there are plenty of inputs, mostly labor, available to increase production.\n4  For productive capacity to be fully utilized there must be sufficient effective demand. Classical (and neoclassical) \neconomists believed this to be the case due to their belief in Say\u2019s Law (i.e., supply creates its own demand) and ", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  \u0018\nAllocative efficiency problems are also present in developing countries. The combination \nof goods and services being produced in developing countries is often not the one \nthat maximizes the value of output at the prevailing prices. Growth will occur then by \nproducing a different combination of goods, even with a constant productive capacity. \nThink, for example, of problems in the agricultural sector when prices are highly \nregulated. Removal of this constraint will allow a significant adjustment in farmers\u2019 \nproduction, as they will respond to price signals. Growth in this case is said to be due \nto improvements in allocative efficiency. This is a problem that affects mostly developed \ncountries. Their efforts are directed toward eliminating this inefficiency, e.g., reforms in \nproduct and factor markets.\nSome developed and semi-industrialized economies possess a level of capital equipment \nthat is adequate for the existing labor force. This allows them to generate high labor \nproductivity and, consequently, a high income per capita, provided capital is fully utilized \nand is used productively. The problem in many developing countries is different. It is true \nthat their capital equipment, however small, may be underutilized. The issue, however, \nis that even in case equipment were fully utilized, it would not be capable of absorbing \nthe available labor force, leading to low capital\u2013labor ratios, a form of underemployment. \nIn other words, the problem of many developing countries is the deficiency of productive \ncapacity rather than the anomaly of its underutilization (Kalecki 1966). Hence, most \ndeveloping countries are often below full employment. Most likely, the poorer the country, \nthe more important the problem of lack of productive capacity will be; while the more \nadvanced the country, the more important the problem of lack of effective demand will be. \nFrom this point of view, the objective of development is to increase productive capacity, \nand the process of economic development may be described as a generalized process of \ncapital accumulation.\nTherefore, from the point of view of the national economy as a whole, the major obstacle \nto the development of many poor countries is the shortage of productive capacity. \nThis is obvious in policy discussions in countries like India, Pakistan, or Philippines, \nwhere there are constant references to the \u201clow investment\u201d problem. This constraint \n(i.e., low investment) lowers growth and prevents the elimination of unemployment and \nunderemployment, even when an increase in demand would make the expansion of \noutput profitable.\nThis view of the role of capital in development is not, however, universally accepted. \nLewis (2004, 247) has argued that \u201cthe way capital affects economic performance is not \nwell understood.\u201d He further elaborates: \u201cDifferences in labor productivity arise because of \nthe neglect of demand factors. Hence, they concluded that the level of production would correspond to productive \ncapacity. The belief in Say\u2019s Law ultimately derives from the view that markets function efficiently and competitively \nso that the prices of all factors and goods speedily adjust to their equilibrium level at which demand equals supply. \nOn these assumptions, all factors of production are fully utilized. Moreover, market forces allocate the resources \navailable at any time in such an optimal manner that the total value of all goods and services produced in an \neconomy is the maximum that can be attained.", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nthe different ways firms have chosen to organize their labor and capital\u2026 those choices \nare heavily influenced by the nature of competition, which is determined primarily by \ngovernment rules and regulations\u201d (Lewis 2004, 247\u201348). We shall expound upon the \nimplications of Lewis\u2019s views in the next section.\nThe growth diagnostics methodology can be a useful tool for policymakers to formulate \na focused development strategy in the presence of limited resources. It can also be a \ngreat help for donor agencies in order to set up priorities in their operations, therefore \nmaximizing the impact of their assistance to the recipient countries. Even if we have \ncomprehensive sector assessments for all major sectors, it is not feasible to determine \npriorities among the sectors for operational purposes. The lack of systematic assessment \nof binding constraints has at times resulted in fragmented or not well-focused operational \nstrategies and programs. Therefore, donor agencies have \u201cbought\u201d the new approach and \nundertaken pilot testing exercises of this new approach in some countries.5\nIII. What are Limitations of the Growth Diagnostics \nApproach?\nThe growth diagnostics approach has, in our view, some limitations. This does not \nmean that the approach is incorrect or wrong. Quite the opposite. The approach indeed \nprovides a well-structured methodology to think about why some countries do not appear \nto take off, and forces policy makers to seriously think about what prevents a poor \ncountry from growing faster.6 What we argue, as practitioners, is that the implementation \nof the growth diagnostics methodology is not a straightforward process; and second, that \npolicy makers have to be aware of what we believe are some important issues in deciding \nwhether this methodology is appropriate, given the problem(s) of the particular country \nunder study. As development practitioners, we believe that the work of Hausmann et al. \n(2005) is only the start. The methodology has to be improved, as there are a number of \nloose ends. A total of 10 issues are discussed below. \n5  Leipziger and Zagha (2006) report that the World Bank conducted \u00042 pilot studies (Armenia, Baltic countries, \nBangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Madagascar, Morocco, Tanzania, and Thailand) in 2005. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank also conducted such exercise for the Philippines in 2007 (ADB 2007). The World Bank reports are \navailable in the World Bank PREM website: web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTABOUTUS/ORGANIZATION/\nEXTPREMNET/0,,contentMDK:20606439~menuPK:4833683~pagePK:64\u000459605~piPK:64\u000457667~theSitePK:48996\u0004,00.\nhtml.\n6  We will not get into the debate of whether or not growth diagnostics is superior as a methodology to regression \nanalysis.", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  \u0018\nA.  Exclusive Focus on Economic Growth\nThe growth diagnostics approach focuses exclusively on economic growth. Hausman \net al. (2005) indicate that while development is a broad concept entailing the raising of \nhuman capabilities in general, we believe increasing economic growth rates is the central \nchallenge that developing nations face. This is an important statement since as a result \nof focusing on economic growth, the approach places other important policy objectives \nof the government\u2014including poverty, income distribution, environmental protection, and \nbasic human needs\u2014outside the approach\u2019s scope.\nB.  Difficulties in Identifying Price and Nonprice Signals\nAlthough the underlying idea is itself quite clear, in practice, it is not easy to find signals \nthat guide the diagnostics process. The approach requires searching for both price and \nnonprice signals. Price signals in this context are the shadow prices of resources. If the \nshadow price of a certain resource is high, it is inferred that growth is constrained by \nthe resource. However, in practice, it is not easy to measure shadow prices. It is thus \ninevitable for researchers to rely on theoretical grounds and indirect evidence for judging \nthe scarcity of a resource. Moreover, even if we could measure the equilibrium price of \na resource, this may not necessarily reflect a constraint on growth. Aghion and Durlauf \n(2007) explain this problem by discussing low interest rates under credit rationing.7\nThe authors of the growth diagnostics approach also recommend researchers to check \nnonprice signals, since, when a constraint binds growth, it generally results in activities \nand arrangements designed to get around the constraint. Strict government controls, for \nexample, can lead to high informality in economic activities. The lack of adequate legal \nmechanisms can create informal mechanisms of conflict settlement. Application of this \napproach, therefore, requires in-depth knowledge of the economy being analyzed as well \nas the ability to rank interventions. This implies that it is possible for two researchers \napplying the growth diagnostics methodology to reach different conclusions.\nC.  Private Investment as the Key to Economic Growth\nThe growth diagnostics approach assumes, at least judging from the original work of \nHausmann et al. (2005), as well from applications of the approach to some economies, \nthat private investment is the key to economic growth. Certainly we do not accuse the \nauthors of being \u201ccapital fundamentalists\u201d. Our point is simply that we find it surprising \nthat the problem, in every single case analyzed, is the same, namely lack of private \ninvestment. Earlier, Rodrik (1999) had already emphasized the central role of private \n7  Credit rationing appears when financial institutions decide not to increase interest rates despite a higher demand \nfor loans. This is done in order to avoid a higher default risk. Aghion and Durlauf (2007) argue that, with a high \ndegree of credit rationing, a higher supply of loanable funds can result in a lower equilibrium interest rate. This \nimplies that a low interest rate does not mean that the credit market is not constrained.", "\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\ninvestment in order to achieve a higher growth rate, based on the assessment of the \nsuccessful developing economies. Rodrik argued that \u201cthe key is to induce the private \nsector to invest by enhancing the perceived returns to private investments and to \ngenerate a virtuous cycle of profits, investments, and capacity expansion\u201d (Rodrik 1999, \n64). From this assessment, it is clear that the growth diagnostics approach is based upon \nRodrik\u2019s observation about the long-term growth performance of the successful countries.\nThe decision tree used in all studies so far conducted regards \u201clow levels of private \ninvestments and entrepreneurship\u201d as the key problem. Based on this assumption, \nthese analyses try to identify the root causes of low private investment, and, hence, low \ngrowth. There is no single case where a different decision tree has been developed to \nanalyze growth.8 This is consistent with the arguments in the Introduction, namely, that \nthe objective of most developing countries is to increase productive capacity. Likewise, \nfocusing on investment brings to mind Lewis\u2019 idea that \u201cthe central fact of economic \ndevelopment is rapid capital accumulation\u201d (Lewis 1954), and that the process of \ndevelopment is one of transforming a country from being a 5% saver and investor to \na 12% saver and investor (Lewis 1955).9 In the same vein, Rosenberg (1960) argued \nthat \u201cOne need not subscribe to a monocausal theory of development to argue that an \nincrease in the percentage of annual output devoted to investment is an urgent and \nindispensable prerequisite to a long-term rise in real per capita incomes.\u2026 A central \nquestion in a theory of development, then, is: Why are rates of capital formation as low \nas they apparently are in most underdeveloped countries?\u201d (Rosenberg 1960, 706\u201307). \nRosenberg also argues that there are two main factors explaining capital deficiency, \nnamely, low saving propensities and weakness in the inducement to invest. This is very \nmuch reminiscent of Hausmann et al.\u2019s (2005) decision tree. \nThe relevance of investment is most likely true in the context of igniting growth. Indeed, \nthere is no doubt that some critical level of (private) investment is needed to jump-start \ngrowth. However, once a country is growing, a high and increasing investment share \nmay not be a necessary requirement in order to continue growing or even to accelerate \ngrowth. Indeed, historically, there are many countries that have achieved high growth \nwithout a high investment share. It is worth noting that Hausmann et al.\u2019s (2006) work \non growth accelerations (as defined in the Introduction) shows that, although these are \ncorrelated with increases in investment (i.e., growth accelerations seem to require more \ninvestment), the latter are not a predictor of growth transitions.10\nFigure 2 shows the scatter plot of annual (average) GDP growth during five subperiods: \n1960\u20131969, 1970\u20131979, 1980\u20131989, 1990\u20131999, and 2000\u20132004; and the investment \n8  See Boyer (2006), who has developed a different decision tree to analyze unemployment, i.e., what are the factors \nlimiting employment?\n9  Lewis (\u0004955) indicated that the countries that are now relatively developed have at some time in the past gone \nthrough a rapid acceleration in the course of which their rate of net investment has moved from 5% [of national \nincome] or less to \u00042% or more.\n\u00040 Their regressions do not even show this variable. We take this to imply that it was statistically insignificant.", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  \u0018\nFigure 2: Growth and Investment\nPooled Data: 146 Countries, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2004\u201304 (percent)\n21.6\n18\nAverage GDP growth rate = 5.6 Average GDP growth rate = 6.2\nAverage investment to GDP ratio = 17.4 Average investment to GDP ratio = 27.6\n14 II I\n10\ne \nt\na 6\nR\nh \nwt 3.8\no 1960s\nGr 2\n1970s\n1980s\n\u22122\n1990s\n2000\u221204\nIII IV\n\u22126\nAverage GDP growth rate = 1.5 Average GDP growth rate = 1.2\nAverage investment to GDP ratio = 15.9 Average investment to GDP ratio = 26.5\n\u221210\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nInvestment Share\nCote d\u2019Ivoire, Guinea Bissau Uruguay, Zimbabwe Pakistan\nSource SS d.f.

The vertical and horizontal lines that \ndivide all cases are the overall mean investment share (21.6%) and the overall mean \ngrowth rate (3.8%). These two lines therefore divide the countries into four groups: first \nquadrant (I), countries with above-average both growth rates and investment shares; \nsecond quadrant (II), countries with growth rate above the world average but investment \nshare below the world average; third quadrant (III), countries with both growth rate and \ninvestment share below the average; and fourth quadrant (IV), countries with growth \nrate  below the average but investment share above the average. Figure 2 also shows \nthe mean growth and mean investment share for the countries in each quadrant. The \naverage investment share in the first and fourth quadrants are about the same and about \n10 percentage points higher than the average investment shares in the second and \nthird quadrants.

After all, the growth diagnostics methodology does \nnot provide a benchmark to establish when a given investment share is low.

It is worth noting that Singapore and Thailand achieved \ntheir highest growth rate in the 1960s (9.5% and 7.8%, respectively), while they \nhad the lowest investment share (19.8% and 20.5%, respectively). In particular, \nSingapore\u2019s investment share increased during the last decades by more than \ntwofold, although its growth rate is lower than what it achieved during the 1960s \nwhen its investment share was at the lowest. Malaysia achieved the highest \ngrowth rate in the 1970s (7.7%) and an investment rate of 22.9%, well below the \ninvestment shares of the 1980s and 1990s when its GDP growth was lower. The \nIndonesian and Korean cases are similar to that of Malaysia.15\n(vi)  There is one and only one country in our sample whose growth rate in each of \nthe five subperiods was above the world mean of 3.8% and whose investment \nrate was below the world mean of 21.6% (i.e., that has always been in quadrant \nII): Pakistan. Pakistan\u2019s average investment share for 1960\u20132004 is 17.6% (4 \npercentage points below the world average), and the average growth rate for \nthe same period is 5.4% (1.6 percentage points above the world average). It \nis therefore difficult to argue that investment is a binding constraint on growth \nin Pakistan. It is true that when Pakistan is compared with the most successful \ncountries in Asia in terms of growth, its performance is not as stellar. But when \nplaced in the world context, its performance is not disastrous. Moreover, when \nwe graphed Pakistan\u2019s annual growth rate since the 1960s a number of important \nfeatures led to further questioning of the thesis that Pakistan\u2019s problem is how \nto ignite growth. These are: (a) the economy is characterized by boom-bust \ncycles; (b) average growth, as noted above, during the last 40 years has been \n5.4%; (c) there has not been a single year of negative growth; (d) important \ndecelerations in growth are related to poor performance of the agricultural \nsector; and (e) the largest contributor to output growth is the service sector. We \nconcluded that Pakistan\u2019s key (macro) problem is not how to ignite growth, but \n\u00044 We are not implying that being in this quadrant is necessarily \u201cbetter\u201d than being in quadrant I. Some of the \ncountries in this group be may have achieved consumption-led growth combined with low productivity in \nagriculture and services, which requires little capital formation.\n\u00045 Obviously, if we had used decadal averages instead of the average growth rate and investment share for the whole \nperiod, results would have been slightly different. In the \u0004960s, the average growth rate was 4.96% and the average \ninvestment share was \u00048.3%. Among the fast growing Asian economies, only Malaysia was in quadrant II while \nIndonesia was in the third; Hong Kong, China; Korea; Singapore; and Thailand were in quadrant I. In the \u0004970s, the \naverage growth rate and average investment share were 4.88% and 23.\u00046%, respectively. The countries in quadrant \nII were Indonesia and Malaysia; Hong Kong, China; Korea; Singapore; Philippines; and Thailand were in quadrant \nI. In the \u0004980s, the average growth rates were 2.9\u0004% and 23.02%. Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Korea; Malaysia; \nSingapore; and Thailand were in quadrant I, while the Philippines was in quadrant III.

The key finding here is that the Hausmann-Rodrik-Velasco path, assumed \nin the growth diagnostics approach, is only one option for countries to improve \ntheir growth performance. Growth is possible without a higher investment share. \nFor these countries, the problem, if any, is not investment, but something else.17 \nAnd finally, four countries shifted to quadrant IV. We call these the \u201cinefficient \ncountries\u201d, since they failed to accelerate growth even with a higher investment \nshare.\nD.  Capital Accumulation as the Key to Growth and Development\nAs noted in the Introduction, Lewis (2004) has challenged the view that capital \naccumulation is the key to growth and development, as well as the public debate around \nthe prescription that what poor countries need is more capital. He makes two crucial \npoints: (i) capital does not automatically increase labor productivity; and (ii) what capital \ndoes is to increase the capacity for growth. This means that developing countries could \nincrease their performance dramatically without any significant increase in capital. To \nbecome rich, however, they need additional capital. The problem in most developing \ncountries is in the efficiency with which they use existing capital. To see this, one can \nthink of the role of capital accumulation in a growth accounting exercise. The growth rate \nof the capital stock (K\u02d8 ) can be written as K\u02d8 =(K\uf026/K)=(I/K)=(I/Y)\u00d7(Y/K), where  \n(I/Y ) is the investment share and (Y/K) denotes capital productivity. This means that \ncapital accumulation depends on two factors: one is the amount of investment (as a \nshare of output), and the other one is the productivity with which this capital is used. \nThis implies that two different countries could achieve the same growth rate of the capital \nstock with different investment shares, depending on the productivity of capital. Lewis\u2019s \npoint is that developing countries\u2019 performance could improve substantially by working \non this second factor. Lewis insists that \u201cimproving the rules and regulations governing \ncompetition would improve not only labor productivity but also capital productivity\u201d (Lewis \n2004, 251; emphasis added). Naturally, in the long run, and in order to become a rich \ncountry, developing countries with spare labor capability (i.e., labor surplus), need to build \noffices and manufacturing plants where these workers can work. That is, countries need \nto increase the capacity to produce goods and services. Lewis remarks: \u201cOf course, the \ntotal capital required to increase capacity depends on the efficiency with which the capital \nis employed\u201d (Lewis 2004, 250). It therefore seems that Lewis reverses the role of capital \nfor purposes of igniting and sustaining growth, i.e., in the short run, developing countries \ndo not need more capital; what they need is to use more efficiently the one they have. To \nachieve this, reforms of rules and regulations governing competition is the key. However, \nin the long run, and to become rich countries, developing countries will need more capital. \n18 This view is in line with that of Easterly (2002), who concluded that in the short run \n\u00047 In 2007, the Philippines achieved a growth rate of 7.3%, the highest rate in three decades, without increasing \nprivate investment. In fact, there was an increase in public investment.\n\u00048 Rodrik (\u0004999) emphasized the key role of private investment for achieving a higher long-term growth rate, based \non an assessment of the long-term growth performance of a number of successful economies. However, Hausmann ", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  1\u0018\n\u201c\u2026there is no evidence that investment is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for \nhigh growth [\u2026] empirically, increases in investment are neither necessary nor sufficient \nfor increases in growth over the short to medium run (Easterly 2002, 40; italics added).19 \nThis agrees with Hausmann et al.\u2019s (2006) work on the role of investment in growth \naccelerations discussed above.\nE.  Static Nature of the Problem\nAnother problem with the methodology lies in its static nature. It focuses on constraints \nthat are binding today, but not necessarily in the future. In this sense, the approach \nwas originally designed to detect binding constraints to \u201cinitiating growth\u201d for stagnant \neconomies. However, the problem of many economies, particularly in Asia, is not how to \nstart growth but how to sustain their strong growth performance in the medium and long \nterm. \nRodrik admits that \u201ca policymaker interested in igniting economic growth may be better \nserved by targeting the most binding constraints on economic growth\u2014where the bang for \nthe reform buck is greatest\u2014than by investing scarce political and administrative capital \non ambitious institutional reforms. Of course, institutional reform will be needed eventually \nto sustain economic growth. But it may be easier and more effective to do that when the \neconomy is already growing and its costs can be spread over time\u201d (Rodrik 2006, 12). \nIt is clear that for Rodrik, sustaining growth requires long-term institutional changes so \nthat economies can absorb shocks and promote diversification (Rodrik 2007b).20 But \nthis is different from the requirements to ignite growth. Hausmann (2006) argues that \naccelerating growth and sustaining high growth require very different approaches. If \nyou have a country that is not growing much, the strategy to get it to grow fast should \nbe to remove the most binding constraint. When the country is already growing fast, \nthe challenge is to remove the future constraints as they become actually or potentially \nbinding. For the originators of the growth diagnostics approach, growing economies are \noutside the scope of the growth diagnostics.\nA related problem is the lack of distinction between the implementation of certain \npolicies at a point in time, and the result of these policies, which may surface as a \nbinding constraint later on. For example, following the Washington Consensus approach, \na country may have been advised to cut its fiscal spending. This could result in \nunderinvestment in infrastructure, which the binding constraints approach may later on \nidentify as a binding constraint.\net al. (2005) seem to shift focus: the key to igniting growth is now private investment, while the key to sustaining \ngrowth in the long term is improvement in the quality of governance and institutions. In our view, this change in \ntheir position can be one of the sources of confusion about the objective of the growth diagnostics methodology.\n\u00049 On the other hand, Prichett (2003b) argues that the role of physical investment in growth is clear.  \n20 Hausmann et al. (2005, 24) also argue that \u201cIgniting economic growth may not require the infinite laundry list \nof reforms that have become the current consensus on best practices. But once the economy is on the path of \ngrowth, the onus is on policymakers to solve the institutional and other constraints that will inevitably become \nmore binding.\u201d ", "1\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nF.  Today\u2019s Binding Constraints, or Tomorrow\u2019s?\nSome recent growth diagnostics exercises, such as that of the World Bank (2006) for \nMorocco, argue forcefully the importance of targeting \u201cconstraints that might become \npotentially binding in the future but may require action now\u201d. Indeed, Leipziger and Zagha \n(2006) argue that \u201ceven though the framework focuses on short-run considerations, it \ndoes not ignore constraints that will emerge in the long run.\u201d However, application of the \ngrowth diagnostics in this direction faces the significant risk of losing its genuine value as \na tool for prioritizing policy reforms. Empirical evidence about today\u2019s binding constraints \nmay be found; but it is much more difficult, perhaps impossible, to find evidence on what \ntomorrow\u2019s binding constraints might be. Once one starts considering future possible \nbinding constraints without having clear assessing criteria (i.e., diagnostics signals), \nalmost all interventions and reforms can be easily justified, resulting in not well-focused \nstrategies. Understanding this problem is of significant importance for making this new \napproach operational and for a correct formulation of strategies. In this sense, one needs \nto recognize that the growth diagnostics approach is a tool to prioritize policy reforms \nneeded for igniting growth in stagnant economies.\nG.  Sequencing Policy Reforms\nWhile the question of how to sequence projects was a key issue in Hirschman\u2019s (1958) \nunbalanced growth theory, the growth diagnostics approach does not deal, at least \ndirectly, with the sequencing of policy reforms. Instead, the approach suggests that \npolicy makers should tackle current binding constraints. This can be easily understood \nby considering a simple case. Assume that the growth diagnostics exercise has identified \npoor banking intermediation as a key binding constraint. This means that policy makers \nshould focus on banking sector reforms. However, in formulating a plan and strategy \nfor reform, for example, to be undertaken during the next 5 years, policy makers may \nconsider reforms not just in the banking sector, but overall in the financial sector. Policy \nmakers (and donors) would therefore lay out a reform plan for the medium and long term, \nincluding second-generation reforms (e.g., capital markets). The initial growth diagnostics \napproach, however, did not contemplate this longer reform sequence. The problem is that \nif one starts considering the sequence of reforms in the overall financial sector, the value \nof the growth diagnostics approach vanishes, since the decisions about what to reform \nnext (i.e., after the banking sector) are not based on a growth diagnostics exercise. \nMoreover, if after the banking sector reforms have been implemented, another growth \ndiagnostics exercise were to be undertaken, this may or may not indicate that the new \nbinding constraint is in the financial sector.", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  1\u0018\nH.  Independence of Decisions and Branches\nA critical assumption in the growth diagnostics approach is the independence of the \nbranches in the decision tree. For example, the two upper branches of Hausmann et \nal.\u2019s (2005) decision tree, namely, high cost of finance and low private economic returns, \nmay not be independent, i.e., probably the same forces that explain one cause also \nexplain the other one. Indeed, the savings rate can be low due to lack of investment \nopportunities; and investment opportunities can be limited due to low saving. This implies \nthat high cost of finance and low return to investment (the starting point of the tree \ndiagram) cannot be treated as causes of low investment. Dixit (2005) argues that, in \nreality, each case of development failure may have multiple causes acting simultaneously. \nHe proposes a framework for narrowing down or identifying the causes of failures, but it \nremains at the conceptual level.21 This also implies that once one opts for one branch \nthen all other possible causes associated with the other branches are automatically \ndiscarded. For example, if early on the problem seems to be high cost of finance, then \ncoordination externalities or bad infrastructure would never be considered in the analysis.\nI.  Igniting versus Sustaining Growth\nThe approach does not explain what is the relationship between igniting growth and the \npolicies associated with it (i.e., investment), and sustaining growth and the corresponding \npolicies (i.e., development of institutions). How does the transition from one stage to \nthe next occur? Are they unconnected problems? Moreover, how do we know when \na country shifts from one phase into the next? While the authors, in particular Rodrik \n(2007a, section B), elaborate upon how to design institutions for sustaining growth during \nthe second stage, the transition path from the first stage remains vague. In our view, the \nauthors implicitly assume that adequate policies and reforms at each stage are totally \nindependent and do not have any interconnection. Thoma (2007, 21), however, argues: \n\u201cI would like to see the connections between the two stages, particularly how to set \nconditions in the first stage so as to make the second stage more likely, explored in more \ndepth.\u201d As discussed in Hausmann et al. (2006), the first phase of igniting growth seems \nto be much easier than getting to the sustaining process at the second stage. We thus \nshould know more about the transition path to situate the growth diagnostic approach into \na broad development strategy for developing countries.    \nTake a country like the Philippines, for years labeled the \u201csick man of Asia\u201d. The \ndiagnostic for a long time was that chronic underinvestment, corruption, economic \nmismanagement, large budget deficit, and political instability prevented it from matching \n2\u0004 This problem may appear in other parts of the tree. For example, and in the context of the Philippines, the high \ncost of external finance during 2002\u20132006 was due to the perceived fiscal crisis and the high public debt burden. \nAlso, the boom-bust cycles that characterize the performance of countries like Pakistan or the Philippines could be \nrelated to the current account (or investment\u2013savings) deficits during periods of high growth, which put a break on \nthe acceleration of growth. The current account deficit may be due to the inability to promote export growth, itself \nrelated to problems of self-discovery and an overvalued currency.", "1\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nthe performance of its regional peers. However, in 2007, the Philippines achieved a \ngrowth rate of 7.3%, the highest rate in three decades. Does this mean that policy \nmakers removed successfully the most binding constraints? Can we take this to mean \nthat the country has shifted from the phase of igniting growth to that sustaining it?22\nJ.  From One Extreme to Another One?\nFinally, the growth diagnostics approach represents the opposite of the much-criticized \nWashington consensus approach to reforms. If the latter suffers from the \u201claundry-list\u201d \nproblem (i.e., reform everything), it is difficult to believe that one can single out the most \nbinding constraint to growth. Growth is a very complex phenomenon that cannot be \nreduced to one single cause. \nIV.  Some Final Thoughts\nFor the reasons discussed in the previous section, there seems to be considerable \nconfusion among researchers about the aim of the growth diagnostics approach. For \nexample, Leipziger and Zagha (2006) argue that \u201cthe growth diagnostics framework \napplies to stagnant as well as rapidly growing economies\u201d and that \u201cconceptually, the \nquestion relates to the increase in the growth rate. Asking whether a zero growth rate can \nbe increased is no different from asking whether a positive growth rate can be increased.\u201d \nWe think this is grossly misleading. How can policies and reforms needed to initiate \ngrowth in a stagnant African country be same as those required to further increase the \nPRC\u2019s already high growth rates (or even to prevent them from falling)? \nA possible reason for this unfortunate confusion can be that, in their original paper, \nHausmann et al. (2005) did not elaborate upon the difference between \u201cigniting growth\u201d \nand \u201csustaining growth\u201d. They chose three countries as case studies, namely Brazil, \nDominican Republic, and El Salvador. Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c show the transition paths of \nthese three countries. Their intention to apply the growth diagnostics approach to Brazil \nand El Salvador was to show that their decision tree (starting from low private investment) \ncould lead to different outcomes at the end of the decision tree. According to their \nexercises, El Salvador\u2019s growth is constrained by high discovery costs; and Brazil\u2019s by \nhigh cost of finance. Why then did the authors need to refer to the Dominican Republic? \nIn our view, it is of critical importance to understand this case in order to recognize the \ndifference between igniting and sustaining growth. Although Hausmann et al. (2005) \n22 The nature of the engine of growth in the Philippines is an important issue. In the Philippines, the recent high \ngrowth is very much related to the increase in overseas remittances, which during the last 5 years ballooned \n(leading to a current account surplus despite a trade deficit). This is inevitably a consumption-led growth model, \nwhich may have consequences for long-run growth (due to low investments). See the excellent analysis by Magnoli \nBocchi (2008).", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  1\u0018\nFigure 5a: Transition Path of El Salvador\n21.6\n12\nnt) 8\ne\nc\ner 1960s\np\ne (\nRat 4 1990s 1970s 3.8\nh \nwt\no\nGr 2000\u221204\n0\n1980s\n\u22124\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nInvestment Share (percent)\nFigure 5b: Transition Path of Brazil\n21.6\n10\n1970s\nnt)\nce 6 1960s\ner\np\nate ( 3.8\nR\nh \nwt 2000\u221204 1980s\no\nGr 2\n1990s\n\u22122\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nInvestment Share (percent)", "\u00180  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nFigure 5c: Transition Path of the Dominican Republic\n21.6\n10\n1970s\nnt)\ne 6\nc\ner\np 1990s\nate ( 1960s 3.8\nR\nwth  1980s 2000\u221204\no\nGr 2\n\u22122\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nInvestment Share (percent)\ndiscussed the Dominican Republic, they did not apply the decision tree. They argued \nthat its recent economic stagnation was an inevitable result of policymakers\u2019 failure to \ninvest resources in institutional reforms and good governance when the country enjoyed \nfavorable growth in the 1970s. The authors, intentionally, picked up the experience of \nthe Dominican Republic to show the difference between igniting growth and sustaining \ngrowth. However, an unfortunate confusion was created by the authors\u2019 failure to provide \na thorough explanation of this case.\nMoreover, the analyses of El Salvador and Brazil seem to disregard that these economies \nwere, like the Dominican Republic, in quadrants I and II in the previous decades. While \nEl Salvador and Brazil were in quadrant III in 2000\u20132004, suggesting that the growth \ndiagnostics approach can be applicable to accelerate their growth rates, the long-term \ngrowth paths of the two countries indicate that they achieved higher growth in the 1960s \nand 1970s, when they were in quadrants I and II. This implies that by looking at these \ntwo countries at only one point in time, the authors lost the historical perspective and \nseem to have missed the point that one or two decades earlier they had achieved faster \ngrowth, and not necessarily with a higher investment share. Analysis of the reasons for \nwhy these countries\u2019 performance worsened during the 1980s may have led to a different \ndecision tree or to an altogether different type of study.23\n23 One cannot ignore, for example, the civil war in El Salvador; and the impact of the debt crisis on Brazil.", "Rethinking the Growth Diagnostics Approach: Questions from the Practitioners  |  \u00181\nThe conclusion, in our view, is that the growth diagnostics approach is a methodology \ndevised to uncover the key problem that constrains investment and, therefore, prevents \nigniting growth by increasing the rate of accumulation. But for countries already growing \n(like most Asian countries), the basic question is different; in most cases, it is how \nto sustain it; therefore, analyses should concentrate on reforms. For these countries, \nresearchers must design their own growth diagnostics exercise through a completely \ndifferent decision tree, as there are many different ways in which one can proceed and \nconceptualize the problems affecting each country. Therefore, the question asked cannot \nbe how to ignite growth, and the decision tree (if any) cannot start on a low investment \nrate. The route taken will depend on the question of interest. The latter should be either \nan important feature about a country\u2019s growth profile (e.g., what causes boom-bust \ncycles?); and/or a question with policy relevance (e.g., why has the country failed to \nindustrialize?). Finally, there is no reason why researchers cannot apply a combination \nof approaches that will yield different but complementary views of the question being \naddressed.", "\u0018\u0018  |  ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 13\u0018\nAppendix \nAppendix Table 1: Distribution of Economies by Quadrant, 2004\nQuadrant I Quadrant II Quadrant III Quadrant IV\nAlbania Angola Argentina Czech Republic\nAlgeria Bahrain Bolivia Dominican Republic\nArmenia Benin Brazil Eritrea\nAzerbaijan Bosnia and Herzegovina Burundi Gabon\nBangladesh Bulgaria Colombia Grenada\nBelarus Cambodia Comoros Guyana\nBelize Cameroon Congo, Dem.
