This paper provides an introductory snapshot of issues concerning \n\u201cstreet children\u201d in this vast and culturally diverse region. \n\n \nAlthough the term  street  children  is  neither  a  precise,  nor  very  useful  classification  for \nchildren \u201con\u201d or \u201cof\u201d the street, the term does serve as a point of engagement in considering the \nvariety  of  issues  and  problems  facing  far  too  many  vulnerable  children  in  urban  centers \nthroughout  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  In  this  paper,  street  children  is  used  as  shorthand  for \nchildren who might transit to the street, children on the street, or children who previously lived \non the street, with a variety of occupations, including beggar, rubbish picker, shoeshine boy or \nflower seller, sweat shop worker, sex worker, petty criminal, etc. \n\n \nMajor themes in  most descriptions of street children include homelessness, separation \nfrom family, and being out of school, but often those children designated as street children do \nnot possess all of these traits. A further set of characteristics includes poverty and the need to \nwork. These in turn are linked to vulnerability to exploitation and risk of coming into conflict with \nthe law. \n \n\nThe  circumstances  and  experiences  of  street  children  overlap  with  several  other \ncategories of children, such as trafficked children, migrant children, and working children. There \nalso  is  overlap  with  a  range  of  problems  and  difficulties  confronting  many  children,  including \nendemic  poverty,  domestic  and/or  sexual  abuse  and  other  violence,  hazardous  working \nconditions, exploitative labor, substance abuse, conflict with the law and juvenile justice, and the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic.  \n \n\nSome street children are highly visible, and the subject of public concern because they \nare \u201cout of place.\u201d Some see such children as victims; others see them more as small criminals. \nOften, we choose not to see them at all. And then there are the \u201cinvisible\u201d street children, those \nkept and controlled as underage sex workers or as laborers in dangerous jobs or in unhealthy \nworking conditions.  \n\n \nProcesses  of  placing  children  in  categories  run  counter  not  only  to  development  of \nholistic  practice  interventions,  but  also  to  the  realization  of  children\u2019s  rights,  which,  given  the \nalmost universal ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), \nprovides the main international standard for work with children. This requires addressing street \nchildren\u2019s lives in context. The first context is connected with children\u2019s identity, (proscribed or \nrealized)  as  citizens  and  inhabitants  of  a  particular  State.  Each  State  offers  different \nopportunities and dangers for life on the street. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  difficulties  in  categorizing  children,  and  the  wide  range  of  potential \nresponses and starting points, there is enormous diversity within the countries of Asia and the \nPacific.  The  region  has  varied  economies  and  political  systems  that  provide  very  different \ncontexts for the reasons why children come to the streets, the problems they face on the street, \ntheir prospects for moving on from the street, and a wide range of government as well as civil \nsociety responses and interventions available to street children. \n\n \nSome countries are linked through experiences, for example of colonization or economic \nmodels.  Other  connections  stem  from  the  migration  and  trafficking  of children, many of whom \nare,  or  become,  street  children.  The  connections  through  children  provide  a  set  of  different \n\n\fii \n\n \n\ninternational linkages, some of which follow established conventional trade, but others are part \nof informal, criminal syndication. \n \n\nWhile there are common features in good practice to address problems faced by street \nchildren, the characteristics of these responses generally are linked to interventions designed to \naddress other issues. For example, prevention initiatives need to cover the range of situations \nthat  place  children  at  risk,  including  not  only  the  transition  to  street  life,  but  also  in  relation  to \nhuman  trafficking,  child  sexual  exploitation,  hazardous  and  exploitative  labor,  HIVAIDS,  drugs \nand other substance abuse, peer pressure, criminal behavior, and so on. \n\n \nOne  important  question  in  looking  at  the  lives  and  experiences  of  street  children  is \nlooking  also  to  their  future.  What  does  an  uneasy  survival  on  the  street  now,  or  in  other \noccupations,  bode  for  children\u2019s  development  and  future  lives?  Some  are  described  as \n\u201cpermanent  street  children,\u201d  indicative  of  the  growing  perception  that  street  children  are  a \npermanent  feature  of  the  urban  landscape  throughout  much  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  Many \nchildren  on  the  street  are  controlled  by  criminal  gangs,  and  apparently  even  linked  to  larger \ncriminal syndicates (such as those involved in widespread international trafficking). If they grow \nup  retained  in  a  controlled  criminalized  environment,  what  other  options  can  exist  for  them? \nHow can street children avoid the stigma associated with perceptions of them as deviant? How \ncan they have a choice? \n \n\nSince the almost universal ratification of the 1989 CRC, emphasis has been given to its \neffective  implementation  including  the  development  of  a  \u201crights-based\u201d approach as an overall \nframework  for  addressing  the  circumstances  and  lives  of  all  children.  The  CRC  is  especially \nuseful  in  addressing  the  needs  of  the  world\u2019s  most  vulnerable  children,  including  those  in \n\u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d whose rights are particularly unfulfilled. Other international instruments \nalso  apply  to  children,  such  as  conventions  against  torture  and  discrimination  and,  particularly \nfor  street  children,  the  International  Labour  Organization  Convention  on  the  Worst  Forms  of \nChild Labour.  \n \n\nIn  many  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  provision  for  street  children  has  been \ndeveloped  mostly  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  development  of  frameworks \nfor child-rights programming recognizes that governments have responsibilities as duty bearers \ntoward  the  realization  of  rights  for  children,  and  must  provide  at  least  minimum  legal  and \nregulatory  frameworks.  Governments  also  must  ensure  that  services  exist  and  are  properly \nimplemented. \n \n\nPlaces  and  methods  of  work  include  the  active  participation  of  children,  working  with \nthem  to  begin  to  address  key  protection  issues.  Beginning  with  where  children  are  living,  it  is \nthen possible to look at issues of prevention, street work, and children moving on from the street \nto situations that place them at increased risk. While the focus of much work with street children \nhas  been  on  provision  of  shelters  or  temporary  accommodation,  education,  and  training, \nincreased  attention  now  is  being  given  to  prevention  work.  There  is  a  great  need  for \ncoordination of services in order to seek out and fill gaps in the provision of services directed to \nstreet children, and for standards to be developed, implemented, and monitored.  \n\n \nIt is important that practice is reflective, that is it is embedded in local circumstances of \nchildren\u2019s lives and issues, evaluates work, is dynamic, and responds to changing environment \nand changing needs. Such practice is essentially or implicitly rights-based, and holistic (that is, \nlooking to the whole child, not a particular aspect of a child\u2019s life). This is a foundation on which \nprojects concerned with prevention, protection, street activities, and moving children on from the \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nstreet can begin. In addition, such practice works to standards, ensures staff are trained, and \nworks  in  partnership  with  others.  It  is  necessary  to  recognize  that  isolated,  charity  based \napproaches  will  not  adequately  address  the  issues  of  street  children\u2013or  the  problems \nconfronting children \u201cat the margins.\u201d \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n1. \nThis report  is  a  study  commissioned  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  best \npractice  concerning  street  children  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  and  potential  areas  of  strategic \nintervention for ADB. In May 2001, an ADB-Nongovernment Organization (NGO) Roundtable on \nStreet Children was held with a number of Philippines-based NGOs. A subsequent internal ADB \nmeeting in June 2001 recommended greater involvement by ADB in street children issues within \nthe  context  of  it's  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy, and related \npolicies  and  development  priorities.  The  report  is  based  on  a  literature  survey  and  the \nexperience of the author in the region. \n \nHalf of the world\u2019s population lives in the Asia-Pacific region; 30% of them live in poverty, \n2. \nand  40%  are  children  and  young  people  (ADB  2001).  The  region  has  countries  with  vastly \ndifferent  sizes,  government  structures,  and  economies,  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), the most populous country in the world with more than 1.2 billion people, to tiny Pacific \nnations with populations of only a few thousands, such as Niue (2,000), and Palau (20,000). \n \n3. \nStreet children are not usually counted, nor subject to census, so their numbers are not \nknown. Different organizations produce local estimates; even conservative figures indicate that \nthere are millions of street children in the region. The problems experienced by street children \ninclude homelessness, exploitation, the worst forms of labor, abuse, health difficulties, coercion \nand  control  by  adult  gangs,  conflict  with  the  law,  lack  of  education,  and  lack  of  identification \npapers.  Their  experiences  overlap  with  other  categories  of  children,  such  as  those  who  are \ntrafficked and those involved in exploitative work, which increases the problems of counting their \nnumbers.  \n \n4. \nThe  region\u2019s  geographic  diversity  alone  begins  to  indicate  the  variety  of  contexts  in \nwhich street children live. The range of circumstances in which children live is exacerbated by \nthe  different  responses  to  street  children  by  governments  and  NGOs  in  different  States.  In \naddition,  there  is  an  even  larger  range  of  problems  and  issues  associated  with  children  who \nspend a part of their lives on the street, working, in transit to other places, and who may or may \nnot be permanently separated from parents, family or other adults. \n \n5. \nThis paper attempts only an overview of the issues connected with street children, and \nintervention practices in the region. Section II takes up the issue of definition, and problems of \npoverty,  homelessness,  and  change.  Section  III  explores  the  variety  of  childhoods  of  street \nchildren, and the causes and consequences of their moving onto the street. A brief overview of \nstreet  children  in  the  region  is  provided  in  Section  IV.  The  outline  follows  a  broad-based \ngeographical  breakdown  of  countries  in  an  attempt  to  take  account  of  the  range  of  polities, \neconomies, histories, and cultures across the region. Sections V and VI examine the scale and \nrequirements of interventions in the lives of street children in the region. These sections outline \nframeworks  and  principles  for  good  practice,  and  also  examine  places  and  methods  of \nimplementation.  In  Section  VII,  the  kinds  of  interventions  that  make  up  good  practice  are \ndescribed  and  examples  from  around  the  region  are  given,  including  activities  developed  by \nstreet  children  themselves.  Finally,  the  roles  of  government  and  responses  of  nongovernment \norganizations are outlined in Section VIII, in particular the need for coordination and regulation \nof services to a common set of standards linked to the overall framework of the United Nations \nConvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and principles of child rights programming. \n \n \n\n\f 2\n\n \n\nII. \n\nWHO ARE STREET CHILDREN? \n\nA. \n\nThe Problem of Definition \n\n6. \nAlthough the term  street children  passed  into  common  use  in  the  1990s,  the  term  was \nused  in  reference  to  urban  centers  in  Europe  as  early  as  the  19th  century.  The  meaning  and \ndefinition  of  street  children  is  contested  among  academics,  policymakers,  practitioners, \npoliticians,  and  the  general  public.  Individuals  and  groups  have  their  own  preferred  definition. \nThese different definitions are important for several reasons. For policymakers and practitioners, \nthe  meanings  given  to  street  children  define  their  response  in  terms  of  the  law,  its \nimplementation,  and  services  provided.  The  perceptions  of  street  children  held  by  the  general \npublic  may  or  may  not  influence  the  nature  of  official  policy  and  professional  welfare \ninterventions. But the attitude of the public is important for the nature and success of responses. \nPopular  explanations  of  the  causes  of  children  coming  onto  the  street\u2014for instance, as either \nvictims  or  criminals\u2014and  public  reactions  to  individual  children  may  legitimize  some  actions \ntaken by authorities, such as the practice in some countries of relocating or incarcerating street \nchildren.  \n \n7. \nThe children who are visible on the street, begging, and who may be popularly perceived \nas  typical  street  children,  are  often  imagined  to  be  homeless,  desolate,  and  separated  from \nparents (or imagined to be devious, hardened little criminals). However, their circumstances are \ngenerally far more complex. Street children may or may not be living with parents and they may \nor may not be living with or supervised by adults. They may or may not return to some sort of \nhome  or  shelter  most  nights.  Many  are  working,  often  in  dangerous  or  exploitative  situations. \nThey may be in conflict with the law. Street children constitute a dynamic population, shifting as \nopportunities  arise,  moving  in  and  out  of  other  designated  categories  of  children.  They  may \nhave  been  trafficked  and  escaped  to  the  street,  but  then  fallen  prey  to  even  worse \ncircumstances.  They  may  have  run  away  from  violence  and  abuse  within  the  family,  begun \nliving  on  the  street,  and  then  be  trafficked,  or  drawn  into  commercial  sex  work.  They  may  be \neconomic migrants. The permutations and combinations are numerous and depend on context.  \n \nAlthough street children are primarily associated with backgrounds of family poverty, it is \n8. \nto  be  emphasized  that  all  children\u2014whatever  nationality,  family  situation,  or  socioeconomic \nclass\u2014potentially  are  vulnerable.  Domestic  violence  and  abuse  is  not  limited  to  poor  families, \nwhile  school-related  pressures   may  be  more  prevalent  among  children  from  better-off families \nwith higher expectations. This phenomenon is seen mostly in more developed countries of the \nregion, such as Japan and Singapore, where school pressures contribute to a high adolescent \nsuicide rate, but also in some Pacific countries (such as Samoa and Tonga) and not related to \nschool pressures. \n \n9. \nThe  difficulties  of  definition  lead  to  debates  over  numbers.  For  example,  a  narrow \ndefinition of street children in Mongolia as being those  who have no contact with family and live \nunderground,  arguably  produces  a  figure  of  a  few  hundred  children  at  most.  Popular \nperceptions,  however,  extend  the  definition  to  include  children  who  are  homeless,  with  or \nwithout  family,  and  who  work  on  the  street,  resulting  in  a  far  higher  figure,  well  into  the \nthousands,  which  represents  a  major  problem  given  Mongolia\u2019s  small  and  highly  urbanized \npopulation.  \n \n10. \nThe  problem  of  applying  a  standard  definition  across  the  vast  Asia-Pacific  region  is \nexacerbated  in  two  ways.  First,  there  is  the  difficulty  of  making  equivalencies  across  different \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ncountries and cultures. Second, the overlapping categories currently in use also include children \nwho have had experiences in common with street children, who may have been street children \nor who may become street children. A broader perspective is necessary to make the term more \nmeaningful, especially when considering the effectiveness of particular interventions.  \n  \nB. \n\nHomeless, Out Of School, Out Of Place  \n\n11. \nThe term street children is in general use across countries with different polities, income \nlevels, economic and social systems, and cultures. There is a tendency to resist the use of the \nterm  in  developed  countries,  and  replace  it  with,  for  example,  \u201crunaways\u201d  (children  who  have \nrun  away,  or  left  home  or  residential  care)  or  simply  homeless  young  people.  The  implicit \ndifference seems to be based on economies and polities, in that children are not expected to be \nable  to  find  work,  nor  to  be  homeless  under  the  age  of  16  years  in  developed  countries, \nbecause of legislative checks and welfare and police systems. But, this means that children who \nare separated from adult care, have to beg or become involved in informal or criminal activities \nand  economies  (often  at  risk  of  becoming  invisible  to  the  public)  in  order  to  survive,  which \nstigmatizes  them  further.  In  Australia,  a  Royal  Commission  in  the  early  1990s  reported  some \n20,000  homeless  children  and  young  people  (increasing  to  26,000  in  2001,  according  to \nAustralia\u2019s  national  census).  Yet,  children  who  are  separated  from  adult  care  (including  family \nand residential care) and are homeless\u2014on the street\u2014in developed countries face many of the \nsame problems as those confronted by street children in other parts of the world. \n\n  \n12. \nUnderlying  the  use  of  the  term  is  a  sense  of  children  being  out  of  place  in  a  particular \ncontext; and that context depends upon local ideas of childhood and expectations of children\u2019s \ndevelopment  and  behavior  in  particular.  An  ideal  or  stated  aim  in  many  countries  may  be  for \nchildren  to  live  with  parents  and  attend  school,  while  the  reality  may  be  very  different.  The \nparticular  situations  of  street  children  result  in  their  not  easily  being  covered  by  the  rights \ndefined  by  the  CRC  (see  Box  II.1).  Street  children  generally  do  not  attend  school  but  they  do \nwork.  They  may  not  be  registered  or  have  official  identity,  they  may  not  receive  any  public \neducation or health care, they may be harassed by police, have no opportunity for recreation  or \nplay, and certainly are not consulted in matters that affect their daily lives.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 4\n\nBox II.1: The Rights of the Child \n\nGeneral measures \nDefinition of a child \nGeneral  principles \nCivil rights and freedoms \nFamily environment and alternative care \nBasic health and welfare \nEducation, leisure, and cultural activities \nSpecial protection measures \nMonitoring  \n\n \nThe  League  of  Nations  pronounced  a  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  in  1923.  The  Universal \nDeclaration  of  Human Rights in 1948 implicitly includes children, but a second declaration of the Rights of \nthe  Child  was  made  by  the  UN  General  Assembly  in  1959.  Because  children  require  additional  attention \nand  protection,  a  separate  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  was  seen  as  necessary.  The  United \nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was adopted in 1989 and has since been ratified by \nnearly every State in the world (with the exception only of Somalia and the United States).  \n \nThe 54 articles of the CRC are divided into the following components: \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n \nThe  Convention  has  two  general  principles  that  underpin  the  whole:  non-discrimination  and  the  best \ninterests  of  the  child.  Children\u2019s  rights  under  the  Convention  are  often  cursorily  discussed  in  terms  of \nrights  to  survival  and  development,  rights  to  protection,  and  rights  to  participation.  These  elements, \nhowever, are intertwined, and the Convention must be considered in its entirety, along with other human \nrights  instruments,  in  developing  rights-based  approaches  to  practice,  and  in  seeking  international \nstandards against which to measure children\u2019s lives and circumstances.  \n \nCountries  that  have  ratified  the  CRC  are  required  to  subject  periodic  reports  to  the  United  Nations \nCommittee  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  (UNCRC)  to  indicate  their  progress  in  realizing  child  rights.  In \naddition  to  national  (governmental)  reports,  civil  society  organizations  are  encouraged  to  submit \nindependent reports to the UNCRC. \n \nFor many organizations seeking to protect and realize children\u2019s rights, the principles and practice of child \nrights programming aim to use all appropriate international conventions, and not only the CRC. \n \nIn  addition  to  the  CRC,  children  are  also  implicitly  and  explicitly  given  rights  under  other  UN  and \ninternational  instruments.  These  instruments  include  the  Convention  against  Torture  and  Other  Cruel, \nInhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment,  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of \nDiscrimination against Women, the Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency, and others.  \n \nThe  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  Convention  No.  182  and  Recommendation  190  Concerning \nthe  Prohibition  and  Immediate  Action  for  the  Elimination  of  the  Worst  Forms  of  Child  Labor,  have \nparticular  relevance  for  many  street  children.  The  Convention  defines  the  worst  forms  of  child  labor  and \nimplementation processes for ratifying governments.  \n \nThe definitions of the worst forms of child labor include  \n \n ?  \n\nall  forms  of  slavery  or  similar  practices,  such  as  debt  bondage,  trafficking,  or  compulsory \nrecruitment of children for use in armed conflict; \nthe use of children for prostitution and pornography; \nthe use of children for illicit activities, such as the production and trafficking of drugs; and \nall work which is likely to endanger the health, safety or morals of children. \n\n ?  \n ?  \n ?  \n \nAs of the end of 2002, the ILO Convention had been ratified by 134 countries. \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n5\n\nStreet  children\u2019s  lives  are  even  more  complex  than  this  set  of  negative  connotations \n13. \nwould suggest. Many street children display a wide range of skills, competence, knowledge, and \nresilience  in  dealing  with  everyday  life.  In  addition,  they  may  be  better  nourished  than  their \npeers who live in poverty in rural areas (see, for example, Baker 1996 on Nepal). This offers a \nreason why some children move from their homes into conditions that might be an improvement \nonly in some respects. Many children have become used to and may prefer their independent \nlives on the street to their lives at home (particularly in cases of abuse) or in institutions or foster \ncare.  However,  in  considering  these  complexities,  the  question  of  \u201cbest  interests  of  the  child\u201d \nand  a  development  perspective  need  to  be  taken  into  account.  In  some  places,  for  some \nchildren,  the  street  may  be  better  than  the  local  institutional  care,  but  this  does  not  mean  that \neither is desirable; alternative or improved care is necessary in such cases. \n \nThe  idea  of  street  children  as  children  \u201cout  of  place\u201d  gives  rise  to  a  broad  spectrum of \n14. \npotential meanings and associations that better express the vulnerable circumstances of street \nchildren  and  the  risks  to  which  they  are  exposed.  The  breadth  of  the  issue  then  becomes \napparent, and suggests why more specific definitions have been  attempted. At the root of the \ndefinitional problem is a desire to make an intervention, the aim of which may vary on the part of \norganizations, projects or individuals, from \u201csaving\u201d children, to realizing children\u2019s rights, or to a \nmore punitive attempt to put children back \u201cin place.\u201d \n \nThe spectrum of meanings is bound up with cultural connotations of what the \u201cplace\u201d of \n15. \nchildren should be. The CRC is clear that children should be with their family, unless it is in their \nbest  interests  to  be  elsewhere.  Street  children  \u201cout  of  place,\u201d  may  be  out  of  the  family.  Their \nfamily members may have separated themselves from the children, or caused the separation. \nThe children may have been abandoned (as babies or older children), sold, been trafficked with \nor without their parents\u2019 collusion, or been sent away to work. Children\u2019s vulnerability to being \ntrafficked may be because of poverty or violence or abuse in the home. Children may have left \ntheir family of their own accord. Again, this might be because of violence at home (or at school), \nsexual abuse, or abject poverty. Children may become economic migrants in their own right, in \nwhich  case  they  may  send  money  earned  back  home.  This  sample  range  of  issues  already \nincludes  what  are  often  seen  as  separate  categories  of  children,  such  as  trafficked  children, \nmigrant children, abandoned children, separated children, unaccompanied children, as well as \nchildren subject to domestic violence or physical or sexual abuse.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Work: Vulnerability and Risk \n\nThe processes of children\u2019s transition to street work and the circumstances in which they \n16. \nfind  themselves  afterwards,  provide  additional  categories  and  problems.  As  noted  earlier, \npoverty is often a key issue, in that children may be sent out by the family to work as a necessity \nfor  family  survival.  Families  living  in  rural  areas  may  send  their  children  to  the  city  to  work, \nparticularly  in  situations  where  problems  of  access  to  land  or  environmental  degradation \ncompromise family livelihoods. Families as a whole may have migrated to urban areas with their \nchildren,  or  have  lived  in  the  city  for  some  time  and  send  children  out  to  work  as  part  of  a \nstrategy for family survival. Families may have long depended on the work of children, or may \nhave  fallen  on  hard  times  due  to  unemployment,  illness  or  death  in  the  family,  or  changing \nwelfare economies. Children may leave homes in rural areas as migrants in their own right. All \nof these children are confronted with the need to work for a living, and many end up working in \nexploitative  and  hazardous  jobs.  Children  are  trafficked  mostly  for  exploitative  purposes, \nalthough  children  sold  for  (domestic  and  foreign)  family  adoption  might  also  come  under  the \ncategory of \u201ctrafficked children\u201d\u2014the issues here go  beyond exploitation because children may \nbe well treated, and instead revolve around ethics, identity, and rights. In trafficking, and in the \n\n\f 6\n\nmigration and movement of children in general, the issues of the worst forms of child labor come \nto the fore, including commercial sexual work and other forms of sexual exploitation.  \n \n17. \nFor various reasons street children may be drawn into conflict with the law. Children who \nexperience  difficulty  in  finding  work,  or  who  are  picked  up  by  adults  when  they  first arrive in \ncities, are particularly vulnerable. Some children are trafficked for use in illegal activities, such \nas carrying drugs, petty thievery, street crime, or commercial sex work. Many street children are \nassociated in the public mind with crime and, when they become involved with police, are drawn \ninto  inadequate  (and  usually  adult,  rather  than  juvenile)  justice  systems;  they  are  often \nincarcerated, where they are vulnerable to life-threatening risks. Through exploitation, children \nare also at risk of drug or other substance abuse as well as HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS affects children \nin different ways, including, in 2002, as many as 13.4 million children globally under the age of \n15 who have lost one or both parents to the disease (UNICEF 2002). In countries most seriously \naffected  by  the  HIV/AIDS  pandemic  (e.g.,  subSaharan  Africa),  extended  families  or  other \ncommunal \u201csafety nets\u201d are breaking down, being overtaxed or over-extended. This in turn has \nled to an increase in child-headed households but has also left many other \u201cHIV/AIDS orphans\u201d \ntraumatized, stigmatized, and left to fend for themselves.1 \n \nD. \n\nChildren and Childhood \n\nThe  definition  of  a  child  varies  in  laws,  traditions,  and  customs  across  States  and \n18. \ncultures  with  different  standards  or  approaches  in  many  countries  of  the  region.  Legislation \noften  complicates  definitions,  for  example  by  different  ages  of  criminal  responsibility  (often  for \ndifferent acts), by regulating the ages for different kinds of work, and by regulating the age for \nmarriage.  \n \n19. \nIn  India,  the  census  defines  a  person  under  the  age  of  14  years  as  a  child,  but  social \nscientists  there  include  females  aged  15\u201319  in  the  category  \u201cgirl  children.\u201d  Laws  in  India  from \n1860 onward regulate children working in different occupations, joining the army, and marrying \n(Government of India 1994). In the PRC, the law provides for persons of 18 years and over to \nbe  adults,  but  in  certain  cases,  16\u201317-year  olds  who  work  have  \u201cfull  civil  capacity,\u201d  while \nchildren  under  10  years  have  no  civil  capacity  and  must  have  representatives.  The  marriage \nage  in  the  PRC  is  higher  than  in  India:  22  years  for  \u201cboys\u201d  and  20  years  for  \u201cgirls.\u201d  There  are \nalso variations in work ages (PRC 1998).  \n \n20. \nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child includes a standard international definition of \na child. This denotes children as humans under the age of 18 years, to whom all human rights \nconventions  apply,  taking  into  account  the  special  circumstances  regarding  age,  but \nemphasizing their humanity and rights, including respect for their person, privacy, and identity. \nThe ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor follows the CRC: \u201cA child includes \nanyone under the age of 18, with no exception.\u201d \n \n21. \nThe problems of definition are not limited to identifying the particular locations of street \nchildren, which necessarily include places other than the street, given that children may spend \n\n                                                 \n1   Stephen Lewis, the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, recently presented a report on the crisis \nin  the  Southern  African  Countries  of  Lesotho,  Zimbabwe,  Malawi,  and  Zambia.  Mr.  Lewis  reports  that  recent \ndrought in southern Africa has exacerbated the crisis, with millions of people dying. Lewis calls the lack of effort \nto help \u201ca crime against humanity.\u201d The report says that what is lacking in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa is \nmoney. And that makes it a form of \u201cmass murder by complacency.\u201d As a result of the pandemic, the number of \nHIV/AIDS  orphans  living  on  the  street  is  growing.  And  they  are  targets  of  sexual  abuse,  thus  feeding  the \npandemic. The same situation could well face several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. CBC News, 8 January \n2003: \u201cLewis calls African AIDS crisis \u2018mass murder by complacency.\u2019\" \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n7\n\ntime  at  home,  in  slums,  in  back  alleys,  or  in  brothels.  There  is  also  the  assumption  that \n\u201cchildren\u201d is a homogenous category (see James and Prout 1990). Street children, as children, \ncomprise  a  range  of  ages,  (dis)abilities,  ethnicities,  classes,  and  personal  backgrounds  and \ncircumstances. Individual characteristics also must be set in the context of particular countries, \ncultures,  and  locations,  as  well  as  risks,  opportunities,  social  systems,  access  to  service \nprovision, etc.  \n \n22. \nChildren  are  not  passive  vessels,  but  have  an  effect  on  and  influence  other  people  in \ntheir  surroundings\u2014they  are  \u201csocial  actors\u201d  (James  and  Prout  1990).  The  research  work  and \nfindings  that  have  developed  into  what  some  call  a  \u201cnew  sociological  paradigm  on  childhood,\u201d \nprovide  reinforcement  for  the  rights-based  principles  laid  out  in  the  CRC.  The  lack  of \nhomogeneity  within  childhood  emphasizes  the  need  for  nondiscriminatory  and  inclusive \napproaches  in  programming.  The  notion  of  children  as  \u201csocial  actors\u201d  demonstrates  how \nchildren  influence  family  relationships  from  birth,  as  well  as  how  they  gradually  come  to  make \ndecisions  and  take  action  in  their  own  right.  This  notion,  now  widely  accepted,  underpins \nchildren\u2019s  right  to  participation.  The  notion  further  emphasizes  children\u2019s  competence  in  this \narea, well illustrated by the skills and daily decision making of street children. Overall, research \nand work in the area of childhood over the past 15 years have exposed the problems created by \nthe use of narrow categories to encompass children\u2019s lives. The term \u201cstreet children\u201d provides \na significant example in this debate. \n \nE. \n\nAlternative Terms or Definitions \n\nterms  also  express \n\n23. \nAttempts  have  been  made  at  alternate  terms  or  definitions,  with  researchers  and \nprojects often identifying a range of children perceived to fall within the category \u201cstreet children\u201d \nin  any  particular  context.  This  usually  has  resulted  in  the  use  of  key  subcategories.  Principal \ndistinctions  are  made  between  those  children  who  are  separated  from  family,  who  are \nhomeless, or for whom the street is a place for living \u201c24/7\u201d (24 hours a day, 7 days a week), \nand those who are not separated from their families or caregivers and who retain some contact \nwith  family  or  relatives.  However,  the  complexities  of  even  such  a  simple  distinction  rapidly \nemerge. Although children are separated from family it does not mean they are alone. They may \nbe  living  in  groups  or  gangs,  they  may  be  controlled  or  exploited  by  adults  (or  older  children, \nsuch as the bong tom or \u201cbig brother\u201d gangs in Cambodia), or live with adults who are not family \nmembers.  Other \nthis  divide,  such  as  \u201cseparated  children\u201d  and \n\u201cunaccompanied children,\u201d but these terms are used mostly in reference to such circumstances \nas natural or human-made disasters, civil conflict or war, or the movement of refugees.  \n \n24. \nFor example, typologies of street children adopted in Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam and \ndifferent typologies used in projects in Mongolia (see Box II.2) continue to be used in different \nprojects years after their introduction, although some analysts have expressed concern that they \nno  longer  apply  to  country  circumstances.  And  because  the  question  of  definition  is  linked  to \naspects  of  service  provision,  definitional  issues  continue  to  be  raised  (although,  it  should  be \nnoted,  with  minimal  impact  on  the  ever-increasing  number  of  street  children  throughout  the \nAsia-Pacific region).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 8\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nBox II.2: Definitions or Categorizations of Street Children  \n\n \nIn  1994,  the  National  Children\u2019s  Committee  in  Mongolia  organized  a  national  conference  on  street \nchildren,  involving  representatives  from  Parliament,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Education,  Juvenile \nPolice  Department,  Juvenile  Prison,  the  Aimag  Centers  for  Children,  as  well  as  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  Save  the  Children,  United  Kingdom  (UK).  The  conference  adopted  three \ncategories of street children: \n \n ? children who work on the streets during the day, but who maintain links with the family and who usually \n\n ?  children  who  have  some  contact  with  their  families,  but  who  spend  most  of  their  time on the streets, \n\nreturn to their homes in the evening;  \n\nespecially during warm seasons; and \n\n ? children who have lost contact with their families and live permanently on the street.  \n \nAccounts of street children in Mongolia, and especially by the external press, generally focus on children \nin  the  last  category.  These  are  the  children  who,  because  of  Mongolia\u2019s  harsh  climate,  live  or  sleep \nunderground,  in  tunnels  and  access  points  to  urban  heating  systems  (\u201cmanholes\u201d),  or  in  the  entrances \nand  basements  of  apartment  buildings  or  other  shelters. The health of such children is obviously at risk, \ngiven  the  lack  of  sanitation  and  access  to  water,  as  well  as  generally  poor  diets.  Reports  indicate  that \n\u201cThere  is  a  high  risk  of  contracting  sexually  transmitted  diseases\u201d  or  \u201cthe  children  survive  through \nmarginal and illegal activities, stealing, begging, prostitution and doing odd jobs, and face violence, abuse \nand  aggression  from  the  police,  from  drunks\u201d  and  also  from  their  peers.  The  general  public  in  Mongolia, \nhowever,  would  include  all  three  categories as \u201cstreet children.\u201d (Save the Children, UK 2002; West and \nTungalag 2002) \n \nIn  Viet  Nam  a  notion  of  \u201creal  street  children\u201d  pervades  both  academic  and  informal  definitions  or \ncategorizations.  In  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  the  work  of  Tim  Bond  in  the  early  1990s,  and  the  tripartite \ncategorization  of  street  children  that  he  devised,  had  enormous  and  lasting  influence.  The  classification \nscheme is as follows:  \n \n ? Category A: children who have left home and family, or have no home or family, and who sleep on the \n\nstreet; \n\n ? Category B: children who sleep on the street with their family or guardian; and \n ? Category C: children who have a family or guardian and (generally) sleep at home. \n \nThese  categories  appear  to  have  influenced  most  subsequent  work  in  Viet  Nam,  including  service \nprovision, which often focuses on or otherwise targets one particular category of children.  \n \nCommonly,  the  children  in  category  A  are  seen  as  \u201creal\u201d  street  children,  reinforcing  popular  notions  of \nstreet  children  as  victims  \u201crather  than  as  competent  social  actors,  vulnerable  but  not  passive.\u201d  (West \n2000b) \n \nIn Uzbekistan, four different categorizations are employed:  \n \n ? straightforward orphans who have never been in the custody of the State; \n ? residents of children\u2019s homes who only return to such shelters to sleep; \n ? children living with parents or close relatives, but who often lead antisocial lifestyles; \n ? children with relatives, but who have run away from home because of poverty or cruel treatment (from \nvillages  or  towns  in  the  regions)  and  also  children  who  have  escaped  from  children\u2019s  homes  (Tahlil \n2002:15). \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n9\n\n \n25. \nFurthermore, although definitions or  categories  are  adopted,  they  may  not  be  used.  In \nthe PRC, for example, the official definition of a street child is \u201ca person under 18 who has left \nhis/her  family  or  guardian  and  lives  a  vagabond  life  for  more  than  24  hours  without  reliable \nsafeguard  for  basic  survival  with  the  result  of  falling  into  dire  straits\u201d  (Lauter  1998).  There  are \nnow over 100 street children protection centers in the PRC, but many take custody of children \nwho do not strictly fall within the definition, such as child flower sellers who are not necessarily \nseparated from a parent or guardian. \n \nF. \n\nChanges for Children \n\n26. \nChange  is  inherent  in  the  lives  of  street  children.  It  is  essential  that  the  street  children \npopulation be seen as dynamic rather than static. As demonstrated above, street children do not \nconsist  of  a  homogeneous  group;  they  come  onto  the  street  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  and  in \nresponse to varied and changing social conditions, and face different sets of circumstances. If \nthey survive to become youths or young adults, they necessarily stop being classified as street \nchildren. Yet the numbers of street children generally do not decrease. The children who grow \nup are replaced by others, which suggests that in addition to circumstances that bring children \nto  the  streets,  there  also  are  formal  and  informal  social  structures  and  enterprises  that  need \nchildren, for example as cheap or compliant labor. Also, either because of necessity or lack of \nother opportunities, children also need the jobs and escape routes provided by life on the street. \nStreet children themselves form relationships, or may have babies\u2014children born on the street \nto children.  \n \nOther  attempts  at  generic  terms  have  included  \u201cstreet  and  working  children\u201d  and \n27. \n\u201cchildren in street situations.\u201d Such terms suggest the variety and problems of vulnerability and \nrisk of exploitation. While the problem should not be perceived as the children themselves but \nrather the situations in which they find themselves, such replacement terms tend to focus on the \ncircumstances of children now, with insufficient attention to the reasons or causes that brought \nthem  to  the  street  in  the  first  place,  including  the  trafficking  or  sale  of  children.  The  notion  of \n\u201cfloating  children\u201d\u2014which  is  the  literal  meaning  of  \u201cstreet  children\u201d  in  some  countries\u2014is both \ndescriptive  and  useful.  But  the  phrase  \u201cfloating  children\u201d  belies  the  coercion  experienced  by \nmany  children,  or  the  exceptionally  difficult  circumstances  in  which  they  find  themselves, \nincluding  dangerous  or  exploitative  working  situations.  What  emerges,  then,  is  a  set  of  issues \nassociated  with  the  term  street  children, including abandonment, migration, trafficking, abuse, \nexploitation,  HIV/AIDS,  becoming  orphans,  conflict  with  the  law,  and  lack  of  access  to \neducation, health, recreation or other services and opportunities that should be the right of every \nchild. The contextualization of this range of issues is key to determining appropriate responses \nto the ever-growing number of children on the streets of urban centers throughout the region.  \n\n \nStreet Children \n\nG. \n\n28. \nAs  outlined  above,  street  children  is  not  a  functional  term  in  itself,  because  it  is \nimpossible  to  define  clearly.  Even  if  the  category  is  restricted  to  homeless  children  separated \nfrom  family,  it  still  opens  up  difficulties  in  defining  \u201chomelessness\u201d  or  \u201cseparation\u201d  from  family. \nTo be homeless might include staying in insecure accommodation with others; separation from \nfamily might mean physical separation while maintaining familial contact and possibly remitting \nmoney.  Despite  such  shortcomings,  the  categorization  or  term  street  children  remains  in \neveryday use by the public, the media, and professionals and project staff who deal with such \nchildren (or \u201cstreet kids\u201d). \n \n\n\f 10\n\nIn this paper  street  children  is  used  as  shorthand  for  children  who  might  transit  to  the \n29. \nstreet,  children  on  the  street,  or  children  who  previously  lived  on  the  street,  with  the  street \nsuggesting a variety of occupations, including beggar, rubbish picker, shoeshine boy or flower \nseller, sweat shop worker, sex worker, petty criminal, etc. For many of these children, the street \nitself  is  but  an  environment  of  their  survival,  including  the  process  of  growing  up,  developing, \nand hopefully moving on.  \n \n30.  More  important  than  definition  is  gaining  a  better  understanding  of  the  situations  faced \nand  problems  experienced  by  these  children:  those  who  are  \u201cout  of  place\u201d\u2014those living and \nworking on the streets, often without any contact with family. The underlying issue, then, is the \nthousands,  if  not  millions  of  children  who  are  denied  their  basic  rights  and  who  are  at  risk  of \ndamaged childhoods, such as through exploitation and abuse. Another key concern is the need \nto  reach  out  to  those  children  who  are  at  risk  on  the  street,  but  who  cannot  be  realistically \nhelped through service delivery or other interventions, including both child protection and child \nparticipation.  \n \nA  framework  for  intervention  approaches  may  be  drawn  from  the  CRC  as  the \n31. \ninternational standard for children\u2019s lives. To make use of the CRC, some understanding of the \nissues and experiences of street children is necessary. A general overview of street children\u2019s \nissues is given below, followed by a short regional survey.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nAT THE MARGINS?DAILY LIFE, ISSUES,  AND CAUSES \n\nAn  important  factor  in  the  lives  of  many  street  children,  as  well  as  in  designing \n32. \nappropriate or effective intervention measures, is the increasing interconnectedness of various \nproblems  across  the  region.  Intercountry  trafficking  (of  humans  and  drugs),  civil  conflict,  the \nmovement of refugees, and economic or other migration are changing the circumstances, lives, \nand  futures  of  street  children.  Processes  of  preventative  interventions  and  resettlement  and \nreintegration are needed that have some similarities for children in a variety of circumstances\u2014\nthe commonality is vulnerability and risk.  \n \nA. \n\nDaily Life \n\n33. \nStreet children are most evident in large cities, where they work in occupations that bring \nthem  into  contact  with  the  public,  both  the  local  population  and  foreign  tourists.  The  range  of \nwork  includes  begging,  collecting  rubbish  for  recycling,  scavenging  rubbish  dumps,  shoe-\nshining, flower or magazine and newspaper sales, prostitution, or the less visible petty theft. In \nsome of these occupations children work alone, although they frequently are under the control \nof adults, older street children, or gangs, and with or without knowledge of their parents (if they \nindeed remain in contact with their families). Many working children may be under coercion to \ndeliver  a  certain  amount  of  money  each  day.  The  adults  in  control  of  these  children  generally \nare careful not to be visible to the public. \n \nChildren do work openly with some adults in some places, for example with their families \n34. \nin food processing and selling, or as market porters. Solitary working makes children especially \nvulnerable  to  exploitation  by  adults,  including  kidnapping  and  trafficking,  or  being  drawn  or \nforced into criminal activities or commercial sex work.  \n \n35. \nThere  are  also  occupations  invisible  to  the  general  public,  such  as  work  in  factories  or \nsweatshops, serving as drug couriers, or in brothels or other forms of sex work. Some of these \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n11\n\nchildren may not have come directly to the street, but have followed paths and processes taken \nby other street children.  \n \n36. \nStreet  children  come  into  conflict  with  the  law  in  many  ways.  Some  children  are \ntrafficked  or  otherwise  coerced  into  involvement  in  illegal  activities,  from  bag  snatching  and \npetty  theft  to  drug  or  weapons  smuggling.  Children  may  steal  food  or  clothes  for  themselves. \nStreet  children  are  often  stigmatized  by  police  and  the  public,  who  believe  they  are  doing \nsomething  wrong  even  if  they  are  playing.  Children  are  not  always  taken  into  justice  systems \nwhen in conflict with the law, but may be dealt with \u201cinformally\u201d when they are perceived to have \nbehaved  wrongly.  Street  children  may  be  beaten  by  police,  shopkeepers,  or  other  adults, \nreinforcing  the  perception  of  street  children  as  criminals.  Children  also  report  having  to  bribe \nauthorities  including  police,  and  often  are  subject  to  harassment  by  police  including  beatings, \nabuse and other violence, including sexual violation.  \n \n37. \nBy  day  or  night,  children  may  be  bullied  by  other  children  or  by  adults.  Children  often \nreport a lack of place or space to play, including being moved from parks or other public spaces \nby  police  or  security  guards.  Children  on  the  street  also  are  exposed  to  other  risks,  including \nsubstance abuse (chiefly glue sniffing or solvents, amphetamine type substances, and opiates).  \n \n\n1. \n\nRural Situations \n\n38.  While street children are generally seen as an urban phenomenon, there are also rural \n\u201cstreet children\u201d\u2014children who are unaccompanied and living and working outside cities but not \nin  agriculture-related  activities.  Such  work  includes  the  transport  of  goods,  particularly  across \nborders.  Also,  as  HIV/AIDS  spreads  in  rural  locations,  increasing  numbers  of  children  whose \nparents  have  died  become  destitute,  especially  when  family  land  or  other  possessions  have \nbeen  sold  for  medical  care  or  seized  by  adult  extended  family  members  or  other  adults.  Such \nchildren  are  left  with  no  means  of  support  and  may  not  know  how  to,  or  completely  lack the \nmeans to, migrate to urban centers. \n \n\n2. \n\nMovement \n\nAn  important  element  in  the  lives  of  many  street  children  is  movement:  from  home  to \n39. \nstreet, rural area to city, rural area to border, across borders and so on. Such movements can \nresult  from  kidnapping  or  trafficking,  parents\u2019  migration,  abandonment,  flight  from  civil  conflict, \nself-migration,  running  away,  or  being  sent  away  to  work.  In  addition,  the  actions  of  parents, \nfamily,  or  school  or  problems  in  the  local  community  also  are  major  causes  of movement and \nseparation  from  family.  Once  on  the  move,  and  especially  in  unfamiliar  circumstances  without \nthe care or protection of parents or other adults, children are particularly vulnerable. They may \nbe  lured  into  brothels.  Agents  seeking  child  laborers go to railway and bus stations to pick up \nnew arrivals. Many children who are en route to the street are taken instead into work and so \nmay  fall  into  different,  but  no  less  hazardous  circumstances.  There  are  also  children  who \nescape from traffickers and end up on the streets in cities far away from home.  \n \n \n \n40. \nIn  many  circumstances,  children  are  adept  at  analyzing  their  situation  and  making \ndecisions for their own benefit. These include daily decisions on coping or survival techniques, \nas well as general assessments of their own best interests. Children may be living in abusive or \notherwise  unsuitable  residential  homes/shelters,  but  find  some  aspects  beneficial  and  on  that \nbasis  may  choose  not  to  move  onto,  or  back  to,  the  street.  Some  children  prefer  their \nindependence,  including  the  freedom  to  make  their  own  decisions  and  have  control  over  their \n\nSurvival \n\n3. \n\n\f 12\n\nlives.  Children  who  have  had  difficulty  with  schooling  may  prefer  not  to  continue  with  formal \neducation. Others may choose to escape situations of family poverty when they can get more \nfood on the street, or more freedom to play games, or freedom to go to the cinema and video \nparlors when they have earned or begged enough money.  \n \n41. \nThe  highly  structured  lives  of  children  who  spend  most  of  the  week  in  schooling \nactivities, stands in complete contrast to the lives of street children. While some street children \nexpress concern about their long-term futures, most see this being largely beyond their control. \nThus, many street children live for the moment, day-to-day. Such behavior carries its own set of \nrisks  (e.g.,  in  terms  of  crime,  substance  abuse  or  reproductive  health),  but  it  also  serves  as  a \ncoping mechanism. \n \nAlso, despite the inherent dangers, many children find life on the street to be liberating. \n42. \nFor some, it provides the possibility to earn money, eat reasonably well, and do things children  \nusually are not allowed to do at home. The problems of life on the street may become apparent \nonly when they grow older and their perspectives on life change. The notion of street children \nbeing \u201cout of place\u201d may primarily be a perception held by adults. Much depends on individual \nexperience.  \n \n43. \nStreet children who are \u201csuccessful\u201d have learned and practice a wide  range of coping \nskills,  which  in  most  other  social  contexts  would  be  recognized  as  highly  desirable.  For \nexample,  abilities  to  negotiate  difficult  situations,  to  bargain,  and  to  assert  themselves  are \nattributes that might suit many small enterprises. Many street children might be better perceived \nas  small  entrepreneurs.  The  problem  for  these  children  is  connected  with  the  deprived  and \ntransitory  nature  of  much  of  their  life  on  the  street  and  their  inability  to  gain  an  education  or \nother work skills or qualifications that will take them off the streets. Street children who do not \nreadily  become  \u201cstreet  smart\u201d  have  a  particularly  difficult  time  and  are  unlikely  to  survive  the \nstreets.  \n \nB. \n\nCauses \n\n44. \nThe  origins  of  the  street  children  phenomenon  are  varied,  and  the  direct  causes  are \nmany. Any of the processes of children becoming separated from family may result in children \nliving and working on the street at some point, perhaps via some other activity, and even then \nmoving  on  to  other  places  such  as  a  brothel  or  sweat  shop.  Adults  are  often  involved  in \nchildren\u2019s  separation  from  home,  sometimes  directly  in  collusion  with  parents,  more  often  by \nkidnappers or traffickers or by negligence. Often traffickers are known to children and families \ninvolved,  although  in  some  countries,  such  as  Cambodia,  NGO-led  antitrafficking  campaigns \nand child rights training for children, adults, and community leaders have made villagers more \naware of the techniques and scams used by traffickers.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty \n\n45. \nPoverty is perceived often as a major reason for children coming onto the street. Poverty \nmay in turn have been caused by other factors, such as flood, drought, earthquake, or lack of \nstate or other support in recovery efforts. Poverty also is caused by the shortage or loss of land, \neconomic  downturn,  the  closure  of  industries  in  transitional  economies,  and  the  use  of \nunemployment to stabilize economies. Along with poverty, economic inequality has been shown \nto  have  a  major  impact  on  family  health  and  to  exacerbate  family  stresses,  which  often  are \nmanifested  in  domestic  violence.  Inequality  also  results  in  migration  in  search  of  opportunity \nbelieved to exist in urban areas inside or outside original countries of residence.  \n \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n13\n\nOutcomes  of  poverty  include  parents\u2019  selling  or  abandoning  children.  Children  who  are \n46. \nsold tend to be very young, while abandoned children usually are infants, particularly disabled \nchildren. In some countries, more female than male babies are abandoned (for example, in PRC \nand India because of preference for a son); in others (such as Cambodia) male infants are more \nfrequently  abandoned.  But  children  as  old  as  12\u201314  years  have  been  reported  abandoned  in \ncities, particularly in situations where families have too many children and too many mouths to \nfeed.  \n \n47.  More widespread is families\u2019 need to send children to work, either to supplement family \nincome  or  to  reduce  family  size.  Children  may  go  to  work  daily  and  return  home  to  live  with \nparents  at  night,  or  be  sent  away  to  work  by  parents,  or  go  off  to  seek  work  by  themselves. \nFamilies  in  urban  locations  may  live  in  squatter  camps,  shanty  towns,  stay  with  friends  or \nrelatives,  or  \u201csleep  rough,\u201d  that  is,  the  entire  family  may  be  homeless  and  live  on  the  street. \nChildren from such families may go to work locally on the street, with parents or separately, in \nvarious occupations. The work available may include factory labor in addition to scavenging or \nrubbish  picking.  Often,  the  more  remunerative  the  work,  the  greater  the  health  and  safety \nhazards, or the poorer the working conditions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDiscrimination \n\nDiscrimination  also  can  force  children  onto  the  streets.  In  many  places,  communities \n48. \nhave  shunned  the  children  of  parents  who  have  been  taken  to  prison,  for  example  for  the \nmurder of a spouse. Without any state support, children are left to their own devices and move \nto the streets. In the PRC, this problem has led to the formation of a local NGO for the children \nof prisoners (see Anon. 1999; Anon. 2002). The stigmatization of parents living with HIV/AIDS, \nand  their  children,  may  cause  problems  for  those  children,  particularly  when  their  parents \nbecome  ill  and  die.  Other  issues  specific  to  certain  countries  include  the  acid  burning  of  the \nfaces of young women in Bangladesh if they refuse the advances of certain men. Such women, \nwho  are  seen  as  unmarriageable,  may  be  abandoned  by  their  families.  Discrimination  against \ngirls  and  young  women  in  all  situations  is  an  important  factor  in  the  lives  of  female  street \nchildren, particularly in South Asia, but by no means limited to that region alone. \n \n\n3. \n\nDomestic violence and abuse \n\n49. \nThe  reasons  for  children\u2019s  self-migration,  (that  is,  to  seek  economic  opportunities \nelsewhere,  especially  older  children),  leaving  home,  or  running  away,  often  revolve  around \nparents, family, or other members of the community. Domestic violence, physical abuse, sexual \nabuse and exploitation, all create conditions whereby children decide to leave home.  \n \n50. \nProblems of violence in families may stem from family histories and experiences, as well \nas  the  consequences  of  poverty.  Factors  include  reconstituted  families  in  certain  situations, \nwhere  step-parents  reject  or  do  not  want  stepsons  or  stepdaughters.  The  reconstitution  of \nfamilies also may lead to the abandonment of children, for example, where a mother or father \nremarries and does not take her or his children to the new household, at the behest of the new \nspouse. A woman may then become stepmother to her husband\u2019s child, and act violently toward \nthe child, especially if she has a new baby of her own (stepmothers seem to be demonized in \nmany  places,  including  folk  tales  across  cultures).  But  domestic  violence  is  not  limited  to  poor \nfamilies; the children of better-off families also sometimes choose to escape and leave home.  \n \n\n\f 14\n\n4. \n\nSchool \n\n51. \nPressure  and  violence  at  school  also  cause  children  to  run  away.  Children  can  be \nsubject  to  bullying  or  violence  from  teachers  or  other  children.  Children  may  face  enormous \nschool  pressures,  including  both  the  quantity  of  schoolwork  and  anxieties  about  doing  well, \nparticularly  in  cultures  where  a  high  premium  is  placed  on  educational  achievement.  In  some \ncountries,  tuition  is  not  free,  while  in  many  other  places,  although  public  school  tuition  is  free, \nother  school  fees  are  levied  or  children  are  required  to  buy  uniforms  and  school  materials. \nPoorer families cannot afford these costs and their children are, thus, unable to attend school. In \naddition  to  being  denied  an  education,  this  increases  their  vulnerability  to  be  used  as  cheap \nlabor, or to be sent away from the family to work.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDrugs \n\n52. \nThe  increased  availability  of  a  variety  of  drugs,  particularly  amphetamine-type \nsubstances,  is  resulting  in  new  categories  of  street  children  in  parts  of  Asia.  Drug  use  and \ndependence,  and  theft  or  other  criminal  activities  to  support  such  dependence,  are  causing \nsome children from better-off families to be thrown out of home. Glue or solvent sniffing, which \ncauses  permanent  brain  damage,  also  is  common  in  some  countries  as  a  cheap  and  readily \navailable  means  to  escape  personal  problems  or  to  diminish  hunger.  Drug  use  by  parents  is \nalso a cause of children coming onto the street. \n \n\n6. \n\nArmed conflict, natural disasters \n\nIn parts of the region, children end up  on the streets as a direct consequence of conflict \n53. \nor  its  aftermath\u2014when  families  are  separated,  there  are  mass  movements  of  people,  and  an \nabsence of civil order. Afghanistan was a notable case in 2002, but such conflict is widespread \nin the region, for example, in Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan. Natural (or human-\nmade)  disasters  also  contribute  to  the  numbers  of  street  children,  either  directly,  or  as  a \nconsequence of deepening poverty. \n \n\n7. \n\nHIV/AIDS \n\n54.  While  increased  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS  is  a  consequence  of  life  on  the  streets  for \nmany children, HIV/AIDS is also an increasing cause of children coming onto and remaining on \nthe streets. Many children who are abandoned come from families affected by HIV/AIDS or are \nHIV positive themselves. The phenomenon of \u201cAIDS orphans\u201d has brought some children onto \nthe street. Children who are HIV positive experience discrimination. HIV/AIDS is linked to many \nother causes such as abuse, drugs, discrimination, exploitation, armed conflict, and is becoming \nincreasingly significant. \n \nC. \n\nConsequences \n\n55. \nSome of the major issues connected with street children are outlined briefly below. All of \nthese issues impinge upon the lives of street children as a whole, as the result of children being \non  the  street.  Each  street  child  has  personal  experiences  that  contribute  to  his  or  her  current \ncircumstances,  but  which  are  likely  to  include  some,  if  not  many,  of  the  following  issues  or \nproblems.  \n \n56. \nSimilar experiences may not lead to the same outcome. Some trafficked children end up \non  the  street,  others  in  brothels.  Whether  children  can  be  reintegrated  into  their  families  and \ncommunities  depends  upon  their  reasons  for  initially  separating  from  home  as  well  as  their \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n15\n\nexperiences  on  the  street,  or  their  options  for  something  other  than  life  on  the  street.  The \npatterns and potentials vary considerably across the Asia-Pacific region. \n \n\n1. \n\nDomestic and cross-border trafficking for sex and other work \n\n57. \nTrafficking  includes  persuasion  or  tricking  of  the  families  of  children  and  young  people \n(particularly  young  women)\u2014or  children  and  young  people  themselves\u2014to leave their homes, \nusually with an older person, and generally on promises of money, jewelry, or employment. The \ntrafficked children or youths may go with or without their parent\u2019s knowledge or connivance. The \ntrafficker may be male or female, local and known to the children and their family, or a complete \nstranger.  Typically,  children  and  young  people  find  themselves  passed  on  by  their  traffickers \ninto  exploitative  circumstances,  including  brothels  or  sale  to  rich  men  who  abuse  them  for  a \nwhile and them sell them on to commercial sex work. The high premium placed on sex with a \nvirgin, combined with associated folk beliefs (of prosperity and disease prevention and remedy), \ncontributes  to  the  market  for  trafficked  children  and  young  women.  Conversely,  for  many  girls \nand  young  women,  the  loss  of  their  virginity  as  the  result  of  abuse  or  rape  is  so  great  a \ndiminution  that  it  causes  them  to  become  careless  of  life,  with  their  feelings  of  worthlessness \nleaving them vulnerable to further exploitation. It is such vulnerability that also poses a threat for \nstreet children, in that some impoverished adults living with HIV/AIDS are reported to seek out \neven more powerless people, such as children, with whom to have cheap and often unprotected \nsex. \n\n \n58. \nYoung women increasingly are sold into marriage, a problem that is growing because of \nskewed sex ratios in such countries as the PRC and India. Children of both sexes are trafficked \nfor use in criminal activities, such as street theft; or other street work such as begging or flower \nselling.  Such  children  may  be  separated  from,  abandoned  by,  or  run  away  from  adult \ncaregivers, to be trafficked and become street children working and/or living on the street.  \n \nThe destination of trafficked children and young people may be within their country or in \n59. \nother countries, depending on the location of demand and the traffickers\u2019 connections. Children \nfrom Asia and the Pacific (as well as Africa) are trafficked to both North America and to western \nEurope, for example, to work in the sex trade or domestic service (Tremlett and Hopkins 2002). \nChildren also are trafficked within the region and within country. Distances from home may be \nsmall or great.  \n \n60. \nThe  borders  in  much  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region  are  porous,  not  least  because  many \nethnic minorities straddle international boundaries. The trafficking of children, such as from Viet \nNam  into  Cambodia,  from  Cambodia  into  Thailand,  and  from  Myanmar  into  the  PRC,  is  well \nknown, but there are also instances of Bangladeshi children taken into Thailand, and Chinese \nchildren taken to Malaysia and Thailand. Much of this trafficking is for work in the sex industry. \nSome  children  are  trafficked  for  commercial  begging  groups,  although  these  may  be  younger \nand  destined  to  later  move  into  sex  work.  Trafficked  children  find  it  particularly  difficult  to \nescape,  often  not  knowing  exactly  where  they  are,  sometimes  facing  language  barriers,  and \nhaving particular fear of the police or other authorities. \n \n\n2. \n\nInternal and cross-border migration \n\n61. \nAlthough migrants are more conventionally thought of as adults or families, many street \nchildren  are  themselves  lone  migrants.  Children  may  migrate  to  cities  on  their  own  volition  to \nseek  work,  or  to  escape  poor  family  relationships,  or  may  be  sent  by  parents  to  find  work.  In \nmany  cases,  they  regularly  remit  money  home.  In  other  circumstances,  children  (or  their \n\n\f 16\n\n\u201ccontrollers\u201d) provide money for parents at the end of a period of work (and after the controllers \nhave taken their cut).  \n \n62.  Migration  within  countries  is  largely  rural-urban  and  toward  more  prosperous  areas. \nChildren\u2019s  patterns  of  migration  are  less  researched,  and  may  be  over  shorter  distances,  at \nleast  initially.  Movements  across  borders  are  also  generally  to  more  economically  developed \ncountries. Problems with migration include difficulty to find work or survive, and vulnerability to \nexploitation.  Children  living  in  border  areas,  such  as  the  Cambodia-Thailand  border,  are \nespecially attractive to employers for transporting (or smuggling) goods across the border.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDifference and discrimination  \n\nPerceived  differences  among  children\u2014of  gender,  ethnicity,  disability,  caste,  etc.\u2014can \n\n63. \naffect their experiences and circumstances as street children. \n \n\na. \n\nGender \n\n64.  Most street children across the Asia-Pacific region are boys. The immediate dangers to \ngirls\u2014of sex abuse from the public, from the authorities, and from other street children\u2014are well \nknown. In some places street girls keep their hair short in attempts at disguise (for example, IHT \n2003).2    In  the  Philippines,  however,  30%  of  the  street  children  population  are  girls  and \nvulnerable  to  sexual  abuse  and  exploitation,  pregnancies,  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases. \nThey  also  face  stereotyping  and  derogatory  terms  and  name  calling,  suggesting  they  are \nvoluntarily promiscuous and have no morals (CRB 2003). \n\n \n65. \nIn some places, girls face additional problems concerning their future, for example, the \ndifficulty of making a decent marriage without the sponsorship or protection of a male relative. In \nmany  countries  in  the  region,  girls  who  have  been  raped  or  involved  in  the  sex  industry  face \nstigmatization  and  discrimination,  although  in  other  countries  this  is  less  of  a  problem.  In \nCambodia  and  northern  Thailand,  while  it  is  known  that  girls  who  migrate  to  the  cities  often \nengage  in  some  form  of  commercial  sex  work,  it  is  euphemistically  said  that  they  \u201cwork  in  a \nfactory.\u201d Again, migration from home often involves issues of marriage, as well as self-identity, \nself-worth, and self-esteem, as well as having to cope with often traumatic experiences.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEthnicity \n\nDiscrimination against various ethnic groups is rife in some countries. Where an ethnic \n66. \ndistinction  is  obvious,  then  the  affected  street  children  face  additional  problems:  for  example, \nthe children from Xinjiang in other parts of the PRC, Vietnamese children in Cambodia, etc.  \n \n\nc. \n\nDisability \n\n67.  Many  street  children  in  the  region  are  disabled,  and  a  large  number  work  as  beggars. \nSome,  it  is  said,  have  been  deliberately  mutilated  by  adults  in  order  to  earn  more  money. \nDisabled  children  often  are  abandoned  at  birth.  Some  of  the  disabilities, such as cleft lip/cleft \npalate, can easily be corrected through surgery, but also are the subject of belief systems that \nrequire  purification  of  both  mother  and  family,  sometimes  resulting  in  infanticide  and  maternal \n\n                                                 \n2  \n\nInternational Herald Tribune, \u201cIn Iran, runaway girls dodge abuse by dressing as boys,\u201d 20 February 2003, p.1 \nand  p.4.  \u201c\u2026[I]t  is  a  growing  phenomenon  mainly  among  lower-class  runaways  who  believe  the  disguise  gives \nthem  a  freedom  and  protection  they  could  not  enjoy  as  girls.  Posing  as  boys  on  the  streets  makes  it  easier  to \navoid rape and falling victim to prostitution rings.\u201d  \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n17\n\nsuicide  or  ostracization  and  abandonment.  Many  disabled  children  face  discrimination  within \ntheir own cultures and society, where they are not valued. \n \n\nd. \n\nCaste \n\n68. \nAlthough officially abolished in South Asia, caste remains an important influence, and a \nkey basis for discrimination. A high proportion of street children in India is reported to be of the \nDalit or \u201cuntouchable\u201d caste (HRWA 2000). \n\n \n\ne. \n\nAge \n\n69. \nStreet children are of widely different ages, and may live in groups. Hierarchies exist on \nthe streets; older and bigger children take care of and also bully younger and smaller children, \nfrom whom they may extort money or clothes. Some street children spend all they earn in a day \nin order that nothing is left to be taken from them by other children\u2014or by street adults. Other \nadults  (which  in  some  places  may  include  police  or  other  authorities)  also  may  demand \n\u201cprotection money.\u201d \n \n70. \nAlthough the length of time children spend on the streets influences their survival skills, \nextended  street  life  likely  will  result  in  significant  alienation  from  conventional  social  life.  This \nmakes  it  increasingly  difficult  for  street  children  to  successfully  reintegrate  into  community  life, \nfor example, by entry into shelters or daycare projects as a way out of the street.  \n \n\n4. \n\nJustice system  \n\n71. \nStreet children face the risk of being placed in prisons, detention centers, or other forms \nof  incarceration,  which  may  further  compromise  the  likelihood  of  their  later  being  reintegrated \ninto  community  life.  The  justice  system  and  incarceration  may  be  used  inappropriately  to \nremove children from the streets. Few countries in the region have adequate systems of juvenile \njustice. In many countries, street children report that police harassment is the major problem in \ntheir lives. \n \n\n5. \n\nAlternative care \n\n72. \nIt  is  not  only  incarceration  within  the  \u201cjustice\u201d  system  that  results  in  institutionalization. \nSome  shelters,  especially  institutions  catering  to  large  numbers  of  street  children,  develop \ninstitutional practices that are detrimental  to children\u2019s future well being. Such practices include \nbulk  purchase  of  poor  quality  food,  uniformity  in  service  provision,  lack  of  children\u2019s \nparticipation,  and  insufficient  acknowledgement  of  or  respect  for  children\u2019s  identities  and \nindividuality. When  children  who  have  long  been  institutionalized  become  adults  and  face  the \nwithdrawal  of  support,  they  frequently  find  it  difficult  to  adjust  to  independent  life  and  decision \nmaking.  Many  drift  into  other  institutions,  such  as  the  armed  services.  Although  there are few \nfirm data, it appears that prison populations have a large number of ex-street children.  \n \n\n6. \n\nExploitation  \n\n73. \nThe need for street children to make a living makes them vulnerable to hazardous and/or \nexploitative  labor  situations.  Many  established  businesses  in  both  the  formal  and  informal \nsectors depend on children as a source of cheap labor.  \n \n74. \nThere is an apparently insatiable demand for child sex workers of both sexes. Children \nmay be engaged in brothel-based commercial sex work or by street-based encounters with both \n\n\f 18\n\nlocal  and  foreign  men.  Some  countries,  including  Cambodia,  Thailand,  and  Sri  Lanka  have \nbecome well known \u201csex tourism\u201d destinations, drawing pedophiles and pimps as well as street \nchildren who may resort to commercial sex work.  \n \nProblems  include  early  sexualization,  in  addition  to  reproductive  health  issues  and \n75. \nsexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Street children are particularly vulnerable to \nrape and to unprotected sex. \n\n \nThe  issue  of  children  exploited  through  various  forms  of  work  arises  in  all  parts  of  the \n76. \nregion and needs to be seen as, and linked to, the general question of child labor. The extent of \nsuch work emerged through a major study by the ILO (ILO 2002a). Of the 352 million children \naged 5\u201317 years engaged in economic activity, \u201cThe report found that 246 million children\u2014one \nin every six children aged 5 to 17\u2014are involved in child labour\u201d (ILO 2002b), meaning the type \nof  labor  that  should  be  abolished.  Such  work  includes  that  performed  by  children  under  the \nminimum  age  specified  for  a  particular  kind  of  work  by  national  legislation  or  other  standards; \nhazardous  work  that  jeopardizes  the  physical,  mental  or  moral  wellbeing  of  a  child;  and \nunconditional  worst  forms  of  child  labor  as  defined  in  the  ILO  Convention  182  (ILO  2002b). \nMuch of the work undertaken by street children falls under the purview of the ILO Convention on \nthe  Worst  Forms  of  Child  Labor,  which  specifies  trafficking  and  sex  work.  Much  of  street \nchildren\u2019s  lives  is  structured  around  work,  and  shifting  to  different  means  of  survival  or \nopportunity. Much of the work available is controlled by criminal gangs, and children do not have \na choice. \n \n\n7. \n\nIdentity and participation \n\n77. \nA key issue for street  children  is  their  exclusion  from  much  of  everyday  social  life.  In \naddition  to  scavenging  for  food  at  restaurants,  they  are  also  chased  away  from  shops  and \nrestaurants by both owners and customers. Street children rarely are treated with any respect, \nand their views and opinions are seldom taken into consideration by anyone. \n \n78. \nStreet children are further excluded in that they are unlikely to possess identity cards or \nother  forms  of  identification,  including  birth  registration.  This  may  be  due  to  parents\u2019 selling or \npawning their children\u2019s identity materials, parents\u2019 not registering their children, or registration \nprocesses  not  being  readily  available.  In  some  countries,  infants  are  not  registered  at  birth \nbecause  of  customary  belief  and  high  infant  mortality  rates.  When  children  migrate,  with  or \nwithout  parents,  and  even  within  country,  what  identity  papers  they  may  possess  may  not  be \nvalid. \n \n79. \nThe lack of identity papers prevents street children from gaining access to education and \nhealth  services  that  might  otherwise  be  free,  or  result  in  them  having  to  pay  higher  charges. \nLack of identity, a key precept of the CRC, also can prevent street children from subsequently \nregistering the birth of their own children. \n \n\n8. \n\nEducation \n\n80. \nStreet children generally lack access to public education services. In some urban areas, \nchildren who do not need to work, but who have been in conflict with the law, are excluded from \nschools  because  they  are  seen  as  a  potentially  bad  influence  on  their  peers. These children \nspend their days on the street. \n \n81. \nOther  children  are  unable  to  go  to  school  because  of  the  need  to  work,  because  of \ndiscrimination,  or  because  of  costs.  In  some  places,  it  is  believed  that  girls  do  not  need  an \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n19\n\neducation,  or  that boys are better off working. While school tuition is supposedly free in many \ncountries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  tuition  fees  exist  in  some  places,  and  these  or  other  school \nfees or charges that are levied make it impossible for poor children to attend school. It matters \nlittle  what  reason  is  given  for  the  fee:  any  charge  prohibits  many  children  attending  school.  A \nfurther problem is that traditional, rote methods of teaching often do not encourage children and \nthe lessons are not seen to be useful by either children or their parents.  \n \n\n9. \n\nHealth \n\n82. \nStreet  children  cannot  afford  most  health  services;  thus,  receive  no  treatment  for  any \nailments and injuries, although some buy medicine to treat themselves. Even where there are \nsupposedly \u201cfree\u201d hospitals and health services, their socially marginalized position means they \nmay  not  be  treated.  Some  preventable  health  problems  occur  because  the  children  have  no \naccess to proper diagnosis and treatment or even hygiene and sanitation. Many street children \nsuffer chronic diseases, including typhoid, tuberculosis, jaundice, liver and kidney disorders, and \nmalaria.  Other  reported  health  problems  include  scabies,  epilepsy,  and  broken  limbs.  Many \nstreet children also suffer from the effects of substance abuse, particularly when using drugs of \nunknown  quality.  Sexually  transmitted  diseases  are  prevalent  amongst  older  street  children, \nwith increasing numbers of street children now living with HIV/AIDS.  \n \n \n\nIV.  WELFARE OF STREET CHILDREN ACROSS THE REGION \n\n83. \nAlthough  the  geography,  economies,  and  governance  systems  within  the  Asia-Pacific \nregion are diverse, the circumstances and experiences of street children across the region are \nquite  similar.  This  is  reinforced  to  an  extent  by  the  interconnections  of  countries  through \ntrafficking  and  migration  of  children,  criminal  and  drug  connections,  and  sex  tourism  and \npedophilia\u2014that is, the impact of adults on children.  \n \n84. \nHowever,  the  social  and  structural  response  to  street  children  and  associated  issues \ndepends upon the particular national economic, political, and cultural context. Local ideas about \nchildhood  and  both  intra-  and  interfamily  relationships  form  one  contextual  element,  including \nattitudes toward girl children and sexual violence. Other key contextual elements are systems of \ngovernance,  resource  allocations  (which  again  vary  from  country  to  country  and  include  the \ninput  by  civil  society  into  state  budgetary  processes),  as  well  as  local  economic  conditions.  In \nthis  section,  the  provision  of  welfare  to  street  children  in  different  countries  and  subregions \nwithin the Asia-Pacific region is discussed. \n \nA. \n\nCentral, Eastern, and Northern Asia \n\nIn  the  Central  Asian  republics  including  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and \n85. \nUzbekistan,  and  in  Mongolia,  the  presence  of  street  children  is  a  comparatively  recent \nphenomenon closely associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rapid transition to \nmarket-based economies. It is a new phenomenon in the Kyrgyz Republic (IRIN Bishek 2001), \nthe  result  of  alcoholism  of  parents,  poverty,  abuse,  and  domestic  violence.  Often  the  children \nhave stepfathers or stepmothers who push children to leave home (Anon., undated). A report on \nUzbekistan summarizes the situation:  \n\n \nUzbekistan, along with most of  the  other  countries  of  the  former  Soviet  Union, \nhas experienced an increase in the number of street children. Street children are \nsubject  to  the  everyday  risk  of  being  abused,  and  experience  violence  at  the \nhands of both adults and their peers. Many of them do not have timely access to \n\n\f 20\n\nqualified  medical  services.  Their  major  concern,  though,  is  the  day-to-day \nstruggle to make a living. It is very common for these children to be involved in \ncriminal activities because they do not have any other means of earning money \n(Tahlil 2002, p.15).  \n\n \n86. \nIn many of these countries, street children appear to be new because of their increased \nnumbers.  Recent  awareness  of  the  problem  of  street  children,  however,  occurs  in  a  context \nwhere the presence of working children has been a long-established practice. Problems include \nthe absence of welfare support systems for families and children in the new economies, and the \nemphasis  on  the  \u201cmarket\u201d  that  has  had  governments  struggling  to  design  and  implement  new \nprovisions in a climate that is dismantling rather than developing or improving state services. \n \nSocial  and  economic  reforms  in  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  are  taking  place  under \n87. \ncomplex  conditions  of  political  instability.  Consequently,  owing  to  pressure  of  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  transitional  period  and  the  implementation  of  market  reforms,  the  actual \nmeans available for state bodies to provide children with the opportunity to obtain the necessary \neducation have diminished (GRT 1998, paragraph 4).  \n\n \n\n\u2026regrettably  the  list  of  children  [in  difficult  circumstances]  requiring  special \nattention  in  the  Republic  has  increased.  That  category  should  also  include \nrefugee  children,  children  from  unemployed  families,  child  victims  of  armed \nconflict,  child  beggars  and  children  left  without  supervision\u2014and  this  is  not  a \ncomplete list (GRT 1998, paragraph 30).  \n\n \nThe  report  noted  that  the  category  of  children  in  difficult  circumstances  previously \n88. \nincluded  \u201corphans,  children  left  without  parental  care  and  support, children of asocial families, \ndisabled  children  and  children  who  have  broken  the  law  and  need  special  conditions  for  their \nupbringing\u201d (GRT 1998). \n\n \n89. \nThe  case  of  Mongolia\u2014the increasing numbers of urban \u201cstreet and manhole\u201d children \nover  the  past  decade\u2014is  comparatively  well  known.  Economic  changes  have  resulted  in  the \nclosure  of  many  industries,  high  levels  of  unemployment,  and  families  moving  in  a  downward \nspiral  toward  homelessness.  Mongolia\u2019s  harsh  winters  force  these  people  to  take  shelter  in \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s  underground  heating  system.  Growing  numbers  of  children  have  become \nseparated from parents or stayed with families and worked on the streets.  \n \n90.  Mongolia\u2019s  economic  transition  brought  an  end  to  the  previous  Soviet-style  welfare \nsystem,  but  the  development  of  a  replacement  system  is  still  underway.  The  Government  is \nrestricted  in  its  ability  to  hire  more  staff  and  there  are  also  issues  of  appropriate  social  work \ntraining.  Training  courses  for  social  workers  have  recently  been  developed  at  the  State \nPedagogical  University  with  the  support  of  an  international  NGO  (Quieta  2002).  International \nNGOs  continue  to  operate  the  bulk  of  shelters  and  other  street  children  interventions  in \nUlaanbaatar and in other Mongolian towns. As the country continues its \u201ctransitionary\u201d path, a \ndebate  has  begun  over  what  the  State  and  civil  society  can  do  to  address  the  problem  of  an \never-increasing number of street children.  \n \n91. \nThe  Mongolian  Government  supports  one  large  street  children  center, although some \nclaim  that  the  approach  is  too  institutional.  An  international  NGO  has  worked  with  the \nGovernment center to resettle many of the children with their families. However, with more than \n20  domestic  and  international  NGOs  involved  in  street  children  programming,  as  well  as  the \nresponsible government departments, coordination of work has become an important concern. \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n21\n\nAnother challenge for the Mongolian authorities is effective implementation of the country\u2019s child \nprotection law.  \n \n92. \nThe Central Asian republics have similar problems, but have received less international \nattention. For example, children in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic, also live underground because of \nthe climatic conditions. The street children population in the Kyrgyz Republic also includes child \nvictims of armed conflict. In Tajikistan, the Government\u2019s report to the Committee on the Rights \nof  the  Child  highlighted  how  the  country\u2019s  economic  difficulties  have  worsened  problems  in \nrunning  schools,  orphanages,  and  other  institutions  for  children.  Although  an  increase  in  the \nnumbers of child beggars was noted, the problem has not yet been given government attention. \nOther state reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child only briefly mention the increase \nin  the  numbers  of  street  children.  However,  domestic  and  international  NGOs  working  in  the \nsubregion have documented the situation in more detail. \n \n93. \nAnother  category,  \u201ctravelling  children,\u201d  has  been  identified  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. These children provide sexual and other services (such as lookouts, \nguards,  or  porters)  for  male  traders  and  travelers  on  trains.  The  children  manage  to  cross \nborders  easily  enough  and  become  street  children  at  their  destination  until  finding  another \ncustomer to take them elsewhere. If caught, the children are returned to their \u201chome countries\u201d \n(depending  on  what  information  they  provide);  after  spending  a  month  or  so  in  a  detention  or \nreception center, they return to the streets (see Blackley 1999). \n \n94. \nIn the PRC, although economic reform began in the late 1970s, somewhat earlier than \nother \u201ctransitional economies\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region, the transition process has avoided the \nsudden and wide-sweeping changes experienced by other countries in East and Central Asia.  \n \n95. \nThe  reappearance  of  street  children  in  the  PRC  during  the  transition  provoked  official \nconcern,  and  by  the  mid-1990s,  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Affairs  began  to  create  separate  Street \nChildren  Protection  Centers.  By  2000, more than 100 such centers were in existence, mostly \noperated through municipal-level civil affairs bureaus, but some at the provincial level. Beijing\u2019s \nStreet Children Protection Center is operated through the Public Security Bureau (police). The \nwork  of  these  centers  focuses  on  the  collection  of  street  children,  medical  check-ups,  and  in-\ncenter  education  until  the  children\u2019s  families  are  located  and  the  children  are  returned  to  their \nparents\u2019 care. Despite such efforts, the numbers of street children have continued to increase. \nThe  last  official  estimate,  in  1998,  put  the  national  figure  at  some  200,000  based  on  the \nnumbers  of  children  passing  through  the  state  protection  centers,  but  not  including  children  in \nrelated categories, such as working children with families.  \n \n96. \nNearly all service provision in the PRC is operated by the Government. Beginning in the \nlate  1990s,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  provided  funding  for  initiatives  in \nnortheastern  PRC,  Shanghai,  Anhui  Hefei,  and  more  recently  in  Henan.  Save  the  Children, \nUnited  Kingdom  (UK)  has  worked  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Affairs,  protection \ncenters,  and  civil  affairs  bureaus  in  some  20  provinces,  helping  to  establish  information \nnetworks  and  providing  seminars  and  other  training.  Save  the  Children  also  has  worked  in \npartnership  with  centers  and  civil  affairs  bureaus  on  prevention  initiatives,  research,  and \ndevelopment of best practice in centers; encouraging child participation, reintegration, provision \nof  alternative  care  for  children  who  cannot  return  home;  and  related  activities.  As  part  of  the \n\u201csocialization  of  welfare,\u201d  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Affairs  is  looking  to  the  possible  development  of \nNGOs to support the provision of alternative care, as well as to promote increased participation \nof children in such operations. \n \n\n\f 22\n\nParts  of  the  PRC  have  been  under  external  control  or  influence  for  some  time.  Hong \n97. \nKong, China, for example, has a developed social services system, based on a British model, \nwith qualified and certificated social workers. NGOs in Hong Kong, China continue to play a role \nin service provision. Youth Outreach, linked to the Catholic Church, is a major initiative for street \nchildren  that  includes  both  a  shelter  and  an  outreach  program.  As  in  Britain,  however,  the \nproblems  of  street  children  in  Hong  Kong,  China  often  tend  to  fall  outside  the  main  mandate, \ncoming instead under the category of \u201chomeless young people.\u201d \n \nThe border regions of the PRC have various links with neighbors to the north, west, and \n98. \nsouth.  For  example,  the  peoples  of  Inner  Mongolia  Province  have  links  with  Mongolia.  The \nautonomous region of Xinjiang is home to minority ethnic groups such as Mongolians, Kazaks, \nUzbeks,  and  others.  The  southern  provinces  of  Guangxi  and  Yunnan  have  close  links  with \nadjacent  countries  and  peoples.  These  many  neighbors,  as  well  as  the  porous  borders  and \nethnic  groups  that  straddle  international  borders,  have  served  to  promote  international \nmigration, including the trafficking of children.  \n \nAs indicated above, state-run institutions are the dominant response in these countries. \n99. \nPart of the problem with institutionalization is that many children continue to spend their days on \nthe street. In addition, children must leave state-run institutions at the age of 16 years, but the \neconomic  situation  may  not  offer  employment  opportunities  especially  to  an  ill-educated  and \nunskilled street child. Many older street children are picked up by police and held in detention \ncenters, replacing one institution with another. In the Kyrgyz Republic, it is reported that some \nstreet  children  have  to  bribe  militia  or  other  authorities  with  all  their  daily  earnings  in  order  to \nretain their freedom (see Tahlil 2002; Anon., undated).  \n \n100.  Such problems are common to many countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The expressed \naim in many countries (and clearly an unexpressed intention elsewhere) is to clear the cities of \nstreet  children  through  police  raids  or  round-ups. Such a response can  be understood as the \nresult  of  the  novelty  of  the  phenomenon,  lack  of  knowledge  about  or  attention  to  workable \nalternatives, and because the very existence of street children belies a successful market-based \ntransitional process (not that western industrial countries do not share the problem of \u201cchildren \nout of place\u201d).  \n \n101.  The need to establish social work as a profession and to introduce social work methods \nhas  been  noted,  for  example,  in  Mongolia  and  Uzbekistan.  Although  there  is  an  emphasis  on \nreturning children home to parents, this has been seen to fail where there is no prior preparation \nof children and their families or careful monitoring or follow-up work (something noted in nearly \nall  countries).  Increased  child  prostitution  has  been  observed  in  Uzbekistan  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  in  addition  to  other  work  such  as  market  portering,  newspaper  selling,  and  car \nwashing. Parental migration (for example from the Kyrgyz Republic to Russia) without suitable \narrangements for child care or for family reunification, including remission of money back to the \nchild,  has  become  common.  There  also  has  been  an  increase  in  abandonment  of  children, \nbecause parents simply cannot afford to maintain their offspring. Many children are working to \nhelp supplement family income, and it is reported that some parents force their children to beg \n(See GRT 1998; IRIN 2001;Tahlil 2002; Anon., undated). \n \n102.  The  instability  of  many  families  in  the  transitional  economies  is  part  of  wholesale \nchanges in social structures including the lack of welfare provision, the emergence of social and \nmaterial  inequalities,  new  opportunities  to  exploit  children  (for  example,  at  work),  and  the \nincreasing  need  of  children  to  work,  either  to  help  support  their  families  or  for  their  own \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n23\n\nexistence.  All  of  these  changes  cause  and  exacerbate  the  problem  of  street  children  the \nsubregion.  \n \n103. \nIn  addition,  other  changes  in  government  provision  have  exacerbated  problems  for \nchildren. Teachers are chronically underpaid, with many having to take additional jobs in order \nto survive (a problem not limited to this subregion). In Uzbekistan, there also has been a shift \nfrom  the  Cyrillic  to  Roman  alphabet,  begun  when  teachers  were  poorly  trained,  and  with  an \n\u201cabsence  of  additional  literature  in  Roman  for  home  reading.  [As  a]  result  the  children  are \nisolated  from  Uzbek  Cyrillic  literature  and  surely  from  the  Russian-language  editions.  The \nparents can\u2019t help them with the lessons\u201d (Azimova et al. 1999, p. 6; also see Blackley 1999). \nInadequate  and  underfunded  education  systems,  including  poorly  trained  and  disinterested \nteachers, contribute toward children\u2019s staying out of school. As well as losing the opportunity or \nbeing denied the right to education, they are encouraged further by such limitations to drift to the \nstreet.  \n \n104.  Such  provision  as  exists  for  street  children  (and  other  categories  of  children  at  risk)  is \npredominantly  through  \u201chumanitarian  and  charitable  funds,\u201d  for  example,  boarding  schools  for \norphans in Tajikistan (GRT  1998,  p.  35)  and  shelters  in  Mongolia  (West  and  Tungalag  2002). \nThe  exceptions  are  the  larger  government  institutions,  which  may  or  may  not  have  been \nrehabilitated or refurbished from earlier political regimes and which are based on very different \nperceptions  of  child  welfare.  Such  institutions  tend  to  perceive  and  treat  children  as  social \ndeviants,  rather  than  as  the  product  or  consequence  of  changing  social  mores  and  economic \ntransition.  The  limited  NGO  sector  cannot  cover  all  the  needs  and  rights  of  children\u2014care \nshelters,  access  to  education  or  to  vocational  training,  social  counseling,  etc.  Also,  in  places \nwhere access to education generally is a problem for poor families, there is a tendency for some \nparents to place their children in NGO shelters as a \u201cpreventative\u201d measure so that their children \nmight receive care, clothing, and education that they cannot otherwise afford.  \n\n \nSouth Asia \n\nB. \n\n105.  South Asia is home to some of the largest concentrations of street children in the world. \nIn this subregion, street children have been a distinct social underclass for a longer period than \nelsewhere.  NGOs  there  also  have  had  more  experience  in  service  provision  and  other \ninterventions targeted to street children, including the establishment of children\u2019s organizations \nand  working  children\u2019s  unions.  Such  organizations  are  based  on  the  principle  of  children\u2019s \nparticipation in personal decision making, such as voluntary residence in shelters. The approach \nhas developed beyond the use of shelters toward working with children wherever they are living, \nand at times suitable to them, on the street or elsewhere. This approach includes a structural \nfocus on children\u2019s participation, including children\u2019s involvement in research, involving them in \nthe  operation  and  management  of  shelters  and  other  centers,  and  nonformal  education  for \nstreet children. Particular attention has been given to the problems of street children taken into \njustice systems, the roles and attitude of the police, and the issue of girl children and violence. \n \n106.  Many  countries  in  South  Asia  remain  influenced  by  the  legacies  of  British  colonialism, \nparticularly  with  respect  to  legal  codes  and  bureaucracies  and  other  systems  that  have  pre-\nindependence roots. NGOs have been active since the 1920s. Although the northern kingdoms, \nsuch as Nepal and Bhutan, have different political backgrounds, overall the historical, political, \nlegal, and economic frameworks of South Asia are quite different from those of East and Central \nAsia.  \n \n\n\f 24\n\n107.  Poverty  again is the major contributing cause of street children across South Asia, but \nthe  extent  of  poverty  is  such  that  it  seems  to  be  an  accepted  or  given  context.  The  daily \nexperience  of  rural  poverty  and  its  privations  probably  is  one  reason  why  (rural)  children are \nattracted  to  city  life  through  the  mass  media,  mainly  films.  Although  poverty  is  an  important \nreason  for  children  working  on  the  streets  of  South  Asia,  it  seems  that  intrafamily  conflict, \nabuse,  and  violence  are  leading  causes  for  children\u2019s  separation  from  family  (SKCV  2000a). \nSome  abuse  is  especially  linked  to  reconstituted  families,  with  reports  of  children  beaten  to \ndeath when they are forcibly reunited with their families.  \n \n108.  Children\u2019s life on the streets of South Asia is characterized by discrimination and stigma, \nas  well  as  problems  of  police  harassment.  Such  harassment  extends  to  illegal  detention  or \nbeing detained on false charges, beatings and torture, and examples where the lawyers of local \ndrug  dealers  succeed  in  securing  release  of  children  from  imprisonment  where  child  rights \norganizations  have  failed.  A  key  element  of  the  legal  quandary  affecting  millions  of  street \nchildren  appears  to  be  the  use  of  antiquated,  pre-independence  legislation  as  the  basis  for \ncriminalizing children. Such laws simply do not apply to the contemporary context, particularly in \nview of the CRC. \n \n109.  Afghanistan  occupies  a  special  position  in  the  subregion,  serving  as  something  of  a \nbridge  to  East  and  Central  Asia.  In  Afghanistan,  the  emergence  of  large  numbers  of  street \nchildren is the consequence of more than two decades of armed conflict rather than the demise \nof  the  Soviet  Union  and  economic  transition.  A  preliminary  head  count  in  early  2002  recorded \nmore than 37,000 children working and begging on the streets of Kabul. Some 80% were boys, \nwith 36% aged 8\u201310 years, and more than half aged 12\u201314 years. Nearly one third had begun \nbegging  or  working  on  the  streets  in  the  previous  year.  Notably,  nearly  all  the  Kabul  street \nchildren had a place to go at night, and a large number lived with their parent(s). It was reported \nthat 98.5% of the children were sent by their families to the streets to work and beg in order to \nhelp  the  family  to  survive  (TdH  2002).  In  March  2003,  it  was  reported  that  \u201cthere  are  no \nstatistics,  but  Afghans  involved  with  women\u2019s  issues  say  the  selling  of  girls  is  on  the  rise\u201d \n(Kaufman  2003).  These  girls  are  sold  for  marriage,  seen  by  some  as  modernized  version  of \n\u201cbride price.\u201d Although the current phenomenon of Afghanistan street children derives from the \nwar,  large  numbers  of  Afghan  children  previously  came  onto  the  streets  as  refugees  in \nneighboring  Pakistan.  A  drop-in  center  in  Quetta  found  their  numbers  rapidly  increasing  after \n1999,  and  reported  that  in  winter,  the  boys  were  likely  to  head  to  Karachi,  where  a  warmer \nclimate would allow them to continue scavenging, because this was their families\u2019 only source of \nincome (SCUS, undated). In Karachi, it was reported that Afghan and Bengali immigrants had \nintroduced glue sniffing to Pakistani street children and other children (Dawn 2002).  \n \n110. \nIn  Bangladesh,  there  are  many  NGOs  working  in  the  development  and  welfare  fields, \nalthough \u201cunfortunately very few national and international NGOs are active in the field of child \nrights\u201d  (Khair  and  Khan  2000,  p.  41).  In  addition,  many  of  the  larger  NGOs  are  now  well \nestablished and institutionalized, and tend to look to the upper levels of the hierarchy of poverty. \nThis  \u201cspecialization\u201d  is  important  with  respect  to  the  development of children\u2019s organizations, \nparticularly  in  Bangladesh  and  India.  Such  organizations  emerge  from  a  broader  emphasis  on \nchildren\u2019s participation. Because most agencies looking to the needs of street children in South \nAsia  are  NGOs,  there  is  less  emphasis  on  the  placement  of  children  in  institutions  as  there  is \nelsewhere  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  Voluntary  attendance  has  been  emphasized,  with  the \nresult that services lean toward what children want, or what might benefit them the most, with \naspirations  of  eventually  operating  such  services  in  partnership  with  children.  What  is  lacking, \nhowever, is linkage to the high incidence of child labor including organization to lobby for better \nworking conditions and protection of children\u2019s basic rights.  \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n25\n\n \n111. \nIndia  has  as  many  as  18  million  street  children,  the  world\u2019s  largest  concentration. \nWhereas  all  of  them  are  extremely  poor,  up  to  half  of  them  are  Dalit,  or  belong  to  other \nscheduled  castes  or  tribes,  pointing  to  deeply  ingrained  patterns  of  inequality  (HRWA 2000). \nThe  context  for  street  children  in  India  is  high  numbers  of  working  children,  estimated  by  one \nsource to be between 70 and 100 million children (CACLI 2000). National sample surveys give \nlower figures\u2014estimating the number of working children  to be 17 million in 1987, increasing to \n20  million  by  2000.  These  figures,  however,  do  not  include  the  \u201cunorganized  sector  of  the \neconomy,\u201d such as domestic workers and agricultural workers, etc., that, when included, result \nin  the  much  higher  estimates  (CACLI  2000).  India  is  clearly  home  to  enormous  numbers  of \nstreet  children,  as  well  as  millions  of  child  workers,  many  of  whom  work  in  hazardous  or \nexploitative  circumstances.  Because  child  labor  is  illegal  in  India,  millions  of  child  workers \nbecome  officially  nonexistent,  without  faces  and  without  voice.  In  addition  to  a  violation  of  the \nprinciples  of  the  CRC,  their  lack  of  legal  status  makes  them  ineligible  for  worker  protection \nincluding  compensation  for  accidents  at  work  (for  example,  losing  a  limb).  These children are \nincreasingly  becoming  known  as  \u201cnowhere\u201d  children\u2014effectively  excluded  from  school \n(education)  and  from  regulated  work  (employment),  and  from  relevant  statistics  (see,  for \nexample, Joshi, undated; Kabeer 2002; Lakshmi 2002). The rapid increase in HIVAIDS in India \naffects  street  children  in  many  ways,  and  girls  rescued  from  commercial  sex  work  may  be \nrejected by some refuges if HIV positive.  \u201cAn estimated 400,000 children are trafficked in India \nevery year,\u201d some shipped to the Middle East (Stuart 2003).  \n \n112. \nIn Nepal, there were an estimated 30,000 street children in 1996, with fewer than 4,000 \nliving with their families (SCNT, undated). Most are said to come from families of poor farmers \nor  agricultural  workers,  and  who  dropped  out  of  school  before  achieving  literacy  or  numeracy \n(CWIN  2002).  In  Nepal,  as  elsewhere,  it  has  been  noted  that  \u201cthe  use  of  violence  as  a \npedagogical  tool  by  family  and  teachers  alike  is  extremely  common\u201d  (OMCT  1996).  As \nelsewhere, police harassment was identified as a major issue.  \n \n113.  A  recent  drop  in  the  number  of  street  children  in  Nepal  has  been  attributed  to  an \nincrease in facilities for them, linked to an increase in social awareness. However, this reduction \nseems to depend also on the way street children are counted, because the same source points \nto  a  worsening  of  the  problem  of  sexual  exploitation  with  an  increase  in  sex  tourism  (CWIN \n2002).  One  observer  (Pradhan  2002)  concluded  that  \u201cone  of  the  reasons  for  not  attaining  the \ntarget goals [for children] is the conventional approach toward development. Our development \nplanning is generally not child friendly, nor are they rights based; they are guided by the charity-\nbased approach instead.\u201d While many agencies working with street children in Nepal have not \nyet  involved  the  children  actively  in  implementing  their  projects,  others  have  developed \n\u201cchildren\u2019s clubs\u201d or other groups, including groups looking at issues of violence against girls.  \n \nIn Pakistan also, street children are found within the broader context of a large number \n114. \nof working children, conservatively estimated to involve 10 million children under 14-years old in \n1994  (OMCT  1994).  Children  are  said  to  be  engaged  in  labor  in  poor  and  hazardous  working \nconditions that approach \u201cnear slavery.\u201d Some children in bonded labor abscond to the streets. \nOther children are trafficked. In 1992 it was estimated that some 20,000 were sent to the Gulf \nregion  to  be  used  as  camel  jockeys.  It  was  reported  that  children  taken  into  detention  were \nplaced  with  adults  and  open  to  sexual  exploitation  and  \u201cre-education\u201d  by  hardened  criminals \n(ibid). In this context it may not be surprising that in Pakistan \u201cthe issue of street children has not \nbeen considered important or considerable enough for a check on magnitude to be drawn in this \ncountry,  therefore  numbers  are  not  known\u201d  (Workshop  SC  2002).  However,  one  estimate  for \nLahore  alone  suggested  10,000  street  children.  Given  that  some  40%  of  the  14 million \n\n\f 26\n\npopulation of Karachi live in squatter settlements, the figure for street children in this city could \nbe many times that of Lahore.  \n \n115.  Causes  for  children  being  on  the  street  in  Pakistan  also  include  poverty  and  family \nviolence  and  conflict.  NGOs  appear  as  a  major  resource  in  working  with  the  children  and \nundertaking  practice-based  research  of  the  issue.  In  1999,  a  \u201cnongovernment  initiative\u201d  was \nlaunched  \u201cto  protect  more  than  a  million  street  children  in  Pakistan  following  the  sensational \nmurders of nearly 100 children in Lahore by a serial killer\u201d (Najeeb 1999). A report in 2001 noted \nthat the majority of the more than 10,000 children on the streets of Karachi were Bengalis and \nBurmese  as  well  as  other  ethnic  groups  including  Punjabis,  Baluchis,  and  Urdu-speaking \nchildren.  Nearly  90%  used  various  drugs,  with  some  65%  using  solvents  (Dawn  2001).  The \nrange of national origins, as well as extensive substance abuse, points to the vast differences \ntraveled  by  some  street  children,  as  well  as  the  plight  of  ethnic  and  minority  groups  in  these \ncounries.  \n \n116.  The development of street and working children\u2019s own organizations, and associations of \nother  groups  of  children,  has  been  recognized  as  an  important  characteristic  of  provision  in \nSouth  Asia.  Such  organizations  have  been  successful  to  the  extent  that  they  have  been \nchallenged  by  some  religious  and  political  groups  apparently  opposed  to  children\u2019s  active \nparticipation  as  citizens,  despite  this  being  a  fundamental  element  of  the  Convention  on  the \nRights  of  the  Child.  The  existence  of  these  organizations  has  had  some  impact  on  the \ndevelopment  of  provision  for  street  children  and  an  emphasis  on  meeting  children\u2019s  needs  on \nthe  street,  including  children\u2019s  empowerment.  Many  of  these  organizations  have  now  reached \nthe point that they are looking  to mechanisms for organizational sustainability as some of their \nclient groups move from adolescence into adulthood.  \n \nC. \n\nSoutheast Asia \n\n1. \n\nMainland Southeast Asia \n\n117.  The countries of mainland Southeast Asia represent a diverse group of countries, not all \nof  which  were  colonized,  but  which  share  a  history  of  shifting  power  groups  and  capital \nlocations. In addition, a number of minority ethnic groups straddle current international borders. \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  all  share \nborders with the PRC. All of the countries in this subregion have large numbers of citizens who \nare ethnically Chinese but whom have intermarried with local populations. \n \n118.  An  important  characteristic  of  this  subregion  is  human  migration  and  movement \nincluding  the  trafficking  of  children  and  young  women.  Rapid  change  in  the  economies  of \nSoutheast  Asia  including  the  shift  toward  market  economies  in  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \nNam, have produced geographic and other forms of inequality, stimulating migration as well as \nproviding opportunities for traffickers to earn money. These processes of human movement are \nalso  played  out  in-country,  with  migration  and  trafficking  from  rural  to  rapidly  growing  urban \nareas. While not all of those trafficked, for example, will become street children, the processes \ninvolved are similar for those who do end up on the street. The details of trafficking and other \nmigration  continues  to  be  researched  (see,  for  example,  Caouette,  undated;  Derks  1997  and \n1998a;  SCUK  2001).  It  includes  children  moving  from  Viet  Nam  into  Cambodia  as  well  as \nsouthern  PRC  (and  beyond),  from  Myanmar  to  Yunnan  Province  (PRC)  and  Thailand,  from \nCambodia  to  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand,  etc.  Reasons  for  such  movements  of  people  vary,  but \ninclude  both  economic  migration  and  large-scale  criminal  trafficking  networks,  usually \nconnected with the commercial sex trade. It has been estimated, for example, that some 20,000 \nchildren aged 3\u201316 years from Myanmar currently work in Thailand as beggars, street sellers, or \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n27\n\nrubbish  pickers,  with  many  older  girls  (i.e.,  12\u201319 years) working as sex workers (U Soe Soe \n2002). \n \n119.  Another  feature  common  to  the  countries  of  the  subregion  is  the  ever-increasing \navailability  of  a  wide  range  of  illegal  drugs  and  narcotics,  with  increasing  abuse  of  such \nsubstances  by  children  and  young  people.  Amphetamine-type  substances  are  common  in \nCambodia,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Millions  of  such  pills  are  manufactured  in  factories  along \nthe  Myanmar-Thailand  border.  Heroin  and  other  opium-based  substances  also  are  available \nand used, with established drug trafficking networks across the region and beyond. High quality \nmarijuana production also is increasing, particularly in Cambodia. Children are used to transport \ndrugs within countries as well as across borders. \n \n120.  Associated  problems  are  not  only  children\u2019s  drug  dependence  and  the  risk  of  HIV \ninfection from shared needles or other injectibles, but also that street life can make the use of \ndrugs  an  attractive  recreation  and/or  escape  from  hunger  and  the  psychosocial  difficulties \nassociated  with  life  on  the  street.  Children\u2019s  need  of  money  and  their  comparative \npowerlessness  (both  physically  and  socially)  make  them  vulnerable  to  coercion,  force,  and \nexploitation  by  adults  or  older  children.  Street  children  frequently  use  glue,  gasoline,  or  other \nreadily available solvents to provide a temporary escape from their environment.  \n \n121.  The  cycle  of  living  on  the  street,  using  drugs,  imprisonment  for  drug  use or trafficking, \nrelease, return to the street, drug use, and so on, was observed in a project in Thailand (West \n2000a).  The  links  between  some  street  children  and  drugs  are  one  cause  of  many  street \nchildren  falling  foul  of  the  law.  The  conditions  of  detention  often  further  alienate  children  from \nadults and community life, or introduce them to new forms of criminality. In Thailand a series of \nriots broke out at youth detention centers in early 2000 over living conditions and treatment of \nchildren.  \n \n122.  Children\u2019s and youths\u2019 use of drugs is another cause for their movement to the street. \nWell-off children who develop a drug dependency may steal from their families, or be thrown out \nof home as a family disgrace. \n \n123.  The  context  and  circumstances  of  street  children  in  countries  in  mainland  Southeast \nAsia  have  some  variation,  albeit  within  an  environment  of  large  numbers  of  working  children. \nFor example, in Thailand agencies speak of a second generation of street children, while in Viet \nNam the phenomenon of street children is linked to economic reform (as elsewhere, such as in \nEast and Central Asia). The Thailand experience has led some social workers to make a useful \ndistinction between temporary and permanent street children, or those who could return to their \nfamilies, and those who cannot return because of abuse or other problems. Some older children \nin Viet Nam rent shelter in small groups, funded from their earnings. In Thailand, various NGOs \nprovide  shelters  and  undertake  street  work,  using  the  principle  of  participation,  particularly \nchildren\u2019s  involvement  in  decision  making.  An  example  of  such  decision  making  is  helping \nchildren  to  decide  whether  they  should  move  from  the  street  to  a  shelter  or  other \naccommodation.  In  other  countries  in  the  subregion,  it  remains  the  practice  of  authorities  to \ncollect children and take them to an institution.  \n \n124.  While there are many commonalities, each country has its own particular circumstances \nfor street children\u2019s lives. For example, in Cambodia, children work picking rubbish on tips, often \nliving  with  their  families  who  all  depend  on  scavenging.  The  economy  of  rubbish  picking  is \ncomplex, with a hierarchy of status and variety of income opportunities (Gourley, Un, and Gray \n1997).  Cambodia  also  has  an  historical  context  of  children  working;  during  the  Khmer  Rouge \n\n\f 28\n\nregime, all children more than 5-years old were required to work (ibid). The depth of poverty in \nCambodia  has  meant  that  children  are  vulnerable  to  trafficking  as  well  as  migration  to seek \nwork. The country also has been a noted destination for sex tourism, although this problem is \nreceiving  increased  attention,  including  prevention  awareness  raising  at  the  village  level,  anti-\nchild  sex  publicity  at  airports  and  hotels,  etc.  While  such  efforts  have  contributed  to  a  wider \nunderstanding  that  sexual  exploitation  of  children  is  a  crime,  inadequate  legislation  and \nenforcement  mechanisms,  as  well  as  endemic  poverty,  have  meant  that  child  prostitution \ncontinues. Recent studies of tourism at Cambodia\u2019s Angkor Wat temple complex have shown \nthat  in  addition  to  solicitation  by  both  local  and  foreign  men,  children  also  seek  sexual \nrelationships for their livelihoods (see Nuon, Yit, and Gray 2001).  \n \n125. \nIn Viet Nam, there remain social, economic, and cultural differences between north and \nsouth,  with  a  history  of  street  children  and  widespread  drug  use  in  the  south  that  preceded \nreunification. Since the launching of the doi moi economic reform process, the focus on \u201cmaking \nmoney\u201d also has been instrumental in families splitting up. In 1995, it was estimated that there \nwere  50,000  street  children  in  Viet  Nam.  The  Government\u2019s  response  initially  focused  on \nexisting  state  institutions  established  to  deal  with  perceived  \u201cdeviants\u201d  or  people  out  of  their \ngeographic  place.  By  the  mid-1990s,  counseling  centers  were  established  by  local  NGOs, \nusually with the support of international NGOs. Provision now includes drop-in centers and open \nhouses  supported  by  the  development  of  a  profession  of  social  work. Children\u2019s participation \nalso is growing in Viet Nam, allowing children to decide whether to enter a shelter. Toward the \nend of the 1990s, the interest (and funding) of international NGOs appears to have shifted from \nstreet  children  toward  child  labor  issues.  This  shift  demonstrates  both  the  influence  of  donor \nagencies and the difficulty of mounting long-term or sustainable programs to address the street \nchildren problem.  \n \n126.  Sex  tourism,  HIV/AIDS,  and  gender  issues  are  general  problems  for  street children \nacross  the  subregion.  Increasing  numbers  of  street  children  are  contracting  HIV/AIDS  in \nCambodia,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  (particularly  in  the  south).  \u201cAIDS  orphans\u201d  have  existed  in \nThailand since the late 1980s and are increasing also in Cambodia at an alarming rate. At the \nend of 2002, Cambodia had the highest per capita rate of people living with HIV/AIDS in all of \nAsia (although it is predicted that India will soon take over this dubious distinction).  \n \n\n2. \n\nSoutheast Asian Island Nations \n\n127. \nIn  Indonesia,  political  instability,  the  1999  military  campaigns  in  Timor-Leste, and that \ncountry\u2019s subsequent independence, provide the contemporary context for street children in this \npart  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  A  1999  survey  of  12  cities  in  Indonesia found 170,000 street \nchildren  (Childhope  Asia  News  Bulletin  11  (1\u20132), from the Straits Times), a dramatic increase \nfrom  an  estimated  50,000  in  1997  (KKSP  2001).  The  numbers  of  street  children  have  been \nincreasing rapidly in northern Sumatra, trebling during 1999\u20132001 (Syamsul 2001). As of 2001, \nYogyakarta in Java had large numbers of girl street children. Some 70% of street children in this \ncity were reported to come from other parts of Indonesia. Although there are perhaps more than \nthe usual problems of counting in these figures (the KKSP report suggested that total numbers \nwould reach 100,000\u2013150,000 in 2000), there is clear agreement that the number of Indonesian \nstreet children is fast increasing. \n\n \n\n128.  Significant numbers of street children have been present in Indonesia for more than two \ndecades,  with  a  group  in  1984  developing  their  own  cooperative.  In  1992,  this  group  even \nrented a house, but were evicted just over a year later because they did not have identity cards. \nThese  were  children  separated  from  family,  but  who  needed  a  family  in  order  to  obtain  the \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n29\n\nnecessary  identity  papers  (Yanasan  Humana,  undated).  At  that  time,  street  children  were \nreported to be subject to national \u201ccleansing operations,\u201d which included detention and beatings \n(ibid). Violence by parents has been highlighted as a key reason for a child\u2019s decision to leave \nhome (ibid). \n \n129.  The  Government  refused  to  acknowledge  the  existence  of  street  children  in  Indonesia \nuntil  the  late  1990s.    A  United  Nations  Development  Programme  grant  and  an  ADB  loan \nenabled  a  drop-in  shelter  program  to  be  launched,  and  the  definition  of  street  children  was \nbroadened to include more children\u2019s circumstances (SASC 2003). The end of the 1990s saw a \nnumber of significant changes in the lives of Indonesian children generally, partly as a result of \neconomic  crises  and  other  sociopolitical  changes.  The  numbers  of  children  dropping  out  of \nschool increased and there were increasing numbers of teenage sex workers. (Kearney 2000). \nMore  than  half  of  the  children  on  Indonesian  streets  in  2000  were  reported  as  \u201cnew  entrants\u201d \nsince the beginning of the Asian economic crisis in 1997 (Dursin 2000). The major response has \ncome from international and local NGOs. These organizations see the country\u2019s main children\u2019s \nlegislation,  the  1979  Child  Welfare  Act,  as  ineffective,  with  urgent  need  for  a  new  Child \nProtection  Law  as  well  as  new  institutional  and  implementation  arrangements  within \ngovernment.  \n \n130.  The incidence of street children across Malaysia appears to have not been documented, \nalthough  one  estimate  suggests  that  peninsular  and  island  Malaysia  may  be  home  to  up  to \n75,000 street children (Austin, undated). \n \n131.  There  are  reportedly  large  numbers  of  street  children  in  the  Philippines,  although \nestimates vary widely. One report suggests 1.5 million street children (Jubilee Action, undated), \nwhile  another  suggests  only  15,000  street  working  children  (Austin,  undated).  However,  both \nreports agree that there are some 100,000 child sex workers in the country. The Department of \nSocial  Welfare  and  Development  in  1998  estimated  that  there  were  222,417  street  children  in \n65  major  cities  in  the  country  (CRB  2003).  As  elsewhere  in  the  region,  the  context  for  Filipino \nstreet children is endemic poverty\u2014more than half the country\u2019s urban population is categorized \nas  living  below  the  country\u2019s  absolute  poverty  line,  a  figure  rising  to  64%  in  some  rural  areas \naccording  to  one  report  (Jubilee  Action,  undated).  The  National  Statistics  Coordination  Board \nreported that two out of every five Filipino families are now living in poverty (CRB 2003). Poverty \nin  the  Philippines  has  been  linked  to  problems  of  \u201cstructural  adjustment,\u201d  exacerbated  by \nconcentration  of  wealth,  institutionalized  graft  and  corruption,  and  natural  disasters  that  drain \nnational  resources  (Silva  1996).  This  is  manifested  in  a  lack  of  adequate  employment \nopportunities  and  basic  services,  poor  housing  and  slums,  and  poor  law  enforcement  (CRB \n2003). \n \n132.  The  sexual  exploitation  of  children,  including  sex  tourism,  continues  to  be  a  major \nproblem in the Philippines. Filipino girls are trafficked out of the country for sex work (Son 1995). \nAt  least  one  NGO  rescues  children  from  brothels  and  other  exploitative  work  situations.  The \nincidence  of  sex  tourism  was  reported  to  be  aided  in  the  past  by  parents  in  Olongapo \nencouraging children to \u201cgo with an American,\u201d referring to naval personnel in that area (Jubilee \nAction,  undated).  Although  the  naval  base  has  since  been  closed,  the  demand  for child sex \nworkers continues. The withdrawal of US troops from the Philippines in 1992 is said to have left \nbehind some 50,000 AmerAsian children (Jubilee Action, undated). \n \nIn Timor-Leste, street children are reported to be new phenomenon, since 1999. Three \n133. \nreasons have been cited: the separation of families during the forced evacuation to West Timor; \nthe  destruction  of  many  homes  in  the  capital,  Dili;  and  the  September  1999  destruction  of  all \n\n\f 30\n\norphanages  in  the  western  part  of  Timor-Leste  (Odling-Smee  2001).  Around  1,000  street \nchildren have been reported in Dili, and two projects have been established by religious groups \nto provide some services. It has been reported that it is unlikely that the new Government or the \nUnited Nations will rebuild the country\u2019s orphanages, with orphan care left to NGOs or other civil \nsociety  groups.  In  West  Timor,  orphanages  are  said  to  exist  in  all  major  townships,  run \nprincipally by religious organizations\u2014Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim\u2014as well as some other \ngroups. \n \nD. \n\nThe Pacific \n\n134.  The situation in the Pacific varies. Urban youth are identified as a problem in Papua New \nGuinea.  There  are  large  numbers  of  homeless  children  in  neighboring  Australia.  Some  Pacific \nnations  report  no  issues  associated  with  street  children.  In  Vanuatu,  for  example,  it  was \nreported that there were no known cases of either child labor or child prostitution in the country \n(WVI  V  1999).  The  same  report,  however,  noted  that  the  \u201cissue  of  child  prostitution  is  a  new \nphenomenon and growing in the South Pacific.\u201d  \n \n135.  Research in Australia in 2002, using data from the 2001 census, found an 8% increase \nin  homeless  children  in  the  country  since  1994.  There  are  now  reported  to  be  some  26,000 \nhomeless children aged 12\u201318 years across Australia. The rate varies by State, from 69 out of \nevery 1,000 children in the Northern Territory to 10 per 1,000 in Victoria, with an overall national \naverage of 14 per 1,000. In the Northern Territory, high levels of domestic violence and family \nbreakdown  are  associated  with  the  problem  of  homelessness  (ABC  Newsonline  2002).  As \nelsewhere,  there  are  overlapping  definitions  or  categorizations  of  street  children,  including \nchildren living on the street, children living in crisis or refuge accommodation,  children living in \ntemporary  accommodation  without  security  (e.g.,  staying  with  friends),  and  children  in  unsafe \nfamily circumstances including domestic violence and abuse (Social Policy Group 2000). These \ncategories  are  somewhat  different  to  those  conventionally  applied  to  street  children,  but  are \nimportant  in  suggesting  the  range  of  child  rights  still  to  be  realized.  Service  provision  for \nhomeless young people in Melbourne, across organizations, was found to have a high turnover. \nThis  was  primarily  attributed  to  inadequate  funding,  lack  of  resources,  low  salaries,  stressful \nwork, and a lack of professional supervision (Mallet, Rosenthal, and Myers 2001). It would seem \nthat  homeless  children  in  developed  countries  also  are  publicly  stigmatized,  and  given  low \npriority for attention, much as with street children developing countries.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nFRAMEWORKS AND PRINCIPLES FOR INTERVENTION  \n\n136.  The variety of circumstances in which street children find themselves and the problems \nthey  face,  suggest  that  if  interventions  are  to  be  effective  they  need  to  be  guided  by  a  set  of \nprinciples  leading  to  a  framework  for  practice.  The  CRC  provides  a  ready  framework  for  any \nintervention  in  the  lives  of  children,  including  street  children.  The  CRC  represents  an \ninternational standard for children\u2019s rights to survival, development, protection, participation, and \nfreedom from discrimination, within an overall context of the best interests of the child.  \n \n137.  Following  the  almost  universal  ratification  of  the  CRC,  efforts  have  been  directed  to \nmonitoring  its  implementation  and  to  the  development  and  refinement  of  what  is  commonly \nreferred to as child rights programming (CRP). A CRP framework provides guidance in how to \nuse  and  implement  the  CRC  (and  other  international  instruments)  in  the  best  interests  of \nchildren  everywhere.  CRP  combines  legal-based  responses  to  international  conventions  on \nchild  and  human  rights  with  perspectives  of  childhood  and  development.  The  CRP  framework \nutilizes sociology (paradigms of childhood), cross-cultural psychology (childhood development), \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n31\n\nprovision  (care  and  protection  as  well  as  education  and  health  services),  citizenship, \ngovernance,  and  good  practice  in  the  areas  of  child  participation  and  field-based  youth  and \ncommunity  work.  Further,  CRP  uses  a  rights-based  analysis  of  the  situation  of  children  that \nseeks  to  identify  the  duty  bearers  responsible  for  protecting  and  supporting  those  rights.  The \npurpose is to recognize children as rights holders, not as passive beneficiaries. Similarly, there \nis a need for accountability for children\u2019s rights (see, for example, James and Prout 1990; Theis \n2001a and 2001b; Christensen 2002; ISCA 2002).  \n \n138.  As  signatories  to  the  CRC,  state  parties  are  required  to  bring  their  legislation  into  line \nwith its provisions. In some countries, the development of comprehensive child rights legislation \nin  still  in  process.  In  other  countries,  appropriate  legislation  is  in  place,  but  mechanisms  for \neffective  implementation  are  absent.  State  parties  too  often  lack either capacity or financial or \nother resources, such as a cadre of trained social workers. Similarly, a country\u2019s social context \nmay  be  adverse  to  the  realization  of  child  rights,  such  as  where  the  public  or  some  state \napparatus  (e.g.,  police)  continue  to  place  children  very  low  on  the  social  hierarchy.  Too  often \nstreet children, in particular, are perceived as nuisances, if not lesser beings. There is need for \nawareness raising and behavior change among adults and society as a whole to realize the full \nscope  of  children\u2019s  rights.  There  also  is  need  for  sensitization  and  training  in  a  range  of \nprofessions  including  police  and  the  judiciary.  Unfortunately,  departments  or  ministries  with \noverall  responsibility  for  children  and  children\u2019s  rights  are  often  the  weakest  and  most  under-\nresourced units in national bureaucracies. One important issue is hostility to children\u2019s rights in \nsome places, often from religious groups, but also, it seems, based on a misunderstanding of \nwhat children\u2019s rights entail. Some misconceptions are articulated in suggestions that children\u2019s \nrights are about children \u201cstaying up late and going to discos,\u201d \u201cdisrespecting others,\u201d \u201cgoing out \nand taking drugs\u201d (which are not in the CRC) rather than rights to protection from abuse, torture, \nand exploitation. Sensitization and training need to involve a variety of social groupings. \n \n139.  With respect to implementation of the CRC, two principles predominate: protection and \nparticipation.  Protection  is  fundamental  and  constitutes  the  main  reason  for  seeking \ninterventions in the lives of street children. This includes protection from abuse and exploitation, \nbut also suggests more preemptive approaches in enabling the development of children\u2019s skills \nand  knowledge,  and  in  building  support  structures  and  mechanisms  that  improve  children\u2019s \nenvironments,  making  them  safer  and  less  vulnerable.  One  aspect  of  protection  is  preventing \nchildren from moving to the street.  \n \n140.  Protection  needs  children\u2019s  participation  if  it  is  to  succeed,  just  as  any  successful \nprevention  initiatives  usually  involve  children.  Participation  means  allowing  children  to  express \ntheir views and to be involved in decision making to the extent of their capability. It should be \nobvious that street children know far more about their reasons for choosing to leave home or to \nmigrate  to  the  streets  than  anyone  else.  They  certainly  know  far  more  about  survival  and \nmaking the most of street life through a variety of coping mechanisms. And they also know what \nthey want in terms of care, reintegration, and acceptable work.  \n \n141.  A  key  aspect  of  children\u2019s  participation  is  the  right  to  information  in  order  to  make \ndecisions  about  their  own  best  interests.  Street  children  make  decisions  every  day. \nImplementing their  rights  to  information,  knowledge,  and  understanding  about  such  risks  as \nunwanted  or  unprotected  sex,  HIV/AIDS,  and  substance  and  drugs  usage,  will  assist  them  in \nmaking  safer  decisions.  Not  taking  children\u2019s  views  into  account  or  not  involving  them  in \ndecision making is one reason why many children who are forcibly returned to their families are \n\u201cback on the street before the bus that took them home.\u201d  \n  \n\n\f 32\n\nIn  many  countries,  children\u2019s  participation  is  felt  to  be  difficult,  as  a  new  practice,  and \n142. \nthere  are  fears  that  it  might  only  be  tokenistic  or  superficial.  These  fears  can  be  addressed \nthrough support and training (particularly for adults). A great deal of children\u2019s participation work \nhas been accomplished in different parts of the Asia-Pacific region, largely work with poor and \ndisadvantaged children in difficult settings.  \n \n143.  Following  the  principle  of  children\u2019s  participation  means  that  a  child\u2019s  current  situation \nand circumstances must be taken as a starting point. The CRC suggests  that the best place for \na  child\u2019s  development  is  with  his  or  her  family  (or  to  live  in  a  family-type  setting),  for  reasons \nincluding  identity,  care,  and  protection.  While  this  implies  that  separated  children  should  be \nreturned to their family as soon as possible, at least two questions need to be addressed. The \nfirst question concerns reintegration and how children might not only be reunited and resettled \nwithin the family but also reintegrated into their community and surroundings. Stigma attached \nto street children (and especially those who have been involved in sex work), together with the \nsense of freedom, personal control, and enjoyment that some children find on the street, mean \nthat their reunification may be less immediately possible than some adults expect. The second \nquestion is related: is it in children\u2019s best interests to be returned home? Adverse conditions at \nhome,  such  as  situations  of  domestic  violence  or  abuse  or  abject  poverty,  make  resettlement \ndifficult if not impossible. It is not in a child\u2019s best interest to be sent to an environment that is \ninjurious or dangerous. Children also may not know where they are from (given that some have \nsimply gotten lost, or been trafficked at an early age). Alternative forms of care, protection, and \nliving  in  other  than  a  family  environment  might  be  in  the  best  interests  of  many  children,  and \nnecessary for some, such as children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.  \n \n144.  There is some tension between the principles of protection and participation, given that \nadults\u2019 perceptions of protection and dangers may be quite different from those of children. But \nchildren\u2019s participation in protection is crucial for any intervention to be effective: what appears \nrisky and dangerous to adults (especially those with secure homes) may be negotiated safely by \nchildren.  A  clear  paradox  is  the  removal  of  a  child  from  the  street  for  his  or  her  safety,  and \nsubsequent  placement  in  a  family  home  or  other  accommodation  that  is  abusive  and \nexploitative.  In  some  cases,  children  might  be  better  off  on  the  street  because  available \nalternatives  bring  no  real  improvements  to  their  lives  (or  best  interests).  Such  decisions, \nhowever,  can  only  be  made  through  careful  analysis  of  a  child\u2019s  particular  context  with  the \nactive  participation  of  that  child,  again  according  to  his  or  her  capabilities  to  participate  in \ndecision  making.  However,  putting  into  practice  the  principle  of  best  interests  is  not  easy, \nparticularly in institutional or bureaucratic settings.  \n \n145.  The  question  of  best  interests  also  is  linked  to  ethical  practices.  Street  children  are \nvisible  and  elicit  a  diverse  range  of  reactions  from  sympathy  and  regarding  street  children  as \nvictims,  to  disgust  and  regarding  street  children  as  criminals  or  inhuman  beings.  The  CRC \ndenotes children as humans under the age of 18 years, to whom all human rights conventions \napply,  taking  into  account  the  special  circumstances  regarding  age,  but  emphasizing  their \nhumanity  and  rights,  including  respect  for  their  person,  privacy,  and  identity.  Ethical principles \nrequire respecting children\u2019s views and decisions, while taking into account their best interests. \nSuch principles also mean that street children should not to be objectified or sensationalized in \nnewspaper and other media accounts, or expected to recount their histories, or to continually be \nsubject to viewing by project visitors (even if the visitors are donors). \n \n146.  The  nature  of  provision  designed  for  street  children  also  poses  significant  challenges. \nThe most common form of provision is shelter, which may fulfil children\u2019s needs in part, but in \nfact  may  more  fulfil  adult  perceptions  of  children\u2019s  needs,  including  adult  feelings  about  the \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n33\n\nimportance of a home or not wanting children to \u201csleep rough.\u201d For a child, the main issue  may \nbe a haunting traumatic experience or family relationship breakdown, rather than nights on the \nstreet.  \n \n147.  CRP has enormous implications for the development of principles of good practice. First \nis the importance of research or careful case management to ensure that project work is based \non the reality of children\u2019s lives and circumstances rather than well-meaning assumptions. Such \nresearch  needs  to  include  and  involve  children,  with  some  of  the  research  activity  possibly \nconducted by children themselves (as has been shown to be both possible and effective). Such \nresearch  will  ensure  that  particular  contexts  or  circumstances  are  taken  into  account  and \ninclude children\u2019s own perceptions of the benefits and dangers of street life. \n \n148.  Second, the range of street children\u2019s possible circumstances means that several areas \nof practice must be addressed, both with adults and with children, and that work is not limited to \nstreet-based interventions or to the provision of shelters. As noted earlier, children\u2019s life \u201con the \nstreet\u201d  may  involve  places  other  than  the  street,  such  as  brothels,  factories,  sweatshops, \nsquatter homes, etc.  \n \n149.  Third,  the  nature  of  provision  created  for  street  children  must  be  safe,  offer  protection, \nand enable their personal development.  \n \n150.  Fourth, and linked to the question of provision, the ways in which children move on from \nthe  street,  particularly  with  respect  to  their  possible  reunification  with  family  as  well  as  their \nfuture lives, must be taken into account. \n \n151.  Highly  varied  street  circumstances  necessitate  action-based  research.  Different \ncircumstances  create  problems  of  process  and  place,  which  in  turn  create  difficulties  for \npractice.  While  there  is  a  tendency  to  focus  on  the  lives of those children who remain on the \nstreet,  such  an  approach  ignores  the  reality  of  transitions\u2014that  street  children\u2019s  lives  are  not \nstatic, and that street children respond to opportunities and constraints, to coercion, and to their \nown growing older.  A  clear  difficulty  is  mediating  varying  responses  to  individuals  and  groups \nthrough constraints of staffing and overall resources of projects, as well as the local context.  \n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nMETHODS OF IMPLEMENT ATION \n\n152.  Given the range of issues associated with street children and principles of good practice, \na  number  of  areas  of  work  can  be  identified  within  three  broad  categories:  prevention; \ninterventions  on  the  street;  and  helping  children  move  on  from  situations  of  risk,  abuse,  or \nexploitation.  \n \nA. \n\nPrevention \n\n153.  Prevention  strategies  cover  a  wide  area,  including  public  awareness  raising,  capacity \nbuilding, and financial or other support to poor families to enable their children to stay at home. \nStrategies  need  to  be  linked  to  harm  reduction  so  that  children  are  better  equipped  to  make \ninformed  decisions  about  their  own  best  interests.  Peer  education  has  proven  a  particularly \neffective  means  of  raising  awareness  about  child  rights,  as  well  as  the  threats  confronting \nchildren.  Public  discussion  about  the  core  principles  of  child  rights  and  information  about \ntrafficking  mechanisms  similarly  can  help  reduce  the  incidence  of  trafficking  as  well  as  other \nsituations of abuse or exploitation. In addition to work with children, prevention methods require \nwork  with  adults  at  all  levels,  including  families,  communities,  community  leaders,  teachers, \n\n\f 34\n\npolice  and  the  judiciary,  and  other  government  institutions.  Increased  knowledge  of  children\u2019s \nrights is an important starting point, but the work also must include information about the reality \nof life in cities, including the risk of trafficking.  \n \n154.  Prevention can require behavioral changes regarding, for example, parenting styles and \nsupport for children to stay in school\u2014which may require changes to the education system and \nschools  so  that  children  are  able  to  attend,  want  to  attend,  and  find  schooling  both  enjoyable \nand  useful.  In  many  developing  countries  in  the  region,  this  might  mean  more  flexible  school \ncalendars  to  allow  children  to  assist  their  families  during  planting  or  harvesting  seasons\u2014a \nbroadening of the current notion of \u201cchild-friendly schools.\u201d  \n \nB. \n\nInterventions on the Street \n\n155.  Establishing  and  maintaining  contact  with  street  children  is  the  starting  point  for \ninterventions.  An  immediate  removal  from  the  street  might  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the \nchild.  Harm  reduction  and  child  protection  are  twin  basic  strategies  that  can  be  applied.  For \nexample, it may not be possible to stop street children from having sex or being involved in sex \nwork  in  the  short  term,  but  the  associated  risks  can  be  reduced  easily  through  appropriate \ncounseling  (including  by  peer  educators).  The  same  can  be  done  with  substance  use,  where \nharm  reduction  involves  knowledge  about  the  effects  of  drugs  and  promoting  their  safe  (or \nsafer) use as a means of aiding street children\u2019s survival and potential future development. \n \n156.  Children\u2019s rights to health care and education can be addressed by taking into account \ntheir current circumstances and offering service provision on the street or in close proximity to \nwhere  they  live  and  work,  and  at  times  and  in  places  which  are  accessible  to  street  children. \nThis  might  entail  \u201cstreet  work\u201d  methods  including  both  outreach  and  detached  teams  making \ndirect  contact  with  street  children.  Work  in  street  situations  also  might  include  helping  and \nsupporting the development of children\u2019s own organizations. \n \n157.  Whereas outreach work generally involves teams of staff operating from drop-in centers \nand  shelters,  detached  work  takes  provision  such  as  healthcare  and  education  to  children \nwhere they are on the street. While outreach workers may work with children on the street, they \nalso offer possibilities for the use of other facilities, including residential accommodation. Efforts \nalso are required to address the needs and rights of children in sensitive or generally invisible \nareas, such as domestic servants or commercial sex workers. Principles of protection and harm \nreduction must be involved where \u201crescue\u201d is not possible or would lead to children shifting to \neven worse circumstances or more exploitative situations. Encouraging children to help decide \nwhat is in their own best interests is essential. \n \n158. \nIn order to establish contact and make service provision  available, drop-in centers need \nto be open at appropriate times for children, respecting their working day and lives. The same \ntenet of accessibility applies to both outreach and detached work \n \n159.  Part of street work, either through detached teams or drop-in centers, includes ensuring \nthat  children  have  the  opportunity  to  access  available  services  including  medical  and  hospital \nservices; training and education including literacy, numeracy, and vocational skills; legal aid and \nadvice; and refuges at times of risk or danger. \n \nC. \n\nLeaving the Street and Moving On \n\n160. \nIn order for children to successfully move on from the street they need to be involved in \ndecision  making  about  the  opportunities  available  to  them.  Returning  to  their  families  often \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n35\n\nrequires more than transport, and may entail some preparation of both children and family, as \nwell  as  support  for  reintegration  into  families  and  communities.  \u201cMoving  on\u201d  expresses  both \nphysical  and  emotional  progress,  and  encompasses  a  range  of  processes  and  possible \ndestinations, with some consideration given to the child\u2019s best interests for the future.  \n \n161.  Several  steps  may  be  required  in  the  process  of  \u201cmoving  on\u201d  including  provision  of \ntemporary accommodation when children are not able to return to families, or alternative care, \nsuch  as  foster  families.  For  older  children  who  may  be  moving  on  to  independent  life, \nconsiderable preparation may be required through appropriate training to enable them to earn a \nliving  off  the  street.  An  important  principle  is  that  such  vocational  or  skills  training  be  realistic, \ngiven economic and work opportunities actually available in a particular country or setting. \n \nIn the process of moving on, shelters for street children are a widespread component of \n162. \npractice,  based  on  the  notion  (mostly  by  adults)  of  returning  children  to  settled  life.  Shelters \nshould  involve  children  in  their  design  and  daily  operation.  Shelters  need  to  be  appropriate  to \nthe local economic conditions in order that they do not attract additional children, or that parents \nmight send their children to such shelters as a way of providing their children with education or \nhealthcare,  or  simply  to  relieve  the  costs  of  care.  That  shelters  can  provide  better  conditions \nthan ordinary home life is one reason why other causal factors need to be addressed, such as \nsupport for poor families to be able to keep and provide for their children at home. In addition, \nshelters need to avoid the \u201cinstitutionalization\u201d of children, which reduces their competency and \ncompromises their opportunities for future independence. This can be done by setting minimum \nstandards, and children\u2019s participation in the organization and day-to-day running of shelters or \nany residential care.  \n \n163.  Shelters must not be seen as final \u201cends\u201d for children but rather part of a longer process \nof moving on, which means also moving back into community life. Children and young people \nwho have been away from communities, or enter new places but whose past is known, are often \nstigmatized  because  of  real  or  perceived  involvement  in  sex  work.  Again,  principles  of \nparticipation are important, with the recognition that it may be difficult for some children to be off \nthe street. Forcing or coercing children to live in residential or other accommodation often fails. \n \nD. \n\nGeneral \n\n164.  The question of support to families is linked to prevention and to antipoverty initiatives. \nThese  might  work  on  two  levels,  individual  development  and  social-structural  change.  A \ndiscussion  of  antipoverty  initiatives  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper,  but  clearly  includes  the \nuse of vocational or skills training to enable children and families to generate income on the one \nhand,  and  links  into  broader  structural  concerns  such  as  the  use  of  taxes,  anticorruption \ninitiatives,  and  issues  of  good  governance  on  the  other.  Other  elements  include  capacity \nbuilding on children\u2019s rights, on child protection issues, and on how to work with children. Other, \nmore  general,  needs  are  coordination  of  services,  the  establishment  of  standards,  the \nimplementation of existing legislation, and the promulgation of new child protection laws that are \nmore in accordance with the CRC.  \n \n165.  There  are  many  crosscutting  elements \nintervention.  The \ndevelopment  of  reflective  practice,  that  is  analyzing  development  and  current  activities  in  the \ncontext of the environment, means that some attention must be paid to current, urgent issues, \nsuch as HIV/AIDS.  \n \n\nthe  principles \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\f 36\n\n166.  Finally,  research  is  an  important  part  of  practice,  particularly  when  used  to  establish \nbaselines  against  which  the  impact  of  an  intervention  can  be  measured.  Research  also  is \nfundamental  in  better  understanding  the  lives  of  street  children  and  in  designing  appropriate \ninterventions.  The  involvement  of  children  in  research  activities  increasingly  is  regarded  as \nfundamental,  although  in  some  countries  such  practice  is  still  comparatively  new.  Whereas \nmerely asking children questions is seen as innovative in some countries, in others it is taken for \ngranted  that  child  input  can  guide  or  inform  all  aspects  of  the  research  process,  and  that \nchildren may be able to assist in conducting research. \n \n \n\nVII. \n\nPRACTICE AND EXAMPLES \n\n167.  There  are  numerous  examples  of  good  practice  in  projects  across  the  As ia-Pacific \nregion, although it must be recognized that individual projects cannot address every aspect of a \nstreet child\u2019s life. Rather, approaches usually are limited to particular issues, such as health or \neducation,  children  and  work,  children  and  drugs,  and  trafficking.  Figure  VII.1  provides  an \nindicative list of necessary practice areas relating to street children.  \n\n \n168.  The  following  section  provides  some  examples  of  good  practice  from  the  Asia-Pacific \nregion.  \n \nA. \n\nParticipation \n\n169.  The  practice  of  children\u2019s  participation  is  uneven  across  the  region,  and  probably  best \ndeveloped  in  parts  of  South  Asia  and  the  Philippines.  Preparations  for  the  May  2002  United \nNations  Special  Session  on  Children  featured  child  participation.  While  such  activity  is \nimportant, particularly in popularizing the notion that the voices of children are important, one-off \npromotional  events  often  detract  from  the  need  for  children\u2019s  ongoing  involvement  in  decision \nmaking  in  family  and  community  and  daily  life.  In  addition,  such  opportunities  rarely  extend  to \npoor or vulnerable children, including street children. Well known examples of child participation \ninclude children\u2019s unions in India (Box VII.1), the Child-Brigade in Bangladesh (see Box VII.1), \nand  the  street  children  \u201cButterflies\u201d  project  in  India  (Box  VII.2).  Other  examples  include  the \nchildren\u2019s  clubs  of  Nepal  (a  series  of  projects  for  all  children\u2014see  Rajbhavidary,  Hart,  and \nKhatiwarda  1999),  and  children\u2019s  involvement  in  decision  making  in  connection  with  making a \nmove to shelters in Thailand (Foundation for a Better Life for Children).  \n \nB. \n\nStandards, Cooperation, and Coordination \n\n170.  The setting of national standards for provision has been undertaken by many developed \ncountries as well as by some Asian States. The establishment of such standards is linked to the \ndevelopment  of  legislation  and  the  coordination  of  services.  In  the  PRC,  the  Ministry  of  Civil \nAffairs has begun the development of standards of care. In Thailand, new legislation for children \nwas developed by 2000. While cooperation and multisectoral working are in evidence in some \ncountries  (see  examples  in  ESCAP,  Undated),  there  are  many  gaps  and  issues  that  require \nfurther attention. Research, certain prevention initiatives, development of street work, provision \nof  temporary  accommodation,  and  education  and  vocational  training  are  more  advanced. \nCapacity building has been an integral part of most good projects, if only to train project staff in \nways of communicating and working with children. In some countries, effort has been directed to \nthe development of social work and related professions including the establishment of university \ncourses,  for  example,  Save  the  Children,  UK\u2019s  support  of  a  social  work  course  at  the  State \nPedagogical University in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n37\n\n \nFigure VII.1: Street Children\u2014Basic Areas of Practice \n \n \nGeneral \n\n \n \n\n           \u2022  protection     \n           \u2022  standard setting \n\n \n       \u2022  participation    \n       \u2022  research         \n       \u2022  monitoring and evaluation           \u2022  capacity building of organizations \n       \u2022  training of staff \n       \u2022  partnerships     \n       ?  law \n       ?  advocacy and awareness raising \n \n\n           \u2022  multisectoral working \n           ?  coordination and regulation     \n           ?  budgets \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPrevention \n\n \n\n?  family violence and \n   abuse \n\n       ?  poverty reduction \n       ?  schools \n       ?  community  \n          awareness \n       ?  antitrafficking \n       ?  sex tourism \n       ?  transport \n       ?  life skills \n       ?  substance abuse \n       ?  reproductive health \n       ?

It  enables  children  to  gain  strength  from  their  unity  and  increases  their  bargaining \npower.  The  Union  is  concerned  with  the  situations  of  abuse,  exploitation,  and/or  denial  of  basic \nfundamental rights, such as the right to a childhood, education, recreation, leisure, shelter, health care, \nthe  right  to  respect,  and  opportunities  to  participate  in  policies  and  programs  affecting  children. \nThrough  their  Union,  the  children  also  seek  to  mobilize  public  opinion  to  redress  conditions  and \npressures  that  force  them  to  work  including  the  situation  of  poverty  and  unemployment  of  their \nfamilies.  The  Bal  Mazdoor  Union  in  its  various  collective  actions  has  also  highlighted the situation of \nchildren  in  this  larger  context  and  has  held  adults  accountable  when  children\u2019s  rights  have  been \nseverely violated. For example, in 1994 the Union brought to the attention of people the callous death \nof 15-year-old Zaffar Imam by his employer. In this case, the Union, through its dialogue with the Chief \nMinister of Delhi, was able to change the charge from attempted murder to murder. Further, on behalf \nof the child\u2019s parents, the Union filed a case in the Delhi High Court for compensation.  \n  \nSource:  O\u2019Kane 2002. \n \nChild Brigade, Dhaka, Bangladesh \n \n\nChild  Brigade  is  an  organization  that  started  in  Dhaka  in  1995  as  a  pilot  project  of  Save  the \nChildren,  Sweden.  Child  Brigade  since  has  become  an  established  and  well  known  organization  its \nown  right.  Its  motto  is  \u201cBe  Together  and  Organized.\u201d  Child  Brigade  also  strives  to  improve  the \ncircumstances of street children. The children of Child Brigade seek to participate at all levels in issues \naffecting them. \n \n\nA  core  group,  elected  by  a  wider  group  of  street  children,  bears  responsibility  for  carrying  out \nthe  organization\u2019s  activities.  Any  street  child  aged  10\u201316  years  who  is  willing  to  follow  the  rules  and \nregulations  of  Child  Brigade  can  become  a  member.  Members  have  opportunities  for  training  and \npersonal  development,  education,  health  care,  space  to  leave  belongings,  and  some  income-\ngenerating  activities.  Child  Brigade  also  organizes  a  street  and  social  networking  program  to  raise \nawareness  among  street  children  through  a  group  training  process.  The  organization  reaches  out  to \nsome  400  street  and  working  children  through  6  contact  points  in  the  city.  Through  drama  and \n\u201cBabloo,\u201d their own literacy kit, Child Brigade involves street children in discussions on issues affecting \nthem, on child rights, and on literacy and numeracy. Child Brigade has published its own book, Amra,  \nbased  on  the  observations  of  street  children,  and  has  produced  a  series  of  posters  highlighting  the \nproblems facing street children in Bangladesh. \n \nChild  Brigade  members  have  made  linkages  with  street  children  involved  in  other  projects  and  with \nchild  rights  activists.  For  example,  Child  Brigade  members  played  an  active  role  in  discussions  and \nactions  related  to  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  Special  Session  on  Children,  together with a \nwider  forum  of  children  from  other  NGOs  and  children\u2019s  organizations.  Child  Brigade  recently  formed \npartnerships with an adult human rights organization (Adhikar) as well as with a group of journalists. In \naddition  to  helping  to  sensitize  the  wider  public  in  Bangladesh  about  the  abuse  and  exploitation  of \nchildren,  Child  Brigade  has  helped  to  establish  a  \u201cmonitoring  cell\u201d  that  provides  street  children  with \nimmediate, free legal assistance.  \n \nSource: O\u2019Kane 2002. \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n39\n\nBox VII.2: The Butterflies of  New Delhi \n\nThe Butterflies Organization of Street and Working Children has been working with children on \nthe streets of New Delhi since 1988. Through a team of street educators, the organization is in contact \nwith  approximately  700  children  at  9  contact  points  where  there  are  concentrations  of  street  and \nworking children. Butterflies\u2019 general objectives are to empower street children with the knowledge and \nskills necessary to protect their rights as children and develop as respected and productive citizens; to \nprovide  such  children  with  necessary  support  and  assistance  for  reinstatement  in  their  families  where \npossible; and to use the CRC as a major tool for ensuring government and public accountability for the \nwell-being of all vulnerable children. \n \n\nButterflies  believes  in  the  principles  of  democracy  and  community  participation  in  decision \nmaking.  Every  fortnight,  children  of  each  contact  point  hold  a  meeting  to  discuss  issues,  critique \nongoing  activities,  plan  future  activities,  etc.  Once  a  month,  representatives  from  each  contact  point \ncome  together  for  the  Bal  Sabha  (Children\u2019s  Council,  the  supreme  body  and  the  guiding  force  and \nmechanism  of  the  Butterflies  program).  The  children  elect  a  chairperson  and  a  minute  taker.  Each \nmember is encouraged to share any agenda issues, and each of the outlined points is discussed, with \nkey  decisions  recorded.  Most  often,  the  issues  concern  police  harassment,  nonpayment  of  wages, \nneed for better jobs, wages, education, saving schemes, problems of gambling or drugs, and planning \npicnics and other outings. \n \n\nThe  meetings  enable  children  to  discuss  and  share  information  that  concerns  their  lives,  to \nanalyze  various  social  and  political  events  and  decisions,  and  to  work  together  toward  collective \naction.  It  has  helped  in  refining  Butterflies  program  interventions,  as  well  as  helping  to  organize \nchildren  and  create  a  forum  where  they  can  speak  and  share  their  ideas.  The  idea  of  a  Children\u2019s \nCouncil provides a concrete mechanism for children\u2019s collective voice to be heard.  \n\n \nButterflies  also  helped  launch  children-planned  initiatives.  For  example,  in  1989,  children \nstarted their own Butterflies Restaurant as a training venture as well as to provide subsidized meals to \nother street children. In 1991, children formed their own Child  Workers Union (Bal Mazdoor Union, Box \nVII.1)  and  in  1996,  children  established  a  media  group  called  \u201cBal  Mazdoor  ki  Awaz\u201d  (Child  Workers\u2019 \nVoice)  that  produces  a  regular  wall  newspaper  on  issues  affecting  children.  In  2000,  a  Children\u2019s \nHealth  Cooperative  was  established.  All  these  initiatives  were  the  outcomes  of  children\u2019s  collective \nresponse to Bal Sabha discussions.  \n\n \n\nSource:  O\u2019Kane 2002. \n \n \n \nC.        Protection \n \n171.  Child  protection  usually  has  been  linked  more  to  issues  of  protection  from  abuse or \nexploitation rather than the broader remit of social protection. Increasingly, child protection looks \nbeyond  physical  protection  to  the  varied  circumstances  and  reasons  why  children  are  at  risk. \nCollaborative  and  multisectoral  working,  the  coordination  of  services,  and  partnerships  are \nplaying important parts in the wider protection of children\u2019s rights.  \n \n172. \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  for  example,  national  coordination  has  been  developed  through  the \nNational Child Protection Authority (PEACE, undated). In Pakistan, a lawyers\u2019 organization has \ndeveloped  partnerships  with  other  groups  focusing  on  legal  aid,  awareness  raising  on  child \nabuse,  and  policy  input  (LHRLA,  undated).  The  Philippines  has  developed  a  multisectoral \napproach to case management in the area of sexual exploitation of children (DSWD, undated).  \n \n\n\f 40\n\n173.  Another example of a broad approach to protection is found in Bangladesh, through the \nBangladesh  Shishu  Adikar  Forum.  This  is  a  national  network  of  130  NGOs  that  are  actively \ninvolved in  child  rights  activities,  with  the  objective  of  establishing  a  social  environment  that \n\u201crespects,  promotes  and  protects  the  rights  of  children\u2026where  the  child  is  free  of  abuse, \ndiscrimination  and  exploitation  irrespective  of  her  nationality,  religion,  caste,  color  or  religion\u201d \n(CSC  2002).  The  Forum\u2019s  activities  include  interagency  networking,  coordination,  capacity \nbuilding, and lobbying. \n \n174.  The problem of sex tourism has also led to protection initiatives including research (such \nas that of World  Vision in Cambodia\u2014see Gray, Gourley, and Paul 1996; Chuan Wathuana et \nal.  2002).  Work  with  and  within  the  tourism  industry  on  training  for  prevention  has  been \nundertaken by ECPAT Australia, including \u201cchild-wise tourism\u201d in addition to programs (\u201cchoose \nwith care\u201d) to prevent known child sex offenders from joining organizations working with children \n(ECPAT  Australia,  undated).  Other  initiatives  have  included  the  implementation  of  child \nprotection policies within international NGOs, such as Save the Children, UK. \n \n175.  NGOs also have undertaken training and rights awareness activities with police, such as \nin  antitrafficking  partnerships.  One  NGO,  Helpline  International,  is  attempting  to  provide \nvulnerable children and street children with information  and services of which they can avail, as \nwell as a crisis line for assistance (Box VII.3). \n \n \n\nBox VII.3: Child Helpline International \n\nThe  NGO  Child  Helpline  International  aims  for  a  global  network  of  telephone  and  outreach \n\n \n \nservices for children and young people.  \n \n\nAs  of  2002,  there  were  some  38  help  lines  for  children  in  different  countries.  A  children\u2019s \ntelephone  help  line  is  accessible  and  free  of  charge  to  children  around  the  clock,  enabling  them  to \ncontact  someone  in  an  emergency  situation.  Children\u2019s  help  lines  allow  children  to  directly  express \ntheir concerns on issues affecting them. Child Helpline International believes that children have rights \nand  that  children  can  identify  the  problems  that  confront  them.  A  telephone  help  line  ensures  that \nchildren  have  access  to  assistance  whenever  they  want  and  also  provides  a  platform  for  the \ncommunity to partner in protecting children.  \n \n\nThe  experience  of  help  lines  across  the  world  includes  listening  to  children,  responding  to \ncrisis situations, networking amongst organizations working with children, and generating data to feed \ninto  government  policies.  Children  in  need  of  care  and  protection  often  are  unaware  of  services \navailable to them, or do not have easy access to such services.  \n \n\nHelp  lines  could  provide  24-hour  service  for  children  and  young  persons  in  emergency \nsituations  and  include  a  range  of  media,  such  as  telephone  (fixed  line  and  mobile  telephones,  text \nmessaging),  internet,  band  radio,  and  mail  (including  free  post).  The  target  groups  are  the  most \nmarginalized groups of children in developing countries.  \n \n\n \n\nSource: Abridged from Childline 2002. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n41\n\nResearch \n\nD. \n \n176.  Research is required to identify issues of children\u2019s rights that remain unmet, as well as \nto  address  the  question  of  who  are  duty  bearers  and  how  they  can  fulfil  their  responsibilities. \nSuch  effort  should  lead  to  development  of  standards  and  the  regulation  and  coordination  of \nservices\u2014all of which are major gaps in the realization of children\u2019s rights.  \n \n177.  Research  also  is  necessary  to  understand  the  complexities  of  local  situations  and  the \ncircumstances  of  children,  to  give  a  more  accurate  idea  of  the  scale  of  the  problems  to  be \nconfronted. In development work and other practice, research ideally is undertaken first in order \nto  provide  a  \u201cbaseline\u201d  against  which  to  measure  future  development.  But  in  some  situations \nand contexts it is not possible to undertake preliminary research. In addition, the usefulness of \nextensive  baseline  research  for  the  measurement  of  change  has been questioned because of \nthe  nature  of  social  change  and  issues  relating  to  what  exactly  influences  attitudinal  or \nbehavioral change. Research in this area is more often used as part of a process for monitoring \nand evaluating the effectiveness and use of specific interventions. \n \n178.  There is a need to investigate the multiple areas in which street children find themselves. \nIn  Cambodia,  for  example,  World  Vision  has  conducted  research  not  only  on  sex  tourism, \nmentioned  above,  but  also  on  life  on  rubbish  dumps  and  child  labor  as  a  way  of  promoting \nbetter understanding of the range of issues confronting vulnerable children. There also is a need \nto understand local complexities in order to consider and design appropriate interventions. For \nexample,  the  hierarchy  of  status  and  variety  of  income  opportunities  in  rubbish  picking  in \nCambodia has been shown to be far more complicated than cursory observation would suggest \n(see  Gourley,  Un,  and  Gray  1997).  In  Uzbekistan,  research  indicated  the  particular  problems \nand circumstances of children sleeping in residential care but working on the streets during the \ndaytime  (Tahlil  2002).  In  Afghanistan,  a  study  on  street  children  in  a  disaster  or  postconflict \nemergency  situation  provided  the  basis  for  planning  interventions,  especially  by  revealing  the \nextent of ongoing family links (see, for example, TdH 2002). \n \n179.  Research, particularly participatory action research, has been used to identify problems \nand initiatives. This type of research has been used in \u201ccross-border projects\u201d in Southeast Asia \nand  the  PRC  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  trafficking  (for  example,  Caouette,  undated;  SCUK \n2001).  Such  work  has  been  very  effective  in  promoting  awareness  about  trafficking.  But \nunderlying issues such as poverty, abuse, discrimination, and exclusion, all need to be tackled \nto prevent children\u2019s drift away from home. \n \n180.  An  important  development  in  the  research  agenda  has  been  the  active  participation  of \nchildren in research as well as children\u2019s own research (Box VII.4). Such research has brought \nnew  insights  into  children\u2019s  situations  and  the  processes  needed  to  realize  children\u2019s  rights. \nAdults,  including  those  with  much  experience  of  work  with  street  children,  have  expressed \nsurprise at some findings, with children highlighting issues not otherwise seen as important. For \nexample,  street  children  in  Bangladesh  highlighted  the  problems  they  experienced  in  playing \noutside  because  of  police  harassment  and  the  attitude  of  the  general  public  (see  Khan  1997; \nWest 1999). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 42\n\n \n\n \n\nBox VII.4: Children\u2019s Own Research \nShoshur Bari and street children\u2019s research in Dhaka, Bangladesh \n\nSince 1997, street children in Bangladesh have conducted research with support and help by \nadults. The \u201cShoshur Bari\u201d research focused on street children who, at some stage of their lives, came \ninto  contact  with  law-enforcing  agents,  which  resulted  either  in  their  being  taken  into  custody  or \nincarcerated  in  jail  or  a  home  for  vagrants.  There  were  14  children  in  the  research  group,  comprising \nboth  boys  and  girls.  The  research  took  place  over  six  months.  Uniquely,  the  children  were  given  the \nauthority  and  space  within  broad  parameters  to  decide  specific  research  issues  and  various  methods \nfor  accumulating \nfindings  and \nrecommendations.  Interviews  were  also  taken  of  lawyers,  magistrates,  government  officials,  police \npersonnel,  jail  officials,  and  former  and  current  child  and  adult  prisoners.  The  adult  core  team \nmembers then carried out interviews with a similar sample group to strengthen the children\u2019s research \nfindings. \n \n\nidentifying,  analyzing,  and  prioritizing  key \n\ninformation,  and \n\nThe  study  described  the  stages  through  which  children  often  leave  home  and  how  they  often \nend up in jail. Maltreatment by family members emerged as the major cause of children leaving home. \nOn  the  street,  they  often  are  picked  up  by  police,  usually  without  any  specific  case  or  warrant,  and \nbecome  victims  with  no  recourse  to  legal  representation.  Police  have  various  tactics  to  apprehend \nstreet children, usually intensified  during the eve of hartal [strike] days on account of \u201cstreet violence,\u201d \nas  described  by  the  children.  Under  custody,  children  experience  physical  and  psychological  abuse \nfrom  the  police,  and  when  taken  to  court,  are  not  properly  represented,  leading  to  their  indefinite \ndetention in jail without any follow-up for release. In jail and shelter homes, they suffer a denial of the \nbasic necessities of life as well as egregious violations of their human rights.  \n \n\nThe  child  researchers  also  developed  recommendations  to  improve  the  situation  of  street \nchildren  in  detention:  stopping  police  from  apprehending  children  without  specific  charge,  the \nestablishment  of  alternative  center(s)  exclusively  for  child  detainees,  stopping  abuse  of  children  by \nfamily  members  at  home,  treating  street  children\u2019s  situation  with  special  consideration,  and  effective \nNGO  involvement  to  ensure  the  protection  and  well-being  of  street  children.  In  support  of  these \nrecommendations, the children suggested certain advocacy measures, including meetings with senior \ngovernment  officials  and  NGO  representatives  as  well  as  holding  press  conferences  and  producing \ntelevision features on street children issues.  \n\n \n\nSource:  Khair and Khan 2000. \n \n \n \n\nE. \n\nPrevention \n\nlevels  and \n\nincludes  advocacy  at  different \n\n181.

This  type  of  work  has  been  very  successful  in  the  western  PRC,  in  reducing  the \nnumbers of children migrating or being trafficked eastwards. The style of advocacy and training, \nhowever, must fit local conditions and culture\u2014mass meetings were used, inter alia, in western \nPRC,  but  they  might  not  be  as  effective  elsewhere.  Other  examples  of  prevention  work  in  the \nPRC are given in Box VII.5.

The  focus included rescued women and \ngirls,  mobile  children  and  youth  under  18,  children  within  the  community,  and  community  members  in \ngeneral.  Among  the  activities  used  was  the  singing  of  mountain  folk  and  popular  songs  revolving \naround  the  subject  of  trafficking,  production  of  Sansun  Village\u2019s  2002  Prevention  of  Trafficking  in \nWomen  and  Children  Calendar,  and  the  knitting  of  a  fabric  poster  on  the  same  subject  in  the  style  of \nthe  Hani  people  by  persons  from  the  Bamu  Village  Office  (a  grassroots-level  administrative  district), \nSancun Administrative Village. A video recording (VCD) of community-based activities at project sites \nin  Honghe  was  produced  with  strong  support  from  the  Honghe  Prefecture  PSB,  Honghe  County \nWomen\u2019s  Federation,  and  Honghe  County  Bureau  of  Culture.  The  VCD  was  shown  on  the  Honghe \nPrefecture TV station as part of the program \u201cTwenty Minute Police Forum\u201d and had significant social \nimpact.  \n \n\nIn  Wenshan  Prefecture,  project  objectives  included  engaging  in  projects  that  benefited  the \ncommunity  as  a  whole,  improving  the  organizational  skills  and  self-determination  of  community \nmembers  (especially  women);  bringing  about  community-wide  participation;  increasing  trafficking \nprevention awareness and skills among community members; and making the village into a \u201ctrafficking \nprevention civilized village\u201d involving interdepartmental cooperation.   The responsibilities and functions \nof  the  different  organizations  were  established  and  village  laws  drafted  with  the  support  of  the \nGuangnan  County  PSB  and  Women\u2019s  Federation,  the  Nanping  Township  Government,  the  Women\u2019s \nHouse, Village Protection Brigade, and the Villagers\u2019 Team. \n \n\nTo  the  northwest,  in  Xinjiang,  the  provincial  Street  Children  Protection  Center  involved  the \nJustice  Bureau,  Civil  Affairs  Bureau,  the  Women\u2019s  Federation,  and  the  University and Social Science \nAcademy,  again  with  the  support  of  Save  the  Children,  UK,  in  providing  training  on  children\u2019s  rights, \nparenting  and  children\u2019s  issues,  awareness-raising  workshops  on  trafficking  and  urban  life,  and \nparticipatory action research. The collaboration was repeated around the province and included mass \nmeetings in local languages. In addition, much use was made of local television. Apparently as a result \nof the project, the numbers of street children coming from Xinjiang Province dropped significantly over \nthe following year. \n \nSource: He Ye 2001. \n \n \n182.  Prevention  work  must  be  undertaken  in  different  places  and  in  different  ways,  just  as \nchildren  become  vulnerable  or  at  risk  in  different  ways,  and  at  different  times  in  their  lives. \nFamilies, schools, and communities are important starting places, but other kinds of prevention \nwork  are  required.  At  present,  statutory  social  welfare  services  either  do  not  exist,  or  are  very \nunevenly distributed. Some projects have looked to community awareness raising and training \nin different areas, but this work needs also to be linked to issues of poverty. \n \n183.  Thus,  prevention  work  should  include  poverty  reduction  strategies  including  income \ngeneration and skills training. Thailand offers an interesting example of preventative training of \nvulnerable girls from poor communities (Box VII.6). Schools are a fundamental part of children\u2019s \nlives;  making  education  free  and  friendly  is  an  important  contribution  toward  prevention  and \nreducing children\u2019s vulnerability. \n  \n\n\f 44\n\n \n\nBox VII.6: The Youth Career Development Program, Thailand \n \n\nThe  Youth  Career  Development  Program  has  contributed  toward  a  reduction  in  commercial \nsexual exploitation of children by giving girls aged 17 to 20 employment training for the hotel and travel \nindustry.  The  girls  are  selected  from  provinces  in  northern  and  northeastern  Thailand.  The  target \nprovinces  are  among  the  poorest  in  Thailand  and  have  the  lowest  levels  of  nonagricultural \nemployment.  Social  pressures,  parental  expectations,  poverty,  and  a  lack  of  educational  and \nemployment  opportunities  can  put  girls  at  risk  of  economic  and  sexual  exploitation.  Each  year \nthousands  of  young  women  flock  to  Bangkok  and  other  urban  areas  in  search  of  work.  Many  young \nwomen  without  appropriate  skills  end  up  working  in  bars,  massage  parlors,  and  brothels.  Some  girls \nare even sold into prostitution by parents and relatives, and in several areas of northern Thailand it has \nbecome  acceptable  to  encourage  daughters  to  enter  commercial  sex  work.  The  Thai  Government \nestimates that 20,000\u201340,000 girls under the age of 18 are engaged in commercial sex work. \n \n\nThe  Pan  Pacific  Hotel  in  Bangkok  and  the  Child  Protection  Section  of  UNICEF  Thailand \nworked  together  to  develop  the  program,  which  uses  the  hotel\u2019s  expertise  in  human  resources \ndevelopment  to  provide  disadvantaged  young  girls  with  the  skills  to  work  in  the  hotel  and  travel \nindustry.  UNICEF  finances  the  girls\u2019  stay  in  Bangkok  and  their  transportation  to  and  within  the  city.  It \nalso  organizes  child  rights  training  and  coordinates  the  activities  of  a  number  of  other  partners,  such \nas the Thai Ministry of Education and NGOs. The Pan Pacific Bangkok coordinates the activities of 17 \nother  hotels  participating  in  the  project.  The  course  covers  hotel  service  and  life  skills  and  lasts  22 \nweeks. The hotel service component is taught by department heads and supervisors from participating \nhotels  and  includes  housekeeping,  laundry,  floral  arrangement,  food  preparation,  and  food  and \nbeverage services. \n \nBy  providing  vocational  and  life  skills  training,  the  program  ensures  long-term  social  and \n \neconomic  security  for  young  girls  otherwise  at  risk  of  economic  and  sexual  exploitation.  When  the \nprogram  was  first  launched  in  1995,  it  had  nine  participants.  A  year  later,  the program expanded to \ninclude  five  other  hotels  with  a  total  of  35  participants.  The  program  since  has  grown  to  involve  18 \nhotels and has trained a total of 450 young women from 17 provinces.  \n \n Source: Panpac/UNICEF, undated. \n \n \n184.  Prevention initiatives need also to include issues of gender, disability, and ethnicity that \ncontribute toward children\u2019s vulnerability. In South Asia, there are many projects working against \nviolence  toward  girl  children,  as  well  as  projects  focusing  on  disabled  children.  While  not \nnecessarily undertaken to prevent children coming onto the street, such work has impact on the \ncontext  of  children\u2019s  lives  and  the  opportunities  that  correlate  with  the  development  of \ncircumstances  of  risk  and  vulnerability.  Prevention  initiatives  may  also  include  ensuring  the \nprovision of identity papers for children and their registration with authorities.  \n \nF. \n\nStreet Work \n\n185.  There  are  many  kinds  of  street  work,  such  as  providing  education  on  the  street  at \ndesignated  times  and  places,  or  in  drop-in  centers,  helping  children  without  formal  identity \npapers  to  access  hospital  services  and  medicines,  and  providing  legal  aid  services  through \ndrop-in centers.  \n \n186.  The  development  of  street  work  is  unevenly  distributed  across  the  region.  While \ncommon in some countries, it does not exist in the PRC and has only recently started in other \nparts of East and Central Asia. For example, street educators have been employed recently in \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n45\n\nMongolia with the aim of drawing street children into services provided by day centers or drop-in \ncenters (West and Tungalag 2002).  \n \n187.  Two  particularly  important  aspects  of  work  on  the  street  include  HIV/AIDS  awareness \nand  the  provision  of  \u201clife  skills,\u201d  and/or  harm  reduction  training  around  the  use  of drugs and \nother substances as well as sex and reproductive health. Useful strategies have included peer \neducation, whereby a group of children are trained to be able to pass on accurate information to \nothers.  There  are  a  number  of  issues  in  the  provision  of  accurate  material  and  sustaining \nprojects  (West  2002).  Peer  counselling  among  abused  and  exploited  childrent  has  also  been \nfound  to  be  useful  in  the  Philippines  in  community-based  programs  (CRB  2003).  Another \nimportant  area  is  vulnerability  of  street  children  in  relation  to  the  law,  and  particularly  their \nrelationship  with  police.  A  number  of  (non-street  children)  projects  have  been  established  to \nlook at juvenile justice system issues. Services are needed for children in conflict with the law \nincluding access to advice and representation, in addition to advocacy on such related issues as \nthe treatment of children in detention. Some projects and localities have established telephone \nhelp lines and emergency lines for children and especially street children (see Box VII.3). \n \nG. \n\nCenters and Shelters \n\n188.  Drop-in  centers  and  shelters  are  common  means  of  maintaining  contact  with  children \nand  providing  a  range  of  services,  from  healthcare  and  advice  to  education  and  vocational \ntraining. While drop-in centers are the key component of work for some projects and provide a \nvisible  face  to  donors  and  point  of  engagement  with  street  children  (e.g.,  see  Box  VII.7),  for \nothers, such centers are viewed merely as an extension of street work, i.e., conducting informal \neducation  sessions,  peer  information,  etc.,  in  a  building  rather  than  on  the  street,  perhaps  for \nreasons of safety.  \n \nH. \n\nMoving On \n\n189.  There  are  several  components  to  providing  support  to  children  moving  from  the  street. \nThe provision of accommodation and/or places of refuge is widespread, although quality varies \nand  there  often  is  an  absence  of  standards.  While  child  protection  remains  an  important \nelement, not all projects place priority on this or have the capacity for protection mechanisms, \nbeing run on a low-cost basis. Police checks on the identity of personnel working with children, \nfor any record of abusing children, have become common in the west, and mandatory in many \ncountries. But these require circumstances of governance; systems of child protection including \narrest, trial, and record; and levels of technology not always available. Continuous observation \nand awareness is necessary.  \n \n190.  Although  projects  directed  to  the  development  and  improvement  of  foster  care  and \nresidential care have been undertaken in many countries, projects for street children more often \nfocus on temporary accommodation (shelters) and education/training. The two are linked in that \na project will attempt to provide or find vocational training (or education) for children who live in \nproject-based shelters.  \n \n \n\n\f 46\n\n \n\n \n\nBox VII.7: Mith Samlanh (Friends), Phnom Penh, Cambodia \n\nIt is estimated that as many as 20,000 children live and work on the streets of Phnom Penh. They \nare  on  the  streets  because  their  families  cannot  support them. Some of them have been orphaned by the \nwar  or  their  parents  have  been  maimed  by  land  mines  left  by  the  war.  Formed  in  1997,  Mith  Samlanh,  \nCambodia\u2019s leading street children program, reaches an average of 1,500 children daily. The organization\u2019s \ntarget group is homeless and vulnerable street children and adolescents, including their families, who are at \nhigh  risk  of  exploitation  and  physical  and  emotional  abuse  through  commercial  sex  and  violence  in  the \nstreets.  \n \nThe objective of  Mith  Samlanh is  to  provide  care  for  the  health  and  well  being  of  street  children \nwhile  working  for  their  reintegration  into  Cambodian  society.  The  organization  addresses  this  objective \nthrough vocational training and employment, education and reintegration into the public school system, and \nlinking  children  back  to  their  families  and  to  their  own  culture.  Mith  Samlanh\u2019s activities for street children \ninclude  12  interlinked  programs:  outreach,  transitional  home,  boarding  house,  training,  education,  family \nreintegration,  youth  reproductive  health,  HIV/AIDS  awareness,  substance  abuse  prevention  and  harm \nreduction,  incarcerated  children,  child  rights,  and  staff  development.  Mith  Samlanh  also  operates  a \nrestaurant  that  provides  apprenticeship,  training,  and  employment  for  street  children.  Although  Mith \nSamlanh mainly serves the street children of Phnom Penh, it also operates smaller programs in the cities of \nKampong  Cham  and  Kampong  Speu.  Mith Samlanh  staff travel extensively in all Cambodian provinces to \nlocate children\u2019s families and to assist in their return home, where this is feasible and in the best interests of \nthe child. \n \n \n Mith Samlanh has a staff of 120, supervised by a board of directors. It is supported by grants from \nAusAID,  UNICEF,  UNAIDS,  UNFPA/EC,  World  Food  Program,  FHI-Impact,  DOH-International,  CCFD, \nSave the Children, Australia, private donors, and the Australian and British Embassies in Cambodia.  \n \n \n\n191.  Less importance seems to have been placed on resettlement and reintegration work for \nstreet children, i.e., returning children home and ensuring their protection and reintegration, or \nprovision of longer-term alternative care. Part of the problem is the level of resources required \nnot only to prepare and transport children, but also to undertake necessary follow-up, including \ncounseling  for  both  returning  children  and  their  families.  Where  large  distances  are  involved, \nthis  becomes  especially  difficult  for  smaller  NGOs,  particularly  in  the  absence  of  national  or \ninternational networks.  \n \nI. \n\nLaw and Governance \n\n192.  Any overview of practice for street children must be linked to related sectors. The issues \nof coordination and cooperation have been noted above including the importance of partnership \nbetween projects. The role of state parties (to the CRC)  also is necessarily linked including the \nestablishment and minimum implementation of appropriate legislation. There are also the roles \nof duty bearers in relation to children\u2019s rights.  \n \n193.  The question of finance is always raised in relation to project work and practice, both by \nNGOs and government. One means of looking further at this issue has been the development of \nchildren\u2019s  budgets,  specifically  detailing  how  much  of  national  budgets  are  spent  on  children \nand in which areas. Children\u2019s budgets help to link the role of the State with children\u2019s rights, at \nleast  in  terms  of  spending.  Analysis  of  overall  resources  allocations  (including  nonfinancial \nresources)  provides  a  starting  point  in  examining  how  gaps  in  children\u2019s  rights  might  be  filled \n(Box VII.8).  \n \n\n\f   \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBox VII.8: Children\u2019s Budgets \n\nThe idea of \u201cchildren\u2019s budgets\u201d or a \u201cchild-focused budget\u201d has emerged as researchers and \npolicymakers  have  paid  more  attention  to  the  links  between  macroeconomic  development  and \nchildren\u2019s  rights.  The  \u201cmain  research  issues  of  studies  on  this  theme  [are]  to  clarify  resources, \nespecially  financial  resources  from  governments,  which  have  been  spent  (directly  or  indirectly)  on \nchildren,  and  to  analyze  [the]  possibility  to  improve  efficiency  of  this  spending\u2026.Such  child-centered \nbudget  studies  are  clearly  problem-oriented,  as  they  can  be  a  basis  for  suggestion  and  advocacy  for \nchildren\u2019s rights, especially in countries which have ratified the international Convention on the Rights \nof the Child\u201d (Nguyen Thi Van Anh et al. 2000, Viet Nam study, p. 8).  \n \n\nChild-focused  budgets  are  an  aspect  of  the  general  framework  of  budget  setting  and \nparticularly  the  transparency  of  the  link  between  policy  commitments  and  outcomes  that  are,  partially \nat least, expressed in financial commitments and expenditure. Problems associated with transparency \ninclude  lack  of  knowledge  and  information,  but  also  issues  such  as  pressures  to  ensure  policy \ncommitments  and  legal  obligations  are  followed  up.  This  is  especially  true  in  the  case  of  children\u2019s \nissues  \u201csince  children  have  no  political  voice  and  are  subject  to  many  other  disadvantages\u201d  (Nguyen \nThi Van Anh et al. 2000, Viet Nam study, p. 8).  \n \n\nMuch  initial  work  in  this  area  was  conducted  in  Africa,  for  example,  in  South  Africa  (see \nRobinson  and  Biersteker  1997;  and  www.idasact.org.za/bis/),  Ghana,  and  elsewhere.  There  is  also \ninterest  in  Asia,  particularly  in  Viet  Nam  (for  example  Nguyen  Thi  Van  Anh  et  al.  2000,  on  education \nand disabilities; and Crumpton and Giap 2002, on basic education). \n \n\nOne  study  in  Viet  Nam  aimed  to  make  children,  especially  children  with  disabilities,  more \nvisible  in  policy  and  decision-making  processes.  The  study  focused  on  the  budget  for  primary \neducation  at  the  district  level  to  identify  and  clarify  the  link  between  budget  and  policies  related  to \nchildren\u2019s  right  to  education.  The  study  determined  that  existing  school  budgets  were  inadequate  to \nprovide  for  children  with  disabilities  or  other  special  circumstances  (see  Nguyen  Thi  Van  Anh  et  al. \n2000, Viet Nam study).  \n \n\nA  2002  study  in  Viet  Nam  (Crumpton  and  Giap  2002)  similarly  identified  that  \u201cthe  consistent \nfeature  of  the  budget  allocation  process  is  that  salary  costs  take  precedence  over  other  budget  items \nand  represent  the  lion\u2019s  share  of  the  recurrent  (and  overall)  education budget. This translates into an \nacute  shortage  of  state  expenditure  on  basic  learning  materials,  facilities  and  maintenance  at  the \nschool  level,  negatively  affecting  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  as  well  as  investment  in  the \nsector.\u201d The study pointed out that this shortage means that \u201cparental and community contributions are \nincreasingly  important  to  address  high  funding  gaps  at  the  school  level  and  ensure  a  minimum \nstandard  of  education.\u201d  This  \u201creliance  on  parental  contributions  to  provide  a  minimal  level  of \nservice\u2026.[adds]  to  the  financial  and  learning  disadvantage  of  poor  families,  thus  contributing  to  the \ncycle of poverty.\u201d  \n \nAlthough  these  examples  are  drawn  from  children\u2019s  budgets  in  education,  such  budgeting \n \nreview  also  can  be  linked  to  street  children  issues,  where  poverty  prevents  children  from  attending \nschool and, thus, at risk of moving to the streets.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 48\n\nVIII.  GOVERNMENTS AND NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS \n\n194. \nIn  western  countries  where  welfare  services  have  been  \u201cprivatized,\u201d service provision \noften is contracted to nonprofit NGOs (which may supplement the monies provided by the State \nwith  their  own  contributions  raised  as  charity).  Where  for-profit  concerns  have  taken  over,  for \nexample,  residential  care  for  older  people,  there  have  been  debates  about  standards  and  the \nquality of care provided to those who have no funds of their own. Private care for street children \nremains  limited,  although  some  adults  engaged  in  the  informal  economy  supply  basic \naccommodation  and  food  for  street  children  in  return  for  part  or  all  of  the  income  they  earn \nthrough begging and other street activities. At issue is the degree of coercion and exploitation \ninvolved (which might also exist in family settings where children are sent off to work).  \n \n195.  Another link with private or for-profit concerns is where profits are partly used to pay for \nthe  operation  of  provision  for  street  children;  this  seems  more  often  to  be  for  orphans  and \nchildren  abandoned  when  young.  There  have  been  problems  with  some  of  this  \u201cprivate\u201d \nprovision, which has in reality been established in order for adult(s) to gain profit (e.g., through \nforeign adoption) or for sexual access to children (this may also happen in other sectors, such \nas  the  creation  of  NGOs  for  similar  purposes).  This  is  one  area  where  regulation,  standards, \nand monitoring and evaluation by an outside body with some degree of power are essential, and \nan  area  that  requires  action  by  governments  in  the  development  of  appropriate  legislation  as \nwell as realistic enforcement mechanisms. \n \n196.  The majority of provision for street children is organized through NGOs. A main issue in \nthe  response  to  street  children  and  providing  the  context  for  their  lives,  is  the  relationship \nbetween NGOs and government  organizations, and their respective responsibilities. In several \nparts  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  the  provision  of  welfare  services  was,  until  the  late  1980s  or \nearly 1990s, the responsibility of the State through work units or other mechanisms. The shift to \nmarket economies has brought new social problems that existing mechanisms of provision are \nunable to address. Funding and the development of new, replacement provision generally has \nproven  difficult  and  also  often  requires  new  laws  and  new  types  of  services and professions, \nsuch as social work. The introduction of such changes in the region was hampered by the Asian \neconomic  crisis.  The  development  of  NGOs\u2014often  tentative  at  first,  because  NGOs  are  new \nlittle-understood  forms  of  social  organization  in  many  countries\u2014and  the  expansion  of \ninternational  NGO-supported  activities  represent  responses  to  these  new  social  problems.  In \nsome countries the development of NGOs is seen as an important indication of the development \nof \u201ccivil society\u201d and new forms of governance. \n \n197.  Elsewhere, NGOs have long been in existence, and are a main provider of welfare and \nother services, especially for the poor. NGOs have been at the forefront of street children work \nin several countries in the region for some time.  It is noted, however, that relatively few NGOs \nhave a particular focus on children, and especially a focus on children\u2019s rights and associated \napproaches  to  work.  Despite  nearly  universal  ratification  of  the  CRC,  a  key  problem  remains \nlack of overall vision as well as real government commitment or involvement in such work.  \n \n198.  A problem common to all the countries is the need for at least minimal coordination and \nregulations or standards for provision. There is much competition for profile and status, as well \nas  for  scarce  donor  funding.  The  problem  of  raising  funds  is  linked  not  only  to  issues  of \nsustainability,  but  also  to  public  perceptions  of  street  children  problems  and  issues.  Funding \nthrough  international  NGOs  is  dependent  on  work  in  their  home  countries,  or  skills  in  raising \nmoney from other donors, such as western governments. In the region, there are a number of \n\u201cbilateral NGOs,\u201d such as trusts or other organizations working in just one country (for example \n\n\f \n\n   \n\n49\n\nin Afghanistan, Nepal, or Sri Lanka) and dependent on funds raised, for example, in the United \nKingdom in a competitive \u201ccharity market.\u201d Other organizations may limit their work to a small \nnumber  of  countries.  The  easiest  way  for  such  organizations  to  raise  funds  is  to  simplify  the \nissue  and  present  graphic  images  of  street  children,  even  if  these  conform  to  stereotypes  of \npublic expectations.  \n \n199. \nIn  addition  to  coordination,  a  set  of  minimum  standards  is  required  for  provision  of \naccommodation  and  other  services,  so  as  to  ensure child protection. These coordination and \nstandard-setting  mechanisms  normally  are  encoded  in  legislation  and,  thus,  generally  need  to \nbe  supervised  by  government.  In  places  where  government  is  the  main  provider  of  services, \nstandards  may  consist  of  regulations  rather  than  law.  Because  child  rights  address  all  of  a \nchild\u2019s  needs  and  rights,  children\u2019s  legislation  must  address  issues  such  as  labor  regulation, \nworking hours, pay, conditions and age, etc., as well as regulation of sex work, police behavior, \nchildren and young people in conflict with law, juvenile justice systems, and so on.  \n \n200.  The mechanisms for implementation of legislation also are crucial and may bring NGOs \nand government organizations into conflict. For example, the protection  of children from sexual \nand  physical  abuse  may  require  some  agency  to  take  the  lead  and  have  formal  investigative \nauthority.  \n \n201.  Analysis  of  who  should  be  the  duty  bearers  with  responsibility  for  children\u2019s  rights  is  a \nuseful  approach  in  determining  the  roles  of  government  and  nongovernment  agencies  and \nindividuals. For example, responsibility to ensure that children are not abused in shelters might \nfall  to  individuals  employed  at  the  shelter,  managers,  or  a  board  of  directors  or  trustees.  The \nanalysis  would  point  to  those  responsible  for  monitoring  such  organizations,  or  for  enforcing \nlegislation meant to protect children including bringing perpetrators to justice. In many countries, \nhowever,  there  is  an  absence  of  effective  supervision  and  delineation  of  roles  and \nresponsibilities.  \n\n\f 50\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nThis  list  largely  comprises  references  to  the  text,  with  some  other  works  consulted  or \nfound during the preparation of the report.
