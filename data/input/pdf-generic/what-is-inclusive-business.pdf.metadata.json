Many countries in the region \nhave also broadened their approach toward economic development and moved from poverty \nreduction to promoting inclusive growth strategies that can sustainably benefit the poor and \nvulnerable. While the private sector has been a key contributor to the economic boom in \nAsia, it has yet to fully realize its potential in creating shared value, which is to promote \nbusiness models that integrate the low-income segment in unique and innovative ways that \ngenerate company growth while creating value for the low-income segment and directly \ncontributing to poverty reduction. As such, there is an increasing agreement that the private \nsector growth can be a powerful tool in the global fight against poverty, if its business is \nmore specifically targeted towards creating impact at the lower income groups.  \nBeyond BoP: Asia's \nThe Base of the Pyramid in Asia\nprivate  sector  is \nEast and  South Asia increasingly realizing \nSoutheast \nAsia that the base of the \n% of population below the  income  pyramid \nthe rich\nrespective poverty lines \n(BoP),  i.e.  those \n(2009)\nthe lower and upper  living  below  the  $3-\nmiddle class\n$4  poverty  line, \nrepresents  an \n65.9% 94.1% low income ($4) interesting  business \nopportunity  as  a \n53.0% 88.4% vulnerable ($3) substantial  new \nmarket for goods and \n33.2% 70.9% poor ($2) inclusive business\nservices  that  can \n14.3% 36.0% very poor ($1.25) improve  the \nlivelihoods  of  the \n1,983.1 1,586.7 Total population (million people)\npoor and vulnerable, \nSources: World Bank PovCalNet (24 Aug 2012 update), ADB Key Indicators 2012 and  as  a  significant \npool of entrepreneurship, assets, talent and productivity that can be leveraged for the supply \nof critical inputs, innovative distribution systems, and skilled labor.  \nSystemic approach to build income and provide relevant goods and services for the \npoor: Inclusive businesses are private sector investments specifically targeting this low \nincome market with the double purpose of making reasonable profit (i.e. an internal rate of \nreturn  of  8-20%)  and  creating  tangible  development  impact  through  the  provision  of \nsustainable decent jobs and better income opportunities, as well as services that matter for \nthe poor's life. For ADB, inclusive business are companies with reasonable financial rate of \nreturns (10%-20%) and large and systemic impact on poverty reduction and living quality \nthat found private sector solutions to core poverty problems by including the poor and low \nincome groups (up to $3) as suppliers of goods and services, distributors,. Employees, and \nas consumers of social goods.1   \nBalancing financial return and social impact in scale: Inclusive business differs from \nsocial enterprises and corporate social responsibility activities in its realized profit making \nmotive, as well as its social impact in scale and systemic contribution to poverty reduction, \nand consequently also the larger size of investment needs. It also differs from the original \nbase of the pyramid approach that sees the poor mainly as market for private ventures and \nassumes automatic benefit for the poor through the provision of any consumption good. \n                                                 \n1  ADB\u2019s IB initiative does not target companies that include the poor as mere consumer of private goods that do \nnot have much social value.  ", "2 \nExpanding private sector growth through inclusive business ventures on the other side would \nprovide the poor with new jobs and access to quality and affordable goods and services, \nhelping them improve their lives and reducing poverty. However, the private sector has \nbarely explored its potential at the BoP.  \nInclusive Business: Balancing Social and Financial Returns Supporting inclusive \nBusiness:  Inclusive \nBusiness  are \nn\nur commercially  viable \net\nof r firms that either wish \ne  20%\nat to  grow  from  social \ncial r commercial companies Enterprise status into \nn\na\nFin 15% debt investments (equity, guarantees) inclusive  serving  broader \nbusiness markets  and \nachieving  higher \n10% Technical Asssitance returns,  or  highly \nprofitable  companies \nthat  want  to  deepen \n6% equity, patient capital, guarantees\ntheir  reach  towards \nmore  valuable  social \n3%\nsocial enterprises contributions.
