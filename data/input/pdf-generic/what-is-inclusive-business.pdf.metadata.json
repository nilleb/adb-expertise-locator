Many  countries  in  the  region \nhave also broadened their approach toward economic development and moved from poverty \nreduction to promoting inclusive growth strategies that can sustainably benefit the poor and \nvulnerable.  While  the  private  sector  has  been  a  key  contributor  to  the  economic  boom  in \nAsia,  it  has  yet  to  fully  realize  its  potential  in  creating  shared  value,  which  is  to  promote \nbusiness models that integrate the low-income segment in unique and innovative ways that \ngenerate  company  growth  while  creating  value  for  the  low-income  segment  and  directly \ncontributing to poverty reduction. As such, there is an increasing agreement that the private \nsector  growth  can  be  a  powerful  tool  in  the  global  fight  against  poverty,  if  its  business  is \nmore specifically targeted towards creating impact at the lower income groups.  \n\n65.9%\n\nthe rich\n\nSouth Asia\n\nsector \n\nThe Base of the Pyramid in Asia\n\nEast and \nSoutheast \nAsia\n\nthe lower and upper \nmiddle class\n\n% of population below the \nrespective poverty lines \n(2009)\n\nBeyond  BoP:  Asia's \nprivate \nis \nincreasingly  realizing \nthat  the  base  of  the \npyramid \nincome \n(BoP), \nthose \ni.e. \nliving  below  the  $3-\n$4 \nline, \npoverty \nan \nrepresents \ninteresting  business \na \nopportunity \nsubstantial \nnew \nmarket for goods and \nthat  can \nservices \nthe \nimprove \nthe \nlivelihoods  of \npoor  and  vulnerable, \nand  as  a  significant \npool of entrepreneurship, assets, talent and productivity that can be leveraged for the supply \nof critical inputs, innovative distribution systems, and skilled labor.  \n\nSources: World Bank PovCalNet (24 Aug 2012 update), ADB Key Indicators 2012\n\nTotal population (million people)\n\ninclusive business\n\nvery poor ($1.25)\n\nlow income ($4)\n\nvulnerable ($3)\n\npoor ($2)\n\nas \n\n1,983.1\n\n1,586.7\n\n53.0%\n\n14.3%\n\n33.2%\n\n36.0%\n\n70.9%\n\n88.4%\n\n94.1%\n\nSystemic approach to build income and provide relevant goods and services for the \npoor:  Inclusive  businesses  are  private  sector  investments  specifically  targeting  this  low \nincome market with the double purpose of making reasonable profit (i.e. an internal rate of \nreturn  of  8-20%)  and  creating  tangible  development  impact  through  the  provision  of \nsustainable decent jobs and better income opportunities, as well as services that matter for \nthe poor's life. For ADB, inclusive business are companies with reasonable financial rate of \nreturns  (10%-20%)  and  large  and  systemic  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and  living  quality \nthat  found  private  sector  solutions  to  core  poverty  problems  by  including  the  poor  and  low \nincome groups (up to $3) as suppliers of goods and services, distributors,. Employees, and \nas consumers of social goods.1   \n\nBalancing  financial  return  and  social  impact  in  scale:  Inclusive  business  differs  from \nsocial  enterprises  and  corporate  social  responsibility  activities  in  its  realized  profit  making \nmotive, as well as its social impact in scale and systemic contribution to poverty reduction, \nand  consequently  also  the  larger  size  of  investment  needs.  It  also  differs  from  the  original \nbase of the pyramid approach that sees the poor mainly as market for private ventures and \nassumes  automatic  benefit  for  the  poor  through  the  provision  of  any  consumption  good. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB\u2019s IB initiative does not target companies that include the poor as mere consumer of private goods that do \n\nnot have much social value.  \n\n\f2 \n\nExpanding private sector growth through inclusive business ventures on the other side would \nprovide  the  poor  with  new  jobs  and  access  to  quality  and  affordable  goods  and  services, \nhelping  them  improve  their  lives  and  reducing  poverty.
