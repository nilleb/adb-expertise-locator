The people of Metro Manila are\nfacing much more lethal, much more immedi-\nate threats to their health and well-being.\nThese threats come from the mountains of\ngarbage that dot almost every other block of\nthe metropolis.\n\nMetro Manila\u2019s dump sites are\ndangerous, exposed, and generate po-\ntentially toxic liquids called \u201cleachate.\u201d\nAs these toxins flow along the surface\nand seep into the earth, they risk poi-\nsoning the surface and groundwater\nthat are used for drinking, aquatic life,\nand the environment. Waste fires at\nthese sites are common, which send\nplumes of toxic emissions into the air.\nOther sites are critically unstable, pre-\nsenting the possibility of another\ndeadly garbage slide.\n\nThe majority of Metro Manila\u2019s\ndump sites will reach capacity during\n2004. The likely result may be another\nvisible crisis in collection and the hur-\nried expansion of remaining sites. In\nthis haste, longer-term, more sustain-\nable solutions may be ignored.\n\nDespite the promotion of waste\n\nsegregation and collection at source,\nadoption has been at a very slow pace.\nEfforts must be dramatically scaled up\nto have any effect on the unceasing\nwave of garbage generated by Metro\nManila.\n\nThe not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY)\n\nphenomenon is hard at work in Metro\nManila. Despite numerous efforts, no\ncommunity has been willing to take\nMetro Manila\u2019s garbage. A survey\nfound that while 67% of residents be-\nlieved that Metro Manila has a serious\ngarbage problem, 73% did not want to\nsee a sanitary landfill in their commu-\nnity. Notably, 78% of surveyed house-\n\nMetro Manila\u2019s dump sites\nare dangerous, exposed, and\ngenerate potentially toxic\nliquids called \u2018leachate\u2019.\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\n19\n\n\fThe Surat, India\nExperience\n\nIn September 1994, nearly 30 years after\nthe last urban outbreak in India, plague\nstruck Surat, a city in western India. This\nserved as a chilling reminder of how rapid\nurbanization and deterioration of the urban\nenvironment can bring people into contact\nwith forgotten diseases. Pneumonic plague,\na highly contagious form of the disease, kills\n100% of its victims if left untreated. Crowd-\ning and poor sanitation provide ideal condi-\ntions for its spread. Because it is so\ncontagious, the outbreak caused extreme\npanic locally and internationally, with one\nquarter of the populace fleeing the city.\nFortunately, the outbreak was diagnosed\nquickly, widespread treatment began, and\nthe death rate dropped dramatically.\n\ny an Epidemic?\ny an Epidemic?\nWhWhWhWhWhy an Epidemic?\ny an Epidemic?\ny an Epidemic?\nEvidence points to the squalid conditions in\nmuch of Surat and the occurrence of two\nnatural disasters, an earthquake and heavy\nflooding, which brought plague-infected\nrats into contact with the human population.\nSurat\u2019s sanitation problems then helped the\nrat population grow dramatically. A city of\n2.2 million, Surat generates close to 1,250\ntons of garbage each day, 250 tons of which\nremain uncollected. To make matters worse,\nmonsoon floodwaters inundated the city,\nparticularly low-lying slum areas.\n\noll and Damage\noll and Damage\nDeath T\nDeath T\noll and Damage\nDeath Toll and Damage\noll and Damage\nDeath T\nDeath T\no the Indian  Economyyyyy\no the Indian  Econom\no the Indian  Econom\nttttto the Indian  Econom\no the Indian  Econom\nIn relative terms, the death toll of 56 per-\nsons was minor. By any other name, the\nplague probably would not have caused the\nkind of panic that it did. In financial terms,\nhowever, the plague\u2019s toll was much greater,\ncosting the Indian economy in excess of\n$600 million. More than 45,000 people\ncanceled their travel plans to India, and the\ncountry\u2019s hotel occupancy rate dipped to\n20% from 60%. Many countries stopped air\nand water traffic to India, while exports\nsuffered a $420 million loss.\n\nWorld Resources Institute, World Resources\n1996-97\n\na\nr\ne\nr\nb\na\nC\nm\na\nR\n\n \n\n20\n\nholds had no idea where their collected\ngarbage was taken for final disposal.\nMedical waste management pre-\n\nsents another challenge. Nearly 3,700\nhealth care facilities in Metro Manila gen-\nerate an estimated 47 tons of medical\nwaste per day, with 56% of this waste, or\n26 tons, considered potentially infec-\ntious. A significant proportion of this dan-\ngerous waste finds its way into the mu-\nnicipal waste stream, and is handled by\npeople who are poorly equipped and\ntrained, exposing them to infections and\nother health hazards.\n\nThe problem of medical waste dis-\nposal is further exacerbated by the man-\ndated closure of medical waste incinera-\ntors in hospitals in Metro Manila, as re-\nquired by the Clean Air Act. No alterna-\ntive is in place.\n\nAgainst this grim context, a major\naccomplishment has been the passage\nof Republic Act 9003\u2014the Ecological\nSolid Waste Management Act of 2000.\nWhile a good beginning, much work\nremains to be done. Despite the sim-\nplicity of its prescription\u2014reduce, re-\nuse, and recycle at the local level\u2014the\nlaw awaits serious implementation.\n\nRA 9003 is an enlightened piece of\n\nlegislation, yet few local governments are\nfamiliar with it. The timetable is behind\nschedule, source reduction and segrega-\ntion efforts at the local level are sporadic\nand uneven, and there is little active\npublic participation, understanding, or\ninterest. Significantly, the required Solid\nWaste Management Fund has not been\nset aside as mandated by law, limiting\nthe level of investment.\n\n\fWe owe it to the\nnext generation\nto resolve this\ncrisis now.\n\nThe garbage business is lucrative.\nOver P3.54 billion is spent annually on\nwaste collection and disposal. Yet de-\nspite the amount of money in the sys-\ntem, it does not function in a safe,\nsustainable way.\n\nThe garbage crisis is real, serious,\nand poses even grave threats to public\nhealth if not resolved. The root causes\nof the problems are not technical or\nfinancial, but rather relate to gover-\nnance and political will.\n\nWe owe it to the next generation to\n\nresolve this crisis now.\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\n21\n\n\fHistory of the\nWaste Disposal\nCrisis\n\nThe Rise (Early 1991\u2013Mid-1992): Early 1991 marked an important\ntransition in Metro Manila waste disposal. Prior to this, the metropolis\noperated numerous dump sites, including the internationally infamous\nSmokey Mountain dump site in the City of Manila. In 1991, and as a\nresult of mounting public pressure to improve waste disposal and close\nSmokey Mountain, the World Bank-financed 73-hectare (ha) regional\nsanitary landfill facility opened in San Mateo, Rizal. This was followed in\n1992 with the opening of the 65-ha Carmona regional sanitary landfill\nin Cavite, which coincided with the closure of Smokey Mountain. Both\nfacilities were designed and constructed to international standards and\nrepresented a major accomplishment for the Government. Several large\ndump sites also operated during the early 1990s, including the Payatas\nand Catmon dump sites.\n\na\nr\ne\nr\nb\na\nC\nm\na\nR\n\n \n\nThe Decline (Mid-1992\u2013Late\n1997): Over time, operations at San\nMateo and Carmona progressively im-\npacted local communities. Design,\nconstruction, and operation standards\ndeclined with each operational phase,\nraising concerns about environmental\nrisks. Hundreds of trucks thundered\nthrough communities nightly, strewing\ngarbage in their wake. The presence of\njunk shops, waste pickers, and informal\nshanties brought social impacts. Public\nopposition mounted.\n\nDisposal operations continued at\nthe ever-growing Payatas and Catmon\ndump sites, as well as at the Do\u00f1a\nPetra dump site in Marikina, and the\nC4 dump site in Navotas.

This\nplaced increasing pressure on San\nMateo and major dump sites to accom-\nmodate the additional waste. The im-\npending crisis led to the opening of the\nLingunan dump site in Valenzuela, and\nthe stockpiling of waste at Pier 18 in\nManila. During 1998, waste disposal\noptions were further limited by the pas-\nsage of the Clean Air Act, which effec-\ntively stalled plans to build incinerators.\nTwo major donor-funded studies\nwere also completed during this period,\none of which evaluated toxic and haz-\nardous waste, and another that devel-\noped a metro-wide master plan for\nsolid waste. The recommendations of\nthese studies were not implemented,\neven though one warned of an impend-\ning disposal crisis.\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\nThe Crisis (Late 1999\u2013Early 2001):\nThe waste disposal crisis was a sudden\nphenomenon, marked by the forced\nsuspension of operations of the San\nMateo sanitary landfill in late 1999 due\nto immense public opposition. Within\nweeks, it brought about a near-cata-\nstrophic collapse of the municipal\nwaste system and severe public health\nrisks. Metro Manila was out of options\nfor disposal, and waste went largely\nuncollected. Dumping at the existing\nsites was accelerated, and small-scale,\nprivate dump sites were developed.\nAs the Government searched for\nimmediate relief, private sector initia-\ntives were hastily conceived. These in-\ncluded plans to barge waste to Bataan\nto the northwest and Semirara Island\nto the south. Both plans met fierce\npublic opposition, and following the\nissuance of legal restraining orders,\nwere curtailed. The Government also\nsponsored a procurement process to\nselect a private sector consortium to\ndevelop an integrated waste manage-\nment system, including a disposal facil-\nity in Rizal. This also encountered pub-\nlic opposition and a legal restraining\norder, and the plan remains stalled to\nthis day.\n\nUncontrolled dumping at the\n\nPayatas dump site led to a catastrophic\nwaste mass failure at the site in July\n2000. The tragedy signified the scale\nof the crisis.\n\nSubsequently, Payatas was tempo-\nrarily closed, only to reopen later. Other\nsmaller dump sites struggled to cope\nwith the increased waste stream.\nWaste from the City of Manila contin-\nued to pile up at Pier 18.\n\n25\n\n\fSince 2001, additional controlled dump\nsites have been developed in\nan attempt to mitigate the crisis.\n\nThe Aftermath (Early 2001\u2013\nPresent): Since 2001, additional\ncontrolled dump sites have been\ndeveloped in an attempt to\nmitigate the crisis. These include\nthe Rodriguez disposal facility in\nMontalban and the Tanza facility in\nNavotas. RA 9003 was also enacted\nduring this time.\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nA widely held perception is\nthat the crisis has subsided, and that\nlonger-term waste disposal issues have\nbeen solved. This, unfortunately, is far\nfrom reality.\n\nMetro Manila has less than 2 years\n\ndisposal capacity, assuming optimistic\nestimates. The potential for another\nwaste disposal crisis is high unless\nimmediate action is taken.\n\nWithout doubt, current waste\n\ndisposal practices pose significant pub-\nlic health, environmental, and\nsocial risks.

The city collects solid wastes from households, mar-\nkets, and commercial establishments, with two trucks traveling\nin tandem collecting biodegradable or nonbiodegradable\nwastes. The nonbiodegradable fraction is taken to the recycling\nstation for sorting, where workers extract materials utilizing a\nmechanized conveyor system. Recyclable materials are then\nplaced in large bins for temporary storage before being trans-\nferred to downstream private recyclers for eventual further pro-\ncessing and reuse. The biodegradable fraction is taken to the\ndisposal site where it is spread, compacted, and covered with\nsoil. The barangays are not allowed to collect recyclable materi-\nals, except for tree cuttings and garden and yard wastes.

The high levels\nof fecal coliform confirms\nthe presence of a large\namount of human waste in\nthe dump sites and sur-\nrounding areas, which is\npresumably generated by\nhouseholds that lack alter-\nnatives to sanitation.\nIn the samples tested,\nfecal coliform values were\nfound to be an average of\n7 million, with a high of\n30 million, indicating signifi-\ncant contamination.

Despite this high level\nof spending, the system requires significant im-\nprovement. Sound financial management is key to\nefficient and sustainable operations.\n\nLocal governments are mandated by the\nLocal Government Code to collect fees for ser-\nvices. One of these is the collection of waste\nmanagement fees from business establishments,\nwhere the charges are incorporated in the annual\napplication for a business permit. Although local\ngovernments are allowed to adjust fees\nevery 5 years, most have not.\n\nRates remain unrealistically low. For example,\na typical fast food restaurant in one city pays only\nP17 per day for waste disposal, far below the\nactual cost.\n\nCollection of waste management fees at the\n\nhousehold level is being implemented only in a\nhandful of wealthier barangays, but overall the\nwillingness of households to pay is limited.\n\nIn 2001, Metro Manila\u2019s local government\n\nexpenses for solid waste management varied\nsignificantly, from about 5% to an astonishing\n24% of their total expenditures, with an average\nof approximately 13%.

With the passage of\nRA 9003, increased recycling is taking\nplace, with an ambitious target of 25%\nwaste reduction over a 5-year period.\nCivic-minded professionals, with a\nstrong sense of environmental conserva-\ntion, started the zero-waste recycling\nmovement in the Philippines in the\n1970s. Their dedication to promoting a\nclean and better environment has in-\n\n79\n\n\fspired others to initiate the concept\nwith community-based solid waste\nmanagement programs in their\ncommunities.\n\nZero-waste recycling does not\nmean there is no waste to be collected\nor disposed of because everything will\nbe recycled. Rather, it is a holistic\napproach at handling solid waste\nmaterials where any waste materials\nthat are still useful are not allowed to\ngo to waste.\n\nCommunity-based initiatives involve\nwaste segregation at source, recycling,\nand composting. Programs have been\nattempted in many barangays through-\nout Metro Manila\u2014some have suc-\nceeded, others have failed for one\nreason or another. Leadership is the\nkey factor in successful programs. In\nmost cases, the initiative is led by the\nBarangay Captain or nongovernment\norganization aligned with the zero-\nwaste movement.\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\n80\n\nRecycling\n\nRecyclable materials include \u201cfactory-\nreturnable\u201d fractions such as paper,\nplastics, glass and metals, and also\ncertain biodegradable materials\nwhich are composted. They are\nprimarily recovered at source through\ncommunity-based and recycling organi-\nzations from households and other es-\ntablishments, by collection truck per-\nsonnel during transfer to the dump\nsites, and by informal waste pickers\nwho scour the waste piles and dump\nsites of Metro Manila.\n\nThe market demand for certain re-\n\ncyclable materials appears to be un-\nmatched by the limited available sup-\nply. One large paper company, for in-\nstance, is willing to buy all recyclable\npaper materials obtainable from Metro\nManila, but only 10% of its require-\nments can be supplied.\n\nMost eco-aides who collect recy-\nclable materials in Metro Manila are\npart of a network organized by the\nLinis-Ganda Foundation. The network\nincludes the Metro Manila Federation\nof Environmental Multi-Purpose Coop-\n\n\feratives; the federation\u2019s 17 individual\nmember multipurpose cooperatives\nrepresenting the 17 local governments\nof Metro Manila; 572 junk shops,\n2,500 junk shop workers, 1,200 eco-\naides; and 132 drivers.\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\n81\n\n\fl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\n82\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\n\fl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\nl\n\ns\ne\na\nS\n \nc\ni\nr\nE\n\nComposting\n\nOver 2,000 tons of biodegradable\nhousehold waste is estimated to be\ngenerated daily in Metro Manila. At a\nstandard conversion rate of 50% from\nraw material to compost, a potential\ndaily production of some 1,000 tons of\ncompost could be obtained. But the few\ncomposting facilities in Metro Manila, at\nfull capacity, can only process 10 tons\nof compost per day.\n\nAn assessment of implementing\nmetrowide composting in each barangay\nas mandated under RA 9003 suggests\nproblems with its viability. An annual\nrequired investment of P1.5 billion\nwould generate an estimated return of\nonly P750 million, or only half the\namount required to make the system\nfinancially viable.\n\nThe greater problem is the market-\n\ning of compost, since its enormous\npotential supply can hardly be matched\nby demand in Metro Manila or even that\nin nearby provinces. Quality of compost\nand adhering to standards are also\ncritical to keep shredded waste, and its\ncontaminants, from entering the food\nsupply chain.\n\n83\n\n\fMoving to Sanitary Landfills\n\nAn incremental three-step progression is the logical path to transform-\ning Metro Manila\u2019s dangerous open dump sites to more controlled,\nenvironmentally sound dump sites, followed by their phase out and\nclosure, and the establishment of properly engineered sanitary landfills.\n\nOpen Dump Sites\nDangerous, with high environmental, public health, and social risks.\n\nControlled Dump Sites\nShort-term measures in the absence of longer-term, environmentally\nsound approaches.\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\n84\n\nl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nMetro Manila\u2019s local government\nofficials visit the Waimanalo Sanitary\nLandfill in Honolulu, Hawaii, during\nthe Mayors\u2019 Asia-Pacific Environmental\nSummit, September 2003.\n\n\fl\nl\n\n \n\na\nf\nt\ns\ne\nW\nw\ne\nh\nt\nt\na\nM\n\nSanitary Landfills\nInevitably, a rational system of engineered sanitary landfills will need\nto be constructed. A metrowide system would likely include transfer\nstations to receive, disinfect, process, and compact residual wastes\ncollected in Metro Manila. The wastes would then be sent to one or\nmore regional sanitary landfills, where waste would be placed in sani-\ntary landfill cells equipped with engineered environmental protection\nsystems, including landfill lining systems, to act as a barrier between\nthe original ground and the waste.\n\nTypically, a sanitary landfill has leachate and landfill gas collec-\ntion and treatment systems, groundwater monitoring wells, and land-\nfill cover systems. Once full, a soundly managed sanitary landfill can\nbe closed and converted to other uses, such as a park, golf course,\nor other open space.\n\n85\n\n\fAction Plan\nfor Change\n\nSector Planning\n\nIssue\nPrior to RA 9003, there was little guid-\nance, regulation, or coordination of\nsolid waste management in Metro\nManila\n\nSolutions\nRA 9003 empowers local governments\nto take primary responsibility for, and\nenforcement of, their solid waste\nmanagement systems.

Given\nthe critical need to provide useful information and work to-\ngether to adopt lasting solutions, I am pleased to share with\nyou The Garbage Book: Solid Waste Management in Metro\nManila.\n\nThis publication is a synthesis of the findings and recom-\n\nmendations developed under an advisory technical assis-\ntance funded by the Asian Development Bank, the Metro\nManila Solid Waste Management Project, carried out in col-\nlaboration with the Department of Environment and Natural\nResources and the Department of Health. Undertaken from\n\nJuly 2002 to February 2004, the study provided support to\nthe National Solid Waste Management Commission and\nother agencies involved in solid waste management in Metro\nManila.

This esti-\nmate is based on the calculations noted in the\nparagraph below, findings of ADB TA 3848-PHI:\nMetro Manila Solid Waste Management\nProject, 2003, and by updating and refining\nthe 1999 JICA-funded Metro Manila\nMasterplan Study estimate that 27% of all\nMetro Manila\u2019s solid waste is illegally dumped.\n\nPage 14: Of the estimated 6,700 tons gen-\nerated per day, approximately 720 tons per\nday is recycled or composted. The bal-\nance\u2014some 6,000 tons daily\u2014is either\nhauled to dump sites, dumped illegally on\nprivate land, in rivers, creeks, Manila Bay,\nor openly burned, adding to the heavily\npolluted air shed. The daily population of\nMetro Manila (2003) is estimated to be ap-\nproximately 11,989,297, or rounded to ap-\nproximately 12 million. This is estimated by\nadding the official Philippine Government Na-\ntional Statistics Office medium assumption\nprojection for 2003 (10,899,361 population)\nto a Metro Manila Development Authority esti-\nmate of an additional 10% population increase\n(1,089,936) to account for the additional day-\ntime population within the metropolis. The\naverage per capita waste generation rate for\nMetro Manila (0.56 kg/person/day) is esti-\nmated from the results of the Metro Manila\nSolid Waste Managment Masterplan, funded by\nthe Japanese International Cooperation Agency\n(JICA), in 1999. The total solid waste genera-\ntion rate estimate is therefore calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated population\n(11,989,297) by the estimated average per\ncapita waste generation rate (0.56 kg/person/\nday), equating to approximately 6,700 tons.\nThe estimate of recycled and composted waste\nof 720 tons per day is based on: (i) information\nfrom the major Metro Manila recycling associa-\ntion (500 tons per day); (ii) an extrapolation\nthat other recyclers recycle an additional 200\ntons per day; and (iii) an extrapolation that\napproximately 20 tons daily of biodegradable\nwaste is composted.\n\n94\n\nPage 17: An estimated 150,000 residents\nof Metro Manila know the sight and smell\nof garbage as an integral part of their daily\nlives.

Currently, Metro Manila gener-\nates an estimated 6,700 tons per day of solid\nwaste (above). This equates to approximately\n\n2.4 million tons per year (6,700 tons per day\nmultiplied by 365 days), which equates to over\n70 million tons in 30 years (2.4 million tons\nper year multiplied by 30 years). This is signifi-\ncantly conservative, as it does not include\nwaste generation increases due to population\nand economic growth.\n\nPage 32-33: Collection of this waste will\nrequire\u2026\n\na \u2026a line of waste trucks going three\ntimes round the earth and over halfway to\nthe moon. On average, collection trucks are\nassumed to transport approximately\n3.25 tons of waste. In 30 years, the cumula-\ntive 70 million tons of waste generated will,\ntherefore, require 21.5 million truck trips\n(70 million tons divided by the average truck\ncarrying capacity of 3.25 tons). Assuming an\naverage length of a truck plus the gap to the\nnext truck of 15 meters, the 21.5 million\ntrucks would extend 322 million meters\n(21.5 million trucks multiplied by 15 meters\naverage length and gap), which equates to\n322,000 kilometers (km). The circumference\nof the earth is approximately 39,000 km,\ntherefore three times round the earth is\n117,000 km (the circumference of the earth,\n39,000 km, multiplied by 3). The distance to\nthe moon is approximately 384,000 km,\ntherefore half way to the moon is 192,000 km\n(the total distance of 384,000 km divided by\n2). The distance of three times round the earth\nand half way to the moon is, therefore,\n309,000 km (192,000 km plus 117,000 km).\n\nb. \u2026a cumulative waste truck travel dis-\ntance equal to a distance over 4,000\ntimes around the earth and to the sun.\nAssuming each of the 21.5 million truck trips\n(mentiond in a.) travels an average distance of\n15 km, then the cumulative waste truck travel\ndistance equates to 322 million km (21.5\nmillion truck trips multiplied by 15 km). Since\nthe circumference of the earth is 39,000 km\n(mentioned in a.), then 4,000 times round it\nequates to 156 million km (39,000 km multi-\nplied by 4,000). Since the distance to the sun\nis approximately 150 million km, then the cu-\nmulative distance of 4,000 times round the\nearth and to the sun equates to 306 million\nkm (156 million km plus 150 million km)\n\n\fc. \u2026at a cost of over P100 billion ($1.9\nbillion). This conservatively assumes the cur-\nrent annual expenditure on Metro Manila solid\nwaste management (P3.54 billion) multiplied\nby 30 years.\n\nPage 38-39: In the next 30 years, Metro\nManila will generate over 230 million cubic\nmeters of solid waste. This is calculated by\ndividing the estimated 70 million tons of waste\nover the 30-year period by an assumed loose\nsolid waste density of 0.3 tons per cubic meter,\nequating to over 233 million cubic meters.\n\na. An amount that equates to \u2026 a \u201cknee-\ndeep\u201d layer of waste over the entire me-\ntropolis (over 630 km2). Since the approximate\nland area of the 17 cities and municipalities of\nMetro Manila is 630 km2 or 630 million m2,\nthen dividing this into the generated solid\nwaste volume (233 million cubic meters) over\nthe 30-year period equates to an average\ndepth of approximately 0.35 meters.\n\nb. \u2026which would fill the country\u2019s largest\nshopping mall over 175 times. Since the\nlargest shopping mall has an approximate vol-\nume of 1.3 million cubic meters, dividing this\ninto the total 30-year solid waste volume of\n233 million cubic meters equates to filling the\nshopping mall over 175 times (233 million\ncubic meters divided by 1.3 million cubic\nmeters).\n\nPage 46-47: Based on leachate sampling,\nPayatas and Rodriguez generate an esti-\nmated 26 kg of lead, and 76 kg of arsenic\nannually, which is released into the\ngroundwater, rivers, lakes, and the bay of\nMetro Manila. Leachate sampling at Payatas\nand Rodriguez indicates combined average\nconcentrations for the two sites of lead (0.21\nmilligram[mg]/liter) and arsenic (0.6 mg/liter).\nAssuming that each site emits on average 2\nliters per second of leachate (therefore 0.42\nmg of lead and 1.2 mg of arsenic per second),\nthen in 1 year, this equates to an average\nfor each site of 13 kg of lead and 38 kg of\narsenic. This is calculated by multiplying the\nquantity per second (in mg) by 3,600 seconds\nper hour, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year,\nand dividing the total by 1 million for the con-\nversion factor of mg to kg).\n\nPage 53: Cumulative waste generation\nover the next 30 years will exceed 70 mil-\nlion tons. This is equivalent to 35 facilities\nof the size of Payatas, or many hundreds\nof facilities the size of Do\u00f1a Petra or\nPalanyag. Although accurate survey data and\nvolume calculations are not available for the\n\ndump sites, the order of magnitude of the\nPayatas dump site waste mass is around\n3-4 million cubic meters, or possibly up to\n2 million tons, therefore 35 such facilities\nwould be needed to dispose of 70 million tons\nof solid waste. The smaller dump sites have\ninferred volumes ranging from less than\n10,000 cubic meters up to several hundred\nthousand cubic meters; therefore several hun-\ndreds of such small dump sites would be re-\nquired to accommodate 70 million tons of\nsolid waste.\n\nPage 54: Over P3.54 billion ($64 million) is\nspent on the collection and disposal of\nMetro Manila\u2019s solid waste, at an average\ncost of about P1,450 (P26.40) per ton.\nBased on review of available financial informa-\ntion provided by the 17 Metro Manila local\ngovernment units (LGUs) during the conduct of\nADB TA 3848-PHI: Metro Manila Solid Waste\nManagement Project, 2003.

Annually, this equates to 63 million\nliters, calculated by multiplying the quantity per\nsecond (2 liters) by 3,600 seconds per hour,\n24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nb. A rate that would fill one 18-wheeled\ntractor trailer tanker truck every 5 hours.\nMultiplying an assumed leachate emission rate\nof 2 liters per second by 3,600 seconds pro-\nvides an estimate volume of 7,200 liters per\nhour. This is equivalent to one 18-wheeled\ntractor trailer tanker every 5 hours (having a\nvolume of approximately 34,000 liters).\n\nPage 72: On the edge of Laguna de Bay, a\ncommunity of 125,000 urban poor is being\nbuilt on 2 million cubic meters of decom-\nposing garbage, at great risk to public\nhealth. Although accurate topographic, engi-\nneering, demographic, and other records are\nunavailable for the area, verbal statements\nfrom site personnel infer that the entire area of\ndumping extends to 80 hectares, and houses\nan urban poor population of 125,000 (25,000\nhomes with an average family size of 5 per-\nsons). From verbal accounts and visual obser-\nvations, solid waste is placed at an average\nthickness of approximately 2.5 meters over\nthe entire 80-hectare area, inferring that ap-\nproximately 2 million cubic meters is present\nimmediately beneath the residential areas\n(2.5 meters thickness, multiplied by 10,000\nsquare meters per hectare, multiplied by 80\nhectares).\n\nPage 74: Each year, the Rodriguez facility\ngenerates over 63 million liters of\nleachate, enough to fill over 28 Olympic-\nsize swimming pools, the bulk of which\nflows into the Marikina River system.\nBased on visual field observations and site\npersonnel discussions, surface leachate emis-\nsions are estimated to average 2 liters per\nsecond. Annually, this equates to 63 million\nliters, calculated by multiplying the quantity per\nsecond (2 liters) by 3,600 seconds per hour,\n24 hours per day, 365 days per year). Since\nan average Olympic-size swimming pool con-\ntains approximately 2.2 million liters (50\nmeters length multiplied by 22 meters width,\nmultiplied by average 2 meters deep, multi-\nplied by 1,000 liters per cubic meter) then the\nannual 63 million liters of leachate would fill\nover 28 Olympic-size swimming pools (63 mil-\nlion liters divided by 2.2 million liters).\n\n95\n\n\fSPECIAL THANKS TO:\n\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources\nSecretary Elisea Gozun, Rafael Camat, Jr.,\nAlbert Magalang, Grace Favila, Ellen Basug,\nEmmy Aguinaldo, Mei Velas\n\nNongovernment Organizations\nAyala Foundation, Inc.\nConcerned Citizens Against Pollution\nFederation of Multi-Purpose Cooperatives\nKaunlaran sa Kalikasan\nLinis-Ganda Foundation\nMiriam Public Education and Awareness Campaign\n\nfor the Environment\n\nMother Earth Limited\nSolid Waste Management Association of the Philippines\nZero Waste Recycling Movement of the Philippines\n\nFoundation\n\nAsian Development Bank\nBradford Philips, Thomas Crouch, Richard S.
