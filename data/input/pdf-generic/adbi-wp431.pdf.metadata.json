For most of the last 60 \nyears,  Asian  FTAs  were  scarce  and  the  ones  that  existed  had  not  been  substantially \nimplemented,  except  for  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Free  Trade \nAgreement  (AFTA).  All  that  changed  in  the  year  2000.  Since  then,  close  to  190  FTAs  have \nemerged  both  within  the  region  and  with  countries  in  other  regions.  The  region  that  at  the \nbeginning of the century had almost no FTAs is now the region with too many to count.  \n\nThis  proliferation  of  Asian  FTAs  has  created  the  so-called  Asian  noodle  bowl  of  trade \narrangements. It poses problems as the agreements are overlapping, complex, and different\u2014\nwith different liberalization schedules, exclusion lists, rules of origin, standards, etc. This carries \nthe  risk  of  becoming  unwieldy  and  makes  doing  business  cumbersome,  particularly  for  small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \n\nThis paper discusses how the costs of the Asian noodle bowl can be reduced, how Asian FTAs \ncan be made consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) global liberalization process, \nand how Asia can remain integrated with the major markets in North America and Europe. One \nobvious solution is to set all most favored nation (MFN) tariffs to zero. But in the absence of this \nfirst-best  solution,  various  attempts  to  multilateralize  Asian  regionalism  are  worth  considering. \nMultilateralizing  regionalism  is  a  catchall  term  for  schemes  that  reduce  the  degree  of \ndiscrimination created by existing FTAs. The ultimate multilateralization would be to extend duty \nfree  treatment  to  all  nations,  thus  eliminating  preferences.  More  modestly,  it  refers  to  plans  to \nknit  together  sets  of  bilateral  and  plurilateral  agreements  in  a  way  that  reduces  discrimination \namong a set of nations\u2014such as those in Asia\u2014who trade intensively among themselves.  \n\nThis  paper  discusses  the  pros  and  cons  of  various  approaches\u2014including  ASEAN-centered \ntrade  agreements  (called  the  ASEAN+  approach)\u2014while  taking  into  account  the  possible \nimplications for cross-regional FTAs, i.e., those with the United States (US)\u2014through the Trans-\nPacific Partnership agreement\u2014and the European Union (EU)\u2014through a future Asia\u2013EU FTA.  \n\n2.  OVERVIEW AND STATE OF PLAY \n\nThis section reviews the state of Asian trade and FTAs. It starts with a discussion of the basic \nfeatures  of  trade  patterns,  tariff  structures,  and  FTAs  in  the  region,  and  explains  how  the \nproliferation of Asian FTAs has created the noodle bowl problem.  \n\n2.1  Asian Trade Patterns and Tariffs \n\nMost  Asian  economies  are  heavily  dependent  on  manufactured  trade.  Leaving  aside  a  few \nnatural  resource-rich  and/or  agricultural  nations\u2014Australia,  Indonesia,  and  New  Zealand\u2014the \nshare of manufactures in exports exceeds 60% and most of them are 70% or higher (Table 1). \nA  similar  pattern  is  found  on  the  import  side,  although  many  Asian  economies  are  substantial \nimporters of primary goods\u2014agricultural products as well as fuels and mining products. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nTable 1: Asian Economies\u2019 Trade Composition (2011) \n\n \n\nShare of Exports (%) \n\nShare of Imports (%) \n\nAgricultural \n\nproducts \n\nFuels & \n\nproducts \n\nAgricultural \n\nproducts \n\nFuels & \n\nproducts \n\nmining \n\nManufactures \n\nmining \n\nManufactures \n\n \n\nJapan \n\nHK, China \n\nKorea, Rep. of  \n\nTaipei,China \n\nAustralia \n\nNew Zealand \n\nSingapore \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nThailand \n\nViet Nam \n\nPRC \n\nIndia \n\n1.3 \n\n2.0 \n\n2.3 \n\n2.2 \n\n12.6 \n\n63.9 \n\n2.5 \n\n24.0 \n\n17.1 \n\n11.2 \n\n20.8 \n\n22.9 \n\n3.4 \n\n11.3 \n\n4.6 \n\n2.5 \n\n11.8 \n\n8.1 \n\n59.0 \n\n9.0 \n\n21.0 \n\n42.2 \n\n20.2 \n\n8.5 \n\n7.0 \n\n11.6 \n\n3.1 \n\n23.7 \n\n11.2 \n\n4.7 \n\n6.6 \n\n5.5 \n\n5.8 \n\n11.1 \n\n3.8 \n\n12.7 \n\n11.3 \n\n11.0 \n\n6.7 \n\n12.3 \n\n8.3 \n\n4.9 \n\n40.1 \n\n5.4 \n\n42.0 \n\n30.1 \n\n18.9 \n\n19.2 \n\n34.4 \n\n26.6 \n\n17.4 \n\n23.3 \n\n23.6 \n\n15.9 \n\n29.6 \n\n39.6 \n\n47.0 \n\n84.6 \n\n51.0 \n\n62.6 \n\n69.1 \n\n66.0 \n\n60.1 \n\n59.9 \n\n69.2 \n\n65.7 \n\n62.4 \n\n68.9 \n\n59.2 \n\n41.4 \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; HK, China = Hong Kong, China. \n\nSource: WTO Trade Profiles, downloaded November 2012. \n\nThe trade policy of these economies is highlighted in Table 2. The first striking feature is the \nvery high fraction of non-agricultural imports that are granted duty-free status. Hong Kong, \nChina; and Singapore are the extremes as they essentially impose no tariffs, and most high-\nincome economies in the region\u2014apart from the Republic of Korea (henceforth, Korea) and \nAustralia with their respective 39% and 50% MFN duty free shares\u2014allow more than two-thirds \nof their non-agricultural imports without tariffs. Major middle-income ASEAN countries\u2014such as \nMalaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand\u2014similarly grant duty free status to non-agricultural imports \non a very large share of their imports, with 77% for Malaysia while the Philippines allows only \n34% of imports duty free. India is the most closed in non-agricultural goods import among the \neconomies listed in the table, with a mere 19% of MFN duty free imports. \n\n88.2 \n\n89.6 \n\n85.3 \n\n87.8 \n\n10.5 \n\n22.0 \n\n68.3 \n\n34.1 \n\n62.0 \n\n79.8 \n\n69.6 \n\n64.0 \n\n93.3 \n\n61.7 \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nTable 2: Aggregated Trade Policy Indicators (2011) \n\nMFN Tariff Rates (%) \n \nNon-agricultural \ngoods  \n\nAgricultural \ngoods \n\nBound   Applied  Bound    Applied  Bound   Applied \n\nMFN Duty Free Imports \n(%) \n\nAll goods \n \n\n \nJapan \nHK, China \nKorea, Rep. of \nTaipei,China \nAustralia \nNew Zealand \nSingapore \nIndonesia \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nThailand \nViet Nam \nPRC \nIndia \n\nNon- \nagricultural \ngoods \n82.6 \n100.0 \n39.3 \n73.7 \n49.9 \n67.9 \n100.0 \n58.0 \n77.4 \n33.9 \n47.3 \n44.0 \n46.0 \n19.2 \n\nAgricultural \ngoods \n \n46.3 \n100.0 \n7.1 \n45.4 \n49.5 \n51.0 \n98.8 \n45.8 \n76.9 \n6.3 \n26.6 \n44.5 \n0.9 \n21.3 \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; HK, China = Hong Kong, China. \n\n5.3 \n0.0 \n16.6 \n6.4 \n10.0 \n10.1 \n10.3 \n37.1 \n23.0 \n25.7 \n28.0 \n11.5 \n10.0 \n48.7 \n\n5.3 \n0.0 \n12.1 \n6.1 \n2.8 \n2.0 \n0.0 \n7.0 \n6.5 \n6.1 \n9.8 \n9.8 \n9.6 \n12.6 \n\nSource: WTO Trade Profiles, downloaded November 2012. \n\n2.6 \n0.0 \n10.2 \n4.7 \n11.0 \n10.7 \n6.4 \n35.6 \n14.9 \n23.4 \n25.5 \n10.4 \n9.2 \n34.6 \n\nTariff \nbinding \ncoverage   \n(%) \n99.7 \n45.6 \n94.6 \n100.0 \n 97.1 \n100.0 \n69.7 \n96.3 \n84.3 \n67.0 \n75.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n73.8 \n\n2.6 \n0.0 \n6.6 \n4.5 \n3.1 \n2.1 \n0.0 \n6.9 \n5.8 \n5.7 \n8.0 \n8.7 \n8.7 \n9.8 \n\n22.8 \n0.0 \n56.1 \n17.5 \n3.5 \n6.0 \n26.9 \n47.0 \n66.8 \n35.1 \n39.9 \n18.5 \n15.7 \n113.1 \n\n23.3 \n0.0 \n48.6 \n16.6 \n1.4 \n1.4 \n0.2 \n8.1 \n10.8 \n8.7 \n22.0 \n17.0 \n15.6 \n31.4 \n\nThe simple average of tariffs is correspondingly low, at least as concerns applied rates. Again, \nHong Kong, China and Singapore have zero applied tariff rates. For high-income economies in \nthe region the applied rates are below 6% for all except Korea, which has a rate of 12%. Tariffs \nare  higher,  often  twice  as  high,  in  middle-income  ASEAN  members,  India  and  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC).  Apart  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  tariffs  on  agricultural  goods \nare  far  higher  than  they  are  on  non-agricultural  goods,  which  include  industrial  products,  fuel, \nand mining products.  \n\nAnother stark feature of the data is the large gap between bound and applied rates in the region. \nApart from Hong Kong, China and Japan that have low bound and applied rates, all other Asian \neconomies have bound their rates many times the level of their applied rates.   \n\nSupply chains \n\nOne  of  the  unique  features  of  Asian  trade  is  vertical  intra-industry  trade  among  the  supply \nchains developed through the region\u2019s economies. That is, technologically advanced economies \nin  the  region  export  sophisticated  parts  and  components  to  less  technologically  developed \neconomies  in  the  region  where  these  are  assembled  into  final  products  and  shipped  to \ndeveloped  country  markets,  especially  the  US,  the  EU,  and  Japan.  Although  this  started  as  a \nsimple  trade,  going  from  Japan  to  ASEAN\u2014and  more  recently  to  the  PRC  as  well\u2014and  then \nexported to the US, Europe, and Japan, it has become a far richer pattern. Now sophisticated \ncomponents  are  supplied  by  Korea  and  Taipei,China  in  addition  to  Japan,  and  less \nsophisticated  parts  and  components  are  produced  by  other  emerging  economies\u2014such  as \nMalaysia and Thailand\u2014and sold to each other.  \n\nThe basic point can be seen in Table 3. Close to 70% of Japan\u2019s exports to East Asia consist of \nintermediate goods and less than 30% of final goods. When exporting to the US, however, the \npattern is reversed, i.e., close to 55% final and 45% intermediates. A more pronounced pattern \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nis seen for Taipei,China; the Republic of Korea; and Malaysia. A similar pattern is observed for \nIndonesia  and  the  Philippines,  albeit  to  a  lesser  extent.  However,  Indonesia  shows  somewhat \ndifferent patterns as it is a major supplier of primary goods for other East Asian economies and \nits  intermediate  good  export  share  to  East  Asia  is  low  at  46%,  though  over  half  of  its \nmanufactured exports to the US are final products (plus primary goods).  \n\nTable 3: Primary, Intermediate, and Final Good Export Shares (%), 2011 \n\n  \n\n  \n\nJapan \n\nPRC \n\nRepublic of Korea \n\nTaipei,China \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nThailand \n\nEast Asia \n\nPrimary \ngoods \n\nFinal \ngoods \n\nPrimary \ngoods \n\nFinal \ngoods \n\nPrimary \ngoods \n\nUS \nInter-\nmediate \ngoods \n\n21.9 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.3 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.8 \n\n8.0 \n\n1.4 \n\n45.3 \n\n26.4 \n\n49.4 \n\n47.2 \n\n21.2 \n\n56.7 \n\n48.9 \n\n26.2 \n\n33.9 \n\n54.5 \n\n73.2 \n\n50.4 \n\n52.6 \n\n56.9 \n\n41.9 \n\n49.4 \n\n65.7 \n\n64.7 \n\nEU27 \nInter-\nmediate \ngoods \n\n21.8 \n\n0.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.3 \n\n7.2 \n\n2.8 \n\n6.4 \n\n2.2 \n\n50.2 \n\n33.3 \n\n52.6 \n\n56.1 \n\n42.4 \n\n63.1 \n\n60.7 \n\n31.7 \n\n40.4 \n\n49.2 \n\n65.8 \n\n47.1 \n\n43.6 \n\n35.9 \n\n29.7 \n\n36.5 \n\n61.9 \n\n57.4 \n\nEast Asia \nInter-\nmediate \ngoods \n\nFinal \ngoods \n\n2.2 \n\n1.8 \n\n1.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n42.0 \n\n8.3 \n\n10.3 \n\n10.7 \n\n5.9 \n\n69.1 \n\n49.0 \n\n78.6 \n\n81.1 \n\n45.8 \n\n76.6 \n\n65.4 \n\n54.8 \n\n64.4 \n\n28.7 \n\n49.2 \n\n20.2 \n\n18.3 \n\n12.3 \n\n15.0 \n\n24.3 \n\n34.5 \n\n29.6 \n\nUS = United States; EU27 = The European Union of 27 Member States; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: RIETI website, http://www.Rieti-tid.com/. \n\nThe patterns for the PRC and to a lesser extent Thailand are somewhat different. The PRC, a \nmanufactured good assembler par excellence, does not export as much in intermediate goods \nas  other  East  Asian  economies  but  exports  final  goods  everywhere.  More  than  70%  of  PRC \nexports to the US, more than 65% of its exports to the EU, and close to half its exports to East \nAsia are final goods. Even for the PRC, however, intermediate products are twice as important \nin their exports to East Asia as they are to the US. The figures for Thailand are less pronounced \nthan those for the PRC, but it also has high shares of final products when exporting to the US \n(more than 65%) and the EU (more than 60%), while producing less in intermediate goods than \nother East Asian economies. Thus the PRC and to some extent Thailand are indeed assembly \nfactories for other supply chain economies in East Asia. \n\nSumming up, East Asian economies tend to produce and sell intermediate goods to each other \nand final products to the US, the EU, and Japan (although the latter two are not shown in the \ntable). As is known by now, this \u201cFactory Asia\u201d trade pattern has been created initially by foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) activities of global multinational corporations\u2014Japanese, European, and \nAmerican\u2014and more recently by firms from within emerging East Asia (Baldwin 2007).  \n\nManufacturing vs. agricultural interests  \n\nThe  tight  relationship  between  FDI  and  intra-East  Asian  trade  in  parts  and  components  also \nmeans that nations\u2019 industrialization strategies are linked to trade with both the regional partners \nand  the  global  markets  in  manufactured  products.  This  creates  an  important  pro-trade \nconstituency  in  the  various  nations,  which  act  to  promote  trade  liberalization  and  maintain \nopenness.  In  short,  the  intertwining  of  corporate  and  national  interests  throughout  the  region \ntends to reduce the mercantilist forces that typically result in domestic industrial protectionism.  \n\nHowever,  several  countries  in  the  region\u2014particularly  Japan,  Korea,  and  some  ASEAN \ncountries\u2014have  large,  not-so-competitive  agricultural  sectors  while  other  countries  are  large \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nexporters  of  agricultural  products.  In  every  region  in  the  world,  trade  in  agricultural  goods  is \nmore politically sensitive than is trade in manufactured goods and Asia is no exception. Much of \nthis  sensitivity  arises  from  the  extremely  diverse  policy  stances  adopted  by  various  nations. \nSome nations welcome food imports while others feel the need to secure sufficient food supply \ndomestically  for  the  population  or  to  protect  their  own  farmers  from  highly  competitive  foreign \nfarmers. This diversity of agricultural interests makes it much harder to arrive at a region-wide \ncooperation that includes both manufacturing and agricultural trade. \n\n2.2  Notable Features of Asian FTAs \n\nThis  section  provides  an  analysis  of  notable  features  and  characteristics  of  East  Asian  FTAs. \nThey include configuration, geographical orientation, and scope (in terms of \u201cWTO-plus\u201d issues). \n\nConfiguration: bilateral vs. plurilateral FTAs \n\nThe configuration of FTAs in East Asia can be divided into bilateral and plurilateral, as in Table \n4 for 2013. Bilateral FTAs refer to agreements between two countries. Plurilateral FTAs include \nseveral forms\u2014agreements involving more than two countries, one country (or countries) and a \ntrading bloc (like ASEAN), or two trading blocs (e.g., ASEAN\u2013EFTA).1 On the whole, countries \nare opting for simple bilateral FTA configurations rather than the more complex plurilateral ones \nas they tend to be easier to negotiate. There were 57 bilateral FTAs (i.e., 79% of the total) and \n15  plurilateral  FTAs  (21%  of  the  total) 2\n  among  72  concluded  FTAs  as  of  February  2013. \nBilateral FTAs also dominate FTAs that are yet to be concluded, making up 68% of those under \nnegotiation and 74% of those proposed.  \n\nTable 4: Number of FTAs in East Asia, 2013 \n\n(By Status, Configuration, and Geographical Orientation) \n\nFTA by Status \n\nNo. of \n\nBy Configuration \n\nBy Geographical Orientation \n\nFTAs \n\nBilateral \n\nPlurilateral \n\nIntra-East Asia  Extra-East Asia \n\nConcluded \n\nUnder Negotiation \n\nProposed \n\n72 \n\n53 \n\n34 \n\n57 \n\n36 \n\n25 \n\nTotal \n\n159 \n\n118 \n\n15 \n\n    17 \n\n9 \n\n41 \n\n28 \n\n8 \n\n7 \n\n43 \n\n44 \n\n45 \n\n27 \n\n116 \n\nNote: East Asia includes the ten ASEAN member countries; Australia; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia; Japan; Republic of Korea; New Zealand; and Taipei,China. Bilateral FTAs involve only two parties, while plurilateral \nFTAs involve more than two parties (e.g., ASEAN). Intra-East Asia FTAs are those among East Asian economies only, \nwhile extra-East Asian FTAs are those between at least one East Asian economy and a partner (or partners) from outside \nEast Asia.  \n\nSource: ADB, Asian Regional Integration Center (ARIC) website.  \n\n                                                \n1\n An issue may arise when a trading bloc with a single authority (like the EU) forms an FTA with a country. Though \nsuch  an  FTA  may  be  considered  as  bilateral,  it  is  plurilateral  in  our  definition  as  in  the  case  of  the  Singapore\u2013\nEFTA, Korea\u2013EFTA, Korea\u2013EU, and Singapore\u2013EU FTAs. Other definitions of bilateral and plurilateral FTAs exist \nin the literature; a bilateral agreement may alternatively include more than two countries where one of them is a \ntrading bloc itself (e.g., the Korea\u2013EU or Singapore\u2013EU FTA) while a plurilateral agreement is an FTA in which the \nnumber of FTA partners exceeds two.  \n\n2  They  include:  the  Asia-Pacific  Trade  Agreement  (APTA);  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Agreement  (AFTA);  the \nPreferential Trade Agreement-Group of Eight Developing Countries; Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership \n(TPP)  Agreement;  ASEAN\u2013PRC  FTA;  ASEAN\u2013Japan  CEPA;  ASEAN\u2013Korea  FTA;  Korea\u2013EFTA  FTA;  Korea\u2013EU \nFTA; Singapore\u2013EFTA FTA; and the Taipei,China\u2013El Salvador\u2013Honduras FTA.  \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nAmong the 15 concluded plurilateral agreements, AFTA stands out for its economic importance \nin  the  region  and  is  establishing  itself  as  a  hub  for  East  Asia\u2019s  FTA  activities  by  forming \nplurilateral FTAs in the region\u2014the so-called ASEAN+1 FTAs. ASEAN has also become a focal \npoint for the  emergence  of a  new  category  of trading-bloc to  trading-bloc  agreement  (e.g., the \nASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand FTA (AANZFTA).  The other concluded plurilateral agreements \nconnect  various  East  Asian  countries  with  others  outside  the  region. 3\n  There  are  also  17 \nplurilateral agreements under negotiation and another 9 under proposal. \n\nGeographical orientation: intra- vs. extra-East Asian FTAs \n\nTable 4 also shows the geographical orientation of East Asian FTAs with economies within the \nregion  and  those  outside.  The  high  degree  of  extra-regional  orientation  of  East  Asian  FTAs  is \nstriking\u2013\u201344 concluded FTAs out of 72 in February 2013 (61% of the total) are with countries or \ngroups outside East Asia. The extra-regional orientation of East Asian FTAs under negotiation \nand proposed is even higher at 85% and 79%, respectively.  \n\nBoth bilateral and plurilateral FTAs exhibit high degrees of extra-regional orientation in a sample \nof  159  FTAs  (including  both  concluded  and  non-concluded).  Japan  has  started  economic \npartnership agreement (EPA) negotiations with the EU, and ASEAN as a group is contemplating \nnegotiations  with  the  EU  after  the  launch  of  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  in  2015.  The \nPRC,  Japan,  Korea,  and  Singapore  have  concluded  extra-regional  agreements  with  Latin \nAmerican  countries.  The  PRC  and  Singapore  are  now  actively  promoting  FTAs  with  African \ncountries. Thus,  East  Asian  economies  have  a strong preference  for maintaining  open  trading \nrelations with the rest of the world rather than becoming inward-looking. \n\nScope: \u201cWTO-plus\u201d elements \n\nThere  are  two  general  trends  globally  in  terms  of  the  scope  of  FTA  provisions.  First,  many \nrecent  agreements  frequently  go  beyond  the  WTO  regulatory  framework  to  include  provisions \non  a  host  of  issues\u2014such  as  the  Singapore  issues  (trade  facilitation,  investment,  government \nprocurement,  and  competition  policy),  intellectual  property,  and  other  measures  (WTO  2011). \nSecond,  FTAs  between  developed  and  developing  countries  often  include  such  provisions, \nwhich  may  reflect  the  emphasis  that  developed  economies  give  to  these  issues.  Agreements \ncontaining  these  broader  provisions  are  sometimes  referred  to  in  the  literature  as  \u201cWTO-plus\u201d \nelements.  \n\nAsian  FTAs  have  indeed  begun  to  address  issues  that  were  not  included  in  the  original WTO \nframework.  The  WTO  system  that  emerged  from  the  Uruguay  Round  in  the  mid-1990s \nconsisted  of  substantive  agreements  on  goods,  services,  Trade-Related  Intellectual  Property \n(TRIPs), and Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs). The subsequent WTO Doha Round \ntrade  talks  initiated  in  2001  have  focused  on  liberalization  in  agricultural  and  non-agricultural \nmarket  access.  The  four  Singapore  issues  (competition,  intellectual  property,  investment,  and \npublic  procurement)  which  were  provisionally  included  in  the  early  work  program  were  later \ndropped at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun in 2004.4\n \n\nThe  Asian  economies  have  begun  to  address  the  WTO-plus  elements  in  their  FTAs.  Earlier \nstudies  showed  that  Asian  FTAs  varied  considerably  in  their  scope  with  some  being  highly \nsophisticated  while  others  were  more  limited  (Banda  and  Whalley  2005;  Plummer  2007). \nHowever,  a  systematic  cross-economy  review  of  the  full  scope  of  Asian  FTAs,  including  more \n\n                                                \n3\n For instance, APTA covers East Asia (the PRC, the Republic of Korea, and Lao PDR) and South Asia (Bangladesh, \n\nIndia, and Sri Lanka). \n\n4\n This section draws from Kawai and Wignaraja (2013). \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nrecent  ones,  reveal  that  the  region\u2019s  FTAs  tend  to  increasingly  embrace  the  WTO-plus \nelements. \n\nFigure  1  shows  the  scope  of  Asian  FTAs  concluded  between  2000  and  2012  by:  (i)  narrow \nagreements  that  deal  with  goods  and/or  services;  (ii)  somewhat  broader  agreements  covering \ngoods,  services,  and  some  Singapore  issues  (partial  WTO-plus);  and  (iii)  comprehensive \nagreements  covering  goods,  services,  and  all  four  Singapore  issues  (comprehensive  WTO-\nplus).  Those  FTAs  shown  in  categories  (ii)  and  (iii)  may  be  considered  WTO-plus  FTAs.  The \nscope  of  concluded  agreements  reflects  a  combination  of  economic  interests,  economic \nstrength, and negotiation capacity. \n\nFigure 1: Scope of Concluded FTAs in Asia Total, 2000\u20132012 (Number of FTAs) \n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\nGoods and/or services\n\nPartial WTO Plus\n\nComprehensive WTO Plus\n\nSource: ADB, Asian Regional Integration Center (ARIC) Website.  \n\n \n\nThe  pattern  is  striking.  Early  Asian  FTAs  seemed  to  be  concerned  largely  with  goods  and \nservices.  From  the  mid-2000s  onwards,  however,  significantly  more  emphasis  was  given  to \nbroad  agreements  with  many  WTO-plus  elements.  By  2012,  16  (23%  of  the  total)  FTAs  were \ngoods  and/or  services  only,  37  (54%)  FTAs  were  partial WTO-plus,  and  16  (23%)  FTAs  were \ncomprehensive WTO-plus. \n\nFigure  2  shows  the  scope  of  Asian  FTAs  by  economy  for  2012.  Three  leading  participants  in \nAsian  FTAs\u2014Japan,  Korea,  and  Singapore\u2014strongly  favor  the  WTO-plus  approach  to  FTAs \nand  tend  to  emphasize  comprehensive  agreements.  All  of  Japan\u2019s  agreements  and  most  of \nKorea\u2019s  and  Singapore\u2019s  are WTO-plus.  Brunei  Darussalam,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam also largely follow the WTO-plus format. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nFigure 2: Scope of Concluded FTAs in Asia by Economy, 2012 (Number of FTAs) \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nn\na\np\na\nJ\n\nC\nR\nP\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n,\ni\ne\np\na\nT\n\ni\n\na\ne\nr\no\nK\n\n \nf\no\n \nc\n\ni\nl\n\nb\nu\np\ne\nR\n\ni\n\na\nn\nh\nC\n\n \n,\ng\nn\no\nK\n \ng\nn\no\nH\n\nl\n\nm\na\na\ns\ns\nu\nr\na\nD\n\n \ni\ne\nn\nu\nr\nB\n\ni\n\na\nd\no\nb\nm\na\nC\n\ni\n\na\ns\ne\nn\no\nd\nn\nI\n\nR\nD\nP\n \no\na\nL\n\ni\n\na\ns\ny\na\na\nM\n\nl\n\nr\na\nm\nn\na\ny\nM\n\ns\ne\nn\np\np\n\ni\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nh\nP\n\ne\nr\no\np\na\ng\nn\nS\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\nd\nn\nI\n\nd\nn\na\n\nl\ni\n\na\nh\nT\n\nm\na\nN\n\n \nt\ne\nV\n\ni\n\nGoods and/or Services Partial WTO Plus Comprehensive WTO Plus\n\nSource: ADB, Asian Regional Integration Center (ARIC) website. \n\n \n\nHistorically,  the  PRC  has  been  relatively  cautious  regarding  the  scope  of  its  FTAs,  preferring \nagreements focusing on goods and services only. More recently, however, the PRC has begun \nto experiment by incorporating some WTO-plus provisions into agreements such as the PRC\u2013\nNew  Zealand  FTA.  Thus,  with  a  few  exceptions,  Asian  economies  are  increasingly  favoring \nWTO-plus rather than narrowly limited agreements. \n\nKawai  and  Wignaraja  (2009)  found  some  additional  noteworthy  points  concerning  WTO-plus \nprovisions  in  Asian  FTAs.  Agreements  between  developed  economies  and  developing  and \nemerging  economies  have  generally  taken  the  WTO-plus  format.  Examples  include  the \nASEAN\u2013Japan  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  Agreement  (CEPA),  the  PRC\u2013New \nZealand  FTA,  the  ASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New  Zealand  FTA,  and  the  Trans-Pacific  Partnership \n(TPP) agreement. Also, Korea and Singapore tend to behave like developed economies in their \nagreements  with  many  developing  economies.  This  behavior  is  visible  in  the  Singapore\u2013PRC \nFTA  and  Korea\u2013Chile  FTA.  Further,  some  existing  FTAs  are  gradually  being  expanded  to \ninclude  WTO-plus  coverage.  Examples  include  the  ASEAN\u2013Korea  FTA.  And  finally,  the  trend \ntowards  increasing  WTO-plus  elements  in  Asian  FTAs  means  that  the  region\u2019s  FTA  activity \nwould likely persist even if the Doha Round trade talks (focusing on liberalization in agricultural \nand non-agricultural market access) were to be concluded in the future. \n\nThe  inclusion  of  WTO-plus  provisions\u2014particularly  the  four  Singapore  issues\u2014would  be \ndesirable  in  all  forthcoming  Asian  FTAs.  The  value  of  such  efforts  should  be  obvious. \nCompetition  policy  and  investment  provisions  are  integral  ingredients  in  facilitating  FDI  flows \nand  the  development  of  production  networks.  Inclusion  of  provisions  on  trade  facilitation  and \nlogistics  development  would  help  lower  transactions  costs  in  conducting  trade.  Cooperation \nprovisions\u2014along  the  line  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Economic  and \nTechnical Cooperation (ECOTECH) agenda\u2014would stimulate technology transfer and industrial \ncompetitiveness. \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\n2.3  The Asian Noodle Bowl: Overlapping Rules of Origin \n\nRules of origin (ROO)\u2014which determine whether certain goods can enjoy preferential bilateral \ntariffs  and  thus  prevent  trade  deflection  among  FTA  members\u2014are  a  particularly  interesting \naspect of East Asian FTAs. For manufactured goods, ROO may be of three types: (i) a change \nin tariff classification (CTC) rule defined at a detailed Harmonized System (HS) level; (ii) a local \n(or  regional)  value  content  (VC)  rule;  and  (iii)  a  specific  process  (SP)  rule.  The  CTC  rule \nrequires  all  the  inputs  to  come  in  under  a  different  tariff  heading  from  the  exported  good,  the \nlocal  (or  regional)  VC  rule  requires  that  a  certain  fraction  of  the  exported  good\u2019s  value-added \ncomes from the country (or region) of an FTA, and the SP rule requires a particular production \nprocess to be performed in the exporting nation. \n\nGiven the rather uncoordinated manner in which FTAs have developed in the region, East Asian \nFTAs  have  used  a  range  of  different  ROO.  The  least  complicated  ROO  are  those  of  AFTA, \nwhich requires a 40% VC rule across the board. Many of the FTAs in the region have ROO that \nare more  restrictive.  The  best  way  to  illustrate the  noodle-bowl  problem  is  to  look  at  the  ROO \napplied to specific products, such as the major auto and auto parts products (Table 5). ASEAN\u2019s \nFTAs vary somewhat in their ROO. For instance, the 40% VC rule applies for AFTA and for the \nASEAN\u2013PRC  FTA,  but  more  stringent  ROO  for  some  products  (e.g.,  45%  VC  applied  for \nHarmonized Commodity Description and Coding System [\nHS] 8703, 8704, and 8708) are found \nin the ASEAN\u2013Korea FTA. Furthermore, the ROO for the same products are different in bilateral \nFTAs involving the same major economy. In the Japan\u2013Malaysia EPA, the VC requirement for \nHS  8703  and  8711  is  60%,  while  in  the  Japan\u2013Thailand  EPA  it  is  40%  for  the  same  two \nproducts.  \n\nTable 5: Varying Rules of Origin in FTAs: Selected Products \n\nProduct \n\n(HS Code) \n\nAFTA \n\nASEAN\u2013Korea \n\nASEAN\u2013PRC \n\nJapan\u2013Thailand \n\nMalaysia \n\nFTA \n\nFTA \n\nEPA \n\nEPA \n\nMotor vehicles for \n\n40% RVC \n\n45% RVC \n\n40% RVC \n\n60% RVC or \n\ntransport of persons, \n\nexcept buses (87.03) \n\ntransport of goods \n\n(87.04) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMotor vehicles for the \n\n40% RVC \n\n45% RVC \n\n40% RVC \n\n50% RVC or \n\nParts and accessories for \n\n40% RVC \n\n45% RVC \n\n40% RVC \n\n40% RVC or \n\nmotor vehicles (87.08) \n\n40% RVC or CTC \n\nCTC \n\nMotor cycles, bicycles, \n\n40% RVC \n\n45% RVC or CTC \n\n40% RVC \n\n60% RVC or \n\netc., with auxiliary motor \n\n(4 digits) \n\n40% RVC or CTC \n\nCTC \n\n(87.11) \n\n  \n\nRVC = Regional Value Content; CTC = Change in Tariff Classifications. \n\nSource: Adapted from Kawai and Wignaraja (2008). \n\nJapan\u2013\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40% RVC or CTC \n\nCTC \n\n40% RVC or CTC \n\nCTC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nLow margins of preference and utilization rates so far \n\nSeveral authors argue that, as least until recently, the preferential tariffs in East Asia\u2014including \nthe Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) in AFTA\u2014have not been much used. Much of \nthe regional trade is in intermediate goods and such goods typically face low applied MFN tariff \nrates,  or  at  least  low  margins  of  preference.  The  basic  point  is  illustrated  in  Table  6.  Tariffs \napplied  among  ASEAN  members  are  not  much  lower  than  those  applied  to  North  American \ngoods. For example, in general machinery and electrical machinery, the margin of preference is \nless than 1 percentage point.  \n\nTable 6: Intra-East Asian Preference Margins vis-\u00e0-vis North America, 2002 \n\nEast Asia \n\nNorth \nAmerica \n\nPreference \nMargin \n\nSector: \n\nMining products (HS25\u201327) \n\nGeneral machinery (HS 84) \n\nElectrical machinery (HS 85) \n\nOthers \n\nPrecision apparatus \n\nTextiles and clothing \n\nPottery products \n\nChemicals \n\nBasic metals \n\n2.6 \n\n1.9 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.7 \n\n1.3 \n\n7.6 \n\n3.6 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.6 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.7 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.8 \n\nNote: Tariff data for 2002.

In  other  words,  the  utilization  rates  were  very  low. \nAccording  to  Manchin  and  Pelkmans-Balaoing  (2007a),  no  comprehensive  statistics  were \navailable  on  the  utilization  rate  of  AFTA  CEPT,  but  an  often-quoted  figure  puts  it  at  5%.  This \nfigure,  however,  appears  to  change  as  the  preference  schedules  are  fully  implemented.  For \nexample,  a  paper  by  Chirathivat  (2008)  reports  that  Thai  firms\u2019  utilization  rate  of  AFTA  CEPT \naverages 27%, with their utilization at 81% for transport equipment trade. However, recent data \navailable from a study by Udomwichaiwat (2012) suggests that FTA use has risen significantly; \nthe overall reported FTA use by enterprises in Thailand had risen to 61% in 2011. \n\nRules of origin complexity \n\nStudies  of  ROO  in  East  Asia  indicate  that  complex  ROO  can  raise  transactions  costs  to \nbusiness  firms  and  that  multiple  ROO  in  overlapping  FTAs  can  be  particularly  burdensome.5\n \nThe  textile  and  garment  sector  tends  to  be  affected  by  stringent  and  restrictive  ROO.

One  of  the  implications  is  that  the \npresence of multiple ROO may further increase administrative costs.  \n\nEconometric  evidence  also  suggests  that  the  preferences  do  matter  on  the  items  where  the \nmargins  of  preference  are  significant  (Manchin  and  Pelkmans-Balaoing  2007a).  This  implies \nthat  the  low  utilization  rates  in  early  years  are  unlikely  to  continue  as  the  preference  margins \nexpand with fuller implementation of East Asian FTAs. Here it is important to note that AFTA, all \nthe  ASEAN+1  FTAs,  and  most  other  FTAs  in  the  region  have  been  implemented  first  for \ndeveloped  countries  and  then  are  gradually  implemented  in  the  least  developed  nations  by \n2020. As firms increase trade and more FTAs are concluded, multiple ROO can become a more \nserious  problem  for  East  Asia  in  the  future.  In  short,  the  noodle  bowl  complexity  should  really \nstart to bite over the next few years.  \n\nResults of firm surveys  \n\nFirm surveys are useful to highlight the business impacts of multiple ROO in East Asia. Insights \nat  a  regional  level  are  provided  by  the  ADB  enterprise  surveys  conducted  in  the  PRC,  Japan, \ninformation  on  enterprise \nPhilippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand.  The  surveys  provide \nperceptions  of  whether  dealing  with  multiple  ROO  in  the  region\u2019s  FTAs  significantly  adds  to \nbusiness costs. \n\nFirst, given the present level of concluded FTAs in the region, evidence suggests that multiple \nROO impose only a limited burden on Asian enterprises. Of the 922 enterprises responding to \nthis concern, only 197 (21%) said that multiple ROO significantly added to business costs. The \nmajority of the sample enterprises did not presently find multiple ROO a problem. \n\nSecond,  the  surveys  unexpectedly  found  that  larger  Asian  enterprises  had  greater  negative \nperceptions  of  multiple  ROO  than  did  SMEs  (Figure  3).  This  finding  presented  an  interesting \npuzzle.  Econometric  analysis  showed  that  large  established  enterprises  tended  to  export  to \nmultiple markets and adjust their business plans in response to FTAs. They are, therefore, more \nlikely  to  complain  about  issues  of  multiple  ROO  (Kawai  and  Wignaraja  2011).  Smaller \nenterprises, in contrast, tend to export to a single market and hence do not have much basis for \ncomplaining.  \n\nThird,  the  majority  of  surveyed  enterprises  would  prefer  to  be  able  to  select  the  specific  ROO \nincluded  in  FTAs.  The  surveys  suggest  that  enterprises  are  supportive  of  having  alternative \nROO  for  the  same  product:  (i)  if  they  cannot  reach  the  value-content  requirement,  having \nalternative  ROO  might  enable  enterprises  to  still  make  use  of  FTA  preferences;  (ii)  as \napplications  using  the  value-content  rule  often  require  confidential  cost  information,  many \nsuppliers and enterprises are reluctant to divulge such information; and (iii) particular ROO are \nfrequently  aligned  with  the  technology  and  production  process  of  particular  industries  and  are \nless pertinent to all others. \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nFigure 3: Burden Imposed by Multiple Rules of Origin in FTAs \n(by % of Respondents by Enterprise Size) \n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nJapan\n\nPRC\n\nSingapore\n\nPhilippines\n\nThailand\n\nNote: SME (small- and medium-sized enterprise) = 100 or fewer employees; Large (enterprise) = 101 to 1,000 employees; \nGiant (enterprise) = more than 1,000 employees. \n\nSME\n\nLarge Giant\n\n \n\nSource: Kawai and Wignaraja (2011). \n\nThe  general  finding  of  limited  burdens  imposed  by  multiple  ROO  does  not  mean  that \npolicymakers  should  be complacent  about  this  topic.  As the  number  of  concluded  agreements \nincreases, multiple ROO may well become more of a problem for more enterprises. Supportive \nmeasures\u2014such  as  encouraging  rationalization  of  ROO  and  upgrading  their  administration\u2014\nare needed to mitigate the future negative effects of the Asian noodle bowl. \n\nWidespread  gains  in  Asian  economies  are  possible  from  pursuing  simplified  approaches  to \nROO.  These  would  involve  harmonizing  ROO,  addressing  the  accumulation  of  value  content, \nand  coequality  of  ROO.6\n  It  would  be  extremely  useful  to  identify  and  adopt  international  best \npractices  in  ROO  administration.  Such  practices  might  include  introducing  a  trusted-trader \nprogram (as used in the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA]), allowing successful \napplicants to self-certify their own certificates of origin, allowing business associations to issue \nfee-based certificates of origin, increasing the use of information technology-based systems of \nROO administration, and better training of SMEs to enhance their capacity to use FTAs. \n\n                                                \n6\n\n Harmonized  ROO  means  the  same  rules  of  origin  are  applied  across  multiple  FTAs.  Co-equal  ROO  means \nalternative ROO for the same products are available in an FTA and enterprises are free to choose between them. \nAccumulation of value content provisions allows the use of non-domestic inputs from a specific economy or group \nof economies (with such inputs taken as originating in the FTA partner economy claiming origin) as determining \nthe products origin. See Kawai and Wignaraja (2011). \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\n3.  ONGOING MULTILATERALIZATION EFFORTS \n\n3.1  Efforts Without Strong Leaders \n\nIn  East  Asia,  the  efforts  to  multilateralize  Asian  FTAs  have  been  pursued  without  a  regional \nhegemon  as  in  the  case  of  North  America,  or  a  group  of  strong  leaders  as  in  the  case  of \nEuropean integration. \n\nLack of a hegemon or a bi-polar alliance in East Asia \n\nThe lack of a regional hegemon is an important complicating factor for East Asian regionalism. \nA regional hegemon plays many roles, but the relevant one here is as regulator and harmonizer \nof  regional  trade  arrangements.  By  their  very  size,  the  US  in  North  America  and  to  a  lesser \nextent  in  Latin  America,  and  the  EU  in  the  Euro-Med  region  act  as  coordinators  and \nharmonizers  of  regional  trade  arrangements.  For  example,  they  tend  to  orchestrate  greater \ncoherence in ROO.  \n\nEast  Asia  has  two  large  economies\u2014the  PRC  and  Japan\u2014but  neither  has  emerged  as  a \nregional  hegemon  in  the  way  that  the  US  and  EU  have  done  in  their  respective  regions.  This \ncomplicates matters since the lack of coordination and centralized orchestration can result in a \nmore mottled set of trade arrangements. Efforts to multilateralize regionalism find it harder to get \nstarted when no dominant player is in the leadership seat. \n\nIn  Western  Europe,  there  was  no  dominant  hegemon  that  led  the  European  economic \nintegration process. The original six members of the European Economic Community\u2014the three \nBenelux  nations,  France,  Germany,  and  Italy\u2014formed  a  core  group  that  eventually  led  to  the \ncreation of a single market, the EU, and the euro area. In this context, a bi-polar alliance formed \nby France and Germany played a critical role in strengthening the six-country core group. \n\nIn East Asia, although neither the PRC nor Japan may play a hegemon role, the two countries \nhave  not  forged  a  bi-polar  alliance,  comparable  to  the  Franco-German  alliance  in  Europe,  to \naccelerate  regional  trade  and  investment  integration.  Despite  the  difficult  bilateral  political \nrelationship,  the  PRC  and  Japan may further  deepen  their economic relationship  including  the \nformation of a trilateral FTA involving Korea. But it may take some time before they start to think \nseriously about the importance of their bi-polar alliance. \n\nEmergence of ASEAN as the regional \u201chub\u201d \n\nThe  lack  of  a  regional  hegemon  or  a  bi-polar  alliance  between  Japan  and  the  PRC  has,  by \ndefault, led to ASEAN playing a key coordinating and convening role on trade (and other) issues \nin  East  Asia.  ASEAN  has  emerged  as  a  natural  \u201chub\u201d  for  multilateralizing  East  Asian  FTAs. \nFirst,  it  has  a  long,  successful  track  record  as  the  \u201cconvener\u201d  of  discussions  on  Asian  trade \narrangements.  In  particular,  the  ASEAN-led  talks  (ASEAN+3,  ASEAN+6,  East  Asia  Summit, \netc.) are already a formal, well-accepted feature of the diplomatic landscape. Second, ASEAN \nhas  systematically  engaged  the  major  trading  partners  either  explicitly  as  in  the  case  of  the \nPRC,  Japan,  Korea,  India,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  EU  or  less  directly\u2014and \nsometimes  individually\u2014in  the  case  of  the  US.  Third,  because  key  production  networks  are \nrooted in ASEAN and major economies are linking to ASEAN via ASEAN+1 FTAs, there is an \neconomic and commercial logic backing the role that ASEAN has been playing. \n\nBeyond trade issues, ASEAN has been able to secure a core position in the ASEAN+3 process \nparticularly for financial cooperation, the newly created East Asia Summit (EAS, or ASEAN+8) \nprocess  for  wider  economic  and  political  issues,  and  the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum  for  security \narrangements. The ASEAN+3 leaders agreed in 2004 that the establishment of an East Asian \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\ncommunity is a long-term objective, with the formation of an East Asian FTA and an East Asia \nInvestment  Area. When  the  PRC  and  Japan,  respectively,  proposed  an  East  Asia  Free  Trade \nArea  (EAFTA  among  ASEAN+3  countries)  and  a  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  for \nEast  Asia  (CEPEA  among  ASEAN+6  countries)  for  East  Asia,  and  could  not  agree  on  which \none  to  pursue,  ASEAN  suggested  a  new  concept,  the  ASEAN  Framework  for  a  Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), by de facto supporting the ASEAN+6 approach, \nwhich the PRC accepted. \n\n3.2  ASEAN, APEC, and ASEAN+ Efforts \n\nEast Asia has two regional institutions that help coordinate and facilitate cooperation\u2014ASEAN, \nwhich dates back more than 45 years, and APEC, which was created at the end of the 1980s. \nAlthough  very  different,  the  existence  of  these  two  organizations  provides  a  forum  for \nmultilateral consultation and cooperation. \n\nASEAN Economic Community \n\nEast  Asia\u2019s  trade  multilateralization  process  began  with  ASEAN  and  its  strengthening  of \neconomic  integration  among  the  diverse  member  states.  Under  AFTA,  the  six  original \nsignatories eliminated tariffs altogether by 2010 and the four newcomers are expected to do so \nby 2015. Having also adopted the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) in 1995 \nand  the  ASEAN  Investment  Area  (AIA)  in  1998,  ASEAN  began  the  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity building initiative to make ASEAN a single market and production base by 2015. In \nmoving in this direction, ASEAN members adopted the \u201cASEAN Charter\u201d to establish the group \nas  a  rules-based  legal  personality,  improve  the  decision-making  process,  and  accelerate \neconomic integration. \n\nThis whole process of regional economic integration, which is expected to result in the ASEAN \nEconomic  Community  (AEC),  has  forced  its  member  states  to  coordinate  on  liberalization  of \ntrade in goods and services and of investment. Once the AEC is established, ASEAN becomes \na  more  integrated,  coherent  region  and  can  more  easily  work  with  global  players  for  deeper \nglobal links.  \n\nAPEC\u2019s open regionalism \n\nEstablished  in  1989,  APEC  has  encouraged  trade  and  investment  liberalization  in  a  voluntary \nand  unilateral  fashion  as  a  trans-regional  forum  with  the  basic  principle  of  \u201copen  regionalism.\u201d \nAPEC has also focused on trade and investment facilitation, which has had significant impacts \non trade and investment flows. \n\nAPEC\u2019s unilateral, voluntary approach has helped East Asian economies in reducing the MFN \ntariffs\u2014with  notable  examples  being  the  then  non-WTO  members,  such  as  the  PRC  and \nTaipei,China.  By  lowering  the  MFN  tariff  either  to  zero  or  to  low  levels  for  manufacturing \nproducts,  such  as  mechanical  and  electrical  parts  and  components.  This  has  promoted  intra-\nindustry  trade  in  these  products,  while  reducing  the  incentives  to  use  FTA  preferences  in \nexporting these products.  \n\nAPEC has also seen some technocratic moves to \u201ctame the tangle\u201d of FTAs. The most notable \nis  the  Best  Practice  Guidelines  for  FTAs  which  provide  suggestions  for  \u201cbest  practice\u201d  FTAs. \nThese  guidelines  have  been  little  used  but  the  very  exercise  helps  sensitize  nations  to  the \nissues\u2014especially nations which are new to the FTA game. ASEAN also has initiatives aimed \nat harmonizing the bilateral deals. For example, the ASEAN Investment Area strives to reduce \ndiscord among the many investment provisions.  \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\nASEAN+1 processes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nAs has been pointed out above, ASEAN has been the hub for ASEAN+1 FTAs with its dialogue \npartners. The  existence of  ASEAN\u2019s  rather  liberal  ROO  has  provided  a  guideline  that  reduces \nthe degree of arbitrariness in the many FTAs in the region, particularly ASEAN+1 FTAs.  \n\nThe \u201cplus-3\u201d countries have taken somewhat different approaches to their respective ASEAN+1 \nFTAs. Japan has taken the approach to first conclude comprehensive bilateral FTAs with major \nASEAN  members  individually  and  then  to  forge  a  comprehensive  ASEAN+1  FTA.  Japan \nadopted  this  approach  as  its  interest  was  to create  a  comprehensive  EPA  that  captures many \n\u201cWTO-plus\u201d issues like investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, labor mobility \nand standards, and other types of cooperation measures. These issues vary across countries, \nso Japan decided to go for bilateral EPAs first. The presence of these bilateral EPAs facilitated \nthe  negotiations  of  the  ASEAN\u2013Japan  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  Agreement \n(CEPA)  as  most  of  the  fundamental  issues  had  been  resolved  within  bilateral  EPAs.  What \nJapan needed to ensure at the last stage was to make regional cumulation of ROO available for \nall the signatories. \n\nIn  contrast,  the  PRC  and  Korea  started  to  negotiate  liberalization  of  goods  trade,  followed  by \nservices  trade  and  then  investment.  Although  the  modality  was  somewhat  different  from  the \ncase of Japan, these two economies are expected to come up with comprehensive \u201cWTO-plus\u201d \nFTAs. \n\n3.3  Cumulation of ROO Content Requirements \n\nThe PRC, Japan, and Korea have all implemented or concluded their ASEAN+1 FTAs, and we \ncan  find  ROO  cumulation  provisions  in  their  respective  agreements  (see  Box  1).  This  is  a \nsignificant development in that these \u201cplus-3\u201d countries can be considered to be de facto as part \nof  ASEAN  as  far  as  ROO  regional  cumulation  is  concerned.  This  will  benefit  in  particular  the \nproducers of these countries and consumers in East Asia. The benefits to Japanese and Korean \nmultinationals are particularly large. \n\nA  regional  ROO  cumulation  provision  included  in  the  ASEAN\u2013Japan  CEPA  (or  AJCEPA)  is  a \nmajor  step  forward  in  making  an  FTA  conducive  to  trade.  With  the  cumulation  provision,  a \nJapanese  firm  exporting  a  major  component  (with  a  value  content  of,  say,  US$70)  to  its \nsubsidiary in Thailand by using Japan\u2013Thailand (or Japan\u2013ASEAN) EPA preferences, can now \nexport  its  processed  products,  with  a  total  value  of  $100,  from  Thailand  to  Malaysia  by  using \nAJCEPA and AFTA even if the value-added in Thailand is only US$30, i.e., less than 40% of the \nfinal value-added requirement under the usual AFTA CEPT arrangement. Such trade would not \nhave been possible without a regional cumulation provision.  \n\nHowever,  a  problem  still  remains  when  a  Japanese  firm  wishes  to  export  its  product  from \nThailand to the PRC, because the ASEAN\u2013PRC FTA does not regard this product as a regional \nproduct\u2014rather, it is considered to be a joint product by Japan (70%) and Thailand (30%)\u2014and \nhence would not be granted tariff preferences. What is clearly needed is the next step where the \n\u201cplus-3\u201d  (or  \u201cplus-6\u201d)  countries  with  FTAs  with  ASEAN  can  cumulate  value  contents  among  all \ntheir members. \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nBox 1: ROO Cumulation Provisions in ASEAN+1 FTAs \n\nASEAN\u2013Japan CEPA\u2014Article 29 Accumulation  \n\u2022  Originating materials of a Party used in the production of a good in another Party shall be \n\nconsidered as originating materials of that Party where the working or processing of the good \nhas taken place. \n\nASEAN\u2013Korea Agreement on Trade in Goods\u2014Rule 7 Accumulation  \n\u2022  Unless otherwise provided for in this Annex, a good originating in the territory of a Party, which \nis used in the territory of another Party as material for a finished good eligible for preferential \ntariff treatment, shall be considered to be originating in the territory of the latter Party where \nworking or processing of the finished good has taken place. \n\nASEAN\u2013PRC Agreement on Trade in Goods (ACFTA)\u2014Rule 5: Cumulative Rule of Origin  \n\u2022  Unless otherwise provided for, products which comply with origin requirements provided for in \nRule 2 and which are used in the territory of a Party as materials for a finished product eligible \nfor preferential treatment under the Agreement shall be considered as products originating in the \nterritory of the Party where working or processing of the finished product has taken place \nprovided that the aggregate ACFTA content (i.e., full cumulation, applicable among all Parties) \non the final product is not less than 40%. \n\nSource: ADB ARIC FTA Database. \n\n4.  OPTIONS FOR THE FUTURE \n\nThere is a strong case for multilateralizing East Asian regionalism. The current disorganization \nof East Asian trade arrangements is growing ever more complex. Worse yet, if nothing is done \nto  \u201ctame  the  tangle,\u201d  the  ongoing  implementation  of  preferential  tariff  cuts  combined  with \noverlapping ROO and uneven sectoral coverage poses a risk to the highly efficient intra-regional \ntrading system we have today.  \n\nSomething  must  be  done.  There  is  a  need  to  broaden  the  country  coverage  of  FTAs  and  to \nweave the matrix of bilateral FTAs into a more cohesive arrangement. There is also a need to \nbroaden the area of cumulation and provide facilitation to help SMEs cope with complex ROO. \nThere is also a need to deepen FTAs in terms of liberalization measures and policy scope, by \nincluding a wide range of trade in goods (both manufactured and agricultural) and services as \nwell  as  \u201cWTO-plus\u201d  issues\u2014that  is,  investment,  labor  mobility  and  standards,  intellectual \nproperty rights, competition policy, dispute settlement, and the like. International trade cannot be \nexpanded without a conducive climate for international business, which involves a tightly knitted \npackage  of  cross-border  movements  of  goods,  services,  capital,  know-how,  technicians,  and \nmanagers. Setting tariffs to zero simplifies international business, but is far from sufficient.  \n\nTwo  facts  condition  the  modalities  for  \u201ctaming  the  tangle.\u201d  First,  East  Asia  engages  in  a  great \ndeal  of  intra-regional trade,  but  it  is  also  linked to  the  rest  of  the  world, especially  the  EU  and \nUS.  For  this  reason,  trade  arrangements  that  are  primarily  inward-looking  will  not  serve  the \nregion\u2019s commercial interest. This implies that the narrow, inward-looking option is off the table. \nSecond,  in  the  absence  of  a  regional  hegemon  or  a  bi-polar  alliance  to  play  the  leadership \nrole\u2014as in other regions\u2014ASEAN has emerged as the regional body most firmly established as \nconvener of talks on regional trade issues. This goes a long way to narrowing down a range of \nmodalities for multilateralizing Asian regionalism.  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\n4.1  Extending the ASEAN+ Approach \n\nWhat  is  the  optimal  scope  for  ASEAN-centered  Asian  trade  arrangements?  While  other \nconfigurations  can  be  envisaged,  the formulations  that  seem most  relevant  in  the  medium run \nare first the consolidation of East Asian intra-regional FTAs into either an ASEAN+3 FTA (called \nthe  East  Asia  Free  Trade  Area,  or  EAFTA)  or  an  ASEAN+6  FTA  (called  the  Comprehensive \nEconomic  Partnership  in  East  Asia,  or  CEPEA).  The  East  Asian  countries  initially  could  not \nagree on which one they should pursue between PRC-supported EAFTA and Japan-supported \nCEPEA. But finally in 2012, they agreed to begin negotiations for a RCEP among the ASEAN+6 \ncountries  and  its  first  negotiation  started  in  2013.  The  second  part  of  the  formulations  is  for \nselect Asian economies to extend relationships with extra-regional groups, especially the US (or \nNAFTA) and the EU. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is an important vehicle to strengthen \nthe Asia\u2013US trade relationship. \n\nCase for a RCEP among ASEAN+6 countries  \n\nCurrently,  the  complex  matrix  of  ASEAN+1  FTAs  are  in  place.  Some  \u201cplus\u201d  countries  have \nalready come up with, or are negotiating for, their bilateral FTAs among themselves\u2014like those \nfor  PRC\u2013New  Zealand,  Japan\u2013India,  Korea\u2013India,  and  PRC\u2013Australia.  Combining  these \nASEAN+1 FTAs and other bilateral FTAs among the \u201cplus\u201d countries, the East Asians can forge \nan  ASEAN+3  or  an  ASEAN+6  FTA.  Such  a  consolidation  of  overlapping, multiple  FTAs  into  a \nsingle, region-wide FTA can make a significant positive contribution.  \n\nThe computable general equilibrium (CGE) models based on the Global Trade Analysis Project \n(GTAP)  provide  useful  insight  into  the  welfare  gains  from  alternative  FTA  scenarios  in  East \nAsia.7 Numerical results by Kawai and Wignaraja (2008) show that the two East Asia-wide FTA \nscenarios\u2014ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6 FTAs\u2014offer much larger gains to world income than any \nof  the  three  ASEAN+1  FTA  scenarios.  They  also  demonstrate  that  the  ASEAN+6  FTA \nscenario\u2014which  is  broader  in  terms  of  country  coverage\u2014offers  larger  gains  to  world  income \nthan the ASEAN+3 FTA scenario. This supports the rationale for a RCEP, which is essentially \nan  ASEAN+6  FTA.   \nBreakdowns  of the  world  income figures for the  ASEAN+3  and  ASEAN+6 \nFTA  scenarios  also  indicate  that  the  gains  to  members  of  the  FTAs  are  significant  while  the \nlosses to non-members (e.g., the US) are relatively small. \n\nA strategy towards a RCEP \n\nTwo fundamental trade-offs emerge when considering the ASEAN+6 option. On the one hand, \nbroadening  the  list  of  participants  tends  to  boost  efficiency  by  reducing  discrimination  and \npromoting  liberalization.  On  the  other  hand,  decision-making  tends  to  get  more  difficult  as \nnumbers and diversity of interests rise.  \n\nIn  Europe, for  instance, there  has  been  a  clear  trade-off between  the  depth  of  integration  that \ncan  be  achieved  and  the  number  of  participants.  The  solution  has  been  to  have  a  very  broad \nparticipation  in  the  duty-free  trade  area  (all  of  the  EU28,  the  EFTA  nations,  and  many \nMediterranean nations) but to draw the circle more tightly for deeper integration. For example, \nfree movement of goods, services, people, and capital applies only to the EU28, although EFTA \nnations participate in most of this via the European Economic Area agreement. Even inside the \nEU28 there are circles. Only some EU members are part of the currency union, and not all are \nmembers of the passport-free travel zone known as the Schengen Area. \n\n                                                \n7\n See, for instance, Cheong (2005); Plummer and Wignaraja (2006); Zhang et al. (2006); and Kawai and Wignaraja \n\n(2008). \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nIn  the  Western  Hemisphere,  NAFTA  was  relatively  easy  to  negotiate  and  implement,  but  the \nwider  Free  Trade  Area  of  the  Americas  was  brought  down  by  an  overly  wide  diversity  of \npositions. \n\nIn  East  Asia,  to  forge  a  RCEP  among  the  ASEAN+6  countries,  some  sequencing  may  be  a \nrealistic path to take. This could be done in theory by consolidating all existing ASEAN+1 FTAs, \neven without having FTAs among all the \u201cplus-6\u201d countries. Indeed, currently there is no single \nbilateral  FTA  among  the  \u201cplus-3\u201d  countries\u2014the  PRC,  Japan,  and  Korea  (CJK).  If  the  16 \ncountries  were  to  start  negotiations  for  a  RCEP,  with  all  ASEAN+1  FTAs  in  place  but  without \nFTAs  among  the  key  \u201cplus-6\u201d  countries,  then  in  this  whole  consolidation  process  the  \u201cplus-6\u201d \ncountries would have to negotiate among themselves, not to mention the need for negotiation to \ncoordinate  across  the  existing  ASEAN+1  FTAs.  This  is  doable,  but  would  be  messy. 8\n  To \nsmoothen  negotiations  for  a  region-wide  FTA,  it  would  be  preferable  if  bilateral  FTAs  were  in \nplace  among  all  the  \u201cplus-6\u201d  countries  along  with  ASEAN+1  FTAs.  This  would  facilitate  the \nnegotiations  among  the  ASEAN+6  countries  considerably.  For  this  reason,  it  is  vital  for  the \nPRC,  Japan,  and  Korea  to  start  serious  negotiations  among  their  FTAs.  Despite  political \ndifficulties, the three countries agreed in 2012 to launch negotiations on a CJK FTA.  \n\nIn  the  end,  the  exact  starting  configuration  for  harmonization  efforts  may  prove  less  important \nthan  is  often  thought.  In  other  regions,  the  domino  effect  tends  to  bring  in  nations  that  were \ninitially reluctant to participate. This happened, for instance, in Europe with the United Kingdom \n(UK)  and  other  European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA)  nations  that  stayed  out  of  the \nEuropean  Economic  Community  (EEC)  6  initially,  but  soon  changed  their  minds  and  asked  to \njoin once it was clear that the arrangement was working. Similarly, Mercosur started small but \nits  membership  spread  as  the  benefits  of  participation  and  the  risks  of  exclusion  became \nclearer. \n\nConnecting East Asia with the US and the EU \n\nRelationships with the US\u2014and increasingly with the EU\u2014are critical for the East Asian region, \nboth economically and politically. APEC remains important for East Asia and the US because it \nis the only multilateral economic forum that connects the US with East Asia. The recent move to \nforge  a  TPP  is  an  attempt  to  connect  the  US  with  a  select  group  of  East  Asian  economies \nthrough  a  high-quality,  comprehensive  FTA.  The  Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM)  has  not  been \nactive  in  pursuing  trade  and  investment  liberalization  between  East  Asia  and  Europe,  but  it  is \ntime to consider a scenario for linking East Asia with the EU. \n\nThe US and East Asia \n\nBilateral  FTA  talks  started  between  the  US  and  several  countries  in  the  region.  These  have \nbeen  concluded  with  Singapore,  Australia,  and  Korea.  A  series  of  talks  between  the  US  and \nsome  of  the  major  ASEAN  nations\u2014Thailand  and  Malaysia  in  particular\u2014were  launched  in \n2004,  but  have  come  up  against  a  variety  of  objections  by  the  Asian  nations  to  the  US  FTA \ntemplate  which  typically  includes  free  trade  in  the  US\u2019s  major  agricultural  exports  as  well  as \ngovernment procurement liberalization, and conditions touching on labor and the environment. \nThe expiration (in June 2007) of the US Administration\u2019s negotiating authority, known as Trade \nPromotion Authority (TPA), has not helped matters. \n\nThe  US  has  advocated  strengthening  economic  ties  among  APEC  members  through  the \nformation  of  an  APEC-wide  free  trade  area  (i.e.,  the  Free  Trade  Area  of  the  Asia  Pacific \n[FTAAP]).  FTAAP  could  serve  as  a  useful  step  in  reviving  the  currently  stalled  Doha  Round \n\n                                                \n8\n In Latin America, for example, rather than trying to negotiate entry into NAFTA, Chile de facto \u201cjoined\u201d NAFTA by \n\nsigning separate (but very similar) bilaterals with the US, Canada, and Mexico. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\ntrade  talks  or  offer  an  alternative  \u201cPlan  B\u201d  solution  should  the  Doha  Round  trade  talks  fail \n(Bergsten 2007; Hufbauer and Schott 2009). Creation of FTAAP would likely take many years, \ninvolving  negotiations  among  all  21  member  economies.  Given  the  large  number  of  APEC \nmembers, a smaller group might more successfully initiate the process. \n\nA smaller FTA, the TPP, is attracting a growing number of economies sympathetic to its goal of \nhigh-standard liberalization (Markheim 2008). TPP started as the Pacific Four (P4) Agreement, \na  plurilateral  FTA  among  Brunei  Darussalam,  Chile,  New  Zealand,  and  Singapore  that  came \ninto  force  May  2006.9\n  The  agreement  eliminated  90%  of  all  tariffs  among  member  economies \nupon  entry  into  force  and  will  completely  eliminate  all  trade  tariffs  by  2015.  Since  the  US \nannounced in 2008 its intent to begin comprehensive negotiations with the P4 economies to join \nthe  agreement,  six  more  countries\u2014Australia,  Canada,  Malaysia,  Mexico,  Peru,  and  Viet \nNam\u2014have joined the talks. Japan also joined the negotiations in July 2013. \n\nThe TPP is often viewed as a key element in a strategic US pivot to Asia. It would solidify US \neconomic,  political,  and  security  links  with  the  Asia-Pacific  economies  for  future  decades \n(Gordon  2012).  Given  its  substantial  potential  benefits,  TPP  would  have  a  better  chance  of \novercoming  US  domestic  opposition  (from  trade  unions  and  the  US  automotive  industry)  to \ntrade liberalization than would the Doha Round trade talks or new bilateral FTAs. \n\nThe goal of the TPP would be to achieve a comprehensive 21st century FTA covering not only \ntariff reductions and services-trade liberalization but also a large number of WTO-plus issues\u2014\nsuch  as  competition,  environmental,  and  labor  standards,  intellectual  property,  investment, \npublic  procurement,  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures,  and  technical  barriers  to  trade. \nRegarding market access, in principle all tariffs are eliminated. Non-tariff barriers to trade will be \nsubstantially reduced and behind-the-border regulatory reforms would be pursued to guarantee \ndomestic markets are open and transparent.  \n\nThe EU and East Asia \n\nThere are some signs that the launch of TPP negotiations has led the EU to intensify its efforts \nin the region. This sort of defensive FTA, or domino effect, is often observed.  \n\nTrade relations between East Asia and some European nations have proceeded rapidly. EFTA \nhas  already  signed  an  FTA  with  Singapore  (2003)  and  Korea  (2006).  Switzerland,  the  only \nindustrial exporter in EFTA, now has an EPA with Japan and Thailand, and is at a negotiation \nstage  with  Indonesia  and  the  PRC.  The  willingness  of  EFTAns  to  leave  out  agriculture\u2014\nespecially  sensitive  items  such  as  beef  and  rice\u2014has  made  it  relatively  easy  to  find  common \nground  on  bilateral  FTAs  with  East  Asian  nations.  This  fact  augurs  well  for  the  much  more \ncommercially  important  trade  pacts  that  the  EU  is  contemplating,  but  the  situation  is  different. \nFollowing a long tradition going back to the Cold War, EFTA is willing to largely ignore politically \nsensitive aspects such as democracy, and social and environmental policy.  \n\nIn mid-2007, the EU began FTA negotiations with ASEAN as a whole. These talks have been \ncomplicated by the fact that the EU would have trouble signing agreements with non-democratic \ngovernments,  which  may  force  the  EU  to  negotiate  with  the  more  economically  advanced \nASEAN  members.  Indeed,  talks  on the  EU\u2019s  standard,  less-than-FTA  bilateral  deals,  so-called \nPartnership and Cooperation Agreements, have already been launched with the major ASEAN \nmembers. While  the  EU  is  willing  to  exclude  agriculture\u2014a  fact  that  makes  trade  agreements \n\n                                                \n9\n The  TPP,  previously  known  as  the  Pacific  Three  Closer  Economic  Partnership  (P3\u2013CEP),  among  Chile,  New \nZealand, and Singapore, launched its first negotiations at the 2002 APEC Leaders\u2019 Summit. In April 2005, Brunei \nDarussalam joined, and the original agreement was signed by the four countries in June 2005. The trade bloc then \nbecame known as the Pacific\u20134. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\neasier  with  most  ASEAN  countries\u2014some  ASEAN  members  have  their  own  reservations, \nparticularly  commercial  concerns  about  their  high-tech  industries.  The  negotiations  have  been \nsuspended, and ASEAN wishes to resume negotiations after the AEC is launched in 2015. \n\nA  successful  conclusion  of  an  ASEAN\u2013EU  FTA  can  boost  the  possibility  of  a  larger,  trans-\nregional  East  Asia\u2013EU  FTA.  Once  the  EU  joins  the  ASEAN+1  process,  it  would  be  easier  to \nbegin negotiations to form a cross-regional FTA between the ASEAN+6 countries and the EU. If \na RCEP among the ASEAN+6 countries is to be forged by then, it would be like one more party \njoining  the  ASEAN+6  process,  where  the  EU  would  negotiate  with  the  \u201cplus-6\u201d  countries.  Of \ncourse,  the  whole  negotiation  process  would  be  easier  if  these  \u201cplus\u201d  countries  already  had \nFTAs  in  place  with  the  EU\u2014like  a  Korea\u2013EU  FTA  (implemented),  an  India\u2013EU  FTA  (under \nnegotiation),  and  a  Japan\u2013EU  EPA  (under  negotiation).10\n  If  a  RCEP  is  not  in  place,  an  East \nAsia\u2013EU  FTA  negotiation  process  would  be  more  difficult  as  the  East  Asians  will  have  to \nnegotiate not only with the EU but also among themselves. This is another reason why the East \nAsian countries would be well advised to consolidate their FTAs into a single, region-wide FTA \nbefore formally negotiating for a larger, inter-regional FTA.  \n\n4.2  Ideas for Multilateralizing Regionalism: What Might Work in Asia? \n\nAt  the  September  2007  conference  he  hosted  on  the  issue  of  multilateralizing  regionalism, \nPascal Lamy, Director General of the WTO, closed the conference by stating that it was time to \nmove from words to actions. He said that we had moved \n\n \u201c\u2026 from a discussion of the pros and cons of regional trade agreements to a discussion on how \ndo we cope with that and how do we multilateralise these agreements to gain both in coherence \nand  in  economic  efficiency,  taming  the  tangle,  as  we  said.  And  this  means,  rolling  up  our \nsleeves  and  looking  into  many  'nitty  gritty'  issues  as  we  have  to  do  it  in  the  World  Trade \nOrganization.\u201d   \n\nHis  remarks  have  stimulated  a  good  deal  of  fresh  thinking  on  regionalism  and  how  the  WTO \nshould  deal  with  it.  Here  we  look  at  how  these  ideas  might  translate  into  the  Asian  context \n(Table 7).  \n\nAsian \u201cTransparency Mechanism\u201d on FTAs \n\nOne element of the noodle-bowl syndrome is the difficulty of understanding what is included in \nthe  many  FTAs.  Since  this  knowledge  is  expensive  to  develop  but  cheap  to  disseminate,  it \nwould be a good idea to have one of the regional bodies provide this regional public good. For \nexample,  a  reinforced  ASEAN  Secretariat,  APEC  Secretariat,  or, more  immediately,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), could undertake studies of the FTAs in the region in the spirit of the \nWTO  Transparency  Mechanism.  The  signatory  nations  of  these  FTAs  should,  as  part  of  this \ninitiative,  agree to  cooperate fully  in  providing  the  necessary  details,  documents,  and  data.  As \nthe surveys discussed above pointed out, this would be welcomed by many firms in the region, \nespecially SMEs. \n\nthe \n\nMoreover,  given \nfast  evolving  nature  of  preferential  and  unilateral  (autonomous) \nliberalization  in  the  region,  it  might  be  worth  revisiting  the  major  FTA  (e.g.,  AFTA  and  the \nvarious ASEAN+1 deals) at regular intervals, say every three years. As part of this, the regional \n\u201cTransparency  Mechanism\u201d  could  play  the  role  of  an  information  clearing  house  devoted \n\n                                                \n10\n\n EU\u2019s  negotiations  with  India  have  proven  more  difficult  than  with  Korea  (agreed  and  already  implemented)  and \nwith Japan (negotiations underway).  \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nespecially  to  the  details  of  FTAs  including  tariffs,  rules  of  origin,  and  deeper-than-tariff \nprovisions in services, investment, and the like.  \n\nTable 7: Ideas for Multilateralizing Asian Regionalism \n\nTiming:  \n\nShort-term \n\nMedium-term \n\nActor: \n\n \n\nRegional Bodies \n\n\u2022  Establish an Asian \u201cTransparency \n\n(ASEAN \n\nSecretariat, \n\nAPEC \n\nSecretariat, \n\nADB, etc.) \n\nRTAs \n\nMechanism\u201d for main FTAs, which plays \nthe \u201cinformation clearing home\u201d role in \nAsian FTAs \n\n\u2022  Start negotiations on two best-practice \n\ntemplates for future RTAs; first based on \nthe ASEAN model (developing nation \nFTAs), second on the ASEAN+1 model \n(for developing-developed FTAs)  \n\u2022  Allow plurilateral cumulation in ROO \n\u2022  Adopt 3rd\n\n Party MFN clauses in service \n\nand investment provisions \n\n\u2022  Adopt development-friendly rules of \n\norigin where possible \n\nNations \n\nMFN tariff cutting; and consider binding \nthem in the Doha Round \n\u2022  Autonomously extend GATS+ \n\ncommitments to all WTO members \n\n\u2022  Propose global free trade in \n\nindustrial goods (at least parts \nand components) \n\u2022  Negotiate plurilateral \n\nconvergence of rules of origin. \n\u2022  Adopt \u201ceither/or\u201d rules of origin \n\nto reduce problems of \noverlapping rules  \n\n\u2022  Switch to value added rules of \norigin and implement \u201cLloyd \ntariffs\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\nregional templates \n\nIndividual \n\n\u2022  Continue unilateral (or autonomous) \n\n\u2022  Negotiate new RTAs based on \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 application to Asia of Baldwin, Evenett, and Low (2009), Table 3; and Baldwin and Thornton (2008), \nTable 6.1. \n\nTo  make  this  work,  the  ASEAN+6  nations  should  commit  to  the  new  mechanism  and  ensure \nthat new and existing FTAs are reported on time. Where possible, this should include expanded \ndata reporting, especially on services.  \n\nAs  there  are  already  a  number  of  excellent  databases  on  tariffs,  this  new  mechanism\u2019s  main \nvalue-added  could  come  in  the  area  of  services.  Under  the WTO\u2019s  Transparency  Mechanism, \nmembers  are  supposed to  submit general  economic  statistics  on  services,  but  not  necessarily \nthe  regulatory  policies  and  practices  that  confer  preferences  on  firms  from  FTA  member \ncountries.  Given  the  potential  noodle  bowl  in  GATS+  regional  deals  in  Asia,  gathering  more \ninformation on barriers to services trade and the commitments made in the various FTAs would \nhelp \u201ctame the tangle\u201d without directly impinging on members\u2019 freedom. \n\nBest-practice FTA templates \n\nIn  both  Europe  and  North  America,  the  presence  of  a  hegemon  has  helped  harmonize  the \nFTAs. While there is substantial variation across FTAs in each region, there is also coherence \nimposed  by  the  hegemon,  at  least  on  the  hub-and-spoke  FTAs  signed  by  the  hegemon.  The \ncommercial  importance  of  these  hub-spoke  ties  has  had  the  knock-on  effect  of  leading  the \nspoke-spoke FTAs to mimic key elements of the hegemonic template.  \n\nIn  the  absence  of  an  East  Asian  hegemon,  this  role  has  been  played  by  ASEAN.  But  in \nASEAN+1 FTAs, the AFTA templates have not always been used, partly because FTA partners \nare often developed countries\u2014like Japan and Australia\u2013New Zealand. It is useful, therefore, if \none  of  the  regional  institutions\u2014such  as  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  (if  it  has  the  additional \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nresources),  the  APEC  Secretariat,  and  the  ADB\u2014can  come  up  with  voluntary  best-practice \ntemplates for FTA disciplines. In the Asian context, there would need to be two such templates, \none for FTAs among developing nations and  another for FTAs that involve the developed and \ndeveloping nations\u2014and thus must be Article 24 compliant under WTO rules.  \n\nOf  course,  this  should  build  on  the  APEC\u2019s  excellent  initiative,  but  more  efforts  are  needed  to \ninduce  developing  countries  to  become  serious.  The  APEC  initiative  has  yielded  \u201cmodel \nchapters\u201d on trade in goods, technical barriers to trade, transparency, government procurement, \ncooperation,  dispute  settlement,  trade  facilitation,  rules  of  origin,  sanitary  and  phytosanitary \nstandards, and e-commerce. According to Hufbauer and Schott (2009), the model chapters tend \nto follow chapters of the US\u2013Chile FTA and the US\u2013Australia FTA. These authors also note that \nthe APEC work has had little impact as nations have continued to follow national templates. \n\nHelping least-developed Asian countries with regionalism\u2019s challenges \n\nThe  noodle  bowl  is  more  of  a  problem  for  poor  and  small  nations  since  they  are  struggling  to \nenter the competition for investments and technology that will enable them to participate in the \nAsian production networks.  \n\nOne idea would be to encourage Asian nations which sign FTAs with the least-developed Asian \nnations  to  suspend  or  greatly  simplify  ROO.  The  basic  idea  is  simple.  The  formal  reason  for \nROO is to avoid tariff fraud, e.g., goods made in Japan being imported duty free into, say, the \nPRC via, say, Lao PDR (when both Japan and the PRC have FTAs with Lao PDR but not with \neach other). However, if Lao PDR in this example has higher MFN tariffs than the PRC\u2014which \nis the case for many goods\u2014then no firm would have an incentive to divert imports via Lao PDR \nfor  the  purposes  of  avoiding  tariffs.  To  allow  Lao  PDR  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  trade,  its  FTA \npartners may suspend or simplify ROO.  \n\nA  second  part  of  this  concerns  rules  of  cumulation.  An  important  part  of  industrial \ncompetitiveness in today\u2019s world is an efficient supply chain. For small nations, especially small \ndeveloping  nations,  this  means  importing  many  of  the  parts  and  components  used  in  their \nmanufactured  exports.  Bilateral  cumulation  rules  hinder  efficient  sourcing  of  parts  and \ncomponents and thus discourage industrialization in small, developing nations. As noted above, \nmany  of  the  East  Asian  FTAs  have  been  careful  to  allow  broad  cumulation  rules,  the  main \nmissing links concern imports from the PRC, Japan, and Korea. Since Japan and Korea are the \nmain  sources  of  many  parts  and  components,  the  lack  of  cumulation  on  an  ASEAN+6  basis \nhinders  outsourcing  to  the  less  developed  Asian  nations.  Moreover,  while  the  basic  ASEAN \nROO already allow for regional cumulation, there is a minimum value-added rule (20%) for parts \npurchased  in  AFTA  before  the  parts\u2019  value  can  be  used  for  the  AFTA  40%  VC  rule.  For  least \ndeveloped  nations\u2014like  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Myanmar\u2014this  condition  could  be  relaxed. \nAbundant research shows that ROO can be very restrictive\u2014and especially trade-dampening\u2014\nwhen  they  are  combined  with  restrictive  \u201crules  of  cumulation.\u201d  Broadening  these  rules  of \ncumulation can reduce the restrictiveness of regionalism. \n\nHarmonizing ROO  \n\nOne  very  large  area  in  which  progress  could  be  made  would  be  to  encourage  regional \nharmonization  of  ROO.  A  good  example  can  be  found  in  the Western  Hemisphere.  Currently, \nEast Asia is marked by dozens of different sets of ROO. Globally, there are three broad families \n(Estevadeordal, Harris, and Suominen 2007). The oldest family is the Latin American Integration \nAssociation ROO that are not very restrictive, and the modified form has been embraced by the \neconomically  large  Mercosur trade  bloc.  At the  other  extreme  of  the  complexity/restrictiveness \nscale are the NAFTA ROO and their application to many bilaterals signed by the NAFTAns. One \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nstep  toward  multilateralizing  Asian  regionalism  would  be  to  encourage  the  harmonization  of \nROO for ASEAN countries.  \n\nThird party MFN clauses \n\nMany  FTAs  contain  what  might  be  called  automatic  anti-\u201cspaghetti  bowl\u201d  clauses.  These \nanticipate  the  likelihood  that  the  signing  nations  will  sign  more  FTAs  with  third  parties.  The \nclauses  agree  to  automatic  adjustments  to  the  original  FTA.  Since  these  clauses  tend  to  give \nthe same degree of access to all parties, they reduce the possibility that signing more FTAs will \nmake the region an even more complicated environment for businesses.  \n\nThe classic examples are third Party MFN clauses (also called \u201cnon-party MFN\u201d), often found in \nservices FTAs. These say, in essence, \u201cwhatever preference either of us gives to someone else \nin the future will be automatically extended to each other.\u201d Instead of each new FTA adding a \nnew strand of spaghetti, the third party MFN makes it into an every expanding \u201clasagna plate.\u201d \nCurrently, agreements include such clauses for only certain preferences, mainly on services and \ngovernment procurement. However, more extensive use could help tame the tangle. \n\nUnilateral liberalization \n\nThe  most  obvious  and  effective  part  of  unilateral  anti-\u201cnoodle  bowl\u201d  policy  is  the  autonomous \ncutting of applied MFN tariff rates. This practice is already very widespread in East Asia, and it \nhas been pursued within APEC as unilateral, voluntary liberalization which can be enjoyed not \nonly  by  APEC  members  but  by  non-members as  well.  It should  be  encouraged  more.  It  could \nalso  be  usefully  applied  to  the  ASEAN+1  nations.  However,  unilateral  liberalization  may  face \nincreasing  difficulties  because  governments  may  be  more  willing  to  provide  market  access  to \nforeign trade partners through FTA trade negotiations. \n\nWhile  unilateral tariff cutting  has  attracted  a good  deal  of attention,  trade facilitation measures \ncan  have  effects  similar  to  those  of  unilateral  liberalization  in  terms  of  reducing  costs  of \ncrossborder  trade.  A  similar  move  is  underway  in  certain  types  of  services,  especially \ninfrastructure and transport services that are useful to manufacturing exports. \n\nAn Asia-wide free trade zone for industrial goods \n\nIn  many  sectors,  applied  tariffs  are  quite  low\u2014especially  in  the  mechanical  and  electrical \nmachinery sectors. If the EU\u2013ASEAN FTA talks succeed, world trade in these goods will be very \nclose  to  duty  free.  This  might  provide  the  opportunity  to  negotiate  an  FTA-like  agreement \ncovering all of East Asia, or even the world. \n\n5.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nThere  has  always  been  a  strong  case  for  harmony  in  East  Asian  regionalism  and  the \ndevelopment  of  \u201cFactory  Asia\u201d  strengthens  the  case.  East  Asia  is  at  present  marked  by  a \nthoroughly interdependent network of trade and investment\u2014a network which is now critical to \nthe  industrial  competitiveness  of  all  nations  in  the  region.  The  unique  features  of  the  region, \nhowever,  meant that  regionalism  developed  along market-driven  lines  for  decades  rather than \nalong the more traditional formal-FTA lines. This has changed in the new century.  \n\nEast Asia has gone from a region with almost no FTAs to a region with too many to count. This \nexplosion  of  trade  arrangements  has  developed  without  any  organizational  plan,  guiding \nprinciples,  or  de  facto  hegemon.  The  result  has  been  a  disorganized  set  of  dissimilar  trade \ndeals\u2014the  famous  noodle  bowl  problem.  Since  most  of  the  FTAs  have  only  recently  been \nsigned, the actual degree of discrimination has only recently begun to bite. As a consequence, \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nthe noodle bowl\u2019s impact has so far not been overwhelming for regional business. However, as \nthe noodle bowl FTAs are moving from tariff-cutting promises to actual tariff cutting, the costly \nimpact  of the  complex  and  overlapping  rules  of origin  and the  patchy  coverage  will  start  to  be \nfelt by firms in the region. \n\nThis is why it is time to start designing the future course for multilateralizing Asian regionalism. \nThe key outcomes should include: (1) a weaving together of the matrix of bilateral FTAs into a \nmore cohesive arrangement, by broadening the country coverage of FTAs and deepening FTAs \nin terms of liberalization measures and policy issues, and (2) a widening of the range of trade in \ngoods covered (both manufactured and agricultural) and services as well as WTO-plus issues\u2014\nthat is, investment, labor mobility and standards, intellectual property rights, competition policy, \nand dispute settlement. Modern international business in trade\u2014especially in Asia\u2014involves a \nweb  of  \u201cthings\u201d  crossing  borders  (goods,  services,  capital,  know-how,  information,  technicians \nand  managers,  etc.).  \u201cFactory  Asia\u201d  involves  much  more  than  trade  in  goods,  so  its  trade \narrangements should address much wider business issues.  \n\nThe  unique  features  of  Asian  trade  help  establish  guiding  lighthouses.  First,  although  Asia \ntrades a great deal with itself, it is also very dependent on external markets for final good sales, \nso  an  inward-looking  solution  would  not  serve  the  region\u2019s  commercial  interests.  Second, \nASEAN  has  emerged  as  the  regional  hub  for  FTAs  and  a  convener  of  talks  on  regional  trade \nissues.  \n\nThese  two  facts  go  a  long  way  to  narrowing  down  the  range  of  modalities  for  multilateralizing \nAsian  regionalism.  They  suggest  that  the  modalities  for  taming  the  tangle  within  the  region \nwould  most  naturally  fall  to  an  ASEAN+6  configuration,  with  the  +6  nations  signing  FTAs  with \nASEAN and among themselves and eventually setting up an East Asia-wide FTA. The fact that \nASEAN is engaged directly or indirectly with the major markets for \u201cFactory Asia\u2019s\u201d output (the \nEU  and  the  US)  suggests  that  ASEAN  might  also  be  a  natural  hub  for  ensuring  that  Asian \nregionalism is inclusive.  \n\nWhile  discussion  of  the  overarching  architecture  of  Asian  regionalism  is  an  important \ndiscussion, there are a number of actions to be taken in the meantime to multilateralize Asian \nregionalism.  Some  of  these  can  be  done  unilaterally  at  the  national  level  (especially  cutting \napplied MFN tariffs), at the regional level (e.g., ASEAN-led talks on harmonizing rules of origin \nand  allowing  either/or  rules  to  reduce  the  cost  of  multiple  sets  of  rules  of  origin),  and  at  the \nglobal level (supporting a WTO action agenda on regionalism).  \n\nThis paper has suggested a number of these more modest, more technical steps on the road to \ntaming the Asian noodle bowl. These will require extensive discussion and preparation at every \nlevel  of  trade  ministries  in  Asia.  The  ASEAN  Secretariat,  with  sufficient  resources,  could  be  a \nnatural focal point for these efforts.  \n\nThe  range  of  ideas  for  multilateralizing  regionalism  is  extremely  broad.  Perhaps  the  biggest \ncontribution would be to establish a forum where such ideas could be discussed. In the current \nclimate  of  trade  diplomacy,  most  East  Asian  nations  are  focused  on  their  own  bilateral  and \nplurilateral  partners.  They  will  find  cooperation  and  coordination  to  be  mutually  beneficial.  As \nreducing the cost of complex trade arrangements is inevitably a rather technical matter, national \nexperts should work hard to develop cooperative possibilities before bringing the matter to the \npolitical level.  \n\nA  very  good  analogy  is  the  work  of  the  International  Standards  Organization  and  the  World \nCustoms Council. These bodies have shown that continuous, technical discussion can create a \nflow of modest improvements for the business climate. Why not start this process in Asia? \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 431 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n          Baldwin and Kawai \n\nBaldwin, R. 2007.
