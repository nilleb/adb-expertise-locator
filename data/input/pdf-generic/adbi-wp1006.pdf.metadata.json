INTRODUCTION \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nCash is a useful instrument for payment of goods and services and other transactions. \nCash remains essential in many economies today and will likely remain relevant in the \nfuture, since cash is likely to be used often by the elderly and marginalized, low-income \npeople. Cash becomes useful especially when natural disasters (such as earthquakes, \ntyphoons,  hurricanes)  or  military  conflicts  cause  serious  damage  to  communities  and \npeople\u2019s  daily  lives  by  generating  power  shortage  and  destruction  of  buildings  and \ncomputer  system.  Thus,  many  central  banks  view  that  retaining  some  level  of  cash  \nin  the  society  could  be  useful,  despite  high  cash-handling  cost  and  prevalent  \ncash-associated crimes. \n\nConceptually,  cash  is  central  bank-issued  money.  It  is  the  safest,  liquid  payment  and \nfinancial instruments for the public. Cash fulfills the following basic functions of money\u2014\nthat is; unit of account, means of exchange, and store of value. Cash is legal tender and \nan official medium of payment determined by the government through the passage of \nlaw that requires creditors to accept debt service payment in the legal tender. Cash is \nalso  used \nremains  \nan important means of payment, but it is increasingly being taken over by private sector-\nissued money, such as bank deposits and other cashless and contactless tools. Central \nbank-issued  money  consists  not  only  of  cash,  but  also  reserve  balances  of  financial \ninstitutions  with  a  central  bank.  Generally,  cash  and  reserve  balances  constitute  the \nliability of the balance sheets of a central bank. \n\nfor  public  charges  and \n\nthe  public,  cash \n\ntaxes.  For \n\nFactors Contributing to Demand for Cash \n\nCash  demand  of  the  public  is  generally  influenced  by  (1)  transaction  motive  used  for \npayment,  (2)  opportunity  cost,  (3)  precautionary  motive,  and  (4)  other  motives. \nTransaction motive reflects demand for cash used for payments of goods and services \nas well as other transactions, which is likely to strengthen with an expansion in economic \nactivities (normally proxied with nominal gross domestic product GDP). The opportunity \ncost for holding cash is related to the financial return arising from the close substitutes \nof cash, such as retail deposit rates paid by commercial banks to the public or cost of \nholding credit cards and bank cards (such as various fees or annual fees charged for the \ncard  membership).  Generally,  cash  utilization  tends  to  decline  as  GDP  per  capita \nincreases due to greater access to bank deposits, debit cards, credit cards, and other \ncashless payment instruments. Moreover, the higher the opportunity cost, the lower the \ndemand for cash becomes. As a related indicator, inflation also influences cash demand. \nLow inflation means that the opportunity cost of holding cash is low since the value of \ncash remains stable. Precautionary motive reflects demand for cash among households \nand firms that tends to grow at the time of financial and economic crises and/or a sharp \ndecline in risk appetite among investors. Moreover, firms may maintain some liquidity \nassets in the form of cash to ensure smooth business operations even in a normal period. \n\nOther motives include aging, tax-saving purposes, informal or illegal activities, and cash \ndemanded  from  abroad.  Cash  is  prevalent in  economies  with  a large share  of  elderly \npopulation due to the habits and affinity for using cash as compared with the economies \nwith a small share of elderly population. Some elderly people stop using credit cards after \nretirement. Cash demand from abroad is large for the case of the United States given \nthat  the  US  dollar  is  the  most  important  reserve  currency,  invoice  currency  used  for \ninternational  trade  and  debt  issuance,  vehicle  currency  used  for  various  foreign \nexchange transactions, as well as safe haven currency. Also, an increase  in frequent \nforeign  tourists,  businesspersons,  and  students  may  raise  cash  demand  for  foreign \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\ncurrencies, especially when the exchange rates are perceived to be favorable (Flannigan \nand Parsons 2018). Thus, demand for cash tends to grow with an expansion of economic \nactivities,  a  decline  in  the  opportunity  cost,  an  intensification  of  precautionary  motive, \nand other motives. \u201cCash hording\u201d is defined as cash lying idle that is not being utilized \nfor  payments  and  thus  could  be  driven  by  the  opportunity cost,  precautionary  motive, \nand other motives. \n\nCash in Circulation Determined by Demand Factors  \n\nA  central  bank  normally  determines  the  amount  of  cash  to  be  issued  passively  by \nresponding to changes in demand for cash. Therefore, the amount of cash in circulation \nmainly reflects the demand-driven factors mentioned above\u2014rather than supply-driven \nor issuer-side factors\u2014and are thus beyond the control of a central bank. A central bank \nissues and circulates cash through the banking system by providing commercial banks \nwith cash demanded by withdrawing the equivalent amount from their reserve balances \nwith  a  central  bank;  these  commercial  banks  then  distribute  the  acquired  cash  to  the \npublic on demand through windows of bank branches and/or automated teller machines \n(ATMs). It should be noted that the conduct of monetary policy (such as open market \noperations) directly influences the amount of reserve balances, not the amount of cash, \nalthough  monetary  policy  indirectly  influences  cash  demand  through  adjustment  of \ninterest rates.  \n\nThe value of cash is stable in an economy where a central bank successfully conducts \nmonetary  policy  in  accordance  with  the  price  stability  mandate  (mostly,  specified  at \naround  2%  in  advanced  economies)  and  thus  avoids  substantially  high  inflation  or \nserious deflation. Most of the public do not differentiate cash and retail deposits and view \nthem  as  close  substitutes  partly  because  both  are  denominated  in  the  same  unit  of \naccount (i.e., legal tender) and partly because providers of retail deposits are regulated \nby tight banking regulations and deposits are guaranteed up to the certain amount per \naccount holder set by the deposit guarantee system in many economies. \n\nIn recent years, cashless and contractless payments methods have increasingly become \nprevalent  in  the  world  through  various  conventional  tools  (such  as  credit  cards,  debit \ncards)  and  innovative  convenient  financial  services  using  mobile  phones  and  smart \nphones. Nevertheless, cash in circulation has been rising in many economies especially \nafter the global financial crisis. The rising trend is prevalent, even in advanced economies \nnotwithstanding that the public normally has had full access to bank accounts and credit \ncards for long periods of time and other cashless and contactless payment tools in recent \nyears.  The  low  interest  rate  environment  appears  to  have  affected  the  rising  trends. \nMeanwhile, emerging/developing economies continue to issue cash partly because their \nnominal  GDP  growth  rates  have  been  greater  than  those  of  advanced  economies. \nInterestingly, some emerging economies, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nhave \nthe  \nratio  of  cash  in  circulation  to  nominal  GDP.  This  may  indicate  that  the  Chinese  have \ngained  access  to  the  bank  accounts  and/or  other  non-bank  cashless  payment  and \nfinancial services.  \n\nexperienced \n\ndecline \n\nin \n\na \n\nThe rising trends on cash in circulation might have several impacts on monetary policy \nas well as the economy. On the one hand, greater cash hoarding results in the erosion \nof the effectiveness of monetary policy through weakening the money creation process. \nOn  the  other  hand,  greater  cash  issuance  increases  a  central  bank\u2019s  income  through \ngreater seigniorage. Moreover, greater cash utilization deteriorates the efficiency in the \neconomy  owing  to  high  cash-handling  costs  arising  from  the  direct  fees  (i.e.,  cost  of \npaper and design fees to prevent counterfeiting) and indirect cost (i.e., the security and \npersonnel cost associated with the maintenance of cash provision and payment services \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nby  commercial  banks,  shops,  firms,  and  individuals).  Cash  prevalence  may  also \ndiscourage new technology firms to enter into innovative payment and financial activities.  \n\nTherefore, it is important to investigate the recent movement on demand for cash in the \nworld.  This  paper  focuses  on  the  movements  of  cash  in  circulation  by  investigating \ndemand-driven  factors  contributing  to  the  movements  for  the  period  2000\u20132018.  The \npaper covers 22 economies\u2014eleven advanced (Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Euro \nArea, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom, \nand the United States), and 11 emerging/developing economies (Brazil, the PRC, India, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, the Russian Federation, Thailand, \nand  Turkey).  The  paper  is composed  of  five  sections.  Section  2  focuses  on  the  time-\nseries movements of cash in circulation among 22 economies for the period 2000\u20132018. \nThe paper also differentiates between advanced and emerging/developing economies \ndue  to  the  well-developed  banking  system  in  the  case  of  former  and  the  presence  of \nlarge unbanked population in the case of latter. Section 2 also highlights the movements \nof banknotes in circulation differentiated by denomination in the economies whose data \nare available\u2014covering Canada, the Euro Area, Japan, Republic of Korea, Poland, the \nUnited Kingdom, and the United States. Section 3 provides an empirical analysis with \nregards to the cash demand function for three economies\u2014the Euro Area, Japan, and \nthe United States\u2014that have separately shown the rising trend and have also conducted \nlarge-scale unconventional monetary easing after the global financial crisis. Section 4 \ndemonstrates an empirical analysis on cash demand covering all the 22 economies for \nthe period 2000\u20132018. Section 5 concludes. \n\n2.  GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS OF CASH  \n\nIN CIRCULATION  \n\nThis section focuses on the movements of cash demand by examining cash in circulation \nboth  as  a  percent  of  nominal  GDP  and  in  terms  of  the  amount  with  regards  to  22 \neconomies for the period 2000\u20132018. It also focuses on the movements of the number \nof banknotes outstanding issued differentiated by denomination for the seven economies \nwhose data are available. As higher-value banknotes may be more closely associated \nwith  cash  hoarding,  it  is  important  to  look  at  the  movements  of  the  highest-value \nbanknotes to make further investigations to changes in cash demand.  \n\n2.1  Divergent Movements of Cash in Circulation in the World \n\nThere are various indicators tracing the movement of cash in circulation. For example, \nKiaonarong  and  Humphrey  (2019)  used  four  indicators  to  measure  the  cash  usage  \nfor  payment:  cash  in  circulation  as  a  ratio  of  nominal  GDP;  difference  between  \ntotal  consumption  and  the  amount  of  all  non-cash  payment  instruments  used  in \nconsumption as a ratio of total consumption; the amount of cash withdrawn from ATMs \nand  banks\u2019  windows  as  a  ratio  to  total  consumption;  and  the  amount  of  all  cash \nwithdrawals as a ratio to cash plus the amount of non-cash payment instruments. This \npaper  views  cash  in  circulation  as  a  ratio  of  nominal  GDP  as  a  preferred  indicator  to  \nthe  three  other  indicators  since  the  focus  of  this  paper  is  cash  demand  driven  not  \nonly  by  the  transaction  or  payment  motive,  but  also  by  the  aforementioned  factors \n(opportunity  cost,  precautionary  motive,  and  other  motives).  The  22  economies  are \nclassified as either advanced economies and emerging/developing economies because \nthe degree of the public\u2019s access to the banking system is likely to generate different \nimpacts on cash demand depending on the stage of economic development. While bank \naccounts are widely available to the public in advanced economies, the public\u2019s access \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nlimited \n\nremain \n\nto  bank  accounts \nin  many  emerging/developing  economies.  \nThe gradual decline in the unbanked population in the latter economies may promote \nfinancial inclusion and encourage the public to shift transaction or settlement instruments \nfrom cash-based to cashless-based such as debit cards, credit cards, and other tools \nsuch  as  PayPal  and  Apple  Pay,  thereby  helping  to  lower  the  ratio  of cash  to  nominal \nGDP ratio. For these economies, a decline in the cash ratio may suggest higher levels \nof  financial  inclusion,  strengthened  financial  intermediation  function  of  the  banking \nsystem,  and  improved  monetary  policy  transmission  mechanism.  It  could  be  also \nassociated with greater transparency and efficiency as a result of reduced activities in \nthe informal economy and in illegal activities. The demand for cash will be stimulated \nfurther with an increase in the ATM networks and declined charges applicable to ATM \nusage and cash/debit cards. \n\nCash Demanded by Households and Firms \n\n(that \n\nrates \n\ninterest \n\nrepresent  opportunity  cost), \n\nDemand  for  cash  by  households  and  firms  is  determined  largely  by  various  motives  \nas already pointed out in the previous section. Namely, most of these motives are heavily \ninfluenced  by  the  pace  of  economic  activities  (which  heavily  influence  the  transaction \nmotive), \nthe  occurrence  of \neconomic/financing  crises  (that  tend  to  strengthen  precautionary  motive),  and  other \nfactors  such  as  pace  of  aging  and  safe  haven  demand  from  abroad.  Generally, \nhouseholds  are  the  largest  holders  of  cash  among  economic  entities  (such  as \nhouseholds,  firms,  financial  institutions,  and  governments)  because  of  their  frequent \npurchases of daily goods and services with low-value banknotes. Households are often \nsensitive to interest rates since ordinary/checking bank accounts are a close substitute \nfor  cash,  as  both  such  bank  deposits  and  cash  serve  as  payment  tools  for  daily  \nsmall-value transactions payments and serve to store value.  \n\nFollowing  households,  non-financial  firms  are  generally  the  second  largest  holder  of \ncash. They demand cash (and cash equivalents such as checking accounts) mainly due \nto  precautionary  motives  because  of  the  need  to  maintain  the  flexibility  in  their  daily \ntransactions  and  business  decisions  related  to  mergers  and  acquisitions  (M&A)  and \nresearch  and  development  (R&D)  in  the  face  of  uncertainty  surrounding  business \nconditions  and  capital  constraint.  Especially  when  there  is  information  asymmetry \nbetween borrowing firms and creditors, firms with a large growth opportunity or a large \nexternal  funding  risk  tend  to  maintain  more  liquid  assets  rather  than  using  uncertain \nexternal  funding  (Myers  and  Majluf  1984).  For  firms,  a  lower  interest  rate  promotes \ngreater  cash  demand  due  to  a  decline  in  the  opportunity  cost.  Nonetheless,  cash \nholdings are likely to be dominated by households, not by firms, because households \noften  keep  cash  in  safety  boxes  due  to  smaller  amounts  of  cash  holdings  while  firms \noften keep money in the form of cash equivalents (i.e., bank deposits) rather than in the \nform  of  cash  itself  for  security  reasons  (unless  for  illegal  or  informal  activities).  For \nexample, in the case of Japan, where the data on cash holdings by types of holders are \navailable from the flow of funds data, households\u2019 cash holdings as of the end of 2018 \naccounted for 80% of total outstanding cash issued, growing steadily from 53% in 2000. \nIn contrast, the ratio of non-financial firms\u2019 holdings dropped from 37.5% to 8.6% over \nthe period. Due to a lack of such detailed data decomposed by types of holders for other \neconomies, this paper examines total cash in circulation without distinguishing between \nhouseholds and firms. \n\nThe Case of the 11 Advanced Economies \n\nFigure 1(1) shows the amount of cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP and Figure \n1(2)  shows  cash  in  circulation  in  terms  of  the  index  (by  setting  the  amount  in  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nthe  first  quarter  of  2002  being  equal  to  100)  for  the  period  2000\u20132018  regarding  the  \n11 advanced economies. Charts in Appendix Figure 1 show the development of these \ntwo indicators for each economy. These figures indicate that the 11 economies can be \nclassified into the following three types of economies with regards to the trend related to \ncash-nominal GDP ratio: (1) economies with a rising trend, (2) economies roughly with a \nstable or constant trend, and (3) economies with a declining trend. The economies with \na rising trend include the Euro Area, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United \nKingdom,  and  the  United  States.  The  rising  trend  strengthened  in  these  economies \nespecially  after  economic  uncertainty  rose  as  a  result  of  the  global  financial  crisis  of \n2008\u20132009.  Greater  political/economic/financial  uncertainty  tends  to  increase  the \nprecautionary  demand  for  cash,  reflecting  diminished  trust  in  the  banking  system.  By \ncontrast,  the  economies  with  a  declining  trend  in  the  cash-nominal  GDP  ratio  include \nDenmark,  Norway,  and  Sweden,  which  all  have  a  well-developed  cashless  and \ncontactless payment system. The economies with a more or less stable trend include \nAustralia  and  Canada.  Regarding  the  amount  of  cash  in  circulation,  all  the  advanced \neconomies except Sweden and Norway experienced a rising trend, reflecting transaction \nmotive of cash demand. The amount of cash in circulation has grown fast in the Euro \nArea  since  the  early  2000s,  details  of  which  will  be  discussed  later.  Since  the  global \nfinancial crisis, the Republic of Korea showed a faster growth in the amount of cash in \ncirculation.  In  sharp  contrast,  a  declining  trend  began  in  Sweden  from  2009  and  in \nNorway recently from 2017.  \n\nFigure 1(1): Cash in Circulation (% of Nominal GDP) in the Advanced Economies  \n\nSource: CEIC, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 1(2): Amount of Cash in Circulation in the Advanced Economies  \n(2002 Q1=100) \n\nSource: CEIC, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England. \n\n \n\nAmong the advanced economies, it is noted that Japan\u2019s cash-nominal GDP ratio has \nalways exceeded other economies by a wide margin and has even increased to around \n20%  recently,  further  widening  the  gap.  Japan\u2019s  high  cash  demand  may  reflect  that \ncultural  habits  such  as  high  levels  of  public  trust  in  the  stable  government  and  legal \ntender in the face of persistently-low inflation (even though low inflation means that the \nBank of Japan\u2019s policy to raise inflation to achieve the 2% price stability target is failing). \nIn addition, a limited number of crimes associated with cash handlings and counterfeiting \nin Japan make it secure for the general public and particularly the elderly to depend on \ncash.  Unwillingness  to  accept  credit  cards,  debit  cards,  or  other  cashless  payment \ninstruments  by  some  small  retail  stores  and  taxi  drivers\u2014because  of  high  installation \ncost  and/or  card  processing  fees\u2014also  discourage  the  public  from  shifting  to  a  fully \ncashless-based  economy.  In  addition,  Japan\u2019s  long-standing  mild  deflation  or  low \ninflation  reduced  the  frequency  of  retail  price  changes  so  that  the  public  find  it \nconformable to use cash. In addition, a series of monetary easing measures conducted \nby the Bank of Japan since the collapse of bubble in stock and real estate prices in the \nearly 1990s reduced interest rates and lowered the opportunity cost of holding cash. The \nBank  of  Japan  has  performed  a  series  of  unconventional  monetary  easing  measures \nsince the late 1990s, which have exerted downward pressures on short- and long-term \ninterest rates\u2014ranging from the zero interest rate policy in 1999\u20132000, to Quantitative \nEasing in 2001\u20132006, and further to Comprehensive Monetary Easing from 2010, which \nwas  then  replaced  in  April  2013  by  the  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Monetary  Easing \nunder the New Governorship led by Haruhiko Kuroda (see Shirai 2018 for details).  In \naddition, the intensified demand for cash in recent years might be driven by tax-saving \nincentives  motivated  as  a  result  of  various  government  tax-raising  measures.  For \nexample, the government introduced the \u201cMy Number\u201d system in 2015, providing all the \nresidents with an individual identification number, which can be used for social security, \ntax  payments,  renumerations,  financial  investment,  and  other  government  records. \nMoreover, the government adopted several tax-revenue raising measures\u2014including (a) \nan inheritance tax hike in January 2015 (by reducing the amount of exemption threshold); \n(b)  an  adoption  of  a  compulsory  reporting  system  requiring  residents  to  submit \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\ninformation on detailed foreign assets to the National Tax Authority in 2014 if exceeding \n50 million yen; and (c) an adoption of a compulsory reporting system requiring individuals \nto submit detailed information about domestic financial/non-financial assets and debts to \nthe National Tax Authority in 2016. The growth rate of cash in circulation has declined \nrecently partly due to the higher penetration of cashless payment instruments, although \nthe cash growth rates have remained above the rates of nominal GDP growth. \n\nIn the case of the Euro Area, the circulation of euro banknotes (and coins) began at the \nend of 2001 and those euro banknotes (and coins) became legal tender in 2002. Demand \nfor euro banknotes appears to have increased gradually as the public gained confidence \nover \nthe  common  currency  euro  as  well  as  monetary  policy  conducted  \nby the European Central Bank (ECB), as evidenced by the steady increase in the amount \nof euro in circulation. ECB conducted monetary easing after the global financial crisis \nand  a  series  of  innovative  unconventional  monetary  easing  especially  from  2014\u2014\nincluding  negative  interest  rate  policy,  Targeted  Long-term  Refinancing  operations \n(TLTRO  I  and  II),  and  large-scale  asset  purchase  program.  The  resultant  declining \ninterest rates made cash holding more attractive than before. ECB terminated the asset \npurchase  program  at  the  end  of  December  2018,  announced  a  continuation  of  the \nreinvestment  strategy  to  maintain  the  outstanding  amount  of  asset  holdings,  and \npresented a plan to conduct the first hike on policy rates within 2019. However, economic \nslowdown  in  the  region  and  declines  in  the  rates  of  inflation  and  inflation  expectation \nforced to the ECB to shift its monetary policy stance from a move toward normalization \nto a move toward accommodation since early 2019. ECB, thus, postponed the planned \ndecision  \nto \ntiming \nto  adopt  the  new  TLTRO  III  in  March  2019  with  the  effect  from  September  2019. \nFurthermore,  ECB  began \nfurther  monetary \naccommodation in the near-term to the market participants from June 2019\u2014in one of \nthe  forthcoming  Governing  Council  meetings  by  deepening  the  negative  interest  rate \nfrom the current minus 0.4% together with an adoption of the tiering system to mitigate \nadverse  impacts  on  the  banking  system.  Possible  resumption  of  the  asset  purchase \nprogram has also been hinted. These series of enhanced monetary easing measures \nmay promote further demand for cash.  \n\nits  willingness \n\nand  made \n\nto  signal \n\nto  add \n\npolicy \n\n2020 \n\nrates \n\nraise \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nto  a \n\nthree  working  days \n\nThe United Kingdom has also faced a moderate increase in the ratio of cash to nominal \nGDP  ratio  even  though  the  economy  is  more  advanced  in  terms  of  new  cashless, \ncontactless  retail  payment  systems  compared  with  other  advanced  economies.  The \neconomy had already adopted a retail Faster Payments Scheme in 2008 as a banking \nsector initiative to accelerate payment times between different banks\u2019 customer accounts \nfrom \nfew  seconds.  The  scheme  now  offers  a  \nreal-time  payment  service  for  the  public  24  hours  a  day.  Contactless  cards  and \ninstantaneous  payments  thus  became  available  from  around  this  time.  Nevertheless, \ncash  in  circulation  continues  to  grow  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  low  interest  rate \nenvironment  generated  by  the  Bank  of  England  and  indirectly  affected  by  monetary \neasing of other major central banks appear to have contributed to greater cash demand. \nThe first quantitative easing was announced in late 2009, expanded further in 2012, and \nresumed  in  August  2016  for  a  short  while  after  the  surprise  23  June  2016  Brexit \nreferendum  result.  Simultaneously,  the  Bank  of  England,  after  having  maintained  the \npolicy rate at 0.5% from 2008, decided to lower it to 0.25% in August 2016 to cope with \nexpected economic slowdown. However, economic performance turned out better than \nexpected and the United States was making progress with regards to monetary policy \nnormalization so that the Bank of England began to normalize monetary policy by raising \nthe policy rate to 0.5% in 2017 and further to 0.75% in 2018. Since early 2019, the greater \nconcerns related to Brexit and uncertainty related to internal politics have undermined \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nthe  British  economy  and  households\u2019  and  firms\u2019  sentiments.  This  may  increase \nprecautionary demand for cash. \n\n(rose \n\n(rose \n\ntimes \n\nfrom  21% \n\nto  0.25\u20130.5% \n\nfrom  0\u20130.25% \n\nin  2017  and  18% \n\nin  2016)  and  28% \n\nin  December  2015 \n\nIn the case of the United States, meanwhile, it is interesting to find that the cash-nominal \nGDP ratio continued to rise even after the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds \nrate  nine \nto  \n2.25\u20132.5%  in  December  2018  in  the  process  of  monetary  policy  normalization.  This \nhappened  even  though  households  are  using  cash  less  frequently  than  the  past. \nAccording  to  the  2017  Diary  of  Consumer  Payment  Choice  by  the  Federal  Reserve, \nKumar and O\u2019Brien (2019) found that individuals used cash in 26% of transactions (down \nfrom 30% in 2017 and 31% in 2016), while credit cards and debit cards accounted for \nfrom  \n23% \n26%  in  2017  and  27%  in  2018),  respectively.  Prepaid  and  electronic  instruments \nremained  unpopular,  accounting  for  only  2%\u20133%  and  10%\u201311%  over  the  same  \nperiod,  respectively.  Cash  was  used  heavily  for  small-value  payments  (under  $10) \nrepresenting about 50% of payments\u2014large-value payments representing only 10% for \n$50\u201399.99  and  6%  for  $100  and  above.  Surprisingly,  the  share  of  cash  use  among \nindividuals under 25 years old was the highest (33%) of any age group, slightly higher \nthan  those  aged  55  years  old  and  above.  Since  early  2019,  meanwhile,  the  Federal \nReserve  shifted  the  monetary  policy  stance  from  normalization  of  monetary  policy  to  \nan  accommodative  one.  First,  in  early  2019  the  Federal  Reserve  abruptly  stopped  \nthe  interest  rate  normalization  process  (which  had  lasted  from  December  2015  to \nDecember 2018) by stressing muted inflation, declining long-term inflation expectations, \nand  downside  risks  related  to  domestic  economic  growth  outlook  in  the  face  of \nuncertainties such as US\u2013PRC trade disputes and Brexit. The United States President \nDonald Trump has begun to criticize the Federal Reserve since summer 2018 for having \nmade  mistakes  in  2018  by  raising  the  federal  funds  rate  and  conducting  the  balance \nsheet  run-off  (so-called  \u201cquantitative  tightening\u201d).  Second,  the  Federal  Reserve \nadvanced  the  timing  to  end  the  balance  sheet  run-off  (so-called  \u201cbalance  sheet \ntightening\u201d) from the end of 2019 to the end of September 2019 in March 2019. It was \nfurther advanced to the end of July 2019\u2014when the decision was made to cut the federal \nfunds  rate  by  25  basis  points  from  2.25%\u20132.5%  to  2%\u20132.25%  for  the  first  time  since \n2008. Thus, the Federal Reserve stopped shrinking the size the balance sheet earlier \nthan  originally  scheduled.  President  Trump  intensified  criticism  against  the  Federal \nReserve even after the 25-basis-point policy rate cut at the end of July 2019 because the \ncut was only 25 basis points rather than the 50 basis points and demanded further cuts \nof about 100 basis point cuts in the near future. Market participants also expect further \nseveral  cuts  in  the  federal  funds  rate  within  a  year  because  of  the  concerns  over  the \ninverse  yield  curves  (the  shorter-term  yields  such  as  the  3-month  or  the  2-year  being \nhigher than longer-term yields such as the 10-year), expected economic slowdown in the \nUnited States, and uncertainty related to the global economy. It is important to monitor \nwhether  such  cuts  in  the  policy  rate  will  promote  greater  demand  for  cash  in  this \neconomy. \n\nIn sharp contrast to Japan, the Euro Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States, \nSweden exhibits a completely different pattern. Sweden progressed to become the most-\nadvanced cashless society among the 11 advanced economies examined because of \nthe declining trend concerning the cash-nominal GDP ratio and the amount of cash in \ncirculation. Credit cards and a mobile-phone-based fast payment system called Swish \nhave been widely available for some time. The pace of decline in the cash-nominal GDP \nratio accelerated since 2008, which is contrary to the movements observed among other \nSwedish  \nadvanced \ncash-nominal GDP ratio continued to drop even after a negative interest rate policy was \nadopted  on  the  repo  rate  in  February  2015  and  was  deepened  gradually  toward  \n\neconomies. \n\nshould \n\nnoted \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nbe \n\nIt \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\n\u20130.5%  by  February  2016  and  maintained  the  same  rate  until  the  rate  was  raised  to  \n\u20130.25% in January 2019 as part of monetary policy normalization. This indicates that a \nnegative interest rate policy did not promote substitution from bank deposits to cash.  \n\nThe Case of the 11 Emerging/Developing Economies \n\nThe cash-nominal GDP ratios and the amount of cash in circulation in the case of the 11 \nemerging  economies/developing  economies  are  shown  in  Figure  2(1)  and  2(2), \nrespectively.  Charts  in  Appendix  Figure  2  show  developments  with  regards  to  the  \ntwo indicators for each economy. While all the 11 economies recorded roughly a secular \nrising  trend  from  early  2000s  concerning  the  number  of  banknotes  in  circulation, \ndivergent  movements  were  observed  with  regards  to  the  ratio  of  cash-nominal  GDP \nratios.  The  economies  with  a  rising  cash-nominal  GDP  ratio  include  the  Republic  of \nKorea, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, and Thailand. Their rising trend prevailed from \nearly 2000s. The economies with the declining cash-nominal GDP ratio include the PRC \nfrom early 2000s and Turkey since 2017. India experienced a sharp drop in the amount \nand  the  ratio  in  October\u2013November  2016  due  to  the  impact  of  the  demonetization \ncurrency reform as mentioned below. Finally, the economies with the more or less stable \ncash-nominal GDP ratio include Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Russian Federation.  \n\nIn  particular,  a  secular  declining  trend  in  the  cash-nominal  GDP  ratio  in  the  PRC  is \nnoticeable. This is likely to reflect a shift in the form of money held by the public from \ncash to bank deposits and/or other cashless payment tools (such as Alipay or WeChat \nPay).  This  is  in  line  with  the  deepening  of  the  banking  system  and  an  increase  in  \nthe  number  of  depositors  with  commercial  banks.  Meanwhile,  India\u2019s  cash\u2013GDP  ratio \nremained stable until the fourth quarter of 2016, suggesting that India\u2019s cash growth is \nassociated more or less in line with transaction demand growth. A sharp drop in the ratio \nin  India  happened  temporarily  in  2016  after  the  government  abruptly  implemented  a \ncurrency reform that triggered a temporary shortage of banknotes in circulation. India\u2019s \ngovernment  banned  the  Rs100  and  Rs500  banknotes  and  instead  introduced  a  new \nRs500 note for the first time and issued new Rs2,000 banknotes. This currency reform \nwas meant to fight corruption and anti-money laundering/illegal activities, but it created \nsevere disruptions to economic activities as a result of creating serious cash shortages. \nWhile the cash ratio recovered somewhat in the following year, it appears that the ratio \nhas  been  lower  than  the  past  trend,  suggesting  a  moderate  shift  from  cash  to  bank \ndeposits or cashless payment tools. \n\nMany  emerging/developing  economies  have  increasingly  reduced  cash  usage  for \npayments of goods and services and other transactions in recent years. This is because \npayment systems are currently experiencing rapid innovation and transformation with the \nincreasing number of technology companies and financial institutions being involved as \npayment providers. Many governments also encourage the use of electronic payment \ninstruments to improve efficiency in the payment systems. Nevertheless, cash demand \nremained strong in many economies with the exception of the PRC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 2(1): Cash (% of Nominal GDP) in the Emerging/Developing Economies \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\nFigure 2(2): Amount of Cash in Circulation in the Emerging/Developing \nEconomies (2002 Q1=100) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\n2.2  Outstanding Banknotes Issued Differentiated  \nby Denomination in Selected Economies \n\nfinancial \n\nthe  solvency  of \n\nSection 2.2. also investigates the movements of cash demand further by focusing on the \nnumber  of  outstanding  banknotes  issued  by  size  of  denomination.  Demand  for  high-\ndenomination  banknotes  is  likely  to  be  associated  more  with  cash  hoarding.  \nSuch demand may have become more important during the times of the global financial \ncrisis,  since  concerns  about \ninstitutions  might  \nhave  prompted  depositors  to  withdraw  their  funds  from  commercial  banks  or  other \nequivalent money  market  funds  to  increase  their  precautionary  holdings  of  banknotes \n(Cusbert and Rohling 2013). Demand for high-denomination banknotes of international \nreserve  currency  might  be  increased  by  the  increased  number  of  foreign  tourists, \nbusinesspersons,  and  students  who  frequently  visit  the  economy  under  investigation. \nHigh-denomination banknotes are also preferred by the people who wish to materialize \nflight  to  safety  investment.  Demand  for  higher-denomination  banknotes  could  be \nassociated more negatively with changes in interest rates (Arango-Arango and Suarez-\nAriza 2019). Regarding payment tools, non-cash payment tools such as credit cards are \nmore  frequently  used  for  high-value  purchases  such  as  home  electronics,  furniture, \nexpensive clothes, etc. On the other hand, low-denomination banknotes are more often \nused  for  lower-value  purchases  such  as  food  and  beverages.  The  expansion  of  ATM \nnetworks  may  increase  demand  for  lower-denomination  banknotes  because  of  the \nincreased frequency of trips to withdraw small numbers of banknotes. \n\nEconomies with Greater Demand for Highest-Denomination Banknotes \n\nThe  consistent  time-series  data  on  the  number  of  outstanding  banknotes  issued \nclassified by denomination are available for seven economies\u2014Canada, the Euro Area, \nJapan, the Republic of Korea, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Figure \n3  exhibits  the  annual  time-series  developments  of  outstanding  banknotes  issued \ndifferentiated  by  denomination  for  these  economies  for  the  period  2000\u20132018.  These \nseven economies can be classified into two groups: the first group with dominant largest-\ndenomination banknotes (Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States) and the \nother  group  with  dominant  middle-denomination  banknotes  (Canada,  the  Euro  Area, \nPoland, and the United Kingdom).  \n\nRegarding the first group, the outstanding issuance amount of the largest 10,000-yen \nnote has always been largest over the observation period in Japan. In addition, the pace \nof  issuance  increased  further  since  2013  when  the  Bank  of  Japan  adopted  the \nQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing. Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea began \nto circulate the 50,000 won in June 2009 as the largest-denomination banknote and since \nthen the outstanding amount issued rose rapidly. The United States experienced a rapid \nrise  in  the  issuance  outstanding  amount  concerning  the  $100  note  since  the  global \nfinancial crisis. In both the Republic of Korea and the United States, the amounts of the \nlargest-denomination  banknotes  exceeded  those  of  smaller-denomination  banknotes \nrecently.  Consequently,  the  figures  related  to  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the \nUnited States indicate the presence of high and rising demand for cash holdings since \nlarge-denomination banknotes are best suited for this purpose.  \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 3(1): Banknotes Issued by Denomination in Canada  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\nFigure 3(2): Banknotes Issued by Denomination in the Euro Area  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 3(3): Banknotes Issued by Denomination in Japan  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\nFigure 3(4): Banknotes Issued in the Republic of Korea by Denomination  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 3(5): Banknotes Issued by Denomination in Poland  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\nFigure 3(6): Banknotes Issued by Denomination in the United Kingdom  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nFigure 3(7): Banknotes Issued in the United States by Denomination  \n(Unit: Billions) \n\nSource: CEIC. \n\n \n\nIn the case of Japan, the dominant issuance amount of the 10,000-yen note could be \nattributed  to  the  increase  in  cash  hoarding  driven  by  downward  pressures  in  interest \nrates (and low rate of inflation even after massive monetary easing) as well as intensified \ntax-saving motives mentioned earlier. Otani and Suzuki (2008) estimated cash hoarding \nby choosing 1995 as the base year, assuming that transaction motive was present, but \nno cash hoarding was present, thus regarding the difference between the total 10,000-\nyen banknotes in circulation and that of the base year as the estimated amount of cash \nhoarding. Fujiki and Nakashima (2019) assumed that cash hording took place only in the \nform of the 10,000-yen banknote and thus estimated cash hoarding from the difference \nbetween all the units of 10,000-yen issued and the estimated transaction motive proxied \nby the movement of the 1,000-yen banknote (major note used in daily transactions). The \npaper  concluded  that  about  40%  of  banknotes  in  circulation  were  attributed  to  cash \nhoardings, provided that the hoarding of 10,000-yen banknotes began in 1995.  \n\nthat  of \n\nthe  US$20  note  and  all  other  denominates  except \n\nRegarding  the  United  States,  the  rapidly  rising  trend  of  the  US$100-note  issuance \nespecially after the global financial crisis is noted. The amount of the US$100 note issue \nexceeded \nthe  \nUS$1  note  (the  most  frequently  used  note  in  daily  transactions)  in  2009  and  finally \nexceeded even the amount of the $1 note in 2017. There has been no sign of reversal \nof  these  trends.  According  to  the  aforementioned  2017  Diary  of  Consumer  Payment \nChoice (DCPC) conducted by the Federal Reserve, Greene and Stavins (2018) found \nthat the average value of a cash transaction was only $23, compared with $109 for the \naverage non-cash transaction (and $83 for all transactions). From the same database, \nKumar and O\u2019Brien (2019) pointed out that cash represented 55% of transactions under \n$10. This suggests that consumers evaluated cash highly for being low cost and easy to \nuse. Cash is also an important payment option for low-income households because of \nthe  difficulty  to  obtain  credit  cards  or  the  high  annual  charges  associated  with  credit \ncards. The paper found that households that earned less than $25,000 a year used cash \nfor 43% of their payments.  \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nSeveral studies pointed out that the rising trend of US$100 issuance is attributable not \nto only domestic demand but also to foreign demand, which regards the US dollar as a \nsafe  haven  currency,  especially  from  emerging/developing  economies  with  unstable \nfinancial systems and weak macroeconomic fundamentals (Haasl, Schulhofer-Wohl, and \nPaulson 2018; Judson 2017). High demand for the banknotes from abroad is unique to \nthe case of the US dollar, given the dominant status of the US dollar in various cross-\nborder  trade,  financial,  and  other  transactions.  Foreign  holdings  of  the  US  dollar \nbanknotes take place through immigrants or tourists\u2019 or other cash flows especially from \nthe  United  States  to  Mexico,  as  well  as  other  commercial  banking  and  non-banking \ncross-border cash transfer channels. Judson (2017) found that foreign demand for the \nUS  dollar  has  increased  from  the  1990s  to  early  2000s\u2014a  period  that  coincided  with \nexternal uncertainties (such as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nand  several  economic  and  political  crises  in  Latin  America).  After  such  demand \nstabilized,  the  global  financial  crisis  has  given  rise  to  renewed  demand  for  US  dollar \nbanknotes and rising demand continues until the present. Judson (2017) also estimated \nthat such foreign demand has accounted for more than 60% of all US dollar banknotes \nand nearly 80% of $100 banknotes.  \n\nEconomies with Greater Demand for Middle-Value Banknotes \n\nAs  for  the  second  group,  the  outstanding  amount  issued  over  medium-denomination \nbanknotes  have  dominated  that  of  other  larger-denomination  and  small-denomination \nbanknotes. This is because the public use cash only for lower-value transactions and \nuse  credit  cards  or  other  cashless  payment  tools  for  higher-value  transactions.  For \nexample, Canada has used the 20 Canadian dollar banknotes dominantly over the period \nand the gap between it and the largest-denomination (100 Canadian dollar) banknotes \nhas remained large. The Euro Area was dominated by the \u20ac50 banknote, followed by the \nthe  \n\u20ac20 \n\u20ac500 banknote, the \u20ac200 banknote, and the \u20ac100 banknote remained small. In Poland, \nthe  value  of  outstanding  issued  100  Poland  zloty  banknote  has  been  dominant  and  \nhas widened the gap with that of the 500 and the 200 Poland zloty banknotes. In the \nUnited Kingdom, the outstanding amount issued on the \u00a3100 banknote has remained \ndominant and the gaps with the larger-denomination \u00a3500 banknote and \u00a3200 banknote \nhave expanded over time.  \n\noutstanding \n\nbanknote \n\namounts \n\nissued \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nso \n\nof \n\nfor  daily \n\ntransactions  and  did  not \n\nIn the case of the Euro Area, the outstanding amount issued on the \u20ac500 note issued \nwas never large as compared to other smaller-denomination banknotes such as the \u20ac50 \nand the \u20ac20 banknotes despite the adoption of various unconventional monetary easing \ntools  including  the  large-scale  asset  purchase  program  and  the  negative  interest  rate \npolicy. This could be related to the fact that the residents in the Euro Area maintained \nsmaller-denomination  banknotes \nincrease \nprecautionary demand for cash. The ECB conducted a survey in 2016 to analyze the use \nof cash, cards, and other payment instruments used at points of sale (POS) by Euro Area \nhouseholds  (Esselink  and  Hern\u00e1ndez  2017).  The  survey  results  indicated  that  nearly \ntwo-thirds \nMoreover,  \ntwo-thirds of all transactions took place in shops for purchases of day-to-day items, as \nwell as in restaurants, bars, and caf\u00e9s. On the other hand, only 8% of all transactions \nwere  above  \u20ac50,  and  only  14%  were  made  in  shops  for  durable  goods  or  in  petrol \nstations.  The  report  stated  that  access  to  payment  cards  could  not  be  a  major  factor  \nin  explaining  the  payment  behavior  due  to  there  being  high  access  on  average  in  \nthe  region;  nevertheless,  a  negative  relationship  appeared  to  exist  between  card \nacceptance  and  cash  usage.

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON CASH DEMAND IN THE \nEURO AREA, JAPAN, AND THE UNITED STATES \n\nThis  section  focuses  on  the  cash  demand  function  of  the  three  largest  advanced \neconomies in the world\u2014the Euro Area, Japan, and the United States\u2014which adopted \nmassive unconventional monetary easing after the global financial crisis that contributed \nto  the  global  low  interest  rate  environment.  Cash  tends  to  rise  as  economic  activities \n(proxied  by  nominal  GDP)  grow,  mainly  reflecting  transaction  motive.  Therefore,  this \npaper uses cash in circulation as a share of nominal GDP as a dependent variable in \norder to examine the trend, excluding the direct impact coming from greater economic \nactivities. In other words, the paper focuses on cash demand that cannot be explained \nby  the  transaction  motive\u2014such  as  opportunity  cost,  precautionary  motive,  and  other \nmotives in the three economies. One of the precautionary motives on which this paper \nwill focus is the presence of uncertainty, which is often enhanced by the economic and \nfinancial crisis and resultant turbulence in the financial and capital markets, such as the \ncase of early 2000s dotcom crash and the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132009. Other \nmotives this paper will highlight is aging, which might exert the positive contribution to \ncash \nelderly  \nmay prefer using familiar cash payment tools, have limited access to new credit cards \ndue  to  their  retirement  status,  or  find  it  difficult  to  learn  new  digital  instruments.  \nThe relative use of cash is expected to decrease eventually and over time due to the \neffect  of  generation  replacement;  however,  it  will  take  some  time  to  see  this  effect  \nin  many  economies.  Based  on  Spain\u2019s  microdata,  for  example,  Alonso  et  al.  (2018) \ndemonstrated that the age was a clear determinant in the use of cards as a payment \nmethod compared to cash. Namely, the population aged 60 years old and above used \n33% more cash than the overall average (in terms of the value of transactions) while the \npopulation aged below 30 years old used 44% less cash than the overall average. \n\nbecause \n\ndemand \n\nthe \n\nThis section will estimate the following time-series equation that shows the relationship \nbetween cash demand and their potential determinants: \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 =  \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc +   \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd1 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd2 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd3 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 +   \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \n\nwhere  CASH  refers  to  cash  in  circulation  as  a  ratio  of  nominal  GDP  as  already \nmentioned.  This  paper  uses  i  for  country  index,  while  index  t  refers  to  time  period \n(quarterly).  The  constant  term  \u03b1  reflects  a  country\u2019s  specific  features  that  prevailed \npersistently such as the cultural factors, prevalence of trust, frequency of cash-related \ncrimes, payment habits, and public safety, all of which influence an economy\u2019s level of \nthe cash-nominal GDP ratio.

The  \n10-year  yield  (10-YEAR)  is  used  interchangeably  because  some  central  banks  \nfaced the zero lower bound or effective lower bound after having lowered the policy rates \nand  thus  pay  more  attention  to  the  longer-term  yields  to  generate  monetary \naccommodation. The signs of INTEREST and 10-YEAR parameters are expected to be \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nnegative. The precautionary motive is represented by CRISIS, which is a dummy variable \nto capture macroeconomic turbulences. The variable is set equal to one during the IT \nbubble burst in early 2000 (from the second quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2001) \nand  the  global  financial  crisis  (from  the  second  quarter  of  2007  to  the  first  quarter  of \n2009), and zero otherwise. This study attempted to use an alternative variable for the \nprecautionary motive, which is the volatility index of stock markets (VOLAT)\u2014namely, \nVIX  (the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  Volatility  Index  which  measures  the  stock \nmarket\u2019s expectation of volatility implied by S&P500 index options for the United States), \nsimilar Euro Stoxx 50 volatility index for the Euro Area, and similar Nikkei-255 volatility \nindex  for  Japan.  Regarding  other  motives,  this  paper  uses  AGE  as  the  age-related \nvariable which is proxied by the ratio of population aged equal or greater than 65 years \nold. Life expectancy (LIFE) was used interchangeably with AGE. The logarithmic form is \nused for LIFE to enable measuring the impact of its change on the dependent variable \nin a percentage term. The signs of AGE and log (LIFE) parameters are expected to be \npositive.  \n\nBesides  examining  equation  (1),  this  section  also  examines  the  impact  of  country-\nspecific variables on cash in circulation: nominal effective exchange rate for the case of \nthe United States (NEER_US), and negative deposit interest rates in the case of Euro \nArea and Japan (proxied by dummy variable called NEG_INT).  \n\nNEER_US  variable  is  used  as  a  proxy  for  measuring  demand  for  the  US  dollar  from \nabroad which may rise from emerging/developing economies during a crisis or period of \neconomic turbulence or amplified global uncertainty, as already pointed out in Section 2. \nAn increase in NEER_US means an appreciation of the US dollar against major trade \npartners. Demand for the US dollar from abroad may rise especially when the US dollar \nis stronger, since a strength of the US dollar is often associated with a decline in risk \nappetite among global investors driven by greater global economic uncertainty. The sign \nof the NEER_US parameter is expected to be positive.  \n\nin \n\nthe \n\n-0.1% \n\nrate  gradually \n\nJune  2014  and  deepened \n\nWith respect to NEG_INT for the case of Euro Area and Japan, the value of the NEG_INT \nis set to one for period when the deposit interest rate in the respective country is negative, \nand  zero  otherwise  The  ECB  announced  a  negative  rate  on  the  deposit  facility  rate \nat \ntoward  \n\u20130.4%  by  March  2016.  After  having  been  preparing  and  announcing  for  a  first-rate  \nhike  (scheduled  around  the  fall  of  2019)  from  2018,  the  ECB  changed  the  stance  \nof  monetary  policy  in  2019  due  to  concerns  over  low  inflation  and  low  inflation \nexpectations.  ECB  adopted  a  package  of  monetary  easing  in  September  2019  by \ndeepening the deposit facility rate further to \u20130.5% together with a restart of the asset \npurchase  program  with  effect  from  November  2019.  Meanwhile  the  Bank  of  Japan \nannounced  an  adoption  of  a  negative  interest  rate  of  \u20130.1%  on  a  small  portion  of  \ntheir  excess  reserves  with  the  Bank  in  January  2016.  The  negative  interest  rate  on \nexcess  reserves  is  expected  to  increase  cash  in  circulation,  as  households  may  be \nencouraged to hold cash rather than placing their money in banks. Therefore, the sign \nof NEG_INT parameter is expected to be positive.  \n\nTable 1 shows the regression results of the time-series final estimation models. Model \n(1)  pairs  the  INTEREST  and  AGE  variables,  while  Model  (2)  pairs  INTEREST  and  \nlog (LIFE). Models (3) and (4) are for the Euro Area only, where the former pairs the 10-\nYEAR and AGE while the latter pairs the 10-YEAR and log (LIFE). Model (5) is prepared \nspecifically for the United States where it pairs INTEREST, AGE, and NEER variables. \nThe paper added the autoregression term AR (1) in all the estimation models due to the \npresence of autocorrelation problem. Table 1 does not display the results of models that \ninclude 10-YEAR for Japan and the United States, CRISIS, VOLAT, and NEG_INT, as \nthese variables were not statistically significant.  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fModel (1) \n\nEuro Area \n\nJapan \n\nUnited States \n\nModel (2) \n\n \n\n \n\nJapan \n(without \nconstant) \n\nUnited \nStates \n\nModel (3) \n\nEuro Area \n(with \nconstant) \n\nEuro Area \n(without \nconstant) \n\nModel (4) \n\n \n\n \n\nModel (5) \n\nADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nTable 1: Regression Results  \n(Prob t-statistics in bracket) \n\nINTEREST \n(%) \n\nAGE  \n(%) \n\nConstant \n\n\u20136.2114** \n(0.0890) \n\n9.1323* \n(0.0092) \n\n\u20132.7772* \n(0.0000) \n\n\u20130.3166* \n(0.0000) \n\n\u20131.2409* \n(lag 1) \n(0.0015) \n\n\u20130.0781* \n(0.0004) \n\n0.7496* \n(0.0002) \n\n0.3272* \n(0.0017) \n\nAR (1) \n\n0.9947* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.9927* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.6822* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.6497* \n(0.0000) \n\nR2 \n0.9948 \n\nAdjusted \nR2 \n0.9945 \n\nProb \n(F-stats.) \n\nDurbin-\nWatson \nStats. \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.8771 \n\n0.9851 \n\n0.9842 \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.8037 \n\n0.9840 \n\n0.9830 \n\n0.0000* \n\n2.1380 \n\nEuro Area \n\nConstant \n\n\u2013143.0819* \n(0.0000) \n\nJapan (with \nconstant) \n\n22.6300 \n(0.8269) \n\nINTEREST \n(%) \n\nLog \n(LIFE) \n\n34.4662* \n(0.0071) \n\n\u20131.4852 \n(0.9498) \n\nAR (1) \n\n0.9968* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.9973* \n(0.0000) \n\n3.6344* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.9971* \n(0.0000) \n\n\u20130.3136* \n(0.0000) \n\n\u20131.4198* \n(lag 1) \n(0.0001) \n\n\u20131.4008* \n(lag 1) \n(0.0001) \n\n\u20130.0709 \n(0.2160) \n\n\u2013 \n\n0.9817 \n\n0.9809 \n\n\u2013 \n\n1.5629 \n\n\u2013201.6661* \n(0.0029) \n\n47.7892* \n(0.0021) \n\n0.9655* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.9612 \n\n0.9589 \n\n0.0000* \n\n2.3138 \n\nR2 \n0.9936 \n\nAdjusted \nR2 \n0.9932 \n\nProb \n(F-stats.) \n\nDurbin-\nWatson \nStats. \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.8050 \n\n0.9818 \n\n0.9807 \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.5407 \n\nConstant \n\n\u20135.4670 \n(0.2037) \n\n10-YEAR \n(%) \n\n\u20130.1607* \n(0.0011) \n\nAGE  \n(%) \n\n0.7063* \n(0.0018) \n\nAR (1) \n\n0.9946* \n(0.0000) \n\nR2 \n0.9933 \n\nAdjusted \nR2 \n0.9929 \n\nProb \n(F-stats.) \n\nDurbin-\nWatson \nStats. \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.8044 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u20130.1659* \n(0.0005) \n\n0.5642* \n(0.0060) \n\n0.9989* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.9933 \n\n0.9929 \n\n\u2013 \n\n1.8216 \n\nEuro Area \n\nConstant \n\n\u201327.4449* \n(0.0123) \n\n10-YEAR \n(%) \n\n\u20130.1992* \n(0.0003) \n\nLog \n(LIFE) \n\n0.4433* \n(0.0015) \n\nAR (1) \n\n0.9963* \n(0.0000) \n\nR2 \n0.9925 \n\nAdjusted \nR2 \n0.9920 \n\nProb \n(F-stats.) \n\nDurbin-\nWatson \nStats. \n\n0.0000* \n\n1.6878 \n\n \n\nUnited \nStates \n\nConstant \n\n\u20133.1531* \n(0.0000) \n\nINTEREST \n(%) \n\nAGE  \n(%) \n\nNEER \n\nAR (1) \n\n\u20130.0874* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.6651* \n(0.0000) \n\n0.0056* \n(0.0334) \n\n0.6090* \n(0.0000) \n\n* = significant at 5% significance level; ** = significant at 10% significance level. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\nR2 \n0.9847 \n\nAdjusted \nR2 \n0.9836 \n\nProb \n(F-stats.) \n\nDurbin-\nWatson \nStats. \n\n0.0000* \n\n2.1318 \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nRegarding  the  opportunity  cost,  INTEREST  was  statistically  significant  for  the  three \neconomies in most of the estimation models adopted in this paper. In the case of Japan, \none-period lag for INTEREST was used as it showed statistical significance only when \nusing the lag. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield was statistically significant for the Euro Area, \nbut not statistically significant in the case of Japan and the United States. This may imply \nthat the central bank policy rate is affecting cash demand in the three economies mainly \nthrough shorter-term interest rates rather than longer-term interest rates often set based \non the benchmark government bond yields.  \n\nAs for the precautionary motive, CRISIS and VOLAT were not statistically significant for \nthe three economies. Thus, the precautionary motive was not a major factor affecting \ndemand  for  cash  in  the  Euro  Area,  Japan,  and  the  United  States.  Regarding  other \nvariables, the AGE and log (LIFE) variables were statistically significant in the most of \nestimation models, both with positive signs as expected. These findings confirm that the \nage-related factors have a positive contribution to demand for cash.  \n\nThe  NEER_US  was  statistically  significant  for  the  case  of  United  States  and  the \nparameter sign was positive as expected, but the value of its parameter was rather too \nsmall.  NEG_INT  was  not  statistically  significant  for  both  Euro  Area  and  Japan.  This \nimplies that the negative interest rate policy did not significantly affect demand for cash \nin the Euro Area and Japan, contrary to the widely-shared view. This may reflect that the \npolicy rate was a dominant opportunity cost factor contributing to cash demand.  \n\nResults  from  Model  (1)  exhibited  that  absolute  value  of  INTEREST  parameter  was \nlargest in Japan (\u20131.2), followed by the Euro Area (\u20130.3) and the United States (\u20130.08). \nIn the case of Japan, the negative relationship indicates that a decline in the central bank \npolicy  rate  by  1  percentage  point  has  raised  the  ratio  of  cash  in  circulation  \nto  nominal  GDP  by  more  than  1  percentage  point.  Japan\u2019s  high  sensitivity  of  cash \ndemand to the change in the central bank policy rate reflect that cash and retail bank \ndeposits have become a closer substitute. Households have increased both cash and \nbank deposits over the period 2000\u20132018 not only in terms of the value, but also relative \nto  nominal  GDP.  In  addition,  households  increased  cash  holdings  faster  than  bank \ndeposits, as evidenced by an increase in the ratio of cash to total financial assets from \nabout 2% in early 2000s to about 5% in 2018 and a decline in the ratio of bank deposits \nto total assets from about 51% in early 2000s to about 48% in 2018. By contrast, the \nUnited States were least sensitive to changes in the central bank policy rate. Regarding \nthe AGE variable, the parameters were statistically significant and positive for the three \neconomies. The size of the parameters was largest in the Euro Area (0.75), followed by \nthe United States (0.7) and Japan (0.3).  \n\nResults from Model (2) were in line with the results from Model (1). The constant term \nwas not significant for Japan in Model (2), hence, it was excluded from the final model. \nIn the final model, Japan had the largest absolute value with regards to the parameter of \nINTEREST (\u20131.4), followed by the Euro Area (\u20130.3). INTEREST was not significant for \nthe  United  States  in  Model  (2);  it  was  statistically  significant  in  Model  (1)  but  the \nparameter value was rather small. The log (LIFE) variable was significant and positive \nfor the three economies in the final version of Model (2), as expected.  \n\nAs shown by the results of Models (3) and (4), the 10-YEAR variable was statistically \nsignificant in the case of Euro Area. The final version of Model (3) does not include the \nconstant term as it is not statistically significant. The 10-YEAR variable was statistically \nsignificant  and  negative  (-0.2),  while  the  AGE  variable  was  significant  and  positive \n(0.6)\u2014both parameter signs were as expected. Results from Model (4) are consistent \nwith Model (3), where the 10-YEAR and log (LIFE) were significant and both parameter \nsigns were as expected (\u20130.2 for the 10-YEAR and 0.4 for the log (LIFE)). In brief, results \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nfrom Model (3) and (4) show that the rise in the yield of government bond would reduce \ncash demand, while the increase in the proportion of the elderly to total population and \nthe extension of life expectancy would increase demand for cash.  \n\nResults  from  Model  (5)  show  that  INTEREST,  AGE,  and  NEER  variables  were \nstatistically significant in the case of the United States, where the parameter signs for \nthese variables were as expected. Having said that, the size of parameter NEER_US \n(0.006) was rather too small\u2014if not negligible. This finding implies that foreign demand \nfor the US dollar only marginally affected cash demand in the United States once taking \ninto account other motives.  \n\n4.

Among independent variables, the central bank policy \ninterest rate (INTEREST) or the yield of the benchmark 10-year yield (10-YEAR) is used \nto capture the opportunity cost. As for the precautionary motive, crisis dummy variable \n(CRISIS) is adopted, where the value setting of this variable is the same as in Section 3. \nThe stock market volatility index is not used in the pooled-data model due to the lack of \nrelevant  data  for  many  sample  economies.  As  age-related  factors,  AGE  is  used \ninterchangeably with log (LIFE). The term i refers to country index, while t refers to time \n refers to the error term for the respective economy.

Table  2  does  not  display  models  that  incorporate  the  CRISIS \nvariable,  as  it  was  not  statistically  significant  in  the  models;  this  implies  that  crisis  \nwas  not  a  major  determinant  for  cash  hoarding  once  covering  the  22  economies  in  \nthe sample.  \n\nResults from Model (1) exhibited that INTEREST and AGE were statistically significant, \nwith  a  negative  sign  on  INTEREST  and  a  positive  sign  on  AGE.  These  signs  are  in  \nline with the hypotheses. This suggests that for the 22 economies combined, the central \nbank  policy  rate  hike  reduced  demand  for  cash,  while  an  increase  in  the  ratio  \nof elderly population increased demand for cash\u2014similar to the results shown in Section \n3.  Both  INTEREST  and  log  (LIFE)  were  statistically  significant  in  Model  (2).  The \nparameter sign for INTEREST was negative, while positive for log (LIFE)\u2014in line with \nthe hypotheses. Similar to Model (1), demand for cash increased when life expectancy \nrose, but it fell when the policy rates increased. As proxy for opportunity cost, 10-YEAR \nwas less robust than INTEREST as a regressor in the pooled-data models.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis paper focused on the movements of cash in circulation by investigating demand-\ndriven factors contributing to the movements for the period 2000\u20132018. It focused on the \ntime-series movements of cash in circulation (both in terms of the amount and nominal \nGDP) among 22 economies for the period 2000\u20132018. The results of the analysis can \nbe summarized as follows:  \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\n\u2022  Among  the  11  advanced  economies  with  regards  to  the  trend  related  to  \ncash-nominal GDP ratio, there were economies with a rising trend (the Euro Area, \nJapan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United \ntrend  (Australia  \nStates),  economies  roughly  with  a  stable  or  constant \nand  Canada),  and  economies  with  a  declining  trend  (Denmark,  Norway,  and \nSweden).  Regarding  the  economies  with  a  rising  trend,  the  rising  pace \naccelerated  especially  after  the  economic  uncertainty  rose  as  a  result  of  the \nglobal  financial  crisis  of  2008\u20132009.  As  for  the  amount  of  cash  in  circulation,  \nall  the  economies  except  Sweden  from  2009  and  Norway  from  2017  showed  \na secular rising trend. In particular, Japan\u2019s substantially high and rising cash-\nnominal GDP ratio is noticeable, perhaps reflecting the public\u2019s trust in the stable \ngovernment  and  legal  tender  in  the  face  of  persistently-low  inflation  a  limited \nnumber of crimes associated with cash handlings and counterfeiting; it also has \nthe highest proportion of the elderly in total population.  \n\n\u2022  As  for  the  11  emerging/developing  economies,  all  the  economies  recorded  \nthe  secular  rising  trend  from  early  2000s  concerning  the  amount  of  cash  in \ncirculation. Some divergent movements were observed with regards to the ratio \nof cash-nominal GDP ratios. The economies with the rising cash-nominal GDP \nratio  included  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Mexico,  the  Philippines,  Poland,  and \nThailand\u2014all  growing  from  early  2000s.  Meanwhile,  the  economies  with  the \ndeclining cash-nominal GDP ratio included the PRC from early 2000s and Turkey \nsince  2017.  India  experienced  a  sharp  drop  in  the  amount  and  the  ratio  in \nOctober\u2013November  2016  due  to  the  impact  of  the  demonetization  currency \nreform. Finally, the economies with a more or less stable cash-nominal GDP ratio \nincluded Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Russian Federation.  \n\n\u2022  With  regards  to  the  seven  economies  where  data  on  banknotes  in  circulation \ndifferentiated  by  denomination  are  available,  the  economies  were  found  to  be \nclassified  into  two  groups:  economies  with  dominant  highest-denomination \nbanknotes (Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States) and economies \nwith  lower-denomination  banknotes  (Canada,  the  Euro  Area,  Poland,  and  the \nUnited Kingdom). The former group may indicate the presence of high and rising \ndemand  for  cash  hoarding  since  high-denomination  banknotes  are  best suited \nfor  this  purpose.  In  addition,  the  rising  trend  of  the  highest  denomination, \nUS$100,  could  be  attributable  not  to  only  domestic  demand-driven  factors  but \nalso to foreign demand that regards the US dollar as a safe haven currency. As \nfor the second group, the outstanding amount issued over medium-denomination \nbanknotes  have  dominated  that  of  other  higher-denomination  and  lower-\ndenomination  banknotes.  This  is  because  the  public  use  cash  only  for  lower-\nvalue  transactions  and  use  credit  cards  or  other  cashless  payment  tools  for \nhigher-value transactions.  \n\n\u2022  The paper subsequently conducted an empirical analysis first with regards to the \nEuro Area, Japan, and the United States separately in various regression models. \nUsing the ratio of cash in circulation to nominal GDP as a dependent variable, \nthis  paper  used  various  variables  as  proxies  for  the  opportunity  cost  (interest \nrate), the precautionary motive (triggered by economic/financial crises) and other \nmotives (aging and demand from abroad). Regarding the opportunity cost, the \ncentral bank policy rate was the most robust variable in the three economies, as \nit was statistically significant in most of the estimation models adopted. The 10-\nyear  yield  was  used  as  a  variable  alternative  to  the  policy  rate  but  was  found \nstatistically significant only for the Euro Area. This may imply that the central bank \npolicy  rate  is  affecting  cash  demand  in  the  three  economies  mainly  through \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nshorter-term  interest  rates  rather  than  longer-term  interest  rates.  The  other \nstatistically significant variable was the age-related factors. As a proxy for foreign \ndemand  for  the  US  dollar  from  abroad,  the  paper  used  the  nominal  effective \nexchange rate of the US dollar. The variable was statistically significant, but the \nvalue of its parameter was rather too small. The precautionary motive proxied by \nthe crisis dummy variable or the stock market volatility index was not statistically \nsignificant  for  the  three  economies.  The  econometric  analysis  was  then \nconducted  for  pooled-data  regressions  covering  the  22  economies  with  the \nsimilar equation. As was the case of the previous results, the central policy rate \nand age-related factor remained the most important determinant for demand for \ncash in these economies.  \n\neconomies. \n\nemerging/developing \n\nThis paper found that the low interest rate environment generated by massive monetary \neasing contributed to increasing demand for cash not only in advanced economies, but \nin \nthe  \nUnited  States  even  after  the  normalization  of  monetary  policy  was  conducted  from \nDecember 2015 to December 2018. Age-related factors were also found to be important \ncontributor  to  higher  cash  demand.  As  a  future  topic,  it  will  be  interesting  to  examine \nwhether demand for cash will decline if stable crypto assets such as Facebook\u2019s Libra\u2014\nwhich will stabilize the value against the basket of reputable, fiat currencies such as the \nUS dollar\u2014 become widely used in the world. \n\ncontinued \n\ninertia \n\nThe \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1006 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nShirai and Sugandi \n\nAlonso, Javier, Hicham Ganga, Jes\u00fas Lozano Belio, \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00edn, Pablo Mir\u00f3n, \n\nCristina T.

In recent years, cashless payment \nmethods have increasingly become prevalent in the world through various conventional tools \n(such as credit cards, debit cards) and innovative convenient financial services using mobile \nphones  and  smart  phones.  Nevertheless,  cash  in  circulation  has  been  rising  in  many \neconomies,  especially  after  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  rising  trend  is  prevalent  even  in \nadvanced \nhad  \nfull access to bank accounts and credit cards for a long time and other cashless payment tools \nin recent years. The low interest rate environment appears to have affected the rising trends. \nMeanwhile,  emerging/developing  economies  continue  to  issue  cash  significantly  partly \nbecause  their  nominal  GDP  growth  rates  have  been  greater  than  those  of  advanced \neconomies. Interestingly, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) experienced a decline in the \nratio of cash in circulation to nominal GDP, suggesting greater access by residents to bank \naccounts and/or other non-bank cashless payment services. This paper first focuses on the \ntime-series movements of cash in circulation (in terms of the amount and nominal GDP) for \n22 economies for the period 2000\u20132018. It also investigated the movements of banknotes in \ncirculation  differentiated  by  denomination  for  six  economies  whose  data  were  available. \nSeveral  empirical  analyses  with  regards  to  the  cash  demand  function  (controlling  for  the \ntransaction motive by using the ratio of cash in circulation to nominal GDP as a dependent \nvariable) were then conducted for the Euro Area, Japan, and the United States separately. \nSubsequently, an empirical analysis on cash demand covering all the 22 economies for the \nperiod 2000\u20132018 was performed. The paper found that the opportunity cost proxied by the \ncentral  bank  policy  rates  and  age-related  variable  were  the  two  most  important  robust \ndeterminants  for  cash  demand.  Namely,  cash  demand  tends  to  grow  with  a  decline  in  the \npolicy rates and with an advancement of aging. \n \nKeywords: money demand, monetary policy, central bank \n \nJEL Classification: E41, E52, E58 \n \n", " \n"]}
