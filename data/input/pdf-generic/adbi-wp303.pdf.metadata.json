INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nThe effects of the recent global financial crisis have dented India\u2019s growth prospects much more \nthan  had  been  originally  anticipated.  In  2007,  even  as  the  sub-prime  crisis  unfolded  in  the \nUnited States (US), the decoupling theory (Akin and Kose 2007; The Economist 2008), argued \nthat  business  cycles  in  a  number  of  emerging  markets  got  decoupled  from  those  in  advance \neconomies thanks to the rapid expansion of intra-regional trade over the past few decades, high \nsavings ratios, and a burgeoning stockpile of international reserves,. India was also expected to \nremain  insulated  from  the  developments  in  the  US  for  two  main  reasons.  Firstly,  the  Indian \nbanking  sector  had  no  direct  exposure  to  the  toxic  sub-prime  mortgage  assets  or  the  failed \ninstitutions.  Secondly,  much  of  India\u2019s  recent  growth  can  be  attributed  to  a  rise  in  domestic \ndemand  especially  capital  formation.  External  demand  in  the  form  of  exports  of  goods  and \nservices accounted for only 20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \n\nDespite these factors, India was greatly affected by  the global crisis and the country\u2019s growth rate \ndropped from a peak of 10.6% in Q3 2006 to 5.8% in Q4 2008. A key reason for this dip in growth \nrate was India\u2019s increased integration with the rest of the world. Despite a low export-to-GDP ratio, \nIndia\u2019s  level  of  global  integration  as  measured  by  the  sum  of  financial  and  trade  flows,  increased \nfrom 47% in 1997\u201398 to 117% in 2007\u201308.1\n Consequently, the crisis impacted India by reducing the \nIndian  corporate  sector\u2019s  access  to  global  capital  markets,  bringing  down  domestic  liquidity,  and \ncausing  stock  prices  to  fall.  The  financial  crisis  also  affected  certain  sectors  that  were  heavily \ndependent  on  finance  like  real  estate,  exports,  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs). \nGiven  that  some  of  these  sectors  are  labor-intensive,  the  global  meltdown  has  strongly  impacted \nemployment.  \n\nThe  global  crisis\u2019  impact  on  India\u2019s  financial  sector  was  mitigated  due  to  the  gradualist  and \ncalibrated  approach  taken  by  Indian  policymakers  towards  liberalization  of  this  sector.  Indian \npolicymakers  also  introduced  several  countercyclical  measures  during  periods  of  credit  upturn \nprior  to  the  crisis.  Furthermore,  a  series  of  measures  were  undertaken  in  the  post  sub-prime \ncrisis period to enhance the resilience of the sector to future crisis.  \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  India.  In  Section  2,  we \nprovide  a  brief  overview  of  the  Indian  financial  sector,  highlighting  some  of  the  key \ncharacteristics  and  policy  initiatives  that  improved  the  sector\u2019s  resilience.  In  Section  3,  we \nanalyze  the  impact  of  the  global  meltdown  on  the  Indian  financial  sector  as  well  as  the  policy \nmeasures that were undertaken to counter its effects. Then, we estimate the impact of the crisis \non SMEs, focusing on employment and output in these sectors. We also draw attention to some \nof the policy decisions that were outlined to lessen the impact of the crisis on these sectors. In \nSection  4,  we  highlight  some  of  the  policy  measures  that  were  introduced  to  strengthen  the \nIndian  financial  sector  and  enable  it  to  withstand  future  turmoil  after  the  outbreak  of  the  US\u2019 \nsubprime crisis. Section 5 looks at the global reform agenda, mainly concentrating on the Basel \nIII  proposals.  This  section  enumerates  some  of  the  key  proposals  as  well  as  the  likely  impact \nthese proposals will have on the Indian economy. \n\n                                                \n1 Fiscal years in India run from April to March. Thus, for example, the fiscal year covering 1 April 2007 to 31 March \n\n2008 is denoted as 2007\u201308.  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\n2.  A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE INDIAN FINANCIAL SECTOR \n\nThe direct effect of the sub-prime crisis on India\u2019s financial sector was limited, primarily due to \nIndia\u2019s limited exposure to complex derivatives and certain prudential policies put in place by the \nregulators.  India\u2019s  relative  resilience  is  also  an  outcome  of  the  country\u2019s  approach  toward \nfinancial  sector  liberalization  including  capital  account  convertibility.  India  has  adopted  a \ncalibrated  and  gradualist  approach  toward  opening  up  its  capital  account  and  has  prioritized \ncertain  agents  and  flows  in  the  liberalization  process.  In  particular,  right  from  the  onset  of  the \nliberalization process it was recognized that in order to withstand the crisis, policies would need \nto  shift  away  from  debt-  to  non-debt-creating  flows,  enforce  strict  regulation  of  external \ncommercial borrowings (ECBs) (especially the ones with short-term maturity), dissuade volatile \nflows from non-resident Indians, and gradually liberalize outflows. As a result, India was able to \nprevent excessive reliance on foreign borrowing and dollarization of the economy. \n\nFurthermore, the market for credit derivatives in India is in a nascent stage and the originate-to-\ndistribute  model  is  significantly  different  from  the  one  prevailing  in  advanced  markets  (Reddy \n2008).  India  has  restrictions  on  investments  by  domestic  residents  in  such  products  issued \nabroad  and  regulatory  guidelines  on  securitization  do  not  permit  immediate  profit  recognition. \nDerivative  instruments  have  been  cautiously  introduced  in  a  gradualist  manner  for  product \ndiversity and as a risk management tool. \n\nThe  resilience  of  the  Indian  financial  sector  also  lay  in  the  fact  that  most  of  the  sector  is \ndomestically owned. Furthermore, nearly 70% of the banking sector\u2019s assets are held by public \nsector  banks  (Figure  1).2\n  The  relatively  lower  presence  of  foreign  banks  helped  minimize  the \ncrisis\u2019  direct  impact  on  India\u2019s  domestic  economy.  Foreign  banks  tend  to  be  susceptible  to \ncapital  flows  reversal  consequent  to  problems  at  host  country,  the  parent  bank  or  country  of \norigin (Ram Mohan 2009). \n\n                                                \n2 The  dominance  of  public  sector  banks  was  the  outcome  of  the  nationalization  of  privately  owned  banks.  The \n\nReserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  and  the  State  Bank  of  India  were  nationalized  in  1949  and  1955,  while  several  other \n\nmajor private banks were nationalized in 1969 and 1980. Though the nature of governance and incentive framework \n\nin  these  public  sector  banks  did  not  encourage  excessive  risk-taking  and  thereby  discouraged  excessively  risky \n\nexposures,  this  conservative  approach  has  been  criticized  on  grounds  that  it  has  hindered  Indian  banks  from \n\ncompeting  globally,  allowed  inefficiencies  to  go  unchecked,  saddled  banks  with  high  numbers  of  non-performing \n\nloans, and stifled productivity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nFigure 1: Decomposition of the Indian Banking System 2009-10 (Assets) \n\nSource: RBI (2010a) \n\n \n\nThe  financial  sector  in  India  is  subject  to  prudential  regulations  governing  both  capital  and \nliquidity.  Indian  banks  have  significant  liquid  assets  as  they  are  required  to  maintain  cash \nreserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). The excess SLR is a source of liquidity \nbuffer  as  it  allows  central  bank  liquidity  for  managing  banks\u2019  day  to  day  liquidity  needs.  A \nlowering of the SLR leads to additional resources being made available for liquidity support. A \nnumber of measures were also introduced to reduce non-collateralized borrowing and lending. \nAt  the  same  time  measures  were  taken  to  develop  market  repurchase  agreements  and  the \ncollateralized  borrowing  and  lending  obligation  markets.  The  non-bank  players  have  been \nphased out of the collateralized call money market thereby making it a pure inter-bank market. \n\nLiquidity risks can increase manifold during periods of crisis, and India put in place a number of \nmeasures  to  mitigate  these  risks  at  the  short  end.  Banks\u2019  reliance  on  borrowed  funds  is \ndiscouraged and stable sources of funds were promoted by imposing prudential limits on banks\u2019 \npurchased  inter-bank  liabilities  and  linking  these  limits  to  the  net-worth  of  the  firm.  In  March \n2007,  the  banks\u2019  inter-bank  liabilities  were  limited  to  twice  their  worth.  Banks,  whose  capital \nadequacy ratio (CRAR) was 25% above the minimum CRAR of 9%\u2014i.e., 11.25%\u2014could have \nhigher  inter-bank  liabilities  limit  of  300%.  A  close  monitoring  of  incremental  credit  aggregates, \nincluding  credit-deposit  ratio  helped  to  identify  signs  of  overheating.  Typically,  in  the  Indian \ncontext, an incremental credit-deposit ratio of 100%, with a high overall absolute credit deposit \nratio  of  around  70%  is  considered  \u201coverheating.\u201d  The  focus  on  the  credit  deposit  ratio  also \nencourages banks to raise more deposits and reduce the use of purchased funds. The use of \nSLR  and  the  focus  on  the  credit  deposit  ratio  reduced  the  extent  of  leverage  in  the  banking \nsystem. \n\nInvestment  in  non-government  securities  is  also  regulated.  Short-term  investment  of  banks  is \nlimited  to  certificate  of  deposits  and  commercial  paper.  Furthermore,  all  non-government \nsecurity  investments  are  subject  to  credit  rating,  and  investment  in  unlisted  government \nsecurities  is  limited  to  10%  of  overall  non-SLR  investment  portfolio  and  requires  complete \ndisclosure.  \n\nIn  India  there  has  been  an  ongoing  review  of  credit-conversion  factors,  risk  weights,  and \nprovisioning  norms  to  strengthen  capital  requirements.  In  addition,  some  of  the  complex \nstructures  such  as  synthetic  securitization  have  not  been  allowed  so  far.  The  RBI  has  also \nissued  detailed  guidelines  on  the  implementation  of  the  Basel  II  framework.  The  minimum \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nCRAR for banks in India at 9% is higher than the Basel norm of 8%. The banks were also asked \nto ensure a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6% from April 2010. The current average CRAR for \nscheduled commercial banks is over 13%, while the Tier I ratio is at 9%. In addition, India did \nnot include items like intangible assets and deferred tax assets that are now being considered to \nbe deducted internationally. \n\nTo  mitigate  risks,  the  RBI  imposed  additional  prudential  measures  in  respect  of  exposures  to \nspecific sectors, which included formulating specific policies covering exposure limits, collaterals \nto  be  considered, margins to  be kept,  etc.  For  example,  considering  the sharp rise  in  loans  to \nreal estate sectors and rising concerns about asset quality and systemic risks, the risk weight on \nbanks\u2019 exposure to commercial real estate was increased from 100% to 150%, while those on \nloans  extended  to  individuals  against  mortgage  of  housing  properties  and  investments  in \nmortgage-backed securities of housing finance companies were increased from 50% to 75% in \nDecember 2004.  \n\nSimilarly,  with  a  view  to  insulate  banks  from  asset  price  volatility,  prudential  norms  were \nprescribed.  Initially,  the  exposure  was  capped  at  5%  of  a  bank\u2019s  total  advances  as  of  the  last \nday of the previous financial year. However, from April 2007, the aggregate exposure of a bank \nto the capital markets was restricted to 40% of its net worth. Within this ceiling, a bank\u2019s direct \ninvestment  in  shares,  convertible  bonds/debentures,  units  of  equity  owned  mutual  funds,  and \nexposure  to  venture  capital  funds  cannot  exceed  20%.  The  aggregate  exposure  of  a \nconsolidated  bank  to  capital  market  and  its  direct  investment  in  capital markets  are  capped  at \n40% and 20% of the consolidated net worth, respectively. With the strong growth of consumer \ncredit  and  capital  market  exposure  before  the  crisis,  the  RBI  increased  the  risk  weights  from \n100% to 125%. \n\nIn  the  context  of  securitization,  Indian  regulations  prohibit  originators  from  booking  profits \nupfront  at  the  time  of  the  securitization.  In  addition,  it  is  necessary  to  maintain  capital  at  the \nrequired  minimum  of  9%  on  any  credit  enhancement  provided.  Furthermore,  during  the  life  of \nthe  credit  enhanced  transaction,  release  of  credit  enhancement  is  disallowed.  Consequently, \nbanks in India have not had incentive to engage in unbridled securitization as was seen in the \n\u201coriginate to distribute\u201d models of securitization. \n\nThe  derivatives  were  bought  under  the  capital  adequacy  regime  by  laying  down  credit \nconversion factors that were linked to the maturities of real interest contracts and exchange rate \ncontracts. Since April 2003, banks have had the option to determine individual/group borrower \nexposure through either the original exposure method based on original maturity or the current \nexposure  method  based  on  residual  maturity.  The  former  was  withdrawn  in  August  2008  as  it \nwas determined that banks had gained sufficient expertise by then. Currently, credit exposures \ndue  to  interest rate and exchange  rate  derivative  transactions  are computed  using the  current \nexposure method. To improve the capital cushion available for these derivatives the conversion \nfactors  were  doubled  for  certain  residual  maturities.  In  April  2007,  additional  guidelines  were \nintroduced  covering  eligibility  criteria,  principles  for  undertaking  derivative  transactions, \npermissible derivative instruments, and issues related to suitability of a derivative product for a \nclient. \n\nRegulatory  measures  for  non-banking  financial  companies  (NBFCs)  have  been  aimed  at \ncontaining  leverage  and  minimizing  regulatory  arbitrage  between  NBFCs  and  the  banking \nsystem.  To  prevent  banks  from  using  NBFCs  as  a  delivery  vehicle  for  seeking  regulatory \narbitrage or to circumvent bank regulations, the capital adequacy ratios and prudential limits for \nNBFCs  have  been  progressively  brought  nearer  to  those  applicable  to  banks.  The  initial \nemphasis  was  on  deposit-taking  NBFCs,  and  non-deposit-taking  NBFCs  were  subject  to \nminimal regulations. In recent years, however, large non-deposit-taking NBFCs have also been \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nbought under regulation. Capital adequacy requirements were introduced in order to strengthen \nthe capital base of these companies and reduce the possibility of excessive leverage. A capital \nadequacy ratio of 10%, which was higher than for banks, has been prescribed for non-deposit-\ntaking  NBFCs  since  April  2007.  In  addition,  credit  and  investment  concentration  norms  were \nalso  introduced  under  which  non-deposit-taking  NBFCs  can  only  invest  up  to  15%  of  their \nowned  funds  in  any  single  company  and  up  to  25%  of  their  owned  funds  to  a  single  group  of \nborrowers. Furthermore, these NBFCs are only able to lend and invest up to 25% of an owned \nfund to a single party and 40% of an owned fund to a single group of parties.  \n\n3.  IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS  \n\n3.1 \n\nImpact of the Crisis on the Indian Financial Sector \n\nIn  the  initial  days  of  the  sub-prime  crisis,  the  impact  on  India  was  relatively  small.  The  Indian \nfinancial  sector  remained  largely  impervious  to  the  effects  of  the  sub-prime  crisis  since  the \nfinancial  institutions  were  well  capitalized,  and  had  extremely  limited  exposure  to  the  US  sub-\nprime assets and other complex derivatives. Mohan (2008) pointed out that a study carried out \nby the RBI in September 2007 found that none of the Indian or foreign banks within India, with \nwhom consultations had been held, had a direct exposure to sub-prime assets. However, some \nIndian  banks  had  invested  in  the  collateralized  debt  obligations  and  bonds  that  had  some \nunderlying  entities  with  sub-prime  exposure.  Consequently,  while  there  was  no  evidence  of \ndirect impact from exposure to these assets, some banks suffered losses on account of mark-\nto-market  losses  due  to  widening  of  credit  spreads.  However,  these  losses  were  very  small \ncompared to the effected banks\u2019 balance sheets. \n\nHowever,  the  global  financial  crisis  had  a  significant  negative  impact  on  some  of  the  other \nfinancial  sub-sectors  like  money  market,  equity,  foreign  exchange,  and  credit  markets.  These \nmarkets  came  under  pressure  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  including  the  drying  up  of  overseas \nfinancing for Indian corporations and banks, difficulty in raising funds in a bearish capital market, \nand a decline in the internal accrual of companies. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of \nLehman Brothers there was a tightening of the money market and call money rates rose to more \nthan 20% in October 2008. At the time of the onset of the crisis, the Indian corporate sector held \nseveral types of short-term dollar liabilities including trade finance. There was a sharp collapse \nin trade finance after the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Indian corporations were forced to pay a \nlarge  volume  of  trade  credit  that  would  have  otherwise  been  rolled  over.  At  the  same  time, \noverseas branches of Indian banks funded themselves in the short-term inter-bank market in US \ndollars  since  the  deposit  base  was  only  a  fraction  of  the  balance  sheet  in  these  countries \n(Varma 2009). The collapse of the inter-bank market in the post-Lehman period resulted in the \nIndian  banking  system  having  to  pay  dollar  liabilities  that  could  not  be  rolled  over.  Given  the \nshortage of dollar liquidity, Indian corporations and banks were forced to borrow in rupees and \nthen convert it into dollar, which in turn squeezed India\u2019s money market and the call money rate \nshot well outside the band set by the RBI (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nFigure 2: Impact of the Crisis on the Indian Banking Sector \n\nSource: RBI(2010a) and Global Economic Monitor available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/global-economic-\nmonitor (last accessed March 2011). \n\n \n\nPatnaik and Shah (2010) also suggested that because Indian multinationals that were using the \nglobal  money  market  were  short  on  dollars  after  the  collapse  of  Lehman  Brothers,  they \nborrowed  in  India  and  took  capital  out  of  the  country,  thereby  tightening  the  domestic  money \nmarket. Some of these troubled companies that had issued commercial paper in the market\u2014\nespecially  the  real  estate  companies  and  the  non  banking  companies\u2014found  it  difficult  to  roll \nover  the  maturing  paper.  The  commercial  paper  and  certificates  of  deposit  markets  became \nilliquid. The credit default swaps CDS spreads for Indian banks also rose sharply in October and \nNovember 2008 as the risk perception of the stakeholders of these banks went up significantly. \n\nThe  squeeze  in  credit  can  also  be  seen  from  a  sharp  drop  in  the  flow  of  credit  to  the  Indian \ncorporate sector. Table 1 shows that overall credit to the corporate sector was 14.7% lower in \n2008-09 as compared to 2007-08. Much of this decline was due to a sharp drop in the flow of \nfunds  from  foreign  sources.  Despite  a  significant  weakening  of  the  Indian  rupee  in  2008-09, \ncompared to previous years, there was a 41.2% decline in funds flowing in from foreign sources. \nBarring foreign direct investments (FDI), all other foreign sources of credit experienced a sharp \ndrop,  with  resources  raised  through  ECBs  and  American  depository  receipts  or  global \ndepository receipts declining by 60% or more. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\n Table 1: Flow of Credit to the Commercial Sector \n\n(Rs. 10 million) \n\nGrowth Rate \n2008-09  2009-10 \n14.1% \n-5.3% \n-4.9% \n13.4% \n-22.5%  43.5% \n-22.1%  32.0% \n41.4% \n\n-72.4%  125.0% \n\n13,298 \n\n \n2008-09  2009-10 \n2007-08 \n4,44,807  4,21,091  4,80,258 \n4,32,846  4,11,824  4,66,960 \n11,961 \n9,267 \n5,64,558  4,39,926  5,80,821 \n2,55,230  2,58,132  3,64,989  1.1% \n51,478 \n68,249 \n10,660 \n41,841 \n22,267 \n\n31,956 \n1,41,964  14.1% \n25,835 \n28,485 \n33,871 \n\n14,205 \n77,856 \n4,936 \n25,876 \n31,408 \n\n-53.7%  423.4% \n-38.2%  10.1% \n\n82.3% \n\n36,460 \n24,275 \n\n42,277 \n61,574 \n\n60,663 \n42,215 \n\n41.1% \n16.0% \n\n7.8% \n43.5% \n\n \n\nA.

The \noutstanding volume of ECBs had more than doubled from US$26 billion in March 2006 to more \nthan  US$62  billion  in  March  2008.  Given  the  relatively  long  maturity  of  most  of  Indian  ECBs, \nthere was not a significant reduction in the outstanding volume of ECBs in 2008-09, remaining \nmore  or  less  constant.  Foreign  capital  raised  through  American  depository  receipts  or  global \ndepository  receipts  also  shrank  from  US$8.8  billion  in  2007-08  to  US$1.2  billion  in  2008-09. \nShort-term credit like trade credit also dried out and there was a net outflow of US$6.8 billion in \nthe second half of 2008-09, compared with a net inflow of US$9.1 billion in 2007-08.  \n\nLike  other  emerging  market  countries,  India  also  experienced  a  sell-off  in  domestic  equity \nmarkets  by foreign  portfolio  investors, reflecting deleveraging. The  process  started  well  before \nthe collapse of the Lehman Brothers, with foreign investors pulling more than US$6.5 billion out \nof  the  Indian  equity  market  between  January  2008  and  August  2008.  This  capital  outflow \naccelerated  after  the  Lehman  Brothers\u2019  collapse,  with  foreign  institutional  investors  FIIs  taking \nout another US$6.5 billion during September 2008 to April 2009. As evident from Figure 3 this \noutflow of capital had a profound impact on the equity market with the National Stock Exchange \nindex declining by 37.5% between January 2008 and August 2008 and a further 35% between \nSeptember 2008 and April 2009.  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nFigure 3: FII Inflows and National Stock Exchange Index \n\nSource: Securities and Exchange Board of India Database. \n\nIn contrast, FDI flows remained relatively stable during the crisis. Gross FDI inflow during 2008-\n09  stood  at  US$36.3  billion,  marginally  lower  than  the  US$36.8  billion  recorded  in  2007-08. \nHowever,  since  the  last  quarter  of  2008-09,  there  has  been  a  slowdown  in  the  volume  of  FDI \nequity  inflows  into  India.  According  to  the  Department  of  Industrial  Policy  and  Promotion,  FDI \nequity  inflow  between  January  and  May  2009  was  only  US$10.6  billion,  down  by  almost  50% \nfrom the previous year.  \n\nFigure 4: Impact of the Crisis on Bank Credit \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: RBI (2010a) \n\nWith  overseas  financing  drying  up,  corporations  shifted  their  demand  to  domestic  sources. \nInitially, as seen in Figure 4, there was an uptick in credit as domestic banks, especially public \nsector  banks,  were  able  to  provide  some  additional  credit.  However,  since  November  2008, \nthere  has  been  a  steady  decline  in  credit  growth.  A  part  of  this  decline  can  be  attributed  to  a \nslowdown in credit demand as companies have had to re-evaluate investment and growth plans \namidst  the  global  and  domestic  slowdown.  On  the  other  hand,  despite  a  soft  monetary  policy \nand  liquidity  injections  from  the  central  bank,  banks  have  been  hesitant  to  increase  lending. \nConcerns  about  deteriorating  asset  quality,  particularly  for  smaller  firms  or  industries  that  are \nseen as having poor growth prospects, has reduced the supply of credit. \n\nIn  their  search  for  alternate  sources  of  financing,  corporations  started  to  withdraw  their \ninvestment  from  the  domestic  money  market  and  mutual  funds,  thereby  imposing  redemption \npressure  on  these  mutual  funds.  The  pressure  cascaded  down  the  line  to  some  of  NBFCs \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nwhere  these  mutual  funds  had  parked  a  significant  portion  of  their  funds.  Disbursements  by \nNBFCs were clearly hit during the crisis but the impact differed according to the capital structure \nof  the  company,  with  NBFCs  having  larger  asset-liability  mismatches  being  affected  more. \nSimilarly,  NBFCs  that  were  more  dependent  on  mutual  funds  for  funding  were  also  adversely \nimpacted.  Apart  from  witnessing  a  rise  in  cost  of  funds,  many  of  the  NBFCs  also  recorded \ndeterioration  in  asset  quality.  Aggregate  gross  non-performing  assets  (NPA)  trended  up  from \n1.1%  in  2007-08  to  2.8%  in  2008-09,  driven  by  deterioration  in  unsecured  asset  classes \nincluding personal loans, unsecured SME loans, etc. \n\nWhile the substitution of overseas financing by domestic financing led to tightening of the money \nmarkets  and  credit  markets,  the  foreign  exchange  market  came  under  pressure  due  to  the \nreversal of capital flows as part of the global deleveraging process. This along with the fact that \ncorporations  were  converting  domestically  raised  funds  into  foreign  currency  to  meet  their \nexternal obligations put downward pressure on the rupee, which depreciated by 22% between \nApril 2008 and March 2009. \n\nFigure 5: Exchange Rate and Net Intervention \n\nSource: RBI (2010a) \n\n \n\nIn response  to the  increased  demand for the  US  dollar  and  a  need to manage the  volatility  of \nthe rupee, the RBI heavily intervened in the foreign exchange market by selling US$36.6 billion \nof reserves (Figure 5). However, this further added to liquidity tightening. \n\n3.2  Revival of Financial Flows and Stabilization of Financial Sector \n\nIndian policymakers adopted a proactive stance while dealing with the aftermath of the crisis. A \nseries  of  monetary,  fiscal,  and  external  sector  policy  measures  were  initiated  to  mitigate  the \nimpact  of  the  crisis  on  the  financial  and  the  real  sectors.  Monetary  and  external  policies  were \naimed at bolstering domestic and external liquidity while the fiscal policy was aimed at boosting \naggregate demand.  \n\nIndian policymakers acted swiftly and decisively to contain the negative impact of the crisis. As \nliquidity constraints led to tightness in the money market and the spiking of call money rates, the \nRBI  introduced  a  series  of  measures  aimed  at  injecting  liquidity.  Between  August  2008  and \nJanuary 2009, the CRR was lowered from 9% to 5%. This move resulted in a rise in the money \nmultiplier  from  4.3  in  March  2008  to  5.3  in  April  2009,  thereby  ensuring  an  increase  in  broad \nmoney supply.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nThe  RBI  also  sharply  cut  back  various  policy  rates  to  encourage  credit  expansion.  While  the \nrepo rate was lowered from 9% to 4.75%, the reverse repo rate was reduced from 6% to 3.25%. \nThe RBI also resorted to conventional open market operations involving an outright purchase of \ngovernment  securities  in  the  secondary  market  as  well  as  provision  of  liquidity  through  repos \nunder its daily liquidity adjustment facility. However, owing to a weak transmission mechanism \nand  heightened  risk  averseness,  the  lowering  of  policy  rates  did  not  fully  translate  into  a \nreduction  in  retail  rates.  The  weighted  average  benchmark  prime  lending  rate  of  public  sector \nbanks  fell  by  only  two  percentage  points\u2014from  14%  in  March  2008  to  12.1%  in  June  2009\u2014\nwhile  the  average  lending  rates  of  the  public  sector  banks  declined  by  only  1.5  percentage \npoints  over  this  period  (Mohanty  2009).  In  September  2008,  a  second  repo  auction  in  a  day \nunder  the  Liquid  Adjustment  Facility  (LAF)  was  re-introduced.  A  special  refinance  facility  was \nintroduced in October 2008, to allow banks to get refinancing from RBI against a declaration of \nhaving  extended  bona  fide  commercial  loans.  The  SLR  requiring  banks  to  keep  25%  of  their \nliabilities  in  government  securities  was  also  reduced  to  24%  to  enable  banks  to  expand  their \ncredit operations.  \n\nOver  the  past  few  years,  the  RBI  has  issued  a  large  amount  of  Market  Stabilization  Scheme \n(MSS) bonds to sterilize the impact of foreign capital inflows.3\n In the post-crisis period, the RBI \ninjected liquidity by unwinding these bonds. As a result, the RBI\u2019s balance sheet did not show \nan unusual increase, in contrast to the global trend.  \n\nFinally, a number of refinance windows were opened to allow easy access to credit for some of \nthe  troubled  sectors such  as  real  estate,  SMEs,  and  exporters. There  was  also  a  reduction of \nprudential  norms  relating  to  provisioning  and  risk  weights.  Mohan  (2009)  estimated  that  the \nactual/potential injection of liquidity as a result of these measures was Rs 4.9 trillion, or 9.2% of \nGDP (Table 2). \n\nTable 2: Actual/Potential Release of Primary Liquidity \n\nKey Monetary Measures/Facilities  \nMonetary Policy Operations  \n1.

Part of the outflow of capital \nwas  met  by  drawing  down  reserves.  Between  September  2008  and  March  2009,  the  RBI  sold \n                                                \n3 MSS  bonds  are  short-term government  securities  introduced  in  April 2004 to  sterilize  the  expansionary  effects of \n\nsurges  in  capital  inflows.  The  amount  sterilized  through  MSS  bonds  remained  immobilized  in  the  central \n\ngovernment\u2019s account with the RBI. As of end-September 2008, the MSS amounted to more than 1.7 trillion rupees. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nreserves  worth  US$29  billion.  The  central  bank  also  provided  foreign  exchange  swap  facility \nwith  a three month  tenor,  to  Indian  public  and  private  sector  banks  having  overseas  branches \nand subsidiaries. In addition, to fund the swap facility, the banks were allowed to borrow under \nthe  LAF  for  the  corresponding  tenor  at  the  prevailing  repo  rate.  The  foreign  exchange  swap \nfacility was extended to 31 March 2010 and the prudential limit on overseas borrowing by banks \nwas doubled.  \n\nIn  addition,  to  attract  foreign  capital,  interest  rates  on  non-resident  Indian  deposits  were \nprogressively raised by 100 to 175 basis points. Furthermore, the cap on foreign investment in \ncorporate bonds was raised from US$3 billion to US$15 billion, while norms for FIIs and ECBs \nwere  relaxed.  The  ceiling  on  the  interest  rates  at  which  companies  could  borrow  from  abroad \nwas  increased  and  some  of  the  end-use  restrictions  that  were  imposed  on  the  deployment  of \nsuch funds  during  the  high  capital  inflow  period of  2006  and  2007  were restored to the  status \nquo  position.  Some  of  the  NBFCs  that  were  earlier  prohibited  from  overseas  borrowing  were \nallowed to raise short-term borrowings subject to RBI approval. \n\nWhile  most  of  the  monetary  policy  measures  were  aimed  at  ensuring  adequate  liquidity,  the \nfiscal  measures  endeavored  to  boost  aggregate  demand.  Fortuitously,  a  number  of  fiscal \nmeasures had been announced and implemented prior to the transmission of the crisis. These \nincluded a complete waiver of existing farm loans for small and marginal farmers, an increase in \ncivil  servants\u2019  salaries  in  conformity  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Sixth  Pay  Commission, \nand extending the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to cover the entire country.4\n \nIn addition, to ensure against transmission of the sharp rise in international commodity prices in \nthe  first  half  of  2008  to  domestic  retail  prices,  large  scale  food  and  fertilizer  subsidies  were \nintroduced.  \n\nAs  the  crisis  progressed,  India,  initiated  a  slew  of  fiscal  measures  to  increase  aggregate \ndemand. The measures included a general reduction in excise duties and service tax, approval \nfor  additional  expenditure,  allowing  various  state governments to  borrow  additional  amount for \nundertaking capital expenditure, etc. The government also introduced some measures that were \naimed  at  selected  industries  that  were  adversely  impacted  by  the  crisis.  For  example,  labor-\nintensive  export  industries  such  as  handlooms,  carpets,  and  handicrafts;  textiles;  gems  and \njewelry  marine  products;  and  SMEs  were  provided  with  an  interest  subvention  of  2%  until  31 \nMarch 2009 subject to a minimum rate of interest of 7% per annum for pre-shipment and post-\nshipment  export  credit.  In  addition,  a  fund  of  Rs  1.1  billion  to  ensure  a  full  refund  of  terminal \nexcise duty/central sales tax was set up, and various export incentive schemes of Rs 3.5 billion \nwere also introduced. An additional Rs 1.4 billion was allocated to the textile sector to clear the \nentire backlog of the Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme. The India Infrastructure Finance \nCompany Limited was allowed to raise Rs 100 billion through the issuance of tax-free bonds to \nsupport its infrastructure schemes under a public-private partnership mode.  \n\nAs  a  result  of  these  measures,  India\u2019s  financial  sector  has  enjoyed  relatively  sound  health  in \n2010.  The  tightness  in  the  liquidity  market  eased  greatly  with  the  inter-bank  call  money  rate \nreturning to within the LAF corridor. There was also a significant reduction in Indian banks\u2019 CDS \nspreads during the first half of 2009. Balance sheets of scheduled commercial banks increased \nby 16.5% on a year\u2013on-year basis in September 2010. This was largely driven by an upturn in \ncredit  off-take,  with  advances  increasing  by  20.7%.  However,  this  was  significantly  lower  than \nthe  peak growth rate  of 25%  achieved  in  the  pre-crisis  period.  In  contrast,  deposit growth  has \nbeen  sluggish  and  deposits  grew  by  only  16%.  Consequently,  there  has  been  a  sharp  rise  in \n\n                                                \n4 Under  this  scheme,  an  adult  member  of  any  rural  household  willing  to  do  public  works-related  unskilled  manual \n\nwork is guaranteed 100 days of employment in every financial year. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nincremental  credit-to-deposit  ratio,  especially  for  certain  banks  that  funded  their  incremental \nadvances through borrowings and retirement of investment. The rise in credit was largely due to \na  rise  in  retail  loans  (of  which  housing  loans  were  a  major  part),  prior  sector  lending,  and \ninfrastructure. In response to the rise in housing loans, the RBI introduced a series of measures \nto  curb  a  buildup  of  excessive  risks,  including  an  increase  in  risk  weights  and  a  rise  in \nprovisioning norms. \n\nIndian  banks  also  had  leverage  multiples  that  were  significantly  lower  than  global  ratios. \nAccording  to  RBI  (2010),  the  leverage  multiples  of  the  top  50  American,  European,  and \nJapanese banks was around 30 in 2007, as compared to the leverage multiple of 16.8 in 2009-\n10 for Indian banks. Apart from low leverage, the exposure of Indian banks to highly leveraged \ncompanies is also relatively moderate. \n\nSecuritization volumes continued to decline in India in 2009-10 with issuance volumes declining \nby  nearly  22%.  This  dip  was  largely  due  to  60%  reduction  in  single  corporate  loan \nsecuritizations or Loan Sell-Offs (LSO). A number of factors contributed to the decline including \nmarket  volatility,  and  tight  liquidity.  Redemption  pressures  faced  by  mutual  funds  due  to \nproposed regulatory changes on minimum holding period and minimum retention requirements \nin case of securitization deals also contributed to the slowdown.  \n\nThere  was  also  a  significant  decline  in  the  total off  balance  sheet  exposures  of the  scheduled \ncommercial  banks  (SCBs),  with  the  OBS  exposures,  as  a  percentage  of  total  balance  sheets, \ndropping  by  218%  to  178%  during  2009-10.  In  2010-11  there  has  been  a  moderate  increase \nwith OBS exposures increasing to 210.8% in the first half of 2010-11. Most of the banks in India, \nespecially  domestic  banks,  mostly  hold  traditional  OBS  items  like  financial  and  performance \nguarantees,  acceptances,  endorsements,  and  forward  exchange  rate  contracts.  However,  as \ncan  be  seen  from  Figure  6,  foreign  banks  continue  to  have  high  OBS  exposures,  which \nincreased from 1555% as of the end of March 2010 to 1828% as of the end September of the \nsame year. \n\nFigure 6: Concentration and Composition of OBS Exposures \n\n(a)  Composition of Exposures \nSource: RBI (2010c) \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) Concentration of Exposures \n\n \n\nThe financial  soundness  of  the  Indian  banking  sector  is  exemplified  by  looking  at  some  of the \nkey indicators in Table 3. Indian banks on average are well capitalized and the current ratios are \nin excess of what is required under Basel II norms. As pointed out earlier, commercial banks in \nIndia are required to maintain capital to the extent of 9% of risk-weighted assets, different from \nthe Basel II requirement of 8%. From 1 April 2010, these banks are also required to maintain a \ncore  CRAR  (Tier  I  capital  to  total  risk-weighted  assets)  of  6%  as  compared  to  the  Basel  II \nrequirement  of  4%.  The  capital  adequacy  position  of  most  Indian  banks  was  well  above  the \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nregulatory  requirements  with  CRAR  and  core  CRAR  being  in  excess  of  14%  and  10% \nrespectively in March 2010 and September 2010.  \n\nTable 3: Financial Performance of Indian Banking Sector \n\n \nReal  business  per  employee  (in  Rs. \nMillions) \nReal  profit  per  employee \nMillions) \nNet NPA ratio (per cent) \nCRAR (per cent) \nReturn on Assets (per cent) \nSource: RBI (2010d) \n\n(in  Rs. \n\n \n\n2005-06  2006-07  2007-08  2008-09  2009-10 \n\n40.22 \n\n47.04 \n\n55.20 \n\n59.85 \n\n66.98 \n\n0.27 \n1.22 \n12.32 \n1.01 \n\n0.31 \n1.02 \n12.28 \n1.05 \n\n0.41 \n1.00 \n13.01 \n1.12 \n\n0.45 \n1.05 \n13.98 \n1.13 \n\n0.46 \n1.12 \n14.58 \n1.05 \n\nHowever,  a  worrying  feature  is  the  deterioration  of  asset  quality  in  the  aftermath  of  the  global \nfinancial crisis. In 2009-10, the stock of NPAs grew at a rapid rate of 20.6%, which was higher \nthan the 16.7% rate of growth of gross advances. This led to deterioration in the gross and net \nratio of NPAs to gross and net advances in 2009-10. The increase in NPAs was mitigated by the \nonetime special dispensation in restructuring norms permitted by the RBI for entities that were \ntemporarily affected by the global crisis.  \n\nThe profitability of the Indian banking sector also suffered a setback with a decline in the rate of \ngrowth  of  profit.  The  decline  was  brought  about  by  subdued  credit  off-take  and  preference  for \nrisk-free  but  low  yielding  investments  during  the  crisis.  Increased  requirements  for  provisions \nalso adversely affected banks profitability.  \n\n3.3 \n\nImpact of the Crisis on Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises \n\nThe micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) sector is an important contributor to \nthe Indian economy in terms of output, employment, and exports. The sector accounts for 45% \nof manufacturing output and 40% of India\u2019s exports and is also one of the biggest employment \ngenerators;  about  59  million  people  are  employed  by  MSMEs.  Given  the  importance  of  this \nsector  and  to  make  credit  easily  available,  a  large  part  of  this  sector  is  covered  under  priority \n  This  mandated  priority  sector  lending  also  helped  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \nsector  lending.5\ncredit squeeze on the SME sector.  \n\nThe  Indian  manufacturing  sector  was  hit  hard  by  the  global  meltdown.  Though  the  sector \nwitnessed  some  slowdown  even  prior  to  the  Lehman  Brothers\u2019  collapse,  the  deceleration  was \nexacerbated  post-October  2008.  In  Table  4,  the  industrial  growth  during  the  period  January \n2007 to October 2010 is split into three periods viz. pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis. It is evident \nthat the Indian industrial sector was hit hard due to the global meltdown, growing by only 0.9% \nduring  the  period  October  2008  to  May  2009.  The  SME  sector  faced  a  host  of  problems  that \nincluded  holdup  of  payments  from  both  foreign  and  domestic  buyers  that  were  adversely \naffected by the global slowdown, a significant increase in stocks of finished goods due to falling \ndemand, and a fall in value of inventories including some raw materials like metal and crude oil \nproducts.  SMEs  also  suffered  a  sharp  slowing  down  of  capacity  expansion  due  to  a  fall  in \ninvestment  demand  as well  as  a  decline  in  demand for  employment  intensive  industries,  such \nas gems and jewelry, construction and allied activities, textiles, auto and auto components, and \n                                                \n5 State-owned  and  Indian  private  banks  need  to  earmark  40%  of  their  loans  for  the  priority  sectors  which  include \n\nagriculture, small enterprise, microcredit, education, and housing finance. The limit is 32% for foreign banks. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nother export-oriented industries. The adverse impact on employment was quite severe in some \nof these sectors. \n\nTable 4: Average Annual Growth Rates of Key Industries \n\nJanuary 07 to September 08  October 08 to May 09  June 09 to October 10 \n8.1% \n\n \nIndustrial Production \nBeverages and Tobacco  13.8% \nChemical \n9.4% \nFood \n6.5% \n7.5% \nLeather \nNon-Metal and Minerals  5.0% \n4.1% \nPaper \n6.2% \nRubber \n43.0% \nWood \n4.8% \nTextiles \n9.8% \nMetaland Machinery \nSource: RBI (2010a) \n\n  \n\n0.9% \n7.4% \n1.8% \n-14.5% \n-11.7% \n3.3% \n-0.8% \n3.8% \n-4.7% \n1.5% \n2.7% \n\n13.7% \n0.4% \n9.2% \n6.8% \n8.9%  \n15.2% \n6.3% \n15.0% \n0.2% \n7.1% \n25.6% \n\nIn  an  attempt  to  gauge  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  meltdown  on  employment  and \nearnings, the Labour Bureau commissioned a quarterly survey of a sample of companies across \na broad spectrum of sectors, a number of which are dominated by SMEs. The gems and jewelry \nsector was hit quite hard as it is quite heavily dependent on exports, which account for nearly \n14%  of  India\u2019s  merchandise  exports.  The  industry  is  highly  fragmented  and  unorganized  and \nmost of the units are family-owned enterprises. With the decline in economic activity in the US, \none of the largest destinations of Indian products in this sector, there was a decline of more than \n20% in sales to the US. This coincided with a dip in domestic sales due also to the rising price \nof  gold.  This  resulted  in  laying  off  of  skilled  and  unskilled  worker.  According  to  the  Labour \nBureau  (2009),  employment  in  this  sector  dropped  by  0.16  million  between  October  and \nDecember  2008  at  a monthly  rate  of 10.3%,  compared to  an  increase  of 0.02 million  between \nApril  and  September  2008.  The  decline  was  higher  for  exporting  units  (11.3%)  than  non-\nexporting units (8.9%). There were some signs of recovery of employment in this sector during \nJanuary to March 2009, when employment recovered by 0.03 million.  \n\n \n\n Textile \n\n Leather  \n\n Metals \n\n Transport \n\n IT-BPO  \n\n0.206 \n\n0.008 \n\n-0.001 \n\n-0.008 \n\n0.007 \n\n0.258 \n\nTable 5: Estimated Change in Employment in Select Sectors \n\nApril to \nSeptember \n2008 \n\nOctober \nto \nDecember \n2008 \n\nJanuary \nto \nMarch \n2009 \n\nApril to \nJune \n2009 \n\nJuly \nto \nSeptember \n2009 \n\nOctober \nto \nDecember \n2009 \n\nJanuary \nto \nMarch \n2010 \n\nApril to \nJune \n2010 \n\nJuly \nto \nSeptember \n2010 \n\n(Millions) \n\n-0.107 \n\n0.208 \n\n-0.154 \n\n0.318 \n\n-0.119 \n\n-0.063 \n\n0.245 \n\n0.006 \n\n-0.033 \n\n0.007 \n\n-0.008 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.021 \n\n0.004 \n\n-0.100 \n\n-0.029 \n\n-0.001 \n\n0.065 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.045 \n\n0.027 \n\n Automobile \n\n-0.169 \n\n0.002 \n\n0.023 \n\n0.024 \n\n0.029 \n\n0.051 \n\n0.029 \n\n Gems & Jewelry \n\n0.022 \n\n-0.159 \n\n0.033 \n\n-0.020 \n\n0.058 \n\n0.024 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.066 \n\n-0.004 \n\n-0.001 \n\n0.000 \n\n-0.002 \n\n-0.002 \n\n-0.021 \n\n0.013 \n\n0.092 \n\n-0.034 \n\n0.026 \n\n0.129 \n\n0.129 \n\n0.108 \n\n Handloom-Power \n\n-0.014 \n\n-0.016 \n\n0.007 \n\n0.049 \n\n0.015 \n\n-0.005 \n\n-0.003 \n\n0.006 \n\nSource: Labour Bureau, Quarterly Report on Employment Trends, Various Issues. available at \nhttp://labourbureau.nic.in/reports.htm \n\nTextiles,  another  sector  that  contributes  heavily  to  Indian  exports,  accounts  for  nearly  17%  of \ntotal  export  earnings.  It  is  also  highly  employment  intensive  and  is  the  largest  provider  of \nemployment after agriculture, employing around 35 million people.

This \nhad  an  effect  on  employment  as  well.  Though  employment  in  this  sector  increased  by  0.21 \nmillion  between  April  and  September  2008,  it  fell  by  0.11  million  during  October  to  December \n2008.  Sectors  worst  affected  included  spinning,  weaving,  and  finishing  of  textiles,  and \nmanufacturing  of  other  textiles,  which  lost  about  0.11  and  0.09  million.  Like  the  gems  and \njewelry  sector,  the  textile  sector  witnessed  a  recovery  in  terms  of  employment  in  January  to \nApril  2009,  with  average  employment  increasing  by  0.96%,  though  there  were  differences \nbetween exporting and non-exporting units. The exporting units experienced a decline of 1.09% \nduring October to December 2008 and another 0.06% during January to March 2009 while the \nnon exporting units increased employment by 0.02% and 1.78% in these two periods. \n\nTwo  other  sectors  where  SMEs  play  a  very  important  role  and  were  impacted  by  the  global \ncrisis,  are  the  leather  and  auto  components  sectors.  In  2008,  the  leather  sector  provided \nemployment to about 2.5 million people and around 80% of the units in the sector were in the \nunorganized sector. Labour Bureau (2009) estimated that employment in this sector declined by \n0.03  million  during  January  to  March  2009.  While  tanning  and  dressing  of  leather  enterprises \nlaid off about 10,000 workers, nearly 20,000 workers lost their jobs in the footwear sector. The \nlosses  were  shared  by  the  exporting  and  the  non-exporting  units. While  in  the  exporting  units \nemployment declined by 2.37% per month, in the non-exporting sector employment declined at \na higher rate of 3.94% during January to April 2009. The auto component sector also lost about \n0.17 million workers during October to December 2008, with a majority of the job losses (0.15 \nmillion) in the motor vehicle accessories production sector. The exporting units were worst hit, \nexperiencing  a  decline  in  workforce  of  9.23%  during  October  to  December  2008,  and  another \n1.48% during January to March 2009. In contrast, employment in non-exporting units declined \nby 3.88% during October to December 2008, but recovered by 1.04% in January to March 2009.  \n\nGiven the importance of SMEs in output, exports, and employment, policymakers introduced a \nnumber  of  measures  to  alleviate  the  overall  impact  of  the  global  meltdown  on  these  sectors,. \nSome  of  the  broad  measures,  such  as  additional  plan  expenditure  and  steps  to  ensure  full \nutilization of funds already provided, helped stimulate aggregate demand of the SME sectors as \nwell.  In  addition,  certain  measures,  aimed  specifically  at  the  SME  sectors,  were  also \nimplemented.  These  include  the  pre-  and  post-shipment  export  credit  for  labor  intensive \nexports\u2014i.e.,  textiles  (including  handlooms,  carpets,  and  handicrafts),  leather,  gems  and \njewelry,  and  marine  products.  Policymakers  provided  the  SME  sector  with  an  interest \nsubvention  of  2%  subject  to  a  minimum  rate  of  interest  of  7%  per  annum.  Some  of  the \nmeasures  aimed  at  boosting  exports,  such  as  funds  to  ensure  full  refund  of  terminal  excise \nduty/central  sales  tax,  additional  allocation  for  export  incentive  schemes,  making  the \ngovernment back-up guarantee available to the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation to enable \nit to provide guarantees for exports to difficult markets and products and refund of service tax on \nforeign agent commissions, helped a number of SME sectors that were export-oriented.  \n\nThe  cost  of  these  schemes  was  borne  by  the  government  and  was  reflected  in  wider  fiscal \ndeficit  since  the  onset  of  the  crisis.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  2%  subvention,  the \nestimated cost was Rs 12.5 billion between December 2008 and March 2009. A further Rs 14 \nbillion have been provided to extend the scheme to March 2011. Similarly, the credit guarantee \nscheme  was  launched  by  the government  to  ensure  collateral-free  credit to the  MSME  sector. \nThe Ministry of MSMEs and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), established a \ntrust  with  the  majority  being  contributed  by  the  government  and  SIDBI  in  the  ratio  of  4:1, \nrespectively.  The  contribution  amount  to  the  trust  as  of  31  March  2010  was  around  Rs  19.1 \nbillion. By the end of March 2010, more than 300,000 proposals from MSMEs were approved for \nguaranteed coverage for aggregate credit of Rs 115.5 billion. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nTo alleviate financing problems and facilitate the flow of credit to SMEs, the RBI announced a \nrefinancing facility of Rs 70 billion for SIDBI, which was available to support incremental lending, \neither  directly  to  SMEs  or  indirectly  via  banks, NBFCs,  and  state financial  corporations (SFC). \nFurthermore,  to  boost  collateral-free  lending,  the  guarantee  coverage  under  the  Credit \nGuarantee  Scheme  for SMEs  on  loans  has  been  extended  from  Rs  5  million  to  Rs  10  million \nwith guarantee coverage of 50%. The guarantee cover was subsequently extended to 85% for \ncredit facility up to Rs 0.5 million. To encourage banks to cover more loans under the guarantee \nscheme, the lock-in period was reduced from 24 to 18 months. Various public sector units were \nalso advised to ensure prompt payments of bills to MSMEs. \n\nAs  a  result  of  these  measures  the  industrial  sector  started  seeing  signs  of  revival  from  mid-\n2009, recording an average growth of 13.7% between June 2009 and October 2010. However, \nthe  employment  data  paints  a  different  scenario.  Aggregate  employment,  which  declined  by \n0.47 million during October to December 2008 in the sectors highlighted in Table 5, increased \nby  0.28  million  during  January  to  March  2009.  However,  employment  again  shrunk  by  0.13 \nmillion  from  April  to  June  2009.  Overall,  employment  exhibited  a  turnaround  from  July  2009, \nwith  1.46  million  jobs  being  added  between  July  2009  and  September  2010.  However,  a \ndisaggregated analysis shows a different picture. More than 95% of these jobs were created in \ntwo  industry  groups:  textiles  and  information  technology/business  process  outsourcing  (BPO). \nThe  other  six  sectors  just  added  marginally,  with  employment  in  automobile  and  auto  parts, \ngems and jewelry, and transport being lower than pre-crisis levels.  \n\nThe  revival  of  SMEs  is  likely  to  be  hampered  by  the  recent  crisis  engulfing  the  Indian \nmicrofinance  sector.  Interestingly,  the  microfinance  sector  remained  relatively  resilient  to  the \neffects  of  the  global  crisis.  Despite  an  overall  liquidity  crunch,  the  outstanding  microfinance \nloans  increased  from  Rs  229.54  billion  in  2009-10  to  Rs  359.39  billion  in  2008-09.  At  these \nlevels, microfinance constituted 1.29% of gross bank credit for scheduled commercial banks in \n2009-10,  an  increase  of  0.27%  over  the  last  year.  The  client  outreach  has  also  increased \nsharply from 56 million in 2008-09 to 70 million in 2009-10.  \n\nlivelihood  promotion  programs, \n\nto  Eliminate  Rural  Poverty.  Several \n\nMuch  of  the  rise  in  the  microfinance  sector  has  been  concentrated  in  the  state  of  Andhra \nPradesh,  where  the  government  introduced  a  series  of  projects  to  fight  poverty  including  the \nSociety \nincluding \nemployment  generation,  vocational  training,  and  access  to  credit  through  self  help  groups \n(SHGs), were undertaken. These SHGs have the deepest penetration in Andhra Pradesh with \n1.47  million  SHGs  reaching  17.1  million  clients.  Traditionally,  SHGs  were  based  on  member \nsavings  and  rules-capped  bank  loans  to  the  SHGs  were  capped  at  three  to  four  times  this \nsavings  base,  which  limited the  borrowings  to  less than  Rs  100,000.  However,  under  the total \nfinancial  inclusion  program  initiated  by  the  state  government,  banks  increased  their  lending  to \nSHGs up to Rs 500,000. Furthermore, in some cases the repayment period was increased from \na one year to five year period. Any amount of interest paid by SHGs above 3% was reimbursed \nto the SHG by the Andhra Pradesh government, provided the group did not default on its bank \nloan.  \n\nThe  presence  of  the  large  and  well-funded  state-backed  SHG  program  and  some  of  India\u2019s \nlargest  and  fastest  growing  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  led  to  rapid  proliferation  of  credit \nacross  Andhra  Pradesh  and  wide  use  of  multiple  loans  by  borrowers.  The  problem  was \nexacerbated  by  the  high  level  of  household  debt,  with  an  average  outstanding  debt  per \nhousehold  of  Rs  65,000,  eight  times  higher  than  national  average  of  Rs  7,700  per  poor \nhousehold. The rapid growth of the two approaches has significantly increased access to credit. \nState-sponsored  SHG-lending  reached  17.1  million  SHG  members  with  Rs  117  billion \noutstanding,  while  MFIs  reached  9.7  million  borrowers  with  Rs  72  billion  outstanding.  This \ncombined  outreach  and  continued  growth  resulted  in  borrower  accounts  of  SHGs  and  MFIs \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\ntogether,  which,  on  a  per  capita  basis  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  is  over  four  times  the  median  of \nIndian  states. Thus,  Andhra  Pradesh  had  a  much  higher  penetration  of microfinance  than  any \nother  state  in  India,  which  resulted  in  households  having  too  many  loans  and  too  much  debt \nthan was supportable with their income levels and ability to repay. \n\nThe increased competition between the MFIs and SHGs often resulted in both models vying for \nthe  same  households  in  the  same  village.  There  was  an  alarming  rise  in  the  level  of  multiple \nborrowings  and  most  individuals  started  using  microloans  simply  to  repay  old  microloans,  and \nrarely  for  productive  investment.  At the  same  time,  banks found  it  easier  to  lend to  MFIs  than \nSHGs for a number of reasons. Lending to MFIs lowered costs as well as risks as these loans \nqualified for priority sector lending and the banks could pass the cost of servicing to the MFIs. \nMFI\u2019s high success rates resulted in attracting more players and intensifying competition. MFIs \nalso  moved  beyond  lending  to  households  with  existing  predictable  cash  flows  and  began \ntargeting  households  relying  on  uncertain,  daily  cash  flows.  The  easy  money  also  altered  the \ncredit culture in the state with borrowers becoming blas\u00e9 about borrowing and negotiating loans \nby pitting MFIs against each other.  \n\nIn this context, the present crisis was triggered by a series of external factors that resulted in a \nslowdown of labor income. These included heavy rains in Andhra Pradesh, which lowered farm \nemployment; stir for a separate state of Telengana, which disrupted several economic activities; \nand inadequate employment opportunities under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act \n(NREGA).  This  resulted  in  several  instances  of  defaults.  As  MFI  officials  and  group  members \npressured  some  of  the  defaulters  to  make  payments,  there  were  several  cases  of  finance-\nrelated suicides in the state. \n\nIn response, the government passed an ordinance in October 2010 that aimed at imposing a set \nof  conditions  on  MFIs  such  as  district-by-district  registration,  requirements  to  make  collections \nnear  local  government  premises,  and  a  shift  to  monthly  repayment  schedules.  This  restricted \nground-level  operations of  the  MFIs  and  loan  collections for  MFIs  in  Andhra  Pradesh  dropped \nsharply.  The  problem  was  amplified  with  politicians  at  the  state  level  making  populist \nannouncements, which led to a rise in non-repayment of loans. Faced with low loan collections, \nthe  MFIs  with  proportionally  larger  exposures  in  Andhra  Pradesh  found  it  difficult  to  refinance \ntheir  loans  with  commercial  banks  or  to  raise  new  equity,  and ran the  risk  of  becoming  illiquid \nand  insolvent.  Some  MFIs  that  have  a  more  diverse  portfolio  also  ran  the  risk  of  having  to \nabsorb  large  losses  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  which  may  have  had  an  impact  on  their  growth \nelsewhere.  It  is  possible  that  a  few  MFIs  had  to  close  or  dramatically  scale  down  their \noperations in Andhra Pradesh.  \n\nIn recent months there have been several rounds of negotiations among stakeholders to ensure \nthe  viability  of  the  microfinance  industry.  MFIs  have  agreed  to  lower  interest  rates  and \nrestructure  debt.  The  RBI  constituted  a  committee  to  study  issues  and  concern  about  the \nmicrofinance  sector.  The  committee  recommended  the  creation  of  a  separate  category  of \nNBFCs operating in the microfinance sector to be designated as NBFC-MFIs. Furthermore, the \ncommittee also proposed that these NBFC-MFIs hold more than 90% of their assets in the form \nof qualifying assets, that there should be a limit of Rs 50,000 annual family income and or Rs \n25,000 for loans to single borrowers, and more than 75% of loans given by MFIs should be for \nincome generating purposes as well as certain restrictions on other services provided by MFIs. \nRegarding  interest  chargeable  to  the  borrower,  the  committee  recommended  an  average \n\u201cmargin  cap\u201d  of  10% for  MFIs that  have  a  loan portfolio  of  Rs  1  billion  and  of  12% for smaller \nMFIs,  and  a  cap  of  24%  interest  on  individual  loans.  Furthermore,  MFIs  can  levy  only  three \ncharges viz. processing fee, interest, and insurance charges. To mitigate the problem of over-\nborrowing,  multiple  lending,  and  coercive  methods  of  recovery,  the  committee  also  proposed \nthat a borrower can be member of only one SHG or joint liability group, not more than two MFIs \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\ncan lend to a single borrower, a minimum period of moratorium between the disbursement of a \nloan and the commencement of recovery, the tenure of the loan must vary with its amount and \nestablishment of grievance redressal procedures, and establishment of an ombudsmen.  \n\nIt is important to find a speedy resolution to ensure that poor people have access to responsible \nfinancial  services.  This  would  involve  the  resumption  of  collecting  and  disbursing  loans \nthroughout  Andhra  Pradesh  as  well  as  banks  continuing  to  provide  liquidity  to  microfinance \nproviders of all kinds. \n\n4.  POST CRISIS REGULATORY RESPONSE \n\nAs  was  discussed  in  Section  3.2,  policymakers  reacted  proactively  to  the  crisis.  To  ensure \nadequate  liquidity  in  the  economy  and  access  to  credit,  policy  interest  rates  and  quantum  of \nbank reserves  kept  with  the  RBI  were  reduced aggressively.  In  addition,  some  of  the  troubled \nsectors like SMEs, NBFCs, real estate, and exports were provided additional refinance facilities \nfor  specific  sectors.  To  augment  foreign  exchange  liquidity,  the  interest  rate  ceiling  on  the \nforeign  currency  deposits  by  non-resident  Indians  were  increased,  the  ECB  regime  for \ncorporations  was  relaxed,  NBFCs  and  housing  finance  companies  were  allowed  access  to \nforeign  borrowing,  and  a  rupee-dollar  swap  facility  was  provided  for  Indian  banks\u2019  overseas \nbranches.  \n\nThorat  (2010)  pointed  out  that  a  number  of  countercyclical  measures  were  also  introduced. \nSome of the additional risk weights and provisioning norms that were introduced during a period \nof  high  credit  growth  were  withdrawn  and  restored  to  previous  levels.  The  regulations \noverseeing  the  restructured  accounts  were  modified,  and  banks  were  allowed  to  treat  the \nrestructured  accounts  as  \u201dstandard\u201d  assets  provided  that they  met  certain  safeguards  such  as \nconditions  of  viability,  adequate  provisioning,  and  full  disclosure.  This  step  was  introduced  to \npreserve  the  economic  and  productive  value  of  assets  that  were  otherwise  viable  and  was  a \nonetime measure.  \n\nTo  alleviate  some  of the  pressure  on the  NBFCs, they  were  permitted  to  issue  perpetual  debt \ninstruments  qualifying  for  regulatory  capital.  In  addition,  NBFCs\u2019  deadline  to  raise  their  CRAR \nfrom  12%  to  15%  was  postponed  by  one  year.  Some  of  the  existing  disclosure  norms  for \nNBFCs  were  also  strengthened  and  the  systemically  important  NBFCs  were  advised  to  make \nadditional disclosures in their balance sheets relating to CRAR, exposure to real estate sector, \nand maturity pattern of assets and liabilities.  \n\nSlow growth rate and the restructuring could have an adverse impact on the banks. To mitigate \nthis,  and  to  ensure  that  banks  built  up  provisions  when  their  earnings  are  good,  banks  were \nadvised  by  RBI,  in  December  2009,  that  their  total  provision  coverage  ratio,  including  floating \nprovisions, should not be below 70% by September 2010.  \n\nThe  recent  crisis  has  brought  into  question  the  role  of  a  number  of  financial  instruments  and \nprocedures. Regulators in India have decided to move cautiously and in a calibrated manner in \nadopting  some  of these instruments.  For  example,  in the  case  of securitization,  to  ensure that \nthe  originators  do  not  compromise  on  due  diligence  of  assets  that  are  generated  for \nsecuritization, a minimum lock-in period of one year for bank loans is required before these can \nbe  securitized  (Thorat  2010).  Furthermore,  RBI  also  proposes  to  stipulate  that  the  minimum \nretention criteria for the originators be 10% of the pool of assets being securitized to ensure due \ndiligence.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nIndia  has  also  moved  cautiously  on  currency  and  interest  rate  futures.  Currency  futures  were \nintroduced in India in August 2008 on the recommendation of a working group set up by the RBI \nthat looked at the international experience. Banks were allowed to become direct trading-cum-\nclearing members of the currency futures exchanges subject to certain prudential criteria such \nas  minimum  net  worth,  CRAR,  profitability,  etc.  While  initially  only  US  dollar-rupee  contracts \nwere  allowed,  the  futures  market  broadened  in  January  2010  to  include  currency  futures \ncontracts  in  currency  pairs  of  euro-rupee,  yen-rupee  and  pound  sterling-rupee.  To  effectively \nmanage  interest  rate  risk,  interest  rate  futures  were  introduced  in  August  2009.  The \nstandardized  interest  rate  futures  contracts  are  on  a  10-year  notional  coupon-bearing \ngovernment  of  India  security  with  a  notional  coupon  of  7%  per  annum  with  semi-annual \ncompounding.  \n\nIn  line  with  India\u2019s  approach  toward  financial  liberalization  in  a  calibrated  manner,  credit \nderivatives  were  sought  to  be  introduced  in  a  gradual  manner  with  the  RBI  issuing  draft \nguidelines for CDS in 2007. However, with the role of these credit derivatives coming under the \nspotlight  in  the  recent financial  crisis the  issuance  of the final guidelines  has  been  postponed. \nThe  current  proposal  envisages  the  introduction  of  plain  over-the-counter  (OTC)  single-name \nCDSs for corporate bonds for resident entities subject to appropriate safeguards. \n\nFinally,  the  RBI  has  set  up  a  Financial  Stability  Unit  to  look  into  issues  relating  to  financial \nstability. The unit is entrusted with conducting macro-prudential surveillance and stress tests, to \ngauge the strength of the financial sector.  \n\n5.  IMPACT OF THE BASEL III NORMS ON THE INDIAN \n\nBANKING SYSTEM \n\nThe  Basel  III  guidelines  aim  to  improve  the  banking  sector\u2019s  ability  to  endure  long  periods  of \neconomic  and financial  stress  by  laying  down  more  rigorous  and stringent  capital  and  liquidity \nrequirements  for  them.  The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  (BCBS)  published  its \nlatest  recommendations  on  bank  solvency  and  liquidity  in  December  2010  and  January  2011.  \nThe  new  regulations  are  aimed  at  enhancing  the  quality,  consistency  and  transparency  of  the \ncapital  base  and  strengthening  the  risk  coverage  of  the  capital  framework.  These  regulations \nincrease the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement. The Tier 1 capital ratio will be set at 4.5% in \n2013,  increasing  to  5.5%  in  2014  and  6%  in  2015.  The  minimum  Tier  1  common  equity \nrequirement  is  also  set  to  be  increased  to  4.5%  from  2%  incrementally.  The  regulations  also \nintroduce  a  new  capital  conservation  buffer  of  2.5%,  which  will  be  used  to  withstand  losses \nduring  periods  of  stress.  This  buffer  needs  to  be  met  exclusively  with  common  equity.  Banks \nthat do not maintain such buffers will face restrictions on share buybacks, payment of dividends \nand  bonuses. In  addition,  a  countercyclical  buffer,  within  the  range  of  0%  to 2.5%  of  common \nequity  or  other  fully  loss  absorbing  capital  will  be  implemented  according  to  national \ncircumstances.  \n\nThe new guidelines also prescribe changes for the way deductions are made while calculating \nthe capital adequacy percentages and this is likely to have an impact on Indian banks. One of \nthe  proposed  guideline  is  to  make  the  deductions  deductible  only  if  they  exceed  15%  of  core \ncapital  at  an  aggregate  level  or  10%  at  an  individual  level.  This  is  unlikely  to  have  a  major \nimpact  on  Indian  banks  because,  according  to  existing  RBI  guidelines,  all  deductibles  are \ndeducted.  Moreover,  Indian  banks  do  not  have  re-securitization  exposures  and  small  trading \nbooks. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nThe new guidelines require 100% deduction from core capital, which is stricter than the existing \nRBI  guidelines  that  require  50%  deduction  from  Tier  I  capital  and  50%  from  Tier  II  capital, \nexcept  in  cases  of  intangible  assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  wherein  100%  deduction  is  done \nfrom Tier I capital. Similarly, the new guidelines have a stricter definition of significant interest. \nUnder  the  proposed  guidelines,  any  investment  exceeding  10%  of  issued  share  capital  is \ntreated as significant investment and deducted. In contrast, in the Indian context investments up \nto  30%  of  issued  share  capital  RBI  carry  125%  risk  weight  or  risk  weight  as  warranted  by \nexternal ratings while in the case of investments between 30% and 50% of issued share capital, \nthere is a 50% deduction from Tier I and 50% deduction from Tier II capital.  \n\nThe  current  crisis  demonstrated  the  need  for  banks  to  build  capital  buffers  during  periods  of \neconomic  growth.  This  allows  banks  to  absorb  losses  with  these  buffers  during  periods  of \neconomic  contraction.  A  way  to  offset  the  contraction  of  the  buffer  is  to  restrict  discretionary \npayments  such  as  dividends  and  bonuses  to  shareholders,  employees,  and  other  capital \nproviders. However, during the current crisis, several banks continued to make these payments \ndespite  deteriorating  financial  conditions  and  declining  capital  levels.  To  address  the  need  to \nmaintain a buffer to absorb losses and restrict banks from making inappropriate distributions in \nthe face  of  declining capital,  the  BCBS  proposed  the  creation  of  a  new  buffer  of  2.5%  of risk-\nweighted  assets  over  and  above  the  minimum  core  capital  requirement  of  4.5%.  This  buffer \nmust be held in tangible common equity capital. This would effectively mean that new minimum \ncapital requirements increase to 7%. The banks would be able to dip into the proposed capital \nbuffer  during  stress  periods  to  adhere  to  the  minimum  requirement  on  core  capital.  Moreover, \nonce  this  buffer  was  accessed,  certain  triggers  would  likewise  be  activated,  conserving  the \ninternally  generated  capital.  The  bank  would  also  be  held  back  from  making  discretionary \npayments such as dividends and bonuses.  \n\nA  major  factor  that  exacerbated  the  impact  of  the  crisis  was  the  inherent  procyclicality  of  the \nbanking sector. To mitigate  such  procyclicality,  the  BCBS  committee  suggested  establishing  a \ncountercyclical  buffer.  This  would  be  made  up  of  equity  or  fully  loss-absorbing  capital.  The \ncountercyclical buffer could be fixed by the relevant national authorities once a year and could \nrange  from  0%  to  2.5%  of  risk-weighted  assets.  The  exact  amount  of  the  buffer  could  be  set \naccording  to  changes  in  the  credit-to-GDP  ratio.  This  buffer  would  protect  the  banking  sector \nfrom system-wide risks that could arise out of excessive aggregate credit growth. Hence, during \ngood  times there  will  be  a  pro-cyclical  buildup  of  the  buffer. With  a  rise  in  credit growth, there \nwill be a requirement to build up a higher countercyclical buffer. While banks would be capable \nat  the  time  to  comply  with  the  additional  requirement,  the  requirement  could  be  immediately \nreduced during periods of stress.  \n\nThe  adoption  of  Basel  III  norms  significantly  increase  the  regulatory  capital  requirement  of \nIndian  banks.  Furthermore,  within  capital,  the  proportion  of  the  more  expensive  core  capital \ncould increase. According to the proposed norms, the minimum core capital requirement is set \nto be raised to 4.5%. In addition, the introduction of the conservation and countercyclical buffer \nmeans that the capital requirement would increase to between 7% and 9.5%. Indian banks, as \nper  the  current  norms  are  required  to  maintain  Tier  I  capital  of  at  least  6%.  However,  since \ninnovative perpetual debt and perpetual non-cumulative preference shares cannot exceed 40% \nof the 6% Tier I capital, the minimum core capital is 3.6% (i.e., 60% of 6%).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nGiven  that  most  Indian  banks  are  capitalized  well  beyond  the  stipulated  norms,  they  may  not \n However, there are differences among \nneed substantial capital to meet the new stricter norms.6\nvarious banks. While core capital in most of the private sector banks and foreign banks exceeds \n9%,  there  are  some  public  sector  banks  that  fall  short  of  this  benchmark.  These  public  sector \nbanks,  which  account for  more  than  70%  of  the assets  in  the  banking  sector  and  are  a major \nsource  of  funding  for  the  productive  sectors,  are  likely  to  face  some  constraints  due  to  the \nimplementation of the Basel III norms. These banks are also unable to freely raise capital from \nthe  market  as  the  government  has  a  policy  of  maintaining  at  least  51%  stake  in  these  banks. \nCurrently, there are only six banks where the government stake is higher than 70%. The other \noption is for the government to infuse capital to these banks to augment their core capital.  \n\nMoreover, a rise in risk-weighted assets as well as the proposed disqualification of some non-\ncommon  Tier  I  and  Tier  II  capital  instruments  for  inclusion  under  regulatory  capital  would \nincrease the requirement of additional capital. According to ICRA (2010), if risk-weighted assets \nwere to grow at an annualized rate of 20%, there would be a requirement of additional capital by \nthe banking sector (excluding foreign banks) of about Rs 6000 billion as a whole over the next \nnine years, ending on 31 March 2019. Of this, public sector banks would require about 75\u201380% \nof this additional capital and private Indian banks accounting for the rest. \n\n                                                \n6 As of 30 June 2010, the aggregate capital to risk weighted assets ratio of the Indian banking system stood at 13.4% \n\nof which Tier I capital constituted 9.3%. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nTable 6: Capitalization Profile of Key Indian Banks as of 31 March 2010 \n\n \nAllahabad Bank \nAndhra Bank \nBank of Baroda  \nBank of India (Consolidated) \nBank of Maharashtra  \nCanara Bank \nCentral Bank of India \nCorporation Bank \nDena Bank \nIDBI Bank \nIndian Bank \nIndian Overseas Bank  \nOriental Bank of Commerce \nPunjab National bank  \nPunjab & Sind Bank \nState Bank of India - Group \nSyndicate Bank \nUCO Bank \nUnion Bank \nUnited Bank \nVijaya Bank \nPublic Sector Banks \n  \nAxis Bank \nFederal Bank \nHDFC Bank \nICICI Group \nIndusind  \nING Vysya Bank  \nJammu & Kashmir Bank \nKotak Group \nSouth Indian Bank  \nYes Bank \nPrivate Banks \n  \nBarclays Bank \nCitibank - Group  \nDeutsche Bank \nHSBC Bank \nRBS  \nStandard Chartered Bank  \nForeign Banks \nScheduled Commercial Banks \n\nSource: ICRA (2010). \n\nTier I \n8.1% \n8.2% \n9.2% \n8.6% \n6.4% \n8.5% \n6.8% \n9.3% \n8.2% \n6.4% \n11.1% \n8.7% \n9.3% \n9.1% \n7.7% \n9.3% \n8.2% \n7.1% \n7.9% \n8.2% \n7.7% \n8.6% \n \n11.2% \n16.9% \n13.3% \n12.9% \n9.7% \n10.1% \n12.8% \n17.3% \n12.4% \n12.9% \n12.9% \n \n16.6% \n17.3% \n16.5% \n16.6% \n7.9% \n8.9% \n13.9% \n10.0% \n\nCRAR \n13.6% \n13.9% \n14.4% \n13.0% \n12.8% \n13.4% \n12.2% \n15.4% \n12.8% \n11.5% \n12.7% \n14.8% \n12.5% \n14.2% \n13.1% \n13.5% \n12.7% \n13.2% \n12.5% \n12.8% \n12.5% \n13.4% \n \n15.8% \n18.4% \n17.4% \n19.2% \n15.3% \n14.9% \n15.9% \n19.3% \n15.4% \n20.6% \n17.9% \n \n17.1% \n17.9% \n17.2% \n18.0% \n12.5% \n12.4% \n15.8% \n14.5% \n\nGOI \nShare \n55.2% \n51.6% \n53.8% \n64.5% \n76.8% \n73.2% \n80.2% \n57.2% \n51.2% \n52.7% \n80.0% \n61.2% \n51.1% \n57.8% \n100.0% \n59.4% \n66.5% \n63.6% \n55.4% \n84.2% \n53.9% \n \n \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n.. \n \n\nTier II \n5.5% \n5.8% \n5.2% \n4.4% \n6.4% \n4.9% \n5.4% \n6.1% \n4.6% \n5.1% \n1.6% \n6.1% \n3.3% \n5.0% \n5.4% \n4.2% \n4.5% \n6.2% \n4.6% \n4.6% \n4.8% \n4.8% \n \n4.6% \n1.4% \n4.2% \n6.2% \n5.7% \n4.8% \n3.1% \n2.0% \n3.0% \n7.8% \n5.1% \n \n0.5% \n0.6% \n0.7% \n1.4% \n4.6% \n3.5% \n1.9% \n4.6% \n\nCore Tier I \n7.7% \n7.8% \n8.4% \n7.5% \n5.6% \n8.0% \n4.7% \n8.2% \n7.3% \n4.4% \n10.5% \n7.7% \n8.6% \n8.0% \n7.1% \n8.6% \n7.2% \n4.9% \n7.1% \n6.9% \n6.4% \n7.7% \n \n10.9% \n16.9% \n13.1% \n12.1% \n9.7% \n9.6% \n12.8% \n17.3% \n12.4% \n11.8% \n12.4% \n \n16.6% \n17.3% \n16.5% \n16.6% \n6.7% \n8.9% \n13.8% \n9.2% \n\n \n\nWhile the concept of a countercyclical buffer is intuitively appealing, operationalizing it has many \nchallenges. These include defining a business cycle in a global setting although business cycles \nare  not  globally  synchronized,  identifying  an  inflection  point  in  the  business  cycle  to  indicate \nwhen  to  initiate  building  up  the  buffer,  choosing  the  appropriate  indicator  that  identifies  both \ngood and bad times, determining the right size of the buffer, etc. Given the different stages of \nfinancial  sector  development  in  different  countries  there  will  be  a  need  to  allow  national \ndiscretion  in  applying  the framework. In  India there  is  also  a  concern about the  variable  (most \nlikely the credit-to-GDP ratio) will be used to calibrate the countercyclical buffer. However, this \nmay  not  be  the  most  appropriate  variable  candidate  for  India  (Subbarao  2010).  Unlike  in \nadvanced  countries,  in  India  and  other  developing  economies,  the  credit-to-GDP  ratio  is  a \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nvolatile  variable  and  is  likely  to  go  up  for  structural  reasons  like  enhanced  financial \nintermediation  owing  to  high  growth  or  efforts  of  deeper  financial  inclusion.  Moreover,  while \ncredit  growth  can  be  a  good  indicator  of  the  build  up  phase,  credit  contraction  tends  to  be  a \nlagging indicator of emerging pressures in the system.  \n\nDuring  the  global  financial  crisis,  several  banks  found  it  difficult  to  maintain  adequate  liquidity \nand  central  banks  had  to  pump  in  liquidity.  The  crisis  also  demonstrated  that  severe  liquidity \nrisks can crystallize quickly and may be associated with the disappearance of certain sources of \nfunding.  In  this  context,  Basel  III  attempts  to  increase  the  resilience  of  internationally  active \nbanks  to  liquidity  stresses  and  has  developed  two  internationally  consistent  regulatory \nstandards to supervise liquidity risk.  \n\nThe first is the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which requires banks to maintain a stock of high \nquality  liquid  assets  that  is  sufficient  to  cover  net  cash  outflows  for  a  30-day  period  under  a \nstress scenario. The LCR is defined as  \n\n \n\nand, according to the Basel III norms this ratio should be greater than 100%. This will come into \neffect in 2015. Initially, \u201chigh-quality assets\u201d were defined extremely conservatively and included \ncash,  central  bank  reserves,  and  sovereign  debt.  However,  subsequently  the  definition  was \nwidened  to  include GSE  obligations  and  non-financial  corporate  and  covered  bonds  rated  AA- \nor  above.  However,  these  cannot  comprise  more  than  40%  of  high  quality  liquid  assets.  Net \ncash  outflows  are  defined  as  cumulative  expected  cash  outflows  minus  cumulative  expected \ncash inflows arising in the specified stress scenario in the time period under consideration. Net \ncash  flow  is  calculated  by  applying  run-off  rates  to  different  sources  of  funding.  A  run-off  rate \nreflects  the  amount  of  funding  maturing  in  the  30-day  window  that  will  not  roll  over.  Various \nsources of funding are associated with different run off rates.  \n\nThe LCR should be complemented with the net stable funding ratio (NFSR) of 100% or more. \nThis  is meant to  provide  incentive  to  banks  to  seek  more  stable forms  of funding. The  ratio  is \ndefined as \n\n \n\nWhile  available  stable  funding  is  a  weighted  average  of  liabilities,  in  which  stable  sources  of \nfunding  such  as  insured  retail  deposits  and  capital  have  high  weights  and  volatile  funding  like \nshort-term  wholesale  borrowings  have  lower  weights,  required  stable  funding  is  a  weighted \naverage  of  assets  where  liquid  assets  like  cash  and  government  bonds  and  risky-private \nsecurities have high weights. \n\nAfter an observation period that began in 2011, the LCR will be introduced on 1 January 2015, \nand the revised NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018. Currently, as per \nRBI  guidelines,  banks  have  adopted  a  granular  approach  towards  measurement  of  risk  by \nlooking at the cumulative mismatches over different time periods. The net cumulative negative \nmismatches  during  the  next  day,  2\u20137  days,  8\u201314  days,  and  15\u201328  days  buckets  should  not \nexceed 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets.  \n\nThe primary challenge for India will be to develop the capability to collect accurate and relevant \ndata granularly. Given that Indian financial markets were not subject to the same stress level as \nmarkets  in  advanced  countries,  predicting  the  appropriate  stress  scenario  will  be  a  tough  call. \nHowever, at the same time, most Indian banks follow a retail business model whereby there is \nlimited  dependence  on  short-term  or  overnight  funding.  Furthermore,  Indian  banks  possess  a \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nlarge amount of liquid assets that will enable them to meet new standards. From the Indian point \nof view, a key issue is the extent to which SLR holdings should be considered in the estimation \nof the liquidity ratios. On the one hand, while there is a case for these to be excluded as they \nare expected to be maintained on a regular basis; however, it would also be reasonable to treat \nat  least  a  part  of  the  SLR  holdings  in  calculating  the  liquidity  ratio  under  stressed  conditions, \nespecially since these are government bonds against which the RBI provides liquidity. \n\nThe  recent  crisis  also  brought  into  focus  the  flaws  of  the  incentive  system  adopted  in  some \nadvanced  countries  regarding  the  compensation  structure  of  key  personnel.  While  the \nperformance-based incentive system was devised to acquire and retain talent, it resulted in too \nmuch  emphasis  being  given  to  short-term  profits  and  compromising  long-term  interests.  The \nBCBS  proposes  to  increase  the  variable  pay,  aligning  it  with  long-term  value  creation.  In \naddition,  the  BCBS  also  proposes  to  institute  deferral  and  claw-back  clauses  to  offset  future \nlosses created by executives.  \n\nIn  India,  more  than  70%  of  the  banking  sector  is  dominated  by  public  sector  banks,  where \ncompensation  is  determined  by  the  government  with  the  variable  component  limited. \nFurthermore,  private  and  foreign  banks  are  statutorily  required  to  obtain  the  RBI\u2019s  regulatory \napproval for remuneration of their whole-time directors and chief executive officers. Recently, in \na  move  to  join  the  global  initiative  on  compensation  structures  and  align  Indian  compensation \nstructures  to  Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  guidelines,  RBI  issued  draft  guidelines  on \nto  ensure  effective \ncompensation  of  high-level  executives.  These  guidelines  attempt \ngovernance  of  compensation,  align  compensation  with  prudent  risk  taking,  and  improve \nsupervisory oversight of compensation. However, the Indian banking system is currently facing \na different predicament. With the majority of the banking sector also a part of the public sector, \nideally  one  would  like  to  attract  the  best  talent  into  this  sector.  However,  there  is  a  disparity \nbetween  the  compensation  packages  of  public  and  private  sector  bank  executives,  the  former \nreceiving significantly less valuable packages. This disparity should be rectified as it is leading \nto a loss of talent from the public sector to private sector. \n\nThe primary objectives of the Basel reforms are to ensure the reduction of incidence, severity, \nand costs of financial crises and the associated output loss. However, the proposals enshrined \nin the reform package will be associated with some macroeconomic costs. These include a rise \nin lending rates as well as a drop in the overall quantum of lending. According to BCBS (2010), \na one percentage point increase in the capital ratio raises loan spreads by 13 basis points, and \na  median  0.09%  decline  in  output.  Furthermore,  the  additional  cost  of  meeting  the  liquidity \nstandard amounts to around 25 basis points in lending spreads when risk-weighted assets are \nleft unchanged. However, the lending spreads drop to 14 basis points or less after considering \nthe fall in risk-weighted assets and the corresponding lower regulatory capital needs associated \nwith the higher holdings of low-risk assets. The median decline in output as a result of meeting a \nhigher liquidity requirement is in the order of 0.08%.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSION \n\nDespite  limited  exposure  to  subprime  assets  and  toxic  assets  that  were  at  the  heart  of  the \nfinancial  crisis,  the  Indian  financial  sector  was  affected  by  the  financial  turmoil  due  to  India\u2019s \nincreased  integration  with  global  capital  markets.  The  global  crisis  resulted  in  significant \ntightening  in  the  market,  equity,  foreign  exchange,  and  credit  markets.  The  crisis  was  also \ntransmitted  to  the  real  sector  as  output,  employment,  and  capital  formation  were  adversely \naffected.  In  particular,  the  SME  sector  was  negatively  impacted  from  a  fall  in  demand  and \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nreduced  access  to  credit.  This  led  to  a  sharp  drop  in  employment  in  some  select  sectors  like \nmetal, automobiles, and gems and jewelry.  \n\nIndian  policymakers  reacted  in  a  proactive  manner  and  introduced  a  host  of  measures  to \nassuage the impact of the crisis. These measures went far in mitigating the impact of the crisis \nand the economy started to exhibit signs of recovery from mid-2009. However, the recovery is \nnot uniform and several sectors as well as certain financial markets are yet to recover from the \ncrisis.  \n\nRegarding the Basel III norms, not all the reform measures are going to be a binding constraint \nfor India. While it is in a comfortable position to meet some of the proposed Basel III norms, the \nimplementation of some of the other norms would be a challenge.  \n\nWith  increasing  trade  and  financial  linkages,  almost  all  countries  are  susceptible  to  crises \noriginating  in  other  parts  of  the  world.  The  recent  financial  crisis  has  amply  shown  that \nmaintenance  of  financial  stability  requires  constant  vigilance  and  there  is  no  place  for \ncomplacency.  Moreover,  much  of  this  vigilance  must  be  done  in  good  times  to  detect  and \nnegate any incipient signs of instability.  \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 303 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n  Sen Gupta \n\nAkin, C., and M.

The  consequent \ntightening of liquidity and slump in global and domestic demand had a strong adverse affect \non the industrial sector, a large part of which includes small and medium-sized enterprises. \nThere  was  a  significant  decline  in  employment  and  output  in  some  of  these  enterprises. \nThough  Indian  policymakers  reacted  in  a  proactive  manner  and  introduced  a  host  of \nmeasures  to  counter  the  adverse  effects  of  the  financial  crisis,  the  recovery  has  not  been \nuniform;  several  markets  and  sectors  are  still  reeling  from  the  crisis\u2019  aftershocks.  The \nproposed  Basel  III  norms  are  going  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Indian  financial \nsector. While  it  is  in  a  comfortable  position  to meet  some  of the  proposed  Basel  III  norms, \nthe implementation of some of the other norms will be a challenge.  \n", "JEL Classification: F41, G15, O11 \n", " \n", " \n"]}
