The \ncurve then flattened between end-March and end-\nJuly as yields at the short-end rose and yields  in \nthe belly of the curve fell. During this period, yields \nfor  3-  and  6-month  tenors  rose  139  basis  points \n(bps)  and  143  bps,  respectively,  while  yields  for \n1-,  20-,  and  25-year  tenors  rose  83  bps,  3  bps, \nand 7 bps, respectively. Yields in the belly of the \ncurve fell between 61 bps and 117 bps from end-\nMarch  to  end-July.  Yield  spreads  between  2-  and \n10-year tenors narrowed to 250 bps in July from \n280 bps in March after a 90 bps drop in the 10-year \nyield. Overall, the Philippine yield curve flattened \nbetween end-December 2010 and end-July.\n\nConsumer  price  inflation  accelerated  in  2Q11, \nrising to 4.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in June from \n4.5%  in  May,  based  on  National  Statistics  Office \n(NSO) inflation series data from 2000. The NSO\u2019s \nmore  recent  2006-based  data  reflected  higher \ninflation  rates  in  both  June  (5.2%)  and  May \n(5.0%). Year-to-date inflation levels through June \nwere 4.3% using the 2000-based data and 4.7% \nusing the 2006-based data. Both rates fall within \nthe government\u2019s target range of 3%\u20135% for full-\nyear 2011. \n\nRising commodity prices have emerged as a threat \nto the price stability objective of the Bangko Sentral \nng Pilipinas (BSP), which has tried to contain the \nsecondary  effects  of  inflation  by  maintaining \na  relatively  hawkish  policy  stance.  BSP  raised \nboth of its policy rates 25 bps following Monetary \nBoard meetings in March and again in May. BSP\u2019s \novernight borrowing facility stands at 4.5%, while \nthe overnight lending facility is 6.5%. In its June  \nand July meetings, BSP kept its policy rates steady \nbut followed steps taken by its Asian counterparts \nin hiking the reserve requirement by 100 bps each. \nGiven the possibility that the current inflation trend \nmight exceed BSP\u2019s annual target, the central bank \n\n66\n\nFigure 1: Philippines\u2019 Benchmark Yield Curve\u2014\nLCY Government Bonds\n\nYield (%)\n\n10.0\n\n8.0\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\n\n24\n\n27\n\nTime to maturity (years)\n\n31-Jul-11\n\n31-Mar-11\n\n31-Dec-10\n\n31-Dec-09\n\nLCY = local currency.\nSource: Bloomberg LP.\n\nhas  said  it  will  remain  vigilant  for  any  potential \nbuild up of inflationary expectations and is ready \nto tighten monetary policy as needed. \n\nGross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  the \nPhilippines  fell  to  4.9%  y-o-y  in  1Q11  from \n6.1% in 4Q10, based on 2000 price levels.

The  country\u2019s  FCY  short-\nterm  debt  rating  of  a-2  was  also  affirmed.  R&I \nhighlighted the need to expand the revenue base \nand upgrade infrastructure conditions. Low public \nand  private  investment-to-GDP  ratios  and  high \n(albeit declining) levels of debt were also factored \ninto the ratings.\n\nOn  15  June,  Moody\u2019s  upgraded  the  FCY  and \nLCY  long-term  bond  ratings  on  debt  issued  by \nthe  government  to  Ba2,  or  two  notches  below \ninvestment grade, with a stable outlook for both. \nThe upgrade was the result of the (i) progress made \nin fiscal consolidation by the current administration \nand  (ii)  sustained  nature  of  macroeconomic \nstability on the back of a strong external payments \nposition and economic growth.  \n\nOn 23 June, Fitch Ratings upgraded the Philippines\u2019 \nlong-term  FCY  issuer  default  rating  to  BB+  from \nBB.  The  long-term  LCY  issuer  default  rating  and \nthe  country  ceiling  were  also  upgraded  to  BBB- \nfrom  BB+.  The  outlook  for  all  of  these  ratings \nis  stable.  The  short-term  FCY  rating  has  been \naffirmed at B. The rating agency took note of the \ngovernment\u2019s  progress  on  fiscal  consolidation, \nsustained  macroeconomic  stability  and  favorable \nprospects, and improving external finances. \n\nOn  29  July,  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  (S&P)  affirmed  its \nBB/B  (FCY)  and  BB+/B  (LCY)  sovereign  credit \nratings for the Philippines. The outlook for both is \nstable. The ratings reflect strong external liquidity \nand signs of improving growth prospects balanced \n\n\fagainst enduring fiscal weakness with high, albeit \nimproving, debt ratios. The stable outlooks reflect \nS&P\u2019s  expectation  that  remittances  will  continue \nto drive current account surpluses, while the weak \nfiscal profile will require more effort to address.\n\nTable 3: Selected Sovereign Ratings and Outlook for \nthe Philippines\n\nMoody's \n\nS&P\n\nFitch\n\nR&I\n\nFCY Long-Term Rating\n\nBa2\n\nBB\n\nBB+\n\nBBB-\n\nOutlook\n\nstable\n\nstable\n\nstable\n\nstable\n\nFCY = foreign currency.\nSource: Rating agencies.\n\nPolicy, Institutional, and \nRegulatory Developments\n\nGovernment Mulls New Global \nPeso Notes\n\nThe  Philippine  government  is  planning  to  issue \nGlobal  Peso  Notes  (GPNs)  and  dollar  bonds, \npossibly  in  September.

GPNs \nare PHP-denominated bonds that are sold offshore \nand  payable  in  US  dollars  to  investors.  GPNs  are \ntax-exempt.  Principal  and  interest  are  converted \ninto  US  dollars  for  payment.  The  US$  equivalent \nis  calculated  based  on  the  prevailing  PHP\u2013US$ \nexchange  rate  on  interest  and  principal  payment \ndates.  Under  this  scenario,  investors  bear  the \ncurrency  risk.

The \nstatutory  reserves  of  universal  and  commercial \nbanks  increased  from  9%  to  10%.  Including  a \nliquidity  reserve  requirement  of  11%,  the  latest \nadjustment raised the total level of required reserves \nto 21% from 20%. The reserve requirement hike \nwas  a  preemptive  move  to  counter  inflationary \npressures  arising  from  excess  liquidity  driven  by \nstrong capital inflows given the favorable outlook \nfor  the  Philippine  economy.  BSP,  however,  stated \nthat inflation risks were still present and it remains \nready  to  implement  measures  to  ensure  price \nstability.\n\nBTR Conducts Another Domestic \nDebt Swap\n\nOn  13  July,  the  Bureau  of  the  Treasury  (BTR) \ncompleted  its  sixth  domestic  bond  exchange \nprogram since 2006. The latest exchange received \nthe  highest  level  of  participation  to  date,  with \nPHP299.4  billion  worth  of  bonds  being  offered  in \nexchange  for  new  10.5-  and  20-year  bonds.  On \n19  July,  BTR  issued  PHP67.6  billion  of  10.5-year \nand  PHP255.8  billion  of  20-year  bonds\u2014a  total \nof  PHP323.4  billion  of  new  benchmark  bonds\u2014in \nexchange  for  eligible  bonds.  It  was  also  the  first \ntime  that  bonds  were  exchanged  for  20-year \nbonds.  The  10.5-year  bond  carries  a  coupon  of \n6.375%,  while  the  20-year  coupon  is  8.0%.  The \nlast  debt  swap  lengthened  the  average  maturity \nof government bonds outstanding by 2 years. The \nseries  of  debt  exchanges  have  resulted  in  fiscal \nconsolidation  and  a  lengthening  of  the  country\u2019s \ndebt  maturity  profile,  allowing  the  government \nmore  flexibility  in  spending  on  infrastructure, \nsocial services, and public works.\n\n71\n\n\fAsia Bond Monitor\n\nBSP Amends Meaning of Qualifying \nCapital Instruments\n\nBSP adopted the Basel III criteria for inclusion of \nnon-common equity components in banks\u2019 capital \nbase  when  determining  capital  instruments  that \ncan be counted as regulatory capital by Philippine \nbanks, effective 1 January 2011. Basel III states \nthat  the  majority  of  the  capital  base  must  be  in \nthe form of common equity elements and sets out \nminimum criteria for instruments to qualify in each \nof the sub-categories of capital. Instruments to be \nincluded as capital should not contain conditions \nthat give the issuing bank an incentive to redeem \nthe  instrument.  These  conditions  include  step-\nups  of  coupon  rates  on  a  call  or  maturity  date, \nrights  to  accelerate  the  repayment  of  future \nscheduled  payments  except  in  liquidation,  and \na  credit-sensitive  dividend  feature.  Repayment \nof  the  principal  of  capital  instruments  requires \nprior  supervisory  approval  and  banks  should \nnot  assume  or  create  market  expectations  that \nsupervisory  approval  will  be  given.  BSP  aims \nto  implement  other  Basel  III  guidelines  prior  to \nearlier  2015\u2014the  year  set  by  the  international \ncommittee for compliance. \n\n72\n\n\f", "author_pages": [")\n6\n.\n4\n(\n", ")\n8\n.\n2\n3\n(\n", "1\n.\n0\n", ")\n6\n.\n3\n(\n", ")\n2\n.\n4\n2\n(\n", ")\n0\n.\n1\n3\n(\n", "9\n", "6\n.\n0\n", "0\n.\n0\n", "0\n.\n0\n", "0\n.\n0\n", "0\n.\n0\n", "0\n.\n5\n", "1\n.\n3\n", "0\n.\n3\n", "0\n.\n6\n", "4\n.\n5\n", "6\n.\n4\n", "2\n.\n7\n1\n", ")\n7\n.\n2\n(\n", ")\n7\n.\n9\n(\n", "6\n.\n3\n", "9\n.\n0\n1\n", " \n", "9\n.\n1\n", "8\n.\n1\n", "2\n.\n2\n", "0\n.\n0\n", "6\n.\n2\n", " \n", "6\n.\n0\n", ")\n2\n.\n0\n(\n", "5\n.\n1\n", ")\n7\n.\n2\n(\n", " \n", ")\n1\n.\n5\n(\n", ")\n7\n.\n0\n(\n", ")\n1\n.\n2\n(\n", "7\n.\n5\n", "5\n.\n4\n", "5\n.\n3\n", "8\n.\n4\n1\n", ")\n7\n.\n6\n(\n", "5\n.\n9\n", " \n", "7\n.\n0\n1\n", " \n", "4\n.\n4\n1\n", "5\n7\n", "5\n6\n", "4\n5\n", "3\n", "0\n1\n", " \n", "7\n5\n2\n,\n3\n", "0\n4\n8\n,\n2\n", "1\n8\n3\n", "0\n4\n3\n,\n2\n", "9\n1\n1\n", " \n", "7\n1\n4\n", "5\n7\n", "5\n6\n", "9\n", "4\n5\n", "3\n", "9\n", " \n", "2\n2\n2\n,\n3\n", "5\n2\n8\n,\n2\n", "5\n8\n3\n", "0\n2\n3\n,\n2\n", "9\n1\n1\n", " \n", "7\n9\n3\n", "4\n7\n", "5\n6\n", "9\n", "3\n5\n", "3\n", "9\n", " \n", "1\n6\n1\n,\n3\n", "4\n7\n7\n,\n2\n", "5\n8\n3\n", "9\n6\n2\n,\n2\n", "9\n1\n1\n", " \n", "7\n8\n3\n", "3\n7\n", "4\n6\n", "9\n", "2\n5\n", "3\n", "9\n", " \n", ")\n", "%\n", " \n", "(\n \ne\nt\na\nR\nh\nt\nw\no\nr\nG\n", ")\nn\no\n", "i\nl\nl\ni\n", "b\n(\n \nt\nn\nu\no\nm\nA\n", "m\n-\no\n-\nm\n", "q\n-\no\n-\nq\n", "y\n-\no\n-\ny\n", "m\n-\no\n-\nm\n", "m\n-\no\n-\nm\n", "q\n-\no\n-\nq\n", "y\n-\no\n-\ny\n", "$\nS\nU\n", "P\nH\nP\n", "$\nS\nU\n", "P\nH\nP\n", "$\nS\nU\n", "P\nH\nP\n", "$\nS\nU\n", "P\nH\nP\n", "1\n1\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n", "1\n1\n-\ny\na\nM\n", "1\n1\n-\nr\np\nA\n", "1\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n", "1\n1\n-\nn\nu\nJ\n", "1\n1\n-\ny\na\nM\n", "1\n1\n-\nr\np\nA\n", "1\n1\n-\nr\na\nM\n", "0\n6\n1\n,\n3\n", "8\n5\n7\n,\n2\n", "0\n0\n4\n", "2\n2\n1\n", " \n", "2\n0\n4\n", "s\nl\nl\ni\n", "B\n \ny\nr\nu\ns\na\ne\nr\nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "t\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\nG\n", " \n \n \n", "l\n", "a\nt\no\nT\n", " \n", " \n", "e\nt\na\nr\no\np\nr\no\nC\n \n \n \n", " \n", "s\nr\ne\nh\nt\nO\n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", ":\ns\ne\nt\no\nN\n", "6\n3\n2\n,\n2\n", "s\nd\nn\no\nB\n \ny\nr\nu\ns\na\ne\nr\nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n", ".\nt\nn\ne\nm\ne\ng\na\nn\na\nM\n \ns\ne\ni\nt\ni\nl\ni\n", "i\n", "b\na\nL\n \nd\nn\na\n \ns\nt\ne\ns\ns\nA\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\nS\n \nr\ne\nw\no\nP\n \nd\nn\na\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\no\np\nr\no\nC\n \nr\ne\nw\no\nP\n \nl\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nN\n \ns\na\n \nh\nc\nu\ns\n \ns\nd\nn\no\nb\n \nd\ne\ne\nt\nn\na\nr\na\nu\ng\n-\nt\nn\ne\nm\nn\nr\ne\nv\no\ng\n \ns\ne\nd\nu\nl\nc\nn\ni\n \n\u201d\ns\nr\ne\nh\nt\nO\n\u201c\n \n.\n4\n", "l\n", ".\nP\nL\n \ng\nr\ne\nb\nm\no\no\nB\n \nd\nn\na\n \ny\nr\nu\ns\na\ne\nr\nT\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nu\na\ne\nr\nu\nB\n \ne\nn\np\np\n", "i\n", "i\nl\ni\n", "h\nP\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n", ".\nr\na\ne\ny\n-\nn\no\n-\nr\na\ne\ny\n \n=\n \ny\n-\no\n-\ny\n \n,\nr\ne\nt\nr\na\nu\nq\n-\nn\no\n-\nr\ne\nt\nr\na\nu\nq\n \n=\n \nq\n-\no\n-\nq\n \n,\nh\nt\nn\no\nm\n-\nn\no\n-\nh\nt\nn\no\nm\n=\nm\n-\no\n-\nm\n", " \n", " \n", " \n,\ny\nc\nn\ne\nr\nr\nu\nc\n \nl\na\nc\no\nl\n \n", "=\n \nY\nC\nL\n", ".\ns\nt\nc\ne\nf\nf\ne\n \ny\nc\nn\ne\nr\nr\nu\nc\n \ne\nd\nu\nl\nc\nn\ni\n \nt\no\nn\n \no\nd\n \nd\nn\na\n \ne\ns\na\nb\n \nY\nC\nL\n \nm\no\nr\nf\n \nd\ne\nt\na\nu\nc\nl\na\nc\n \ne\nr\na\n \ns\ne\nt\na\nr\n \nh\nt\nw\no\nr\nG\n", "l\n", " \n.\n3\n", ".\nd\ne\ns\nu\n \ne\nr\na\n \ns\ne\nt\na\nr\n \n$\nS\nU\n\u2013\nY\nC\nL\n \nd\no\ni\nr\ne\np\n-\nf\no\n-\nd\nn\ne\n \ng\nr\ne\nb\nm\no\no\nB\n \n.\n2\n", "l\n", " \n.\ns\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\ns\n \nl\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nn\n \nm\no\nr\nf\n \na\nt\na\nd\n \ng\nn\ni\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\na\nu\nc\nl\na\nC\n \n.\n1\n", "l\n", "s\ne\nn\np\np\n", "i\n", "i\nl\ni\n", "h\nP\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "i\n \nt\ne\nk\nr\na\nM\nd\nn\no\nB\nY\nC\nL\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\nn\no\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\nm\no\nC\nd\nn\na\n \ne\nz\ni\nS\n \n:\n1\n \ne\nl\nb\na\nT\n", " \n", "Market Summaries\u2014Philippines\n", "and 3.6% growth in treasury bonds and corporate \nbonds,  respectively.
