INTRODUCTION \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nSmall  businesses  or  micro-based  businesses  are  considered  one  of  best  potential \nplatforms  for  innovation,  productivity,  and  dynamism  that  support  many  economic \nsectors through employment creation, output expansion, export orientation, and income \nincreases  (Wong  and  Aspinwall  2004).  Furthermore,  these  businesses  are  also \ndominating various strategic business service subsectors, including services related to \ncomputer software and information processing, research and development, marketing, \nbusiness organization, and human resource development (OECD 2000). It is estimated \nthat  small  businesses  represent  about  95%  of  the  companies  providing  more  than  \n65% of the jobs as well as more than 50% of the gross domestic product globally (World \nTrade  Report  2016).  Hence, \nthese  businesses  occupy  a  prominent  position  \nin  the  development  agenda  and  essentially  become  a  part  of  the  overall  national \ndevelopment strategy in most countries (Abdullah 1999). Both developed and developing \ncountries acknowledge the role of small businesses as the primary contributors to the \ngrowth and development of an economy. \n\nDespite their potential importance for economic development, it is widely recognized that \nsmall  businesses  are  facing  difficulties  in  attracting  external  finance  at  the  early  and \nmiddle stages of the entrepreneurial lifecycle in many countries, including developed and \ndeveloping countries. According to the World Bank Report (2015), small businesses in \ndeveloping  countries  are  lacking  of  financial  support  to  reach  their  optimal  capacity. \nSome  empirical  studies  have  been  conducted  to  examine  the  small  businesses\u2019 \nchallenges  in  managing  external  finance  in  both  developed  and  developing  countries \nSome  of  these  challenges  are  related  to  collateral  condition,  legal  status,  transaction \ncost,  information  and  documentation,  financial  track  record,  nature  and  quality  of \nbusiness, and financing procedure and options (Hashim, 1999; Aris, 2006; Saleh and \nNdubisi  2006;  Abdullah  and  Manan  2010;  SME  Masterplan  2012\u20132020;  Thaker  et  al. \n2013;  Thaker  2015;  Duasa  and  Thaker  2016).  In  addition,  small  businesses  are \ncharacterized as high-risk businesses and take many years to generate returns to their \ninvestors.  In  addition,  lack  of  attraction  and  the  uncertainty  of  cash  flows  are  also \nbecoming  limitations  for  them  in  accessing  external  finance  (Block,  Colombo,  and \nCumming 2018). Due to such constraints, most formal investors, such as retail investors, \nangel investors, and sophisticated investors, are unwilling to make proper investments \nat the pre-seed stage and focus their attention on later-stage business ventures with a \nproven business model.  \n\nGiven the constraints of accessing traditional financial institutions by small businesses, \nThe  Addis  Ababa  Action  Agenda  that  initiated  Financing  for  Development  (2015) \nfinancial \nemphasized \nmechanisms without losing the spirit of businesses in developing countries. This action \nagenda  calls  for  innovate  financial  mechanisms  comprised  of  both  public  and  private \nresources termed as blended finance and joint venture to increase the flow of financing.  \n\nthe  significance  of \n\nfinancing  support \n\ninnovative \n\nthrough \n\nAccordingly,  the  Islamic  banking  and  finance  industry  is  a  broad  framework  that  \nhas  great  potential  for  supporting  development  finance  particularly  related  to  small \nbusiness,  given  their  fundamental  criteria  emphasizing  generating  positive  societal \nimpact.  It  has  achieved  remarkable  success  in  terms  of  steady  growth  and  product \ndiversification across the world. According to a report by the Islamic Financial Services \nBoard  (2018),  the  industry  has  experienced  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of \napproximately 17% over the past five years and managed approximately $1.87 trillion \nworth of total assets by the first half of 2014. To be more specific, Islamic banking alone \nexpanded by about 16% in 2013, whereas global banking (comprised of assets of the \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nworld\u2019s top 1,000 banks) grew by only 4.9% in 2012 and 0.6% in 2013 (Islamic Financial \nServices Board 2018). The two most notable features of Islamic banking and finance that \ncontribute to social and economic development via entrepreneurship are asset-backed \nfinancing and risk-sharing.  \n\nAccording  to  the  policy  paper  jointly  released  by  World  Bank  Group,  Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  and  the  G20  in  2015,  the  Islamic  financial  industry  should  be  \nasset-based  so  that  it  can  boost  real  economic  activity  that  will  be  directing  factors  \nof  production  to  the  growth  of  financed  assets  and  eliminating  the  stigma  of \n\"financialization\u201d  of  a  particular  economy.  Another  key  financial  mechanism  of  the \nindustry  is  that  it  is  based  on  equity  suitable  for  small  businesses  because  the \nentrepreneurs  can  share  profits  and  losses.  This  risk-sharing  mode  is  a  fundamental \nsupport  for  entrepreneurial  development,  particularly  small  business  entrepreneurs \nrelying on equity financing for their new ventures. \n\nIn  Malaysia,  a  number  of  institutions  participate  in  fostering  financing  accessibility, \nfocusing  on  SMEs  which  include  commercial  banks,  Islamic  banks,  merchant  or \ninvestment banks, and development finance institutions (Bank Negara Malaysia 2019). \nAccording to BNM, the total amount of RM2.17billions of total loans/financing disbursed \nrecorded by the entire participant banks as of November 2019. Meanwhile, in the last \nfive years, Indonesia\u2019s Shariah banks have seen its assets grow by 38% compared to \n15%  for  conventional  banks  (Bank  Indonesia).  The  sector  is  currently  dominated  by  \ntwo leading players, namely Bank Mandiri Syariah and Bank Muamalat, that count for \n50% of total Shariah financing between them (Global Business Guide-Indonesia 2011). \nIndonesia  appears  to  be  a  natural  growing  market  for  Shariah-compliant  banking \nservices, given the size of the Muslim majority population; however, the character of the \nmarket  is  starkly  different  from  that  of  neighboring  Malaysia  or  the  Middle  East.  \nThe majority of Indonesia\u2019s potential Islamic banking customers fall under the \u201crational \nmarket\u201d  as  opposed  to  that  of  the  \u201cspiritual  market\u201d.  Islamic  banking  products  are \ntherefore pitted against their conventional counterparts and judged on their commercial \nmerits  as  opposed  to  being  chosen  on  the  basis  of  faith.  Furthermore,  since  Islamic \nbanks in Indonesia are relatively new as they were established two decades ago, there \nis the domination of the conventional banks, which cover almost 70% of the industry.  \n\nConsidering  the  importance  of  small  businesses  and  the  scope  for  Islamic  financial \nservices, the present research aims to achieve the following objectives: \n\n(i)  to perform a landscape analysis of financing small businesses in selected Asian \n\ncountries particularly Malaysia and Indonesia;  \n\n(ii)  to identify and unpack innovative financing opportunities within Islamic banking \nand  finance  instruments,  such  as  Mudharabah  (profit-sharing),  Musharakah \n(profit-loss sharing), Murabahah (sale with cost plus profit margin, Ijarah [Islamic \nleasing]),  and  Salam  (forward sale) as  potential  solutions  for  addressing small \nbusinesses\u2019 funding gaps; and  \n\n(iii) to initiate the development of systematic principles for the utilization of Islamic \n\nbanking and finance instruments in financing small businesses. \n\n2.  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n2.1  Issues of Financing Small Businesses \n\nThe  extant  studies  have  shown  that  small  businesses  are  facing  the  most  common \nproblem,  which  is  financial  challenges.  In  general,  the  majority  of  the  studies  have \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nindicated the factors that prevent small business from access to external financing are \nstrict  collateral  requirements,  high  transaction  costs,  lack  of  response  from  financial \ninstitutions that consider the small business as a risky business, insufficient documents \nto support the loan application, and no financial track record. . \n\nIn  his  study,  Das  (2007)  claimed  that  Indian  small  businesses  have  for  decades \ncontinued to be hindered by constraints, particularly access to loan financing. According \nto him, the commercial banks were only interested in channeling funds to selected small \nbusinesses  after  they  were  instructed  by  The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  and  the \nMinistry  of  Finance \nthere  \nwere inadequate flows of funds, causing a specific bias against small loan portfolios that \ninterrupted the normal flow of finance to small firms. The two most responsible factors\u2014\ncollateral condition and the lack of transparency\u2014are identified as the main impediments \nto small businesses\u2019 receiving external financing.  \n\nso.  The  author  pointed  out \n\nto  do \n\nthat \n\nAris  (2006)  studied  various  challenges  of  external  finance  for  small  businesses  in \nMalaysia, which are lack of collateral, insufficient documents to support loan applications, \nno  financial  track  record,  the  nature  of  the  business,  and  long  loan  processing  time. \nThese factors causing them to rely much more on internal financing rather than external \nfinancing.  \n\nPirvu,  Giurca  Vasilescu,  and  Mehedintu  (2008)  revealed  a  number  of  challenges  \nof  micro  and  small  business  entrepreneurs  in  getting  finance  from  conventional \ncommercial  banks  in  Romania:  stringent  banking  and  legislative  environment, \nbureaucratic banking structures, an apathetic nature towards disbursing micro and small \ncredits, and the condition of creditworthiness.  \n\nGanbold  (2008)  found  that  external  financing  for  small  businesses  remained  a  major \nobstacle in Mongolia. He noticed that the large firms can easily access finance compared \nto small businesses. It restricted the latter from making capital investments and funding \ndaily operational activities, and the main causes were high interest rates, limited or no \naccess  to  long-term  credit,  collateral  constraints,  and  lack  of  market  research  and \nbusiness planning.  \n\nStephanou and Rodriguez (2008) examined the financial challenges of small businesses \nin Colombia, which include the lack of proper financing for smaller, industrial and younger \nfirms to develop or diversify their economic activities. The authors identified some other \nconstraints related to the rate of interest, loan maturity, collateral conditions, and lending \nprocess. \n\nRahman  (2010)  discussed  the  potential  constraints  faced  by  small  businesses  in \nBangladesh.  Among  them  was  financial  constraints.  In  Bangladesh,  the  small \nbusinesses  were  facing  difficulties  in  raising  fixed and  working  capital  because  of  the \nreluctance of banks to provide loans to small businesses. This reluctance was caused \nby the government policy that removed the interest rate subsidy, which led the financial \ninstitutions to provide less finance to small businesses. In addition, the author also found \nthat the high requirements for collateral and improper project planning also resulted in \nthe lack of access to finance for small businesses in Bangladesh.  \n\nHassan et al. (2010) described the various financial challenges of micro entrepreneurs \nin  Malaysia  and  observed  that  most  of  the  micro  entrepreneurs  experienced  extreme \nfinancial  difficulties  in  the  initial  stage  of  their  business.  Only  13%  of  the  micro \nentrepreneurs  received  financial  support  from  government-operated  programs.  In \naddition,  they  also  found  that  the  rigidity  of  the  procedures  for  accessing  financial \nprograms also prevented the smooth success of the programs. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nSubramaniam (2010) investigated the challenges faced by the youth in microenterprises \nin  Malaysia.  She  collected  primary  data  through  personal  interviews  conducted  with \nyoung people who operated microenterprises. The results revealed that lack of access \nto external financing was a major factor that led them to rely more on internal financing. \n\nIn another study on Thailand, Punyasvatsut (2011) illustrated that most of the financial \nsources of small businesses came from personal funds, such as borrowing from relatives \nand  friends,  and  only  30%  was  obtained  from  external  sources  such  as  banks.  In \naddition,  the  entrepreneurs  exhibit  overdrafts  as  a  backdoor  means  of  fulfilling  the \nworking capital requirement of the bank for obtaining loans. It is estimated that only 40% \nof  small  Thai  firms  received  formal  credit  while  the  rest  were  excluded  from  formal \nfinancial services. The author mentioned a number of obstacles related to financing that \narose  from  both  entrepreneurs  and  financial  institutions.  Regarding  the  financial \ninstitutions,  SME  entrepreneurs  claimed  to  have  inadequate  information,  insufficient \nadvice from financial institutions, as well as complex and cumbersome loan application \nprocesses,  whereas  the  entrepreneurs  were  observed  to  have  constraints  related  to \ncollateral, business experience, business plans, loan history, and transaction costs that \nprevented them from accessing finance. \n\nKyophilavong  (2011)  examined  the  financial  constraints  of  small  businesses  in  the  \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and identified that all entrepreneurs of SMEs more or \nless  experienced  critical  problems  in  accessing  required  finance  at  the  early  stage  of \ntheir businesses. The author explored a gap between small businesses with no financial \nconstraints  and  those  with  financial  constraints  and  showed  that  the  latter  performed \nrelatively poorly. It is notable that the domestic firms with sound capital and established \nbusiness  enjoyed  higher  access  to  finance.  Moreover,  about  20%  of  the  198  small \nbusinesses  could  access  finance  while  roughly  80%  of  the  entrepreneurs  were \ndissatisfied with the existing terms and conditions of the financial institutions, and most \nof them had common complaints about the institutions\u2019 collateral conditions, lengthy and \ncomplex application processes, and insufficient information.  \n\nUng  and  Hay  (2011)  focused  on  the  various  financial  challenges  faced  by  small \nbusinesses  in  Cambodia.  They  revealed  that  based  on  the  survey  of  180  randomly \nselected  firms  consisting  of  156  micro  and  24  small  enterprises,  the  businesses  with \nlarger sales and higher profits had easy access finance while the small entrepreneurs \nwere kept mostly out of the financing mechanism because of nonfulfillment of collateral \nconditions. Furthermore, the authors identified a few other negative factors responsible \nfor financial inaccessibility, such as loan amount, interest rate, and repayment periods. \nIt was suggested that unbiased lending principles of financial institutions can support the \nexpansion of micro-sized firms in Cambodia.  \n\nThanh  et  al.  (2011)  investigated  the  factors  responsible  for  slow  development  of  \nsmall  businesses  in  Viet  Nam,  especially  in  the  textiles  and  garment,  electrical  and \nelectronics,  and  automotive  components  manufacturing  industries.  The  authors  found \nthat  capital  inadequacy  was  one  of  the  major  obstacles  to  the  development  of  small \nbusinesses. Similar to many other studies as outlined above, the authors also indicated \na  number  of  constraints  related  to  accessing  finance  by  the  entrepreneurs  of  small \nbusinesses such as collateral, age of the enterprise, businesses experience, small size, \nand production networks.  \n\nMachmud  and  Huda  (2011)  explored  the  important  characteristics  and  financial \nchallenges  of  small  businesses  in  Indonesia  and  claimed  that  nearly  56%  of  small \nbusiness owners have external financial access, whereas the rest of them rely on internal \nfinancial sources such as their own savings and retained earnings. They claimed a major \ncosts  \nchallenge \n\ntheir  entrepreneurial  development  was \n\nrising \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nof  business.  The  authors  also  identified  three  key  causes  of  unsuccessful  loan \napplications which were related to: (i) business plan; (ii) sales, revenue, and cash-flows; \nand (iii) credit history. \n\nAldaba (2010) highlighted the difficulties faced by small businesses in accessing finance \nin  the  Philippines.  The  author  surveyed  a  total  of  97  firms  in  the  textiles,  garments, \nelectrical  and  electronics,  automotive,  and  food  manufacturing  industries.  The  author \nfound that financial challenges were one of the most important ones that restricted the \ngrowth of small businesses. In most cases, small business entrepreneurs manage their \nstart-up  capital  by  using  internal  sources,  and  the  rest  of  the  capital  comes  from  the \nbanks.  \n\nIn his study, Tambunan (2011) critically examined the constraints of small businesses in \nIndonesia. By using secondary data of small businesses, the author pointed out that lack \nof financing is one of the top constraints, followed by lack of marketing, innovation, and \nskilled  human  capital  resources.  The  study  claimed \ninstitutions  \nwere  mainly  responsible  for  the  limited  access  to  finance  by  small  businesses.  The \nauthor noticed that the weak financial market structure and lack of innovative financial \nproducts  and  competition  among  the  financial  institutions  were  the  main  causes  of \nsluggish supply of capital to small businesses.  \n\nfinancial \n\nthat \n\nIn their study, Hassan et al. (2011) argued that most of the micro enterprises in Malaysia \nwere restricted from access to external financing because of no collateral and insufficient \ndocuments to support their loan applications. The authors also noted that the financial \nproviders  were  reluctant  to  increase  the  initial  loans  due  to  the  risk  and  uncertainty \ninvolved  in  business.  Moreover,  it  was  observed  that  financial  institutions  offered \nrelatively smaller credit to micro or small farms, which actually failed to satisfy the real \nbusiness needs.  \n\nMeza (2012) examined the financial barriers to financial assistance by micro enterprises \nin  Malaysia  and  Cost  Rica  by  conducting \ninterviews  \nwith  micro  entrepreneurs.  The  author  found  that  public  banking  institutions  in  both \nMalaysia and Costa Rica failed to provide sufficient financing without collateral needed \nto  meet  the  financial  requirement  to  run  microenterprises.  As  a  result  of  this,  micro \nentrepreneurs most of the time depended on their own or informal sources of financing. \n\nin-depth  personal \n\n2.2  SME Policies in Malaysia \n\nThe  initiation  of  the  National  Economic  Plan  (1971)  of  Malaysia  provided  a  platform  \nfor  realizing  the  importance  of  SMEs,  particularly  in  achieving  the  goal  of  poverty \nalleviation and social welfare by eliminating economic imbalances among ethnic groups. \nThe NEP enabled the Bumiputera, Malaysians of indigenous Malay origin, to become \ninvolved  in  small  businesses  with  the  direct  and  indirect  assistance  of  government-\nsupported  programs.  A  number  of  plans  have  been  launched  so  far  to  support  the \ndevelopment  of  country\u2019s  SMEs,  such  as  the  Malaysia  Industrial  Plan  and  Small  and \nMedium  Corp  (SME  Corp.),  operated  under  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and \nIndustry (MITI), etc. (Ziaul, Che, and Said 2009).  \n\nDue to the changing nature of the economic and business environment, the NEP was \nreplaced by the National Development Policy (NDP) in 1992 (Menon 1999). The main \ngoal of the new NDP was to reduce the ethnic differences through several government \nagencies and organizations. This attempt was made mainly to impart necessary skills in \nentrepreneurship,  managerial  capability,  and  technical know-how  to  the  Bumiputra.  In \n1996,  the  Small  and  Medium  Industries  Development  Corporation  (SMIDEC)  was \nestablished  by  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry  (MITI)  to  upgrade  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nthe  SME  sector  to  comply  with  the  global  market.  To  do  so,  a  number  of  schemes  \nwere carried out, for instance, training to increase the capability and competitiveness of \nSMEs  via  easing  financial  accessibility,  capacity  building,  market  penetration,  brand \ndevelopment,  human  capital  development,  technology  and  innovation  enhancement, \nand advisory services.  \n\nAfterwards, a further initiative was taken by the government to uplift SMEs by creating \nthe National SME Development Council (NSDC) in 2004, which marked a new chapter \nin the history of SME development in Malaysia. The main objective of the NSDC was  \nto  take  various  policies  and  strategies  to  develop  SMEs,  covering  all  sectors  of  \nthe  economy.  It  was  aimed  at  making  sound  linkages  among  respective  ministries, \nconcerned agencies, and the private sector. The council used to provide many services \nin  this  regard  related  to  financing,  advising,  restructuring,  notifying,  training  and \nmarketing, coordinating, creating complete SME databases, and lastly, monitoring the \nSMEs (SME Corp. 2017). \n\n In 2009, SMIDEC was restructured and renamed as the Small and Medium Enterprise \nCorporation Malaysia (SME Corp. Malaysia). The SME Corporation used to provide all \ntypes of support, particularly sharing the latest information and advising services to the \nSME entrepreneurs through its One Referral Centre (ORC). This corporation has now \nbecome one of largest key contributors to the SME sector through its continuous support \nin making the industry innovative, resilient, and globally competitive.  \n\nSME  Corp.  Malaysia  was  also  entrusted  with  developing  and  implementing  the  SME \nMaster Plan 2012\u20132020, providing the policy direction for SME development in order to \nachieve high-income nation status by 2020. It is expected that this master plan will boost \nthe growth of SMEs with joint cooperation between the public and private sectors. The \ngovernment  in  its  2017 budget  has given  special  attention  to  the  SMEs  and  declared \n2017 as the start-up and SME promotion year. A sum of RM70 million was allocated for \nthe SME Master plan for the purpose of implementing the High Impact Programmes. In \nthis budget, the government also announced a reduction in the corporate tax rate from \n19% to 18% for the first RM500,000 for SMEs, and the relatively lower tax will be imposed \non  the  increased  revenue  (Goh  2011). In  the  budget,  RM350  million  was  allocated  to \nassisting  and supporting SMEs  in  accessing  foreign  markets,  of  which RM130  million \nwas allocated for promotional purposes to be carried out by SME Corp. Malaysia and \nMIDA MATRADE, and RM200 million was allocated for financing the SMEs sector where \nthe provision of insurance coverage up to RM1 billion was supported by the EXIM Bank. \nIn addition to this financial support, a 2% rebate amounting to RM20 million was allocated \nfor the scheme of \u201cSyarikat Jaminan Pembiayaan Perniagaan\u201d (SJPP). \n\nIn order to enhance the income of Bottom 40 (B40) households, RM290 was allocated \nto encourage the development of B40 entrepreneurs under various programs, such as \nthe Agropreneur program (RM100 million), the eUsahawan and eRezeki programs under \nMDEC (RM100 million), and the Mobileprenuer Programme (RM30 million). In addition, \na total of RM5,000 was distributed per taxi driver to buy new vehicles in cases where an \nindividual taxi permit\u2019s given worth was RM60 million. Moreover, as a part of financial \nsupport to Bumiputera entrepreneurs, a total of RM1.4 billion was allocated through a \nnumber  of  government  agencies,  including  Amanah  Ikhtiar  Malaysia  (RM100  million), \nTERAJU  (RM600  million),  TEKUN  (RM300  million),  MARA  (RM120  million),  PUNB \n(RM200  million),  and  SME  Bank  (RM100  million).  To  create  a  balance  among  ethnic \ngroups, the government also allocated a total RM200 million (to Indian entrepreneurs) \nand RM90 million (to Chinese entrepreneurs). Furthermore, a sum of RM2 billion was \ndistributed  to  the  women  entrepreneurs  via  Women  Career  Comeback  programs  I-\nKeuNita and I-KIT (Ministry of Finance Malaysia 2017). \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nApart  from  the  SME  scenario  in  Malaysia,  the  industry  is  becoming  a  significant \ncontributor to Asian economies. According to an estimation, SMEs industry represented \nabout  98%  of  all  the  enterprises  that  supported  on  average  almost  66%  of  the  total \nnational  labor  force  from  2007  to  2012  (Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh-Hesary  2016).  The \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has created a number of associations \nto  develop  and  spread  the  practice  of  SMEs,  including  the  ASEAN  SME  Agencies \nWorking  Group  (SMEWG)  and  SME  Development  (SAPSMED  2016\u20132025).  It  is \nexpected that these associations will play a significant role in rapidly transforming the \nSEMs in the region by 2025. The goal will be achieved by initiating an appropriate policy \nand  regulatory  environment,  providing  financial  support,  encouraging  innovation  and \nadoption of modern technology, access to local and international markets, and promoting \nprograms  to  develop  entrepreneurial  skills  and  human  capital  (SME  Annual  Report \n2017). \n\nThe ASEAN SME Agencies Working Group (SMEWG) took a number of steps, including \nthe  Digital  Economy  Action  Plan  and  Work  Agenda  (DEAP),  and  it  organized  various \nworkshops to ensure Internet accessibility among entrepreneurs so that they could share \ninformation and get solutions to the many challenges of doing business. It also enabled \nentrepreneurs to learn from the best practices of SMEs and raised the awareness level \non integrating businesses into regional and global markets. In this regard, an initiative \nwas taken by APEC in 2016 called \u201cNew Era of Growth for APEC SMEs through Online-\nto-Offline  (O2O)  Business  Models\u201d,  with  the  joint  cooperation  of  eBay,  Amazon,  and \nAlibaba to expand the opportunities of SME entrepreneurs in the global markets.  \n\n2.3  SME Policies in Indonesia \n\nIndonesia has the advantage of having the largest manpower in ASEAN countries, with \na  total  of  258.7  million  people  (ASEC  2016).  It  is  endowed  with  abundant  natural \nresources and substantial amounts of hidden metals and minerals, including gold, nickel, \ntin, copper, coal, oil, and gas reserves. The country is also one of the major suppliers of \nagricultural  commodities  such  as  palm  oil,  rubber,  and  grains.  It  is  located  in  a  very \nthe  world\u2019s  busiest  shipping  routes.  \nstrategic  position  where \nFor instance, almost 40% of the annual total global sea trading takes place by passing \nthrough  this  channel.  The  country  has  the  largest  economy  in  the  ASEAN  and  \nthe seventh largest GDP (PPP) globally, with $1,042.17 billion in 2018 (The World Bank \n2019).  \n\nit  has  one  of \n\nIn Indonesia, there are about 57.9 million enterprises, of which 99% (57.2 million) are \nconsidered  micro  enterprises,  and  these  micro  enterprises  created  89%  of  total \nemployment and contributed to 10% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016. In addition to these \nestimates, there are other forms of enterprises operating across the country, i.e., small \nenterprises  (0.645  million),  medium-sized  enterprises  (106),  and  large  enterprises \n(5,066). Despite its large population, with a relatively higher micro, small, and medium \nenterprise (MSME) density (about 22.1), Indonesia had a relatively lower number of large \nenterprises in comparison with Thailand (7,156) and Malaysia (13,813) in 2016 (OECD \n2018).  \n\nSME entrepreneurs in Indonesia are mostly agro-based, and it would be interesting to \nobserve  the  actual  numbers  of  micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises  (MSME)  by \nexcluding the agro-based sector. According to Badan Pusat Statistics (BPS) estimates, \nMSMEs contribute to 61% of GDP and create 87.8% of total employment, whereas micro \nenterprises alone contribute to 10% of GDP and58.4% to employment (BPS statistics, \n2015). The composition of MSMEs is mostly wholesale and retail businesses (46% of \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nnon-agro  based),  followed  by  the  manufacturing  sector  (17%)  and  hospitality  and \ncatering (17%).  \n\nIndonesia had to take a welfare-based approach in formulating SME policy to place more \nemphasis on equity than efficiency. This is because the country had to emerge from its \npast colonial sentiment to adopt modern nationalist and socialist views toward economic \ndevelopment after independence in 1949. Many other revolutionary policies were taken \nthe  national  economy  mainly  based  on  state-owned  capital  \nto \n(state-owned  enterprises),  and  the  SME  sector  was  promoted  by  including  the  ethnic \nunderprivileged and economically disadvantaged segments of the population (pribumi).  \n\nrebuild \n\nSuharto during his tenure as the president of Indonesia has initiated many approaches \nto reform the economy, popularly known as \u201cSuharto\u2019s New Order reforms of 1966.\u201d This \nreform also included the development of the SME sector under Indonesia\u2019s Competition \nLaw (Article 50). By virtue of the law, some protective polices enabled entrepreneurs of \nsmall-scale enterprises to sustain market competition. Another notable outcome of this \nlaw was that all large and medium enterprises were required to create partnerships with \nmicro and small enterprises in order to obtain government support. The present financing \nprogram of MSME (e.g., subsidy and mandatory lending schemes) was originally initiated \nand successfully implemented under the regime of Suharto. Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR), \none of the largest and most popular programs established to cater to SMEs\u2019 financial \nneeds,  allocated  approximately  $1.3  billion  during  the  period  2007\u20132014,  and  it  also \ndistributed  MSME  credit  worth  about  $13.4 billion.  The  country  achieved  dimension \nscore \nindicated  \nthat  financial  inclusion  was  still  a  long  way  from  achievement.  It  also  signified  the \nimportance of further strengthening the existing legal and institutional framework in order \nto extend the financial services through proper monitoring and evaluation of government \nand nongovernment schemes. \n\nwhich \n\n4.58, \n\nout \n\nof \n\n3 \n\nBank  Rakyat  Indonesia  (BRI),  one  of  the  largest  financial  contributors  to  MSME, \nconstituted about 63% of all its formal credit in 2014. Due to its early establishment and \nwider network in terms of branches across the country and particularly in rural areas, \nBRI  used  to  dominate  the  credit  market.  BRI  is  the  largest  recipient  of  Kredit  Usaha \nRakyat  (KUR).  In  an  estimation,  BRI  allocated  credit  that  was  65%  of  the  total  KUR \nprogram during the period 2009\u20132014 (OECD 2018). According to the World bank report, \nthe MSME loans constituted about 17% of total unsettled commercial bank loans in 2017. \nThe  country  had  launched  two  policy  tools  to  expedite  bank  lending  to  MSMEs:  i) \nexpansion of KUR by repayment assurance and an interest rate subsidy component in \n2015; and ii) a compulsory lending program in 2009 that directed commercial banks to \ndisburse loans (20% of total loan portfolio) to MSME by 2018. KUR kept the provision of \nguarantees, previously covering 70%\u201380% of the disbursed amount, which was normally \nnegotiated between the partner banks and the scheme, and an interest rate subsidy of \n9%, which capped the interest rates backed by KUR loans (OECD 2018). \n\n \n\n3.  THE PHILOSOPHY OF ISLAMIC BANKING  \n\nAND FINANCE \n\nPrinciples  and  practices  of  conventional  banking  and  finance  (based  primarily  on  the \nWestern worldview) may be inconsistent with  the Islamic worldview, since the Islamic \nworldview is different from the Western one. The Islamic worldview is based on the Quran \nand  Sunnah  (practice  of  Prophet  Muhammad  [pbuh]).  In  addition,  the  philosophy  of \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nIslamic banking is in accordance with the Shariah (Islamic law/jurisprudence) (Haron and \nNursofiza  2009).  According  to  Shariah,  Islamic  banking  and  finance  cannot  deal  \nin  any  transactions  involving  interest/riba  (an  increase  stipulated  or  sought  over  the \nprincipal  of  a  loan  or  debt).  Further,  they  cannot  deal  in  the  transactions  having  an \nelement of Gharar (uncertainty) or Maisir (gambling). Moreover, they cannot deal in any \ntransaction  that  has  a  subject  matter  that  is  invalid  (prohibited  in  the  eyes  of  Islam). \nIslamic  banks  focus  on  generating  returns  through  investment  tools  that  are  Shariah-\ncompliant  as  well.  Operating  within  the  sphere  of  Shariah,  the  operations  of  Islamic \nbanking are based on sharing the risks that may arise through trading and investment \nactivities using contracts of various Islamic modes of financing. The prohibition of a risk-\nfree return and permission of trading, as enshrined in Verse 2:275 of the Quran, makes \nthe financial activities asset-backed in an Islamic set-up, with the ability to cause \u201cvalue \naddition\u201d  (Haron  and  Nursofiza  2009).  As  a  result,  asset-based  and  equity-based \ncontracts  are  promoted  by  Islamic  finance  as  viable  alternatives  to  conventional \nfinancing, which merely relies on an interest-based system. In addition, the philosophy \nof Islamic banking and finance emphasizes on ethical, social and dimensions of financial \ntransactions which enhance equity and fairness for general benefit of the society. \n\n4.  THE PRODUCTS OF ISLAMIC BANKING  \nAND FINANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS \n\nThe Islamic financing options for small businesses can be divided into two categories, \nnamely  (i)  asset-based  financing,  and  (ii)  equity-based  financing.  These  financing \ncategories  have  been  part  and  parcel  of  boosting  the  financial  inclusion  of  small \nbusinesses  and  attracting  prospective  capital  providers  and  sources.  Asset-based \nfinancing  instruments  consist  of  Murabahah,  Ijarah,  Salam,  Ar-Rahn,  and  Tawaruq. \nMeanwhile, equity-based financing instruments include Mudharabah, and Musharakah. \nEach of the instruments is illustrated graphically and briefly explained below.  \n\n4.1  Murabahah Financing \n\nMurabahah is one of the most-applied forms of Islamic financial contracts made between \na financing institution and a client whereby the financier buys assets (usually at a lower \nprice) specified and required by the client and then sells those assets (usually at a higher \nprice) to a client; the profit margin is the difference between the buying and selling prices \nof  the  assets  that  are  paid  by  the  clients  mostly  on  an  installment  basis.  Among  the \nbenefits of this product are (i) a fixed rate of financing throughout the period of financing; \n(ii) the disclosure of the price and mark-up; (iii) its use for short-term financing; and (iv) \ngetting rid of collateral requirements.  \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM.

This is a special leasing \ncontract whereby legal title of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee after the expiry \nof the leasing period. At the end, as a lessor, the financial institution or the bank hands \nover the ownership of the leased asset to the lessee, the client. The lesser here is entitled \nto  claim  all  accumulated  rental  income,  including  the  profit.  The  IMBT  is  adopted  in \nseveral arrangements where the asset\u2019s ownership can be transferred, for example, the \nsale and transfer of the equity claim (from lessor to lessee). \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM.

This kind of contact is beneficial \nfor small agro-businesses that need working capital. Salam provides several benefits for \nsmall \ncapital,  \n(ii) usefulness for short-term financing, and (iii) beneficial for the agricultural industry.  \n\nof  Shariah-compliant  working \n\nbusinesses: \n\nprovision \n\n(i) \n\nFigure 3: Modus Operandi of Salam (Parallel Salam Financing) \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s illustration. \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\n4.4  Ar Rahn \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nAr-Rahnu is one type of short-term credit or loan (termed as Qardh in Arabic). The client \nwill  pledge  gold  or  other  valuable  metals  accepted  as  security,  which  acts  as  \nthe collateral for the loan. This special kind of contract is based on the principle of Islamic \nlaw  (Shariah)  under  savings  with  guarantee  or  safe-keeping  (Rahn  and  Wadiah  Yad \nDhamanah). Ar Rahn provides benefits such as (i) no interest, (ii) short-term financing for \nsmall businesses, and (iii) surpluses to be returned after auction in the case of default.  \n\nFigure 4: Modus Operandi of Ar Rahn \n\nSource: Author\u2019s illustration. \n\n \n\n4.5  Tawarruq Financing (organized Tawarruq) \n\nTawarruq  is  another  Islamic  financing  mode  in  which  a  series  of  sales  contracts  are \ninvolved in the entire transaction process. Here, a client buys a commodity from a seller \n(on a deferred basis) and afterwards sells the commodity to a third party (not the original \nseller and on a cash basis), to obtain liquidity. This instrument provides benefits in terms \nof  (i)  liquidity  management,  (ii)  suitability  for  meeting  the  needs  of  small  business\u2019 \nworking capital, and (iii) no collateral requirement.  \n\n4.6  Mudharabah Financing \n\nMudharabah  is  one  of  the  ideal  and  most  recommended  Islamic  financial  modes  of \noperations  in  which  the  business  or  project  is  managed/organized/run  based  on \npartnership. One party provides capital (called the capital provider or Rab-ul-Mal) and \nthe  second  party  manages  the  business  (called  the  entrepreneur/fund  manager  or \nMudarib). The profits (if any) are distributed based on the pre-agreed ratio, and the losses \n(if  any)  are  borne  solely  by  the  capital  provider  except  in  the  case  where  the  fund \nmanager has fulfilled all the responsibilities bestowed on him/her. If there is negligence \nin managing the funds or bossiness, the fund manager or Mudarib is also liable for the \nloss  amounts.  The  Mudharabah  contact  is  very  appropriate  for  small  businesses \nthe  entrepreneur  does  not  have  \nbecause \n\n(i)  profit  sharing; \n\nthere \n\n(ii) \n\nis \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM.

MOBILIZATION OF ISLAMIC BANKING \n\nAND FINANCE TOWARDS SMES IN MALAYSIA \nAND INDONESIA \n\nThe RAM Rating (2019) revealed that Islamic banks in Malaysia maintain strong growth \nas  Islamic  banks  continue  to  expand  at  a  much  faster  pace  than  their  conventional \ncounterparts  with  11%  in  2018  and  comprising  about  32%  of  the  overall  system\u2019s \nfinancing. Islamic banks are seen as a robust platform for assisting SMEs in accessing \nfinancing as BNM statistics in early 2019 indicated that Islamic banks in Malaysia held \ntotal assets amounting to RM682,048.4 million.  \n\nRecent  research  by  the  Association  of  Islamic  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions \nMalaysia  (AIBIM)  indicate  that  about  10,000  SMEs  received  more  than  10  billion  in \nfunding (Kamel, 2019). A key indicator of the BNM reports is that RM4,716.2 million of \ntotal financing was disbursed as of November 2019 solely by Islamic banks for several \nsectors  (Bank  Negara  Malaysia  2019).  The  AIBIM  asserts  that  Islamic  banks  granted \nRM20 billion worth of financing access to SMEs (Kamel 2019). However, despite that, \nSMEs are seen as not fully utilizing various solutions provided by Islamic banks because \na lack of awareness persists among SME entrepreneurs regarding the financing options \nobtainable. \n\nA  number  of  financing  activities  were  traced  to  supporting  the  prodigious  growth  of  \nthe  SME  industry.  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  (2019)  data  depicted  a  steady  growth  of  \nSME  financing  by  type  of  Islamic  product.  For  instance,  Bai  Bithaman  Ajil\u2019s  (BBA) \nproducts  totaled  RM64,488.9  million,  Ijarah  RM9,910.7  million,  Ijarah  Thumma  Al-Bai \nRM72,423.0 million, Murabahah RM208,532.9 million, Musyarakah RM50,904.2 million, \nMudharabah RM57 million, Istisna' RM2,059.8 million and others RM103,284.0 million. \nTable 1 shows the total financing and increments in total financing disbursed by Islamic \nbanks in support of SMEs\u2019 gradual advancement. \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM.

Therefore, \nthat  a  number  of  sectors  \nre  enormously  aided  through  the  financing  facilities  provided  by  Islamic  banking  \nand finance institutions to SMEs in Malaysia. For instance, the Bank Negara Malaysia \n(2019) reported these sectors included agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing \n(including  agro-based),  electricity,  gas  and  water  supply,  wholesale  and  retail  trade, \nrestaurants and hotels, transport, storage and communication, finance, insurance, real \nestate and business activities, education, health and others, household sector, and other \nsectors. \n\nis  evident \n\nit \n\nlargest  providers  of \n\nMeanwhile, Islamic banks in Indonesia were established in 1991 and pioneered by Bank \nMualamat.

The  sector  is  currently \ndominated by two leading players, namely Bank Mandiri Syariah and Bank Muamalat \nthat account for 50% of total Shariah financing between them (Global Business Guide-\nIndonesia 2011).  \n\nThe  development  of  Islamic  banks  in  Indonesia  started  two  decades  ago,  and  the \nconventional banks still covered almost 70% of the industry at that time. However, the \ntrend of subsidiaries and the promotion of rational behavior in this industry will trigger \nmore Shariah-based banking in the near future. \n\nIn terms of the financing contracts, more than 80% of the financing at the full-fledged \nIslamic  banks  in  the  country  is  based  on  three  contract  types\u2014Murabahah  (54%), \nMusharakah (34%) and Mudharabah (6%), adhering more closely to the classical Islamic \nmodel of economics than possibly any other country. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM.

Thaker et al. \n\nFigure 8: Usage of Islamic Finance Product \n\n \n\nFigure 8 shows that most of the financing of Islamic banks is for the household sector. \nThe financial intermediaries are the best indicator of usage of Islamic financial products \nin the economic sectors. Thus, real usage of the microenterprises in Indonesia is still the \nlowest,  and  this  may be  influenced  by  various  factors  such  as  the  scale  of  borrowing \nwithin the five economic sectors. Most of the time, the usage of SMEs is less compared \nto the above five sectors. In addition, these indicators also explain that expansion and \ndemand for Islamic finance products in Indonesia is significant in the top five economic \nsectors. \n\nIndonesia  appears  to  be  a  natural  growing  market  for  Shariah-compliant  banking \nservices, given the size of the Muslim majority population; however, the character of the \nmarket  is  starkly  different  from  that  of  neighboring  Malaysia  or  the  Middle  East.  The \nmajority  of  Indonesia\u2019s  potential  Islamic  banking  customers  fall  under  the  \u201crational \nmarket\u201d  as  opposed  to  that  of  the  \u201cspiritual  market.\u201d  Islamic  banking  products  are \ntherefore pitted against their conventional counterparts and judged on their commercial \nmerits as opposed to being chosen on the basis of faith.  \n\n6.  POTENTIAL OF ISLAMIC BANKING AND FINANCE \n\nFOR FOSTERING TECH START-UPS \n\nIslamic  banking  and  finance  are  widely  known  as  banking  systems  focusing  their \noperations and activities purely based on Shariah rules and regulations. Since 1960, the \nprogression  of  Islamic  banking  and  finance  has  been  undeniably  significant  and \ncontinues  to  growth  at  peak  levels and  to  compete  against  conventional  counterparts \nwho have been in existence for the last 420 years.  \n\nOne unique feature of Islamic banking and finance is the profit-and-loss scheme whereby \nall assets and liabilities are integrated, and with this arrangement, Islamic banking and \nfinance are able to lend on a longer-term basis for projects or start-up businesses that \nhave higher or lower return characteristics. This will also promote economic well-being \nand growth. The most common types of financing used by Islamic banking and finance \nto support long-term businesses are Mudharabah (profit sharing) and Musharakah (joint \nventure).  Existing  literature  highlighted  that  in  view  of  the  preference  for  profit/loss \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nsharing scheme over other trading modes, Murabahah can also play a role as financing \nfacility, given its permissibility. In addition, under the Murabahah scheme, the buy-and-\nsell financing, given equal instalments, is flexible, easier to understand, and simple to \nmonitor (Suzuki and Uddin 2016).  \n\nKessler,  Allocca,  and  Rahman  (2017)  mentioned  that  SMEs  or  start-ups  encourage \nentrepreneurship  and  obviously  will  enhance  economic  expansion  under  the  Islamic \nbanking  and  finance  setting.  The  products  such  as  Murabahah,  Mudharabah,  and \nQardhul  Hasan  under  IB  seem  to  be  most  suited  for  start-up  businesses  and  other \nequivalent businesses. Interestingly, Qardhul Hasan, Murabahah, and Ijarah financing \nare  flexible  in  usage  and  easy  to  implement  in  determining  capital  needs  (Qardhul \nHasan), equipment and assets (Murabahah), and leasing (Ijarah) for SMEs (World Bank-\nIDB  2015;  Dhumale  and  Sapcanin  1998).  Thus,  plenty  of  financial  schemes  can  be \nsuitable  for start-up  businesses,  but  they  are  also subject  to  the  risk  profiles of  those \nparticular businesses. For example, in the case of SMEs, the study by Hussein, Noordin, \nand Taherdoost (2015) shows that 95% of all financing of SMEs in 2003 were approved \nbased on Ijarah, Bay Bithaman Ajil, and Murabahah financing schemes.  \n\nLooking  at  the  offering  patterns  of  Islamic  banking  and  finance  facility,  start-up \nbusinesses can utilize this facility, which will be useful for accelerating their businesses. \nThe  availability  of  these  types  of  financing  to  various  businesses,  including  start-ups, \nhave been recognized by various parties, such as policy makers in many countries, as it \nis  consistent  with  Shariah  principles.  The  Organization  of  Islamic  Cooperation  (OIC) \nemphasizes  the  importance  of  the  development  of  SMEs  and start-up  businesses  via \nactive usage of Islamic financial products linked to real economic activity. Thus, it allowed \nvarious businesses in member countries to tap into the rapidly growing pool of Shariah-\ncompliant  funds.  Nevertheless,  the  General  Council  for  Islamic  Banks  and  Financial \nInstitutions,  together  with  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB),  keep  finding  the  best \ninnovative ways of financing to further accelerate the growth of businesses worldwide \nand promote the role of Islamic finance, especially the social finance aspect. \n\n7.  ISLAMIC BANKING AND FINANCE\u2019S RISK \n\nMANAGEMENT OF SMES \n\nThe partnership-based, long-term Islamic financing products have higher risks compared \nto  the  debt-based,  short-term  products.  Islamic  financial  institutions  need  to  practice \nboth, depending on the demand and the context. As discussed earlier, the principle of \nrisk-sharing is the key element of equity or partnership contracts. In order to use these \nfinancial products, it is necessary to have some moral or ethical values, including justice, \ntrust, truth, honesty, and responsibility. \n\nIslamic financial institutions cannot claim any gain or profit if there is no risk. Thus, it is \nup  to  institutions  to  bear  various  risks  such  as  default  risks,  which  are  capital  risks, \nmarket risks, and economic risks. The institution cannot shift the risk to the partner or \nmake  a  risk-free  contract  and gain  a  fixed  rate  of  income  as  profit.  To  avoid  this,  the \ninstitution makes sufficient effort to minimize the risk factors involved in any contract that \nis allowed in Islam.  \n\nAccording to the Islamic principle of financing, the risk should be shared by the capital \nproviders and the borrowers, and it does not allow shifting the risk solely to one party. It \nshould be borne in mind that the goal and motivation of Islamic finance is the creation of \nwealth and development of business. These common goals help increase the level of \ncooperation  and  decrease  the  flow  of  asymmetrical  information,  adverse  selections, \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nmoral  hazards,  and  speculations  among  the  parties  involved  in  Islamic  financial \ncontracts. The practice of moral values particularly by the borrowers or entrepreneurs \ncan mitigate various risks involved in the transactions, and in many cases, the collateral \nrequirements and credit assessment can be less important. However, this does not allow \nIslamic  financial  institutions  to  be  involved  in  any  financial  contracts  without  proper \nevaluation, monitoring, and supervising of the businesses or projects, particularly in the \ncase of SMEs.  \n\n8.  CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF ISLAMIC \n\nFINANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES \n\nSome of the challenges involving in Islamic finance implementation for small business \nare as follows:  \n\n(i)  Product Offerings \n\nThe  Islamic  financial  products  offered  to  small  businesses  are  skewed  more \ntoward  debt  financing  such  as  Murabahah.  Although  there  are  other  products \nsuch as Musharakah, Mudharabah, and Ijarah, Murabahah is more suitable for \nspecific financing purposes, and these products come with better profit and loss \nsharing.  Thus,  there  is  no  diversity  in  offering  different  financial  products  to \nsupport  small  businesses\u2019  financial  needs.  There  is  a  need  to  move  towards \nequity-based financing instead of just relying on debt-based financing.  \n\n(ii)  Regulatory Framework \n\nOne of the crucial challenges for Islamic finance, regardless of whether it is for \nsmall  businesses  or  other  platforms,  is  the  lack  of  a  regulatory  framework  for \nfinancial  products.  Looking  at  conventional  financing,  the  regulation  standards \nare  more  harmonized  and  standardized,  which  makes  their  products  more \nmarketable  and  easier  to  follow.  In  Islamic  finance,  the  products  are  less \nstandardized since there are no approved standards per se for Islamic finance. \nMost of the Islamic finance products follow the conventional banking rules and \nregulations. \n\n(iii) Transaction Costs and Non-movable Collateral \n\nAs far as Islamic finance for small business is concerned, the transaction costs \nand  taxes  involved  are  relatively  higher  compared  to  their  conventional \ncounterparts  in  financing.  Possible  reasons  for  this  may  be  the  Shariah \nverification  processes  and  complicated  taxation  guidelines.  Furthermore,  small \nbusinesses  generally  facing  the  problem  of  non-movable  collateral  cause  the \nIslamic  banks  to  be  reluctant  to  finance  small  businesses  in  general.  Thus,  a \nstrong legal standard is needed in order to allow small businesses to use utilize \ntheir movable tangible assets.  \n\n(iv) Knowledge and Information \n\nThe  knowledge  and  availability  of  Islamic  finance  products  to  entrepreneurs, \nespecially at the start-up level, is still at a low level. This may be due to the limited \nnumber  of  Islamic  finance  products  offered,  and  this  industry  is  still  at  \nthe  beginning  stage,  compared  to  conventional  banks.  The  Muslim  majority \ncountries  such  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  and others are  moving  toward  full-fledged \nIslamic  finance  institutions,  and  this  will  lead  to  a  better  Islamic  finance  \neco-system. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\n(v)  Smart Collaboration \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nCurrently, the government and private sectors that offer Islamic finance products \nto  small  businesses  are  executing  their  roles  individually.  Smart  collaboration \nsuch  as  shared  capital, \nresponsibilities  \nwill  attract  more  stakeholders,  such  as  investors,  to  participate  in  the  SMEs\u2019 \ninvestments as capital providers. \n\ntraining,  and  other \n\nrisk, \n\n9.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \n\nTo  sum  up,  small  businesses  are  playing  a  vital  part  in  economies  as  they  create \nemployment  and  contribute  to  the  national  income.  However,  this  sector  faces  many \nchallenges,  particularly  in  accessing  financial  services  in  many  countries,  including \nMalaysia  and  Indonesia.  This  research  has  compiled  the  findings  of  a  number  of \nempirical studies that can be viewed from the financier\u2019s as well as the entrepreneur\u2019s \nperspectives. It has been observed that the financier is quite reluctant to provide finance \nto  the  entrepreneurs  of  small  businesses.  The  main  causes  for  most  of  the  loan \napplications  of  entrepreneurs  to  be  denied  are  their  early  stage  of  business \nestablishment  and  lack  of  proper  business  experience,  no  collateral  security,  higher \ntransaction  costs,  improper  business  planning,  small  size  of  loans,  limited  or  lower \nproduction  networks,  lower  sales,  revenue,  and  cash-flows,  and  bad  credit  history.  \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  entrepreneurs  of  small  businesses  criticized  the  financiers \nbecause of their rigid terms and conditions of loan approval. In addition, there are many \nother  objections  regarding  the  financiers  that  are  related  to  inadequate  information, \ninsufficient advice, collateral requirements, transaction costs, loan amounts, interest rate \nand  repayment  period,  loan  maturity,  lending  processes,  etc.  Apart  from  highlighting \nthese financing challenges, this research also discussed the government policies and \nprograms  of  small  businesses  in  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  for  the  development  of  the \nindustry. As can be realized from the discussion, these programs are not fully satisfying \nthe financial needs of the small businesses.  \n\nThe SME sector has many challenges, and one of the most important ones is the lack of \nrequired financing either to start up or to expand the existing enterprises. In this paper, \nwe  have  presented  a  number  of  Islamic  financial  products  such  as  Mudharabah, \nMusharakah, Murabaha, Ijarah, and Salam which can be adopted to meet the financial \nneeds of the entrepreneurs. Among these products, there are some short-term in nature, \ni.e.,  Murabaha,  which  is  particularly  appropriate  for  financing  day-to-day  business \nactivities and for satisfying the requirement of working capital which has higher risks than \nsome  of  the  long-term  products,  i.e.,  Mudharabah,  Musharakah,  Ijarah,  and  Salam, \nwhich are most appropriate for the economic viability of the businesses. Ideally, Islamic \nfinancial institutions should be focusing more on non-borrowing and long-term Islamic \nproducts or contracts to finance the long-term projects. As a possible solution for those \nchallenges, the present research presents a few innovative Islamic financing modes, i.e., \nMudharabah, Musharakah, Murabahah, Ijarah, and Salam.  \n\nIslamic  financial  products  can  be  better  alternatives  or  substitutes  for  conventional \nfinancial  contracts,  but  they  are  not  complementary  to  each  other.  This  is  because  \nof  the  underlying  fundamental  principle  involved  in  Islamic  financial  contracts  that  is \nguided  by  Islamic  law  or  Shariah.  The  key  difference  between  these  two  financial \nsystems  is  the  practice  of  interest  or  riba,  uncertainty  (Gharar),  gambling,  and \nspeculation, which are not accepted under any condition by the Islamic financial system. \nIn  addition,  the  current  practice  of  conventional  financing  in  most  of  the  cases  is  not \nbased on partnerships with profit-and-loss sharing principles.  \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nM. A. B. M. T. Thaker et al. \n\nIn real situations, there are many uncertainties that make businesses either profitable or \nfailures.  An  entrepreneur  who  starts  a  new  enterprise  can  face  many  business \nuncertainties.  The  entrepreneur  can  share  the  risks  of  conducting  business  with  an \nIslamic financial institution as the partner. In this case, the institution can create a risk-\nsharing investment account on its liability side based on Mudharabah or Musharakah, \nwhereas on its assets side, there could be the underlying contract with various Islamic \nfinance products. Along with this, Islamic financial institutions, including banks, can get \nnecessary support from government and its policymakers to fruitfully use equity-based \nfinancing contracts to better serve the SME sector.  \n\nThe present research recommends that a successful implementation of the innovative \nIslamic  financing  mode  of  operations  can  not  only  mitigate  the  existing  financial \nchallenges of small businesses, but it can also bring solutions to varieties of problems \nfaced  by  the  financiers  in  financing  to  small  businesses.  Further  research  can  be \nconducted on the suitability of each of the financing modes in different contexts, i.e., the \nnature of project or business, type of sector (agriculture or industry), market condition, \nand infrastructural and technological capacity. It is also hoped that after the successful \nassessment of all the possible factors, selecting the most appropriate Islamic financial \nmodes can elevate the small business sector not only in Malaysia and Indonesia but also \nin  some  other  parts  of  the  world  and  thus  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  social \nwelfare. \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 1156 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nM.

Thus, to translate innovative ideas into sustainable businesses, access to \ncapital becomes a part and parcel of their business lifecycle. Despite their potential importance \nfor  economic  development,  small  businesses  are  facing  difficulties  in  attracting  external \nfinance  at  the  early  and  middle  stages  of  the  entrepreneurial  lifecycle  in  many  countries, \nincluding developed and developing countries. As a response, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \non Financing for Development (2015) recognized the role of additional financing, in particular \nusing innovative mechanisms, instruments and modalities. It encourages mechanisms based \non models combining public and private resources (blended finance) and joint ventures that \nbring  significant  impact  investing.  In  line  with  this,  Islamic  banking  and  finance  is  a  broad \nframework that has great potential for supporting development finance particularly related to \nsmall  business,  given  their  fundamental  criteria  emphasizing  generating  positive  societal \nimpact. The main objectives covered by this paper are: (i) to perform a landscape analysis of \nfinancing small business for selected Asian countries, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia; (ii) \nto identify and unpack innovative financing opportunities within Islamic banking and finance \ninstruments  such  as  Mudharabah  (profit-sharing),  Musharakah  (profit-loss  sharing), \nMurabahah  (sale  with  cost  plus  profit  margin,  Ijarah  [Islamic  leasing]),  and  Salam  (forward \nsale) as potential solutions for addressing small businesses\u2019 funding gaps; and (iii) to initiate \nthe  development  of  systematic  principles  for  the  utilization  of  Islamic  banking  and  finance \ninstruments in financing small businesses.  \n \nKeywords: small businesses, financing, Islamic banking and finance, Malaysia, Indonesia \n \nJEL Classification: E5, G2, L26 \n \n", " \n"]}
