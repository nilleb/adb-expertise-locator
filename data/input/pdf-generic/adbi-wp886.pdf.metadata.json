INTRODUCTION \nCurrently, Viet Nam is a fossil fuel-intensive economy that derives nearly two-thirds  \nof its energy supply from coal, oil, and gas (Government of Viet Nam 2016b). The \ndomestic market\u2019s increasing demand for energy in recent years has made the country \na  coal  importer  since 2015.  Viet Nam,  however,  is  a  potentially  rich  country  with \nabundant sources of renewable energy (RE), particularly wind power, solar power and \nbiomass, that remain substantially untapped. In 2015, only 3.7% of the total electricity \nsupply derived from renewable energy. The overreliance on fossil fuel in the energy \nmix is threatening the energy security of the nation. In addition, Viet Nam has been \nexperiencing  severe  environmental  issues  related  to  climate  change  and  local  air \npollution. All of those issues require the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with green \nand  environmentally  friendly  energy  sources.  This  chapter  aims  to  analyze  the \nrationales for the development of the RE industry in Viet Nam followed by the current \nposition  of  RE  financing  in  the  country.  Furthermore,  it  studies  the  fundamental \nobstacles  that  challenge  RE  financing.  Despite  the  advantage  of  finding  financial \nsources for renewable energy, namely a proper national energy strategy to provide a \nconcrete foundation to lure private investment with basic financial incentives such as \nFIT and preferential tax, a large number of hindrances still exist, such as the low-\nregulated price of electricity, which makes it difficult for RE projects to be profitable \nconsidering the uncertainty of the creditworthiness of Viet Nam Electricity (EVN), a \nstate-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  dominating  the  electricity  industry.  Moreover,  the \nunderdeveloped financial system lacks the capacity to deliver long-term capital and the \nbanking system has weak competence in implementing green credit appraisal. Based \non the existing challenges, the authors make recommendations including reviewing the \nenergy price policy by implementing a fiscal policy reform to encourage RE investment \nand developing a fully functional domestic financial system combined with sustainable \nbusiness performance of EVN to increase foreign investors\u2019 trust. \n2.  MOTIVATIONS FOR ACCELERATING GREEN \nENERGY DEPLOYMENT IN VIET NAM \n2.1  Diversification of the Energy Mix and Energy  \nSelf-Sufficiency \nViet Nam possesses an energy supply basket with prominent coal, oil, biomass, and \ngeothermal energy (Figure 1). In 2015, the total primary energy supply was 70,588 \nKTOE,  of  which  coal  occupied  the  largest  part  (34%),  followed  by  oil  (25%)  and \nbiomass and thermal (21%); meanwhile, natural gas and hydro accounted for minor \nshares of 13% and 7%, respectively (IEA 2016). \nRegarding the final energy consumption (Figure 2), based on 2015 data (IEA 2015), \nthe  energy  that  the  industrial  sector  consumed  ranked  first,  with  41.72%  of  the  \ntotal  energy  consumption  nationwide,  followed  by  the  residential  (33.23%)  and \ntransportation  sectors  (19.54%).  Industrialization  used  a  significant  share  of  the  \nenergy,  consisting  of  many  energy-intensive  industries,  such  as  the  production  of  \nsteel, fertilizers, cement, pulp, and paper, which often rely on outdated production \ntechnologies (Danish Energy Agency 2017).  \n   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 1: Viet Nam\u2019s Primary Energy Supply by Source (2015) \n \n Source: IEA (2016). \nFigure 2: Final Energy Consumption by Sector in Viet Nam (2015) \n \nSource: IEA (2015). \nThe evolution of the primary energy supply over a longer period, from 1990 to 2015 \n(Figure 3), shows a gradual increase in the total amount of energy over the years. More \nnotably, an obvious increasing trend of coal in both absolute numbers and percentages \nis apparent. The proportion of the coal supply in the energy basket of the country \nexpanded significantly from an average of 14% in the 1990s to 19% in the 2000s and \n30%  in  the  period  from  2001  to  2015.  This  noteworthy  figure  is  a  result  of  the \nVietnamese Government\u2019s policy that determined coal as the primary source of the \nenergy supply for the country, the Power Development Plan 7 (PDP 7), revised in  \n2016 (Government of Viet Nam 2016b). In contrast, the contribution of biomass and \nwaste has tended to decrease. There was a dramatically decreasing proportion in the \nrenewable energy supply (mainly biomass generated in the countryside) during the \nperiod 1990 to 2015. Biomass was previously the primary source, comprising 70% in \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \n1990 and over 50% of the total energy supply before 2000; however, oil and coal \nrapidly replaced it and it consequently accounted for only around 20% in 2015, partly \ndue to the increasing income of rural areas (Dang et al. 2009). \nFigure 3: Evolution of the Primary Energy Supply in Viet Nam (1990\u20132015) \n \nSource: IEA (2015). \nAn analysis of the primary energy mix (Figure 4), although it currently includes a variety \nof energy sources, indicates that the major contribution is from coal, which is also in \nline with the energy strategy of the government to meet the domestic energy demand \nbased on its cheap operation cost for energy generation. In the revised version of the \nPDP 7 in March 2016, the government expressed its interest in coal-fired energy by \ndeveloping a plan to derive the majority of the energy supply for industrialization from \ncoal. It forecasted the component of coal to dominate with 49.3%, 55%, and 53.2% in \n2020, 2025, and 2030, respectively (Government of Viet Nam 2016b). \nIn order to satisfy the high demand for domestic energy, the import volume of coal has \nrisen significantly since 2014 (Figure 5). The value of energy imports is greater than \nthat of exports as a result of the decline in coal exports and the increase in coal \nimports, with net imports of 12% in 2015. The coal imports in 2016 amounted to more \nthan 10 million tons; the expectation is that this amount will increase in the coming \nyears (Government of Viet Nam 2016b). With the increasing energy demand and the \nrecent fluctuations in energy imports and exports, Viet Nam has been a net energy \nimporter since 2015 (Figure 5). At the same time, the volume of energy exports has \ndeclined, with an export volume of nearly 12 thousand KTOE in 2015 that equals only \n40% of the amount in 2009. \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 4: Structure of Power Sources as a Share of the Total Electricity Supply  \nin Viet Nam \n \nSource: Government of Viet Nam (2016b). \nFigure 5: Viet Nam Energy Imports \u2013 Exports Position \n \nSource: IEA (2015). \nThe situation of imported coal and the forecasted energy supply, as the Revised PDP  \n7 demonstrates, has raised significant concerns with regard to the energy security  \nof the country. First, it makes the country more import dependent, reduces its energy \nself-sufficiency,  and  makes  it  vulnerable  to  external  energy  price  shocks.  Several \nstudies have found that reliance on fewer energy resources will reduce the energy \nsecurity, among which Taghizadeh-Hesary, Yoshino, and Rasoulinezhad (2017) shed \nlight on the energy-consuming sectors in Japan after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, \nwhich resulted in nuclear power shutdown and substitution of the nuclear loss with the \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nimporting of more coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Their results showed that \nthe absolute value of elasticities of most oil consumption sectors in Japan decreased \nafter this disaster because of the increased dependency on oil consumption, which \nendangered the energy security of the country. They proposed that, to increase the \nenergy  self-dependence  and  energy  security,  Japan  needs  to  diversify  its  energy \nsupplies from too much dependency on fossil fuel to a combination of fossil fuel and \nRE. Second, as the domestic price for fossil fuels is currently below the world market \nprice, public sources would have to bridge this price gap for imports, putting pressure \non a government budget that is already in deficit. Third, the fact that over 50% of the \nenergy supply is coal illustrates the improper energy diversification of the country. \nFor those reasons, a transition of the economy from industry that has less intensive \nenergy use or the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative sources of energy \u2013 such \nas renewables \u2013 as highly desirable from the perspective of increased energy security.  \n2.2  Higher Energy Efficiency and Lower GHG Emissions \nViet Nam\u2019s GHG emission growth is among the largest in the world, and its carbon \nintensity is the second highest among the Asian countries (World Bank 2015). Level of \nenergy intensity is gradually increasing and predictions indicate that it will become a \nmajor greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter in the region considering the decline among \nother countries in East Asia and the Pacific as well as lower-middle income countries \n(Figure 6). These projections are mainly based on the growth in the use of coal, as this \nsource will account for more than 50% of the energy mix by 2030 for power generation, \nas illustrated in the revised PDP 7 (Government of Viet Nam, 2016b). \nFigure 6: Energy Intensity Level of Primary Energy Source from 2000 to 2015 \n \nSource: World Bank (2015). \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 7: Per Capita CO  Emissions vs. Per Capita GDP in Viet Nam (1985\u20132014) \n2\n \nSource: World Bank (2015). \nFigure 7 shows the positive correlation between the CO  emissions per capita and the \n2\nGDP growth per capita of the country in three consecutive decades (from 1985 to \n2014). Viet Nam witnessed an impressive economic growth rate with an average per \nannum of 6% from 1985 to 2014. However, at the same time, the amount of CO  \n2\nemissions per capita experienced an identical pattern, increasing four times during the \nperiod, with absolute emissions rising from 21.168,924 kt in 1990 to 166.910,839 kt in \n2014. The strong coupling between economic growth and CO  emission generation \n2\nrequires a less CO -intensive industrialization strategy in the future. \n2\nAs  mentioned  before,  Viet  Nam  is  continuing  to  develop  coal-fired  thermal  power \nplants, determining coal as the primary source of the electricity supply for the economy. \nKoplitz et al. (2017), in their study, investigated the growth of emissions in relation to \nchanges in the carbon intensity in Viet Nam, finding that the large increases after 1990 \nare mainly attributable to the increased use of oil but that coal plays a significant role. \nEmissions, which are the main source of air pollution and lead to climate change, have \nadversely affected the national growth and poverty reduction in many nations, including \nViet Nam. \nAccording to the Global Climate Risk Index\u2019s Vulnerability Index (Germanwatch 2017), \nViet  Nam  ranked  8th  among  the  10  countries  most  affected  by  extreme  weather \nevents. The country has suffered negative changes, including a higher temperature, a \nsea level rise, heavy and abnormal storms, floods, and droughts. The poor in remote \nareas are exposed to the greatest risk given their dependence on natural resources for \ntheir livelihood. The Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta have been experiencing \nsaltwater intrusion, worsening the agricultural productivity. Urban dwellings in big cities, \nsuch as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, have also witnessed heat and humidity extremes \ncombined with unusual floods and storms.  \nAs the global climate change has a broad extent when measuring the impact of Viet \nNam in responding to this universal phenomenon (Zimmer, Jakob, and Steckel 2015), it \nseems to be obvious to take into account the severe local pollution issue. Generating \nenergy from coal is costlier than it appears due to the underlying expenses for the local \nenvironment, health, and livelihoods. Furthermore, it is necessary to transport and bury \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nas landfill the huge amount of waste from coal projects, while its price often does not \ninclude air pollution and other externalities.  \nAs of 2011, Viet Nam has 38 coal-fired power plants in operation; projections indicate \nthat this number will reach 133 by 2030. Coal-fired power plants are important polluters \nin the local environment in which factories are established. They discharge more than 3 \nmillion tons of coal slag each year, in addition to releasing a large amount of fly ash \ninto the atmosphere. If all the plants become operational, the bottom ash slag will \nincrease to 14 million tons per year by 2020, with nearly 35 million tons of bottom ash \nby 2030, along with tens of millions of fly ash, mainly SO , NOx, and primary PM 2.5 \n2\ngases. Koplitz et al. (2017) predicted that, by 2030, the total number of deaths due to \ncoal pollution in Viet Nam would be 19,220, mainly due to heart disease and stroke. \nTherefore,  an  ambitious  strategy  from  the  authorities  that  is  cleaner  and  more \nenvironmentally friendly, not only globally with a broad extent but specifically for the \nlocal environment first, requires a significant change in the country\u2019s strategic energy \ndeployment. Because it is impossible to abandon and discontinue a large number of \ncoal-fired projects, the country must consider the employment of technology for cleaner \ncoal-fired power plants as the most important solution, since currently almost all the \ncoal energy generators in Viet Nam are out of date (ECA 2016). A variety of models for \ngreening and modernizing the technology of the coal-fired industry that benefit the \ngreening energy sector process are available; Isogo thermal power plant in Japan \nprovides an example.  \n2.3  Unleashing the Substantial Untapped Potential  \nof Renewable Energy \nViet  Nam  has  abandoned  sources  of  RE  generation,  although  they  offer  a  large \nnumber of advantages due to its geographic location. Wind, solar, and biomass are the \nthree most promising energy sources for generating green energy.  \nBiomass is an important and abundant source of energy in Viet Nam, since a large \nnumber of citizens are located in rural areas and the agricultural sector. Agricultural \nwaste is abundant in the Mekong Delta region, accounting for roughly 50% of the waste \nof the whole country, and, in the Red River Delta, it comprises 15% of the country\u2019s \nwaste.  Before  2000,  nearly  90%  of  rural  areas\u2019  energy consumption  derived  from \nbiomass, such as fuel wood, agricultural residues, and charcoal. Moreover, biomass \nfuel is an important source of energy for micro and small industries located mainly in \nremote areas.  \nDue to its favorable geographic conditions, Viet Nam has huge potential for solar \nenergy  production,  with  1,600\u20132,700  sunlight  hours  per  year  and  average  direct  \nnormal irradiance of 4\u20135 kWh per sqm per day (GE 2018). Specifically, Viet Nam  \nhas rich potential for solar photovoltaic (PV) power. This type of energy production  \nhas great advantages, such as very few negative environmental impacts and zero \nGHG emissions. After the initial investment, except for small amounts of costs for \nmaintenance,  solar  panel  cleaning,  and  liability  insurance,  there  are  no  other \noperational  costs.  The  costs  of  generating  electricity  from  solar  PV  are  steadily \nreducing. Globally, government and private sector incentives to invest in renewable \nenergy have grown as a way of reducing fossil fuel dependency and environmental \ndamage. Due to these new investments, the renewable energy field has experienced \nvast growth in recent years. In the field of solar electricity in particular, the annual  \nsolar PV electricity production increased from 4 TWh in 2005 to 247 TWh in 2015  \n(IEA  2017).  Moreover,  the  accumulated  solar  electricity  plant  capacity  grew  from \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \n100,504 MW in 2012 to 368,000 MW in 2017. One of the factors supporting this growth \nin the solar electricity sector is the reduction in the cost of solar modules (Taghizadeh-\nHesary, Yoshino, and Inagaki 2018). \nWith regard to wind energy, Viet Nam\u2019s potential capacity is considerable compared \nwith that of Thailand, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), or Cambodia. \nWith a coastline of more than 3,000 km and a location in the monsoonal climate zone, \nViet Nam has considerable potential for harnessing its wind resources. The provinces \nwith the most promising wind potential include BinhThuan, NinhThuan, Vung Tau, Ben \nTre,  SocTrang,  Bac  Lieu,  Ca  Mau,  and  the  Central Highlands.  Estimates  indicate  \nthat the total technical potential for wind power development in the country is 24 GW, \naccording to an atlas (GIZ 2013). \nIn terms of renewable energy generation from solid waste, with a population of more \nthan 93 million people, the volume of waste disposed of in Viet Nam is huge. On \naverage,  the  country  discharges  nearly  35,000  tons  of  urban  daily  life  waste  and \n34,000 tons of domestic waste. In big cities like Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, 7,000 to \n8,000  tons  of  waste  accumulate  each  day  (Schneider  et  al.  2017).  However,  the \namount of waste has not been used thoroughly as a source of energy for life. Currently, \nthe country treats nearly 85% of the current waste mainly with landfill technology, which \nrequires large land funds; 80% of landfills are not hygienic, potentially contaminating \nthe  environment.  With  35,000  tons  of  rubbish  buried  each  day,  this  is  a  wasted \nresource that Viet Nam has not fully utilized for energy generation.  \nBox 1: RE Potential in Viet Nam \nSmall Hydro \u2013 Small hydropower projects account for 1914 MW of total energy with the \npotential for a further 7,000 MW. \nWind Energy \u2013 technical potential of 26.7 GW (development of 10\u201312 GW in 2035); \nBiomass \u2013 technical potential of 10.3 GW (development of 2.9\u20133.7 GW in 2035); \nBiogas \u2013 technical potential of 5.3 GW; \nSolid wastes \u2013 technical potential of 1.55 GW; \nSolar \u2013 technical potential of about 300 GW (development of 21\u201340 GW in 2035). \nSource: GIZ (2016). \n3.  FINANCING FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY  \nIN VIET NAM \n3.1  Key Policy Regulations Related to Renewable  \nEnergy Financing \nSince 2011, the Viet Nam government has issued a sequence of regulations to support \nthe implementation of RE in the country financially; Table 1 summarizes the essential \nlegal documents. \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nTable 1: Key Policy Regulations Related to Renewable Energy \nYear  Targeted Renewable \n  Name of Regulation  Issued  Key Points  Source \n1  National Power Development Plan  2011  Financial instruments  Wind (onshore), \n2011\u20132030 (suspended and  (financial incentives, tax  biomass \nrevised in 2016)  relief, FIT, premium) \n2  Accelerated depreciation tax relief  2013  Tax relief  All renewable sources, \nfor renewable projects  hydro power, solar \n3  Decision on support mechanism for  2014  FIT, premium  Biomass \nwaste-to-energy and biomass \npower projects (biomass FIT) \n4  Viet Nam Renewable Energy  2016  Strategic planning  All renewable sources \nDevelopment Strategy 2016\u20132030 \nwith Outlook until 2050 \n5  Revised National Power  2016  Strategic planning  All renewable sources \nDevelopment Plan 7 (PDP 7 rev.) \nSource: Government of Viet Nam (2001\u20132016b). \nFurthermore, the government has issued regulations in response to the increasing \nconcerns about national climate change risks. The growing global attention to the \nachievement  of  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  development  in  the  country  also \nspurred this interest. The most relevant policies and regulations in this context include \nthe following: \n\u2022  The Government of Viet Nam prioritized climate change actions in the National \nTarget  Program  to  Respond  to  Climate  Change  (NTP-RCC),  which  it \npromulgated in 2008 through the Decision of the Prime Minister No. 158.  \n\u2022  In addition, in Decision No. 82/2002, the government established the Viet Nam \nEnvironment  Protection  Fund  (VEPF)  with  the  purpose  of  collecting \nenvironmental protection activities and appointing the Ministry of Finance and \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam as members of the VEPF. A later decision (No. \n35/2008) updated the legal status of the VEPF and established it as a revolving \nfund with charter capital of VND 500 billion. \n\u2022  Furthermore, relating to climate finance, the government introduced the Support \nProgram to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC) (Decision No. 5613/VPCP-\nQHQT). It created this program specifically to mobilize climate finance from \ninternational  sources  in  support  of  national  climate  change  programs  and \ninfrastructure  investment  projects.  People  consider  the  SP-RCC  to  be  a \nsuccessful program in Viet Nam in terms of the total funding support and the \nlarge number of donors and government agencies involved at both the national \nand the local level.  \n3.2  Renewable Energy Investment in Viet Nam \nFigure 8 shows the value of annual new investment in RE in Viet Nam from 2011 to \n2016. At the beginning of the period covered, the annual investment in the RE industry \nwas a small amount, under $300 million from 2011 to 2015; in 2014, the figure even \ndecreased significantly by 48% compared with the previous year. However, in 2016, \nthere was a noticeable sign when investment soared by a further 130% and stood at \n$682 million, making the total value of the renewable energy industry in Viet Nam until \n2016 $2,355.73 million (Figure 8).

Moreover, in the \nsame year, the value of new RE investment in Viet Nam was equal to that of Singapore \nand Taipei,China but still lower than that of Thailand and the Philippines (Table 2). \nFigure 8: Renewable Energy Investment in Viet Nam (2011\u20132016) \n \nSource: Climatescope (2017). \nTable 2: Renewable Energy Investment in 2016 in Asian Countries \nRenewable Energy  Growth Rate \u2013 % \nInvestment in 2016   (Compared with the \nCriteria  $ Billion  Previous Year) \nThailand  1.4  4% \nPhilippines  1  -47% \nPakistan  0.9  -58% \nSingapore  0.7  1328% \nViet Nam  0.682  143% \nTaipei,China  0.7  -2% \nIndonesia  0.5  84% \nSource: Climatescope (2017). \nIt is noteworthy that, when comparing the entire RE investment value over the years \namong Asian countries, such as Thailand or Indonesia, Viet Nam is only a minor \nplayer.

Surprisingly,  in  2010,  the  values  of  the  \ntwo markets were similar: the value was even slightly higher in Viet Nam. However, \nIndonesia  witnessed  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  subsequent  years;  meanwhile,  \nViet Nam lagged far behind its neighboring nation. At the end of 2016, the accumulated \nvalue of RE investment for Indonesia was $5,643.7 million, which is more than twice \nthat of Viet Nam. \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 9: Accumulated Value of RE Investment in Viet Nam and Indonesia  \n(2010\u20132016) \n \nSource: Climatescope (2017). \nAs estimated by GIZ (2013), the renewable energy tapped in Viet Nam is currently only \n3.4% of the total potential; therefore, the country requires huge capital to unleash it. \nThere has been an explosion of renewable energy investment all over the world, and \nSouth-East Asia is one of the leading regions and has invested a huge amount of \nmoney in RE projects. In 2015 and 2016, the values of new investment for RE in that \nlocation were $3.8 and $2.6 billion, respectively (IRENA 2018).  \nThe  value  of  the  RE  industry\u2019s  investment  in  Viet  Nam  is  negligible  and  not \ncommensurate with the country\u2019s demand to unlock the substantial potential. For a long \ntime, this industry did not receive adequate attention from the government, which \nseems to have neglected it until it issued the revised PDP 7. Viet Nam is a \u201clatecomer\u201d \nin a trending industry and therefore requires stronger commitment from the authorities \nto unleash this huge potential in the future. Without the government\u2019s efforts and \ncommitment to investing in renewable energy, Viet Nam may become an \u201coutsider\u201d of \nthe global investment wave.  \n3.3  Financial Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects  \nin Viet Nam \nRegarding the financial incentives to unlock the RE potential in the country, feed-in \ntariffs are an important component that can help to initiate a surge of renewable energy \nin the market. The regulations below describe the FITs for multiple types of renewable \nenergy sectors in Viet Nam (Table 3). \n   \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nTable 3: Financial Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects \nRenewable \nElectricity  Supporting \nSource  Regulation  Investment Area  Mechanism  Support in Detail \nWind  Decision No.  Electricity  FIT for 20 years  7.8 US cents/Kwh \n37/2011/QD-TTg  production  excluding VAT \n(6/2011) \nBiomass  Decision No.  Electricity  FIT for 20 years  7.551 US cents/KWh \n25/2014/QD-TTg  generation  (north) \n(3/2014)  7.3458 US cents/KWh \n(central) \n7.4846 US cents/KWh \n(south) \nSolid waste  Decision No.  Direct burning  FIT for 20 years  10.5 US cents/KWh \n31/2014/QD-TTg  (south) \n(5/2014)  Landfill for gas  FIT for 20 years  7.28 US cents/KWh \n(south) \n     \nSolar  Decision No.  Grid connection  FIT for 20 years  9.35 US cents/KWh \n11/2017/QD-TTg  generation \n(4/2017) \nSmall hydro  Adjusted annually  Electricity  Avoided cost tariff  ~ 5 US cents/KWh \npower  by MOIT  generation \nSource: Government of Viet Nam (2011, 2014, 2017). \nIn  addition  to  the  FIT,  the  regulations  include  investment  incentives  for  RE \ndevelopments: \n\u2022  Long-Term Standard Power Purchase Agreement (20 yrs PPA). \n\u2022  Income indexed to the exchange rate quoted in US dollars (not for small hydro). \n\u2022  Import duty exemption on equipment: There is an exemption from import duty in \nrespect  of  goods  imported  to  construct  or  form  fixed  assets,  such  as  raw \nmaterials, manufactured materials, and other components. \n\u2022  Corporate income tax exemption and reduction: Income from new investment \nprojects for renewable energy production will be subject to corporate income tax \nat the rate of 10% for the first 15 years.  \n\u2022  Land-related incentives: Investors may be entitled to exemption from the land \nuse  fee  that  would  usually  apply  for  11  years  or,  in  cases  in  which  the \ninvestment project is in a region facing extreme socioeconomic difficulties, 15 \nyears. In addition, during the capital construction period of a project (the period \nof construction of a new building or plant for up to 3 years from the effective \ndate of the land lease contracts), investors are entitled to exemption from land \nrents  and  water  surface  rents.  Furthermore,  the  government  provides  land \nclearance compensation and support in accordance with the Law on Land. The \nrelevant  provincial  People\u2019s  Committees  handle  all  land  leases  and  land \nallocation for renewable power projects. \nDespite the fact that the Viet Nam government adopted a feed-in tariff for multiple types \nof renewable energy (with EVN it has the sole responsibility for buying the whole \nelectric output from renewable power projects), this current subsidized tariff is not \nattractive in comparison with that in other ASEAN countries (for example, wind power\u2019s \nFIT is 19 US cents/kWh in Thailand and 21.8 US cents/kWh in the Philippines).  \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFurthermore, potential foreign producers have raised concerns about the purchasing \nprice, while the current cost of electricity generated from renewable power plants is still \nquite high due to the large technical investment. If the FIT is not increased to regional \nlevels, while there is no clear road map for negotiating the PPA, it will be very difficult to \nattract private investment.  \n3.4  Financial Instruments for Promoting Green Energy \nDeployment in Viet Nam \nOne of the main goals of the Macro Economic Reform, in particular the Green Financial \nSector  Reform  Component,  is  to  set  up  a  green  financial  policy  framework  and  \ncreate green financial instruments to mobilize funding for sustainable development in \nViet Nam via the financial market by implementing innovative financial instruments. The \ngovernment will implement the essential instruments in the financial market to support \nRE development. \n3.4.1  Green Bond for Long-Term Loan Instruments \nAccording to the National Strategy for Green Growth 2011\u20132020 and the vision to \n2050, from 2012, Viet Nam has had an orientation toward green finance and green \nfinancial products for the Viet Nam stock market to create financial resources for green \ngrowth. In the road map for bond market development in 2017\u20132020, with a vision to \n2030 (Decision No. 1191/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister dated 14 August 2017), the \nmechanisms and policies for the distribution of the green bond market aim to enable \nissuers to raise capital through the issuance of bonds to carry out green projects. \nIn  recent  years,  corresponding  ministries  have  implemented  a  large  number  of \nmeasures to support the green bond market, such as guiding enterprises to disclose \ninformation  and  provide  transparency  on  green  finance  activities  and  encouraging \nbusinesses listing on the stock market to publish financial reports and annual reports \nreferring to sustainable development and green development. Ha Noi Stock Exchange \n(HNX) and Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (HOSE) have actively been working on \nmeasures to realize the investment attraction in the green bond market of Viet Nam. At \nthe same time, Viet Nam is actively cooperating with some international organizations \nto issue green bonds. \nTo date, official green bond issuance has not occurred in the Viet Nam bond market \ndue to the need for a revised legal framework and reporting guidelines to support the \ninadequate  level  of  sustainable  growth.  The  limited  application  of  international \nstandards remains, and there are insufficient independent organizations to assess \nsustainable development indicators for companies (such as credit rating agencies that \nhave adequate expertise to provide creditworthiness in term of \u201cgreen business\u201d).  \nHowever, in 2016, in cooperation with the German International Cooperation Agency \n(GIZ), the Ministry of Finance jointly implemented a pilot program to issue green bonds. \nThis is a trial program to prepare for official issuance in the near future. Box 2 below \npresents the details of the pilot project. \n   \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nBox 2: Pilot Project for Green Bond Issuance in Viet Nam \nType of bonds: Local government bonds in two piloted locations: Ho Chi Minh City and Ba \nRia Vung Tau. \nRegarding Ho Chi Minh City \n\u2022  Bond type: green local government bonds \n\u2022  Term of bonds: 15 years  \n\u2022  Total volume: VND 523,5 billion (equal to approximately $24 million) \n\u2022  Usage: Capital from bond issuance was disbursed to 11 green projects in the areas of \nsustainable water management, adaptation to climate change, and sustainable \ninfrastructure. \nRegarding Ba Ria Vung Tau \n\u2022  Bond type: Green local government bond \n\u2022  Term of bonds: 5 years \n\u2022  Total volume: VND 80 billion (equal to $3.7 million) \n\u2022  Usage: Capital from bond issuance was planned for a project related to sustainable \nwater management. \nSource: MOF (2017). \n3.4.2  Green Credit Programs to Facilitate Access to Finance  \nfor RE Projects and Green SMEs in Viet Nam \nIt is important to create an enabling framework that consists of clear and enforceable \nrules, economic incentives, and information. Often banks refrain from lending to certain \ncompanies or sectors \u2013 for example, dedicated green business models focusing on \nrenewable  energy  or  energy  efficiency  \u2013  because  they  are  unwilling  to  or  cannot  \ntake additional risks, especially within the strict banking standard Basel II with higher \nreserves in banks in response to higher risky loans. Traditionally, Vietnamese banks \nhave  lent  to  large  state-owned  enterprises  and  conventional  business  activities, \nmeaning that dealing with new technologies, such as renewable technology projects, is \nstill unfamiliar to many banks.  \nFurthermore,  large-scale  grid-connected  projects  run  by  large  firms  have  so  far \ndominated the RE industry. However, the necessity for the involvement of SMEs in RE \ndevelopment should be reconsidered, since they account for 98% of the total number \nof enterprises (NCIF 2017). SMEs, in fact, may play different roles to ensure that the \ngreening energy plan is achievable for a number of reasons: (1) SMEs will increase the \nenergy efficiency and RE deployment of the whole economy if their business operation \napplies RE technology; (2) they might be outsourcing partners, such as sub-contractors \nor maintenance services for larger RE developers, as well as being part of the clean \nenergy  value  chains.  In  practice,  SMEs  may  actively  be  involved  in  the  small \nequipment  manufacturing  business,  providing  civil  works,  retail,  and  maintenance, \nwhich can have rich potential in waste for energy treatment or biomass.  \nBased on the strategy of the government to support green credit growth, the State \nBank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  drafted  a  pilot  green  credit  program  for  SMEs  with  a  \ntotal  amount  of  approximately  $100  million,  in  which  3  state  commercial  banks \n(Vietcombank, BIDV, and Agribank) as well as 1 private commercial bank (Sacombank) \nparticipated.  To  date,  the  number  of  renewable  energy,  waste  management,  and \norganic agriculture projects receiving loans from that program is 26 (GIZ 2016). The \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \ncost of the loans that the scheme will provide for SMEs will be 1%\u20133% lower than that \nof the market. The SBV will refinance the banks participating in the program at interest \nrates that are 1% lower than usual.  \n3.4.3  Green Index \nIn Viet Nam, a green index is combined with a sustainable index to produce the Green \nand Sustainable Index (VNSI). This index, after a pilot period from January 2017 to July \n2017, became official in Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). The index includes  \n30 top stocks from important sectors and is reassessed annually in July.  \nAfter half a year in operation, according to the HOSE (2018), on 29 December 2017, \nthe VNSI stood at 1,256 (1,000 basis in 7/2017), an increase of 25.6% compared with \nthe basis, which is relatively lower than the other essential indices, such as the VN \nindex or the VN30, with 29.55% and 33.91%, respectively. \nHowever, researchers consider the VNSI to be more stable than others with good \nliquidity until 29 December 2017 of nearly VND1,300 billion, comprising 28% of the \nstock market (HOSE 2018). In addition, regularly updating and revising the set of \nevaluation criteria partly contribute to improving the representativeness and objectivity \nof the VNSI, providing an effective reference tool for investors looking for sustainable \nand green investment. \n4.  MAJOR CHALLENGES IN FINANCING RENEWABLE \nENERGY IN VIET NAM \n4.1  Inappropriate Energy Pricing Policy \nThe  electricity  price  in  Viet  Nam  has  been  highly  regulated  for  a  long  time.  The \ndomestic coal prices are well below the world market prices. There are price ceilings  \nin the refined petroleum markets, as well as the application of various taxes and  \ntax waivers. \nIt might be irrelevant to compare the electricity tariff among different countries due  \nto difficulties in calculating the average for each country, which varies according to  \nthe customer type, volume of electricity used, high demand time of day, and so on. \nNevertheless, not many countries possess such a low average electricity tariff as Viet \nNam. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the electricity prices within the ASEAN region; \nit is apparent that Viet Nam has one of the lowest electricity prices, only higher than \nthose of Myanmar, the Lao PDR, and Brunei Darussalam, and it has almost the same \ntariff as Thailand. \nThe fossil fuel subsidies through the electricity price control place pressure on the state \nbudget, which has been experiencing a long-term deficit and has insufficient funds  \nto invest in other development projects. The subsidies fluctuated between $1.2 billion \nand $4.49 billion per year for the period 2007\u20132012, based on the price gap approach, \nwith the largest component being spent on electricity. After 2012, the total amount of \nsubsidies for energy and electricity gradually decreased and stood at 1.8, 1, 0.2, and \n0.1 ($ billion) in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively (GIZ 2016).  \n   \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 10: Average Power Tariff among the ASEAN Countries (2014)  \n \nSource: GIZ (2016). \nIn the revised PDP 7, with the application of FITs for multiple types of RE projects, the \nforecasted subsidies for power generation in Viet Nam are still significantly increasing \nin volume, as Table 4 illustrates. \nTable 4: Forecasted Subsidies for Power Generation \n  RE Type  2020  2025  2030  2035 \nPower  Solar  3.88  7.62  18.86  24.77 \ngeneration  Wind  4.31  7.97  17.55  55.45 \nBiomass  1.67  5.59  15.67  30.54 \nForecasted  Solar  0.16  0.31  0.77  1.01 \nsubsidies*   Wind  0.11  0.20  0.44  1.39 \n\u2013 billion $ \nBiomass  0.01  0.03  0.08  0.16 \nTotal  0.28  0.54  1.29  2.56 \nNote: (*) A gap between the FIT and the average electricity price that EVN set at the end of 2016. \nSource: Government of Viet Nam (2016b).  \nIn addition to the increase in budget spending, the artificially low price of electricity is \narguably a weak factor in liberalizing and opening the domestic market and one of the \nmost concerning issues that prevents investment from the private sector. Numerous \ninvestors have expressed concerns relating to the bankability of RE projects, as the low \nenergy price does not ensure projects\u2019 proper rate of return when the electricity tariff \nmay not compensate for the production cost. \nBesides the electrification of rural and mountainous areas through the low electricity \ntariff, the Viet Nam government believes that there is a way to increase the economy\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in attracting investment, especially FDI. However, Garg, Bridle, and \nClarke\u2019s (2015) study reported an important finding that Viet Nam\u2019s ability to attract FDI \nis not based on low energy prices as an input for manufacturing. Their survey results \nshowed that firms do not typically invest in Viet Nam to utilize low energy prices. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nInstead, foreign firms highly concern about the sufficiency of the power supply and  \nthe electricity supply\u2019s sustainability. The survey also questioned the respondents to \ndetermine the annual level of nominal power price appreciation over the medium term \nthat would lead them to reconsider future investments in Viet Nam. Of the respondents, \n54% reported that they would be willing to bear annual power price rises of more than \n15%; meanwhile, 67% were willing to pay for sustained price rises of more than 10%. \nThose findings should be a referenced source for the government in reconsidering \nenergy pricing to make it more attractive to private investors.  \n4.2  Non-preferential Feed-In Tariff  \nWhile  some  RE  technologies  are  already  cost-competitive,  almost  all  RE  projects  \nfind it difficult to rival the subsidized conventional energy power generation. In fact,  \nthe  government  does  not  consider  the  negative  externalities  in  traditional  energy \ngeneration, leading to artificially low electricity prices that do not reflect the true cost of \nmanufacturing.  \nThe  feed-in  tariffs  that  the  Viet  Nam  government  offers  to  remedy  this  situation, \nhowever, are arguably not sufficient to ensure RE projects\u2019 bankability; the standard \nelectricity  tariff  is  still  lower  than  the  manufacturing  cost  in  conventional  energy \nprojects,  and  the  cost  is  much  higher  in  RE  projects.  For  example,  in  2011,  the \nweighted average retail electricity price in the country was only US 6 cents/kWh, while \nthe long-run marginal cost was US 9.5 cents/kWh (Nguyen 2012). \n4.3  Undeveloped Financial System That Is Inefficient  \nin Funding Long-Term Loans and Applying \n Innovative Financial Devices \nViet Nam\u2019s financial market is immature, with a small market size and undiversified \nfinancial instrument types. The domestic stock market is small in scale and weak in \nstructure, with a lack of diversity in market commodities. In addition, it has an immature \nbond market structure, in which the government bond segment holds the majority \nmarket  share.  In  2014,  the  government  issued  bonds  up  to  VND  248.024  trillion,  \nwhich is equivalent to 6.24% of the GDP, whilst corporate bonds accounted for only \nVND 22.922 trillion, which equals less than 1% of the GDP. Furthermore, it is difficult to \nissue long-term bonds, since the market prefers short-maturity ones. In 2017, the \nbonds with over a 10-year period only comprised 22% of the total outstanding value of \nbonds issued. Because of the small size of the capital market, financing for businesses \nis heavily reliant on bank credit capital (Banking Strategy Institute 2015).  \nHowever,  funding  via  Viet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system  is  also  challenging  due  to  the \ncommon  view  among  domestic  banks  that  RE  projects  are  a  risky  and  strange \nbusiness.  Although,  Vietnamese  banks  have  been  more  interested  in  their  green \nlending  portfolio  to  date,  the  most  significant  obstacle  that  banks  face  is  their \ninadequate  capacity  for  processing  green  credit  appraisals,  including  the  risk \nassessment and evaluation of new technologies. Green energy lending deals therefore \nhave  often  only  been  successful  with  the  involvement  of  international  financial \ninstitutes,  such  as  ADB  or  the  World  Bank,  or  donors,  such  as  development \norganizations. \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nThe expectation for new and innovative financial vehicles, such as green bonds, is that \nthey  will  provide  an  additional  financial  channel  for  renewable  energy  financing. \nHowever, the not fully developed financial market in Viet Nam seems not to be ready \nwith those types of instruments yet. \nVenture capital is another source of financing for RE deployment. Project finance or the \nstock market should target large-scale RE deployment, including wind power or utility \nscale solar power. Bank funding often focuses on enterprises or business models \nemploying RE technology. Venture capital investors are interested in start-ups in RE \ntransportation, energy storage, and other subsectors in the value chain or supporting \nindustries (Ghosh and Nanda 2010). Notwithstanding the greater development that it \nhas experienced in recent years, Viet Nam\u2019s venture capital is still an infant sector with \na lack of participating angel domestic and foreign investors or private equity funds; the \nlack of supportive regulations from the government also constitutes a key barrier that \nprevents Viet Nam\u2019s venture capital from thriving compared with that of other nations in \nthe region. \n4.4  EVN\u2019s Creditworthiness Concern \nEVN is a giant state-owned enterprise among three SOEs in the energy sector. It \npossesses a robust market share of the energy market and accounts for over 60% of \nthe country\u2019s total electricity generation (World Bank 2016). In the revised PDP 7, the \ngovernment regulated EVN as a major buyer and made it responsible for consuming \nelectricity generated from all RE projects in the country. \nHowever, the financial health status of this SOE raises significant concern for RE \ndevelopers, especially foreign ones. The fact that the energy price is highly controlled \nto be lower than the manufacturing costs means that it is highly likely that EVN will \nmake losses. In 2010 and 2011, it reported more than VND 10,000 billion of losses, \nwhich was equal to $500 million at that time, and the value of debt accounted for  \n85% of the total assets (World Bank 2016). Although there has been a noticeable \nimprovement in EVN\u2019s financial performance since 2012, when it became profitable, \nand Fitch recently ranked it BB for credit rating, equaling the sovereign rating of Viet \nNam (FitchRatings 2018), EVN\u2019s creditworthiness is still an issue.  \nAccording to the Fitch rating agency, the drivers of EVN with the best rating mainly \nderive from its status as a \u201csuper\u201d state-owned enterprise, receiving strong support \nfrom  the  government  (FitchRatings  2018).  Although  the  expectation  is  that  the \ngovernment\u2019s direct support and subsidies will reduce over time, the incentive for the \ngovernment  to  support  EVN  is  apparent  to  increase  its  profitability,  because,  to  \ndate, the guaranteed loan for EVN accounts for 37% of the total value of loans that the \nViet Nam Government guarantees (VietnamFinance 2017). However, with the process \nof  SOEs\u2019  restructuring  and  equitization,  the  tight  linkage  between  EVN  and  the \ngovernment is questionable in the future. \nMoreover, EVN\u2019s financial performance is highly vulnerable, as it is seriously exposed \nto the exchange rate fluctuation, which mainly caused losses in 2011 and 2012 (World \nBank 2016). Figure 11 shows the component of EVN\u2019s total debt by currency; the \npercentage of foreign currency-denominated debt consistently comprised over 60% of \nthe total debt over the period 2007\u20132013 and increased to over 70% in 2017 (World \nBank 2016). If the adverse movement of the VND against the USD and JPY happens \nwith the limitation of domestic market vehicles for hedging exchange rate risk such as \nderivatives, EVN will face a challenge in sustaining its profitability. \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFigure 11: Components of EVN\u2019s Debt by Currency \n \nSource: World Bank (2016). \nFrom 2014 to 2020, EVN demanded investment of $53 million to deal with an increase \nin the energy need, address the shortage of existing power plants, and provide finance \nfor  new  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution,  including  nuclear  and \nrenewable energy projects (World Bank 2016). With its ambitious and unprecedented \nplan for capital expenditure, EVN faces huge pressure in finding long-term funding. At \nthe same time, EVN\u2019s debt structure is unhealthy, since half of it consists of short-term \nloans with maturity of less than 5 years (Figure 11); meanwhile, the assets that EVN \nhas acquired have long lives of up to 25 years. Thus, there is a mismatch between the \nassets and the liabilities of the enterprise. \nUnder the uncertainty of securing its profitability in future, the worry of investors in EVN \nis reasonable regarding how it can create profits in the future and fulfill its responsibility \nthrough payment in full and on time once their RE projects take place. \nFigure 12: Component of EVN\u2019S Debt by Maturity in 2011, 2012, and 2013 \n \nSource: World Bank (2016). \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \nTo  achieve  the  green  growth  strategy  to  which  the  Viet  Nam  government  has \ncommitted, the development of renewable energy is a stepping stone. Allowing the \nintegration of RE into the energy system is beneficial for ensuring national energy \nsecurity in response to the increasing dependence on energy imports. Furthermore, the \nsevere impacts of climate change and local environmental pollution, which are partly \ndue to the exploitation of fossil fuel, require the deployment of alternative sources, \nespecially when Viet Nam is a potentially RE-rich country, particularly in wind power, \nsolar power, and biomass. \nViet Nam is lagging far behind several neighboring countries in investing in non-hydro \nrenewable energy. To be able to meet the annual growth in the energy demand of \n13%, Viet Nam needs huge investments for the green energy sector. However, due to \nthe limitation of the state budget and low-creditworthiness energy SOEs, estimations \nindicate that 50% of the total investment for RE development must come from the \nprivate sector. To attract private investment, the government has offered investment \nincentives such as a FIT and a preferential tax rate and fees. However, those financial \nincentives are unattractive; combined with the low electricity tariff based on subsidies, \nthey question the bankability of RE projects, which require huge initial investment and \nare  vulnerable  to  political  and  environmental  changes.  Underdeveloped  domestic \nfinancial systems with a poor finance infrastructure and limited financial channels for \nattracting long-term loans are another issue. Considering those barriers to financing RE \nprojects in Viet Nam, the authors\u2019 major recommendations are presented below. \n5.1  Revise the Energy Price Policy to Result in a More \nReasonable Energy Price and Feed-In Tariff \nAdopting the market mechanism for electricity price determination and privatization of \nthe power generation and transmission similar to the most recent experience in many \ncountries, such as Japan, and the earlier experience of France would make the power \nmarket more interesting for the private investors in the RE sector as well as sustaining \nthe profitability of EVN. \nThe  artificially  low  electricity  price  in  the  domestic  market  is  one  of  the  most \nunattractive criteria for the participation of the private sector in the RE industry in Viet \nNam. The government should revise the energy pricing to make it more reasonable \nand offer a greater chance for bankable renewable projects; if implemented in terms of \nremoving fossil fuel subsidies, there are debates in the country regarding whether \nincreasing the energy price, particularly electricity, will lead to a negative impact on \nremote areas and vulnerable businesses, such as SMEs. According to the research \nthat Neefjes and Dang (2017) conducted, the advantage of cutting subsidies outweighs \nthe disadvantage in Viet Nam due to the fact that the GDP in general will increase with \nbetter energy efficiency and this in turn will contribute more to social welfare, having a \nlong-term positive impact. Furthermore, low-income households may suffer from the \nenergy price increase but at the same time may enjoy additional revenue if RE projects \nare located in their area. With regard to SMEs, which people believe to be the most \nvulnerable and energy inefficient, a higher electricity price could provide motivation for \nenergy efficiency application, and the gain will be achieved in the long term.  \nThe Government of Viet Nam should have a stronger commitment to creating market-\noriented pricing that would reduce the demand for coal compared with cleaner-burning \nnatural gas and other alternative energy sources. Nguyen (2012), in his research, also \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \naffirmed that the benefit of restructuring the energy price system will exceed the cost by \na wide margin for Viet Nam, since it will provide an opportunity for increasing the social \nwelfare system instead of energy subsidy spending. \nAccording to the World Bank (2016), to ensure financial sustainability for EVN as well \nas creating an attractive energy price to attract investment, the energy price should \nincrease by around 10% per year rather than reflecting the inflation rate with an annual \naverage of below 5%. In the medium term, reforming Viet Nam\u2019s electricity pricing and \ncutting  subsidies  for  fossil  fuel  technologies  will  enable  more  investment  in  RE \ntechnology and allow them to compete equally. \nTo ensure an adequate FIT to encourage investment from the private sector, the \ngovernment  should  revise  the  FITs  for  renewable  energy  generation  projects.  In  \nterms  of  wind  power,  Cuong  and  Dersch  (2014)  stated  that,  with  the  forecasted  \nwind-generated electricity share in the total national energy generation at 0.7% and \n2.4% in 2020 and 2030, respectively, the FIT should increase to $0.104 for onshore \nand $0.112 for near shore. If the government adopts this new FIT, it should trigger fully \nfledged development of the domestic wind industry. For solar power, the proposal for \nthe should-be FIT is 15 US cents/kWh. \n5.2  Increase the Creditworthiness of EVN \nIt  is  notable  that  a  pricing  reform  cannot  work  without  a  reform  of  wide-ranging  \naspects  such  as  reducing  and  gradually  phasing  out  government  subsidies  and \nrestructuring energy SOEs, which require remarkable dedication and commitment from \nthe government. Achieving healthy and profitable business for EVN is also a way to \nincrease the trust of private investors in RE development in Viet Nam. \nMeanwhile, increasing the creditworthiness of EVN in particular and SOEs in general is \na broad issue that involves a wide variety of policy implications. However, the major \naforementioned threats to EVN\u2019s financial stability are the mismatch between debt  \nand assets and the high risk of exchange rate loss. Therefore, with the purpose of \nsustaining profitability, reconstructing the debt portfolio with a proper ratio between \nshort-term and long-term loans is essential. In addition, risk management in terms of \nthe foreign exchange rate risk is crucial in the case that foreign currency-denominated \ndebt remains a major part of the total value of debt. \n5.3  Implement Fiscal Policy Reform Discouraging  \nCO -Intensive Sectors and Facilitating  \n2\nthe Deployment of RE Technology \nFinding a financial source for funding renewable energy projects with a limited budget, \nespecially in developing countries, where the state budget is constrained, is still a \nfundamental problem. One of the major solutions is to design a carbon tax system in \nwhich the taxes collected will refinance green energy technologies. \nYoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2018) argued in their paper that, due to electricity, \nespecially renewable energy, being public goods, to maximize its potential, investing  \nin  infrastructure  projects  is  governments\u2019  responsibility.  Otherwise,  the  investment \nincentives need to be adequate to lure private investment. One of the best practices to \nprovide better incentives for investors is to utilize the spillover effect from the carbon \ntax to reallocate funds to renewable energy projects that the private sector will finance. \nThis fiscal policy via the tax regime will be beneficial for discouraging CO  emissions as \n2\nwell as creating a funding source for renewable energy projects in the country. \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nFor Viet Nam, as indicated in the revised PDP 7, the subsidies for fossil fuel will exceed \n$540 million in 2025 and $2.56 billion in 2030. Thus, it is important to ensure an \nadequate financial source based on the revenue from taxes/fees derived from fossil \nfuel consumption and generation to compensate for the spending. For instance, the \ngovernment could consider imposing a carbon tax of $5/ton on fossil fuels such as \ncoal, oil products, and natural gas based on their consumption levels to create revenue \nfor the Renewable Energy Development Fund to invest back in RE projects. \n5.4  Develop a Wide Range of Financial Vehicles to Facilitate \nLong-Term Finance and Risk Mitigation \nCuong and Dersch (2014) showed that the availability of debt funding is the key to \nunlocking RE investment. They believed that, even if the FIT is amended by a sufficient \nvalue, the lack of adequate long-term-maturity funding with an interest rate below 6% \nstill does not ensure bankable RE wind power-generated projects, which require an \nIRR of 10%. Since 2014, the domestic interest rate for long-maturity loans in the \nbanking system has fluctuated around 6%\u20136.5%, which is affordable for RE financing; \nhowever, historically, the interest rate for long-term maturity loans has climbed to over \n9% (in 2013 and 2014), so maintaining a healthy monetary system to ensure stable \nand predictable interest rates is crucial for attracting RE in the future. \nThe World Bank (2016) indicated that the failure to obtain a proper debt structure for \nEVN  is  a  result  of  the  inadequacy  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  capital  market  rather  than  the \nenterprise\u2019s  competence.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  financial  market  is  currently  underdeveloped  \nand lacks sufficient financial infrastructure. Thus, despite the preparation of financial \ninstruments  to  finance  green  energy  projects,  such  as  green  bonds,  so  far  these \nvehicles  are  not  operational.  To  attract  more  private  sector  involvement  in  green \nenergy development, it is necessary to enhance the functions of the domestic financial \nmarket, especially through a number of key areas: developing the domestic bond \nmarket as a basis for the development of the green bond market for clean energy \nprojects; building and developing investment funds and the venture capital market for \nseed  capital  for  starting  up  RE  development;  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  the \nimplementation of a credit guarantee scheme to provide more concessional loans and \nincrease access to finance for RE projects as well as green SMEs; building up credit \nrating agencies with a high capacity to conduct credit appraisal of energy projects; and \nstrengthening the capacity of financial and banking institutions to fund RE energy \nprojects via effective and efficient lending appraisal. \nIn  addition  to  relying  on  the  banking  system  for  long-term  financing,  introducing \npension funds for bringing in long-term finance might also be a practical solution. In the \nbank-dominated financial system of Viet Nam, with a relatively high interest rate and a \nsignificant amount of non-performing loans (NFSC 2017), and due to banks\u2019 limitation \nin entering the RE energy sector due to the Basel Capital Accord, many banks are  \nnot showing an interest in financing RE projects. In this situation, pension funds and \ninsurance  companies  could  provide  an  alternative,  as  they  hold  long-term  money  \n(20 years, 30 years, and 40 years) that is appropriate for long-term lending to the RE \nsector. On the other hand, Viet Nam does not have a pension fund system; due to the \naging population that the country will face in the future, the development of a strong \npension fund system will secure future social security payments and at the same time \nprovide long-term financing for those sectors that are seeking it, such as the RE sector, \nalong with a high return. \n   \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 886  Nguyen, Chuc, and Dang \n \nREFERENCES \nBanking Strategy Institute. 2015.

To sustain these achievements including addressing gradually depleted domestic resources, keeping pace with growing energy demand from the energy-intensive economy, and meeting ambitious climate change targets under the nationally determined contributions in the Paris Agreement, large sums of new investment are needed, particularly in renewables. Without these investments, Viet Nam will increasingly rely on imported coal to cater to its future energy needs, with substantial negative environmental, health, climate change, and economic consequences.
