Higher external demand, rebounding global commodity prices, \nand domestic reform support widespread acceleration, with growth \npickingup in two-thirds of the region\u2019s 45 economies. Developing Asia \nwill continue to be the largest regional contributor to global growth, \neven with growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nits largest economy.\nConsumption expenditure last year drove growth at 6.7% in \nthe PRC, where the authorities are rebalancing the economy to rely \nmore on domestic demand than exports. This is expected to temper \ngrowth further to 6.5% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018, with the government \nprioritizing financial and fiscal stability. While the forecast is for slower \ngrowth in East Asia, all other subregions will see growth accelerate in \nthe near term. \nIn South Asia, India moderated to 7.1% growth in 2016 as fixed \ninvestment stalled and the demonetization of large banknotes \ntemporarily stymied cash-reliant commerce. As reform gains \nmomentum, it is spurring investor confidence, and the economy is \nexpected to rebound to higher growth at 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2018. \nAn expected recovery in global fuel and food prices will benefit \ncommodity producers in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific. \nYet rises for commodities will be too modest to endanger price stability. \nWhile regional inflation is projected to accelerate to 3.0% in 2017 and \n3.2% in 2018, these rates remain well below the region\u2019s 10-year average \nof 3.9%.\nProspects for developing Asia are supported by improving fortunes \nfor the major industrial economies in the United States, the euroarea, \nand Japan. Yet uncertain policy direction in these economies, \nincludingthe pace of interest rate normalization in the US, poses \nrisks to the region\u2019s outlook. While short-term risks are manageable, \npolicymakers need to monitor developments closely and intervene \ndecisively ifwarranted. \nWhen the Asian Development Bank opened its doors in 1966, most \nof the region\u2019s citizens lived in low-income economies. Since then, \ncumulative national development efforts have transformed the region. \nToday, with most economies having successfully climbed the income \nladder\u2014including the most populous economies in the PRC, India, and \nIndonesia\u2014roughly 95% of the population lives in a middle-income \neconomy. The development challenge now is to climb one more rung to \nhigh income.", "History has shown this last rung to be a reach. The key is to \nmove from a basic development model that drives growth by applying \nmore factors of production\u2014land, labor, and capital\u2014toward a more \nsophisticated model that emphasizes catalyzing the productivity of all \nfactors. The Asian Development Outlook 2017 special chapter points to \nthe nexus of innovation, human capital, and infrastructure to boost \nproductivity. Innovation enables the development of a diverse and \nsophisticated product mix. Investment in human capital helps workers \nmeet emerging workplace needs, and investment in infrastructure \nfacilitates structural change. \nWe at the Asian Development Bank take pride in our role supporting \nthe region\u2019s transformation over the past 50 years. But we cannot \nbe complacent. Several challenges remain and new challenges have \nemerged in Asia. As governments adapt their development paradigms \nto sustain growth and eliminate the poverty that remains along the \npath to high income, we will adapt to help our clients meet their \nnewchallenges.\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nAsian Development Outlook 2017 was prepared by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, \nEastAsia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional Economic \nOutlook Task Force, which met regularly to coordinate and develop \nconsistent forecasts for the region.\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each \nchapter.

The region is forecast to expand by 5.7% \nin 2017 and 2018, nearly the 5.8% growth achieved in 2016, as moderation in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is balanced by a healthy pickup in most other \neconomies in the region. \nIn\ufb02ation revived to 2.5% in 2016 on the back of strong consumer demand and \nrebounding global commodity prices. The pace will accelerate further to 3.0% \nin 2017 and 3.2% in 2018, still below the average rate for the past 10 years.\nThe region faces risks from uncertain policy direction in the advanced \neconomies, including the pace of interest rate normalization in the \nUnited States. While short-term risks seem manageable, regional policy makers \nshould remain vigilant to respond to possible spillover through capital \ufb02ows and \nexchange rate movements. \nDecades of rapid growth transformed developing Asia from a low-income \nregion to middle income. Sustaining growth to power the transition into high \nincome will depend on much greater improvement to productivity. Innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure are the three pillars of productivity growth. \nSupportive institutions and policies, underpinned by macroeconomic stability, \ncan strengthen all three pillars. Asia\u2019s dynamic track record suggests that the \njourney to high income, while challenging, is achievable.\nYYaassuuyyuukkii  SSaawwaaddaa\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank", "xii Asian Development Outlook 2017\nSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\nAsia tacks to shifting headwinds\n(cid:31) Continued expansion helps developing Asia deliver more than 60% of global \ngrowth. Gross domestic product (GDP) for the region as a whole is expected to grow by \n5.7% in 2017 and 2018, a tick down from the 2016 outcome of 5.8% as the controlled \nmoderation of growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is balanced by expected \nhealthy growth elsewhere. Excluding the high-income newly industrialized economies\u2014\nthe Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, China\u2014regional growth \nis expected to reach 6.3% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018. Growth is picking up in 30 of the \n45 economies in developing Asia, supported by higher external demand and rebounding \nglobal commodity prices.\n\u00bb The industrial economies are gathering some growth momentum. After slowing \nin the \ufb01rst half of 2016, the euro area, Japan, and the United States are forecast \nto grow collectively by 1.9% in both 2017 and 2018. Recovery in the US is solid as \nunemployment has declined to 4.7%, and as consumer and business con\ufb01dence \nsoar, but con\ufb01dence depends on the policy directions under the new administration. \nIntheeuro area as well, recovery is evident but more fragile in light of the uncertain \nfuture of the economic union. In Japan, the recovery will continue but may lose some \nsteam unless export growth maintains its new momentum.\n\u00bb The PRC continues to rebalance, depending more on consumption to drive \ngrowth. A further shift of economic activity from industry to services shows \nrebalancing progressing as planned. Growth in the PRC now relies more on \ninternaldemand and less on exports. Moderate deceleration of growth to 6.5% is \nexpected in 2017, within the government\u2019s target range, and further to 6.2% in2018. \nTheauthorities are likely to emphasize the maintenance of \ufb01nancial and \ufb01scal \nstability and accept the cost of marginally lower growth. \n\u00bb India\u2019s expansion will bounce back from a temporary liquidity squeeze.\nThedecision to demonetize high-denomination banknotes in November 2016 \nquelled cash-intensive economic activity, but the impact is expected to be \nshortlived. Government deregulation and reform of taxes on goods and services, \namong other areas, should improve con\ufb01dence and thus business investment and \ngrowth prospects. Growth is expected to edge up to 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2018.\n\u00bb Growth in Southeast Asia is forecast to accelerate further. After rising \n0.1percentage points to 4.7% in 2016, growth will continue to improve to 4.8% \nin 2017 and 5.0% in 2018, with nearly all Southeast Asian economies showing an \nupward trend. Recovery for global food and fuel prices and in agricultural output will \nhelp commodity producers such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. Indonesia, \nthe largest economy in the subregion, should see \ufb01scal and structural reforms boost \ndomestic demand.\n\u00bb Prospects for Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c rise along with commodity prices.\nHigher oil prices will support \ufb01scal spending in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and \none-off currency depreciation in these economies has already improved net exports. \nGrowth in Central Asia is projected to accelerate to 3.1% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018, ", "Highlights xiii\nthough individual economies are growing at signi\ufb01cantly different rates. Inthe \nPaci\ufb01c, rising commodity prices are taking some pressure off a \ufb01scal crunch in \nPapua NewGuinea. With Fiji and Vanuatu recovering from natural disasters suffered \nin2015, the Paci\ufb01c subregion as a whole will grow by 2.9% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018.\n(cid:31) Strong consumer demand and rising global commodity prices will boost in\ufb02ation. \nAfter rising 0.3 percentage points to 2.5% in 2016, regional in\ufb02ation is projected to \naccelerate further to 3.0% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. The pickup also re\ufb02ects the \ntemporary effects of the large devaluations in some Central Asian economies. Overall, \nprice rises are still reasonable, below the 10-year average of 3.9%, and unlikely to alter \nAsian expectations of relatively stable prices.\n(cid:31) The region\u2019s current account surplus will narrow even as exports recover. As a share \nof world GDP, developing Asia\u2019s current account surplus is forecast to narrow from 0.7% \nin 2016 to less than 0.5% in both 2017 and 2018. Recent data suggest improved exports \nfrom many Asian economies, particularly traditional exporters of manufactured goods, \nyet the recovery in imports is even stronger. At the same time, though, rebalancing is \nprogressing in the PRC as it relies more on private consumption for growth. \n(cid:31) Uncertain policy directions abroad could undermine the regional outlook.\nWhile baseline assumptions have factored in gradual increases in US interest rates, \nsharper-than-expected US monetary tightening could have further consequences for \ndeveloping Asia. Economies in the region with high corporate or household debt would \nbe particularly vulnerable to \ufb01nancial shock. Possible shifts in trade and tax policies, \nespecially policy changes being discussed in the US, could create uncertainty for business \ninvestment and export growth in developing Asia. While a potential boon to the region\u2019s \noil importers, weaker-than-expected oil price trends could delay recovery in oil and gas \nexporters in Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c.\nRisk of sharper US interest rate hikes\n(cid:31) The US Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates sharply. As Asia braces \nfor higher US interest rates, the question is how much higher? A recent surge in \nUSin\ufb02ation may accelerate the tightening cycle for interest rates that is now under way. \nHowever, interest rate increases sharper than the expected gradual rise would have to \nbe accompanied by more acceleration in US economic growth than is currently forecast. \nSuch a scenario could be envisaged under a possible \ufb01scal stimulus later in 2017, but \neven then, any pickup in US growth would take time to materialize.\n(cid:31) The consequences would differ across Asia depending on exchange rate regime. \nUS monetary tightening would put pressure on Asian currencies to depreciate against \nthe dollar, but the impact would depend on how the exchange rate is managed. \nAbsentmonetary policy response from regional authorities, economies with more \nopen capital accounts would tend to experience deeper currency depreciation. \nEconomieswhere the authorities intervene to maintain a stable currency would tend to \nforfeit export price competitiveness to those with more \ufb02exible exchange rate regimes. \nHowever, in\ufb02ation could intensify under \ufb02exible arrangements, imperiling domestic \nmacroeconomic stability. In this case, the authorities might \ufb01nd it necessary to tighten \ndomestic liquidity to contain pressures on exchange rates and consumer prices.", "xiv Asian Development Outlook 2017\nCapital \ufb02ows and \ufb01nancial risks\n(cid:31) Economies in emerging Asia are already experiencing net capital out\ufb02ows.\nThePRC drives the overall direction of \ufb02ows in the region, and out\ufb02ows from its banking \nactivities and portfolio investments generated net out\ufb02ows of $35 billion beginning in \nthe secondquarter of 2014 that expanded to exceed $130 billion in the third quarter \nof 2016. Evenforeign direct investment has turned to net out\ufb02ow since the second half \nof 2015 as PRC investment abroad has risen and in\ufb02ows declined. Despite the negative \ntrend in net \ufb02ows overall, some variation persists, with India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam \nnotable among those still capitalizing on net in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment. \n(cid:31) Net out\ufb02ow from economies in emerging Asia is expected to continue next year.\nAsthe global economy starts to pick up, uncertainty will become a key theme for \ninvestors in 2017. Continuing US economic improvement, as marked by normalization of \nits monetary policy, will be a pull factor for capital to \ufb02ow out of the region. Other major \nrisks to \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia are policy and political uncertainty in the US \nand the euro area, as well as possible further currency depreciation in the PRC.\n(cid:31) Global liquidity conditions mitigate the risk of destabilizing capital out\ufb02ows.\nAlthough US monetary policy normalization raises the prospect of out\ufb02ows from \ndeveloping Asia, the continuation of accommodative monetary policies in other \nadvanced economies limits the tightening of overall global liquidity. Since this eases the \npressure on central banks to raise interest rates to manage capital movements, they still \nretain some scope for supporting the region\u2019s growth momentum.\n(cid:31) One risk is mounting household debt in some Asian economies. The ratio of debt to \nGDP has surged in several economies, notably rising in the Republic of Korea from 74% \nin late 2008 to nearly 91% in the third quarter of 2016, and to about 71% in Malaysia \nand Thailand. So far the risk from high household leverage in the region is contained \nby favorable growth and employment conditions, fairly stable asset prices, and well \ncapitalized banking sectors with low nonperforming loan ratios. However, there is scope \nto further bolster macroprudential policy, such as tightening ratios of debt to income and \nof loans to asset values. Policy makers may also have to stress-test their banking sectors \nregularly to track bank exposure and identify needs for special reserves. They may have \nto intervene more decisively in housing markets as well to cool speculative demand and \nhead off asset bubbles.", "Highlights xv\nOutlook by subregion\n(cid:31) Average growth in developing Asia slows, upstaging higher projections for most \neconomies. Growth is forecast to accelerate in two-thirds of the region\u2019s economies and \nin all of the subregions except East Asia. The external environment generally supports \ngrowth. A projected mild rise in commodity prices will help oil and gas exporters but \nnot at the expense of importers. Demand for the region\u2019s exports in general will bene\ufb01t \nfrom an expected pickup in the major industrial economies and the Russian Federation. \nHowever, country-speci\ufb01c factors still generate considerable diversity in expected growth \nand in\ufb02ation across the region. \n(cid:31) East Asia\u2019s growth slowdown re\ufb02ects continued moderation in the PRC. Subregional \ngrowth dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 6.0% in 2016. The PRC slowed to 6.7% \ndespite \ufb01scal and monetary support as private investment weakened. Growth also \ndipped in Mongolia as construction faltered and in Hong Kong, China as tourist arrivals \ndropped. The rate is projected to moderate further in the PRC to 6.5% this year and \n6.2% next as structural reform continues and the authorities emphasize \ufb01nancial \nstability. Thiswill push the subregional average down to 5.8% in 2017 and 5.6% in2018. \nYetlarge government outlays will lift growth in Taipei,China and Hong Kong, China \nthisyear and the next.

Subregional growth dropped \nby 0.5 percentage points to 6.7% in 2016 on account of slowing growth in India. \nDespitestronger government consumption and external demand, growth faltered in \nIndia to 7.1% from 7.9% in 2015 as \ufb01xed investment languished and demonetization \ntemporarily stymied commerce. Growth in South Asia is forecast to rebound to 7.0% \nin 2017 and pick up further to 7.2% in 2018. India will see growth reaccelerate to 7.4% \nin \ufb01scal 2017 and 7.6% in 2018 despite drag caused by excessive corporate investment \nin the past and bank lending currently constrained by a heavy load of stressed assets. \nElsewhere, growth will be lifted by spending on earthquake reconstruction in Nepal, \nhydropower investment and output in Bhutan, and economic corridor investment from \nthe PRC in Pakistan. In\ufb02ation in South Asia has trended lower in recent years, easing \nto 4.6% in 2016 as buyers bene\ufb01ted from low prices for oil and other commodities. \nWiththese prices turning upward over the forecast period, in\ufb02ation is projected to revive \nto 5.2% in 2017 and 5.4% in 2018. \n(cid:31) Southeast Asian prospects brighten with buoyant growth across the subregion. \nEconomic expansion accelerated by 4.7% in 2016, up by 0.1 percentage points from \nthe previous year, as growth edged higher in several larger economies: Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Thailand. With normal weather supporting agriculture and \nsteady recovery in the major industrial economies boosting exports, growth will pick \nup in nearly all of the economies in the subregion, nudging average growth to 4.8% \nin 2017 and 5.0% in 2018. The only exception is the Philippines, where growth will \nmoderate from its record 6.8% in 2016 to a pace approximating 6.5% this year and next. \nWhilehigher infrastructure investment will provide an additional impetus to growth in \nBrunei Darussalam, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, ", "xvi Asian Development Outlook 2017\nand Thailand, record foreign direct investment will be a key factor supporting growth \nin VietNam. Strengthening growth and rising international oil prices will mean higher \nin\ufb02ation and a narrower current account surplus for the subregion. Average in\ufb02ation is \nforecast to rise from 2.1% in 2016 to 3.3% this year, edging up further to 3.5% next year. \n(cid:31) Central Asia looks forward to a modest growth rebound. Continued low oil prices, \nrecession in the Russian Federation, and weakness in other trading partners cut growth \nin Central Asia to 2.1% in 2016 from 3.1% a year earlier. Declining oil revenues hit \nAzerbaijan and Kazakhstan particularly hard, with the former falling into recession. \nAnticipated recovery for international oil prices and for growth in the Russian Federation \nare projected to boost expansion in the subregion to 3.1% in 2017. Growth will accelerate \nfurther to 3.5% in 2018 as every economy except Kazakhstan improves its performance. \nThe lagged effects of currency depreciation in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and to a lesser \nextent in Tajikistan, stoked in\ufb02ation by almost 5 percentage points to 11.1% in 2016, even \nas in\ufb02ation slowed in Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and \nsank into de\ufb02ation in Armenia. As the effects from currency depreciation abate, in\ufb02ation \nis projected to decelerate to 7.8% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018. \n(cid:31) The Paci\ufb01c will see growth revive on developments in Papua New Guinea. Growth \nslowed substantially to 2.6% in 2016 as contraction hit the oil and gas sector in Papua \nNew Guinea, slashing the growth rate in the subregion\u2019s predominant economy by \n10.0 percentage points to 2.0%. Elsewhere, growth picked up in 2016 in most Paci\ufb01c \neconomies\u2014by more than 4 percentage points in Nauru, Samoa, and Vanuatu. Increased \nmining and agriculture output is forecast to spur a mild recovery in Papua New Guinea, \nwhich will translate into a modest rebound for the subregion to 2.9% growth this year \nand 3.3% next. Steady or slower growth is expected in most other economies, with \ndeclines in public expenditure inducing relatively sharp slowdowns in Nauru, Samoa, \nand Timor-Leste. Although in\ufb02ation eased in most economies in 2016, the aggregate \nin\ufb02ation rate rose by 0.6 percentage points to 4.6%, driven by rising consumer prices \nin Papua New Guinea. Rising oil and food prices will push in\ufb02ation higher in most of \nthe economies this year. Subregional in\ufb02ation is expected to be 5.2% in 2017 and 5.4% \nin2018.", "Highlights xvii\nTranscending the middle-income challenge\nSustaining growth at middle income\n(cid:31)  Rapid growth has lifted most economies in developing Asia to middle income. \nThe rise of Asia\u2019s newly industrialized economies in the 1970s and 1980s was well \ndocumented. Less publicized was that more than 90% of the people in the region still \nlived in low-income economies in 1991, half again the global average of less than 60%. \nBy2015, the story had changed. Propelled by the rising fortunes of the most populous \nAsian economies\u2014the PRC, India, and Indonesia\u2014more than 95% of the population \nlived in middle-income economies. The question now is how a largely middle-income \nregion can build on its past success.\n(cid:31)  Global experience suggests that the jump to high income can be difficult. Therapid \ntransition of the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, which moved from middle income \nto high in barely a quarter of a century, raised hopes for the region\u2019s current middle-\nincome cohort. However, the experience of most developing economies globally \nthreatens to put these hopes on hold. Brazil and Colombia, for example, have been \nmiddle income for more than half a century. Middle-income economies face a difficult \ntask in sustaining growth sufficiently to clear the hurdle to high income.\n(cid:31)  As economies evolve from low to middle income, so do their growth drivers. \nWhileaccumulating physical and human capital remains important for growth in middle-\nincome economies, these economies have already signi\ufb01cantly expanded their stocks \nof both. The median number of years of schooling for middle-income economies is 6.1, \nmore than double the 2.5 years for low-income economies. Similarly, middle-income \neconomies have more capital per worker and better-developed \ufb01nancial systems than do \nlow-income economies. Total factor productivity improvement, or growth in production \nnot derived from higher use of inputs, plays a bigger role in growth for middle-income \neconomies, particularly those successfully reaching high income.\n(cid:31)  The successful middle-income growth model emphasizes productivity. Innovation \nbecomes more important when economies already reap the bene\ufb01ts of efficiently using \nexisting resources. Even as they accumulate more physical and human capital, the focus \nshifts to areas with more positive productivity spillover, like advanced infrastructure and \nhigher education. Finally, the whole process must be underpinned by a supportive policy \nenvironment and a stable macroeconomic environment.\nInnovation for diversifying and upgrading production\n(cid:31)  Innovation matters more as economies approach the technological frontier. \nAmore central role in productivity growth falls to innovation with the decline of other \nsources, such as labor\u2019s migration from agriculture to manufacturing. Middle-income \neconomies that have graduated to high income have more than 2.5 times the research \nand development stock per worker as other middle-income economies. Risk-taking \nentrepreneurs take the lead in fostering innovation, and these individuals respond \nto incentives that are either strengthened or weakened by economic policies and \ninstitutions. Governments can promote innovative entrepreneurship through stronger \nintellectual property protection and rule of law, better access to \ufb01nance, and effective \ncompetition policies. ", "xviii Asian Development Outlook 2017\n(cid:31) Entrepreneurship turns new ideas or technology into innovation-based growth.\nAs economies become more sophisticated, opportunity-driven entrepreneurship, which \nis often built on new ideas or technology, increasingly outweighs necessity-driven \nentrepreneurship, which responds to existing market needs. The ratio of opportunity-\ndriven to necessity-driven entrepreneurship is 1.6 times higher in high-income \neconomies than in middle-income ones. Therefore, to reach high income, middle-income \neconomies should encourage and nurture new business entries that pursue new business \nopportunities and provide products or services novel to the market. \n(cid:31) Graduation to high income requires a diverse and sophisticated product mix. \nInaddition to producing a wider range of goods, middle-income economies must aim to \nproduce more complex goods, such as sophisticated machinery and modern chemicals \nand alloys, that support higher productivity and better wages. Noteworthy is the \nexperience of the PRC, which ranked for product complexity at only 48 in the mid-1990s \nbut at 19 in 2014. Enhanced human capital is the foundation for a transition to a more \ndiverse and complex product mix.\nHuman capital for emerging marketplace needs\n(cid:31) Human capital accumulation can promote both growth and equity. Estimates \nindicate that a 20% increase in human capital spending per capita can raise labor \nproductivity by up to 3.1% and narrow labor income inequality by up to 4.5%. Thebonus \nin income growth is more salient among poorer families, which may explain the income-\nequalizing effect. Public education in particular enhances equity, yet some regional \neconomies spend less per child than other economies at the same income. Evidence \nshows that higher public spending on education need not harm public \ufb01nances. \nAugmented labor incomes expand the tax base and hence tax revenues. Finally, \nasregional populations age, enhancing worker quality can help compensate for the \nshrinking share of the working-age population. \n(cid:31) The emphasis needs to be on ramping up the quality of education. Increasing the \naverage years of schooling a young person receives can boost growth but less so than \nimproving the quality of education and enhancing cognitive skills like math and science. \nEconomies with relatively high cognitive skills bene\ufb01t from having a critical mass of \nstudents likely to become innovators. Research indicates that, as economies move \ncloser to the technological frontier, the returns on research-oriented innovation pick up \ntangibly. Consequently, middle-income Asia needs to strengthen its research-oriented \neducation while sustaining its achievements in basic education. \n(cid:31) Middle-income economies need to close education gaps with high-income \neconomies. While differences in educational attainment remain substantial, especially \nin tertiary education, gaps in the quality of education offered by different education \nsystems are spectacular. In globally standardized math and science tests, the proportion \nof top-performing 15-year-old students in the advanced economies is on average \n4\u20135times the proportion in middle-income economies, while the share of low \nperformers in middle-income economies is more than 2 times the advanced average. \nAnexception like Viet Nam, which ranks at 8 among the 72 economies covered, appears \nto demonstrate that the gap can be closed with sound education policies.", "Highlights xix\nInfrastructure investment for facilitating structural change\n(cid:31) Economies prioritize different types of infrastructure as they develop.\nADBreported this year that developing Asia has large investment needs across all \ntypes of infrastructure\u2014from water supply and sanitation to transport, power, and \ntelecommunications. But infrastructure needs shift as an economy becomes more \ncomplex and sophisticated. Low-income economies focus \ufb01rst on such basic needs \nas water supply, sanitation, and a transportation network to get goods and people to \nmarket. As basic needs are met and economic structures evolve, more importance is \nattached to electricity supply and advanced infrastructure such as information and \ncommunicationtechnology.\n(cid:31) Advanced infrastructure can help sustain growth in middle-income economies. \nThefastest-growing middle-income economies differ from their slower-growing peers in \na couple of important ways. They invest more in infrastructure and tend to have more of \ncertain types of infrastructure. Mobile telephone and broadband networks, for example, \nare vital tools for creating and disseminating knowledge. Middle-income economies \nthat graduate to high income have 18 more internet users and 31 more mobile phone \nsubscriptions per 100 people than their peers. Investment in advanced infrastructure can \nboost growth by promoting both innovation and human capital. The nexus of advanced \ninfrastructure, highly developed skills, and innovation can help sustain growth enough to \nensure a successful transition to high income.\n(cid:31) Investment in infrastructure boosts output, not least in middle-income economies. \nAnalysis using a sample of developing economies shows that a one-time increase in \npublic infrastructure investment that equals 1.0% of GDP immediately lifts output \nby 0.3% of GDP and by nearly 1.2% after 7 years. Notably, this signi\ufb01cantly positive \neffect, both in the short term and over the long run, is still robust when the sample is \nnarrowed to middle-income economies. This underscores the potential bene\ufb01ts of an \ninfrastructure push.\nReaching toward high income\n(cid:31) Sound policies and institutions are vital to transformative growth. The role of \ngovernment necessarily evolves as an economy progresses, becoming more nuanced \nas the private sector develops. Government must shape an environment conducive to \ninnovative entrepreneurship by promoting investment in education and infrastructure. \nAsshown by Thailand\u2019s successful experience with industry\u2013government coordination \nin the automobile industry, direct government intervention can, if selective and well \ntargeted, foster an output mix that is more diverse and sophisticated. The case for \nintervention is stronger when a government has adequate institutional capacity. \n(cid:31) An environment conducive to growth needs macroeconomic stability. Empirical \nestimates show that when a country reaches middle income, its growth rate is more \nvulnerable to indicators affecting macroeconomic stability\u2014such as whether the country \nfaces a banking or currency crisis, the extent of capital in\ufb02ows other than foreign \ninvestment, and government debt as a share of GDP. The region should continue to \nprotect macroeconomic stability, as it has done very well in the past. ", "xx Asian Development Outlook 2017\n(cid:31) Sustaining rapid growth is not easy but is within reach for middle-income Asia. \nMany norms that served the region well at low income, such as macroeconomic stability \nand high investment, still serve it well at middle income. At the same time, the pattern \nof growth will have to evolve if Asia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high \nincome. In particular, education, innovation, and infrastructure all have vital roles to play. \nThe region\u2019s dynamic track record encourages optimism that governments can adapt \ntheir growth models to meet the middle-income challenge.", "Highlights xxi\nGDP growth rate and inflation, % per year\nGrowth rate of GDP  Inflation \n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nCentral Asia 5.2 3.1 2.1 3.1 3.5 59 6.3 11.1 7.8 7.3\nArmenia 3.6 3.0 0.2 2.2 2.5 3.0 3.7 \u20131.4 1.2 1.8\nAzerbaijan 2.8 1.1 \u20133.8 \u20131.1 1.2 1.4 4.0 12.4 9.0 8.0\nGeorgia 4.6 2.9 2.7 3.8 4.5 3.1 4.0 2.1 4.2 4.5\nKazakhstan 4.2 1.2 1.0 2.4 2.2 6.7 6.6 14.6 8.0 7.0\nKyrgyz Republic 4.0 3.9 3.8 3.0 3.5 7.5 6.5 0.4 5.0 4.0\nTajikistan 6.7 6.0 6.9 4.8 5.5 6.1 5.1 6.1 8.0 7.0\nTurkmenistan 10.3 6.5 6.2 6.5 7.0 6.0 6.4 6.0 6.0 6.0\nUzbekistan 8.1 8.0 7.8 7.0 7.3 9.1 8.5 8.4 9.5 10.0\nEast Asia 6.6 6.1 6.0 5.8 5.6 19 1.3 1.9 2.3 2.6\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 7.3 6.9 6.7 6.5 6.2 2.0 1.4 2.0 2.4 2.8\nHong Kong, China 2.8 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.1 4.4 3.0 2.4 2.0 2.1\nKorea, Rep. of 3.3 2.6 2.7 2.5 2.7 1.3 0.7 1.0 1.7 1.8\nMongolia 7.9 2.4 1.0 2.5 2.0 12.8 6.6 1.1 3.5 3.9\nTaipei,China 4.0 0.7 1.5 1.8 2.2 1.2 \u20130.3 1.4 1.3 1.2\nSouth Asia 6.7 7.2 6.7 7.0 7.2 6.3 4.9 4.6 5.2 5.4\nAfghanistan 1.3 0.8 2.0 2.5 3.0 4.7 \u20131.5 4.5 5.5 5.8\nBangladesh 6.1 6.6 7.1 6.9 6.9 7.3 6.4 5.9 6.1 6.3\nBhutan 4.0 6.1 6.4 8.2 9.9 9.6 6.6 3.3 4.9 5.4\nIndia 7.2 7.9 7.1 7.4 7.6 6.0 4.9 4.7 5.2 5.4\nMaldives 6.0 2.8 3.4 3.8 4.1 2.1 1.0 0.5 2.1 2.3\nNepal 5.7 2.3 0.8 5.6 5.4 9.1 7.2 9.9 6.0 6.5\nPakistan 4.1 4.0 4.7 5.2 5.5 8.6 4.5 2.9 4.0 4.8\nSri Lanka 5.0 4.8 4.4 5.0 5.0 3.3 3.8 4.0 6.0 6.0\nSoutheast Asia 4.6 4.6 4.7 4.8 5.0 4.1 2.8 2.1 3.3 3.5\nBrunei Darussalam \u20132.5 \u20130.4 \u20132.5 1.0 2.5 \u20130.2 \u20130.4 \u20130.7 0.1 0.1\nCambodia 7.1 7.0 7.0 7.1 7.1 3.9 1.2 3.0 3.4 3.5\nIndonesia 5.0 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.3 6.4 6.4 3.5 4.3 4.5\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Others agree that Fed\u2019s current policy is behind \nthe curve but base their assessment on the Taylor Rule. Introduced \nin Taylor(1993), it describes a likely policy rate given the deviation of \nin\ufb02ation from its target, the neutral interest rate (the equilibrium real \ninterest rate when the economy is operating at its potential), and the \ndeviation of output from its potential or trend.\nFed policy makers have repeatedly countered that their monetary \npolicy is responsive to data. Some observers agree. In an historical \nanalysis of error in forecasts of the Fed funds rate, Nechio and \nRudebusch (2016) argued that the rates set by the Fed in 2016 were not \nunusually low relative to what was projected at the end of 2015. That is, \nthe distance between the policy rate and its higher projection appears \nto be consistent with what the Fed has done historically in response \nto evolving economic data.

The Asia Bond Monitor (ADB 2017) \nidenti\ufb01es three potential risks to Asia\u2019s \ufb01nancial stability. First, a \npickup in the global economy, particularly in the US, and uncertainty \nsurrounding the global economic landscape will become a key theme \nfor investors in 2017. Second, policy and political uncertainty in the \nUS and the euro area may in\ufb02uence the global economic outlook and \nbecome a key risk to \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia. Third, although \nunlikely, a sharp depreciation of the PRC renminbi would pose a risk to \neconomies and \ufb01nancial markets elsewhere in emerging East Asia.\nHigher US interest rates may exert further downward pressure \non local currencies. Although many regional authorities are adopting \na wait-and-see approach and keeping their monetary policy stable, \nworsening depreciation pressures may push central banks to tighten \ntheir domestic monetary stance. Because many emerging Asian \neconomies have accumulated substantial foreign and local currency debt \nin the low-interest-rate environment prevailing since the global \ufb01nancial \ncrisis, the possible tightening of monetary policy could undermine their \n\ufb01nancial stability. Higher domestic interest rates may also add pressure \non highly leveraged households in Asia (see below). Nevertheless, solid \neconomic prospects and sufficient international reserves should cushion \nthe impact of possible shocks. \nEmerging Asia faces uncertainty concerning the domestic monetary \nstance of many economies that have lowered policy rates over the past \n2 years to support investment and growth. Tighter monetary policy in \nthe US may affect these economies, especially those with open capital \naccounts and \ufb02exible exchange rate regimes. If currency depreciation \naccelerates, central banks may want to follow the Fed in tightening \npolicy. Policy rates in emerging Asia have historically been strongly \ncorrelated as common external shocks elicited parallel responses, \nand now with growing regional integration. Rising interest rates may \nadversely affect liquidity across the region. At the same time, the \nauthorities in emerging Asia may want to delay monetary tightening to \nmaintain growth momentum. Although emerging Asia faces risks from \nan uncertain liquidity environment, they appear to be manageable in the \nshort term. Moreover, differences in monetary policy among the major \nindustrial economies suggest that the era of easy global liquidity may \nnot yet be over. \nConcerns over political and policy uncertainty in the US and the \neuro area have in\ufb02uenced the global economic outlook, creating risks \nfor \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia. The new US administration ", "Solid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200227\nhas mooted possible radical changes to tax and trade policies, raising \nquestions about US commitment to the open movement of goods and \ncapital. The United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty \non 29 March 2017, but this did nothing to clarify the timing or outcome \nof Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European \nUnion. The euro area still faces major unresolved problems such as \nGreek sovereign debt and fragile banks in Italy. These concerns add to \nthe vulnerability of recovery in the euro area. Despite global recovery, \nprices for safe-haven assets such as gold remain robust, re\ufb02ecting \ninvestor concern about political risks and the sustainability of economic \nrecovery in the advanced economies. Asian \ufb01nancial markets may adjust \nfurther, pricing in these risks, which would exacerbate volatility.\nA weaker renminbi might curb exports from emerging East Asia to \nthe PRC, the region\u2019s largest trader, and intensify competition for export \nmarkets in the US and other economies. In the unlikely case of rapid \nrenminbi depreciation, capital out\ufb02ow from the PRC could undermine \nasset prices there and the balance sheets of \ufb01nancial institutions, \nchallenging highly leveraged investors in the PRC. Any negative investor \nsentiment that results could spill over into other markets in emerging \nAsia, further driving capital out of the region.\nRisks from highly leveraged households in Asia\nAbundant global and local liquidity since 2008 has boosted commercial \nand household borrowing in developing Asia, more so than in other \nemerging regions. Macroeconomic vulnerability has worsened in some \neconomies as a result, causing capital \ufb02ow reversals and \ufb01nancial market \nvolatility. The Fed\u2019s tightening cycle has intensi\ufb01ed \ufb01scal and \ufb01nancial \nrisk in the region, particularly in economies with highly leveraged \nprivate sectors. This requires close attention from policy makers. \nBesides commercial debt (discussed at length in ADO 2016 Update), \ngrowing household debt has been a primary cause of rising leverage \nin the region. Fueled by the global availability of relatively cheap and \nabundant credit, consumer debt has surged in many Asian economies \ntoward purchases of property, cars, and motorcycles, as well as many \nother consumer goods \ufb01nanced without collateral. Mortgage loans \ncomprise the bulk of household debt in Asia.\nOf some concern has been the speed with which household leverage \nhas spiked in recent years. In the ROK, the ratio of household debt \nto GDP rose from 74% in late 2008 to nearly 91% in the third quarter \nof2016. Thailand\u2019s household debt ratio jumped by 26 percentage \npoints in the same period, and Malaysia\u2019s by 21 points, both reaching \nabout 71%. In addition, the PRC, Singapore, and Hong Kong, China saw \nhousehold debt increase substantially. In other economies where data \nare available, including India and Indonesia, debt ratios grew less and \nremain low (Figure 1.3.2). \nIn Malaysia, sustained economic growth in recent years has \nboosted household incomes and consumer con\ufb01dence, encouraging \ndebt acquisition.

Thegovernment typically \nplays a more nuanced role in the economy in the more advanced transition, \nespecially as the private sector becomes more developed. Moreover, as \nan economy matures, productivity growth has to come increasingly from \ninnovation rather than the more basic sources of productivity growth, such as \nreallocating workers from low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity \nmanufacturing and services. Tosuccessfully make the transition to high \nincome, middle-income economies therefore need to shift their attention to \nareas that foster innovation and create positive productivity spillover.\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park, Abdul Abiad, Gemma Estrada, Xuehui Han, and ShuTian of the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.

Theregion\u2019s relatively smooth and rapid transition, as wellas \nits robust current growth, encourage optimism about prospects for \nthe next milestone: moving from middle to high income.

Some clues to answer \nthis question can be drawn from international historical experience and \nthe economics literature. The evidence from both indicates that such a \ntransition is within Asia\u2019s reach, but achieving it will require the region \nto confront a different set of challenges. \nTime in middle income\nPast research suggests that it may take some time for an economy \nto reach high income even though it has successfully grown out of \nlowincome. Grouping economies as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, \nand high income by applying World Bank income classi\ufb01cations to ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200251\nlongtime series data from Maddison (2010), Felipe, Kumar, and Galope \n(2017) found the transition to be quite lengthy\u2014about 64 years for \neconomies on average that had reached lower-middle income before \nWorld War II. The Netherlands, for example, was the \ufb01rst economy \nto break out of lowincome in the study, reaching the lower-middle \nthreshold in 1827 and remaining there for 128 years until 1955. \nWhile similar marathons of 80 years or more at lower-middle income \nare common historically, the pace of transition accelerated markedly \nin the postwar period as the median number of years in lower-middle \nincome declined to 28 years, largely the result of the fast transition \nexperienced by East Asian economies, without which the median is \n52years. The shift from upper-middle to high income was much faster \nboth before and after 1950, usually 15\u201320 years.\nIn some ways, the postwar Asian experience raises expectations of \nrapid transition to high income for today\u2019s middle-income economies. \nJapan\u2019s reconstruction and recovery propelled it into upper-middle \nincome in 1968 and into high income in 1977. Japan was quickly followed \nby the NIEs: Hong Kong, China graduating to high income in 1983, \nSingapore in 1988, Taipei,China in 1993, and the ROK in 1995. The NIEs \ncompleted the full transition from low income to high in 3 decades on \naverage. The high-income Latin American economies, in contrast, had \ntransition speeds closer to the global average. Argentina, Chile, and \nUruguay were already lower-middle-income economies before 1900 \nbut had to wait until the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century to become \nhighincome.\nReplicating the approach of Felipe, Kumar, and Galope (2017) using \nPPP 2011 data from PWT 9.0 for the period 1960\u20132014 yields similar \nresults across regions. The rapid transition of the NIEs is evident: \nthe ROK made a swift 23-year transition from low income to high, \nwhile Taipei,China managed it in 27 years (Figure 2.1.4). Singapore \nand HongKong, China, which both began the period as lower-middle \nincome, broke into high income in the 1980s. By contrast, the Latin \nAmerican economies\u2014even those that today are high income\u2014spent \nmuch of the period of analysis as middle income. Brazil and Colombia \nhave been upper-middle income since the 1960s but have yet to reach \nhigh income, after 54 years for Brazil and 55 years for Colombia. \nIn general, the shifts in income classi\ufb01cation proceeded more \nquickly in Asia than in the rest of the world, whether the transition \nwas from lower-middle to upper-middle income or from upper-middle \nincome to high income. Differentials in regional growth rates account \nfor the different transition speeds.

More speci\ufb01cally, these studies \ufb01nd that growth typically \nslows when economies reach upper-middle income. Spence (2011) \nused the term \u201cmiddle-income transition\u201d to specify the phase in the \ngrowth process when an economy\u2019s per capita income enters the range \nof $5,000\u2013$10,000. Ag\u00e9nor, Canuto, and Jelenic (2012) argued that \neconomic growth is likely to slow tangibly when an economy\u2019s income \nreaches around $15,000\u2013$16,000. Income variance across economies \nis often attributed to a \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d characterized by sharp \ndeceleration in gross domestic product (GDP) and productivity growth.\nEichengreen, Park, and Shin (2012) examined the eventual slowdown \nof fast-growing economies. The research showed that such economies \nslow considerably when their per capita income reaches about $17,000 \nin 2005 constant international prices. It found growth slowdowns to be \npositively associated with rapid growth in the preceding period, a high \nsenior citizen dependency ratio, and very high investment rates. \nExtending the earlier study, Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (2014) \nanalyzed the incidence of growth stagnation in middle-income \neconomies. Theirevidence suggested that many economies experience ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200253\nslowdowns in two ranges of per capita income: one is $10,000\u2013$11,000 \nand the other is $15,000\u2013$16,000. If found that slowdowns are less likely \nin economies where the share of population with secondary and tertiary \neducation is relatively high. However, this was not true for education \nin general, suggesting that high quality human capital matters more \nfor avoiding growth slowdown. The study pointed out that advanced \neducation is vital for middle-income countries seeking to shift production \ntoward technologically sophisticated products and services. In addition, \nslowdowns are less likely to occur where high-technology accounts for a \nrelatively large share of exports, indicating the importance of moving up \nthe technology ladder to avoid a middle-income slowdown.\nThe \ufb01ndings of Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (2014) are consistent \nwith the conceptual framework of the middle-income challenge \nput forth by Aghion and Bircan (forthcoming). According to this \nframework\u2014which is ultimately based on Schumpeter\u2019s notion of \ncreative destruction as new technologies and products drive out old \ntechnologies and products (page 62)\u2014graduating to high income \nrequires a shift from investment-led growth to innovation-led growth as \nan economy approaches the global technology frontier. Innovation-led \ngrowth is rooted in innovative entrepreneurship, in which dynamic new \nbusinesses and startups bristle with fresh ideas and different ways of \ndoing things. Institutions and policies must evolve to lubricate the shift \ntoward a more innovative economy. \nWhile the studies cited above support the notion of a middle-\nincome trap, other studies do not. For example, Barro (2016), Imand \nRosenblatt(2015), Han and Wei (2015), and Bulman, Eden, and \nNguyen(2014) found that moving from middle income to high income \nis not very different from moving from low income to middle income. \nBarro(2016) argued that there have been no special patterns or trends \nof dispersion regarding GDP growth since 1870 in the 25 economies \nstudied. Noevidence was found in this study that the second transition, \nmoving from middle to high income, is more difficult than the transition \nfrom low to middle income. Im and Rosenblatt (2015) similarly found \nno difference. Likewise, Han and Wei (2015) found that middle-income \neconomies are no more likely to be stuck in the same income group \nthan low-income or high-income economies. According to these studies, \nthe growth patterns of middle-income economies do not present any \ndistinctive pattern that can be easily categorized as a \u201ctrap.\u201d \nIn sum, evidence of a supposed middle-income trap is mixed. \nSomestudies found evidence that economies are more likely to slow \ndown at middle income than at high or low income, but others did \nnot. The much more pertinent question, however, is what factors \nenable middle-income economies to sustain rapid growth and reach \nhighincome relatively quickly? This is the central question examined \ninthe balance of this chapter.\nA need for a new growth model?\nOne way that middle-income economies are structurally different \nfrom their low-income counterparts is that they have more human and \nphysical capital. This suggests that productivity\u2014the efficiency with ", "54\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nwhich an economy uses capital, labor, and all other inputs to produce \noutput\u2014is likely to become a more signi\ufb01cant driver of growth. Thedata \nindicate that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, productivity growth \nseems to be the litmus test of an economy\u2019s ability to make the \ufb01nal \njump. Fostering productivity growth must therefore be an integral \ncomponent of any growth model that will successfully guide Asia \ntoward high income. \nDifferent structures at middle income\nThe economic structure of middle-income economies differs \nfundamentally from low-income economies, indicating room for \ncatchup growth to reach high income. The box-and-whisker plots in \nFigure 2.1.5a show the heterogeneity of demographic structures among \ndifferent income groups, as well as variations within each income group. \nLow-income economies tend to have a lower proportion of elderly, with \na median of about 3.0%, than do middle-income economies, at 4.8%. \nAlthough middle-income economies may still have some demographic \ndividend to reap compared with high-income economies, which have a \nmedian 11.9% share of elderly population, this needs to be complemented \nby other critical factors that can boost growth. \nWhile demographic structures tend to be less favorable at higher \nincomes, human capital tends to improve. Themedian number of years \nof schooling is 6.1 for middle-income economies, more than double the \n2.5years for low income economies, though still considerably lower than \nthe 9.7 median for high-income economies (Figure 2.1.5b). Giventhe \nimportant contribution of human capital to growth, low-income and \nmiddle-income economies need to close gaps in years of schooling. \nAsshown in the section on human capital below, narrowing differences \nin educational quality is even more critical in boosting growth.\nPhysical capital is considered important to driving productivity \ngrowth. As with human capital, middle-income economies tend to have \naccumulated more physical capital than have low-income economies but \nnot as much as have high-income economies. Middle-income economies \non average have more capital per capita, $31,260 in PPP 2011 terms \ncompared with $4,374 in PPP 2011 terms for low income.3 One \ufb01nds \nthe same pattern using direct measures of infrastructure development \nsuggested by Calder\u00f3n, Moral-Benito, and Serv\u00e9n(2014). The median \nlength of paved roads in middle-income economies is only 3.2kilometers \nper thousand workers, substantially shorter than 21.3kilometers \nin high-income economies but only somewhat better than the case \nof low-income economies, for which the paved road median is less \nthan 0.1kilometers (Figure 2.1.5c). Electricity generating capacity in \ngigawatts per thousand workers and total length of rail in kilometers \nperthousand workers show the same wide gaps. \nThe \ufb01nancial sector in middle-income economies, while more \ndeveloped than in low-income economies, also lags behind high-\nincome economies in terms of depth and efficiency. Domestic credit \nto the private sector has a median of 26.4% of GDP in middle-\nincome economies, far lower than 78.5% in high-income economies. \nInlow-income economies, the corresponding \ufb01gure is 13.3%.

However, middle-income economies already \nhave a larger stock of both types of capital relative to the low-income \ngroup. This suggests a bigger role for improved total factor productivity, \norgrowth in production not accounted for by greater input use, in enabling \ngrowth in middle-income economies and the transition to high income. ", "56\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nProductivity growth at middle income\nIn growth accounting, total factor productivity (TFP) is the residual that \ncaptures the share of GDP growth that cannot be explained by the observable \nfactors of production: physical capital stock, human capital stock, and labor. \nIt is at best a broad, \ufb01rst-order measure of productivity but nevertheless \nis widely used in empirical studies and serves as a proxy for the efficiency \nwithwhich the inputs are combined to produceoutput. \nTable 2.1.1 reports growth accounting for aggregate GDP in economies \nof different income classes. TFP is calculated in PWT 9.0 using labor hours, \nnot number of employees, as the measure of labor input.4 Economies are \ncategorized based on per capita income at the beginning of each decade \nand ifthey moved to another category over the remainder of that decade. \nOfspecial interest are middle-income economies that remained middle \nincome and those that graduated to high-income status. However, the results \nfor other economies\u2014those that remain low income and those that move \nfromlow to middle income\u2014are also reported for reference.5\nGrowth accounting can be useful in that it provides clues on whether \nsome components of GDP growth are more important than others in enabling \neconomies to move up the income ladder. The \ufb01gures reveal that middle-\nincome economies able to transition to high income experience positive TFP \ngrowth in every decade (Table 2.1.1e). Humancapital input also rises quite \nstrongly in these economies, probably re\ufb02ecting relatively heavy investment \nin education. Physicalcapital stock likewise tends to grow rapidly in \nsuccessful middle-income economies.\nSome interesting patterns emerge when comparing the results for \nmiddle-income economies that successfully rise to high income with results \nfor those unable to do so (Table 2.1.1d). Physical capital and human capital \nplay a similar role in the growth of both groups, but labor plays a visibly \nsmaller role in the growth of graduating economies. More importantly, TFP \ngrowth appears visibly slower in economies that remain at middle income \nand accounts for a much lower share of GDP growth. More precisely, TFP \ncontributed 1.2 percentage points (TFP share times GDP growth) to the 4.3% \ngrowth recorded for the entire sample period in economies able to transition \nto high income. Incontrast, it contributed only 0.4 percentage points to 4.1% \ngrowth in economies unable to move out of middle income. \nThe decompositions suggest that economies that successfully achieve \nhigh-income status exploit multiple advantages, including relatively rapid \ngrowth in TFP and human capital, and relatively high \ufb01xed investment. \nTheclear difference between middle-income economies that graduate to high \nincome and those that do not is the larger TFP growth in the former, in both \nabsolute and relative terms. It is therefore worthwhile to take a closer look at \nthe determinants of TFP growth in the next section.\nThe growth accounting exercise above suggests that, although investment \nin physical and human capital will continue to matter as middle-income \neconomies grow richer, productivity growth will become more important as \na driver of economic growth. For middle-income economies to graduate to \nhigh income, they need to achieve rapid productivity growth. Georgiev et al. \n(forthcoming), for example, pointed out that emerging Europe experienced \nrelatively rapid income convergence fueled primarily by rapid TFP growth in \nindividual economies. Failure to achieve productivity growth, on the other \nhand, can doom economies to a long stay in middle income (See Box 2.1.2). \nInsum, productivity growth appears to be pivotal to the transition.", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200257\n2.1.1\u2002Growth accounting for aggregate GDP by income class\na.\u2002All economies\n% contribution to output growth\nAggregate output \n  Observations growth (%) Capital Labor Human capital Total factor productivity\n1960s 69 5.39 39.4 14.4 8.5 37.6\n1970s 81 4.77 58.4 22.0 10.9 8.8\n1980s 92 2.87 58.9 39.7 20.9 \u201319.5\n1990s 105 2.65 61.3 33.8 18.8 \u201313.9\n2000s 114 3.96 48.4 16.4 9.8 25.4\n2010\u20132014 113 3.38 60.1 22.8 11.5 5.6\nTotal  630 3.90 51.5 22.1 11.5 14.9\nb.\u2002Low-income economies that stay low income in the ensuing decade\n% contribution to output growth\nAggregate output \n  Observations growth (%) Capital Labor Human capital Total factor productivity\n1960s 17 4.71 30.7 21.2 7.2 40.9\n1970s 15 4.02 50.5 35.1 8.5 6.0\n1980s 21 2.85 42.0 54.2 19.9 \u201316.1\n1990s 20 2.61 46.2 62.6 22.5 \u201331.3\n2000s 14 5.09 32.6 26.1 8.3 33.0\n2010\u20132014 12 5.29 58.8 32.7 11.7 \u20133.2\nTotal  99 3.91 42.6 36.9 12.3 8.2\nc.\u2002Low-income economies that rise to middle or high income in the ensuing decade\n% contribution to output growth\nAggregate output \n  Observations growth (%) Capital Labor Human capital Total factor productivity\n1960s 6 6.60 37.3 16.7 7.3 38.8\n1970s 7 6.71 53.7 23.7 9.7 13.0\n1980s 5 6.23 49.4 29.4 17.2 4.0\n1990s 3 5.14 50.8 27.2 15.8 6.2\n2000s 9 5.77 40.6 10.7 8.0 40.7\n2010\u20132014 3 4.79 51.1 30.5 \u20135.6 24.0\nTotal  33 6.04 46.0 20.5 9.3 24.2\nd.\u2002Middle-income economies that stay middle income in the ensuing decade\n% contribution to output growth\nAggregate output \n  Observations growth (%) Capital Labor Human capital Total factor productivity\n1960s \u200240 5.63 43.0 10.8 8.5 37.7\n1970s \u200234 5.35 60.2 20.4 9.7 9.7\n1980s \u200238 2.75 67.9 44.5 24.8 \u201337.2\n1990s \u200242 2.68 69.8 34.3 20.1 \u201324.3\n2000s \u200243 4.17 48.6 15.6 10.3 25.5\n2010\u20132014 \u200246 4.04 57.3 23.1 11.9 7.7\nTotal  243 4.07 55.5 21.9 12.8 9.8\ne.\u2002Middle-income economies that rise to high income in the ensuing decade\n% contribution to output growth\nAggregate output \n  Observations growth (%) Capital Labor Human capital Total factor productivity\n1960s 5 4.51 37.7 21.5 15.1 25.7\n1970s 14 4.04 57.4 2.7 13.4 26.5\n1980s 4 5.57 49.8 12.9 10.8 26.5\n1990s 9 3.83 56.7 15.7 12.0 15.7\n2000s 11 4.22 36.5 5.5 9.5 48.6\n2010\u20132014 7 4.44 58.8 14.6 7.9 18.7\nTotal  50 4.27 50.0 10.3 11.4 28.3\nNote: Growth accounting is based on data collected from Penn World Table 9.0.

While economic growth is \nintrinsically multidimensional and country-speci\ufb01c, the vital role of \nproductivity growth in middle-income growth suggests that innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure may be especially important for \neconomic growth. \nAll three factors contribute to TFP improvement. Innovation fosters \ntechnological progress, which improves the productivity of capital \nand labor. As an economy becomes richer, innovation becomes a more \nimportant driver of productivity growth as other sources, such as the ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200259\nreallocation of labor from agriculture to manufacturing and services, \nare gradually exhausted. Human capital contributes directly to higher \noutput and higher productivity, with skilled workers better equipped \nto use advanced technology and create new technology. Infrastructure \nadds directly to a country\u2019s stock of physical capital while improving the \nproductivity of capital, labor, and all other inputs. Road improvement, \nforinstance, reduces economy-wide transportation costs, while the \ninternet reduces economy-wide information and communication costs. \nInnovation, human capital, and infrastructure are no doubt closely \nrelated. This helps explain why middle-income economies able to graduate \nto high income, such as Asia\u2019s NIEs, tend to be strong on these points. \nItis no accident that successful economies tend to perform well in all \nthree areas. Human capital in particular is an indispensable component of \ninnovation. Quality human capital accumulation and adaptive education \npolicies enabled the ROK to shift to more innovation-based growth. \nInfrastructure investment can boost growth by promoting both innovation \nand human capital. Knowledge reinforces both innovation and human \ncapital, while certain types of advanced infrastructure such as mobile \ntelephone and broadband networks are vital for creating and disseminating \nknowledge. \nSeveral studies document the positive and signi\ufb01cant effect \nof innovation, human capital, and infrastructure on TFP growth. \nForexample, in a review of the literature on the determinants of TFP \ngrowth, UNIDO (2007) found that the most signi\ufb01cant factors are \neducation, health, and infrastructure. Human capital enhances the \ncapacity to absorb new technology, which fosters technological progress \nand innovation. Development at the technology frontier also strongly \ndrives TFP growth, implying an important role for innovation. McMorrow, \nR\u00f6ger, and Turrini (2010), for example, found that industries with higher \nexpenditures on research and development (R&D) and adoption rates for \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) experience the fastest \nTFP growth. Similarly, Cardarelli and Lusinyan (2015), a study of TFP \ngrowth in theUS, observed how states with higher educational attainment \nand greater investment in R&D often lie closer to the production frontier. \nIn a comprehensive, sector-level empirical analysis, Dabla-Norris et al. \n(2015) studied the role of innovation, human capital, and infrastructure \nin TFP growth and document how the intensive use of high-skilled labor \nand ICT capital inputs, and higher spending on R&D, tend to be associated \nwith higher productivity growth. \nEconometric analysis clari\ufb01es the relationship between TFP growth \non the one hand and innovation, human capital, and infrastructure on the \nother (Box 2.1.3). While the results are far from de\ufb01nitive and leave wide \nscope for further research, they provide empirical support for the positive \ncontribution these three factors make to productivity. \nThe successful middle-income growth model clearly emphasizes \nproductivity. Innovation becomes more important after economies \nfullyreap the bene\ufb01ts of using existing resources efficiently. Even in the \naccumulation of physical and human capital, the focus shifts to areas \nwithpositive productivity spillover such as advanced infrastructure \nand higher education. All of this must be underpinned, of course, \nbyasupportive policy environment and a stable macroeconomy.

As economies \nmove closer to the technology frontier, productivity growth becomes \ndriven largely by this key element of productivity, implying a need for \neconomies to switch from investment-led to innovation-based growth. \nIn this scenario, it becomes increasingly useful to understand the \nnexus between innovation and entrepreneurship, which is crucial for \npromoting the entry of \ufb01rms with new ideas or technology. Ultimately, \nmiddle-income economies aspiring to reach high income need to \ndiversify and upgrade their production structure, a goal that can be \nfacilitated by government policies promoting innovation. \nThe previous section showed how successful middle-income \neconomies, those that eventually graduate to high income, tend to \nhave relatively fast TFP growth. The importance of innovation in \nproductivity growth naturally implies that successful middle-income \neconomies will be innovative economies. The data seem to bear out \nthis prediction. Examining R&D behavior in middle-income economies, \nwith the sample divided into lower-middle income and upper-middle \nincome, Kim and Park (forthcoming) found that those able to cross to a \nhigher income group typically performed better on standard indicators \nof innovation intensity: R&D stock per worker, ratio of R&D investment \nto GDP, and patent applications per million persons (Figure 2.2.1). \nR&Dinvestment measures inputs to the innovation process, while patent \napplications measure outcomes of innovative activities. \n2.2.1\u2002Innovative intensity in middle-income economies\nR&D stock  R&D investment Patent application (resident)\nLower-middle income staying there\nLower-middle rising to upper-middle income\nUpper-middle income staying there\nUpper-middle income rising to high\n0 0.3 0.6 0.9 0 0.003 0.006 0.009 0 50 100 150 200\nPer worker Ratio to GDP Per million people\nR&D = research and development.\nNote: The entire sample covers 1975\u20132014 that is divided into nonoverlapping ten-year intervals, except for the last 9-year period: 1975\u20131985, 1985\u20131995, 1995\u20132005, and 2005\u20132014. \nTo examine income-level dynamics, a country\u2019s income level at the initial year is compared to that at the \ufb01nal year of each interval.

Upper-middle-income \neconomies that eventually graduate to high income have more than 2.5 \ntimes the R&D stock per worker than their peers. This suggests that \ninnovation is a critical ingredient of the \ufb01nal income transition. \nFrom investment-led to innovation-led growth: \nliterature review\nA brief literature review on the shift from investment-led growth \nto innovation-led growth provides a better understanding of \nthe central role of innovation in the transition to high income. \nImprovedunderstanding leads in turn to a better conceptual \nunderstanding of the challenges facing middle-income economies in \ntheir quest to become innovative, high-income economies.\nGrowth through creative destruction\nIn his classic theory of economic growth, Joseph Schumpeter proposed \nthree main ideas (Schumpeter 1942). \nFirst, innovation plays a central role in long-run growth. It is the \nnatural counterpart of the conclusion in Solow (1956) that long-run \ngrowth requires sustained technological progress. \nSecond, risk-taking entrepreneurs are central to the fostering \nof innovation, and these individuals respond to incentives that are \nin\ufb02uenced by economic policies and institutions. In particular, those \nincentives in\ufb02uence entrepreneurial investments in R&D, training, \nand computer purchases that foster innovation. In contrast, an \nunfavorableenvironment that suffers poor protection of property rights \nor hyperin\ufb02ation, for example, can discourage innovation-based growth \nby damaging the pro\ufb01tability of innovation. Using country\u2013industry \npanel data obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD), Aghion, Howitt, and Prantl(2013) found \nevidence supporting the complementary roles of patent protection and \ncompetition policy in encouraging R&D investment and innovation. \nThird, according to the notion of creative destruction, new products \nand technologies constantly replace old products and technologies. \nCreative destruction is essentially a competitive process between \nthe old and the new. Incumbent \ufb01rms and interests try to prevent \nor delay the entry of new competitors into their industry, while new \n\ufb01rms and interests try to enter the industry and expand their market \nshare. Theefforts of incumbents to hinder new competitors require \nassistance from governments and therefore become factors in the \npoliticaleconomy. ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200263\nProductivity, innovation, and competition \nIn most sectors of an economy, one can think of essentially  2.2.2\u2002Growth and competition, frontier versus laggard firms\ntwo types of \ufb01rms (Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming). \nFrontier \ufb01rms\nFirstare \u201cfrontier \ufb01rms\u201d that lie close to the current  Laggard \ufb01rms\ntechnological frontier.

Faced with greater competition, frontier \ufb01rms will \ninnovate more to escape competition, while laggard \ufb01rms will \nbe discouraged by increased product market competition and \nthus innovate less. Figure 2.2.2 summarizes the relationship \nbetween competition and enterprise growth for these two \ngroups of \ufb01rms.\nAcemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (2006) suggested that, as \neconomies get closer to the technology frontier, cutting-edge \ninnovation replaces capital accumulation and technological \ncatchup as the main engine of growth. It further showed  Competition\nthat low trade openness and high entry barriers become  Source: Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming.\nincreasingly detrimental to growth as the country approaches \nthe frontier. According to Aghion and Bircan (forthcoming), \nmany middle-income economies fail to achieve fast growth because \ntheir institutions and policies fail to evolve in tandem with their stage of \neconomic development. \nThis scenario is best captured by the concept of a non-convergence \ntrap in Schumpeter\u2019s growth theory. Speci\ufb01cally, the concept refers \nto the level of development, or distance to the technological frontier, \nat whichan economy fails to switch from an investment-based \ngrowth strategy to an innovation-based growth strategy even though \nthe threshold for switching has been reached. An economy that is \ntrappedinthis sense stops converging to the frontier (Acemoglu, \nAghion, andZilibotti 2006). \nAs shown in Figure 2.2.3, economies often grow at rapid  2.2.3\u2002Innovation versus investment-led growth\nrates and converge toward the technological frontier through \nTFP /TFP frontier\n(t) (t)\ninvestment-based strategies when they are between points A \nInnovation-led growth\nand B.

Developing Asia as a whole has experienced \na relatively smooth and rapid transition from A to B. Going \nInvestment-led growth\nforward, the question looming for the region is how to \nstrengthen innovation and move from B to C.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is perhaps a good \nexample of an economy that has been growing at a very  TFP /\n(t\u20131)\nTFP frontier\nhigh rate for a long time but is now slowing down and fears  (t\u20131)\ngetting stuck as it approaches the technological frontier. \nTFP = total factor productivity.\nFormany decades, the PRC growth model has used high rates  Source: Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming.\nof investment and net exports that are mostly funded and \nenabled by the state. GDP per capita in the PRC increased \nfrom the equivalent of 5% of US GDP per capita in 1980 to almost 25% \nin 2015. However, PRC convergence has started to slow in the past \n5years. The next stage of development will likely have to come from \ninnovation-led growth, which will require policies and institutions that \nare quite different from the ones that were so successful in helping the \nPRC move out of low-income status.", "64\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nImplications for developing Asia\nWhat can emerging economies in Asia do to innovate their way out of \nmiddle income? The literature suggests a few priorities going forward. \nFirst, the process of technological diffusion, or spillover, is an important \nfactor behind convergence across economies. While imitation of \nexisting technologies drives technological diffusion at lower stages \nof development, economies need more cutting-edge technology and \nfrontier innovation as their income rises to sustain knowledge diffusion. \nHence, greater investment in human capital and R&D becomes essential \nfor middle-income economies. The rising stock of patents and other \ninnovative activity in Asia, particularly in the PRC, is a promising sign \nin this regard. \nSecond, in light of the importance of state-of-the-art technology, \neconomies need to ensure that more productive enterprises can engage \nin and reap the bene\ufb01ts of the latest innovations. One step in this \nregard is better protection of intellectual property rights, which should \nextend to reducing the scope of expropriating successful entrepreneurs. \nAnother is a level playing \ufb01eld for access to \ufb01nance. If innovations can \nbe funded only by the retained earnings of producers or cheap credit \nthrough the state, R&D and patenting are unlikely to be allocated to \nthe most efficient enterprises. Developing Asia still has a long way to go \ninterms of both protecting intellectual property rights and efficiently \nallocating R&D.\nFinally, policy must allow innovative enterprises to grow to an \nefficient scale. Innovative entrepreneurs should be encouraged to start \nup and grow, and less productive entrepreneurs should be allowed to \nfail. This relates to the political economy dimension of Schumpeter\u2019s \ngrowth theory. Institutions and policies that favor large incumbent \n\ufb01rms at the expense of new entrepreneurial \ufb01rms and startups should \nbe dismantled. Creative destruction is possible only with enabling \ninstitutions, which play more important roles as an economy approaches \nthe technology frontier. In practical terms, this means that middle-\nincome economies in Asia should encourage the creation of new \nbusinesses by lowering barriers to entry and strengthening the rule \noflaw. Stronger competition policies can help to level the playing \ufb01eld \nfor new entrants as well and contribute in this way to competition \nandinnovation.\nRole of entrepreneurship in innovation\nThe concept of creative destruction holds the entry of new enterprises \ncentral to innovation, and there is ample empirical evidence to \nsupportthis. Akcigit and Kerr (2010), for instance, found that new \n\ufb01rms tend to seek more radical innovations to expand their production, \nwhile incumbent \ufb01rms seem content to pursue incremental innovations \nthat rely largely on existing products and processes. Lentz and \nMortensen(2008) echoed this result and showed how more than half of \ntotal factor productivity (TFP) growth in industry can be attributed to \nthe entry of new \ufb01rms. Aghion et al. (2009) extended the analysis and \nargued that incumbent \ufb01rms may innovate more when in competition \nwith new \ufb01rms, especially in high-technology industries.", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200265\nThese \ufb01ndings have initiated further research on the impact \nof \ufb01rm entry on productivity growth and the different channels of \nimpact. However, studies typically assume that new \ufb01rms are a single \nhomogeneous group when looking at their contribution to innovation. \nAnalysis differentiating the motivations behind entrepreneurship \nand innovation attributes across income groups remains very \nlimited. Butsuch differentiation may be important. Asseen in the \ntheme chapter of the International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor \npublished in April2016, necessity-driven entrepreneurship tends \nto negatively correlate with GDP per capita, while opportunity-\ndriven entrepreneurship tends to positively correlate. Necessity-\ndriven entrepreneurship is propelled by economic need when work \nopportunities are scarce, while opportunity-driven entrepreneurship \ninvolves the development of new ideas or technology. Put simply, street \nvendors are examples of necessity-driven entrepreneurship, fueled by \nthe need for survival, but tech startups exemplify opportunity-driven \nentrepreneurship fueled by potential pro\ufb01ts from innovation. \nThe following pages argue that emerging markets and developing \neconomies need to increase the share of opportunity-driven entry and \nmake it a development goal. Along these lines, analysis considers whether \nmiddle-income and high-income economies differ in the extent to which \ninnovation motivates entrepreneurship. This investigation uses two \nrelevant indicators\u2014one called the entrepreneurship motivational index \nand the other being the innovation type of early-stage entrepreneurship.\nThe \ufb01rst measure, the entrepreneurship motivational index, comes \nfrom the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset. The index surveys \nearly-stage entrepreneurs, de\ufb01ned as 18\u201364 years old and either nascent \nentrepreneurs or owner-managers of new businesses. The percentage of \nindividuals who are seeking improvement-driven opportunities is divided \nby the percentage who are motivated by a basic need to be employed. \nA ratio greater than one means that there are more opportunity-driven \nentrepreneurs than necessity-driven entrepreneurs in a population.\nWhat does it mean? A higher entrepreneurship motivational index \nmay indicate that more new \ufb01rm owners are driven by the prospect \nof developing new ideas or technology than by a lack of job options. \nThisre\ufb02ects opportunity-driven initiatives where an entrepreneur \nhas a new creation or invention that cannot hit the market unless the \nentrepreneur starts a business to take advantage of the opportunity. \nA lower reading, on the other hand, implies greater necessity-driven \nentrepreneurship, which may indicate that there are no other job options \navailable to the entrepreneur, who has to start a new business to\ufb01nd \nemployment. \nCharting this index across economy income status reveals a distinctly \npositive relationship for economies that already enjoy highincomes. \nAsthe left panel of Figure 2.2.4 shows, high-income economies have \na relatively high ratio of opportunity-driven to necessity-driven early-\nstage entrepreneurship, nearly double that of middle-income economies. \nThe ratio shows that, in high-income economies, startups driven by new \nopportunities are 3.4 times as numerous as those driven by necessity. \nInmiddle-income economies, they are little more than half as prevalent, \nat 1.8 times as numerous. ", "66\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n2.2.4\u2002Innovation-related entrepreneurship and income status\nRatio of opportunity-driven over necessity-driven early entrepreneurship Ratio of innovation type of early-stage enterpreneurship\n20 Low income Middle income High income 60 Low income Middle income High income\n15\n40\n10\n20\n5\n0 0\n7 8 9 10 11 12 7 8 9 10 11 12\nLog GDP per capita Log GDP per capita\nNote: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is constructed by surveying sampled individuals. The survey covers 17 years of data from 182 economies in an unbalanced way. Total early-stage \nentrepreneurial activity is the percentage of the population aged 18\u201364 who are either nascent entrepreneurs or owner-managers of a new business. Within this set, opportunity-driven/\nnecessity-driven early-stage entrepreneurship (the motivational index) is the percentage of those who seek improvement-driven opportunity divided by the percentage of who are \nmotivated by necessity. The innovation type of early-stage entrepreneurship is the percentage of the set who indicated that their product or service is new to at least some customers \nand that few or no other businesses offer the same product.\nSources: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor; ADB estimates.\nThe second measure, which captures the innovation type of early-\nstage entrepreneurship, is calculated as the percentage of early-stage \nentrepreneurs who indicate that their product or service is new to \natleast some customers and that few or no existing businesses offer the \nsameproduct or service. As shown in the right panel of Figure2.2.4, \nhigh-income economies clearly enjoy a higher share of early-stage \ninnovators. On average, 28% of early-stage entrepreneurs in high-income \neconomies indicate that their business belongs to the innovationtype, \nbut only 21.8% of early-stage entrepreneurs in middle-income \neconomies do so. Again, the clear implication is that the relationship \nbetweenentrepreneurship and innovation is demonstratively stronger \ninhigh-income economies.\nTo achieve high-income status, middle-income economies may \ntherefore be well advised to nurture and promote entrepreneurs who \nengage in new businesses to pursue opportunities based on new ideas, \nespecially startups that aim to provide innovative products or services \nthat do not yet exist on the market. Such a policy would naturally be in \naddition to the more traditional goal of fostering a macro-environment \nthat does not force individuals into entrepreneurship for lack of other \nemployment options. \nEconomy and product complexity \nversus innovation\nAnother way to understand how innovation can help an economy \ngraduate to high income is through the notion of structural \ntransformation. As suggested by the development economics literature, \nthis entails changing what an economy produces and exports by \ndiversifying and upgrading its product mix. ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200267\nIn this vein, Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) explained economic \ndevelopment as a process of learning how to produce and export more \ncomplex products. Complexity is a characteristic of both products and \nof economies. Product complexity refers to the capabilities required \nfor producing a product. Economy complexity refers to the capabilities \navailable in it. Development requires acquiring new sets of capabilities \nto move toward new activities associated with higher productivity. \nThese capabilities include the human and physical capital, legal \nsystem, institutions, and other factors needed to produce a product; \nthe know-how or working practices held collectively by the group of \nindividuals comprising a \ufb01rm; and the organizational abilities that \nprovide the capacity to form, manage, and operate activities involving \nlarge numbers of people. \nTo calculate measures of product and country complexity, \nHidalgoand Hausmann (2009) devised the method of re\ufb02ections, which \nlooks at trade data as a network connecting two mutually exclusive \nsets: the set of economies and the set of products they export with \nrevealed comparative advantage.6 To make this method operational, \ndiversi\ufb01cation is de\ufb01ned as the number of products that a country \nexports with revealed comparative advantage, and ubiquity as the \nnumber of economies that export the product with such an advantage. \nDiversi\ufb01cation is the simplest measure of complexity in an economy, and \nubiquity the simplest measure of lack of complexity in a product. \nAccording to these de\ufb01nitions, an economy that exports more goods \nwith revealed comparative advantage, and so is more diversi\ufb01ed, is \nmore complex than an economy that exports fewer goods with revealed \ncomparative advantage, or is less diversi\ufb01ed. Meanwhile, a product \nexported by fewer economies with revealed comparative advantage, \nand so is less ubiquitous, is more complex than a product that is \nexported with revealed comparative advantage by more economies \n(more ubiquitous). The intuition behind these interpretations is simple. \nAneconomy can export a certain product only if it possesses the \nnecessary capabilities in terms of labor skills, institutions, machinery, \npublic inputs, and tradable inputs. An economy with more capabilities \nis more complex. Similarly, a product that is less ubiquitous is more \ncomplex in terms of requiring more exclusive capabilities. \nTo sum, complexity is associated with the set of capabilities required \nby a product (product complexity) or with the set of capabilities that \nare available to an economy (economy complexity). The implication for \nmiddle-income economies is that upgrading export structures toward \nmore diversi\ufb01ed and complex products is critical to foster rapid growth \nand eventually reach high income. \nRecent data from the Atlas of Economic Complexity, aresearch \ninitiative of the Center for International Development at Harvard \nUniversity, indicate that in 2014 the top 10 economies by economic \ncomplexity were Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the ROK, Sweden, \nAustria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and the United \nKingdom. Among economies in developing Asia, only the ROK made \nthetop 10. \nWhile not in the top 10, other economies in developing Asia have \nimproved their ranking from 1995 to 2014. The PRC was ranked19 ", "68\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nin2014, well up from its 1995 ranking of 48.

Further, \nthe 100 mostcomplex products accounted for 8%\u201310% of all exports \nfrom Germany and Japan, the two top economies in terms of economic \ncomplexity. Thecorresponding shares in many middle-income economies \nin the region such as Indonesia, thePhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam \nwere all less than 1%.\nTable 2.2.2 summarizes the top \ufb01ve products that the PRC, Indonesia, \nand Malaysia export. The products exported by the PRC in 1995 \nexhibited low complexity, such as toys and footwear, but the composition \nof its top exports had dramatically changed by 2014. Thetop \ufb01ve exports \nby then were largely much more complex machinery and electronics. \nIndonesia did not change the composition of its top \ufb01ve exports much, \nconsisting mainly of much less complex petroleum and other natural \nresource products. Although Malaysia improved its index of complexity \nstanding from 1995 to 2014, the composition of its top \ufb01ve exports shifted \nfrom largely machinery to predominantly oil products. \nAlthough many Asian economies have managed to improve their \neconomic complexity ranking, the progression of the PRC is remarkable \nas it has acquired the capabilities necessary to produce a more varied \nand sophisticated range of products. Acquiring the necessary set of \ncapabilities to produce more complex products apparently enabled it to \nachieve faster growth than other economies in the region.\nAnalysis suggests that, to reach high income, middle-income \neconomies need to manufacture the most complex products.

Developing Asia has made \nsigni\ufb01cant progress in this regard, and the experience of the PRC since \nthe mid-1990s is exceptionally successful. Economies need to study \nwhat they produce and export and situate their basket in the product \ncomplexity ranking accordingly, deciding judiciously how far up they \ncan go in terms of structural change.\nThe important question is how an economy diversi\ufb01es and upgrades \nits economic structure. It cannot simply leapfrog into more complex \nproducts. Diversi\ufb01cation and upgrading are path-dependent processes \nin which history matters greatly. Economies upgrade to products \nthat require capabilities similar to those they already possess, by \nlearning and doing. They do not switch to products utterly alien to \ntheir capabilities. History shows that today\u2019s advanced economies did \nnot simply follow their comparative advantage, though, in the sense \nof letting the market decide, when making decisions to diversify and \nupgrade their production structures. Instead, active governments \nfacilitated and induced this process through industrial policy.", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200271\n2.2.6\u2002Shares of the most and least complex exports\nShare of most complex exports (log) Share of least complex exports (log)\n4 5\n4\n2\n3\n0\n2\n\u22122\n1\n\u22124 0\n6 7 8 9 10 11 6 7 8 9 10 11\nIncome per capita (log) Income per capita (log)\nNotes:  \n1.

For successful structural \ntransformation, two fruitful strategies are innovation, particularly in \nR&D, and education.\nIn a discussion of how the governments of modern middle-income \ncountries can think about how to move into more complex products \nand sectors through innovation, Felipe and Rhee (2014a, 2014b) posited \nthat these economies will have to increase their R&D spending, both \npublic and private. However, the structure of R&D in these economies \nre\ufb02ects a model not conducive to commercial success, either because \nthe private sector plays only a limited role in knowledge generation, or \nbecause market-driven demand for technology is weak, as evidenced by \nlow R&D spending. For this reason, middle-income economies typically \ndo not have many high-technology sectors. Meanwhile, the public sector \nis ill-equipped to lead R&D efforts because it lacks the private sector\u2019s \nincentive to commercialize R&D outcomes. However, initiating R&D \nconsortiums with the private sector in targeted industries can be an \neffective strategy by which governments jumpstart R&D investment. \nForeign direct investment (FDI) is a particularly important element \nin industrial diversi\ufb01cation, as many middle-income economies rely \non it to acquire advanced business skills and technology. However, \nif not managed properly, preferential treatment and R&D incentives \ngiven to multinational corporations can disproportionately increase \nthe pro\ufb01tability of their operations without effecting the transfer of ", "72\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\ntechnology to domestic \ufb01rms. Policy should thus focus more on the \nacquisition of advanced technology through strategic FDI. Sometimes \nsimply buying technology and paying royalties may be the most effective \napproach to developing domestic technology bases.\nBesides innovation, education is another area that appears especially \nrelevant to middle-income economies looking to climb into high income. \nThese economies often suffer from shortage of skilled professionals, \nparticularly professional managers. Without a steady supply of high-\nskilled labor, upgrading an economy\u2019s industrial structure is impossible. \nEducation that endows high school graduates with strong cognitive \nskills, especially in math and science, can be more important for \ndevelopment through export diversi\ufb01cation than simply increasing the \nquantity of education available.

Highlighting the role of \ngreater investment in children, speci\ufb01cally in their human capital, \nLee and Mason(2010) and Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016), for example, \nfound that fertility decline that is accompanied by an increase in \nhumancapital spending can substantially boost economic growth. \nA change in an economy\u2019s population age structure can have two \neffects on growth. The \ufb01rst demographic dividend is a very direct \nquantitative effect on income and consumption from a decline in \nfertility. Over the past half century, long-term fertility decline in Asia \nand in the rest of the world has caused radical and important changes in \nthe population age distribution. In the medium term, economies in the \nearly stage of the transition have bene\ufb01ted from an increasing share of \nthe working-age population relative to the young and elderly (Bloomand \nWilliamson 1998, Kelley and Schmidt 2001, Mason 2001, Mason and \nLee2007). The same demographic forces may also have improved \ufb01scal \nhealth in developing Asia (Lee, Kim, and Park 2016).8\nThe second demographic dividend, likewise owing to fertility \ndecline, stems from a scaling up of human capital investment and is \noften associated with three main effects: higher consumption growth, \ngreater physical capital per worker, and augmented human capital. \nMason, Lee, and Jiang(2016) estimated these effects and \nfound human capital to be a highly signi\ufb01cant channel of this \ndemographic dividend.  2.3.2\u2002 Public versus private human capital spending \nTo gain better understanding of the issues, the following  indeveloping Asia\npages empirically examine the impact of human capital  Developing Asia\ninvestment on productivity, inequality, and \ufb01scal health in  Rest of the World\ndeveloping Asia.

Twoobservations are apparent. \nFirst, higher-income economies invest more on human capital per person \n(Panel A).

While most \nregional economies in the sample invest the average amount for their \nincome, if not more, some economies, such as Malaysia, the Philippines, \nand Timor-Leste, spend substantially less. \nSecond, the public sector contribution to human capital spending \nintensi\ufb01es as economies develop (Panel B). While there is wide variation \nin the government\u2019s share in human capital spending among developing \neconomies, an upward trend is clear as per capita GDP increases. \nThisshift toward a larger role for governments in \ufb01nancing human \ncapital investment has also been observed recently in health-care \nspending (e.g., Fan and Savedoff 2014) and much earlier in \ufb01nancing \ngeneral consumption in general (e.g., Peacock and Wiseman 1961). \nFigure 2.3.4 presents the simulated impacts of a universal 20% \nincrease in human capital spending per capita on labor productivity \ngrowth (PanelA) and income inequality (Panel B) in 13 developing and \nindustrialized Asian economies.

Lower-income economies seem likely to bene\ufb01t more from \nincreased human capital spending.

In more developed economies \nsuchas Malaysia and Thailand, the projected impact is more modest. \nItis quite interesting that in economies at similar economic stages, \nsuch as Bangladesh and India, the projected impact of human capital \nspending per capita on labor productivity can differ quite substantially, \nre\ufb02ecting the peculiarities of their age pro\ufb01les and resulting \nproductivity.

In Bangladesh and Cambodia, \nfor instance, labor productivity among households in the poorest \nincome quintile is projected to increase by 7%\u20138% because of greater \ninvestment in human capital. The impact on higher-income households \nis substantial as well, but less so.\nPublic \ufb01nances and human capital investment\nHigher worker productivity can directly bene\ufb01t the government. \nThe\ufb01scal impact of greater human capital spending depends as much on \ntax structure as on government involvement in boosting human capital \nspending and on the impact on productivity. Personal income taxes \nper capita in Cambodia and Timor-Leste, for example, are projected \nto increase by at least 3%. In other economies, the projected impact \non government revenues may be insigni\ufb01cant despite large gains in \nlaborproductivity. \nThere are many different ways governments can intervene to \nincrease human capital spending aside from a universal increase in \ngovernment provisions. Governments may increase human capital \nspending for targeted vulnerable groups while maintaining current \namounts for the mainstream. An alternative strategy is to improve the \nefficiency with which public spending is translated to human capital \nwithout increasing appropriations. These strategies are not mutually \nexclusive but may be combined to create more targeted strategies.\nTo further investigate the issue, this subsection considers three \ntypes of targeted strategies. Strategy 1 assumes that governments \nincrease human capital spending by 20% per person for eachagegroup. ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200279\nThis strategy assumes no change in spending efficiency. Strategy 2 \nassumes a 20% improvement in the efficiency of translating public \nspending inputs to human capital, while the amount of public spending \nis kept at the baseline value. Strategy 3 considers both a 20% increase \nin government human capital spending and a 20% improvement in \nefficiency. These three scenarios are combined with three different \ngovernment targeting schemes: a universal program where every \nhousehold bene\ufb01ts from the public interventions on human capital, \natargeted program that is available only to households belonging to the \nlower 40% by income, and a targeted program available only to those in \nthe lower 60% by household income.9\nIn all the strategies considered, government revenues are projected \nto increase with expansion of the tax base, with labor income per \ncapita growing by as much as 3%\u20135% in some scenarios in certain \neconomies. Increasing both the efficiency and amount of public \nhuman capital spending seems to increase tax collection per capita \nmore than the interventions implemented separately, if they can be \nadded together. There is only a modest decline in effective tax rates, \nindicating household labor income will grow faster than the amount the \ngovernment collects from these households in taxes. \nThe \ufb01scal impact of public spending on human capital per capita \ndepends on the government strategy employed to raise human capital. \nIngeneral, strategies that improve efficiency without increasing inputs \nhave little or no positive effect on the \ufb01scal rate of return from public \nhuman capital spending. Increasing public spending is projected to lower \nthe \ufb01scal rate of return, though rates remain positive in all scenarios.\nIn summary, simulations in individual economies using the NTA \ndatabase show that increasing human capital spending promotes \ninclusive growth by improving labor productivity and narrowing \nincome inequality. Government-led human capital investment appears \nto be more inclusive than human capital accumulation led by the \nprivatesector.10 Lower-income economies and poorer households within \neconomies tend to bene\ufb01t more from increased human capital spending, \nwhich argues for early investment. Interestingly, investing in human \ncapital not only promotes growth and equity but may also improve \ngovernment budgets in developing Asia in the long run.\nThis outcome is not guaranteed, as it depends partly on how human \ncapital spending is transformed to actual productive labor in each \neconomy. Other government policies and the economic environment \nare also important. Moreover, the government interventions on human \ncapital spending that the simulation exercise considered\u2014either a \nuniversal increase in human capital spending, a targeted increase \nonly for vulnerable groups, and improved efficiency in human capital \nspending\u2014are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to create \nmore targeted strategies. \nThe aging of Asia\u2019s population further strengthens the case for \nhuman capital accumulation and puts a spotlight on the quality \nof education. Intuitively, more productive workers can offset the \nnegative economic impact of having fewer workers.

Evidence suggests three important ones. \nFirst is having information systems that conduct quality data collection \nand provide relevant, timely, and credible data on schooling inputs and \nskills outcomes. These systems enable governments to reach evidence-\nbased policy decisions and hold schools and teachers accountable \nfor learning outcomes. Further, providing information to parents on \nstudent and school performance can empower families to demand better \neducational quality. Second is curriculum content that matches student \ncapabilities and fosters the development of critical skills, in particular \nproblem-solving and noncognitive skills emphasizing basic digital and \n\ufb01nancial skills. Basic education curricula, especially at the secondary \nlevel, ideally focus on developing skills that are highly transferable. \nThird is value placed on early childhood education, as this can foster \nsubstantial improvement in skills outcomes.

Understanding the pattern of \nreturns on education in different settings can inform understanding of \nthe relative bene\ufb01ts of investing in different levels of education.12", "82\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nUntil the 1980s, intuition, as well as evidence based on thousands of \nestimates of rates of return,13 pointed to higher returns for low-income \neconomies than for high-income economies and higher returns for \nprimary than for tertiary education, especially in low- and middle-\nincome economies. However, since the 1990s, there has been mounting \nevidence of signi\ufb01cantly higher returns on post-primary and especially \ntertiary education from studies spanning most parts of the world, \nincluding low- and middle-income economies in Asia, LatinAmerica, \nand Africa (Schultz 2004, Kingdon, Patrinos, Sakellariou and Soderbom \n2008, Patrinos, Ridao-Cano, and Sakellariou 2006, Riboud, Savchenko, \nand Tan 2006). This pattern reversal is hardly a surprise for two \nreasons. One is the widespread expansion of primary education across \nthe world, including in low- and middle-income economies, thus \nincreasing the supply of low-skilled workers. The other is skill-biased \ntechnological change that reduces demand for low-skilled labor. \nThese \ufb01ndings naturally alter the policy implications of public \nspending on education for poverty reduction. Subsidies to tertiary \neducation need not to be very large or universal, as those who can afford \nhigher education will pay as needed. Governments can focus instead on \ncorrecting credit market failures to ensure that the poor have access to \neducation (Colclough, Kingdon, and Patrinos 2009). Meanwhile, efforts \nto make primary education universal need to be continued to build a \nstrong foundation for tertiary education.\nAlthough bridging the gap in post-secondary education completion \nrates between high-income and low- and middle-income economies is \nnecessary (Figure 2.3.7), precedence arguably goes to bridging another \ngap, in education quality rather than quantity. Successful education \nsystems provide quality education and equip graduates with marketable \nskills.

Here, the term is used to denote network \ninfrastructure\u2014transport by road and rail, electricity, water supply and \nsanitation, and telecommunications by landline, mobile phones, and \ninternet systems. Providing essential services and connecting markets, \ninfrastructure is essential to the smooth functioning of the economy. \nItis highly complementary to labor and other types of capital, and \nassuch its contribution to output gains is potentially large.\nInfrastructure differs from other types of capital in a few important \nways. Infrastructure projects are often big and capital intensive, \nmaking them natural monopolies. They have large upfront costs, but \nbene\ufb01ts accumulate over very long periods. Infrastructure also tends \nto generate positive externalities as social returns often exceed private \ngains. Because of these peculiarities, which make the private \ufb01nancing \nand provision of infrastructure hard, infrastructure is still commonly \nprovided by governments. Given the budget constraints faced by many \nlow- and middle-income economies, infrastructure often remains \nunderprovided no matter how badly it is needed.\n By helping to boost output, infrastructure investment can play \na critical role in sustaining growth in middle-income economies, \nincluding in developing Asia. ADB reported in 2017 that Asia will need \nto invest $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure to maintain its growth \nmomentum (ADB 2017). The type of investment undertaken is important \nas an economy\u2019s infrastructure needs change as it develops. While \nthe transition from low to middle income corresponds to a basic shift \nfrom sectors with low to higher productivity, most commonly from \nagriculture to manufacturing, the transition to high income is more \ncomplex, requiring economies to diversify into a wider set of products, \ninnovate rather than just imitate, and upgrade to more complex products \nwith higher value added.\nThe empirical literature to date is sparse on whether infrastructure \nplays a special part in overcoming the development challenges faced by \nmiddle-income economies. To understand the issue, this section \ufb01rst \ninvestigates whether an economy\u2019s infrastructure needs alter across \nits stages of development. It then explores whether infrastructure \ninvestment has a causal impact on output and whether this differs for \nmiddle-income economies. \nOn the whole, the analysis reveals a clear pattern in the sectoral \nprovision of infrastructure across development stages, with basic \ninfrastructure such as for transport and for water supply and \nsanitation more important in the early stages and more advanced \ninfrastructure such as for electric power generation and information \nand communication technology (ICT) becoming more important in \nlater stages. Faster-growing middle-income economies invest more in ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200285\ninfrastructure and tend to have a greater share of infrastructure in ICT \nthan their slower-growing peers. The causal analysis \ufb01nds as well a \nstrong and sustained impact from public infrastructure investment on \noutput growth in middle-income economies, which further underscores \nthe possible bene\ufb01ts of an infrastructure push for this income group.\nEvolution in infrastructure needs\nIn thinking about the role of infrastructure at different stages of \neconomic development, it is useful to provide a sketch of how an \neconomy transitions from one income group to another. In a standard \ndualistic development model, low-income economies are able to reach \nmiddle-income status through sectoral shifts\u2014primarily by moving \nworkers out of low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity \nmanufacturing\u2014and by adopting or imitating foreign technology. \nThesesources of high growth tend to peter out, however, once upper-\nmiddle income is reached, as the pool of underemployed labor shrinks, \ncausing wages to rise and competitiveness to decline.\nMaintaining growth becomes increasingly difficult at middle income \nunless an economy \ufb01nds other ways to raise productivity. This would \nrequire, for instance, strong investment in innovation that generates \nnew ideas, processes, and technologies and a shift to industries with \never higher value added. Infrastructure may be central to this process. \nAg\u00e9nor and Canuto (2015) argued that sufficiently large investments \nin advanced infrastructure such as high-speed communication \nnetworks promote innovation and encourage additional human capital \naccumulation, which helps a developing economy to escape a middle-\nincome slowdown.\nOne can draw from this a few hypotheses about the role of \ninfrastructure in development. One is that the infrastructure required \nwould evolve as the economy progresses, with more rudimentary \ninfrastructure such as for transport and for water supply and sanitation \ncritical during the earlier stages of development and more sophisticated \ninfrastructure required for industrialization and subsequently \ninnovation, such as reliable power supply and ICT, likely to be important \nin the later stages, particularly when an economy reaches middle \nincome.14 Another hypothesis is that economies that are better at \nproviding the necessary infrastructure tend to perform better.\nThis subsection documents stylized facts regarding infrastructure \nprovision in the various income groups to allow a comparison of middle-\nincome economies with others.15 All country-year observations in the \nsample are initially classi\ufb01ed in three income groups: low income, lower-\nmiddle income, and upper-middle income. As mentioned above, these \nincome groups are based on income thresholds set by the WorldBank \nand are applied to GDP data from the Penn World Table 9.0. \nWithin each income group, the economies are further classi\ufb01ed based \non geometric mean per capita GDP growth within a particular income \ngroup, with \u201ctop25\u201d representing the fastest-growing quartile, \u201cmid50\u201d \nthe middle 50%, and \u201clow25\u201d the slowest-growing quartile. This is done \nto see if differences in infrastructure provision are associated with \ndifferences in growth performance within each incomegroup.", "86\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nFigure 2.4.1 shows a strong positive correlation between \nan economy\u2019s stage of development and physical measures of \ninfrastructure. This is not surprising and has been documented \nelsewhere (e.g.,International Monetary Fund2014). The more novel \n\ufb01nding is that economies that grow faster than their peers in the same \nincome group tend to have more of certain types of infrastructure. \nThisis true of transport and ICT. For electricity, water supply, and \nsanitation, however, there seems to be little or no association between \ngrowth performance and infrastructure provision. \nWhile all types of infrastructure tend to increase as economies \ndevelop, their relative importance changes, as measured by their share \nin the overall stock of infrastructure. To explore this conjecture, \ndifferent types of infrastructure are aggregated using unit costs of \nproduction drawn from Fay and Yepes (2003).

The regressions con\ufb01rm \nthat lower-middle-income economies tend to have greater infrastructure \nstock than low-income economies, and that upper middle-income \neconomies tend to have higher infrastructure stock than both groups \n(Table 2.4.2). This is true for most types of infrastructure. \nA few results stand out that add nuance to the previous observations \non infrastructure provision across development stages. One is the \ncontinued accumulation of mobile, internet, and energy infrastructure \nthroughout and beyond the middle-income stage, as evidenced by the \nincreasing size of the country income dummy coefficients.17 Theother, \nalso based on these coefficients, is the tendency for telephone line, \ntransport, and water supply and sanitation provision to level off \nfollowing a run-up during the upper middle-income phase. \nRegarding roads, a possible explanation is that, during early stages \nof development, the focus is on expanding the road network, or building \nnew roads where none existed. At later stages of development, however, \nthe focus shifts to improving the quality and capacity of existing roads \nby widening and by converting provincial into national roads then into \nlimited-access highways. This is not captured in the indicator, which \nmeasures only the length of the road network. Access to water supply \nand sanitation also tends to rise during early middle-income stages, and \nexpansion in these services naturally tapers as access becomes nearly \nuniversal by the time an economy reaches high income or even upper-\nmiddle income.", "90\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n2.4.2\u2002Sectoral infrastructure regressions using income group dummies\nTelephone  Mobile  Internet  Total  Water  Sanitation \nmainlines  phones  users  roads  Rails  Electricity  access  access \nVariables (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)\nLower-middle income 0.518*** 0.892*** 0.760*** 0.300*** \u20130.013 0.327*** 3.540*** 5.007***\n(0.049) (0.125) (0.162) (0.023) (0.016) (0.031) (1.363) (0.798)\nUpper-middle income 0.900*** 1.390*** 1.602*** 0.339*** 0.067** 0.485*** 4.917*** 7.665***\n(0.064) (0.164) (0.213) (0.042) (0.027) (0.046) (1.753) (0.885)\nHigh income 0.817*** 1.845*** 1.880*** 0.277*** 0.069** 0.600*** 4.027* 6.390***\n(0.072) (0.244) (0.268) (0.046) (0.031) (0.054) (2.163) (1.011)\nMid 50% for growth 0.030 0.017 0.336*** \u20130.037* 0.033* \u20130.079*** 1.994 1.498**\n(0.039) (0.129) (0.124) (0.020) (0.017) (0.026) (1.470) (0.684)\nTop 25% for growth 0.231*** 0.500*** 0.268* \u20130.138*** \u20130.011 \u20130.081** 3.861** 1.953***\n(0.053) (0.184) (0.161) (0.033) (0.020) (0.040) (1.578) (0.632)\nAgriculture, share of GDP \u20130.033*** \u20130.081*** \u20130.071*** \u20130.011*** 0.000 \u20130.012*** \u20130.095 \u20130.148***\n(0.003) (0.009) (0.010) (0.001) (0.001) (0.0020) (0.081) (0.027)\nPopulation density 0.164** 6.941*** 5.482*** 0.274*** 0.045 \u20130.302*** 21.519*** 6.401***\n(0.076) (0.515) (0.447) (0.042) (0.038) (0.049) (3.094) (1.017)\nUrbanization 0.027*** \u20130.003 0.044*** 0.005*** 0.002* 0.020*** 0.308*** 0.440***\n(0.003) (0.012) (0.014) (0.002) (0.001) (0.002) (0.102) (0.043)\nConstant \u20131.161*** \u201335.147*** \u201332.377*** \u20132.219*** \u20134.120*** 3.009*** \u201324.508* 31.082***\n(0.320) (2.480) (2.166) (0.198) (0.127) (0.270) (13.818) (4.790)\nObservations 3,249 2,016 1,779 3,291 3,225 3,713 525 2,045\nR-squared 0.968 0.915 0.931 0.978 0.981 0.978 0.965 0.993\nFormal test of differences in coefficients:\nUpper middle > Lower middle  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes\nHigh income > Upper middle  No Yes Yes No No Yes No No\nTop 25% > Mid 50% Yes Yes No No Yes No Yes No\n*** = p < 0.01, ** = p < 0.05, * = p < 0.1. \nNote: All regressions include economy and year fixed effects.\nSource: Abiad, Debuque-Gonzales, and Sy, forthcoming.\nThe regressions con\ufb01rm the positive association between growth \nperformance and certain types of infrastructure stock.

This group of economies also seems to be largely \nbehind the positive association between growth performance and access \nto water supply and sanitation. \nAll things considered, the stylized facts and regression results \nsuggest a hierarchy of needs where economies are more likely to invest \nin basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation, roads, \npower, and telephone mainlines during early stages of development. \nEconomies then seem to turn their attention to advanced infrastructure \nsuch as mobile and internet connections when they reach the upper-\nmiddle income, with power continuing to be a priority. Fast-growing \neconomies within each income group tend to have higher infrastructure \nstock than their slower-growing counterparts for certain types of \ninfrastructure, notably ICT.\nThe macroeconomic effects of public investment\nDiscussions above have established an association between \ninfrastructure provision and investment, on the one hand, and \nstage of development and growth performance on the other. But the \nbivariate charts and multivariate regressions cannot shed light on \nthe direction of causality. The positive relationship could arise from \noutput responding to infrastructure investment as the latter boosts \ndemand in the short term or the productivity of existing factors of \nproduction in the longterm. It could arise as well from infrastructure \nresponding to output, either because higher output makes it easier to \npay for infrastructure or because expectations of higher growth induce \ngreaterinvestment in infrastructure. This is a problem that has long \nplagued the literature on the macroeconomic effects of infrastructure \ninvestment. ", "92\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nThe challenge is to identify changes in infrastructure investment \nthat are not driven by contemporaneous or lagged output, nor by \nexpectations of future output growth. To tackle this issue, the following \npages adopt the empirical strategy of Corsetti, Meier, and M\u00fcller (2012), \nwhich relies on the idea that signi\ufb01cant parts of government spending \nare likely to be determined by past information and cannot easily \nrespond to current economic conditions. Based on this assumption, \none can estimate a \ufb01scal policy rule for public investment and from \nthis obtain a series of exogenous shocks to public investment.19 \nTheestimated policy shocks can then be used to trace the dynamic \neffects of public investment on output.\nIn principle, the assumption that public investment cannot easily \nrespond to current economic conditions may not hold for two reasons. \nFirst, public spending can automatically respond to cyclical conditions. \nThis should not pose a problem for public investment, however, because \nautomatic stabilizers work mostly through revenues and social spending. \nSecond, discretionary public investment spending can occur in response \nto output conditions. As discussed in Corsetti, Meier, and M\u00fcller(2012), \nthe relevance of this concern relates to the precise de\ufb01nition of \ncontemporaneous feedback effects. Althoughit is typically assumed in \nthe literature that government spending does not react to changes in \neconomic activity within a given quarter (Blanchard and Perotti 2002), \nwhether it may respond in a period longer than a quarter is an open \nquestion. Recent evidence for advanced economies suggests that the \nrestriction that governmentspendingdoes not respond to economic \nconditions within ayear cannot be rejected (Beetsma, Giuliodori, \nand Klaassen 2009, Born andM\u00fcller2012). Box2.4.2describes the \nempirical methodology for estimatingthe macroeconomic impact of \ninfrastructure.\nThe results suggest that public investment has a positive and \npersistent impact on output in developing economies (Figure2.4.5, \nPanelA). The contemporaneous effect of an increase in public investment \nequal to 1% of GDP is a 0.3% increase in output. Thisgradually increases \nto 1.2% in the 7th year after the shock, with an impact signi\ufb01cantly \ndifferent from zero in both the short and the longrun. \n2.4.5\u2002Effect of public investment on output\nA.

In low-income economies, public investment \nshocks do not raise output immediately. There is an increase in \nlong-term output of 1.1% after 7 years, but with increasing size of the \nstandard error as time passes after the shock, the estimated impact \nis not signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. Inmiddle-income economies, \npublic investment shocks raise output by 0.6% immediately, and \nthe effect is signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. Over time, the impact \nincreases to 1.1% in the 7th year after the shock, and this long-run effect \nis also signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. Although the patterns in the \nmiddle-income and low-income subsamples are noticeably different, \ngiven thelarge error bands around the estimated effects, one cannot \nreject that the impact in both types of economies is the same. \nThe somewhat weaker impact of public investment in low-income \neconomies may seem counterintuitive but is consistent with evidence \nfrom studies, such as Warner (2014) and Kraay (2012). This is an \nimportant point: Infrastructure investment can have a wide range \nof outcomes, and even though the positive association between \ninfrastructure provision and development is clear, positive causal effects \nfrom infrastructure investment to output require the right conditions. \nFailure of public investment to lead to sustained output growth is often \nattributed to poor investment efficiency that inhibits the conversion ", "94\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nof dollar spending into productive capital stock. Another cited reason \nfor weak output gains is the limited absorptive capacity of certain \neconomies, with marginal returns likely to decline as investment outlays \nare scaled up (Presbitero 2016). One can reasonably expect absorptive \ncapacity constraints, which occur during a rapid acceleration and \nratchetingup of public investment, to be more severe in low-income \neconomies. Governments also tend to focus on basic infrastructure \nsuchas water supply and sanitation in earlier development stages. \nSuchinvestments, while vital, may not be particularly growth-\nenhancing and are therefore unlikely to catalyze substantial output \ngains. A\ufb01nal explanation is that the marginal productivity of \ninfrastructure investment may not be higher in low-income economies \ndespite the more acute shortage of infrastructure there, because \ncomplementary factors of production\u2014human capital, private capital, \nand the right institutions\u2014are in similarly short supply.\nInvest more, and in the right kinds \nof infrastructure\nWhat role does infrastructure play in middle-income economies? \nTheanalysis uncovered several noteworthy results. Looking at the \nstylized facts, one \ufb01nds that the stock of infrastructure tends to rise \nwith income, and with growth performance. Infrastructure type \nsystematically varies with an economy\u2019s stage of development, re\ufb02ecting \na clear hierarchy of requirements. Transport, basic communications, \nwater supply, and sanitation are more important at early stages of \ndevelopment, while reliable electricity supply and ICT become more \nimportant as economiesadvance. \nBetter-performing economies, especially among middle-income \neconomies, differ from others in their income group in two important \nways. Faster-growing economies tend to have more of certain types \nof infrastructure\u2014especially ICT\u2014than their peers. They also invest a \nbigger share of GDP in infrastructure. The strong positive association \nof certain types of infrastructure with growth at different stages of \ndevelopment suggests a potential policy lever for governments grappling \nwith the middle-income challenge of sustaining growth. Itis not enough \nto simply raise the amount of infrastructure investment, economies \nalso need to invest in the right types of infrastructure, which depend \non their current stage of development. While it may be bene\ufb01cial for a \nlow-income economy to focus initially on basic infrastructure suchas \nwater supply and sanitation, for instance, analysis \ufb01nds that they \nshouldshift attention to more advanced infrastructure such as ICT \nduring theirmiddle-income stage, and especially during their upper \nmiddle-income stages.\nThe experience of the Republic of Korea (ROK) is illustrative. \nTheROK was on the cusp of transitioning to high income in the \nmid-1990s, and by some measures it crossed the threshold in1995. \nBut shortly thereafter, it was hit hard by the Asian \ufb01nancialcrisis, \nimperiling its newfound status as a high-income economy. Several \nstudies, including Lee (2003), Oh and Larson (2011), Bae (2011), ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200295\nYeoetal.(2014), and Lee (2015), document how the ROK government \ndeliberately targeted the development of ICT infrastructure in the \nlate 1990s. Eventhough broadband services were \ufb01rst launched in the \nROK only in 1998, by the early 2000s, the broadband penetration rate \nin the ROK was the highest in the world (Bae 2011). As a result, Oh and \nLarson(2011) noted: \u201cIn 1997 the ICT sector contributed only about \n12 percent to the nation\u2019s GDP growth. By 2003, that percentage had \nrisen to about 40percent and it remained substantial through 2009.\u201d \nTheworld-leading ICT infrastructure of the ROK likely contributes \nto the economy being ranked the most innovative in the world \n(Bloomberg2015). \nA positive association between infrastructure and growth \nperformance in middle-income economies cannot be the basis for policy, \nas causality can run either way\u2014or both. The additional analysis in \nthis section moves in this direction by showing how exogenous shocks \nto public investment have signi\ufb01cant positive and persistent effects \non output, particularly in middle-income economies. This provides \nreassurance that at least part of the causality between infrastructure \nprovision and development runs from infrastructure to national \noutput and income. The slightly bigger and more sustained impact \nof infrastructure investment on output in middle-income economies \nindicates the potentially strong bene\ufb01ts of increased infrastructure \ninvestment in them. That said, further research is needed to determine \nthe precise relationship between infrastructure and economic growth. \nBetter data on ICT infrastructure investment, in particular, would help \nresearchers de\ufb01nitively identify the bene\ufb01ts of that particular type of \ninvestment.", "96\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nReaching toward high income\nDecades of rapid economic growth transformed developing Asia from \na low-income region to a middle-income region. The vast majority of \nthe population now lives in middle-income economies. The region \ncontinues to grow at a healthy pace, and its NIEs have reached high \nincome in record time. However, the experience of many middle-income \neconomies in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that graduation \nfrom middleincome to high income can be challenging. Further, middle-\nincome economies are structurally different from low-income economies, \nand the transition from low to middle income differs in important ways \nfrom the transition from middle to high income. This is a good time to \ntake stock ofthe challenges facing the middle-income region as it seeks to \nbuild on its past success.\nAn examination of middle-income challenges reveals that while \nthe accumulation of physical and human capital continues to matter \na lot for sustaining healthy growth, productivity comes to the fore. \nTotalfactor productivity (TFP), the growth in production not accounted \nfor by increased use of inputs, plays a bigger role in middle-income \neconomies\u2019 growth, particularly those successfully reaching high income. \nThesuccessful middle-income growth model emphasizes productivity \nand innovation. Innovation becomes more important after economies \nfully reap the bene\ufb01ts of using existing resources efficiently. Even in the \nfurther accumulation of physical and human capital, the focus shifts to \nareas with positive productivity spillover like advanced infrastructure \nand higher education. Finally, all of this must be underpinned by a \nsupportive policy environment and stable macroeconomy.\nStepping up innovation requires a skilled workforce capable of \ncreating new knowledge and technology. Middle-income economies \nshould increase human capital investment, which not only fuels growth \nbut also promotes equity. When building human capital, the focus \nshouldbe on educational quality to enhance cognitive skills, inparticular \nscience and math capabilities, which enhances the chances of students \nbecominginnovators.\nAdvanced infrastructure is an important investment to foster \ninnovation and human capital accumulation. As middle-income economies \ndevelop, their infrastructure needs evolve from basic infrastructure to \nadvanced infrastructure. The combination of advanced infrastructure, \naskilled workforce, and innovation can help sustain productivity growth \nand pave the way for a steady transition to highincome.\nSound policies and institutions\nSound policies and institutions will play a vital role in the broad \ntransition from middle to high income, as it did in Asia\u2019s transition \nfrom low to middle income. The role of the government will necessarily \nevolve as economies progress. The development of the private sector in \nparticular demands a more nuanced economic role for the government. ", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200297\nMore generally, the government must provide an environment conducive \nto innovative entrepreneurship by promoting investment in education \nand infrastructure. The quality of education and higher education \ninparticular becomes more important as economies grow richer, asdoes \nadvanced infrastructure such as ICT. The experience of Asia\u2019s newly \nindustrialized economies highlights the role of innovation, human \ncapital, and infrastructure in sustaining TFP growth at middle income. \nIn terms of innovation, middle-income economies must prioritize \ninstitutions and policies that level the playing \ufb01eld for the new \ufb01rms \nthat play major roles in innovation. Strong intellectual property rights \nensure that new entrepreneurs can capitalize on commercially useful \nnew ideas, products, or technologies without fear of expropriation by \nlarge incumbent \ufb01rms or other parties. This gives them the con\ufb01dence \nto invest their time and effort in innovative activities. Access to \ufb01nance \non reasonable terms enables entrepreneurs to transform new ideas \ninto novel products and services. Effective competition laws, and \nmorebroadly strong rule of law, limit the scope for large incumbents to \nabuse their market power toward hindering the entry and expansion of \ninnovative newcomers.\nWith respect to human capital, analysis indicates that, as an \neconomy converges on the global technology frontier, the quality of \neducation increasingly takes precedence over the quantity of education. \nEducation policy and reform should be geared toward producing \ntechnically competent workers who are capable of absorbing and using \nnew knowledge. Augmenting the pool of cognitive skills such as math \nand science is key to upgrading the workforce to one that is capable of \ncreating the new technology and knowledge that are the cornerstones \nof innovation-led growth. There is also a case for investing more in \nhigher education that features research, built on a solid foundation of \nbasiceducation.\nAnalysis also indicates that infrastructure investment will be \nnoless important during developing Asia\u2019s transition from middle to \nhigh income than during its past success in moving up from low to \nmiddleincome. The region should therefore continue to prioritize \ninvestment in infrastructure of all types, from roads to electricity. \nSinceenergy and advanced infrastructure such as ICT seem to be \nespecially important for the \ufb01nal transition, economies should expand \ninvestments in these areas as they approach high income.\n The case can be made for more direct government intervention in \na selective and targeted way to foster a more diverse and sophisticated \noutput mix, as shown in Peru\u2019s successful experience with industry\u2013\ngovernment coordination (Box 2.5.1). The case for intervention is \nstronger when the government has adequate institutional capacity, as \nBerglof and Cable (forthcoming) and Bruszt and Campos (forthcoming) \nemphasize. Within the region, Thailand\u2019s success in becoming Southeast \nAsia\u2019s hub for automobile manufacturing is revealing. Instead of trying \nto foster a national champion, Thai policy makers pursued a more \nnuanced, market-oriented strategy of attracting foreign auto \ufb01rms. \nExtensive dialogue between government and industry was vital to \nfostering a critical mass of local auto parts suppliers, an indispensable \npillar of any auto industry (Hill and Kohpaiboon 2017).

Evidence has emerged since the global \ufb01nancial crisisof \n2008\u20132009 that growth in individual economies has become \nmoredependent on such global factors as global growth, oil prices, and \n\ufb01nancial volatility (Aizenman et al. forthcoming). This indicates that the \nregion may be more vulnerable to external shocks.\nEmpirical evidence indicates that when an economy reaches middle \nincome, its growth rate is more vulnerable to threats to macroeconomic \nstability\u2014such as whether a banking or currency crisis, large capital \nin\ufb02ows other than foreign direct investment, and high government debt \nrelative to GDP. Exploring the determinants of growth in a global dataset \nfrom 1960 to 2014, Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (forthcoming) con\ufb01rmed \nthe importance of a number of variables: initial income, years of schooling, \ninvestment share, demographic characteristics, infrastructure, \ufb01nancial \ndevelopment indicators, and governance. The study also included variables \nrelated to macroeconomic stability: \ufb02ows of foreign direct investment, \ntheoccurrence of banking or currency crises, and government debt.", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200299\nInterestingly, the study found that the economic factors associated \nwith per capita income growth do in fact differ between middle-income \nand other economies. The critical distinction is between low and middle \nincome. For example, in middle-income economies, the lending\u2013deposit \nrate spread matters less than in low-income economies. This suggests that \ninefficiencies in the \ufb01nancial system matter less in relation to other factors \nas economies move up the income scale. Similarly, the gender ratio is no \nlonger as important as before, suggesting the diminishing importance of \ndemographic determinants with graduation to middle-income status. \nSo what are the factors that come to the fore when an economy reaches \nmiddle income? The study found that growth in middle income is more \nvulnerable to those that affect macroeconomic stability. Morespeci\ufb01cally, \nin middle-income economies a banking or currency crisis can signi\ufb01cantly \nhinder growth, as can capital in\ufb02ows other than foreign direct investment \nand high government debt as a share of GDP. The region should therefore \nstay vigilant about protecting macroeconomic stability, as it has done \nin the past through sound \ufb01scal and monetary policies. The brief \nreversion of the ROK from high income to middle income during the \nAsian\ufb01nancialcrisis of 1997\u20131998 serves as a stark reminder of the high \ncost of macroeconomic instability.\nThe evidence in this chapter indicates that sustaining rapid growth \nwill not be easy, but it is within the reach of middle-incomeAsia. \nManyfactors that served the region well at low income, such as \nmacroeconomic stability and high investment, still serve it well at \nmiddleincome. At the same time, the pattern of growth will have to \nevolve if Asia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high income. \nInparticular, innovation, human capital, and infrastructure will have to \nplay vital roles. The region\u2019s dynamic track record and the transition of the \nregion\u2019s most advanced economies provide some cause for optimism about \nsustaining rapid growth at middle income.\nLearning from regional success stories\nOne group of Asian economies that was able to shift from investment-led \ngrowth to innovation-based growth is the newly industrialized economies \n(NIEs): the ROK, Singapore, Taipei,China, and HongKong,China. \nTheoutput mix of these economies became more diverse and sophisticated \nas they graduated from middle to high income, having initially \nspecialized in labor-intensive products during the early stages of their \nindustrialization but gradually shifting to a wide range of products \nrequiring advanced skills and technology.\nIn 1960, Singapore and Hong Kong, China were both lower-middle \nincome, while the ROK and Taipei,China were both low income. From that \nyear, Hong Kong, China labored for 24 years and Singapore for nearly 30 \nyears in middle income before reaching high income. Taipei,China took \n27years to transition from middle to high income, 10 years ranked as \nlower-middle income and 17 years as upper-middle income. For the ROK, \nthe road to high income spanned 23 years, including 10 years in lower-\nmiddle income and 13 years in upper-middle income. The recordof the \nNIEs shows that innovation, human capital, and infrastructure all played \nvital roles in their remarkable transition from middle to high income. ", "100\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\nInnovation and infrastructure spur technological development\nAn important factor that enabled NIEs to achieve high and steady \ngrowth is the innovation that drove their rapid technological progress. \nBoththe ROK and Taipei,China sustained productivity increases \nthrough local \ufb01rms\u2019 development of new technologies (Cherif and \nHasanov2015, Ag\u00e9nor, Canuto, and Jelenic 2012). The drive toward \ninnovation was supported by strong protection of intellectual property \nrights. In 1990, or 5 years before the ROK graduated to high income, \nits number of patent applications was already comparable to that of \nGermany and the US (Figure 2.5.1). \nDirect government support played a key role in spurring  2.5.1\u2002 Patent applications in selectedeconomies,  \ninnovation among NIEs. In Taipei,China, the authorities had  1990 and 2014\na direct hand in creating innovative \ufb01rms.

Shifting to \na knowledge economy requires a development approach that emphasizes \nthe quality of education and includes R&D investments in science and \ntechnology. Figure 2.5.2 illustrates how NIEs in general have a stronger \nposition in research and knowledge creation than middle-income \neconomies. \nThe NIE experience shows that combining R&D and human \ncapital investments can shift an economy from investment-led growth \nto innovation-led growth, provided there is a sound institutional \nenvironment that provides incentives for the efficient use of knowledge.

During the 1960s and 1970s, secondary \neducation was made universal, and vocational and technical schools \nwere established to meet skills demand from manufacturing industries. \nThe ROK also established science and technology institutes, adopting \nUS-style graduate education and research system. In the early 1980s, \nthe ROK further expanded tertiary education to prepare for the \ntransition into advanced industry. Alongside education reform, the \nROK strengthened R&D capacity to boost human capital. During the \ntransition to upper middle income, knowledge production in the ROK \nincreased tremendously, with the number of scienti\ufb01c and technical \njournal articles multiplying sixfold in the decade to 1994, from 424 \nto2,931. \nIn the 1980s, the government encouraged the private sector to \nparticipate in R&D through incentives like tax subsidies. Even small and \nmedium-sized enterprises were actively involved in R&D, with some \nallocating as much as 10% of sales income to R&D. The transformation \nof the ROK into a knowledge-based economy enabled it to move toward \nthe production of high-technology goods.

Just as the transition from low to middleincome \nrequired rapid growth sustained over decades, the transition from \nmiddle to high income will also require that rapid growth is sustained. \nSustaining rapid growth will not be easy but is within the reach of \nmiddle-income Asia. Many factors that served the region well at \nlowincome, such as macroeconomic stability and high investment, \nwill serve it well at middle income. Some key ingredients of economic \ngrowth willpersist.", "Transcending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u2002103\nAt the same time, the pattern of growth will have to evolve if \nAsia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high income. \nThestructures of middle-income economies are different from those \nof low-income economies\u2014with, for example, higher stocks of human \nand physical capital\u2014so it is only natural that the contours of growth \nwill be somewhat different. In particular, the analysis indicates that \nproductivity growth will have to play a larger role in the transition. \nProductivity growth rests in turn on the three pillars of innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure. Therefore, the central mandate of \nAsian policy makers must be to foster more innovative economies by \nstrengthening education and investing in infrastructure.\nThe region\u2019s dynamic track record gives cause for optimism that \nthe authorities can adapt their growth models to overcome the middle-\nincome challenge. While completing the journey to high income is far \nfrom guaranteed, there is every reason to believe that good institutions \nand policies can lift developing Asia to high income.\nEndnotes\n1  Bangladesh; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Nepal; Pakistan; \nthe Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; and Thailand.\n2  The shares are based on 219 economies, of which 218 are from the \nWorld Bank database. Data on one economy, the Cook Islands, come \nfrom the Asian Development Outlook database.\n3  Capital per capita is calculated for each economy for 2014 based on \nthe PWT 9.0 database, which divides capital stock at current PPP by \npopulation size. \n4  For economies that do not report labor hours, it is assumed that \naverage labor hours change the same way as in the US over the \nperiod.\n5  See Eichengreen, Park and Shin (forthcoming) for results for other \nsubgroups, such as high-income economies that remain high income.\n6  An economy exports a product with revealed comparative advantage \nif the share of the product in its total exports is larger than the share \nof the product on the world market.\n7  Felipe et al. (2012) documented that, by category, the most complex \nproducts are machinery, chemicals, and metals, while the least \ncomplex products are raw materials and commodities, wood, \ntextiles, and agricultural products.\n8  Over the longer term, however, older populations will place \nsignificant strain on finances in Asia, not only in countries with \nespecially generous public support systems for the elderly but also \nin those that rely heavily on labor income taxes to finance public \nconsumption.\n9  The study of Abrigo, Lee, and Park (forthcoming) has quantitative \nestimates of the fiscal impact of different public investments in \nhuman capital in the 12 economies in developing Asia.", "104\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n10  This analysis leaves for a future study a deeper probe into how \neffectively productivity is boosted by human capital spending growth \nfrom the government versus from the privatesector.\n11  These were the Programme for International Student Assessment \nand the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.\n12  This section is based on material contributed by Christos Sakellariou.\n13  Largely credited to George Psacharopoulos. For a recent update, \nsee Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) and Montenegro and \nPatrinos(2014).\n14  Because of congestion, pollution, and other problems associated \nwiththe urbanization that occurs in the middle-income phase, \ncertain urban infrastructure also becomes more important for \nmiddle-income economies. However, lack of comprehensive data \nacross economies on urban infrastructure such as mass transit \nprevents further analysis here.\n15  The complete list of data sources used in this section can be found in \nAbiad, Debuque-Gonzales, and Sy (forthcoming). The sample period \nof the data starts in 1960 but is subject to data availability.\n16  Data on public investment is from the Investment and Capital \nStock Dataset of the International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs \nDepartment, and private infrastructure investment is from the \nWorld Bank Private Provision in Infrastructure Database. In the \nabsence of more direct measures, public investment often proxies \nfor government infrastructure spending. Public investment can \ninclude investment in non-infrastructure items such as machinery \nand equipment, inventories, valuables, and land. More disaggregated \ndata on public infrastructure investment is available only for OECD \neconomies. The Private Provision of Infrastructure Database covers \ninfrastructure investment by firms at least 20% privately owned.\n17  Formal tests of differences in coefficients support these conclusions.\n18  To save space, only the table for the middle-income subsample is \npresented. \n19  This identification strategy is very similar to the structure embedded \nin fiscal policy vector autoregressions.

However, growth has come with high economic vulnerability to international commodity prices and \ndevelopments in the Russian Federation. Tajikistan\u2019s goal in the medium-to-long term is to catch up with its neighbors and \nreach upper-middle-income status.

In 2015, the population grew by \nUrban\n1.6% to about 760,000, with 38.6% living in urban areas, many people  Rural\nhaving migrated to where the jobs are. The result is an urban housing  Total\nshortage. Thousand\nHousing has consistently been the greatest area of exposure for  800\nbanks. In September 2016, loans for housing amounted to Nu20 billion, \n600\nor nearly one-quarter of total bank lending. These loans are made mostly \n400\nto developers, however, to build multi-storey apartment blocks that are \nrented out to tenants. Thus, although units in these buildings are counted  200\nunder home ownership, they are actually owned by a limited number of \n0\nlandlords.

This is mainly an urban phenomenon as most rural \nhouseholds own their home, mostly owner built. In urban areas, \nonly 17% of households own their home. Although the government \nprovides some housing built by the National Housing Development \nCorporation, it is only for a small group of civil servants. Similarly, \nthequasi-governmental National Pension and Provident Fund provides \nhousing loans but only to its members, mainly civil servants and the \narmedforces. These institutions solve the housing problem for only a \nsmall segment of the population.\nAfter food, the largest expense for urban households is usually \nhousing rental.

The rise has been a result of oil \nexporters scaling back their output. Because India imports four-\ufb01fths \nof its petroleum needs, it was profoundly affected as the average \nimport price increased by 37.6% in FY2016. A rapid increase in the \nprice of oilchallenges macroeconomic stability in numerous ways \nas it undermines \ufb01scal consolidation, stokes in\ufb02ation, and swells the \ncurrentaccount de\ufb01cit. \nWith Indian consumption of petroleum products increasing by an  3.17.14\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 indexes\nannual average of 5.6% over the past 5 years, any sharp increase in oil \nManufacturing\nprices would widen the import bill considerably. With current import  Services\nvolumes, a $1 increase in oil prices raises the import bill by nearly \nIndex\n$2billion. However, as India exports re\ufb01ned petroleum products, some \n60\nof the increase in the import bill is offset by higher export earnings.

To rationalize subsidies, the government has been \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\nexpanding a program that pays the cooking gas subsidy directly \ninto recipients\u2019 bank accounts and incrementally raising the price of \nkerosene. Despite these measures, consumption of subsidized fuels is \nestimated to grow by 6% annually. Higher global oil prices will raise \nthe subsidy cost and could divert resources from growth-enhancing \ncapital expenditure. Further, a substantial rise in oil prices could force \nthe partial rolling back of excise duty hikes enacted in the second \nhalf of FY2015. The consequent loss of revenue would constrain \ufb01scal \nconsolidation.\nA rise in oil prices will directly affect decontrolled prices for \nvarious fuels with a combined weight of 2.4% on the consumer price \nindex. However, as nearly 40% of the market price of these fuels is ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia  India\u2002\u2002201\ngovernmenttax that would be unaffected by higher global prices, a 20% \nincrease in global oil prices would raise domestic prices for re\ufb01ned fuels \nby 12%, lifting retail in\ufb02ation by 30 basis points. The indirect effect will \nbe larger as higher fuel prices spillover to transportation costs.

This is to be done by making domestic production more efficient \nand attracting foreign and domestic private investment into the sector. \nA new hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy introduced in 2016 \nencourages participation by placing under a single license exploration for \nconventional and unconventional oil and gas resources including coal bed \nmethane, shale gas and oil, tight gas, and gas hydrates. It also introduces \na revenue-sharing model that is easy to administer and frees up the \nmarketing and pricing of the oil and natural gas produced.

State-owned  6\nenterprises currently dominate input supply, postharvest processing, \nand the marketing of produce. State enterprises also monopolize  4\nwholesaling, which means that an unnecessarily large share of the \n2\noutput price is absorbed by inefficient intermediaries.

Expenditure \nfor health, for example, was equivalent to about 4% of GDP in 2013, \nwellabove the 1.6% average in lower-middle-income economies, but \nPNG has struggled to translate high public expenditure into improved \nsocial and economic outcomes.

This constraint is exacerbated by \ninstitutional fragmentation and overlapping responsibilities for service \ndelivery to the poor. The upshot is that public \ufb01nance does not reach \nfrontline service providers in an efficient and timely way.\nThird, PNG should strengthen revenue collection and domestic \nresource mobilization.

Service delivery in PNG is \nlargely binary, public or private. A multi-institutional approach that \nleverages complementarity market, public, and civic solutions has a \nbetter chance of delivering lasting results. Public policy is to pursue such \nsolutions through national development plans, but the operationalization \nof this policy needs further support. Many private companies and other \nnongovernment agencies in remote areas are involved in providing \nbasic services. Strengthening and scaling up these services should be a \npolicy priority. Finally, the challenge for public policy, particularly from \nthe perspective of social equity, is to deliver such essentials as books, \npencils, and medicine effectively in remote places where instant noodles \nand chocolates have already found markets.", "Solomon Islands\nAlthough economic growth is broadly steady, it relies on expansionary fiscal policy and unsustainable \nlogging.

The economies are grouped into \ufb01ve subregions: Central Asia, \nEast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Paci\ufb01c. Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2012 to 2016; some have forecasts for 2017 \nand 2018.\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, de\ufb01nitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is \nbased on the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the \ndata on balance of payments are based on International Monetary \nFund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical data were obtained from \nofficial sources, statistical publications and databases, and documents \nof ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank. For some economies, data for \n2016 are estimated from the latest available information. Projections \nfor 2017 and 2018 are generally ADB estimates made on the bases of \navailable quarterly or monthly data, though some projections are from \ngovernments.\nMost economies report by calendar year.

South Asian \ncountries (except for the Maldives and Sri Lanka), the Cook Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, \nMyanmar, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga report all variables by \ufb01scal year.\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \ntables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, and \nA14, the averages are computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World Bank \nAtlas method. The GNI data for 2012\u20132015 were obtained from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online. Weights for 2015 \nwere carried over through 2018. The GNI data for the Cook Islands \nand Taipei,China were estimated using the Atlas conversion factor. \nFor tables A11 and A12, the regional and subregional averages were \ncomputed on the basis of a consistent sum, which means that if there are ", "Statistical appendix\u2002\u2002297\nmissing country data for a given year, the sum of the prior year used for \ncomputing the growth rate excludes the corresponding country data. \nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.

The table shows annual \ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, \nor basic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value \nadded of all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes \nless subsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar \ntaxes. Constant factor cost measures differ from market price measures \nin that they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic \nprice valuation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such \nas property and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as labor-\nrelated subsidies but not product-related subsidies. Most economies use \nconstant market price valuation. Pakistan uses constant factor costs, \nwhile Fiji, the Maldives, and Nepal use basic prices. \nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is de\ufb01ned as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. Data on per capita \ngross national income in US dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2015 \nare also shown, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s World Development \nIndicators online. The data for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China were \nestimated using the Atlas conversion factor.\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year). \nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current prices. \nThe agriculture sector comprises agricultural crops, livestock, poultry, \n\ufb01sheries, and forestry.\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). \nThetable provides the growth rates of value added in industry \nat constant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current \nprices. This sector comprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, \nconstruction, and utilities.\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). \nThe table gives the growth rates of value added in services at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current prices. \nSubsectors generally include trade, banking, \ufb01nance, real estate, public \nadministration, and other services. For Malaysia, electricity, gas, water, \nand waste management are included under services.\nTable A6: In\ufb02ation (% per year). Data on in\ufb02ation rates are \nperiodaverages.

Central \ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current \nand capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage \nof GDP at current prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenues exclude \nsocial security contributions. For Singapore, revenues include the net \ninvestment returns contribution. For Kazakhstan, revenues include \ntransfers from the national fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; revenues from \ndisinvestment are included for India; and only current revenues are \nincluded for Bangladesh.\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to \nboth current and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts \nare computed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, \nexpenditures refer to budgetary expenditures excluding externally \n\ufb01nanced expenditures and corresponding borrowing. Those for \nTajikistan include externally \ufb01nanced public investment programs. \nOne-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current \nprices. Data variations may arise from statistical discrepancies when, \nfor example, balancing items for both central and local governments, \nand from differences in the concept used in the individual computations \nof revenues and expenditures as compared with the calculation of the \n\ufb01scal balance. For Fiji, the \ufb01scal balance excludes total loan repayments. \nFor Thailand, the \ufb01scal balance is a cash balance composed of the \nbudgetary and nonbudgetary balances.

For Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR, debt service refers to external public debt only. For Viet Nam, \nexports of goods are used as the denominator in the calculation of the \nratio; for the Philippines, exports of goods, services, and income are \nused as the denominator. For Bangladesh, the ratio represents debt \nservice payments on medium- and long-term loans as a percentage \nof exports of goods, nonfactor services, and workers\u2019 remittances. \nForAzerbaijan, the ratio represents public and publicly guaranteed \nexternal debt service payments as a percentage of exports of goods and \nnonfactor services.", "300 Asian Development Outlook 2017\nTable A1\u2002Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nCentral Asia 5.5 6.6 5.2 3.1 2.1 3.1 3.5\nArmenia 7.2 3.3 3.6 3.0 0.2 2.2 2.5\nAzerbaijan 2.2 5.8 2.8 1.1 \u20133.8 \u20131.1 1.2\nGeorgia 6.4 3.4 4.6 2.9 2.7 3.8 4.5\nKazakhstan 4.8 6.0 4.2 1.2 1.0 2.4 2.2\nKyrgyz Republic \u20130.1 10.9 4.0 3.9 3.8 3.0 3.5\nTajikistan 7.5 7.4 6.7 6.0 6.9 4.8 5.5\nTurkmenistan 11.1 10.2 10.3 6.5 6.2 6.5 7.0\nUzbekistan 8.2 8.0 8.1 8.0 7.8 7.0 7.3\nEast Asia 6.7 6.8 6.6 6.1 6.0 5.8 5.6\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 7.9 7.8 7.3 6.9 6.7 6.5 6.2\nHong Kong, China 1.7 3.1 2.8 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.1\nKorea, Rep. of 2.3 2.9 3.3 2.6 2.7 2.5 2.7\nMongolia 12.3 11.6 7.9 2.4 1.0 2.5 2.0\nTaipei,China 2.1 2.2 4.0 0.7 1.5 1.8 2.2\nSouth Asia 5.5 6.1 6.7 7.2 6.7 7.0 7.2\nAfghanistan 11.4 3.9 1.3 0.8 2.0 2.5 3.0\nBangladesh 6.5 6.0 6.1 6.6 7.1 6.9 6.9\nBhutan 6.4 3.6 4.0 6.1 6.4 8.2 9.9\nIndia 5.5 6.5 7.2 7.9 7.1 7.4 7.6\nMaldives 2.5 4.7 6.0 2.8 3.4 3.8 4.1\nNepal 4.6 3.8 5.7 2.3 0.8 5.6 5.4\nPakistan 3.8 3.7 4.1 4.0 4.7 5.2 5.5\nSri Lanka 9.1 3.4 5.0 4.8 4.4 5.0 5.0\nSoutheast Asia 5.9 5.2 4.6 4.6 4.7 4.8 5.0\nBrunei Darussalam 0.9 \u20132.1 \u20132.5 \u20130.4 \u20132.5 1.0 2.5\nCambodia 7.3 7.4 7.1 7.0 7.0 7.1 7.1\nIndonesia 6.0 5.6 5.0 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.3\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

These factors will likely continue to support growth this year and next despite rebalancing \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China and tepid recovery in the advanced economies. Risks to growth stem from \nuncertain policy directions in the advanced economies, including an anticipated tightening of US monetary \npolicy. While short-term risks appear manageable, spillover to capital flows and exchange rates require \nmonitoring. \nDecades of rapid growth lifted most of developing Asia from low- to middle-income status. Sustained \ngrowth to escape the middle-income trap must come largely from improved total factor productivity, which \nis achieved by fostering entrepreneurial innovation and investing in human capital and infrastructure. The \ndifficult transition from middle to high income further demands a sound institutional framework and policy \nenvironment anchored on macroeconomic stability. Developing Asia\u2019s dynamic yet sure-footed track record \nindicates that it can transcend the middle-income challenge. \n \n \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n \nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \n  \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \n \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants,   \nand technical assistance.  \n \n     \n \nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines    \nwww.adb.org"], "metadata": {}}
