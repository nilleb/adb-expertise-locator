Higher external demand, rebounding global commodity prices, \nand domestic reform support widespread acceleration, with growth \npicking up in two-thirds of the region\u2019s 45 economies. Developing Asia \nwill continue to be the largest regional contributor to global growth, \neven with growth moderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nits largest economy.\n\nConsumption expenditure last year drove growth at 6.7% in \nthe PRC, where the authorities are rebalancing the economy to rely \nmore on domestic demand than exports. This is expected to temper \ngrowth further to 6.5% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018, with the government \nprioritizing financial and fiscal stability. While the forecast is for slower \ngrowth in East Asia, all other subregions will see growth accelerate in \nthe near term. \n\nIn South Asia, India moderated to 7.1% growth in 2016 as fixed \n\ninvestment stalled and the demonetization of large banknotes \ntemporarily stymied cash-reliant commerce. As reform gains \nmomentum, it is spurring investor confidence, and the economy is \nexpected to rebound to higher growth at 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2018. \nAn expected recovery in global fuel and food prices will benefit \ncommodity producers in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific. \nYet rises for commodities will be too modest to endanger price stability. \nWhile regional inflation is projected to accelerate to 3.0% in 2017 and \n3.2% in 2018, these rates remain well below the region\u2019s 10-year average \nof 3.9%.\n\nProspects for developing Asia are supported by improving fortunes \nfor the major industrial economies in the United States, the euro area, \nand Japan. Yet uncertain policy direction in these economies, \nincluding the pace of interest rate normalization in the US, poses \nrisks to the region\u2019s outlook. While short-term risks are manageable, \npolicy makers need to monitor developments closely and intervene \ndecisively if warranted. \n\nWhen the Asian Development Bank opened its doors in 1966, most \n\nof the region\u2019s citizens lived in low-income economies. Since then, \ncumulative national development efforts have transformed the region. \nToday, with most economies having successfully climbed the income \nladder\u2014including the most populous economies in the PRC, India, and \nIndonesia\u2014roughly 95% of the population lives in a middle-income \neconomy. The development challenge now is to climb one more rung to \nhigh income.\n\n\fHistory has shown this last rung to be a reach. The key is to \nmove from a basic development model that drives growth by applying \nmore factors of production\u2014land, labor, and capital\u2014toward a more \nsophisticated model that emphasizes catalyzing the productivity of all \nfactors. The Asian Development Outlook 2017 special chapter points to \nthe nexus of innovation, human capital, and infrastructure to boost \nproductivity. Innovation enables the development of a diverse and \nsophisticated product mix. Investment in human capital helps workers \nmeet emerging workplace needs, and investment in infrastructure \nfacilitates structural change. \n\nWe at the Asian Development Bank take pride in our role supporting \n\nthe region\u2019s transformation over the past 50 years. But we cannot \nbe complacent. Several challenges remain and new challenges have \nemerged in Asia. As governments adapt their development paradigms \nto sustain growth and eliminate the poverty that remains along the \npath to high income, we will adapt to help our clients meet their \nnew challenges.\n\nTAKEHIKO NAKAO \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2017 was prepared by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Central and West Asia Department, \nEast Asia Department, Pacific Department, South Asia Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, as well as in ADB resident missions. \nRepresentatives of these departments constituted the Regional Economic \nOutlook Task Force, which met regularly to coordinate and develop \nconsistent forecasts for the region.\n\nThe authors who contributed the sections are bylined in each \nchapter.

The region is forecast to expand by 5.7% \nin 2017 and 2018, nearly the 5.8% growth achieved in 2016, as moderation in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is balanced by a healthy pickup in most other \neconomies in the region. \n\nIn\ufb02ation revived to 2.5% in 2016 on the back of strong consumer demand and \nrebounding global commodity prices. The pace will accelerate further to 3.0% \nin 2017 and 3.2% in 2018, still below the average rate for the past 10 years.\n\nThe region faces risks from uncertain policy direction in the advanced \neconomies, including the pace of interest rate normalization in the \nUnited States. While short-term risks seem manageable, regional policy makers \nshould remain vigilant to respond to possible spillover through capital \ufb02ows and \nexchange rate movements. \n\nDecades of rapid growth transformed developing Asia from a low-income \nregion to middle income. Sustaining growth to power the transition into high \nincome will depend on much greater improvement to productivity. Innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure are the three pillars of productivity growth. \nSupportive institutions and policies, underpinned by macroeconomic stability, \ncan strengthen all three pillars. Asia\u2019s dynamic track record suggests that the \njourney to high income, while challenging, is achievable.\n\nYasuyuki Sawada\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fxii Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\n\nAsia tacks to shifting headwinds\n\n(cid:31) Continued expansion helps developing Asia deliver more than 60% of global \n\ngrowth. Gross domestic product (GDP) for the region as a whole is expected to grow by \n5.7% in 2017 and 2018, a tick down from the 2016 outcome of 5.8% as the controlled \nmoderation of growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is balanced by expected \nhealthy growth elsewhere. Excluding the high-income newly industrialized economies\u2014\nthe Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, China\u2014regional growth \nis expected to reach 6.3% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018. Growth is picking up in 30 of the \n45 economies in developing Asia, supported by higher external demand and rebounding \nglobal commodity prices.\n\n\u00bb The industrial economies are gathering some growth momentum. After slowing \nin the \ufb01rst half of 2016, the euro area, Japan, and the United States are forecast \nto grow collectively by 1.9% in both 2017 and 2018. Recovery in the US is solid as \nunemployment has declined to 4.7%, and as consumer and business con\ufb01dence \nsoar, but con\ufb01dence depends on the policy directions under the new administration. \nIn the euro area as well, recovery is evident but more fragile in light of the uncertain \nfuture of the economic union. In Japan, the recovery will continue but may lose some \nsteam unless export growth maintains its new momentum.\n\n\u00bb The PRC continues to rebalance, depending more on consumption to drive \ngrowth. A further shift of economic activity from industry to services shows \nrebalancing progressing as planned. Growth in the PRC now relies more on \ninternal demand and less on exports. Moderate deceleration of growth to 6.5% is \nexpected in 2017, within the government\u2019s target range, and further to 6.2% in 2018. \nThe authorities are likely to emphasize the maintenance of \ufb01nancial and \ufb01scal \nstability and accept the cost of marginally lower growth. \n\n\u00bb India\u2019s expansion will bounce back from a temporary liquidity squeeze.\n\nThe decision to demonetize high-denomination banknotes in November 2016 \nquelled cash-intensive economic activity, but the impact is expected to be \nshort lived. Government deregulation and reform of taxes on goods and services, \namong other areas, should improve con\ufb01dence and thus business investment and \ngrowth prospects. Growth is expected to edge up to 7.4% in 2017 and 7.6% in 2018.\n\n\u00bb Growth in Southeast Asia is forecast to accelerate further. After rising \n\n0.1 percentage points to 4.7% in 2016, growth will continue to improve to 4.8% \nin 2017 and 5.0% in 2018, with nearly all Southeast Asian economies showing an \nupward trend. Recovery for global food and fuel prices and in agricultural output will \nhelp commodity producers such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. Indonesia, \nthe largest economy in the subregion, should see \ufb01scal and structural reforms boost \ndomestic demand.\n\n\u00bb Prospects for Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c rise along with commodity prices.\nHigher oil prices will support \ufb01scal spending in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and \none-off currency depreciation in these economies has already improved net exports. \nGrowth in Central Asia is projected to accelerate to 3.1% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018, \n\n\fHighlights\n\nxiii\n\nthough individual economies are growing at signi\ufb01cantly different rates. In the \nPaci\ufb01c, rising commodity prices are taking some pressure off a \ufb01scal crunch in \nPapua New Guinea. With Fiji and Vanuatu recovering from natural disasters suffered \nin 2015, the Paci\ufb01c subregion as a whole will grow by 2.9% in 2017 and 3.3% in 2018.\n\n(cid:31) Strong consumer demand and rising global commodity prices will boost in\ufb02ation. \nAfter rising 0.3 percentage points to 2.5% in 2016, regional in\ufb02ation is projected to \naccelerate further to 3.0% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. The pickup also re\ufb02ects the \ntemporary effects of the large devaluations in some Central Asian economies. Overall, \nprice rises are still reasonable, below the 10-year average of 3.9%, and unlikely to alter \nAsian expectations of relatively stable prices.\n\n(cid:31) The region\u2019s current account surplus will narrow even as exports recover. As a share \nof world GDP, developing Asia\u2019s current account surplus is forecast to narrow from 0.7% \nin 2016 to less than 0.5% in both 2017 and 2018. Recent data suggest improved exports \nfrom many Asian economies, particularly traditional exporters of manufactured goods, \nyet the recovery in imports is even stronger. At the same time, though, rebalancing is \nprogressing in the PRC as it relies more on private consumption for growth. \n\n(cid:31) Uncertain policy directions abroad could undermine the regional outlook.\n\nWhile baseline assumptions have factored in gradual increases in US interest rates, \nsharper-than-expected US monetary tightening could have further consequences for \ndeveloping Asia. Economies in the region with high corporate or household debt would \nbe particularly vulnerable to \ufb01nancial shock. Possible shifts in trade and tax policies, \nespecially policy changes being discussed in the US, could create uncertainty for business \ninvestment and export growth in developing Asia. While a potential boon to the region\u2019s \noil importers, weaker-than-expected oil price trends could delay recovery in oil and gas \nexporters in Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c.\n\nRisk of sharper US interest rate hikes\n\n(cid:31) The US Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates sharply. As Asia braces \nfor higher US interest rates, the question is how much higher? A recent surge in \nUS in\ufb02ation may accelerate the tightening cycle for interest rates that is now under way. \nHowever, interest rate increases sharper than the expected gradual rise would have to \nbe accompanied by more acceleration in US economic growth than is currently forecast. \nSuch a scenario could be envisaged under a possible \ufb01scal stimulus later in 2017, but \neven then, any pickup in US growth would take time to materialize.\n\n(cid:31) The consequences would differ across Asia depending on exchange rate regime. \nUS monetary tightening would put pressure on Asian currencies to depreciate against \nthe dollar, but the impact would depend on how the exchange rate is managed. \nAbsent monetary policy response from regional authorities, economies with more \nopen capital accounts would tend to experience deeper currency depreciation. \nEconomies where the authorities intervene to maintain a stable currency would tend to \nforfeit export price competitiveness to those with more \ufb02exible exchange rate regimes. \nHowever, in\ufb02ation could intensify under \ufb02exible arrangements, imperiling domestic \nmacroeconomic stability. In this case, the authorities might \ufb01nd it necessary to tighten \ndomestic liquidity to contain pressures on exchange rates and consumer prices.\n\n\fxiv Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nCapital \ufb02ows and \ufb01nancial risks\n\n(cid:31) Economies in emerging Asia are already experiencing net capital out\ufb02ows.\n\nThe PRC drives the overall direction of \ufb02ows in the region, and out\ufb02ows from its banking \nactivities and portfolio investments generated net out\ufb02ows of $35 billion beginning in \nthe second quarter of 2014 that expanded to exceed $130 billion in the third quarter \nof 2016. Even foreign direct investment has turned to net out\ufb02ow since the second half \nof 2015 as PRC investment abroad has risen and in\ufb02ows declined. Despite the negative \ntrend in net \ufb02ows overall, some variation persists, with India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam \nnotable among those still capitalizing on net in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment. \n\n(cid:31) Net out\ufb02ow from economies in emerging Asia is expected to continue next year.\nAs the global economy starts to pick up, uncertainty will become a key theme for \ninvestors in 2017. Continuing US economic improvement, as marked by normalization of \nits monetary policy, will be a pull factor for capital to \ufb02ow out of the region. Other major \nrisks to \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia are policy and political uncertainty in the US \nand the euro area, as well as possible further currency depreciation in the PRC.\n\n(cid:31) Global liquidity conditions mitigate the risk of destabilizing capital out\ufb02ows.\nAlthough US monetary policy normalization raises the prospect of out\ufb02ows from \ndeveloping Asia, the continuation of accommodative monetary policies in other \nadvanced economies limits the tightening of overall global liquidity. Since this eases the \npressure on central banks to raise interest rates to manage capital movements, they still \nretain some scope for supporting the region\u2019s growth momentum.\n\n(cid:31) One risk is mounting household debt in some Asian economies. The ratio of debt to \nGDP has surged in several economies, notably rising in the Republic of Korea from 74% \nin late 2008 to nearly 91% in the third quarter of 2016, and to about 71% in Malaysia \nand Thailand. So far the risk from high household leverage in the region is contained \nby favorable growth and employment conditions, fairly stable asset prices, and well \ncapitalized banking sectors with low nonperforming loan ratios. However, there is scope \nto further bolster macroprudential policy, such as tightening ratios of debt to income and \nof loans to asset values. Policy makers may also have to stress-test their banking sectors \nregularly to track bank exposure and identify needs for special reserves. They may have \nto intervene more decisively in housing markets as well to cool speculative demand and \nhead off asset bubbles.\n\n\fHighlights\n\nxv\n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n(cid:31) Average growth in developing Asia slows, upstaging higher projections for most \n\neconomies. Growth is forecast to accelerate in two-thirds of the region\u2019s economies and \nin all of the subregions except East Asia. The external environment generally supports \ngrowth. A projected mild rise in commodity prices will help oil and gas exporters but \nnot at the expense of importers. Demand for the region\u2019s exports in general will bene\ufb01t \nfrom an expected pickup in the major industrial economies and the Russian Federation. \nHowever, country-speci\ufb01c factors still generate considerable diversity in expected growth \nand in\ufb02ation across the region. \n\n(cid:31) East Asia\u2019s growth slowdown re\ufb02ects continued moderation in the PRC. Subregional \n\ngrowth dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 6.0% in 2016. The PRC slowed to 6.7% \ndespite \ufb01scal and monetary support as private investment weakened. Growth also \ndipped in Mongolia as construction faltered and in Hong Kong, China as tourist arrivals \ndropped. The rate is projected to moderate further in the PRC to 6.5% this year and \n6.2% next as structural reform continues and the authorities emphasize \ufb01nancial \nstability. This will push the subregional average down to 5.8% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018. \nYet large government outlays will lift growth in Taipei,China and Hong Kong, China \nthis year and the next. Mining investment will buoy growth in Mongolia, and the return \nof political stability in the Republic of Korea should pay a mild growth dividend in 2018. \nIn\ufb02ation accelerated in East Asia last year but slowed in Mongolia on lower meat prices. \nSubregional in\ufb02ation is expected to pick up modestly from 1.9% in 2016 to 2.3% in 2017 \nand 2.6% in 2018. \n\n(cid:31) South Asia resumes faster growth after a brief pause. Subregional growth dropped \nby 0.5 percentage points to 6.7% in 2016 on account of slowing growth in India. \nDespite stronger government consumption and external demand, growth faltered in \nIndia to 7.1% from 7.9% in 2015 as \ufb01xed investment languished and demonetization \ntemporarily stymied commerce. Growth in South Asia is forecast to rebound to 7.0% \nin 2017 and pick up further to 7.2% in 2018. India will see growth reaccelerate to 7.4% \nin \ufb01scal 2017 and 7.6% in 2018 despite drag caused by excessive corporate investment \nin the past and bank lending currently constrained by a heavy load of stressed assets. \nElsewhere, growth will be lifted by spending on earthquake reconstruction in Nepal, \nhydropower investment and output in Bhutan, and economic corridor investment from \nthe PRC in Pakistan. In\ufb02ation in South Asia has trended lower in recent years, easing \nto 4.6% in 2016 as buyers bene\ufb01ted from low prices for oil and other commodities. \nWith these prices turning upward over the forecast period, in\ufb02ation is projected to revive \nto 5.2% in 2017 and 5.4% in 2018. \n\n(cid:31) Southeast Asian prospects brighten with buoyant growth across the subregion. \nEconomic expansion accelerated by 4.7% in 2016, up by 0.1 percentage points from \nthe previous year, as growth edged higher in several larger economies: Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Thailand. With normal weather supporting agriculture and \nsteady recovery in the major industrial economies boosting exports, growth will pick \nup in nearly all of the economies in the subregion, nudging average growth to 4.8% \nin 2017 and 5.0% in 2018. The only exception is the Philippines, where growth will \nmoderate from its record 6.8% in 2016 to a pace approximating 6.5% this year and next. \nWhile higher infrastructure investment will provide an additional impetus to growth in \nBrunei Darussalam, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, \n\n\fxvi Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nand Thailand, record foreign direct investment will be a key factor supporting growth \nin Viet Nam. Strengthening growth and rising international oil prices will mean higher \nin\ufb02ation and a narrower current account surplus for the subregion. Average in\ufb02ation is \nforecast to rise from 2.1% in 2016 to 3.3% this year, edging up further to 3.5% next year. \n\n(cid:31) Central Asia looks forward to a modest growth rebound. Continued low oil prices, \nrecession in the Russian Federation, and weakness in other trading partners cut growth \nin Central Asia to 2.1% in 2016 from 3.1% a year earlier. Declining oil revenues hit \nAzerbaijan and Kazakhstan particularly hard, with the former falling into recession. \nAnticipated recovery for international oil prices and for growth in the Russian Federation \nare projected to boost expansion in the subregion to 3.1% in 2017. Growth will accelerate \nfurther to 3.5% in 2018 as every economy except Kazakhstan improves its performance. \nThe lagged effects of currency depreciation in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and to a lesser \nextent in Tajikistan, stoked in\ufb02ation by almost 5 percentage points to 11.1% in 2016, even \nas in\ufb02ation slowed in Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and \nsank into de\ufb02ation in Armenia. As the effects from currency depreciation abate, in\ufb02ation \nis projected to decelerate to 7.8% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018. \n\n(cid:31) The Paci\ufb01c will see growth revive on developments in Papua New Guinea. Growth \n\nslowed substantially to 2.6% in 2016 as contraction hit the oil and gas sector in Papua \nNew Guinea, slashing the growth rate in the subregion\u2019s predominant economy by \n10.0 percentage points to 2.0%. Elsewhere, growth picked up in 2016 in most Paci\ufb01c \neconomies\u2014by more than 4 percentage points in Nauru, Samoa, and Vanuatu. Increased \nmining and agriculture output is forecast to spur a mild recovery in Papua New Guinea, \nwhich will translate into a modest rebound for the subregion to 2.9% growth this year \nand 3.3% next. Steady or slower growth is expected in most other economies, with \ndeclines in public expenditure inducing relatively sharp slowdowns in Nauru, Samoa, \nand Timor-Leste. Although in\ufb02ation eased in most economies in 2016, the aggregate \nin\ufb02ation rate rose by 0.6 percentage points to 4.6%, driven by rising consumer prices \nin Papua New Guinea. Rising oil and food prices will push in\ufb02ation higher in most of \nthe economies this year. Subregional in\ufb02ation is expected to be 5.2% in 2017 and 5.4% \nin 2018.\n\n\fHighlights\n\nxvii\n\nTranscending the middle-income challenge\n\nSustaining growth at middle income\n\n (cid:31) Rapid growth has lifted most economies in developing Asia to middle income. \nThe rise of Asia\u2019s newly industrialized economies in the 1970s and 1980s was well \ndocumented. Less publicized was that more than 90% of the people in the region still \nlived in low-income economies in 1991, half again the global average of less than 60%. \nBy 2015, the story had changed. Propelled by the rising fortunes of the most populous \nAsian economies\u2014the PRC, India, and Indonesia\u2014more than 95% of the population \nlived in middle-income economies. The question now is how a largely middle-income \nregion can build on its past success.\n\n (cid:31) Global experience suggests that the jump to high income can be difficult. The rapid \ntransition of the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, which moved from middle income \nto high in barely a quarter of a century, raised hopes for the region\u2019s current middle-\nincome cohort. However, the experience of most developing economies globally \nthreatens to put these hopes on hold. Brazil and Colombia, for example, have been \nmiddle income for more than half a century. Middle-income economies face a difficult \ntask in sustaining growth sufficiently to clear the hurdle to high income.\n\n (cid:31) As economies evolve from low to middle income, so do their growth drivers. \n\nWhile accumulating physical and human capital remains important for growth in middle-\nincome economies, these economies have already signi\ufb01cantly expanded their stocks \nof both. The median number of years of schooling for middle-income economies is 6.1, \nmore than double the 2.5 years for low-income economies. Similarly, middle-income \neconomies have more capital per worker and better-developed \ufb01nancial systems than do \nlow-income economies. Total factor productivity improvement, or growth in production \nnot derived from higher use of inputs, plays a bigger role in growth for middle-income \neconomies, particularly those successfully reaching high income.\n\n (cid:31) The successful middle-income growth model emphasizes productivity. Innovation \nbecomes more important when economies already reap the bene\ufb01ts of efficiently using \nexisting resources. Even as they accumulate more physical and human capital, the focus \nshifts to areas with more positive productivity spillover, like advanced infrastructure and \nhigher education. Finally, the whole process must be underpinned by a supportive policy \nenvironment and a stable macroeconomic environment.\n\nInnovation for diversifying and upgrading production\n\n (cid:31) Innovation matters more as economies approach the technological frontier. \n\nA more central role in productivity growth falls to innovation with the decline of other \nsources, such as labor\u2019s migration from agriculture to manufacturing. Middle-income \neconomies that have graduated to high income have more than 2.5 times the research \nand development stock per worker as other middle-income economies. Risk-taking \nentrepreneurs take the lead in fostering innovation, and these individuals respond \nto incentives that are either strengthened or weakened by economic policies and \ninstitutions. Governments can promote innovative entrepreneurship through stronger \nintellectual property protection and rule of law, better access to \ufb01nance, and effective \ncompetition policies. \n\n\fxviii Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n(cid:31) Entrepreneurship turns new ideas or technology into innovation-based growth.\n\nAs economies become more sophisticated, opportunity-driven entrepreneurship, which \nis often built on new ideas or technology, increasingly outweighs necessity-driven \nentrepreneurship, which responds to existing market needs. The ratio of opportunity-\ndriven to necessity-driven entrepreneurship is 1.6 times higher in high-income \neconomies than in middle-income ones. Therefore, to reach high income, middle-income \neconomies should encourage and nurture new business entries that pursue new business \nopportunities and provide products or services novel to the market. \n\n(cid:31) Graduation to high income requires a diverse and sophisticated product mix. \n\nIn addition to producing a wider range of goods, middle-income economies must aim to \nproduce more complex goods, such as sophisticated machinery and modern chemicals \nand alloys, that support higher productivity and better wages. Noteworthy is the \nexperience of the PRC, which ranked for product complexity at only 48 in the mid-1990s \nbut at 19 in 2014. Enhanced human capital is the foundation for a transition to a more \ndiverse and complex product mix.\n\nHuman capital for emerging marketplace needs\n\n(cid:31) Human capital accumulation can promote both growth and equity. Estimates \nindicate that a 20% increase in human capital spending per capita can raise labor \nproductivity by up to 3.1% and narrow labor income inequality by up to 4.5%. The bonus \nin income growth is more salient among poorer families, which may explain the income-\nequalizing effect. Public education in particular enhances equity, yet some regional \neconomies spend less per child than other economies at the same income. Evidence \nshows that higher public spending on education need not harm public \ufb01nances. \nAugmented labor incomes expand the tax base and hence tax revenues. Finally, \nas regional populations age, enhancing worker quality can help compensate for the \nshrinking share of the working-age population. \n\n(cid:31) The emphasis needs to be on ramping up the quality of education. Increasing the \naverage years of schooling a young person receives can boost growth but less so than \nimproving the quality of education and enhancing cognitive skills like math and science. \nEconomies with relatively high cognitive skills bene\ufb01t from having a critical mass of \nstudents likely to become innovators. Research indicates that, as economies move \ncloser to the technological frontier, the returns on research-oriented innovation pick up \ntangibly. Consequently, middle-income Asia needs to strengthen its research-oriented \neducation while sustaining its achievements in basic education. \n\n(cid:31) Middle-income economies need to close education gaps with high-income \n\neconomies. While differences in educational attainment remain substantial, especially \nin tertiary education, gaps in the quality of education offered by different education \nsystems are spectacular. In globally standardized math and science tests, the proportion \nof top-performing 15-year-old students in the advanced economies is on average \n4\u20135 times the proportion in middle-income economies, while the share of low \nperformers in middle-income economies is more than 2 times the advanced average. \nAn exception like Viet Nam, which ranks at 8 among the 72 economies covered, appears \nto demonstrate that the gap can be closed with sound education policies.\n\n\fHighlights\n\nxix\n\nInfrastructure investment for facilitating structural change\n\n(cid:31) Economies prioritize different types of infrastructure as they develop.\n\nADB reported this year that developing Asia has large investment needs across all \ntypes of infrastructure\u2014from water supply and sanitation to transport, power, and \ntelecommunications. But infrastructure needs shift as an economy becomes more \ncomplex and sophisticated. Low-income economies focus \ufb01rst on such basic needs \nas water supply, sanitation, and a transportation network to get goods and people to \nmarket. As basic needs are met and economic structures evolve, more importance is \nattached to electricity supply and advanced infrastructure such as information and \ncommunication technology.\n\n(cid:31) Advanced infrastructure can help sustain growth in middle-income economies. \n\nThe fastest-growing middle-income economies differ from their slower-growing peers in \na couple of important ways. They invest more in infrastructure and tend to have more of \ncertain types of infrastructure. Mobile telephone and broadband networks, for example, \nare vital tools for creating and disseminating knowledge. Middle-income economies \nthat graduate to high income have 18 more internet users and 31 more mobile phone \nsubscriptions per 100 people than their peers. Investment in advanced infrastructure can \nboost growth by promoting both innovation and human capital. The nexus of advanced \ninfrastructure, highly developed skills, and innovation can help sustain growth enough to \nensure a successful transition to high income.\n\n(cid:31) Investment in infrastructure boosts output, not least in middle-income economies. \nAnalysis using a sample of developing economies shows that a one-time increase in \npublic infrastructure investment that equals 1.0% of GDP immediately lifts output \nby 0.3% of GDP and by nearly 1.2% after 7 years. Notably, this signi\ufb01cantly positive \neffect, both in the short term and over the long run, is still robust when the sample is \nnarrowed to middle-income economies. This underscores the potential bene\ufb01ts of an \ninfrastructure push.\n\nReaching toward high income\n\n(cid:31) Sound policies and institutions are vital to transformative growth. The role of \n\ngovernment necessarily evolves as an economy progresses, becoming more nuanced \nas the private sector develops. Government must shape an environment conducive to \ninnovative entrepreneurship by promoting investment in education and infrastructure. \nAs shown by Thailand\u2019s successful experience with industry\u2013government coordination \nin the automobile industry, direct government intervention can, if selective and well \ntargeted, foster an output mix that is more diverse and sophisticated. The case for \nintervention is stronger when a government has adequate institutional capacity. \n\n(cid:31) An environment conducive to growth needs macroeconomic stability. Empirical \nestimates show that when a country reaches middle income, its growth rate is more \nvulnerable to indicators affecting macroeconomic stability\u2014such as whether the country \nfaces a banking or currency crisis, the extent of capital in\ufb02ows other than foreign \ninvestment, and government debt as a share of GDP. The region should continue to \nprotect macroeconomic stability, as it has done very well in the past. \n\n\fxx Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n(cid:31) Sustaining rapid growth is not easy but is within reach for middle-income Asia. \n\nMany norms that served the region well at low income, such as macroeconomic stability \nand high investment, still serve it well at middle income. At the same time, the pattern \nof growth will have to evolve if Asia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high \nincome.

The main reasons for the nascent \nturnaround were the bottoming out of oil prices, higher \nexternal demand from the United States and the European \nUnion, and \ufb01scal stimulus and a slight easing of \ufb01nancial \nconditions in some economies (Figure 1.0.1). This occurred \nagainst the backdrop of looming structural change in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and other East Asian \neconomies that, coupled with a need for corporate debt \nrestructuring, could undermine growth. Some fast-growing \neconomies in South and Southeast Asia will need to pick up \nthe slack. The PRC is now the world\u2019s second-largest \neconomy and larger than the rest of developing Asia and the \nPaci\ufb01c combined (Figure 1.0.2). The next largest economies, \nIndia and Indonesia, are implementing important structural \nreforms that should improve their medium-term growth \nprospects, and the bene\ufb01ts are already coming into view in \nthe turnaround in regional growth.\n\nIn\ufb02ation rose in 2016, and the forecast for 2017 and 2018 \nis for more increases across the board except in Central Asia, \nwhere in\ufb02ation will moderate because of a high base in 2016 \nfollowing currency devaluation the year before. Asia\u2019s external \ncurrent account maintained its surplus with the rest of the \nworld in 2016, but it is likely to narrow in 2017 and 2018.\nAsia\u2019s near-term outlook is solid. Growth in the PRC \nwill continue to moderate but do so manageably as long \nas \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows remain stable. The outlook assumes \nthat, as the United States economy normalizes in 2017 and \n2018, the Fed funds rate will rise. However, if US rates rise \ntoo quickly, central banks in Asia may need to follow suit. \nPossible changes in US tax and trade policies may dampen \nbusiness sentiment for globally oriented companies \ninvesting in Asia. In general, developing Asia\u2019s outlook \nwould be undercut if trade became less open, but real impact \nfrom any policy changes is unlikely to materialize until the \nsecond half of 2018.\n\nThis chapter was written by Valerie Mercer-Blackman, Arief Ramayandi, Benno Ferrarini, \nMadhavi Pundit, Shiela Camingue-Romance, Cindy Castillejos-Petalcorin, Marthe \nHinojales, Nedelyn Magtibay-Ramos, Pilipinas Quising, and Dennis Sorino of the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n1.0.1\u2002 World growth and forecasts \n\nDeveloping Asia\nDeveloping Asia excluding the NIEs\nMajor industrial economies\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nNotes: The major industrial economies are the euro area, Japan, and the \nUnited States.

Aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) \nin the region will expand by 5.7% in 2017 and 2018, down \nslightly from 5.8% in 2016 (Figure 1.1.1). The slower expansion \nre\ufb02ects moderating growth in the PRC that more than offsets \nfaster expansion elsewhere. The PRC continues its shift \ntoward less dependence on investment and manufacturing. In \n2017, growth in the region will remain steady as solid growth \nin India and a pickup in other larger economies, notably in \nSoutheast Asia, offset continued slowing of growth in the \nPRC. Average in\ufb02ation in the region will rise from 2.5% in \n2016 to 3.0% in 2017 on strengthening domestic demand and \nrecovery in global commodity prices, and further to 3.2% in \n2018 with a further rise in oil prices (Figure 1.1.2). \n\nThe region\u2019s aggregate current account surplus will \n\nnarrow from 2.3% in 2016 to 1.9% in 2017 and further to 1.7% \nin 2018 as export growth is likely to be outpaced in most \neconomies by import growth to support domestic economic \nactivity (Figure 1.1.3). Further, the recovery in the industrial \neconomies remains modest (Box 1.1.1).\n\nSlower growth in 2016\nGrowth in developing Asia slowed in 2016 for a third \nconsecutive year, mirroring continued growth moderation \nin the PRC and the modest outturn in most economies \nlast year. The growth slowdown was widespread, affecting \nmost economies in the region, particularly in East and \nCentral Asia. Average growth slipped from 6.0% in 2015 to \n5.8% in 2016.\n\nGrowth in East Asia edged down to 6.0% in 2016 from \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6.1% in 2015 as private consumption slowed and exports \nwithered. Moderating growth in the PRC continued to \nweigh on the region\u2019s performance, reducing growth for \na third straight year. In Mongolia, growth dropped by \n1.4 percentage points, and in Hong Kong, China by 0.5 points, \nbecause of lackluster consumer spending. Growth improved \nby less than a percentage point in the Republic of Korea (ROK), and by \n0.8 percentage points in Taipei,China, as strong investment\u2014propelled \nby higher construction in the ROK and by strong demand for machinery \nand transport equipment in Taipei,China\u2014countered feeble exports. \n\nIn Central Asia, growth weakened to 2.1% from 3.1% in 2015 as seven \nof the eight economies, excepting only Tajikistan, posted slower growth \non account of weaker global oil prices, higher prices for nonfood imports \nresulting from currency depreciation, and recession in the Russian \nFederation, a key trade partner and source of remittances, which quelled \n\n1.1.1\u2002 Growth in developing Asia and subregional contributions\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.1.2\u2002 Inflation in developing Asia\n\n3.0\n\n2.2\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.2\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u20025\n\n1.1.1\u2002Clear but fragile recovery in 2016\n\nCombined growth in the major industrial economies\u2014the \nUS, the euro area, and Japan\u2014was stronger in 2016 and \nthe first quarter of 2017 than forecast.

Consumption continues to \ngrow, with consumer confidence rebounding quite strongly \nin February 2017 to reach its highest monthly level since \nJuly 2001. Manufacturing is gradually recovering, while \nindustrial production and purchasing managers\u2019 indexes \nshow moderate expansion in February 2017, suggesting \ncontinuing production recovery. Meanwhile, a positive trend \nin the labor market continued as the unemployment rate fell \nfurther in February 2017 to 4.7%. \n\nWith signs that the output gap may have closed, the \nFederal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy \nin 2017. Headline inflation is on a rising trend since 2015. \nThe trend continued in 2017 with inflation climbing to 2.5% \nin January. The Fed raised the target range for the federal \nfunds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016 and by \nanother 25 basis points in March 2017. Continuing gradual \nincreases are expected during the next 2 years, bringing the \nrate to about 1.4% by the end of 2017 and 2.4% at the end of \n2018. This expectation of rate hikes have been incorporated \ninto the baseline projections. Higher interest rates will \nlikely strengthen the US dollar further, as it continues to \nappreciate against most major currencies. GDP will grow at \n2.4% in both 2017 and 2018 as growth continues.\n\nGrowth momentum in the euro area strengthened in \nthe past year. After a blip in the second quarter of 2016, \nwhich coincided with the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit \nreferendum in June, recovery in the euro area continued to \naccelerate in the second half, bringing GDP growth to 1.7% \nfor the whole of 2016. Domestic demand was supported \nby accommodative policies and improving labor markets. \n\nThe recovery in exports remains fragile. The unemployment \nrate improved to 9.6% in December, its lowest since \nApril 2009. Consumer confidence remains upbeat while \nthe composite purchasing managers\u2019 index has risen to its \nhighest since April 2011, suggesting that corporate activity \nis picking up. In February, economic sentiment climbed to \nits highest point in 6 years. The United Kingdom\u2019s decision \nto leave the European Union seems thus far to have slowed \nregional growth less than expected, and economic sentiment \nappears to be positive, however fragile.\n\nDespite emerging price pressures, the European Central \n\nBank kept its interest rates unchanged at its March 2017 \nmeeting. Earlier in December, it decided to extend its \nquantitative easing program by 9 months to the end of 2017. \nIn February, inflation accelerated further to 2.0% with a \nsharper jump in energy prices. The euro remains somewhat \nweak, but this may help net exports recover.\n\nThe baseline projection assumes GDP growth will hold \nsteady at 1.6% in 2017 and 2018. While negotiations on the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s separation from the European Union \nhave been triggered, they are unlikely to drag significantly \non growth until perhaps late 2018, when the shape of Brexit \nmay be clearer. Meanwhile, concerns about Greek debt \nhave resurfaced and could dampen business confidence \nas elections loom in France, Germany, and possibly Italy. \nThe baseline forecast assumes an improving outlook for \nglobal growth and trade, as well as some recovery in \ninvestment.\n\nJapan\u2019s economy grew by 1.0%, less than in 2015. \n\nGrowth in 2016 came from strong expansion in the first half \nof the year, first an uptick in consumption and net exports, \nand then in private investment. Exports contributed to \ngrowth, particularly in the fourth quarter, when they rose \nby 8.9%. As recent monthly indicators suggest that domestic \ndemand remains sluggish, the recovery may lose steam. \nFor example, manufacturing growth turned positive in the \nthird quarter of 2016 but improved only slightly thereafter. \nOther data suggest that business sentiment remains \ncautious, though the purchasing managers\u2019 index is above \nthe threshold of 50, indicating expansion in manufacturing. \nConsumer confidence, which in September hit its highest \npoint in 3 years, declined in the following months owing to \nweak wage growth. With government stimulus, the Bank \nof Japan projects that public investment will rise through \nFY2017 (ends 31 March 2018). With inflation stirring to \nonly 0.5% in January 2017, the short-term policy interest \nrate was kept at \u20130.1 percent and the target yield for 10-year \nJapanese government bonds continues to be zero. \nThe Japanese economy is expected to continue \n\nexpanding at a modest pace, with growth forecast at 1.0% \nfor 2017. The recovery is precariously balanced. While a \nweak yen and an uptick in global demand have boosted \nexports recently, confidence has yet to show a very robust \nresponse.\n\n\f1.1.3\u2002 Current account balance in developing Asia\n\n2.6\n\n3.0\n\n2.3\n\n1.9\n\n1.7\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n6\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\ndemand. Azerbaijan fell into recession with the decline in \ndomestic demand on top of the adverse impact of weaker \noil production and exports. Oil-dependent Kazakhstan and \nTurkmenistan also slowed, but less than in 2015 as declining \noil export earnings were countered by higher government \nspending in Kazakhstan and increased investment in \nTurkmenistan. In Tajikistan, growth improved by 0.9 \npercentage points thanks to timely and robust expansion \nin public investment, and despite lower remittances. Weak \nexports slowed growth marginally in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Uzbekistan. \n\n% of GDP\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nGrowth in South Asia eased to 6.7% in 2016 from \n7.2% in 2015 even as \ufb01ve of the eight economies posted \nhigher growth. The deceleration was largely attributed to \nIndia, where growth decelerated to 7.1% in 2016 from 7.9% in 2015 on \naccount of weak expansion in private investment, a halt to the slide in \ninternational oil prices, and the government\u2019s demonetization of high-\ndenomination banknotes in November 2016, which temporarily stymied \nmany transactions in this cash-intensive economy. Growth in Nepal also \nslowed, hurt by delayed reconstruction following an earthquake in April \n2015 and by trade and supply disruptions in early 2016. In Sri Lanka, \ngrowth moderated as adverse weather weakened agricultural production. \nSteady growth in the rest of the South Asian economies re\ufb02ected higher \nconsumption and investment and a rebound in high-end tourism. \n\nIn the Paci\ufb01c, aggregate growth in 2016 eased to just a third of \nthe subregion\u2019s remarkable 8.3% expansion in 2015 as growth slowed \nin the larger island economies. Low commodity prices and soft global \ndemand sharply weakened growth in the subregion\u2019s largest economy, \nPapua New Guinea. In Fiji, growth eased due to damage and losses from \nCyclone Winston, while in Timor-Leste growth improved as higher \ninfrastructure investment offset slack petroleum exports and revenues. \n\nIn contrast with slower growth elsewhere, aggregate growth \nin Southeast Asia improved slightly to 4.7% in 2016 from 4.6% in \n2015, even as growth slowed in 4 of the 10 economies and recession \ndeepened in Brunei Darussalam. This largely re\ufb02ected a higher \nweighting for Indonesia, where growth accelerated last year on higher \n\ufb01xed investment and consumption after slowing for 4 straight years. \nIn Malaysia, growth dipped for a second year in a row, weighed down \nby declining \ufb01xed investment, weaker government spending, and \nlower exports. In Thailand, growth improved marginally from last \nyear on higher consumption, aided by a tax rebate for shopping and \ndining, higher rural incomes, and recovery in net exports. Growth in \nViet Nam slowed as weaker agriculture and mining production offset \nrobust expansion in manufacturing and construction. Adverse weather \nhurt agricultural production in the Philippines and Viet Nam. In the \nPhilippines, though, huge improvements in public infrastructure kicked \nin, lifting growth to a rate on par with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic and behind only Cambodia.\n\nExternal demand slowed growth in several large economies. \n\nIn 7 of the 11 regional economies with data on contributions \nto growth, net exports trimmed growth in 2016 (Figure 1.1.4). \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u20027\n\n1.1.4\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, \n\nselected economies\n\nTotal consumption\nTotal investment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\n\nPercentage points \n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\nNIEs\n\nASEAN\n\nPRC IND HKG KOR SIN TAP INO MAL PHI THA VIE\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, HKG = Hong Kong, China, \nIND = India, INO = Indonesia, KOR = Republic of Korea, MAL = Malaysia, \nNIEs = newly industrialized economies, PHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, SIN = Singapore, TAP = Taipei,China, THA = Thailand, \nVIE = Viet Nam.\nSources: Haver Analytics; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 1 March 2017); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nConsumption remained the dominant source of expansion \nlast year, with over half of growth in most of these economies \nfueled mainly by private spending, even as consumer \ncon\ufb01dence was mostly bleak (Figure 1.1.5).\n\nConsumer con\ufb01dence started low in 2016 in most of the \nlarge economies examined but rose gradually in four of the \nseven in the second half of the year. In the PRC, consumer \ncon\ufb01dence was strong throughout 2016 and translated into \nhigher spending on a wide range of goods and services. \nIn Hong Kong, China, consumer con\ufb01dence \ufb02uctuated as \nmore cautious views took hold about the economic outlook, \njob prospects, and spending plans. After slipping in mid-2016 \nbecause of declines in tourist arrivals, particularly from the \nPRC, consumer con\ufb01dence in Hong Kong, China recovered in \nthe second half on better expectations about jobs and stock \nmarket movements.

In the ROK, \nconsumer sentiment fell to its lowest in more than 7.5 years in \nDecember, as residents anticipated a weaker economy because of the \ncrisis surrounding the President and resulting turbulent \ufb01nancial \nmarkets.

Retail sales in \nHong Kong, China dropped year on year during most of 2016, re\ufb02ecting \nlower tourist spending and, to some extent, volatility in equity markets. \nSpending in February, usually a better month because of the Lunar \nNew Year, was particularly weak in Hong Kong, China compared with \nother economies in East Asia. February retail sales were lower as well \nin the PRC than in the previous year, but sales held up well toward the \nend of the year. On average, consumption improved in line with rising \nconsumer sentiment for the medium term. The ROK and Taipei,China, \nby comparison, enjoyed higher sales during February and saw this trend \ncontinue to December.\n\nIn Thailand, retail sales recovered after contracting during most \n\nof 2015.

Industrial production \ufb02uctuated in the \nROK, rising toward the second quarter of 2016 and then falling in the \nthird with a slump in the production of automobiles and mobile devices, \nbut it remained generally positive. Lower car sales with the expiration \nof the government\u2019s excise tax cuts on passenger cars prompted car \nmanufacturers to cut production\u2014and strikes in some plants did the \nsame. Meanwhile, the worldwide production halt and massive recall of \na newly released Samsung phone caused output of mobile devices to fall. \nIndustrial production held steady in the PRC thanks largely to a strong \nhigh-tech industry. \n\nIn Southeast Asia, industrial production was volatile, except in \n\nViet Nam, where it fell steadily after February because of a steep decline \nin mining. Countering this decline were strong gains in processing and \nmanufacturing that lifted overall production by 16.5%, up from 12.3% \ngrowth in 2015. Recovery in the Philippines and Thailand followed a \ncontraction in 2015, while expansion in Singapore remained at 3.6% \nbecause of double-digit increases in electronic and pharmaceutical \noutput in the last 2 months of the year. After posting solid gains in \n2015, growth in Indonesian industrial production moderated to 4.0% in \n2016 as performance varied across subsectors and spending by goods \nproducers turned cautious. In Malaysia, production gains halved in 2016 \nfrom 4.5% in the previous year as mining output shrank and production \nfell for electrical and electronics products and for transport equipment.\nCautious spending by the private sector and uncertainty in both the \n\ndomestic and the external environment weakened investment in most \nof the larger economies. Gross investment declined in India, the ROK, \nMalaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in 2016. Investment expansion in \nIndonesia, the Philippines, Viet Nam, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, \nChina came mainly from increased private sector investment, spurred \n\n\f10\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nby higher outlays for industrial machinery and equipment, \nconstruction, and inventories in anticipation of higher \ndomestic activity later in the year (Figure 1.1.8).

Its high \ndependence on oil imports meant it bene\ufb01ted from a large \nimprovement in its terms of trade. Further, effective policy \nactions over the past year brought a new bankruptcy code, \nformalized an in\ufb02ation-targeting framework, enacted \nconstitutional changes to allow the implementation of a \ngoods and services tax, and gradually lifted fuel subsidies. \nFor the past 4 years or so, the economy has experienced a \ngradual cyclical recovery and is estimated to have grown \nby 7.1% in 2016. Favorable agricultural output aided by \nwell-timed monsoon rains also supported growth. Stronger \nconsumer demand even under gradual \ufb01scal consolidation helped boost \nconsumer sentiment. \n\nIndia decided in November 2016 to withdrawal from circulation, or \ndemonetize, Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes\u2014about 86% of the currency \nin circulation by value\u2014and replace them with new Rs500 and Rs2,000 \nnotes. The decision was designed to trip up corruption, counterfeiting, \nand the funding of terrorism in the near term while, over the medium \nterm, improving tax compliance and increasing the amount of savings \nchanneled through the formal \ufb01nancial system. This initiative caused \ntemporary disruption in sectors heavily dependent on cash. These \ndisruptions, along with a continued slowdown in private investment and \nstabilization in oil prices, decelerated GDP growth from 7.9% in 2015 \nto 7.1%. The economy is expected to fully recover from demonetization \nin 2017 and grow at 7.4%. Over the medium term, structural policies \nalready implemented should help maintain long-term GDP growth \nwell above 7.0%.\n\nInvestment was sluggish in much of 2016 as private investment \nwas weighed down by low capacity utilization and slow progress in \ndeleveraging. Demonetization may have temporarily stalled investment \nplans in some sectors. Nonetheless, net foreign direct investment in\ufb02ows \nin FY2016 rose by about 15%, re\ufb02ecting steps to augment investment by \nsimplifying guidelines and allowing foreign direct investment in sectors \nsuch as real estate, airport and air transport services, and e-commerce. \nBetter business conditions going forward should improve investment \nprospects in general. \n\nIndia\u2019s current account de\ufb01cit has declined sharply in recent \n\nyears with lower commodity prices, in particular for oil and \ngold, which together accounted for 27.3% of imports in 2016. \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200211\n\n1.1.9\u2002Production indicators\n\nIndustrial production, PRC\nIndustrial production, India\n\nElectricity generation, PRC\nElectricity generation, India\n\n% change, year on year \n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, Q = quarter.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (both accessed 13 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.1.10\u2002Merchandise exports and purchasing managers\u2019 index\n\nExports growth, PRC\nExports growth, India\n\nPurchasing managers\u2019 index, PRC\nPurchasing managers\u2019 index, India\n\n% change, year on year\n3-month moving average \n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNotes: For the purchasing managers\u2019 index, a value above 50 means expansion \nwhile below 50 is contraction. \nSources: Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company (both accessed 23 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nExternal vulnerabilities are in check, while international \nreserves provide an adequate buffer, standing at $360 billion \nin late December 2016 and providing 8 months of import \ncover. Nonetheless, as commodity prices rebound, import \ndemand strengthens, and foreign demand continues to \ndecline, especially from the Gulf, the de\ufb01cit is projected to \nexpand a bit in the next 2 years. The current account de\ufb01cit is \nexpected to be comfortably \ufb01nanced by stable capital in\ufb02ows. \nRebalancing in the PRC further moderated growth last \nyear, and expansion in 2017 will likely slow a bit more with \ncontinuing structural reform. Growth has been decelerating \nsteadily since 2010, slowing from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.7% as \nAsia\u2019s largest economy changes its development paradigm. \nOn the supply side, services remained the main growth \ndriver, with strong growth across many service industries. \nReal estate investment grew from a low base but was buoyed \nby the lowering of mortgage interest payments and down-\npayment requirements. The balance of payments weakened \nslightly in 2016 as exports of goods fell by 7.2% year on year, \nmore steeply than the 4.5% drop in 2015. As exports are \nmeasured in US dollars, some of this drop re\ufb02ects renminbi \nappreciation against the dollar in 2016. \n\nMore recent monthly data show industrial production \ngrowing steadily by 6% throughout 2016 as manufacturing \nexpanded on spillover from an invigorated real estate market, \na jump in car production, robust construction, and continued \nhigh electricity generation. \n\nIn India, industrial production shook off its malaise \nto expand in mid-2016, though industry expansion at 1% \nwas well below the 6% recorded in the PRC in the fourth \nquarter (Figure 1.1.9). Merchandise export growth in India \nturned positive toward the end of 2016, and the purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index turned positive for both the PRC and India \nin 2016, indicating renewed economic activity (Figure 1.1.10). \nThe two major economies together account for almost 70% of \nregional GDP. \n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\nJan\n2013\n\nGrowth is expected to remain strong in the near term in the \nPRC, helped by \ufb01scal stimulus from infrastructure spending, robust \ncredit growth, and strong real estate investment. However, slower \nprogress with reining in credit and reforming state enterprises is a \nrisk to medium-term growth. As the government is concerned about \nmaintaining stability in \ufb01nancial and labor markets, it will not push \nfor faster growth. Likewise, India\u2019s economy is expected to continue \nto record strong and broad growth, aided in part by favorable \nexternal demand. In both economies, momentum from strong growth \nin major export markets, the mild rebound of commodity prices, and \nrobust public investment in particular present upside risks to the \ngrowth forecast. \n\n\f1.1.11\u2002 Consumer and producer prices, 2016\n\n12\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nIn\ufb02ation inches back up\nIn\ufb02ation was generally higher in 2016 than in 2015. However, \nmany of the factors that kept in\ufb02ation low in 2016, notably \nlackluster demand in the region and falling international \nprices for oil and other commodities, reversed in the second \nhalf of the year. The highest in\ufb02ation rates occurred in \nCentral Asia, particularly in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, \nwhere producer prices shot up in 2016 as a lagged result of \ncurrency depreciation by roughly half in 2015 and, toward \nthe end of the year, as recovery in demand stabilized oil and \nfood prices. Elsewhere, especially in Southeast Asia and in \nsome newly industrialized economies, notably the ROK and \nTaipei,China, \ufb01scal stimulus is helping to revive domestic \ndemand. However, in\ufb02ation is expected to remain generally \nlow in East Asia and, to a lesser extent, in Southeast Asia. \nWith in\ufb02ation in single digits throughout these subregions \nin 2017, consumer and business expectations are for stable \nin\ufb02ation. \n\nProducer price indexes have been low to negative in some \n\neconomies (Figure 1.1.11). However, monthly data suggest \nthat producer price in\ufb02ation, having lagged the consumer \nprice index, began to creep up toward the end of 2016.\n\nSubstantial differences in in\ufb02ation remain across the \nsubregions. In\ufb02ation is still lowest in East Asia, in line with \nsubstantial moderation in growth over the past few years \n(Figure 1.1.12). In\ufb02ation rose in most subregions in 2016, the \nexceptions being Southeast Asia, where it slowed from 2.8% \nin 2015 to 2.1% mainly because in\ufb02ation halved in Indonesia, \nand South Asia, where a very small decline largely re\ufb02ected \nlower in\ufb02ation in India. In South Asia and the Paci\ufb01c, \nin\ufb02ation was broadly steady below 5%.

In Central Asia, a steep drop in imports \nresulted from slower growth and the lagged impact of \nlarge currency devaluation in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. \nImports in East Asia also fell, mostly in the PRC, but less \nso than in 2015. In the other subregions, import growth \nresumed on recovering domestic demand after fairly steep \ndeclines in 2015 that partly re\ufb02ected falling US dollar costs \nfor commodity imports. The forecast for 2017 and 2018 is for \nimport growth to accelerate as expansion in major trading \npartners outside of Asia remains steady and commodity \nprices inch up. Nonetheless, as discussed in more detail \nbelow in the section on risks, substantial uncertainty bedevils \nthis forecast. That said, because many of the risk scenarios \nstem from possible policy changes in the European Union, \nPRC, and US, their impact is likely to be muted in 2017 but \npossibly affect trade \ufb02ows in 2018.\n\nThe region\u2019s current account surplus narrowed to 2.3% in \n\n2016, with East and Southeast Asia still showing signi\ufb01cant \nsurpluses (Figure 1.1.17). A narrower surplus for the PRC \nin 2017 and a slightly wider de\ufb01cit in South Asia as imports \nto India rise will likely trim the region\u2019s surplus to the \nequivalent of 1.9% of GDP. \n\nAsia and the Paci\ufb01c continue to have a current account \n\nsurplus vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world (Figure 1.1.18). In \nparticular, the combined surpluses of the PRC and Japan \nroughly match the US de\ufb01cit, with the rest of the world \nshowing a combined surplus equal to 0.36% of world GDP in \n2016. The surplus in developing Asia is expected to narrow \nsomewhat, from 0.7% of global GDP in 2016 to less than 0.5% \nin 2017 and 2018. This will re\ufb02ect lower net exports for the \nPRC as it progressively replaces outward-oriented growth \nwith growth led by domestic consumption.

Higher exports will \nhelp the newly industrialized economies, which have grown \nmore slowly than the rest of developing Asia because of their \nadvanced stage of development (Box 1.1.2). Economies in the \nregion can attain higher growth trajectories in the future \nthrough continued structural reform to boost productivity, \nsupport for domestic demand, and, particularly in South Asia, \na better investment climate.\n\nEast Asian growth is expected to slow to 5.8% in 2017 \nand further to 5.6% in 2018, mirroring growth moderation in \nthe PRC. The PRC is likely to grow by 6.5% in 2017 and 6.2% \nin 2018. Recent monthly data show infrastructure and real \nestate investment still strong.

However, \nstructural reform to help ease growth in corporate and household debt \ncan help offset these pressures, as discussed below. Despite continued \nmonetary and \ufb01scal support, growth in 2018 is expected to moderate \nto 6.2%.\n\nSouth Asia\u2019s expansion is forecast at 7.0% in 2017 with \nfaster recovery expected in India, and growth is forecast \nto rise further to 7.2% in 2018 as expansion in the rest of \nthe region also accelerates. In India, government reform \nand ongoing deleveraging by private corporations will \nsupport recovery in investment, and the slight rise in \ngrowth prospects for the advanced economies will boost \nexports this year and next. Growth in 2018 is expected to \naccelerate slightly to 7.6%.

Growth is expected to rise in particular in \nSingapore and Taipei,China as government investment in \ninfrastructure and higher growth in manufacturing and \nelectronics boosts these economies. However, growth in \nHong Kong, China will be a modest 2.0% in 2017 as services \nare not expected to recover quickly and the economy is \nvery susceptible to changes in monetary policy and the \nvalue of the US dollar\u2014and, for that matter, to any \ufb01nancial \ndevelopments in the US. In the ROK, the political uncertainty \nthat suppressed domestic demand in 2016 is expected to \ndispel somewhat by mid-2017, and export-led growth should \nresume in 2018.\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\nRegional in\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate from 2.5% \nlast year to 3.0% this year and 3.2% in 2018 because of rising \nglobal commodity prices and consumer demand. In the PRC, \nstrong credit and household income growth will, along with \nthe \ufb01scal stimulus from infrastructure spending, underpin \ngrowth in domestic demand. In\ufb02ation in the PRC will thus \naccelerate at a similar pace, from 2.0% last year to 2.4% \nthis year and 2.8% in 2018.

A few commodity \nexporters in Central Asia will continue to experience \nin\ufb02ation approaching 10% as the effects of earlier currency depreciation \npass through from imports to consumer prices.

Markets \nhave already factored in this apparent inevitability, and the \nbaseline forecast assumes a modest rise in interest rates. \n\nThe forecast faces four main risks that could undermine \n\ndeveloping Asia\u2019s growth trajectory, but the region as a \nwhole can easily manage them over the short term. The \n\ufb01rst involves monetary tightening in the US and an ensuing \nresponse from Asian central banks to avoid capital out\ufb02ows. \nThe second risk is that abrupt changes in \ufb01nancial \ufb02ows \ncould imperil highly indebted corporations and households. \nThe impact of higher interest rates in the US on the region\u2019s \neconomies, and on rapidly rising household debt, are \nanalyzed in the following section. The third risk is sudden \nshifts in trade and tax policies in the major industrial \neconomies. The \ufb01nal risk\u2014a less likely one\u2014is oil price \nrecovery that is weaker than expected. \n\nThe \ufb01rst risk to the forecast comes from higher-than-\n\nexpected real interest rates in the US and further slight appreciation of \nthe dollar against many Asian currencies. This could cause asset prices \nto plunge and private capital to \ufb02ow out of emerging Asia in search \nof higher returns elsewhere. A sudden shift would be destabilizing \nand possibly erode consumer con\ufb01dence. If, on the other hand, rate \nchanges come gradually, central banks in the region will have sufficient \ntime to respond by tightening monetary policy without undermining \nbalanced growth.\n\nA second risk, related to the \ufb01rst, comes from \nunexpectedly sharp interest rate hikes in the US and \nEurope, which could affect highly leveraged corporations \nand governments in the region. Such corporations in large \neconomies are vulnerable to sudden shifts in asset prices \nthat could undermine their ability to service debt. Moreover, \neconomies in the region with growing household debt \nmay see households spend less in response to higher debt \nservicing obligations, undermining heretofore strong growth \nin consumer demand. \n\n0\n\nA third uncertainty comes from possible shifts in US tax \nand trade policy. The new administration withdrew from the \nTrans-Paci\ufb01c Partnership, has called for the renegotiation of \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, and has raised \nthe possibility of stiff tariff increases. If stiff taxes and tariffs \nare implemented, however, they would likely take effect in \nmid-2018 at the earliest. The immediate risk is that rising \nrhetoric could encourage beggar-thy-neighbor tendencies \noutside of developing Asia that squelch international trade \nto the bene\ufb01t of large domestic conglomerates, particularly \nin South and Southeast Asia. No one can say how great the impact will \nbe or where it will be felt, especially as most manufactures and traded \nservices are produced by global value chains present in different parts of \nthe world. Thus, policy-induced volatility may be spread around enough \nto have only limited impact on any particular economy, but trade would \nlikely decline overall if the risk materializes. \n\n\f18\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nThe \ufb01nal risk involves oil prices. The baseline assumptions \n\ncall for a mild and steady rise in the price of Brent crude oil, averaging \n$56/barrel in 2017 and $58/barrel in 2018. However, anticipated \nderegulation of supply in the US\u2014including the opening of the \nKeystone pipeline, which will allow the fast delivery of Canadian \ncrude to oil re\ufb01neries along the Gulf Coast for export to Latin America, \nmay increase global output enough to undo the supply cutback \nagreed in late-2016 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries. Developing Asia as a whole is a net importer of oil and \nother commodities, so low oil prices would help keep oil import bills in \ncheck, which is of particular importance to India, the Philippines, and \nthe NIEs. On the other hand, continued low prices would delay fragile \nrecovery in oil and gas exporters in Central Asia and the Paci\ufb01c.\n\nThe following pages address the \ufb01rst two risks, those connected \nwith monetary policy, and develop detailed scenarios for developing Asia \nif they were to materialize. Sharply higher US interest rates would likely \naffect the region through two channels. The \ufb01rst would be spillover \naffecting exchange rates, which would play out in different ways across \nAsia depending on the exchange rate regime. Economies with more \n\ufb02exible exchange rates would likely become more competitive at the \nexpense of their less \ufb02exible competitors, but probably at the cost of \nunwelcome in\ufb02ation. The second channel would be abrupt capital \nout\ufb02ows from the region in search of higher returns. This could \ndestabilize \ufb01nancial sectors in some regional economies, particularly \nthose with high corporate and consumer debt, but central banks would \nlikely be able to respond promptly and effectively. \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200219\n\n1.2.1\u2002 Range of Fed interest rate projections, \nMarch 2016 versus March 2017\n\nMinimum\nMedian\nMaximum\n\nMarch 2016\n\nMarch 2017\n\nMarch 2016\n\nMarch 2017\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSources: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \nFederal Open Market Committee. March 2016 and March 2017.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nRisk of sharper  \nUS interest rate hikes\n\nBefore the March 2017 increase in the Fed funds rate, the \nUS Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark policy interest \nrate only twice since it set the rate at its historic low in \nOctober 2008. The \ufb01rst hike was in December 2015 and the \nsecond in December 2016. On all three occasions, the Fed \nfunds rate was raised by only 25 basis points, which still \nleaves it ultralow, perpetuating accommodative monetary \npolicy. The question remains: How fast will the Fed raise \ninterest rates going forward? The opinion of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee is \ufb02uid. It projected in March last year \nmuch faster interest rate increases for 2017 and 2018 than it \ndid in March this year (Figure 1.2.1). If, however, emerging \neconomic conditions warrant a trajectory of steep policy \nrate rises\u2014one more like the March 2016 projection than \nthe March 2017 projection\u2014the effects will ripple across the \nglobal economy and affect the outlook for developing Asia.\n\n%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHow fast will the Fed normalize rates?\nThe most recent Fed funds rate increase did little to quell a debate \nabout whether the Fed is behind the curve in its monetary policy. \nSome analysts argue that recent trends, bringing higher in\ufb02ation \nand lower unemployment as the economy recovers, leave the current \ninterest rate too low if one considers lessons learned in an in\ufb02ation \nsurge in the mid-1960s. Others agree that Fed\u2019s current policy is behind \nthe curve but base their assessment on the Taylor Rule. Introduced \nin Taylor (1993), it describes a likely policy rate given the deviation of \nin\ufb02ation from its target, the neutral interest rate (the equilibrium real \ninterest rate when the economy is operating at its potential), and the \ndeviation of output from its potential or trend.\n\nFed policy makers have repeatedly countered that their monetary \n\npolicy is responsive to data. Some observers agree. In an historical \nanalysis of error in forecasts of the Fed funds rate, Nechio and \nRudebusch (2016) argued that the rates set by the Fed in 2016 were not \nunusually low relative to what was projected at the end of 2015. That is, \nthe distance between the policy rate and its higher projection appears \nto be consistent with what the Fed has done historically in response \nto evolving economic data. It also argued that the neutral interest \nrate is currently lower than what it was in Taylor (1993). Therefore, it \nconcludes, with appropriate adjustments to the interest rate policy rule, \nthe Fed does not seem to be behind the curve.\n\nWhile the debate on this issue is inconclusive, a look at how the \n\nFed policy rate has related to in\ufb02ation in the recent past provides \nvaluable insights about the likely future trend for the Fed funds rate. \n\n\f1.2.2\u2002Interest rate and inflation, United States\n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation\nInterest rate\nInterest rate in the ADO 2017 baseline\n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012\n\n2014 2016\n\n2018\n\nSources: Haver Analytics (accessed 24 March 2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n20\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nFollowing the burst of the dot-com bubble in early 2001, \nthe Fed slashed its benchmark interest rate repeatedly to \nstimulate the economy. The Fed funds rate fell from 6.5% in \nDecember 2000 to a low of 1.0% in June 2003 (Figure 1.2.2). \nAs in\ufb02ationary pressures returned in mid-2004, the Fed \nactively lifted its benchmark policy interest rate. Within \n2 years, the Fed funds rate was raised by 425 basis points. \nThis period of low interest rates had passed, but not before it \ncontributed to the housing bubble that eventually triggered \nthe global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. \n\nIn response to the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nthe Fed again aggressively brought down its benchmark \ninterest rate to an historic low approaching zero percent and \nthen kept it there until the end of 2015. During this episode, \ninternational oil prices reached more than $100/barrel and \ncaused headline in\ufb02ation in the US to shoot up. In\ufb02ation was \nseen as externally driven, however, at a time of benign domestic price \npressures. It therefore did not trigger a policy reaction from the Fed. \nWhen international oil prices fell in 2015, headline in\ufb02ation in the US \nfollowed suit. \n\nAlthough oil prices have not climbed back up to anywhere near \ntheir peak in 2011\u20132014, US in\ufb02ation has recently been back on the rise, \nsuggesting that domestic factors have a role in pushing up aggregate \nprices. Under these circumstances, the Fed can be expected to start \nraising its benchmark rate, but the speed at which US interest rates will \nrise remains an open question. The Asian Development Outlook 2017 \n(ADO 2017) baseline assumptions have the Fed funds rate increasing \nonly gradually to the forecast horizon (Figure 1.2.2). A much faster \nincrease in interest rates is possible, however, especially if concerns of \na repeat \ufb01nancial crisis come to the fore. If this were to happen, what \nwould the global implications be? \n\nModeling spillover from US monetary policy\nThe following pages consider two alternative scenarios to the ADO 2017 \nbaseline with faster US interest rate hikes. The analysis examines each \nscenario\u2019s \ufb01rst-round effects, should they materialize, on economies \nother than the US. The two alternative simulations are conducted using \nthe Global Projection Model appropriately calibrated to accommodate \nADO 2017 baseline assumptions (Box 1.2.1). Discussion begins with \nthe scenario of interest rate increases accelerating independently, then \nfollows up with a scenario in which acceleration is induced by a large \nincrease in aggregate demand in the US. The analysis suggests that \nneither scenario is likely to materialize.\n\nFaster hikes in US interest rates\nTo model US interest rate hikes occurring much faster than expected, \nthe assumptions mirror the period observed prior to the global \ufb01nancial \ncrisis of 2008\u20132009, which saw interest rates raised by 425 basis points \nover 2 years.

GPM7 focuses \non a few variables that interest policy makers the most: \noutput, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, and global \ncommodity prices.\n\nEach region is described by four behavioral equations \n\nfamiliar and interpretable to policy makers: an output \ngap equation that measures the difference between actual \nand potential GDP, a Philips curve that shows the inverse \nrelationship between the unemployment rate and the \ninflation rate, a Taylor rule that stipulates how much a \nmonetary authority should change the nominal interest \nrate in response to changes in inflation and output, and an \nuncovered interest parity condition with risk premiums, \nwhich links real interest rates with real exchange rates. \nFor the advanced economies\u2014the European Union, \nJapan, and the US\u2014the model also incorporates linkages \nbetween finance and the real economy by including relevant \nindicators of bank lending tightness. These linkages can \nproxy for global financial shocks as they can be correlated \n\nacross regions and have spillover beyond the advanced \neconomies. The PRC is modeled somewhat differently from \nother regions as interest rate and exchange rate responses \nhave historically been more persistent than in other \neconomies. \n\nGPM7 is often described as a \u201cgap model\u201d because it \nuses deviations from equilibrium values\u2014potential output, \nthe nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, the \nequilibrium real interest rate, and the equilibrium real \nexchange rate\u2014in the behavioral equations mentioned \nabove. Equilibrium values are unobserved and specified as \nstochastic processes, with lead\u2013lag structures and stochastic \nshocks to both levels and growth rates. Finally, GPM7 \nincludes world commodity prices for oil, food, and metals, \nwhich are functions of the world output gap and affect \ninflation and output across regions.\n\na  GPM7 was developed and is maintained by the International \nMonetary Fund and Centre pour la Recherche \u00c9conomique \net ses Applications with support from a network of members \nin many countries. The approach used in GPM7, which is \ndescribed in detail in Blagrave et al. (2013), attempts to strike \na balance between fully micro-founded dynamic stochastic \ngeneral equilibrium models, which are theoretically sound \nbut only at the cost of empirical accuracy, and time-series \nmodels, which are empirically accurate but only at the cost of \ntheoretical consistency.\n\nSource: Blagrave P., P.

Much more rapid interest rate \nincreases in the US would squeeze liquidity in the domestic \nmarket and bring down in\ufb02ation within the forecast horizon. \nThe combination of higher interest rates and lower domestic \nin\ufb02ation would cause the US dollar to appreciate against \nother currencies as demand for the currency grows.\n\nThis faster pace of US interest rate hikes would be costly \n\n%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nfor the US. The model indicates that, relative to the ADO 2017 \nbaseline projection, GDP growth would be suppressed by \n0.2 percentage points in 2017 and slashed by 0.6 percentage \npoints in 2018. Such deductions from growth would risk \nwidening the output gap and hurting economic recovery, \nwhich would contradict the Fed policy of sustaining healthy \neconomic growth. Consequently, a faster hike in US interest rates is \nunlikely, occupying on the risk curve a distant point at the tail end. \n\n1.2.3\u2002 US interest rates, baseline assumption versus \n\nfaster hike scenario\n\nFaster interest rate hike shock\nInterest rate in the ADO 2017 baseline\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: ADB estimates. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f22\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n1.2.1\u2002 Effects of faster US interest rate hikes  \n\n(deviations from the baseline, percentage points)\n\nUnited States\n\nEuro area\n\nJapan\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nEmerging Asia\n\nGDP\n\nInflation\n\n2017\n\n\u20130.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n2018\n\n\u20130.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n0.1\n\n2017\n\n\u20130.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n2018\n\n\u20130.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\nNote: Emerging Asia includes India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nThailand, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, China. \nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; ADB estimates.\n\nAssuming this tail-end risk nevertheless materializes, the euro area \nand Japan would not be substantially affected, as they would maintain \ntheir easy monetary policy to keep stimulating growth in their own \neconomies. GDP growth and in\ufb02ation would not deviate much from what \nthe baseline suggests (Table 1.2.1). Interest rate differentials would likely \ninduce capital \ufb02ight, causing the euro and the yen to depreciate against \nthe US dollar. This would eventually improve real effective exchange \nrates in the euro area and Japan and thus their price competitiveness \nagainst the US and other economies with less responsive exchange rates.\nThe likely implications for emerging Asia are slightly different. \nEconomies that manage their currencies to maintain a stable exchange \nrate vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar, like the PRC for example, would tend to \nexperience less currency depreciation than those that historically have \nexperienced more volatile currency movements. While dampening \nexcessive currency volatility helps manage country risks, these \neconomies would tend to lose out in terms of price competitiveness and \nhave to sacri\ufb01ce part of their global market share to economies with \nmore exposed currencies. \n\nMost economies in emerging Asia have \ufb02exible exchange rates. \nConsequently, they would tend to be among those that bene\ufb01t from \nimproved real effective exchange rates. However, this bene\ufb01t comes \nwith a cost. As most economies in emerging Asia already operate at or \nnear their potential, in\ufb02ation would shoot up rapidly in line with a faster \nrate of currency depreciation. This might imperil domestic economic \nstability, requiring the authorities to tighten domestic liquidity.\n\nInterest rate hikes induced by aggregate demand\nA somewhat more likely scenario is that faster US interest rate \nincreases occur in response to a surge in aggregate demand. \nThe new US administration intends to raise the annual growth \nrate to 3.5%\u20134.0%. To assess the implications of such a boost to the \neconomy, the analysis assumes faster growth in the US starting in the \nthird quarter of 2017 that lifts GDP growth by almost 0.2 percentage \npoints above the baseline for that year and brings the growth rate to \n3.5% in 2018, or 1.1 percentage points above the baseline projection \n(Figure 1.2.4). \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200223\n\nAn aggregate demand shock raises in\ufb02ation by about \n0.4 percentage points in 2018 above the baseline (the blue bar \nin Figure 1.2.4b). To fend off such in\ufb02ationary pressure, the \nFed is assumed to raise interest rates at the same rate as the \nindependent interest rate shock discussed above. This move \nfrom the Fed mitigates the in\ufb02ationary effect of the aggregate \ndemand shock but at the cost of slower growth (the orange \nbars in Figure 1.2.4a). After the Fed\u2019s response, US growth in \n2018 will be up by only about 0.5 percentage points from the \nbaseline, but with in\ufb02ation relatively unaffected. \n\nThe aggregate demand shock in the US would tend to \n\nstrengthen the US dollar further. Absent any worsening \nof trade friction globally, this should bene\ufb01t US trade \npartners and stimulate growth elsewhere, including in Asia. \nThis effect could be accompanied by intensi\ufb01ed in\ufb02ationary \npressure in economies whose currencies depreciate. \nThe global implications of the Fed\u2019s faster interest rate \nincreases in response to domestic demand pressures in the \nUS are similar to the effects discussed above in the section \nFaster Hikes in US Interest Rates. In short, the bene\ufb01t of \nincreased aggregate demand accompanied by faster monetary \ntightening in the US would be shared unevenly by trading \npartners depending on how rigid their exchange rates were, \nand the in\ufb02ationary cost of resulting currency movements \nwould tend to be greater in economies that already operated \nat or near their potential.\n\nA catch is that a surge in aggregate demand in the \nUS would not necessarily follow from a public spending \nbinge there, which itself is less than likely given the slow \npace of the budgetary approval process, particularly when \nconsidering appropriations large enough to deliver a surge in \naggregate demand of the magnitude envisaged here.\n\n1.2.4\u2002 Effects of US aggregate demand boost\n\nUS growth increase effect\nUS interest rate increase effect\nTotal effect\n\na.

As the open economies became \nmore price competitive in trade, the managed economies would sacri\ufb01ce \nglobal market share.\n\nSuch an outcome would call for policy responses in economies \noutside the US. The responses would complicate economic relations \nglobally, but these second-round effects are beyond the scope of this \nanalysis. An obvious possible response would be intervention to adjust \nthe exchange rate to maintain price competitiveness. This is consistent \nwith Benigno et al. (2016), for example, which argues that an exchange \nrate policy that has no cost in terms of efficiency may be the best \noption. However, this analysis also shows that policy intended to limit \nthe unwanted implications of currency depreciation may be required \nwhen exchange rate policy does entail efficiency costs such as a surge \n\n\f24\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nin in\ufb02ation. The in\ufb02ationary impact of such policies, for example, may \nthen be addressed through appropriate adjustments to monetary and \n\ufb01scal policies.\n\nFaster interest rate hikes in the US could further drain foreign \ninvestment from emerging Asia but to varying degrees in individual \neconomies. As international capital \ufb02ows are typically sensitive to the \nUS dollar exchange rate, different rates of currency depreciation may \nin\ufb02uence the volume and destinations of capital \ufb02ows. A multitude of \nfactors may enter into an explanation for this trend, but investment \nmovements are essentially driven by changes in expected returns, \nwhich depend fundamentally on expected movements in interest and \nexchange rates.\n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200225\n\nCapital flows and financial risks\n\nThe normalization of US monetary policy discussed in the \npreceding section raises the prospect of capital out\ufb02ows from \ndeveloping Asia. If Asian central banks follow suit and raise \ntheir own interest rates, highly leveraged households could \nbe compromised, posing a risk to \ufb01nancial stability. However, \nthe risks from capital \ufb02ows and household debt appear to \nbe manageable in the short term, and continued vigilance \nby policy makers promises to further strengthen \ufb01nancial \nstability and resilience.\n\nRegion facing capital out\ufb02ows \nHigher US interest rates may pose risks to \ufb01nancial stability \nin emerging Asia. Along with better US economic prospects, \nhigher interest rates and a consequently strong US dollar may \ntilt global investor sentiment such that capital \ufb02ows out of \nAsian markets, exerting downward pressure on asset prices \nin emerging Asia. Because international capital \ufb02ows are \nsensitive to the US dollar exchange rate, emerging Asia has in \nthe past experienced net capital in\ufb02ows when the dollar was \nweak and, this time since the second half of 2014, out\ufb02ows \nwhen the dollar strengthened (Figure 1.3.1a). Additional \ninterest rate hikes in the US could further drain foreign \ninvestment from emerging Asia.\n\nNet capital \ufb02ows to large economies in emerging \nAsia\u2014the PRC, India, Indonesia, the ROK, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam, Taipei,China, \nand Hong Kong, China\u2014have declined since the second \nquarter of 2014. While net \ufb02ows of foreign direct investment \n(FDI) into the region held up initially, they too started to \nreverse and \ufb02ow out of the region beginning in the second \nhalf of 2015. This last episode of capital out\ufb02ow has notably \naffected the PRC but not every other economy in emerging \nAsia, some of which were still receiving positive net \ufb02ows of \nFDI in the third quarter of 2016. \n\nCapital began \ufb02owing out of the PRC in the second \nquarter of 2014 in the amount of $35 billion that quarter. \nOut\ufb02ows picked up the pace to exceed $130 billion in the \nthird quarter of 2016 (Figure 1.3.1b). Most of these out\ufb02ows \ninvolved banking activities (the \u201cother investments\u201d \ncategory) and portfolio investment. Since the second half of \n2015, they have included net out\ufb02ows of FDI. In the rest of \nemerging Asia, net portfolio out\ufb02ows amounted to \n$38 billion in the third quarter of 2016.

Despite the broad negative trend in net \ufb02ows, \nsome variation has occurred in emerging Asia. India, Indonesia, and \nSingapore received net capital in\ufb02ows after recovering in the fourth \nquarter of 2013 from investors\u2019 response to the Federal Reserve \nannouncement that it was tapering purchases of government and \nmortgage-backed securities. Viet Nam has received net in\ufb02ows as well \nsince the fourth quarter of 2015. India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam are still \nbene\ufb01ting from net \ufb02ows of FDI into their economies. \n\nNet capital out\ufb02ows from economies in emerging Asia are expected \n\nto continue this year and next. The Asia Bond Monitor (ADB 2017) \nidenti\ufb01es three potential risks to Asia\u2019s \ufb01nancial stability. First, a \npickup in the global economy, particularly in the US, and uncertainty \nsurrounding the global economic landscape will become a key theme \nfor investors in 2017. Second, policy and political uncertainty in the \nUS and the euro area may in\ufb02uence the global economic outlook and \nbecome a key risk to \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia. Third, although \nunlikely, a sharp depreciation of the PRC renminbi would pose a risk to \neconomies and \ufb01nancial markets elsewhere in emerging East Asia.\nHigher US interest rates may exert further downward pressure \non local currencies. Although many regional authorities are adopting \na wait-and-see approach and keeping their monetary policy stable, \nworsening depreciation pressures may push central banks to tighten \ntheir domestic monetary stance. Because many emerging Asian \neconomies have accumulated substantial foreign and local currency debt \nin the low-interest-rate environment prevailing since the global \ufb01nancial \ncrisis, the possible tightening of monetary policy could undermine their \n\ufb01nancial stability. Higher domestic interest rates may also add pressure \non highly leveraged households in Asia (see below). Nevertheless, solid \neconomic prospects and sufficient international reserves should cushion \nthe impact of possible shocks. \n\nEmerging Asia faces uncertainty concerning the domestic monetary \n\nstance of many economies that have lowered policy rates over the past \n2 years to support investment and growth. Tighter monetary policy in \nthe US may affect these economies, especially those with open capital \naccounts and \ufb02exible exchange rate regimes. If currency depreciation \naccelerates, central banks may want to follow the Fed in tightening \npolicy. Policy rates in emerging Asia have historically been strongly \ncorrelated as common external shocks elicited parallel responses, \nand now with growing regional integration. Rising interest rates may \nadversely affect liquidity across the region. At the same time, the \nauthorities in emerging Asia may want to delay monetary tightening to \nmaintain growth momentum. Although emerging Asia faces risks from \nan uncertain liquidity environment, they appear to be manageable in the \nshort term. Moreover, differences in monetary policy among the major \nindustrial economies suggest that the era of easy global liquidity may \nnot yet be over. \n\nConcerns over political and policy uncertainty in the US and the \neuro area have in\ufb02uenced the global economic outlook, creating risks \nfor \ufb01nancial markets in emerging Asia. The new US administration \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200227\n\nhas mooted possible radical changes to tax and trade policies, raising \nquestions about US commitment to the open movement of goods and \ncapital. The United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty \non 29 March 2017, but this did nothing to clarify the timing or outcome \nof Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European \nUnion. The euro area still faces major unresolved problems such as \nGreek sovereign debt and fragile banks in Italy. These concerns add to \nthe vulnerability of recovery in the euro area. Despite global recovery, \nprices for safe-haven assets such as gold remain robust, re\ufb02ecting \ninvestor concern about political risks and the sustainability of economic \nrecovery in the advanced economies. Asian \ufb01nancial markets may adjust \nfurther, pricing in these risks, which would exacerbate volatility.\n\nA weaker renminbi might curb exports from emerging East Asia to \nthe PRC, the region\u2019s largest trader, and intensify competition for export \nmarkets in the US and other economies. In the unlikely case of rapid \nrenminbi depreciation, capital out\ufb02ow from the PRC could undermine \nasset prices there and the balance sheets of \ufb01nancial institutions, \nchallenging highly leveraged investors in the PRC. Any negative investor \nsentiment that results could spill over into other markets in emerging \nAsia, further driving capital out of the region.\n\nRisks from highly leveraged households in Asia\nAbundant global and local liquidity since 2008 has boosted commercial \nand household borrowing in developing Asia, more so than in other \nemerging regions. Macroeconomic vulnerability has worsened in some \neconomies as a result, causing capital \ufb02ow reversals and \ufb01nancial market \nvolatility. The Fed\u2019s tightening cycle has intensi\ufb01ed \ufb01scal and \ufb01nancial \nrisk in the region, particularly in economies with highly leveraged \nprivate sectors. This requires close attention from policy makers. \n\nBesides commercial debt (discussed at length in ADO 2016 Update), \n\ngrowing household debt has been a primary cause of rising leverage \nin the region. Fueled by the global availability of relatively cheap and \nabundant credit, consumer debt has surged in many Asian economies \ntoward purchases of property, cars, and motorcycles, as well as many \nother consumer goods \ufb01nanced without collateral. Mortgage loans \ncomprise the bulk of household debt in Asia.\n\nOf some concern has been the speed with which household leverage \n\nhas spiked in recent years. In the ROK, the ratio of household debt \nto GDP rose from 74% in late 2008 to nearly 91% in the third quarter \nof 2016. Thailand\u2019s household debt ratio jumped by 26 percentage \npoints in the same period, and Malaysia\u2019s by 21 points, both reaching \nabout 71%. In addition, the PRC, Singapore, and Hong Kong, China saw \nhousehold debt increase substantially. In other economies where data \nare available, including India and Indonesia, debt ratios grew less and \nremain low (Figure 1.3.2). \n\nIn Malaysia, sustained economic growth in recent years has \nboosted household incomes and consumer con\ufb01dence, encouraging \ndebt acquisition. Buoyant credit demand has come from a relatively \nyoung workforce and the in\ufb02ux of a more affluent population in urban \nareas, as home purchases continue to account for the largest portion \n\n\f28\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nof household debt. Government policies instituting \ufb01scal \nincentives for homebuyers, streamlined and reduced duties \non cars, and a government-sponsored property lender have \nfurther spurred demand for household credit. \n\nThailand\u2019s debt levels also re\ufb02ect the impact of quasi-\n\ufb01scal measures. Following \ufb02oods in 2011, the government \nintroduced a program for \ufb01rst car buyers in 2012 to support \nthe hard-hit auto industry, raising demand for auto loans \n(IMF 2016). The program has since expired, but its impact \non household debt lingers. Households have relied on credit \ncards to smooth consumption, further raising their debt. \nA survey conducted in September 2016 con\ufb01rmed that \nrecent increases in average household debt resulted mainly \nfrom purchases of vehicles and other consumer products, \noften using credit cards (University of the Thai Chamber of \nCommerce 2016). \n\n1.3.2\u2002 Household debt\n\nEnd of 2008\nThird quarter of 2016\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nHousehold leverage in some Asian economies has reached \n\nhigh levels seen in mature economies, which sets the region \napart from the rest of the developing world, where households are \ngenerally less indebted. By itself, household debt is unlikely to trigger \n\ufb01nancial crises in the region, at least not if unemployment stays low, \nasset prices remain fairly stable (Figure 1.3.3), and banks continue to be \npro\ufb01table and well capitalized (Figure 1.3.4). None of these parameters \ncurrently poses a problem for highly leveraged economies in the region. \nIn Malaysia, for example, households\u2019 capacity to service debt has \nbeen supported by stable domestic employment and a favorable income \noutlook. Heightened market volatility has caused a small decline in the \nvalue of household equity investments, but the aggregate household \nbalance sheet remains healthy, with household \ufb01nancial assets valued \nat double their debt in the past 5 years. Further, stress tests \nsuggest that potential bank losses are limited in Malaysia and \neasily covered by banks\u2019 capital buffers. \n\nRatios of nonperforming mortgage loans have remained \n\nlow in the region. This is true even in Thailand, where \ndelinquencies have increased in recent years, mostly \ninvolving younger people (Figure 1.3.5). The balance sheets \nof Thai commercial banks remain healthy, though other \nspecialized \ufb01nancial institutions are more exposed to lower-\nincome households.

Although delinquency ratios \nremain low, at 0.5% for bank loans and 2.7% for nonbank \nloans, the pressure on households and the \ufb01nancial system is \nrising fast. The June 2016 Financial Stability Report from the \nBank of Korea, the central bank, shows that nearly a third of \nhousehold debt is held by households in distress, whose net \n\ufb01nancial assets are less than zero and who spend at least 40% \nof their disposable income on debt servicing. With 62% of \nmortgages at \ufb02oating rates and another 30% with adjustable \nrates that shift to \ufb02oating rates a certain point, the sector \nis highly vulnerable to a sharp hike in interest rates, \nparticularly if combined with a growth slowdown and rising \nunemployment that would complicate central bank intervention. \nTo stem the risks from raising interest rates, the government \n\nhas raised the target share of \ufb01xed-interest loans in \nbank portfolios; borrowers are encouraged to use them \nto re\ufb01nance their adjustable-rate loans. In August 2016, \nit further tightened banks\u2019 loan-screening requirements \nand lending by mutual \ufb01nance institutions. This followed \na more comprehensive package to manage household \ndebt implemented the year before that sought to improve \nhousehold loan quality, sharpen the assessment of borrowers\u2019 \nrepayment ability, and strengthen banks\u2019 ability to respond to \nshocks and absorb losses. \n\nOther policy makers in the region have been monitoring \nrising household debt for the past several years and enacting \nmacroprudential policies to strengthen household and bank \n\ufb01nancial health. For example, Bank Negara Malaysia recently \ntightened limits on loan-to-deposit ratios and unsecured \nlending. It also required domestic banks to improve the asset \nquality of their balance sheets. The Bank of Thailand has \nbeen using loan-to-value ratios to limit household leveraging \nand property speculation. \n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nIn some other economies, though, macroprudential \npolicies remain relatively loose, and across the region the \nsensitivity of household debt to changing interest rates remains a risk \nto \ufb01nancial stability. This requires policy makers to stay vigilant and \ntighten policy where warranted. In particular, the authorities should \nassess the scope for further tightening loan-to-value and debt-to-\nincome ratios and requirements that banks set aside special reserves \nand actively monitor and account for debt service ratios in their lending \ndecisions. Further interventions may be needed in some housing \nmarkets to cool speculative demand and avoid asset bubbles. \n\n\f30\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nStrong growth momentum  \nand the transition to high income\nDeveloping Asia continues to perform well despite policy \nuncertainty in the advanced economies. Growth projected \nat 5.7% in both 2017 and 2018 means that Asia will \ncontinue to be the fastest-growing region of the world \nand make a signi\ufb01cant contribution to global growth. It is \ntrue that regional growth has, along with growth in the \nworld economy, languished somewhat since the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. To some extent, the regional \nslowdown re\ufb02ects global factors, in particular the global \ntrade slowdown since the crisis. Another major cause is \nthe slowdown of the PRC, which is a normal and welcome \ntransition to a somewhat slower growth trajectory that is \nmore sustainable but still robust. Exceptionally rapid growth \nhas lifted the PRC to upper-middle income, at which growth \ntypically decelerates. These considerations help to keep \nthe region\u2019s less-stellar post-crisis growth performance in \nperspective.\n\nThis broader perspective suggests that developing Asia\u2019s \n\nstrong growth prospects in the short run basically extend \nfrom its impressive growth performance in recent decades. \nRapid growth has transformed the region from mostly low \nincome to mostly middle income within a single generation. \nThis naturally gives rise to a long-term structural question: \nCan developing Asia make the transition from middle \nincome to high income\u2014just as it successfully completed \nthe journey from low income to middle income\u2014in a \nrelatively short period of time? Asia\u2019s past performance \nand short-run prospects give plenty of cause for optimism. \nIn addition, many economies in developing Asia have sound \nmacroeconomic policies and invest heavily in physical and \nhuman capital. Yet past success is no guarantee of future \nsuccess, and a growth paradigm that worked well at low \nincome may need to adjust and evolve after an economy \nreaches middle income. The failure of many middle-income \neconomies in Latin America and elsewhere to reach high \nincome quickly and smoothly suggests that the transition \nfrom middle to high income can be challenging.\n\n1212\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nThe following theme chapter of ADO 2017 examines \nthe issue of what developing Asia, now an overwhelmingly \nmiddle-income region, must do to reach high income. \nSome prerequisites for growth, such as macroeconomic \nstability, are universal and apply to all income levels. A stable \nmacroeconomic environment at home mitigates the adverse \nimpact of global shocks such as higher global interest rates \nand militates against the emergence of domestic imbalances such as \nexcessive household debt. At the same time, the landscape of economic \ngrowth evolves as an economy develops. Above all, productivity \ngrowth comes to the fore as an economy approaches high income. \n\n1.3.6\u2002 Short-term interest rates\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nSingapore\nHong Kong, China\nThailand\n\nIndonesia\nIndia\nMalaysia\nRepublic of Korea\n\n% per annum\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Interest rate for the PRC uses the 3-month Shanghai interbank offered \nrate; for Hong Kong, China, the 3-month interest settlement rate; for Indonesia \nand Malaysia, the 3-month interbank rate; for Singapore, the 3-month \nSingapore interbank offered rate; for India, the 3-month Mumbai interbank \noffered rate; for the Republic of Korea, the 3-month interbank offered rate.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n1.3.7\u2002 Debt service ratios of households\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nHong Kong, China\nMalaysia\n\nIndia\nSingapore\nIndonesia\nThailand\n\nMar\n2006\n\nDec\n2007\n\nSep\n2009\n\nJun\n2011\n\nMar\n2013\n\nDec\n2014\n\nSep\n2016\n\nNotes: Debt service ratios are 4-month moving averages.

These challenges are perhaps epitomized by the PRC in \nits current quest to transition seamlessly from investment-led growth \nto innovation-led growth as it bends toward a more sustainable growth \npath. Whether the PRC and developing Asia successfully make the \ufb01nal \ntransition has enormous implications for the region and beyond.\n\nReferences\nADB. 2017. Asia Bond Monitor (March).

The US is expected \nto add 0.8 percentage points and grow by 2.4% in 2017 and 2018 on \nstrong private consumption and investment, lifting growth for the group \nto 1.9% in both years. Firm labor markets will help modest expansion \nto continue in the euro area, but the outlook for the currency union is \nclouded by upcoming elections in several large economies, with euro \nskeptics potentially gaining ground, and by the risk of Greek default. \nRising exports should help to sustain modest growth in Japan, but \nprospects could be undermined by possible changes to US trade policy. \nWith growth accelerating in the US, the Federal Reserve is expected to \ncontinue its incremental policy tightening. In the euro area and Japan, \nby contrast, accommodative monetary policy is likely to the forecast \nhorizon in 2018. \n\nA1.1\u2002Baseline assumptions on the international economy\n\nGDP growth (%)\nMajor industrial economiesa\n\nUnited States\n\nEuro area\n\nJapan\n\nPrices and in\ufb02ation\n\nBrent crude spot prices (average, $ per barrel)\n\nFood index (2010 = 100, % change)\n\nConsumer price index in\ufb02ation  \n\n(major industrial economies\u2019 average, %)\n\nInterest rates\n\nUnited States federal funds rate (average, %)\n\nEuropean Central Bank re\ufb01nancing rate (average, %)\n\nBank of Japan overnight call rate (average, %)\n$ Liborb (%)\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nActual \n\nADO 2017 \nProjection\n\n\u2002\u20022.2\n\n\u2002\u20022.6\n\n\u2002\u20021.9\n\n\u2002\u20021.2\n\n\u200252.4\n\n\u201315.4\n\n\u2002\u20020.2\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.1\n\n\u2002\u20020.2\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20021.7\n\n\u20021.0\n\n44.0\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20020.7\n\n\u20020.4\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20020.5\n\n\u20021.9\n\n\u20022.4\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20021.0\n\n56.0\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20021.7\n\n\u20021.0\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20130.1\n\n\u20021.0\n\n\u20021.9\n\n\u20022.4\n\n\u20021.6\n\n\u20020.9\n\n58.0\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20020.1\n\n\u20130.1\n\n\u20022.0\n\nADO = Asian Development Outlook, GDP = gross domestic product.\na\u2002Average growth rates are weighted by gross national income, Atlas method.\nb\u2002Average London interbank offered rate quotations on 1-month loans.\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov; Eurostat,  \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/eurostat; Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.go.jp;  \nConsensus Forecasts; Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company; Haver Analytics; and the World Bank, \nGlobal Commodity Markets, http://www.worldbank.org; ADB estimates.\n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200233\n\nA1.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, United States\n\nPrivate expenditure\nPrivate investment\nGovernment expenditure & investment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nSources: US Department of Commerce.

After a weak start in the \n\ufb01rst half of 2016, economic activity in the US strengthened \nnoticeably in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, a drop \nin exports slowed growth again, but GDP still expanded \nat a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (saar) of 2.1%, \nwith private investment rising by 9.4% and contributing \n1.5 percentage points (Figure A1.1). Private consumption, \nthe main source of expansion, contributed 2.4 percentage \npoints. While government outlays remain unchanged from \nthe previous quarter, net foreign trade experienced a sharp \ncorrection in exports and a jump in imports, dragging output \ndown. GDP expanded by 1.6% in the full year, 1.0 percentage \npoint less than in 2015. While the economic performance \nfor the whole year looks less vibrant than in 2015, a trend \nreversal during the year encourages optimism.\n\nPrivate consumption remained the backbone of growth \n\nin 2016. After a disappointing 1.6% expansion in the \ufb01rst \nquarter, it jumped by 4.3% in the second quarter and \nsubsequently posted stellar \ufb01gures. The trend in consumer \ncon\ufb01dence also turned positive during the year (Figure A1.2), \nparticularly in the second half, and remained high as \nwage growth accelerated. The consumer con\ufb01dence index \nsurpassed its 2007 reading in November 2016 and has \ncontinued rising since then, reaching 111.1 in February 2017, \nthe highest since July 2001. Retail sales also rose throughout \nthe year. These trends suggest, as does accelerating income \ngrowth, that private consumption will remain strong and \nlikely be an important driver of future growth. \n\nInvestment declined in the \ufb01rst half of 2016 but \nimproved in the second half on a rise in inventory. \nIndustrial production remained \ufb02at but edged toward \ngrowth near the end of the second quarter as economic \nactivity turned up after declining since the last quarter of \n2015. The purchasing managers\u2019 index showed a similar \ntrend, but its readings have never recently foretold \ncontraction in US production. Manufacturing is gradually \nrecovering from sharp appreciation of the dollar in 2014 and \n2015, and global manufacturing conditions also improved. \nIndustrial production and the purchasing managers\u2019 index \nboth rose in the last quarter of 2016 and continued rising \nin the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017, suggesting continuing recovery \nin US production. \n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\n30\n\nThe labor market strengthened in 2016 and the \ufb01rst 2 months \n\nof 2017.

The surge in employment pushed \nthe unemployment rate down to 4.7% in February 2017 \ndespite higher labor force participation. Moreover, the \naverage duration of unemployment shortened to 25 weeks \nin February 2017 from 29 weeks at the start of 2016 \n(Figure A1.3). Average hourly earnings also rose in February, \nby 2.8%, following 2.6% growth in January 2017. \n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation, on a rising trend since 2015, \n\naccelerated further in 2016 from an annual rate of 0.8% in \nJuly to 2.1% in December, re\ufb02ecting in part the rise in global \ncommodity prices. The trend continued in 2017 with in\ufb02ation \nclimbing to 2.5% in January, its highest rate since March \n2012, driven mainly by higher prices for gasoline, clothing, \nand footwear. Core in\ufb02ation rose at a slower rate but hovered \njust above 2.0% throughout 2016 and accelerated to 2.3% \nin January 2017 (Figure A1.4), suggesting that less volatile \ncomponents are propping up aggregate prices. \n\nThe Federal Reserve raised the target range of the \nfederal funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016 \nand by another 25 basis points in March 2017. Given the \nexpectation for sustained growth in the US, continuing \ngradual increases are expected during the next 2 years, \nbringing the rate to about 1.4% by the end of 2017 and about \n2.4% at the end of 2018. Higher interest rates will likely \nstrengthen the US dollar, discouraging exports, encouraging \nimports, and making it hard for trade to contribute much \nto growth. Despite the interest rate increases, in\ufb02ation is \nexpected to quicken to 2.3% in both 2017 and 2018, re\ufb02ecting \na robust economy. \n\nUnderlying strength in private consumption and \n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\ninvestment points to growth at 2.4% in both 2017 and 2018. \nRisks to the forecasts seem to be mainly on the upside, \nconsidering the possibility of \ufb01scal expansion from the new \nUS administration. However, the probability of an accelerating rise in \ninterest rates and lingering global uncertainty temper optimism.\n\nEuro area\nAfter a blip in the second quarter of 2016 that coincided with the Brexit \nreferendum in the United Kingdom, growth strengthened in the euro \narea for the rest of the year. In the fourth quarter, GDP rose by 1.6% \nsaar to bring annual growth to 1.7% (Figure A1.5). This was less than \nthe 1.9% recorded in 2015, however, as protracted uncertainty on both \nthe economic and the political front weighed on market sentiment. \nDomestic demand remained the primary growth driver, supported by \naccommodative monetary and \ufb01scal policies, as well as an improving \nlabor market and steady incomes. Recovery in exports remained \nfragile, despite recent weakness in the euro. Investment recovered \nnotably in the fourth quarter to contribute 0.8 percentage points to \ngrowth, close to the private consumption contribution of 1.0 percentage \npoint. Both helped offset a negative contribution from external trade. \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200235\n\nA1.5\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth, euro area\n\nNet exports\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investment\nPrivate consumption\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3.3\n\n2.0\n\n1.1\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.3\n\n1.7\n\n1.6\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 14 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nA1.6\u2002Selected economic indicators, euro area\n\nIndustrial production\nRetail trade\n\nConsumer con\ufb01dence\n\n% change, month on month\n\nSeasonally adjusted balance, %\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201316\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 29 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nPerformance varied across the major economies.

Although industrial production \ncontracted unexpectedly in December, as Germany saw its biggest \ndrop since January 2009, it has already rebounded in January, and new \norders signal accelerating production in the coming months. Leading \nindicators suggest that growth momentum in the latter half of 2016 is \nlikely to continue. Economic sentiment rose further in February to its \nhighest in almost 6 years, while consumer sentiment remained upbeat \ndespite upcoming political change in the region. The March purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index neared a 6-year high, indicating continued robust \nactivity (Figure A1.7).\n\nWhile in\ufb02ationary pressures were mostly weak in 2016, \nin\ufb02ation \ufb01nally returned to the euro area, rising from zero \nin 2015 to 0.2% for the full year. In December, in\ufb02ation \naccelerated sharply to 1.1%, the highest since August 2013, \nafter averaging 0.2% in the previous 11 months. The causes \nwere a marked rise in energy prices and higher prices \nfor food, alcohol, and tobacco. In February 2017, in\ufb02ation \naccelerated further to 2.0% from a bigger jump in energy \nprices.\n\nThe European Central Bank kept its interest rates \nunchanged at its March 2017 meeting. It extended its \nquantitative easing program from the planned March 2017 \nclose to the end of the year, aiming to buoy in\ufb02ation and \nmarket liquidity over the continuing growth doldrums. \nHowever, from April it will curtail its monthly purchases of \nbonds from $80 billion to $60 billion.\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\nIn 2017, GDP is forecast to expand moderately by 1.6% as improving \nlabor markets keep consumption robust and export growth accelerates \nwith a euro weakened by divergence between monetary policies on \neither side of the Atlantic. However, a delayed and fragile recovery in \nbusiness and investment could offset the gains from improved external \ntrade. A surge in in\ufb02ation could dampen real incomes and spending, \nfurther depressed by uncertainty with the approach of national elections \n\n\f36\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nin France, Germany, and possibly Italy. Victory for euro \nskeptics in any of them could spell a continental Brexit \nredux, seriously jeopardizing the European Union. Moreover, \nmarkets are responding again to fears of a Greek default \nbecause of a debt repayment looming in July and the current \nimpasse with quarreling creditors (Box A1.1). In Italy, the \ngovernment\u2019s creation of a \u20ac20 billion fund in December to \nrecapitalize its third-largest bank and a number of smaller \nregional lenders currently awaits European Union approval, \ndependent on compliance with rules limiting governments\u2019 \nability to pump state money into banks. Besides these \ninternal challenges, difficult and complex negotiations on \nthe separation of the United Kingdom from the union will \nstart this year and are likely to complicate growth prospects \nin the euro area. Many investment decisions will probably \nbe delayed until at least some matters have been resolved, \nand trade with the United Kingdom, an important trading \npartner, is bound to drop signi\ufb01cantly. \n\nIn 2018, barring adverse systemic shocks, expansion will likely \nremain modest at 1.6%. Employment growth is seen to provide solid \nsupport for consumer demand. In\ufb02ation is expected to rise but will \nlikely remain below the European Central Bank target. Improving \ngrowth in major trading partners should boost the region\u2019s exports, \nassuming that world trade has not been slowed by radical shifts in \nUS trade policy. And while constrained by uncertainty, investment will \ncontinue to bene\ufb01t from low \ufb01nancing costs and the coming online of \nprojects under the European Union\u2019s new programming period and the \nInvestment Plan for Europe. \n\nJapan\nJapan\u2019s economy recorded positive growth in every quarter \nof 2016, but annual growth slipped to 1.0% from 1.2% in 2015 \n(Figure A1.8). The introduction of new national income \naccounting standards in December 2016 prompted an \nupward revision of growth estimates for the past 3 years and \nearly 2016. Expansion was thus revised as stronger in the \n\ufb01rst half of the year. Growth at 1.9% saar in the \ufb01rst quarter \nwas driven by consumption and net exports. Growth at 2.2% \nin the second quarter was driven by private investment but \nsoftened in the latter portion. Private investment dragged \ngrowth down to 1.2% in the third quarter. In the fourth \nquarter, GDP growth was unchanged but this time kept slow \nby public investment. Private and government consumption \nlanguished, but private investment rebounded for a positive \ncontribution. GDP growth slowed despite a boost to net \nexports from a weakening yen, which compensated only \npartly for weak domestic demand. \n\nMonthly indicators suggest that recovery in the \nexternal sector started bene\ufb01ting domestic industrial \nactivity and business conditions toward the end of last year. \n\n58\n\n56\n\n54\n\n52\n\n50\n\n48\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nA1.7\u2002 Economic sentiment and purchasing managers\u2019 \n\nindexes, euro area\n\nComposite purchasing\nmanagers\u2019 index\n\nEconomic sentiment index\n\nIndex\n\nLong-term average = 100, seasonally adjusted\n\n120\n\n112\n\n104\n\n96\n\n88\n\n80\n\nEconomic sentiment threshold\n\nPurchasing managers\u2019 index composite threshold\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSources: Bloomberg; Haver Analytics (both accessed 29 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nA1.8\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth, Japan\n\nNet exports\nPrivate investment\nGovernment consumption\nPrivate consumption\nPublic investment\nResidual\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 8 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200237\n\nA1.1\u2002Uncertainty over a third Greek bailout \n\nThe Greek bailout is back in the news, pushing up yields on \nGreek sovereign debt at the start of the year (box \ufb01gure 1). \nThe European Commission, euro area governments, and \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) disagree about \nthe country\u2019s economic performance, outlook, and how to \nachieve debt sustainability. The latest debt sustainability \nanalysis from the IMF describes public and external debt \nratios higher than in previous projections and concludes \nthat even with the full implementation of policies agreed \nunder the European Stability Mechanism, \u201cpublic debt and \n\ufb01nancing needs will become explosive in the long run\u201d \n(box \ufb01gure 2).\n\nThe IMF has long argued that sustainability requires \nsubstantial new debt relief but also strict compliance with \n\ufb01scal pledges. Changes to debt maturities and interest \nrates granted by European creditors have not satis\ufb01ed \nthe IMF, which has given Greece no disbursements in \n3 years. The IMF refuses to join the third program without \na change in European requests and macroeconomic and \n\ufb01scal assumptions. Meanwhile, the IMF asked that Greece \npre-legislate additional \ufb01scal measures that would be \ntriggered automatically if austerity targets are missed, \nwhich the Greek government has so far failed to do. \n\nThe president of the euro area \ufb01nancial ministers\u2019 body \nEurogroup argues that the IMF debt sustainability analysis \nand its conclusions do not re\ufb02ect improved growth and \n\ufb01scal progress in Greece. The managing director of the \nEuropean Stability Mechanism contends that the IMF \nignores the long-time support and \ufb01nancial assistance \nthat the mechanism provides. Neither argument has yet \n\nconvinced the IMF Executive Board, which has not ruled \nout participating in the third program but may \ufb01nally \ndo so. This is a serious problem in view of parliamentary \nrequirements in Germany and other states that the IMF \nendorse and oversee any Greek program. With elections \nlooming in Germany, the impasse risks jeopardizing \nparliamentary approvals in time for the release of \nbailout funds. \n\nGreece has enough funds to last until July without \n\nadditional aid but will need bailout money to meet payments \nof nearly \u20ac7 billion falling due then. Investor con\ufb01dence is \neroding, and all parties know that a solution must be found \nrapidly. To reach a deal, Greece must adopt additional policy \nmeasures to meet program targets, Germany and other \nEuropean countries must grant real debt relief and ease their \nrequest for a 3.5% primary surplus in the medium term, and \nthe IMF must admit that its debt sustainability analysis will \nkeep showing Greek public and external debt unsustainable \nwithout some compromise in its assumptions. Common \nground may be found eventually. A promising sign is that \nthe latest meeting between the Greek authorities, euro area \n\ufb01nance ministers, and the IMF, on 20 February 2017, ended \nwith preliminary agreement that the Greek government \nwould legislate structural reform, including pension cuts \nand income tax measures if necessary, to meet agreed \ufb01scal \ntargets. However, details about the size of additional debt \nrelief or the exact role of the IMF in the program have yet \nto emerge. Pressure has nevertheless eased somewhat on \nGreek sovereign bonds, and markets appear to be appeased \nfor the time being.\n\n1\u2002Yield on 10-year bonds issued by the Greek government \n\n2\u2002Greek public debt and external debt\n\n%\n\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nPublic debt\nExternal debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n300\n\nEuro area public debt average \n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nMar\n2017\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Bloomberg.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nMar\n\nMay\n\nAug\n\nOct\n\nDec\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund.

However, a drop in \nJanuary, by 0.7% month on month, saw 2017 begin more \nslowly. Machinery orders, considered a leading indicator of \ncapital spending and hence of nonresidential investment, \nrebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. Further, the Nikkei \n\ufb02ash manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index crossed the \nthreshold of 50 in September last year, signaling expansion \nin manufacturing, and rose further to 53.3 in February, for \nthe highest reading since March 2014. Business sentiment, \nas re\ufb02ected in Tankan surveys, appears to be generally \noptimistic, supported by accommodative monetary policy \nand \ufb01nancial conditions. Owing to government stimulus, the \nBank of Japan projects that public investment will increase \nthrough \ufb01scal 2017 and thereafter remain relatively high as \npreparations begin for the Olympic Games in 2020.\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\nIn the national accounts, private consumption expanded fairly \nstrongly in the \ufb01rst 3 quarters of 2016 but barely grew in the fourth. \nMonthly retail sales also slumped toward the end of the year. Although \nsales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in January and consumer \ncon\ufb01dence approached a 3-year high, the recovery in consumption \nseems restrained as real household spending declined in January by \n1.2% year on year. The unemployment rate in January was, at 3.0%, the \nlowest since the mid-1990s. Despite a tight labor market, wage growth \nhas been moderate and could be a factor limiting consumer spending. \nWith domestic demand fragile, the government delayed from April 2017 \nto October 2019 its consumption tax hike, which was originally slated \nfor October 2015.\n\n15\n\nIn\ufb02ation picked up only slowly from 0.3% saar in \nDecember 2016 to 0.5% in January, re\ufb02ecting higher \nenergy prices. Core in\ufb02ation, which excludes food and \nenergy, turned negative in December but then rose as well \nin January, to 0.1%. In its March meeting, the Bank of \nJapan announced that it would continue as necessary its \nquantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve \ncontrol, which it introduced last year, to achieve its 2.0% \nin\ufb02ation target in a stable manner. Accordingly, the short-\nterm policy interest rate was kept at \u20130.1%, and the target for \n10-year Japanese government bond yields is zero percent.\nMerchandise exports recorded positive year-on-year \ngrowth in June 2016 for the \ufb01rst time in several months \non strengthening external demand. They ended the year \nwith a robust 8.9% rise in the fourth quarter, as the yen had \nbegun weakening against the US dollar in September (Figure A1.10). \nMost recent data suggest that export growth continued with a 4.4% \nrise in January.

The consumer sentiment index rose to 99.6 \nin February from 97.4 in January, still slightly below 100, \nthe line dividing pessimism from optimism.

Even with meager expansion in mining hampering \ngrowth, rising commodity prices and non-mining business \ninvestment will sustain expansion this year. Panelists for the \nFocusEconomics Consensus Forecast expect GDP to grow by \n2.5% in 2017, marginally above last year\u2019s 2.4%, and accelerate \nfurther to 2.8% in 2018. \n\nNew Zealand\u2019s economy grew by 5.7% in the third \n\nquarter of 2016, outperforming 5.0% growth in the previous \nquarter.

However, upward pressure on \nprices came in the second half of the year from negotiations \nand eventual agreement among members of the Organization \nof the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut crude \noil production, reinforced by similar pledges from some key \nproducers outside of OPEC. Consequently, Brent crude ended \n2016 at just above $55/barrel, coincidentally 55% above its \nprice a year earlier.\n\nA1.13\u2002 Price of Brent crude\n\nSpot\nAnnual average\n\n146\n\n$/barrel\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n2007\n\nGlobal oil supply continued to grow in 2016, albeit \nmuch more slowly than in the previous year. In 2016, global \noil supply increased by only 0.4 million barrels per day \n(mbd), a fraction of the 3.1 mbd rise in the previous year. \nAfter increasing by 1.5 mbd in 2015, non-OPEC supply \ndeclined by 0.8 mbd in 2016. The US accounted for most of the decrease \nas its crude oil production fell by 5.7%, from 9.4 mbd to 8.9 mbd. \nSupply from OPEC, by contrast, rose by 1.2 mbd. Most of the increase \ncame from Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, whose combined additional \noutput accounted for 91% of the rise in OPEC production. World oil \ndemand increased by 1.6 mbd in 2016, down from the 5-year-high \n2.0 mbd increase in 2015, when oil prices fell sharply. However, growth \nin 2016 still exceeded the 5-year average of 1.3 mbd in 2011\u20132015. \nWith the rise in oil demand outpacing supply growth, expansion in \nglobal oil inventories eased to 0.4 mbd in 2016, or one quarter of the \ninventory buildup in 2015.\n\n115\n\n55\n\n26\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\nSources: Bloomberg; World Bank.

The agreement to cut production \nhas improved sentiment in global oil markets, and oil price volatility \nhas been ebbing since December. In February, Brent crude oil traded \nat $53.50\u2013$56.90/barrel, the narrowest monthly range since January \n2005. Although oil prices have risen by more than 10% since the \nannouncement of the production cut, they have been unable to stay \nabove $55/barrel for long because upward price pressures from the \nOPEC-led production cuts are countered by concerns over renascent \nUS shale production. \n\nIn its Oil 2017 report, the International Energy Agency predicted \na tightening of the oil market in the next 5 years. Underpinned by the \nprojected acceleration of global economic growth, world oil demand is \nexpected to rise by 1.4 mbd in 2017 and 1.3 mbd in 2018. However the \nforecast increase is lower than the increase in 2016 as oil consumption is \nconstrained by factors like the persistent strengthening of the US dollar, \na stronger focus on cleaner energy, and slowing growth in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC).\n\nWorld oil supply this year and next depends on how current restraint \n\non output plays out. According to initial reports, adherence so far has \nbeen high. OPEC production in February decreased by nearly 1.1 mbd \nfrom December production, to average 32.0 mbd. Gabon, Kuwait, \nIraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates reduced production \nby more than what was required. Preliminary estimates show the \n11 non-OPEC producers that together committed to cut production by \n558,000 barrels/day having delivered 60% of the agreed cuts. Outside of \nthe production agreement, other non-OPEC producers\u2014Brazil, Canada, \nand the US\u2014are expected to signi\ufb01cantly increase their output. The \nlargest increase will come from the US, whose oil production reportedly \nbottomed out in early October 2016 and is now forecast to increase by \n0.4 mbd in 2017 and 0.6 mbd in 2018. \n\nmostly on supply developments. Cuts in oil production will \naccelerate the drawdown of the large oil stock overhang that \nhas weighed on markets since mid-2014. An extension of the \nagreement to cut production after 6 months will exert further \nupward pressure on the oil price. With a tighter oil market, \nany supply disruption that occurs exerts upward pressure on \nprices. According to the Energy Information Agency, 2.1 mbd \nwere removed from oil markets in February 2017. \n\nMeanwhile, US inventories have started to rise again. \nIn the week ending on 3 March alone, US crude inventories \nclimbed by 8.2 million barrels. If US shale output starts \nrising briskly, OPEC may be forced to cancel its production \ncuts to protect market share. This possibility exerts further \ndownward pressure on oil prices, as do forecast production \nincreases from other major oil producers.

Barring \nmajor supply disruptions, the price of Brent crude is forecast to average \n$56/barrel in 2017 and reach $58/barrel in 2018. \n\nFood price movements and prospects\nAgricultural prices fell for a \ufb01fth consecutive year in 2016. \nThe index averaged 89.1 points, 0.2% below its 2015 average, \nbut the drop was much smaller than in 2015 because higher \nfood prices largely offset a price fall for beverages and raw \nmaterials. Still, the 2016 agricultural index was 27% below \nits peak in 2011 as downward price pressures from favorable \nsupply and low energy prices have negated upward pressure \nfrom higher demand. \n\nFood\nEdible oil\nGrain\nOther food\n\n2010 = 100\n\n140\n\n120\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nJan\n2014\n\nAfter falling for 3 consecutive years, food prices rose by \n1.6% in 2016. Increased prices for edible oils and other foods \nmore than compensated for lower grain prices (Figure A1.15). \nThe price index for edible oil and meal rose by 5.2%, driven \nmostly by higher prices for palm products, coconut oil, and \nsoybean. Disappointing harvests in Malaysia and Indonesia \nhelped raise palm prices, while rising soybean prices \nre\ufb02ected weather concerns in Argentina and forecast demand \nincreases for biodiesel. Coconut oil production has fallen as \nbad weather caused by El Ni\u00f1o tightened supplies of copra, \nfrom which coconut oil is drawn. After falling in 2015, the \u201cother food\u201d \ncategory rose by 5% in 2016, mainly re\ufb02ecting a sharp 34% increase \nin sugar prices after 4 consecutive years of declines. Sugar prices \nsoared because of reduced production in both Brazil and India, and as \na strengthening Brazilian real against the US dollar encouraged sugar \nfarmers to retain their stocks rather than sell them. Excepting rice, \nprices for all other components of the grain index fell in 2016, re\ufb02ecting \nample supply from good crop yields. Wheat and barley prices dropped by \nmore than 18%, and maize prices were down by 6%. Prices for rice rose \nby 2.6% as inclement weather worsened crop prospects, particularly in \nthe PRC and Viet Nam. \n\nThe rise in food prices has continued in 2017, with the index up by \n10.9% in the \ufb01rst 2 months of the year on increases for most subindexes. \nThe supply of sugar stayed tight, but the edible oil index turned \ndown in February, marking its \ufb01rst month-on-month decline since \nOctober 2016. Better crop prospects and slowing global import demand \nput downward pressure on edible oil prices. Grain prices continued to \ndecline year on year, the grain price index now at half of its April 2008 \npeak. The decline in grain prices re\ufb02ects news of bumper rice crops in \nmost East Asian rice producers and expectations for better wheat and \nmaize harvests.\n\nGlobal supplies of the three major grains\u2014combining stocks and \n\nproduction of maize, rice, and wheat\u2014remain healthy. The latest \nprospects, as reported in March 2017 by the US Department of \nAgriculture, show global supplies of these crops reaching 2.8 billion \ntons in the 2016/17 crop year, 4.9% above the previous year. \n\n\fSolid growth despite policy uncertainty\u2002\u200243\n\nA1.16\u2002Ratio of stock to use\n\nMaize\nRice\nWheat\n\n2001/02 03/04 05/06 07/08 09/10\n\n11/12\n\n13/14\n\n15/16\n\nNote: Years refer to crop years.\nSource: US Department of Agriculture.

Similarly, the market for maize is forecast \nto loosen, with global production in 2016/17 increasing by \n8.3%, thanks to higher crop yields in Argentina, Canada, \nIndia, Mexico, South Africa, and Ukraine. Despite increased \nproduction, higher consumption is projected to leave the ratio \nof stock to use only marginally higher. Recovering from El \nNi\u00f1o, global rice production is expected to expand by 1.7%. \nOutput from major rice exporters India, Pakistan, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam is forecast to rise by 3.3%, but the ratio of stock \nto use will remain close to its 10-year average at 24.6%. \n\nThe outlook for edible oil and meal remains positive, with \nsupplies projected to rise in 2016/17 by 4% after a slight fall in \nthe previous crop year. Supplies are expected to remain high \nbecause of elevated stock carryover, especially for soybeans, \nwhich experienced a production increase in 2015/16 by 12% \nfrom 2013/14, when high carryover began. \n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nRegarding La Ni\u00f1a, which usually follows El Ni\u00f1o, the 9 February \n\n2017 update from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration found La Ni\u00f1a conditions no longer present, which \nbodes well for crops. Upward price pressures will stem from increased \ndemand, higher oil prices, and inevitable unfavorable weather in some \nareas. However, with adequate supply in most food commodity markets, \nfood prices are forecast to rise by only 3.0% in 2017 and 2.0% in 2018.\n\nExternal environment in sum\nWith the industrial economies recovering, albeit at different speeds, \ndeveloping Asia should be able to experience a pick up in external \ndemand. Fiscal adjustment and structural reform in some economies \nwill pay off with sustained growth as external demand from the \nindustrial economies picks up. An assumption is that growth will remain \nsteady in the region as the PRC continues its controlled deceleration but \nis countered by slightly higher growth in the rest of developing Asia, \nparticularly in South Asia. Improved consumer and business con\ufb01dence \nis re\ufb02ected in a recent turnaround in exports. Uncertainty nevertheless \nclouds the medium-term outlook for export growth given the unknown \ndirection of trade and \ufb01nancial policies in the US and Europe.\n\nA very mild pickup in in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ects mostly higher commodity \nprices, but in\ufb02ationary expectations are well anchored. The Federal \nReserve is likely to increase interest rates, but if the increases are \ngradual and anticipated by markets, they will help maintain \ufb01nancial \nstability in the PRC and the region as a whole.\n\n\f\f2\n\nTRANSCENDING THE \nMIDDLE-INCOME \nCHALLENGE\n\n\f\f2.0.1\u2002 Population share by income groups,  \n\ndeveloping Asia and world\n\nLow\n\nMiddle\n\nHigh\n\n1991\n\n2015\n\n1991\n\n2015\n\nWorld\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nSource: Estrada et al., forthcoming.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nTranscending the  \nmiddle-income challenge\n\nDeveloping Asia has transformed itself through sustained \nrapid growth from a largely low-income region to a largely \nmiddle-income one. The vast majority of the region\u2019s \npopulation now lives in middle-income economies, presenting \na remarkable turnaround. As recently as 1991, more than 90% \nof Asians lived in low-income economies, half again the world \naverage of less than 60% (Figure 2.0.1). The region continues \nto grow at a healthy pace, its strong growth momentum \nmotivating optimism about the region\u2019s ability to eventually \nreach high income. However, the transition from middle \nincome to high will not be driven by the same factors that \nlifted economies out of low income. Further, the historical \ntrack record is mixed. Some middle-income economies have \nbeen at this stage for a very long time\u2014notably in Latin \nAmerica\u2014and only a handful of economies have successfully \nmade the \ufb01nal transition, most famously Asia\u2019s four newly \nindustrialized economies (NIEs): the Republic of Korea \n(ROK), Singapore, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, China. \n\nThis chapter explores some key development challenges \n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nthat middle-income Asian economies face and presents some policy options for \ntackling them. While the middle-income challenge has many dimensions, the \ncentral theme is the need to foster productivity to sustain economic growth. \nFocusing on three interlinked productivity-enhancing factors\u2014encouraging \ninnovation and technological progress, upgrading human capital quality, and \ninvesting in information and communication technology (ICT) and other \nadvanced infrastructure\u2014can support economic growth in middle-income \neconomies as they aspire to graduate to high income. \n\nIn many ways, the transition from middle income to high is fundamentally \n\ndifferent from the transition from low to middle. The government typically \nplays a more nuanced role in the economy in the more advanced transition, \nespecially as the private sector becomes more developed. Moreover, as \nan economy matures, productivity growth has to come increasingly from \ninnovation rather than the more basic sources of productivity growth, such as \nreallocating workers from low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity \nmanufacturing and services. To successfully make the transition to high \nincome, middle-income economies therefore need to shift their attention to \nareas that foster innovation and create positive productivity spillover.\n\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park, Abdul Abiad, Gemma Estrada, Xuehui Han, and Shu Tian of the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.

The region\u2019s relatively smooth and rapid transition, as well as \nits robust current growth, encourage optimism about prospects for \nthe next milestone: moving from middle to high income. However, \ninternational historical experience suggests that this transition may \nbe more challenging. It also suggests that, while human and physical \ncapital accumulation continues to matter at middle income, more \nrapid productivity growth is essential to achieving high income. \nInnovation supported by human capital and infrastructure offers a \npromising pathway to productivity and economic growth. \n\nAsia\u2019s transformation to middle income\nOver the past 50 years or so, developing Asia has undergone a dramatic \nshift from a region consisting mainly of low-income economies to \none dominated by middle-income economies. Income classi\ufb01cation \nconstructed relative to per capita income in the United States in \n1960 indicates developing Asia\u2019s dynamic transition since the 1960s. \nThe income classi\ufb01cation is based on 2011 US dollars adjusted for \npurchasing power parity (PPP) using Penn World Tables 9.0 and covers \n107 economies from 1960 to 2014, of which 15 are in developing Asia.1\nFigure 2.1.1 shows that income distribution across the world \ngradually shifted over the decades from being largely low or middle \nincome to one dominated by either middle or high income. While there \nwere 56 low-income economies in 1960, constituting about half of all \ncountries with data, their number dropped to 24 by 2014, only about \na \ufb01fth of the total.

By 1980, slightly \nover half of Asian economies had reached middle-income \nstatus. Toward the end of the 1980s, three economies \nhad already achieved high per capita income: Singapore, \nTaipei,China, and Hong Kong, China. The ROK, the \nfourth NIE, later joined their ranks in the mid-1990s. \nBy 2014, however, 9 of the 10 low-income economies in \ndeveloping Asia had moved out of that income group, while \n5 economies\u2014the NIEs and Malaysia\u2014had transitioned to \nhigh income (Figure 2.1.2).\n\nStandard income classi\ufb01cation from the World Bank \nshows a similar dynamic shift in the region and the world \nin more recent years (Figure 2.1.3). While the World Bank \ndatabase covers more economies and is updated to 2015, \nincome classi\ufb01cation starts only in the late 1980s (Box 2.1.1). \nBased on the World Bank classi\ufb01cation, 49.3% of all \neconomies in the world today are middle income. Only 14.2% \nare low income, and 36.5% are high income.2\n\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nDeveloping Asia now has a much greater proportion of \nmiddle-income economies than does the world, comparing \naggregate data. While only half of world economies are \nconsidered middle income, counting large states and small, 80% of \neconomies in developing Asia are so classi\ufb01ed, for the highest proportion \namong developing regions. Viewed by population, the favorable \ntransition of Asia\u2019s most populous economies\u2014the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), India, and Indonesia\u2014means that more than 95% of \nAsia\u2019s population now lives in middle-income economies. Only 2 of the \n45 developing Asia economies in the sample remain low income, while 7 \nhave already achieved high-income status.\n\n2.1.3\u2002 World Bank\u2019s classification of economies, 1991 and 2015\n\nHigh\nUpper middle\nLower middle\nLow\n\n20.2%\n\n28.0%\n\n18.7%\n\n14.2%\n\n36.5%\n\n23.7%\n\n33.2%\n\n25.6%\n\nSource: Estrada et al., forthcoming.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nAll economies, 1991\n\nAll economies, 2015\n\nDeveloping Asia, 1991\n\nDeveloping Asia, 2015\n\n10.3%\n\n38.5%\n\n51.3%\n\n4.4%\n\n15.6%\n\n26.7%\n\n53.3%\n\n\f50\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.1.1\u2002Comparing income groupings from Penn World Tables 9.0 and World Bank datasets\n\nIn examining Asia\u2019s transformation over the past several \ndecades, two sets of data are used: Penn World Tables 9.0 \n(PWT 9.0) and the World Bank. Income classification \nconstructed from PWT 9.0 ranks economies based on gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power \nparity (PPP) in constant 2011 dollars. The groups are as \nfollows: (i) low income at less than $2,586, (ii) lower-middle \nincome from $2,586 to $5,351, (iii) upper-middle income \nfrom $5,352 to $17,600, and (iv) high income above $17,600. \nFollowing Han and Wei (2015), cutoff lines are derived by \nmaking PWT 9.0 GDP per capita data at PPP in 2011 dollars \ncompatible with the World Bank thresholds for income \ngroupings that are in gross national income (GNI) per capita \ndenominated in US dollars, having converted from local \ncurrency using the World Bank Atlas method.a Adjustments \nare made to make US per capita GDP in 1960 the threshold \nfor classifying high-income economies. In addition, the \nthresholds for lower-middle and upper-middle income \nare calibrated so that there are about the same number of \ncountries in both categories in 1960.\n\nThe World Bank classifies economies based on GNI per \n\ncapita in US dollars into four income groups: low, lower \nmiddle, upper middle, and high. Economies are grouped \non 1 July each year using estimates of their GNI per capita \nin the previous calendar year. The World Bank recognizes \nthat while GNI per capita does not completely summarize \na country\u2019s level of development, it is considered an easily \navailable indicator that is closely related with nonmonetary \nmeasures of the quality of life such as life expectancy \nat birth, child mortality, and school enrolment rates. \nThe thresholds are revised annually with an adjustment \nfor inflation based on the change in the special drawing \nrights (SDR) deflator, compiled from inflation measures \nfor the euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the \nUS. In July 2016, the World Bank released its income \n\nclassification for 2015 as follows: (i) low income less than \n$1,026, (ii) lower-middle income from $1,026 to $4,035, \n(iii) upper-middle income from $4,036 to $12,475, and \n(iv) high income above $12,475. Because these thresholds \nare applied only to current GNI per capita in 2015, and \nother years have their own thresholds, they are not directly \ncomparable with the PWT thresholds that are applied on \nGDP per capita at PPP in constant 2011 dollars across all \nyears. The World Bank has data since 1987, but at least \n20% of the 218 economies in its sample were not classified \nannually before 1990.\n\nRelative to World Bank data, PWT covers more years \nbut fewer economies. PWT allows comparison of income \nstatus since 1960, though only 107 of its 182 economies can \nbe tracked beginning in 1960. The World Bank covers 218 \neconomies but has data starting only in 1987, with close to \n90% of the sample classified annually beginning only 1991. \nSome economies are classified differently under the \ntwo data sets. For example, a middle-income economy that \ngraduated to high income in PWT may still be classified \nas middle income in the World Bank data. Malaysia is \none case. In PWT, its per capita GDP exceeded from 2007 \nconstant 1960 US per capita GDP at PPP and thus could be \nconsidered high income by this measure beginning in 2007. \nHowever, in the World Bank data, it remains middle income. \nKazakhstan and Turkmenistan are two other Asian \neconomies that are classified as high income by PWT data \nbut not by World Bank data. Despite the differences, both \ndata sets show developing Asia\u2019s dynamic transition from \nprimarily low income to largely middle income.\n\na  The ratios of the average GNI per capita to GDP per capita \n\nat PPP in constant dollars per income group were applied to the \nthresholds in GNI per capita to get the equivalent thresholds \nin GDP per capita at PPP.\n\nThe high-income hurdle\nDeveloping Asia\u2019s transition from low income to middle income has \nbeen swift and smooth, but does this necessarily guarantee a similar \ntransition from middle income to high income? Some clues to answer \nthis question can be drawn from international historical experience and \nthe economics literature. The evidence from both indicates that such a \ntransition is within Asia\u2019s reach, but achieving it will require the region \nto confront a different set of challenges. \n\nTime in middle income\nPast research suggests that it may take some time for an economy \nto reach high income even though it has successfully grown out of \nlow income. Grouping economies as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, \nand high income by applying World Bank income classi\ufb01cations to \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200251\n\nlong time series data from Maddison (2010), Felipe, Kumar, and Galope \n(2017) found the transition to be quite lengthy\u2014about 64 years for \neconomies on average that had reached lower-middle income before \nWorld War II. The Netherlands, for example, was the \ufb01rst economy \nto break out of low income in the study, reaching the lower-middle \nthreshold in 1827 and remaining there for 128 years until 1955. \n\nWhile similar marathons of 80 years or more at lower-middle income \n\nare common historically, the pace of transition accelerated markedly \nin the postwar period as the median number of years in lower-middle \nincome declined to 28 years, largely the result of the fast transition \nexperienced by East Asian economies, without which the median is \n52 years. The shift from upper-middle to high income was much faster \nboth before and after 1950, usually 15\u201320 years.\n\nIn some ways, the postwar Asian experience raises expectations of \nrapid transition to high income for today\u2019s middle-income economies. \nJapan\u2019s reconstruction and recovery propelled it into upper-middle \nincome in 1968 and into high income in 1977. Japan was quickly followed \nby the NIEs: Hong Kong, China graduating to high income in 1983, \nSingapore in 1988, Taipei,China in 1993, and the ROK in 1995. The NIEs \ncompleted the full transition from low income to high in 3 decades on \naverage. The high-income Latin American economies, in contrast, had \ntransition speeds closer to the global average. Argentina, Chile, and \nUruguay were already lower-middle-income economies before 1900 \nbut had to wait until the \ufb01rst decade of the 21st century to become \nhigh income.\n\nReplicating the approach of Felipe, Kumar, and Galope (2017) using \n\nPPP 2011 data from PWT 9.0 for the period 1960\u20132014 yields similar \nresults across regions. The rapid transition of the NIEs is evident: \nthe ROK made a swift 23-year transition from low income to high, \nwhile Taipei,China managed it in 27 years (Figure 2.1.4). Singapore \nand Hong Kong, China, which both began the period as lower-middle \nincome, broke into high income in the 1980s. By contrast, the Latin \nAmerican economies\u2014even those that today are high income\u2014spent \nmuch of the period of analysis as middle income. Brazil and Colombia \nhave been upper-middle income since the 1960s but have yet to reach \nhigh income, after 54 years for Brazil and 55 years for Colombia. \nIn general, the shifts in income classi\ufb01cation proceeded more \nquickly in Asia than in the rest of the world, whether the transition \nwas from lower-middle to upper-middle income or from upper-middle \nincome to high income.

More speci\ufb01cally, these studies \ufb01nd that growth typically \nslows when economies reach upper-middle income. Spence (2011) \nused the term \u201cmiddle-income transition\u201d to specify the phase in the \ngrowth process when an economy\u2019s per capita income enters the range \nof $5,000\u2013$10,000. Ag\u00e9nor, Canuto, and Jelenic (2012) argued that \neconomic growth is likely to slow tangibly when an economy\u2019s income \nreaches around $15,000\u2013$16,000. Income variance across economies \nis often attributed to a \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d characterized by sharp \ndeceleration in gross domestic product (GDP) and productivity growth.\n\nEichengreen, Park, and Shin (2012) examined the eventual slowdown \n\nof fast-growing economies. The research showed that such economies \nslow considerably when their per capita income reaches about $17,000 \nin 2005 constant international prices. It found growth slowdowns to be \npositively associated with rapid growth in the preceding period, a high \nsenior citizen dependency ratio, and very high investment rates. \n\nExtending the earlier study, Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (2014) \n\nanalyzed the incidence of growth stagnation in middle-income \neconomies. Their evidence suggested that many economies experience \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200253\n\nslowdowns in two ranges of per capita income: one is $10,000\u2013$11,000 \nand the other is $15,000\u2013$16,000. If found that slowdowns are less likely \nin economies where the share of population with secondary and tertiary \neducation is relatively high. However, this was not true for education \nin general, suggesting that high quality human capital matters more \nfor avoiding growth slowdown. The study pointed out that advanced \neducation is vital for middle-income countries seeking to shift production \ntoward technologically sophisticated products and services. In addition, \nslowdowns are less likely to occur where high-technology accounts for a \nrelatively large share of exports, indicating the importance of moving up \nthe technology ladder to avoid a middle-income slowdown.\n\nThe \ufb01ndings of Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (2014) are consistent \n\nwith the conceptual framework of the middle-income challenge \nput forth by Aghion and Bircan (forthcoming). According to this \nframework\u2014which is ultimately based on Schumpeter\u2019s notion of \ncreative destruction as new technologies and products drive out old \ntechnologies and products (page 62)\u2014graduating to high income \nrequires a shift from investment-led growth to innovation-led growth as \nan economy approaches the global technology frontier. Innovation-led \ngrowth is rooted in innovative entrepreneurship, in which dynamic new \nbusinesses and startups bristle with fresh ideas and different ways of \ndoing things. Institutions and policies must evolve to lubricate the shift \ntoward a more innovative economy. \n\nWhile the studies cited above support the notion of a middle-\nincome trap, other studies do not. For example, Barro (2016), Im and \nRosenblatt (2015), Han and Wei (2015), and Bulman, Eden, and \nNguyen (2014) found that moving from middle income to high income \nis not very different from moving from low income to middle income. \nBarro (2016) argued that there have been no special patterns or trends \nof dispersion regarding GDP growth since 1870 in the 25 economies \nstudied. No evidence was found in this study that the second transition, \nmoving from middle to high income, is more difficult than the transition \nfrom low to middle income. Im and Rosenblatt (2015) similarly found \nno difference. Likewise, Han and Wei (2015) found that middle-income \neconomies are no more likely to be stuck in the same income group \nthan low-income or high-income economies. According to these studies, \nthe growth patterns of middle-income economies do not present any \ndistinctive pattern that can be easily categorized as a \u201ctrap.\u201d \n\nIn sum, evidence of a supposed middle-income trap is mixed. \nSome studies found evidence that economies are more likely to slow \ndown at middle income than at high or low income, but others did \nnot. The much more pertinent question, however, is what factors \nenable middle-income economies to sustain rapid growth and reach \nhigh income relatively quickly? This is the central question examined \nin the balance of this chapter.\n\nA need for a new growth model?\nOne way that middle-income economies are structurally different \nfrom their low-income counterparts is that they have more human and \nphysical capital. This suggests that productivity\u2014the efficiency with \n\n\f54\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nwhich an economy uses capital, labor, and all other inputs to produce \noutput\u2014is likely to become a more signi\ufb01cant driver of growth. The data \nindicate that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, productivity growth \nseems to be the litmus test of an economy\u2019s ability to make the \ufb01nal \njump. Fostering productivity growth must therefore be an integral \ncomponent of any growth model that will successfully guide Asia \ntoward high income. \n\nDifferent structures at middle income\nThe economic structure of middle-income economies differs \nfundamentally from low-income economies, indicating room for \ncatchup growth to reach high income. The box-and-whisker plots in \nFigure 2.1.5a show the heterogeneity of demographic structures among \ndifferent income groups, as well as variations within each income group. \nLow-income economies tend to have a lower proportion of elderly, with \na median of about 3.0%, than do middle-income economies, at 4.8%. \nAlthough middle-income economies may still have some demographic \ndividend to reap compared with high-income economies, which have a \nmedian 11.9% share of elderly population, this needs to be complemented \nby other critical factors that can boost growth. \n\nWhile demographic structures tend to be less favorable at higher \nincomes, human capital tends to improve. The median number of years \nof schooling is 6.1 for middle-income economies, more than double the \n2.5 years for low income economies, though still considerably lower than \nthe 9.7 median for high-income economies (Figure 2.1.5b). Given the \nimportant contribution of human capital to growth, low-income and \nmiddle-income economies need to close gaps in years of schooling. \nAs shown in the section on human capital below, narrowing differences \nin educational quality is even more critical in boosting growth.\n\nPhysical capital is considered important to driving productivity \ngrowth. As with human capital, middle-income economies tend to have \naccumulated more physical capital than have low-income economies but \nnot as much as have high-income economies. Middle-income economies \non average have more capital per capita, $31,260 in PPP 2011 terms \ncompared with $4,374 in PPP 2011 terms for low income.3 One \ufb01nds \nthe same pattern using direct measures of infrastructure development \nsuggested by Calder\u00f3n, Moral-Benito, and Serv\u00e9n (2014). The median \nlength of paved roads in middle-income economies is only 3.2 kilometers \nper thousand workers, substantially shorter than 21.3 kilometers \nin high-income economies but only somewhat better than the case \nof low-income economies, for which the paved road median is less \nthan 0.1 kilometers (Figure 2.1.5c). Electricity generating capacity in \ngigawatts per thousand workers and total length of rail in kilometers \nper thousand workers show the same wide gaps. \n\nThe \ufb01nancial sector in middle-income economies, while more \n\ndeveloped than in low-income economies, also lags behind high-\nincome economies in terms of depth and efficiency. Domestic credit \nto the private sector has a median of 26.4% of GDP in middle-\nincome economies, far lower than 78.5% in high-income economies. \nIn low-income economies, the corresponding \ufb01gure is 13.3%. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200255\n\n2.1.5\u2002Structural features by income group\n\n \na.

However, middle-income economies already \nhave a larger stock of both types of capital relative to the low-income \ngroup. This suggests a bigger role for improved total factor productivity, \nor growth in production not accounted for by greater input use, in enabling \ngrowth in middle-income economies and the transition to high income. \n\n\f56\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nProductivity growth at middle income\nIn growth accounting, total factor productivity (TFP) is the residual that \ncaptures the share of GDP growth that cannot be explained by the observable \nfactors of production: physical capital stock, human capital stock, and labor. \nIt is at best a broad, \ufb01rst-order measure of productivity but nevertheless \nis widely used in empirical studies and serves as a proxy for the efficiency \nwith which the inputs are combined to produce output. \n\nTable 2.1.1 reports growth accounting for aggregate GDP in economies \nof different income classes. TFP is calculated in PWT 9.0 using labor hours, \nnot number of employees, as the measure of labor input.4 Economies are \ncategorized based on per capita income at the beginning of each decade \nand if they moved to another category over the remainder of that decade. \nOf special interest are middle-income economies that remained middle \nincome and those that graduated to high-income status. However, the results \nfor other economies\u2014those that remain low income and those that move \nfrom low to middle income\u2014are also reported for reference.5\n\nGrowth accounting can be useful in that it provides clues on whether \nsome components of GDP growth are more important than others in enabling \neconomies to move up the income ladder. The \ufb01gures reveal that middle-\nincome economies able to transition to high income experience positive TFP \ngrowth in every decade (Table 2.1.1e). Human capital input also rises quite \nstrongly in these economies, probably re\ufb02ecting relatively heavy investment \nin education. Physical capital stock likewise tends to grow rapidly in \nsuccessful middle-income economies.\n\nSome interesting patterns emerge when comparing the results for \n\nmiddle-income economies that successfully rise to high income with results \nfor those unable to do so (Table 2.1.1d). Physical capital and human capital \nplay a similar role in the growth of both groups, but labor plays a visibly \nsmaller role in the growth of graduating economies. More importantly, TFP \ngrowth appears visibly slower in economies that remain at middle income \nand accounts for a much lower share of GDP growth. More precisely, TFP \ncontributed 1.2 percentage points (TFP share times GDP growth) to the 4.3% \ngrowth recorded for the entire sample period in economies able to transition \nto high income. In contrast, it contributed only 0.4 percentage points to 4.1% \ngrowth in economies unable to move out of middle income. \n\nThe decompositions suggest that economies that successfully achieve \nhigh-income status exploit multiple advantages, including relatively rapid \ngrowth in TFP and human capital, and relatively high \ufb01xed investment. \nThe clear difference between middle-income economies that graduate to high \nincome and those that do not is the larger TFP growth in the former, in both \nabsolute and relative terms. It is therefore worthwhile to take a closer look at \nthe determinants of TFP growth in the next section.\n\nThe growth accounting exercise above suggests that, although investment \n\nin physical and human capital will continue to matter as middle-income \neconomies grow richer, productivity growth will become more important as \na driver of economic growth. For middle-income economies to graduate to \nhigh income, they need to achieve rapid productivity growth. Georgiev et al. \n(forthcoming), for example, pointed out that emerging Europe experienced \nrelatively rapid income convergence fueled primarily by rapid TFP growth in \nindividual economies. Failure to achieve productivity growth, on the other \nhand, can doom economies to a long stay in middle income (See Box 2.1.2). \nIn sum, productivity growth appears to be pivotal to the transition.\n\n\f2.1.1\u2002Growth accounting for aggregate GDP by income class\n\na.\u2002All economies\n\n% contribution to output growth\n\nb.\u2002Low-income economies that stay low income in the ensuing decade\n\n% contribution to output growth\n\nc.\u2002Low-income economies that rise to middle or high income in the ensuing decade\n\n% contribution to output growth\n\n \n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\u20132014\nTotal \n\n \n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\u20132014\nTotal \n\n \n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\u20132014\nTotal \n\n \n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\u20132014\nTotal \n\n \n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010\u20132014\nTotal \n\nObservations\n69\n81\n92\n105\n114\n113\n630\n\nObservations\n17\n15\n21\n20\n14\n12\n99\n\nObservations\n6\n7\n5\n3\n9\n3\n33\n\nObservations\n\u200240\n\u200234\n\u200238\n\u200242\n\u200243\n\u200246\n243\n\nObservations\n5\n14\n4\n9\n11\n7\n50\n\nAggregate output \ngrowth (%)\n5.39\n4.77\n2.87\n2.65\n3.96\n3.38\n3.90\n\nAggregate output \ngrowth (%)\n4.71\n4.02\n2.85\n2.61\n5.09\n5.29\n3.91\n\nAggregate output \ngrowth (%)\n6.60\n6.71\n6.23\n5.14\n5.77\n4.79\n6.04\n\nAggregate output \ngrowth (%)\n5.63\n5.35\n2.75\n2.68\n4.17\n4.04\n4.07\n\nAggregate output \ngrowth (%)\n4.51\n4.04\n5.57\n3.83\n4.22\n4.44\n4.27\n\nCapital\n39.4\n58.4\n58.9\n61.3\n48.4\n60.1\n51.5\n\nCapital\n30.7\n50.5\n42.0\n46.2\n32.6\n58.8\n42.6\n\nCapital\n37.3\n53.7\n49.4\n50.8\n40.6\n51.1\n46.0\n\nCapital\n43.0\n60.2\n67.9\n69.8\n48.6\n57.3\n55.5\n\nCapital\n37.7\n57.4\n49.8\n56.7\n36.5\n58.8\n50.0\n\nTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200257\n\nLabor\n14.4\n22.0\n39.7\n33.8\n16.4\n22.8\n22.1\n\nLabor\n21.2\n35.1\n54.2\n62.6\n26.1\n32.7\n36.9\n\nLabor\n16.7\n23.7\n29.4\n27.2\n10.7\n30.5\n20.5\n\nLabor\n10.8\n20.4\n44.5\n34.3\n15.6\n23.1\n21.9\n\nLabor\n21.5\n2.7\n12.9\n15.7\n5.5\n14.6\n10.3\n\nHuman capital\n8.5\n10.9\n20.9\n18.8\n9.8\n11.5\n11.5\n\nTotal factor productivity\n37.6\n8.8\n\u201319.5\n\u201313.9\n25.4\n5.6\n14.9\n\nHuman capital\n7.2\n8.5\n19.9\n22.5\n8.3\n11.7\n12.3\n\nTotal factor productivity\n40.9\n6.0\n\u201316.1\n\u201331.3\n33.0\n\u20133.2\n8.2\n\nHuman capital\n7.3\n9.7\n17.2\n15.8\n8.0\n\u20135.6\n9.3\n\nTotal factor productivity\n38.8\n13.0\n4.0\n6.2\n40.7\n24.0\n24.2\n\nHuman capital\n8.5\n9.7\n24.8\n20.1\n10.3\n11.9\n12.8\n\nTotal factor productivity\n37.7\n9.7\n\u201337.2\n\u201324.3\n25.5\n7.7\n9.8\n\nHuman capital\n15.1\n13.4\n10.8\n12.0\n9.5\n7.9\n11.4\n\nTotal factor productivity\n25.7\n26.5\n26.5\n15.7\n48.6\n18.7\n28.3\n\nd.\u2002Middle-income economies that stay middle income in the ensuing decade\n\n% contribution to output growth\n\ne.\u2002Middle-income economies that rise to high income in the ensuing decade\n\n% contribution to output growth\n\nNote: Growth accounting is based on data collected from Penn World Table 9.0.

What were the main challenges and how have \npolicy makers managed to address them?\n\nOne fundamental reason for the middle-income trap \n\nin Latin America and the Caribbean has been low \nproductivity growth. While the 1980s is referred to as the \nlost decade in terms of growth, it was even worse in terms \nof productivity, with the region never fully recovering \nground lost in its debt crisis. \n\nNormalized global share of GDP per capita\n\nArgentina\nColombia\nEcuador\nPeru\nAverage\n\nBrazil\nCosta Rica\nMexico\nUruguay\n\nChile\nDominican Republic\nPanama\nVenezuela\n\nwere mixed.

Although the 1990s featured a strong reform \nagenda that saw trade and capital accounts liberalized in \nmany economies and widespread privatization, the results \n\nSetting a course for high income\nThe preceding analysis points to productivity growth as key to paving \ndeveloping Asia\u2019s pathway to high income. While economic growth is \nintrinsically multidimensional and country-speci\ufb01c, the vital role of \nproductivity growth in middle-income growth suggests that innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure may be especially important for \neconomic growth. \n\nAll three factors contribute to TFP improvement. Innovation fosters \n\ntechnological progress, which improves the productivity of capital \nand labor. As an economy becomes richer, innovation becomes a more \nimportant driver of productivity growth as other sources, such as the \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200259\n\nreallocation of labor from agriculture to manufacturing and services, \nare gradually exhausted. Human capital contributes directly to higher \noutput and higher productivity, with skilled workers better equipped \nto use advanced technology and create new technology. Infrastructure \nadds directly to a country\u2019s stock of physical capital while improving the \nproductivity of capital, labor, and all other inputs. Road improvement, \nfor instance, reduces economy-wide transportation costs, while the \ninternet reduces economy-wide information and communication costs. \nInnovation, human capital, and infrastructure are no doubt closely \nrelated. This helps explain why middle-income economies able to graduate \nto high income, such as Asia\u2019s NIEs, tend to be strong on these points. \nIt is no accident that successful economies tend to perform well in all \nthree areas. Human capital in particular is an indispensable component of \ninnovation. Quality human capital accumulation and adaptive education \npolicies enabled the ROK to shift to more innovation-based growth. \nInfrastructure investment can boost growth by promoting both innovation \nand human capital. Knowledge reinforces both innovation and human \ncapital, while certain types of advanced infrastructure such as mobile \ntelephone and broadband networks are vital for creating and disseminating \nknowledge. \n\nSeveral studies document the positive and signi\ufb01cant effect \nof innovation, human capital, and infrastructure on TFP growth. \nFor example, in a review of the literature on the determinants of TFP \ngrowth, UNIDO (2007) found that the most signi\ufb01cant factors are \neducation, health, and infrastructure. Human capital enhances the \ncapacity to absorb new technology, which fosters technological progress \nand innovation. Development at the technology frontier also strongly \ndrives TFP growth, implying an important role for innovation. McMorrow, \nR\u00f6ger, and Turrini (2010), for example, found that industries with higher \nexpenditures on research and development (R&D) and adoption rates for \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) experience the fastest \nTFP growth. Similarly, Cardarelli and Lusinyan (2015), a study of TFP \ngrowth in the US, observed how states with higher educational attainment \nand greater investment in R&D often lie closer to the production frontier. \nIn a comprehensive, sector-level empirical analysis, Dabla-Norris et al. \n\n(2015) studied the role of innovation, human capital, and infrastructure \nin TFP growth and document how the intensive use of high-skilled labor \nand ICT capital inputs, and higher spending on R&D, tend to be associated \nwith higher productivity growth. \n\nEconometric analysis clari\ufb01es the relationship between TFP growth \non the one hand and innovation, human capital, and infrastructure on the \nother (Box 2.1.3). While the results are far from de\ufb01nitive and leave wide \nscope for further research, they provide empirical support for the positive \ncontribution these three factors make to productivity. \n\nThe successful middle-income growth model clearly emphasizes \n\nproductivity. Innovation becomes more important after economies \nfully reap the bene\ufb01ts of using existing resources efficiently. Even in the \naccumulation of physical and human capital, the focus shifts to areas \nwith positive productivity spillover such as advanced infrastructure \nand higher education. All of this must be underpinned, of course, \nby a supportive policy environment and a stable macroeconomy. \n\n\f60\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.1.3\u2002The sources of total factor productivity growth: econometric analysis\n\nIn a comprehensive study, Bosworth and Collins (2003) \nattempted to synthesize the findings of the large and \ngrowing literature on growth regressions and growth \naccounting. Constructing a consistent series of growth \naccounts for a wide set of economies, they adopted a growth \nregression framework to examine the different correlates \nof TFP growth. Using cross-sectional data for 84 advanced \nand developing economies during 1960\u20132000, they found \naverage TFP growth to be negatively associated with per \ncapita income (the convergence effect) and positively \nassociated with health as measured by life expectancy, \npopulation size, and institutional quality as measured by \na composite of indicators from the International Country \nRisk Guide.a Other factors, such as trade openness, inflation, \nand government budget balance were not found to be \nsignificantly associated with TFP growth.\n\nThis box extends the Bosworth and Collins (2003) \n\nregressions, adding the three variables of interest\u2014\nhuman capital, infrastructure, and innovation\u2014to \nexamine their role as potential correlates of TFP growth. \nHuman capital is measured using average total years of \nschooling in the population, with series obtained from \nthe dataset of Barro and Lee (2013). Infrastructure is \nrepresented by a composite index, constructed as the first \nprincipal component of five different types of indicators \nof infrastructure provision, taken from Calder\u00f3n, Moral-\nBenito, and Serv\u00e9n (2014). Innovation is denoted by \ngrowth in the per capita capital stock in R&D using data \nobtained from Kim and Park (forthcoming). Additional \ncontrols include per capita income relative to the US, life \nexpectancy relative to the US, population size, and trade \nopenness defined as exports and imports as a share of GDP. \nThe sample is an unbalanced panel covering 64 economies \nfrom 1975 to 2014.b\n\nCorrelates of total factor productivity, 10-year average growth\n\nVariables\n\nCoefficient\n\nHuman capital, 10-year average\n\n0.0180*** (0.0046)\n\nInfrastructure (composite), 10-year average\n\n0.0022*** (0.0008)\n\nResearch and development capital stock per \n\n0.0254* (0.0134)\n\nworker growth, 10-year average\n\nLog of per capita GDP relative to the \n\n\u20130.0070*** (0.0025)\n\nLife expectancy relative to the United States, \n\n\u20130.0081 (0.0185)\n\nUnited States, initial year\n\ninitial year\n\nPopulation, initial year\n\nOpenness, 10-year average\n\nConstant\n\nObservations\n\nR-squared\n\nin parentheses.\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\u20130.0007 (0.0008)\n\n0.0000 (0.0000)\n\n\u20130.0444*** (0.0104)\n\n145\n\n0.220\n\nNote:  *** indicates significance at 1%, ** at 5%, and * at 10%.

The slow-moving nature of the variables of \ninterest implies that most of the variation is cross-sectional \nor between economies, rather than within a single economy. \nFor this reason, ordinary least squares method was applied, \nrather than a fixed-effects specification.\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200261\n\nInnovation for diversifying \nand upgrading production\n\nAs other sources of productivity gains are exhausted\u2014such as the shift \nof labor from agriculture to manufacturing\u2014innovation inevitably \nplays a bigger role in generating productivity growth, especially for \nmiddle-income economies hoping to rise to high income. As economies \nmove closer to the technology frontier, productivity growth becomes \ndriven largely by this key element of productivity, implying a need for \neconomies to switch from investment-led to innovation-based growth. \nIn this scenario, it becomes increasingly useful to understand the \nnexus between innovation and entrepreneurship, which is crucial for \npromoting the entry of \ufb01rms with new ideas or technology. Ultimately, \nmiddle-income economies aspiring to reach high income need to \ndiversify and upgrade their production structure, a goal that can be \nfacilitated by government policies promoting innovation. \n\nThe previous section showed how successful middle-income \neconomies, those that eventually graduate to high income, tend to \nhave relatively fast TFP growth. The importance of innovation in \nproductivity growth naturally implies that successful middle-income \neconomies will be innovative economies. The data seem to bear out \nthis prediction. Examining R&D behavior in middle-income economies, \nwith the sample divided into lower-middle income and upper-middle \nincome, Kim and Park (forthcoming) found that those able to cross to a \nhigher income group typically performed better on standard indicators \nof innovation intensity: R&D stock per worker, ratio of R&D investment \nto GDP, and patent applications per million persons (Figure 2.2.1). \nR&D investment measures inputs to the innovation process, while patent \napplications measure outcomes of innovative activities. \n\n2.2.1\u2002Innovative intensity in middle-income economies\n\nR&D stock \n\nR&D investment\n\nPatent application (resident)\n\nLower-middle income staying there\n\nLower-middle rising to upper-middle income\n\nUpper-middle income staying there\n\nUpper-middle income rising to high\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n0.003\n\n0.006\n\n0.009\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nPer worker\n\nRatio to GDP\n\nPer million people\n\nR&D = research and development.\nNote: The entire sample covers 1975\u20132014 that is divided into nonoverlapping ten-year intervals, except for the last 9-year period: 1975\u20131985, 1985\u20131995, 1995\u20132005, and 2005\u20132014. \nTo examine income-level dynamics, a country\u2019s income level at the initial year is compared to that at the \ufb01nal year of each interval. R&D data are available only in post-1980.\nSource: Kim and Park, forthcoming.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f62\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nInterestingly, the difference in innovation intensity between \n\ntransitioning economies and those remaining in the income category is \nmuch larger for the transitions from upper-middle to high than for the \ntransition from lower-middle to upper-middle. Upper-middle-income \neconomies that eventually graduate to high income have more than 2.5 \ntimes the R&D stock per worker than their peers. This suggests that \ninnovation is a critical ingredient of the \ufb01nal income transition. \n\nFrom investment-led to innovation-led growth: \nliterature review\nA brief literature review on the shift from investment-led growth \nto innovation-led growth provides a better understanding of \nthe central role of innovation in the transition to high income. \nImproved understanding leads in turn to a better conceptual \nunderstanding of the challenges facing middle-income economies in \ntheir quest to become innovative, high-income economies.\n\nGrowth through creative destruction\nIn his classic theory of economic growth, Joseph Schumpeter proposed \nthree main ideas (Schumpeter 1942). \n\nFirst, innovation plays a central role in long-run growth. It is the \n\nnatural counterpart of the conclusion in Solow (1956) that long-run \ngrowth requires sustained technological progress. \n\nSecond, risk-taking entrepreneurs are central to the fostering \n\nof innovation, and these individuals respond to incentives that are \nin\ufb02uenced by economic policies and institutions. In particular, those \nincentives in\ufb02uence entrepreneurial investments in R&D, training, \nand computer purchases that foster innovation. In contrast, an \nunfavorable environment that suffers poor protection of property rights \nor hyperin\ufb02ation, for example, can discourage innovation-based growth \nby damaging the pro\ufb01tability of innovation. Using country\u2013industry \npanel data obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD), Aghion, Howitt, and Prantl (2013) found \nevidence supporting the complementary roles of patent protection and \ncompetition policy in encouraging R&D investment and innovation. \n\nThird, according to the notion of creative destruction, new products \n\nand technologies constantly replace old products and technologies. \nCreative destruction is essentially a competitive process between \nthe old and the new. Incumbent \ufb01rms and interests try to prevent \nor delay the entry of new competitors into their industry, while new \n\ufb01rms and interests try to enter the industry and expand their market \nshare. The efforts of incumbents to hinder new competitors require \nassistance from governments and therefore become factors in the \npolitical economy. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200263\n\n2.2.2\u2002Growth and competition, frontier versus laggard firms\n\nFrontier \ufb01rms\nLaggard \ufb01rms\n\nFirm growth\n\nSource: Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming.\n\nCompetition\n\nProductivity, innovation, and competition \nIn most sectors of an economy, one can think of essentially \ntwo types of \ufb01rms (Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming). \nFirst are \u201cfrontier \ufb01rms\u201d that lie close to the current \ntechnological frontier. Second are \u201claggard \ufb01rms,\u201d which lie \nfar below. Faced with greater competition, frontier \ufb01rms will \ninnovate more to escape competition, while laggard \ufb01rms will \nbe discouraged by increased product market competition and \nthus innovate less. Figure 2.2.2 summarizes the relationship \nbetween competition and enterprise growth for these two \ngroups of \ufb01rms.\n\nAcemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti (2006) suggested that, as \neconomies get closer to the technology frontier, cutting-edge \ninnovation replaces capital accumulation and technological \ncatchup as the main engine of growth. It further showed \nthat low trade openness and high entry barriers become \nincreasingly detrimental to growth as the country approaches \nthe frontier. According to Aghion and Bircan (forthcoming), \nmany middle-income economies fail to achieve fast growth because \ntheir institutions and policies fail to evolve in tandem with their stage of \neconomic development. \n\nThis scenario is best captured by the concept of a non-convergence \n\ntrap in Schumpeter\u2019s growth theory. Speci\ufb01cally, the concept refers \nto the level of development, or distance to the technological frontier, \nat which an economy fails to switch from an investment-based \ngrowth strategy to an innovation-based growth strategy even though \nthe threshold for switching has been reached. An economy that is \ntrapped in this sense stops converging to the frontier (Acemoglu, \nAghion, and Zilibotti 2006). \n\nrates and converge toward the technological frontier through \ninvestment-based strategies when they are between points A \nand B. However, between points B and C they must switch to \nan innovation-based strategy to continue their productivity \nconvergence. Developing Asia as a whole has experienced \na relatively smooth and rapid transition from A to B. Going \nforward, the question looming for the region is how to \nstrengthen innovation and move from B to C.\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is perhaps a good \n\nexample of an economy that has been growing at a very \nhigh rate for a long time but is now slowing down and fears \ngetting stuck as it approaches the technological frontier. \nFor many decades, the PRC growth model has used high rates \nof investment and net exports that are mostly funded and \nenabled by the state. GDP per capita in the PRC increased \nfrom the equivalent of 5% of US GDP per capita in 1980 to almost 25% \nin 2015. However, PRC convergence has started to slow in the past \n5 years. The next stage of development will likely have to come from \ninnovation-led growth, which will require policies and institutions that \nare quite different from the ones that were so successful in helping the \nPRC move out of low-income status.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.2.3, economies often grow at rapid \n\n2.2.3\u2002Innovation versus investment-led growth\n\nTFP(t)/TFP frontier(t)\n\nInnovation-led growth\n\nInvestment-led growth\n\nTFP(t\u20131)/\nTFP frontier(t\u20131)\n\nTFP = total factor productivity.\nSource: Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming.\n\n\f64\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nImplications for developing Asia\nWhat can emerging economies in Asia do to innovate their way out of \nmiddle income? The literature suggests a few priorities going forward. \nFirst, the process of technological diffusion, or spillover, is an important \nfactor behind convergence across economies. While imitation of \nexisting technologies drives technological diffusion at lower stages \nof development, economies need more cutting-edge technology and \nfrontier innovation as their income rises to sustain knowledge diffusion. \nHence, greater investment in human capital and R&D becomes essential \nfor middle-income economies. The rising stock of patents and other \ninnovative activity in Asia, particularly in the PRC, is a promising sign \nin this regard. \n\nSecond, in light of the importance of state-of-the-art technology, \neconomies need to ensure that more productive enterprises can engage \nin and reap the bene\ufb01ts of the latest innovations. One step in this \nregard is better protection of intellectual property rights, which should \nextend to reducing the scope of expropriating successful entrepreneurs. \nAnother is a level playing \ufb01eld for access to \ufb01nance. If innovations can \nbe funded only by the retained earnings of producers or cheap credit \nthrough the state, R&D and patenting are unlikely to be allocated to \nthe most efficient enterprises. Developing Asia still has a long way to go \nin terms of both protecting intellectual property rights and efficiently \nallocating R&D.\n\nFinally, policy must allow innovative enterprises to grow to an \nefficient scale. Innovative entrepreneurs should be encouraged to start \nup and grow, and less productive entrepreneurs should be allowed to \nfail. This relates to the political economy dimension of Schumpeter\u2019s \ngrowth theory. Institutions and policies that favor large incumbent \n\ufb01rms at the expense of new entrepreneurial \ufb01rms and startups should \nbe dismantled. Creative destruction is possible only with enabling \ninstitutions, which play more important roles as an economy approaches \nthe technology frontier. In practical terms, this means that middle-\nincome economies in Asia should encourage the creation of new \nbusinesses by lowering barriers to entry and strengthening the rule \nof law. Stronger competition policies can help to level the playing \ufb01eld \nfor new entrants as well and contribute in this way to competition \nand innovation.\n\nRole of entrepreneurship in innovation\nThe concept of creative destruction holds the entry of new enterprises \ncentral to innovation, and there is ample empirical evidence to \nsupport this. Akcigit and Kerr (2010), for instance, found that new \n\ufb01rms tend to seek more radical innovations to expand their production, \nwhile incumbent \ufb01rms seem content to pursue incremental innovations \nthat rely largely on existing products and processes. Lentz and \nMortensen (2008) echoed this result and showed how more than half of \ntotal factor productivity (TFP) growth in industry can be attributed to \nthe entry of new \ufb01rms. Aghion et al. (2009) extended the analysis and \nargued that incumbent \ufb01rms may innovate more when in competition \nwith new \ufb01rms, especially in high-technology industries.\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200265\n\nThese \ufb01ndings have initiated further research on the impact \nof \ufb01rm entry on productivity growth and the different channels of \nimpact. However, studies typically assume that new \ufb01rms are a single \nhomogeneous group when looking at their contribution to innovation. \nAnalysis differentiating the motivations behind entrepreneurship \nand innovation attributes across income groups remains very \nlimited. But such differentiation may be important. As seen in the \ntheme chapter of the International Monetary Fund Fiscal Monitor \npublished in April 2016, necessity-driven entrepreneurship tends \nto negatively correlate with GDP per capita, while opportunity-\ndriven entrepreneurship tends to positively correlate. Necessity-\ndriven entrepreneurship is propelled by economic need when work \nopportunities are scarce, while opportunity-driven entrepreneurship \ninvolves the development of new ideas or technology. Put simply, street \nvendors are examples of necessity-driven entrepreneurship, fueled by \nthe need for survival, but tech startups exemplify opportunity-driven \nentrepreneurship fueled by potential pro\ufb01ts from innovation. \n\nThe following pages argue that emerging markets and developing \neconomies need to increase the share of opportunity-driven entry and \nmake it a development goal. Along these lines, analysis considers whether \nmiddle-income and high-income economies differ in the extent to which \ninnovation motivates entrepreneurship. This investigation uses two \nrelevant indicators\u2014one called the entrepreneurship motivational index \nand the other being the innovation type of early-stage entrepreneurship.\nThe \ufb01rst measure, the entrepreneurship motivational index, comes \nfrom the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset. The index surveys \nearly-stage entrepreneurs, de\ufb01ned as 18\u201364 years old and either nascent \nentrepreneurs or owner-managers of new businesses. The percentage of \nindividuals who are seeking improvement-driven opportunities is divided \nby the percentage who are motivated by a basic need to be employed. \nA ratio greater than one means that there are more opportunity-driven \nentrepreneurs than necessity-driven entrepreneurs in a population.\n\nWhat does it mean? A higher entrepreneurship motivational index \n\nmay indicate that more new \ufb01rm owners are driven by the prospect \nof developing new ideas or technology than by a lack of job options. \nThis re\ufb02ects opportunity-driven initiatives where an entrepreneur \nhas a new creation or invention that cannot hit the market unless the \nentrepreneur starts a business to take advantage of the opportunity. \nA lower reading, on the other hand, implies greater necessity-driven \nentrepreneurship, which may indicate that there are no other job options \navailable to the entrepreneur, who has to start a new business to \ufb01nd \nemployment. \n\nCharting this index across economy income status reveals a distinctly \n\npositive relationship for economies that already enjoy high incomes. \nAs the left panel of Figure 2.2.4 shows, high-income economies have \na relatively high ratio of opportunity-driven to necessity-driven early-\nstage entrepreneurship, nearly double that of middle-income economies. \nThe ratio shows that, in high-income economies, startups driven by new \nopportunities are 3.4 times as numerous as those driven by necessity. \nIn middle-income economies, they are little more than half as prevalent, \nat 1.8 times as numerous. \n\n\f66\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.2.4\u2002Innovation-related entrepreneurship and income status\n\nRatio of opportunity-driven over necessity-driven early entrepreneurship\n\nRatio of innovation type of early-stage enterpreneurship\n\n20\n\nLow income\n\nMiddle income\n\nHigh income\n\n60\n\nLow income\n\nMiddle income\n\nHigh income\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nLog GDP per capita\n\nLog GDP per capita\n\nNote: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is constructed by surveying sampled individuals. The survey covers 17 years of data from 182 economies in an unbalanced way. Total early-stage \nentrepreneurial activity is the percentage of the population aged 18\u201364 who are either nascent entrepreneurs or owner-managers of a new business. Within this set, opportunity-driven/\nnecessity-driven early-stage entrepreneurship (the motivational index) is the percentage of those who seek improvement-driven opportunity divided by the percentage of who are \nmotivated by necessity. The innovation type of early-stage entrepreneurship is the percentage of the set who indicated that their product or service is new to at least some customers \nand that few or no other businesses offer the same product.\nSources: Global Entrepreneurship Monitor; ADB estimates.\n\nThe second measure, which captures the innovation type of early-\nstage entrepreneurship, is calculated as the percentage of early-stage \nentrepreneurs who indicate that their product or service is new to \nat least some customers and that few or no existing businesses offer the \nsame product or service. As shown in the right panel of Figure 2.2.4, \nhigh-income economies clearly enjoy a higher share of early-stage \ninnovators. On average, 28% of early-stage entrepreneurs in high-income \neconomies indicate that their business belongs to the innovation type, \nbut only 21.8% of early-stage entrepreneurs in middle-income \neconomies do so. Again, the clear implication is that the relationship \nbetween entrepreneurship and innovation is demonstratively stronger \nin high-income economies.\n\nTo achieve high-income status, middle-income economies may \ntherefore be well advised to nurture and promote entrepreneurs who \nengage in new businesses to pursue opportunities based on new ideas, \nespecially startups that aim to provide innovative products or services \nthat do not yet exist on the market. Such a policy would naturally be in \naddition to the more traditional goal of fostering a macro-environment \nthat does not force individuals into entrepreneurship for lack of other \nemployment options. \n\nEconomy and product complexity \nversus innovation\nAnother way to understand how innovation can help an economy \ngraduate to high income is through the notion of structural \ntransformation. As suggested by the development economics literature, \nthis entails changing what an economy produces and exports by \ndiversifying and upgrading its product mix. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200267\n\nIn this vein, Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) explained economic \ndevelopment as a process of learning how to produce and export more \ncomplex products. Complexity is a characteristic of both products and \nof economies. Product complexity refers to the capabilities required \nfor producing a product. Economy complexity refers to the capabilities \navailable in it. Development requires acquiring new sets of capabilities \nto move toward new activities associated with higher productivity. \nThese capabilities include the human and physical capital, legal \nsystem, institutions, and other factors needed to produce a product; \nthe know-how or working practices held collectively by the group of \nindividuals comprising a \ufb01rm; and the organizational abilities that \nprovide the capacity to form, manage, and operate activities involving \nlarge numbers of people. \n\nTo calculate measures of product and country complexity, \n\nHidalgo and Hausmann (2009) devised the method of re\ufb02ections, which \nlooks at trade data as a network connecting two mutually exclusive \nsets: the set of economies and the set of products they export with \nrevealed comparative advantage.6 To make this method operational, \ndiversi\ufb01cation is de\ufb01ned as the number of products that a country \nexports with revealed comparative advantage, and ubiquity as the \nnumber of economies that export the product with such an advantage. \nDiversi\ufb01cation is the simplest measure of complexity in an economy, and \nubiquity the simplest measure of lack of complexity in a product. \n\nAccording to these de\ufb01nitions, an economy that exports more goods \n\nwith revealed comparative advantage, and so is more diversi\ufb01ed, is \nmore complex than an economy that exports fewer goods with revealed \ncomparative advantage, or is less diversi\ufb01ed. Meanwhile, a product \nexported by fewer economies with revealed comparative advantage, \nand so is less ubiquitous, is more complex than a product that is \nexported with revealed comparative advantage by more economies \n(more ubiquitous). The intuition behind these interpretations is simple. \nAn economy can export a certain product only if it possesses the \nnecessary capabilities in terms of labor skills, institutions, machinery, \npublic inputs, and tradable inputs. An economy with more capabilities \nis more complex. Similarly, a product that is less ubiquitous is more \ncomplex in terms of requiring more exclusive capabilities. \n\nTo sum, complexity is associated with the set of capabilities required \n\nby a product (product complexity) or with the set of capabilities that \nare available to an economy (economy complexity). The implication for \nmiddle-income economies is that upgrading export structures toward \nmore diversi\ufb01ed and complex products is critical to foster rapid growth \nand eventually reach high income. \n\nRecent data from the Atlas of Economic Complexity, a research \n\ninitiative of the Center for International Development at Harvard \nUniversity, indicate that in 2014 the top 10 economies by economic \ncomplexity were Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the ROK, Sweden, \nAustria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and the United \nKingdom. Among economies in developing Asia, only the ROK made \nthe top 10. \n\nWhile not in the top 10, other economies in developing Asia have \n\nimproved their ranking from 1995 to 2014. The PRC was ranked 19 \n\n\f2.2.5\u2002Index of economic complexity\n\nJapan\nGermany\nRepublic of Korea\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nIndia\nIndonesia\n\n1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011\n\n2014\n\nSource: Center for International Development at Harvard University.  \nThe\u00a0Atlas of Economic Complexity. http://www.atlas.cid.harvard.edu \n(accessed 31 January 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n68\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nin 2014, well up from its 1995 ranking of 48. Other Asian \neconomies have seen their ranking improve over the period, \nthough not as much as the PRC. Malaysia rose from 44 to 28, \nand Indonesia moved up from 78 to 56 (Figure 2.2.5). \n\nLooking now at product complexity, Table 2.2.1 shows the \n10 most complex products and the 10 least complex products, \nranked from a total of 1,240 products. It also shows the major \nexporters and their share of world exports of the product. \nThe table indicates that the most complex products are \nchemicals, machinery, and metals, and the major exporters \nof these products are the advanced economies. The exception \nis the PRC, which has become a major exporter of some of \nthe most complex products. The right-hand side of the table \nshows the 10 least complex products such as textiles and \nagricultural products. Their major exporters are developing \neconomies, some of them from Asia.\n\nProduct complexity likewise appears to correlate well \n\nIndex\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\nwith economy income. For instance, Felipe et al. (2012) \nshowed that the top exporters of the most complex \nproducts are all high-income economies: Germany, Japan, \nthe Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the US.7 \nBy contrast, the top exporters of the least complex products include \nCameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Malaysia. Further, \nthe 100 most complex products accounted for 8%\u201310% of all exports \nfrom Germany and Japan, the two top economies in terms of economic \ncomplexity. The corresponding shares in many middle-income economies \nin the region such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam \nwere all less than 1%.\n\nTable 2.2.2 summarizes the top \ufb01ve products that the PRC, Indonesia, \n\nand Malaysia export. The products exported by the PRC in 1995 \nexhibited low complexity, such as toys and footwear, but the composition \nof its top exports had dramatically changed by 2014. The top \ufb01ve exports \nby then were largely much more complex machinery and electronics. \nIndonesia did not change the composition of its top \ufb01ve exports much, \nconsisting mainly of much less complex petroleum and other natural \nresource products. Although Malaysia improved its index of complexity \nstanding from 1995 to 2014, the composition of its top \ufb01ve exports shifted \nfrom largely machinery to predominantly oil products. \n\nAlthough many Asian economies have managed to improve their \neconomic complexity ranking, the progression of the PRC is remarkable \nas it has acquired the capabilities necessary to produce a more varied \nand sophisticated range of products. Acquiring the necessary set of \ncapabilities to produce more complex products apparently enabled it to \nachieve faster growth than other economies in the region.\n\nAnalysis suggests that, to reach high income, middle-income \n\neconomies need to manufacture the most complex products. This \ninference seems to be backed by empirical evidence. Felipe et al. (2012), \nfor example, divided 5,107 products into six groups by product complexity \nand found a positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant relationship between \nexport share in the four product groups 1\u20134 (the more complex \nproducts) and income per capita, and a negative and statistically \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200269\n\n2.2.1\u2002The 10 most complex and 10 least complex products and their top exporters, 2014\n\n10 most complex products \n\n10 least complex products\n\nHS4 classi\ufb01cation\n(7805) Lead tubes, \npipes, and fittings\n\n(8444) Machines \nto extrude, cut \nmanmade textile \nfibers\n\n(9204) Accordions and \nsimilar instruments\n\n(8457) Machining \n\ncenters for \nworking metal\n\n(8113) Cermets \n(composites of \nceramic and metal)\n\n(7507) Nickel tubes, \npipes, and tube or \npipe fittings \n\n(2812) Halides and \nhalide oxides of \nnonmetals\n\n(3705) Photographic \nplates and film, \nexposed and \ndeveloped, not \nmotion-picture film\n\n(9027) Instruments \n\nand apparatuses for \nphysical or chemical \nanalysis\n\n(9022) Apparatuses \nbased on the use of \nx-rays or of alpha, \nbeta, or gamma \nradiation\n\nTop exporters  \n(export share of product)\nJapan (96.7)\nROK (2.9)\nPRC (0.4)\nGermany (48.9)\nJapan (24.1)\nPRC (10.5)\nSwitzerland (3.3.)\nItaly (2.9)\nGermany (78.5)\nPRC (10.3)\nUnited States (6.3)\nBarbados (4.8)\nJapan (45.6)\nGermany (19.1)\nHong Kong, China (5.9)\nROK (4.6)\nUnited States (4.2)\nGermany (25.4)\nAustria (17.1)\nPRC (15.7)\nUnited States (8.9)\nJapan (7.3)\nJapan (25.2)\nUnited States (16.2)\nFrance (10.4)\nGermany (10.2)\nItaly (9.8)\nGermany (28.6)\nJapan (16.6)\nUnited States (11.4)\nROK (11.9)\nPRC (11.5)\nJapan (23.6)\nROK (12.3)\nUnited Kingdom (9.4)\nBelgium (8.3)\nPRC (8.3)\nUnited States (23.2)\nGermany (16.9)\nJapan (13.0)\nPRC (6.5)\nSingapore (5.5)\nGermany (23.7)\nUnited States (19.9)\nJapan (9.5)\nPRC (7.5)\nNetherlands (7.3)\n\nGDP per capita, \nPPP (2011 $)\n35,359\n35,104\n12,473\n45,961\n35,359\n12,473\n58,469\n35,807\n45,961\n12,473\n52,292\n14,220\n35,359\n45,961\n51,808\n35,104\n52,292\n45,961\n47,745\n12,473\n52,292\n35,359\n35,359\n52,292\n39,374\n45,961\n35,807\n45,961\n35,359\n52,292\n35,104\n12,473\n35,359\n35,104\n40,242\n43,668\n12,473\n52,292\n45,961\n35,359\n12,473\n72,583\n45,961\n52,292\n35,359\n12,473\n47,240\n\nHS4 classi\ufb01cation\n(5303) Jute and other \n\ntextile fibers\n\n(1801) Cocoa beans, \n\nwhole\n\n(2615) Niobium \n(columbium), \ntantalum, vanadium, \nor zirconium ores\n\n(714) Manioc \n(cassava)\n\n(2609) Tin ores\n\n(5310) Woven fabrics \nof jute or of other \ntextile bast fibers\n\n(6704) Wigs\n\n(4106) Tanned skins of \nanimals (other than \nfur skins)\n\n(801) Coconuts, \nBrazil nuts, and \ncashew nuts\n\n(2709) Petroleum oils, \n\ncrude \n\nTop exporters  \n(export share of product)\nBangladesh (62.7)\nTanzania (16.6)\nIndia (10.3)\nBelgium (1.9)\nPRC (1.2)\nCote d'Ivoire (37.5)\nGhana (24.0)\nCameroon (6.2)\nNigeria (6.7)\nEcuador (6.1)\nAustralia (30.9)\nSouth Africa (20.9)\nRwanda (11.3)\nBrazil (3.7)\nRussian Federation (2.9)\nThailand (56.5)\nViet Nam (13.5)\nUnited States (5.1)\nCosta Rica (3.5)\nCambodia (3.0)\nMyanmar (38.0)\nRwanda (15.3)\nAustralia (14.0)\nDem.

It cannot simply leapfrog into more complex \nproducts. Diversi\ufb01cation and upgrading are path-dependent processes \nin which history matters greatly. Economies upgrade to products \nthat require capabilities similar to those they already possess, by \nlearning and doing. They do not switch to products utterly alien to \ntheir capabilities. History shows that today\u2019s advanced economies did \nnot simply follow their comparative advantage, though, in the sense \nof letting the market decide, when making decisions to diversify and \nupgrade their production structures. Instead, active governments \nfacilitated and induced this process through industrial policy.\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200271\n\n2.2.6\u2002Shares of the most and least complex exports\n\nShare of most complex exports (log)\n\nShare of least complex exports (log)\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nIncome per capita (log)\n\nIncome per capita (log)\n\n \n\nNotes:\n1.\n\n The equation for the share of most complex exports is as follows:\n\n2.\n\n The equation for the share of least complex exports is as follows:\n\nSource: ADB estimates based on data in Felipe et al. (2012).\n\n Export share = \u201312.707 + 1.026 GDP per capita (log) \nt-stat:                  (\u201317.81)   (12.77)\n Export share = 4.150 \u2013 0.600 GDP per capita (log) \nt-stat:                (9.58)   (\u201312.29)\n\nThis has also been the case of Asia\u2019s most advanced economies. \nAlthough it is virtually impossible to use the same policy tools today \nthat these economies used decades ago, governments in today\u2019s \nmiddle-income economies can still play a signi\ufb01cant role in advancing \nand supporting structural transformation. For successful structural \ntransformation, two fruitful strategies are innovation, particularly in \nR&D, and education.\n\nIn a discussion of how the governments of modern middle-income \n\ncountries can think about how to move into more complex products \nand sectors through innovation, Felipe and Rhee (2014a, 2014b) posited \nthat these economies will have to increase their R&D spending, both \npublic and private. However, the structure of R&D in these economies \nre\ufb02ects a model not conducive to commercial success, either because \nthe private sector plays only a limited role in knowledge generation, or \nbecause market-driven demand for technology is weak, as evidenced by \nlow R&D spending. For this reason, middle-income economies typically \ndo not have many high-technology sectors. Meanwhile, the public sector \nis ill-equipped to lead R&D efforts because it lacks the private sector\u2019s \nincentive to commercialize R&D outcomes. However, initiating R&D \nconsortiums with the private sector in targeted industries can be an \neffective strategy by which governments jumpstart R&D investment. \n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) is a particularly important element \n\nin industrial diversi\ufb01cation, as many middle-income economies rely \non it to acquire advanced business skills and technology. However, \nif not managed properly, preferential treatment and R&D incentives \ngiven to multinational corporations can disproportionately increase \nthe pro\ufb01tability of their operations without effecting the transfer of \n\n\f72\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\ntechnology to domestic \ufb01rms. Policy should thus focus more on the \nacquisition of advanced technology through strategic FDI. Sometimes \nsimply buying technology and paying royalties may be the most effective \napproach to developing domestic technology bases.\n\nBesides innovation, education is another area that appears especially \nrelevant to middle-income economies looking to climb into high income. \nThese economies often suffer from shortage of skilled professionals, \nparticularly professional managers. Without a steady supply of high-\nskilled labor, upgrading an economy\u2019s industrial structure is impossible. \nEducation that endows high school graduates with strong cognitive \nskills, especially in math and science, can be more important for \ndevelopment through export diversi\ufb01cation than simply increasing the \nquantity of education available. As the next section will further show, \neconomies committed to growth through human capital accumulation \nneed to refocus their efforts on improving education quality. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200273\n\nHuman capital for emerging \nmarketplace needs\n\nA skilled workforce is indispensable for creating new \nknowledge and technology. It can be considered the core of an \ninnovative economy. Skilled workers are better able to learn, \nuse, and adapt advanced technology. Given the wide gap in \nhuman capital between developing Asia and the advanced \neconomies, there remains wide scope for expanding human \ncapital investment in the region. This not only helps boost \nthe region\u2019s growth but can also improve economic equity. \nThat Asian populations are aging further strengthens the case \nfor investing in human capital.\n\nAs seen in the previous section, middle-income economies \n\nthat graduate to high income are more innovative than \nother middle-income economies. As human capital is an \nindispensable ingredient of innovation, it is reasonable to \nexpect them to have superior human capital as well. Indeed, \nthe data show that middle-income economies that reach \nhigh income invest more in human capital than their peers \n(Figure 2.3.1). The difference is more pronounced for the \ntransition from upper-middle income to high income than \nfrom lower-middle income to upper-middle income. And, \nsigni\ufb01cantly, it is more pronounced for secondary and tertiary \neducation than for primary education. This suggests that \neducation, particularly post-primary education, is especially \nimportant for upper-middle-income economies seeking to \nreach high income.\n\nHuman capital spending, inequality, \nand growth\nSpending on human capital development raises productivity \nand may play a pivotal role in promoting growth, as the \nexperience of the Asian NIEs has shown. The ROK, Singapore, \nTaipei,China, and Hong Kong, China all enjoyed exceptionally \nhigh growth rates from the mid-1960s to the 1990s, allowing \nthem to achieve high income within the period. This feat \nis partly attributed to an environment that fostered human capital \naccumulation, especially of knowledge capital, and the efficient \nallocation of these resources (e.g., Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992, \nBarro 2001, Aghion and Howitt 2009, Hanushek and Woessmann 2016). \nHuman capital accumulation also promised to help mitigate income \ninequality and promote equity, which has become a growing concern \nworldwide, including in developing Asia. Public investment in human \ncapital could be a potent way to improve incomes in the region, provided \nit does not harm public \ufb01nances.\n\n2.3.1\u2002 Average schooling in middle-income economies\n\n \nPrimary education\n\nLower-middle income staying there\n\nLower-middle rising to upper-middle income\n\nUpper-middle income staying there\n\nUpper-middle income rising to high\n\nLower-middle income staying there\n\nLower-middle rising to upper-middle income\n\nUpper-middle income staying there\n\nUpper-middle income rising to high\n\nLower-middle income staying there\n\nLower-middle rising to upper-middle income\n\nUpper-middle income staying there\n\nUpper-middle income rising to high\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nYears\n\n \nSecondary education\n\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\nYears\n\n \nTertiary education\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4 0.5\n\nYears\n\nNote: The entire sample covers 1975\u20132014 that is divided into nonoverlapping \nten-year intervals, except for the last 9-year period: 1975\u20131985, 1985\u20131995, \n1995\u20132005, and 2005\u20132014.

Highlighting the role of \ngreater investment in children, speci\ufb01cally in their human capital, \nLee and Mason (2010) and Mason, Lee, and Jiang (2016), for example, \nfound that fertility decline that is accompanied by an increase in \nhuman capital spending can substantially boost economic growth. \n\nA change in an economy\u2019s population age structure can have two \n\neffects on growth. The \ufb01rst demographic dividend is a very direct \nquantitative effect on income and consumption from a decline in \nfertility. Over the past half century, long-term fertility decline in Asia \nand in the rest of the world has caused radical and important changes in \nthe population age distribution. In the medium term, economies in the \nearly stage of the transition have bene\ufb01ted from an increasing share of \nthe working-age population relative to the young and elderly (Bloom and \nWilliamson 1998, Kelley and Schmidt 2001, Mason 2001, Mason and \nLee 2007). The same demographic forces may also have improved \ufb01scal \nhealth in developing Asia (Lee, Kim, and Park 2016).8\n\nThe second demographic dividend, likewise owing to fertility \ndecline, stems from a scaling up of human capital investment and is \noften associated with three main effects: higher consumption growth, \ngreater physical capital per worker, and augmented human capital. \nMason, Lee, and Jiang (2016) estimated these effects and \nfound human capital to be a highly signi\ufb01cant channel of this \ndemographic dividend. \n\nTo gain better understanding of the issues, the following \n\npages empirically examine the impact of human capital \ninvestment on productivity, inequality, and \ufb01scal health in \ndeveloping Asia. The data and empirical methodology are \ndescribed in Box 2.3.1. Human capital can change as fertility \nchanges, but the observed outcomes are also in\ufb02uenced \nby education policy, parental investment in children, the \nnature of the job market, and other socioeconomic factors. \nThe goal of the exercise is not to estimate the effect of a \nfertility decline on human capital, though, but to compare \nthe different scenarios in the absence of fertility changes. \n\nThe main channel of the economic impact of demographic \n\ntransition is an increase in labor income because of \nhigher human capital spending. With expanding incomes, \ngovernments may directly bene\ufb01t in turn from the expansion \nof their tax base as more income can be taxed and it can be \ntaxed at higher rates. \n\nImpact of human capital investments:  \nsimulation results\nFigure 2.3.2 plots lifetime public and private human capital \ninvestments in developing Asia and in other economies \nwhere NTA estimates are available.

The major source of data is the National \nTransfer Accounts (NTA) (www.ntaccounts.org). The NTA \nis an accounting framework to document economic flows \nacross populations of different ages in a manner consistent \nwith the United Nations System of National Accounts \n(United Nations 2013). \n\nEconomic life cycles are estimated from household \n\nsurveys and government administrative data and are \nscaled to match aggregate controls compiled using the \nUnited Nations System of National Accounts. The NTA \nprovides a detailed measure by age of how much people \nconsume and produce, and how the gap in their \nconsumption and production is funded through other \nsources, namely transfers and asset-based reallocations. \nData on human capital spending and labor income \n\nare based on NTA life-cycle estimates in 12 Asian \neconomies along the whole range of incomes: Bangladesh, \nCambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, \nthe Philippines, the ROK, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and \nViet Nam. Human capital investments are measured \nbased on NTA estimates of public and private education \nand health expenditures by single year of age. The NTA \nmeasure on human capital expenditure contains some useful \ninformation about the quality of human capital, which is an \nimportant dimension of it. It also allows an examination of \nboth public and private human capital investment. \n\nFollowing Lee and Mason (2010), education expenditures \n\nfor people aged 0\u201326 are included in the analysis. \nHealth care expenditure for those aged 0\u201317 meanwhile \n\nexcludes spending related to reproductive health. It is \nimportant to note that the NTA estimate of human capital \nspending captures only those goods and services available \nfrom the market and does not include the opportunity \ncost of students\u2019 time or the value of services provided by \nparents and other family members, which also contribute to \nhuman capital.\n\nAnalyzing fiscal impacts necessarily requires estimates \nof tax profiles. The NTA distinguishes public transfer flows \nto and from households by purpose, such as education \nor pension, and by source, such as labor income tax, \nconsumption tax, and so on. These estimates are not \navailable, however, for many Asian economies in the sample. \nAs an alternative, country-specific tax schedules levied on \npersonal income are used and applied to labor income. \n\nThe economy is modeled as a human capital-augmented \n\nCobb-Douglas production function. Human capital \ninvestments can be made by either governments or \nhouseholds. Public and private human capital investments \nare initially assumed to be equally effective. The analysis \nthen looks at how the results vary when public human \ncapital investment becomes more effective relative to \nprivate investment. The model also introduces heterogeneity \namong economies and among individuals within them. \nHeterogeneity permits analysis of the distributional \nimpacts of targeted human capital spending interventions. \nThe simulated method of moments is used to simulate \nthe impact of increasing human capital investment on \ninequality, productivity, and the fiscal health of Asian \neconomies. Abrigo, Lee, and Park (forthcoming) explained \nthe methodology in detail. \n\ndifferences, including the labor costs that are prominent in the delivery \nof education services (Mason, Lee, and Jiang 2016). Estimates below the \n45-degree line indicate a greater share for the private sector in \ufb01nancing \nhuman capital spending, while values above it indicate a greater share \nfor the public sector. Estimates that are closer to the origin at the \nbottom left signify smaller human capital spending in total.\n\nHuman capital spending in developing Asia varies greatly \nfrom economy to economy both by amount and \ufb01nancing source. \nThailand, for instance, invests on average about 5 years of prime-age \nlabor income on human capital for each person. In Bangladesh, by \ncontrast, average lifetime human capital spending per person is only \n1.4 years of prime-age labor income. Viet Nam and Timor-Leste spend \nabout 2.3 years of labor income on human capital per person, but \nViet Nam relies largely on private rather than government spending. \nThese variations are determined to some extent by each economy\u2019s stage \nof economic development.\n\n\f76\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.3.3\u2002Human capital spending and GDP per capita\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nRest of the World\n\nA.

Two observations are apparent. \nFirst, higher-income economies invest more on human capital per person \n(Panel A). The importance of investing in human capital to promote \neconomic growth is well emphasized in the literature. While most \nregional economies in the sample invest the average amount for their \nincome, if not more, some economies, such as Malaysia, the Philippines, \nand Timor-Leste, spend substantially less. \n\nSecond, the public sector contribution to human capital spending \nintensi\ufb01es as economies develop (Panel B). While there is wide variation \nin the government\u2019s share in human capital spending among developing \neconomies, an upward trend is clear as per capita GDP increases. \nThis shift toward a larger role for governments in \ufb01nancing human \ncapital investment has also been observed recently in health-care \nspending (e.g., Fan and Savedoff 2014) and much earlier in \ufb01nancing \ngeneral consumption in general (e.g., Peacock and Wiseman 1961). \nFigure 2.3.4 presents the simulated impacts of a universal 20% \nincrease in human capital spending per capita on labor productivity \ngrowth (Panel A) and income inequality (Panel B) in 13 developing and \nindustrialized Asian economies. These economies were selected for the \navailability of data needed to estimate the structural model presented in \nthe previous section.

Lower-income economies seem likely to bene\ufb01t more from \nincreased human capital spending. Labor productivity in economies \nwith lower incomes, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal, is \nprojected to increase by up to 3.1% as a result of a 20% expansion of \nhuman capital spending per person. In more developed economies \nsuch as Malaysia and Thailand, the projected impact is more modest. \nIt is quite interesting that in economies at similar economic stages, \nsuch as Bangladesh and India, the projected impact of human capital \nspending per capita on labor productivity can differ quite substantially, \nre\ufb02ecting the peculiarities of their age pro\ufb01les and resulting \nproductivity. On the other hand, the simulated impact on productivity \ngrowth in the ROK and Nepal are about the same, despite the large \ndevelopment disparity between them. This suggests that expanding \nhuman capital spending may also bene\ufb01t higher-income economies \ndespite the usual downward trend in impact as per capita income rises.\nGreater human capital spending signi\ufb01cantly narrows inequality. \nAgain, the impact is greater in lower-income economies than in more \ndeveloped ones. In Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, and Viet Nam, \nincreased human capital spending per capita is projected to bring \ndown income Gini coefficients by 3%\u20135% from baseline values. \nIn more developed economies like Thailand and Malaysia, the decline is \nsmaller at 1%\u20132%.\n\n\f78\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.3.1\u2002Simulated impact of human capital spending on productivity growth and inequality, selected Asian economies\n\nChange in inequality (%)\n\nProductivity growth rate by income quintile (%)\n\nHuman capital\n\nLabor income\n\nQ1 \n(poorest)\n\nQ5 \n(richest)\n\nAll groups\n\nCountry\nMiddle income\n\nBangladesh \n\nCambodia \n\nIndia \n\nIndonesia \n\nMalaysia\n\nMongolia \n\nPhilippines \n\nThailand \n\nTimor-Leste \n\nViet Nam \n\nOthers\n\nNepal (low income)\n\nROK (high income)\n\nROK = Republic of Korea.\nSource: Abrigo, Lee, and Park, forthcoming.\n\n\u20136.7\n\n\u20137.2\n\n\u20133.7\n\n\u20132.3\n\n\u20130.3\n\n\u20135.8\n\n\u20134.3\n\n\u20132.9\n\n\u20134.5\n\n\u20134.1\n\n\u20135.1\n\n\u20135.1\n\n\u20134.1\n\n\u20134.5\n\n\u20132.1\n\n\u20131.3\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20133.5\n\n\u20132.6\n\n\u20131.7\n\n\u20132.4\n\n\u20132.5\n\n\u20133.1\n\n\u20133.1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7.5\n\n7.4\n\n3.4\n\n2.3\n\n0.3\n\n5.7\n\n4.7\n\n2.6\n\n3.5\n\n4.7\n\n4.7\n\n4.9\n\nQ2\n\n5.7\n\n6.1\n\n3.3\n\n2.2\n\n0.3\n\n4.9\n\n4.2\n\n2.6\n\n3.5\n\n3.9\n\n4.3\n\n4.3\n\nQ3\n\n4.0\n\n4.6\n\n2.8\n\n1.9\n\n0.3\n\n3.9\n\n3.3\n\n2.5\n\n3.3\n\n2.9\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\nQ4\n\n2.4\n\n2.8\n\n2.0\n\n1.3\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n2.1\n\n1.9\n\n2.8\n\n1.7\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n2.7\n\n3.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\n2.4\n\n1.9\n\n1.3\n\n2.0\n\n1.7\n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\nThe welfare effects of increased human capital spending may be \n\ntraced to its greater impact on poorer households, especially in \nlower-income economies (Table 2.3.1). In Bangladesh and Cambodia, \nfor instance, labor productivity among households in the poorest \nincome quintile is projected to increase by 7%\u20138% because of greater \ninvestment in human capital. The impact on higher-income households \nis substantial as well, but less so.\n\nPublic \ufb01nances and human capital investment\nHigher worker productivity can directly bene\ufb01t the government. \nThe \ufb01scal impact of greater human capital spending depends as much on \ntax structure as on government involvement in boosting human capital \nspending and on the impact on productivity. Personal income taxes \nper capita in Cambodia and Timor-Leste, for example, are projected \nto increase by at least 3%. In other economies, the projected impact \non government revenues may be insigni\ufb01cant despite large gains in \nlabor productivity. \n\nThere are many different ways governments can intervene to \nincrease human capital spending aside from a universal increase in \ngovernment provisions. Governments may increase human capital \nspending for targeted vulnerable groups while maintaining current \namounts for the mainstream. An alternative strategy is to improve the \nefficiency with which public spending is translated to human capital \nwithout increasing appropriations. These strategies are not mutually \nexclusive but may be combined to create more targeted strategies.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, this subsection considers three \n\ntypes of targeted strategies. Strategy 1 assumes that governments \nincrease human capital spending by 20% per person for each age group. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200279\n\nThis strategy assumes no change in spending efficiency. Strategy 2 \nassumes a 20% improvement in the efficiency of translating public \nspending inputs to human capital, while the amount of public spending \nis kept at the baseline value. Strategy 3 considers both a 20% increase \nin government human capital spending and a 20% improvement in \nefficiency. These three scenarios are combined with three different \ngovernment targeting schemes: a universal program where every \nhousehold bene\ufb01ts from the public interventions on human capital, \na targeted program that is available only to households belonging to the \nlower 40% by income, and a targeted program available only to those in \nthe lower 60% by household income.9\n\nIn all the strategies considered, government revenues are projected \n\nto increase with expansion of the tax base, with labor income per \ncapita growing by as much as 3%\u20135% in some scenarios in certain \neconomies. Increasing both the efficiency and amount of public \nhuman capital spending seems to increase tax collection per capita \nmore than the interventions implemented separately, if they can be \nadded together. There is only a modest decline in effective tax rates, \nindicating household labor income will grow faster than the amount the \ngovernment collects from these households in taxes. \n\nThe \ufb01scal impact of public spending on human capital per capita \ndepends on the government strategy employed to raise human capital. \nIn general, strategies that improve efficiency without increasing inputs \nhave little or no positive effect on the \ufb01scal rate of return from public \nhuman capital spending. Increasing public spending is projected to lower \nthe \ufb01scal rate of return, though rates remain positive in all scenarios.\nIn summary, simulations in individual economies using the NTA \n\ndatabase show that increasing human capital spending promotes \ninclusive growth by improving labor productivity and narrowing \nincome inequality. Government-led human capital investment appears \nto be more inclusive than human capital accumulation led by the \nprivate sector.10 Lower-income economies and poorer households within \neconomies tend to bene\ufb01t more from increased human capital spending, \nwhich argues for early investment. Interestingly, investing in human \ncapital not only promotes growth and equity but may also improve \ngovernment budgets in developing Asia in the long run.\n\nThis outcome is not guaranteed, as it depends partly on how human \n\ncapital spending is transformed to actual productive labor in each \neconomy. Other government policies and the economic environment \nare also important. Moreover, the government interventions on human \ncapital spending that the simulation exercise considered\u2014either a \nuniversal increase in human capital spending, a targeted increase \nonly for vulnerable groups, and improved efficiency in human capital \nspending\u2014are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to create \nmore targeted strategies. \n\nThe aging of Asia\u2019s population further strengthens the case for \n\nhuman capital accumulation and puts a spotlight on the quality \nof education. Intuitively, more productive workers can offset the \nnegative economic impact of having fewer workers. The share of the \nelderly population is rising across developing Asia as a whole, though \nthe speed and current status of population aging varies a lot across \n\n\f80\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nthe region. Populations in India and the Philippines are \nstill relatively young, while the PRC and Thailand have \nsigni\ufb01cantly older populations. Richer economies such as \nthe ROK and Singapore, meanwhile, are at an advanced \nstage of demographic transition. Notwithstanding such \nheterogeneity, there is a clear regional trend toward older \npopulations, and even in many younger Asian populations, \ndemographic dividends associated with relatively large \nworking-age cohorts are set to decline in the foreseeable \nfuture (ADB 2011).\n\nThe pace of demographic transition is very rapid in \nsome Asian economies, especially in East Asia. A transition \nthat took rich Western economies more than a century \nis occurring in these economies in just a few decades. \nFor example, from 2000 to 2050, the old-age dependency \nratio will increase by a factor of 6 in the ROK and by a factor \nof 4 in the PRC. According to Ha and Lee (forthcoming), \nin the absence of signi\ufb01cant human capital investments, \nmany aging middle-income Asian economies may see their \ngrowth rates fall sharply. At a minimum, deteriorating \ndemographics should add a sense of urgency to improving \nAsia\u2019s human capital.\n\nPrioritizing educational quality\nA study by ADB (2015) showed that education can promote \ngrowth effectively only if it is sufficiently high quality to \nsigni\ufb01cantly raise cognitive skills, the thinking skills that \nenable individuals to learn, solve problems, and create new \nknowledge. Increasing the average years of schooling can \nboost economic growth, but this also requires that schooling \nbuild cognitive skills. \n\nThe ADB study indicated that the additional growth \n\nobtained from raising the average years of schooling \nto 11.6, the OECD average, would be relatively low \n(scenario 1 in Figure 2.3.5). Growth would be more rapid \nif economies focused on achieving basic cognitive skills \nthat are comparable with the average in OECD economies. \nIn Figure 2.3.5, this is shown as scenario 2, in which 85% \nof students score at least 400 on international tests of \ncognitive skills for mathematics and science.11 Scores around \n400 indicate that a student has reasoning skills and can \ndo simple mathematical or science procedures. Economies \nwith higher cognitive skills, in which 85% of students \nachieve at least 400 and 15% achieve at least 600 in the tests \n(scenario 3 in Figure 2.3.5), achieve even faster growth when \ncompared with growth obtained from raising basic skills. \nThese economies are considered to have a critical mass of \nstudents who possess top-level skills and demonstrate the \nability to solve complex problems, reason, and strategize, and \nthus would likely become innovators. \n\n2.3.5\u2002 Growth projections from 2015 to 2045 under different \n\neducation and skills scenarios\n\nRaising average years of schooling in Asian economies to the OECD average\n\nScenario 1\n\nIndia\n\n32\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\n4\n\n20\n\n24\n\n20\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nGeorgia\n\n0\n\nMongolia\n\n16\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n2\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nArmenia\n\n5\n\n5\n\nKazakhstan\n\n0\n\nViet Nam\n\n30\n\n0\n\n40\n\n20\nIncrease in GDP per capita from 2015 to 2045 (%)\n\n100 120 140 160 180\n\n80\n\n60\n\nRaising the share of students scoring 400+ to the OECD average\n\nScenario 2\n\nIndia\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nGeorgia\n\nMongolia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nArmenia\n\nKazakhstan\n\nScenario 3\n\nIndia\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndonesia\n\nGeorgia\n\nMongolia\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nThailand\n\nMalaysia\n\nArmenia\n\nKazakhstan\n\n103\n\n91\n\n72\n\n54\n\n37\n\n22\n\n30\n\n23\n\n20\n\n9\n\n13\n\nViet Nam\n\n0\n\n0\n\n40\n\n20\nIncrease in GDP per capita from 2015 to 2045 (%)\n\n100 120 140 160 180\n\n80\n\n60\n\nRaising the share of students scoring 400+ and 600+ to the OECD average\n\n151\n\n132\n\n119\n\n101\n\n71\n\n69\n\n67\n\n60\n\n55\n\n42\n\n39\n\nViet Nam\n\n1\n\n0\n\n40\n\n20\nIncrease in GDP per capita from 2015 to 2045 (%)\n\n100 120 140 160 180\n\n80\n\n60\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nNote: Projections assume that educational reform takes 15 years and that fully \nreplacing the workforce with skilled workers takes another 40 years.

Evidence suggests three important ones. \nFirst is having information systems that conduct quality data collection \nand provide relevant, timely, and credible data on schooling inputs and \nskills outcomes. These systems enable governments to reach evidence-\nbased policy decisions and hold schools and teachers accountable \nfor learning outcomes. Further, providing information to parents on \nstudent and school performance can empower families to demand better \neducational quality. Second is curriculum content that matches student \ncapabilities and fosters the development of critical skills, in particular \nproblem-solving and noncognitive skills emphasizing basic digital and \n\ufb01nancial skills. Basic education curricula, especially at the secondary \nlevel, ideally focus on developing skills that are highly transferable. \nThird is value placed on early childhood education, as this can foster \nsubstantial improvement in skills outcomes. Evidence shows that early \nchildhood education is associated with higher cognitive skills and \neducational attainment, which facilitate other positive outcomes.\n\nKey to middle-income economies\u2019 achievement of faster economic \ngrowth and movement up to high income is a greater emphasis on the \nquality of education, to ensure that education systems deliver more skills \nthat are relevant in the labor market. It is fundamentally the quality and \nnot just the quantity of education that delivers more rapid growth. \n\nRelated to this\u2014and as suggested at the outset of \nthis section\u2014higher education built on a foundation of \nsound primary education may become more important as \nan economy approaches the global technology frontier. \nEvidence from the US indicates that, in states close to the \ntechnology frontier, returns on education that features \nresearch are higher than returns on 2-year college education. \nIn stark contrast, as Figure 2.3.6 shows, the returns on \nbasic education exceed the returns on research education \nin states that are distant from the frontier. The lesson \nfor middle-income Asian economies is that they ought to \nincrease their investment in research-type education as they \ngrow richer and catch up. \n\n%\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.1\n\n\u20130.2\n\nClosing education gaps\nThe pro\ufb01tability of investing in education is indisputable, \nand supporting evidence continues to grow. The long history \nof estimating returns on education in all regions of the \nworld and almost all economies has shown that the size \nof the return on education rivals and often exceeds that \nof investment in most forms of physical capital. A dollar \ninvested in increasing education by 1 year, especially for girls, generates \nan increase in earnings and other bene\ufb01ts, such as in health, of $4 \nin lower-middle income economies and as high as $10 in low-income \neconomies (Jamison and Sch\u00e4ferhoff 2016). Understanding the pattern of \nreturns on education in different settings can inform understanding of \nthe relative bene\ufb01ts of investing in different levels of education.12\n\n2.3.6\u2002 Long-term growth effects of spending $1,000 \nper person on higher education, US states\n\nWithout mobility\nWith mobility\n\nUS states close to the frontier\n\nUS states far from the frontier\n\nResearch-type\neducation\n\n2-year college\neducation\n\nResearch-type\neducation\n\n2-year college\neducation\n\nSource: Aghion and Bircan, forthcoming.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f82\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nUntil the 1980s, intuition, as well as evidence based on thousands of \nestimates of rates of return,13 pointed to higher returns for low-income \neconomies than for high-income economies and higher returns for \nprimary than for tertiary education, especially in low- and middle-\nincome economies. However, since the 1990s, there has been mounting \nevidence of signi\ufb01cantly higher returns on post-primary and especially \ntertiary education from studies spanning most parts of the world, \nincluding low- and middle-income economies in Asia, Latin America, \nand Africa (Schultz 2004, Kingdon, Patrinos, Sakellariou and Soderbom \n2008, Patrinos, Ridao-Cano, and Sakellariou 2006, Riboud, Savchenko, \nand Tan 2006). This pattern reversal is hardly a surprise for two \nreasons. One is the widespread expansion of primary education across \nthe world, including in low- and middle-income economies, thus \nincreasing the supply of low-skilled workers. The other is skill-biased \ntechnological change that reduces demand for low-skilled labor. \n\nThese \ufb01ndings naturally alter the policy implications of public \nspending on education for poverty reduction. Subsidies to tertiary \neducation need not to be very large or universal, as those who can afford \nhigher education will pay as needed. Governments can focus instead on \ncorrecting credit market failures to ensure that the poor have access to \neducation (Colclough, Kingdon, and Patrinos 2009). Meanwhile, efforts \nto make primary education universal need to be continued to build a \nstrong foundation for tertiary education.\n\nAlthough bridging the gap in post-secondary education completion \nrates between high-income and low- and middle-income economies is \nnecessary (Figure 2.3.7), precedence arguably goes to bridging another \ngap, in education quality rather than quantity. Successful education \nsystems provide quality education and equip graduates with marketable \nskills. Working with panels of international test scores, Hanushek and \nWoessmann (2008) found strong evidence that it is skills relevant to the \nlabor market, such as numeracy, literacy, and problem solving, that have \nthe strongest association with high individual earnings, high economic \ngrowth, and equitable distribution of income. \n\n2.3.7\u2002Average schooling years by income group\n\nTotal\n\nTertiary\n\nHigh\n\nMiddle\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nMiddle\n\nLow\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from Barro and Lee (2013).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200283\n\nYet, international surveys such as the Programme \n\n2.3.8\u2002 Educational attainment, middle income versus \n\nadvanced economies\n\nAdvanced economies\nMiddle income\n\nfor International Student Assessment and Trends in \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study continue to \nreveal stark differences in the quality of learning between \nstudents in most low- and middle-income economies and \neconomies that are more economically and educationally \nadvanced. While substantial educational attainment \ndifferences persist, especially in the proportion of tertiary \neducation graduates (Figure 2.3.8), the gap in educational \nperformance, indicating quality of education, is spectacular \n(Figure 2.3.9). The average proportion of 15-year-old students \nin OECD economies who score high on mathematics and \nscience tests is 4 to 5 times greater than in middle-income \neconomies, and the proportion of low performers in middle-\nincome economies on the same subjects is more than 2 times \nthe OECD average. In developing Asia, an exception like Viet Nam, \nwhich ranks at 8 among the 72 economies covered, tends to indicate that \nthe gap can be closed with sound education policies.\n\nTertiary education\n\nSecondary education\n\nSource: Barro and Lee 2013.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n0\n\n10\n\n30\n\n40\n\n20\n%\n\n2.3.9\u2002 Performance on standardized math and science tests, middle income versus OECD economies\n\nMiddle income\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nB.

Programme for International Students Assessment.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nBuilding successful education systems, ones that enable better \nstudent learning, remains a challenge. Such systems do, however, share \ncertain characteristics. One is an effective assessment system that \nfrequently measures student learning and provides timely information \nto students, teachers, and policy makers. Another is accountability and \neffective oversight that requires schools to take responsibility for the \nperformance of the school and of the individual student. Yet schools \nneed a degree of autonomy in planning and the management of school \nbudgets and personnel.\n\n\f84\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nInfrastructure investment for \nfacilitating structural change\n\nInfrastructure typically refers to the basic structures that facilitate and \nsupport economic activity. Here, the term is used to denote network \ninfrastructure\u2014transport by road and rail, electricity, water supply and \nsanitation, and telecommunications by landline, mobile phones, and \ninternet systems. Providing essential services and connecting markets, \ninfrastructure is essential to the smooth functioning of the economy. \nIt is highly complementary to labor and other types of capital, and \nas such its contribution to output gains is potentially large.\n\nInfrastructure differs from other types of capital in a few important \n\nways. Infrastructure projects are often big and capital intensive, \nmaking them natural monopolies. They have large upfront costs, but \nbene\ufb01ts accumulate over very long periods. Infrastructure also tends \nto generate positive externalities as social returns often exceed private \ngains. Because of these peculiarities, which make the private \ufb01nancing \nand provision of infrastructure hard, infrastructure is still commonly \nprovided by governments. Given the budget constraints faced by many \nlow- and middle-income economies, infrastructure often remains \nunderprovided no matter how badly it is needed.\n\n By helping to boost output, infrastructure investment can play \n\na critical role in sustaining growth in middle-income economies, \nincluding in developing Asia. ADB reported in 2017 that Asia will need \nto invest $1.7 trillion per year in infrastructure to maintain its growth \nmomentum (ADB 2017). The type of investment undertaken is important \nas an economy\u2019s infrastructure needs change as it develops. While \nthe transition from low to middle income corresponds to a basic shift \nfrom sectors with low to higher productivity, most commonly from \nagriculture to manufacturing, the transition to high income is more \ncomplex, requiring economies to diversify into a wider set of products, \ninnovate rather than just imitate, and upgrade to more complex products \nwith higher value added.\n\nThe empirical literature to date is sparse on whether infrastructure \nplays a special part in overcoming the development challenges faced by \nmiddle-income economies. To understand the issue, this section \ufb01rst \ninvestigates whether an economy\u2019s infrastructure needs alter across \nits stages of development. It then explores whether infrastructure \ninvestment has a causal impact on output and whether this differs for \nmiddle-income economies. \n\nOn the whole, the analysis reveals a clear pattern in the sectoral \n\nprovision of infrastructure across development stages, with basic \ninfrastructure such as for transport and for water supply and \nsanitation more important in the early stages and more advanced \ninfrastructure such as for electric power generation and information \nand communication technology (ICT) becoming more important in \nlater stages. Faster-growing middle-income economies invest more in \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200285\n\ninfrastructure and tend to have a greater share of infrastructure in ICT \nthan their slower-growing peers. The causal analysis \ufb01nds as well a \nstrong and sustained impact from public infrastructure investment on \noutput growth in middle-income economies, which further underscores \nthe possible bene\ufb01ts of an infrastructure push for this income group.\n\nEvolution in infrastructure needs\nIn thinking about the role of infrastructure at different stages of \neconomic development, it is useful to provide a sketch of how an \neconomy transitions from one income group to another. In a standard \ndualistic development model, low-income economies are able to reach \nmiddle-income status through sectoral shifts\u2014primarily by moving \nworkers out of low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity \nmanufacturing\u2014and by adopting or imitating foreign technology. \nThese sources of high growth tend to peter out, however, once upper-\nmiddle income is reached, as the pool of underemployed labor shrinks, \ncausing wages to rise and competitiveness to decline.\n\nMaintaining growth becomes increasingly difficult at middle income \n\nunless an economy \ufb01nds other ways to raise productivity. This would \nrequire, for instance, strong investment in innovation that generates \nnew ideas, processes, and technologies and a shift to industries with \never higher value added. Infrastructure may be central to this process. \nAg\u00e9nor and Canuto (2015) argued that sufficiently large investments \nin advanced infrastructure such as high-speed communication \nnetworks promote innovation and encourage additional human capital \naccumulation, which helps a developing economy to escape a middle-\nincome slowdown.\n\nOne can draw from this a few hypotheses about the role of \n\ninfrastructure in development. One is that the infrastructure required \nwould evolve as the economy progresses, with more rudimentary \ninfrastructure such as for transport and for water supply and sanitation \ncritical during the earlier stages of development and more sophisticated \ninfrastructure required for industrialization and subsequently \ninnovation, such as reliable power supply and ICT, likely to be important \nin the later stages, particularly when an economy reaches middle \nincome.14 Another hypothesis is that economies that are better at \nproviding the necessary infrastructure tend to perform better.\n\nThis subsection documents stylized facts regarding infrastructure \nprovision in the various income groups to allow a comparison of middle-\nincome economies with others.15 All country-year observations in the \nsample are initially classi\ufb01ed in three income groups: low income, lower-\nmiddle income, and upper-middle income. As mentioned above, these \nincome groups are based on income thresholds set by the World Bank \nand are applied to GDP data from the Penn World Table 9.0. \n\nWithin each income group, the economies are further classi\ufb01ed based \n\non geometric mean per capita GDP growth within a particular income \ngroup, with \u201ctop25\u201d representing the fastest-growing quartile, \u201cmid50\u201d \nthe middle 50%, and \u201clow25\u201d the slowest-growing quartile. This is done \nto see if differences in infrastructure provision are associated with \ndifferences in growth performance within each income group.\n\n\f86\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nFigure 2.4.1 shows a strong positive correlation between \nan economy\u2019s stage of development and physical measures of \ninfrastructure. This is not surprising and has been documented \nelsewhere (e.g., International Monetary Fund 2014). The more novel \n\ufb01nding is that economies that grow faster than their peers in the same \nincome group tend to have more of certain types of infrastructure. \nThis is true of transport and ICT. For electricity, water supply, and \nsanitation, however, there seems to be little or no association between \ngrowth performance and infrastructure provision. \n\nWhile all types of infrastructure tend to increase as economies \ndevelop, their relative importance changes, as measured by their share \nin the overall stock of infrastructure. To explore this conjecture, \ndifferent types of infrastructure are aggregated using unit costs of \nproduction drawn from Fay and Yepes (2003). Examining the patterns \nof provision of the different infrastructure types, it is evident that, as \nhypothesized, middle-income economies tend to switch their focus \naway from basic infrastructure such as for transport and toward more \nadvanced infrastructure such as for ICT. \n\n2.4.1\u2002Infrastructure, income, and growth performance\n\nA.

The latter trend is particularly true \nfor the fastest-growing middle-income economies (top25). \nThe \ufb01gure also shows that the share of water supply and \nsanitation drops as an economy reaches the upper middle-\nincome phase. This is not surprising, as providing water and \nsanitation is a top priority when economies are starting to \ndevelop. As Figure 2.4.1 shows, by the time economies reach \nmiddle income, access to water is already high. The share \nof electric power supply climbs steadily as an economy \nprogresses. This may re\ufb02ect industrialization, as industry \nuses more power than agriculture, but it may also re\ufb02ect \nhigher energy consumption in homes.

Interestingly, though, \nfaster-growing economies invest more in their infrastructure. \nExamining the breakdown of overall infrastructure \ninvestment into public and private components, one can \nsee that the public component is larger in fast-growing \neconomies. Higher infrastructure investment is not driven \nby higher incomes, as the compared economies are in the \nsame income group. There are two possible explanations \nfor the positive association between infrastructure \ninvestment and growth performance. It could be that \ninfrastructure investment enables or causes higher growth, \nor infrastructure investment could be simply responding to \nhigher growth.

Country and \ntime fixed effects are included to control for systematic \nunobserved heterogeneity across economies and over time.\n\na  For completeness, dummies are introduced for high-income \n\neconomies with GDP per capita at PPP in constant 2011 dollars \n\u2265 $17,600. Results are similar when regressions are estimated on \na sample that excludes high-income economies. \n\nb  The results are similar when GDP per capita and its square are \nused in place of income group dummies. See Abiad, Debuque-\nGonzales, and Sy (forthcoming) for details. \n\nare adopted in this subsection to better examine the relationship \nbetween infrastructure, stage of development, and growth performance. \nThe methodology is outlined in Box 2.4.1.\n\nWhat do the results of this exercise reveal? The regressions con\ufb01rm \nthat lower-middle-income economies tend to have greater infrastructure \nstock than low-income economies, and that upper middle-income \neconomies tend to have higher infrastructure stock than both groups \n(Table 2.4.2). This is true for most types of infrastructure. \n\nA few results stand out that add nuance to the previous observations \n\non infrastructure provision across development stages. One is the \ncontinued accumulation of mobile, internet, and energy infrastructure \nthroughout and beyond the middle-income stage, as evidenced by the \nincreasing size of the country income dummy coefficients.17 The other, \nalso based on these coefficients, is the tendency for telephone line, \ntransport, and water supply and sanitation provision to level off \nfollowing a run-up during the upper middle-income phase. \n\nRegarding roads, a possible explanation is that, during early stages \nof development, the focus is on expanding the road network, or building \nnew roads where none existed. At later stages of development, however, \nthe focus shifts to improving the quality and capacity of existing roads \nby widening and by converting provincial into national roads then into \nlimited-access highways. This is not captured in the indicator, which \nmeasures only the length of the road network. Access to water supply \nand sanitation also tends to rise during early middle-income stages, and \nexpansion in these services naturally tapers as access becomes nearly \nuniversal by the time an economy reaches high income or even upper-\nmiddle income.\n\n\f90\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nVariables\n\nLower-middle income\n\nHigh income\n\nMid 50% for growth\n\nTop 25% for growth\n\nUrbanization\n\nConstant\n\nObservations\n\nR-squared\n\n2.4.2\u2002Sectoral infrastructure regressions using income group dummies\n\nTelephone \nmainlines \n(1)\n\nMobile \nphones \n(2)\n\nInternet \nusers \n(3)\n\nTotal \nroads \n(4)\n\nElectricity \n(6)\n\nWater \naccess \n(7)\n\nSanitation \naccess \n(8)\n\n0.518***\n\n0.892***\n\n0.760***\n\n0.300***\n\n0.327***\n\n3.540***\n\n5.007***\n\nUpper-middle income\n\n0.900***\n\n1.390***\n\n1.602***\n\n0.339***\n\n(0.049)\n\n(0.125)\n\n(0.162)\n\n(0.023)\n\n(0.031)\n\n(1.363)\n\n0.485***\n\n4.917***\n\n(0.064)\n\n(0.164)\n\n(0.213)\n\n(0.042)\n\n0.817***\n\n1.845***\n\n1.880***\n\n0.277***\n\n(0.072)\n\n(0.244)\n\n0.030\n\n0.017\n\n(0.039)\n\n(0.129)\n\n0.231***\n\n0.500***\n\n(0.053)\n\n(0.184)\n\n(0.268)\n\n0.336***\n\n(0.124)\n\n0.268*\n\n(0.161)\n\n(0.046)\n\n\u20130.037*\n\n(0.020)\n\n\u20130.138***\n\n(0.033)\n\nRails \n(5)\n\n\u20130.013\n\n(0.016)\n\n0.067**\n\n(0.027)\n\n0.069**\n\n(0.031)\n\n0.033*\n\n(0.017)\n\n\u20130.011\n\n(0.020)\n\n\u20130.079***\n\n1.994\n\n(0.046)\n\n0.600***\n\n(0.054)\n\n(0.026)\n\n\u20130.081**\n\n(0.040)\n\n(1.753)\n\n4.027*\n\n(2.163)\n\n(1.470)\n\n3.861**\n\n(1.578)\n\n\u20130.095\n\n(0.081)\n\n(0.798)\n\n7.665***\n\n(0.885)\n\n6.390***\n\n(1.011)\n\n1.498**\n\n(0.684)\n\n1.953***\n\n(0.632)\n\n\u20130.148***\n\n(0.027)\n\nAgriculture, share of GDP\n\n\u20130.033***\n\n\u20130.081***\n\n\u20130.071***\n\n\u20130.011***\n\n0.000\n\n\u20130.012***\n\n(0.009)\n\n(0.010)\n\n(0.001)\n\n(0.001)\n\n(0.0020)\n\nPopulation density\n\n6.941***\n\n5.482***\n\n0.274***\n\n0.045\n\n\u20130.302***\n\n21.519***\n\n6.401***\n\n(0.003)\n\n0.164**\n\n(0.076)\n\n0.027***\n\n(0.003)\n\n(0.515)\n\n\u20130.003\n\n(0.012)\n\n(0.447)\n\n(0.042)\n\n0.044***\n\n0.005***\n\n(0.014)\n\n(0.002)\n\n(0.038)\n\n0.002*\n\n(0.001)\n\n(0.049)\n\n(3.094)\n\n(1.017)\n\n0.020***\n\n0.308***\n\n0.440***\n\n(0.002)\n\n(0.102)\n\n(0.043)\n\n\u20131.161***\n\n\u201335.147***\n\n\u201332.377***\n\n\u20132.219***\n\n\u20134.120***\n\n3.009***\n\n\u201324.508*\n\n31.082***\n\n(0.320)\n\n(2.480)\n\n(2.166)\n\n(0.198)\n\n(0.127)\n\n(0.270)\n\n(13.818)\n\n(4.790)\n\n3,249\n\n0.968\n\n2,016\n\n0.915\n\n1,779\n\n0.931\n\n3,291\n\n0.978\n\n3,225\n\n0.981\n\n3,713\n\n0.978\n\n525\n\n0.965\n\n2,045\n\n0.993\n\nFormal test of differences in coefficients:\n\nUpper middle > Lower middle \n\nHigh income > Upper middle \n\nTop 25% > Mid 50%\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n*** = p < 0.01, ** = p < 0.05, * = p < 0.1. \nNote: All regressions include economy and year fixed effects.\nSource: Abiad, Debuque-Gonzales, and Sy, forthcoming.\n\nThe regressions con\ufb01rm the positive association between growth \nperformance and certain types of infrastructure stock.

This group of economies also seems to be largely \nbehind the positive association between growth performance and access \nto water supply and sanitation. \n\nAll things considered, the stylized facts and regression results \nsuggest a hierarchy of needs where economies are more likely to invest \nin basic infrastructure such as water supply and sanitation, roads, \npower, and telephone mainlines during early stages of development. \nEconomies then seem to turn their attention to advanced infrastructure \nsuch as mobile and internet connections when they reach the upper-\nmiddle income, with power continuing to be a priority. Fast-growing \neconomies within each income group tend to have higher infrastructure \nstock than their slower-growing counterparts for certain types of \ninfrastructure, notably ICT.\n\nThe macroeconomic effects of public investment\nDiscussions above have established an association between \ninfrastructure provision and investment, on the one hand, and \nstage of development and growth performance on the other. But the \nbivariate charts and multivariate regressions cannot shed light on \nthe direction of causality. The positive relationship could arise from \noutput responding to infrastructure investment as the latter boosts \ndemand in the short term or the productivity of existing factors of \nproduction in the long term. It could arise as well from infrastructure \nresponding to output, either because higher output makes it easier to \npay for infrastructure or because expectations of higher growth induce \ngreater investment in infrastructure. This is a problem that has long \nplagued the literature on the macroeconomic effects of infrastructure \ninvestment. \n\n\f92\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nThe challenge is to identify changes in infrastructure investment \n\nthat are not driven by contemporaneous or lagged output, nor by \nexpectations of future output growth. To tackle this issue, the following \npages adopt the empirical strategy of Corsetti, Meier, and M\u00fcller (2012), \nwhich relies on the idea that signi\ufb01cant parts of government spending \nare likely to be determined by past information and cannot easily \nrespond to current economic conditions. Based on this assumption, \none can estimate a \ufb01scal policy rule for public investment and from \nthis obtain a series of exogenous shocks to public investment.19 \nThe estimated policy shocks can then be used to trace the dynamic \neffects of public investment on output.\n\nIn principle, the assumption that public investment cannot easily \nrespond to current economic conditions may not hold for two reasons. \nFirst, public spending can automatically respond to cyclical conditions. \nThis should not pose a problem for public investment, however, because \nautomatic stabilizers work mostly through revenues and social spending. \nSecond, discretionary public investment spending can occur in response \nto output conditions. As discussed in Corsetti, Meier, and M\u00fcller (2012), \nthe relevance of this concern relates to the precise de\ufb01nition of \ncontemporaneous feedback effects. Although it is typically assumed in \nthe literature that government spending does not react to changes in \neconomic activity within a given quarter (Blanchard and Perotti 2002), \nwhether it may respond in a period longer than a quarter is an open \nquestion. Recent evidence for advanced economies suggests that the \nrestriction that government spending does not respond to economic \nconditions within a year cannot be rejected (Beetsma, Giuliodori, \nand Klaassen 2009, Born and M\u00fcller 2012). Box 2.4.2 describes the \nempirical methodology for estimating the macroeconomic impact of \ninfrastructure.\n\nThe results suggest that public investment has a positive and \npersistent impact on output in developing economies (Figure 2.4.5, \nPanel A). The contemporaneous effect of an increase in public investment \nequal to 1% of GDP is a 0.3% increase in output. This gradually increases \nto 1.2% in the 7th year after the shock, with an impact signi\ufb01cantly \ndifferent from zero in both the short and the long run. \n\n2.4.5\u2002Effect of public investment on output\n\nA.

In low-income economies, public investment \nshocks do not raise output immediately. There is an increase in \nlong-term output of 1.1% after 7 years, but with increasing size of the \nstandard error as time passes after the shock, the estimated impact \nis not signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. In middle-income economies, \npublic investment shocks raise output by 0.6% immediately, and \nthe effect is signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. Over time, the impact \nincreases to 1.1% in the 7th year after the shock, and this long-run effect \nis also signi\ufb01cantly different from zero. Although the patterns in the \nmiddle-income and low-income subsamples are noticeably different, \ngiven the large error bands around the estimated effects, one cannot \nreject that the impact in both types of economies is the same. \n\nThe somewhat weaker impact of public investment in low-income \neconomies may seem counterintuitive but is consistent with evidence \nfrom studies, such as Warner (2014) and Kraay (2012). This is an \nimportant point: Infrastructure investment can have a wide range \nof outcomes, and even though the positive association between \ninfrastructure provision and development is clear, positive causal effects \nfrom infrastructure investment to output require the right conditions. \nFailure of public investment to lead to sustained output growth is often \nattributed to poor investment efficiency that inhibits the conversion \n\n\f94\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nof dollar spending into productive capital stock. Another cited reason \nfor weak output gains is the limited absorptive capacity of certain \neconomies, with marginal returns likely to decline as investment outlays \nare scaled up (Presbitero 2016). One can reasonably expect absorptive \ncapacity constraints, which occur during a rapid acceleration and \nratcheting up of public investment, to be more severe in low-income \neconomies. Governments also tend to focus on basic infrastructure \nsuch as water supply and sanitation in earlier development stages. \nSuch investments, while vital, may not be particularly growth-\nenhancing and are therefore unlikely to catalyze substantial output \ngains. A \ufb01nal explanation is that the marginal productivity of \ninfrastructure investment may not be higher in low-income economies \ndespite the more acute shortage of infrastructure there, because \ncomplementary factors of production\u2014human capital, private capital, \nand the right institutions\u2014are in similarly short supply.\n\nInvest more, and in the right kinds \nof infrastructure\nWhat role does infrastructure play in middle-income economies? \nThe analysis uncovered several noteworthy results. Looking at the \nstylized facts, one \ufb01nds that the stock of infrastructure tends to rise \nwith income, and with growth performance. Infrastructure type \nsystematically varies with an economy\u2019s stage of development, re\ufb02ecting \na clear hierarchy of requirements. Transport, basic communications, \nwater supply, and sanitation are more important at early stages of \ndevelopment, while reliable electricity supply and ICT become more \nimportant as economies advance. \n\nBetter-performing economies, especially among middle-income \neconomies, differ from others in their income group in two important \nways. Faster-growing economies tend to have more of certain types \nof infrastructure\u2014especially ICT\u2014than their peers. They also invest a \nbigger share of GDP in infrastructure. The strong positive association \nof certain types of infrastructure with growth at different stages of \ndevelopment suggests a potential policy lever for governments grappling \nwith the middle-income challenge of sustaining growth. It is not enough \nto simply raise the amount of infrastructure investment, economies \nalso need to invest in the right types of infrastructure, which depend \non their current stage of development. While it may be bene\ufb01cial for a \nlow-income economy to focus initially on basic infrastructure such as \nwater supply and sanitation, for instance, analysis \ufb01nds that they \nshould shift attention to more advanced infrastructure such as ICT \nduring their middle-income stage, and especially during their upper \nmiddle-income stages.\n\nThe experience of the Republic of Korea (ROK) is illustrative. \nThe ROK was on the cusp of transitioning to high income in the \nmid-1990s, and by some measures it crossed the threshold in 1995. \nBut shortly thereafter, it was hit hard by the Asian \ufb01nancial crisis, \nimperiling its newfound status as a high-income economy. Several \nstudies, including Lee (2003), Oh and Larson (2011), Bae (2011), \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200295\n\nYeo et al. (2014), and Lee (2015), document how the ROK government \ndeliberately targeted the development of ICT infrastructure in the \nlate 1990s. Even though broadband services were \ufb01rst launched in the \nROK only in 1998, by the early 2000s, the broadband penetration rate \nin the ROK was the highest in the world (Bae 2011). As a result, Oh and \nLarson (2011) noted: \u201cIn 1997 the ICT sector contributed only about \n12 percent to the nation\u2019s GDP growth. By 2003, that percentage had \nrisen to about 40 percent and it remained substantial through 2009.\u201d \nThe world-leading ICT infrastructure of the ROK likely contributes \nto the economy being ranked the most innovative in the world \n(Bloomberg 2015). \n\nA positive association between infrastructure and growth \n\nperformance in middle-income economies cannot be the basis for policy, \nas causality can run either way\u2014or both. The additional analysis in \nthis section moves in this direction by showing how exogenous shocks \nto public investment have signi\ufb01cant positive and persistent effects \non output, particularly in middle-income economies. This provides \nreassurance that at least part of the causality between infrastructure \nprovision and development runs from infrastructure to national \noutput and income. The slightly bigger and more sustained impact \nof infrastructure investment on output in middle-income economies \nindicates the potentially strong bene\ufb01ts of increased infrastructure \ninvestment in them. That said, further research is needed to determine \nthe precise relationship between infrastructure and economic growth. \nBetter data on ICT infrastructure investment, in particular, would help \nresearchers de\ufb01nitively identify the bene\ufb01ts of that particular type of \ninvestment.\n\n\f96\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nReaching toward high income\n\nDecades of rapid economic growth transformed developing Asia from \na low-income region to a middle-income region. The vast majority of \nthe population now lives in middle-income economies. The region \ncontinues to grow at a healthy pace, and its NIEs have reached high \nincome in record time. However, the experience of many middle-income \neconomies in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that graduation \nfrom middle income to high income can be challenging. Further, middle-\nincome economies are structurally different from low-income economies, \nand the transition from low to middle income differs in important ways \nfrom the transition from middle to high income. This is a good time to \ntake stock of the challenges facing the middle-income region as it seeks to \nbuild on its past success.\n\nAn examination of middle-income challenges reveals that while \nthe accumulation of physical and human capital continues to matter \na lot for sustaining healthy growth, productivity comes to the fore. \nTotal factor productivity (TFP), the growth in production not accounted \nfor by increased use of inputs, plays a bigger role in middle-income \neconomies\u2019 growth, particularly those successfully reaching high income. \nThe successful middle-income growth model emphasizes productivity \nand innovation. Innovation becomes more important after economies \nfully reap the bene\ufb01ts of using existing resources efficiently. Even in the \nfurther accumulation of physical and human capital, the focus shifts to \nareas with positive productivity spillover like advanced infrastructure \nand higher education. Finally, all of this must be underpinned by a \nsupportive policy environment and stable macroeconomy.\n\nStepping up innovation requires a skilled workforce capable of \ncreating new knowledge and technology. Middle-income economies \nshould increase human capital investment, which not only fuels growth \nbut also promotes equity. When building human capital, the focus \nshould be on educational quality to enhance cognitive skills, in particular \nscience and math capabilities, which enhances the chances of students \nbecoming innovators.\n\nAdvanced infrastructure is an important investment to foster \n\ninnovation and human capital accumulation. As middle-income economies \ndevelop, their infrastructure needs evolve from basic infrastructure to \nadvanced infrastructure. The combination of advanced infrastructure, \na skilled workforce, and innovation can help sustain productivity growth \nand pave the way for a steady transition to high income.\n\nSound policies and institutions\nSound policies and institutions will play a vital role in the broad \ntransition from middle to high income, as it did in Asia\u2019s transition \nfrom low to middle income. The role of the government will necessarily \nevolve as economies progress. The development of the private sector in \nparticular demands a more nuanced economic role for the government. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200297\n\nMore generally, the government must provide an environment conducive \nto innovative entrepreneurship by promoting investment in education \nand infrastructure. The quality of education and higher education \nin particular becomes more important as economies grow richer, as does \nadvanced infrastructure such as ICT. The experience of Asia\u2019s newly \nindustrialized economies highlights the role of innovation, human \ncapital, and infrastructure in sustaining TFP growth at middle income. \nIn terms of innovation, middle-income economies must prioritize \ninstitutions and policies that level the playing \ufb01eld for the new \ufb01rms \nthat play major roles in innovation. Strong intellectual property rights \nensure that new entrepreneurs can capitalize on commercially useful \nnew ideas, products, or technologies without fear of expropriation by \nlarge incumbent \ufb01rms or other parties. This gives them the con\ufb01dence \nto invest their time and effort in innovative activities. Access to \ufb01nance \non reasonable terms enables entrepreneurs to transform new ideas \ninto novel products and services. Effective competition laws, and \nmore broadly strong rule of law, limit the scope for large incumbents to \nabuse their market power toward hindering the entry and expansion of \ninnovative newcomers.\n\nWith respect to human capital, analysis indicates that, as an \neconomy converges on the global technology frontier, the quality of \neducation increasingly takes precedence over the quantity of education. \nEducation policy and reform should be geared toward producing \ntechnically competent workers who are capable of absorbing and using \nnew knowledge. Augmenting the pool of cognitive skills such as math \nand science is key to upgrading the workforce to one that is capable of \ncreating the new technology and knowledge that are the cornerstones \nof innovation-led growth. There is also a case for investing more in \nhigher education that features research, built on a solid foundation of \nbasic education.\n\nAnalysis also indicates that infrastructure investment will be \nno less important during developing Asia\u2019s transition from middle to \nhigh income than during its past success in moving up from low to \nmiddle income. The region should therefore continue to prioritize \ninvestment in infrastructure of all types, from roads to electricity. \nSince energy and advanced infrastructure such as ICT seem to be \nespecially important for the \ufb01nal transition, economies should expand \ninvestments in these areas as they approach high income.\n\n The case can be made for more direct government intervention in \na selective and targeted way to foster a more diverse and sophisticated \noutput mix, as shown in Peru\u2019s successful experience with industry\u2013\ngovernment coordination (Box 2.5.1). The case for intervention is \nstronger when the government has adequate institutional capacity, as \nBerglof and Cable (forthcoming) and Bruszt and Campos (forthcoming) \nemphasize. Within the region, Thailand\u2019s success in becoming Southeast \nAsia\u2019s hub for automobile manufacturing is revealing. Instead of trying \nto foster a national champion, Thai policy makers pursued a more \nnuanced, market-oriented strategy of attracting foreign auto \ufb01rms. \nExtensive dialogue between government and industry was vital to \nfostering a critical mass of local auto parts suppliers, an indispensable \npillar of any auto industry (Hill and Kohpaiboon 2017). \n\n\f98\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n2.5.1\u2002Product diversification through industry\u2013government coordination in Peru\n\nThe Peruvian government embarked in 2014 on a \ncoordinated industrial policy to facilitate the emergence \nof a more diversified economy with the aim of boosting \nPeru\u2019s growth exports and growth potential. Peru has \ncomparative advantages in natural resources, so activity \nnaturally concentrated in fishing, cotton, and mining, which \ntogether account for some 43% of exports. This left Peru\u2019s \neconomy exposed to exogenous shocks, as prices for these \ncommodities are volatile. \n\nThe government realized that productive diversification \n\ncould bring Peru closer to the world technology frontier. \nIn early 2014, the Ministry of Production started to \nintroduce measures to nurture productive diversification. \nProgress was made in three key areas: expanding across \nsectors the scope of such public goods as access to \naffordable finance, higher quality standards, and improved \ninfrastructure; providing ample public goods to selected \nsectors to boost their productivity; and subsidizing activities \nwith positive externalities such as R&D investment, training, \nand technology transfer. The set of industrial policies \nbuoyed innovation by identifying sectors with high growth \npotential, promoting coordination between stakeholders \nin the public and private spheres, facilitating access to \nfinancing, investing in training and tertiary education, and \nfostering technological transfer. \n\nImplementation targeted a few selected sectors with \n\ngreat economic potential, emphasizing an agile and \ninteractive approach. Sectorial working groups were created \nto help remove growth barriers in five industries: forestry, \naquaculture, textiles, food and beverages, and creative \nindustries. Public\u2013private coordination was introduced \nin the form of temporary public\u2013private executive boards \n\nthat seek to boost productivity by eliminating bottlenecks, \nwhether they were sector specific or affected multiple \nsector, such as logistics. These boards coordinate agents \nin the public and private sectors, combining their \nlimited expertise to assemble enough know-how to clear \nbottlenecks affecting their industries. \n\nThis practice helps identify promising economic sectors, \n\nlist relevant stakeholders, analyze the major challenges \nthey face, and provide possible solutions and action plans. \nForestry, for example, has great potential in terms of area \navailable for plantations, conditions for quick tree growth, \nand export prospects. Compared with Chile, whose forestry \nexports are worth $5.5 billion, Peru exports much less, only \n$150 million, but has potential to generate $10 billion in \nexports and create 1 million jobs\u2014and this with plantation \ntrees reaching maturity in half the time. To achieve this \npotential, the forestry board passed new legislation to foster \ninvestment in the sector and comply with environmental \nstandards. This dramatically reduced the time required \nto register privately owned land that was appropriate for \nplantations and to get extraction permits, shortening it to \na few days from what had been up to 12 months. Finance \nwas improved with adaptions appropriate for the sector, \nadjusting payment timing to align it with forestry business \ncash flows and not requiring firms to use their land \nas collateral because ill-defined property rights makes \nthis impossible. With these hurdles overcome, loans for \nforestry projects rose to stand today at $60 million. Such a \nsurgical approach effectively activates the potential of \nunderperforming sectors, achieving results rapidly at \nrelatively low cost. \n\nImportance of macroeconomic stability\nOne vital element of a growth-conducive environment is macroeconomic \nstability. Evidence has emerged since the global \ufb01nancial crisis of \n2008\u20132009 that growth in individual economies has become \nmore dependent on such global factors as global growth, oil prices, and \n\ufb01nancial volatility (Aizenman et al. forthcoming). This indicates that the \nregion may be more vulnerable to external shocks.\n\nEmpirical evidence indicates that when an economy reaches middle \nincome, its growth rate is more vulnerable to threats to macroeconomic \nstability\u2014such as whether a banking or currency crisis, large capital \nin\ufb02ows other than foreign direct investment, and high government debt \nrelative to GDP. Exploring the determinants of growth in a global dataset \nfrom 1960 to 2014, Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (forthcoming) con\ufb01rmed \nthe importance of a number of variables: initial income, years of schooling, \ninvestment share, demographic characteristics, infrastructure, \ufb01nancial \ndevelopment indicators, and governance. The study also included variables \nrelated to macroeconomic stability: \ufb02ows of foreign direct investment, \nthe occurrence of banking or currency crises, and government debt.\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u200299\n\nInterestingly, the study found that the economic factors associated \nwith per capita income growth do in fact differ between middle-income \nand other economies. The critical distinction is between low and middle \nincome. For example, in middle-income economies, the lending\u2013deposit \nrate spread matters less than in low-income economies. This suggests that \ninefficiencies in the \ufb01nancial system matter less in relation to other factors \nas economies move up the income scale. Similarly, the gender ratio is no \nlonger as important as before, suggesting the diminishing importance of \ndemographic determinants with graduation to middle-income status. \n\nSo what are the factors that come to the fore when an economy reaches \n\nmiddle income? The study found that growth in middle income is more \nvulnerable to those that affect macroeconomic stability. More speci\ufb01cally, \nin middle-income economies a banking or currency crisis can signi\ufb01cantly \nhinder growth, as can capital in\ufb02ows other than foreign direct investment \nand high government debt as a share of GDP. The region should therefore \nstay vigilant about protecting macroeconomic stability, as it has done \nin the past through sound \ufb01scal and monetary policies. The brief \nreversion of the ROK from high income to middle income during the \nAsian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998 serves as a stark reminder of the high \ncost of macroeconomic instability.\n\nThe evidence in this chapter indicates that sustaining rapid growth \n\nwill not be easy, but it is within the reach of middle-income Asia. \nMany factors that served the region well at low income, such as \nmacroeconomic stability and high investment, still serve it well at \nmiddle income. At the same time, the pattern of growth will have to \nevolve if Asia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high income. \nIn particular, innovation, human capital, and infrastructure will have to \nplay vital roles. The region\u2019s dynamic track record and the transition of the \nregion\u2019s most advanced economies provide some cause for optimism about \nsustaining rapid growth at middle income.\n\nLearning from regional success stories\nOne group of Asian economies that was able to shift from investment-led \ngrowth to innovation-based growth is the newly industrialized economies \n(NIEs): the ROK, Singapore, Taipei,China, and Hong Kong, China. \nThe output mix of these economies became more diverse and sophisticated \nas they graduated from middle to high income, having initially \nspecialized in labor-intensive products during the early stages of their \nindustrialization but gradually shifting to a wide range of products \nrequiring advanced skills and technology.\n\nIn 1960, Singapore and Hong Kong, China were both lower-middle \nincome, while the ROK and Taipei,China were both low income. From that \nyear, Hong Kong, China labored for 24 years and Singapore for nearly 30 \nyears in middle income before reaching high income. Taipei,China took \n27 years to transition from middle to high income, 10 years ranked as \nlower-middle income and 17 years as upper-middle income. For the ROK, \nthe road to high income spanned 23 years, including 10 years in lower-\nmiddle income and 13 years in upper-middle income. The record of the \nNIEs shows that innovation, human capital, and infrastructure all played \nvital roles in their remarkable transition from middle to high income. \n\n\f100\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n1990 and 2014\n\n1990\n2014\n\nRep. of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nPeople\u2019s Rep. of China\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nPhilippines\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPakistan\n\nJapan\n\nUnited States\n\nGermany\n\nInnovation and infrastructure spur technological development\nAn important factor that enabled NIEs to achieve high and steady \ngrowth is the innovation that drove their rapid technological progress. \nBoth the ROK and Taipei,China sustained productivity increases \nthrough local \ufb01rms\u2019 development of new technologies (Cherif and \nHasanov 2015, Ag\u00e9nor, Canuto, and Jelenic 2012). The drive toward \ninnovation was supported by strong protection of intellectual property \nrights. In 1990, or 5 years before the ROK graduated to high income, \nits number of patent applications was already comparable to that of \nGermany and the US (Figure 2.5.1). \n\nDirect government support played a key role in spurring \ninnovation among NIEs. In Taipei,China, the authorities had \na direct hand in creating innovative \ufb01rms. The government \nhelped foster close and long-term relationships between \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises and multinational \ncorporations, enabled public and quasi-public research \ninstitutes to spin off \ufb01rms and create new technologies, and \ninvested heavily to train engineers overseas. In the ROK, the \ngovernment pushed several conglomerates to enter several \nindustries simultaneously and export almost immediately \nto create global brands. State support included access to \ncredit that was conditional on explicit and quanti\ufb01able \nexport targets, pushing companies such as Hyundai to \naccelerate its R&D and technological upgrading (Cherif and \nHasanov 2015).\n\nIn addition to innovation, advanced infrastructure \nnetworks facilitated NIEs\u2019 rapid transition. Setting up high-\nspeed communications and broadband technology was \naided by the liberalization of telecommunication networks \nand regulatory reform. A strong drive toward global \ncompetitiveness in communication technology catalyzed \nin the ROK and Taipei,China the emergence of robust \nbroadband and multimedia industries in their own domestic \nmarkets. In Singapore and Hong Kong, China, advanced infrastructure \nnetworks supported their use as regional headquarters for large foreign \nmultimedia companies (Ag\u00e9nor, Canuto, and Jelenic 2012).\n\nHuman capital toward knowledge-based economies\nHuman capital accumulation facilitated innovation among NIEs and \nenabled them to transform into knowledge-based economies. Shifting to \na knowledge economy requires a development approach that emphasizes \nthe quality of education and includes R&D investments in science and \ntechnology. Figure 2.5.2 illustrates how NIEs in general have a stronger \nposition in research and knowledge creation than middle-income \neconomies. \n\nThe NIE experience shows that combining R&D and human \n\ncapital investments can shift an economy from investment-led growth \nto innovation-led growth, provided there is a sound institutional \nenvironment that provides incentives for the efficient use of knowledge. \n\n2.5.1\u2002 Patent applications in selected economies,  \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nPatent applications per 100 people\n\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators online database.  \nhttp://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx (accessed 4 October 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u2002101\n\n2.5.2\u2002 Knowledge production, selected Asian economies\n\nQuality of science and research institutions\n\nQuality of education systems\n\nHigh income\n(5.1)\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nTaipei,China\n\nBangladesh\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThailand\n\nHigh income\n(4.9)\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nTaipei,China\n\nBangladesh\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThailand\n\nMiddle income\n(3.8)\n\nMiddle income\n(4.0)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nIndex\n\nIndex\n\nNote: Figures in parentheses are averages.\nSources: World Economic Forum. 2012.

During the 1960s and 1970s, secondary \neducation was made universal, and vocational and technical schools \nwere established to meet skills demand from manufacturing industries. \nThe ROK also established science and technology institutes, adopting \nUS-style graduate education and research system. In the early 1980s, \nthe ROK further expanded tertiary education to prepare for the \ntransition into advanced industry. Alongside education reform, the \nROK strengthened R&D capacity to boost human capital. During the \ntransition to upper middle income, knowledge production in the ROK \nincreased tremendously, with the number of scienti\ufb01c and technical \njournal articles multiplying sixfold in the decade to 1994, from 424 \nto 2,931. \n\nIn the 1980s, the government encouraged the private sector to \n\nparticipate in R&D through incentives like tax subsidies. Even small and \nmedium-sized enterprises were actively involved in R&D, with some \nallocating as much as 10% of sales income to R&D. The transformation \nof the ROK into a knowledge-based economy enabled it to move toward \nthe production of high-technology goods. From 1988 to 1994, its ratio \nof high-technology exports to all manufactured exports increased from \n15.9% to 22.7%. This feat was achieved before the ROK graduated to \nhigh income in the mid-1990s.\n\n\f2.5.3\u2002 Infrastructure provision in newly industrialized economies\n\nA. Telephone mainlines\n\nB.

The NIEs invested more \nin basic infrastructure than did other middle-income economies \n(Figure 2.5.3). The NIEs had 3 times as many telephone mainlines \nper 100 people than other middle-income economies, for example, and \n40% more electricity generating capacity per capita. Signi\ufb01cantly, the \nNIEs\u2019 provision of basic infrastructure was already virtually universal \neven when they were middle income. By contrast, today in other \nmiddle-income economies, almost a quarter of the population still lacks \nbasic sanitation.\n\nBehind this higher rate of infrastructure provision lay higher \ninfrastructure investment rates. Public investment in the NIEs when \nthey were middle income was substantially higher, equaling nearly 8% of \nGDP, than in their peers, at 4% of GDP. Public investment was probably \nmore efficient in these economies as well. In the ROK, infrastructure \ninvestment was an explicit priority beginning with the First Five-Year \nPlan, 1962\u20131966, and infrastructure was geared toward developing \nthe ROK as an export-oriented economy. New power plants were built \nto supply electricity for manufacturing, and new expressways and \nexpanded ports provided good logistics at low cost. \n\nClearing the \ufb01nal hurdle\nHaving been transformed from a low-income region to a middle-income \nregion quickly, developing Asia now faces the \ufb01nal transition, from \nmiddle to high income. Just as the transition from low to middle income \nrequired rapid growth sustained over decades, the transition from \nmiddle to high income will also require that rapid growth is sustained. \nSustaining rapid growth will not be easy but is within the reach of \nmiddle-income Asia. Many factors that served the region well at \nlow income, such as macroeconomic stability and high investment, \nwill serve it well at middle income. Some key ingredients of economic \ngrowth will persist.\n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u2002103\n\nAt the same time, the pattern of growth will have to evolve if \nAsia is to sustain rapid growth and eventually reach high income. \nThe structures of middle-income economies are different from those \nof low-income economies\u2014with, for example, higher stocks of human \nand physical capital\u2014so it is only natural that the contours of growth \nwill be somewhat different. In particular, the analysis indicates that \nproductivity growth will have to play a larger role in the transition. \nProductivity growth rests in turn on the three pillars of innovation, \nhuman capital, and infrastructure. Therefore, the central mandate of \nAsian policy makers must be to foster more innovative economies by \nstrengthening education and investing in infrastructure.\n\nThe region\u2019s dynamic track record gives cause for optimism that \nthe authorities can adapt their growth models to overcome the middle-\nincome challenge. While completing the journey to high income is far \nfrom guaranteed, there is every reason to believe that good institutions \nand policies can lift developing Asia to high income.\n\nEndnotes\n1 \n\nBangladesh; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; \nIndia; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Nepal; Pakistan; \nthe Philippines; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; and Thailand.\nThe shares are based on 219 economies, of which 218 are from the \nWorld Bank database. Data on one economy, the Cook Islands, come \nfrom the Asian Development Outlook database.\nCapital per capita is calculated for each economy for 2014 based on \nthe PWT 9.0 database, which divides capital stock at current PPP by \npopulation size. \nFor economies that do not report labor hours, it is assumed that \naverage labor hours change the same way as in the US over the \nperiod.\nSee Eichengreen, Park and Shin (forthcoming) for results for other \nsubgroups, such as high-income economies that remain high income.\nAn economy exports a product with revealed comparative advantage \nif the share of the product in its total exports is larger than the share \nof the product on the world market.\nFelipe et al. (2012) documented that, by category, the most complex \nproducts are machinery, chemicals, and metals, while the least \ncomplex products are raw materials and commodities, wood, \ntextiles, and agricultural products.\nOver the longer term, however, older populations will place \nsignificant strain on finances in Asia, not only in countries with \nespecially generous public support systems for the elderly but also \nin those that rely heavily on labor income taxes to finance public \nconsumption.\nThe study of Abrigo, Lee, and Park (forthcoming) has quantitative \nestimates of the fiscal impact of different public investments in \nhuman capital in the 12 economies in developing Asia.\n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n\f104\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n10  This analysis leaves for a future study a deeper probe into how \n\n11 \n\neffectively productivity is boosted by human capital spending growth \nfrom the government versus from the private sector.\nThese were the Programme for International Student Assessment \nand the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.\n12  This section is based on material contributed by Christos Sakellariou.\nLargely credited to George Psacharopoulos. For a recent update, \n13 \nsee Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) and Montenegro and \nPatrinos (2014).\n\n14  Because of congestion, pollution, and other problems associated \n\nwith the urbanization that occurs in the middle-income phase, \ncertain urban infrastructure also becomes more important for \nmiddle-income economies. However, lack of comprehensive data \nacross economies on urban infrastructure such as mass transit \nprevents further analysis here.\n\n15  The complete list of data sources used in this section can be found in \nAbiad, Debuque-Gonzales, and Sy (forthcoming). The sample period \nof the data starts in 1960 but is subject to data availability.\n16  Data on public investment is from the Investment and Capital \n\nStock Dataset of the International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs \nDepartment, and private infrastructure investment is from the \nWorld Bank Private Provision in Infrastructure Database. In the \nabsence of more direct measures, public investment often proxies \nfor government infrastructure spending. Public investment can \ninclude investment in non-infrastructure items such as machinery \nand equipment, inventories, valuables, and land. More disaggregated \ndata on public infrastructure investment is available only for OECD \neconomies. The Private Provision of Infrastructure Database covers \ninfrastructure investment by firms at least 20% privately owned.\nFormal tests of differences in coefficients support these conclusions.\n\n17 \n18  To save space, only the table for the middle-income subsample is \n\npresented. \n\n19  This identification strategy is very similar to the structure embedded \nin fiscal policy vector autoregressions. The fiscal policy rule links \nthe change in government spending to its lags, lagged growth, \ncurrent and lagged public indebtedness, and expectations of growth \nnext year. \n\n\fTranscending the middle-income challenge\u2002\u2002105\n\nBackground papers\nAbiad, A., M.

With demand likely to remain weak and no room \nfor fiscal stimulus, projections for 2017 and 2018 are for modest growth, low inflation, and further \nbalancing in the current account. Policy should promote export-oriented industries and innovation. \n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy grew by a mere 0.2% in 2016 following growth at 3.0% \nin the previous year. On the supply side, declines in agriculture and \nconstruction were the main causes for the slowdown, while services \nand industry excluding construction expanded (Figure 3.1.1). \n\nBad weather caused agriculture to contract by 5.8% in 2016, \n\nreversing double-digit growth in 2015. Industry excluding construction \nexpanded by 5.1%, mainly on higher output in mining and in food, \nbeverages, and tobacco. Construction contracted by 11.3%, recording \na fourth consecutive year of decline as organizations and households \ncontinued to pull back. Services, which account for more than half \nof GDP, contributed the most to growth, expanding by 4.0% after no \ngrowth in 2015. Much of the expansion was in recreation, transport, \n\ufb01nance, and insurance. \n\nOn the demand side, growth came mainly from a modest rise in \ntotal consumption and a halving of the de\ufb01cit in net exports of goods \nand services to an estimated 6.0% of GDP in 2016 from 12.2% a year \nearlier. Growth in private consumption was a lackluster 0.3%, re\ufb02ecting \nweak household spending, though public consumption grew by an \nestimated 6.0% as expansionary \ufb01scal policy aimed to stimulate the \neconomy. Gross \ufb01xed capital formation contracted by 6.2% because of \nsluggish public and private investment. \n\nMonetary policy was accommodative throughout the year. \n\nConsidering weakened growth prospects and a de\ufb02ationary \nenvironment, the Central Bank of Armenia gradually relaxed its \npolicy rate from 8.75% in December 2015 to 6.00% in February 2017. \nDespite this monetary easing, weak aggregate demand and lower \ncommodity prices caused consumer prices to decline.

As tax revenue declined \nby 4.4%, total budget revenue fell 2.6% short of its target, slipping \nto the equivalent of 22.8% of GDP from 23.2% in 2015, while budget \nexpenditure was below the planned amount by 3.7%, equal to 28.2% \nof GDP. \n\nThe higher budget de\ufb01cit pushed public debt to 56.7% of GDP at the \nend of 2016 from 48.8% a year earlier. External public debt increased to \n45.9% of GDP from 41.5% in 2015, while domestic debt rose to 10.9%, up \nby 3.5 percentage points (Figure 3.1.4). The ratio of public debt to the \nprevious year\u2019s GDP stood at 57.1% at the end of 2016, breaching the 50% \nceiling in the Public Debt Law for the \ufb01rst time. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed marginally to an estimated \n2.6% of GDP in 2016 from 2.7% in 2015 (Figure 3.1.5). Rising exports and \ndeclining imports that re\ufb02ected weak domestic demand reduced the \ntrade de\ufb01cit to an estimated 8.8% of GDP in 2016 from 11.3% in 2015. \nAn expanding de\ufb01cit in investment income and further shrinkage of \nsurpluses in personal transfers and employee compensation from abroad \nwere the main reasons why the overall income surplus narrowed. \nRemittances, measured as net in\ufb02ow of private noncommercial transfers \nthrough banks, declined by 17.8% to $716 million in 2016, the third \nconsecutive year of contraction (Figure 3.1.6).\n\nHigher government borrowing helped keep international reserves at \nacceptable levels. Gross international reserves at the end of 2016 stood at \n$2.2 billion, equal to 6.2 months of estimated imports (Figure 3.1.7). \n\nStrong export performance and large in\ufb02ows of foreign \ufb01nancing \n\ncaused the Armenian dram to appreciate in nominal effective terms \nagainst a basket of major currencies by 3.1% month on month in \nDecember 2016. Meanwhile, domestic de\ufb02ation and in\ufb02ation in \nArmenia\u2019s main trading partners caused the dram to depreciate in real \neffective terms by 0.5%. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is projected at 2.2% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018 (Figure 3.1.8). \nExternal risks to the forecast arise mainly from developments in the \nRussian Federation, with which Armenia has strong economic links. \nThe forecast assumes some recovery there and a resulting rebound \nin remittances. Domestic risks to the economic outlook re\ufb02ect low \n\ufb01scal and external buffers and subdued investor enthusiasm ahead \nof parliamentary elections due in April 2017. On the positive side, \ntariff reductions in early 2017 for gas and electricity\u2014with especially \nsteep decreases for certain vulnerable households and, regarding gas, \nfor food processing \ufb01rms and greenhouses\u2014should support growth. \nThe expected rise in demand could, however, spur in\ufb02ation. \n\nOn the supply side, all sectors are seen growing moderately in 2017 \n\nand 2018. Industry excluding construction is projected to expand by \n6.2% and somewhat more in 2018, again mainly on expansion in mining \nand in food, beverages, and tobacco.

However, construction is projected to contract by a further 6.4% \nin 2017 in view of a signi\ufb01cant decline in capital spending in the \n2017 state budget and slackening construction funded by remittances. \nThe rate of contraction will likely moderate again in 2018. \n\nWith normal weather, agriculture is projected to recover by 8.6% \nin 2017 and possibly more in 2018. Additional support could come from \nthe government\u2019s efforts to foster the construction and expansion \nof greenhouses, through the favorable gas prices for greenhouses \nbeginning this year. Services are expected to grow by only 2.4% in 2017 \nand slightly more in 2018, constrained by sluggishness in remittance-\nsupported trade. \n\nOn the demand side, the main drivers of growth will probably be \nfurther narrowing of the de\ufb01cit in net exports of goods and services \n(though less than in 2016) and a slight rebound in private consumption. \nMonetary policy is likely to remain accommodative. With moderate \n\noutput growth, weak domestic demand, and only modest in\ufb02ationary \npressures expected from abroad, average annual in\ufb02ation is projected \nto turn positive but remain low at 1.2% in 2017 before edging up to 1.8% \nin 2018.\n\nSigni\ufb01cant and sustained \ufb01scal consolidation will be crucial over the \n\nmedium term. To reduce debt-related vulnerability and contain \ufb01scal \nrisk, the 2017 budget envisages halving the budget de\ufb01cit to 2.8% of GDP \nin 2017, mainly through cuts in capital spending and measures to contain \npublic wages and pensions. The adoption of a new tax code in 2016, its \nprovisions to be introduced gradually during 2017\u20132021, should facilitate \n\ufb01scal consolidation by strengthening tax administration and broadening \nthe tax base.\n\nProvided the decline in income and transfers abates, the current \n\naccount de\ufb01cit is projected to narrow further to 2.3% in 2017 and \n2.0% in 2018 as domestic demand remains sluggish and exports of \ngoods and services outpace imports (Figure 3.1.9). To attract foreign \ndirect investment, the government has undertaken several initiatives. \nThese include establishing a strategic initiatives center, introducing \na single platform for investment proposals, and revising business \nregulation. The successful implementation of these measures should \nraise inward foreign direct investment, thereby helping to strengthen \nthe current account.\n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit is expected to narrow further. Exports are forecast \n\nto expand by 6.5% in 2017 and a further 5.0% in 2018, underpinned by \nrising exports of agricultural products, nonferrous metals, and precious \nstones and metals. Constrained by only moderate recovery in domestic \ndemand, imports are projected to grow modestly by 2.5% in both 2017 \nand 2018.

Despite a marked \nnarrowing of the trade de\ufb01cit, exports remain a small share of GDP, \nestimated at 17% in 2016, and highly concentrated in terms of both \ncontent and destination. \n\nThe government\u2019s strategy to pursue export-led industrial \ndevelopment, approved in 2011, targets 11 subsectors with export \npotential. It has played an important role in setting long-term \nobjectives and framing dialogue between the public and private sectors. \nThe strategy has triggered some dynamism in manufacturing, though \nmuch of the progress has been in high-input food processing, rather \nthan in precision engineering, textiles, footwear, or other areas able to \ncapitalize on skills and innovation. \n\ncould catalyze export diversi\ufb01cation by fostering innovation. \nThe government\u2019s initiative to collect business proposals on a single \nplatform for presentation to investors is a way to mobilize much-needed \nresources for the structural transformation of the economy. The many \nproposals collected from private \ufb01rms and local communities across \nthe country are expected to be \ufb01nanced from various sources including \nthe state budget, local community budgets, and the private sector. \nEven partial implementation of these investments would help channel \nknow-how and innovation into production processes, expand the variety \nof exports, and add value to existing products\u2014ultimately creating new, \nhighly productive jobs. \n\nThe other initiatives under way include, as mentioned above, \nthe further improvement of institutional and regulatory frameworks \nfor export promotion, introduction of new instruments for export \npromotion and export insurance, establishment of the joint investment \nfund with the Russian Federation, and creation of the free-trade zone on \nthe Iranian border.\n\nSupport for innovation and technology is another way to transform \nArmenia into a knowledge-based economy and add value to production. \nDuring the past decade, effective public\u2013private collaboration has \nbrought sustained growth in information technology. The creation of \ntechnology parks and incubators, after-school learning centers, and \nengineering laboratories in pilot schools has, along with the entry of \ninternational companies, signi\ufb01cantly improved educational resources \nfor specialist training. Armenia can boost its total factor productivity \nand enhance economic growth by scaling up these existing initiatives \nand orienting them toward industries that produce technologically \nsophisticated products, thereby leveraging its competitive advantage \nin highly skilled and low-cost labor in such \ufb01elds as engineering and \ncomputer science. \n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nContinued weak oil prices helped cause GDP to contract by 3.8% in 2016 and the current account \nto  fall  into  deficit.  Meanwhile,  inflation  accelerated  to  12.4%.  GDP  is  forecast  to  decline  by  a \nfurther  1.1%  in  2017  and  then  recover  by  1.2%  in  2018,  and  higher  oil  prices  should  return  the \ncurrent  account  to  surplus.  Combatting  unemployment  is  a  major  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP contracted by 3.8% last year following 1.1% growth in 2015 \n(Figure 3.2.1). The decline re\ufb02ected weak oil prices and lower oil \nproduction, but also a falloff in domestic demand, including less public \ninvestment, that caused the economy outside of the large oil sector to \nshrink by 5.4%. \n\nOn the supply side, industry contracted by 7.1%, much more than the \n\n1.9% decline in 2015, mainly because construction plummeted by 27.6% \nas the government slashed public investment in response to plunging \nrevenues. Manufacturing declined by 1.4%, reversing 7.7% growth in \n2015 as the production of construction materials fell by 10.6% and of \npetrochemicals by 9.1%. Oil output edged down by 1.3% in 2016, but gas \nextraction rose by the same percentage, albeit from a much smaller base. \nSlowing transport and \ufb01nancial services caused services to contract by \n0.7% after a 4.5% increase in 2015. Meanwhile, agriculture expanded \nby 2.6% on growth at 2.8% in livestock and 2.5% in key crops, though \nmanaging less than half of the 6.6% pace achieved in 2015.\n\nOn the demand side, growth in consumption slowed with \n\ndepreciation of the Azerbaijan manat and reduced consumer lending. \nNet exports fell by more than 50%, following a 72% decline in 2015, \nas lower hydrocarbon output reduced export volume. \n\nThe in\ufb02ation rate tripled to 12.4% from 4.0% in 2015 as the impact \nof currency depreciation in 2015 lingered (Figure 3.2.2). Prices for food \nrose by 14.7%, other goods by 16.7%, and services by 5.8%. \n\nFiscal policy tightened in 2016 as the state budget de\ufb01cit narrowed \n\nto the equivalent of 0.4% of GDP from 1.2% in 2015. Revenue equaled \n29.2%, down from 31.5% in 2015, as transfers from the sovereign \nwealth fund were reduced by 6.3% to conserve assets and lessen the \nbudget\u2019s dependence on oil income. In February 2016, the authorities \nrevised the budget, cutting expenditure to ensure long-term \ufb01scal \nsustainability. Outlays fell to 29.6% of GDP from 32.7% in 2015 as \nlower capital spending offset a sharp rise in interest payments due to \nearlier devaluations and 10% increases for public wages, pensions, and \nsocial protection. Public and publicly guaranteed debt rose to equal \n20.4% of GDP at the end of 2016 from 19.8% a year earlier. \n\nThis chapter was written by Nail Valiyev of the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, ADB, Baku, \nand Dominik Peschel of the Central and West Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.2.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n% change, year on year \n\n2.2\n\n5.8\n\n2.8\n\n1.1\n\n\u20133.8\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.2\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nOther goods\nServices\n\n% change, year on year \n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\u20136\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\nDec\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSources: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan; Haver Analytics (accessed 13 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f120\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nMonetary and \ufb01nancial policy in 2016 aimed to limit in\ufb02ation \nand restructure the banking system in the wake of steep currency \ndepreciation in 2015. In response to high in\ufb02ation, the central bank \nraised the policy interest rate in four steps to 15.0% in September 2016 \nfrom 3.0% in September 2015. Broad money shrank by 4.9%, four \ntimes the 1.1% contraction in 2015 (Figure 3.2.3), and central bank \ninternational reserves declined by 20.8% (Figure 3.2.4). Moreover, \ndeposits fell by 10.0%, contributing to a 19.6% falloff in loans to \nborrowers outside of the government. After the central bank adopted \na \ufb02oating exchange rate at the end of 2015, the manat depreciated by a \nfurther 12.0% against the US dollar in 2016, aggravating balance sheet \nand liquidity risks (Figure 3.2.5). To restore con\ufb01dence in the local \ncurrency, the authorities provided in March 2016 full deposit insurance \nthat guarantees repayment of local currency deposits at an interest \nrate of 15%, versus 3% for foreign currency deposits. Dollarization \nnevertheless remained high with 75.2% of deposits in foreign currency \nat the end of 2016, albeit down from 81.6% a year earlier. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit widened to an estimated 2.1% of GDP \nin 2016, from a de\ufb01cit of 0.4% in 2015. Lower oil prices and output cut \nexports by a further 15.8% on top of the 44.8% decline a year earlier. \nImports declined by 12.7%, reversing a 4.7% pickup a year earlier, \nmainly because of lower imports of cars, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals. \nThe services de\ufb01cit narrowed by 28.4% as receipts from tourism \nimproved by 22.8% and imports of construction services declined.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP is projected to contract by 1.1% in 2017 with a further decline in \noil production. Tightened \ufb01scal policy will limit public investment. \nHowever, GDP is forecast to turn up by 1.2% in 2018 with the onset of \nproduction from the Shah Deniz gas \ufb01eld and some recovery anticipated \namong private \ufb01rms (Figure 3.2.6). \n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to contract by 0.5% in 2017 \n\nas oil production, which accounts for 65% of total industry, declines \nfurther. However, gas condensate from new Shah Deniz gas \ufb01eld \nwill help industry expand by 1.0% in 2018. Construction is projected \nto fall by a further 10.0% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting planned cuts in public \ninvestment, and then expand by 1.0% in 2018 as the economy recovers \nand the government accelerates the implementation of its social housing \nprogram. Government efforts to stimulate non-oil exports, in particular \nthrough its Made in Azerbaijan promotion, should catalyze growth in \nagriculture at 3.0% in 2017 and 4.0% in 2018. Services are projected to \nshow little change in 2017 as retail trade and transportation decline, \nthen expand by 1.0% in 2018 as transportation recovers and tourism \nimproves. \n\ncontract in 2017 in response to higher in\ufb02ation and remain subdued \nin 2018.

Public and publicly guaranteed \ndebt is expected to increase in 2017 and 2018 to allow the government \nto complete the expansion of the Shah Deniz gas \ufb01eld and to improve \nagriculture.\n\nMonetary policy will likely focus on curbing in\ufb02ation. As the \ncentral bank continues to tighten policy, private credit growth will \nslow. In addition, growing demand for foreign currency may further \nweaken the manat unless the central bank intervenes. Dollarization \nin banking will remain high, limiting liquidity in the local currency. \nManat depreciation will crimp borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity, possibly \npushing the share of nonperforming loans above 10%. The combined \nimpact of continued currency depreciation, tightened monetary policy, \nand a stagnant private sector is expected to create serious risks for \ndomestic banks.\n\nThe current account balance is forecast to record surpluses equal \n\nto 5.9% of GDP in 2017 and 11.4% in 2018 as the trade surplus in goods \nwidens and the services de\ufb01cit narrows (Figure 3.2.9). Total exports \nare projected to grow by 22.6% in 2017 with the projected improvement \nin oil prices and expand by a further 15.0% in 2018 as the Shah Deniz \ngas \ufb01eld starts producing. Imports are expected to contract by 6.2% \nin 2017 because of further manat depreciation and a temporary ban on \ngovernment imports, then expand by 12.5% in 2018 as the ban is lifted. \nThe services de\ufb01cit is forecast to expand by 15.6% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting \npayment for construction, and then narrow by 20.0% in 2018 on gains \nfrom transportation and tourism. Remittances, an important source of \nincome for the rural population, are forecast to rise in 2017 and 2018 \nas the Russian Federation recovers. Gross reserves including assets in \nthe sovereign wealth fund are projected at $30.1 billion in 2017 and \n$31.5 billion in 2018. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reducing unemployment\nRecession has weakened Azerbaijan\u2019s labor market. As lower turnover \ncaused many state and private enterprises to lay off workers, the \nnumber of unemployed rose by 2.5% in 2015 and 14.5% in 2016, after \nfalling by an average of 2.0% annually from 2010 to 2014 (Figure 3.2.10). \n\ncrude oil price\n\nAverage spot price crude\n\nManat/$\n\n% change, year on year \n\nManat/$\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n120\n\n60\n\n0\n\n\u201360\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: An increase in the exchange rate indicates a \ndepreciation.\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nHaver Analytics (accessed 13 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.7\u2002Annual inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f122\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nMore fundamentally, joblessness re\ufb02ects low labor productivity and a \nshortage of marketable skills. Currently, agriculture employs 36.3% of \nworkers to produce only 6.2% of GDP, while industry employs only 6.9% \nof workers to produce 47.0% of GDP. \n\nTo date, the government has relied mainly on regional \nsocioeconomic development programs to combat joblessness. \nThese programs helped cut the unemployment rate from 7.2% in 2005 \nto 4.9% in 2014, though many of the jobs created were temporary. \nThe unemployment rate subsequently rose to 5.6% at the end of 2016. \nTo ease the impact of the recession and minimize social discontent, \nthe government took further measures in 2016 to promote employment \nand hired 35,000 workers on a temporary basis. In addition, to address \nshortages in technical quali\ufb01cations and gaps in professional retraining, \nit established an agency to coordinate technical and vocational \neducation. To support rural employment, a new project was launched \nto help family \ufb01rms produce goods and deliver them to markets. \nIn addition, a social housing program was launched with the goal of \ncreating 10,000 jobs by 2020. To strengthen agriculture and agro-\nprocessing, farmers were given 179,000 hectares of arable land for \nadditional cotton, hazelnut, and tea production, which should provide \nmore rural jobs and limit migration to urban areas. Through the \nNational Entrepreneurship Support Fund, the state budget provided \n$100 million to expand small and medium-sized enterprises and create \nan additional 12,600 jobs. In December 2016, the government adopted a \nroadmap program that prioritizes 11 sectors, emphasizes the provision \nof sustainable employment, and sets an ambitious goal of creating \n450,000 jobs by 2025.\n\nTo augment these measures, the authorities should pay more \n\nattention to job promotion for younger workers, as the youth \nunemployment rate has risen especially rapidly. They could consider \nadditional measures to better link vocational education with the \nlabor market, develop the job skills needed to raise productivity in \nthe private sector, provide small and medium-sized enterprises with \nmore affordable \ufb01nancing, and open centers to provide agricultural \nsupport services. The privatization of inactive state-owned enterprises \nshould reactivate them and create jobs.\n\n3.2.8\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.9\u2002Annual current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.2.10\u2002Growth in total unemployment\n\n% change, year on year \n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fGeorgia \n\nExternal factors held growth at 2.7% in 2016, but higher capital spending and corporate tax reform \nshould permit growth to reach 3.8% in 2017 and 4.5% in 2018. Inflation, low in 2016, will likely rise \nto  4.2%  in  2017  under  currency  depreciation  and  an  excise  tax  increase.  Skills  mismatch  in  the \nlabor  market  is  an  important  constraint  on  long-term  growth. \n\nEconomic performance \nContinued shocks from trade partners limited growth in 2016 to \nan estimated 2.7% despite \ufb01scal stimulus. On the supply side, 8.0% \nexpansion in construction and 4.8% in manufacturing drove growth \nin industry as increases of 9.9% in tourism and 9.2% in \ufb01nance lifted \nservices (Figure 3.3.1). On the expenditure side, growth came mainly \nfrom a 17.1% surge in consumption, led by the government, and a 3.5% \nrise in investment, notably in public infrastructure to promote trade \nand tourism.\n\nIn\ufb02ation averaged 2.1% in 2016, driven by 13.1% higher prices for such \n\nexcisable goods as tobacco and alcoholic beverages, though low import \nprices limited overall in\ufb02ation (Figure 3.3.2). Lower fuel costs kept the \nrise in transport prices to 2.2%. However, in anticipation of an increase \nin the fuel tax effective on 1 January 2017, fuel prices started rising \nin December 2016, and in January 2017 monthly in\ufb02ation reached its \nhighest rate since the end of 2015. Despite pressure on the Georgian lari, \nthe National Bank of Georgia, the central bank, cut the policy interest \nrate gradually from 8.0% at the end of 2015 to 6.5% in September 2016 \nbefore restoring it to 6.8% in early 2017 in response to rising in\ufb02ation \nexpectations (Figure 3.3.3). The average interest rate on loans fell in 2016 \nby 1.6 percentage points to 12.7%, and for deposits by 0.8 points to 4.5%, \nas the central bank pursued a more accommodative monetary policy.\n\nCurrency in circulation grew by 19.8%, following near-zero growth \n\nin 2015, to contribute to a 20.2% rise in broad money, which pressed \ndown on the lari but helped lift in\ufb02ation toward the central bank\u2019s \n2016 target of 5.0%. Beginning in October, credit growth accelerated to \n22.3% from 19.4% in 2015 (Figure 3.3.4). Nonperforming loans remained \nmodest at less than 4%, and bank pro\ufb01ts rose by 26.4%. Meanwhile, \nthe percentage of deposits in foreign currency climbed by 2 percentage \npoints to 70%, well above the 57% prevailing in October 2014, before the \nstart of signi\ufb01cant currency depreciation. \n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit rose to 4.5% of GDP in 2016 from 3.8% in 2015 \n(Figure 3.3.5) with a planned large increase in expenditure, though tax \ncollections and total revenue exceeded targets.

Exports of goods fell by about 4.0%, \nmainly because of lower prices. Imports excluding medication \ufb01nanced \nby grants decreased by about 1.0%, re\ufb02ecting a weaker lari and lower \noil prices. Remittances rose by 6.6%, as higher in\ufb02ows from Europe and \nthe United States\u2014up by 11.2% from Italy, 5.8% from Greece, and 27.6% \nfrom the US\u2014countered an 8.8% decline from the Russian Federation. \nForeign direct investment (FDI) rose by 5.2% in 2016, with a signi\ufb01cant \nrise in reinvested FDI, from 9.3% in 2015 to 31.6% in 2016, going mostly \nto construction, energy, manufacturing, and especially transport and \ncommunication to supply an expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline. \nThe lari depreciated in 2016 by 10.5% against the US dollar and 7.2% \n\nagainst the euro (Figure 3.3.6). The depreciation re\ufb02ected Georgia\u2019s large \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit and the out\ufb02ow of foreign exchange to pay for \nimports. Meanwhile, the lari strengthened in nominal terms against the \ncurrencies of some key trading partners, notably Turkey and Azerbaijan, \nthough the real exchange rate was stable, preserving Georgia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. Central bank net sales of foreign exchange were about \nzero as foreign exchange sales in the second half of the year offset \npurchases in the \ufb01rst half. Gross international reserves at the end of the \nyear amounted to $2.8 billion, or cover for 2.9 months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects \nIncreased capital outlays are expected to push growth to 3.8% in 2017 \nand 4.5% in 2018, when the impact of infrastructure spending is expected \nto be greatest (Figure 3.3.7). Higher domestic consumption and a modest \nrecovery in exports will contribute to growth and employment in 2017. \nThe government estimates that corporate tax reform could add as much \nas 1.5 percentage points to growth in the next 2 years, especially in 2017 \nbut also in 2018, by encouraging higher private investment (Box 3.3.1). \nTwo pacts with European countries\u2014the Deep and Comprehensive \nFree Trade Area and the European Free Trade Association\u2014and the \nexpected rati\ufb01cation by mid-2017 of a free trade agreement with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China should expand Georgia\u2019s access to markets \nengaged in a third of world trade, thereby bolstering its export potential \nalong established routes.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to reach 4.2% in 2017 and 4.5% in 2018 \n\n(Figure 3.3.8). Higher oil prices, currency depreciation, and heightened \nin\ufb02ationary expectations will kindle in\ufb02ation on the supply side. \nMoreover, a higher fuel excise tax from January 2017 is projected to \nadd some 0.8 percentage points to the in\ufb02ation this year, and higher \nin\ufb02ation will render a lower policy interest rate unlikely before \nnext year. Monetary policy is expected to move toward a more neutral \nstance in 2018, once the effect of the fuel excise increase on prices has \ndissipated and the central bank has moved to increase lending in lari. \n\n3.3.3\u2002Interest rates\n\nPolicy\nDeposit\nLending\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.4\u2002 Contributions to  \n\nM3 broad money growth\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet claims on government\nCredit to the economy\nNet other items\nBroad money (M3) growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.5\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nNontax revenue and grants\nTax revenue\nTotal expenditure\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund. www.imf.org;  \nMinistry of Finance of Georgia. www.mof.ge \n(both accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nGeorgia\u2002\u2002125\n\n3.3.1\u2002 Reforms implemented since late 2016\n\n3.3.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nThe new government that took office following the October 2016 \nparliamentary elections has introduced wide-ranging reforms.

Broad money (M3) is \nexpected to grow by 15% in 2017 and 19% in 2018.\n\nOn the \ufb01scal side, the introduction of an Estonian-type corporate \n\nincome tax is projected to reduce revenue by the equivalent of 1.5% \nof GDP a year in 2017 and 2018. To compensate for the revenue \nloss, excise taxes on fuel, tobacco, and automobiles were raised on \n1 January 2017, current spending was trimmed, and one-time measures \nwere implemented, such as collecting certain taxes earlier. With these \noffsets, revenue is projected to equal 29.7% of GDP in 2017 and 29.1% in \n2018. Although capital spending is set to increase by 24.5% because of \nnew infrastructure projects, the government aims to reduce the budget \nde\ufb01cit to 4.1% of GDP in 2017 and 4.0% in 2018. Achieving this will \nrequire every component of the government strategy to work as intended, \nwith expenditure kept to 33.8% of GDP in 2017 and 33.1% in 2018. \nThe de\ufb01cit could prove higher if other elements of the program are \nnot achieved, or if growth turns out slower than envisaged. Because of \ndepreciation, the ratio of public debt to GDP is projected to reach 44.0% \nin 2017 and 2018, with some shift to a higher share of domestic debt \n(Figure 3.3.9).\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is projected to narrow to 12.0% of \n\nGDP in 2017 and 11.5% in 2018, to be \ufb01nanced mainly through FDI \n(Figure 3.3.10). Exports of goods and services are expected to rise by \n8.9% in 2017 and 9.8% in 2018 on higher service exports. Imports of \ngoods and services are forecast to grow by 4.8% and then 5.8% with \nhigher service imports in particular and modest rises in energy prices. \nRemittances are also expected to increase slightly by 4.2% in 2017 and \n4.8% in 2018.\n\nThe main risks to growth are continuing sluggishness in external \ndemand and further lari depreciation. Continued regional instability \nand weak economic activity in Georgia\u2019s key trading partners would \nhurt exports, remittances, and GDP growth. The ambitious nature \nof government plans creates a downside risk that some of its goals \nmay not all be achieved, notably the anticipated rise in private \ninvestment in response to the Estonian-type corporate income tax. \nHowever, prudent monetary and \ufb01scal policies should support economic \ngrowth while fostering more lending, investment, and consumption. \nStronger FDI and other foreign in\ufb02ows could boost business con\ufb01dence \nand augment growth.\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f126\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014addressing the mismatch \nin labor supply and demand \nDespite wide-ranging reforms undertaken by the recently installed \ngovernment, important challenges remain. One is a shortage of well-\ntrained labor, even as growth occurs mainly in skills-intensive services \nrather than in manufacturing (Figure 3.3.11). The mismatch between \nlabor demand and labor supply limits productivity while raising \nbusiness costs. Addressing the mismatch would help Georgia diversify \nits economy away from low-yield subsistence activities by enabling the \nreallocation of labor to more productive enterprise.\n\nThe government has taken a number of steps to address this \nchallenge, in particular by reforming vocational education. In 2013, it \nadopted a vocational education strategy for 2013\u20132020 along with an \naction plan for 2013\u20132017 to implement it. Reform aims to improve the \nability of stakeholders to develop and carry out vocational education, \nthereby ensuring the quality of vocational education programs and their \nrelevance to labor market requirements. The plan focuses on quality \nassurance and occupational standards to meet the changing needs of \nemployers and includes a counselling system to support students in \ntransition to employment. It enhances students\u2019 facility with information \nand communication technology through modular coursework applied \nin concert with workplace learning and company-based practice. \nIt includes professional and skills development for teachers and new \neducation standards. The vocational education and training curricula \nand related materials have been reviewed for compliance with certain \nminimum standards. \n\nIn addition to these measures, the government has launched a \nlabor market information portal. Assessment of demand for various \nskills and improved labor market facilities that use this assessment \ncan help remedy the mismatch between workforce skills and market \ndemand. Further, the government has established a framework for \nprofessional competence in line with market trends and demand for \nprofessional quali\ufb01cations. \n\nMore could be done, however, to develop skills and alleviate \nlabor shortages: giving \ufb01rms \ufb01nancial and tax incentives, expanding \ntraining, and promoting certain career pathways. Doing so would \ninvolve introducing or rethinking unemployment insurance or targeted \nsubsidies in the labor market to encourage job seekers to seek further \ntraining rather than accept jobs for which they are poorly trained. \nThe government could encourage \ufb01rms to support e-learning programs \nfor skills development and to adopt more advanced technology that \nwould productively use the skills of newly trained workers.\n\n3.3.9\u2002Public debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance of Georgia. www.mof.ge;  \nInternational Monetary Fund. www.imf.org \n(accessed 3 March 2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.10\u2002 Current account components\n\nExports\nImports\nNet services\nNet income\nCurrent transfers\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\n14\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\u20137\n\n\u201314\n\n\u201321\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of Georgia. https://www.nbg.gov.ge \n(accessed 3 March 2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.3.11\u2002Employment share\n\n47.4%\nAgriculture\n\n40.3%\nServices\n\n12.3%\nIndustry\n\n6.2%\nNonmanufacturing\n\n6.1%\nManufacturing\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Georgia.  \nhttp://www.geostat.ge (accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fKazakhstan\n\nLow  revenues  from  oil  exports  cut  growth  to  1.0%  in  2016  and  widened  the  current  account \ndeficit,  while  the  lagged  effect  of  depreciation  in  2015  pushed  average  inflation  to  14.6%.  As  oil \nprice recovery boosts development spending, growth is forecast at 2.4% in 2017 and 2.2% in 2018. \nThe  current  account  is  expected  to  improve  and  inflation  to  fall  in  2017  and  2018.  The  banking \nsystem  needs  strengthening.\n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth slowed to 1.0% in 2016, the third consecutive year of \ndeceleration largely because of weak prices for oil, the economy\u2019s main \nexport. Heavy government spending kept growth from falling more.\nOn the supply side, industry contracted by 1.1% with a continued \ndecline in mining, though less than the 1.4% drop registered in 2015. \nServices expanded by 0.8%, less than the 3.1% rise in 2015, as declines \nin communications and trade weighed on gains in transport and other \nservices. Construction is estimated to have expanded by 7.9%, up from \n4.4% in 2015, thanks to sizable government outlays. Agriculture reversed \ncontraction of 3.5% in 2015 to grow by an estimated 5.5% on increases of \n7.8% for crops and 2.7% for livestock.\n\nOn the demand side, for which data are available only for the \ufb01rst \n\n9 months, consumption rose by 1.4%, slower than the 2.4% increase \nin the same period of 2015. Private consumption rose by only 1.0%, \nconstrained by currency depreciation, but higher government spending \nboosted public consumption by 2.7%, more than the 2.5% gain in 2015. \nFixed investment expanded by 4.0%, up from 3.1% in 2015, as higher \npublic investment offset a slowdown in private investment. Net exports \nfell by 21.3% as reduced exports of oil and gas condensate caused total \nexports to fall more than imports (Figure 3.4.1).\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation jumped to 14.6% from 6.6% in 2015, re\ufb02ecting \ncurrency depreciation in the last quarter of 2015. However, year-on-\nyear in\ufb02ation eased in December to 8.5% from 13.6% in 2015 with the \nstabilization of the exchange rate. Prices rose by 9.7% for food, 9.5% for \nother goods, and 6.1% for services (Figure 3.4.2).\n\nThe state budget balance recorded a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.6% of GDP, \ndown from 2.2% in 2015. Revenue rose to 20.4% of GDP from 18.7% \nin 2015, while expenditure, including net lending and \ufb01nancial \nasset transactions, came to 22.0% of GDP, up from 20.9% in the \nprevious year (Figure 3.4.3).

It nevertheless lowered \nthe base interest rate from 17% in February 2016 to 12% in November \nand 11% in February 2017 to maintain growth. Broad money in local \ncurrency (M2) rose dramatically by 46.4% during the year, versus 7.9% \nin 2015 (Figure 3.4.4). Total broad money including foreign currency \ndeposits grew more slowly, by 15.7% versus 34.3% in 2015, as policy \nmeasures to address dollarization made holding Kazakh tenge more \nattractive and expectations of further depreciation abated, reducing the \nshare of deposits in foreign currency to 54.6% from 69.0% a year earlier \n(Figure 3.4.5).\n\nCredit to non\ufb01nancial entities in the private sector grew by 1.2% \n\nin 2016, down from 4.6% in 2015, with short-term loans growing \nfaster than long-term credits to reach 62.6% of all loans at the end of \nthe year. Foreign currency loans rose by 10.0%, while local currency \nloans rose by only 4.0% despite the adoption of measures, including \ninterest rate subsidies, to encourage lending in tenge. Average rates for \ncommercial bank loans to companies rose by 1.5 percentage points to \n17.2% for loans in tenge and by 0.3 percentage points to 7.6% for loans in \nforeign currency.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is estimated to have doubled to 6.1% \nof GDP from 3.0% in 2015. Exports fell by 20.0%, re\ufb02ecting weak oil \nprices, while imports declined by 17.6% as lower incomes and tenge \ndepreciation curtailed household purchasing power and demand for \nimported goods and services. The estimated trade surplus fell by 25.5% \nto $9.4 billion. The services de\ufb01cit narrowed by 6.4%, but the de\ufb01cit \nin the income account widened by 9.1% on larger net pro\ufb01t out\ufb02ows. \nSince late January 2016, the exchange rate against the US dollar has \nstabilized, and oil prices trended upward, albeit with \ufb02uctuations, \nthrough the end of 2016.\n\nTotal international assets decreased by 0.6% in 2016 to $90.7 billion, \n\nof which $61.0 billion comprised sovereign wealth fund assets \n(Figure 3.4.6). Using end-of-period exchange rates, external debt \nincluding intercompany loans equaled 120.7% of GDP at the end of \nSeptember 2016, down from 128.0% in December 2015, as the tenge \nstrengthened during the period. Excluding intercompany loans, \nexternal debt equaled 54.7% of GDP at the end of September 2016, \ndown from 59.7% at the end of 2015 (Figure 3.4.7).\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast to rise to 2.4% in 2017 and slow slightly to 2.2% in \n2018 with a smaller \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit. Domestic demand is expected to be \nthe main source of growth, re\ufb02ecting continued \ufb01scal spending for \nconsumption and investment and higher earnings from oil exports.\n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand by 2.4% in 2017 \nand 2.2% in 2018 with higher infrastructure spending and increased \nproduction of oil and gas condensate (Figure 3.4.8).

In addition, a \n$36.8 billion expansion of the Tengiz oil \ufb01eld planned since 2016 is \nprojected to raise crude oil production by 260,000 barrels per day. \nAgriculture is expected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 and 4.0% in 2018, \nre\ufb02ecting a new state support program that should boost wheat and \nlivestock production. Services are projected to rise by 1.9% in 2017 and \n1.8% in 2018 with higher outlays for social programs and growth in \nwholesale and retail trade forecast at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018.\n\nOn the demand side, a slight improvement in household consumption \n\nand higher public spending are projected to raise overall consumption, \nwhile expanded infrastructure outlays should boost investment. \nWith total exports of goods and services expected to increase faster \nthan imports, net exports should add to growth.\n\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation is projected at 8.0% in 2017 and 7.0% in \n2018 (Figure 3.4.9), within the government\u2019s target range of 6%\u20138%, \nas the authorities adjust the policy rate, use open market operations to \ncontrol monetary growth, and maintain price controls. Imports other \nthan food are expected to remain the chief source of in\ufb02ation. \n\nFiscal policy is expected to remain expansionary. The state budget is \n\nprojected to record a de\ufb01cit equal to 2.9% of GDP in 2017, with plans to \nreduce it to 1.2% in 2018. Revenue is expected to rise to 22.6% of GDP in \n2017 and then decline to 18.2% with smaller transfers from the sovereign \nwealth fund. The government\u2019s plan is to reduce the share of receipts \nfrom the sovereign wealth fund to 29.2% of total revenue by 2019. \nExpenditure including net lending and \ufb01nancial asset transactions is \nforecast at the equivalent of 25.7% of GDP in 2017 and 19.3% in 2018, \nincluding planned spending for countercyclical measures. Public and \npublicly guaranteed debt should remain below 27% of GDP at the end \nof 2017. Kazakhstan is planning to introduce ceilings on the combined \ndebt of the government and state-owned companies, which by 2020 \nshould not exceed 25% of GDP.\n\nThe authorities are expected to maintain the current \ufb02oating \nexchange rate regime. Monetary policy is anticipated to focus on \ncontaining in\ufb02ation while retaining some \ufb02exibility to support growth \nin the event of a slowdown and protect the tenge against serious \ndepreciation. Growth in local currency broad money is projected to \nremain high in 2017 at 43.8% and slow somewhat to 42.4% in 2018. \nThis will likely contribute to continued in\ufb02ationary pressures.\n\nThe current account is projected to record de\ufb01cits equal to 3.4% of \nGDP in 2017 and 3.0% in 2018 as some improvement in oil prices boosts \nexports (Figure 3.4.10). Exports are forecast to grow by 15.2% in 2017 \nwith oil prices above $50 per barrel and oil production as planned. \nA further increase of 4.8% is projected for 2018 with the expectation \nof an additional rise in oil prices. Imports are projected to increase \nby 5.0% in 2017 and 3.0% in 2018. Import demand will likely come \nmostly from public infrastructure spending and anti-crisis measures, \nas well as oil and gas development projects. The estimated value of the \nsovereign wealth fund is forecast to exceed $65 billion at the end of 2017 \nand $66 billion at the end of 2018 as higher petroleum exports help to \nreplenish it.\n\n3.4.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2.4\n\n8.0\n\n\u20133.4\n\n2.2\n\n7.0\n\n\u20133.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.4.6\u2002 Foreign currency reserves  \nand oil fund assets\n\nGross international reserves\nAssets of the national oil fund\n\n$ billion\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n$ billion\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.4.7\u2002External debt\n\nExternal debt\nDebt excluding\nintercompany loans\n\nExchange rate\n\nT/$\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: 2016 is as of September.\nSources: National Bank of Kazakhstan; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fThe government has supported the banking sector through \n\n3.4.9\u2002 Inflation\n\n130\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening the \nbanking sector\nKazakhstan\u2019s economic slowdown has brought renewed attention to \nits troubled banking sector, which has yet to recover from the global \n\ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009. The central bank reported nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) at only 6.7% of all loans as of 1 January 2017. However, \nthis \ufb01gure simply aggregates NPLs reported by individual banks, which \nmay differ in how they identify and report impaired loans. Banks need \nnot report NPLs on a consolidated basis, and some have moved troubled \nloans off their balance sheets. Further, NPL counts exclude loans \nrestructured by \u201cevergreening,\u201d or adding unpaid principal and interest \nto loan balances rather than declaring the loans delinquent. \n\nThe central bank and the government increasingly recognize that \n\na signi\ufb01cant share of the massive total of restructured loans may be \nunrecoverable. In 2016, Moody\u2019s estimated NPLs including restructured \nloans at 37%, and Standard & Poor\u2019s estimated them in the range of \n25%\u201330%. Moreover, poor portfolio quality has undermined banks\u2019 \npro\ufb01tability and liquidity. In 2016, the central bank provided more than \n$1 billion in liquidity support to Kazkommerzbank (KKB), the country\u2019s \nlargest bank in asset terms, to facilitate its acquisition of Bank Turan \nAlem, 90% of whose assets are troubled. \n\nsubsidized loans from the budget, Kazakhstan\u2019s Problem Loans Fund, \nand a national pension fund, as well as by placing government and public \nenterprise deposits in selected \ufb01nancial institutions at low interest rates. \nIt also provided more than $5 billion from the sovereign wealth fund \nduring 2009\u20132015 to purchase bank shares, re\ufb01nance mortgage loans, \nand provide loans to the private sector.\n\nThe central bank postponed until 2017 introducing more stringent \n\ncapital adequacy requirements because of the deteriorating business \nenvironment for banks and the slowdown in the economy. Though \naverage capitalization in the banking sector in terms of core capital \n(Tier I) stood at 14.3% in 2016, some banks are expected to fall below \ncurrent capital adequacy requirements if needed to write off NPLs. \nThe central bank also eased its timetable for adopting Basel III \nregulatory standards, moving the deadline for full compliance from 2019 \nto 2021. Thus, banks were not required in 2016 to increase capital \nadequacy ratios or meet international standards for consolidated \nbank reporting.\n\nUnresolved asset quality problems prompted the authorities in \nFebruary 2017 to inject $3.4 billion into the Problem Loans Fund, \nexpanding the 2017 republican budget by 24%. The transfer is expected \nto enable the restructuring of KKB by allowing the fund to purchase \nthe NPLs held by the KKB subsidiary Bank Turan Alem, which has \nmost of the NPLs in the banking system. The fund\u2019s acquisition of these \nNPLs would enable Halyk Bank, Kazakhstan\u2019s second-largest bank, \nto purchase the remaining KKB assets and become the country\u2019s largest \nbank. Separately, Tsesna Bank, Kazakhstan\u2019s third-largest \ufb01nancial \ninstitution, aims to purchase an estimated 41.8% of Bank CenterCredit, \nKazakhstan\u2019s \ufb01fth-largest bank, from Kookmin Bank of the Republic \n\n3.4.8\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.8\n\n6.0\n\n4.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Republic of Kazakhstan.

In sum, proposed acquisitions would leave Kazakhstan\u2019s \ntop three banks holding about 53% of bank assets in the country.\n\nEarly in 2017, the central bank moved to undertake asset quality \nreviews of systemically important banks through an international \ufb01rm \nusing international standards, and then to enforce measures to either \nrestore banks\u2019 solvency or proceed with their liquidation. Moreover, \nthe central bank is expected to begin stress-testing this year, using the \nexercise to identify which banks need additional capital and how much, \nas well as to inform an assessment of their handling of impaired loans \nand provisioning practices, and ultimately improve it.\n\nAlthough the government has spent signi\ufb01cant amounts on \nresolving problem loans and bank recapitalization, many banks \nremain undercapitalized. Moreover, further accumulation of NPLs \ncan be expected in view of the weak economy. The high share of real \nestate loans in NPLs is a problem because collateral is not regularly \nrevalued and is often overstated. In addition, banks are not allowed \nto transfer NPLs collateralized with real estate, the usual collateral, \nto the Problem Loans Fund. Broadening the fund mandate to include \nsuch assets is therefore important.\n\nOn top of the measures already taken, the authorities would do \nwell to relax bank secrecy rules on loans to allow more precise loan \nappraisals and better assessment of the likelihood of future loan \ndifficulties, and to use international standards when conducting asset \nquality reviews. Also helpful would be greater clarity about regulatory \nplans as part of a broader effort to strengthen monetary policy by \nimproving central bank transparency and communication with the \npublic and \ufb01nancial markets.\n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nStrong  performance  in  gold  mining  and  trade  overcame  an  early  slump  to  bring  3.8%  expansion \nin  2016.  Currency  appreciation  and  higher  remittances  curbed  inflation  and  the  current  account \ndeficit. Growth is projected to slow to 3.0% in 2017 before recovering to 3.5% in 2018 with faster \nregional growth. Higher inflation and a wider current account deficit are likely. Eurasian Economic \nUnion  membership  poses  both  challenges  and  opportunities. \n\nEconomic performance \nGrowth slowed marginally to 3.8% in 2016 from 3.9% in 2015 as \nstrong performance in gold mining and trade offset a slowdown \nin manufacturing, as well as spillover from recession in the \nRussian Federation and slower growth in Kazakhstan (Figure 3.5.1). \nGrowth in industry jumped to 5.9% from 2.9% in 2015 as gold \nproduction more than doubled, offsetting declines in textiles, apparel, \nand electricity generation. Agriculture increased by 3.0% thanks to \ngains in crops and livestock, though well below the 6.2% expansion \nin 2015. Services growth slowed to 3.0% from 3.7% in 2015 although \ntrade growth increased to 7.6% from 7.1%. Construction rose by 7.4%, \ndown from 16.3% in 2015, as growth in capital investment slowed even \nmore to 3.8% from 14.0%. \n\nOn the demand side, a 22.0% rise in remittances boosted private \n\nconsumption.\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation plunged to 0.4% in 2016 from 6.5% the previous \n\nyear as consumer prices fell by 0.5% from December 2015 to \nDecember 2016 (Figure 3.5.2). This resulted from currency appreciation \nby 9.6% against the US dollar, a 5.0% decline in food prices, and \nunexpectedly small price adjustments following the country\u2019s accession \nto the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Prices for other goods rose by \n1.6% and for services by 5.2%.\n\nDespite a shortfall in tax revenues, the government managed to limit \n\nthe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 4.6% of GDP, albeit up from 1.5% \nin 2015, by underspending on goods and services.

The average deposit interest rate \ndeclined by 0.2 percentage points to 4.5%, while the average lending \nrate fell by half a point to 18.3%. Deposits rose by 5.0%, and credit \nfell by 0.5%, while broad money grew by 14.6%, slightly less than the \n14.9% in 2015. The nonperforming loan rate worsened to 8.8% at the \nend of 2016 from 7.1% a year earlier.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is estimated to have narrowed to the \nequivalent of 10.0% of GDP from 15.2% in 2015, re\ufb02ecting a somewhat \nbetter external environment. Imports declined by 3.7%, mainly \nre\ufb02ecting lower imports of vehicles and machinery, while exports \nincreased by 5.1% on higher exports of gold, as well as increased \nexports of agricultural products to the Russian Federation, and despite \nfalling exports of textiles and apparel. Accession to the EEU and better \ntreatment accorded to migrants under the treaty boosted remittances \nfrom the Russian Federation by 22.0% despite recession there and \nruble depreciation (Figure 3.5.4). At the end of 2016, international \nreserves reached $2.0 billion, cover for 4.6 months of imports, up from \n$1.8 billion at the end of 2015. \n\nWith currency appreciation, external debt as a percentage of GDP \nis estimated to have fallen slightly to 59% from 63% at the end of 2015, \nall of it public or government guaranteed. The ratio could rise again, \nhowever, if the local currency weakens more (Figure 3.5.5).\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is projected to slow to 3.0% in 2017 because of a high base \nin 2016 and an expected decline in output from Kumtor, the main \ngold mine. It is expected to recover to 3.5% in 2018 with some \nimprovement in the domestic economy and higher growth in the \ncountry\u2019s main regional partners, Kazakhstan and the Russian \nFederation (Figure 3.5.6). \n\nconstruction should sustain growth. On the demand side, higher \nremittances may further raise household incomes and private \nconsumption, particularly in 2017. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to return to 5.0% in 2017 because import tariffs \nmust rise to EEU mandates, and then ease to 4.0% in 2018 with limited \nadditional adjustment in tariffs. In\ufb02ation could be higher if further \ndepreciation of the Kazakh and Russian Federation currencies causes \nthe som to weaken. \n\nIf prices rise as projected, the central bank will probably raise \ninterest rates over the next few years. It will likely maintain a \ufb02exible \nexchange rate policy, intervening less often to smooth exchange rate \nvolatility. \n\nThe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected to narrow to the equivalent of \n3.0% of GDP in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018 as the government strives to \nrestrain expenditure, despite a presidential election in November 2017, \nand to boost revenue by reforming tax policy and administration. \nTax receipts could be higher if EEU accession yields more customs \nrevenue than now forecast.\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nDec\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.4\u2002Remittances\n\n$ billion\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.3\u2002Exchange rate\n\nSom/$\n\n45\n\n60\n\n75\n\n90\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nPrivate\nGovernment\n\n% of GDP \n\n100\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Government debt is both government and \ngovernment-guaranteed debt.\nSources: Ministry of Finance; National Statistics \nCommittee. http://www.stat.kg; National Bank of the \nKyrgyz Republic. http://www.nbkr.kg (both accessed \n3 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nOn the supply side, gains in agro-processing, light industry, and \n\n3.5.5\u2002External debt\n\n\fThe current account de\ufb01cit is forecast to widen to 13.0% in 2017 \n\n3.5.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n134\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nand 13.5% in 2018, re\ufb02ecting some improvement in trade with the \nEEU and signi\ufb01cantly lower exports to countries outside the EEU, \nnotably the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (Figure 3.5.7). Exports \nare forecast to grow by 6.0% in 2017 and 5.5% in 2018, mainly from \ngains in agriculture and textiles. However, weak demand in 2017 \nwithin the EEU could worsen the trade outlook, as could the failure \nof Kyrgyz products to comply with EEU veterinary and phytosanitary \nstandards. Using $1 billion from a joint development fund with the \nRussian Federation, the government is working to restructure the \neconomy by supporting export-oriented industries and taking other \nmeasures to smooth entry into the EEU. \n\nImports are expected to grow by 10.0% in 2017 and 5.5% in 2018 \nto meet the needs of planned infrastructure projects. Remittances will \nlikely rise by another 20%\u201325% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting some recovery in the \nRussian Federation and the favorable conditions for the Kyrgyz labor \nmigrants under the EEU treaty. \n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is very close to being rated at high risk of debt \ndistress. External public debt, propelled by heavy public investment, could \nsurpass 63% of GDP during the next 2 years if the currency depreciates, \nthough debt will likely decline in subsequent years. International reserves \nare forecast to be kept at around $2.0 billion in 2017 and 2018. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014opportunities and challenges \nunder the Eurasian Economic Union \nThe Kyrgyz Republic became a full member of the EEU in August 2015, \nexpecting membership to boost external trade, allocate labor and \ncapital more efficiently, and reduce nontariff trade barriers over the \nlong term (Box 3.5.1). In the short term, however, accession has fueled \nuncertainty and shown that adjusting to EEU membership will take the \nKyrgyz Republic several years. \n\nThe main bene\ufb01ts from accession thus far have been higher labor \nremittances from other EEU members, mainly the Russian Federation, \nand loans to local \ufb01rms from a $1 billion joint development fund with the \nRussian Federation. By the end of 2016, about $200 million in loans had \nbeen disbursed, mainly for agriculture, textiles, other manufacturing, \nmining and metals, infrastructure development, tourism, and medicine. \nTrade bene\ufb01ts in 2016 were negligible, however, because demand for \nKyrgyz exports languished as regional currencies weakened and recession \npersisted along with low oil prices. This compounded the effect of lower \ndemand from the PRC and other trading partners outside the EEU. \nThe main challenge facing the Kyrgyz Republic is its poor \ncompliance with EEU veterinary and phytosanitary standards. \nVeterinary checkpoints have been placed along the Kyrgyz\u2013Kazakh \nborder pending the release of data on possible epidemics and the \nintroduction of an electronic identi\ufb01cation system for Kyrgyz livestock. \nThe government response so far has been an effort to improve \noutdated laboratory equipment and the poor quality of cross-border \ntrade statistics. \n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n3.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u201313.0\n\n\u201313.5\n\n3.5.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.stat.kg (accessed 3 March 2017); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.5.7\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201320\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 3 March 2017); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKyrgyz Republic\u2002\u2002135\n\n3.5.1\u2002History and goals of the Eurasian Economic Union\n\nThe treaty establishing the EEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the \npresidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation and \ncame into force on 1 January 2015 with the signing of the EEU customs \nunion agreement. Armenia became an EEU member on 2 January 2015. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic joined the same year on 29 March, and its accession \ntook effect on 12 August 2015, opening its borders with Kazakhstan. \n\nThe fundamental goals of the EEU are to promote economic integration \namong its member countries and enable them to become more competitive, \naccelerating trade and growth. The EEU presents economic opportunities to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic in the form of a larger market embracing a combined \npopulation of 185 million and guaranteeing the free movement of goods, \nservices, capital, and labor, as well as the eventual elimination of customs \ncontrols and nontrade barriers. In particular, EEU accession should ease \nrestrictions faced by migrant workers in EEU countries. Over the longer \nterm, bene\ufb01ts should come from signi\ufb01cantly lower nontariff trade barriers.\n\nIn 2017, the Kyrgyz Republic became chair of the EEU Board. While \n\nserving as chair, the government aims to deepen economic integration \nwith other EEU members and remove barriers to cross-border trade \namong them. Also this year, negotiations for free trade agreements are \nplanned with India, Iran, the Republic of Korea, the PRC, some Arab \ncountries, and Europe through its Generalized System of Preferences. \nAs the EEU Board chair, the government will lead the start of \nnegotiations to harmonize member countries\u2019 obligations under the \nEEU and World Trade Organization agreements. To stimulate exports, \ndiscussions are exploring ways to encourage joint ventures between \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises across the EEU countries and in \nthe PRC. In addition, negotiations will start on revising the EEU treaty \nto re\ufb02ect newly arising issues, both regional and global. \n\nThe government is receiving advisory technical assistance to smooth \nits adaptation to EEU membership, realize the opportunities offered, and \naddress the risks. Over the long term, the country is expected to bene\ufb01t \nfrom customs cooperation and the development of a common EEU \nmarket for industry, agriculture and agro-processing, energy, \ufb01nance, \ninformation technology, and other services. \n\n\fTajikistan\n\nStrong  public  investment  enabled  growth  to  reach  6.9%  despite  weak  remittances,  low  private \ninvestment,  and  other  shortfalls.  Troubled  banks  and  continued  weak  remittances  are  projected \nto  moderate  growth  to  4.8%  in  2017  despite  better  performance  in  the  Russian  Federation  and \nother regional partners, followed by recovery to 5.5% in 2018. Healthier banks would boost credit \ngrowth  and  enhance  private  investment.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth reportedly accelerated to 6.9% in 2016 from 6.0% a year earlier \nthanks to higher public investment (Figure 3.6.1). Growth would have \nbeen higher if not for weakening private investment, budget shortfalls, \nlower prices for aluminum and cotton exports, and 13% depreciation \nof the Tajik somoni. Continued recession in the Russian Federation \nmade 2016 the third consecutive year with a decline in the number of \nTajik migrants working there (Figure 3.6.2), causing a 13.1% drop in \nremittances.\n\nOn the supply side, industry expanded by 16.0%, up from 11.2% \nin 2015 as value added in mining more than doubled and growth in \nmanufacturing reached 12.8%. Electricity generation and exports grew \nby 3.7% and higher crop yields boosted agriculture growth to 5.2% \nfrom 3.2% in 2015. Meanwhile, services contracted by 0.3% as lower \nremittances curbed consumer spending, following 7.1% contraction \nin 2015.\n\nOn the demand side, a 17.4% rise in capital investment attributable \n\nto public spending was the main source of growth, partly offset by \nlower private consumption resulting from weak remittances and \ncurrency depreciation.\n\nIn\ufb02ation accelerated to 6.1% from 5.1% in 2015 (Figure 3.6.3). \nThis re\ufb02ected the lagged impact of currency depreciation in 2015 and \nearly 2016 on import prices despite lower global prices for petroleum \nand wheat (Figure 3.6.4). Prices rose by 6.8% for food, 5.7% for other \ngoods, and 4.5% for services. Public sector wage increases of 10%\u201320% \nin July 2016 and then a 16.5% hike in average electricity tariffs in \nNovember also fueled in\ufb02ation. \n\nThe government budget recorded a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.7% of GDP, \nless than the 2.3% in 2015 (Figure 3.6.5). Shortfalls in revenue, re\ufb02ecting \nweak collection of domestic taxes and customs duties, forced the \nauthorities to cut spending in June 2016, though the budget was able to \naccommodate higher salaries and pension payments. Still, total revenues \nreached 32.1% of GDP, up from 30.1% in 2015, as \ufb01rms felt more pressure \n\nThis chapter was written by Muhammadi Boboev of the Tajikistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nDushanbe.\n\n3.6.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nConstruction\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n7.5\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n\n6.0\n\n6.9\n\n%\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.2\u2002Migration trend in Tajikistan, 2012\u20132016\n\nLabor migrants\n\nShare of labor migrants in the\ntotal working population\n\nHundred thousand\n\n15.5\n\n16.3\n\n13.3\n\n10.4\n\n9.2\n\n%\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Migration of \nthe Republic of Tajikistan.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nTajikistan\u2002\u2002137\n\nto pay taxes and tax administration improved. Expenditure rose to \n33.8% of GDP from 32.4% in 2015 as the government maintained social \nprograms and used foreign \ufb01nancing to expand capital investment. \nPublic and publicly guaranteed debt climbed to 32.7% of GDP from \n27.8% a year earlier, owing to external borrowing and currency \ndepreciation that raised external liabilities in local currency terms. \n\nMonetary policy aimed to maintain currency stability and combat \n\nin\ufb02ation. To limit depreciation, the National Bank of Tajikistan, the \ncentral bank, required from February 2016 that all remittances in rubles \nbe converted to somoni and that banks immediately sell to it half of the \nrubles converted. Together with tightened foreign exchange controls, \nthese measures helped stabilize the exchange rate for the rest of the \nyear and reduce the share of deposits in foreign currency from 71.5% at \nthe end of 2015 to 62.5% a year later. \n\nTo combat in\ufb02ation, the central bank raised the re\ufb01nancing rate in \n\nfour steps, from 8.0% to 9.0% in March 2016, then to 11.0% in July, to \n12.5% in February 2017, and \ufb01nally to 16.0% in March 2017. In addition, \nin March 2017, it increased reserve requirements. The central bank also \nincreased the interest rate for liquidity support loans to 2 percentage \npoints above the interbank rate and introduced overnight \ufb01nancing, \na short-term re\ufb01nancing tool, at the re\ufb01nancing rate plus 2 percentage \npoints. Further, it increased its sales of central bank securities and \nTreasury bills of the Ministry of Finance to sterilize the impact of \nthe ruble conversion requirement on liquidity, selling in 2016 the \nequivalent of 7.9% of GDP, double the 3.7% of GDP sold in 2015. \nAs banks bought more of these securities, they reduced credit to the \nprivate sector. In February 2017, all Tajiks were required to register \ntheir foreign accounts.\n\nDespite these moves and a 13% drop in the stock of credit to the \nprivate sector, which also re\ufb02ected weak demand and problems in the \n\ufb01nancial sector, broad money grew by 27.9%, up from 18.7% in 2015, \nas higher international reserves and a sharp rise in demand for local \ncurrency raised reserve money (currency in circulation plus banks\u2019 \nreserves) by 36.8%, more than double the rise in 2015 (Figure 3.6.6). \nFurther efforts to consolidate micro\ufb01nance organizations by raising \ntheir minimum capital requirements thinned their numbers by 15% \nthrough mergers and license withdrawal. In addition, the share of loans \nclassi\ufb01ed as nonperforming rose sharply from 29.9% at the end of 2015 \nto 54.7% at the end of September 2016, prompting bank recapitalization \n(Figure 3.6.7).\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to an estimated 4.8% of GDP \n\nfrom 5.9% in 2015 despite a further decline in remittance in\ufb02ows. \nExports rose by 0.9% mainly on higher domestic output and despite \nlower world prices for the country\u2019s main exports. Imports fell by 11.8% \nbecause of lower private consumption and subdued global food prices. \nExternal debt rose to the equivalent of 32.7% of GDP at year-end from \n27.8% at the end of 2015, re\ufb02ecting depreciation and higher borrowing \nfor capital spending. Gross international reserves rose in the \ufb01rst \n9 months of 2016 by 50% as a result of the purchase of domestically \nproduced gold, higher gold prices, and the conversion of private savings \nfrom foreign to local currency (Figure 3.6.8). \n\n3.6.3\u2002Sources of inflation\n\nOther goods\nServices\nFood\nHeadline in\ufb02ation\n\n6.4\n\n3.7\n\n6.1\n\n5.1\n\n6.1\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.4\u2002 Exchange rate fluctuations, Tajikistan \n\nand its main trade partners\n\nTajikistan \nRussian Federation\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nKazakhstan\n\nIndex, Jan 2016 = 100\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n120\n\n105\n\n90\n\n75\n\nJan\n2016\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nDec\n\nNote: Change in the official exchange rate against the \nUS dollar, January 2016 = 100.\nSource: Bloomberg.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.5\u2002 Fiscal balance and public debt\n\nDomestic debt\nPublic and publicly guaranteed external debt\nExpenditures\nRevenue and grants\nFiscal balance including the public investment program\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: National Bank of Tajikistan; Tajikistan State \nStatistical Agency.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f138\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to moderate to 4.8% in 2017 as high loan losses limit \nbank lending and weak remittances curb consumption, despite some \nrecovery in the Russian Federation and slightly better performance in \nother regional partners. Greater pressure on \ufb01rms to meet tax collection \ntargets will limit growth. Additional tightening of monetary policy and \nforeign exchange controls could inhibit lending and private investment, \nfurther constraining expansion. Growth is expected to recover to 5.5% \nin 2018 with higher externally \ufb01nanced public investment.\n\nOn the supply side, industry is forecast to expand in 2017 as \n\nconstruction on the Rogun Hydropower Plant picks up and accelerate \nin 2018 with gains in mining and manufacturing and the opening of \nthe Tajikistan segment of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Agriculture is expected to rise modestly \nas some migrants return to the land. Some growth in remittances is \nprojected to boost services moderately. \n\nOn the demand side, growth will depend on higher public investment \nbecause low foreign exchange earnings and likely further depreciation of \nthe currency will constrain private consumption and investment. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 8.0% in 2017 and then slow \nto 7.0% in 2018 (Figure 3.6.9). The rise will re\ufb02ect higher liquidity as \ntroubled banks are recapitalized, as well as a 16.5% rise in electricity \ntariffs from November 2016, a 25% rise in the cost of other public \nservices from January 2017, the lingering impact of the July 2016 public \nsalary hike, and continued currency depreciation. In\ufb02ation could be \neven higher if depreciation exceeds expectations or the authorities \ninstitute a more freely \ufb02oating exchange rate regime. \n\nOver the next 2 years, \ufb01scal policy is expected to be expansionary \n\nin view of plans for infrastructure spending. The budget de\ufb01cit is \nprojected to remain at 2.5% of GDP in 2017 and 2018 as weak imports \nlimit customs receipts. The de\ufb01cit could be higher with faster currency \ndepreciation or a requirement that the government clear arrears at \nstate-owned enterprises. Revenues are forecast at 30.3% of GDP in \n2017 and 30.8% in 2018, and expenditures at 32.8% in 2017 and 33.3% \nin 2018, as the government strives to improve tax administration and \ncontinues to maintain social expenditure and raise capital outlays. \nPublic and publicly guaranteed domestic and external debt are projected \nto exceed their respective legal ceilings of 7% and 40% of GDP with \nbank recapitalization, additional foreign-\ufb01nanced public investment, \nand currency depreciation.

However, growth has come with high economic vulnerability to international commodity prices and \ndevelopments in the Russian Federation. Tajikistan\u2019s goal in the medium-to-long term is to catch up with its neighbors and \nreach upper-middle-income status. Convergence will be difficult, however, because of \ufb01scal constraints and the economy\u2019s \nnarrow base, with production limited in quantity and restricted to products with little value added, highly concentrated \nexports, low private investment, and dependence on remittances and other external factors. \n\nThe government\u2019s National Development Strategy to 2030 has ambitious targets to achieve average real GDP \ngrowth of 8%\u20139% annually, which would raise real GDP by 250% to around $24.2 billion measured in 2016 prices. \nEconomic diversi\ufb01cation and a sharp increase in exports of goods and services are identi\ufb01ed as the main avenues for \nattaining this goal. Gross domestic savings are to rise from 8.5% to 30.0% of GDP, and the private investment share of \nGDP is to soar eightfold from 3.0% to 25.0%. Industrialization is to raise the GDP share of industry from 12.3% to 22.0%, \nthereby expanding output and exports. The GDP share of services is to remain unchanged, but services are to become \nmore sophisticated. Moreover, the index of export concentration in the three largest items is to fall from 83% to 58%. \nAttaining these goals would help expand the middle class, de\ufb01ned as households with per capita spending for monthly \nconsumption at TJS230\u2013TJS294, from less than a quarter of the population to half. The cost of \ufb01nancing the programs \nneeded to attain these objectives is estimated at $118.1 billion.\n\nIndependent analysis suggests that, given average population growth of 2.3%, attaining by 2030 the targeted GDP per capita \nof $7,000 (at purchasing power parity in current US dollars) from the 2015 estimate of $2,970 would require an annual growth \nrate of at least 8.8%, well above the 6.9% recorded in 2016. If growth averaged 7.5%, the target would be reached in 2035.\n\nExports are projected to grow by 5% in 2017 and 10% in 2018 as \ndepreciation boosts competitiveness and industrial output rises. \nImports are expected to contract a further 5% in 2017 and stabilize \nin 2018. The decline will re\ufb02ect lower demand and import substitution, \nand will come despite higher capital spending and some growth in \nremittances with recovery in the Russian Federation (Figure 3.6.11).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening banks \nthrough \ufb01nance reform \nA banking sector that effectively channels savings into investment is \ncrucial to private sector development, but Tajikistan has a poor record \nof providing \ufb01rms access to \ufb01nance. In its Global Competitiveness Report \n2016\u20132017, the World Economic Forum ranks Tajikistan at 105 among \n138 economies for \ufb01nancial market development. In Doing Business\u00a02017, \nthe World Bank ranks it at 118 among 190 for getting credit, down \nfrom 109 in 2016.\n\nOver the past 3 years, Tajikistan\u2019s banking system has recorded \nlosses and a sharp rise in nonperforming loans has reduced bank capital. \nThe rise in toxic assets has multiple causes: weak corporate governance, \npoor risk management, cronyism in lending to companies and individuals, \na high concentration of loans in risky sectors such as construction and \nagriculture, large transaction costs, and a lack of diversity in banking \nproducts. Several large banks have suffered from inadequate provisioning \nand a fall in the value of collateral. Bank weakness has made it hard for \nhouseholds to access deposits and withdraw money from payroll accounts. \nIn addition, \ufb01rms have had trouble meeting contract obligations, paying \ntaxes, and borrowing at reasonable rates. High interest rates and short loan \nmaturities have kept many \ufb01rms from undertaking productive investment. \n\n3.6.9\u2002Inflation\n\n% \n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Tajikistan State Statistical Agency; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n4.8\n\n8.0\n\n5.5\n\n7.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u20135.5\n\n\u20136.0\n\n\f140\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n3.6.2\u2002Recapitalization of four Tajik banks in 2016\n\nMinistry of Finance\n$488.8 million\n\nFononbank\n$10.1 million\n\nTajprombank\n$57.1 million\n\nAgroinvestbank\n$135.9 million\n\nTojiksodirotbank\n$285.7 million\n\nOn top of a business slowdown, the depreciation of the \nTajik somoni by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2015 \nhas brought a sharp rise in nonperforming loans, from \n29.9% of Tajikistan\u2019s sector total at the end of 2015 to \n54.7% at the end of September 2016. Moreover, the \naverage ratio of bank capital to risk-weighted assets fell \nto 5.4%, less than half the required 12.0%. Four banks \nfaced possible insolvency, limiting access to deposits \nand preventing the timely settlement of payments and \ntax liabilities. To maintain con\ufb01dence in the banking \nsystem, the government recapitalized the four banks \nin December 2016 at a cost of nearly $500 million, \nequal to 7.1% of GDP. Five-year Treasury bills with a \nconcessional 2% interest rate were issued to the four \nbanks in exchange for selected bank assets. The banks \ncould use these securities to obtain liquidity from the central bank for new lending (box \ufb01gure). To prevent currency \npressures and limit in\ufb02ation, the resources of certain state budget organizations that the Ministry of Finance previously \nplaced in the troubled banks, notably those of the agency that handles social insurance and pensions, must be returned \nto the Central Treasury at the ministry.\n\n2.

These problems contributed to \nthe 13% drop in the stock of credit to the private sector in 2016. \n\nThe government took several steps to address the problem in 2016: \n\nrecapitalizing four troubled banks (Box 3.6.2), strengthening bank \nsupervision, and tightening foreign exchange controls. In addition, it \neased reserve requirements applicable to both local and foreign currency \ndeposits for \ufb01nancial institutions that met capital adequacy standards. \nIt worked to facilitate cashless transactions and increase deposit \ninsurance coverage. An entrepreneurial support fund was established to \nprovide local currency loans at concessional rates to borrowers in remote \nareas. Finally, the authorities introduced a law on Islamic banking and \nfacilitated the creation of two credit information bureaus. \n\nBeyond the measures already undertaken, several other reforms \ncould help Tajikistan improve \ufb01rms\u2019 access to \ufb01nance in the short run. \nThey include obtaining a sovereign country rating to promote foreign \nin\ufb02ows, strengthening bank supervision, preventing cronyism in lending, \nenhancing the affordability and accessibility of \ufb01nancial services, and \nhelping eligible \ufb01nancial institutions provide \ufb01nancing to farmers and \nrural food processors in local currency to reduce their exposure to \nforeign exchange risk.\n\nOver the medium term, further regulatory measures are needed: \nraising the capital adequacy ratio to enhance con\ufb01dence in the banking \nsystem, establishing credit insurance and guarantee schemes to facilitate \nexport \ufb01nancing, introducing more convenient and up-to-date banking \nfacilities, and requiring banks to disclose their ownership and \ufb01nancial \nresults. In addition, the authorities should develop an effective stress-\ntesting framework, introduce long-term foreign exchange risk hedging, \nand take steps to establish in\ufb02ation targeting that could support the \ncurrency over the medium-to-long term.\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201310\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; National Bank of \nTajikistan; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.6.11\u2002Remittances and GDP growth\n\nRussian Federation \nGDP growth\nTajikistan GDP growth\n\nPersonal remittances\nreceived\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201360\n\n2007\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2016 17 18\nForecast\n\nSources: World Bank, World Development Indicators online \ndatabase; National Bank of Tajikistan; ADB estimates for \nTajikistan GDP growth and remittance in\ufb02ows.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nGrowth  moderated  to  6.2%  in  2016.

Growth  is \nprojected to return to 6.5% in 2017 and accelerate to 7.0% in 2018, with some rise in inflation and \na narrower current account deficit as prices for hydrocarbons improve. Private sector development \nis  key  to  diversifying  growth.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported GDP growth at 6.2% in 2016, slightly below \nthe 6.5% recorded a year earlier (Figure 3.7.1). The slowdown re\ufb02ected \nlower global energy prices, weaker demand for hydrocarbons from \ntrade partners, worsening terms of trade, and a slowing of investment.\nOn the supply side, Turkmenistan\u2019s large hydrocarbon economy \n\nexpanded by 2.8%, the same as in 2015. Growth came from the \nnon-hydrocarbon economy, which expanded in 2016 by 6.6%. This \nwas less than last year\u2019s 8.5% as industry, traditionally the country\u2019s \nkey growth driver, expanded by only 1.2%, down from 3.1% in 2015 \nand 11.4% in 2014 as the contraction in hydrocarbons reduced sector \ngrowth. Services grew by 11.0%, improving on last year\u2019s 10.0% with \nincreases of 14.2% in trade, 10.4% in transport and communications, \n4.4% in construction services, and 9.7% in other services. Agriculture \nreportedly grew by 12.0% as the strategic crops cotton and wheat met \nproduction targets. \n\nOn the demand side, investment drove growth. The International \n\nMonetary Fund (IMF) estimated gross investment equal to 39% \nof GDP in 2016, of which 13 percentage points was foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI), mainly for gas, oil, and chemical processing. \nGrowth in consumption, particularly private consumption, was less \nrobust as in\ufb02ation and currency depreciation weakened household real \nincomes despite a 10% rise in salaries, pensions, and stipends. \n\nNo official estimate of in\ufb02ation in 2016 is available. An IMF estimate \n\nin October 2016 put in\ufb02ation at 6.4% in 2015 and 5.5% in 2016, though \nit may have slowed only to 6.0% (Figure 3.7.2). Sustaining in\ufb02ation \nwere depreciation pressure on the Turkmen manat last year against \nthe US dollar that was factored in domestic prices, higher utility tariffs \nas public utility subsidies are being phased out, and rising prices for \nimported consumer goods because of higher import duties.

Tighter monetary \npolicy, reduced bank lending, and more stringent \ufb01nancial operations \nhelped slash broad money growth to 7.2% from 16.1% in 2015.\n\nThe state budget is estimated to have incurred a small de\ufb01cit equal \nto 0.8% of GDP in 2016, similar to the 0.7% de\ufb01cit in 2015 (Figure 3.7.3). \nRevenue, estimated at 15.1% of GDP, was in line with the state budget, \nwhile expenditure was reported at 15.9% of GDP, which was 13.5% less \nthan planned. Over 80% of spending went to social programs and a \n10% rise in salaries, pensions, and stipends. Outlays for investment rose \nby 1.2% in 2016, much less than the 7.8% in 2015, as the government \nrationalized capital spending and prioritized large investment programs. \n(This does not take into account quasi-\ufb01scal operations, which are \nbelieved to be large.) As industry outside of hydrocarbons improved \nits performance, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit derived from the non-hydrocarbon \nsector gradually shrank from 11.2% of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2014 to \n8.2% in 2015 and 6.8% last year. The Stabilization Fund helped smooth \nrevenue volatility and offset contraction from lower energy exports. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is estimated to have widened to 18.5% \n\nof GDP as higher FDI-related imports of services and factor income \npayments combined with lower hydrocarbon exports, which account \nfor 85% of all exports. Exports of goods fell by 15.4% while imports of \ngoods contracted by 16.7% (Figure 3.7.4). According to estimates from \nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the stock \nof FDI rose to $32.1 billion in 2015 from $13.4 billion in 2010, when last \nreported. FDI in\ufb02ows reached $4.3 billion in 2015, up from $3.6 billion \nin 2010 (Figure 3.7.5). This made Turkmenistan the largest FDI \nrecipient among landlocked economies in transition. Most FDI went to \nboost processing and value added in oil, gas, and chemical production. \nExternal debt, all of it public, remained low at 23.2% of GDP, and an \nIMF debt-sustainability assessment characterized debt as \u201cresilient \nto most shocks.\u201d According to \ufb01gures from the Bank for International \nSettlements, foreign exchange reserves remained at a comfortable \n30 months of import cover. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is projected to rise slightly to 6.5% in 2017 and 7.0% in 2018, \nled by government investment, strong FDI, and consumption, both \npublic and private. An expected recovery in global energy prices should \nboost income and \ufb01scal revenue.\n\nOn the supply side, a recovery in hydrocarbons is projected to help \nindustry expand by 4.0%\u20135.0%, supported by growth in food processing, \nagro-industry, light industry, construction materials, and chemicals\u2014all \ntargets for import substitution. With extensive government support for \nfarmers, agriculture is expected to grow by 10.0% in both 2017 and 2018. \nDemand for services is projected to grow by more than 10.0% in both \nyears thanks to a boost from the Fifth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts \nGames, which are expected to attract participants from 62 countries \nin Asia and Oceania to the capital Ashgabat in September 2017.\n\n3.7.3\u2002Government fiscal balances\n\nNon-hydrocarbon \ufb01scal balance\nNon-hydrocarbon revenue\nOverall \ufb01scal balance\n\n%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Fiscal data refer to general government.

Broad money growth is projected to reaccelerate to 8.2% \nin 2017, re\ufb02ecting credit expansion for the private sector (Figure 3.7.6).\nThe state budget projects a de\ufb01cit equal to 0.4% of GDP in 2017 and \na surplus of 0.5% in 2018 as higher energy prices and expansion in the \nnon-hydrocarbon economy raise revenue (Figure 3.7.7). The government \nplans to continue supporting social programs and build industrial \ninfrastructure in the regions to create jobs and raise incomes in \nrural areas, thereby smoothing urban\u2013rural disparities. \n\nWith some recovery in global energy prices, exports are forecast to \nrise by 12.0%, outpacing import growth of 10.3%. Despite the assumption \nof large FDI-related service imports and factor income payments, the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit is expected to narrow to 15.0% of GDP in 2017 \nand 13.0% in 2018. External debt is projected to rise slightly to 23.4% of \nGDP in 2017 and then decline to 18.0% in 2018 with the repayment of \nsome debt for hydrocarbon investment. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014diversifying growth through \nprivate sector development\nThe government\u2019s growth model uses hydrocarbon revenue to \ufb01nance \npublic investment for development. This model has generated strong \ngrowth, averaging 12% in the past decade, which enabled the country \nto reach upper-middle-income status in 2012. However, the decline \nin energy prices since late 2014 requires rethinking this approach \nand seeking alternative sources of growth through diversi\ufb01cation \n(Figure 3.7.8). Developing the private sector is particularly important as \na way to diversify the economy, attract investment, and support incomes \nthrough job creation.\n\nThe National Program of Socio-Economic Development, 2011\u20132030 \naims to raise the private sector share of the non-hydrocarbon economy \nto as much as 70% by 2020 from 56% in 2012. The program stipulates \na three-phase privatization program to 2020 that uses FDI to privatize \nconstruction, energy, transport, and communications. \n\nDeveloping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is an effective \nway to expand the private sector. The government has initiated a number \nof measures to speed SME development through job creation, import \nsubstitution, and export promotion. To this end, legislation was revised \nto provide SMEs with stronger legal, \ufb01nancial, and capacity-building \nsupport (Box 3.7.1). According to the government, the private sector share \nof non-hydrocarbon GDP surpassed 65% in 2016. \n\nFurther improvement of the business climate beyond current \n\nprograms would facilitate economic transformation and diversi\ufb01cation. \nThe Transition Report 2016\u201317 from the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development surveyed progress away from central planning toward \nan industrialized market economy and found it limited, evident in only \n\n$ billion\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\nSources: United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment. 2016.

One was a new law that simpli\ufb01ed SME \nregistration and provided to SMEs favorable taxation, special \ufb01nancing programs, capacity building, and other support. \nAs a consequence, the tax code introduced a single tax rate of 2% on the incomes of entrepreneurs, streamlined the \npaperwork required from \ufb01rms, and simpli\ufb01ed tax reporting and payments. \n\nThe State Development Bank was created in 2011 to direct to public projects the central budget surpluses that had \naccumulated in the Stabilization Fund. The bank was authorized to make concessional loans to enterprises and private \nentrepreneurs that implement projects to develop and modernize production facilities and create jobs. In the same year, \nthe government established the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In 2012, it created the country\u2019s \ufb01rst private bank, \nRysgal, which received a 10-year interest-free loan equal to $100 million to pass on as soft loans to SMEs. \n\nGovernment support helped increase the number of legal entities with private ownership by 40% from 2011 to 2016. \nIn addition, the private sector share of non-hydrocarbon GDP grew by 60% from 2010. Sectors with expanding private \nparticipation include agriculture, agro-industries, transport, construction, food and other light industry, textiles, construction \nmaterials, and tourism. \n\n2 of 15 sectors. The report noted development gaps in the business \nenvironment, business skills, and the \ufb01nancial sector, including bank \n\ufb01nancing, the related legal framework, and nonbank \ufb01nancing.\n\nIn addition, tremendous potential exists for gains from modernizing \n\neducation. Private entrepreneurs need to enhance their skills in \ninnovation and entrepreneurship to produce and export competitive and \nsophisticated products that bene\ufb01t from Turkmenistan\u2019s comparative \nadvantage. This calls for more investment in education and professional \nprograms that are higher quality and more relevant, as training for \nworkers and students must improve to meet international standards and \nthe demands of the labor market. More support for science, research, \nand technology would foster collaboration between academia and \nindustry to \ufb01nd innovative ways to diversify the economy, promote \nlong-term competitiveness, and create better-paying jobs.\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3.7.8\u2002GDP growth and energy prices\n\nGDP growth\n\nWeighted average energy price\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100 \n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016\n\nNote: Average energy price uses weights of 85% for natural \ngas and 15% for crude oil.\nSources: World Bank.

Inflation  was  marginally \nlower  at  8.4%,  and  the  current  account  recorded  a  small  surplus.  Growth  is  projected  at  7.0%  in \n2017  and  7.3%  in  2018,  with  some  improvement  in  the  current  account.  Currency  depreciation \nand  government  spending  are  forecast  to  raise  inflation  to  9.5%  in  2017  and  10.0%  in  2018. \nThe financial  sector  needs  reform.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe government reported GDP growth sustained by investment at \n7.8% in 2016, albeit down from 8.0% in 2015 (Figure 3.8.1). Growth was \nexpected to be lower in view of protracted economic weakness in \nUzbekistan\u2019s key trading partners. Industry and agriculture each grew \nin 2016 by 6.6%, down from 8.0% and 6.8%, respectively, mainly because \nof the weak external environment. Services expanded by 10.7%, up from \n9.8% in 2015, re\ufb02ecting buoyant \ufb01nance, trade, and telecommunications. \nPublic investment in infrastructure and housing contributed to a 12.8% \nrise in construction. \n\nOn the demand side, investment was the main source of growth. \n\nAccording to government statistics, gross \ufb01xed capital formation \nexpanded by 9.4%, slightly below the 9.9% rise in 2015. This likely \nre\ufb02ected less \ufb01nancing from commercial banks and the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development, the sovereign wealth fund, as more \ninvestment in modernization by state-owned enterprises and private \n\ufb01rms offset a 20% decline in investment \ufb01nanced by state-run \nspecialized funds, which focus mainly on roads and social projects. \nThe share of foreign funding in total investment rose to 21.9% in 2016 \nfrom 20.4% in 2015 as the government secured investor participation, \nmainly from Asia and the Russian Federation, in energy and \npetrochemicals. \n\nThe government reported the \ufb01scal budget with a surplus of 0.1% \n\nof GDP in 2016 (Figure 3.8.2). It used national reporting standards \nwithout making public any detailed breakdown of revenues and \nexpenditures. Using the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approach \nto government \ufb01nance statistics, the budget is estimated to have been \nin de\ufb01cit equal to 1.0% of GDP, similar to the estimated de\ufb01cit of 0.9% \nfor 2015. Factoring in the balance of the sovereign wealth fund, the \naugmented budget is estimated to have recorded a surplus of 0.2% of \nGDP, unchanged from 2015. Consolidated budget revenue declined from \nthe equivalent of 33.3% of GDP in 2015 to an estimated 32.9% in 2016, \npresumably re\ufb02ecting smaller in\ufb02ows to the sovereign wealth fund from \n\nThis chapter was written by Iskandar Gulamov of the Uzbekistan Resident Mission, ADB, \nTashkent.\n\n3.8.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nNet indirect taxes\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGDP growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n8.2\n\n8.0\n\n8.1\n\n8.0\n\n7.8\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nEstimate\n\nSources: State Statistics Committee; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.2\u2002 Fiscal performance\n\nRevenues\nExpenditures\n\nAugmented balance\n\n% of GDP \n\n% of GDP \n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nEstimate\n\nNote: Augmented budget includes the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development.\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f146\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nexports of key commodities and thus smaller transfers to the budget. \nConsolidated budget expenditure including outlays for net lending also \ndeclined, from 34.2% of GDP in 2015 to an estimated 33.9%, as public \nsector wages and pensions rose by the equivalent of 3.4% annually, less \nthan the nominal increase in GDP. Government debt, all of it external, \nrose to 13% of GDP in 2016 from 11% in 2015 as foreign borrowing \nincreased to \ufb01nance infrastructure development. \n\nThe government reported average in\ufb02ation at 5.7% in 2016, well \n\nwithin the monetary authority\u2019s target range. Using the same data \nbut a different methodology, the IMF estimated in\ufb02ation at 8.4% \n(Figure 3.8.3). Despite public wage and pension increases, tariff hikes, \nand faster depreciation of the Uzbek sum against the US dollar, in\ufb02ation \nslowed in 2016 largely because of global food price de\ufb02ation and lower \nimport costs. Growth in broad money also slowed, to 14.9% in 2016 from \n20.7% in 2015. \n\nThe latest exchange rate developments point to less currency \ndepreciation against the US dollar on both the official and the parallel \nmarket. The sum depreciated in official terms by 15% in 2016, slightly \nless than the 16% depreciation in 2015 (Figure 3.8.4). The pace of \ndepreciation on the parallel market appeared to slow far more, to 19% \nin 2016 from 60% in 2015. \n\nThe current account surplus narrowed to the equivalent of 0.1% \nof GDP from 0.3% in 2015 (Figure 3.8.5). Excluding services, the trade \nbalance recorded a de\ufb01cit of $2.0 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2015. \nExports of goods and services fell by 2.4% in 2016, mainly because of \na sharp 48% decline for energy and a 19% drop for food. Exports of \nnatural gas, the country\u2019s largest export, suffered from lower global \nprices and decreased demand from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand the Russian Federation. Limited data make it hard to explain the \ndecline in food exports. \n\nImports of goods also declined, by 1.2%. Imports of food dropped \nby 9.2% and of energy by 18.8%, mainly from tighter import controls \nand lower import costs. Machinery and equipment remained the largest \nimport category, representing 44% of all imports. Service imports fell by \n7.2% as weak external trade reduced demand for imported logistics and \ncargo services. \n\nThe slowdown in the PRC and Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan\u2019s main \ntrading partners, continued to affect the domestic economy in 2016. \nExports of goods and services to the PRC fell by 28%, and to Kazakhstan \nby 46%, re\ufb02ecting lower exports of natural gas and consumer goods. \nThe weak economic situation in the Russian Federation reduced labor \ndemand in that country\u2019s construction and logistics sectors, the main \nemployers of Uzbek migrants, depressing remittances to Uzbekistan. \nRemittance in\ufb02ows in the \ufb01rst 9 months of 2016, the latest for which \ndata are available, amounted to $1.8 billion, down from $2.0 billion in \nthe comparable period of 2015 and $4.0 billion a year earlier.\n\n3.8.3\u2002 Broad money and inflation \n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nBroad money growth\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nSum/$\n\n4,000\n\n3,600\n\n3,200\n\n2,800\n\n2,400\n\n2,000\n\n18\n\n9\n\n0\n\n\u20139\n\n\u201318\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.4\u2002Exchange rate\n\nSum/$\n\nSum/ruble\n\nSum/ruble\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan,  \nwww.cbu.uz (accessed 17 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.5\u2002Current account components\n\nExports\nImports\nNet services\nNet income\nNet transfers\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP \n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nEstimate\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nUzbekistan\u2002\u2002147\n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast at 9.5% in 2017 and 10.0% in 2018 (Figure 3.8.7). \n\n3.8.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is forecast at 7.0% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018, driven by \nan improving external outlook and higher investment, including \ninfrastructure (Figure 3.8.6). On the supply side, investment-led \nindustry is expected to remain a key driver of growth, with higher \nexternal demand for the country\u2019s main export commodities providing \nadditional impetus for annual expansion in industry by 6.0% in 2017 \nand 6.4% in 2018. Planned wage and pension increases that outpace \nin\ufb02ation should sustain private consumption, supporting growth in \nservices at 8.8% in 2017 and 9.1% in 2018. However, remittance in\ufb02ows \nare projected to remain considerably below historical amounts, limiting \nthe potential for increased household consumption. Agriculture is \nexpected to expand by 6.8% in 2017 and 7.1% in 2018, re\ufb02ecting \nhigher production of fruit and vegetables from major horticulture and \nagro-processing development programs initiated in 2017. \n\nIn\ufb02ationary pressures will come mainly from higher government \nspending and continued depreciation of the currency against the \nUS dollar. The government has announced that it intends in the near \nfuture to liberalize the exchange rate, most likely establishing a \nmanaged \ufb02oating regime, and to ensure the market-based allocation \nof foreign exchange. Pending further information, forecasts project \nannual depreciation at about 15% against the US dollar in 2017 and 2018. \nRising global food prices and potentially higher import costs will add \nto in\ufb02ationary pressures. Managing in\ufb02ation will therefore remain \na key policy challenge, requiring close coordination of monetary and \n\ufb01scal policies. \n\nBroad money is projected to grow by 17.5% in 2017 and 18.6% in 2018 \n\nin line with the rising net foreign assets of the monetary authority. \nCapital accumulation in commercial banks and their relatively high net \ninterest margins should encourage growth in credit extended to the \neconomy. The Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan is expected \nto expand its sterilization activities to limit growth in the monetary \nbase, but its policy (or re\ufb01nancing) rate is expected to remain at 9.0%.\nThe government projects a consolidated budget de\ufb01cit equal to \n0.9% of GDP in 2017 and 1.0% in 2018 to support economic expansion. \nIncluding expected surpluses in the sovereign wealth fund, the \naugmented budget is projected to be in balance in 2017 and to post a \nsmall de\ufb01cit of 0.2% of GDP in 2018. Consolidated budget revenues \nare set to decline modestly, re\ufb02ecting greater exemptions for the \nprivate sector, to the equivalent of 32.5% of GDP in 2017 and 32.2% \nin 2018. The government is expected to raise expenditure to support a \nnew national development strategy, which includes higher spending for \nhealth, education, and social security (Box 3.8.1). This increase will likely \nbe offset by savings elsewhere in the public sector. Consolidated budget \noutlays are forecast at 33.5% in 2017 and 33.2% in 2018.\n\nThe current account surplus is forecast to widen to the \n\nequivalent of 0.2% of GDP in 2017 and 0.4% in 2018 (Figure 3.8.8). \nRecovering global trade and a gradually improving economic situation \nin the Russian Federation and the PRC should promote bilateral trade \nand transfers.

It sets \ufb01ve priority areas for reform: (i) governance and public administration, \n(ii) the rule of law and the judicial system, (iii) economic development and liberalization, (iv) social development, and \n(v) security, tolerance, and foreign policy. The strategy identi\ufb01es inclusive growth and continued economic diversi\ufb01cation as \nkey to its reform objectives.\n\nUnder this strategic framework, during the next 5 years the government envisages undertaking business-conducive policy \n\nmeasures that provide affordable \ufb01nancing for \ufb01rms, address insolvency, enhance legal mechanisms to enforce contractual \nobligations, improve access to electricity, simplify procedures for obtaining construction permits, and ease business \nregistration. On 9 February 2017, the government approved a new streamlined system for registering new businesses, \nintroducing registration at a single window. From 1 April 2017, business owners will be able to register online and receive \napproval within 30 minutes. To ensure full coverage, the government will establish 194 physical single-window centers across \nthe country. These measures are expected to promote the development of micro and small enterprises. \n\nAnother initiative promotes agricultural diversi\ufb01cation and the development of high-value horticulture through farm \nmechanization, improved infrastructure, and more productive use of land and water. More market-oriented agricultural \npolicies and the development of agribusiness promise to make farms more \ufb01nancially stable. The government has prepared \na sector development plan through 2020 that envisages further reductions in cotton and wheat production and their \nreplacement with more varied horticulture crops. The strategy aims to improve logistics and processing and enable \nmore exports.\n\n3.8.8\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP \n\n5-year moving average\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nin 2017 and 3.0% in 2018 as merchandise imports rise by 3.0% and \nthen 4.0% (Figure 3.8.9). Import demand will come mostly from ongoing \ninfrastructure spending and the industrial modernization program, \nas well as from the purchase of capital goods for the recently approved \nagriculture diversi\ufb01cation program. Given the large external borrowing \ncomponent of these programs, external debt is set to increase to 18% of \nGDP in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 3.8.10).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming the \ufb01nancial sector\nStability in Uzbekistan\u2019s \ufb01nancial sector is closely linked to the country\u2019s \nmacroeconomic performance and sovereign \ufb01nance. The \ufb01nancial \nsystem is dominated by banks, which control over 95% of sector assets. \nIn 2015, eight state-owned banks controlled 75% of banking assets and \nprovided most credit to state-owned entities. These banks prioritize \nlarge export-oriented and manufacturing \ufb01rms\u2014a re\ufb02ection of active \npublic spending channeled through public banks. Smaller private banks \nlend mainly to small and micro enterprises. The government also plays a \nsigni\ufb01cant role in \ufb01nancial sector liquidity. It provides about 20% of all \ndeposits, second only to corporate deposits amounting to 40%, of which \na portion comes from state-owned enterprises. \n\nThe sector fails to provide sufficient \ufb01nancing to the economy, in \nparticular to small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, \nthe prolonged market dominance of state-owned banks poses a major \nvulnerability. Serious concerns include the concentration of banking \nassets, their questionable quality, and banks\u2019 continued receipt of \npublic funding. While the sector\u2019s exposure to global risks is limited, \nit remains largely ineffective at promoting \ufb01nancial intermediation. \nThe rate of \ufb01nancial intermediation, measured as the monetization ratio \nof broad money to GDP, is estimated at 23% of GDP. This is far below \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nUzbekistan\u2002\u2002149\n\nthe ratio of 54% in Honduras, 79% in India, or 138% in Viet Nam, all \neconomies with per capita income similar to Uzbekistan\u2019s. Exacerbating \nthis problem is an underdeveloped capital market. According to the IMF, \ntotal activity in 2014 was only $7.6 million, of which only 2.8% involved \nindividual investors.\n\nThe government has stated its intention to strengthen private sector \naccess to \ufb01nance and \ufb01nancial services. It has identi\ufb01ed small business \ndevelopment as a priority and aims to improve legislation to facilitate \nthe establishment and operation of small businesses by reducing taxes \nand simplifying registration, licensing, and reporting requirements. \nThe government\u2019s medium-term strategy for developing the \ufb01nancial \nsector anticipates that lending to small \ufb01rms will increase by 120% from \n2015 to 2020, though in\ufb02ation will mean a smaller real increase.\n\nIn December 2015, the authorities announced plans to sell at least a \n\n15% stake in some state-owned banks to foreign investors. Progress to \ndate has been mixed. International rating agencies have noted possible \nunderstatement of nonperforming loans, officially reported at less than \n1% of all loans though Moody\u2019s has estimated them at 6%. In addition, \nforeign investors have voiced concern about inadequate access to foreign \nexchange, as many \ufb01rms have reported difficulty in obtaining hard \ncurrency for current international transactions, with delays extending \nup to 12 months. The central bank has noted the concerns of rating \nagencies and is working with commercial banks to address the situation. \nTo improve sector capitalization and liquidity, the central bank plans \nto introduce Basel III standards and recommendations gradually but in \nfull by 2019. In 2017, the government announced its intention to improve \naccess to hard currency by developing the domestic foreign exchange \nmarket and adopting a market-based exchange rate policy. \n\nWhile the government has taken major initiatives, more is needed to \npromote \ufb01nancial sector development. The main challenges are to relax, \nif not eliminate, restrictions on cash and foreign exchange transactions \nand to stop channeling loans to speci\ufb01c borrowers and sectors. \nCurrent regulations prohibit the use of cash to buy raw materials and \nother inputs, and they delay cash withdrawal from bank accounts. \nSmall businesses often fail to meet requirements for bank credit because \nof inadequate \ufb01nancial documentation, limited \ufb01xed assets, and high \nreliance on cash \ufb02ow revenue. Further, limited trust in the formal \n\ufb01nancial system has prompted the holding of substantial savings in cash \nor real estate, constricting the \ufb01nancial sector\u2019s role in intermediation. \nAt the end of 2016, bank deposits equaled only 23.6% of GDP, one of \nthe lowest ratios in Central Asia. Reform to address these impediments \nis thus essential to allow other measures\u2014including improvements in \nsupervision, risk management, credit infrastructure, credit information \nsystems, and nonbank \ufb01nancial institutions\u2014to bring about \ufb01nancial \ninclusion and broad-based economic development.\n\n%\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3.8.9\u2002 Growth in exports and  \nimports of goods\n\nExports\nImports\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.8.10\u2002External debt\n\n% of GDP \n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f\fEAST ASIA\n\nPEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nHONG KONG, CHINA\nREPUBLIC OF KOREA\nMONGOLIA\nTAIPEI,CHINA\n\n\fPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n\nGrowth  in  this  restructuring  economy  continued  to  decelerate  in  2016,  but  the  government \nensured  stability  through  targeted  fiscal  and  monetary  support.  Inflation  started  to  rise,  and  the \ncurrent  account  surplus  narrowed  but  remained  sizeable.  These  trends  will  continue  in  2017  and \n2018.  Structural  reform  needs  to  be  accelerated  to  boost  productivity  and  sustain  growth  as \noutlined  in  the  current  5-year  plan.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth slowed further from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2016, \ncontinuing a trend since 2010 as the economy of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) changes its growth model toward one driven mainly \nby consumption and services (Figure 3.9.1). The government continued \nto provide strong monetary and \ufb01scal support to smooth structural \ntransformation and ensure economic, \ufb01nancial, and social stability. \nThis boosted investment in infrastructure and real estate, spilled over \ninto other parts of the economy, and kept growth higher than the \naverage of 6.5% called for in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.\nOn the supply side, services remained the main growth driver \n\nas real estate services boomed and other services registered strong \ngrowth, though growth in the whole sector slowed to 7.8% from 8.2% \nin 2015. The share of services in GDP further increased from 50.2% \nin 2015 to 51.6%, or 11.8 percentage points above that of industry. \nIndustry expanded by 6.1% in 2016, a rate close to 2015, as growth in \nmanufacturing picked up due to spillover from invigorated real estate \nactivity, a jump in car production stimulated by a cut in the sales tax, \nand robust construction that lifted demand for heavy industry and \nenergy. Energy consumption per unit of GDP nevertheless fell by 5.0%, \ncumulatively easing energy intensity by more than 37% since it peaked \nin 2005. Agriculture grew by only 3.3%, down from 3.9% in 2015 because \nof adverse weather and despite heavy investment. The contribution of \nservices to GDP growth increased to 3.9 percentage points while that \nof industry fell to 2.5 points and agriculture\u2019s contribution remained \n0.3 points (Figure 3.9.2). \n\nHeavy industry continued to report job losses, but the labor market \nremained stable nationwide with the creation of 13.1 million new urban \njobs\u2014many more jobs than the estimated 800,000 lost in the steel and \ncoal industries. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the ratio of urban job \nopenings to job seekers rose to its highest since 2014. This maintained \nsome pressure on wages, but migrant workers, a particularly vulnerable \nsegment of the workforce, saw wage growth decelerate to 6.4% in 2016 \nfrom 9.5% in 2015. \n\n%\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Jurgen Conrad and Jian Zhuang of the People\u2019s Republic of China \nResident Mission, ADB, Beijing.\n\n3.9.1\u2002Economic growth\n\nGross domestic product\nIndustrial value added\nRetail sales\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: GDP data for the \ufb01rst quarter of 2017 are not yet \navailable.\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.2\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002153\n\nOn the demand side, the contribution of consumption to growth \n\n3.9.3\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nincreased to 4.3 percentage points, that of investment fell to 2.8 \npercentage points as the economy became less investment driven in line \nwith government objectives, and that of net exports declined further to \nsubtract 0.5 percentage points (Figure 3.9.3). As can be expected in an \nurbanizing country with rising incomes, strengthening social insurance, \nand an aging population, the household savings rate continued to fall. \nThus, consumption outpaced GDP despite real disposable income growth \nslipping to 6.3% from 7.4% in 2015 and below the GDP growth rate.\nIn contrast, total industrial investment plummeted in response \n\nto excess capacity in heavy industry and mining, high corporate \ndebt, and an uncertain business outlook. This retreat was almost \nfully compensated, however, by rising infrastructure and real estate \ninvestment, as well as large outlays by emerging high-value technology \n\ufb01rms. Infrastructure investment was supported off budget through \npolicy banks and public\u2013private partnerships, imposing further \ncontingent liabilities on the government. Real estate investment \nexpanded strongly from a low base as easier mortgage interest rates \nand down-payment requirements fueled housing sales and provided \nincentives for new investment by reducing \ufb02oor space awaiting sale, \nparticularly in larger cities (Figure 3.9.4). When some local property \nmarkets overheated, purchase restrictions returned in many larger cities \nsince September 2016 and moral suasion on banks tightened access to \nmortgages. These restrictions have dampened sales growth but not yet \nhousing investment. \n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation averaged 2.0% in 2016, up from 1.4% in \n2015 but still below the government ceiling of 3.0% (Figure 3.9.5). This \nincrease mainly re\ufb02ected higher food, service, and administered prices. \nCore in\ufb02ation, which excludes food and energy, remained stable at 1.6%. \nReal estate prices rose by an average of 6.4% in the largest 70 cities, \nthough the restrictions introduced in September helped to moderate \nprice increases and in some cases reverse them. Average producer price \nde\ufb02ation moderated from 5.2% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2016 as industrial input \ncosts\u2014heavily weighted in the PRC producer price index\u2014increased \nwith rising global commodity prices and cuts to domestic capacity in \nupstream industries. This boosted corporate pro\ufb01t and ability to service \ndebt. Producer price in\ufb02ation continued to trend upward in early 2017, \nbut consumer price in\ufb02ation remained moderate.\n\nBudgetary stimulus came mainly through tax cuts. Consolidated \nrevenue collected by the central and local governments grew less rapidly \nat 4.8% in 2016, down from 8.5% in 2015 and 3.4 percentage points \nbelow nominal GDP growth. However, as growth in budget expenditure \nplummeted from 15.9% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2016, growth in the budget \nde\ufb01cit was contained at 3.8% of GDP, only marginally up from 3.4% in \n2015. Expenditure data do not include off-budget spending, for which \ntimely data are unavailable. It has been sizeable in the past. \n\nResponding mainly to the loss of liquidity caused by capital out\ufb02ows, \n\nthe authorities cut reserve requirements in March 2016 and injected \nliquidity through open market operations and re\ufb01nancing facilities for \nselected banks. Interbank market rates remained low for most of 2016 \n(Figure 3.9.6).

Credit growth substantially exceeded nominal \nGDP growth in 2016 (Figure 3.9.7), and debt and associated risks \ntherefore continued to mount. The stock of total social \ufb01nancing, which \nincludes bank credit and \ufb01nancing from nonbank \ufb01nancial institutions \nand capital markets to households and enterprises, expanded by an \nestimated 13.4%, faster than broad money but down from 14.3% in 2015. \nThe share of capital market \ufb01nancing through bond and equity issuance \nin total social \ufb01nancing increased in 2016 while that of loans provided \nby banks and nonbank \ufb01nancial institutions declined. In early 2017, \nthe share of nonbank \ufb01nancing again increased following government \nefforts to curb bank credit (Figure 3.9.8). Local government bond \nissuance\u2014introduced in 2015 to reduce funding costs and lengthen \nmaturities\u2014increased strongly in 2016 at the expense of borrowing \nby local government \ufb01nancing vehicles. The former is not included \nin the total social \ufb01nancing, while the latter is. Therefore, with local \ngovernment bond issuance factored in, \ufb01nancing expanded even faster \nthan total social \ufb01nancing suggests. \n\nthe People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, reduced net injection \nof liquidity through open market operations in September, edging \ninterbank rates higher and tamping down credit growth. Other reasons \nto act were rising price pressures in the housing market and capital \nout\ufb02ows, as well as con\ufb01dence by September that the growth target \nfor 2016 would be met. An increase in rates for two medium-term and \nseveral short-term lending facilities in January, February, and again in \nMarch 2017 con\ufb01rmed that the rate-easing cycle had ended in the PRC \nand signaled that the authorities are prepared to hike rates to contain \ncredit growth and support the renminbi, at least as long as growth \nremains sufficiently strong.\n\nPreliminary balance-of-payments data indicate that the current \naccount deteriorated in 2016. Exports of goods fell by 7.2% year on year. \nHowever, real export growth was stronger than US dollar \ufb01gures \nsuggest, given the weakness of other invoicing currencies. Imports \ndeclined by 4.6% even as prices for commodity imports stabilized or \nincreased. The merchandise trade surplus thus fell from $567.0 billion \nin 2015 (5.1% of GDP) to $485.2 billion in 2016 (4.3%). As the services \nde\ufb01cit further widened, mainly on $341.2 billion spent by outbound \ntourists, the current account surplus narrowed to equal 1.9% of GDP, \ndown from 3.0% in 2015 (Figure 3.9.9). The de\ufb01cit on the capital and \n\ufb01nancial account remained sizeable in 2016. Persistent drivers of capital \nout\ufb02ow were renminbi depreciation, easy credit, residents\u2019 desire to \ndiversify their portfolios internationally, and a continued surge in \noutbound direct investment. \n\nIndeed, net foreign direct investment \ufb02ows turned negative \nin 2016 for the \ufb01rst time in the recent history of the PRC. Under the \ngovernment\u2019s opening-up policy, which deregulates investment abroad \nand provides credit support, outbound direct investment more than \ntripled from $65.0 billion in 2012 to $211.2 billion in 2016. By contrast, \nin\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment plummeted from $241.2 billion \nto $152.7 billion over the same period as the business environment \ndeteriorated for foreign companies in the PRC. \n\n3.9.6\u2002 Interest rates and interbank \n\noffered rate\n\nShanghai interbank offered rate overnight\nLending rate within and including 1 year\nDeposits rate for 1 year\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\nJan\n2010\n\nJan\n2011\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nFeb\n2017\n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank of China.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nNominal GDP\nBroad money (M2)\n\n% year on year\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nNote: GDP data for the \ufb01rst quarter of 2017 are not yet \navailable.\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; People\u2019s Bank of \nChina; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.8\u2002 Total financing provided\n\nNonbank loans\nEquity\nCorporate bonds\nBank loans\n\nCNY trillion, 6-month moving average\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nJan\n2016\n\nFeb\n2017\n\nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002155\n\nThe smaller current account surplus and sizable net capital out\ufb02ows \n\n3.9 9\u2002Current account balance\n\ndrained official reserves in 2016 by $443.6 billion (excluding valuation \nchanges) but nevertheless left $3.1 trillion by year-end. As the decline in \nreserves was overcompensated by an increase in other claims on foreign \ncountries, total foreign assets increased from $6.2 trillion in 2015 to \n$6.5 trillion in September 2016. Deducting liabilities, net foreign assets \nincreased from $1.6 to $1.8 trillion over the same period. The PRC thus \nremained the world\u2019s largest creditor nation.\n\nSince late 2015, the authorities have managed renminbi \n\nexchange rates with reference to a number of indicators including the \nrenminbi\u2013US dollar closing rate of the previous day, and changes in \nthe renminbi\u2019s real effective exchange rate. Amid increased volatility, \nthe renminbi depreciated against the US dollar in 2016 by 6.8% on \naverage and by over 4% in both nominal effective (trade-weighted) and \nreal effective (in\ufb02ation-adjusted) terms (Figure 3.9.10). The renewed \nstrengthening of the US dollar since October 2016 and the resulting \nweakening of the renminbi triggered capital out\ufb02ow that risked \nfueling expectation of further depreciation. The authorities swiftly \nstabilized the situation through tightened capital controls, open \nmarket operations, and a clampdown on renminbi provided through \nvarious lending facilities. As a result, the renminbi appreciated again \nin early 2017.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is expected to moderate further in line with the controlled \ndeceleration of the past couple of years to 6.5% in 2017 and 6.2% in 2018 \n(Figure 3.9.11). The official growth target for 2017 is \u201cabout 6.5%.\u201d \nThe government has clari\ufb01ed that growth could be lower if efforts to \nachieve the target would entail excessive risk to the economy or the \n\ufb01nancial sector. Nevertheless, it is likely that sufficient monetary and \n\ufb01scal support will be provided to keep growth at or even above 6.5% \nuntil the Nineteenth Party Congress scheduled for autumn 2017. \n\nThe forecast assumes that the government may allow growth to \n\nslip below 6.5% in 2018, which would widen its scope for tackling \ncredit growth and accelerating structural reform, in particular to \nroll up highly indebted enterprises and further cut excess industrial \ncapacity. However, the government will certainly continue to provide \nselective policy support to ensure that adjustments remain socially \nacceptable. Fiscal support for infrastructure investment will play a \nkey role here, provided mainly through policy banks and public\u2013private \npartnership. \n\nOn the demand side, consumption will remain the main driver of \ngrowth over the forecast period. Support comes from continued wage \ngrowth that results from a solidly growing economy with a stagnant or \nshrinking workforce and therefore a tight labor market despite layoffs in \nindustries with excess capacity. Consumption will be further bolstered \nby more generous social spending on health, education, and pensions \nas the government addresses income inequality and improves access to \nsocial services nationwide.

A strong rebound in housing investment peaked \nin May 2016, stocks of unsold housing in many smaller cities remain \nhigh, access to mortgages has tightened, and purchase restrictions have \nbeen reintroduced in larger cities. It is thus unlikely that real estate \nwill contribute as much to growth in 2017 as it did in 2016. Investment \nin manufacturing and services stabilized in mid-2016 but remains \nweak. Again, there is no reason to believe that 2017 will bring major \nimprovement as the business outlook for export-oriented industries \nremains uncertain and credit growth is decelerating. Further, newly \nemerging industries with growth potential are generally less capital \nintensive than the old declining industries where investment remains \nconstrained by persistent excess capacity despite some progress in \nreducing steel and coal production capacity in 2016. \n\nThe government will continue to mitigate the drag on growth \nfrom economic restructuring by investing in infrastructure, which in \nany case is urgently needed to support rapid urbanization. However, \ninfrastructure accounts for only one-\ufb01fth of total investment and \ncannot fully compensate for the falloff in investment elsewhere. \nInvestment growth overall will thus lag GDP growth over the forecast \nperiod. This is in line with the objectives of changing the country\u2019s \ngrowth model, reducing \ufb01nancial vulnerability, and ensuring sustainable \nlong-term growth. \n\nThe forecasts for 2017 and 2018 have to take into account likely \ndevelopments in international trade relations, which are currently \nhighly unpredictable. Stronger growth is expected globally and should \nbe a boon for PRC exporters, but optimism must be tempered by the \nrising specter of protectionism, which can only spell trouble for the \nworld\u2019s biggest exporter. On balance, net exports are expected to detract \nslightly from growth over the forecast period, and the falling trend in \nthe share of exports in GDP, from a peak above 32% in 2006 to 18% in \n2016, will continue.\n\nOn the supply side, services will remain the key driver despite \n\na weaker contribution from real estate services. The economy\u2019s \nservice sector is diverse, and subsectors such as health, education, \nentertainment, tourism, and industrial support services have huge \ngrowth potential, which will be slowly realized as the government \nfurther deregulates and opens more of the service sector to private and \nforeign investment. Industry\u2014burdened by excess capacity, slowing real \nestate investment, and high debt\u2014will grow more slowly than in 2016, \ncontinuing a trend since 2010, though consumer-oriented manufacturing \nwill continue to do well.\n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation is forecast to accelerate to 2.4% in 2017 \n\nand 2.8% in 2018, coming closer to the government ceiling of 3.0%, \nnow recon\ufb01rmed for 2017 (Figure 3.9.12). Key drivers are strong \nconsumer demand, higher wages, continued price deregulation, \nsome spillover from the weaker renminbi, and global commodity price \n\n3.9.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n6.5\n\n2.4\n\n1.8\n\n6.2\n\n2.8\n\n1.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.9.12\u2002 Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002157\n\nincreases. To keep funding costs stable in an environment of rising \nin\ufb02ation, the authorities will have to further increase policy interest \nrates over the forecast period. This is necessary as well to keep the gap \nbetween domestic and US interest rates from widening too much, which \ncould trigger additional capital out\ufb02ow, and to slow credit growth and \nthus contain \ufb01nancial risk.\n\nIf looming tensions in trade relations can be contained, the PRC \ntrade surplus should remain broadly unchanged as the share of exports \nwith higher value added continues to grow. The current account surplus \nwill remain sizeable but fall below the 2016 surplus with a widening \nde\ufb01cit in the services balance. The overall balance of payments will \nlikely remain in de\ufb01cit because of net capital out\ufb02ow, dragging official \nreserves to below $3 trillion in 2017. This amount will likely be adequate \nfor an economy with an increasingly \ufb02exible exchange rate regime and \npersisting capital controls. \n\nThe downside risks to the outlook include, from the external \nperspective, heightened protectionism and increasing capital out\ufb02ow. \nAlthough the PRC enjoys adequate international reserve buffers to \nmitigate the impact of any risks that may materialize within the forecast \nperiod, the authorities may consider containing the out\ufb02ow to protect \nreserves, especially if it approaches the $100 billion/month drain seen \nin late 2015 and early 2016 (Figure 3.9.13). In that case, they would likely \nopt for further tightening of capital controls before considering hiking \ninterest rates or \ufb02oating the currency. Hiking interest rates substantially \nwould constrain growth but cannot be ruled out if capital controls \nprove to be less effective than in the past, or if US rates rise faster than \nexpected. Floating the currency risks creating a vicious cycle of further \ndepreciation expectations and additional out\ufb02ow, destabilizing the \nforeign exchange market. It would also contravene the government\u2019s \nstated goal of keeping the renminbi basically stable in 2017 relative to a \nbasket of currencies. \n\nA fully \ufb02exible exchange rate has been a government strategic \n\nobjective for years, consistent with its desire to further open up \nthe economy and advance renminbi internationalization, but these \npriorities have been in retreat since mid-2015. The share of foreign \ntrade settlements denominated in renminbi peaked above 30% in \nSeptember 2015 but has since halved to below 15% with concerns \nover the exchange rate outlook and tighter capital controls. Renminbi \ndeposits abroad and their role in foreign exchange transactions have \nbeen eroding for the same reason. To reverse these trends, further \nexchange rate liberalization remains a possibility over the forecast \nperiod, particularly if foreign exchange markets and the balance of \npayments become more stable.\n\nThe principal domestic risk is peril to the asset quality of banks \nand nonbank \ufb01nancial institutions posed by persistently rapid credit \nexpansion, including credit to inefficient \ufb01rms, in an environment \nof decelerating economic growth. Troubled loans classi\ufb01ed as \nnonperforming or with overdue interest payments already occupy almost \n7.0% of banks\u2019 loan portfolio, and strong credit growth may mask more \nserious repayment problems, potentially undermining \ufb01nancial stability \nand investor con\ufb01dence.

The \ngovernment\u2019s Financial Sector Work Conference, which is held every \n5 years and due in 2017, will likely mitigate this risk by deciding how \nsector regulators can better work together to head off incidents and \ncontain their fallout.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014raising investment \nproductivity\nThe PRC investment rate, or gross \ufb01xed capital formation over GDP, \njumped from 40% in 2008 to 45% in 2009 and stayed at this elevated \nlevel until 2013 (Figure 3.9.14). This was the result of the debt-\ufb01nanced \nand investment-oriented stimulus deployed to support economic growth \nduring the global \ufb01nancial crisis. Until 2008, the PRC investment rate \naligned with East Asian and Western norms and was thus not unusually \nhigh. However, the 5 percentage point jump has created inefficiency and \ndistortion in resource allocation and vulnerability in the \ufb01nancial system. \nAgainst this background, the authorities have embarked on rebalancing \nthe economy toward consumption. As a result, the investment \ncontribution to GDP growth has gradually declined as the consumption \ncontribution returned to its long-run level of about two-thirds. \n\nFrom a supply-side perspective, the contribution to economic \ngrowth from declining investment volume can be maintained only \nwith productivity gains. Only 5% of investment today is undertaken by \nenterprises or administrative units subordinate to central government \nministries, offices, or companies. Local government investment \naccounts for less than one-third of the remaining 95%. Improving the \nproductivity of investment thus poses three challenges. \n\nThe \ufb01rst challenge is to improve the efficiency of the one-third \nof total investment that is still undertaken by government agencies. \nThis includes most investment in public utilities, construction, \ntransportation, information technology, \ufb01nance, environmental \nfacilities, education, health, and culture. Reforms to public\u2013private \npartnership and mixed ownership are already under way for that \npurpose, but outright privatization should also be considered, especially \nwhere local government enterprises engage in commercial activities. \nNo modern market economy, and no high-income economy in particular, \nhas state-owned enterprises as dominant as they are in the PRC.\nThe government\u2019s policy goals include structural changes to \ninvestment that boost private investors\u2019 involvement in the provision \nof services and replace industry with services as the main driver of \ngrowth. The service sector share of investment declined from 62.2% in \n2003 to 54.6% in 2008 and then gradually recovered to 58.0% in 2016 \n(Figure 3.9.15). Further opening of sectors dominated by state-owned \nenterprises such as transport, telecommunication, and \ufb01nance to private \ninvestors, as announced by the government, will support this trend over \nthe forecast period and reduce the state\u2019s share in overall investment.\n\n%\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.9.14\u2002 Share of gross fixed capital formation \n\nin GDP\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.9.15\u2002 Sectoral share of fixed asset \n\ninvestment\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\n2009\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002159\n\n3.9.16\u2002 Share of ownership in fixed asset \n\ninvestment\n\nState-owned and state-controlled units\nCollective-owned units\nPrivate units\nForeign-funded units\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014 2015\n\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nSecond, the government has to further improve conditions for \nthe two-thirds of investment that is not directly subordinated to a \ngovernment agency but rather undertaken by private enterprises \n(corporate and individual), companies with mixed ownership, and \nforeign-funded companies (Figure 3.9.16). Ensuring that these \nenterprises are fully market driven requires, among other things, \ncontinued \ufb01nancial reform to attract savings to the most productive \ninvestment projects, encouraging investment in innovation and \nmovement toward the higher-technology end of the production chain, \nand alleviating constraints on skilled labor supply. The government \nis indeed attempting to push investment toward innovation and \ntechnology-driven production, as outlined in the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan and other strategies, by providing \ufb01scal, \ufb01nancial, and regulatory \nincentives to selected high-tech industries to turn the PRC into a \n\u201cmanufacturing superpower.\u201d\n\nCross-sector analysis con\ufb01rms that pro\ufb01tability and market \ndemand are major determinants of investment, but other factors can \nbe obstructive in individual industries. These factors include formal \nand informal industry-speci\ufb01c policies and/or constraints imposed by \nlocal governments to protect privileged enterprises in their jurisdiction, \nnotably through discriminatory nontariff barriers and price setting, \nprohibitions on the sale of nonlocal goods and services, government \nprocurement and compulsory trading that favor local enterprises, and \ncompulsory takeovers and collusive cartels. Strengthening competition \npolicies and their enforcement through strong institutions is crucial to \novercoming such constraints, as are industrial policies that are market \nfriendly and implemented without discrimination, and that allow weak \ncompanies to fail. \n\nAlthough the share of the private sector in total investment has \nbeen on the rise, reaching 51% in 2016 from 40% in 2008, the share of \nforeign investment (including from Taipei,China and Hong Kong, China) \nin total investment has dropped from 11% to less than 4%, and foreign \ninvestment has become concentrated in very few sectors. This pattern \nmay re\ufb02ect a newly found ability of domestic enterprises to invest and \ninnovate across all sectors, but it suggests as well that the current \nforeign investment regime hampers innovation and economic growth. \nTo address this issue, the government announced in January 2017 that \nthe environment for foreign investments will be liberalized to align with \nthat for domestic investment.\n\nThe third challenge is to ensure that investment stimulus provided \n\nto stabilize economic growth does not compromise efforts to make \ninvestment more productive. Measures should thus be designed to \nfocus on regions where support is most needed and on sectors that are \nnew growth drivers. Further, stronger private sector involvement in \ninvestment would empower market forces to enhance the outcomes of \nstabilization efforts.\n\n\fHong Kong, China\n\nGrowth  moderated  in  2016  for  a  third  year  in  a  row  but  will  recover  modestly  in  2017  and  2018, \nhelped  by  a  stable  labor  market,  durable  incomes,  and  fiscal  support.  Inflation  will  moderate \nfurther,  and  the  current  account  surplus  will  remain  stable.  Sharp  increases  in  US  interest  rates \ncould,  if  instituted,  derail  economic  recovery,  with  the  property  market  particularly  at  risk.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth slowed to 1.9% in 2016 from 2.4% in 2015, though growth \nin the fourth quarter reached 3.1% year on year. Resilient domestic \ndemand underpinned the expansion in 2016. Supported by steady real \nincomes, low in\ufb02ation, and a stable labor market, private consumption \ngrew by 1.6% and contributed 1.1 percentage points to GDP growth, \nwhile government consumption added another 0.3 percentage points \n(Figure 3.10.1). Investment rebounded in the second half of 2016 on \nstrong inventory restocking and resilient construction outlays to \ncontribute 1.1 percentage points to GDP growth. Trade bene\ufb01ted \nfrom improving regional trade \ufb02ows in the latter part of the year, \nwith exports growing year on year by 0.9% and imports by 1.2% \n(Figure 3.10.2). Net exports staged a turnaround in the last quarter of \n2016 but still ended up shaving 0.5 percentage points off overall growth. \nConstruction and services were the primary drivers from the supply \nside. Construction grew by 2.4% in 2016, while services expanded by \n2.3%, despite a lackluster performance by retail trade owing mainly to a \ndecline in tourist arrivals.\n\nThe current account surplus widened to equal 4.5% of GDP in 2016. \nA narrower merchandise trade de\ufb01cit re\ufb02ected in part a fall in retained \nimports in the \ufb01rst half of the year and partly a pickup in the value of \ngoods exports in the latter part of the year. An increase in the net in\ufb02ow \nof primary income offset shrinkage in net service receipts as exports \nof travel services declined more steeply. With net out\ufb02ow of portfolio \ncapital, the overall balance of payments surplus in 2016 equaled 0.4% \nof GDP. Gross official reserves rose to $386.2 billion at the end of 2016, \nor cover for 7.8 months of imports. \n\nConsumer price in\ufb02ation slowed to 2.4% (Figure 3.10.3). External \n\nprice pressures remained benign with subdued international prices \nfor food and other commodities and a weak renminbi holding down \nimported in\ufb02ation from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Steady \nlabor costs and subdued rent increases helped contain domestic costs. \nResidential property prices fell by 11% year on year in late 2015 and \nearly 2016, but they rebounded and by December 2016 were slightly \nabove their September 2015 peak (Figure 3.10.4). \n\nThis chapter was written by Benno Ferrarini and Marthe Hinojales of the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.10.1\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth \n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n1.7\n\n3.1\n\n2.4\n\n2.8\n\n1.9\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 25 February 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.10.2\u2002External trade\n\nNet exports of services\nNet exports of goods\n\nImport growth\nExport growth\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\nHK$ billion\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n\u201350\n\n\u2013100\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 25 February 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nHong Kong, China\u2002\u2002161\n\nThe government revised the estimate of the budget surplus for \nFY2016 (ended 31 March 2017) to the equivalent of 3.7% of GDP from \nan initial budget forecast of 0.5% (Figure 3.10.5). The higher revised \nsurplus resulted from additional receipts of HK$81.5 billion, equal to \n3.3% of GDP and mainly revenues from land sales and stamp duties \nfrom a buoyant property market. Government expenditure continued to \nincrease modestly, primarily on higher provision for social welfare and \ncapital works projects, but is likely to be lower than initially budgeted. \nFiscal reserves on 31 March 2017 were expected to stand a tad higher at \n37.6% of GDP.\n\nMonetary conditions remained accommodative, though the \nHong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) adjusted its benchmark \nbase rate twice in December 2016 and March 2017, cumulatively from \n0.75% to 1.25% in tandem with increases in the US federal funds rate. \nDomestic credit grew by 7.3%, and growth in broad money supply (M2) \naccelerated to 7.7%. The local equity market staged a rebound \nafter the sharp correction in early 2016, falling to a 4-year low in \nFebruary but ending the year 0.5% higher than in 2015 (Figure 3.10.6). \nHong Kong, China remained in 2016 the top market for initial public \nofferings even though the total funds raised dropped to a recent low. \n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is projected to pick up to 2.0% in 2017 and recover \nfurther to 2.1% in 2018 (Figure 3.10.7). Domestic demand supported \nby building and construction will remain the engine of growth. \nPrivate consumption will bene\ufb01t as well from continued stable \nemployment and strong incomes. Large public infrastructure projects \nwill lift overall investment, but private investment will remain sluggish. \nBusiness sentiment remains fragile, weighed down by moderation \nin the PRC, developments in the euro area, and the normalization \nof US interest rates. The purchasing managers\u2019 index slipped back \ninto contraction in the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017 after \ufb01nally and brie\ufb02y \nbreaching in December 2016 the threshold at 50 indicating expansion. \nBusiness surveys in the \ufb01rst quarter of 2017 showed pessimism still \nentrenched, particularly in retailing and construction (Figure 3.10.8). \nOn the supply side, growth will come from construction and services, \nin particular \ufb01nancial and professional services, the latter bene\ufb01ting \nespecially from strengthening ties with \ufb01nancial markets in the \nPRC and opportunities arising from the Belt and Road development \ninitiative.\n\nIn\ufb02ation will moderate this year and next to about 2.0%. A strong \nlocal dollar will dampen imported in\ufb02ation, while local cost increases \nwill be contained by a negative output gap and moderate economic \ngrowth. Together, these factors will dampen upward pressure from \nrising global prices for oil and other commodities.\n\nThe FY2017 budget includes a package of pro-growth \ufb01scal measures \n\nequal to 1.3% of GDP that the government forecasts will prop up 2017 \nGDP by 1.1%. The package includes one-off tax reductions for households \nand \ufb01rms, waivers of rates, and extra social security allowances and, \nmore permanently, recurrent social bene\ufb01ts and a tax reduction for \n\n3.10.3\u2002Inflation\n\nOthers\nTransport\nElectricity, gas, and water\nHousing\nFood\nOverall\nAdjusted\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Adjusted overall in\ufb02ation refers to the rate once \nthe effects of temporary subsidies by the government \nare removed.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.10.4\u2002Property market indicators\n\nProperty price\n\nResidential sales and\npurchase agreementsa\n\nIndex, Jan 2015 = 100\n\nThousands\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul Oct\n2016\n\na 3-month moving averages.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 28 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.10.5\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nExpenditure\nRevenue\nSurplus\n\n% of GDP \n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nEstimate\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 March of that year.\nSources: The Government of the Hong Kong Special \nAdministrative Region of the PRC.

When compared with the revised estimate of \nFY2016, the budget further includes a 0.7% increase of capital outlays. \nOn balance, budgetary revenues are estimated to fall by 9.3% and \nexpenditures to rise by 5.3%, shrinking the FY2017 \ufb01scal surplus to the \nequivalent of 0.6% of GDP. This is a step in the right direction given \nthe negative output gap and the need to counter monetary tightening \nresulting from expected US interest rate hikes.\n\nThe stabilization of global demand and growing demand in the PRC \n\nfor high tech products, especially semiconductors, should offer some \nsupport to exports of goods and services in 2017. However, further \nstrengthening of the US dollar, to which the local dollar is tied, could \nlimit export gains. Imports are likely to return to growth as the decline \nin investment continues to moderate and a depreciating renminbi \nlifts import demand. The resulting trade de\ufb01cit will be offset by an \nimproving surplus in the services account as tourist numbers begin \nto revive and demand for professional and \ufb01nancial services grows. \nOn balance, the current account surplus is forecast to remain stable \nat 3.1% this year and next.\n\nDespite the recent decline in offshore renminbi activity in response \n\nto prevailing expectations of renminbi depreciation, the role of \nHong Kong, China as the premier center for offshore renminbi trading \nremains secure. Trading will most likely be further strengthened by the \nDecember 2016 launch of a cross-boundary investment channel with the \nShenzhen Stock Exchange in the PRC, following the launch in 2014 of a \nsimilar channel with the Shanghai Stock Exchange. \n\nThe main risks to the outlook are negative spillover from monetary \n\ntightening in the US, given the currency link between the two \neconomies, and the potential impact of changes in US trade policy, \nwhich could hurt exports and undermine Hong Kong, China as a \nregional trading hub. Deepening integration with the PRC is bene\ufb01cial \non the whole, but it renders Hong Kong, China more vulnerable to \nadverse economic developments in the PRC. However, if any of these \nrisks materialize, the government has ample \ufb01scal and macroprudential \ntools to limit the buildup of systemic vulnerabilities. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014responding to rising \nUS interest rates\nBecause of the linked exchange rate system by which the local dollar \nis pegged to the US dollar yet freely exchangeable, monetary policy \nin Hong Kong, China must track that of the US. When the US Federal \nReserve raises its interest rates, the HKMA has to follow suit soon \nthereafter to avoid pressure on the peg. Banks may not immediately \nraise their rates in response, as long as there is ample liquidity available \nin the local banking system for lending, but they will have to raise \nrates eventually if there is less liquidity as a result, for example, of fund \nout\ufb02ows from Hong Kong, China. A gradual rate increase, as currently \nanticipated, would have only limited effect on the economy, with mild \nmovements of interbank and bilateral exchange rates that should prove \neasily manageable. The local property sector would feel the impact, \n\n3.10.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.1\n\n2.1\n\n2.1\n\n3.1\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.10.6\u2002Stock market\n\nIndex, July 1964 = 100\n\n31,000\n\n27,000\n\n23,000\n\n19,000\n\n15,000\n\n%\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nMay\n\nSep\n\nJun Oct\n\nFeb\n2016\n\nMar\n2017\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 11 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.10.7\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nHong Kong, China\u2002\u2002163\n\nbut large upward adjustments in mortgage rates are unlikely as long as \nthe banking system retains sufficient liquidity to continue offering \nlow-interest mortgages. \n\nHowever, if the Fed were to enact this year more than the expected \ntwo or three increases of 25 basis points each, local interest rates would \nhave to climb higher, hurting domestic demand. A feedback effect \non consumption from resulting negative wealth effects could force \ndown asset prices, especially for property. Further, if higher interest \nrates strengthen the US and local dollars, this would undercut export \ncompetitiveness and create headwinds for tourism, thus compounding \nthe damage to economic growth, at least to the extent that price \n\ufb02exibility in the service sector cannot mitigate the effect.\n\nLocal banks are well capitalized and have prudently managed \nmortgage \ufb01nancing risks by applying prudent loan-to-value ratios \nand assessing individual borrowers\u2019 repayment ability (Figure 3.10.9). \nThe HKMA also conducts stress-testing regularly to assess resilience in \nthe banking sector.

Consumption increased by 2.8% and contributed \n1.8 percentage points to growth, mostly re\ufb02ecting faster growth \nin private expenditure. Stimulus measures including tax discounts \nfor car purchases helped lift consumer spending in the \ufb01rst half. \nThen, undermined by a political crisis and subdued employment \nprospects, consumer sentiment plunged to a 7-year low in November, \ncausing growth in consumer spending to soften in the second half \n(Figure 3.11.2). The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% from 3.6% in 2015 \nwith the \ufb01rst falloff in manufacturing employment since 2009 and \nfurther job losses as the shipping and shipbuilding industries endured \ncorporate restructuring. \n\nInvestment expanded by 5.4% in 2016 and contributed \n\n1.6 percentage points to GDP growth (Figure 3.11.3). Investment \ngrowth accelerated in the second half as lower interest rates pushed up \nprivate investment, which provided 79.7% of gross capital formation. \nConstruction investment expanded by 11.0%, accounting for over 90% \nof investment growth and outweighing a 2.4% decline in investment \nin machinery and transport equipment. External demand, by contrast, \nremained subdued. Net exports subtracted from growth again in 2016 as \nexport growth was less than half of import growth in real terms, at 1.4% \nversus 3.0% (Figure 3.11.4).\n\nOn the supply side, services grew by 2.5%, owing mainly to \n\nexpansion in wholesale and retail trade, and health and social services, \ncontributing 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth. Manufacturing \nexpanded more slowly, at 1.7%, held back by lingering weakness in \nexports and the impact of corporate restructuring, as well as by \nproduction cuts following the recall of the Samsung Note 7.\n\nAverage consumer price in\ufb02ation rose to 1.0% in 2016, picking \nup in the second half along with higher food and global oil prices \n(Figure 3.11.5).

With interest rates low, \nhousehold debt continued to rise, equaling 82.8% of GDP at the end \nof 2016.

Nevertheless, the \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit including the supplementary budget amounted to only 2.4% \nof GDP, unchanged from 2015. Government debt recorded a small uptick.\n\n Customs data indicate that exports continued to contract in \n\nUS dollar terms last year but less quickly. Total exports dropped by 5.9% \nin 2016 as exports to all major partners declined. Exports to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), which took one-fourth of the total, fell by 9.3% \nin 2016, even more steeply than in 2015, and exports to the US fell by \n4.8%, compared with only a 0.6% drop in 2015. Shipments declined as \nwell to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which accounts for \n14.7% of all exports, and to the European Union, another key market, \nbut by less than in 2015. Imports also sank in US dollar terms but by \nonly 6.9%, much less than the 16.9% drop in 2015. With the merchandise \ntrade surplus shrinking to the equivalent of 8.7% of GDP and the \nservices de\ufb01cit unchanged at 1.1%, the current account surplus shrank to \n7.1% of GDP. \n\nDespite global capital shifting out of emerging markets, the net \n\ncapital position of the Republic of Korea (ROK) improved as net out\ufb02ows \nabated owing to a recovery in foreign equity investment and an increase \nin inward foreign direct investment. The current account surplus \ncontracted but remained large, and foreign exchange reserves rose by \n$3.2 billion to reach $361.7 billion at the end of 2016. The ROK won, \nwhich had been appreciating against the US dollar until early August, \nreversed course with heightened capital out\ufb02ow in the fourth quarter. \nBy December, it was 3.0% weaker against the dollar than at the end \nof 2015. In real effective terms, it appreciated by 0.6% during the year, \njust as it did the previous year.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is expected to slow from 2.7% in 2016 to 2.5% in 2017, the \nlowest since 2012 (Figure 3.11.6). Domestic demand will soften with \nweaker private consumption, but a recovery in exports can be expected \nto support growth. In 2018, growth is likely to bounce back to 2.7% \nas the impact of the political crisis fades and improved consumer and \nbusiness sentiment boosts domestic demand.\n\nGrowth in private consumption will slow in 2017, tamped down \n\nby rising household debt and unfavorable consumer sentiment \n(Figure 3.11.7).

Tighter \nproperty market restrictions introduced in August and November \nlast year to manage household debt have kicked in to contain growth \nin residential construction. Further, the planned cut in the government \nbudget for social overhead capital, which funds infrastructure such as \nbridges and roads, will curb civil engineering investment. However, \ndeceleration in investment growth will likely be countered by recovery \nin machinery and transport equipment investment induced by the \nexpected rise in external demand.\n\nThe planned \ufb01scal impulse will be smaller than in 2016, but to \ncounter prevailing uncertainty the government plans to frontload \nbudgetary outlays this year such that over 30% of spending is in \nthe \ufb01rst quarter, targeting job creation and the completion of public \ninfrastructure projects. Government expenditures are projected to \nincrease by 3.7% as revenues grow by 6.0%, so the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is \nprojected to shrink to 1.7% of GDP in 2017 from 2.4% in 2016. Given \nample \ufb01scal resources, authorities are likely to draw a supplementary \nbudget if economic conditions deteriorate in the second half of the year. \nThe rise in consumer in\ufb02ation above 2.0% in January 2017 for the \n\ufb01rst time in 51 months indicates that in\ufb02ation will be higher this year. \nIt is forecast to average 1.7% as global commodity prices rise and 1.8% \nnext year as domestic demand recovers. As a huge importer of oil, \nhowever, the ROK is vulnerable to unexpected movements in global \noil prices, as is this forecast. \n\nAn expansionary monetary policy will likely continue despite rising \n\nconcerns about high household debt (Figure 3.11.8). Benign in\ufb02ation \nis allowing the central bank to maintain low interest rates, thereby \nsupporting mortgage and property markets and borrowers\u2019 capacity to \nmeet repayments. \n\nHigher exports are forecast for the coming 2 years. After contracting \n\nin all but 1 of 21 months running, exports to the PRC began to rise in \nNovember 2016, and total exports grew by double digits in January \nand February 2017. These trends and expected higher growth in the \nadvanced economies\u2014especially the US, the second largest trading \npartner after the PRC\u2014indicate that recent export momentum is likely \nto be sustained. As with exports, imports have started to pick up after \nan extended period of decline, partly re\ufb02ecting higher oil prices, and are \nexpected to rise further as growth improves. On balance, the current \naccount surplus is forecast to narrow to the equivalent of 5.8% of GDP in \n2017 and 5.3% in 2018.\n\nThe forecast faces a number of downside risks. First, the continued \nappreciation of the ROK won, which rose by 6.7% against the US dollar \nin the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017, will be bad news for exporters on top \nof growing trade policy uncertainty in the US. Second, upward price \npressures are building and may push in\ufb02ation beyond the forecast rate \nat a time when, according to some estimates, actual output appears to \nbe trailing potential output by a widening margin, raising the specter of \n\n3.11.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2.5\n\n1.7\n\n5.8\n\n2.7\n\n1.8\n\n5.3\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.11.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Bank of Korea, Economic Statistics System,  \nhttp://ecos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp (accessed\u00a014 February \n2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.7\u2002Business and consumer confidence\n\nBusiness con\ufb01dence\nConsumer con\ufb01dence\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: A reading below 100 means that more respondents \nanswered negatively than positively. \nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistic System, http://\necos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp (accessed\u00a01\u00a0March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.8\u2002Household debt to GDP\n\nQ1\n2012\n\nQ3 Q1\n2013\n\nQ3 Q1\n2014\n\nQ3 Q1\n2015\n\nQ3 Q1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Bank of Korea, Economics Statistic System, http://\necos.bok.or.kr/EIndex_en.jsp (accessed\u00a01\u00a0March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nIndex\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n%\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n\n70\n\n65\n\n60\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nRepublic of Korea\u2002\u2002167\n\nstag\ufb02ation (Figure 3.11.9). Third, persistent political uncertainty could \nundercut growth. A unanimous court verdict in March 2017 to remove \nthe President could pave the way for political stability to return, but the \nresulting snap election could be highly contentious, delaying its return \nuntil a new government is formed. While policy paralysis is unlikely, \nan unsettled political situation would dent business and consumer \ncon\ufb01dence. Further, geopolitical risks arise with provocations from the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, which test \ufb01red ballistic missiles \nin February and March 2017. \n\nAn upside risk to the forecast is export recovery that is more \nrobust than forecast, especially if growth gains momentum globally \nand in particular in the US. On the ROK domestic front, a smooth and \norderly resolution of the political crisis would likely improve business \nand consumer con\ufb01dence, strengthening domestic demand more \nthan forecast. The balance of risks tilts to the downside with growth \nunderperforming, but the government has ample \ufb01scal resources \nto respond.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014coping with uncertainty  \nin US trade policy\nAs the US is an important export market, taking 13.4% of ROK exports \nin 2016, a more restrictive trade policy there could have major adverse \nimplications (Figure 3.11.10). The number of US trade measures recently \ntargeting ROK exporters totaled 2,025 before the latest US election, \nso any hint of further US policy change heightens concerns for the ROK \neconomy (Figure 3.11.11).\n\nThe most immediate and direct impact of US policy change would \n\nbe felt through lower exports to the US. However, ROK \ufb01rms may \nbe hurt indirectly by new US policy change against other countries. \nMost crucially, trade friction between the US and the PRC would crimp \nROK exports to the latter, which are mostly intermediate goods used \nin products that the PRC assembles and exports to the US. Further, the \nimpending renegotiation of North American Free Trade Area agreement \nwith Canada and Mexico could restrict or increase the cost of access \nto the US markets for goods originating in Mexico, causing losses for \nROK \ufb01rms that invested in Mexico for its easy access to the US market. \nThese investments grew to $5.5 billion annually in 2015.\n\nThe persistent ROK trade surplus with the US, which has exceeded \n\n$20 billion every year since 2013, could place the KORUS Free Trade \nAgreement (FTA), concluded between the US and the ROK in 2012, \namong those targeted for renegotiation. The FTA eliminated 95% of the \ntariffs between the two markets and created additional protections for \n\ufb01nancial and other service \ufb01rms. The KORUS FTA is the largest FTA \nthe US has in Asia and one of the two largest for the ROK, the other \nbeing with the European Union. Given substantial opposition to the FTA \nbefore it was agreed\u2014not only from US \ufb01rms but also on the ROK side, \nnotably from farmers\u2014renegotiation could spell the end of it. \n\nA preliminary empirical analysis found that annual ROK exports \nto the US would fall by as much as $13 billion in 2017\u20132020, at the cost \n\n3.11.9\u2002GDP gap and consumer inflation\n\nGDP gap\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n%\n\n18\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n%\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\n$ billion\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\nSource: Hyundai Research Institute.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.10\u2002 Exports to and trade surplus \nwith the United States\n\nExports to the US\nTrade surplus with the US\n\nUS share of exports\n\nStart of KORUS FTA \n\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2012\n\n2016\n\nKORUS FTA = free trade agreement between the Republic \nof Korea and the United States.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 February 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.11.11\u2002 US trade measures affecting \n\nROK exports\n\nTechnical barriers to trade\nSanitary and phytosanitary\nSafeguards, including special safeguards\nOthers\n\n2,124\n\n2,025\n\nNumber\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n809\n\nClinton\nJan 1993\u2013Jan 2001\n\nBush\nJan 2001\u2013Jan 2009\n\nObama\nJan 2009\u2013Jan 2017\n\nNote: Others include antidumping, countervailing \nmeasures, export subsidies, quantitative restrictions, \nand\u00a0tariff quotas.\nSource: World Trade Organization, Integrated Trade \nIntelligence Portal. https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/\nstatis_e/itip_e.htm (accessed 9 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f168\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2016\n\nof 127,000 jobs in the ROK, if the KORUS FTA collapsed (Table 3.11.2). \nThe average yearly export loss of $3.3 billion equals 5% of ROK exports \nto the US in 2016. Further, a 10% drop in the PRC exports to the US \nwould cause a 1.5% drop in ROK exports to the PRC. The combined \nimpact of restrictive policies targeting the ROK and the PRC would \nlower ROK export proceeds by $5.2 billion, or 1% of the total in 2016.\n\nEffectively meeting the potential challenge of US policy uncertainty \n\nrequires three sets of policies. First, government and industry can \ntake preventive action together to reduce trade friction and prepare \nfor any policy change that nevertheless materializes. To this end, the \ngovernment announced in late January plans to expand imports from \nthe US. However, industries that are likely to be hit hard by annulment \nof the KORUS FTA, such as autos, electronics, and machinery, should \nprepare strategic contingency plans to comply with possible new trade \nregulations and develop new export markets. \n\nSecond, policy makers should closely monitor domestic \ufb01nancial \nmarket instability associated with mounting uncertainty regarding \nUS trade and other economic policies. In light of the highly open capital \naccount in the ROK, potentially volatile foreign capital \ufb02ows are of \nparticular interest. The ROK has adequate buffers to mitigate the impact \nof large capital out\ufb02ows, but the authorities must be prepared to act \npromptly to dispel any concerns about the balance of payments. \n\nThird, ROK policy makers can actively explore ways to extend \nthe two countries\u2019 robust security alliance into the economic arena. \nAn effective approach to defusing trade frictions would be to negotiate \na broad economic partnership that brings together the government, \nindustry, and other stakeholders in both countries. This task would be \nenormously complicated, but achieving such a partnership would be \nwell worth the effort.\n\n3.11.2\u2002 Projected export and employment \nlosses with KORUS FTA annulment\n\nDecline in \nexports to the \nUS ($ billion)\n\nDecline in \nemployment\n(1,000)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nTotal\n\nAverage\n\n3.09\n\n3.20\n\n3.31\n\n3.42\n\n13.01\n\n3.25\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n127\n\n32\n\nKORUS FTA = free trade agreement between the \nRepublic of Korea and the United States.\nNote: The projections are based on empirical analysis \nthat assumes that United States tariffs on goods \nfrom the Republic of Korea revert to levels before the \nKORUS FTA.\nSource: Hyundai Research Institute. \n\n\fMongolia\n\nGrowth  will  accelerate  this  year  on  large  mining  investments,  then  moderate  in  2018  as  coal \nproduction  reaches  full  capacity.

GDP \ngrowth fell by 6.2% in the third quarter, but the economy recovered \nin the fourth quarter as an unexpected hike in coal prices prompted a \nsteep increase in coal production. This lifted growth in transportation \nand storage services, raising the service sector contribution to growth to \n0.8 percentage points (Figure 3.12.1). Agriculture added 0.6 percentage \npoints as livestock herds grew despite a harsh winter. However, \ncontinued decline in construction by 15.9%\u2014the result of oversupply \ncaused by lending subsidized by the Bank of Mongolia, the central \nbank\u2014dragged down industrial output, subtracting 0.4 percentage \npoints from GDP growth. \n\nExternal demand was the driver of growth in 2016. Exports rose \nby 14.7% as coal and gold exports surged (Figure 3.12.2). With imports \nrising more slowly, net exports grew, adding 1.3 percentage points to \nGDP growth (Figure 3.12.3). Meanwhile, domestic demand dragged on \ngrowth. Consumption contracted by 5.5%, subtracting 3.9 percentage \npoints from growth, as household spending slumped because of lower \nagricultural incomes as meat prices fell, and because of lower wages \nand salaries with downsizing in construction and transport, which \ntogether provide 10.6% of employment. Meanwhile, gross capital \nformation reversed the falling trend of the previous 2 years to increase \nby 14.3% as restocking of inventories surged, adding 3.6 percentage \npoints to growth. \n\nAverage consumer price in\ufb02ation fell to 1.1% in 2016 as meat prices \ndropped by 8.2% on higher supply resulting from the accelerated culling \nof cattle.

Revenue meanwhile slid \nby 2.2% on lower income tax receipts to equal 24.5% of GDP. The \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit widened to 15.4% of GDP. However, including off-budget \ngovernment expenditure \ufb01nanced by loans from the Development Bank \nof Mongolia, the de\ufb01cit soared to 17.7% of GDP. Interest payments on \ngovernment bonds accounted for more than 10% of total expenditure \nin 2016, a jump from 1% in 2010. Total public debt including the \ncentral bank\u2019s foreign liabilities reached the equivalent of 111% of GDP \n(Figure 3.12.5). As debt rose, the Fiscal Stability Law was amended \nagain in 2016 to lift the government debt ceiling from 55% of GDP to \n88%, with the requirement that it should be gradually lowered to 60% \nby 2021. \n\n The togrog depreciated sharply in the face of balance-of-payment \n\npressures, prompting the central bank to terminate all off-budget \nactivities except for the subsidized mortgage program and to raise the \npolicy rate by 450 basis points to 15% in August (since then reduced \nto 14%). Nevertheless, net domestic credit increased by 15.0% in 2016. \nIn addition, through its practice of purchasing gold from the local \nmining companies, the central bank added to domestic liquidity. Broad \nmoney (M2) rose by 10.4% in the year. \n\nRapid credit growth without strict bank supervision or adequate \nreserve provisioning has eroded the quality of bank assets, undermining \ntheir soundness. The nonperforming loan rate has doubled since 2014, \nreaching 7% of all loans outstanding at the end of 2016 (Figure 3.12.6).\nThe current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to 4.0% of GDP by the end of \nthe year as the merchandise trade balance improved. Foreign borrowing \nat high cost staved off the risk of a crisis in the balance of payments, \nbut it added to the problem of long-term debt sustainability. The current \naccount de\ufb01cit has been \ufb01nanced increasingly by external borrowing \nowing to capital \ufb02ight and plummeting foreign direct investment. \nThus, net foreign assets declined by 19.5% to a liability of $3.2 billion. \nHowever, gross international reserves remained unchanged at \n$1.3 billion at the end of 2016, supported by external borrowing.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe outlook is for improvement enabled by higher commodity prices, \nthe successful re\ufb01nancing of a $580 million bond in March 2017, and the \nexpected approval of an economic adjustment program supported by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the international community \nat large. Continued efforts by the new government to preserve economic \nand social stability remain key. Growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.5% \nthis year but moderate slightly to 2.0% in 2018 on the base effect of the \nsurge in coal production in 2017 (Figure 3.12.7). The forecast assumes \nthat investment in the second phase of the Oyu Tolgoi mine will rise \nfrom $200 million last year to $1.0 billion in 2017 and $1.2 billion in \n2018. However, large household debt and income contraction will \ndepress household consumption, and \ufb01scal consolidation will drastically \nreduce public capital expenditure and some transfers. Net exports will \nadd to growth in 2017 as strong momentum in coal exports continues \n\n3.12.3\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investments\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2017. \nMonthly Statistical Bulletin.

Steady growth in livestock \nwill be the major driver of growth in agriculture, while services will \nbene\ufb01t from higher demand for transport and storage from rising coal \nexports and imports for Oyu Tolgoi. Construction will likely remain \n\ufb02at as the increase in mining-related construction offsets an expected \nreduction in subsidized mortgage lending, following the reformulation \nof the program by the new government. As coal production reaches full \ncapacity in 2017, growth in 2018 will be driven by steady expansion in \nagriculture and services, as well as a pickup in construction. \n\nAverage in\ufb02ation will rise to 3.5% in 2017 and 3.9% in 2018 as prices \n\nfor imported goods increase when converted into a weaker currency \n(Figure 3.12.8). Fuel prices will edge higher as excise taxes are raised, \nbut meat prices are expected to remain stable on the combined effect of \nimproved supply and the depletion of government reserves.\n\nFiscal policy will be less expansionary during the forecast period. \nThe budget under the proposed revision targets a de\ufb01cit equal to 8.8% \nof GDP in 2017. Monetary policy will also be less expansionary this year \nand the next. Money supply growth must halve in 2017 from 2016 to \nremain consistent with macroeconomic objectives agreed under the \nIMF program.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit will narrow to 2.1% of GDP in 2017 \non strong coal exports but widen again to 6.3% in 2018 as imports \ncontinue to expand while exports stabilize. The expected larger in\ufb02ows \nevidenced from a pickup in foreign direct investment at the end of 2016 \nwill ease pressure on the balance of payments.\n\nDownside risks to the outlook derive from uncertainty regarding \n\nmacroeconomic management. Borrowing options will narrow, and \ncosts will rise, if debt obligations are not met, or in the absence of a \n\ufb01rm commitment to policy reform or agreement on the IMF program, \nor if there is slippage in program implementation. Any of these risks \nwould necessitate additional \ufb01scal retrenchment and weaken growth. \nThe proliferation of nonperforming loans presents another risk to the \noutlook as it can threaten \ufb01nancial stability.

At the same time, the \neconomy is subject to the boom-and-bust cycles that commonly affect \ncommodity-dependent economies.

Indeed, revenue management has not brought \nwealth accumulation but rather rising public debt. In a new effort, \nthe government established the Fiscal Stability Fund in 2010 to manage \ncommodity boom-and-bust cycles and the Future Heritage Fund in 2017 \nto set aside funds for future generations. \n\nFor this new effort to succeed, the extractive sector must yield \n\nmore \ufb01scal revenues. These revenues, which include mainly royalty \npayments and exploration and permit fees, have averaged over the \npast 5 years less than 3% of GDP or 10% of revenue (Figure 3.12.9). \nBy comparison, other resource-rich economies in the region such as \nMalaysia and Kazakhstan collect almost 10% of GDP. Receipts from \ntaxes on mining company pro\ufb01ts are likely to increase as commodity \nprices trend up during the forecast period. However, sizeable increases \nin mineral-related \ufb01scal revenues require both changes in arrangements \nfor the royalties, fees, and taxes, which may be politically difficult to \nadopt, and improved efficiency in tax collection and the elimination of \ntax avoidance. Further resources can be raised for the two funds by \nallocating to them a portion of \ufb01scal revenues unconnected with mining, \nwhich are well above 25% of GDP in Mongolia, or more than double the \nusual percentage in countries with similar income.\n\ncommodity exporters are prone to pro-cyclical policies especially if \nbooms are caused by high world commodity prices. The Fiscal Stability \nLaw was expected to discourage pro-cyclical policies by limiting the \nbudget\u2019s structural de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 2% of GDP. However, the \nrule has not been enforced, and off-budget spending has provided a way \naround it. \n\nFuture Heritage Fund resources including accumulated pro\ufb01t and \n\ninterest should be considered a replacement for natural resources as \nthey become depleted. They should be used in the meantime only \nin extreme emergencies. The current requirement that 10% of fund \npro\ufb01ts be automatically transferred to the budget creates a loophole for \ntheir depletion, as does the use of fund resources for social transfers. \nBoth practices should be avoided. Regarding the Fiscal Stability Fund, \nclear rules are needed to govern its use to smooth expenditures over \nboom and bust years. Transfers to the budget should be allowed only \nif budgetary resources prove inadequate to meet nondiscretionary \nexpenditure. \n\nThe overarching condition required for the successful management of \n\nthese funds is a budgeting process with assured integrity. This requires, \nmost crucially, that the annual budget include all government payment \nobligations and be prepared taking into account medium-term \nmacroeconomic objectives. Further, Fiscal Stability Law ceilings must be \nrespected and off-budget expenditure avoided.\n\n3.12.8\u2002Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nTotal revenues & grants\nMining revenue\n\n% of GDP\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Mining revenue includes receipts from taxes on \npro\ufb01ts, other taxes on large price increases for exported \nminerals, exploration and mining permit fees, and royalties.\nSource: Ministry of Finance. http://www.mof.gov.mn \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nIt is crucial to avoid pro-cyclical \ufb01scal policies. Studies show that \n\n3.12.9\u2002Revenue by economic classification\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nEconomic  growth  accelerated  in  2016,  inflation  rose,  and  the  current  account  surplus  narrowed. \nGrowth  will  likely  accelerate  further  in  2017  and  2018  on  higher  government  and  private \nexpenditure.  Inflation  will  trend  downward  on  lower  food  prices,  and  the  current  account  surplus \nwill  narrow  further  on  rising  imports.  A  well-designed  incentive  scheme  is  needed  to  attract \ninnovative  enterprises  with  strong  potential  for  job  creation.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth doubled to 1.5% in 2016 as domestic spending grew \n(Figure 3.13.1). Private consumption remained the main driver of \ngrowth, rising by 2.1% mainly on higher fuel and car purchases to \ncontribute 1.2 percentage points to GDP. Government consumption \nadded another 0.4 percentage points to growth, as did total investment \n(Figure 3.13.2). Exports declined in the \ufb01rst half of the year owing \nto tepid external demand but rebounded in the second half to record \n2.1% annual growth as semiconductor market conditions improved \nand international prices for agricultural and raw materials increased. \nHowever, as imports expanded more rapidly, net exports subtracted \n0.7 percentage points from GDP growth.\n\nOn the supply side, industry and services drove growth. Rising \nmanufacturing output propelled growth in industry to 1.9%, adding \n0.7 percentage points to GDP growth. Semiconductor production rose \nsigni\ufb01cantly on higher demand for use in smart technology products \nand as technological advances in Taipei,China made its semiconductors \nmore competitive. Services grew by 1.3% on rising tourist arrivals, \nadding 0.8 percentage points to growth. The year nevertheless saw \ngrowth in tourist arrivals slow by more than half from 2015, with a \ndrop in visitors from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) only partly \ncompensated by higher arrivals from Japan, Southeast Asia, and the US \n(Figure 3.13.3). Agriculture contracted by 6.9% because of unfavorable \nweather, subtracting 0.1 percentage points from growth.\n\nThe consumer price index rose by 1.4% year on year in 2016, pushed \n\nup by food price in\ufb02ation as agriculture stagnated (Figure 3.13.4). \nCore in\ufb02ation, which excludes food and energy, rose to 0.6%, but \nwholesale price de\ufb02ation persisted until late in the year. Responding to \ntame in\ufb02ation and slow growth, the central bank cut the discount rate in \ntwo steps from 1.625% in February to 1.375% in July.

Since 2014, the government \nhas pursued expenditure and revenue reform to raise tax revenue, \nreduce the ratio of the de\ufb01cit to GDP, and ensure that debt does not \ngrow faster than the average GDP growth rate over the previous 3 years. \nRe\ufb02ecting these policies, the ratio of outstanding government debt to \nnominal GDP decreased from 34.1% in 2012 to 31.5% in 2016. \n\nThe current account surplus narrowed to 13.4% of GDP in 2016 \nfrom 14.3% in the previous year owing to slippage in the trade surplus \nand lower net service receipts (Figure 3.13.5). This, together with \ncontraction in the capital and \ufb01nancial account, narrowed the overall \nbalance of payments surplus. Gross reserves decreased by 29% to \n$10.7 billion. The local dollar depreciated by 1.3% against the US dollar \nbut appreciated by 10.0% against the renminbi, partly because of capital \nrepatriated from the PRC by investors in Taipei,China. In real effective \nterms, the local dollar appreciated by 1.8%. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 1.8% in 2017 and 2.2% in 2018 \non major public infrastructure investments, robust private consumption, \nand rising private investment. The National Development Council is \npreparing what it calls a \u201cforward-looking infrastructure investment \nprogram\u201d with private sector participation. Even including planned \nspending under this multiyear NT$1 trillion program, the budget de\ufb01cit \nwill rise to only 0.8% of GDP in 2017. Government debt at a sound 31.5% \nof GDP leaves substantial \ufb01nances for higher expenditure to further \nboost the economy.\n\nThe implementation of the government\u2019s proposed new industrial \n\npolicy is expected to energize private investment. Under this policy, \nseven major innovative industries have been selected as the core \ngroup to lead growth through innovation and high technology. \nThe programs for the defense and recycling industries have yet to be \n\ufb01nalized, but those for the smart machinery industry and Asian Silicon \nValley, which aspires to turn the island into an innovative startup \ndestination for young Asians, have been prepared, as have the programs \nfor green energy technology, the biotech industry, and industrial \nagriculture, which aims to boost value added to agricultural products \nand services. The plans include measures to create an enabling \nenvironment, especially through appropriate regulation, and to attract \ninternational talent.\n\nEncouraged by the industrial policy initiative, private investment \nwill remain robust in 2017 and 2018. The manufacturing purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index for January 2017 signaled strong future expansion. \nInvestment in the airline and semiconductor industries will be especially \nstrong, the latter driven by the sharp increase in semiconductor exports. \nNew investments in innovative \ufb01nancial technology are expected from \nmajor foreign banks. Private consumption expenditure should rise \nin 2017 and 2018, bene\ufb01ting from optimism about government policies \nand ongoing consumer subsidy programs such as a car-purchase and \ntrade-in program running at least until the end of 2017. \n\n3.13.3\u2002 Tourist arrivals\n\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n\nPercentage growth\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\u20136\n\n\u201312\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\nPRC\n\nHKG\n& MAC\n\nJPN ASEAN US\n\nTotal\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, HKG \n= Hong Kong, China, JPN = Japan, MAC = Macau, China, \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, US = United States.\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.13.4\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nWholesale price index\nCore\n\n% change, year on year\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.13.5\u2002Current account indicators\n\nIncome balance\nGoods & services balance\nTransfers balance\n\nCurrent account\nbalance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nTaipei,China\u2002\u2002175\n\n3.13.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n1.8\n\n1.3\n\n6.8\n\n2.2\n\n1.2\n\n6.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.13.6\u2002Export orders\n\nOverall\nUnited States\nPRC & Hong Kong, China \nJapan\nEurope\nASEAN-6\n\n% change, year on year\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201345\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nASEAN-6 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nmembers Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nThailand, and Viet Nam, PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof\u00a0China.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nExports are expected to increase this year and next on strong \ndemand for semiconductor components, especially for PRC branded \nmobile phones (Figure 3.13.6). Rising commodity prices and low base year \neffects are other factors. Ongoing substitution in the PRC of imports with \nhigh value added, replacing them with alternatives produced in the PRC, \nmay moderate growth in Taipei,China exports in 2018. \n\nImports by export-oriented industries and the airline industry will \nshow a corresponding increase in both years, while terms of trade are \nlikely to deteriorate as prices for imports recover from sharp declines \nsince 2015. The trade surplus is thus likely to trend downward, and \nnet exports to make only a small contribution to GDP growth in both \nyears. The current account surplus will likely shrink because exports \nof services are not expected to compensate for the lower surplus in \ngoods trade.\n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to trend slightly lower to 1.3% in 2017 and 1.2% \nin 2018. Food price pressures caused by bad weather and the low base \neffect for the oil price will diminish, tamping down the impact of rising \ndomestic spending supported by mildly expansionary \ufb01scal policy and \nlow interest rates. The local dollar is expected to remain stable against \nthe US dollar but appreciate slightly against the renminbi during the \nforecast period. \n\nExternal risks to the outlook are a surprisingly steep slowdown \nin the PRC, trade tensions caused by rising protectionism, and strong \nlocal dollar appreciation, particularly against the renminbi. To mitigate \nthe risk of protectionism, Taipei,China intends to diversify its economic \nties. The government has announced its New Southbound Policy, \naiming to foster with neighboring economies closer economic and trade \nrelations, scienti\ufb01c and technological cooperation, and the sharing of \nresources, talent, and markets. The main domestic risk to the forecast \nis the possible effect on consumption if forthcoming pension reform \ngenerates short-term uncertainty about bene\ufb01ts. The reform program, \nto be presented to the legislature in May 2017, aims to unify 13 pension \nschemes into a single plan that introduces portable accounts to improve \njob mobility.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014encouraging innovative \nentrepreneurship\nRelatively low GDP growth rates, at 0.7% in 2015 and 1.5% last year, \nindicate that Taipei,China needs to raise productivity to boost growth. \nThis is what the government\u2019s new industrial policy intends to do. \nThe policy aligns with the \ufb01ndings of several studies indicating that \nproductivity can be improved by encouraging innovative entrepreneurs \n(Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge on page 47). The entry of \nnew enterprises encourages innovation through so-called \u201ccreative \ndestruction.\u201d New \ufb01rms have been found to engage in radical innovation \nto boost growth in total factor productivity. Further, older \ufb01rms, \nespecially in high-technology industries, innovate more intensively \nwhen facing competition from new \ufb01rms.\n\n\f176\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nResearch has documented that high-income economies experience \n\nmore innovative entrepreneurship than do lower-income economies. \nThat is, high-income economies such as Taipei,China tend to have a \nhigher ratio of opportunity-driven entrepreneurs who believe their \nproducts or services are new to the market. However, the same \nrelationship does not necessarily exist when income differentials are \nreplaced by growth rates. Some evidence to this effect is provided by \nthe Global Entrepreneurship Monitor dataset, a global survey of adults \naged 18\u201364. This dataset does not show signi\ufb01cant correlation between \nthe proportion of the cohort population who are entrepreneurs or \nowners of new businesses and the growth rate. However, it does \ufb01nd \npositive correlation between the proportion of entrepreneurs who \nexpect to create six or more jobs within 5 years and the growth rate. \nThus, in analyzing innovative entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs should \nnot be treated as a homogeneous group but differentiated according to \ntheir motivations or expectations regarding job creation. \n\nThese data are presented in Figure 3.13.7. The plot groups middle-\n\nincome and high-income economies into low-growth and high-growth \ncategories. The four groups are plotted against the percentage of \nentrepreneurs who expect to create six or more jobs in 5 years, or \njob creator share (JCS). Each box-and-whiskers plot indicates the range \nof JCS in each category of economy. The plot shows that high-income \neconomies tend to have a higher JCS and that, in the high-income group, \nthe high-growth group has a higher JCS than the low-growth group. \nAlso, there is a much narrower job-creation gap between high- and \nlow-growth economies in the middle-income group than between the \nhigh- and low-growth economies in the high-income group, implying \na lower correlation between JCS and growth rates in middle-income \neconomies.\n\nWhile this correlation analysis does not indicate the direction \nof causality\u2014that is, whether higher income or higher growth leads \nto a higher JCS, or the other way around\u2014these results provide \nsome indication that nurturing new \ufb01rms that have concrete plans \nfor creating jobs is a promising means of improving productivity. \nThus, in implementing its new industrial policy, Taipei,China should \ngive priority to providing incentives for those start-ups that have \nconcrete and realistic plans to create jobs.\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n3.13.7\u2002 Growth and entrepreneurs\u2019 \n\njob creation expectations\n\nPercentage of entrepreneurs who expect to \ncreate 6 or more jobs in 5 years\n\nTAP 2011\n\nTAP 2012\n\nTAP 2013\n\nTAP 2014\n\n1\nLow \ngrowth,\nmiddle \nincome\n\n2\nHigh\ngrowth,\nmiddle\nincome\n\n3\nLow\ngrowth,\nhigh\nincome\n\n4\nHigh\ngrowth,\nhigh\nincome\n\nTAP = Taipei,China.\nNote: Vertical lines show in each category the whole range \nof job creator share, the percentage of entrepreneurs who \nexpect to create six or more jobs in 5 years, omitting the \noutliers.

Daunting \nchallenges  weigh  on  public  confidence:  an  increasingly  aggressive  insurgency,  a  fragile  political \nenvironment,  and  weak  institutions.  The  year  saw  progress  in  strengthening  public  finances, \nand  development  partners  reaffirmed  their  financial  support.  The  outlook  is  for  modest  growth \nimprovement  even  as  an  expected  surge  of  refugees  brings  new  difficulties.\n\nEconomic performance \nA challenging political and security environment continued to affect \neconomic activity in 2016. Growth is estimated to have accelerated \nfrom 0.8% in 2015 to 2.0% in 2016 (Figure 3.14.1). After falling by 5.7% \nin 2015, agriculture recovered and contributed to the revival in GDP \ngrowth. Growth in industry and services slowed because of pessimism \nacross investors, the business community, and the general public. \nOn the demand side, there was no improvement in private investment \nin 2016. Public investment grew slightly as the government struggled to \nimprove its execution of a larger development budget. Weak investor and \nconsumer con\ufb01dence re\ufb02ects an increasingly difficult security situation \nand protracted uncertainty in the political environment. Other major \nconstraints retarding investment and business development are an \ninadequate business regulatory framework, lack of basic infrastructure, \nand limited access to \ufb01nancial services and utilities. \n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the United Nations Office on \nDrugs and Crime, the area under opium cultivation increased by 10% \nin 2016. Most cultivation took place in the southeast and west as opium \nproduction rose to 4,800 tons in 2016, up by 45.5% from 3,300 tons in \n2015. Opium prices also rose and, with higher production, increased the \nfarm value of production in 2016 by 58% to $900 million, equal to 5% of \nGDP, from $570 million in 2015.\n\nIn\ufb02ation increased sharply from January to December 2016, mainly \nre\ufb02ecting some recovery in global commodity prices. Headline consumer \nin\ufb02ation increased in December 2016 to 4.5% year on year from 1.1% in \nDecember 2015 (Figure 3.14.2). Food prices increased by 5.8% in 2016, \naccelerating from 0.8% in 2015 on higher prices for meat, spices, \nvegetables, sugar, and sweets. Nonfood in\ufb02ation rose to 3.4% from 1.4% \nin 2015, primarily on higher prices for tobacco, clothing, household \ngoods and furnishings, education, and health services. Average in\ufb02ation \nwas 4.5%, reversing 1.5% de\ufb02ation in 2015, when global prices for oil and \nother commodities plunged. \n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n%\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\u20136\n\nThis chapter was written by Rehman Gul of the Afghanistan Resident Mission, ADB, Kabul.\n\n3.14.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n11.4\n\n3.9\n\n1.3\n\n0.8 2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.14.2\u2002Inflation\n\nHeadline\nFood\nNonfood\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: Central Statistical Office for primary data; \nADB estimates for headline, food, and nonfood in\ufb02ation. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nAfghanistan\u2002\u2002179\n\nRevenue collection was a success story in 2016.

Development budget execution remained weak, however, \nas only 55% of the 2016 appropriation was spent, unchanged from that \nin 2015. Expenditure nevertheless increased in 2016 by AF10.1 billion \nto AF93.0 billion. The overall budget showed a modest surplus equal to \n1.6% of GDP as official grants funded 63% of expenditure, up from 56% \nin 2015. \n\nBroad money (M2) expanded by 7.5% in 2016, and reserve money \nby 10.0%. The expansions re\ufb02ected an increase in net foreign assets \nacquired through a strong current account surplus. Monetary policy was \naccommodative and credit to the private sector increased by 10% despite \nthe weak economy and a prevailing lack of con\ufb01dence. \n\nThe current account including current transfers is estimated to \nhave sustained a surplus equal to 4.4% of GDP as high official transfers \ncontinued to generate sales of goods and services (Figure 3.14.4). Gross \ninternational reserves increased to $7.5 billion from $7.0 billion in 2015 \n(Figure 3.14.5). The afghani was broadly stable against the US dollar \nin 2016, appreciating by about 1% during the year following a 17% fall \nin 2015, when gross reserves fell by $300 million on strong demand for \nforeign currency from people wishing to emigrate (Figure 3.14.6). \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is projected to grow by 2.5% in 2017 and 3.0% in 2018. \nThe growth projections are based on favorable weather, a modest \nrecovery for industry and services, continued improvement in domestic \nrevenue collection and support from development partners, structural \nreform under the International Monetary Fund extended credit facility, \nand other reforms to improve governance and public administration \nand \ufb01ght corruption. Poverty will persist, however, because of low labor \ndemand, the many people internally displaced by insurgent activity, \nand a rapidly growing number of returning refugees\u2014mainly from \nPakistan but also Iran and, to a much lesser extent, those who sought to \nemigrate to Europe. Because refugee numbers are projected to increase \nsigni\ufb01cantly in 2017, the United Nations has appealed for $240 million in \nhumanitarian assistance to help them.\n\nTo restore investor con\ufb01dence, business regulation must be \nimproved, especially for extractive industries. While growth in \nagriculture is expected to be slight because of capacity limits, growth in \nindustry and services is projected to strengthen steadily. Afghanistan\u2019s \naccession to the World Trade Organization in July 2016 and the \nimplementation of national and regional infrastructure projects such as \nSalma Dam in Herat Province and Chabahar Port in Iran are expected \nto contribute to growth and expand trade through better connectivity. \nFiscal policy will continue to pursue improved revenue collection \n\nand budget execution to improve development expenditure. Budget \nexpenditure is projected to increase with high security spending and \nlarger expenditure to deliver public services to an enlarging population. \nGovernment \ufb01nances including grants will likely remain balanced \n\nDomestic revenues\nGrants\nCurrent expenditures\nCapital expenditures\nOverall balance\n\n%\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n% of GDP\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n\u201360\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund Country Reports; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.14.4\u2002Current account balance\n\nExcluding official grants\nIncluding official grants\n\n8.7\n\n3.9\n\n2.4\n\n4.7\n\n4.4\n\n1.4\n\n\u20130.2\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund Country Report \nNo. 14/128, May 2014 for 2012; International Monetary \nFund Country Report No. 15/234, November 2015 for  \n2013\u20132015; World Bank for 2016\u20132018.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.14.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2.5\n\n5.5\n\n1.4\n\n3.0\n\n5.8\n\n\u20130.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n\f$ billion\n\n8.0\n\n7.5\n\n7.0\n\n6.5\n\n6.0\n\nAF/$\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n3.14.5\u2002International reserves\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: Da Afghanistan Bank. http://www.centralbank \n.gov.af/ (accessed 20 March 2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.14.6\u2002Nominal exchange rate\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: Da Afghanistan Bank. http://www.centralbank.\ngov.af/ (accessed 20 March 2017); ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n180\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nin the next 2 years as development partners continue to fund 62% of \nboth recurrent and development expenditures. The ratio of domestic \nrevenue to recurrent spending, an indicator of \ufb01scal sustainability, \nis projected to slow slightly to 55.0% by 2018 from 58.3% in 2016. \nHowever, \ufb01scal outcomes in the medium-term will depend on in\ufb02ows \nfrom development partners.\n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation is forecast at 5.5% in 2017 and 5.8% in 2018 as \n\nglobal commodity prices rise gradually and demand increases with \nreturning refugees. The forecast assumes prudent monetary and \nexchange rate policies and favorable harvests. The government will \nmaintain its managed \ufb02oat of the afghani to keep prices reasonable and \nprevent undue afghani volatility as the uncertain political and security \nsituation exerts downward pressure on the currency. \n\nThe current account surplus including transfers is projected to \nshrink to the equivalent of 1.4% of GDP in 2017 and swing to a de\ufb01cit of \n0.2% in 2018. This re\ufb02ects some reduction in current transfers that will \nreduce domestic demand and opportunities for employment, as well as \nbusiness sales of goods and services.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014better execution  \nof the development budget\nAfghanistan has struggled to execute its development budget since \ndevelopment partners returned after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. \nThe development budget covers spending on physical, economic, and \nsocial infrastructure. Infrastructure and natural resources occupy \n55% of the development budget, followed by agriculture and rural \ndevelopment with a 16% share in 2016. Budget execution rates have \nvaried from 30% to 60% in recent years and differed widely for various \ncomponents. In 2016, health utilization was, at 73%, the highest \naccomplished rate among budget sector allocations larger than 2% \n(Figure 3.14.7). Infrastructure and natural resources recorded the \nlowest execution rate, at 44%, because poor utilization of development \nbudget allocations has been a policy issue of long standing.\n\nDevelopment expenditure for infrastructure and natural resources \n\nin particular feeds directly into economic growth, job creation, and \npoverty reduction. Hence, improving the rate of development spending \nis critical. More rapid development of infrastructure would enable \ngreater private investment, support growth, and boost employment.\nThe economic impact of increased capital expenditure would be \nhigh. The approved development budget was $2.6 billion in FY2016, \nequal to 14.2% of GDP, but the 54% execution rate diminished spending \nto $1.4 billion, or 7.1% of GDP. An execution rate approaching 100% \nwould certainly accelerate growth and bring forward project assistance \npledged by development partners to speed development. \n\nBesides insecurity, the key impediment to better development \nexpenditure execution is low capacity\u2014in project identi\ufb01cation and \ndesign, project costing, \ufb01nancial planning, procurement planning and \ncontracting, and managing the implementation of large projects and \ntheir complex procurement contracts. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nAfghanistan\u2002\u2002181\n\n100.0\n\n3.14.7\u2002 Development budget execution \n\nby sector, 2016\n\nShare of total budget allocation\nExecution of the budget allocation\n\n   Total development\nbudget/expenditures\n\nEconomics\n\nSocial protection\n\nAgriculture and\nrural development\n\nHealth\n\nEducation\n\n4.3\n\n1.2\n\n16.4\n\n10.0\n\n11.2\n\nInfrastructure and\nnatural resources\n\nGovernance\nand rule of law\n\nSecurity\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n70.1\n\n55.1\n\n53.4\n\n53.4\n\n72.8\n\n45.5\n\n54.5\n\n43.6\n\n52.8\n\n76.4\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\n%\n\nNote: Year is \ufb01scal year ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: Budget Execution Report, Ministry of Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nOther hurdles include failure of responsibility, accountability, and \ndelegation of authority; a long procurement review and approval process; \nbureaucratic rigidity involving lengthy administrative processes; \nproblems with \ufb01nance controllers in line ministries; weak governance \nand corruption; development partner earmarking of project \ufb01nancing; \na lack of appropriate decision-making powers; the inclusion of poorly \ndesigned projects in the national budget; and unrealistic spending \nplans for multiyear development projects, which means large unspent \nallotments carried over into subsequent \ufb01scal years. These issues are not \nlimited to implementing agencies. Technical barriers exist within the \nMinistry of Finance, and more efficient coordination with development \npartners in some instances could improve execution rates.\n\nThe past decade has seen noteworthy reform in budget management \n\nbut not of substance with respect to development projects in \nimplementing agencies. In consultation with development partners, \nthe government needs to shift resources from low-priority, poorly \nperforming projects to higher-priority projects that perform well. \nSlow economic growth desperately demands higher development \nexpenditure achieved through comprehensive reform, with more \nattention paid to precise costing, project planning, procurement, and \ncontract management for multiyear projects. \n\nThe government is developing policy actions to improve development \n\nbudget execution. \n\nA database for development projects will be established by the \n\nMinistry of Finance, which will cover large projects to track information \non total project cost, yearly costing and funding, sources of funds, \nincurred expenditures, and implementation status with milestones. \nIt will help monitor development budget performance and inform a \nmedium-term \ufb01nancial framework designed to facilitate forward-\nlooking budgets that ensure appropriate future allocations for multiyear \nprojects and help identify \ufb01nancial resources available for new projects. \nDatabase estimates will facilitate recurrent budget allocations for the \noperation and maintenance of the new capital assets built. \n\nThe Ministry of Finance will not include any projects in the \n\nnational budget unless it is fully prepared and ready for implementation. \nAdministrative processes will be streamlined. Capacity in implementing \nministries will be strengthened, and development partners will be \nconsulted on how to make funding more \ufb02exible. Consultation with \nprovincial authorities will seek to improve development budget \nexecution. Finally, the Ministry of Finance will endeavor to work \nmore closely with the seven ministries responsible for 80% of \ndevelopment projects.\n\n\fBangladesh\n\nDespite  global  headwinds  that  crimped  remittances,  GDP  recorded  robust  growth  in  FY2016  on \nhigher private investment and exports. The current account surplus expanded, and inflation slowed. \nContinued  high  growth  will  require  a  rebound  in  remittances  and  higher  exports.  Productive  jobs \nare  needed  in  manufacturing  and  modern  services  for  the  large  number  of  new  entrants  to  the \nlabor  force  and  surplus  farm  labor  and  to  boost  female  workforce  participation.\n\nEconomic performance\nHigher private investment, exports, and wages underpinned GDP \ngrowth acceleration to 7.1% in FY2016 (ended 30 June 2016) from 6.6% \nin the previous year (Figure 3.15.1). Other contributors to growth were \ncontinued political calm, improved power supply, and higher growth in \ncredit to the private sector. \n\nOn the supply side, growth was driven by expansion in industry at \n11.1%, up from 9.7% in FY2015, that mainly re\ufb02ected a pickup in medium- \nand large-scale manufacturing aided by steady expansion in electricity \ngeneration, mining and quarrying, and construction. Supported by \nindustry expansion, services growth accelerated to 6.2% from 5.8% in \nFY2015. Growth in agriculture slowed further, however, to 2.8% from \n3.3% as input costs rose but farm prices remained depressed.\n\nOn the demand side, private investment was the main source of \ngrowth as public investment was constrained by low implementation \ncapacity in line agencies. Total investment equaled 29.7% of GDP, up from \n28.9%. At $2.0 billion, foreign direct investment was still less than 1% of \nGDP. A decline in remittance in\ufb02ows curtailed consumer spending but \nwas partly offset by higher wages in both the public and the private sector. \nNet exports contributed to growth with higher volumes of exports and \nlower imports, mainly reduced quantities of food grain and fertilizer.\nAverage annual in\ufb02ation eased to 5.9% in FY2016 from 6.4% in \n\nthe previous year, largely in response to lower global commodity \nprices, steady domestic supply, and a stable exchange rate between the \nBangladesh taka and the US dollar that translated into taka appreciation \nagainst the currencies of most of Bangladesh\u2019s trade partners. Year-on-\nyear in\ufb02ation declined to 5.5% in June 2016 from 6.3% a year earlier \n(Figure 3.15.2). Food in\ufb02ation slowed sharply to 4.2% from 6.3%, and \nnonfood in\ufb02ation rose to 7.5% from 6.2%, stoked by increased prices for \nnatural gas and electricity and higher wages.\n\nDriven by accelerating growth in private credit, expansion in the \nmoney supply rose to 16.3% in FY2016, exceeding the target of 15.0% \n(Figure 3.15.3). Private investment and consumer lending pushed up \nprivate credit growth to 16.8%, exceeding the 14.8% target as political \n\nThis chapter was written by Jyotsana Varma, Md.

While foreign \ufb01nancing of the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit was lower \nthan budgeted, growth in net bank credit to the government increased \nby only 3.6% in FY2016 and subsequently abated in the \ufb01rst months \nof FY2017. This trend mirrors the increased mobilization of nonbank \n\ufb01nancing in the past 2 years. Expansion in net foreign assets has stayed \nstrong, accelerating to 23.2% in FY2016 from 18.2% a year earlier, mainly \nre\ufb02ecting the larger surplus in the current account. \n\nAs in\ufb02ation slowed, Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, lowered \n\nits repo and reverse repo rates by 50 basis points in January 2016 \n(Figure 3.15.4). Ample liquidity in the banking system, especially as \ncentral bank foreign exchange purchases were not fully sterilized, caused \nfurther interest rate declines. The weighted average yield on 91-day \nTreasury bills fell to 4.0% in June 2016 from 5.4% a year earlier. Banks\u2019 \nweighted average lending rate slipped to 10.3% from 11.7% in the same \nperiod. The deposit rate also declined, to 5.4% from 6.7%, narrowing \nbanks\u2019 interest rate spread marginally by 0.1 percentage points to 4.9. \nThe ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to all bank loans rose to 10.1% \nat the end of June 2016 from 9.7% a year earlier. High NPLs remain a \nconcern, especially with those at state-owned banks standing at 25.7%. \nTax collection by the National Board of Revenue grew by 14.6% in \nFY2016 but fell short of the ambitious budget target. Nontax revenues \nalso missed the target, mainly because of lower contributions from \nBangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission pro\ufb01ts and \nthe Bangladesh Bank dividend. Spending was lower than budgeted as \nthe implementation of the annual development program continued to \nunderperform and because current spending on subsidies was lower than \nanticipated, as were interest payments. As a share of GDP, revenue rose \nto 9.9% from 9.6% a year earlier, while spending declined to 13.0% \nfrom 13.5%, curtailing the budget de\ufb01cit to 3.1% of GDP (Figure 3.15.5). \nDomestic \ufb01nancing, mostly from nonbank sources, met 90% of the de\ufb01cit.\nExports grew by 8.9% in FY2016, up from 3.1% a year earlier, spurred \n\nby a shift to garments with higher value added, and enabled by political \nstability. Garment exports, accounting for over 80% of exports, grew \nbriskly at 10.2%, up from 4.1% in FY2015. Import payments rose by \n5.5% in FY2016, nearly double the 3.0% growth in FY2015, on higher \nimports of petroleum products, yarn and other intermediate goods \nfor the garment industry, capital machinery, and edible oil. Even with \ngrowth in overseas employment booming at 48.2%, remittances from \nworkers abroad fell by 2.5% to $14.9 billion in FY2016. Lower global oil \nprices have forced budget consolidation in the Gulf economies that host \nmost Bangladeshi migrant workers, undermining wages and job security. \nWeaker currencies, higher living costs, and new taxes further squeeze \nthe earnings left for remittance.\n\nThe current account surplus nonetheless rose to $3.7 billion in \n\nFY2016, equal to 1.7% of GDP, from $2.9 billion in FY2015, aided by \nlower de\ufb01cits in the trade, services, and primary income accounts \n(Figure 3.15.6).

Central bank exchange rate policy aims to \nbuild reserves and avoid excessive volatility in the nominal market rate, \nwhich protects garment \ufb01rms whose contract pricing is denominated \nin foreign currencies. Bangladesh has nevertheless suffered some loss \nin export competitiveness, especially for minor exports, as US dollar \nstrength against the currencies of Bangladesh\u2019s trade partners has, \ncombined with the higher domestic in\ufb02ation, brought trend appreciation \nin real effective exchange rate, up by 5.8% in FY2016 (Figure 3.15.8). \nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange broad price index stood at 4,507.6 in \nJune 2016, registering a marginal decline of 1.6% from a year earlier \n(Figure 3.15.9).

Tax authorities will focus attention on administrative reform \nto boost collections and expand the tax base, and foreign \ufb01nancing will \nbe available as expected for planned public investment. The government \nwill further raise electricity and natural gas prices to cut subsidies and \nkeep current spending in check. Finally, the weather will be normal.\n\nGDP growth is expected to moderate to 6.9% in FY2017 as domestic \ndemand rises more slowly and the slide in workers\u2019 remittances deepens \n(Figure 3.15.10). Slower export growth caused by weaker consumer \ndemand in the euro area and the United Kingdom is expected in part \nbecause the currencies of these destination markets have depreciated \nagainst the dollar. Increases in wages and continued access to credit will \nhelp to sustain private consumption. Private investment will rise only \nslightly as investors turn cautious ahead of national elections in 2018. \nPublic investment is expected to strengthen through \ufb01scal expansion as \nthe authorities speed up their implementation of infrastructure projects. \nGrowth in FY2018 is expected to remain unchanged at 6.9% as the broad \nmomentum in the previous year continues. \n\nAgriculture is expected to slow further to 2.4% growth in FY2017 \nand 2.3% in FY2018, mainly because of limits on area expansion and \nproductivity improvement. Industry growth is expected to decelerate to \n10.6% in FY2017 in tandem with domestic demand. With reinvigorated \ndomestic demand resulting from higher export income and a more \nmoderate decline in remittances, industry growth will edge back up \nto 10.7% in FY2018. Services growth is expected to slow to 6.0% in \nFY2017, re\ufb02ecting slower growth in agriculture and industry, and \nremain unchanged in FY2018.\n\n3.15.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n6.9\n\n6.1\n\n\u20131.0\n\n6.9\n\n6.3\n\n\u20130.7\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of \nthat year.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.15.7\u2002Gross foreign exchange reserves\n\n$ billion \n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. http://www.bb.org.bd/econdata/\nintreserve.php\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nBangladesh\u2002\u2002185\n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to pick up in FY2017 to average 6.1% \n\n3.15.8\u2002Exchange rates\n\nNominal\n\nReal effective\n\n(Figure 3.15.11). It moderated from October to December 2016 as the \narrival of winter vegetables and the aman rice crop lowered food prices. \nNonfood in\ufb02ation also slowed in this period, re\ufb02ecting favorable \ninternational prices. In\ufb02ation is expected to rebound in the second half \nof FY2017, however, with likely higher global prices for oil and other \ncommodities, upward adjustments to natural gas and electricity prices \nas the government continues to align prices with production costs, \nand the further implementation of salary hikes introduced in FY2016 \nfor government staff and private educational institutions to adjust for \nin\ufb02ation and improve living standards. In\ufb02ation is expected to edge up \nfurther to 6.3% in FY2018 as global fuel prices continue to rise and a \nnew value-added tax comes into effect at the start of the year.\n\nThe monetary policy statement for the second half of FY2017 \n(January\u2013June 2017) supports growth while mitigating in\ufb02ation risks. \nThe central bank kept policy rates unchanged at 6.75% for the repo \nrate and 4.75% for reverse repo because in\ufb02ation expectations remain \nelevated, including for global commodity prices. It kept the July 2016 \nmonetary policy statement growth targets to June 2017 at 15.5% for \nbroad money and 16.5% for private credit. Considering current buoyancy \nin stock exchange prices, it tightened monitoring to ensure that banks \nabided by statutory limits on market exposure to avoid a repetition of \nthe 2010 market run-up and collapse. \n\nExports grew by 4.4% in the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2017, down \nfrom 8.3% in the year-earlier period. Growth in readymade garment \nexports was 4.1%, down from 9.1%. Export growth is expected to \nstrengthen in the second half of FY2017 on higher projected growth in \nthe industrial economies, but exports for the full year are expected to \nslow to 6.0% from 8.9% in FY2016 (Figure 3.15.12). Export growth in \nFY2018 is projected to edge up to 7.0% on steady external demand and \nimprovement in the Bangladesh market share. Export forecasts assume \nthat policy uncertainty in the US, United Kingdom, and euro area is \nresolved in ways not inimical to expansion in global trade \ufb02ows and that \nthe garment industry continues to improve worker safety and welfare. \nImport payments rose by 8.2% in July\u2013December 2016 with higher \nimports of wheat, petroleum products, capital goods, and iron, steel, and \nother base metals, though imports of crude oil, fertilizer, and raw cotton \ndeclined. Imports are expected to grow by 9.0% in FY2017 and 10.0% in \nFY2018 on broadly stable domestic demand and some pickup in global \nprices for commodities, especially oil. \n\nRemittance in\ufb02ows dipped by 17.6% to $6.2 billion in the \ufb01rst half of \nFY2017 as economic tightening continued in Gulf economies and newly \nconstrained in\ufb02ows from the US and the United Kingdom appeared to \nre\ufb02ect political uncertainties there (Figure 3.15.13). Despite the 23.5% \nrise in jobs abroad for Bangladeshi workers in the \ufb01rst 6 months of \nFY2017, remittances are expected to sink further by 7.0% in FY2017 and \n4.0% in FY2018. \n\nFalling remittances and a larger trade de\ufb01cit are expected to \npush the FY2017 current account into a de\ufb01cit equal to 1.0% of GDP \n(Figure 3.15.14).

The taka will likely depreciate marginally in \nnominal terms in FY2017 on the larger trade de\ufb01cit and the continued \ndecline in remittances. \n\nThe FY2017 budget assumes 36.8% growth in revenue, attained \n\nby raising the ratio of revenue to GDP to 12.4% from 9.9% in the \nprevious year. Achieving this high target will be a challenge, \nconsidering that collection in the \ufb01rst 4 months grew by only 17.1%. \nRevenue from customs duties will be lower with rate cuts on several \nitems. The collection of direct taxes could also fall short of its target in \nlight of sluggish trends in income tax receipts from commercial banks. \nPublic spending was slated to grow by 28.7% to equal 17.4% of GDP \nin FY2017, up from 13.0% the year before. Current spending is expected \nto rise to 9.6% of GDP from 7.8% in FY2016, and the annual development \nprogram to 5.6% from 3.9% in FY2016. Achieving the planned large \nincreases will demand concerted efforts. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is expected \nto be contained within 5.0% of GDP as planned, three-\ufb01fths of it \n\ufb01nanced by domestic sources, mostly nonbanks. Implementing the new \nvalue-added tax in FY2018 will be crucial to advancing tax reform and \n\ufb01nancing higher infrastructure spending to foster growth.\n\nAs a net oil importer, Bangladesh continues to enjoy windfall gains \nfrom low global oil prices. The authorities are expected to cut retail fuel \nprices in FY2017 but leave enough cushion for the Bangladesh Petroleum \nCorporation to earn an operating pro\ufb01t and recoup past losses. Since the \nbeginning of low global oil prices in 2014, the government has cut prices \nonly once, in FY2016, as policy focused on eliminating large subsidies. \n\nDebt indicators are generally favorable. Public debt declined \nto the equivalent of 27.2% of GDP in FY2016 from 27.4% in FY2015 \n(Figure 3.15.15). External debt declined to 11.7% of GDP from 12.2%, with \na debt service ratio of only 2.0% thanks to the government\u2019s preference \nfor concessional external borrowing. Domestic debt rose to 15.5% of GDP \nin FY2016 from 15.2% in FY2015 as the government met shortfalls in \nrevenue collection largely by selling national savings certi\ufb01cates to the \npublic. Interest payments were 13.8% of budget expenditure.\n\nThese projections depend on the following: Revenues need to \nrise quickly if the government\u2019s sizeable infrastructure development \nprogram is to be implemented. The exchange rate should be managed \n\ufb02exibly to offset lower remittance in\ufb02ows and encourage exports. \nInstitutional and regulatory reform needs to be accelerated, and \ninfrastructure de\ufb01cits amended, to improve the investment climate. \nPolitical stability must be maintained and security strengthened to boost \ninvestor con\ufb01dence. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting productive jobs\nBangladesh faces an employment challenge. Productive, well-paid jobs \nneed to be created for the 1.4 million workers who join the workforce \neach year. Female workforce participation is still low despite sizeable \nemployment in the garment industry, minimizing women\u2019s contribution \nto economic development. Productive jobs in manufacturing and modern \nservices are needed for surplus labor currently in low-productivity \nagriculture (Table 3.15.2).\n\n3.15.11\u2002Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Bangladesh Bank. 2017.

In addition to readymade \ngarments, which supply 40% of manufacturing value added and 60% of \nmanufacturing jobs, the government is focusing its efforts on products \nwith high labor intensity and export potential such as footwear and \nleather products, jute and other agro-processed goods, electrical \nand electronic goods, light engineering, information technology \nservices, medium-sized shipbuilding, ceramics, and pharmaceuticals. \nIt is extending the duty-free import facility for raw materials and \nintermediate inputs used in agro-processing and shipbuilding, as well as \nrevamping the duty-drawback system to guarantee to exporting \ufb01rms \nworld prices for imported inputs. The central bank is expanding its \nre\ufb01nancing window to support labor-intensive small and medium-sized \nenterprises. \n\nThe government is reviewing import tariffs to mitigate any bias \nagainst exports, aiming to weaken effective protection for domestic \nmanufacturers and thereby encourage them to enhance their \nproductivity and competiveness. It has stepped up efforts to gain greater \naccess to untraditional export markets such as the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey.\n\nA government program of investment in skills for employment aims \n\nto make the skills development system more market oriented and so \nimprove employability and productivity. \n\nThe government has decided to allow public and private entities alike \n\nto set up special economic zones toward catalyzing private investment, \nintegrating into global value chains, and diversifying exports to create \njobs.

Several of these zones \nare attracting domestic and foreign investment interest and are expected \nto become operational in the next couple of years.\n\nUnder the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the government set a high priority \n\non job creation in rural areas through skills training and strengthening \nproducer and marketer cooperatives. The government is strengthening \ninformation and communication technology infrastructure in rural \nareas to disseminate modern techniques in agriculture, \ufb01sheries, and \nlivestock. It emphasizes the development of agriculture value chains \nthrough private investment by encouraging the commercialization of \nagriculture, promoting a shift to high-value crops, and streamlining \nmarket access. \n\nThe government is developing rural areas by upgrading rural \nroads to reduce user costs, facilitating connectivity with railways and \nwaterways to promote multimodal transport systems and improve \nlogistics, and developing growth centers. It is allocating more resources \nto transport infrastructure and power supply improvement in the \ncountry\u2019s lagging regions in the northwest and south, with a view to \npromoting manufacturing and small and medium-sized enterprises \nthrough tax incentives, low-interest loans, and special economic \nzones. A government priority is to complete the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong \nExpressway, which will substantially shorten travel time between the \ncapital and the main port city. \n\nThe government merged the Board of Investment and the \nPrivatization Commission into the new Bangladesh Investment \nDevelopment Authority. In addition to encouraging domestic and foreign \nprivate investment, it assists in setting up industries and provides other \nservices to investors. \n\nTo attract investment, foster rapid manufacturing-led growth, and \n\ncreate jobs, Bangladesh needs to reduce the cost of doing business. \nMost cost indicators surveyed by the World Bank\u2014for enforcing \ncontracts, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, and \npaying taxes\u2014rank Bangladesh in the bottom 10% of the countries \ncovered (Figure 3.15.16). As a priority initiative, the Bangladesh \nInvestment Development Authority is coordinating agencies\u2019 efforts to \nreduce the costs of doing business in Bangladesh. \n\nTo improve access to electricity, the government is investing \nheavily in power generation. In 2017, it expects to add another 1,840 \nmegawatts to the current 15,350 megawatts of generating capacity. \nTransmission and distribution lines are being expanded and prepaid \nmeters introduced to reduce system losses and improve management. \nBangladesh is expecting to import another 500 megawatts of electricity \nfrom India by 2018. Regulations on electricity transmission and \ndistribution tariffs announced in 2016 allow utilities to approach the \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission periodically for tariff review \nand revision to cover costs. \n\n\fBhutan \n\nGrowth  quickened  in  FY2016  on  higher  construction  and  investment.  Inflation  fell  to  a  new  low, \nand  foreign  exchange  reserves  strengthened.  The  outlook  is  for  marked  growth  acceleration  on \nexpanded  investment  in  hydropower  for  export,  the  economic  mainstay,  and  added  capacity  in \nelectricity generation. The government keenly focuses on inclusive growth. Policies to foster more \nadequate  urban  housing  in  the  face  of  very  rapid  urbanization  are  a  challenge.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy grew by 6.4% in FY2016 (ended 30 June 2016), slightly \nhigher than the 6.1% a year earlier, driven mainly by accelerated \nconstruction on three major hydropower projects (Figure 3.16.1). \nOn the supply side, industry was the main driver of higher growth, \nexpanding by 7.3% from 6.0% a year earlier. Construction picked up, \nboosting demand for construction goods and so strengthening \nmanufacturing. Even with the Dagachhu hydropower plant going into \nfull production, electricity generation and export earnings from it \ndeclined because of weak water \ufb02ows. Expansion in services slipped to \n7.1% from 8.3% in FY2015. This re\ufb02ected in part a 9% decline in dollar \nearnings from tourism, which usually contributes about 4% of GDP, \nas some visitors shunned the Himalayas after devastating earthquakes \nin Nepal in April and May 2015. Growth in agriculture improved to 4.0% \nfrom 3.5% owing to government initiatives promoting self-sufficiency \nand import substitution. \n\nConsumption expanded by 5.6% in FY2016 from 1.6% a year \nearlier and remained the largest demand-side component of GDP \n(Figure 3.16.2). The acceleration was driven by higher household \nincomes and falling prices, as well as increased public spending, \nparticularly on education. Investment growth edged up to 20.9% from \n20.0%, primarily because of steadily expanding work on hydropower \nprojects. Consumption and investment growth offset deterioration in \nnet exports as export volume suffered a slight decline, while imports of \nconstruction materials and machinery increased.\n\nAverage in\ufb02ation halved to 3.3% in FY2016. Prices in Bhutan broadly \n\nfollow market prices in India because most imports come from there. \nThe Indian wholesale price index dropped into de\ufb02ation in January 2015 \nand returned to positive territory only in March 2016, suppressing \nin\ufb02ation in Bhutan (Figure 3.16.3). Domestic food in\ufb02ation was moderate \nin May 2016 but spiked higher in December because of destructive rains \nthat peaked in July 2016, while there was a rise in imported food prices \n\nThis chapter was written by Soon Chan Hong of the South Asia Department, ADB, Manila, \nand Danileen Parel, consultant, South Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.16.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.4\n\n6.1\n\n6.4\n\n3.6\n\n4.0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: National Statistics Bureau.

Nonfood prices trended \nlower, bene\ufb01tting from lower transport costs with weak global oil prices. \nHowever, they moved higher in the last quarter of 2016, mainly on a \njump in rental housing costs, as did overall in\ufb02ation. \n\nFiscal policy continued to be progressive. As FY2016 was the middle \n\nof the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, program implementation was at its \nhighest. With increased capital spending, government expenditure \ngrew sharply by 36.3% to the equivalent of 35.4% of GDP (Figure 3.16.4). \nDespite an increase in total revenue by only 1.8%, budget resources \ngrew by 20.7% because of a 70.6% increase in grants, mainly from the \nGovernment of India, to \ufb01nance infrastructure, agriculture, health, and \neducation projects. The overall budget balance fell into a de\ufb01cit equal to \n3.0% of GDP, which was within the limits set by the 5-year plan and the \nmedium-term national budget framework. \n\nOutstanding external debt rose in FY2016 to $2.3 billion, equal to \n109.5% of GDP, with new loans to expand investment in hydropower \nprojects (Figure 3.16.5). Two-thirds of external debt is for hydropower \ndevelopment \ufb01nanced by the Government of India and linked to \nlong-term electricity purchase contracts and explicit guarantees \nthat cover \ufb01nancial and construction risks. Given this\u2014and that \nthe balance of external debt is largely on concessional terms\u2014the \nInternational Monetary Fund assesses Bhutan\u2019s risk of external debt \ndistress to be moderate.\n\nMonetary policy aims to manage credit to avoid overheating and \nensure the stability of the parity exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee. \nBroad money grew by 15.8% in FY2016, slightly higher than the annual \naverage of 14.5% over the past decade (Figure 3.16.6). Growth in broad \nmoney is attributed to a 16.4% increase in net foreign assets and \n14.7% expansion in credit to the private sector, little changed from \na year earlier. The Royal Monetary Authority guarantees sufficient \nIndian rupee reserves available on demand to meet payments. Gross \ninternational reserves rose by 16.7% to $1.1 billion, cover for 11.3 months \nof imports, higher than the traditional rule of thumb of 3 months \n(Figure 3.16.7). The increase primarily re\ufb02ects Indian rupee reserves \nexpanding enough to cover 3.8 months of imports from India. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is high, rising even higher to 29.4% of \nGDP in FY2016 from 28.3% a year earlier (Figure 3.16.8). This largely \nre\ufb02ects a widened trade de\ufb01cit, in particular with India, mostly from \nexpanded imports of capital goods and intermediates for industry. \nThe services de\ufb01cit improved slightly because of lower transport \ncosts and a marked increase in Indian tourist arrivals, which helped \ncompensate for the fall in tourists paying with convertible currency and \nlarger payments for construction services. The de\ufb01cit in the primary \nincome account worsened as interest payments on hydropower debt \ngrew, while the surplus in secondary income improved markedly \nbecause of increased Indian grants for budget support. \n\n3.16.3\u2002Inflation\n\nDomestic food\nImported food\nNonfood\nConsumer price index\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n% of GDP \n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n% of GDP \n\n125\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct Dec\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: National Statistics Bureau.

It is forecast to surge to 9.9% \nin FY2018 as electricity-generating capacity is added, provided that \nhydropower projects are commissioned as planned. \n\nIndustry growth is expected to strengthen markedly in FY2017 as \nelectricity output increases with the assumed return of normal weather, \nwork on large hydropower projects continues, and infrastructure \ndamaged by last year\u2019s torrential rains is rehabilitated. It is expected \nto surge in FY2018 on much higher electricity output and exports \nfollowing the completion of the Mangdechhu hydropower plant and \nthe partial commissioning of the Punatsangchhu II hydropower plant. \nServices growth in FY2017 and FY2018 is projected to improve on \nfaster expansion in industry and a recovery in tourism as worries over \nearthquakes in the Himalayas fade. Currency demonetization in India \nin November 2016 should have no lasting impact in Bhutan. With the \nquickened pace of hydropower investment and production, consumer \nincomes and spending will accelerate in FY2017 and FY2018. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is forecast to increase to 4.9% in FY2017 and 5.4% in \nFY2018 in line with higher wholesale prices expected in India and \na 3-year domestic electricity tariff hike that started to take effect in \nJanuary 2017. While the projected increase in global oil prices would \nincrease transportation costs, continued low global prices for other \ncommodities and India\u2019s strict monetary targeting will likely sustain \nbroad price stability. \n\nThe government plans to slow expenditure growth sharply to \n4.4% in FY2017 from over 36% a year earlier as capital expenditure \ndrops with the completion of 5-year plan activities in the next 2 years. \nInvestment in hydropower projects is unaffected by this decline, \nhowever, because \ufb01nancing and expenditure are under a public \ncorporation. Total budget resources will slow in tandem to 4.9% \nwith lower budgetary grants from India after the surge in FY2016. \nTax revenue is projected to increase by 6.6%, mainly on higher \ncorporate tax collection from hydropower. Notably, a much larger \nminimum personal income tax exemption is expected to deduct 2.5% \nfrom projected tax revenues, but it is budgeted to be offset by higher \nreceipts from mineral royalties and rent. With growth in planned \nexpenditure outpacing that of total revenue, the budget de\ufb01cit is \nexpected to widen to the equivalent of 5.3% of GDP in FY2017 from \n3.0% last year.\n\nMonetary policy will continue to pursue price and exchange rate \n\nstability. An accommodative monetary policy will channel credit to \ngrowth drivers. Reform of the minimum lending rate, announced by the \nRoyal Monetary Authority in July 2016, prompted banks to slash loan \ninterest rates and is expected to boost credit expansion temporarily \nbefore equilibrium returns in the medium term. Rules and regulations \nfor private moneylenders, adopted in December 2016, will bring this \nbusiness under the formal \ufb01nancial sector, supplementing other \nstrong measures to control credit after excessive lending in FY2011 \nput pressure on the balance of payments. \n\n3.16.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n8.2\n\n4.9\n\n9.9\n\n5.4\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u201327.4\n\n\u201322.8\n\n3.16.6\u2002Monetary indicators\n\nCredit to the private sector\nBroad money\nNet foreign assets\n\n% change, year on year \n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nApr\n\nJul Oct\n\nJan\n2016\n\nSource: Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan.

In 2015, the population grew by \n1.6% to about 760,000, with 38.6% living in urban areas, many people \nhaving migrated to where the jobs are. The result is an urban housing \nshortage.\n\nHousing has consistently been the greatest area of exposure for \nbanks. In September 2016, loans for housing amounted to Nu20 billion, \nor nearly one-quarter of total bank lending. These loans are made mostly \nto developers, however, to build multi-storey apartment blocks that are \nrented out to tenants. Thus, although units in these buildings are counted \nunder home ownership, they are actually owned by a limited number of \nlandlords. High land prices and mortgages at market interest rates with \nvery short repayment periods make the terms for repayment impossible \nand home ownership inaccessible to low- and middle-income people. \n\nThe inability to purchase one\u2019s own home means heavy dependence \n\non rental housing, limiting urban families\u2019 ability to save and build \nequity in their home, which in most other countries is a major \npersonal asset. This is mainly an urban phenomenon as most rural \nhouseholds own their home, mostly owner built. In urban areas, \nonly 17% of households own their home. Although the government \nprovides some housing built by the National Housing Development \nCorporation, it is only for a small group of civil servants. Similarly, \nthe quasi-governmental National Pension and Provident Fund provides \nhousing loans but only to its members, mainly civil servants and the \narmed forces. These institutions solve the housing problem for only a \nsmall segment of the population.\n\nAfter food, the largest expense for urban households is usually \nhousing rental. Further, as housing construction cannot keep up with \nurban population growth because basic infrastructure is inadequate, \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nBhutan\u2002\u2002193\n\nlandlords decline to make repairs or improvements, knowing that \ntenants will likely stay rather than look for better housing that would \nbe more costly. This causes the condition of urban housing stock to \ndeteriorate.\n\nThe housing crunch is being addressed by reforms and initiatives. \nOne model is the Amochhu land development and township project of \nDruk Holding and Investments, a government-owned holding company, \nset to begin in FY2017. It will develop a 160-hectare area adjacent the \nAmochhu River in Phuentsholing, the second largest city in Bhutan. \nThe project will protect the area from \ufb02ooding and erosion, and \nestablish urban infrastructure, basic services, and housing complexes. \nMeanwhile, \ufb01nance reform could aim to enable private developers \n\nto build for sale to individual home owners. The minimum lending rate \nreform in July 2016 brought more bank competition and lower lending \nrates, including an improved rate for noncommercial housing loans that \nshould encourage home ownership. However, further improvements to \nmortgage terms are required to improve access, particularly for low- and \nmiddle-income groups, by substantially lengthening repayment periods \nand setting reasonable qualifying income standards and down payments.\nMore generally, Bhutan needs a comprehensive national land and \nhousing policy that would provide a framework for urban development \nand housing. The existing national housing policy is being revised \nto address emerging housing issues as well as old ones. The policy, \nto be implemented after consultation with stakeholders, will create an \nenabling environment for a modern housing industry, promote \ufb01nance \nmechanisms for middle- and low-income housing in particular, establish \nan agency to monitor the housing stock, and formulate strategies and \nlegislation in response to emerging trends in the housing market.\n\n\fIndia\n\nGrowth  slowed  to  7.1%  in  FY2016  despite  recovery  in  agriculture.  While  recent  GDP  data \nmay  not  fully  capture  the  effects  of  demonetization,  the  slowdown  did  reflect  a  continued \nslump  in  investment.  Dragging  on  growth  were  excess  production  capacity,  problems  that  past \noverinvestment  left  on  corporate  balance  sheets,  and  new  bank  lending  inhibited  by  too  many \nstressed  assets.  Moderately  higher  growth  is  projected  as  consumption  picks  up  and  government \ninitiatives  boost  private  investment.\n\nEconomic performance \nIn the middle of FY2016 (ended 31 March 2017), the government \nannounced the withdrawal of legal tender status for all existing Rs500 \nand Rs1,000 currency notes to counter black money hoarding and \ncounterfeiting (Box 3.17.1). This move demonetized 86% of currency in \ncirculation by value. New Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes were introduced, \nbut the distribution of new notes picked up only gradually, leaving a \ncash crunch for 2 months and straining commerce dependent on cash.\nThis was one reason economic growth slowed to 7.1% in FY2016, \naccording to advance government estimates (Figure 3.17.1). This outcome \nwas well below 7.9% growth in FY2015 and marginally above the \nADO Supplement forecast of 7.0% issued in 2016. Much of growth \ncame from strong agriculture and government services. Excluding \ngovernment services, growth in value added dropped from 6.7% to 6.0%. \nAgriculture grew by a robust 4.4% as a healthy monsoon helped food \ngrain production grow by 8.1% to new records. Livestock, forestry, and \n\ufb01sheries also recorded healthy growth. \n\nAfter growing by 8.2% in FY2015, industry decelerated to 5.8% in \nFY2016. Mining slowed considerably as oil and natural gas production \ncontracted. Manufacturing value added grew by a healthy 7.7%, though \ndown from the 10.6% recorded a year earlier. Growth re\ufb02ected robust \nperformance by large private manufacturers, which bene\ufb01ted from \nlower input costs. However, healthy growth in manufacturing value \nadded is at odds with the volume-based index of industrial production, \nwhich registered hardly any growth. Construction was muted, growing \nby 3.1% as the cash crunch possibly hit real estate activity in the second \nhalf of the \ufb01scal year.\n\nServices growth also moderated, to 7.9%, with notable slowdowns \nin \ufb01nance and real estate, as well as in trade, hotels, and transportation \nand communication services. Anemic credit growth continued \nto weigh on \ufb01nancial services, though deposit growth picked up \nsubstantially immediately after demonetization as people deposited the \ndiscontinued banknotes.

By contrast, there was strong growth in \ngovernment services, including public administration and defense, \non account of salary hikes for central government employees.\n\nPrivate consumption is estimated to have grown by 7.2%, much \nas in the previous year (Figure 3.17.2). However, this estimate may be \noptimistic because achieving it would require private consumption \nto grow by 8.2% in the second half of FY2016, signi\ufb01cantly above the \n6.1% achieved in the \ufb01rst half\u2014or, for that matter, in the past few years. \nGovernment consumption is estimated to have grown at its fastest pace \nsince FY2011 to pay the higher wages and salaries. Despite a 10.6% \nincrease in central government capital expenditure, overall investment \nremained \ufb02at, growing by only 0.6%, as private investment continued to \nbe weighed down by low capacity utilization and slow progress toward \ndeleveraging.\n\nGDP growth got a further impetus from a robust increase in net taxes, \n\nbuoyed by strong indirect tax collection.\n\nIn\ufb02ation remained subdued for a second year, averaging 4.7% \n(Figure 3.17.3). While food in\ufb02ation inched up in the \ufb01rst few months \nof FY2016 with rises for vegetables, pulses, and sugar, subsequent \nmonths saw prices cooled by a better monsoon and summer crop. \nRetail in\ufb02ation is down considerably since November because of lower \nprices for perishable food, supplies of which tend to be ample in winter. \nCompounding this was a fall in demand as the cash crunch followed \ndemonetization, forcing suppliers to sell at lower prices. Domestic fuel \nin\ufb02ation has remained relatively subdued at 3.0%. Core in\ufb02ation was \nalso stable in FY2016, ranging from 4.5% to 5.0%. Subdued in\ufb02ation \nallowed the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to reduce policy \nrates by 50 basis points during FY2016 for a cumulative decline of \n175 basis points since January 2015 (Figure 3.17.4). Moreover, with \ndeposit accretion far outweighing credit growth after demonetization, \ncommercial banks lowered their lending rates by 40\u201390 basis points as \ntheir new deposit costs came down.\n\nCredit growth slumped in FY2016 to its lowest in over a decade, \nestimated at less than 8.0%. This slowdown masked growing divergence \nby sector. Credit to industry has trended lower for several years \nand contracted in FY2016 as investment demand stayed weak and \ncorporations actively deleveraged to strengthen their balance sheets \n(Figure 3.17.5). On the other hand, retail credit including housing and \nvehicle loans trended higher, indicating robust household demand. \nDemonetization was a factor in the slump for some months, deferring \ndemand and signi\ufb01cantly affecting cash-dependent retail trade and \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \n\nCredit growth was further impeded as nonperforming loans \nproliferated to 9.1% of all loans in September 2016, up from 7.8% the \nprevious March, pushing the ratio of stressed advances including \nrestructured loans to all advances to 12.3% in September 2016 from \n11.5% in March (Figure 3.17.6). Most nonperforming loans and \nrestructured assets are concentrated in state-owned banks, where \nthe stressed advances ratio increased to 15.8% in September from \n14.4% in March. Particularly affected industries were base metals, \n\n3.17.1\u2002Banknote demonetization \n\nOn 8 November 2016, the government \nwithdrew the legal tender status of all \nRs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes. This \ndemonetization intended to trip up \ncorruption, counterfeiting, and the \nfunding of terrorism. This decision \naugmented measures introduced earlier \nto \ufb01ght corruption, including tax \namnesties to encourage the disclosure \nof black money, agreements with other \ncountries to share banking information, \nand the renegotiation of treaties to \navoid double taxation. The decision was \nenvisioned as fostering digitalization, \nimproving tax compliance, and \nchanneling additional savings through \nthe formal banking system. \n\nIndia is a cash-intensive society, \nwith an estimated 78% of consumer \npayments concluded in cash. The initial \ncurrency crunch, caused by the slow \nreplacement of demonetized notes, \ntherefore hit commerce, causing a \ntemporary drop in consumption and \nemployment. However, steady progress \nin issuing new notes is expected to \nrapidly rectify the situation. \n\nThe temporary drop in demand \n\nhelped slow in\ufb02ation. The return \nof demonetized notes caused bank \ndeposits to surge and lending rates \nto drop. Because small enterprises \ngenerate a large share of India\u2019s exports, \nand are highly dependent on cash, \ndemonetization impeded exports of \ngems, jewelry, and garments for a few \nmonths before the situation normalized. \nGold imports spiked in November, \nwith buyers reportedly purchasing \ngold with discontinued notes even at \nlarge premiums.\n\nDemonetization is likely to have a \npositive impact over the medium term. \nAlong with the forthcoming \nimplementation of the goods and \nservices tax, demonetization will widen \nthe tax net and improve tax compliance. \nWith more people channeling their \nsavings into the banking system, \nbanks will have more money to lend \nat lower rates. Lower aggregate \ndeposit costs should improve bank \npro\ufb01tability, further increasing their \nlending capacity.\n\n\f196\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nconstruction, textiles, food processing, and infrastructure development. \nThe implementation of the new bankruptcy code is likely to modernize \nand expedite the bankruptcy process.\n\nThe central government budget for FY2017 was presented a \nmonth earlier than usual at the beginning of February 2016 to speed \nappropriations. Another aim was to counter a practice in which the \ngovernment asks Parliament for enough funding to cover expenditure \nin the \ufb01rst few months until Parliament formally approves the budget. \nThe central government succeeded in narrowing the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to \n3.5% of GDP in FY2016 (Figure 3.17.7). Encouragingly, this reduction \nwas accompanied by improved quality of expenditure. While capital \nexpenditure was originally targeted to contract by 2.4% in FY2016 \nto compensate for higher government salaries, preliminary estimates \nshow capital expenditure growing by 10.6%. Current expenditure grew \nby 12.8%. Subsidy spending continued to decline from the equivalent \nof 1.9% of GDP in FY2015 to 1.7% as fertilizer and petroleum subsidies \nfell thanks to low oil prices and the expansion of a program that pays \nthe cooking gas subsidy directly into recipients\u2019 bank accounts to \nreduce leakage. \n\nRevenue grew by a healthy 16.7% in FY2016, aided by strong \ngrowth in tax revenue and public enterprise dividends and pro\ufb01ts. \nPersonal income tax witnessed robust growth at 22.8% as the \ngovernment introduced in FY2016 two tax amnesties to encourage \nincome disclosure. Excise tax collection also grew strongly for a second \nyear, partly on higher revenues from several hikes to excise rates on \npetroleum products in FY2015. Buoyant excise tax collections can be \nattributed as well to growth from other products. Meanwhile, as in \nprevious years, income from disinvestment in public corporations was a \nfraction of the target. \n\nA committee set up to review avenues to \ufb01scal consolidation \n\nrecommended sustainable debt as the principal macroeconomic anchor \nfor \ufb01scal policy and called for reining in the ratio of public debt to GDP \nfrom the current 67% to 60% by FY2023. To achieve this target, the \ncommittee recommended capping the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit at 3.0% of GDP in the \n3 years following the proposed FY2017 budget, which has a de\ufb01cit equal \nto 3.2% of GDP. In line with these recommendations, the government \nhas adopted 3.0% of GDP as the target for FY2018\u2013FY2020.\n\nestimated 3.7% in FY2016. Although oil imports fell by nearly 2% in \nFY2016, much of the contraction was concentrated in the \ufb01rst half of the \n\ufb01scal year (Figure 3.17.8). Oil prices \ufb01rmed considerably in the second \nhalf, and oil imports picked up. Gold imports declined substantially in \nFY2016 because of softening global prices and the cash crunch following \ndemonetization. Imports other than oil and gold were relatively steady \nas commodity prices stabilized and domestic demand remained muted.\nAs with imports, exports revived in the second half of FY2016, \n\ngrowing by an estimated 2.5% for the year. The revival was driven largely \nby a pickup in re\ufb01ned petroleum exports and stronger demand from \nthe advanced economies, especially the US and Germany. In particular, \nexports of gems and jewelry, iron and steel, and motor vehicles picked \nup in the second half of FY2016.

Remittance in\ufb02ows weakened a bit in FY2016 as low crude oil \nprices squeezed host economies in the Middle East. In sum, the FY2016 \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit is estimated to equal 1.0% of GDP. \n\nNet in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment (FDI) remained strong for \n\na second year in FY2016 at $36.7 billion after the government simpli\ufb01ed \nguidelines and allowed more FDI in real estate, airport and air transport \nservices, and e-commerce. Net portfolio \ufb02ows remained subdued by \ncomparison. The last quarter of 2016 brought a large out\ufb02ow, possibly \na result of a US interest rate hike in December 2016 and uncertainty \nfollowing demonetization. Net portfolio debt out\ufb02ows amounted \n$2 billion in FY2016 (Figure 3.17.9). While varying month to month, \nequity in\ufb02ows amounted to $7 billion in FY2016, which pushed stock \nprices on the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex up by 16% over the year \n(Figure 3.17.10). Net deposits by nonresident Indians turned negative \nin FY2016 largely because of the repayment of maturing deposits that \nthe central bank had attracted from them in FY2013. However, because \nthese out\ufb02ows were buffered by a forward sale-and-swap arrangement \nestablished earlier by the central bank, they did not signi\ufb01cantly drain \nholdings of foreign reserves, which stood at $367 billion in March 2017 \n(Figure 3.17.11). \n\nThe Indian rupee remained stable against the US dollar in FY2016 \n(Figure 3.17.12). However, it strengthened by 2.4% in nominal effective \nterms and by 4.1% in real effective terms, raising its value against the \ncurrencies of some trading partners.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe growth slowdown in FY2016 was primarily the result of sluggish \ninvestment and of consumption slowing in the second half because \nof the cash crunch. With the central bank printing new currency to \nreplace the demonetized notes and lifting limits on account withdrawals \nin March 2017, the cash crunch eased markedly toward the end of \nFY2016. Consumption deferred from the second half of FY2016 by the \ncash crunch will likely surface in FY2017 and lift consumption growth. \nConsumption will receive a further boost as several state governments \nhike salaries and pensions for their employees in FY2017 following \na similar hike for central government employees in FY2016. A good \nmonsoon in FY2017 would allow rural consumption to grow at a healthy \nrate, but early forecasts indicate a monsoon still affected by El Ni\u00f1o.\nAn uptick in consumption could engage excess capacity across \nsectors and invite fresh investment. Public investment will continue \nto be an important driver of growth as private investment remains \nlistless. The increase in central government capital expenditure \ntargeted in the FY2017 budget augurs well for public investment, \nbut capital spending by states is also needed to push public investment \nhigher. Public investment is likely to receive a boost if the government \nreceives signi\ufb01cantly more revenue from the tax amnesties introduced \nin FY2016. Current deleveraging by private corporations and a rising \nproportion of corporate debt instruments being upgraded signal some \nimprovement in corporate \ufb01nancial health, which could aid investment \n\n\f198\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nrecovery. The drop in commercial bank lending rates following \ndemonetization will provide some relief to leveraged companies and \nreduce interest costs for productive sectors. Although the number of \nstalled projects inched up in the quarter ending in December 2016 from \nthe previous quarter, it remains near a 15-quarter low. Announcements \nof new investment projects leveled off (Figure 3.17.13).\n\nVarious outlook surveys indicate some improvement. The services \nand manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 indexes improved signi\ufb01cantly \nfrom April to October 2016 before slipping in November and December \nas demonetization hit demand. However, they have recovered since \nJanuary to signal a return to expansion with recovery in domestic and \nexport orders (Figure 3.17.14). \n\nImproved growth prospects for the advanced economies in 2017 \ncould provide a boost to merchandise exports and to \ufb01nancial, telecom, \nbusiness, and other tradeable services. However, this boon could be \noffset by any marked rise in global oil prices, considering that India \nmeets four-\ufb01fths of its petroleum demand through imports. Resulting \nlower net exports could impinge on growth.\n\nPolicy options to bolster growth are limited. The central bank is \nunlikely to signi\ufb01cantly reduce interest rates in the near term given \nthe risk of in\ufb02ation and of capital out\ufb02ow with further US interest rate \nincreases expected after the one on 15 March 2017. Higher oil prices and \nthe government\u2019s commitment to further reduce the budget de\ufb01cit will \nlimit the extent to which additional \ufb01scal stimulus can be applied. \nOn balance, growth is projected to pick up to 7.4% in FY2017, \nprimarily on higher consumption. Public and private investment \nis expected to contribute to economic growth as the government \nrevitalizes public\u2013private partnerships and as deleveraging in the \nprivate sector bears fruit. Growth is expected to edge up further to \n7.6% in FY2018 with continued deleveraging and as the government \nworks to strengthen the balance sheets of state-owned banks. \nThe implementation of a new national goods and services tax beginning \nin July 2017 should lower prices for capital goods, providing impetus to \ninvestment.\n\nAfter easing for 4 consecutive years, consumer price in\ufb02ation \nis expected to inch up in FY2017. With global prices for oil forecast \nto increase by 20% in FY2017, and with most domestic fuel prices \nbecoming deregulated, domestic fuel in\ufb02ation is forecast to rise by \n10\u201320 basis points. Global food in\ufb02ation as measured by the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations started picking \nup in September 2016 after contracting for almost 5 years. Higher \nprocurement prices for pulses and wheat pose, along with an uptick in \nrural wages, upside risks to the forecast for food in\ufb02ation. The likely \nsalary hike for state government employees in FY2017 will add further \nin\ufb02ationary pressure. The central bank\u2019s most recent survey of in\ufb02ation \nexpectations show them falling because of steep declines for food and \nhousing likely due to demonetization. However, the duration of low \nin\ufb02ation expectations will likely depend on how quickly new banknotes \nare distributed. Moreover, even at current lows, in\ufb02ation expectations \ncontinue to be almost double the 4% midpoint in the central bank target \nrange for in\ufb02ation in the medium term. In\ufb02ation is likely to average \n\n3.17.8\u2002Trade indicators\n\nOil exports\nOther exports\nOther imports\nOil imports\nGold imports\nTrade balance\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of the \nnext\u00a0year.\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 14 March 2017); \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.9\u2002Portfolio capital flows\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Security and Exchange Board of India.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.17.10\u2002Stock price indexes\n\nSensex\nMSCI AC AP excluding Japan\nEmerging markets excluding Asia\n\nIndex, Jan 2009 = 100\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 14 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n$ billion\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\nEquity\nDebt\n\n$ billion\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20138\n\n350\n\n250\n\n150\n\n50\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002199\n\n5.2% in FY2017, accelerating to 5.4% in FY2018 with further \ufb01rming of \nglobal commodity prices and strengthening of domestic demand.\nThe central bank recently signaled a change in policy from \naccommodative to neutral, implying very limited scope for further \npolicy rate cuts. Its focus has thus shifted to lowering in\ufb02ation to the \nmedium-term target of 4% while mindful that higher commodity prices \nand a stronger US dollar will tend to push in\ufb02ation higher. Even though \npolicy rates are unlikely to go lower in the near term, benign liquidity \nconditions allow bank lending rates to fall a bit.\n\nThe budget exhibited commitment to \ufb01scal consolidation by \n\ntargeting in FY2017 a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit narrowed to 3.2% of GDP. However, \nthe target of pegging the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit at 3.0% of GDP has been put \nback by another year. Gross tax revenue is expected to grow by 12.2% \nin FY2017, yielding tax buoyancy at 1.0, which is revenue mobilization \nrising at par with nominal GDP growth. This is slightly lower than in \nrecent years. Personal income tax collection is forecast to increase at \na healthy rate as compliance improves because of legislative changes \nand tax amnesties, even though a cut in personal income tax rates for \nthe lowest tax bracket was announced to help consumption recover. \nGrowth in corporate tax collection is expected to be sluggish, dampened \nby a reduction in the tax rate for smaller companies, as is excise duty \ncollection, inhibited by a rise in oil prices. The target for growth in \nservices tax collection could be on the conservative side, especially if \ndigital transactions increase. Finally, uncertainty clouds the forecast for \nrevenues from indirect taxes with the impending implementation of the \nnew national goods and services tax. As in previous years, the revenue \ntarget from disinvestment, equal to 0.4% of GDP, is ambitious and \nunlikely to be met. \n\nThe quality of expenditure is expected to improve further with \ncapital spending in FY2017 projected to grow by 10.7%, against growth \nin current expenditure by only 5.9%. The budget continues to prioritize \ninfrastructure and rural development with higher outlays on roads and \nhighways, railways, electric power, affordable housing, and irrigation. \nSubsidy payments are forecast to decline as petroleum and fertilizer \nsubsidies are curtailed. However, any signi\ufb01cant increase in global oil \nprices could force up subsidy payments. Similarly, higher allowances \nto civil servants, a decision on which was postponed to 2017, could \nundermine the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit target.\n\ncontracted in the past 2 years. Global growth improvement would \nhelp exports, though an appreciating rupee in real effective terms \ncould dent India\u2019s competitiveness. Price recovery for commodities \nlike metals, chemicals, and food would lift exports, as export volumes \nfor them have held up. Overall, exports are forecast to grow by 6.0% \nin FY2017. With petroleum import volume rising at an annual average \nof 4.4% during the last 5 years, higher global prices could push up the \noil import bill considerably. Gold imports are expected to remain \ufb02at \nas the government\u2019s gold securities programs are expected to contain \nimport demand.

The rise has been a result of oil \nexporters scaling back their output. Because India imports four-\ufb01fths \nof its petroleum needs, it was profoundly affected as the average \nimport price increased by 37.6% in FY2016. A rapid increase in the \nprice of oil challenges macroeconomic stability in numerous ways \nas it undermines \ufb01scal consolidation, stokes in\ufb02ation, and swells the \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit. \n\nWith Indian consumption of petroleum products increasing by an \nannual average of 5.6% over the past 5 years, any sharp increase in oil \nprices would widen the import bill considerably. With current import \nvolumes, a $1 increase in oil prices raises the import bill by nearly \n$2 billion. However, as India exports re\ufb01ned petroleum products, some \nof the increase in the import bill is offset by higher export earnings. \nOn balance, every $1 increase in the price of oil widens the trade and \ncurrent account de\ufb01cits by $1.4 billion. \n\nDeclining oil prices and price deregulation for petroleum products \n\nlike gasoline and diesel have facilitated \ufb01scal consolidation through \npetroleum subsidy contraction from the equivalent of 0.9% of GDP \nin FY2013 to 0.2% in FY2016. The government currently subsidizes \ncooking gas and kerosene, which comprise 14% of petroleum product \nconsumption. To rationalize subsidies, the government has been \nexpanding a program that pays the cooking gas subsidy directly \ninto recipients\u2019 bank accounts and incrementally raising the price of \nkerosene. Despite these measures, consumption of subsidized fuels is \nestimated to grow by 6% annually. Higher global oil prices will raise \nthe subsidy cost and could divert resources from growth-enhancing \ncapital expenditure. Further, a substantial rise in oil prices could force \nthe partial rolling back of excise duty hikes enacted in the second \nhalf of FY2015. The consequent loss of revenue would constrain \ufb01scal \nconsolidation.\n\nA rise in oil prices will directly affect decontrolled prices for \nvarious fuels with a combined weight of 2.4% on the consumer price \nindex. However, as nearly 40% of the market price of these fuels is \n\n3.17.14\u2002Purchasing managers\u2019 indexes\n\nManufacturing\nServices\n\nIndex\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 14 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nIndia\u2002\u2002201\n\ngovernment tax that would be unaffected by higher global prices, a 20% \nincrease in global oil prices would raise domestic prices for re\ufb01ned fuels \nby 12%, lifting retail in\ufb02ation by 30 basis points. The indirect effect will \nbe larger as higher fuel prices spillover to transportation costs. Fares for \nbuses, taxis, auto-rickshaws, railways, and so on have a combined weight \nof 2.1% on the index, and the effect of a 20% increase in global oil prices \nwould lift consumer in\ufb02ation by 50 basis points. \n\nTo mitigate India\u2019s vulnerability to oil price swings, the government \nhas proposed reducing dependence on imported oil by 10% over the next \n5 years. This is to be done by making domestic production more efficient \nand attracting foreign and domestic private investment into the sector. \nA new hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy introduced in 2016 \nencourages participation by placing under a single license exploration for \nconventional and unconventional oil and gas resources including coal bed \nmethane, shale gas and oil, tight gas, and gas hydrates. It also introduces \na revenue-sharing model that is easy to administer and frees up the \nmarketing and pricing of the oil and natural gas produced. In addition, \nthe government approved a policy paving the way to auction to public or \nprivate buyers 100 prospective mineral blocks. State-owned oil \ufb01rms are \nnow free to determine their own oil import policies regarding sources \nand pricing to enable them to compete efficiently. Also allowed now are \nexploration and production projects 100% \ufb01nanced by FDI. Meanwhile, \nto enhance exports of re\ufb01ned petroleum products, India is augmenting \nits re\ufb01ning capacity by setting up new state-owned re\ufb01neries and \nallowing up to 49% FDI in private projects.\n\n\fMaldives\n\nTourism  recovered  slightly  in  2016  but  remained  weak  for  a  third  year,  leaving  growth  to  be \nsustained  by  expansive  fiscal  policy.  The  current  account  deficit  widened  on  imports  for \ninfrastructure  development.  Inflation  stayed  low.  The  outlook  is  for  continued  moderate  growth. \nCareful  fiscal  management  is  needed  to  ensure  the  success  of  efforts  to  boost  tourism  and \ndevelop  infrastructure  to  foster  a  more  diversified  economy.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth picked up slightly to an estimated 3.4% in 2016 from 2.8% \nin 2015 as construction remained prominent, though it grew at a more \nmoderate pace than in the previous 2 years. Tourism recovered from a \ndecline in 2015, but its subpar performance contributed little to growth. \nMost of the rest of the 0.6 percentage point increase in GDP growth \ncame from modest gains in sectors other than tourism or transport and \ncommunication and from a recovery in net indirect taxes less subsidies \n(Figure 3.18.1). \n\nContinued high public investment in construction pushed imports up. \n\nNotable among imports were materials and equipment to construct \nthe Friendship Bridge linking Mal\u00e9, the capital, to the nearby island \nof Hulhul\u00e9. \n\nIndicators showed some improvement in tourism, which supplies \nmore than a quarter of GDP, but sector performance continued to be \nweak in 2016, mainly on account of disappointing tourist arrivals. \nDespite 4.2% growth, up from 2.4% in 2015, arrivals were, at 1.3 million, \nbelow target because of a further decline of 10% from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, the largest single market. Visitors from Europe, the \nMiddle East, and South Asia all increased but managed to lift sector \ngrowth by only 1.2% (Figure 3.18.2). Tourism earnings measured by \nbed-night occupancy recovered minimally to 2.3% growth, but the \naverage duration of stay shortened by 3.5%. \n\nFisheries recovered in 2016 with \ufb01sh purchases up by 7.0% following \n\nFollowing the government\u2019s decision to remove subsidies on staple \ngoods in October 2016, except on food for the poor, food prices jumped \nby 70%\u2013100% in Mal\u00e9 and even more on far-\ufb02ung atolls despite price \ncontrols. This pushed average consumer in\ufb02ation up to 1.8% in the \nfourth quarter of 2016, though average in\ufb02ation for the whole year was \nstill at a record low of 0.5% on account of low international prices for \ncommodities, especially food and fuel (Figure 3.18.3). \n\nThis chapter was written by Masato Nakane of the South Asia Department, ADB, Manila; \nand Macrina Mallari and Remedios Baes-Espineda, consultants, South Asia Department, \nADB, Manila.\n\n3.18.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nConstruction\nTourism\nTransport & communication\nOther sectors\nTaxes less subsidies\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2017.

Total revenue including grants increased \nby an estimated 4.9% to $1.2 billion, though it fell relative to GDP \nby 1.5 percentage points to 31.3%. The government reprioritized \nspending by cutting recurrent expenditure in favor of capital spending. \nRecurrent expenditure fell by 5.3 percentage points to the equivalent of \n26.4% of GDP, while capital expenditure rose to 12.3% from 8.9% a year \nearlier. Total expenditure including net lending was almost $1.5 million, \nfalling as a share of GDP to 38.7% from 40.6% in 2015. As the quality of \nspending improved, the budget de\ufb01cit shrank to 7.4% of GDP from 7.8%.\nAs in previous years, domestic debt \ufb01nanced most of the budget gap, \n\nor 72%, through the issuance of Treasury bonds and bills sold to \ncommercial banks and other \ufb01nancial institutions. By the end of 2016, \nthe outstanding stock of government securities had grown by 16%. \nTreasury bills rose by 15% year on year with increased holdings by \ncommercial banks, while an 18% expansion in bond issuance mirrored \nthe pension fund\u2019s conversion of Treasury bills to bonds. Treasury bills \ncontinued to be issued through a \ufb01xed-rate tap system. Interest rates \nwere unchanged after being lowered in October 2015. More than \na quarter of government debt is external, with public and publicly \nguaranteed debt to bilateral and multilateral organizations, commercial \n\ufb01rms, and credit suppliers estimated at $668 million. At the end of 2016, \ntotal public debt was Rf36.7 billion, estimated to equal 63% of GDP, \nunchanged from a year earlier. \n\nLow in\ufb02ation allowed the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) to \nmaintain an accommodative policy in 2016. Banks\u2019 required minimum \nreserve ratio and overnight deposit and borrowing rates were kept low. \nGrowth in loans and advances to the private sector slowed marginally \nto 10.5% from 12.3% in the previous year. Growth in the money supply \nslowed substantially to 0.1% from 12.3% in 2015, mainly re\ufb02ecting a 37% \ndecline in MMA net foreign assets as it purchased a large bond from \nMaldives Airports that allowed the company to pay off a large foreign \nobligation (Box 3.18.1). Banks\u2019 net domestic assets grew by almost 25% \non account of increased investment in securities (Figure 3.18.5).\n\nIn 2010, the government transferred \nresponsibility for operating the \nIbrahim Nasim International Airport \nfrom Maldives Airports to Grandhi \nMallikarjuna Rao Male International \nAirport (GMIAL) for a contracted \n25 years. Two years later, the next \ngovernment cancelled the agreement \nas damaging to Maldives Airports \nand Maldivian citizens.\n\nGMIAL \ufb01led a case in the \n\nSingapore International Arbitration \nCentre, and a settlement was reached \non 25 October 2016. GMIAL had \ndemanded $1.4 billion, but arbitration \nsettled on an award of $208 million \nplus 4 years\u2019 interest and costs for a \ntotal of $271 million, equal to 7.2% \nof GDP. \n\nThe MMA paid GMIAL on \n15 November 2016, completing the \nsettlement quickly because the \ngovernment was concerned about \nrising interest. The government \nmaintains that the money did not \ncome from the state budget but from \nstate institutions providing what it \ncalled \u201cgenerous aid.\u201d \n\nOf the total, $140 million was \n\nraised by the sale to the MMA \nof Maldives Airports bonds \nto be repaid within 3 years at \n4.9% interest. The balance of \n$131 million apparently came from \nMaldives Airports bank accounts.\n\nWith lower tourism receipts but a persistently large trade de\ufb01cit, \n\n3.18.3\u2002Inflation\n\nthe current account de\ufb01cit deteriorated further to the equivalent of \n17.7% of GDP from 9.5% in 2015 (Figure 3.18.6). Exports fell by 14.8%, \nlargely because re-exports of jet fuel declined. Tuna exports were \nbroadly unchanged. Meanwhile, imports grew by 6.5% on higher \ndemand for machinery, building materials, and electrical equipment. \nPayments for services, interest, and worker remittances expanded \nmoderately.\n\nForeign direct investment and other \ufb01nancing in\ufb02ows are estimated \n\nto have increased by 14% in 2016 from a year earlier but were still \ninsufficient to plug the current account gap. The compensation \npayment for the cancelled airport contract reduced gross reserves in \nNovember by $200 million, pulling down usable reserves (gross reserves \nless commercial banks\u2019 foreign currency deposits) to cover for only \n0.6 months of imports.

After large and \npersistent \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits, the government will try to cut expenditure \nfurther and expand its tax base and nontax revenue, targeting a 21% \nincrease in budget resources including grants. The share of recurrent \nspending in total expenditure is programmed to drop further to 61% \nfrom 68% in 2016, while capital spending will grow to 39%, though \nwith a reduced allocation to the public sector investment program. \nThe government projects the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit signi\ufb01cantly narrower, equal \nto 0.5% of GDP in both 2017 and 2018. However, taking into account \nprevious budgets, in which revenue normally fell short by 10%\u201312% \nand expenditure overshot by 5%\u20137%, more realistic forecasts for \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cits are higher, at 6.4% of GDP in 2017 and 6.0% in 2018. \n\nTourism will contribute to future growth prospects as well, with \n\nrecovery expected in the next few years. The government renewed its \nmarketing campaign, Travel Trade Maldives, to run from 2016 to 2020, \naiming to bring in 2 million tourists and $3.5 billion in earnings by 2020. \nPlans exist for 50 new resorts to be constructed in the next 4 years, \n20 of them scheduled to begin operations in 2017. More \ufb02ights are \nplanned to attract more tourists from neighboring countries, and airport \nexpansion on outlying islands is expected to boost tourism. However, \nslow growth in the economies of the main tourist markets could slow \nrecovery. Moreover, further appreciation of the US dollar could weaken \ntourists\u2019 purchasing power. On balance, a moderate recovery of tourism \nis anticipated, with 5%\u20136% growth in arrivals.\n\nIndustries connected with construction and tourism will \nshape growth, as will presidential elections in 2018. The expected \nconstruction boom and a more vibrant tourism industry would have \nspillover on wholesale and retail trade, real estate, and transport and \ncommunications. The presidential election is expected to spur domestic \nspending and likewise stimulate growth, especially in 2018. However, a \npower struggle in the ruling party and mounting political tensions pose \na risk that elections could undermine political stability and threaten \ngrowth prospects. \n\nWith growth in construction and tourism accelerating, GDP is \n\nprojected to pick up to 3.8% in 2017 and further to 4.1% in 2018.

The government \nis trying to cut fuel consumption by introducing renewable energy. \nGreen energy systems were slated to become operational on \ufb01ve islands \nin the \ufb01rst quarter of 2017, and the government aims to generate a \nconsiderable percentage of electricity from renewable sources by the end \nof 2018. If followed through, this would substantially lower electricity \nprices. However, the outlook sees higher global prices for oil and food, \nreduced food subsidies, and in\ufb02ationary pressures from the elections \nedging up average in\ufb02ation to 2.1% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014the perils of rapid urbanization\nUrbanization has gathered pace in the Maldives, with more than \none-third of the population now living in Mal\u00e9 (Figure 3.18.8). As the \ncapital area measures less than 6 square kilometers, urban growth has \nbrought overcrowding, high unemployment, environmental degradation, \nand pressure on housing and other urban infrastructure such as roads, \nsewage systems, and facilities to manage solid waste.\n\nTo ease the housing shortage, the government has opened the \nsector to private developers, introduced socialized housing programs, \nand embarked on ambitious land reclamation and urban development \nprojects. Results to date have been mixed, with the number of \nresidential units markedly higher but prices still prohibitive. Further, \nsome residents who moved to Hulhumal\u00e9 complain about a lack of \njobs. To address unemployment, the government has restricted foreign \nworkers in certain jobs and industries. \n\nthat introduced a new waste collection and management scheme last \nyear. The government earmarked $100 million in the 2017 budget to \nbuild a waste management center for the greater Mal\u00e9 and the Kaafu, \nAlif Alif, and Vaavu atolls. Meanwhile, to control traffic in Mal\u00e9, a \ncongestion tax will be levied starting in 2017.\n\nThe socioeconomic problems brought by rapid urbanization in \n\nMal\u00e9 require, however, more than one-time piecemeal solutions. \nPlans must be consolidated and strategies coordinated between state \nentities and other stakeholders. Development must reach beyond the \ncapital and include nearby islands, ultimately creating a critical mass \nthat would generate jobs and facilitate more efficient delivery and \nmanagement of public services. The government\u2019s planned development \nof greater Mal\u00e9 is a start.

The outlook is for robust recovery in the next 2 years on revived \nagriculture  and  accelerated  spending  on  reconstruction.  Slow  growth  in  worker  remittances,  the \nmajor  source  of  foreign  exchange,  is  pushing  the  current  account  into  deficit.  Reform  to  boost \ninvestment  is  critical  to  lifting  the  growth  trajectory.\n\nEconomic performance\nIn FY2016 (ending 15 July 2016) GDP growth slowed to its lowest rate \nsince FY2002 because of an unusual series of shocks to the economy: \nlarge earthquakes in April and May 2015 that demolished productive \ncapacity and incomes, subsequent delays in earthquake reconstruction, \ntrade and supply disruption from September 2015 to February 2016 as \nsome groups in the southern Terai plains bordering India protested \nagainst the new constitution, and a second year of poor monsoons. \nTogether, these events held growth to only 0.8%, well below the \n4.2% average in FY2011\u2013FY2015 and a recent high of 5.7% in FY2014 \n(Figure 3.19.1).\n\nTrade disruption and delayed reconstruction shrank manufacturing \nand construction sharply, while agriculture and services, which supply \n33% and 52% of GDP respectively, expanded slowly. Among services, \ntrade, transport, and tourism (collectively 25% of GDP) either grew \nonly marginally or contracted. Subsectors mostly reliant on domestic \nmarkets\u2014such as \ufb01nancial intermediation, real estate, education, \nand community, social, and personal services (collectively 24% of \nGDP)\u2014expanded slightly faster with support from overseas workers\u2019 \nremittances. \n\ndisruptions and, in the second half of FY2016, weak agriculture and \nhigher in\ufb02ation in India, to whose currency the Nepali rupee is pegged. \nConsumer in\ufb02ation averaged 9.9% in FY2016 with sharp increases for \nboth food (44% of the consumer price basket) and other goods and \nservices, re\ufb02ecting shortages of essential commodities in the \ufb01rst 3 \nquarters of FY2016 (Figure 3.19.2). Upward deviation from in\ufb02ation \nin India expanded to 4.7 percentage points from 1.9 points in FY2015, \ndampening export competitiveness. \n\nThe government budget registered a surplus equal to 1.4% of GDP \n\nin FY2016, in contrast with the anticipated 7.8% de\ufb01cit to support \nearthquake reconstruction and much-needed investment in \ninfrastructure and social services.

Although \ncapital expenditure rose to 5.2% of GDP from 4.2% in the previous \nyear, it underperformed the 9.3% planned in the FY2016 budget, \nre\ufb02ecting delayed operationalization of the National Reconstruction \nAuthority, trade and supply disruption, and long-standing weaknesses \nin government capacity to plan, prepare, and implement projects \n(Figure 3.19.3). \n\nWith in\ufb02ationary pressure mainly on the supply side, Nepal Rastra \n\nBank, the central bank, pursued an accommodative monetary policy. \nBroad money supply (M2) rose in FY2016 at about the same rate as \nin the previous year. With the \ufb01scal surplus, most of the increase \nwas attributable to the rise in net foreign assets and credit to the \nprivate sector (Figure 3.19.4). \n\nTrade disruption and a stronger currency in in\ufb02ation-adjusted \n\nterms added to long-standing structural constraints and a 29.0% decline \nin FY2016 merchandise exports in US dollar terms. Imports fell by \n7.1% from a higher base, narrowing the trade de\ufb01cit by 1.0 percentage \npoint to the equivalent of 30.3% of GDP. Workers remittances rose \nbut at a much slower pace than before as migrant numbers fell; many \npotential migrants were needed at home after the earthquakes, and \ndemand fell for workers in oil-exporting economies, especially in \nthe Persian Gulf and Malaysia. The reduced trade de\ufb01cit and steady \nremittances contributed to a larger current account surplus, equal to \n6.2% of GDP (Figure 3.19.5). They also pushed foreign exchange reserves \nto $9.7 billion, sufficient for 14 months of imports of goods and nonfactor \nservices (Figure 3.19.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic growth is expected to revive to 5.6% in FY2017 because trade \nand supply disruptions from the Terai unrest have receded, the monsoon \nhas been favorable, and earthquake reconstruction is accelerating. \nOther supports for growth this year are spending on local elections \nscheduled for mid-May 2017 and, signi\ufb01cantly, more reliable electricity. \nKathmandu has suffered very little load-shedding since October 2016, \nin contrast with outages of more than 10 hours per day in previous \nwinters. Other parts of the country have also enjoyed substantially \nbetter electricity supply. Electricity consumption rose sharply with sales \nup by 44% in January 2017 from a year earlier, the increases strong in \nall segments. Improved electricity provision re\ufb02ects more judicious \nmanagement of demand with more equitable distribution of electricity \nacross big industries and other consumers, stricter monitoring that \nreduced transmission and distribution losses by 2 percentage points to \n23.8% as of mid-January 2017, and increased supply from both domestic \ngeneration and imports from India.

Construction should bene\ufb01t from progress in earthquake \nreconstruction. Of some 532,000 families eligible for housing grants \nin the 11 districts worst affected by the earthquakes, 476,000 had by \nthe end of December 2016 signed grant agreements and 452,500 had \nreceived the \ufb01rst installment of NRs50,000 for new home foundations. \nThe government has begun reconstructing some 8,900 classrooms \n(of 49,000 estimated to have been partly or completely destroyed) and \n313 kilometers of roads, as well as health centers, other government \nbuildings, and water-supply systems. \n\nGrowth in services is expected to nearly double to 5.2% in FY2017 \n\nas positive economic trends offset the effect of lackluster remittance \ngrowth. The US dollar value of remittances is projected to rise by \n2.8% in FY2017, well below the 15.0% average from FY2012 to FY2015. \nThe number of migrants going abroad is still declining, albeit more slowly \nafter a sharp fall immediately following the earthquakes, re\ufb02ecting \nin part weaker demand for labor in oil-exporting host countries. \n\nagriculture output increases, trade normalizes, and Indian in\ufb02ation \nabates. Higher public sector salaries and international oil prices appear \nto preclude a sharper decline. Food price in\ufb02ation is expected to slow \nconsiderably more than nonfood in\ufb02ation. As in\ufb02ation slows in Nepal \nmore than in India, the gap between the two will narrow, improving \nNepal\u2019s export competitiveness. Monetary policy has aimed to restrain \nin\ufb02ation by slowing broad money growth. Net foreign assets will rise \nat a slower rate with moderation in remittance growth and a higher \ntrade de\ufb01cit. Bank claims on the government for the full year may rise \nmodestly to fund the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit. \n\nCredit to the private sector is likely to be signi\ufb01cantly higher, \nre\ufb02ecting a pickup in economic activity. Commercial bank credit \nto the private sector has risen steadily since the easing of trade \ndisruptions in February 2016, while growth in deposits hovered \naround 20%, signi\ufb01cantly lifting the loan\u2013deposit ratio (Figure 3.19.8). \nThis has exerted upward pressure on nominal and real interest rates. \nModerating in\ufb02ation gives the central bank scope to increase the money \nsupply somewhat more quickly after taking into account prudential \nnorms in the \ufb01nancial sector. \n\nThe FY2017 budget envisages a de\ufb01cit increase to an estimated \n11% of GDP with substantially higher allocations for both recurrent \nand capital expenditure, including earthquake rehabilitation and \nreconstruction. With expenditure historically falling short of allocation, \nthe actual \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit will likely be around 1% of GDP, modestly \nstimulating growth. Although capital expenditure in the \ufb01rst half of \nFY2017 rose sharply from FY2016, it still fell well short of the budget \ntarget (Figure 3.19.9). Capital spending is likely to accelerate signi\ufb01cantly \nin the second half of the \ufb01scal year, as usual, then revert in FY2017 to \npre-earthquake norms at about 75% of allocations. Revenue is expected \nto track the budget projection as economic activity picks up and a sharp \nincrease in imports means higher duty collections, which contribute \nabout 40% of revenue.\n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit will widen signi\ufb01cantly in FY2017 to 41.5% of \nGDP on the surge in imports in early FY2017 to meet pent-up demand \n\n3.19.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n5.6\n\n6.0\n\n\u20131.6\n\n5.4\n\n6.5\n\n\u20133.2\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 15 July of \nthat year.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nNRs/$\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n$ billion \n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Nepal Rastra Bank. 2017.

The current torrid pace of import growth will \nmoderate after February with erosion of the base effect, imports of rice \npartly replaced by the rise in domestic production, and savings on oil \nimports as better electricity supply lessens industry reliance on diesel \ngenerators. The current account is nevertheless expected to post a \nde\ufb01cit equal to 1.6% of GDP in FY2017, a reversal by nearly 8 percentage \npoints from FY2016, because of the larger trade de\ufb01cit and the slower \nrise in remittances.\n\nGDP growth should continue into FY2018 at 5.4%. This outlook \nassumes a normal monsoon in 2017 and no major political or social \nunrest as local, provincial, and national elections are conducted and the \nnewly elected parliament is installed by January 2018 as mandated by \nthe constitution. Growth should be supported by buoyant agriculture, \nfurther improvement in electricity supply, increased reconstruction \nmomentum, and a likely increase in election-related spending. \nHigher real interest rates and a slower rise in remittances are likely \ndrags on growth. In\ufb02ation may accelerate modestly to 6.5% on higher \ndomestic demand, notably from reconstruction and election-related \nspending, and despite improved domestic supply of agricultural staples. \nEven with high domestic demand, import growth will be moderate \nafter the catchup surge a year earlier. The current account de\ufb01cit is \nnevertheless likely to widen further to equal 3.2% of GDP in FY2018 as \ngrowth in remittances continues to languish.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014investment for higher \nsustainable growth\nNepal needs more and better investment to achieve and sustain high \nrates of economic growth. Fixed capital formation has languished \nbelow the 30% average in South Asia (Figure 3.19.10). Foreign direct \ninvestment is a critical conduit for \ufb01nancial resources and new \ntechniques and technology but has been miniscule despite a recent \nrise in commitments (Figure 3.19.11). Manufacturing and tourism, \ntwo sectors with substantial potential for more productive employment, \nare either shrinking or stagnant. Factors constraining investment are \npolitical and policy instability, de\ufb01cient infrastructure particularly for \nenergy and transport, and inadequate formulation and enforcement of \nregulations to promote vibrant and competitive industries.\n\nSince the promulgation of the constitution in 2015, the prospects \n\nfor relieving constraints on investment have improved because all the \nmain political parties agree on the need to attract investment to fuel \nsustainable economic growth. The reduction in electricity load-shedding \nis a major milestone. The government is implementing a 10-year action \nplan to erase the energy de\ufb01cit by increasing investment in generation, \ntransmission, and distribution infrastructure and by instituting \npolicy and regulatory reform to level the playing \ufb01eld for public and \nprivate participants. Public investment in transport infrastructure \nhas increased, and some major projects such as the Kathmandu\u2013Tarai \nFast Track expressway are being planned.

It will \nestablish a PPP center and streamline procedures for PPP. Capacity needs \nbuttressing, in particular for project preparation, assessing whether \na project should be public or PPP, allocating risks appropriately in \nPPP projects, attracting the private sector, and executing transactions.\nThe government recently enacted some legal changes to improve \n\nthe business climate. The Industrial Enterprise Act and the Special \nEconomic Zone Act are good starts toward making the investment \nenvironment more predictable. The former has introduced online \ufb01rm \nregistration and acceptance of digital signatures, simpli\ufb01ed environment \nimpact assessment, and instituted a \u201cno work, no pay\u201d clause to \ndiscourage ad hoc labor strikes, which have been prevalent in recent \nyears. Similarly, the latter prohibits labor strikes or any other disruption \nto business operations within a special economic zone. A foreign \ninvestment act is in the \ufb01nal stages of enactment. The draft bill \nsimpli\ufb01es approval for foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, \nand equity funds. An amendment to the Company Act to ease company \nexit conditions is expected soon.\n\nDespite progress, a remaining implementation challenge is to \nensure that various legal provisions are consistent and coherent. \nFor example, provisions on \u201cno work, no pay\u201d and related labor issues \nunder the Industrial Enterprise Act could be superseded by the current \nLabor Act. Similarly, incentive schemes offered under various laws suffer \ninconsistent interpretation and application. Different government offices \napprove foreign investment depending on its size, and investors are \nrequired to get approval from both the Department of Industry and the \ncentral bank for establishment and earnings repatriation. In addition, \ninvestors are required to register with the Office of Company Registrar \nand the tax and immigration offices. Businesses and investors often \npoint to a complicated web of procedures and delays they often \nencounter at each agency. Eliminating regulatory inconsistency \nand transparently enforcing rules would enhance the prospects for \ninvestment.\n\n\fPakistan\n\nGrowth  accelerated  in  FY2016,  benefiting  from  major  economic  reforms  and  improved  security. \nLow  oil  prices  helped  slow  inflation  markedly  and  keep  the  current  account  deficit  moderate \ndespite weaker exports. The outlook is for higher growth, with inflation and current account deficit \nedging  up  on  higher  oil  prices  and  substantial  imports  for  a  major  investment  project.  Continued \neconomic  reform  is  essential  to  reach  a  high  growth  trajectory.\n\nEconomic performance\nProvisional estimates put GDP growth at 4.7% in FY2016 (ended 30 June \n2016), driven by robust growth in services and industry (Figure 3.20.1). \nGrowth recovery in large-scale manufacturing to 4.6% and in \nconstruction to 13.8% underpinned 6.8% expansion in industry. \nAutomobiles, fertilizer, and cement were among manufactures with \nnotable growth. Industry expansion, \ufb01nancial sector strengthening, \nand increasingly active trade fueled 5.7% expansion in services, which \nwas 1.4 percentage points higher than in the previous year. GDP growth \nwas restrained, however, by a 0.2% fall in agriculture output as adverse \nweather and pest infestations caused heavy losses, especially of cotton, \nwhich had knock-on effects on textile manufacturing and external \ntrade. To cushion the impact on smallholder farmers, the government \nintroduced a support package to subsidize agricultural inputs.\n\nOn the expenditure side, private consumption continued to drive \n\ngrowth, the substantial government contribution to it varying from \nyear to year depending on the \ufb01nancial situation and wage adjustments \n(Figure 3.20.2). Investment continued to be, at 15.1% of GDP, very low \nwhen compared with similar countries in the region, constraining \ngrowth. The main causes of low investment are infrastructure \nde\ufb01cits exempli\ufb01ed by crippling power outages, a difficult business \nenvironment, security issues, and bouts of macroeconomic instability. \nFixed investment from the government and public enterprises increased \nby 12.9% to equal 3.8% of GDP, but private investment fell slightly \nfrom 10.2% of GDP to 9.8% (Figure 3.20.3). Net exports subtracted \nfrom GDP growth, but the roughly 40% plunge in global oil prices in \nFY2016 improved the terms of trade by 10%, allowed the US dollar value \nof imports to fall from the year earlier even as the government and \nthe private sector imported markedly higher volumes of goods other \nthan oil. \n\nAverage headline consumer in\ufb02ation fell from 4.5% to 2.9% in \nFY2016 because of lower global prices for oil and other commodities, \nstable food supply, limited government borrowing, and exchange rate \n\nThis chapter was written by Guntur Sugiyarto and Farzana Noshab of the Pakistan \nResident Mission, ADB, Islamabad.\n\n3.20.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nServices\nIndustry\nAgriculture\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.8\n\n3.7\n\n4.1\n\n4.0\n\n4.7\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

At the same time, average core in\ufb02ation, \nother than for food and energy, improved from 6.6% in FY2015 to 4.2%. \nAs in\ufb02ation fell, the State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, lowered \nits policy rate by a cumulative 75 basis points to 5.75% (Figure 3.20.5). \nWith an improved economic environment and lower-cost borrowing, \ncredit to the private sector doubled to PRs461 billion, the strongest \nexpansion in recent years.\n\nAs the government improved revenue collection and restricted \nexpenditure, the de\ufb01cit in the general government budget, which \nconsolidates federal and provincial budgets but excludes grants, \nnarrowed by 0.8 percentage points to equal 4.6% of GDP in FY2016 \n(Figure 3.20.6). The Federal Board of Revenue boosted tax collection \nto PRs3.1 trillion, or 11.4% of GDP, and this was the major factor \naccounting for a 21.0% increase in tax revenue. Despite a marked decline \nin nontax revenue, total budget revenue increased to equal 15.0% of \nGDP as planned, though achieving this required the implementation \nof additional excise and customs taxes to cover shortfalls in oil import \nduties in the second half of the year. \n\npercentage points higher than in the previous year. Growth in current \nexpenditure slowed from 10.5% in FY2015 to 6.1%. Expenditure on \ninterest payments fell because of interest rate cuts, as did those on \nsubsidies owing to rationalized energy tariffs. Development expenditure \nincreased by 17.0%, reversing a 2.0% decline in the previous year. At the \nequivalent of only 4.4% of GDP, however, it was held below target by \nconstraints on spending. \n\nThe lower budget de\ufb01cit was \ufb01nanced largely from domestic sources. \nDomestic debt expanded in FY2016 by an amount equal to 1.7 percentage \npoints of GDP, raising it to 46.0% of GDP and all public debt to 66.4% \n(Figure 3.20.7). Public external debt increased slightly to 20.4% \nafter declining by 10.4 percentage points over the previous 5 years. \nThe increase in external debt was largely from expanded multilateral \nand bilateral in\ufb02ows but also re\ufb02ected exchange rate adjustments. \nAn amendment in 2016 to the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation \nAct, 2005 rede\ufb01ned public external debt as debt serviced from the \nconsolidated fund and debt owed to the International Monetary Fund. \nThe new de\ufb01nition excluded a minor category called external liabilities, \nwhich at the end of June 2016 equaled 1.3% of GDP, largely unchanged \nfrom a year earlier. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit widened from the equivalent of 1.0% \nof GDP in FY2015 to 1.2% as exports declined, net interest payments \nincreased, and growth in worker remittances slowed (Figure 3.20.8). \nExports fell by 8.8% as slow growth in the major industrial economies \nundercut demand, the cotton crop failed, world prices fell for Pakistan\u2019s \nexports, and domestic production costs rose. The gains from a 32% \nfall in oil imports were partly offset by a 7.2% surge in other imports, \nespecially cotton and machinery for textile production and electric \npower generation. Workers\u2019 remittances reached $19.9 billion, but this \ngrowth at 6.4% was less than half of the 16.0% average over the past \ndecade (Figure 3.20.9).

This outlook is supported by better security, macroeconomic \nstability, and improved economic fundamentals resulting from the \ncontinued implementation of government reform under a 3-year \nInternational Monetary Fund program completed in September 2016, as \nwell as ongoing and planned infrastructure and other investments under \nan economic corridor project called CPEC, which links Pakistan with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). These favorable developments are \nre\ufb02ected in Standard & Poor\u2019s upgrading Pakistan\u2019s credit rating to B \nin October 2016, and Fitch doing the same in February 2017. Moreover, \nthe Pakistan Stock Exchange scored the highest price increase in Asia \nin 2016 (Figure 3.20.10). Pakistan\u2019s reentry into the MSCI Emerging \nMarket Index, scheduled for May 2017 after a 9-year hiatus, further \nunderlines investor con\ufb01dence in the economy. In this connection, \na consortium of three PRC stock exchanges invested $85 million in \nDecember 2016 to acquire 40% of strategic shares in the Pakistan \nStock Exchange.\n\nHigher growth in FY2018 re\ufb02ects accelerated infrastructure \ninvestment through CPEC, which is steadily lifting consumer and \ninvestor con\ufb01dence and thereby further catalyzing economic activity. \nThe government can lend policy support by maintaining macroeconomic \nstability and addressing structural issues that continue to inhibit exports \ndespite the easing of regulatory constraints on doing business. With \nnational elections scheduled for 2018, the budget to be announced in \nJune 2017 will likely prioritize measures to foster economic expansion. \nThe forecast for growth in FY2017 envisages revived agriculture as \n\nrecovery in cotton and sugarcane offset a forecast decline in the rice \ncrop. The revival is underpinned by special credit facilities, subsidized \nfertilizer, and improved global commodity prices. Favorable weather, \nincluding timely rains in January 2017, augurs for a strong winter wheat \ncrop. Prevailing low interest rates, improved electricity supply, and \ngovernment budgetary incentives announced in June 2016 should boost \nlarge-scale manufacturing. The government announced in January 2017 \na support package worth $17 billion for exports of textiles, clothing, and \nrelated raw materials. It is expected to revitalize the textile industry, \nwhich suffered from a weak cotton crop and frail global demand last \nyear. Stronger growth in industry and agriculture will catalyze activity \nin the service sector. \n\nAverage consumer in\ufb02ation is expected to accelerate to 4.0% \nin FY2017 on a rebound in oil prices, higher domestic demand, and \nexpanded government borrowing from the central bank.

The government passed the global \noil price increases on to domestic consumers by raising domestic oil \nprices three times from December 2016 to February 2017, after having \nkept them low for several months. A continued recovery in oil prices will \nlikely accelerate in\ufb02ation, which is projected to reach 4.8% in FY2018. \nThe central bank will need to be vigilant and readjust its accommodative \nmonetary policy if in\ufb02ationary pressures intensify.\n\nThe general government budget de\ufb01cit is projected to shrink to \nthe equivalent of 3.8% of GDP in FY2017. This assumes total revenue \nequaling 15.8% of GDP, based on Federal Board of Revenue tax \ncollection at 10.8% of GDP, and continued expenditure rationalization. \nTo achieve the lower de\ufb01cit, additional measures may be needed in \nthe remaining months of FY2017 to bridge a revenue shortfall in the \n\ufb01rst half of the year, though higher imports and the pass-through of \nhigher oil prices to consumers may be sufficient to boost indirect tax \nrevenue. A shortfall in nontax revenue poses an additional challenge, \nbut it should be mitigated somewhat by expected in\ufb02ows under the \nCoalition Support Fund and, if accomplished, the budgeted sale of the \n3G telecom spectrum.\n\nin the \ufb01rst half were, at 8.3% of GDP, about the same as last year \nbecause the government was able to contain current expenditure by \ncurtailing domestic interest payments and spending on other categories \nincluding subsidies. Consolidated federal and provincial development \nspending was also low in this period at 1.5% of GDP, less than a third of \nthe FY2017 full year target of 4.7%. Any provincial overspending in the \nfull year, especially infrastructure development that looks ahead to the \nelection, may challenge a key budgetary assumption that the provinces \nwill record a cash surplus of PRs339 billion, equal to 1.0% of GDP. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is projected to widen to equal 2.1% of \nGDP in FY2017. The de\ufb01cit increased to $4.7 billion in the \ufb01rst 7 months \nof FY2017, almost double the $2.5 billion de\ufb01cit in the same period of \nFY2016. Services and income account de\ufb01cits worsened as receipts \nunder the Coalition Support Fund were delayed. Meanwhile, the \nworkers\u2019 remittances that critically offset the large trade de\ufb01cit fell for \nthe \ufb01rst time in 10 years, by 1.9% to $10.9 billion, because of declining \nexpenditures and income in oil-dependent Gulf economies.\n\nThe trade de\ufb01cit widened in the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2017 by 21.1% \nto $13 billion as imports accelerated by 9.2%, driven by an 18% increase \nin investment goods and a 12% rise in oil import payments as prices \nrecovered. Investment goods accounted for 40% of the increase in \nimports, and oil nearly 30%. Exports continued to decline, but by \nonly 1.3%, which was much smaller than the 11.7% plunge in the same \nperiod of FY2016. A third consecutive year of falling exports re\ufb02ects \nweak global demand and low international commodity prices but also \ndomestic structural issues such as power outages, scant investment \nin modernization, and currency appreciation in real effective terms, \nall of which hamper competitiveness. The nominal exchange rate was \nstable at PRs104.7 to the US dollar in the \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2017, but \nthe Pakistan rupee continued to appreciate in real effective terms, \nundermining export competitiveness (Figure 3.20.11). \n\n3.20.8\u2002Current account components\n\nCurrent transfers including remittances\nTrade balance\nServices\nIncome\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n$ billion\n\n% of GDP\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016 Jul\u2013Jan\n2016\n\nJul\u2013Jan\n2017\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan.

The higher in\ufb02ows to the \ufb01nancial account from \nmultilateral and bilateral disbursements, along with non-debt in\ufb02ows in \nthe \ufb01rst 7 months of FY2017, are providing a cushion for the widening \ncurrent account de\ufb01cit. Portfolio investment jumped more than \nfourfold to $670 million, and foreign direct investment increased to \n$1.2 billion with investments into dairy, consumer electronics, electric \npower, and oil and gas. However, amortization payments on long-term \ngovernment debt also increased markedly. Expected disbursements \nfrom multilateral development partners in the remaining months of the \n\ufb01scal year will be needed to reverse contraction in official reserves as of \nFebruary 2017.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014realizing potential \nfrom the economic corridor\nThe economic corridor project CPEC, which runs from the Xinjiang \nUyghur Autonomous Region in the PRC to the Pakistani port of \nGwadar on the Arabian Sea, is expected to bring substantial bene\ufb01ts \nto the economy. Announced in April 2015 as a $46 billion project, but \nsubsequently increased to $55 billion, it provides for major investments \nin energy and transport infrastructure. CPEC will be \ufb01nanced largely \nby the PRC and is expected to be completed by 2030. The project will \nsigni\ufb01cantly address Pakistan\u2019s infrastructure de\ufb01cit caused by annual \nspending on infrastructure at only 2%\u20133% of GDP in the past 4 decades. \nThe government has identi\ufb01ed \u201cearly harvest\u201d infrastructure projects \nthat will be completed in the next few years. Of these, $21 billion will be \non energy projects (Table 3.20.2). These will be \ufb01nanced by foreign direct \ninvestment from the PRC supported by borrowing from banks there. \nIndependent electricity-generating \ufb01rms will be offered guaranteed \ntariffs for their sales to distribution companies that will ensure at least \n17% return on equity. About $10 billion in investments in transport \ninfrastructure will be \ufb01nanced by a combination of concessional and \ncommercial loans from the Government of the PRC.\n\nFor Pakistan, CPEC is expected to be a major opportunity to \nboost growth and development. CPEC is expected to provide many \nbene\ufb01ts, especially eliminating the power shortages that have held \ndown economic growth in recent years. It will improve connectivity \nto domestic and international markets and so bene\ufb01t Pakistan\u2019s \nlagging regions. The large investment in infrastructure should boost \nconstruction and related industries, spurring job creation and growth. \nIn the long run, goods from the PRC transiting from northern Pakistan \nto the seaport will bolster the transport sector, further stimulating \n\n\f216\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\n3.20.2\u2002CPEC priority energy projects\n\nProject name \n\nPort Qasim 2 x 660 MW coal \ufb01red\n\nSahiwal 2 x 660 MW coal \ufb01red\n\nEngro Thar 4 x 330 MW coal \ufb01red\n\nThar coal surface mine, 6.5 tons per annum\n\nGwadar coal/LNG/oil \ufb01red\n\nHub Power 1 x 660 MW coal \ufb01red\n\nRahimyar Khan coal \ufb01red\n\nSSRL Thar coal block 1\u20136.5 tons per annum\n\nZonergy 900 MW solar park\n\nDawood 50 MW wind farm\n\nUnited Energy Pakistan 100 MW wind farm\n\nSachal 50 MW wind farm\n\nSuki Kinari hydropower station\n\nKarot hydropower station\n\nMatiari\u2013Lahore transmission line\n\nMatiari\u2013Faisalabad transmission line\n\n1,320\n\n1,320\n\n1,320\n\n300\n\n660\n\n1,320\n\n900\n\n50\n\n100\n\n50\n\n870\n\n720\n\nInstalled \ncapacity\n\nEstimated cost \n($ million)\n\nProgress update \n\n65% of power plant and 70% of jetty completed\n\nJune 2018\n\n1,980\n\n1,600\n\n2,000\n\n1,470\n\n600\n\n970\n\n1,600\n\n1,300\n\n2,000\n\n1,215\n\n125\n\n250\n\n134\n\n1,802\n\n1,420\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\nCivil works 95% completed\n\nConstruction in progress\n\nIA/EA signed\n\nExpect to start work in March 2017\n\nIA/EA signed\n\nFeasibility in progress\n\nOpen pit mining\n\nOperating\n\nConstruction started\n\n61\u201366 turbines completed\n\nConstruction in progress\n\nContractor mobilized to start construction\n\nConstruction in progress\n\nFeasibility study completed, TSA/IA initialed\n\nFeasibility study completed, TSA/IA initialed\n\nEstimated  \nCOD\n\nDecember 2017\n\nJune 2019\n\n2018/2019\n\n2018/2019\n\n2018/2019\n\n2018/2019\n\nAugust 2016\n\nJanuary 2017\n\nJune 2017\n\nJune 2017\n\n2021/2022\n\n2021/2022\n\n2018/2019\n\n2018/2019\n\nSSRL 2 x 660 MW mine mouth power plant\n\n1,320\n\nIndependent power producer\n\nTotal\n\n10,250\n\n21,466\n\nCOD = commercial operation date, CPEC = economic corridor linking Pakistan with the People\u2019s Republic of China, EA = environmental assessment, IA = implementation \nagreement, LNG = lique\ufb01ed natural gas, MW = megawatt, SSRL = Sino-Sindh Resources, TSA = technical service agreement.\nSource: www//cpec.gov.pk\n\nprivate investment and activity. Moreover, the extensive upgrading of \nPakistan\u2019s infrastructure is expected to attract direct investment from \nabroad, including mature industries in the PRC that seek lower-cost \nlocations. \n\nAt the same time, CPEC investments are likely to require signi\ufb01cant \n\nincreases in imports of equipment and services to implement the \nprojects. In the medium-to-long term, these in\ufb02ows will likely be \nfollowed by \ufb01nancial out\ufb02ows as loans are repaid and pro\ufb01ts repatriated \nto foreign investors. Higher foreign exchange earnings and exports will \nbe needed to avoid pressure on the external account. \n\nTo reap the potential bene\ufb01ts of CPEC and shift the economy of \nPakistan to a higher growth trajectory, the government must continue \nto address key constraints on growth. Domestic security has improved \nsigni\ufb01cantly in recent years, but consolidating these gains will take \ncontinued efforts. Regulation remains burdensome, requiring more \nreform to provide an enabling environment that facilitates business and \nfosters investment. Reform to boost exports by diversifying products \nand markets and by adopting more \ufb02exible exchange rate policies are \nneeded to maintain external stability. Similarly, structural reform to the \nenergy sector and state-owned enterprises are required to fully realize \ninvestments\u2019 productive potential.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  2016  with  a  marked  fall  in  agricultural  production,  but  a  pickup  in  construction \nand investment helped to sustain growth. Inflation was highly variable over the year but moderated \nin general, as did the current account deficit. The outlook is for modest recovery in growth as the \ngovernment implements an economic program of fiscal reform to tackle persistent macroeconomic \nimbalances  and  a  large  public  debt.\n\nEconomic performance \nOver the past 4 years, growth has markedly slowed from the rapid \npace of the economic boom that came with the end of civil con\ufb02ict \nin May 2009. Economic growth in 2016 was affected by bad weather, \nwith provisional estimates putting growth at 4.4% in 2016, lower \nthan the 4.8% expansion a year earlier (Figure 3.21.1). To address \npersistent macroeconomic imbalances and deterioration in the balance \nof payments, the government in June 2016 obtained support from the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) for a 3-year extended fund facility \nto pursue revenue-based \ufb01scal consolidation.\n\nOn the supply side, agriculture contracted by 4.2% because of \n\ufb02oods in May 2016 and a drought that has dragged on since August. \nConstruction expansion at 14.9% provided the impetus for 6.7% growth \nin industry. Buoyant construction was driven by private sector projects \nsupported by a rapid increase in bank credit to the private sector. \nGrowth in manufacturing slowed from a year earlier, mainly because \nof weakness in the textile and garment industries. Services growth \nslackened to 4.2% from 5.7%, mainly with slowing in wholesale and \nretail trade and government-related services.\n\nProvisional demand-side estimates of GDP show \ufb01xed investment \nrebounding to grow by 10%, up from 3% a year earlier, and a surge in \ninventory building that made these two areas the main sources of \ngrowth in 2016 (Figure 3.21.2). Consumption expenditure grew by only \n1% as \ufb01scal policies tightened following a 9% upsurge in spending fueled \nby highly expansive \ufb01scal policies a year earlier, which put pressure on \nthe balance of payments and on reserves. Net exports continued to be \na sizable drag on GDP growth because a large fall in global oil prices \nimproved the terms of trade and thus enabled other imports to expand. \nExport volume fell by 1% in 2016 on weak agricultural sales, reversing \nexpanded export volumes in recent years even as prices languished. \nAverage annual in\ufb02ation moderated to 4.0% in 2016 as measured \nby the national consumer price index. Food in\ufb02ation pushed overall \nin\ufb02ation higher after major \ufb02ooding in May 2016, subsiding later but \nspiking in January and February 2017 to 10.2% partly because of a low \n\nThis chapter was written by Tadateru Hayashi and Savindi Jayakody of the Sri Lanka \nResident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n3.21.1\u2002GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n9.1\n\n5.0\n\n4.8\n\n3.4\n\n4.4\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. \nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/ (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.2\u2002Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nChange in stocks\nInvestment\nConsumption\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n%\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\u20136\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f218\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nbase effect but also as drought hit supplies (Figure 3.21.3). Nonfood \nin\ufb02ation trended higher in the second half of the year because of \nSri Lanka rupee depreciation and a value-added tax (VAT) rate hike \nin November 2016. Core in\ufb02ation, which excludes fresh food, rice, \ncoconuts, energy, and transport, more than doubled from 3.0% in \nearly 2016 to 6.7% in December, further quickening to 7.1% in January \nand February 2017. \n\nMonetary policy switched to tightening in 2016 to slow very rapid \ngrowth in credit to the private sector that began in mid-2014 and to ease \npressure on the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves. \nThe Central Bank of Sri Lanka \ufb01rst tightened monetary policy in \nJanuary 2016 by raising the statutory reserve ratio by 1.5 percentage \npoints to 7.5%. It subsequently increased its policy rates by 50 basis \npoints each in February and July 2016 and then again in March 2017 by \n25 basis points to bring the lending facility rate to 8.75% (Figure 3.21.4). \nThe upward adjustment in bank lending rates started to slow growth \nin private sector credit only in August 2016, and growth remained high \nat 21.9% in December 2016 (Figure 3.21.5). \n\nRaising the country\u2019s very low revenue ratio is the major priority \nof \ufb01scal consolidation under the IMF program. As the \ufb01rst step, the \ngovernment increased the VAT rate from 11% to 15% in May 2016, but \nthe hike was suspended in July to complete legal procedures and took \neffect only from 1 November. With the delay in introducing the VAT rate \nincrease, the ratio of tax revenue to GDP in 2016 was an estimated 11.9%, \na reduction of 0.2 percentage points from 2015, when revenue bene\ufb01ted \nfrom a one-off tax. To achieve 2016 budget de\ufb01cit targets, recurrent \nexpenditure was trimmed and public investment cut to the equivalent \nof 4.8% of GDP from 5.4% in the previous year. As a result, the overall \nbudget de\ufb01cit shrank to an estimated 5.6% of GDP from 7.6% in 2015 \n(Figure 3.21.6). Government debt increased to an estimated 79.4% of \nGDP in September 2016 from 77.6% in 2015 (Figure 3.21.7). \n\nExport earnings fell in 2016 by 2.2%, improving on the 5.6% drop \na year earlier. Agricultural products such as tea and spices declined by \n6.3%, mainly because bad weather reduced production, though export \nprices \ufb01rmed slightly. Garment exports, which bring in nearly half of \nall export earnings, increased by only 1.3% as a decline in sales to the \nEuropean Union countered the bene\ufb01ts of expansion into new markets. \nImports picked up by 2.5%, mainly on large increases for building \nmaterials and for machinery and equipment, as a 41.5% plunge in vehicle \nimports fully explained an 8.4% drop for consumer goods. Oil imports \nrose markedly during the fourth quarter, re\ufb02ecting increased reliance \non thermal power generation to offset hydropower losses caused by the \ndrought. Nevertheless, the large average fall in global oil prices during \nthe year meant a low fuel bill, which largely offset higher spending on \nother intermediate goods. The trade de\ufb01cit in 2016 was $9.1 billion, up \nfrom $8.4 billion in 2015.\n\nWorker remittances grew by 3.7% to $7.2 billion in 2016, posting \nrecovery from a small decline in 2015 but languishing well below growth \nin earlier years.

The current account de\ufb01cit is estimated \nto have narrowed to the equivalent of 2.1% of GDP in 2016 from 2.5% \nin 2015. The official balance of payments estimate is not yet available. \nWhile the current account remained stable, the \ufb01nancial account \nwas weak despite a $1.5 billion sovereign bond issued in July 2016, as the \ngovernment apparently suffered net capital out\ufb02ow as foreign investors \nexited government securities. The 2016 overall balance of payments \nde\ufb01cit is estimated by the central bank at $500 million, one-third of \nthe de\ufb01cit in 2015. Gross official reserves fell to $6.0 billion at the \nend of December 2016 (Figure 3.21.8). The rupee depreciated slightly \nagainst the US dollar, by 3.4%, mostly in the second half of the year \n(Figure 3.21.9). It depreciated in real effective terms by an average of \n2.6% from a year earlier, suggesting improved competitiveness. \n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic growth in 2017 and 2018 will be constrained by tight \ufb01scal \nand monetary policies under the IMF program. Because consumption \nwill be subdued, private investment will again have to play a primary \nrole in maintaining economic growth. The higher VAT introduced \nin 2016 and improved income tax collection in 2017 will depress \nconsumption, outweighing the positive impact of a modest increase \nexpected in worker remittance earnings. While the March maha rice \nharvest was expected to be affected by continuing drought, an assumed \nreturn to normal rainfall promises to allow agriculture production to \nrebound starting in the second quarter. \n\nPrivate investment is expected to continue to expand modestly \nin 2017. While monetary tightening has slowed the expansion of credit \nto the private sector, credit for productive purposes will be available \neven with the boost in policy rates announced in March 2017. However, \nfurther monetary tightening in response to adverse developments \ncannot be ruled out in 2017. Further, a substantial increase in budgeted \npublic investment will be realized only with strong revenue performance \nand rationalized current expenditure to offset any increased cost of \ndrought relief or other contingencies. Faster growth expected in the \nmajor industrial economies should lift export performance, but this will \nbe offset to some degree by higher oil prices. On balance, GDP growth \nis expected to edge up to 5.0% in 2017, the rate maintained in 2018 with \nfurther consolidation reform. \n\nUnder the IMF program, \ufb01scal policy will pursue further revenue \n\nmeasures to eliminate the primary de\ufb01cit, which disregards interest \npayments. The government projected a budget de\ufb01cit equal to 4.6% of \nGDP in 2017, down from an estimated 5.6% in 2016. The narrowing of \nthe de\ufb01cit is attributable to an expected nominal increase in tax revenue \nby 25%, against a 13% increase in government expenditure. The goal \nis for total revenue to equal 15.0% of GDP in 2017. Apart from the \nVAT rate increase implemented in November 2016, additional revenue \nis to come mainly from more efficient income tax collection with the \nfull implementation of a new revenue administration management \ninformation system. Moreover, the tax net will be cast wider in 2017 \n\n3.21.6\u2002 Government finance\n\nRevenue including grants\nRecurrent expenditure\nPublic investment\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nBudget\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.7\u2002 Government debt\n\nForeign\nDomestic\nTotal\n\n% of GDP\n\n68.7\n\n70.8\n\n71.3\n\n77.6\n\n79.4\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Monthly Economic \nIndicators.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.21.8\u2002Gross official reserves\n\nAmount\n\nImport cover\n\n$ billion\n\nMonths of imports\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka; various press releases \npublished on External Position. \nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f220\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nunder amendments to the Inland Revenue Act aiming to foster tax \ncollection and abolish tax exemptions. Expenditure is projected equal \nto 19.6% of GDP, or 0.4 percentage points higher than in 2016. Higher-\nthan-expected interest expenses from further monetary tightening or \nany other contingency such as payments in connection with the drought \nwould likely cause the government to delay or cut infrastructure \nspending to meet the primary de\ufb01cit target under the IMF program. \n\nIn\ufb02ationary pressure from the higher VAT and modest depreciation \n\nof the rupee in the second half of 2016 will add to in\ufb02ation expected \nfrom slightly higher import prices. An automatic pricing formula for \nfuel and electricity has not yet been introduced. In\ufb02ation will be under \nless pressure from the demand side because growth will accelerate only \nslightly and the public expects \ufb01scal austerity. Accordingly, average \nin\ufb02ation is projected at 6.0% in 2017 and 2018. \n\nExternal demand is expected to recover gradually in 2017 and 2018. \n\nExports are projected to grow by 4% in 2017 and 5% in 2018 on the \nbases of gradual recovery of global demand, the renewal of concessions \nunder the Generalized System of Preferences Plus, the removal of the \nEuropean Union ban on \ufb01sh imports, and the possible \ufb01nalization of \nseveral free trade agreements. A larger services surplus will be driven \nby continued rapid expansion in tourism over the next 2 years. Worker \nremittances are expected to increase at a moderate pace. Projected \nexport revenues should allow imports to expand by 5% in 2017 and 6% \nin 2018 without much widening of the current account de\ufb01cit as a share \nof GDP. In addition to expected higher oil prices, imports will be on the \nrise because of continued imports of machinery and equipment and of \nbuilding materials. The current account de\ufb01cit is expected to equal 2.2% \nof GDP in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 3.21.10).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strategies for  \nexport-oriented manufacturing\nDespite reaching per capita income close to the upper-middle-income \nthreshold, Sri Lanka persistently relies on a narrow manufacturing \nbase. Exports are still 60% apparel and tea, and worker remittances \nremain a major source of foreign currency earnings. Since the end of \nthe civil con\ufb02ict in 2009, Sri Lanka has not attracted much foreign \ndirect investment in manufacturing that could diversify production \nand exports.\n\nAlso important is to expand economic activity beyond Colombo and \nWestern Province. As of 2015, Western Province, one of nine provinces, \nproduced 41% of GDP. Further, per capita GDP in Western Province is \nabout 1.4 times higher than in other provinces, underlining the need \nfor regional development to make economic growth more inclusive \n(Figure 3.21.11).\n\nThe government recognizes the importance of diversifying the export \nbase, and the Prime Minister\u2019s economic statement to Parliament in 2016 \nhighlighted export-oriented foreign direct investment.

The corridors will align with major transport networks \nand connect urban clusters and rural areas with industrial zones. \nThey will be publicly planned but driven by the private sector, \nfacilitating industrial investment by easing infrastructure constraints, \nimproving access to markets, stimulating trade, and boosting production \nefficiency. These corridors have potential to diversify manufacturing \nand agriculture production bases, help domestic \ufb01rms become part \nof global value chains, boost productivity across sectors, and create \nproductive jobs. \n\nFor the implementation of economic corridor development to \nsucceed, it is imperative to identify new industrial clusters with \nfuture growth sectors and nodes along the corridors. Infrastructure \nrequirements need to be identi\ufb01ed to support node development. \nPolicy reform will be needed, especially to improve the investment \nclimate. Finding skilled labor and creating a sound regulatory \nframework for corridor development are among the challenges to be \nmet.

Large construction projects and \nrecovering  oil  and  gas  production  and  prices  are  expected  to  lift  GDP  and  inflation  into  positive \nterritory  and  narrow  the  fiscal  gap.  Sustainable  long-term  growth  demands  substantial  reform  to \nthe  business  environment  to  attract  foreign  investors  to  new  industries.\n\nEconomic performance \nDeclining oil and natural gas production, consequently lower \ngovernment revenue, and selected spending cuts caused the economy to \ncontract for a fourth consecutive year in 2016 (Figure 3.22.1). GDP fell by \nan estimated 2.5%.\n\nOil production fell by 5% in 2016, and natural gas by 2%. \n\nOil production has slid by 45% since 2006 as oil \ufb01elds aged and suffered \nstoppages for repairs and maintenance (Figure 3.22.2). Last year also \nsaw a methanol plant that uses natural gas as its main input closed for \nrepairs for 2 months. The ripple effects of the decline in the oil industry \nlast year were felt in the rest of the economy, which also contracted.\nReduced spending by the oil industry and the government hurt \n\nincomes and employment, curbing private consumption and causing \n\ufb01xed investment to fall, according to data for the \ufb01rst 3 quarters of 2016. \nCar sales, for example, fell by 12%. Net external demand dragged on \nGDP growth as exports of goods and services fell in real terms while \nreal imports were relatively steady. Exports of oil and lique\ufb01ed natural \ngas, which account for the bulk of exports, fell in 2016 by 4.6% and 1.2%, \nrespectively, in volume terms.\n\nGovernment consumption spending declined by 9% in real terms \nin the \ufb01rst 3 quarters. Government revenue, largely from oil and gas, \nslumped by an estimated one-third in nominal terms in FY2016 (ended \n31 March 2017), following an even steeper decline in the previous year \n(Figure 3.22.3). Over the past 5 years, the estimated ratio of government \nrevenue to GDP has plunged from 55% to 15%. In the meantime, despite \ntrims to certain categories of government spending, the share of total \ngovernment expenditure to GDP rose from 31% to 35%, turning budget \nsurpluses enjoyed until 2013 into de\ufb01cits. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit widened to \nan estimated 20% of GDP last year from 15% in 2015.\n\nConsumer prices eased for a third consecutive year, with the \n\nconsumer price index down by 0.7% in 2016.

Pegged at par to the Singapore dollar, the Brunei \ndollar depreciated by 2% against the US dollar. \n\nLower export volumes and prices for hydrocarbons shrank the \nUS dollar value of merchandise exports by 20%. Merchandise imports \nfell by 17%. The trade surplus narrowed by 24% in 2016 for a 75% \ndecline since 2012 (Figure 3.22.4). Declining trade surpluses have \nweighed on the current account, narrowing the surplus in 2016 to an \nestimated equivalent of 11% of GDP. International reserves at $3.3 billion \ncovered 15 months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects \nA projected modest increase in hydrocarbon exports for higher prices \nshould restore GDP growth this year and next. Several large construction \nprojects will provide additional impetus if they proceed as planned. \nGDP is forecast to grow by 1.0% in 2017, quickening to 2.5% in 2018. \n\nConstruction is expected to swing from contraction in 2016 to \n\nexpansion in 2017. A company from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nplans to start building this year a $2.5 billion oil re\ufb01nery and aromatics \ncracker plant once a bridge and jetties are completed at the site on \nPulau Muara Besar. Construction is expected to take at least 2 years, \nwith exports scheduled to start in late 2019. Public construction projects \ninclude the $1.1 billion Temburong Bridge, which will continue into 2019. \nThe economy is showing tentative signs of gradual diversi\ufb01cation \n\naway from oil and gas. A company from the PRC plans to develop \nMuara port, and another is building a $50 million plant to make carbon \nsteel pipe.

Brunei Darussalam has attracted in recent years a center that \ntrains helicopter and \ufb01xed-wing pilots and other ventures that produce \nanimal feed, halal food, and pharmaceuticals. \n\nConsumer prices are seen turning up mainly on higher prices for \nfood and fuel, though subsidies and price controls cushion the impact of \nglobal price movements on domestic prices (Figure 3.22.5).\n\nExport earnings will get a lift from higher prices for hydrocarbons, \nbut imports, too, are expected to rise as investment picks up.

Oil and gas directly provide more than 50% \nof GDP, over 90% of exports, and 80% of government revenue. Shifting \ngrowth toward other export-oriented industries will require deeper \nreform to the business environment to attract investment. \n\nEncouragingly, over recent years the government has taken steps to \n\nimprove the business climate: lowering the corporate income tax rate \nto 18.5% with tax exemptions for pioneer industries, allowing 100% \nforeign ownership in domestic companies, competitively pricing land \nand utilities in industrial parks, and establishing a special office in the \nBrunei Economic Development Board to fast-track foreign investment \nprojects. It has outlined plans for a free-trade zone to attract foreign \ndirect investment.\n\nThese reforms enabled the country to move up signi\ufb01cantly in \nthe latest World Bank Doing Business ranking, from 97 among 189 \ncountries surveyed in 2016 to 72 among 190 in 2017. Brunei Darussalam \nnevertheless lags less prosperous neighbors such as Malaysia and \nThailand (Table 3.22.2). Moreover, it ranked a low 142 in terms of \ntrading across borders and 134 in property registration, behind not \nonly Malaysia and Thailand but also Indonesia, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam. It was far down the rankings in protecting the rights of \nminority shareholders (102) and contract enforcement (93).\n\nRanking Brunei Darussalam 58 among 138 economies, the Global \nCompetitiveness Report 2016\u20132017 of the World Economic Forum cited \nnot only the country\u2019s extremely small market but also its bureaucracy \nas signi\ufb01cant hindrances to doing business.

With subdued growth in the \nmajor industrial economies, growth in garment and footwear production \ndecelerated from 9.8% in 2015 to an estimated 7.4% last year. \n\nServices posted 6.7% growth last year, down from the 2015 pace \n\nof 7.1% mainly because growth in wholesale and retail trade was \nlower, possibly indicating moderating growth in private consumption. \nTourist arrivals increased by 5.0% last year, down from 6.1% in 2015 \n(Figure 3.23.2). \n\nExports posted 9.2% growth in 2016, down from 14.1% in 2015 with \n\nslower growth in garment exports, which account for some 70% of \nCambodian exports. Meanwhile, import growth decelerated by half, \nfrom 12.3% in 2015 to 6.1%. As a result, the current account de\ufb01cit \nnarrowed from the equivalent of 11.1% of GDP in 2015 to 10.1% last year. \nThe de\ufb01cit was covered by official transfers and in\ufb02ows of foreign \ndirect investment (FDI). International reserves thus rose to $6.7 billion \nby year-end, or cover for 5.5 months of imports (Figure 3.23.3). \n\nNet FDI rose to an estimated $2.2 billion last year, up by 30.5% \n\nfrom 2015, after declining by 8.1% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2015. These in\ufb02ows \nequaled 10.7% of GDP, with construction and telecommunications \nposting the highest growth rates in 2016, while in\ufb02ows to manufacturing \ndeclined.\n\nBuoyant monetary and credit conditions and a turnaround in \ninternational prices for oil and other commodities drove average \nin\ufb02ation up to 3.0% last year, more than double the previous year\u2019s 1.2%. \nMoney supply grew by 17.9% in 2016, up from 14.7% in 2015 and \n\nlargely in line with expanded foreign currency deposits in banks \n(Figure 3.23.4). Although growth in credit to the private sector \nmoderated from 27.1% at the end of 2015 to 22.5% at the end of last year, \n\nThis chapter was written by Jan Hansen and Samphors Khieu of the Cambodia \nResident Mission, ADB, Phnom Penh.\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3.23.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nTaxes on products less subsidies & FISIM\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.3\n\n7.4\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nFISIM = \ufb01nancial intermediation services indirectly \nmeasured.\nSources: National Institute of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.23.2\u2002Tourism indicators\n\nArrivals\n\nMillion visitors\n\nGrowth\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Ministry of Tourism.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\f228\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\ncredit to construction, real estate, and mortgages edged up slightly \nlast year, from 30.0% to 31.5%. \n\nTo ensure the health of \ufb01nancial institutions, the National Bank \nof Cambodia, the central bank, introduced a minimum 60% liquidity \ncoverage ratio compliant with Basel III starting from 1 September 2016, \nthe minimum rising to 100% by 2020. It also announced that banks \nand micro\ufb01nance institutions would have to comply with much higher \nminimum capital requirements beginning in March 2018. \n\nContinued strengthening of tax administration raised the ratio of \nrevenue to GDP from 16.8% in 2015 to 17.6% last year (Figure 3.23.5). \nWhile current expenditure increased from the equivalent of 12.3% \nof GDP in 2015 to 13.0%, capital spending appears to have slowed \nsigni\ufb01cantly with slower disbursement of external funding for public \ninvestment projects. The \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is therefore estimated to have been \nfar lower than the 4.2% of GDP planned under the Budget Law 2016.\n\nEconomic prospects \nAnnual GDP growth is projected to be slightly higher at 7.1% this \nyear and next (Figure 3.23.6). With growth \ufb01rming up in the major \nindustrial economies this year, Cambodia\u2019s export prospects are robust. \nAgriculture is seen maintaining a similar pace of growth as last year, \nand government spending will likely increase. Industry is projected \nto grow by a slightly higher rate of 10.8% this year, with growth in \ngarment and footwear production picking up. Meanwhile, the pace of \nconstruction is likely to moderate. \n\nServices are expected to expand by 6.7%, as in 2016. The key \n\nchallenge for the tourism industry is to stay competitive as newer \nSoutheast Asian attractions emerge, notably in Myanmar.\n\nThe potential for light manufacturing to relocate out of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China into lower-cost economies in the region \nshould offer Cambodia scope to attract FDI for a variety of pursuits \nbeyond garments and footwear.\n\nHigher international prices for oil and other commodities should \nnudge in\ufb02ation up to 3.4% this year and 3.5% in 2018. As Cambodia is a \nhighly dollarized economy, it must be careful to align minimum wage \nadjustments with productivity increases to keep wage costs in check and \nstay competitive as a manufacturer for export. \n\nthis year, outpacing import growth at 9.0%. Tourism revenues should \nremain strong this year and next. The current account de\ufb01cit is thus \nlikely to narrow to the equivalent of 9.4% of GDP this year and 9.0% \nnext. While official transfers are likely to maintain their declining trend, \nFDI in\ufb02ows look robust in the foreseeable future. Foreign exchange \nreserves are seen to remain comfortable. \n\nThe Budget Law 2017 expects to further improve tax collection, \nwith the ratio of revenue to GDP increasing to 17.4%, compared with \n16.7% in the Budget Law 2016. On the expenditure side, the government \ncontinues to focus on implementing planned increases to civil servants\u2019 \nwages as part of civil service reform. The budget has the wage bill \nincreasing by 20.7% in 2017. Overall public expenditure is expected to \nequal 21.7% of GDP, for a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit of 4.3%. \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n3.23.3\u2002Reserves and import cover\n\nGross international \nreserves\n\nMonths of imports\nof goods\n\n$ billion\n\nNumber of months\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.23.4\u2002 Money supply and  \nprivate sector credit\n\nMoney supply\nPrivate sector credit\n\n% change, year on year \n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nExpenditures\nRevenues\nDe\ufb01cit\n\n% of GDP\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: 2016 refers to the Budget Law 2016 target. \nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nAs export markets \ufb01rm up, exports are expected to expand by 11.0% \n\n3.23.5\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia\u2002\u2002229\n\nThe economic outlook is subject to downside risks, both domestic and \nexternal. Domestic risks stem from vulnerabilities in the \ufb01nancial sector \npartly traceable to its rapid expansion, in particular the proliferation of \nmicro\ufb01nance institutions. On the external front, the risks are weaker \ngrowth in the euro area, a sharper-than-expected global tightening of \ncredit, and a surge in the US dollar, which could constrain exports and \nstiffen competition from other low-cost producers.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reviving agriculture \nAfter growing at an average annual rate of 5.8% from 2003 to 2012, \nagriculture has averaged growth at just under 1.0% since 2013, \neven including last year\u2019s pickup (Figure 3.23.7). Adverse weather may \nexplain part of the recent slowdown, but other problems, deep-seated \nones, plague the sector. Effectively addressing them is increasingly \nbecoming a major priority.\n\nDuring the years of strong agricultural growth before the onset of \nthe recent slowdown, farmland expansion explained 60% of growth, and \nonly 40% came from yield increases. As most arable land is now under \ncultivation, there is very little scope for extending farmland without \nunsustainable deforestation. Future agricultural growth will thus have \nto come largely from productivity gains. Most smallholder farms in \nCambodia have hardly improved their productivity, and agricultural \ncommercialization is still in its infancy. Reviving agriculture requires \na two-pronged effort to improve the productivity of existing crops and \nto diversify agriculture away from low-yielding, low-value crops toward \nmore productive commercial crops. \n\nA World Bank study of Cambodian agriculture in 2015 identi\ufb01ed \nthe key constraints on productivity improvement and diversi\ufb01cation \nto be farmers\u2019 slow adoption of high-quality seeds, low fertilizer \nuse, inadequate irrigation infrastructure, and meager agricultural \nextension services. Policy measures with potential impact in the short to \nmedium term are to reduce the regulatory costs of imported fertilizer, \npromote the safer use of agricultural chemicals, improve farmers\u2019 \naccess to high-quality but affordable seeds, and rehabilitate existing \nirrigation systems.\n\nOver the longer term, developing a domestic agro-processing \nindustry could give a \ufb01llip to agricultural growth by creating demand \nfor high-quality raw materials from agriculture. Meanwhile, the \nIndustrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025 has not been implemented \nat the pace envisioned in the original plans. Speeding its implementation \ncould help a vibrant agro-processing industrial base to emerge in \nCambodia.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n3.23.6\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.23.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n7.1\n\n3.4\n\n\u20139.4\n\n7.1\n\n3.5\n\n\u20139.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.23.7\u2002Agriculture growth\n\nAverage, 2003\u20132012\n\nAverage, 2013\u20132016\n\n2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fIndonesia\n\nRobust  private  consumption  helped  GDP  growth  reach  5.0%  in  2016  even  as  investment  weakened. \nInflation  was  subdued,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed.  Reviving  investment  and  external \ntrade are likely to strengthen growth this year and next, accompanied by higher inflation and a smaller \ncurrent  account  deficit.  In  addition  to  infrastructure  development  and  structural  reform,  addressing \nthe  skills  gap  is  one  important  measure  needed  to  sustain  growth  over  the  medium  to  long  term.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth \ufb01rmed up last year to reach 5.0% from 4.9% in 2015. \nRobust private consumption supported growth even as investment \nslowed (Figure 3.24.1). With the strengthening of consumer con\ufb01dence, \nprivate consumption also grew by 5.0% last year, marking an \nimprovement over the previous year\u2019s 4.8%. \n\nGrowth in \ufb01xed investment slowed by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% \n\nin 2016 despite a series of policy reforms launched by the government. \nInvestment was dampened by delays in implementing public investment \nprojects and weak external demand. As a share of GDP, \ufb01xed investment \nedged down to 32.6% (Figure 3.24.2). \n\nNet external demand remained weak as both exports and \n\nimports continued to shrink in real terms, with imports falling faster \nthan exports.\n\nBy sector, services contributed nearly half of GDP growth in 2016 \n\n(Figure 3.24.3). Led by buoyant banking and \ufb01nance, information \nand telecommunications, and transportation and storage, the sector \nexpanded by 5.6%, up from 5.5% in 2015. However, growth in \nmanufacturing remained subdued at 4.3% in 2016, largely re\ufb02ecting \nstalled recovery in export markets. Still recovering from forest \ufb01res \nand El Ni\u00f1o weather disturbances in 2015, agriculture grew by 3.3% \nlast year, half a percentage point less than in 2015. \n\nRobust growth helped the country to achieve a 3.1% rise in \nemployment. The latest available data show that by August 2016 the \nunemployment rate had improved to 5.6% from 6.2% a year earlier. \nPartly re\ufb02ecting the lower unemployment rate, the number of people \nliving below the national poverty line in September 2016 had fallen by \n1.3 million, reducing poverty to 10.7% from 11.1% a year earlier. \n\nAt 3.5%, average in\ufb02ation last year remained, thanks in part to \nslower growth in fuel prices, near the lower end of the target range of \n3%\u20135% set by Bank Indonesia, the central bank (Figure 3.24.4).

For the year as a whole, the value \nof merchandise exports declined by 3.1% and that of merchandise \nimports by 4.5%, in neither case as steeply as in the previous year. \nThe surplus in merchandise trade thus expanded by 9.6% last year to \nreach $15.4 billion. The higher merchandise trade surplus, coupled \nwith a reduced de\ufb01cit in services trade, narrowed the 2016 current \naccount de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 1.8% of GDP from 2.0% in 2015 \n(Figure 3.24.6).\n\nIncreased net in\ufb02ows of direct investment and portfolio capital \nmore than offset the current account de\ufb01cit last year. Foreign exchange \nreserves thus rose to $116.4 billion at the end of 2016, providing cover \nfor 8.4 months of imports and repayment of official debt (Figure 3.24.7). \nThis comfortable balance-of-payments position caused the Indonesian \nrupiah to appreciate last year by 2.3% against the US dollar, recovering \nsome ground from depreciation in 2015 by more than 10.0%.\nSubdued in\ufb02ation allowed the central bank to pursue an \n\naccommodative monetary policy by lowering the policy interest rate \nby a percentage point from 7.5% to 6.5% between January and June \n2016. Subsequently, with the aim of strengthening the monetary \npolicy transmission mechanism, it adopted in August a shorter-term \n7-day reverse repo rate as its new policy rate, lowering it from 5.25% \nin September to 4.75% in October. The central bank followed up the \npolicy rate cuts with lower rates on its deposit and lending facilities. \nDespite monetary easing, though, growth in credit and the money \nsupply remained muted most of last year. \n\nAt 2.5% of GDP, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit was roughly in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s target of 2.4% for 2016. Fiscal containment was achieved \nby a cut to expenditure as revenues fell short of targets. The 9-month \ntax amnesty introduced in July 2016 to elicit better tax compliance and \nwiden the tax base brought in $10.2 billion last year. Revenue excluding \nincome garnered through the tax amnesty came in 3.7% lower than in \n2015. Due to revenue shortfalls, capital spending declined by 23% and \nsocial spending by 49% from 2015. \n\nCoupled with a favorable balance of payments, \ufb01scal containment \nhelped the country to reduce its external debt burden from 36.1% of GDP \nin 2015 to 34.0% at the end of last year. Fitch and Moody\u2019s upgraded \nIndonesia\u2019s rating outlook from stable to positive, con\ufb01rming the \ncountry as an investment-grade issuer. \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe government unveiled from September 2015 to November 2016 \na series of 14 economic policy packages aiming to boost investment \nand diversify economic activity. The packages were designed to clear \nregulatory bottlenecks and open up new sectors to foreign investors. \nThey have already helped move Indonesia up by several notches in the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2017 report, from 106 in the previous year \nto 91. Encouragingly, 527 companies had responded to the reforms by \nthe end of 2016 with planned investments of $12.9 billion. \n\n3.24.3\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nManufacturing\nOther industry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n \n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 10 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.4\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 16 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.5\u2002Merchandise trade\n\nTrade balance\n\nImport growth\nExport growth\n\n$ billion\n\n%, year on year\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2012\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ3\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ3\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ3\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 10 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n% \n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\f232\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nAlong with these reform packages, the 2017 budget promotes \n\n3.24.6\u2002Current account balance components\n\nSecondary income\nPrimary income\nServices trade\nMerchandise trade\nCurrent account balance\n\nMonetary policy this year and next is likely to depend upon the \n\nGross international reserves\n\nExchange rate\n\n3.24.7\u2002 Gross international reserves \n\nand exchange rate\n\nmacroeconomic stability by continuing \ufb01scal consolidation. It establishes \na \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit target equal to 2.4% of GDP. The 2017 budget sets a \nslightly lower limit on total government expenditure than the revised \n2016 budget but with a higher allocation for infrastructure spending. \nA more realistic revenue mobilization target is another feature \nof this year\u2019s budget. The ratio of revenue to GDP is set at 12.8%, \nmarginally higher than the 12.5% result for 2016. After the successful \nimplementation of the tax amnesty program, the government is \ndeepening its reform of value-added tax, income tax, and stamp duties, \nas well as improving tax administration. An effective implementation \nof the tax amnesty presents an opportunity to kick-start broader \ntax reform. \n\nThe 2017 budget allocates $29.1 billion for infrastructure investment, \n\nup by 22% from the revised 2016 budget, to be spent by line ministries, \nsubnational governments, and state-owned enterprises. Subnational \ngovernments are now required to invest in infrastructure at least 25% \nof the resources they receive from the general allocation fund and \nrevenue sharing. While this policy will be effective only to the extent \nthat subnational governments have adequate implementation capacity, \nit should help to focus \ufb01scal spending on infrastructure. \n\npace at which the US Federal Reserve adjusts its interest rates. Bank \nIndonesia is therefore expected to be more cautious about further easing \nmonetary policy. A banking survey it conducted in the last quarter of \n2016 nevertheless showed that banks expected to increase lending by \n13.1% in 2017, up signi\ufb01cantly from 7.9% growth in 2016.\n\nRecent structural reform and higher budget allocations for \n\ninfrastructure in the 2017 budget should, along with rising income from \ncommodity exports, give a boost to investment this year and next. \nPrivate consumption is also expected to pick up, supported \nby expectations of recovery in international commodity prices. \nConsumption will be further supported by an 8.3% increase in the \nminimum wage and by enterprises\u2019 improved compliance with it. \nA large increase in budget allocations for the Village Fund should \nsupport rural consumption. The central bank\u2019s consumer con\ufb01dence \nindex continued to rise in February 2017 (Figure 3.24.8). \n\nWith the recovery of international prices for Indonesia\u2019s exports \nof copper, coal, nickel, aluminum, crude palm oil, rubber, and coffee, \nexport prospects should improve. Moreover, in January of this year, the \nIndonesian government eased its 2014 ban on ore exports, which was \ndesigned to promote the development of domestic processing industries. \nThis should boost exports of raw minerals, notably nickel ore and \nbauxite. The Nikkei purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing \nshowed an improving trend from late 2015 (Figure 3.24.9).\n\nOn balance, higher public infrastructure spending, a gradual \n\nimprovement in investment and exports, and robust private consumption \nshould help sustain GDP growth at 5.1% in 2017 and 5.3% in 2018. \n\nAs growth improves and international oil and commodity prices \nrecover, average in\ufb02ation is expected to pick up to 4.3% this year and \n4.5% in 2018 (Figure 3.24.10).

The difference should gradually narrow the current \naccount de\ufb01cit this year and next.\n\nDomestic risks to the forecast include possible delayed \n\nimplementation of policy reform and continuing low revenues, which \ncould prompt midyear cuts to government spending. External risks to \nthe outlook include uncertain trade policy in the advanced economies, \nweaker recovery for international commodity prices and economic \ngrowth among trading partners, and accelerated adjustments to interest \nrates internationally. Indonesia is now in a better position to weather \nexternal shocks than in the past, with an improving economic growth, \na narrowing current account de\ufb01cit, a more credible \ufb01scal framework, \nand a better grip on in\ufb02ation.\n\nRecent policy initiatives to increase public investment in \n\ninfrastructure and improve the business environment should help to \nmake Indonesia more competitive and spur new engines of growth. \nThey will need to be complemented, however, by measures to close the \nskills gap that is increasingly a factor constraining the country from \nrealizing its growth potential.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014closing the skills gap\nIndonesia\u2019s workforce has improved its educational attainment in recent \nyears. Still, almost 60% of workers, especially older ones, have not \ncompleted high school (Figure 3.24.11). Since 2002, the government has \ncommitted to education 20% of its budget, or 3.4% of GDP. While this \ninvestment has helped to improve educational attainment, education \nspending still lags behind that of other major economies in the region, \nwith public spending on education in Malaysia and Viet Nam at 6% of \nGDP in recent years. A re\ufb02ection of low educational attainment is that \nhalf of employed people today can be considered underquali\ufb01ed for \ntheir jobs (Figure 3.24.12). \n\nWhile most of Indonesia\u2019s young people aged 15\u201324 years have \nnow completed 9 years of schooling, one in four has not completed \nthe full 12-year cycle before university. Moreover, the quality of \neducation is a matter of continuing concern. Results from the \nProgram for International Student Assessment of the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development indicate that, although \nIndonesia\u2019s performance has improved over time, on average Indonesia\u2019s \n15-year-olds underperform their peers in other middle-income countries \nin Southeast Asia. For example, in the 2015 tests, Thailand and \nViet Nam outscored Indonesia in all three subjects covered: science, \nmathematics, and reading. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum\u2019s \nExecutive Opinion Survey identi\ufb01es a mismatch between the skills that \ngraduates possess and those that employers require. These observations \nunderscore the need to close the skills gap and strengthen Indonesia\u2019s \nhuman capital. \n\n3.24.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n5.1\n\n4.3\n\n\u20131.7\n\n5.3\n\n4.5\n\n\u20131.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.24.9\u2002 Manufacturing purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 index\n\nExpansion\n\nIndex\n\n54\n\n52\n\n50\n\n48\n\n46\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 17 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.10\u2002Inflation\n\n% \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fThe skills gap can be addressed in part through workplace training. \n\n3.24.11\u2002 Educational attainment  \n\n234\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nHowever, at present Indonesian employers and workers invest little in \nskills development. Only a small percentage of workers continue training \nonce they \ufb01nd employment. Data from Statistics Indonesia highlight \nthat less than 10% of the working age population has undergone \ncerti\ufb01ed workplace training. Similarly, the World Bank\u2019s enterprise \nsurvey indicates that only 7.7% of \ufb01rms offer formal training, one of \nthe lowest rates among the countries surveyed. One reason that private \nenterprises limit their investment in human capital is labor regulation \nthat encourages hiring people on short-term contracts.\n\nClosing the country\u2019s skills gap requires a comprehensive program of \n\neducation and training reform. It should focus on making spending on \npublic education more efficient and developing strategies for mobilizing \npublic and private resources for education and training. Education \nspending should aim not only to upgrade school infrastructure and \ntraining equipment but also raise the quality of instruction in schools \nby training teachers and improving the curriculum. \n\nThe reform program should facilitate much greater engagement \nby the government, employers, and education and training providers \nto ensure that graduates can meet the demands of a labor market \nin a middle-income country. Industry associations need to play a \nstronger role by developing good collaboration models that can evolve \ninto industrywide skills-development programs, with cost-sharing \ninitiatives to support more and better skills training. Particular focus \nshould be placed on technical and vocational education and training. \nKey ingredients for success include more autonomy for providers of \neducation and training to enable them to respond to industry needs, \nequipping the institutions with adequate \ufb01nancial and technical \nresources, and strengthening the industry quali\ufb01cation framework and \nthe accreditation system. \n\nPolicy actions that address the reasons why private \ufb01rms prefer \nto hire workers on short-term contracts, such as high severance pay, \nshould encourage them to hire workers longer term. With improvements \nto the regulatory environment and strengthened collaboration for \ndemand-based skills development, the private sector should be willing \nto shoulder greater responsibility for enabling their workers to receive \nhigh-quality training and to acquire newer skills for a fast-modernizing \neconomy. A better safety net would protect unemployed workers as they \nupgrade their skills toward \ufb01nding another job.\n\nin the labor force by age group\n\nPost secondary\nSenior high school\nJunior high school and below\n\n13.7%\n\n42.8%\n\n43.5%\n\n13.7%\n\n29.4%\n\n56.9%\n\n9.3%\n16.3%\n\n74.4%\n\n15\u201329 years\n\n30\u201344 years\n\n45+ years\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 10 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.24.12\u2002 Mismatch in occupational skills \n\nand education, 2016\n\nPercentage of the employed population\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nUnder quali\ufb01ed Well matched Over quali\ufb01ed\n\nSource: Statistics Indonesia.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nDriven  by  solid  expansion  in  electricity  production  for  export  and  a  buoyant  service  sector, \ngrowth  held  up  well  at  6.8%  last  year.  Work  on  a  major  cross-border  railway  project  should  help \nstrengthen  growth  this  year  and  next.  Both  inflation  and  the  current  account  deficit  look  set  to \nrise.  Major  policy  changes  are  needed  to  promote  labor-intensive  manufacturing  and  make  the \nbenefits  of  growth  more  inclusive.\n\nEconomic performance \nWeathering a rough external environment, including lower commodity \nprices, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) managed \nto maintain strong GDP growth at 6.8% last year, similar to the rate \nrecorded in 2015 (Figure 3.25.1). \n\nThe service sector, which provides 43.0% of GDP, posted \n\nstronger growth at 9.0%, up from the 2015 \ufb01gure of 8.5%. Despite a \ndecline in tourist arrivals, most major service subsectors\u2014wholesale \nand retail trade, hotels and restaurants, \ufb01nancial services, and \ntelecommunications\u2014recorded strong growth. Partly because the \ngovernment changed its de\ufb01nition of \u201ctourist,\u201d the number of tourist \narrivals declined by 9.5%, but revenue from tourism declined only \nmarginally (Figure 3.25.2). \n\nIndustry, which occupies 32.4% of the economy, maintained sturdy \n\n8.0% growth last year, even as mining output declined. Electricity \ngeneration and exports, mostly to Thailand, received a signi\ufb01cant boost \nas sales from the Hongsa lignite-\ufb01red electric power plant rose, as did \nsales from new power plants. However, low international metal prices \ndrove down output from mining by 1.0% for copper, 1.9% for gold, and \n1.7% for silver.\n\nDespite drought early in the year, growth in agriculture picked up \nfrom 2.0% in 2015 to 2.5% in 2016 thanks to improved weather in the \nlatter part. While rice production rose only marginally, livestock and \n\ufb01shery production grew by 4.2%. \n\nRe\ufb02ecting low international oil and commodity prices, in\ufb02ation \nremained subdued at an annual rate of 1.6% last year, only marginally \nhigher than the 2015 \ufb01gure of 1.3% (Figure 3.25.3). \n\nGrowth in merchandise imports contracted further from 5.8% \n\nin 2015 to an estimated 6.7% in 2016. Meanwhile, merchandise \nexports grew by 12.3% in 2016, compared with a 12.9% decline in \nthe previous year. The current account de\ufb01cit thus shrank from the \nequivalent of 16.8% of GDP in 2015 to 14.1% last year. Foreign reserves \nremained precarious at $814 million at the end of December, or cover for \nonly 1.4 months of imports.\n\nThis chapter was written by Rattanatay Luanglatbandith and Soulinthone Leuangkhamsing \nof the Lao PDR Resident Mission, ADB, Vientiane.\n\n3.25.1\u2002Supply-side contributions to growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n7.9\n\n7.9\n\n7.4\n\n6.7\n\n6.8\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: Lao Statistics Bureau; Asian Development Outlook \ndatabase.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.2\u2002Tourism indicators\n\nRevenue from tourism \n\nNumber of tourists\n\n$ billion\n\n% change, year on year\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\n\u2013300\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: National Tourism Administration.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f236\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nA \ufb01scal consolidation program that started in 2014 ran into problems \n\n3.25.3\u2002Monthly inflation\n\n%, year on year\n\nlast year as public expenditure outstripped budgeted amounts and \nrevenues fell short of targets because of low metal prices, inefficient \ntax collection, and failure to collect huge tax arrears. As a result, the \n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cit for the year widened to equal nearly 6% of GDP, more than \n1 percentage point higher than in 2015. \n\nAs for monetary policy, the Bank of the Lao PDR, the central bank, \nimposed in mid-2015 caps on deposit and lending rates for the Lao kip. \nThis encouraged faster growth in credit, up from 16.8% in 2015 to 21.0% \nin 2016 (Figure 3.25.4). Broad money was estimated to have grown by \nabout 11.0%. The kip remained stable against both the US dollar and the \nThai baht.\n\nEconomic prospects\nAs recovery \ufb01rms up in the major industrial economies and \ninternational commodity prices move higher, economic growth in the \nLao PDR should edge up to 6.9% this year and 7.0% next (Figure 3.25.5). \nRevenue from metal exports is expected to improve somewhat, \n\nwhile agricultural production\u2014especially rice, cash crops, and \nlivestock\u2014should strengthen further as the rehabilitation of many old \nirrigation systems and the commissioning of newly completed irrigation \nschemes enable more dry-season cropping.\n\nConstruction began on 25 December 2016 on a railway linking the \ncapital, Vientiane, to Yunnan Province in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nThis $6.8 billion project should give a boost to domestic industry. \nAs work on the project progresses, it could spur complementary \ninvestments. Industry stands to bene\ufb01t as well from other commitments \nof foreign direct investment to build power plants and commercial and \nindustrial estates. \n\nService should stay buoyant this year and next. Although the \ngovernment target of attracting 5 million tourists this year looks \ndifficult to achieve, revenues from tourism are likely to remain strong. \nThe composition of tourist arrivals is undergoing a promising change \naway from short-stay, low-spending tourists from neighboring countries \ntoward longer-staying and higher-spending tourists from Japan, \nthe Republic of Korea, and Taipei,China within the region and from \nWestern Europe and North America. \n\nWith domestic economic activity getting a boost and international \noil prices higher, the in\ufb02ation rate is likely to rise gradually to 2.5% in \n2017 and 3.0% in 2018.\n\nAs growth strengthens and in\ufb02ation edges up, imports will grow \nfaster than exports. Imports of machinery, equipment, and materials \nneeded for the railway project, hydropower projects, and other foreign \ndirect investments are particularly likely candidates for sharp increases. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit is thus forecast to widen to 19.0% this year \nand 20.0% in 2018 (Figure 3.25.6). Meager foreign exchange reserves are \ntherefore unlikely to see much improvement soon. \n\nThe Lao PDR urgently needs to resume \ufb01scal consolidation. \n\nRecognizing this, the government plans to cut its \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to under \n5% this year and next, leaving little scope for \ufb01scal stimulus to support \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nJan\n2012\n\nJan\n2013\n\nJan\n2014\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nDec\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 8 March 2016).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.4\u2002Monetary indicators \n\nDomestic credit growth\nMoney supply growth\n\nDomestic credit\n\n% change, year on year \n\nKN trillion\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Bank of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.25.5\u2002GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2002\u2002237\n\ngrowth in the near term.

Rapid growth enabled the \ncountry to meet its target under the Millennium Development Goals to \nhalve extreme poverty by 2015. However, the rate of poverty reduction \nhas not been commensurate with the strength of economic growth. \nTo illustrate, from 2003 to 2012, every percentage point of GDP growth \nwas matched on average by an unimpressive 0.47% decline in the \npoverty rate. This response is one of the smallest in Southeast Asia. \nSimilar conclusions emerge if analysis uses international poverty lines to \nestimate poverty rates instead of the national poverty line used here. \nThe muted effect of economic growth on poverty in the Lao PDR \nis primarily the result of a growth pattern that relies heavily on highly \ncapital-intensive sectors such as hydropower and mining, rather than \non labor-intensive manufacturing. Mining and hydropower investments \ncreate enclaves of growth and prosperity with limited links to the \nrest of the economy. Even when such enclave industries grow rapidly, \nthey create far fewer jobs than do new businesses that manufacture \nsuch labor-intensive products as garments, footwear, and consumer \nelectronics. This isolation stymies poverty reduction even when GDP \ngrowth is strong. The key to making growth more inclusive in the \nfuture is therefore to shift the sources of growth away from extractive \nindustries toward more labor-intensive manufacturing. \n\ntransformation: liberalizing the business environment and improving \nthe skills of young workers. The Lao PDR is ranked 139 among 190 \neconomies surveyed for the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2017, behind \nevery other member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nexcept Myanmar (Figure 3.25.7). The country ranks poorly particularly \nin terms of procedures and processes for starting a business, getting an \nelectricity connection, protecting minority shareholders, and resolving \ninsolvency. Lack of access to \ufb01nance is another factor that constrains \nin particular small and medium-sized enterprises in labor-intensive \nmanufacturing. \n\nThere is thus huge scope for policy reform in these areas to attract \n\ninvestment, both domestic and foreign, in labor-intensive industries. \nMoreover, as the country also faces a skills gap that will constrain, \nsooner rather than later, the rise of a modern manufacturing sector, \nhigher investment in education and training has to follow liberalization \nin the business environment. \n\n3.25.6\u2002Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nof ASEAN members\n\nSingapore\n\n2 \n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\n23 \n\n46 \n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nViet Nam\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\nCambodia\n\nLao PDR\n\nMyanmar\n\n72 \n\n82\n\n91 \n\n99 \n\n131 \n\n139 \n\n170\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nRank, 1 = best\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations,  \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nSource: World Bank. 2016.

Recovery  will  be  accompanied  by  higher  inflation  at  3.3% \nand  a  smaller  current  account  surplus.  Sustaining  growth  as  income  rises  will  require  higher \nproductivity,  which  can  be  achieved  through  a  major  effort  to  strengthen  innovation.\n\nEconomic performance \nA diversi\ufb01ed economic base and a \ufb02exible exchange rate helped to \ncushion the economy from a slump in global oil and commodity markets \nover the past 2 years. Still, economic growth slowed further to 4.2% \nin 2016, weighed down by decelerating \ufb01xed investment, weaker \ngovernment spending, and a fall in net exports of goods and services \n(Figure 3.26.1). As growth slowed, the unemployment rate edged up to \n3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 3.2% a year earlier. \n\nAnnual growth in private consumption, which averaged 7.2% during \n\n2010\u20132014, has decelerated over the past 2 years. In 2016, it grew by \na still robust 6.1% and made the largest demand-side contribution to \nGDP growth. Support for household spending came from increases in \npublic sector salaries, a higher minimum wage, and government cash \ntransfers. \n\nGrowth in government consumption spending last year braked \nsharply to 1.0%, and \ufb01xed investment by the government contracted for \na third consecutive year, re\ufb02ecting efforts to rein in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit. \nPrivate \ufb01xed investment grew by 4.4%, decelerating for a fourth year \nin a row as the outlook weakened for both domestic and external \ndemand (Figure 3.26.2). Net external demand dragged on GDP growth \nas imports of goods and services rose in real terms by 0.4%, while real \nexports rose by 0.1%.\n\nBy sector, services grew by 5.6%, contributing the bulk of the \n\nincrease in GDP last year. Wholesale and retail trade, food and \naccommodation, and information and communications recorded robust \ngrowth, re\ufb02ecting in part expansion in consumer spending and tourism. \nConstruction grew by 7.4%, slowing from more vigorous expansion \nin 2015. Growth in mining slackened to 2.7% as oil production \ufb02attened, \nthough output in natural gas rose. Weaker demand for automobiles and \na fall in palm oil processing suppressed growth in manufacturing to \n4.4%, down from 4.9% in 2015.

In the process, the current account surplus shrank \nto the equivalent of 2.0% of GDP. Smaller net out\ufb02ow in the capital \nand \ufb01nancial accounts enabled the overall balance of payments to post \na surplus equal to 1.2% of GDP (Figure 3.26.4). Gross international \nreserves stood at $95 billion in February 2017, sufficient to cover \n8.5 months of imports excluding imports for re-export. Viewed another \nway, reserves exceed the country\u2019s short-term external debt. \n\nLast year, the Malaysian ringgit depreciated by 4.3% against the \nUS dollar, after weakening by 19.1% in 2015, mainly on subdued exports \nand capital out\ufb02ows. In December 2016, Bank Negara Malaysia, the \ncentral bank, required exporters to convert at least 75% of their export \nproceeds into ringgit, a move that helped to support the exchange rate \nand foreign reserves.\n\nSagging economic growth and subdued in\ufb02ation prompted the \n\ncentral bank to ease monetary policy. After lowering the reserve \nratio for banks from 4.0% to 3.5% in January 2016, it cut its policy \ninterest rate by 25 basis points to 3.0% in July. Growth in bank credit \nnevertheless slowed from 7.7% in 2015 to 5.3% last year. \n\nFiscal consolidation remained on track. Revenue from a goods \nand services tax introduced in April 2015 went some way toward \noffsetting lower income from oil and gas, though total government \nrevenue still declined by 3.0%. The government reduced expenditure \nby 2.0%, narrowing the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to 3.1% of GDP from 3.2% in 2015 \n(Figure 3.26.5).\n\nEconomic prospects \nGDP growth is forecast to pick up this year and next but to remain \nwell below the 5.3% average rate the country achieved in 2011\u20132015. \nFirmer growth in the major industrial economies and a mild recovery in \ndomestic investment are likely to lift GDP growth to 4.4% this year and \n4.6% in 2018 (Figure 3.26.6). \n\nThe outlook for private \ufb01xed investment is improving somewhat \n\nwith higher prices for hydrocarbons, recovery in agriculture, and \nbetter prospects for semiconductors. However, concern over possible \nglobal trade disruption and the impact of the normalization of US \nmonetary policy on capital \ufb02ows to developing countries is likely to \nrestrain recovery in investment. A pipeline of large infrastructure \nprojects\u2014such as the Pan Borneo Highway, the Pengerang re\ufb01nery and \npetrochemical plant, mass rapid transport projects in Kuala Lumpur, \nand the East Coast rail link and high-speed rail line to Singapore\u2014\nshould stimulate both public and private investment. As for net external \ndemand, its drag on GDP growth is forecast to diminish this year unless \nglobal trade is seriously disrupted.\n\nPrivate consumption is expected to grow this year at around \n\nlast year\u2019s pace. Rising wages are seen to underpin household spending, \nas are government measures to bolster incomes, including tax breaks, \nhigher cash transfers to lower-income groups, and a reduction in \nmandatory employee contributions to the national retirement fund. \n\nOverall\nFood \nNonfood\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201330\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSources: Haver Analytics; Bank Negara Malaysia. 2017. \nMonthly Statistical Bulletin.

In a positive sign for \nindustry, the purchasing managers\u2019 index indicated in February 2017 \nthat the slowdown in manufacturing might be ending. Manufacturers \nreported that month that they raised production for the \ufb01rst time in \nalmost 2 years (Figure 3.26.8). Demand for semiconductors will get a lift \nfrom an increase in book-to-bill ratios in North America and Japan and \nthe launch of new mobile phone models. \n\nAgriculture is forecast to recover this year, assuming the weather \nimproves. Also, natural gas production is projected to rise, but oil output \nwill likely decline as oil \ufb01elds age and because of an international \nagreement by oil producers to temporarily trim output. Work on \npublic infrastructure and affordable housing should give a helping hand \nto construction.\n\nHigher fuel prices, cuts to subsidies, and a weaker ringgit are \nexpected to push prices up. In\ufb02ation is forecast to rise to 3.3% in 2017 \nand then subside to 2.7% with the fading of the base effect from lower \nprices last year (Figure 3.26.9). In\ufb02ation averaged 3.9% year on year in \nthe \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017. In March 2017, the central bank projected \nthat higher global commodity and energy prices, and the impact of \nringgit depreciation, would lift in\ufb02ation to 3%\u20134% in 2017. The central \nbank added, however, that it did not expect these in\ufb02ationary factors \nto have signi\ufb01cant spillover into broader price trends, and that core \nin\ufb02ation should increase only modestly. \n\nMerchandise exports started 2017 on a better note, rising in January \n\nby 10.7% in US dollar terms from January 2016. All major export \ncategories\u2014manufactures, oil and lique\ufb01ed natural gas, and agricultural \nproducts\u2014showed improvement. Imports also rebounded in January, \nby 13.2%, on higher purchases of capital and intermediate goods. \nGrowth in imports is expected to outstrip that of exports this year, \nnarrowing the current account surplus to the equivalent of 1.8% of GDP, \nbefore the surplus edges up to 2.0% in 2018 as export growth quickens.\n\nWith in\ufb02ation picking up and the current account surplus narrowing \nbut still positive, the central bank could keep monetary policy steady for \nsome time, though policy will be contingent on changes in US monetary \npolicy and other external developments. Fiscal policy is expected to \nsupport economic growth. The government aims to narrow the \ufb01scal \nde\ufb01cit to 3.0% of GDP in 2017 but has budgeted to increase operating \nexpenditure for the \ufb01rst time in 3 years and has also raised net \ndevelopment spending. \n\nA signi\ufb01cant risk to the outlook is potential disruption to global \n\ntrade because Malaysia is closely integrated into the world economy. \nThe main export markets are, in descending order, Singapore, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the US, the European Union, and \nJapan. Sudden tariff hikes by major partners would hamper the modest \nstrengthening now forecast for this trade-dependent economy.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n3.26.6\u2002Annual GDP growth\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.26.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n4.4\n\n3.3\n\n1.8\n\n4.6\n\n2.7\n\n2.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.26.7\u2002 Consumer and business confidence \n\nindexes\n\nConsumer sentiment\nBusiness conditions\n\nIndex, 2005 = 100\n\nQ1\n2012\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nNote: Above 100 indicates improvement in business \nconditions and rising consumer con\ufb01dence.\nSources: Malaysian Institute of Economic Research.  \nhttps://www.mier.org.my; Haver Analytics \n(accessed 22 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMalaysia\u2002\u2002241\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014fostering innovation\nAs Malaysia\u2019s income rises, growth will have to come increasingly \nfrom sustained gains in labor productivity through a renewed focus on \ninnovation. Recognizing this imperative, the government has set a target \nof nearly doubling annual labor productivity growth to 3.7% during \n2016\u20132020, up from the 2.0% pace in 2011\u20132015. Building on this plan, \nthe government is expected to unveil a productivity blueprint in the \nsecond half of 2017.\n\nMalaysia ranked 35 among 128 countries on the Global Innovation \n\nIndex 2016, ahead of many regional peers though slipping by three \nplaces in the ranking from 2015. The innovation index is an average \nof two subindexes, one on innovation inputs that captures a country\u2019s \ninstitutions, human capital, infrastructure, market, and business \nsophistication, and another on innovation outputs that factors in \nknowledge and technology outputs and creative outcomes. As such, it is \na proxy for the innovation potential of a country. How effectively that \npotential is realized is given for each country by the ratio of the output \nsubindex to the input subindex, yielding the innovation efficiency score.\nAlthough Malaysia outperforms many of its regional peers in terms \nof the composite innovation index, its innovation efficiency score is less \nimpressive, ranking it at 59, behind such regional peers as the PRC, the \nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam (Figure 3.26.10). The innovation \nindex and the efficiency score may be only rough indicators, but they \npoint to huge scope for making more of the country\u2019s high innovation \npotential. A 2016 survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development highlighted that innovation in Malaysia is critically \nhampered by a lack of coordination across government agencies. \nInterestingly, World Bank enterprise surveys have found that \nMalaysian \ufb01rms tend to focus on innovation that involves commercial \nand organizational issues such as improved distribution and marketing. \nOnly 17% invest in developing new technologies. This compares \nunfavorably with 27% of companies in Southeast Asia as a whole, \nsuggesting a need for Malaysian \ufb01rms to invest more in research and \ndevelopment and for greater effort to encourage technology transfer \nfrom multinationals to domestic enterprises.\n\nThe World Bank enterprise surveys also found that fewer Malaysian \n\n\ufb01rms train their workers than do \ufb01rms in other countries. Only 19% \nof \ufb01rms in Malaysia provide formal worker training, slightly less than \nthe average for members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) and far below the rate in high-income economies or the PRC. \nSuch \ufb01rm-level training gaps are particularly wide in manufacturing, \nwhere training programs are offered to only 44% of their workers, \ncompared with 85% in the PRC and 60% in other ASEAN countries. \nWithin the country\u2019s manufacturing industry, small \ufb01rms offer much \nless formal training than do medium-sized and large \ufb01rms.\n\nHow to use the country\u2019s innovation capability much more efficiently \nis therefore a key issue that policy makers need to address in their quest \nto foster innovation and boost productivity.\n\n3.26.8\u2002 Manufacturing purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 index\n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\nExpansion\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nNote: Nikkei, Markit.\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 22 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.26.9\u2002 Annual inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.26.10\u2002 Global innovation index and \n\ninnovation efficiency ratio\n\nGlobal innovation\nindex\n\nInnovation\nefficiency ratio\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nRank\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nPRC MAL THA VIE\n\nIND PHI\n\nINO\n\nIND = India, INO = Indonesia, MAL = Malaysia, \nPHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, \nTHA = Thailand, VIE = Viet Nam.\nNotes: Rank 1 = best, Ratio >1 = higher efficiency.\nSource: Based on ranking from S.

Inflation  eased,  but  the \ncurrent account deficit worsened. With recovery firming in the major industrial economies, growth \nshould  accelerate  this  year  and  next,  inflation  edge  up,  and  the  current  account  deficit  widen. \nConsolidating  the  country\u2019s  legal  and  regulatory  framework  is  crucial  to  develop  a  vibrant  private \nsector  and  tap  Myanmar\u2019s  huge  growth  potential. \n\nEconomic performance \nAn already slowing economy decelerated further because of a weak \nexternal environment, unfavorable weather, and uncertainty about \nthe direction economic policy will take under the newly elected \ngovernment. GDP growth in FY2016 (ended 31 March 2017) came in at \nan estimated 6.4%, down from 7.3% in the previous year (Figure 3.27.1). \nMost major sectors recorded slower growth last year. Held back by a \nslow recovery from \ufb02oods in 2015 and subdued international commodity \nprices, growth in agriculture decelerated from 3.4% in FY2015 to an \nestimated 2.5% last year. Growth in industrial output slowed from 8.7% \nin FY2015 to 8.2%. Within industry, energy production suffered the \nmost, dragged down largely by low international prices for oil and gas. \nGrowth decelerated in services more than in other sectors, from 9.1% in \nFY2015 to an estimated 7.6% last year. \n\nReliable data on the demand-side components of GDP are not \navailable, but investment seems to have slowed while consumption \nwas more resilient. As private investors adopt a wait-and-see approach, \napprovals of foreign direct investment declined by 28% in the \ufb01rst 9 \nmonths of FY2016 (Figure 3.27.2).\n\nA February 2017 report from the International Monetary Fund \nindicates that the value of merchandise exports hardly grew in FY2016 \nafter declining by more than 10.0% in the previous year. Meanwhile, \nmerchandise imports seem to have risen by more than 7.0% in FY2016 \nafter being \ufb02at in FY2015. The current account de\ufb01cit is thus estimated \nto have widened to the equivalent of 7.0% of GDP from 5.2% in FY2015 \n(Figure 3.27.3). The worsening current account de\ufb01cit put pressure on \nthe Myanmar kyat, which has depreciated by 17.0% against the US dollar \nin the \ufb01rst nine months of FY2016. \n\nIn\ufb02ation eased on subdued demand and slowing growth\u2014and \ndespite higher international prices for oil and other commodities, \nas well as kyat depreciation. It fell from a peak of 16.2% in October 2015 \nto less than 4.0% in October 2016. Average in\ufb02ation declined to an \nestimated 6.5% from 11.2% in FY2015 (Figure 3.27.4). \n\nThis chapter was written by Yumiko Tamura, Thi Da Myint, and Yan P.

Available data \nindicate that credit growth continued to be strong in FY2016. The bulk \nof credit expansion went to \ufb01nance the government\u2019s \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit, \nas government borrowing from the central bank without limit has been \na common practice. \n\nThe International Monetary Fund report gave the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \n\nin FY2016 as the equivalent of 4.6% of GDP, up from 4.1% in the \nprevious year. The ratio of government revenue to GDP continued a \ndeclining trend seen since FY2014 and is estimated to have been 17.2% \nin FY2016.

Its new investment law, effective at the beginning \nof April 2017, should attract more foreign investment if implemented \neffectively. Following recent years beset by droughts and \ufb02oods, a return \nto normal weather would further boost agriculture, which provides \nnearly 30% of the GDP. \n\nEconomic performance should improve, with GDP growth at 7.7% \n\nin FY2017 and 8.0% in FY2018 (Figure 3.27.5). With normal weather \nand higher international commodity prices, agriculture should sustain \na growth rate of around 3% this year and next. Industry and services \nare both likely to grow more strongly. Newly emerging demand for \ntelecommunications should give a further \ufb01llip to the service sector. \nIndustrial output is forecast to grow at an annual rate of around 10.0% \nthis year and next. Growth in services is forecast to come in at a sturdy \n9.0% in FY2017 and 10.0% the following year. \n\nExports are forecast to increase at an annual pace of 7.0% this \nyear and next. With domestic demand gaining strength and foreign \ndirect investment in\ufb02ows responding to the implementation of the new \ninvestment law, growth in imports will outpace that in exports. As a \nresult, the trade and current account de\ufb01cits are both likely to worsen \nthis year and next (Figure 3.27.6). Higher in\ufb02ows of foreign direct \ninvestment are seen to help \ufb01nance the widening current account de\ufb01cit. \n\nAs growth strengthens, in\ufb02ation is likely to edge up by half \na percentage point this year and next, reaching 7.5% in FY2018 \n(Figure 3.27.7). The Central Bank of Myanmar is thus likely to face \nthe challenging task of restraining money supply and credit to contain \nin\ufb02ation. Encouragingly, the government has recently adopted a cap \non its borrowings from the central bank, limited to not more than 40% \nof its total \ufb01nancing needs. Government loans will have market-based \ninterest rates rather than at a \ufb02at rate of 4%, as has been past practice. \nThis should signi\ufb01cantly reduce pressure on the central bank to extend \ncredit to the government, enabling it to better manage monetary \nconditions. Moreover, the government plans to contain the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nto 3%\u20134% of GDP this year and next by strengthening revenue collection \nand enhancing expenditure efficiency.\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nEstimate\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.27.4\u2002Inflation\n\n2006 = 100\n2012 = 100\n\n%\n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJan\n2015\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nMay Aug\n\nDec\n\nFeb\n2016\n\nSource: Central Statistical Organization.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.27.5\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 March of the next year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f244\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nExternal risks to the outlook could arise from unexpectedly \nweak global recovery or volatility in international \ufb01nancial markets. \nDomestic risks include unclear and inconsistent policy directions, \nexcessive credit growth, delays in implementing reform initiatives, and \ndisruptions to social stability. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014developing the private sector \nthrough sound laws and regulations\nA rapid transition to a market-oriented economy crucially requires the \ndevelopment of a sound legal and regulatory framework conducive to the \nprivate sector playing a lead role in the economy. It is encouraging that \nsince 2011 a number of existing laws have been amended and new laws \nadopted to this end. More recently, two laws passed in 2012 and 2013, \none for domestic investors and another for foreign investors, were \nmerged into the uni\ufb01ed Investment Law, slated to come into effect in \nApril 2017. A new company law is expected to be passed in 2017 toward \nimproving the operating and governance framework for both domestic \nand foreign investors.\n\nThese efforts constitute a good beginning, but Myanmar still \nlacks a credible and consolidated legal and regulatory framework to \nsupport the emergence of a vibrant private sector. Multiple layers \nof laws, regulations, and procedures often hinder investment and \nprivate business, as does their inconsistent implementation. \n\nbusiness are needed to reform how laws are made, how they are \ntranslated in administrative rules and regulations, and how the rules \nand regulations are implemented. Laws and regulations need to be \nprepared with proper consultation both within the government and \nwith other stakeholders including businesspeople. The process should \nensure that the whole of government, not just one ministry alone, is \ninvolved. Rules and regulations should be fully consistent with the laws \nfrom which they are derived and easy to comply with because they \nsatisfy the needs of business. To this end, ministries and government \nagencies need to deepen their understanding of modern business \npractice. The effective implementation and uniform enforcement of laws \nand regulations is as important as their formulation and enactment.\n\n3.27.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n7.7\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n7.5\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u20138.0\n\n\u20138.0\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 31 March of \nthat\u00a0year.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.27.6\u2002Current account balance\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 March of the next year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201310\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 March of the next year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nMajor changes to the legal and regulatory framework for private \n\n3.27.7\u2002Inflation\n\n\fPhilippines\n\nBuoyant  domestic  demand  drove  economic  growth  up  to  6.8%  in  2016.  Growth  will  moderate \nsomewhat  but  still  be  strong  at  6.4%  this  year  and  6.6%  next.  Inflation  is  forecast  to  pick  up, \nand  the  current  account  will  continue  to  post  a  small  surplus.  Making  growth  more  inclusive  will \nrequire  the  effective  implementation  of  the  country\u2019s  development  plan  for  2017\u20132022. \n\nEconomic performance \nGDP growth accelerated from 5.9% in 2015 to 6.8% last year \nnotwithstanding weak external demand and a reduction in agricultural \nproduction largely caused by drought. Broad-based strength in domestic \ndemand underpinned last year\u2019s healthy growth rate, which was lifted \nas well by election spending. \n\nInvestment, both public and private, made the biggest contribution \nto growth, followed by private consumption (Figure 3.28.1). Spurred by \nhigher outlays for durable equipment and construction (Figure 3.28.2), \nthe ratio of \ufb01xed investment to GDP reached 23.8% in 2016, its highest \nin over a decade, though still behind the ratio in other Southeast Asian \neconomies (Figure 3.28.3).\n\nPrivate consumption, providing nearly 70% of GDP, grew by 6.9% \n\nlast year, up from a 6.3% rise in 2015. Consumer spending bene\ufb01ted \nfrom higher employment and steady in\ufb02ows of remittances from \nworkers overseas. The unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in 2016, \nwhile remittances from overseas rose by 4.9% to reach $29.7 billion. \nConsumption got further impetus from an 8.3% rise in public spending \non social programs including basic education, national health insurance \nand immunization, and conditional cash transfers to 4.4 million poor \nfamilies, which were contingent on recipients acting to meet certain \ncriteria. A salary increase for government staff further drove up public \nconsumption. \n\nBy sector, services and industry were the key growth drivers. \n\nServices\u2014the largest sector, providing over half of GDP and \nemployment\u2014expanded by 7.5% and generated nearly two-thirds of GDP \ngrowth last year (Figure 3.28.4). Subsectors posting strong growth were \nretail trade, business process outsourcing (BPO), tourism, real estate, \nand \ufb01nancial services.\n\nIndustry turned in a sturdy 8.0% growth last year, improving on \n\n6.0% growth in 2015. Manufacturing, comprising two-thirds of the \nindustry sector, accelerated its growth rate from 5.7% in 2015 to 7.0% \nlast year. Bene\ufb01ting from strong domestic demand, food processing, \nwhich constitutes a third of manufacturing, posted robust output gains. \n\nThis chapter was written by Aekapol Chongvilaivan and Teresa Mendoza of the Philippines \nCountry Office, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.28.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nFixed investment\nChange in inventories\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.7\n\n7.1\n\n5.9\n\n6.2\n\n6.8\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (downloaded 10 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.28.2\u2002 Contributions to  \n\nfixed investment growth\n\nConstruction\nDurable equipment\nOthers\n\nPercentage points\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (downloaded 10 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f246\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nA number of other industries such as chemicals, rubber products, \nmachinery, and transportation equipment also performed well. \nConstruction, both public and private, also contributed signi\ufb01cantly \nto industry growth. Indeed, public construction expanded by 29.0% in \n2016, outpacing already impressive growth of 19.0% in 2015. \n\nDrought caused by El Ni\u00f1o, the periodic weather disturbance, cut \nagricultural output by 1.3% during the year, although there was a slight \nrecovery in the second half. Agriculture\u2019s share in GDP has shrunk \nto 10%, though the sector still employs nearly 30% of working Filipinos. \nNotwithstanding buoyant domestic demand, in\ufb02ation remained \nmodest, averaging 1.8% last year. This was marginally higher than the \nprevious year\u2019s rate of 1.4% but was still lower than the target range of \n2%\u20134% set by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank. Subdued \nglobal oil prices kept the lid on in\ufb02ation, and timely imports of rice \naugmented domestic supplies and kept food prices low.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of benign in\ufb02ation, monetary policy remained \naccommodative. The central bank kept the overnight reverse repurchase \nrate unchanged at 3.0%. Monetary and credit conditions thus continued \nto support growth, with the money supply (M3) rising by 12.7% in \n2016, up from 9.4% in 2015. Demand for credit from the private sector \nremained the key driver of liquidity growth. \n\nAccelerated public spending, particularly on infrastructure, widened \n\nthe \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP in 2016 from 0.9% \nin 2015. Expenditure excluding interest payments rose by 16.8%. \nNearly half of the increase in public spending was for infrastructure. \nTax collection rose by 9.1% and provided 90% of revenues. The ratio of \ngovernment debt to GDP declined to 42.1% in 2016, the lowest in over a \ndecade, enabling higher spending. Debt in local currency accounted for \nabout two-thirds of the total.\n\nWeak external demand trimmed the current account surplus from \nthe equivalent of 2.5% of GDP in 2015 to 0.2% last year (Figure 3.28.5). \nAs imports rose rapidly and exports increased only marginally, the \nmerchandise trade de\ufb01cit widened to equal 11.2% of GDP, up from \n8.0% in 2015. However, remittances and strong earnings from services \nexports, particularly BPO and tourism, managed to maintain a surplus.\nIn the capital account, net in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment \nrose to $7.9 billion, 40.7% higher year on year (Figure 3.28.6). Portfolio \ninvestments, however, registered net out\ufb02ows. The overall balance of \npayments fell into a de\ufb01cit equal to 0.1% of GDP, reversing a surplus of \n0.9% in 2015. Nevertheless, by February 2017, foreign exchange reserves \nstood at $81.1 billion, cover for 9.2 months of imports of goods and \nservices and income payments. The Philippine peso depreciated by 5.3% \nagainst the broadly strengthening US dollar in 2016. A continuing decline \nin external debt from the equivalent of 59.7% of GDP in 2005 to 24.6% in \n2016 has helped strengthen the country\u2019s external payments position.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is projected to moderate to 6.4% in 2017, re\ufb02ecting in part \nthe high base effect from last year\u2019s \ufb01gure but also rising commodity \nprices that could affect domestic demand (Figure 3.28.7).

A central bank survey conducted \nin the \ufb01rst quarter of this year found consumers remaining optimistic, \nthough expectations of higher in\ufb02ation may temper the pace of spending \n(Figure 3.28.8). Similarly, investor sentiment remains broadly positive, \nbut at the same time businesses expressed some caution arising from \nhigher oil prices, peso depreciation, and uncertainty about global trade \nand monetary policies. Encouragingly, bank lending to businesses, \noccupying 89% of the loan portfolio, continued to grow strongly, rising \nby 17.5% year on year in January this year.\n\nNet exports are expected to contract and temper GDP growth \nsomewhat. While merchandise exports are expected to rebound from \nlast year, imports will likely rise at a faster pace, re\ufb02ecting growing \nconsumer demand and investment. \n\nBy sector, services will remain the lead growth driver, though \n\nmoderating from last year\u2019s brisk pace as growth in domestic \nconsumption eases somewhat. BPO and tourism should continue to \nsupport services growth. International tourist arrivals rose by 11.3% \nlast year to reach 6 million, and growth is expected to stay strong. \nIn January 2017, tourist arrivals rose by 16.5% year on year. \n\nGrowth in manufacturing is expected to hold up well even as it \nslows slightly from last year\u2019s pace. The manufacturing production \nindex rose in January 2017 by 9.3% year on year with strong gains in \nfood processing and machinery and transport equipment. Construction-\nrelated manufactures such as metal, glass, and wood products have also \nsustained an upward trend. High capacity utilization also augurs well \nfor the manufacturing sector. Spurred by public infrastructure projects, \nconstruction is forecast to remain buoyant. Private construction is also \nshowing momentum as demand for office space, housing, and retail \nspace stays strong.\n\nEven as growth moderates, rising international prices for oil should \n\nnudge domestic in\ufb02ation up to 3.5% this year and 3.7% next year \n(Figure 3.28.9). In the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017, in\ufb02ation edged up to \n3.0% largely because of higher fuel prices and fare hikes for public \ntransportation consequently approved in February 2017. A weaker peso \nfollowing the upward adjustment of US interest rates in December \nwill exert additional upward pressure on domestic in\ufb02ation. Proposed \ntax reform to raise excise taxes on fuel\u2014an important intermediate \ninput into many economic activities\u2014could exert still more pressure on \ndomestic prices. \n\nAs in\ufb02ation approaches the upper end of the central bank target \nrange of 2%\u20134%, monetary policy will aim to strike a balance between \nsupporting growth and containing in\ufb02ation. The central bank will have \nto factor into this delicate balance the future course of US interest rates. \nA measured hike in the central bank policy rate is likely. \n\nCurrent indications are for \ufb01scal policy to remain supportive to \ngrowth. The government has raised the ceiling on the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nfrom 2.0% of GDP to 3.0%, mainly to accommodate higher development \nspending.

Allocations for social services were raised from 7.7% of GDP \nin 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Infrastructure spending, including investment in \nroads, railways, ports, health facilities, school buildings, and agricultural \nworks, is targeted to equal 5.3% of GDP in 2017, up from an average of \n2% in the past decade. The government has developed a 3-year rolling \ninfrastructure program that prioritizes public projects. To expedite \nimplementation, the government has streamlined its review and \napproval procedures, as well as its bidding and procurement processes. \nFurther, it launched an online portal covering details of government \nprojects and their status to improve project monitoring. \n\nThe current account is expected to post a modest surplus equal to \n\n0.2% of GDP in 2017, as in 2016, and 0.5% in 2018. Only modest growth \nis foreseen for merchandise exports because prospects for major \nmarkets are uneven. The \ufb01rming up of US growth is tempered by only \nmodest expansion in Japan and the European Union and by growth \nmoderation in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Japan is the Philippines\u2019 \nbiggest market, taking a \ufb01fth of all exports in 2016, followed by the US \nwith a 15% share and the European Union with 12% (Figure 3.28.10). \nHigher prices for oil and other commodities will likely widen the \nmerchandise trade de\ufb01cit. Continued strength in remittances, income \nfrom BPO, and tourism receipts will, however, counterbalance the \nmerchandise trade de\ufb01cit. \n\nRisks to the outlook could arise from two external factors: lower-\nthan-expected growth in the Philippines\u2019 major trading partners and \nuncertain trade policies in the industrial economies. Domestically, \nrealizing growth prospects will hinge on the successful implementation \nof the government\u2019s ambitious public investment program, especially \ninfrastructure projects.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014making growth more inclusive\nImproved macroeconomic fundamentals, the resumption of strong \ngrowth since 2010, and the administration\u2019s emphasis on regional \ndevelopment provide a foundation for the country to further reduce \npoverty and foster a more equal sharing of prosperity. However, income \ninequality and regional disparities hinder the bene\ufb01ts of growth from \nreaching poor and vulnerable sections of society. \n\nThe Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, improved \nfrom 0.46 in 2012 to 0.44 in 2015 but is still high for Southeast Asia \n(Figure 3.28.11). A government survey on family income and expenditure \nfound that per capita income grew faster for the poorest 30% of the \npopulation than average for all income groups from 2012 to 2015. \nThe national poverty rate fell from 25.2% in 2012 to 21.6% in 2015 but \nremains elevated in some regions.

Recognizing this, the government \nannounced a 10-point socioeconomic agenda shortly after it took office \non 30 June 2016. The agenda intensi\ufb01es efforts to sustain strong growth \nand at the same time ensure that the bene\ufb01ts of growth are shared more \nacross the population. Addressing this challenge requires concerted \nefforts to bring about more equitable access to services such as \nsanitation, safe drinking water, health care, and education.\n\nBuilding on the 10-point agenda, the Philippine Development Plan \n2017\u20132022, approved in February 2017, lays out the government strategy \nto promote more inclusive growth and development. The plan aims \nto bring down the poverty rate from 21.6% in 2015 to 14.0% by 2022, \nspeci\ufb01cally targeting poverty in lagging regions. Rural poverty is \nhigher at 30%, with most of the poor in low-paid informal farm work. \nThe government aims to reduce rural poverty to 20% by 2022.\n\nPrograms to speed poverty reduction include raising agricultural \nproductivity, building rural infrastructure such as irrigation systems \nand market roads, and establishing stronger links with industry \nand services to foster production and activities with higher value \nadded. The plan calls for larger public investments in infrastructure, \nhealth care, education, and social protection. Infrastructure master \nplans will be fast-tracked and prioritize interregional connectivity \ntoward integrating poor provinces with growth centers to improve \nthe ease of doing business and enable the efficient delivery of public \nservices. The share of development expenditure on social services and \ninfrastructure is to increase from an average of 33% budgetted for \n2010\u20132015 to 50% by 2022, boosting support for programs crucial to \nmaking growth more inclusive. \n\nTo raise more revenue to \ufb01nance infrastructure and human \ncapital investment, the government is proposing comprehensive tax \nreform. The Philippines has one of the lowest ratios of tax to GDP in \nSoutheast Asia, at 13.7% in 2016. The proposed reform aims to simplify \nthe tax system and yield more revenue. At the same time, tax burdens \nwill be made more progressive. The \ufb01rst reform package, presented to \nCongress in January 2017, includes lowering personal income tax rates \nexcept for the highest income earners. It also seeks to expand the value-\nadded tax base by limiting exemptions to raw food and other necessities \nsuch as education and health. Excise taxes on automobiles and oil \nproducts will be raised. To protect the poor from the impact of higher \noil taxes, targeted transfers and support programs will be implemented. \nFurther reforms being considered include adjusting excise taxes on \nalcohol, tobacco, and sugar-sweetened beverages and reducing the \ncorporate income tax while rationalizing \ufb01scal incentives for investors. \nThese tax reforms will be supported by stricter tax administration and \ncollection.\n\nKey to making growth more inclusive is the effective implementation \n\nof the strategies and programs under the government\u2019s medium-term \ndevelopment plan. \n\n\fSingapore\n\nThe economy grew faster in 2016, deflation persisted, and the current account improved. Growth \nis  forecast  to  trend  higher  in  2017  and  2018,  with  the  current  account  surplus  widening  in  both \nyears and prices rising for the first time since 2014. Faltering labor productivity could be improved \nin  the  coming  years  by  encouraging  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  to  innovate  and  adopt \nnew  technologies.\n\nEconomic performance \nRecovery in manufacturing and higher government expenditure \nlifted the GDP growth rate to 2.0% in 2016 from 1.9% in 2015. \nManufacturing reversed 5.1% contraction in 2015 with 3.6% growth \nled by higher output in the semiconductor and biomedical industries, \ncontributing 0.6 percentage points to GDP growth. Construction grew \nby only 0.2%, slowing from 3.9% in 2015. Services grew by 1.0% and \ncontributed 0.7 percentage points to growth, with expansion in all \nsubsectors except business services, which declined owing mainly to a \ndownturn in the real estate market (Figure 3.29.1). \n\nExternal demand was the driver of growth in 2016. In real terms, \n\nexports of goods and services grew by 1.6% and imports by 0.3%, \nraising net exports by 9.8% to contribute 2.7 percentage points to \ngrowth (Figure 3.29.2). Global economic uncertainties continued to \nweigh on investment con\ufb01dence and caused a 2.5% decline in gross \ufb01xed \ncapital formation including change in inventories, which subtracted \n0.9 percentage points from growth. Consumption expenditure grew \nby 1.8% on the strength of public spending, slowing from 5.3% in 2015 \nas household expenditure fell by 0.6% but contributing on balance \n0.8 percentage points to growth. \n\nSingapore endured more de\ufb02ation in 2016 as the consumer price \nindex declined by an average of 0.5%. Housing and utilities posted the \nlargest decline, followed by communications and, as gasoline prices fell, \nprivate transport costs. Core in\ufb02ation, which excludes accommodation \nand private road transport, was 0.9% because of higher costs for \neducation services, food, and household durables (Figure 3.29.3).\n\nMerchandise exports declined by 5.5% in 2016 as both oil and \n\nnon-oil exports slumped. As oil imports shrank as well, imports \nfell by 5.2% to leave a trade surplus of $46.0 billion, equal to 15.5% \nof GDP. The current account surplus therefore rose to 19% of GDP, \nwith the services surplus increasing by 0.5% on higher receipts from \ntravel, transport, and insurance services. However, the overall balance \nof payments slipped into a de\ufb01cit of $1.8 billion, or 0.6% of GDP, \n\nThis chapter was written by Minsoo Lee and Mai Lin Villaruel of the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n3.29.1\u2002Contributions to growth, by industry\n\n2016\n2015\n\nManufacturing\nConstruction\nUtilities\nOther goods industries\nWholesale and retail trade\nTransportation and storage\nAccommodation and food services\nInformation and communication\nFinance and insurance\nBusiness services\nOther services industries\nOwnership of dwellings\n\n\u20131.0 \u20130.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\nPercentage points\n\nNote: Excluding net indirect taxes. \nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

Official foreign reserves \nrose to $246.6 billion, or cover for 7 months of imports.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managed monetary \nconditions for price stability by keeping the policy band for the Singapore \ndollar\u2019s nominal effective exchange rate unchanged in 2016; while the \ncurrency strengthened by 1.1% by this measure, it weakened slightly \nagainst the US dollar in nominal terms (Figure 3.29.5). The 3-month \nSingapore interbank offered rate, used to price home loans, fell to \n0.97% in December 2016 from 1.25% in December 2015. Credit to the \nprivate sector rose by 5.2%, pushing up total credit by 4.6%, and growth \nin broad money supply (M2) accelerated to 8.0%. \n\nFiscal policy was contractionary in FY2016 (ended 31 March 2017), \nwith the budget recording a surplus of 1.3% of GDP. Operating revenue \nand expenditure both grew by 5.8%. Revenues increased mainly on \nhigher receipts from personal income tax, motor vehicle taxes, and \nvehicle quota premiums as purchases of certi\ufb01cates of entitlement for \nprivate cars increased. Expenditures grew as outlays rose for education, \nnational development, trade and industry, and especially health care \nsubsidies (Figure 3.29.6).\n\nEconomic prospects \nContinued restocking of technology products globally could spur \nexpansion in both electronics manufacturing and external trade, \npushing GDP growth higher to 2.2% in 2017. The purchasing managers\u2019 \nindex for manufacturing and electronics breached the 50 threshold \nin September 2016, pointing to expansion in the \ufb01rst half of this year. \nHowever, services will weigh on growth as transport and storage lag, \nalong with accommodation and real estate, though information and \ncommunication technology and essential social services will be robust. \nGDP growth is expected to improve to 2.3% in 2018 as manufacturing \nremains strong, and as services and construction improve (Figure 3.29.7).\nConsumption will drive growth in 2017, with budgetary expenditures \n\nexpected to increase by 5.2% and target education, health care, housing \nsubsidies, and infrastructure. Investment will recover from contraction \nas indicated by investment commitments reported by the Economic \nDevelopment Board, with \ufb01xed asset investment in 2017 forecast to \nreach almost S$10 billion, equal to 2.4% of GDP. Net foreign investment \ncommitments in manufacturing reached S$1.6 billion in the fourth \nquarter of 2016, growing by 48.7% year on year. Government spending \ncoupled with higher infrastructure investment, including signi\ufb01cant \ninvestment in the Malaysia\u2013Singapore high speed rail and a new \nindustrial park in Jurong District, will boost growth in 2018 to 2.3%.\n\nThe de\ufb02ationary trend appears to have ended as the consumer price \nindex inched up by 0.6% in January 2017.

Merchandise exports and imports alike picked up \nsigni\ufb01cantly in January 2017. With some growth forecast for net \nservices receipts as well, the current account surplus will expand \nmodestly to equal 19.5% of GDP in 2017 and 19.8% in 2018, though \nthe Singapore dollar is expected to appreciate marginally against the \nUS dollar in 2017.\n\nThe MAS is expected to manage the exchange rate in response to \neconomic developments over the forecast period to avert adverse impact \non exports. Fiscal policy will continue to be prudent, with the budget \nsurplus for FY2017 forecast to rise to the equivalent of 0.4% of GDP. \nHigher expenditure will be matched by rising revenue as new taxes, \nsuch as a water conservation tax on potable water, are introduced and \ndiesel taxes are restructured. \n\nExternal risks to the outlook include uncertainty regarding global \n\neconomic conditions and a changing policy environment. The rising \nspecter of protectionism has heightened these risks and can weaken \nsentiment in the \ufb01nancial markets, dampening external demand \nand, hence, trade-related activity. Domestically, persistent weakness \nin the residential property market could choke investment growth, \nand rising labor costs and stagnant labor productivity could hinder \ngrowth in labor-intensive sectors, slowing economic growth in the \nforecast period.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014raising labor productivity  \nin an aging society\nOver the past 3 years, labor productivity growth in Singapore, measured \nas average growth in value added per actual hour worked, has been \nnearly \ufb02at (Figure 3.29.9). It grew by a compounded annual growth \nrate of only 2.6% during 2009\u20132016. Excluding the 2010 rebound \nfollowing the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009, the same measure \nof productivity growth yielded only 1.5%, well below the government \ntarget of 2%\u20133% growth per annum to 2020. This stagnation is partly \nexplained by recent changes in employment patterns. According to a \nrecent Ministry of Trade and Industry economic survey, actual hours \nworked in more productive sectors, mainly the externally oriented \nindustries that need to stay competitive in the global market, have \ndeclined relative to actual hours worked in less productive areas, \nincluding construction and food services, dragging down overall \nproductivity (Figure 3.29.10).\n\nGovernment policies have focused on raising productivity in \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as they contribute \nabout half of the GDP and employ 70% of the workforce. SMEs suffer \nlower productivity because of inefficient service delivery and poor \nmanagement skills. They need to improve their productivity as they \nface stiffening competition from neighboring economies. The authorities \nhave launched several initiatives to raise SME productivity.\n\nS$/$\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company and Haver Analytics \n(accessed 7 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.6\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nOperating and developmental expenditure\nSpecial transfers\nOperating revenue\nNet investment returns contribution\nSurplus/de\ufb01cit\n\n1999 = 100\n\n130\n\n128\n\n126\n\n124\n\n122\n\n120\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\nBudget\n\nNote: The \ufb01scal year ends on 31 March of the following year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance (accessed 21 February 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29.7\u2002 Manufacturing purchasing \n\nmanagers\u2019 index\n\nManufacturing\nElectronics\n\nExpansion\n\nIndex\n\n55\n\n53\n\n50\n\n48\n\n45\n\nContraction\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 7 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nSingapore\u2002\u2002253\n\nIn 2016, it announced the continuation of a program that provides \n\n3.29.8\u2002 Merchandise trade\n\nworking capital loans to SMEs, which can be used to fund modern \ninformation technology businesses and help SMEs install digital \nplatforms. The 2017 budget has allocated S$600 million for public \npartnerships with SMEs to scale up their operations and enable them to \nengage in international trade. SMEs can deduct from tax liability twice \ntheir expenses on market expansion and development. Other initiatives \nto improve SME productivity include identifying appropriate \ntechnologies tailored to SMEs\u2019 speci\ufb01c needs and co-investors that can \nhelp SMEs expand and internationalize. \n\nThe government-chaired Committee on the Future Economy has \n\nproposed providing SMEs with easy access to \ufb01nance, catalyzing \nthe supply of growth capital, and assisting with international trade \nprocedures. SMEs Go Digital is a program introduced in the 2017 budget \nthat aims to enhance digital capability in SMEs, especially in sectors \nwith room to signi\ufb01cantly improve productivity such as retail, food \nservices, wholesale trade, logistics, cleaning, and security. \n\nThese and similar initiatives are bearing fruit. In the recent survey \n\nconducted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry, 88% of SMEs have adopted measures to improve productivity, \nand more SMEs are attempting to change their business model toward \nundertaking activities with higher value added. SMEs in manufacturing \nand services have innovated their business practices and organization. \nThese efforts can be enhanced by helping SMEs to streamline and \nharmonize business practices toward enabling them to take advantage of \nopportunities in the ASEAN Economic Community.\n\nDespite these efforts, signi\ufb01cantly improving labor productivity is \n\na challenge in a land-constrained economy with an aging workforce \nand few natural resources. Policies can nevertheless be implemented to \nalleviate land and age constraints. Land should be allocated to activities \nwith higher value added and those that use it efficiently. The constraint \nof an aging population can be addressed through retraining and \nsenior-friendly wellness programs. The alleviation of these constraints \ncan, combined with SME willingness to innovate, promise important \nproductivity gains for Singapore over the medium term. \n\nOil exports\nOther exports\nOil imports\nOther imports\n\n$ billion\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201360\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 7 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.29 9\u2002 Growth rate of value added \nper actual hour worked\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\nPreliminary\n\nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

Growth  is  likely  to  be  slightly  higher  this  year  and \nnext,  while  inflation  should  edge  up  and  the  current  account  surplus  narrow.  How  effectively  the \nThailand  4.0  development  agenda  reignites  growth  will  hinge  on  how  well  Thailand\u2019s  youngsters \nupgrade  their  skills.\n\nEconomic performance \nGDP grew by 3.2% in 2016, marginally higher than the previous year\u2019s \nrate of 2.9% (Figure 3.30.1). A turnaround in agriculture contributed to \nthe mild pickup in growth, while most other major sectors either slowed \nor maintained their 2015 pace. \n\nImproved weather in the second half of the year enabled agriculture \nto post growth at 0.6% last year, marking a signi\ufb01cant turnaround from \nthe previous year\u2019s 5.7% contraction. Growth in construction was a \nstrong 8.3% but less than half of the previous year\u2019s impressive 17.0%. \nConstruction was led by public works, especially by state enterprises. \nManufacturing, which had grown by 1.5% in 2015, was still sluggish \nbut steady with 1.4% growth last year. Aided by expansion in hotels, \nrestaurants, and other tourism-related businesses, the service sector \nheld up well with robust 4.7% growth, which was very similar to its \n2015 pace. \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption grew by 3.1%, enabled \n\nby agriculture\u2019s turnaround to improve on 2.2% growth in 2015. \nRising prices for agricultural products and the end of drought in \nthe second half of the year boosted farm income in nominal terms \nby 2.8% over the whole year, reversing a steep 9.6% reduction in 2015. \nAlso aiding private consumption, the government offered tax rebates for \na few weeks of shopping and dining, initially during the Thai New Year \nin April and then during the Christmas season in December. \n\nHaving contracted by 2.2% in 2015, private investment picked up by \nan estimated 0.4% last year on a gradual recovery in business sentiment. \nAs the government maintained an expansionary \ufb01scal stance, public \ninvestment continued to be an important driver of growth in 2016, \nthough it slowed from a whopping 29.3% growth in 2015 to a still sturdy \n9.9% last year (Figure 3.30.2). \n\nPartly re\ufb02ecting the fragile external environment, merchandise \n\nexports hardly grew last year, having contracted by 5.6% in 2015. \nEncouragingly, signs of an export recovery were evident by the \nsecond half of the year.

Exports of manufacturing products \nexpanded by 2.6%, led by electrical appliances, electronics, chemicals, \nand petrochemicals. \n\nMeanwhile, merchandise imports continue to contract by 4.7% \nlast year on top of a 10.6% contraction in 2015. Imports of consumer \ngoods expanded by 5.8%, and beginning in the fourth quarter imports \nof capital goods also picked up. The trade balance still registered a \nlarge surplus of $35.8 billion (Figure 3.30.3). Although tourist arrivals \nslowed in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the same quarter in 2015 \nbecause of the mourning period for the King, who died on 13 October, \nand a crackdown on fraudulent tours targeting low-end visitors from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), net services exports for the year as a \nwhole posted strong growth at 26.5% (Figure 3.30.4). The country thus \naccumulated a current account surplus of $46.4 billion, equal to 11.4% \nof GDP, boosting international reserves in December to $171.9 billion, or \ncover for 9.4 months of imports, or 3.2 times short-term external debt.\nSlack in manufacturing kept a lid on prices last year despite rising \ninternational prices for oil and other commodities. In\ufb02ation for the year \nas a whole came in at 0.2% (Figure 3.30.5). Consumer prices excluding \nfood and beverages started to increase in the last quarter of 2016, \nfollowing decreases for 9 quarters in succession. In\ufb02ationary pressure \nnevertheless remained low as drought eased and price rises for fresh \nfood slowed in the second half. \n\nOn the \ufb01scal front, the government implemented a number \nof subsidized public welfare programs: cash transfer schemes for \nlow-income earners, housing loans at low interest rates, and soft \nloans for farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, and startups, \nas well as tax deductions. These measures involved the government \npaying to special \ufb01nancial institutions the difference between the \ndiscount rate at which they lent to program bene\ufb01ciaries and the \nmarket rate at which they raised funds. Moreover, the government \ninjected public funds into the countryside through newly established \nrevolving village funds.\n\nGovernment revenues increased by 9.3% in FY2016 (ended \n\n30 September 2016), pushing the ratio of revenue to GDP from 16.1% in \nFY2015 to 16.8%. At the same time, expansionary \ufb01scal policy raised \ngovernment expenditure by 9.0%, causing the ratio of expenditure to \nGDP to climb as well, from 18.4% in FY2015 to 19.1%. Of $2.4 billion in \ncapital expenditure in FY2016, more than half was on large transport \ninfrastructure projects under the government\u2019s transport infrastructure \nmaster plan to 2022. Adjusting for changes in the government\u2019s \noff-budget cash account, the overall \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit edged up from 2.5% of \nGDP in FY2015 to 2.7% last \ufb01scal year.\n\nDespite low in\ufb02ation and ample foreign exchange reserves, the \n\ncentral bank kept its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.5% in the second \nhalf of 2016, re\ufb02ecting its perception that the economy was on a recovery \npath in the face of global uncertainties.\n\n%\n15\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201315\n\n%\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\u201330\n\n3.30.3\u2002Trade indicators\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th  \n(accessed 8 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.4\u2002Tourism indicators\n\nNumber of tourists\n\nGrowth in tourist numbers\n\nMillion visitors\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th  \n(accessed 8 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.30.5\u2002Inflation and policy interest rate\n\nPolicy interest rate\nOverall in\ufb02ation\nCore in\ufb02ation\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n2017\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; CEIC Data \nCompany (both accessed 8 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f256\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nEconomic prospects\nSustained recovery in the major industrial economies, robust domestic \nconsumption, and the continued implementation of large public \ninfrastructure projects should help GDP grow by 3.5% this year and \n3.6% next (Figure 3.30.6). A gradual rise in the international price of rice \nshould provide a further \ufb01llip.\n\nDomestic consumption is expected to continue to expand, albeit \nmodestly. Farm incomes should rise further along with commodity \nprices, assuming a return to normal weather. In 2018, the new personal \nincome tax structure that allows more tax-deductible expenditures \npromises to lend support to consumption. The consumer con\ufb01dence \nindex plunged in October and November 2016 following the death of \nthe King but recovered in December 2016 and continued to rise in \nJanuary 2017 (Figure 3.30.7). Because high household debt remains a \ndrag on domestic consumption, the government introduced measures to \n\ufb01x the longstanding problem of micro\ufb01nance institutions overcharging \ntheir vulnerable borrowers. A \u201cpico \ufb01nance\u201d license scheme went into \noperation in March 2017 to encourage informal lenders to conduct \ntheir business more transparently, and new legislation caps their \nlending rates. \n\nPublic investment will be a key driver of growth over the short term \n\nif the government expeditiously implements its planned $40 billion \ninfrastructure investment program. Projects under the program include \nthe construction of a double-track rail line and a major motorway \nand the expansion of a deepwater seaport. Bidding for several more \ninfrastructure projects began in 2016. According to the Ministry of \nTransport, another 36 transport infrastructure projects worth \n$25.6 billion will be ready for investment this year. Financing for \nthe projects will come from multiple sources, with the public budget \nproviding 8.3%, loans 64.3%, public\u2013private partnerships 22.1%, the \nThailand Future Fund 4.9%, and state-owned enterprises 0.4%. \n\nThe implementation of large public infrastructure projects \nshould spur private investment by boosting business con\ufb01dence. \nPrivate investment is projected to pick up slowly this year and next as \nprospects for exports improve and manufacturers expand production. \nAlthough average utilization of industrial capacity is not high, standing \nat 60.5% in January 2017, in some subsectors\u2014notably electronics, \nelectrical parts, and chemical products\u2014it exceeds 90%. \n\nAs growth edges up and international oil prices rise, in\ufb02ation should \n\nrise but remain subdued at 1.8% this year and a somewhat higher rate \nnext year (Figure 3.30.8).

Merchandise export growth is set to return to positive \nterritory this year and continue to strengthen next year. \n\nThailand\u2019s tourism sector looks strong. The adverse effects of the \nmourning period and the crackdown on fraudulent tours dented tourist \narrivals in the last quarter of 2016, but these effects have already started \nto wane. The number of tourist arrivals increased in January 2017 \nby 6.5% year on year. A promotion begun in December 2016 that \ntemporarily waves or reduces visa fees for the holders of selected \npassports could further support tourism in 2017. Tourism is expected \nto expand this year and next at its 2016 pace. The Tourism Authority of \nThailand projects that the number of tourist arrivals will increase by \n8.1% in 2017 to reach 35.3 million.\n\nMerchandise imports are projected to grow in line with higher \n\nprivate investment and demand for manufacturing components, \nas well as higher oil prices. As imports start to grow, the current account \nsurplus should shrink further from 11.4% of GDP last year to 9.0% this \nyear and 7.0% in 2018 (Figure 3.30.9). \n\nRisks to the outlook come from the potential impact of changes in \nUS trade policy. Although the share of Thailand\u2019s exports going directly \nto the US is only about 11%, the Thai economy is tightly interwoven \nwith Asian production networks and supply chains such that Thai \nexports could be hurt indirectly. An increase in US tariffs on imports \nfrom the PRC, for example, could translate into lower Thai exports \nof electronics, electrical parts, and machinery to the PRC. Volatility \nin capital \ufb02ows is another risk, but the country\u2019s comfortable foreign \nexchange position should provide a good buffer. On the domestic \nfront, undue delays in implementing the transport infrastructure \nprogram and other core components of the recently approved \nThailand 4.0 development policy agenda could weigh on the economic \nprospects, as could a sudden discontinuity in the general direction of \neconomic policy.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reigniting growth \nthrough Thailand 4.0\nWith Thailand suffering subpar growth in recent years when compared \nwith growth in its Southeast Asian peers or with its own past \nperformance, concern is growing that the country may have slipped onto \na low-growth path that leads to the middle-income trap. The economy \ngrew at an average annual rate of 9.5% in the decade to 1996, before the \nAsian \ufb01nancial crisis of 1997\u20131998, then slowed to an average of 5.2% \nfrom 1999 to 2005. Since then, growth has plummeted further to an \naverage of 3.3%. At this juncture, reigniting growth is the government\u2019s \nmost pressing policy challenge. \n\nRecognizing the problem, the government embarked last year on an \nambitious program of strategic reform dubbed Thailand 4.0, which aims \nto lift the country\u2019s long-term growth path. In a nutshell, Thailand 4.0 \nis built on three strategic components: an agricultural transformation \naway from traditional farming to what it calls \u201csmart farming,\u201d \nindustrial restructuring to convert small and medium-sized enterprises \n\n\f258\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\ninto \u201csmart enterprises,\u201d and service sector upgrading to wean tourism-\nrelated services in particular away from short-stay, low-spending \ntourists toward high-value guests. \n\n3.30.10\u2002 Global competitiveness rankings\n\nOverall \nHigher education & training \n\nAchieving the objectives of Thailand 4.0 requires a big push in \n\nRanking\n\nA 2014 survey by the Economic Intelligence Center, the research unit \n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\nNote: Thailand ranking against 138 economies.\nSource: World Economic Forum. 2016.

The government has announced that it plans to spend more \nthan $57 billion on infrastructure development during the next 8 years. \nIn addition to the expeditious implementation of the infrastructure \nprogram, it is crucial that policy makers address the country\u2019s growing \nskills gap in earnest.\n\nof Siam Commercial Bank, showed that a shortage of skilled workers \nseverely constrains business expansion in a number of sectors. What is \nmore, the shortage will only worsen in the years ahead as the country\u2019s \npopulation ages rapidly and the absolute number of people of working \nage, from 15 to 64 years old, begins to shrink in 2018. Moreover, the \nsurvey found the quality of education and training that the country\u2019s \nyouth receive is woefully inadequate to meet labor market needs. \nIn a similar vein, The Global Competitiveness Report 2016\u20132017 of the \nWorld Economic Forum indicates that business expansion in skills-\nintensive sectors is hampered by shortcomings in the Thai workforce \nin terms of both quantity and quality (Figure 3.30.10). \n\nstudents generally underperform their peers in Viet Nam and Malaysia, \nfor example, on standardized tests conducted by the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development, scoring particularly \npoorly in science and mathematics. Even higher education suffers a \nwide mismatch between the skills that education institutions impart \nto their students and what the labor market requires (Figure 3.30.11). \nEducation institutions churn out many graduates in liberal arts, for \nwhom there is limited demand, but far fewer graduates in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, for whom demand is rapidly \nrising in Thailand, as in other upper-middle-income economies. \n\nThese education and training inadequacies need to be effectively \naddressed if the Thailand 4.0 development agenda for rapidly moving \nthe country toward high-income status is to get much traction in the \ncoming years. A quickly aging population makes education reform and \nupgrading the skills base of the young even more urgent. Education and \ntraining institutions need to engage far more with business to ensure \nthe success of education reform.\n\n1\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nMean\nExpected\n\nYears of schooling\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\nSource: United Nations Development Programme.  \nhttp://hdr.undp.org/en/data (accessed 7 March 2017).\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nThe skills gap may persist for years because Thai high school \n\n3.30.11\u2002Selected education indicators\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nWeaker  agriculture  and  oil  production  offset  booming  services,  manufacturing,  and  construction \nto  slow  GDP  growth  to  6.2%  in  2016.

Despite somewhat better weather in the second half \nof the year, agriculture growth slowed from 2.4% in 2015 to 1.4% as \nadverse weather in the \ufb01rst half affected production, particularly in \nthe Central Highlands and the Mekong Delta. Field crops were the \nworst performers, their growth easing to 0.7%, but they were partly \ncompensated by growth in \ufb01sheries at 2.8% and forestry at 6.1%. \n\nDespite 4.0% contraction in mining output with continued weakness \n\nin international oil prices and aging domestic oil \ufb01elds, industry \nand construction grew by 7.6%, albeit slowing from 9.6% in 2015. \nManufacturing bene\ufb01ted from brisk foreign investment up by 11.9%, and \nhigh credit growth contributed to 10.0% growth in construction.\n\nin 2015. The uptick was driven by a boom in tourist arrivals, which \nsoared by a whopping 26.0% in 2016, lifting tourism-related services by \n6.7%. Banking and \ufb01nance also grew strongly, expanding by 7.8%.\n\nDomestic demand remained strong, underpinned by a continuing \nsurge in investment and a robust rise in consumption. Supported by \nbuoyant foreign direct investment (FDI) in\ufb02ows and credit, investment \nsurged by 9.7% last year on top of a 9.0% rise in the preceding year. \nAlthough growth in private consumption eased from 9.3% in 2015, \nit was still robust at 7.3%. Net merchandise exports made a positive \ncontribution to GDP growth as export growth exceeded import growth. \nIn\ufb02ation averaged 2.7% in 2016, up from 0.6% in 2015. Contributing \n\nto the rise were a pickup in international oil prices, rising food\u00a0prices \nbecause of drought, and upward adjustments to fees for public education \nand health care. In the \ufb01rst 2 months of 2017, in\ufb02ation edged up further \nto 5.0% in the year to date (Figure\u00a03.31.2).\n\nAgainst the backdrop of rising but moderate in\ufb02ation, the State Bank \n\nof Viet Nam, the central bank, kept policy interest rates steady in\u00a02016 \nwhile commercial lending rates were trimmed by 0.5%\u20131.0% in the \nlast quarter of the year.

Despite \ufb02uctuations \nin international \ufb01nancial markets, the Viet Nam dong remained \nrelatively stable, depreciating by about 1% against the US dollar during \nthe year (Figure 3.31.4).\n\nThe current account surplus was estimated to equal 3.3% of GDP \n\nlast\u00a0year, up from 0.5% in 2015, as the country posted a large trade \nsurplus of around $14 billion, equal to 6.9% of GDP (Figure\u00a03.31.5). \nMerchandise exports rose by an estimated 8.5%, while import growth \nslowed sharply to an estimated 4.6%. The biggest export gains were \nin mobile phones and their components, which increased by 14% and \nnow\u00a0comprise 20% of total exports. A 15% drop in oil imports and an \n11% drop in imports of transportation equipment and spare parts slowed \nthe pace of import growth. Re\ufb02ecting both strong investment and \nbuoyant consumption, growth in imports of electronic components and \nconsumer goods was in the range of 9%\u201313%. \n\nThe capital account posted an estimated surplus equal to 3.4% of \n\nGDP, bolstered by strong FDI disbursement. The overall balance of \npayments surplus reached 4.2% of GDP. The strengthening balance of \npayments allowed the central bank to build up its foreign exchange \nreserves to an estimated 2.7 months of import cover, up from the \n2.3\u00a0months at the beginning of 2016 (Figure 3.31.6).\n\nEfforts to rein in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit had only limited success. Although \ngovernment revenue grew by 12% to reach the equivalent of 23.1% of\u00a0GDP, \nit was outstripped by expenditure growth, resulting in an on-budget \nde\ufb01cit equal to 4.4% of GDP, signi\ufb01cantly higher than the 2015 \ufb01gure \nof 4.0%. This is a matter of concern, especially as public debt including \ngovernment-guaranteed debt is now estimated to exceed 63% of GDP, \nnearing the 65% limit set by the National Assembly. \n\nProgress in reforming the \ufb01nancial sector has been elusive. \n\nAlthough\u00a0the officially reported nonperforming loan (NPL) rate in 2015 \nand 2016 remained low at about 2.5% of outstanding loans, this largely \nre\ufb02ected the transfer of $12.7 billion in NPLs from banks to the state-\nowned Viet\u00a0Nam Asset Management Company. By the end of\u00a02016, \nthe\u00a0company had resolved only 18% of the NPLs purchased from banks. \nReal progress in reining in NPLs would thus depend on how fast it \ncan resolve its impaired assets and at what cost. Moreover, progress \nin consolidating the banking system continues to languish, with no \nmergers or acquisitions completed in 2016.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is projected to be higher at 6.5% in 2017 and 6.7% in 2018 \n(Figure 3.31.7). With strong growth in manufacturing and services likely \nto continue, a modest pickup in agriculture and mining output should \ngive an additional \ufb01llip to the economy. \n\nManufacturing will be boosted by the continued opening of new \nforeign-invested factories on the back of record FDI disbursements \nlast\u00a0year (Figure 3.31.8).

The government targets agriculture growth at 2.8% in 2017. \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption is expected to expand \n\nrobustly. Consumer sentiment remains buoyant, as indicated by a \nNovember 2016 survey showing that 43% of businesses expected retail \nsales to improve in 2017 and another 39% expected conditions to \nremain\u00a0stable. \n\nProspects for private investment look bright. Reform to \n\nbusiness\u00a0practices has helped move Viet Nam up in the World Bank\u2019s \nDoing Business rankings from 91 among 189 countries surveyed in\u00a02016 \nto 82 among 190 in 2017. Ongoing reform to allow greater foreign \nownership of domestic stocks and state-owned enterprises, along with \nreform to facilitate private participation in building infrastructure, \nshould encourage private investment. The number of newly established \nenterprises hit a record high of 110,000 in 2016, up by 16.2% from 2015. \nThe Nikkei purchasing managers\u2019 index, which measures expectations \nfor business inventory, reached a record high in February 2017, with a \nparticularly sharp rise in new orders to manufacturers (Figure 3.31.9). \nAs growth strengthens, in\ufb02ation is expected to edge up to 4.0% \nthis\u00a0year and 5.0% in 2018 (Figure 3.31.10). The expected rise in global \nfood and fuel prices, higher US interest rates, and a stronger dollar \nwill add to imported in\ufb02ation. Another likely source of in\ufb02ation is the \ncontinued implementation of the government road map on administered \nprices for education, health, electricity and water tariffs, and \nminimum\u00a0wages. \n\nHigher growth and in\ufb02ation will cause the current account surplus \nto narrow. Merchandise exports are seen rising by an annual rate of 10% \nover the next 2 years as new foreign-invested factories start producing \nand new trade agreements take effect. Imports are likely to rise even \nfaster as larger FDI in\ufb02ows draw in additional imports of capital goods \nand manufacturing inputs. The current account surplus is thus expected \nto moderate to 2.0% of GDP this year and 2.5% in 2018 (Figure 3.31.11).\n\nPublic debt pressures have prompted the government to set \n\nambitious targets for the budget de\ufb01cit, reining it in to the equivalent \nof 3.5% of GDP in 2017 and holding it to about 4.0% next year. Most\u00a0of \nthe reduction in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit would, however, be due to higher \nreceipts from the sale of equity in state-owned enterprises, which the \ngovernment treats as revenue. Excluding those receipts, \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit \nreduction will be much more modest.

The capital adequacy ratio was \nreported at an estimated 12.8% at the end of 2016, comfortably above \nthe regulatory minimum of 9.0%, but it was not calculated according to \ninternational Basel II standards. With the government planning to have \nall commercial banks meet Basel II capital standards by 2020, they will \nlikely need capital injections from foreign investors. This will require \nsigni\ufb01cant improvements to the legal framework, including the lifting of \nlimits on foreign ownership of banks.\n\nAnother threat to the outlook is any sudden weakening in global \n\ndemand. Slower growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China, a major \ntrading partner, would undermine Viet Nam\u2019s trade position. Further, \nany worsening of global \ufb01nancial volatility could spill over into the \ndomestic market even though Viet Nam\u2019s capital market is not fully open.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014creating a more efficient \nand sustainable agriculture sector\nAs Viet Nam begins to recover from its most severe drought in a\u00a0decade, \nthe role of agriculture in the economy and the country\u2019s ability to \nmove\u00a0up from lower-middle to upper-middle-income status have \nreceived heightened policy attention. \n\nIn the past, agriculture was a signi\ufb01cant driver of growth and \npoverty reduction. The removal of trade barriers and the abolition \nof collective farming during the late 1980s and 1990s encouraged \ninfusions of human and physical capital into the sector and boosted \noutput. However, past reform to agriculture generated only one-off \ngains for the most part and did little to boost agricultural productivity \nper worker. As\u00a0a result, even after 20 years of reform, Viet Nam has \none of the lowest levels of agricultural labor productivity in the region \n(Figure\u00a03.31.12). \n\nMajor transformation in the sector to make it more efficient and \nsustainable is vital to lifting GDP growth in Viet Nam and enabling \nit to graduate to upper-middle-income status. Achieving such a \ntransformation requires addressing four main policy challenges. \n\nThe \ufb01rst is market structure and competitiveness. State-owned \nenterprises currently dominate input supply, postharvest processing, \nand the marketing of produce.

Further, farmers need to adopt improved \nagricultural technology and methods that are more productive and \nenvironmentally friendly. This requires stronger engagement between \nagricultural research institutions and farmers.\n\nA third requirement is more sustainable natural resource \nmanagement, including policies to encourage the consolidation of \nlandholdings into larger plots. More than 80% of farms in Viet Nam \nare smaller than 1 hectare. Farmers rely increasingly on marginal \nplots and use ever-increasing quantities of chemical fertilizer to \nspur production with little concern for long-term environmental \nimpacts. Worsening\u00a0water quality is a particularly important concern. \nAgriculture already uses 82% of available freshwater in Viet Nam. \nWater\u00a0pollution in Viet Nam\u2019s rivers is threatening the sustainability of \nwater use for agriculture. \n\nFinally, there is an urgent need to address the worsening impacts \n\nof climate change on agriculture. Viet Nam is among the countries \nmost vulnerable to climate change, with agriculture particularly at \nrisk because it relies heavily on stable agro-ecological and climatic \nconditions. Aside from drought, water resources will likely be affected \nby increasingly unreliable river \ufb02ow patterns, which will force farmers \nto depend more on groundwater. Fisheries and other coastal resources \nare highly vulnerable to temperature change, uncontrolled inundation, \nand salinity intrusion. To adequately prepare for climate change, \nViet Nam will require strong leadership that ensures climate change \nconsiderations are integrated into policy making, and to prioritize \nsmart\u00a0green investments such as improved water resource planning and \nmore efficient water use.\n\n\f\fTHE PACIFIC\n\nFIJI\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA\nSOLOMON ISLANDS\nTIMOR-LESTE\nVANUATU\nNORTH PACIFIC ECONOMIES\nSOUTH PACIFIC ECONOMIES\nSMALL ISLAND ECONOMIES\n\n\fFiji\n\nEconomic  growth  slowed  in  2016  because  of  damage  from  Cyclone  Winston  estimated  to  equal \n28% of GDP, with agriculture and forestry the hardest hit. Substantial resources from development \npartners  supported  relief  and  rehabilitation,  and  reasonable  progress  was  made  despite  capacity \nchallenges.  Continuing  reconstruction  is  expected  to  accelerate  growth  in  2017  and  2018,  as  will \nfiscal  policies  supporting  ambitious  works  to  develop  economic  infrastructure,  especially  roads.\n\nEconomic performance \nFiji has experienced 7 consecutive years of economic expansion, but \ngrowth slowed in 2016 as a result of substantial damage and losses \nsustained from Cyclone Winston in February 2016 (Figure 3.32.1). \nThe cyclone severely affected public infrastructure, particularly \nin rural Fiji, and forced agriculture and forestry into recession. \nSugarcane production, which contributes 27% of agricultural output \nand had stabilized in 2015 after 3 years of growth, plunged by 25% \n(Figure 3.32.2).\n\nOther sectors re\ufb02ected the resulting slowdown as well, but growth \n\nwas sustained in mining and quarrying, construction, wholesale and \nretail trade, and professional services. Tourism continued to be the \nmain driver of growth. Signi\ufb01cant growth in visitor arrivals from \nNew Zealand and Asia\u2014the latter by 24.7% but from a fairly small base\u2014\nled 5.0% growth in arrivals overall, despite a 1.9% decline from Australia, \nFiji\u2019s largest market by far (Figure 3.32.3). \n\nSigni\ufb01cant investment to improve public infrastructure has boosted \nthe growth potential of the economy over the long run. However, growth \nin credit to the private sector was, at 12.6% in 2016, down from 14.4% \nin 2015. This slowdown re\ufb02ected weaker economic activity as a result of \nCyclone Winston.\n\nConsumption grew strongly in 2016. This was re\ufb02ected by indicators \nsuch as 32% growth in new vehicle sales and 9% growth in secondhand \nvehicle sales during the year. Commercial bank lending for consumption \nexpanded by 7.9%, and imports of consumer goods increased by 14.7%. \nInward remittances are estimated to have risen by 10.2%, further fueling \ngrowth in consumption. \n\nAfter 2 years of low in\ufb02ation, the consumer price index rose by an \n\nannual average of 3.9%, mainly because of disrupted domestic food \nsupply following Cyclone Winston but also because of higher taxes on \nalcoholic beverages and tobacco. Declines in prices for fuel, transport, \ncommunication, household equipment and furnishings, recreation, and \nmiscellaneous items could not offset the increases. \n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Shiu Raj Singh of the South Paci\ufb01c Subregional Office, ADB, Suva.\n\n3.32.1\u2002GDP growth\n\n2010\u20132015 average\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.32.2\u2002Sugarcane production\n\nMillion tons\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\n2016\n\nSource: Fiji Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nFiji\u2002\u2002267\n\nAfter Cyclone Winston, the government changed its \ufb01scal year \nfrom the calendar year to one ending on 31 July of the year for which \nit is named. Although there was signi\ufb01cant reallocation of budgetary \nresources following the cyclone to meet immediate relief and \nrehabilitation needs, the de\ufb01cit for FY2016 came to the equivalent of \nonly 1.6% of GDP, substantially lower than de\ufb01cits of 4.1% in 2014 and \n3.2% in FY2015 (Figure 3.32.4). The reduced \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit resulted from \nhigher direct and indirect tax revenues and lower-than-expected capital \nexpenditure. At the end of July 2016, public debt equaled 47.9% of GDP, \nmore than 70% of it domestic. The Fiji National Provident Fund holds \n46.9% of government debt.\n\nMonetary policy remained accommodative with the policy interest \nrate at 0.5%. Commercial bank lending rates are still low by historical \nstandards, but recent liquidity developments have stirred interest rates \nfor deposits. Liquidity fell by 7.5% in 2016 as commercial banks\u2019 demand \ndeposits with the central bank declined. Average rates for time deposits \nof more than 24 months edged upward to 2.95%, an increase of 25 basis \npoints over the previous year. This could induce commercial banks to \nincrease their lending rates.\n\nImports fell in 2016 despite strong consumer demand and \n\ncyclone reconstruction. This allowed robust growth in earnings from \ntourism and remittances to push the current account surplus excluding \naircraft to the equivalent of 3.4% of GDP in the \ufb01rst 3 quarters of 2016. \nForeign reserves stood at $960 million at the end of the year, sufficient \nto cover 5.4 months of retained imports of goods and nonfactor services.\n\nEconomic prospects \nAs the economy recovers from Cyclone Winston, growth is projected \nto reach 3.5% in 2017. All sectors are expected to register positive \ngrowth given the uptick in demand, with major contributions from \nmanufacturing, transport and storage, \ufb01nance and insurance, wholesale \nand retail trade, accommodation and food services, and construction. \nPublic spending is expected to rise in 2017 as the reconstruction of \nschools and homes damaged by Cyclone Winston picks up pace. \n\nMore building permits were issued in 2016 than in the previous year, \n\nsignaling that construction will grow strongly in 2017. Further, an \nincrease of 12.5% in visitor numbers in January augurs well for tourism \nin 2017. Inward remittances have been growing strongly over the past \nfew years (Figure 3.32.5). This trend is expected to continue in 2017 \nwith increasing labor exports, not only of seasonal workers but also of \nprofessional athletes and military personnel deployed on peacekeeping \nmissions. Higher remittances will support higher consumption and \ninvestment, adding to economic stimulus. \n\nRising international prices for fuel and food will bring some \nin\ufb02ation, but price increases will not be as signi\ufb01cant as in 2016 \n(Figure 3.32.6). Higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco will \ncontinue to contribute to in\ufb02ation. Domestic food prices are expected to \nnormalize in the coming months as supplies are restored. \n\nExports are expected to grow strongly as agriculture recovers. \n\nWith earnings from tourism and remittances higher than expected, \n\n3.32.3\u2002Visitor arrivals, by source\n\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia\nPaci\ufb01c islands\n\nThousands\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nSource: Fiji Bureau of Statistics.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.32.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n3.5\n\n2.5\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3.32.4\u2002Fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nNote: Calendar years from 2010 to 2014 but \ufb01scal years \n(ending on 30 July of that year) from 2015 to 2016.\nSource: Fiji Ministry of Economy.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f268\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nthe current account will likely remain stable even with rising imports \nfor cyclone reconstruction.

Impacts on health care, coastal \ninfrastructure, water resources, agriculture, forestry, and \ufb01sheries \nare often substantial and widespread, as shown by the aftermath of \nCyclone Winston. \n\nThe country is \ufb01nalizing its national development plan, which \n\nwill be integrated with its Green Growth Framework to address \nadverse climate effects on economic assets. Climate resilience is being \nmainstreamed into public investment decisions. \n\nThe government\u2019s recent switch to a \ufb01scal year that begins and \nends well outside of the November\u2013April cyclone season is intended to \nfacilitate the timely funding of disaster response. The mainstreaming \napproach goes further, though, and includes shifting away from an \nemphasis on post-disaster emergency response toward community \npreparedness and disaster mitigation, and on integrating into national \ndevelopment planning the inevitable impacts of disasters.\n\nA signi\ufb01cant challenge for Fiji is to expand its infrastructure in \n\nline with economic growth, and to make it resilient under climate \nchange so it can help sustain growth even as adverse weather becomes \nincreasingly frequent and intense. For example, growth over the \npast 7 years has strained the transport network, all the more so as \nadverse weather hastens road deterioration. It is therefore vital that \nthe government integrate climate resilience considerations into its \npublic investment decisions to reduce the need for rehabilitation and \nreconstruction following natural disasters. \n\n3.32.6\u2002Inflation\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015\n\n2016 2017 2018\n\nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nGrowth  at  2.0%  in  2016  was  considerably  lower  than  in  previous  years  and  came  largely  from \nmineral  resources.  The  economy  is  expected  to  grow  by  2.5%  in  2017  and,  with  the  hosting  of \nthe  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Leaders\u2019  Meeting,  by  2.8%  in  2018.  While  the  short-term \noutlook  skews  to  the  downside,  the  medium-term  outlook  remains  positive  thanks  to  foreign \ninvestments  in  the  pipeline.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy is estimated to have grown by 2.0% in 2016, marking \na sharp slowdown from high growth rates in the previous 4 years \n(Figure 3.33.1). Economic growth was weighed down by slowing foreign \ninvestment, soft global commodity prices, and unfavorable weather.\n\nPreliminary estimates show that the oil and gas sector contracted \nby 1.2% in 2016 as oil production declined in maturing oil \ufb01elds and gas \nproduction reached full capacity. Mining and quarrying grew by 8.0% \nin 2016 as the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine resumed operations in the \n\ufb01rst quarter. This offset the closure of the Ramu nickel mine for several \nmonths because of noncompliance with safety standards, as well as the \nPorgera gold and silver mine being forced to scale down operations by a \nlandslip and sabotage to power transmission lines. \n\nAgriculture, forestry, and \ufb01sheries, which provide about one-\ufb01fth \n\nof economic output, grew by 3.0% in 2016. Higher copra and copra \noil production came largely from higher prices, but an increase in \ncocoa output re\ufb02ected expanded area under cultivation and improved \nmanagement. Coffee production recovered from drought in the \nprevious year. \n\nWholesale and retail trade, which accounts for about 12% of \neconomic output, experienced weak sales because a shortage of \nforeign currency disrupted supply. Driven mostly by public investment, \nelectricity, gas, and water grew by 3.0%. Transport, storage, and \ncommunication grew by an estimated 4.0%. \n\nForeign investment in Papua New Guinea (PNG) continued to fall \n\nin 2016, with net foreign assets declining by 11.5% largely because \nconstruction on a lique\ufb01ed natural gas (LNG) project reached \ncompletion. Other factors include a poor investment environment \noutside of mining, a ban on imports of some agricultural products, and \nthe introduction of foreign exchange controls in 2016. \n\nThe slowdown in economic growth and private business dragged \ndown public revenue. The 2016 national budget targeted a de\ufb01cit equal \nto 4.1% of GDP (Figure 3.33.2).

A supplementary \nbudget for 2016, approved in August, sought to remedy the situation by \ncutting expenditure and raising new \ufb01nancing. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is estimated at 7.0% in 2016 (Figure 3.33.3). In the \ufb01rst \n\nquarter of 2016, headline in\ufb02ation accelerated to 6.5% from 6.2% \nin the \ufb01rst quarter of 2015, and this upward trend continued for \nthe rest of the year. Prices rose in all the larger urban centers. \nThe increase in domestic in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ects price rises across domestic \ngoods and services, notably betel nut and mustard up by 33.5%, \nhousing rentals 28.1%, fruit and vegetables 25.5%, hotel accommodation \n18.9%, and medical services 17.0%. \n\nThe Bank of Papua New Guinea, the central bank, continued \nits neutral monetary policy by maintaining its policy interest rate, \ncalled the kina facility rate, at 6.25% throughout the year. Broad money \nsupply expanded by 5.0% in 2016 largely on the continued issuance of \nsecurities to \ufb01nance government expenditure. As a result, net claims \non the government soared by 25.7%. Credit to the private sector rose \nby 3.1%. \n\nThe current account surplus, estimated to equal 9.4% of GDP in \n2016, was down from 13.4% in 2015 as imports increased by 10.2% and \nexports were lower by 6.4% (Figure 3.33.4). The capital and \ufb01nancial \naccount de\ufb01cit was $1.7 billion in 2016. The overall balance of payments \nde\ufb01cit of $121 million was \ufb01nanced using foreign exchange reserves, \nwhich at the end of 2016 stood at $2.2 billion, or cover for 8.8 months \nof imports.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is expected to accelerate to 2.5% in 2017, driven by output \nincreases in mining and agriculture. The Ok Tedi gold and copper mine \nis foreseen returning to full capacity, and the Ramu nickel mine to \n90% capacity. \n\nAgriculture, forestry, and \ufb01shery output is forecast to grow by \n3.6% with increases in both price and production, assuming favorable \nweather. Palm oil production is expected to recover from a slump \ncaused by El Ni\u00f1o in 2015, while prevailing high prices for cocoa should \nadd momentum to the supply response that is bringing new areas into \nproduction. Copra production will continue to increase in response \nto higher prices, while growth in coffee production is set to moderate \nin 2017 following a bumper season in 2016. \n\nA gradual pickup in the global economy can be expected to boost \ncommodity prices and stimulate activity in sectors outside of resource \nextraction. These sectors will likely enjoy further support from \nspending related to elections in June and July 2017, preparations for \nthe 2018 Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation Leaders\u2019 Meeting, and \ncontinued government investment in infrastructure. \n\nEconomic growth is expected to be 2.8% in 2018, still supported \n\nmostly by agriculture and mining. \n\n3.33.3\u2002Inflation\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\n2017 2018\nForecast\n\nEstimate\n\nSources: Bank of Papua New Guinea; Papua New Guinea \n2016 National Budget; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.33.4\u2002 Trade performance and \ncurrent account balance\n\nCurrent account balance\n\nImport growth\nExport growth\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\nEstimate\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund Article IV \nstaff reports, various years; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n%\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n\u201325\n\n\u201350\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002271\n\n3.33.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2.5\n\n7.5\n\n7.7\n\n2.8\n\n7.5\n\n6.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nUncertainties about global and domestic policy pose large risks \n\nto the forecast. An aggressive \ufb01scal stance in the US could cause \ninterest rates to surge, thereby increasing the cost of borrowing for \nthe government and the private sector in PNG. The adoption of a \nmore restrictive trade regime in the US could slow global trade and \nthus reduce demand for PNG exports. Given the importance of exports \nto the economy, any exogenous shock would have adverse effects on \nthe whole economy, which has yet to recover fully from the recent \ndownturn in commodity prices. \n\nThe government\u2019s plan to return to a balanced budget over the \nmedium term is helping to rebuild the \ufb01scal position necessary to \nabsorb external shocks, and its focus on making public expenditure \nmore effective promises better use of public resources. For 2017, the \ngovernment targets a de\ufb01cit equal to 2.5% of GDP, with revenue \nexpected at $4.2 billion and expenditure budgeted at $4.6 billion. \nThe government plans to \ufb01nance the de\ufb01cit through domestic and \ninternational borrowing.\n\nThe central bank is expected to continue its neutral monetary \npolicy and leave the kina facility rate unchanged. The foreign exchange \nshortage is likely to persist in 2017 without substantial improvement in \ncommodity prices. The central bank has tried to manage the shortage \nby selectively intervening in currency markets. The foreign exchange \ntrading band continues to determine the speed of kina depreciation. \nIn the absence of a freely \ufb02oating kina, the economy may prove to \nbe unable to absorb an exogenous shock. Such a shock could force a \ndisorderly switch to a free \ufb02oat.\n\nThere are also important political risks to the forecast. \n\nDelays in royalty payments to landowners at LNG production sites \ncould destabilize outputs. Reports suggest growing discontent \namong landowners. In December 2016, the government mobilized \nsecurity forces in response to violence at production sites. How \nthis issue is handled could affect other projects in the pipeline and \nsubstantially compromise growth. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is projected to accelerate to 7.5% in 2017 and 2018. \n\nImported in\ufb02ation is expected to rise with kina depreciation and recent \nincreases in global oil prices. Further, spending related to the elections \nin 2017 and the hosting of the Asia-Paci\ufb01c Economic Cooperation \nLeaders\u2019 Meeting will probably intensify in\ufb02ationary pressures. \nHowever, these pressures will likely subside as the government \ncontinues along the path of \ufb01scal consolidation. \n\nThe current account is projected to record a surplus of $1.4 billion \nin 2017, equal to 7.7% of GDP. This re\ufb02ects increased output from the \nOk Tedi and Ramu mines and increased exports of agricultural products \nin response to higher world food prices.\n\nThe current account balance is forecast to remain in surplus \nequivalent to 6.7% of GDP in 2018, buoyed by continued gas and gas \ncondensate production and further increases in agriculture exports, \nparticularly coffee, cocoa, and palm oil. These in\ufb02ows are expected to be \noffset somewhat by large out\ufb02ows in the income and \ufb01nancial balances \nto cover dividend payments to overseas investors.\n\n\f272\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014an effective medium-term \n\ufb01scal strategy \nPNG was able to withstand the global \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 but \nwas severely affected by the global commodities downturn in 2014\u20132015. \nWhile the nature of the two shocks differed, \ufb01scal and monetary stances \npreceding them provide important lessons. PNG had built \ufb01scal buffers \nand reduced public debt in the years preceding the global \ufb01nancial crisis. \nHowever, an expansionary \ufb01scal stance starting 2012 and the rapid \ndepletion of \ufb01scal and monetary reserves forced a sharp, unplanned \nadjustment during the commodities downturn.\n\nThe government is developing a new medium-term \ufb01scal strategy \nfor 2018\u20132022 to replace the current strategy, which expires this year. \nA credible and sound strategy will be important to reinforce the ability \nof PNG to respond to external shocks, rebuild \ufb01scal buffers, and make \npublic expenditure more effective. Institutions necessary to mitigate \nexogenous shocks, in particular a well-functioning sovereign wealth \nfund, are urgently needed. PNG must meet four imperatives.\n\nThe \ufb01rst imperative is to rebuild \ufb01scal buffers to restore \ufb01scal \nresilience under external shocks. For instance, \ufb01scal guidelines should \ninclude a de\ufb01cit target stated as a percentage of non-mining GDP. \nThe medium-term \ufb01scal strategy for 2008\u20132012 included prudent limits \non the use of mineral revenues. The strategy estimated mineral revenue \nat the time to equal about 4% of GDP and therefore targeted a de\ufb01cit \nfor the non-mineral budget at the same 4% of GDP. Further, a 70:30 \nratio governed the use of mineral revenue, with 70% earmarked for \ninvestment and 30% for repaying public debt. At the end of 2012, public \ndebt had been retired to the equivalent of 19.1% of GDP from 31.4% in \n2008 and 63.6% in 2002. These guidelines were subsequently relaxed, \nand the budget de\ufb01cit was allowed to rise sharply on the expectation of \nwindfall revenue (Figure 3.33.5). This made PNG less able to absorb the \nexogenous shock from sharply worse terms of trade experienced in 2015. \nTo avoid a repeat of this scenario, it is important that the new medium-\nterm \ufb01scal strategy include strong guidelines to rebuild the \ufb01scal buffer. \n\nSecond, the agenda for public \ufb01nance reform should include \n\ngetting greater value for money from public expenditure. Expenditure \nfor health, for example, was equivalent to about 4% of GDP in 2013, \nwell above the 1.6% average in lower-middle-income economies, but \nPNG has struggled to translate high public expenditure into improved \nsocial and economic outcomes. Female life expectancy at birth in PNG \nis 64 years, well below the lower-middle-income average of 69 years. \nHigh operating costs in a vast interior with a sparse population make \ncost-effective service delivery difficult. This constraint is exacerbated by \ninstitutional fragmentation and overlapping responsibilities for service \ndelivery to the poor. The upshot is that public \ufb01nance does not reach \nfrontline service providers in an efficient and timely way.\n\nThird, PNG should strengthen revenue collection and domestic \n\nresource mobilization. The bulk of expected annual revenue does \nnot materialize until halfway into the year, which undermines \nexpenditure effectiveness. This complicates cash-\ufb02ow management, \nand the problem is magni\ufb01ed when a revenue shortfall occurs due to \n\n3.33.5\u2002Public debt\n\nExternal\nDomestic\n\nK billion\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nTotal\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nEstimate Forecast\n\nSources: National budget documents, various years; \nInternational Monetary Fund Article IV staff reports, \nvarious years; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nPapua New Guinea\u2002\u2002273\n\ncyclical factors such as commodity price swings or extreme weather. \nThe situation is further complicated when the government invests in \nlarge infrastructure projects with cash needs that vary from one quarter \nto the next because of factors that are difficult to accurately forecast. \nSuch issues are not very consequential when revenue collection outpaces \nexpenditure, but the reverse situation suddenly applies the brakes, \ndelaying investments needed for medium-term development.\n\nFourth, structural reform is needed to attract more private \ninvestment and participation in services. Service delivery in PNG is \nlargely binary, public or private. A multi-institutional approach that \nleverages complementarity market, public, and civic solutions has a \nbetter chance of delivering lasting results. Public policy is to pursue such \nsolutions through national development plans, but the operationalization \nof this policy needs further support. Many private companies and other \nnongovernment agencies in remote areas are involved in providing \nbasic services. Strengthening and scaling up these services should be a \npolicy priority. Finally, the challenge for public policy, particularly from \nthe perspective of social equity, is to deliver such essentials as books, \npencils, and medicine effectively in remote places where instant noodles \nand chocolates have already found markets.\n\n\fSolomon Islands\n\nAlthough economic growth is broadly steady, it relies on expansionary fiscal policy and unsustainable \nlogging. Growth is likely to slow as their short-term benefits dissipate. Taking a longer view, tourism \nhas  potential  as  an  untapped  source  of  economic  growth.  Steady  progress  is  being  made  in \nimplementing  a  national  tourism  development  strategy,  but  significant  impediments  remain.\n\nEconomic performance \nEconomic growth accelerated modestly to an estimated 3.2% in 2016 \nfrom 2.9% in 2015 (Figure 3.34.1). The government maintained its \nstrategy of supporting growth through \ufb01scal expansion. Aggressive \nlogging also added signi\ufb01cantly to growth as the industry continued \nto stave off expectations of eventual decline. Logging exports rose by \n12.7% in 2016 to reach an annual record of 2.6 million cubic meters \n(Figure 3.34.2). \n\nExports of other commodities were mixed as \ufb01shery, cocoa, and \nmineral exports all contracted in volume terms while palm oil exports \nrose. Meanwhile, the pace of private investment appears to have slowed, \nwith growth in credit to the private sector decelerating slightly, imports \nof capital goods falling, and construction softening. \n\nThe government continued to pursue an expansionary budget, \ntaking advantage of signi\ufb01cant \ufb01scal reserves built up under repeated \nbudget surpluses in the past. In 2016, the budget recorded a sizeable \nde\ufb01cit, equal to 5.9% of GDP, as the government maintained high \nexpenditures even as lower \ufb01shery revenue and external grant receipts \ndragged down total revenues. To \ufb01nance the de\ufb01cit, the government \ndrew down its cash reserves held at the Central Bank of Solomon \nIslands, signi\ufb01cantly eroding them to less than 1 month of cover for \nprojected spending. \n\ndecline in consumer prices in 2015 (Figure 3.34.3). In\ufb02ation for \nlocal goods and services was 3.3% but offset by a 2.1% decline in import \nprices, re\ufb02ecting low international commodity prices. Monetary policy \ncontinued to be broadly accommodative as the central bank left the \ncash reserve requirement for commercial banks unchanged at 7.5% of \ndeposits and held steady on its issuance of central bank paper. \n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit almost doubled to the equivalent of \n7.3% of GDP from 3.7% in 2015, mainly because lower grant in\ufb02ows \nfrom development partners more than offset a slightly narrower trade \nde\ufb01cit (Figure 3.34.4).

After 2 years of \ufb01scal expansion, \npolicy is set to tighten. Private investment will likely continue to \nmoderate, and net exports are expected to detract from growth. \nLog export volumes are projected to decline gradually in 2017 and \n2018, but logging has routinely surprised on the upside for many years, \ndefying expectations of eventual decline. Logging therefore poses a \nsigni\ufb01cant risk to the outlook, especially as it accounts for a growing \nshare of exports. Meanwhile, years of unsustainable logging heighten \nthe risk of an eventual collapse that is more rapid and disruptive than \nanticipated. \n\nThe government is targeting a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to 1.2% of GDP, \n\ufb01nanced by further drawdowns on its cash reserves (Figure 3.34.5). \nThe depletion of cash reserves over the past 2 years will limit the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to maintain its policy of high public spending, given \nlegal constraints on borrowing to \ufb01nance recurrent budget de\ufb01cits. \nTo meet its spending targets, the government has budgeted signi\ufb01cantly \nhigher domestic revenue collection, projecting it to increase from the \nequivalent of 35.3% of GDP in 2016 to 39.9% in 2017. The budget provides \nlittle detail on how such an ambitious increase will be achieved. \nThe risks posed by this uncertainty are counterbalanced, however, \nby likely underperformance on the expenditure side as the development \nbudget continues to face implementation difficulties. In addition, \nlow cash reserves may hinder cash-\ufb02ow management and further \nimpede effective budget implementation.\n\nThe central bank is expected to maintain a broadly accommodative \n\nstance. Higher international commodity prices are likely to feed into \nhigher imported in\ufb02ation while local in\ufb02ation is forecast to pick up \nslowly. In\ufb02ation is projected to stay relatively subdued at 1.8% in 2017 \nand 2.2% in 2018. Broad money growth is expected at 8.1%, down from \n9.2% in 2016, as growth in private credit slows modestly and as the \ngovernment draws down cash reserves less than before and therefore \ninjects less liquidity into the system. The current account de\ufb01cit is \nprojected to widen to the equivalent of 8.3% of GDP in 2017 as net \nexports deteriorate amid \ufb02at export earnings and rising import costs, \nand as grant in\ufb02ows from development partners remain subdued. \nIn 2018, the current account de\ufb01cit will likely widen signi\ufb01cantly to \n10.7% of GDP to meet the import needs of planned major infrastructure \nprojects, including the Tina River Hydropower Project.\n\n%\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nTransfers\nIncome\nServices\nTrade\nCurrent account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Central Bank of Solomon Islands; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.34.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n3.0\n\n1.8\n\n2.8\n\n2.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u20138.3\n\n\u201310.7\n\n\f276\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014unlocking tourism potential\nNew economic drivers are urgently needed to replace logging and \nexternal assistance, which are expected to decline over the medium \nterm. Solomon Islands is widely considered to have world class tourism \npotential that remains largely untapped. Diving is currently the main \nattraction, but other attractions with potential include World War II \nhistorical sites, indigenous culture, bird watching, sur\ufb01ng, and \ufb01shing. \nVisitor arrivals have been on an upwards trajectory but from a very \n\nlow base. Arrivals by air rose from 19,440 in 2009 to a peak of 24,431 \nin 2013 (Figure 3.34.6). Severe \ufb02oods in Honiara disrupted tourism in \n2014, and arrivals by air have since hovered at a little over 20,000 a year. \nThis may partly re\ufb02ect substitution in favor of cruise tourism, which \nis growing rapidly. Visitors by sea rose from none officially recorded \nin 2013 to about 3,900 in 2015 and 13,400 in 2016. Contributing to this \nperformance are stepped-up marketing by the Solomon Islands Visitors \nBureau, a perception that public safety has improved somewhat, and \nthe commencement of direct \ufb02ights between Honiara and Sydney, as \nAustralia is the major source market. Yet visitor arrivals remain far \nlower than in other Paci\ufb01c destinations with more developed tourism \ninfrastructure. \n\npotential of Solomon Islands. Most fundamentally, public safety remains \na concern, and key infrastructure lacking beyond Honiara includes \nadequate roads, reliable and affordable domestic air connections, cruise \nship-capable wharves, dependable electricity supply, and modern \ntelecommunications. Tourism is further constrained by regulatory \nissues, in particular the difficulty of acquiring land for tourism \ndevelopment. The marketing of Solomon Islands as an attractive tourism \ndestination remains weak, recent efforts notwithstanding. There are \nno internationally branded or luxury hotels to create awareness and \ninstill trust. The tourism workforce is small and needs professional \ndevelopment. \n\nIn 2015, the government launched its National Tourism Development \n\nStrategy, 2015\u20132019, which aims to develop Solomon Islands as a \nniche destination for small-scale adventure tourism that capitalizes \non unique offerings related to its land, marine, and cultural resources. \nGood progress has been made in implementing the strategy in terms of \nrestructuring the tourism ministry, increasing funding for the visitors \nbureau, instituting reform to support more sustainable \ufb01nancing, \nand creating an online booking portal to support small-scale tourism \noperators.

Public spending was the main driver of growth, rising by \nan estimated 17.7%. Grants from Timor-Leste\u2019s development partners fell \nby an estimated 3.4% and accounted for 11.7% of public spending in 2016, \nwhile government expenditures excluding grants rose by 21.2%.\nThe surge in public spending followed the approval of a \n\nsupplementary budget in June that doubled planned capital investment \nand raised the 2016 budget by 25.0% to $1.95 billion, equal to 129% of \nGDP. Actual capital expenditure rose by 82.2% to $590 million with \nincreased investment in transport infrastructure (Figure 3.35.2). Transfer \npayments, which increased by 6.3%, also contributed to the growth \nof public spending. Transfers to the Special Administrative Region of \nOe-Cusse Ambeno rose by 57.6% to $217 million. Other components of \npublic spending showed a modest decline, with salaries and wages down \nby 2.7% and payments for goods and services 3.7% lower.\n\nThe surge in public investment improved business prospects and \nstrengthened private sector growth, as indicated by business electricity \nconsumption rising by 17.5% year on year in the \ufb01rst half. Manufacturing \nreceived a boost in 2016 as Heineken completed Timor-Leste\u2019s \ufb01rst \nmajor brewery, but the commissioning of a new private port and a \ncement bagging plant was delayed.

The fall in revenue came from both falling \nproduction, down by 6.8% in 2016, and lower oil prices, down by an \naverage of 15.9%. Another factor was the settlement in the \ufb01rst quarter \nof 2016 of four tax disputes between the Government of Timor-Leste \nand ConocoPhillips, the lead operator of the Bayu-Undan oil \ufb01eld. \nThe settlement terms have not been disclosed, but analysis of tax and \nroyalty payments to Australia and Timor-Leste suggests that Timor-\nLeste had to forego $152.4 million in tax revenue in 2016 (Figure 3.35.4). \nLower petroleum tax income was partly balanced on paper by \n\ninvestments of Timor-Leste\u2019s Petroleum Fund that earned $647.7 million \nin 2016. The fund\u2019s equity and bond holdings both outperformed their \nbenchmarks for an overall return on assets of 4.7%, compared with a \nbenchmark yield of 4.0%. The fund maintained its investment strategy \nin 2016, but new procedures for cash management were introduced in \nJune to reduce its exposure to losses from short-term volatility. \n\nAs in previous years, withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund \ufb01nanced \n\nmost public spending. Withdrawals reached $1.24 billion in 2016, \nmore than double the estimated sustainable income of $544.8 million. \nAs a result, the fund balance declined by 2.3% in 2016, ending the year \nwith $15.8 billion of assets, or 10.5 times GDP. The sharp decline in \nincome from oil production and elevated spending on imported goods \nand services was re\ufb02ected in the current account, which went from a \nsurplus equal to 16.4% of GDP in 2015 to a de\ufb01cit estimated at 49.9%.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to slow to 4.0% in 2017 before recovering to \n6.0% in 2018 as major public and private investments move ahead. \nThe implementation of public investments is likely to falter in 2017 as \nattention shifts to national elections in July and the formation of a new \ngovernment. A supplementary budget may be passed immediately after \nthe elections to re\ufb02ect changes in government structure and priorities. \n\nThe 2017 budget includes new appropriations for almost $1.39 billion \n\nin expenditure this year excluding grants from development partners. \nThis is down from an average of $1.63 billion during 2011\u20132016. \nOf the total, $361 million is for capital investment and $1.03 billion for \nrecurrent expenditure.

Allocations for salaries and wages are 14.8% higher in 2017 \nbecause of increases across many ministries. However, setting aside \ntransfers to Oe-Cusse Ambeno, the allocation for recurrent items is 3.9% \nlower than in 2016. Most of the savings have been achieved by allocating \nless for transfers and for goods and services. \n\nThe 2017 budget maintains the growth strategy in force since 2011, \n\nled by public investment. The budget for the autonomously managed \nInfrastructure Fund during 2017\u20132021 is $4.5 billion, or 3 times the \nGDP in 2016. Of this, 80% is allocated to roads and bridges, airports, \nseaports, public buildings, and the Tasi Mane project to develop a \npetrochemical industry on the south coast (Figure 3.35.5). An operations \nand maintenance program has been included in the Infrastructure Fund \nplan for 2017\u20132021 with an initial allocation of $9.6 million in 2017 and \nan average of $9.1 million per annum in 2018\u20132021. Despite the large \ncapital budget, planned investments in water supply and sanitation, \neducation, and health care may not be sufficient to achieve national \ntargets for service delivery. \n\nThe discounted forecast for petroleum revenues during 2017\u20132022 is \n\n44% less than in the 2016 budget, re\ufb02ecting updated oil price forecasts \n(Figure 3.35.6). As a result, the estimated sustainable income from the \nPetroleum Fund has been reduced to $481.6 million, well below the \n$787.0 million peak in 2013. Projections for domestic revenue growth \nhave been lifted, re\ufb02ecting strong collections in 2016 and the expected \nimpact of \ufb01scal reform. Non-oil revenues are now projected to rise to \n$247.9 million by 2020, compared with a forecast of $210.3 million in the \n2016 budget (Figure 3.35.7). \n\nWith revenues from oil and gas production in steep decline, \nthe current account position is increasingly determined by income \nfrom Petroleum Fund investments and the magnitude of de\ufb01cits in \nmerchandise and services trade. The current account de\ufb01cit is projected \nto narrow to 12.2% of GDP in 2017 as the trade de\ufb01cit shrinks with \nlower government spending. \n\nA current account de\ufb01cit equal to 40.2% of GDP is forecast for 2018 \n\nas the trade de\ufb01cit widens and income from petroleum production \ndeclines further. In the absence of new oil and gas developments \nor substantial \ufb01scal consolidation, Timor-Leste is likely to see \nwidening \ufb01scal and current account de\ufb01cits and a steady drawdown of \nPetroleum Fund assets in the years after 2018. \n\nIn January 2017, Timor-Leste and Australia announced their shared \nintention to negotiate a permanent maritime boundary between the two \ncountries by September 2017. The termination of their revenue-sharing \nagreement and demarcation of a permanent border in the Timor Sea \ncould clarify ownership of the Greater Sunrise oil \ufb01eld and pave the way \nfor its development. This would not affect government revenues during \nthe forecast period but could make \ufb01scal consolidation less urgent. \n\nConsumer prices are expected to increase in 2017 and 2018 with \n\nprivate business picking up and higher international food and fuel \nprices. Consumer price in\ufb02ation is forecast at 1.2% in 2017, rising to \n3.0% in 2018 as international food prices continue to rise and increased \ninvestment stimulates demand. \n\n3.35.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n4.0\n\n1.2\n\n6.0\n\n3.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u201312.2\n\n\u201340.2\n\n3.35.6\u2002 Petroleum revenues\n\nActual\n2015 budget\n2016 budget\n2017 budget\n\n$ billion\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2002\n\n2006\n\n2010\n\n2014\n\n2022\n\n2018\nForecast\n\nSource: Timor-Leste national budget documents, \nvarious years.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.35 7\u2002Domestic revenues\n\nActual\n2014 budget\n2015 budget\n2016 budget\n2017 budget\n\n$ million\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2009 2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2021\n\n2019\nForecast\n\nSource: Timor-Leste national budget documents, \nvarious years.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f280\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nThe outlook for private investment is positive during 2017 and 2018 \nwith the Heineken brewery set to expand its operations in 2017 and the \nTibar Bay port likely to garner the approvals necessary to commence \nconstruction in the second half of the year. Elections are a wild card \nin 2017, and \ufb01nal decisions could slip to 2018 regarding the development \nof the cement factory in Baucau and two large tourism investments \nnear Dili. \n\nThe \ufb01nalization of a range of legislative reforms could stimulate \n\nprivate investment and business activity. In February 2017, the \nNational Parliament approved a package of land laws that provides \nthe \ufb01rst clear framework for regulating landownership and resolving \ncompeting historical claims since Timor-Leste achieved independence \nin 2002. Other notable reforms targeted for completion before the \n2017 elections are a new mining code, investment law, and framework \nfor secured lending.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014managing the decentralization \nof service delivery\nThe decentralization program that began with establishment of the \nSpecial Administrative Region of Oe-Cusse Ambeno in 2014 is set to \nexpand in 2017. The government approved in 2016 a new law de\ufb01ning the \nstructures, roles, and responsibilities of new municipal authorities in the \nfour largest municipalities\u2014Baucau, Bobonaro, Dili, and Ermera\u2014and \nnew municipal administrations in the remaining eight municipalities. \n\nThe new law provides a framework for administrative \n\ndecentralization and assigns signi\ufb01cant responsibilities for health, \neducation, public works, and other public services to the new municipal \nbodies. The law empowers central government agencies to delegate \nadditional functions to subnational administrations and authorities.\n\nTimor-Leste can bene\ufb01t from the lessons learned in other countries \n\nas it moves forward with its own decentralization. While the legal \nframework has now been established, many details still need to be \nworked out. It will be important to ensure that the transfer of functions \nto subnational governments aligns with capacity in the new municipal \nbodies, which is currently limited, and that funding allocations from the \ncentral government are consistent with their service delivery mandates. \n\nFiscal policy is one area where further analysis is needed. \nAnalysis of data from the 2014 Survey of National Living Standards \nand the 2015 census highlight signi\ufb01cant regional variation in poverty \nrates and other human development indicators (Figure 3.35.8). While \na number of government programs target poverty, current patterns of \nsubnational spending do not re\ufb02ect regional differences in poverty rates \n(Figure 3.35.9 and Figure 3.35.10). \n\nDecentralization will better promote equity if \ufb01scal rules provide \n\na clear and objective framework for aligning funding allocations to \nregional variations in poverty, human development, and the cost of \nservice delivery. It may also provide scope to incentivize service delivery \nby delegating selected revenue collection functions to subnational \ngovernments and establishing revenue-sharing arrangements.\n\n$ million\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n3.35.8\u2002 Births attended by \nhealth professionals\n\n% of births\n\nNational average\n\nu\ne\n\nl\ni\n\nA\n\no\nr\na\nn\nA\n\ni\n\nu\na\nc\nu\na\nB\n\no\nr\na\nn\no\nb\no\nB\n\na\nm\n\ni\nl\n\na\nv\no\nC\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nD\n\na\nr\ne\nm\nr\nE\n\nm\ne\nt\nu\na\nL\n\ni\n\na\nc\nu\nq\nL\n\ni\n\no\nt\nu\nt\na\nn\na\nM\n\ni\n\nh\na\nf\nu\nn\na\nM\n\ne\ns\ns\nu\nc\ne\nO\n\ne\nu\nq\ne\nu\nq\nV\n\ni\n\nSource: Timor-Leste Population and Housing Census 2015.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.35.9\u2002Municipal budget allocations\n\nBudget allocation\n\nBudget per capita\n\n$\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nu\ne\n\nl\ni\n\nA\n\no\nr\na\nn\nA\n\ni\n\nu\na\nc\nu\na\nB\n\no\nr\na\nn\no\nb\no\nB\n\na\nm\n\ni\nl\n\na\nv\no\nC\n\ni\nl\ni\n\nD\n\na\nr\ne\nm\nr\nE\n\nm\ne\nt\nu\na\nL\n\ni\n\na\nc\nu\nq\nL\n\ni\n\no\nt\nu\nt\na\nn\na\nM\n\ni\n\nh\na\nf\nu\nn\na\nM\n\ne\nu\nq\ne\nu\nq\nV\n\ni\n\nSources: Timor-Leste State Budget, 2017; Timor-Leste \nPopulation and Housing Census 2015.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.35.10\u2002 Municipal budget allocations \n\nand poverty rates\n\nMunicipal budget ($ per capita)\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nPoverty rate in 2014 (%)\n\nSources: Timor-Leste State Budget 2017; Poverty in  \nTimor-Leste, 2014.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fVanuatu\n\nThe  economy  is  recovering  after  several  shocks  over  the  past  2  years,  not  least  a  devastating \ncyclone  in  2015.  Growth  is  driven  by  ongoing  recovery  in  tourism  and  agriculture,  cyclone \nreconstruction,  and  new  infrastructure  investment.  However,  the  improved  outlook  faces  risks \nfrom  rising  public  debt  and  a  legacy  of  policy  inaction  in  key  areas.

Reconstruction following the cyclone reinforced growth, \nas did the initiation of several large infrastructure projects.\n\nGrowth in export volumes for agricultural commodities was uneven, \n\nas cyclone damage and a long drought caused by El Ni\u00f1o continued \nto weigh on production into 2016. However, the value of exports of \nkava, cocoa, and copra rose signi\ufb01cantly (Figure 3.36.2). This saw \ntotal export earnings increase by an estimated 28.2% in 2016, clawing \nback much of the 30.3% decline in 2015. External demand for kava \nincreased, especially after restrictions eased in Europe and after Fiji \nwas hit by Tropical Cyclone Winston. However, volumes for such export \ncommodities as coconut oil, coffee, and beef continued to contract \nunder the enduring impact of recent natural shocks and, in some cases, \nstructural decline. \n\nto international air services set back recovery following the cyclone. \nIn January, two major airlines in the region, Air New Zealand and \nVirgin Australia, stopped \ufb02ying to Port Vila over concern about the \nsafety of the runway at Bauer\ufb01eld International Airport. Qantas, a \nthird major carrier, ended its codeshare agreement with government-\nowned Air Vanuatu. The government successfully completed emergency \nrepairs by May, but only Virgin Australia resumed services. Visitors by \nair recovered by 5.7% in 2016 but remain 12.6% fewer than in 2014. \nBy contrast, cruise ship arrivals rose by an estimated 28.9% in 2016, \noutperforming 2014 by 15.6% (Figure 3.36.3). \n\nGovernment spending, including activities \ufb01nanced by development \n\npartners, delivered a major stimulus but resulted in a budget de\ufb01cit \nequal to an estimated 10.6% of GDP, reversing a 6.4% surplus in 2015. \nThe de\ufb01cit \ufb01nanced the initiation of major cyclone reconstruction \nand infrastructure projects, with considerable help from development \npartners. \n\nThis chapter was written by Roland Rajah of the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and Coordination Office, \nADB, Sydney; and Nancy Wells of the Vanuatu Extended Mission, ADB, Port Vila.\n\n%\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nKava\nCopra\nCoconut oil\nBeef\nCocoa\nOthers\n\nVt billion\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Vanuatu National Statistics Office.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fThe Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, the central bank, has kept monetary \n\n3.36.3\u2002Visitor arrivals by mode of travel\n\n282\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nsettings unchanged since raising the policy rate by 100 basis points \nin March 2016 as it sought to gradually wind down policy support \nto the banking system introduced following Tropical Cyclone Pam. \nIn\ufb02ation decelerated to 0.9% from 2.5% in 2015 (Figure 3.36.4). \nSlower in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ected low international commodity prices and \nbase effects from the spike in consumer prices in the immediate \naftermath of the cyclone. The current account de\ufb01cit widened to the \nequivalent of 13.8% of GDP from 9.2% in 2015, re\ufb02ecting a drop in \ngrants for emergency cyclone response and recovery, as well as higher \nimports to supply heightened construction activity (Figure 3.36.5). \nThe 2016 de\ufb01cit was well \ufb01nanced by development partners funding \nconstruction projects.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to pick up to 4.3% in 2017 on continued recovery \nin agriculture and tourism and as the implementation of major \nreconstruction and infrastructure projects continues to ramp up. \nIt is seen to slow slightly to 3.8% in 2018 as construction peaks and the \nrecovery in agriculture and tourism plays out. Government plans for \na signi\ufb01cant infrastructure push are expected to drive medium-term \ngrowth prospects, with the total investment pipeline during 2016\u20132020 \namounting to almost half of annual GDP. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is seen to remain subdued, though rising international \ncommodity prices and heightened construction are expected to push it \nto 2.4% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018. Higher imports for construction and \nhigher international prices will likely widen the current account de\ufb01cit \nto 17.7% of GDP in 2017, but it should be \ufb01nanced by in\ufb02ows of external \ndevelopment assistance. The central bank is thus expected to maintain a \nbroadly accommodative stance even as it continues to gradually tighten \npolicy in line with economic recovery and rising in\ufb02ation.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, Vanuatu\u2019s economy faces acute risks \nfrom a legacy of policy inaction in several areas. Notable are de\ufb01ciencies \nin meeting international standards for combatting money laundering \nand the \ufb01nancing of terrorism and in safeguarding the safety of vital \ninternational air and maritime transport links. Progress is being made \nin all these areas and needs to be pursued diligently to keep risks from \nbecoming eventualities that could derail Vanuatu\u2019s continued recovery. \n\nRapid increases in public debt are another concern. The government \n\nexpects to incur a consolidated \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit in 2017 equal to 16.9% of \nGDP. The de\ufb01cit is currently being \ufb01nanced by the development partners \nthat support the major infrastructure projects that drive the de\ufb01cit \n(Figure 3.36.6). However, as the infrastructure push continues, external \ndebt could reach over 50% of GDP by 2020, leaving Vanuatu increasingly \nvulnerable to shocks, including natural disasters. \n\nContaining external debt will be essential, but equally critical will \nbe ensuring that much-needed infrastructure investment is not crowded \nout by lower-quality expenditure. This places a premium on strong \n\ufb01scal discipline regarding the recurrent budget, through expenditure \nprioritization and the mobilization of additional domestic revenue. \n\nAir\nCruise ship\n\nAir\nCruise ship\n\nThousands\n\n% change\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSource: Vanuatu National Statistics Office.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n\u2013200\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n3.36.4\u2002 Inflation\n\nHeadline\nFood\nTransport\nUtilities\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.36.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n4.3\n\n2.4\n\n3.8\n\n2.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u201317.7\n\n\u201315.0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nVanuatu\u2002\u2002283\n\nThe government is consulting with the community on the introduction \nof personal and corporate income taxes, which if introduced would be \na \ufb01rst in the history of Vanuatu.

The plan sets \nout a vision for a \u201cstable, sustainable, and prosperous Vanuatu.\u201d \nEconomic growth that is higher yet sustainable will be critical to \ndelivering on the ambitions of Vanuatu 2030. The infrastructure push \ncurrently under way is the main growth catalyst so far pursued by the \ngovernment. While the infrastructure is sorely needed, it alone will be \ninsufficient to deliver the required lift to growth. \n\nLimited capacity for managing public investments risks undermining \n\nthe bene\ufb01ts of the infrastructure push. The current investment \npipeline amounts to over Vt10 billion each year in 2017 and 2018, \nequal to more than 12% of GDP. By comparison, the average annual \nvalue of public investment projects implemented during 2008\u20132010, \nthe most recent previous peak in public investment, amounted to only \nVt3.5 billion, not much more than 5% of GDP. The sudden scaling up \ncould overwhelm limited project implementation capacity. Meanwhile, \ninadequate infrastructure planning could skew project selection, and \nthe historical pattern of inadequate attention to maintenance threatens \nto undermine return on investment. There is a need to review the \ninstitutional structures for infrastructure management, including the \nrole of the Vanuatu Project Management Unit, which manages, under \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Office, all projects valued at $10 million or more.\n\nA further concern is the need for complementary reform to enhance \nproductivity and support growth led by the private sector. Productivity \ngrowth has been deteriorating in recent years, by an average estimated \nat 1.5% during 2010\u20132014. Insufficient progress in implementing reform \ndesigned to enhance private sector development and productivity \nappears to be the key issue. Private investment in Vanuatu was relatively \nhigh in recent years, estimated at the equivalent of 28.0% of GDP \nduring 2010\u20132014, but it did not translate into commensurate dividends \nin terms of economic growth. \n\nIn the absence of productivity-enhancing reform, Vanuatu\u2019s \nmedium-term growth prospects will be constrained to 3.7% annually \nto 2020, delivering per capita growth of only 1.5% annually despite \nthe planned massive increase in infrastructure investment. Moreover, \ngrowth is likely to slow thereafter because it will be difficult for the \ngovernment to sustain the current high rate of public investment. \nProductivity-enhancing reform will therefore be critical to delivering a \nmore prosperous Vanuatu by 2030.\n\n\fNorth Paci\ufb01c economies\n\nGrowth  in  the  North  Pacific  was  modest  in  2016.  Delayed  implementation  of  public  investments \nslowed growth in the Federated States of Micronesia. Despite a steep drop in tourist arrivals, Palau \ncontinued to grow, supported by election-related spending. Stagnation persisted in the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands. While rapidly rising revenue from fishing license fees has generated structural \nfiscal  surpluses,  medium-term  fiscal  challenges  remain. \n\nEconomic performance \nThe economy of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is estimated \nto have grown by 3.0% in FY2016 (ended 30 September 2016), driven by \n\ufb01sheries, retail trade, and manufacturing, notably newly operating water \nbottling plants (Figure 3.37.1). Although infrastructure grants under the \nFSM Compact of Free Association with the US became available after \nthe update of its Infrastructure Development Plan in FY2015, project \nimplementation has been constrained by limited capacity in the national \nand state governments. De\ufb02ation deepened slightly in FY2016 to an \nestimated 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous \ufb01scal year with lower prices \nfor fuel imports and electricity. The national government and four state \ngovernments have recorded combined \ufb01scal surpluses since FY2012 \nthanks to soaring revenues from \ufb01shing license fees. In FY2016, this \nconsolidated \ufb01scal surplus equaled 11.0% of GDP. High \ufb01shing license \nfees also helped the current account record a surplus equal to 6.0% of \nGDP in FY2016, as did cheaper fuel and food imports.\n\nThe Palau economy is estimated to have grown by 2.2% in FY2016 \n\ndespite a signi\ufb01cant drop in tourism (Figure 3.37.2). Visitor arrivals fell \nby 11.7%, mainly re\ufb02ecting a 21.2% drop in visitors from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (Figure 3.37.3) due to reduced charter \ufb02ights and \nwidespread trip cancellation during the drought in early 2016. However, \nbecause this segment of the tourist market spends relatively little, \nthe sharp drop in arrivals did not push the economy into contraction. \nElection-related spending supported the economy. Stable food prices \nand lower fuel prices brought about de\ufb02ation of 1.3% in FY2016 despite \ntax increases for tobacco products. The \ufb01scal balance recorded a \nsurplus equal to 2.0% of GDP, down from 4.8% in FY2015 because of \nslower economic growth and a rising wage bill adjusted for the cost \nof living. The current account has been in de\ufb01cit in most recent years \nwith de\ufb01cits in goods trade more than offsetting large surpluses in \ntrade in services and in the primary and secondary income accounts, \nwhich are buoyed by \ufb01shing license fees, official development assistance, \nand remittances to households.

Re\ufb02ecting lower \ninternational fuel prices and stable food prices, the Marshall Islands \nexperienced de\ufb02ation for the second successive year. The consumer \nprice index declined by 1.3% in FY2016. Despite a 26% increase in \nexpenditure, the FY2016 \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit was able to remain at around 2.0% \nof GDP thanks to a soaring \ufb01shing license fees. Subsidies to state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) are estimated to have reached $11.5 million in FY2015, \nequivalent to 6.2% of GDP or 11.5% of total government expenditure in \nthat year, and considerably more than government capital spending of \n$7.4 million (Figure 3.37.5). Lower imports and surging revenues from \n\ufb01shing license fees have left a current account surplus since FY2015, \nwhich in FY2016 is estimated to have reached 16.0% of GDP.\n\nEconomic prospects \nThe FSM economy is expected to grow by 2.5% in both FY2017 and \nFY2018. The national government amended legislation in FY2016 \nto transfer responsibility for project implementation to the states. \nWhile grants are expected to increase in the coming years, public \ninvestments will grow only gradually because of states\u2019 limited capacity \nto implement projects. In\ufb02ation is expected to remain low at 1.5% in \nFY2017 and 2.0% in FY2018, re\ufb02ecting minor increases in global food and \nfuel prices. The strong \ufb01scal performance of the national government is \nexpected to continue, generating \ufb01scal surpluses equal to 10% of GDP in \nthe next 2 years. Current account surpluses are seen to shrink to 4.5% of \nGDP in both years because of higher global fuel prices.\n\nPalau is expected to grow by 3.0% in FY2017 and 5.5% in FY2018, \nsupported by a rebound in tourist arrivals, private investment in new \nresort hotels, and public investments in water supply and sanitation \nsupported by development partners. On the demand side, growth will be \nboosted by capital formation, both public and private. In\ufb02ation is expected \nto remain low at 1.5% in FY2017 and 2.0% in FY2018 as global food and \nfuel prices rise modestly. The \ufb01scal situation will likely turn around with \nthe expected recovery in visitor arrivals and higher revenue generated \nby a doubling of the departure tax in FY2017 from $50 to $100. The \ufb01scal \nsurplus in FY2017 and FY2018 is expected to reach the equivalent of 4.0% \nof GDP with the forecast economic recovery. Current account de\ufb01cits are \nexpected to widen to 12.5% of GDP in FY2017 and 15.0% in FY2018 as \nimports of construction materials increase for tourism ventures and for \ninfrastructure projects funded by development partners, and despite an \nincrease of tourism receipts and stable fuel imports. These de\ufb01cits will be \n\ufb01nanced with capital grants and in\ufb02ows of foreign direct investment.\nThe Marshall Islands economy is projected to accelerate to 4.0% \ngrowth in FY2017 because of public investments funded by development \npartners and infrastructure grants connected with its Compact of Free \nAssociation with the US.

In\ufb02ation \nis projected to remain at 1.5% in FY2017 and FY2018 for the same \nreasons as in the FSM and Palau. Despite an anticipated increase in \nrevenues from \ufb01shing license fees, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is projected to stay \nat 2.0% of GDP because of slow implementation of SOE reform. Despite \nhigher \ufb01shing license revenue, the current account surplus will narrow \nsharply to the equivalent of 4.0% of GDP in FY2017 because of expected \nincreases in imports of construction materials and fuel for public \ninvestments. Then it will recover slightly to 4.5% in FY2018. \n\nWhile geographic disadvantages will probably continue to limit \nhopes for economic diversi\ufb01cation, adjustments are needed to spur \ngrowth and create jobs. Workers continue to leave the North Paci\ufb01c \neconomies to seek jobs abroad, even as jobs at home are \ufb01lled by foreign \nworkers. With proper matching of skills, jobs could be the key channel \nfor distributing the bene\ufb01ts of economic growth to local people.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014ensuring \ufb01scal sustainability\nThe planned cessation of compact grants in FY2023 makes \ufb01scal \nsustainability over the medium term a key policy challenge for the FSM. \nIn the past few years, the government has prudently saved a portion of \nits \ufb01scal surpluses in the FSM Trust Fund. However, this fund can offset \nonly part of the shortfall projected for the Compact Trust Fund, which \nis intended to generate replacement income for expiring compact grants. \nSince tax and tax administration reforms were repealed in FY2015, \nthe ratio of tax receipts to GDP has languished at around 12% of GDP, \none of the lowest ratios in the Paci\ufb01c (Figure 3.37.6).\n\nChallenges created by the rapid growth in tourist arrivals \n\nin Palau have con\ufb01rmed that capacity constraints limit the extent to \nwhich it can depend on low-value package tourism. Restrictions on \ncharter \ufb02ights forced down tourist arrivals and temporarily allowed \nmounting environmental concerns to be addressed. The future is \nunclear. Despite a strong desire to shift toward high-end tourism, \nweak coordination between government bodies and with the private \nsector continues to prevent the emergence of coherent policies and \nconcerted efforts. Palau needs to establish a clear and shared vision \ntoward high-end tourism. The lack of a long-term development strategy \nis re\ufb02ected in the composition of public spending. Even with \ufb01scal \nbalances in surplus since FY2011, public investments declined to the \nequivalent of 4.4% of GDP in FY2013\u2013FY2015, less than half of the \naverage of 9.2% maintained in FY2000\u2013FY2012 (Figure 3.37.7). \n\nIn the RMI, poorly performing SOEs and social security liabilities \n\ncontinue to pose the major \ufb01scal risks. Subsidies remain high for \ninefficient SOEs and to support social welfare in communities on outer \nislands and atolls. The SOE Act, approved in FY2015, has been amended \nto allow more public officials\u2014politicians, ministers, and government \nofficials\u2014on SOE boards. This is done at the risk of continued political \nintervention in SOE management. An actuarial valuation in 2014 \nidenti\ufb01ed unfunded liabilities in the Social Security Fund amounting to \n$228 million, equal to 122% of FY2014 GDP. Under the current system, \nthe fund is expected to be depleted by FY2021.\n\n3.37.5\u2002 Subsidies to state-owned enterprises \nversus capital spending in the \nMarshall islands\n\nSubsidies to state-owned enterprises\nCapital spending\n\n% of GDP\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nMarshall Islands FY2015 Economic Review.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.6\u2002 Ratio of tax to GDP\n\nFederated States\nof Micronesia\n\nPalau\n\nMarshall Islands\n\nNote: Data are for FY2015 (ended 30 September 2015).\nSources: ADB estimates based on the Federated States \nof Micronesia FY2015 Economic Review, October 2016; \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands FY2015 Economic Review, \nOctober 2016; Republic of Palau FY2015 Economic Review, \nAugust 2016.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.37.7\u2002 Fiscal balance and capital spending \n\nin Palau\n\nCapital spending\nOperating balance\nOverall balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of the \nsame calendar year.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nPalau FY2015 Economic Review.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\fSouth Paci\ufb01c economies\n\nThe  South  Pacific  economies  of  the  Cook  Islands,  Samoa,  and  Tonga  grew  robustly  in  2016  on \nstrong  agriculture  and  tourism  and,  in  Samoa  and  Tonga,  the  implementation  of  infrastructure \nprojects financed by development partners. Growth is projected to moderate in all three economies \nin  the  near  term.  A  major  policy  challenge  is  to  maintain  prudent  macroeconomic  management \nagainst  rising  risks  from  economic  and  climatic  shocks.\n\nEconomic performance \nThe Cook Islands economy grew by 5.5% in FY2016 (ended 30 June 2016) \n(Figure 3.38.1), supported by public investment and an 11.0% increase \nin visitor arrivals (Figure 3.38.2). The higher visitor numbers boosted \nperformance in tourism-related retail trade, which grew by 9.8%, \nand in hotels and restaurants, which expanded by 14.2%. Transport \nand communications realized growth at 13.4%, helped along by low \ninternational fuel prices. \n\nSamoa\u2019s economy grew by 6.6% in FY2016, driven by a 41.0% increase \n\nin \ufb01sheries and a 9.4% increase in visitor arrivals. High growth in the \nrelatively small \ufb01shery sector was the result of a new \ufb01shing operation \nthat saw a \ufb02eet of 22 \ufb01shing vessels relocating to Samoa, their catch \nprocessed in Apia for export. Hotels and restaurants grew by 36.9% \non higher visitor spending despite slower growth in visitor arrivals. \nStrong tourism and low fuel prices contributed to 21.9% growth in \ntransport during the year. Construction and the manufacturing of food \nand beverages also grew strongly. \n\nTonga\u2019s economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in FY2016, led by \nrecovery in agriculture and construction, as well as strong private \ndemand. This continues a trend since FY2013 of growth supported by \npost-disaster reconstruction, improved tourism, and strong recovery in \nremittances and private sector lending. \n\nIn the Cook Islands, prices declined by 0.1% on average, reversing \n3.0% in\ufb02ation in FY2015 as lower international fuel prices cut costs in \ntransport and utilities (Figure 3.38.3). Prices rose in Samoa and Tonga \non domestic factors. Electricity tariff adjustments saw annual average \nin\ufb02ation at 0.1% in Samoa. In\ufb02ation in Tonga reversed from 1.0% \nde\ufb02ation in FY2015 to 2.0% in FY2016, accelerating on higher prices \nfor locally produced food following Cyclone Winston in February 2016, \nhigher customs duties on imported food products, and increased \nconstruction, primarily on the International Dateline Hotel, which \nreopened in November 2016, and the St. George Palace office complex. \n\nThis chapter was written by Shiu Raj Singh of the South Paci\ufb01c Subregional Office, ADB, \nSuva; and Cara Tinio and Laisiasa Tora of the Paci\ufb01c Department, ADB, Manila. \n\n3.38.1\u2002GDP growth in the South Pacific\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n\u20134\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; Tonga Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.38.2\u2002Visitor arrivals to the South Pacific\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\nThousand visitors\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; National Reserve Bank of Tonga.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f288\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nThese upward pressures offset declining global food and fuel prices. \nIn\ufb02ation remains well below the reference range of 6%\u20138% set by the \nNational Reserve Bank of Tonga.\n\nThe Cook Islands habitually realizes current account surpluses \ngenerated by its large tourism services trade surplus, which offsets \nchronic de\ufb01cits in merchandise trade and investment income. In FY2016, \nthe current account surplus increased to the equivalent of 20.3% of GDP \nfrom 18.8% in FY2015 because of lower service imports and higher \ufb01sh \nexports (Figure 3.38.4). In Samoa, the current account de\ufb01cit widened to \n6.6% of GDP from 3.9% in the previous year on higher imports, largely \nof fuel and lubricants. In Tonga, the current account de\ufb01cit narrowed to \n3.2% of GDP from 11.7% in FY2015 because of lower international food \nand oil prices. At the end of FY2016, Samoa\u2019s gross international reserves \nprovided 4.2 months of cover for merchandise imports, and Tonga\u2019s \nreserves provided 8.8 months.\n\nThe Cook Islands realized a \ufb01scal surplus equal to 3.7% of GDP in \nFY2016, reversing a small de\ufb01cit in the previous year (Figure 3.38.5). \nThis re\ufb02ected higher collections of income and value-added taxes, \nincluding a one-off collection of withholding taxes, as well as a 43.7% \ndrop in capital expenditure as no new projects were begun during the \nperiod. An analysis of debt sustainability undertaken in 2015 as part \nof a macroeconomic assessment found the Cook Islands at low risk \nof external debt distress. Net public debt, all of it external, rose from \nthe equivalent of 9.7% of GDP in FY2010 to 26.2% in FY2016 but is \nstill well below the government\u2019s ceiling of 35.0%. The government \nmaintains a debt-service reserve equal to 4.6% of GDP.\n\nIn Samoa, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit fell in FY2016 to the equivalent of 0.4% \nof GDP. This was achieved largely through rigorous expenditure control \nin line with the government\u2019s current emphasis on consolidation while \nsustaining quality spending in priority areas, as well as through higher \ntax collections, particularly excise and value-added taxes. At the end \nof the \ufb01scal year, net external debt equaled 52.6% of GDP, down from \n57.8% at the end of FY2015. \n\nTonga incurred a \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit equal to 3.1% of GDP in FY2016, \nup from 1.1% in FY2015 despite a strong increase in public revenue \nthanks to higher tax collection and customs revenue. The reasons for \nthe increase were higher current spending, led by wages, and a 60.3% \ndrop in budget support grants, which were replaced by concessional \nloans. Net external debt was estimated to equal 43.1% of GDP at the end \nof FY2016.\n\nEconomic prospects \nGrowth is seen to moderate in all three South Paci\ufb01c economies during \nthe forecast period. The Cook Islands is projected to decelerate to 5.0% \ngrowth in FY2017 and FY2018. The main constraint on growth is tourist \naccommodation capacity that is inadequate for the peak holiday season. \nThe prospects for expanding capacity are limited because of issues \npertaining to landownership and arrangements for leasing.\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\u201315\n\n3.38.3\u2002Inflation\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Statistics Office; Samoa Bureau of \nStatistics; Tonga Department of Statistics; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.38.4\u2002Current account balance\n\nCook Islands\nSamoa\nTonga\n\n% of GDP\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Cook Islands Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement; Central Bank of Samoa; Tonga Ministry of \nFinance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002289\n\nIn Samoa, \ufb01shery output is expected to level off, while public sector \n\n3.38.5\u2002Fiscal balance\n\nactivity and agriculture look poised to decline. The forecast is for \nsigni\ufb01cantly lower growth at 2.0% in FY2017 and, with the closure \nin August 2017 of a plant manufacturing automotive wire harnesses, \nfurther deceleration to 1.5% in FY2018. \n\nThe outlook for Tonga remains positive. The economy is forecast to \n\ngrow by 2.6% in both FY2017 and FY2018, supported by construction, \ntourism, and wholesale and retail trade in the run-up to the 2019 South \nPaci\ufb01c Games. \n\nIn\ufb02ation is expected to accelerate across all three economies \nduring the forecast period in line with international price movements. \nIn particular, higher international oil prices are seen to support in\ufb02ation \nat 0.5% in FY2017 and 1.2% in FY2018 in the Cook Islands and, in both \n\ufb01scal years, at 2.0% in Samoa and 2.5% in Tonga. \n\nThe Government of the Cook Islands will likely return to incurring \n\n\ufb01scal de\ufb01cits in the near term. A de\ufb01cit equal to 3.9% of GDP is \nexpected for FY2017 with the scheduled commencement of a number \nof public investment projects in water supply, renewable energy, and \nroads. These projects will double capital expenditure. The de\ufb01cit \nprojection further takes into account an estimated 6.5% decline in tax \ncollections. In FY2018, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is expected to narrow slightly to \n3.1% of GDP with lower capital spending and improved tax collection. \nDespite the projected \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits, strong economic growth should \npush net public debt lower to the equivalent of 24.8% of GDP in FY2017 \nand 22.0% in FY2018.\n\nSamoa\u2019s \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is expected to equal 3.5% of GDP in FY2017. \n\nFollowing stringent expenditure control and increased focus on \nrevenue collection, this is considerably higher than the de\ufb01cit \nin FY2016, the difference largely coming down to the construction of the \nairport terminal buildings. A de\ufb01cit equal to 3.0% of GDP is projected \nfor FY2018.\n\nIn Tonga, the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit is forecast to narrow to the equivalent \nof 1.6% of GDP in FY2017. A budget surplus of 0.4% on a cash basis is \nprojected for FY2018, narrowed mainly by strong revenue performance, \nrestraint on wages, and a decline in personal emoluments in real terms. \nPrimarily as a result of a government policy to avoid any new borrowing \nthat is not concessional, Tonga\u2019s external debt is expected to stay \nwithin the target ceiling of 50% of GDP, about 44% in FY2017 and 42% \nin FY2018.\n\nThe Cook Islands is forecast to realize current account surpluses \n\nequal to 24.5% of GDP in FY2017 and 21.0% in FY2018.

Across the \nPaci\ufb01c, progress is fragile and easily reversible in small states that \nlack livelihood diversity or economies of scale and are vulnerable to \nclimate shocks.\n\nThe Cook Islands has taken steps to mitigate the risks that disasters \n\npose to its tourism sector, but further efforts are needed to ensure \nsustainable economic growth over the long term. The government \nneeds to address structural impediments to private sector development \nsuch as restrictions on foreign investment. The exclusion of foreign \ninvestors from most sectors and uncertainty over how applications \nare processed prevent the economy from fully enjoying the bene\ufb01ts \nthat foreign capital, technology, and know-how can offer. A strategic \nreview of foreign investment policy and more rules-based consideration \nof proposals could facilitate investment in\ufb02ows and reduce costs for \nboth investors and the government. Meanwhile, any intervention \nneeds to strike a balance between spurring growth and upholding local \ncultural values.\n\nSamoa\u2019s main challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability \nwhile responding to disasters and \ufb02uctuations in the global economic \nenvironment. Declining foreign exchange reserves pose a real risk to \neconomic stability and may necessitate an appropriate policy response \nsuch as making recurrent spending more efficient toward achieving \n\ufb01scal consolidation and rebuilding buffers over the medium term. \nAs Samoa is vulnerable to disasters, it requires sufficient \ufb01scal and \nforeign exchange buffers to \ufb01nance disaster response and recovery. \nBecause a disaster can erode both these buffers, the authorities are \ncontemplating contingent facilities with multilateral development \npartners to cover the risk.\n\nTonga is faced with a growing need to restrain public wage \n\ngrowth to decrease wages\u2019 share of current spending, which was 45% \nin FY2016. The public sector wage bill gradually increased from the \nequivalent of 11.4% of GDP in FY2012 to 13.8% in FY2016, crowding out \ncapital outlays and spending on operations and maintenance, as well as \nundermining the implementation of policy priorities under the national \ndevelopment plan. A new formula for the cost-of-living allowance \nnow under development could become a useful annual target starting \nfrom FY2017. Broader civil service reform informed by the results of the \nrecent remuneration review should be undertaken in parallel to ensure \nthat employment in government is rationalized and that pay scales \nadequately re\ufb02ect responsibilities, while maintaining the quality of \npublic services.\n\n\fSmall island economies\n\nThe  economies  of  Kiribati,  Nauru,  and  Tuvalu  all  grew  in  2016.  The  major  contributor  to  growth \nwas public sector activity, particularly externally funded infrastructure projects. Inflation was stable. \nCurrent  account  deficits  in  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu  are  expected  to  persist  or  widen  with  the  waning \nof  El  Ni\u00f1o  and  its  transitory  boost  to  fishing  revenues.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  is \nneeded  to  rebuild  fiscal  buffers  and  stimulate  growth.\n\n3.39.1\u2002GDP growth\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n10.1\n\n34.2\n\n36.5\n\nEconomic performance \nFrom 2011 to 2015, growth averaged 3.5% in Kiribati. It was driven by \npublic expenditure supported by revenues from \ufb01shing license fees and \ninvestment in transport, water supply, and sanitation infrastructure \nfunded by development partners. Growth moderated to 1.8% in 2016 \nwith the completion of these major projects and a falloff in \ufb01sheries as a \nfading El Ni\u00f1o and cooler waters drew fewer \ufb01sh to the central Paci\ufb01c, \nand as fewer \ufb01shing days were allocated to US ships (Figure 3.39.1).\n\nNauru, by contrast, saw growth accelerate in FY2016 (ended 30 June \n2016) to an estimated 7.2% from 2.8% in FY2015. The recovery re\ufb02ected \nprogress in restoring phosphate exports, growth in services, and the \ngradual absorption of the refugee community into the local workforce. \nGovernment spending continued to increase, but the rate of increase \nslowed considerably from the previous year. Revised national account \nestimates suggest that growth in recent years has been much higher \nthan previously estimated. The rebased GDP estimates effectively place \na higher weight on service sectors, which have been booming, and less \nweight on mining and industry, which have been depressed by problems \nhitting phosphate exports. \n\nGrowth in Tuvalu accelerated to 3.0% in 2016 from 2.6% the \nprevious year on spending to expand accommodation capacity ahead \nof the Paci\ufb01c Islands Leaders Meeting in September 2019 and large \ngovernment-funded infrastructure projects, including waterfront \nreclamation and the building of public schools. \n\nthanks to higher revenue from \ufb01shing license fees. However, revenue \nfrom the sale of \ufb01shing licenses peaked in 2015 and fell by almost half \nto about A$116 million, equivalent to 53% of GDP in 2016 (Figure 3.39.2). \nThis has reversed the government\u2019s \ufb01scal position, turning a surplus in \n2015 equal to 45.7% of GDP into an 11.8% de\ufb01cit last year. \n\nIn Nauru, the \ufb01scal surplus in FY2016 is estimated at the equivalent \n\nof 11.1% of GDP, slightly lower than the 12.5% surplus seen in FY2015. \nWhile government spending continued to increase, the 13.5% pace of \ngrowth was much slower than in previous years, notably the 72.2% \n\nThis chapter was written by Roland Rajah of the Paci\ufb01c Liaison and Coordination Office, \nADB, Sydney; and Laisiasa Tora of the South Paci\ufb01c Subregional Office, ADB, Suva.\n\n% \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nKiribati\u2019s \ufb01scal balance improved markedly from 2012 to 2015, largely \n\n% of GDP \n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.39.2\u2002Fishing license revenues\n\nKiribati\nTuvalu\nNauru\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\nSources: Kiribati Ministry of Finance and Ministry of \nFisheries and Marine Resources Development; \nNauru Department of Finance; Tuvalu budget documents; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\f292\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nsurge in 2015, when government spending rose in response to large \nrevenue windfalls. \n\nIn Tuvalu, revenue from \ufb01shing licenses reached a record high \nestimated at A$37.3 million in 2016, or the equivalent of 82.6% of GDP, \nup from A$26.5 million in 2015, or 61.6% of GDP. The resulting \ufb01scal \nsurplus was the equivalent of 34.3% of GDP in 2016. With higher \ufb01shing \nrevenues, the government has been able to strengthen \ufb01scal buffers \nthrough greater investment in the Tuvalu Trust Fund. It also invested \nA$5 million in the Tuvalu Survival Fund. This new fund, established \nfollowing Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015, sets aside resources for disaster \nresponse and projects that mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nIn\ufb02ation in 2016 remained steady at 0.7% in Kiribati and moderated \nin Tuvalu to 2.0% from 3.2% in 2015 (Figure 3.39.3). In Nauru, in\ufb02ation \nrelented from 11.4% in FY2015 to an estimated 7.2% in FY2016 as growth \nin domestic demand slowed but damage to the port mooring system \ncontinued to hinder supply. All three countries use the Australian dollar \nas their currency, which helps to keep prices stable.\n\nThe current account position of Kiribati switched from a large \nsurplus equal to 44.7% of GDP in 2015 to a 7.0% de\ufb01cit in 2016 because \nof the sharp decline in income from \ufb01shing licenses and higher imports, \nwhich were driven by large in\ufb02ows of capital equipment for projects \nboth ongoing and about to commence. Tuvalu\u2019s current account surplus \nalmost halved from the equivalent of 10.0% of GDP in 2015 to 5.6% \nin 2016 as de\ufb01cits in goods and services trade widened, more than \noffsetting record high collections of \ufb01shing license revenue.\n\nEconomic prospects\nIn Kiribati, economic growth is likely to pick up to 2.0% in 2017 as large \ncapital works get under way, mostly with funding from development \npartners. Especially notable is a project to repair and upgrade Bonriki \nInternational Airport, the main gateway. Growth is likely to moderate \nto 1.5% in 2018 as \ufb01shing license revenues continue to fall, weighing \non public spending and economic output. The government is in a \nbetter position than in the past to withstand a downturn, however, \nhaving saved much of the surplus revenue generated from \ufb01sheries in \nthe good years to replenish \ufb01scal buffers in its Revenue Equalization \nReserve Fund.\n\nFor Nauru, the forecast is for growth to moderate to 4.3% in \n\nFY2017 because of only gradual recovery in phosphate exports and the \nplateauing of government spending and activities connected with the \nRegional Processing Centre (RPC) for asylum seekers and refugees. \nThe outlook for FY2018 is clouded by uncertainty surrounding a \npotential winding down of the RPC program in connection with a deal \nannounced by Australia that could see many of the refugees currently \nin Nauru resettled in the United States. Unknown at this stage are the \npace, scale, and timing of any change at the RPC, which has become \na major source of government revenue since FY2013 (Figure 3.39.4). \nThe assumed scenario has the RPC start to wind down in FY2018, \nexerting considerable downward pressure on the economy. This should \nbe partly offset by continued recovery in phosphate exports and the \n\n3.39.3\u2002Inflation\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati National Statistics Office; Nauru \nbudget documents; Tuvalu Central Statistics Division; \nADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n3.39.4\u2002 Revenues from Regional Processing \n\nCentre in Nauru\n\nDirect\nIndirect\n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016e\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: ADB estimates based on data from Nauru \nDepartment of Finance.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSmall island economies\u2002\u2002293\n\n3.39.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators (%)\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nKiribati\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nNauru\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nTuvalu\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n(share of GDP)\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n\u20132.4\n\n4.3\n\n5.7\n\n.\u2025\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n\u20131.5\n\n\u20134.5\n\n1.8\n\n.\u2025\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\nCurrent account balance  \n\n\u201320.8\n\n\u201325.4\n\n(share of GDP)\n\n... = data not available.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that \nyear for Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year \nfor Kiribati and Tuvalu.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n3.39.5\u2002Fiscal buffers as of 2016\n\nPer capita\n\nAmount\n\nA$ million\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\nA$\n\n18,000\n\n12,000\n\n6,000\n\n0\n\nKiribati\n(RERF)\n\nNauru\n(NTF)\n\nTuvalu\n(TTF + CIF + TSF)\n\nCIF = Consolidated Investment Fund, NTF = Nauru \nTrust Fund, RERF = Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, \nTSF = Tuvalu Survival Fund, TTF = Tuvalu Trust Fund.\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\nClick here for \ufb01gure data\n\nstart of construction on a new seaport facility. Nevertheless, output \nwould likely contract by 4.5%. \n\nThe macroeconomic outlook for Tuvalu remains upbeat. Growth is \nexpected to hold steady at 3% in 2017 and 2018, supported by stimulus \nfrom the implementation of projects funded by development partners, \nnotably one to upgrade maritime infrastructure on outer islands. \n\nIn\ufb02ation in Kiribati is expected to accelerate to 2.0% in 2017 and \n2018 on mildly rising prices for imported food and fuel. It is expected to \nmoderate in Nauru to 5.7% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018 as supply constraints \nease and domestic demand continues to slow. In Tuvalu, in\ufb02ation is \nforecast stable at 2.0% in 2017 and 2018 in line with steady growth. \nThe current account de\ufb01cit in Kiribati is projected to narrow to \nthe equivalent of 2.4% of GDP in 2017 and further to 1.5% in 2018 as \nimports fall from last year\u2019s peak. Tuvalu is expected to return to \ncurrent account de\ufb01cits, equal to 20.8% of GDP in 2017 and 25.4% \nin 2018, because \ufb01shing license revenues are likely to have peaked and \nthe import bill is set to rise to meet continuing demand for imported \ncapital inputs for ongoing projects.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement\nVolatile external revenue \ufb02ows into small island economies have impacts \nthat require prudent macroeconomic management and especially reform \nto facilitate private sector growth. In Kiribati, the steep decline in \n\ufb01shery revenue sharply constrains state \ufb01nances. Prospects for growth \ntherefore depend on sustaining a program of reform to address problems \nposed by inefficient state-owned enterprises, weak tax compliance, and \nlow collections of corporate tax.\n\nNauru is challenged to manage public infrastructure assets \n\nsustainably. Recent years have seen signi\ufb01cant public capital investment \nrelated to the RPC, as well as investments by development partners. \nMore investment is planned. However, with the future of the RPC \nuncertain, its winding down or eventual closure threatens economic \nand \ufb01scal sustainability, putting into jeopardy the sustainability of the \nsigni\ufb01cantly expanded infrastructure stock. Moreover, some new assets \nmay not be needed in the absence of the RPC, forcing Nauru to face \ndifficult challenges adjusting the quantity and mix of its infrastructure \nassets to its shifting requirements. The government needs to develop \nand adopt a sustainable infrastructure strategy for \ufb01nancing and \nimplementing effective asset maintenance, as well as for directing any \nadditional investment toward projects that are economically viable. \nTuvalu\u2019s heavy reliance on externally sourced income and \n\nsusceptibility to climate change makes it important for the government \nto continue pursuing \ufb01scal and structural reforms that boost investment \nand improve economic performance. The establishment of the Tuvalu \nSurvival Fund enhances the government\u2019s ability to respond to disasters. \n\nFurther strengthening of \ufb01scal buffers in these small island \n\neconomies would mitigate \ufb01scal volatility and support sustained growth \n(Figure 3.39.5).\n\n\f\fSTATISTICAL \nAPPENDIX\n\n\fStatistical notes and tables\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators for the 45 \ndeveloping member economies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \n18 tables. The economies are grouped into \ufb01ve subregions: Central Asia, \nEast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Paci\ufb01c. Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2012 to 2016; some have forecasts for 2017 \nand 2018.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, de\ufb01nitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is \nbased on the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the \ndata on balance of payments are based on International Monetary \nFund (IMF) accounting standards. Historical data were obtained from \nofficial sources, statistical publications and databases, and documents \nof ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank. For some economies, data for \n2016 are estimated from the latest available information. Projections \nfor 2017 and 2018 are generally ADB estimates made on the bases of \navailable quarterly or monthly data, though some projections are from \ngovernments.\n\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record \ntheir government \ufb01nance data by \ufb01scal year: Armenia; Azerbaijan; \nBrunei Darussalam; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; Kazakhstan; the Kyrgyz \nRepublic; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Tajikistan; Thailand; and Uzbekistan. South Asian \ncountries (except for the Maldives and Sri Lanka), the Cook Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, \nMyanmar, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga report all variables by \ufb01scal year.\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \n\ntables (A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14). For tables A1, A2, A6, and \nA14, the averages are computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World Bank \nAtlas method. The GNI data for 2012\u20132015 were obtained from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online. Weights for 2015 \nwere carried over through 2018. The GNI data for the Cook Islands \nand Taipei,China were estimated using the Atlas conversion factor. \nFor tables A11 and A12, the regional and subregional averages were \ncomputed on the basis of a consistent sum, which means that if there are \n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002297\n\nmissing country data for a given year, the sum of the prior year used for \ncomputing the growth rate excludes the corresponding country data. \nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show related data on \noutput growth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries have been made to accommodate \na change in source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for \nAfghanistan, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan re\ufb02ect \ufb01scal year \ndata, rather than calendar year data, while those for Timor-Leste re\ufb02ect \nGDP excluding the offshore petroleum sector.\n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \n\ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, \nor basic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of the value \nadded of all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes \nless subsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar \ntaxes. Constant factor cost measures differ from market price measures \nin that they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic \nprice valuation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such \nas property and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as labor-\nrelated subsidies but not product-related subsidies. Most economies use \nconstant market price valuation. Pakistan uses constant factor costs, \nwhile Fiji, the Maldives, and Nepal use basic prices. \n\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is de\ufb01ned as \nGDP at constant prices divided by the population. Data on per capita \ngross national income in US dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2015 \nare also shown, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s World Development \nIndicators online. The data for the Cook Islands and Taipei,China were \nestimated using the Atlas conversion factor.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year). \n\nThe table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current prices. \nThe agriculture sector comprises agricultural crops, livestock, poultry, \n\ufb01sheries, and forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year). \n\nThe table provides the growth rates of value added in industry \nat constant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current \nprices. This sector comprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, \nconstruction, and utilities.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year). \n\nThe table gives the growth rates of value added in services at \nconstant prices and its corresponding share in 2015 at current prices. \nSubsectors generally include trade, banking, \ufb01nance, real estate, public \nadministration, and other services. For Malaysia, electricity, gas, water, \nand waste management are included under services.\n\nTable A6: In\ufb02ation (% per year). Data on in\ufb02ation rates are \n\nperiod averages. The in\ufb02ation rates presented are based on consumer \nprice indexes. The consumer price indexes of the following economies \nare for a given city or group of consumers only: Afghanistan is for \nKabul until 2011, Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands \nis for Majuro, Solomon Islands is for Honiara, and Nepal is for \nurban consumers.\n\n\f298\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nTable A7: Change in money supply (% per year). This table tracks \n\nthe annual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad \nmoney as represented by M2 for most countries. M2 is de\ufb01ned as the \nsum of M1 and quasi-money, where M1 denotes currency in circulation \nplus demand deposits, and quasi-money consists of time and savings \ndeposits including foreign currency deposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government \ufb01nance. These tables give \nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the \ufb01scal balance of \nthe central government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal \nterms. For Cambodia since 2006, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan, \ntransactions are those reported by the general government.\n\nTable A8: Central government revenues (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment revenues comprise all nonrepayable receipts, both current \nand capital, plus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage \nof GDP at current prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenues exclude \nsocial security contributions. For Singapore, revenues include the net \ninvestment returns contribution. For Kazakhstan, revenues include \ntransfers from the national fund. Grants are excluded in Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; revenues from \ndisinvestment are included for India; and only current revenues are \nincluded for Bangladesh.\n\nTable A9: Central government expenditures (% of GDP). Central \n\ngovernment expenditures comprise all nonrepayable payments to \nboth current and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts \nare computed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, \nexpenditures refer to budgetary expenditures excluding externally \n\ufb01nanced expenditures and corresponding borrowing. Those for \nTajikistan include externally \ufb01nanced public investment programs. \nOne-time expenditures are excluded for Pakistan.\n\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). Fiscal \n\nbalance is the difference between central government revenues and \nexpenditures. The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current \nprices. Data variations may arise from statistical discrepancies when, \nfor example, balancing items for both central and local governments, \nand from differences in the concept used in the individual computations \nof revenues and expenditures as compared with the calculation of the \n\ufb01scal balance. For Fiji, the \ufb01scal balance excludes total loan repayments. \nFor Thailand, the \ufb01scal balance is a cash balance composed of the \nbudgetary and nonbudgetary balances. Some off-budget accounts are \nincluded in the computation of the \ufb01scal balance for Turkmenistan.\n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. These tables \n\nshow selected international economic transactions of countries as \nrecorded in the balance of payments. These items cover annual \ufb02ows.\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and \nimports (% per year). These tables show the annual growth rates of \nexports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily \nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. \nExports are reported free on board. Import data are reported free on \nboard, except for the following economies, which value them on the \nbasis of cost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; Bhutan; Cambodia; \n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002299\n\nHong Kong, China; India; the Lao PDR; Myanmar; Samoa; Singapore; \nand Thailand. \n\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures in this table are based on the export and import amounts used \nto generate tables A11 and A12. \n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current \naccount balance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, \nnet trade in services and factor income, and net transfers. The values \nreported are divided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. In the case \nof Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, official transfers are excluded \nfrom the current account balance. \n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). \n\nAnnual average exchange rates are quoted as the local currencies per US \ndollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \n\ninternational reserves are de\ufb01ned as the US dollar value of holdings of \nforeign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, \nand gold at the end of a given period. For Taipei,China, this heading \nrefers to foreign exchange reserves only. In some economies, the \nrubric is foreign assets and reserves of national monetary authorities \nand national oil funds, i.e., foreign assets of the Maldives Monetary \nAuthority, net foreign reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan, and assets \nof the National Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. The data for India are as of 10 \nMarch 2017.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most \neconomies, external debt outstanding, public and private, includes \nmedium- and long-term debt, short-term debt, and IMF credit. \nFor Cambodia and the Lao PDR, only public external debt is reported. \nFor Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and \nThailand, the \ufb01gures for 2016 are as of the end of September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \n\nThis table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-\nterm debt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a \npercentage of exports of goods and services. For Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR, debt service refers to external public debt only. For Viet Nam, \nexports of goods are used as the denominator in the calculation of the \nratio; for the Philippines, exports of goods, services, and income are \nused as the denominator. For Bangladesh, the ratio represents debt \nservice payments on medium- and long-term loans as a percentage \nof exports of goods, nonfactor services, and workers\u2019 remittances. \nFor Azerbaijan, the ratio represents public and publicly guaranteed \nexternal debt service payments as a percentage of exports of goods and \nnonfactor services.\n\n\f300 Asian Development Outlook 2017\n\nTable A1\u2002Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of\nHong Kong, China\nKorea, Rep. of\nMongolia\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

These factors will likely continue to support growth this year and next despite rebalancing \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China and tepid recovery in the advanced economies. Risks to growth stem from \nuncertain policy directions in the advanced economies, including an anticipated tightening of US monetary \npolicy. While short-term risks appear manageable, spillover to capital flows and exchange rates require \nmonitoring. \n\nDecades of rapid growth lifted most of developing Asia from low- to middle-income status. Sustained \ngrowth to escape the middle-income trap must come largely from improved total factor productivity, which \nis achieved by fostering entrepreneurial innovation and investing in human capital and infrastructure. The \ndifficult transition from middle to high income further demands a sound institutional framework and policy \nenvironment anchored on macroeconomic stability. Developing Asia\u2019s dynamic yet sure-footed track record \nindicates that it can transcend the middle-income challenge. \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAsiAn Development BAnk\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\n \n\n \n\n \f", "author_pages": ["ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2017\n", "TRANSCENDING THE MIDDLE-INCOME CHALLENGE\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "  Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n", "\u00a9 2017 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 632 4444; Fax +63 2 636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
