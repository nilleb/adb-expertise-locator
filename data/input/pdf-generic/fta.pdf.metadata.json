Viewed \npragmatically, against the backdrop of slow progress in \nglobal trade talks, FTAs can promote continued trade \nliberalization, induce structural reforms in the economies \nconcerned, and widen market access across a vibrant \neconomic region, where the demand for greater intra-\nregional trade is rapidly increasing. \nOn the negative side, the proliferation of bilateral FTAs \ncan create the so-called \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d effect as multiple \nrules of origin arising from overlapping agreements cause \nharm particularly to small and medium enterprises with \nlimited capacity to comply with them. The resulting \nmarket fragmentation would be more costly even for  \nmajor multinational companies because of rising \ntransaction costs and regulatory barriers. The flow of \nforeign direct investment and the associated transfer of \ntechnology and know-how to smaller economies would \nalso decline. \nNevertheless, FTAs are a growing reality. If we recognize \nthat and hope to foster regional trade agreements as  \nbuilding blocks of global trade and investment integration, \nwe cannot stand idly by and wait for a comprehensive \nglobal resolution. We strongly support the Doha \nnegotiation process, while recognizing the need to \nconsolidate and streamline regional and bilateral FTAs \ninto an eventual Greater Asian FTA. \nThe recent proliferation of FTAs in Asia and the Pacific \nis placing mounting strain on the region\u2019s FTA negotiating \ncapacity and on the knowledge and technical skills of \ngovernment officials.

Starting with the second program in July \n2007, we expanded participation to all ADB developing \nmember countries to meet the growing demand for FTA \ntraining in the region. Around 100 government officials \nfrom all over Asia participated in the training.\nFrom the outset, we felt a need for a reference book on  \nFTA for the training course. Drafting a structured text \nmaterial for the courses was the main objective of this \nproject. But this book serves other purposes as well. \nGovernment officials who are or will be involved in \nFTA negotiations can get background knowledge and \nguidelines on practical issues from this reference book. \nThe general public, including the academe and students \nwho are interested in practical aspects of FTA, can also \nbenefit from this. It avoids excessively academic or  \ntechnical terms and is written in language that is \naccessible to everyone with basic, common-sense ideas \nabout economics, international trade, and FTAs. \nNegotiating free trade agreements: a guide, prepared by \nthe Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, \nwas the benchmark for this project. Nevertheless, we have  \ntried to cover a wider scope of issues ranging from \nfundamental theories to actual components and practical \nissues related to FTAs.\nJong Woo Kang, Economist, OREI, organized this \nproject and coordinated the overall production of the \npublication.

I:  \nEconomics of a Free \nTrade Agreement\nTrade Trends: regionalizaTion  \nversus regionalism\nregionalism, which we will define generally here to \ninclude any formal preferential trading arrangement \nbetween two or more countries, came late to Asia. 1  \nBefore the turn of the 21st century, there were few \nregional trading agreements in existence. While successful \nAsian economies by and large exploited the international \nmarketplace effectively, they did so in the context of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World \nTrade Organization (WTO) framework (see Box 1.1 for \nan overview of the evolution of the multilateral system). \nHowever, regionalization, which we will define as a \nmarket-led process of increasing economic interaction, has \nbeen building up momentum in Asia for decades, spurred \nby unilateral liberalization, market-oriented reforms, and \nsuccessful economic growth in Asia consistently above \nthe global average (with the exception of the Asian Crisis \nyears, 1997\u20131998). Hence, formal preferential trading \narrangements in the region, particularly in the form of \nfree trade areas (FTAs), are being developed as a means \nof enhancing regionalism (\u201cthe flag following trade\u201d) \nrather than the other way around, as was true of such \nagreements as colonial preferences or even the early \nyears of European economic integration. In most of Asia, \nregionalism is being used as part of the overall process of  \neconomic reform, to buttress the outward-oriented \ndevelopment strategies of the region\u2019s economies.\n1  Unless specified otherwise, \u201cAsia\u201d throughout the reference book is taken to \ninclude the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 47 regional member countries \n(see list in http://aric.adb.org/technotes.htm#countrygroupings).", "\u0018\u2002|\u2002How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\nbox\u20021.1:\u2002 A Brief History of Multilateral Governance  As we will see throughout this reference \nunder the World Trade Organization\u2014 book, regionalism has both positive and \nFrom the GATT Rounds to Doha negative elements.
