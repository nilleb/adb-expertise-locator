But  due  to  lower \ninternational oil prices, it was unable to achieve this target and was forced to take further \nmeasures. Hence, in February 2016, the BOJ adopted a negative interest rate policy by \nmassively increasing the money supply through purchasing long-term Japanese government \nbonds (JGB). The BOJ had previously purchased short-term government bonds mainly, a \npolicy that flattened the yield curve of JGBs. On the one hand, banks reduced the numbers \nof government bonds because short-term bond yields had become negative, and even the \ninterest rates of long-term government bonds up to 15 years became negative. On the other \nhand, bank loans to the corporate sector did not increase due to the Japanese economy\u2019s \nvertical investment\u2013saving (IS) curve. This paper firstly explains why, in the view of the \nauthors, the BOJ has to reduce its 2% inflation target in the present low oil price era. \nSecondly, it argues that Japan cannot make a sustainable recovery from its long-lasting \nrecession and tackle its long-standing deflation problem by means of its current monetary \npolicy and its negative interest rate policy in particular. It is of key importance to make the IS \ncurve downward sloping rather than vertical. That means the rate of return on investment \nmust be positive and companies must be willing to invest if interest rates are set too low. \nJapan\u2019s long-term recession is due to structural problems that cannot be solved by its \ncurrent monetary policy.

INTRODUCTION \nOn 22 January 2013, the Government of Japan and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) delivered \na joint statement on overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable economic growth. \nThe  BOJ  set  the  price  stability  target  at  2%  (year-on-year  rate  of  change  in  the \nconsumer  price  index).  Since  then,  the  BOJ  has  been  implementing  aggressive \nmonetary  easing  through  buying  long-term  government  bonds  and  increasing  the \nmonetary base, in contrast to previous expansionary monetary policy attempts, which \nmainly focused on buying short-term government bonds to achieve this target. \nAlthough for some short periods in 2014 inflation reached the 2% target, this was \nmainly caused by higher energy prices, especially of oil, and because the consumption \ntax rate was raised from 5% to 8%. Following the start of the oil price decline in the \nglobal market in June 2014, general price levels in Japan also started to decline. Oil \nprices dropped from over $100 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $30 per barrel in \nFebruary 2016. Oil and other petroleum products make up a significant portion of total \nJapanese imports. That is why the price fluctuation of oil has a significant impact on \nJapanese macroeconomic variables, including on the inflation rate. \nAlthough the price of oil is now less than half the price in early 2014, the BOJ has \nmaintained its 2% inflation target. When the price of oil decreases, production becomes \ncheaper and the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, decreasing the equilibrium \nprice level. That means the target inflation rate needs to be reviewed and be lower. \nThe BOJ could not achieve a stable 2% inflation rate and hence further eased the \ninterest rate. At its monetary policy meeting on 29 January 2016, the BOJ policy board \ndecided  to  introduce  \"quantitative  and  qualitative  monetary  easing  (QQE)  with  a \nnegative interest rate\" to achieve the price stability target of 2% at the earliest possible \ntime. The BOJ started this policy by increasing the money supply through purchasing \nlong-term Japanese government bonds (JGB). This policy has flattened the yield curve \nof  JGBs  and  banks  started  to  reduce  purchasing  government  bonds  because \ngovernment bonds yields up to 15 years became negative. \nIn this paper we first shed light on the role of oil prices in the Japanese economy and in \nthe price determination in Japan. We show why, in the current low oil price era, the \nBOJ needs to deflate the inflation targets. We also investigate whether the recent \nnegative interest rate policy of the BOJ was effective, and provide some suggestions \nfor overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable economic growth. \n2.  RECENT GLOBAL OIL PRICE MOVEMENTS \nOil prices dropped from over$100 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $30 per barrel in \nFebruary 2016 (Figure 1). They started rising again in early April 2016 because of a \nfragile improvement in demand, but they are still less than half of the 2014 level. The \nsharp drop was due to several reasons related to supply and demand conditions and \nexpectations in the oil market (for more information, refer to Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013\nHesary 2016a). \n \n \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nFigure 1: Recent Global Spot Oil Price Movements \n(4 Jan 2010\u201318 July 2016) \n \nNote: WTI price is Cushing, OK West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Spot Price Free on Board (FOB) (US dollars per barrel); \nBrent price is Europe Brent Spot Price FOB (US dollars per barrel). \nSource: US Energy Information Administration. http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_spt_s1_d.htm (accessed 20 \nDecember 2016). \n \n2.1  Causes of Oil Price Drop \nThe price of oil is determined partly by actual supply and demand, and partly by \nexpectations. Some of the recent price collapse can be attributed to a new glut in oil \nsupply. Unconventional energy resources, such as shale oil, shale gas, and oil sands, \nhave increased the global oil supply. Massive discoveries of oil in North Dakota and \nTexas in the United States (US) have driven down prices, and even amid tensions in \nthe Middle East, roughly 3 million barrels more a day are being produced now than \nin 2011. \nMoreover, while oil prices were falling, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries (OPEC), which controls nearly 40% of the world market, failed to reach an \nagreement on production curbs at its recent meetings, thus sending the price down \neven further. \nSupply exceeded demand by massive margins of 0.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) in \n2014 and 2.0mb/d in 2015. We expect a further increase in supply of 1.1 mb/d in 2016 \n(International Energy Agency 2016). \nIn 2014, global economic activity was subdued. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nreported  global  gross domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  3.4%  in constant  prices. \nGrowth in emerging markets and developing economies\u2014while still accounting for over \n70% of global growth\u2014declined for the fourth consecutive year, mostly driven by Brazil, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, and Russian Federation. In 2015, global economic \nactivity declined further, with GDP growth falling to 3.1%. The IMF downgraded its \nglobal growth outlook for 2016 by 0.2% to 3.2%, which is broadly in line with 2015. \nAlthough the IMFforecasts a strengthening of the recovery in 2017, the situation in \n2016 is expected to be the same as in 2015. The IMF also noted that uncertainty has \nincreased, and that the risks of weaker growth scenarios are becoming more tangible.  \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \n \nBefore discussing how monetary policy was behind the drop in oil prices, let us look \nfurther back to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008\u20132009 and review what happened \nto the US money market and global oil prices at that time.  \nAfter the subprime mortgage crisis, the weak exchange rate of the US dollar that had \nresulted from the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing policy pushed oil prices in US \ndollars upward during2009\u20132012 by causing investors to invest in the oil market and \nother commodity markets while the world economy was in recession. As a result,  \nhuge amounts of capital entered the crude oil market as investors found it safer than \ncapital  markets,  which  had  collapsed  (Yoshino  and  Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary  2014a). \nBecause of this new demand, oil prices started to rise sharply in 2009, when the US \nand many other economies were in recession. This trend had the effect of imposing a \nlonger recovery time on the global economy, as oil is one of the most important \nproduction inputs. \nIn 2014, financial conditions eased compared with2013. In particular, long-term interest \nrates  declined  in  developed  economies  because  of  the  economic  recovery  and \nexpectations of a lower neutral policy rate in the US over the medium term.  \nEquity prices have generally risen and risk premiums declined in developed economies \nand  emerging  markets.  In  the  US,  both  the  Dow  Jones  Industrial  Average  and \nStandard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index powered to record highs, boosted by the strengthening \nUS  economy  and  liquidity  provided  by  the  Federal  Reserve\u2019s  unprecedented \nquantitative easing. The Dow, up 8.5%, surpassed two key psychological levels during \n2014\u201417,000 and 18,000\u2014and the Standard &Poor\u2019s 500, 12.8% higher, surpassed \nthe 2,000 milestone. \nThe liquidity provided mainly by the Federal Reserve, especially during the 2008\u20132009 \nfinancial crisis, transferred to the oil market and created huge speculative demand \ncausing a surge in oil prices. In 2014, because the US and some other developed and \nemerging capital markets were recovering, liquiditymoved back to the capital markets, \nresulting in a depressed global oil demand growth rate and a price collapse in the \nmarket. This means that this factor may have played a bigger role in reducing oil prices \nthan supply and lower economic growth(Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary 2016a). \n3.  OIL PRICES AND THE JAPANESE ECONOMY \nIn 2015, the total value of Japan\u2019s imports was $648 billion, $150 billion (23%) of which \nwas mineral fuels, $67 billion petroleum, $46 billion liquid natural gas, $16 billion coal, \n$15 billion petroleum products, and $5 billion liquefied petroleum gas  (Figure 2). \nAlthough Japan\u2019s crude oil imports in 2015 fell to their lowest level since 1988 as \ndemand had been weakening due in part to a declining population, slower economic \ngrowth, and more energy- efficient vehicles and industries, oil is still the main mover of \nthe Japanese economy and Japan remains the third largest consumer of crude oil \nbehind the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n   \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nFigure 2: Japan\u2019s Imports by Principal Commodity, 2015 \n(thousands of $) \n \nLNG = liquefied natural gas, LPG = liquefied petroleum gas. \nSource: Japan External Trade Organization(2016). \nJapan is dependent on imports for 91.4% of its energy supply. Since the Fukushima \nnuclear  disaster  in  2011,  the  share  of  fossil  fuels  in  power  generation  has  been \nincreasing, as a substitute for nuclear power. The level of dependence on petroleum, \nwhich had been declining in recent years, increased to 47.2% in fiscal year (FY) 2012. \nIn FY2013, the total primary energy supply in Japan was 21,973 petajoules, up 1.1% \nfrom the previous FY, broken down as follows: 45.7% was petroleum, 24.2% coal, \n22.5% natural gas, 3.1% hydropower, and 0.4% nuclear power. Other sources were \nalso used, though only in small quantities, including energy from waste, geothermal \nenergy, and natural energy (solar photovoltaic power, wind power, biomass energy, \namong others) (MIAC 2015). \nThe result of eliminating nuclear power generation and substituting it with fossil fuels \nwas that the energy self-sufficiency1 percentage fell from 19.6% in FY2000 to 8.6% in \nFY2013 (MIAC 2015). Before the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan was the \nthird largest consumer of nuclear power in the world, after the US and France, with \nnuclear power accounting for about 13% of the country\u2019s total energy consumption in \n2010 (Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary et al. 2015a). In 2012, the share of nuclear energy fell to 1% \nof total energy consumption, contributing a similar level to primary energy consumption \nin 2013 as only two reactors were operating for a little more than half the year, and in \n2014 Japan did not produce any nuclear power (Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary and Yoshino \n2015). \nThe great importance of oil for the Japanese economy means oil price movements \nhave significant effects on Japanese macroeconomic variables including economic \ngrowth and the inflation rate. Several scholars have shown this (Hamilton 1996; Lee, \nLee, and Ratti 2001; Blanchard and Gali 2007; Kilian 2008; Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary et al. \n2013, 2015a; Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary 2015a).  \nYoshino  and  Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary  (2015a),  by  developing  a  simultaneous  equation \nmodel consisting of the Phillips curve (aggregate supply), aggregate demand, and the \nTaylor  rule  equations,  tried  to  find  out  whether  the  achieved  inflation  rate  in \n                                                 \n1  Domestic production of primary energy (including nuclear)/domestic supply of primary energy \u00d7 100. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nJapan,following the quantitative and qualitative monetary easingof the BOJ since 2013, \nwas caused by monetary policy or by higher oil prices.

The y-axis of the Phillips curve is the inflation rate, and the x-axis is the GDP \ngap. Usually, the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, which means the GDP gap \nand the inflation rateshould be positively related. The results for Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001 are \nin accordance with an upward sloping aggregate supply, which means a larger GDP \ngap tended to result in a higher inflation rate in the first period. When the economy is in \nan inflationary environment, that will accelerate current inflation even more, so in this \nsituation lagged inflation should have a positive impact on the current inflation rate, \nwhich  is  what  happened  in  the  first  period  of  this  analysis.  However,  \nafter 2002, Japan was faced with deflation and a decreasing GDP gap, so the results \nshow that the lagged inflation rate and the GDP gap in the Phillips curve are not \nsignificant in the second period of this analysis, which is indeed the case. This means \n(i)  the  current  year\u2019s  inflation  was  not  affected  by  lagged  inflation  rates,  and \n(ii) because the economy was in recession, the GDP gap was negative and had no \nimpact on the inflation rate. However, the rising crude oil price shifted up the aggregate \nsupply  curve  because  imports  of  oil  created  inflationary  pressure.  Therefore,  the \npositive  sign  of  the  crude  oil  price  in  both  periods  is  correct.  This  finding  is  in \naccordance  with  the  paper\u2019s  hypothesis.  Although  inflation  was  created  after  the \nadoption of QQE, we believe this was due mainly to other factors, especially higher oil \nprices. Following the easy monetary policy of the BOJ, the yen started to depreciate \nheavily, which increased prices of crude oil and other energy imports, pushing up \nproduction costs and creating inflation. Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary\u2019s (2015a) \nresults support this assertion. In the second period, the sign of the output gap in the \nPhillips curve equation was not significant, which means that the economy was in \nrecession and aggregate demand did not rise enough to have an impact on price \nlevels. However, the higher oil price in yen, which was mainly the result of easy \nmonetary policy, has had a significant impact on general price levels and has been a \nnegative development for Japanese manufacturers. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nThe second part of Table 1 is aggregate demand. It is clear that in the second period \nlong-term interest rates did not have any significant association with the GDP gap. This \nmeans the QQE policies that cut the short-term and long-term interest rates could \nneither  stimulate  the  economy  nor  create  inflation.  And  as  mentioned  above,  the \ngeneral price inflation in that period was due to other factors, mainly the oil price.  \nThe third part of Table 1 is the Taylor rule, which depends on inflation and the GDP \ngap. If the inflation rate keeps on going up, the central bank will tighten monetary \npolicy, so the inflation rate should have a positive sign (Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, \nHassanzadeh, and Prasetyo 2014). It is positive in both periods, but significant only in \nthe second period. With regard to the GDP gap, it widened during Q2 1994\u2013Q4 2001. \nWhen current GDP is higher than full employment GDP, the economy is accelerating, \nat which point the central bank usually tries to tighten the money market, so the GDP \ngap should have a positive sign in line with the Taylor rule. After 2002, Japan was \nfaced with recession, so the GDP gap became negative; the central bank then lowered \nthe short-term interest rate, and again the GDP gap should have a positive sign in line \nwith the Taylor rule. \n4.  LOWER OIL PRICES AND THE NEGATIVE INTEREST \nRATE POLICY OF THE BANK OF JAPAN \nIn 2013, the BOJ set a price stability target of 2% (year-on-year rate of change in the \nconsumer price index). On 4 April 2013, the BOJ announced that, based on a decision \nat  its  monetary  policy  meeting,  it  would  purchase  Japanese  government  bonds, \neffective 5 April 2013. This decision was madeat the first monetary policy meeting after \nHaruhiko Kuroda had taken up his post as the new governor of the BOJ.  \nFigure 3: Expansion in the Monetary Base and  \nJapanese Government Bond Holdings \n(January 2000\u2013June 2016) \n \nJGB = Japanese government bond. \nNotes: Monetary base is average amounts outstanding in each month.

On  the  liability  side  of  the  BOJ\u2019s  balance  sheet,  the \nmonetary  base  increased  drastically.  Table  2  shows  the  asset  side  of  the  BOJ\u2019s \nbalance sheet.

Hence, declining oil prices lead to cheaper input prices  \nfor production, which is good news for suppliers and manufacturers of commodities.  \nOn  the  other  hand,  aggregate  demand  (AD)  will  also  shift  to  the  right  because \nconsumption of oil and derivatives will be cheaper and this will offset part of the earlier \nprice  decrease  by  the  shifting  of  the  AS  curve.  However,  the  shift  in  AD  in  the \nJapanese  case  is  less  for  several  reasons,  two  of  the  most  important  being  the  \naging population and more efficient automobiles that reduced the consumption and \nelasticity of oil and petroleum products with respect to prices. Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, \nRasolinezhad,  and  Kobayashi  (2015b)  found  that  among  Japanese  oil  consuming \nsectors, the commercial and industrial sectors show a significant response to oil price \nfluctuations, while the residential sector does not. They also found that in the wake of \nthe Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, almost all economic sectors had a lower \nsensitivity to oil price fluctuations because Japan\u2019s dependency on oil increased. \nWith a simple AD\u2013AS illustration, Figure 5 shows that following the decline in oil prices, \nthe final equilibrium rate of inflation decreases. This means that the 2% inflation target \nmay not necessarily be appropriate in the current cheap oil era. \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nFigure 5: Lower Oil Prices, Lower Inflation Rate Target  \n \nAD = aggregate demand, AS = aggregate supply.  \nSource: Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary and Yoshino (2013). \nAt its monetary policy meeting on 29 January 2016, the BOJ policy board introduced \nQQE with a negative interest rate to achieve the price stability target of 2% at the \nearliest  possible  time.

With  a  view  to \nencouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank \nwill conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market \nconditions.  The  average  remaining  maturity  of  the  Bank's  JGB  purchases  \nwill be about 7\u201312 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds \n(ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts \noutstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about  \n90 billion yen, respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will \nmaintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion \nyen, respectively.\u201d \n(iii) Interest-Ratedimension.  \u201cThe  introduction  of  a  negative  interest  rate:  The \nBank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1% to current accounts  \nthat financial institutions hold at the Bank. It will cut the interest rate further  \ninto negative territory if judged as necessary.\u201d Specifically, the BOJ adopted a \nthree-tier system in which the outstanding balance of each financial institution's \ncurrent account at the BOJ is divided into three tiers. A positive interest rate, a \nzero interest rate, or a negative interest rate is applied to each of the tiers. \nAlthough the BOJ published the abovementioned guidelines on 29 January 2016, the \nshort-term negative interest rate also affected the long-term government bond interest \nrate and the JGB yield curve started to fall and flattened (Figure 7). The BOJ had not \nexpected this to happen. This means it is not rational to hold government bonds until \nmaturity, as the value of 100 at maturity will be less than 100 (i.e., 99, 98, 97, 96, or \nless). Hence, investors, especially overseas investors, are trading the bonds rather \nthan keeping them until maturity. The nominal interest rate has dropped (Figure 9), but \nthe volatility of the bond market has increased because of higher trading of bonds. As \nfor  holdings  of  government  bonds,  long-term  bonds  longer  than  17  years  have  a \npositive yield, but nobody wants to keep bonds that are shorter than 17 years until \nmaturity because the interest rate is negative. \nFollowing its 29 January meeting, the BOJ started charging negative interest rate on \nexcess reserves kept by commercial banks at the BOJ. Despite a massive increase of \nthe money supply by the BOJ, bank loans have decreased, not increased (Figure 11). \nSee Figure 8 for the recent behavior of Japanese banks. \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nFigure 7: Japanese Government Bond Yield Curves \n \nSource: Ministry of Finance of Japan, Financial Bureau(2016). \nFigure 8: Bank of Japan\u2019s and Japanese Banks\u2019 More Recent Balance Sheets \n \nER = excess reserve, RR = reserve requirement.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \nMore recently, there has been greater demand from overseas investors for short-term \nbonds (Treasury or T-bills). As shown in Figure 10 (B), 49% of the holders of T-billsare \nforeigners who are buying and selling short-term Japanese government bonds and \nmaking a profit. This is the reason for the recent increase in volatility of the Japanese \nbond market. \nThe BOJ increased its purchases of government bonds from \u00a598 trillion in April 2013to \n\u00a5324 trillion in June 2016. The BOJ started to purchase long-term government bonds. \nAs shown in Figure 9, the shift in demand is mainly a result of the BOJ\u2019s policy, which \nincreases the price, and at the same time decreases the interest rate, of long-term \ngovernment bonds. That is why the JGB yield curve shifted downward (Figure 7). \nThe BOJ wants the yield curve to become positive in the long term and become \nsteeper compared to the current yield curve. To do so, the BOJ will start to purchase \nshort-term government bonds rather than long-term bonds.  \n \n \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nFigure 9: Inverse Relationship between Price of Bonds and Interest Rate  \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 compilation. \nAs can be seen in Figure 10 A), the share of households holding JGBs is very small \n(1%), as they are no longer interested in holding these bonds because of negative \ninterest rates. \nAmong households, the Japanese saving rate is falling because of the aging population \nand  lower  economic  growth  rate,  while  the  corporate  sector  saves  more  than \nhouseholds.  Corporate  savings  are  going  to  banks  or  insurance  companies.  In \nconventional cases, banks should lend money; however, because of the decreased \ndemand  for  loans,  bank  lending  is  decreasing  (Figure  11).  Due  to  the  Japanese \neconomy\u2019s vertical investment\u2013saving (IS) curve, the rate of return on investment and \ncompanies\u2019 willingness to invest have become very low. Hence, loans are diminishing \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nand banks are holding government bonds instead. So on the asset side of Japanese \nbanks, we can see predominantly JGBs. \nFigure 10: Breakdown by Japanese Government Bond and T-bill holders  \n(March 2016, %) \n \nBOJ = Bank of Japan, JGB = Japanese government bond, T-bill = treasury bill.  \nSource: Ministry of Finance of Japan, Financial Bureau(2016). \nFigure 11: Declining Bank Loans in Japan \n(Q1 2005\u2013Q4 2014) \n \nNote: The constant line shows the quarterly differences in the outstanding amount of loans (left-hand side axis); the \ndashed line shows the outstanding amount of loans (right-hand side axis); and the dotted line is the logarithmic trend of \nthe quarterly differences in the outstanding amount of loans. \nSource: Japanese Bankers Association database (2016). \nDuring the current Japanese government, attention is focused more on monetary policy \nrather than structural issues, but the problem of the Japanese economy is its vertical IS \ncurve (Figure 12).

This is in accordance with Table 1. \nThe  aggregate  demand  row,  where  during  the  second  period  real  interest  rate \nmovements had no significant impact on the GDP gap, is a reflection of the vertical IS \ncurve. \nCorporate restructuring to reduce idle capacity and start new investments was not \npursued, with too much criticism aimed at monetary policy instead of accelerating \ncorporate restructuring (Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary 2015b). \nHowever, there has been a recent change in banking behavior. After 2012, demand for \nJGBs fell both in large city banks and regional banks. Instead, because of higher \ninterest rates on deposits at BOJ, banks increased their excess reserves at the BOJ. \nBut  this  new  negative  interest  rate  policy  forced  banks  to  withdraw  their  excess \nreserves from the central bank and spend it onother ways. More recently, especially \namong regional banks, the demand for investment overseas has been increasing. \nBecause the deposits the banks collect are in yen, they are investing in Europe in euro \nor in the US in dollars, creating an exchange rate risk. The suggestion to banks is to \nkeep some portion of deposits in foreign currencies (euro, dollar, among others) to \nminimize the exchange rate risk. \nFigure 12: Ineffectiveness of Monetary Policy in Japan \n \nGDP = gross domestic product,LM = liquidity preference/money supply equilibrium. \nSource: Modified version of the table from Yoshino and Sakakibara (2002). \n5.

To do so, it is necessary to abolish the seniority wage rate and flatten \nthe wage curve. \nFigure 13 shows that the effect of monetary policy on the economy is weakened when \nthe proportion of retirees is larger (i.e., the proportion of working population is smaller). \nAlthough the effect of an expansionary monetary policy (interest rate policy) on output \nmay be similar between two economies, the effect of the policy on consumption in an \neconomy with higher labor participation is much larger than that in an economy with \nfewer workers.  \nFigure 13: Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy Shock on the Economy \n \nNote: For an expansionary monetary policy, responses to a decrease in the nominal interest rate are reported.

In \nthe economy, retirees receive pension benefits that are financed by imposing taxes on \nworkers. Thus, pension benefits are transfers from tax payment by workers. Given the \namount  of  pension  benefits  per  retiree,  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  working \npopulation  reduces  the  tax  paid  by  each  worker.  This  leads  to  an  increase  in \nconsumption of workers and thus aggregate consumption. An increase in working \npopulation increases labor supply, which increases output. \nFigure 14 implies that necessary policy to cope with an aging population is to keep old \npeople working. Figures 13 and 14 imply that in an aging society, macroeconomic \npolicies become less effective and it is better to increase the working population to \nboost the economy. \n6.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nJapan has reached the limits of conventional macroeconomic policies. To overcome \ndeflation and achieve sustainable economic growth, the BOJ since 2013 has had an \ninflation target of 2% and implemented an aggressive monetary policy with a view to \nachieving this target as soon as possible. \nOn 29 January 2016, the BOJ took further steps and, to reach the 2% inflation target, \nintroduced a negative interest rate policy. From February 2016, the short-term interest \nrate became negative, which later affected the medium-term and long-term interest \nrates, which also became negative. This policy flattened the yield curve of JGBs, which \nthe BOJ did not expect to happen. Banks started to reduce the amount of government \nbonds  they purchased  because  the  interest rate  for short-term  government  bonds \nbecame negative, and even for long-term government bonds up to 15 years the interest \nrate became negative. \nSince 2013, on the liability side of the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet, the monetary base has \nincreased drastically by almost two and a half times as a result of the QQE policy. On \nthe asset side of the BOJ\u2019s balance sheet, JGB holdings have accumulated and the \nBOJ holdings in 2016 are more than three times the amount of JGB stock compared to \n2013. The total asset size of the BOJ in 2016 is almost two and a half times as large as \nin 2013. \nAlthough the BOJ drastically raised the monetary base during the last 3 years, the 2% \ninflation target could not be achieved, except for short periods, mainly in 2014. One of \nthe reasons behind the QQE policy\u2019s failureinachieving the 2% inflation target is the \ndrop in oil prices.  \nOil prices dropped from over$100 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $30 per barrel in \nFebruary 2016. In 2015, Japan imported over $80 billion of petroleum and petroleum \nproducts. Mineral fuel imports, including oil, made up 23% of total Japanese imports in \n2015. This means the price of oil has a significant impact on shaping general price \nlevels in Japan. \nAlthough the price of oil is presently less than half what it was in 2014, the BOJ is still \nkeeping the inflation target at 2%. While the price of oil is declining because of the \ndownward shift in aggregate supply, the equilibrium price level will be lower, meaning \nthe government needs to adjust the inflation target below the 2% level. \n   \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nThe BOJ introduced a negative interest rate policy, so that banks would withdraw \nexcess reserves from the central bank and increase lending to the corporate sector and \nhouseholds, stimulating aggregate demand, raising prices, and accelerating economic \ngrowth. Following the BOJ\u2019s negative interest rate policy, banks did indeed withdraw \nexcess reserves from the BOJ, but lending to the corporate sector did not increase. \nThis is due to the vertical IS curve. Because of the aging population, a shrinking labor \nforce, low participation of women in the workforce, a conservative banking system, less \nproductive local governments, low levels of technological development, slow growth in \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  startup  businesses  (Yoshino  and \nTaghizadeh\u2013Hesary 2014b, 2015c), the marginal productivity of capital is very low and \nthe corporate sector\u2019s interest in investment has decreased, causing the IS curve  \nto become vertical. This means that, although the BOJ is now strictly following the  \nQQE policy, it could neither boost the economy nor raise the prices. In other words, the \nproblems of the Japanese economy are structural and remedies could not be found  \nin monetary policy. The Japanese government needs to focus more on the growth \nstrategies of \u201cAbenomics\u201d (see Yoshino and Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary 2015b) rather than on \nmonetary policy.  \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 652  Yoshino, Taghizadeh\u2013Hesary, and Miyamoto \n \nREFERENCES \nBank of Japan. 2016.

But due to lower international oil prices, it was unable to achieve this target and was forced to take further measures. Hence, in February 2016, the BOJ adopted a negative interest rate policy by massively increasing the money supply through purchasing long-term Japanese government bonds (JGB). The BOJ had previously purchased short-term government bonds mainly, a policy that flattened the yield curve of JGBs. On the one hand, banks reduced the numbers of government bonds because short-term bond yields had become negative, and even the interest rates of long-term government bonds up to 15 years became negative. On the other hand, bank loans to the corporate sector did not increase due to the Japanese economy\u2019s vertical investment\u2013saving (IS) curve. Firstly, we explain why the BOJ has to reduce its 2% inflation target in the present low oil price era. Secondly, we argue that Japan cannot make a sustainable recovery from its long-lasting recession and tackle its long-standing deflation problem by means of its current monetary policy and its negative interest rate policy in particular. It is of key importance to make the IS curve downward sloping rather than vertical. That means the rate of return on investment must be positive and companies must be willing to invest if interest rates are set too low. Japan\u2019s long-term recession is due to structural problems that cannot be solved by its current monetary policy. The last section reports our simulation results of tackling Japan\u2019s aging population by introducing a productivity-based wage rate and postponement of the retirement age, which will help the recovery of the Japanese economy.", "Title": "The Effectiveness of Japan\u2019s Negative Interest Rate Policy"}}
