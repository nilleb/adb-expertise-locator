INTRODUCTION \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nAfter the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC), central banks in advanced countries \nimplemented  a  new  set  of  unconventional  monetary  policies  that  was  labeled  as \nquantitative easing (QE), credit easing, forward guidance policies, or negative interest \nrate. A number of studies suggested that the highly accommodative monetary policies \nhad  large  spillover  effects  on  the  rest  of  the  world,  especially  on  emerging  market \neconomies  (EMEs)  (see,  for  example,  Fratzscher  et  al.  [2013];  Chen  et  al.  [2014]; \nBowman et al. [2014]; Bauer and Neely [2014]; Rogers et al. [2014]; and Neely [2015]). \nIn particular, several authors found that unconventional monetary policies in advanced \ncountries  had  large  spillover  effects  on  emerging  Asian  economies,  which  might  be \nvulnerable  to  volatile  swings  in  currencies,  international  capital  flows,  and  increasing \nexternal debt levels (see, for example, Morgan [2011] and Park and Um [2016]).  \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  explore  what  spillover  effects  Japan\u2019s  unconventional  monetary \npolicy,  especially  the  negative  interest  rate  policy  (NIRP),  had  on  Asian  financial \nmarkets.  As  summarized  in  Table  1,  the  Bank  of  Japan  (BOJ)  adopted  a  series  of \nunconventional  monetary  policies  after  the  GFC.  But  after  the  introduction  of \nquantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) on 4 April 2013, the BOJ became \nmore  aggressive  in  its  unconventional  policy.  The  BOJ  expanded  the  QQE  on \n31 October  2014.  In  particular,  the  BOJ  introduced  \u201cQQE  with  a  Negative  Interest  \nRate\u201d  on  29  January  2016  and  \u201cQQE  with  Yield  Curve  Control\u201d  on  21  September \n2016 to  achieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2%  at  the  earliest  possible  time.  This  \npaper  investigates  how  different  spillover  effects  the  NIRP  in  2016  had  on  Asian \nfinancial markets. \n\nTable 1: Timeline of Japan\u2019s Unconventional Monetary Policy \n\nDate \n19 Dec 2008 \n\n18 Dec 2009 \n\n5 Oct 2010 \n22 Jan 2013 \n\n4 Apr 2013 \n\n31 Oct 2014 \n29 Jan 2016 \n\nDescription \n\nGovernor \n\nShirakawa \n\nLowering of the bank\u2019s target for the uncollateralized  \novernight call rate by 20 basis points; it will be encouraged \nto remain at around 0.1 % \nThe midpoints of most Policy Board members\u2019 \u201cunderstanding\u201d \nare around 1% CPI inflation rate \nComprehensive Monetary Easing \nThe \u201c2% Price Stability Target\u201d under the Framework for the \nConduct of Monetary Policy \nIntroduction of the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary \nEasing (QQE)\u201d \nExpansion of the Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing  Kuroda \nKuroda \nIntroduction of \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing \nwith a Negative Interest Rate\u201d \n\nKuroda \n\nShirakawa \n\nShirakawa \nShirakawa \n\n21 Sep 2016  New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing: \n\nKuroda \n\n\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve \nControl\u201d \n\nCPI = consumer price index. \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nAt the early phase of the QQE, several Asian EMEs showed serious concern about the \nyen\u2019s depreciation because of a potential beggar-thy-neighbor effect, which may result \nin  regional  competitive  devaluation.  However,  authors  such  as  Dekle  and  Hamada \n(2015) and Kawai (2015), pointed out that unlike the quantitative easing of the United \nStates (US), Japan\u2019s QQE without a negative interest rate may have positive spillover \neffects  on  the  rest  of  the  world.  In  particular,  Fukuda  (2016)  showed  that  it  benefited \nEast  Asian  economies  because  positive  spillover  effects  of  Japan\u2019s  stock  market \nrecovery dominated beggar-thy-neighbor effects in the region. But in earlier literature, it \nis not well known what spillover effects Japan\u2019s QQE with a negative interest rate had \non Asian financial markets. \n\nTo shed some light on this important policy issue, the following analysis explores what \nhappened  in  Asia\u2019s financial  markets  after the  introduction  of the  NIRP by  using  daily \ndata.  As  pointed  out  by  Fukuda  (2015),  the  QQE  initially  brought  about  the  yen\u2019s \ndramatic  depreciation  and  stock  price  recovery  in  Japan.  However,  unlike  the  QQE \nwithout  a  negative  interest  rate,  the  NIRP  had  limited  impacts  on  the  yen\u2013dollar \nexchange  rate  and  stock  prices  in  Japan.  Instead  it  had  substantial  impacts  on  \nlong-term  interest  rates  and  raised  a  concern  about  profitability  of  local  financial \ninstitutions. It is thus likely that the effects of the NIRP on Asian financial markets are \nvery different from those of the QQE without a negative interest rate. \n\nAfter giving an overview of the impacts of the NIRP on Japan\u2019s economy, the following \nanalysis  investigates  what  spillover  effects  Japan\u2019s  financial  market  shocks  had  on \nEast  Asian  financial  markets  before  and  after  the  introduction  of  the  NIRP.  In  the \nanalysis,  we  examine  spillover  effects  on  stock  markets  in  the  Republic  of  Korea; \nSingapore;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand. We  find  that  during  the  NIRP  period,  a  fall  in \nJapan\u2019s  long-term  interest  rate  significantly  increased  Asian  stock  prices  except \nthose at  the  Republic  of  Korea.  We  also  find  that  the  spillover  effects  in  the  NIRP \nperiod  were  especially  larger  through  a  decline  of  excess  returns  in  Japan\u2019s  finance \nsector.  The  results  imply  that  the  NIRP  that  lowered  the  long-term  rate  below  zero \nmight  have  benefited  emerging  Asian  economies.  We  discuss  that  this  might  have \nhappened  because  local  financial  institutions  who  lost  their  profit  opportunities  in \ndomestic  markets  explored  a  new  profit  opportunity  in  emerging  Asia  after  the \nintroduction of the NIRP. \n\n2.  IMPACTS OF THE NIRP ON JAPAN\u2019S ECONOMY \n\n2.1   The Difference between the QQE with and the QQE  \n\nwithout a Negative Interest Rate \n\nAfter the GFC, the BOJ adopted a series of unconventional monetary policies. Figure 1 \ndepicts  monthly  data  of  the  base  money  in  Japan  from  2007  to  2016.  Unlike  central \nbanks in other advanced countries, the base money had changed rather modestly until \n2012. However, it started to increase dramatically when the BOJ introduced the QQE in \nApril 2013. Its growth rate accelerated when the QQE was expanded in October 2014. \nHowever, regardless of the dramatic increases in the base money, the BOJ could not \nachieve  the  price  stability  target  of  2%.  Hence,  the  BOJ  introduced  a  new  framework \nfor strengthening monetary easing, that is, the NIRP on 29 January 2016. \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nFigure 1: Base Money in Japan from 2007 to 2016 \n\nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \n\nSource: Bank of Japan. \n\nFigure 2: Japanese Government Bond Yields \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\nWith the NIRP, the BOJ applied a negative interest rate of \u20130.1% to current accounts, \nwhich financial institutions hold at the BOJ. Its direct target was to make the policy rate, \nthat  is,  overnight  call  rate,  negative.  However,  the  NIRP  made  not  only  short-term \ninterest  rates  but  also  long-term  interest  rates  negative.  Figure  2  depicts  Japanese \ngovernment bond (JGB) yields since 2012. Due to a series of unconventional monetary \npolicies, short-term interest rates were close to zero even before the QQE. In contrast, \nlong-term  interest  rates  were  far  above  zero  in  January  2012,  although  they  had \nalready dropped to historically low levels. However, as the QQE progressed, the gaps \nbetween long-term and short-term interest rates had shrunk substantially. In particular, \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nafter  the  announcement  of  the  NIRP,  both  long-term  and  short-term  interest  rates  fell \nbelow zero and their gaps became negligible. \n\n2.2  Effects on the Exchange Rate and the Stock Prices \n\nThe  QQE  without  a  negative  interest  rate  brought  a  dramatic  depreciation  of  the  yen \n(see,  for  example,  Kano  2015).  The  yen\u2013dollar  rate,  which  had  been  around  \u00a580  per \nUS  dollar  in  2012,  depreciated  to  \u00a5102  per  dollar  on  15  May  2013.  The  expansion  of \nthe QQE on 31 October 2014 led to the yen\u2019s further depreciation, which had positive \neffects on the Japanese economy (see, for example, Shioji 2015). However, unlike the \nQQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRP had limited impacts on the yen\u2013dollar \nexchange rate.  \n\nFigure  3  depicts  hourly  data  of the  yen-denominated  dollar  exchange rate  before  and \nafter  the  announcement  of  the  four  types  of  QQEs:  the  introduction  of  the  QQE  on \n4 April 2013 (i.e., QQE1), the expansion of the QQE on 31 October 2014 (i.e., QQE2), \nthe introduction of QQE with a negative interest rate on 29 January 2016 (i.e., NIRP1), \nand  the  introduction  of  QQE  with  yield  curve  control on  21  September  2016  (i.e., \nNIRP2). In the figure, we define the latest hour before the BOJ\u2019s policy announcement \nby \u201c0 hour\u201d and normalize the exchange rate at the 0 hour to be 100. We then depict \nthe  hourly  yen\u2013dollar  exchange  rate  from  \u201325  hours  to  100  hours  for  the  four  types  \nof QQEs. \n\nFigure 3: Hourly Yen\u2013Dollar Exchange Rate after the Policy Announcements \n\nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n \n\nThe figure shows that depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate persisted in QQE1 \nand  QQE2  after  the  announcement.  This  implies  that  the  QQE  without  a  negative \ninterest rate brought about the dramatic depreciation of the yen. In contrast, the NIRP1 \nand the NIRP2 did not cause persistent depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate. \nThe  announcement  of  the  QQE  with  a  negative  interest  rate  on  29  January  2016 \n(i.e., NIRP1) caused depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate for the first 12 hours. \nBut  the  depreciation  was  only  temporary.  Unlike  in  QQE1  and  the  QQE2,  the  \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nyen\u2013dollar  exchange  rate  stopped  depreciating  after  the  first  12  hours  and  started  to \nappreciate after about 36 hours. The depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate was \nmuch  more  short-lived  after  the  introduction  of  the  QQE  with  yield  curve  control on \n21 September 2016 (i.e., NIRP2). The yen\u2013dollar exchange rate depreciated by 6% in \nthe first  1  hour  after the  policy  announcement. But  it  started  to  appreciate  in the  next \n1 hour  and  resulted  in  about  1.5%  appreciation  in  the  next  9  hours.  Regardless  of \nsubstantial  decline  in  long-term  interest  rates,  the  NIRP  had  no  persistent  impact  on \nthe yen\u2013dollar exchange rate. \n\nThe QQE without a negative interest rate brought dramatic recovery of stock prices in \nJapan. Japan\u2019s average stock price index (Nikkei 225), which stagnated around \u00a59,000 \nin 2012, rose up to \u00a515,000 on 15 May 2013. The expansion of the QQE on 31 October \n2014 led to further stock price recovery. However, unlike the QQE without a negative \ninterest rate, the NIRP had limited impact on Japan\u2019s stock prices.  \n\nFigure 4 depicts intra-daily data of the Nikkei 225 stock price index before and after the \nannouncement  of  the  four  types  of  QQEs:  the  QQE1  on  4  April  2013,  the  QQE2  on \n31 October  2014,  the  NIRP1  on  29  January  2016,  and  the  NIRP2 on  21  September \n2016. It depicts the stock price index for seven different time zones in each day: 9 a.m., \n9:15 a.m., 10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m. In the figure, we define \nthe latest time zone before the BOJ\u2019s policy announcement by \u201ctime 0\u201d and normalize \nthe stock price index at the time 0 to be 100. We then depict the intra-daily stock price \nindex  from  the  opening time  on the  day  before the  announcement  to  the  closing  time \non the sixth day after the announcement of the four types of QQEs.  \n\nFigure 4: Intra-Daily Data of the Nikkei 225 Stock Price Index \n\nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n \n\nThe figure shows that QQE1 and QQE2 caused persistent increases in the stock price \nindex  after  the  announcement.  This  implies  that  the  QQE  without  a  negative  interest \nrate  brought  dramatic  stock  price  increases  in  Japan.  In  contrast,  the  NIRP1  and  the \nNIRP2 did not cause persistent increases in the stock price index. The announcement \nof QQE  with  a  negative  interest  rate  on  29  January  2016  (i.e.,  NIRP1)  had  increased \nthe stock price index until the closing time of the next day. But the increases were only \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\ntemporary. Unlike in QQE1 and in QQE2, the stock price index stopped rising after the \nsecond  day  and started declining  in  the  afternoon  of the  second  day. The  stock  price \nincreases  were  much  more  short-lived  after  the  introduction  of  the  QQE  with  yield \ncurve control on 21 September 2016 (i.e., NIRP2). The stock price index increased by \n1.8% on the day of the policy announcement. But it started to decline the next day and \nreturned to the level before the announcement. \n\n2.3  Effects on Stock Prices \n\nUnlike the  QQE  without a  negative  interest  rate, the  NIRPs  had  limited  impact  on the \nyen\u2013dollar  exchange  rate  and  on Japan\u2019s  average stock  price  index.  However,  unlike \nthe QQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRPs had a large impact on the finance \nsector\u2019s  stock  prices  in  Japan.  After  the  announcement  of  the  NIRP,  the  finance \nsector\u2019s  stock  prices  declined  substantially.  Figure  5  depicts  excess  stock  returns  of \nJapan\u2019s finance sector after the announcement of the four types of QQEs. In the figure, \nexcess stock returns are defined by daily stock returns of the finance sector minus daily \nreturns of the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). Normalizing their value on the day of \nthe  policy  announcement  to  be  zero,  we  calculated  the  accumulated  excess  stock \nreturns of the finance sector in 5 business days, 10 business days, 15 business days, \nand  20  business  days  after  the  policy  announcement,  respectively.  The  figure  shows \nthat while QQE1 and QQE2 increased significant excess stock returns, the NIRP1 and \nthe NIRP2 caused persistent negative excess stock returns. The negative excess stock \nreturns were especially conspicuous in the NIRP1. \n\nFigure 5: Excess Stock Returns of Japan\u2019s Finance Sector \n\nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \n\nNote:  Excess  stock  returns  are  defined  by  daily  stock  returns  of  the  finance  sector  minus  daily  \nreturns  of  the  Tokyo  Stock  Price  Index  (TOPIX).  Normalizing  their  value  on  the  day  of  the  policy \nannouncement  to  zero,  we  calculated  their  accumulated  excess  stock  returns  after  the  policy \nannouncement. \n\n \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nThe negative excess stock returns reflect the fact that negative long-term interest rates \nin  the  NIRP  raised  a  serious  concern  about  profitability  of  financial  institutions.  The \nconcern had risen partly because its announcement was unexpected for most financial \ninstitutions  but  mostly  because  the  zero  bound  was  still  relevant  for  some  of  the \ninterest rates even in the NIRP. For example, bank lending rates declined significantly, \nwhile deposit rates did not. Most of the Japanese banks thus suffered from substantial \ndecline  in  their  lending  margins  when  long-term  interest  rates  fell  below  zero.  For  life \ninsurance  companies,  even  if  their  investment  returns  declined  substantially,  they \nneeded  to  guarantee  positive  nominal  returns  to  their  insurance  policy  holders. \nNegative  long-term  interest  rates  thus  squeezed  their  profits  significantly.  The \nintroduction  of  the  NIRPs  led  to  substantial  stock  price  declines  in  various  financial \ninstitutions in Japan.  \n\nFigure 6 depicts daily stock price indexes of the finance sector in Japan, four advanced \ncountries  (the  US,  the  United  Kingdom  [UK],  Germany,  and  France),  and  nine \neconomies  in  Asia  (the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  [PRC];  Hong  Kong,  China;  the \nRepublic  of  Korea;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  Thailand;  Malaysia;  Indonesia;  and  the \nPhilippines). It normalized the stock price indexes on 29 January 2016 to be 100 and \ndepicted  how  the  normalized  indexes  changed  from  29  January  2016  to  31  October \n2016. The figure shows that the stock price index of Japan\u2019s finance sector declined by \nnearly  20%  after  the  introduction  of  NIRP1  and  remained  low  throughout  the  period. \nReflecting the referendum on Brexit (withdrawal  of the UK from the European Union), \nthe  finance  sector\u2019s  stock  price  indexes  in  Europe  declined  in  late  June.  But  none \nof them  had  a  larger  decline  than  Japan.  More  importantly,  no  Asian  economies \nexperienced  significant  decline  in  their  finance  sector\u2019s  stock  price  index  during  the \nsample  period. Instead, many  of  Asia\u2019s finance sectors  experienced  steady  increases \nin their stock prices during the period. \n\nFigure 6: Daily Stock Price Indexes of the Finance Sector \n\n(1)  Advanced Countries \n\nUK = United Kingdom, US = United States. \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS.

However,  both  of  them  increased  stock  market  volatility \nsubstantially  in  Japan.  Figure  7  depicts  daily  data  of  the  Nikkei  225  VI  Futures  Index \n(Nikkei  VI)  and  the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  Volatility  Index  (VIX)  from \n1 March  2012  to  31  October  2016.  The  VIX,  which  is  a  popular  measure  of  the \nimplied volatility of the Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 index options and is often referred \nto  as  the  fear  index,  represents  a  measure  of  the  global  market\u2019s  expectation  of \nvolatility over  the  next  30-day  period.  The  Nikkei  VI  is  its  Japanese  version.  It  is \ndesigned to reflect the daily price fluctuation of a position that combines the near-term \nand  the  next-term  Nikkei  Stock  Average  Volatility  Index  Future  (Nikkei  225  VI  Future) \nprices at specified weights. It indicates how market participants expect the Nikkei 225 \nto fluctuate.  \n\nThe  daily  data,  which  is  downloaded  from  Datastream,  shows  that  the  Nikkei  VI \nbecame larger than the VIX not only after the introduction of the QQE1 on 4 April 2013 \nbut  also  after  the  announcement  of the  NIRP1  on  29  January  2016. This  implies  that \nboth  of  the  two  unconventional  monetary  policies  increased  stock  market  volatility \nsubstantially  in  Japan.  However,  while  the  increased  volatility  after  the  QQE1  was \naccompanied by dramatic stock price recovery, the increased volatility after the NIRP1 \ndid not. \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS.

In  summer  of  2012  when  the  global  market  risk  increased,  the  two  data \nshowed  opposite  movements.  But  the  Nikkei  VI  had  shown  very  strong  positive \ncorrelation with annual returns of the Nikkei 225 index from the end of 2012 to the end \nof  2015.  This  implies  that  both  QQE1  and  QQE2  not  only  brought  dramatic  recovery  \nof  stock  prices  but  also  increased  stock  market  volatility  in  Japan.  In  contrast,  the \nNikkei VI  had  very  strong  negative  correlation  with  annual  returns  of  the  Nikkei  225 \nindex after the announcement of the NIRP1. Unlike the QQE without a negative interest \nrate, the NIRP not only had negative impacts on the stock price but also increased its \nvolatility in Japan. \n\nFigure 8: The Nikkei VI and Annual Returns of Nikkei 225 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS.

EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \n\nUnlike  the  QQE  without  a  negative  interest  rate,  the  NIRP  had  limited  contributions  \nto  recovery  of  Japan\u2019s  economy  but  reduced  long-term  interest  rates  significantly.  In \nparticular, it raised a serious concern about profitability of local financial institutions in \nJapan  and  had  negative  impacts  on  stock  prices  of  Japan\u2019s  finance  sector.  It  is  thus \nlikely  that  its  spillover  effects  are  very  different  from  those  of  the  QQE  without  a \nnegative  interest  rate.  The  purpose  of  the  following  sections  is  to  explore  to  what \nspillover effects different from Japan\u2019s unconventional monetary policies had on Asian \nfinancial markets. \n\nTo investigate spillover effects on Asian financial markets, we explore how daily stock \nprices  in  Asian  emerging  economies  reacted  to  financial  shocks  in  Japan,  especially \nchanges  of  long-term  interest  rates,  for  alternative  monetary  policy  regimes.  For \nalternative subsample periods, we estimate the GARCH (1,1) model in order to capture \ndaily financial spillovers across advanced and emerging market economies in Asia.  \n\n = \uf061 + \n\n + \n\n + \n\n+ ut,  \n\n(1a) \n\n\ud835\udc3d\n\ud835\udc3b\n\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\n\u210e=1\n\ud835\udc57=0\n\u2211\n\u2211\n2 = \u03c6 + \u03b7 Residt-1\n\u03c3t\n\n\u210e\n\ud835\udefd\u210e\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\n2 + \u03bb \u03c3t-1\n\n\ud835\udc3e\n\ud835\udc58=1\n\u2211\n2 + \u03b5t, \n\n\ud835\udc3d\n\ud835\udc57=0\n\u2211\n\n\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc58\n\n\ud835\udc3d\n\ud835\udc3f\n\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc59=1\n\ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\n\u2211 \u2211\n\n\ud835\udc59\n\n(1b) \n\nwhere \nTaipei,China;  and  Thailand), \nAsian economy k (k = the PRC and Hong Kong, China), and \n\u210e\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61\nEurope or in the US. \n\n is  stock  returns  in  Asia\u2019s  economy  i  (i  =  Republic  of  Korea;  Singapore; \n is  stock  returns  in \n is  Japan\u2019s  financial  variable  h, \n is a financial variable in \n\n\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n\n\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\n\n Since our main interest is to explore spillover effects to Asian stock markets, we chose \nstock  returns  in  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand  as  a \ndependent variable. We chose these four Asian economies partly because they have a \ndeveloped  stock  market  but  partly  because  their  market  size  is  not  large  enough  to \nhave  significant  reverse  causality  to  Japan\u2019s  financial  variables.  The  country-specific \nequity  returns  refer  to  those  of  the  main  stock  market  index  in  local  currency,  that  is, \nthe  Seoul  Composite  Index;  Singapore  (SES)  Strait Times  Index; TWII, Tapei,China\u2019s \nweighted index; and Thailand SET-Index. \n\n\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n\nThe  set  of  explanatory  variables  consists  of  three  subsets.  The  first  subset  (\n)  is \nJapan\u2019s financial variables: daily change of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) \nyields,  daily  returns  of  the  Nikkei  225  stock  price  index,  and  daily  change  of  the  \ndollar-denominated  yen\u2019s  exchange  rate.  Unlike  QQE1  and  QQE2,  the  NIRP  had  a \nlimited impact on the Nikkei 225 stock price index and the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate but \nlarge impacts on long-term interest rates. It is important to explore what different effects \nthe 10-year JGB yields had before and after introducing the NIRP. \n\n\u210e\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61\n\n)\n\n\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n\nThe  second  subset  (\n is  daily  stock  returns  in  the  PRC  (i.e.,  Shanghai  SSEC)  and \n(i.e., Hang Seng Stock Index). Because of its remarkable development, the PRC now \nplays a critical role in Asian economies. It is thus likely that spillovers from stock prices \nin China to those in the other Asian economies have increased dramatically in 2000s, \nespecially  after  the  GFC.  In  addition,  from  December  2014  to  February  2016,  stock \nreturns  in  China  became  highly  volatile  reflecting  growth  slowdown  of  the  Chinese \neconomy. Including the second subset of variables captures the increasing role of the \nPRC in Asian financial markets. \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\n\ud835\udc59\n (\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n\nThe third subset\n) consists of daily stock returns in London and in New York (that is, \nthe  FTSE  100  and  Dow  Jones  Industrial),  daily  log  difference  of  the  VIX,  and  daily \ndifferenced  10-year  US  government  bond  yields.  These  variables  are  included  to \ncontrol the effects of common/systematic global factors. Since the European and New \nYork markets are open after Asia\u2019s financial markets are closed, we only included their \nlagged variables in the regressions.  \nThe estimation of the GARCH model is done with the number of lags set to one.1 The \nsample  starts  in  5  October  2010  when  the  BOJ  started  Comprehensive  Monetary \nEasing and ends in 20 September 2016 after which the BOJ announced the QQE with \nyield  curve  control. We split  the  sample  into four  subsample  periods:  pre-QQE  period \n(i.e., 5 October 2010 to 3 April 2013), the QQE1 period (i.e., 4 April 2013 to 30 October \n2014),  the  QQE2  period  (i.e.,  31  October  2014  to  28  January  2016),  and  the  NIRP1 \nperiod (i.e., 29 January 2016 to 20 September 2016). All daily data were downloaded \nfrom Datastream.  \n\n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS: STOCK PRICE SPILLOVERS \n\nTable  2  reports  the  estimation  results  for  the  four  alternative  subsample  periods. \nMost of  the  variables  in  the  second  subset  were  statistically  significant.  In  particular, \nalthough  the  Shanghai  stock  price  index  sometimes  took  a  negative  sign,  the \nHong Kong  stock  price  index  took  large  positive  values  in  all  of  the  estimated \nequations.  This  suggests  that  increased  positive  spillovers  from  the  PRC  economy \nmight be reflected mainly in stock prices in the Hong Kong, China market. The effects \nof  the  variables  in  the  third  subset  varied  across  the  economies  depending  on  the \nsample period. But the London and New York stock price indexes had a tendency to be \npositive.  The  VIX  and  10-year  US  bond  yields  took  a  negative  sign  in  several \nequations.  This  indicates  that  some  of  the  common/systematic  global  factors  had \nsignificant spillover effects on the Asian stock prices. However, even if we control these \nexternal  effects,  we  still  see  that  some  of  the  three  financial  variables  in  Japan  had \nsignificant  spillover  effects  on  the  stock  price  index  in  each  of  the  four  Asian \neconomies.  The  result  was  essentially  the  same  even  if  we  estimated  by  using \nalternative control variables or by adding more lagged variables.2 \n\nAmong  the  three  financial  variables  in  Japan  (i.e.,  the  10-year  JGB  yields,  the  Nikkei \n225  stock  price  index,  and  the  yen\u2013dollar  exchange  rate),  a  shock  in  Japan\u2019s  stock \nmarket had significantly positive impacts on the stock prices in Asian economies except \nin Thailand. In particular, the Nikkei stock price index took large positive values in the \nRepublic  of  Korea  throughout  the  subsample  periods.  This  indicates  a  strong  stock \nmarket  linkage  in  the  Asian  region.  However,  the  impacts  of  Japan\u2019s  stock  market \nshocks  were  different  depending  on  the  subsample  period.  They  were  largest  in  the \npre-QQE  period  in  Taipei,China  and  in  the  QQE2  period  in  Singapore.  But  they \nbecame modest in the NIRP1 period.

But  the  yen\u2019s  depreciation \nhad  significant  positive  spillover  effects  in  Singapore  in  the  QQE1  and  QQE2  periods \nand in Thailand in the QQE2 and NIRP1 periods. This implies that beggar-thy-neighbor \neffects  on  stock  prices were,  if  any,  limited  in the  Southeast  Asian  economies  even  if \nthe yen depreciated dramatically. \n\nThe  most  noteworthy  result  is  contrasting  effects  of  the  10-year  JGB  yields  on  the \nAsian  stock  prices  before  and  after  the  introduction  of  the  NIRP.  They  were,  if  any, \nlimited in most of the Asian economies before the NIRP was announced.3 This means \nthat  a  change  of  low  but  still  positive  long-term  interest  rate  in  Japan  had  limited \nspillover  effects  on  the  Asian  economies.  However,  except  in  the  Republic  of  Korea, \nthe  10-year  JGB  yields  took  a  significantly  negative  sign  in  the  NIRP1  period.  This \nmeans  that  a  decline  of  the  long-term  interest  rate  might  have  benefited  Asian \neconomies after the 10-year JGB yields fell below zero.  \n\nOne notable consequence of the NIRP was that not only short-term but also long-term \ninterest rates became negative. The prevailing negative long-term interest rates raised \na  serious  concern  about  profitability  of  local  financial  institutions  in  Japan.  Local \ncommercial  banks  experienced  substantial  decline  in  the  margin  between  domestic \nlending  rates  and  deposit  rates.  Local  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance \ncompanies,  trust  funds,  and  pension  funds,  lost  their  profit  opportunities  in  domestic \nmarkets. Many of them thus needed to explore a new profit opportunity outside Japan. \nFinancial  markets  in  emerging  Asia  were their  natural  choices. They  are  still  risky  but \npotentially  highly  profitable  investment  destinations.  It  is  likely  that  their  changed \ninvestment behavior benefited Asian economies, especially their finance sector. \n\nThe  exception  was the Republic  of  Korea.  In the  Republic  of  Korea, the  10-year  JGB \nyields  were  not  statistically  significant  in  the  NIRP1  period,  while  both  the  Nikkei  225 \nstock price index and the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate took a significantly positive sign in \nthe NIRP1 period. This might have happened because of strong trade linkage but weak \nfinancial  market  linkage  between  the  two  countries.  Because  of  its  economic \ndevelopment,  further  growth  potential  in  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  economy  might  be \nmore  limited  than  those  in  other  emerging  Asian  countries.  It  is  thus  likely  that \nJapanese financial institutions did not explore a new profit opportunity in the Republic \nof Korea. \n\nFigure  9  depicts  accumulated  returns  of  the  stock  price  indexes  in  the  Republic  \nof  Korea;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand  before  and  after  the  NIRP1 \nannouncement. For comparison, it also depicts the 10-year JGB yields during the same \nperiod.  We  normalized  the  accumulated  returns  on  29  January  2016  to  be  zero  and \ndepicted  how  the  accumulated  returns  changed  after  the  NIRP1  announcement.  In \nthe figure,  the  accumulated  returns  increased  only  modestly  soon  after  the  NIRP1 \nannouncement  even  though  the  10-year  JGB  yields  dropped  sharply  to  almost  zero.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n3   The  simultaneous  effect  of  10-year  JGB  yields  on  the  stock  price  was  significantly  negative  in  the \nRepublic of Korea in the QQE1 period and in Thailand in the QQE2 period. But since the lagged effect \nwas positive in both cases, the total effect was never significant before the NIRP1 period. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nHowever,  they  started  to  increase  substantially  after  the  20th  business  day  when  the \n10-year  JGB  yields  fell  below  zero  persistently.  The  increased  accumulated  returns \nwere  very  modest  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  But  the  increased  accumulated  returns \namounted to nearly 10% in the other three Asian economies.4 They are consistent with \nthe view that Asian stock prices welcomed negative long-term interest rates in Japan. \n\nFigure 9: Accumulated Returns in the Four Asian Economies  \nand Japanese Government Bond Yields \n\nJGB = Japanese government bond. \n\nNote:  Left  axis  shows  the  unit  of  accumulated  returns  and  the  right  axis  shows  the  unit  of  10-year  \nJGB yields. \n\nSource: Datastream. \n\n \n\n5.  ESTIMATION RESULTS USING EXCESS STOCK \nRETURNS OF JAPAN\u2019S FINANCE SECTOR \n\nIn  the  last  section,  we  found  that  except  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the  10-year  JGB \nyields, which had shown no significant impacts before the announcement of the NIRP, \ntook  significantly  negative  effects  on  Asian  stock  prices  in  the  NIRP1  period.  This \nmeans that lowering long-term interest rates below zero in Japan might have benefited \nAsian  economies  except  the  Republic  of  Korea.  We  conjectured  that  this  might  \nhave  happened  because  local  financial  institutions  who  lost  their  profit  opportunities  \nin  domestic  markets  explored  new  profit  opportunities  in  emerging  Asia  after  the \nNIRP announcement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n4   During  the  same  period,  stock  prices  in  the  PRC  and  in  Hong  Kong,  China  showed  no  persistent \nchanges.  This  indicates that we  cannot  attribute the  dramatic  increases  in  accumulated  returns  to  the \neffects of the PRC\u2019s economy. \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  examine  the  validity  of  this  conjecture  through \nexploring whether the NIRP benefited Asian economies because of its negative impact \non  Japan\u2019s finance  sector.  Specifically,  using  excess  stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance \nsector,  which  was  explained  by  the  JGB  yields  as  a  new  explanatory  variable,  we \ninvestigate how daily responses of the Asian sector\u2019s stock prices changed before and \nafter the introduction of the NIRP.  \n\nIn the analysis, we define excess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector, ERt, by daily \nstock  returns  of  Japan\u2019s  finance  sector  minus  daily  stock  returns  of  Nikkei  225.  To \ncalculate how the JGB yields explain the excess stock returns, we then run OLS, which \nregresses ERt on current and lagged value of the 10-year JGB yields, JGBt, as follows: \n\n(2) \n\nERt = \u03b8 + \n\n + \u03bdt, \n\n\ud835\udc3d\n\ud835\udc57=0\n\u2211\n\n\ud835\udf07\u210e\n\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\n\nExcess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector, which are explained by the JGB yields, \nare  the  fitted  value  of  ERt  in  the  four  alternative  subsample  periods:  the  pre-QQE \nperiod,  the  QQE1  period,  the  QQE2  period,  and  the  NIRP1  period.  That  is,  denoting \nthe  estimated  coefficients  by  \u03b8\n,  we  calculate  the  excess  stock  returns \nexplained  by  the  NIRP  as \n for  each  alternative  subsample \n\u210e \ufffd\n\ud835\udc3d\n in  the  explanatory \nperiod.  Except  that  we  replace  the  10-year  JGB  yields  by \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ufffd\n\ud835\udc57=0\n\u2211\nvariables,  the  estimated  GARCH  (1,1)  equations  are  the  same  as  those  in  previous \nsections. We estimate the model for the four alternative subsample periods. Comparing \nthe  estimation  results  across  different  monetary  policy  regimes,  we  examine  how  the \nintroduction of the NIRP changed stock price responses in the Asian economies.  \n\n and  \u00b5\n + \n\n \u2261 \u03b8\n \ufffd\n\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\n\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ufffd\n\n\ud835\udf07\u210e\ufffd\n\n \ufffd\n\nAs  in  the  last  section,  all  of  the  data  were  downloaded  from  Datastream.  Table  3 \nreports the estimation results. Except for the excess returns, the estimated coefficients \nwere  essentially  the  same  as  those  in  the  last  section.  That  is,  many  of  the  control \nvariables were statistically significant. Among the three financial variables in Japan, the \nNikkei  stock  price  index  took  significantly  positive  values  except  in  Thailand.  The  \nyen\u2013dollar exchange rate took large positive values in the Republic of Korea in most of \nthe subsample periods. \n\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ufffd\n\nThe  most  noteworthy result  is  the  effects  of \n before  and  after the  NIRP period.  As \ndid  the  10-year  JGB  yields,  they  had  contrasting  features  before  and  after  the  NIRP \nperiod.  In  the  pre-NIRP  periods,  they  were  small  and  insignificant  in  all  of  the  Asian \neconomies  except  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  in  the  QQE1  period.  This  means  that  a \nchange of excess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector had no spillover effect on the \nAsian finance sectors when long-term interest rates were low but still positive in Japan. \nIn  contrast,  except  for  the  Republic  of  Korea,  its  spillover  effects  on  the  Asian \neconomies became larger and more significant in the NIRP1 period. In particular, they \nwere  significantly  negative.  This  means  that  when  negative  long-term  rates  reduced \nexcess  stock  returns  of  Japan\u2019s  finance  sector  in  Japan,  the  Asian  stock  prices \nincreased  except  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.

EFFECTS OF THE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE \n\nPOLICY ON ADVANCED ECONOMIES \n\nUntil the last section, we found that except in the Republic of Korea, the 10-year JGB \nyields, which had shown no significant impact in the pre-NIRP period, had significantly \nnegative  effects  on  Asian  stock  prices  in  the  NIRP1  period.  We  conjectured  that  this \nmight  have  happened  because  Japanese  financial  institutions  explored  a  new  profit \nopportunity in emerging Asia after the announcement of the NIRP.  \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  investigate  whether  the  NIRP  in  Japan  had  similar \nspillover effects on stock prices in advanced economies. Specifically, using daily stock \nprice  data  in  the  UK,  Germany,  and  the  US,  we  examine  how  the  stock  prices \nresponded  to  Japan\u2019s  financial  shocks  in  the  NIRP  period.  In  the  estimation,  we  use \ndaily returns of the FTSE 100 in the UK, the DAX 30 in Germany, and the Dow Jones \nIndustrial  in  the  US  as  a  dependent  variable.  Except  for  the  dependent  variable,  the \nestimated  equations  are  essentially  the  same  as  those  in  previous  sections.  But  we \ndropped  the  second  subset  of  control  variables,  that  is,  those  in  the  PRC,  in  the \nregressions  because  they  were  not  significant.  We  also  allowed  some  simultaneous \nfrom \nfeedback  across  advanced  economies.  All  daily  data  were  downloaded \nDatastream. \n\nTable 4: Estimation Results for Stock Prices in Advanced Economies \n\n \n\n \n\nUK \n\nGermany \n\nUS \n\nz-Statistic \n\nCoef. \n\nz-Statistic \n\nz-Statistic \n\n  \n\nConstant \n\n \n\nVariable \n\nJapan  \nfinancial \nshocks \n\nJGB yields \nJGB yields(-1) \n\nNikkei 225 \n\nNikkei 225(-1) \n\nYen \n\nYen(-1) \n\nControl \nvariables \n\nLondon Stock \nLondon Stock(-1) \n\nFrench Stock(-1) \n\nNY stock(-1) \n\nVIX(-1) \n\nUS yields(-1) \n\nC \nRESID(-1)^2 \n\nGARCH(-1) \n\nR-squared \n\nAdjusted R-sq. \n\nVariance  \nequation \n\n \n\nCoef. \n\n0.001 \n\n\u20130.013 \n\u20130.004 \n\n0.116 \n\n0.045 \n\n\u20130.139 \n\n0.090 \n\n \n\u20130.077 \n\n0.278 \n\n0.255 \n\n\u20130.020 \n\n\u20130.032 \n\n0.000 \n0.184 \n\n0.715 \n\n0.215 \n\n0.154 \n\n0.80 \n\n\u20130.39 \n\u20130.12 \n\n1.94* \n\n0.76 \n\n\u20131.30 \n\n0.86 \n\n \n\u20130.55 \n\n1.24 \n\n1.30 \n\n\u20131.17 \n\n\u20131.78* \n\n1.43 \n1.67* \n\n5.21*** \n\n \n\n \n\nGerman Stock(-1) \n\n\u20130.342 \n\n\u20131.82* \n\n0.001 \n\n0.004 \n0.029 \n\n0.255 \n\n0.164 \n\n\u20130.367 \n\n0.133 \n\n \n\u20130.007 \n\n\u20130.495 \n\n0.319 \n\n0.508 \n\n0.002 \n\n\u20130.038 \n\n0.000 \n0.090 \n\n0.850 \n\n0.290 \n\n0.235 \n\n0.76 \n\n0.09 \n0.76 \n\n3.85*** \n\n2.21** \n\n\u20132.93*** \n\n0.87 \n\n \n\u20130.04 \n\n\u20132.00** \n\n1.25 \n\n2.10** \n\n0.10 \n\n\u20131.40 \n\n0.80 \n1.47 \n\n8.42*** \n\nCoef. \n\n0.001 \n\n0.017 \n\u20130.002 \n\n\u20130.020 \n\n0.037 \n\n\u20130.205 \n\n0.020 \n\n0.416 \n0.083 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u20130.200 \n\n0.006 \n\n\u20130.008 \n\n0.000 \n0.253 \n\n0.670 \n\n0.523 \n\n0.489 \n\n1.49 \n\n0.98 \n\u20130.15 \n\n\u20130.82 \n\n1.23 \n\n\u20134.91*** \n\n0.35 \n\n11.23*** \n1.36 \n\n \n\n \n\n\u20131.71* \n\n0.70 \n\n\u20130.82 \n\n1.29 \n1.96* \n\n4.32*** \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* = significant at 10%, ** = significant at 5%, *** = significant at 1%. \n\nJGB = Japanese government bond, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States, VIX = volatility index. \nJGB yields \u2261 daily change of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, Nikkei 225 \u2261 daily returns of the Nikkei \n225  stock  price index,  yen  \u2261  daily change  of  the  dollar-denominated  yen\u2019s  exchange  rate,  London stock \u2261  daily stock \nreturns of FTSE 100, German stock \u2261 daily stock returns of DAX 30 in Germany, French stock \u2261 daily stock returns of \nCAC  40  in  France,  NY stock  \u2261  daily stock  returns  of  Dow  Jones  Industrials, VIX  \u2261  daily  log-difference  of  the VIX,  US \nyields \u2261 daily change of the 10-year US government bond yields, RESID(-1)^2 \u2261 squared lagged residual, and GARCH \n\u2261 contemporary variance. \nSource: Author\u2019s calculation. \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS. Fukuda \n\nWe  estimate  the  GARCH  (1,1)  model  for  the  NIRP1  period.  Table  4  reports  the \nestimation results. As in the last section, many of the control variables were statistically \nsignificant.  However,  even  if  we  control  these  external  effects,  we  still  see  that  the \nNikkei  stock  price  index  and  the  yen\u2013dollar  exchange  rate  had  significant  spillover \neffects  on  the  stock  price  responses  in  each  of  the  three  advanced  economies.  The \nNikkei  stock  price  index had  a  large  positive  effect  on  the Germany  stock  price  index \nand a marginally significant positive effect on the UK stock price index. The yen\u2013dollar \nexchange rate had a large negative effect both on the Germany stock price index and \non the US stock price index. This indicates that a strong yen might have had a negative \neffect on stock prices in the two economies.  \n\nHowever, unlike in Asian stock markets, the 10-year JGB yields never had a significant \neffect on the stock prices in the advanced economies in the NIRP period. This means \nthat  unlike  in  Asia,  a  decline  of  long-term  interest  rates  below  zero  in  Japan  did  not \nbenefit  the  advanced  economies.  In  the  NIRP  period,  the  changed  behavior  of \nJapanese financial institutions might have benefited many Asian economies. But when \nexploring  a  new  profit  opportunity  outside  Japan,  financial  markets  in  advanced \neconomies were not attractive investment destinations because their long-term interest \nrates had already fallen enough.  \n\n7.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\nIn  this  paper,  we  explored  what  spillover  effects  Japan\u2019s  negative  interest  rate  policy \n(NIRP)  had  on  Asian  stock  markets.  Unlike  the  QQE  without  a  negative  interest  rate, \nthe  QQE  with  a  negative  interest  rate  had  limited  impact  on  the  Japanese  economy. \nHowever,  the  NIRP  brought  various  undesirable  consequences  to  the  Japanese \neconomy,  especially  to  its  finance  sector.  It  is  thus  likely  that  its  spillover  effects  are \nvery  different  from  those  of  the  QQE  without  a  negative  interest  rate.  Our  empirical \nresult  suggested  that  spillovers  from  Japan\u2019s  financial  shocks  to  Asian  stock  markets \nhad contrasting features in the NIRP period, which were not observed in the pre-QQE \nor  the  QQE  periods.  In  particular,  they  showed  that  the  NIRP  might  have  benefited \nAsian economies through a decline of excess returns in Japan\u2019s finance sector. \n\nOne notable consequence of the NIRP was that not only short-term but also long-term \ninterest  rates  became  negative.  Under  prevailing  negative  long-term  interest  rates, \nmost  of  the  Japanese  local  financial  institutions  lost  their  profit  opportunities  in \ndomestic markets. They thus needed to explore a new profit opportunity outside Japan. \nFigure  10  shows  the  amount  of  net  purchases  of  foreign  long-term  securities  by \nJapanese life insurance companies from 2005 to 2016. Until January 2016, the monthly \namount had usually been less than \u00a550 billion and rarely exceeded \u00a5100 billion. But the \namount  soared  up  dramatically  in  February  2016  and  remained  high.  Such  large  and \npersistent  net  purchases  never  happened  during  the  last  decade.  This  implies  that \nJapanese  life  insurance  companies  that  lost  investment  opportunities  in  domestic \nmarkets  expanded  their  investment  to  foreign  markets  after  the  announcement  of \nthe NIRP. \n\nWhen exploring a new profit opportunity outside Japan, financial markets in emerging \nAsia,  rather  than  those  in  advanced  economies,  were  their  natural  choices.  They  are \nstill  risky  but  potentially  highly  profitable  investment  destinations.  It  is  likely  that  their \nchanged  investment  behavior  benefited  Asian  economies,  especially  their  finance \nsector. Our empirical results supported the view. \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nS.

In order to mitigate a concern among \nlocal financial institutions, the BOJ introduced the QQE with yield curve control (NIRP2) \non  21  September  2016.  Even  in  the  NIRP2,  short-term  interest  rates  remained \nsignificantly  negative.  But  unlike  in  the  NIRP1,  long-term  interest  rates  increased  to \nzero  in  the  NIRP2.  Because  of  limited  sample  size,  we  could  not  estimate  spillover \neffects in the NIRP2. But it is likely that in the NIRP2, we may no longer see beneficial \nspillover effects on Asian economies. \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 707 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nS.

Unlike  the  quantitative  and  qualitative \nmonetary  easing  (QQE)  without  a  negative  interest  rate,  the  NIRP  not  only  had  limited \nimpacts  on  Japan\u2019s  economy  but  also  raised  a  serious  concern  about  profitability  of  local \nfinancial institutions.
