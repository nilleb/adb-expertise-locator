INTRODUCTION \nAfter the 2007\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC), central banks in advanced countries \nimplemented  a  new  set  of  unconventional  monetary  policies  that  was  labeled  as \nquantitative easing (QE), credit easing, forward guidance policies, or negative interest \nrate. A number of studies suggested that the highly accommodative monetary policies \nhad large spillover effects on the rest of the world, especially on emerging market \neconomies (EMEs) (see, for example, Fratzscher et al. [2013]; Chen et al. [2014]; \nBowman et al. [2014]; Bauer and Neely [2014]; Rogers et al. [2014]; and Neely [2015]). \nIn particular, several authors found that unconventional monetary policies in advanced \ncountries had large spillover effects on emerging Asian economies, which might be \nvulnerable to volatile swings in currencies, international capital flows, and increasing \nexternal debt levels (see, for example, Morgan [2011] and Park and Um [2016]).  \nIn  this  paper,  we  explore  what  spillover  effects  Japan\u2019s  unconventional  monetary \npolicy,  especially  the  negative  interest  rate  policy  (NIRP),  had  on  Asian  financial \nmarkets. As summarized in Table 1, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) adopted a series of \nunconventional  monetary  policies  after  the  GFC.  But  after  the  introduction  of \nquantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) on 4 April 2013, the BOJ became \nmore  aggressive  in  its  unconventional  policy.  The  BOJ  expanded  the  QQE  on \n31 October 2014. In particular, the BOJ introduced \u201cQQE with a Negative Interest  \nRate\u201d on 29 January 2016 and \u201cQQE with Yield Curve Control\u201d on 21 September \n2016 to achieve the price stability target of 2% at the earliest possible time. This  \npaper  investigates  how  different  spillover  effects  the  NIRP  in  2016  had  on  Asian \nfinancial markets. \nTable 1: Timeline of Japan\u2019s Unconventional Monetary Policy \nDate  Description  Governor \n19 Dec 2008  Lowering of the bank\u2019s target for the uncollateralized   Shirakawa \novernight call rate by 20 basis points; it will be encouraged \nto remain at around 0.1 % \n18 Dec 2009  The midpoints of most Policy Board members\u2019 \u201cunderstanding\u201d  Shirakawa \nare around 1% CPI inflation rate \n5 Oct 2010  Comprehensive Monetary Easing  Shirakawa \n22 Jan 2013  The \u201c2% Price Stability Target\u201d under the Framework for the  Shirakawa \nConduct of Monetary Policy \n4 Apr 2013  Introduction of the \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary  Kuroda \nEasing (QQE)\u201d \n31 Oct 2014  Expansion of the Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing  Kuroda \n29 Jan 2016  Introduction of \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing  Kuroda \nwith a Negative Interest Rate\u201d \n21 Sep 2016  New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing:  Kuroda \n\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve \nControl\u201d \nCPI = consumer price index. \nSource: Bank of Japan. \n   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nAt the early phase of the QQE, several Asian EMEs showed serious concern about the \nyen\u2019s depreciation because of a potential beggar-thy-neighbor effect, which may result \nin regional competitive devaluation. However, authors such as Dekle and Hamada \n(2015) and Kawai (2015), pointed out that unlike the quantitative easing of the United \nStates (US), Japan\u2019s QQE without a negative interest rate may have positive spillover \neffects on the rest of the world. In particular, Fukuda (2016) showed that it benefited \nEast  Asian  economies  because  positive  spillover  effects  of  Japan\u2019s  stock  market \nrecovery dominated beggar-thy-neighbor effects in the region. But in earlier literature, it \nis not well known what spillover effects Japan\u2019s QQE with a negative interest rate had \non Asian financial markets. \nTo shed some light on this important policy issue, the following analysis explores what \nhappened in Asia\u2019s financial markets after the introduction of the NIRP by using daily \ndata. As pointed out by Fukuda (2015), the QQE initially brought about the yen\u2019s \ndramatic depreciation and stock price recovery in Japan. However, unlike the QQE \nwithout  a  negative  interest  rate,  the  NIRP  had  limited  impacts  on  the  yen\u2013dollar \nexchange  rate  and  stock  prices  in  Japan.  Instead  it  had  substantial  impacts  on  \nlong-term  interest  rates  and  raised  a  concern  about  profitability  of  local  financial \ninstitutions. It is thus likely that the effects of the NIRP on Asian financial markets are \nvery different from those of the QQE without a negative interest rate. \nAfter giving an overview of the impacts of the NIRP on Japan\u2019s economy, the following \nanalysis investigates what spillover effects Japan\u2019s financial market shocks had on \nEast Asian financial markets before and after the introduction of the NIRP. In the \nanalysis, we examine spillover effects on stock markets in the Republic of Korea; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand. We find that during the NIRP period, a fall in \nJapan\u2019s  long-term  interest  rate  significantly  increased  Asian  stock  prices  except \nthose at the Republic of Korea. We also find that the spillover effects in the NIRP \nperiod were especially larger through a decline of excess returns in Japan\u2019s finance \nsector. The results imply that the NIRP that lowered the long-term rate below zero \nmight have benefited emerging Asian economies. We discuss that this might have \nhappened  because  local  financial  institutions  who  lost  their  profit  opportunities  in \ndomestic  markets  explored  a  new  profit  opportunity  in  emerging  Asia  after  the \nintroduction of the NIRP. \n2.  IMPACTS OF THE NIRP ON JAPAN\u2019S ECONOMY \n2.1   The Difference between the QQE with and the QQE  \nwithout a Negative Interest Rate \nAfter the GFC, the BOJ adopted a series of unconventional monetary policies. Figure 1 \ndepicts monthly data of the base money in Japan from 2007 to 2016. Unlike central \nbanks in other advanced countries, the base money had changed rather modestly until \n2012. However, it started to increase dramatically when the BOJ introduced the QQE in \nApril 2013. Its growth rate accelerated when the QQE was expanded in October 2014. \nHowever, regardless of the dramatic increases in the base money, the BOJ could not \nachieve the price stability target of 2%. Hence, the BOJ introduced a new framework \nfor strengthening monetary easing, that is, the NIRP on 29 January 2016. \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nFigure 1: Base Money in Japan from 2007 to 2016 \n \nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \nSource: Bank of Japan. \nFigure 2: Japanese Government Bond Yields \n \nSource: Datastream. \nWith the NIRP, the BOJ applied a negative interest rate of \u20130.1% to current accounts, \nwhich financial institutions hold at the BOJ. Its direct target was to make the policy rate, \nthat is, overnight call rate, negative. However, the NIRP made not only short-term \ninterest rates but also long-term interest rates negative. Figure 2 depicts Japanese \ngovernment bond (JGB) yields since 2012. Due to a series of unconventional monetary \npolicies, short-term interest rates were close to zero even before the QQE. In contrast, \nlong-term  interest  rates  were  far  above  zero  in  January  2012,  although  they  had \nalready dropped to historically low levels. However, as the QQE progressed, the gaps \nbetween long-term and short-term interest rates had shrunk substantially. In particular, \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nafter the announcement of the NIRP, both long-term and short-term interest rates fell \nbelow zero and their gaps became negligible. \n2.2  Effects on the Exchange Rate and the Stock Prices \nThe QQE without a negative interest rate brought a dramatic depreciation of the yen \n(see, for example, Kano 2015). The yen\u2013dollar rate, which had been around \u00a580 per \nUS dollar in 2012, depreciated to \u00a5102 per dollar on 15 May 2013. The expansion of \nthe QQE on 31 October 2014 led to the yen\u2019s further depreciation, which had positive \neffects on the Japanese economy (see, for example, Shioji 2015). However, unlike the \nQQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRP had limited impacts on the yen\u2013dollar \nexchange rate.  \nFigure 3 depicts hourly data of the yen-denominated dollar exchange rate before and \nafter the announcement of the four types of QQEs: the introduction of the QQE on \n4 April 2013 (i.e., QQE1), the expansion of the QQE on 31 October 2014 (i.e., QQE2), \nthe introduction of QQE with a negative interest rate on 29 January 2016 (i.e., NIRP1), \nand the introduction of QQE with yield curve control on 21 September 2016 (i.e., \nNIRP2). In the figure, we define the latest hour before the BOJ\u2019s policy announcement \nby \u201c0 hour\u201d and normalize the exchange rate at the 0 hour to be 100. We then depict \nthe hourly yen\u2013dollar exchange rate from \u201325 hours to 100 hours for the four types  \nof QQEs. \nFigure 3: Hourly Yen\u2013Dollar Exchange Rate after the Policy Announcements \n \nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \nSource: Datastream. \nThe figure shows that depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate persisted in QQE1 \nand QQE2 after the announcement. This implies that the QQE without a negative \ninterest rate brought about the dramatic depreciation of the yen. In contrast, the NIRP1 \nand the NIRP2 did not cause persistent depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate. \nThe announcement of the QQE with a negative interest rate on 29 January 2016 \n(i.e., NIRP1) caused depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate for the first 12 hours. \nBut  the  depreciation  was  only  temporary.  Unlike  in  QQE1  and  the  QQE2,  the  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nyen\u2013dollar exchange rate stopped depreciating after the first 12 hours and started to \nappreciate after about 36 hours. The depreciation of the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate was \nmuch more short-lived after the introduction of the QQE with yield curve control on \n21 September 2016 (i.e., NIRP2). The yen\u2013dollar exchange rate depreciated by 6% in \nthe first 1 hour after the policy announcement. But it started to appreciate in the next \n1 hour and resulted in about 1.5% appreciation in the next 9 hours. Regardless of \nsubstantial decline in long-term interest rates, the NIRP had no persistent impact on \nthe yen\u2013dollar exchange rate. \nThe QQE without a negative interest rate brought dramatic recovery of stock prices in \nJapan. Japan\u2019s average stock price index (Nikkei 225), which stagnated around \u00a59,000 \nin 2012, rose up to \u00a515,000 on 15 May 2013. The expansion of the QQE on 31 October \n2014 led to further stock price recovery. However, unlike the QQE without a negative \ninterest rate, the NIRP had limited impact on Japan\u2019s stock prices.  \nFigure 4 depicts intra-daily data of the Nikkei 225 stock price index before and after the \nannouncement of the four types of QQEs: the QQE1 on 4 April 2013, the QQE2 on \n31 October 2014, the NIRP1 on 29 January 2016, and the NIRP2 on 21 September \n2016. It depicts the stock price index for seven different time zones in each day: 9 a.m., \n9:15 a.m., 10 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m. In the figure, we define \nthe latest time zone before the BOJ\u2019s policy announcement by \u201ctime 0\u201d and normalize \nthe stock price index at the time 0 to be 100. We then depict the intra-daily stock price \nindex from the opening time on the day before the announcement to the closing time \non the sixth day after the announcement of the four types of QQEs.  \nFigure 4: Intra-Daily Data of the Nikkei 225 Stock Price Index \n \nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \nSource: Datastream. \nThe figure shows that QQE1 and QQE2 caused persistent increases in the stock price \nindex after the announcement. This implies that the QQE without a negative interest \nrate brought dramatic stock price increases in Japan. In contrast, the NIRP1 and the \nNIRP2 did not cause persistent increases in the stock price index. The announcement \nof QQE with a negative interest rate on 29 January 2016 (i.e., NIRP1) had increased \nthe stock price index until the closing time of the next day. But the increases were only \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \ntemporary. Unlike in QQE1 and in QQE2, the stock price index stopped rising after the \nsecond day and started declining in the afternoon of the second day. The stock price \nincreases were much more short-lived after the introduction of the QQE with yield \ncurve control on 21 September 2016 (i.e., NIRP2). The stock price index increased by \n1.8% on the day of the policy announcement. But it started to decline the next day and \nreturned to the level before the announcement. \n2.3  Effects on Stock Prices \nUnlike the QQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRPs had limited impact on the \nyen\u2013dollar exchange rate and on Japan\u2019s average stock price index. However, unlike \nthe QQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRPs had a large impact on the finance \nsector\u2019s  stock  prices  in  Japan.  After  the  announcement  of  the  NIRP,  the  finance \nsector\u2019s stock prices declined substantially. Figure 5 depicts excess stock returns of \nJapan\u2019s finance sector after the announcement of the four types of QQEs. In the figure, \nexcess stock returns are defined by daily stock returns of the finance sector minus daily \nreturns of the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). Normalizing their value on the day of \nthe policy announcement to be zero, we calculated the accumulated excess stock \nreturns of the finance sector in 5 business days, 10 business days, 15 business days, \nand 20 business days after the policy announcement, respectively. The figure shows \nthat while QQE1 and QQE2 increased significant excess stock returns, the NIRP1 and \nthe NIRP2 caused persistent negative excess stock returns. The negative excess stock \nreturns were especially conspicuous in the NIRP1. \nFigure 5: Excess Stock Returns of Japan\u2019s Finance Sector \n \nNIRP = negative interest rate policy, QQE = quantitative and qualitative monetary easing. \nNote: Excess stock returns are defined by daily stock returns of the finance sector minus daily  \nreturns of the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). Normalizing their value on the day of the policy \nannouncement to zero, we calculated their accumulated excess stock returns after the policy \nannouncement. \nSource: Datastream. \n   \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nThe negative excess stock returns reflect the fact that negative long-term interest rates \nin the NIRP raised a serious concern about profitability of financial institutions. The \nconcern had risen partly because its announcement was unexpected for most financial \ninstitutions  but  mostly  because the  zero  bound  was  still  relevant for  some  of the \ninterest rates even in the NIRP. For example, bank lending rates declined significantly, \nwhile deposit rates did not. Most of the Japanese banks thus suffered from substantial \ndecline in their lending margins when long-term interest rates fell below zero. For life \ninsurance  companies,  even  if  their  investment  returns  declined  substantially,  they \nneeded  to  guarantee  positive  nominal  returns  to  their  insurance  policy  holders. \nNegative  long-term  interest  rates  thus  squeezed  their  profits  significantly.  The \nintroduction of the NIRPs led to substantial stock price declines in various financial \ninstitutions in Japan.  \nFigure 6 depicts daily stock price indexes of the finance sector in Japan, four advanced \ncountries  (the  US,  the  United  Kingdom  [UK],  Germany,  and  France),  and  nine \neconomies in Asia (the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC]; Hong Kong, China; the \nRepublic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; Malaysia; Indonesia; and the \nPhilippines). It normalized the stock price indexes on 29 January 2016 to be 100 and \ndepicted how the normalized indexes changed from 29 January 2016 to 31 October \n2016. The figure shows that the stock price index of Japan\u2019s finance sector declined by \nnearly 20% after the introduction of NIRP1 and remained low throughout the period. \nReflecting the referendum on Brexit (withdrawal of the UK from the European Union), \nthe finance sector\u2019s stock price indexes in Europe declined in late June. But none \nof them  had  a  larger  decline  than  Japan.  More  importantly,  no  Asian  economies \nexperienced significant decline in their finance sector\u2019s stock price index during the \nsample period. Instead, many of Asia\u2019s finance sectors experienced steady increases \nin their stock prices during the period. \nFigure 6: Daily Stock Price Indexes of the Finance Sector \n(1)  Advanced Countries \n \nUK = United Kingdom, US = United States. \nSource: Datastream. \n   \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nFigure 6 continued \n(2)  Emerging Asia \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Datastream. \n2.4  Effects on Volatility Indexes \nThe QQE without a negative interest rate brought dramatic recovery of stock prices in \nJapan but the NIRP did not. However, both of them increased stock market volatility \nsubstantially in Japan. Figure 7 depicts daily data of the Nikkei 225 VI Futures Index \n(Nikkei  VI)  and  the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  Volatility  Index  (VIX)  from \n1 March  2012  to  31  October  2016.  The  VIX,  which  is  a  popular  measure  of  the \nimplied volatility of the Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500 index options and is often referred \nto  as the fear  index,  represents  a  measure  of  the global market\u2019s  expectation  of \nvolatility over  the  next  30-day  period.  The  Nikkei  VI  is  its  Japanese  version.  It  is \ndesigned to reflect the daily price fluctuation of a position that combines the near-term \nand the next-term Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index Future (Nikkei 225 VI Future) \nprices at specified weights. It indicates how market participants expect the Nikkei 225 \nto fluctuate.  \nThe  daily  data,  which  is  downloaded  from  Datastream,  shows  that  the  Nikkei  VI \nbecame larger than the VIX not only after the introduction of the QQE1 on 4 April 2013 \nbut also after the announcement of the NIRP1 on 29 January 2016. This implies that \nboth of the two unconventional monetary policies increased stock market volatility \nsubstantially in Japan. However, while the increased volatility after the QQE1 was \naccompanied by dramatic stock price recovery, the increased volatility after the NIRP1 \ndid not. \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nFigure 7: The Nikkei VI and the Volatility Index \n \nVIX = volatility index. \nSource: Datastream. \nFigure 8 depicts daily data of the Nikkei VI and annual returns of the Nikkei 225 \nindexes. In summer of 2012 when the global market risk increased, the two data \nshowed  opposite  movements.  But  the  Nikkei  VI  had  shown  very  strong  positive \ncorrelation with annual returns of the Nikkei 225 index from the end of 2012 to the end \nof 2015. This implies that both QQE1 and QQE2 not only brought dramatic recovery  \nof stock prices but also increased stock market volatility in Japan. In contrast, the \nNikkei VI had very strong negative correlation with annual returns of the Nikkei 225 \nindex after the announcement of the NIRP1. Unlike the QQE without a negative interest \nrate, the NIRP not only had negative impacts on the stock price but also increased its \nvolatility in Japan. \nFigure 8: The Nikkei VI and Annual Returns of Nikkei 225 \n \nSource: Datastream. \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \n3.  EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY \nUnlike the QQE without a negative interest rate, the NIRP had limited contributions  \nto recovery of Japan\u2019s economy but reduced long-term interest rates significantly. In \nparticular, it raised a serious concern about profitability of local financial institutions in \nJapan and had negative impacts on stock prices of Japan\u2019s finance sector. It is thus \nlikely that its spillover  effects are very different from those of the QQE without a \nnegative interest rate. The purpose of the following sections is to explore to what \nspillover effects different from Japan\u2019s unconventional monetary policies had on Asian \nfinancial markets. \nTo investigate spillover effects on Asian financial markets, we explore how daily stock \nprices in Asian emerging economies reacted to financial shocks in Japan, especially \nchanges  of  long-term  interest  rates,  for  alternative  monetary  policy  regimes.  For \nalternative subsample periods, we estimate the GARCH (1,1) model in order to capture \ndaily financial spillovers across advanced and emerging market economies in Asia.  \n = \uf061 +   +   +  + u,   (1a) \nt\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc3d \u210e \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc59\n\u03c3\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc612 = \u03c6 + \u03b7\u2211 \u210eR=e1s\u2211id\ud835\udc57=02 \ud835\udefd+\u210e \u03bb\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc61\u03c3\u2212\ud835\udc572 +\u2211 \u03b5\ud835\udc58=, 1\u2211\ud835\udc57=0\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57 \u2211\ud835\udc59=1\u2211\ud835\udc57=1\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57 (1b) \nt t-1 t-1 t\nwhere   is  stock returns  in  Asia\u2019s  economy  i  (i  =  Republic  of  Korea; Singapore; \nTaipei,Ch\ud835\udc56ina; and Thailand),   is Japan\u2019s financial variable h,   is stock returns in \n\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\nAsian economy k (k = the PRC \u210eand Hong Kong, China), and   is a\ud835\udc58 financial variable in \nEurope or in the US.  \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc61\n Since our main interest is to explore spillover effects to Asian stock markets, we chose \nstock returns in the Republic of Korea; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand as a \ndependent variable. We chose these four Asian economies partly because they have a \ndeveloped stock market but partly because their market size is not large enough to \nhave significant reverse causality to Japan\u2019s financial variables. The country-specific \nequity returns refer to those of the main stock market index in local currency, that is, \nthe Seoul Composite Index; Singapore (SES) Strait Times Index; TWII, Tapei,China\u2019s \nweighted index; and Thailand SET-Index. \nThe set of explanatory variables consists of three subsets. The first subset ( ) is \nJapan\u2019s financial variables: daily change of 10-year Japanese government bond (J\u210eGB) \nyields,  daily  returns  of the  Nikkei  225  stock  price  index,  and  daily  change  \ud835\udc4bof\ud835\udc61 the  \ndollar-denominated yen\u2019s exchange rate. Unlike QQE1 and QQE2, the NIRP had a \nlimited impact on the Nikkei 225 stock price index and the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate but \nlarge impacts on long-term interest rates. It is important to explore what different effects \nthe 10-year JGB yields had before and after introducing the NIRP. \nThe second subset (  is daily stock returns in the PRC (i.e., Shanghai SSEC) and \n(i.e., Hang Seng Stock\ud835\udc58 Index). Because of its remarkable development, the PRC now \nplays a critical role in \ud835\udc4dA\ud835\udc61s)ian economies. It is thus likely that spillovers from stock prices \nin China to those in the other Asian economies have increased dramatically in 2000s, \nespecially after the GFC. In addition, from December 2014 to February 2016, stock \nreturns in China became highly volatile reflecting growth slowdown of the Chinese \neconomy. Including the second subset of variables captures the increasing role of the \nPRC in Asian financial markets. \n \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nThe third subset ) consists of daily stock returns in London and in New York (that is, \nthe FTSE 100 and\ud835\udc59 Dow Jones Industrial), daily log difference of the VIX, and daily \ndifferenced  10-y (e\ud835\udc4da\ud835\udc61r  US  government  bond  yields.  These  variables  are  included  to \ncontrol the effects of common/systematic global factors. Since the European and New \nYork markets are open after Asia\u2019s financial markets are closed, we only included their \nlagged variables in the regressions.  \nThe estimation of the GARCH model is done with the number of lags set to one.1 The \nsample starts in 5 October 2010 when the BOJ started Comprehensive  Monetary \nEasing and ends in 20 September 2016 after which the BOJ announced the QQE with \nyield curve control. We split the sample into four subsample periods: pre-QQE period \n(i.e., 5 October 2010 to 3 April 2013), the QQE1 period (i.e., 4 April 2013 to 30 October \n2014), the QQE2 period (i.e., 31 October 2014 to 28 January 2016), and the NIRP1 \nperiod (i.e., 29 January 2016 to 20 September 2016). All daily data were downloaded \nfrom Datastream.  \n4.  EMPIRICAL RESULTS: STOCK PRICE SPILLOVERS \nTable  2  reports  the  estimation  results  for  the  four  alternative  subsample  periods. \nMost of the variables in the second subset were statistically significant. In particular, \nalthough  the  Shanghai  stock  price  index  sometimes  took  a  negative  sign,  the \nHong Kong  stock  price  index  took  large  positive  values  in  all  of  the  estimated \nequations. This suggests that increased positive spillovers from the PRC economy \nmight be reflected mainly in stock prices in the Hong Kong, China market. The effects \nof the variables in the third subset varied across the economies depending on the \nsample period. But the London and New York stock price indexes had a tendency to be \npositive.  The  VIX  and  10-year  US  bond  yields  took  a  negative  sign  in  several \nequations.  This  indicates  that  some  of  the  common/systematic  global  factors  had \nsignificant spillover effects on the Asian stock prices. However, even if we control these \nexternal effects, we still see that some of the three financial variables in Japan had \nsignificant  spillover  effects  on  the  stock  price  index  in  each  of  the  four  Asian \neconomies.  The  result  was  essentially  the  same  even  if  we  estimated  by  using \nalternative control variables or by adding more lagged variables.2 \nAmong the three financial variables in Japan (i.e., the 10-year JGB yields, the Nikkei \n225 stock price index, and the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate), a shock in Japan\u2019s stock \nmarket had significantly positive impacts on the stock prices in Asian economies except \nin Thailand. In particular, the Nikkei stock price index took large positive values in the \nRepublic of Korea throughout the subsample periods. This indicates a strong stock \nmarket linkage in the Asian region. However, the impacts of Japan\u2019s stock market \nshocks were different depending on the subsample period. They were largest in the \npre-QQE  period  in  Taipei,China  and  in  the  QQE2  period  in  Singapore.  But  they \nbecame modest in the NIRP1 period. This implies that Japan\u2019s stock market turbulence \nin the NIRP1 period had limited contagious effects on the Asian economies.  \n   \n                                                \n1  Schwarz SC chose one lag in all cases, and so did Akaike AIC in most cases. \n2  We checked the robustness by using DAX 30, France CAC 40, and 5-year US government bond yields. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S.

Fukuda \n \nThe yen\u2013dollar exchange rate took large positive values in the Republic of Korea \nthroughout the subsample periods. This indicates that reflecting export competition \nbetween  the  two  countries,  the  yen\u2019s  depreciation  might  have  had  a  beggar-thy-\nneighbor  effect  on  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  economy.  Similar  significant  negative \nspillover effects were observed in Taipei,China before the QQE2 period, in Singapore \nin the NIRP1 period, and in Thailand in the QQE1 period. But the yen\u2019s depreciation \nhad significant positive spillover effects in Singapore in the QQE1 and QQE2 periods \nand in Thailand in the QQE2 and NIRP1 periods. This implies that beggar-thy-neighbor \neffects on stock prices were, if any, limited in the Southeast Asian economies even if \nthe yen depreciated dramatically. \nThe most noteworthy result is contrasting effects of the 10-year JGB yields on the \nAsian stock prices before and after the introduction of the NIRP. They were, if any, \nlimited in most of the Asian economies before the NIRP was announced.3 This means \nthat a change of low but still positive long-term interest rate in Japan had limited \nspillover effects on the Asian economies. However, except in the Republic of Korea, \nthe 10-year JGB yields took a significantly negative sign in the NIRP1 period. This \nmeans  that  a  decline  of  the  long-term  interest  rate  might  have  benefited  Asian \neconomies after the 10-year JGB yields fell below zero.  \nOne notable consequence of the NIRP was that not only short-term but also long-term \ninterest rates became negative. The prevailing negative long-term interest rates raised \na  serious  concern  about  profitability  of  local  financial  institutions  in  Japan.  Local \ncommercial banks experienced substantial decline in the margin between domestic \nlending  rates  and  deposit  rates.  Local  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance \ncompanies, trust funds, and pension funds, lost their profit opportunities in domestic \nmarkets. Many of them thus needed to explore a new profit opportunity outside Japan. \nFinancial markets in emerging Asia were their natural choices. They are still risky but \npotentially  highly  profitable  investment  destinations.  It  is  likely  that  their  changed \ninvestment behavior benefited Asian economies, especially their finance sector. \nThe exception was the Republic of Korea. In the Republic of Korea, the 10-year JGB \nyields were not statistically significant in the NIRP1 period, while both the Nikkei 225 \nstock price index and the yen\u2013dollar exchange rate took a significantly positive sign in \nthe NIRP1 period. This might have happened because of strong trade linkage but weak \nfinancial  market  linkage  between  the  two  countries.  Because  of  its  economic \ndevelopment, further growth potential in the Republic of Korea\u2019s economy might be \nmore  limited  than  those  in  other  emerging  Asian  countries.  It  is  thus  likely  that \nJapanese financial institutions did not explore a new profit opportunity in the Republic \nof Korea. \nFigure  9  depicts  accumulated  returns  of  the  stock  price  indexes  in  the  Republic  \nof  Korea;  Singapore;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand  before  and  after  the  NIRP1 \nannouncement. For comparison, it also depicts the 10-year JGB yields during the same \nperiod. We normalized the accumulated returns on 29 January 2016 to be zero and \ndepicted how the accumulated returns changed after the NIRP1 announcement. In \nthe figure, the accumulated returns increased only modestly soon after the NIRP1 \nannouncement even though the 10-year JGB yields dropped sharply to almost zero.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n3  The simultaneous effect of 10-year JGB yields on the stock price was significantly negative in the \nRepublic of Korea in the QQE1 period and in Thailand in the QQE2 period. But since the lagged effect \nwas positive in both cases, the total effect was never significant before the NIRP1 period. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nHowever, they started to increase substantially after the 20th business day when the \n10-year JGB yields fell below zero persistently. The increased accumulated returns \nwere very modest in the Republic of Korea. But the increased accumulated returns \namounted to nearly 10% in the other three Asian economies.4 They are consistent with \nthe view that Asian stock prices welcomed negative long-term interest rates in Japan. \nFigure 9: Accumulated Returns in the Four Asian Economies  \nand Japanese Government Bond Yields \n \nJGB = Japanese government bond. \nNote: Left axis shows the unit of accumulated returns and the right axis shows the unit of 10-year  \nJGB yields. \nSource: Datastream. \n5.  ESTIMATION RESULTS USING EXCESS STOCK \nRETURNS OF JAPAN\u2019S FINANCE SECTOR \nIn the last section, we found that except in the Republic of Korea, the 10-year JGB \nyields, which had shown no significant impacts before the announcement of the NIRP, \ntook significantly negative effects on Asian stock prices in the NIRP1 period. This \nmeans that lowering long-term interest rates below zero in Japan might have benefited \nAsian  economies  except  the  Republic  of  Korea.  We  conjectured  that  this  might  \nhave happened because local financial institutions who lost their profit opportunities  \nin  domestic  markets  explored  new  profit  opportunities  in  emerging  Asia  after  the \nNIRP announcement.  \n   \n                                                \n4  During the same period, stock prices in the PRC and in Hong Kong, China showed no persistent \nchanges. This indicates that we cannot attribute the dramatic increases in accumulated returns to the \neffects of the PRC\u2019s economy. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nThe  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  examine  the  validity  of  this  conjecture  through \nexploring whether the NIRP benefited Asian economies because of its negative impact \non Japan\u2019s finance sector. Specifically, using excess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance \nsector, which was explained by the JGB yields as a new explanatory variable, we \ninvestigate how daily responses of the Asian sector\u2019s stock prices changed before and \nafter the introduction of the NIRP.  \nIn the analysis, we define excess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector, ER, by daily \nt\nstock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector minus daily stock returns of Nikkei 225. To \ncalculate how the JGB yields explain the excess stock returns, we then run OLS, which \nregresses ER on current and lagged value of the 10-year JGB yields, JGB, as follows: \nt t\nER = \u03b8 +   + \u03bd,  (2) \nt t\n\ud835\udc3d\n\u2211\ud835\udc57=0\ud835\udf07\u210e\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\nExcess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector, which are explained by the JGB yields, \nare the fitted value of ER in the four alternative subsample periods: the pre-QQE \nt\nperiod, the QQE1 period, the QQE2 period, and the NIRP1 period. That is, denoting \nthe  estimated  coefficients  by \u03b8 and \u00b5 ,  we  calculate  the  excess  stock  returns \nexplained by the NIRP as   \u2261 \u03b8 +   for each alternative subsample \n\ufffd  \ufffd\u210e \nperiod.  Except  that  we  replace  the  10-\ud835\udc3dyear  JGB  yields  by   in  the  explanatory \n\ud835\udc38\ufffd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61 \ufffd  \u2211\ud835\udc57=0\ud835\udf07\ufffd\u210e\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc57\nvariables, the estimated GARCH (1,1) equations are the same as those in previous \nsections. We estimate the model for the four alternative subsam\ud835\udc38p\ufffd\ud835\udc45le\ud835\udc61 periods. Comparing \nthe estimation results across different monetary policy regimes, we examine how the \nintroduction of the NIRP changed stock price responses in the Asian economies.  \nAs in the last section, all of the data were downloaded from Datastream. Table 3 \nreports the estimation results. Except for the excess returns, the estimated coefficients \nwere essentially the same as those in the last section. That is, many of the control \nvariables were statistically significant. Among the three financial variables in Japan, the \nNikkei  stock  price  index  took  significantly  positive  values  except  in  Thailand.  The  \nyen\u2013dollar exchange rate took large positive values in the Republic of Korea in most of \nthe subsample periods. \nThe most noteworthy result is the effects of   before and after the NIRP period. As \ndid the 10-year JGB yields, they had contrasting features before and after the NIRP \nperiod. In the pre-NIRP periods, they were \ud835\udc38s\ufffdm\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61all and insignificant in all of the Asian \neconomies except in the Republic of Korea in the QQE1 period. This means that a \nchange of excess stock returns of Japan\u2019s finance sector had no spillover effect on the \nAsian finance sectors when long-term interest rates were low but still positive in Japan. \nIn  contrast,  except  for  the  Republic  of  Korea,  its  spillover  effects  on  the  Asian \neconomies became larger and more significant in the NIRP1 period. In particular, they \nwere significantly negative. This means that when negative long-term rates reduced \nexcess  stock  returns  of  Japan\u2019s  finance  sector  in  Japan,  the  Asian  stock  prices \nincreased except in the Republic of Korea. It is likely that the changed behavior of \nJapanese financial institutions in the NIRP might have benefited the finance sectors of \nmost Asian economies. \n   \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S.

Fukuda \n \n6.  EFFECTS OF THE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE \nPOLICY ON ADVANCED ECONOMIES \nUntil the last section, we found that except in the Republic of Korea, the 10-year JGB \nyields, which had shown no significant impact in the pre-NIRP period, had significantly \nnegative effects on Asian stock prices in the NIRP1 period. We conjectured that this \nmight have happened because Japanese financial institutions explored a new profit \nopportunity in emerging Asia after the announcement of the NIRP.  \nThe purpose of this section is to investigate whether the NIRP in Japan had similar \nspillover effects on stock prices in advanced economies. Specifically, using daily stock \nprice  data  in  the  UK,  Germany,  and  the  US,  we  examine  how  the  stock  prices \nresponded to Japan\u2019s financial shocks in the NIRP period. In the estimation, we use \ndaily returns of the FTSE 100 in the UK, the DAX 30 in Germany, and the Dow Jones \nIndustrial in the US as a dependent variable. Except for the dependent variable, the \nestimated equations are essentially the same as those in previous sections.

The \nNikkei stock price index had a large positive effect on the Germany stock price index \nand a marginally significant positive effect on the UK stock price index. The yen\u2013dollar \nexchange rate had a large negative effect both on the Germany stock price index and \non the US stock price index. This indicates that a strong yen might have had a negative \neffect on stock prices in the two economies.  \nHowever, unlike in Asian stock markets, the 10-year JGB yields never had a significant \neffect on the stock prices in the advanced economies in the NIRP period. This means \nthat unlike in Asia, a decline of long-term interest rates below zero in Japan did not \nbenefit  the  advanced  economies.  In  the  NIRP  period,  the  changed  behavior  of \nJapanese financial institutions might have benefited many Asian economies. But when \nexploring  a  new  profit  opportunity  outside  Japan,  financial  markets  in  advanced \neconomies were not attractive investment destinations because their long-term interest \nrates had already fallen enough.  \n7.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nIn this paper, we explored what spillover effects Japan\u2019s negative interest rate policy \n(NIRP) had on Asian stock markets. Unlike the QQE without a negative interest rate, \nthe QQE with a negative interest rate had limited impact on the Japanese economy. \nHowever,  the  NIRP  brought  various  undesirable  consequences  to  the  Japanese \neconomy, especially to its finance sector. It is thus likely that its spillover effects are \nvery different from those of the QQE without a negative interest rate. Our empirical \nresult suggested that spillovers from Japan\u2019s financial shocks to Asian stock markets \nhad contrasting features in the NIRP period, which were not observed in the pre-QQE \nor the QQE periods. In particular, they showed that the NIRP might have benefited \nAsian economies through a decline of excess returns in Japan\u2019s finance sector. \nOne notable consequence of the NIRP was that not only short-term but also long-term \ninterest rates became negative. Under prevailing negative long-term interest rates, \nmost  of  the  Japanese  local  financial  institutions  lost  their  profit  opportunities  in \ndomestic markets. They thus needed to explore a new profit opportunity outside Japan. \nFigure  10  shows  the  amount  of  net  purchases  of  foreign  long-term  securities  by \nJapanese life insurance companies from 2005 to 2016. Until January 2016, the monthly \namount had usually been less than \u00a550 billion and rarely exceeded \u00a5100 billion. But the \namount soared up dramatically in February 2016 and remained high. Such large and \npersistent net purchases never happened during the last decade. This implies that \nJapanese  life  insurance  companies  that  lost  investment  opportunities  in  domestic \nmarkets  expanded  their  investment  to  foreign  markets  after  the  announcement  of \nthe NIRP. \nWhen exploring a new profit opportunity outside Japan, financial markets in emerging \nAsia, rather than those in advanced economies, were their natural choices. They are \nstill risky but potentially highly profitable investment destinations. It is likely that their \nchanged  investment  behavior  benefited  Asian  economies,  especially  their  finance \nsector. Our empirical results supported the view. \n   \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S.

In order to mitigate a concern among \nlocal financial institutions, the BOJ introduced the QQE with yield curve control (NIRP2) \non  21  September  2016.  Even  in  the  NIRP2,  short-term  interest  rates  remained \nsignificantly negative. But unlike in the NIRP1, long-term interest rates increased to \nzero in the NIRP2. Because of limited sample size, we could not estimate spillover \neffects in the NIRP2. But it is likely that in the NIRP2, we may no longer see beneficial \nspillover effects on Asian economies. \n   \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 707  S. Fukuda \n \nREFERENCES \nBauer, M. D., and C.
