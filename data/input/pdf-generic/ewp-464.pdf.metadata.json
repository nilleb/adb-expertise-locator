The latter are associated with episodes of currency and \nbanking crises like the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial and economic crisis. \nPolicy responses can be implemented to minimize the costs.

Data show that \nthe main impact of capital flows on economies of East Asia is reflected in real effective exchange rates, \nequity prices, and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. If \u201cpull\u201d factors are dominant, policy \nmakers should allow real exchange rates to appreciate in the long-term. Three broad categories of \nmacroeconomic measures are available to countries facing surges of capital inflows, if they are not \nwilling  to  allow  the  nominal  exchange  rate  to  appreciate:  (i)  sterilized  intervention,  (ii)  greater \nexchange rate flexibility, and (iii) fiscal tightening (preferably through expenditure cuts).

BACKGROUND \n \nEconomic performance of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) countries are highly sensitive to the global \nfinancial environment. The first half of 2013 started with another quarter of capital inflows into the \nregion. Coupled with relatively sustained growth of the ASEAN+3 economies, the loose monetary \npolicies of advanced economies had been driving money into the region. However, both of these push \nand  pull  factors  gradually  lost  strength  in  the  second  quarter.  Following  Chairman  Bernanke\u2019s \nstatement on possible tapering of the United States (US) quantitative easing (QE) in May 2013, \ninvestors  have  become  increasingly  concerned  about  an  exit  from  easy  monetary  conditions, \nnotwithstanding the announcement of an aggressive expansionary policy in Japan. Lack of clarity of in \nthe timing and process has resulted in volatile flows of capital, with and many of the ASEAN+3 \neconomies experienced outflows of capitals from the bond and equity markets, along with rising risk \npremiums.  \n \nTo date, the policy lever in the US has normalized and capital flows are returning to the region. \nYet the global economy still faces a number of uncertainties in the coming years. One immediate \nuncertainty is the evolution of monetary and fiscal policy in advanced economies and its impact on the \nglobal economy. Another uncertainty is that all major economies\u2014the US, the European Union (EU), \nthe PRC, Japan, and emerging economies collectively\u2014are all undergoing major structural adjustments \n5 years after the global financial crisis (GFC). The impact of these structural adjustments is also \nuncertain. Global uncertainties will affect global liquidity conditions, and subsequently create volatile \ncapital flows to and from ASEAN+3. \n \nThis paper is the regional overview of a study that aims: \n \n(i)  to get a better understanding of the dynamic nature of global liquidity\u2014the factors \ndriving global liquidity as well as the transmission channels to the ASEAN+3 markets; and \n(ii)  to take stock of lessons learned with respect to impacts, policies, and implications of \nvolatile capital flows on the ASEAN+3 economies. \n(iii)  Based on lessons learned, the next task is to design policy frameworks and guidelines to \ndeal with future challenges in managing capital flows. \n \nFor this regional overview, we are interested in identifying the primary transmission channels of \nglobal liquidity into the ASEAN+3 economies. Selected questions to be discussed in this section \ninclude: \n \n(i)  Have all different episodes of global liquidity expansion affected the regional economies \nof the ASEAN+3? \n(ii)  What  were  the  transmission  channels  of  these  shocks  (i.e.,  bank  lending,  portfolio \nflows)? \n(iii)  Have there been consistent transmission channels across different episodes of global \nliquidity expansion? \n \n   ", "2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \nGlobal capital flows remain an important issue in international finance. In the aftermath of the 2008 \nglobal financial and economic crisis, capital flows to emerging countries surged again. There have been \nsimilar episodes in the past 3 decades, including one that culminated in the 1997\u20131998 East Asian \nfinancial crisis (AFC). Meanwhile, the GFC was followed by an unprecedented easing of monetary \npolicy by both the US and Japan. This contributed to concerns about volatile capital flows and the \nstability of the global financial system. \n \nThe  problems  that  have  emerged  in  the  various  episodes  are  like  a  refrain  in  a  song: \nappreciating currencies that could lead to exchange rate overshooting, pressure on asset prices, which \ncan result in bubbles that amplify financial fragility and crisis risk, and the possibility of overheating, \nresulting in inflation. The macroeconomic difficulties spawned by the volatility of capital inflows have \nelicited various policy responses (IMF 2007): \n \n\u201cWhereas some countries have let exchange rates move upward, in many cases the \nmonetary authorities have intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets to resist \nheavy currency appreciation. To varying degrees, they have sought to neutralize the \nmonetary impact of intervention through sterilization, with a view to forestalling an \nexcessively rapid expansion of domestic demand. Controls on capital inflows have \nbeen introduced or tightened, and controls on outflows eased, to relieve upward \npressure  on  exchange  rates.  Fiscal  policies  have  also  responded\u2014in  some  cases, \nstronger revenue growth from buoyant activity has been harnessed to achieve better \nfiscal  outcomes,  although  in  many  countries  rising  revenues  have  led  to  higher \ngovernment spending.\u201d \n \nAs a result of this type of policy responses, the typical macro configuration in emerging \nmarkets in Asia after the AFC was slower growth, less investment, current account surpluses replacing \ndeficits, and a successful management of the exchange rates to keep exports competitive, involving a \nlarge buildup in foreign exchange reserves (Grenville 2012). \n \nThis paper looks into the experience of the ASEAN+3 economies with regard to capital flows \nduring the period 1990 to the present. Emphasis will be on the last 3 years (2011\u20132013) since previous \nwork has covered the earlier period adequately (e.g., Kawai and Lamberte 2010). The next section will \nreview the major issues with regard to capital flows. Section III will present data that show trends of \ncapital flows in ASEAN+3 and their impact for the period 1990\u20132013. This will be followed by a \ndiscussion on the economic environment in ASEAN+3 based on recent indicators from the Asia \nRegional Integration Center. The last section deals with policy issues. \n \n \nIII.  THEORETICAL AND POLICY ISSUES \n \nA.  Determinants of Capital Flows \n \nThe surge in capital flows to emerging market economies in the past 30 years is a reflection of the rapid \nexpansion and integration of international capital markets that had been driven by economic policy \nand  structural  changes,  and  technological  factors.  The  latter  refer  to  revolutionary  advances  in \nhandling of information and telecommunications, and the emergence of increasingly sophisticated \nfinancial engineering. These factors have increased the speed and complexity of capital account ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   3 \ntransactions. Meanwhile, economic policy and structural changes from the standpoint of developing \neconomies can be categorized into two broad groups: those that are country-specific, or \u201cpull\u201d factors; \nand those that are external to the country and beyond its control, or \u201cpush\u201d factors. \n \nOne  set  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  were  policies  that  improved  the  relations  of  heavily  indebted \ncountries with external creditors. A key element was the role of debt\u2013equity swaps in increasing the \nexpected  rate  of  return  on  domestic  investment  projects,  thereby  encouraging  foreign  direct \ninvestment (FDI) (Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart 1994). Successful price stabilization programs that \nwere accompanied by improved fiscal policy fundamentals and greater macroeconomic stability were \nalso major pull factors. Lastly, institutional reforms, such as the liberalization of the capital account, \nplayed a significant role in attracting capital flows. Indeed, the right to repatriate dividends and capital \nmay have been the most important factor in the surge of foreign equity flows to emerging market \neconomies (Taylor and Sarno 1997). \n \nGrenville (2012) has a more intricate view of pull factors: \u201cAs emerging countries converge \ntoward the technological frontier their capital stock is being built up from modest per capita starting \nlevels, to eventually match the levels of the developed economies at some time in the future. During \nthis transition, productivity will greatly increase and returns to capital will be high: the Wicksellian \n\u2018natural\u2019 interest rate in the emerging countries will be substantially higher than in the developed \neconomies. This might be expected to be the principal underlying driver of capital flows.\u201d \n \nAmong the prominent \u201cpush\u201d factors were the decline in international interest rates and \neconomic recessions in industrialized countries. These factors reduced profit opportunities in world \nfinancial centers and drove international capital to emerging market economies. Another type of push \nfactor was through contagion effects. Large shifts in capital flows to one or two large countries in a \nregion may have generated externalities for the smaller neighboring countries (Calvo, Leiderman, and \nReinhart 1996). \n \nIn terms of actual policy adjustments, regulatory changes in the US and Europe made it easier \nfor foreign firms to make their equity and bonds more attractive to investors. This facilitated the trend \ntoward  international  portfolio  diversification.  Meanwhile,  competition  and  rising  labor  costs  in \nindustrialized countries, along with falling transport and communication costs, induced firms to seek \nopportunities  to  increase  efficiency  and  returns  by  producing  abroad.  The  realignment  of  major \ncurrencies contributed to this process. The result has been a progressive globalization of production \nand the growth of FDI flows. \n \nA crucial debate has been on the relative importance of \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d factors in the \nevolution of capital flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors were the primary determinants of capital flows into emerging \nmarket economies, this would support the optimistic view that the sustainability of these flows is to a \nlarge extent a function of domestic policies under the control of developing countries. On the other \nhand, if the surge in capital flows was mostly a result of \u201cpush\u201d factors, particularly interest rate \nmovements, this would support the view that capital flows are highly volatile because they are subject \nto factors beyond the control of policy makers (Fernandez-Arias 1996). \n \nThe empirical evidence has generally been mixed. Some analysts argue that the weight of the \nevidence favors the push view\u2014that falling US interest rates have played a dominant role in driving \ncapital flows to developing countries (Fernandez-Arias and Montiel 1996). Other studies have shown \nthat country-specific factors\u2014e.g., the domestic credit rating and black market exchange premium\u2014\nhave been as important in influencing capital flows, particularly portfolio flows (Taylor and Sarno \n ", "4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n1997). The primacy of \u201cpull\u201d factors, however, can be questioned on several counts. Although it is true \nthat not all countries have been recipients of the new inflows, it is also true that flows have not been \nrestricted  to  countries  with  well-established  track  records  of  macroeconomic  and  structural \nadjustment. Second, country creditworthiness depends not only on domestic factors but also on the \ninternational interest rate. Third, the significant role of contagion in the AFC points to the relative \nstrength of \u201cpush\u201d factors. The variability of capital flows, particularly to the ASEAN-5 countries \n(includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), was evident during the GFC \n(Grenville 2012). \n \nKnowledge  of  the  determinants  of  capital  flows  has  profound  implications  in  terms  of \nappropriate policy responses. In this context, the overriding objective of economic managers is to \nmaximize the benefits of capital flows and minimize their costs. \n \nB.  Advantages of Greater Capital Mobility \n \nGreater  capital  mobility  is  generally  viewed  to  be  advantageous  to  the  process  of  economic \ndevelopment.  Capital  flows  to  emerging  market  economies  have  eased  the  domestic  savings \nconstraint, which in turn has increased investment, thereby boosting economic growth. To the extent \nthat real returns to marginal investment are lower in capital-rich countries than those in capital-scarce \ncountries,  the  movement  of  capital  from  developed  economies  to  emerging  market  economies \nimproves the efficiency of world resource allocation (Devlin, Ffrench-Davis, and Griffith-Jones 1995). \n \nInstead of raising the investment rate indirectly by providing more resources, capital flows may \ndo so directly in the form of FDI. This type of inflow usually brings a range of dynamic benefits such as \ntechnology, improved management practices, and greater access to international markets. \n \nThe  availability  of  international  capital  also  provides  an  economy  the  ability  to  smooth \nexpenditures, especially in the advent of adverse exogenous shocks. Meanwhile, an open capital \naccount for both developed and emerging market economies allows for greater portfolio diversification \nand better management of risk on the part of investors. This is one of the more common arguments at \nthe microeconomic level for capital account liberalization (Devlin, Ffrench-Davis and Griffith-Jones, \n1995). \n \nC.  Drawbacks of Greater Capital Mobility \n \nThe AFC and the GFC were painful reminders of the risks associated with more open capital accounts. \nForeign capital flows may cause imbalances that threaten macroeconomic stability. This situation \nbecomes likely if the absorptive capacity of the economy falls below the level of the capital inflows. \nSuch a disparity arises because of policy arbitrage, where capital flows are attracted by the sound \nfundamentals of an economy causing financial markets to allocate too much or too little capital to \nsome recipients at a given moment (Guitian 1998). \n \nIf an economy has a flexible exchange rate regime, capital inflows will lead to an appreciation of \nthe nominal and real exchange rates. This will have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of \nexports and import-substituting industries, and result in a deterioration of the current account balance. \nThe resource allocation effects of a real exchange rate appreciation may also spawn asset price \nbubbles and rapid credit expansion that could jeopardize the stability of the financial system. \n ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   5 \nIn a fixed exchange rate regime, capital inflows lead to a real exchange rate appreciation via \ninflationary pressure brought about by the increase in money supply and domestic credit. However, a \nfixed exchange rate regime is more vulnerable when there is a net capital outflow. Unless it has \nadequate foreign exchange reserves, the monetary authority would have to raise interest rates to \nprotect the peg. The likely outcome would be an economic recession. \n \nMany factors could also undermine the efficacy of the capital inflows. The host economy may \nexperience a mere substitution of domestic savings by foreign savings, which would only facilitate a \nconsumption boom. In order to avoid this situation, a relatively high saving rate must be attained in \norder to generate a trade surplus that will be used to service the foreign debt incurred. But even if this \nsaving rate is attained, an insufficient amount of investment may be channeled to the tradable goods \nsector (most likely because of the appreciation of the real exchange rate), which would reduce the \nconvertibility of the surplus to foreign currency needed to service the foreign debt. Some analysts have \nargued that even if capital inflows are channeled completely to investment, the resulting improvement \nin the growth rate is only short-term in nature unless it is accompanied by a significant improvement in \nthe economy\u2019s technology (Reisen 1998). \n \nSince capital account inflows inherently entail financial transactions, they are also susceptible \nto  market  imperfections  associated  with  asymmetric  information  and  moral  hazard.  These \nmicroeconomic distortions normally result in an inappropriate assessment of risk exposure and cause \noverborrowing, making the financial system vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The problem becomes \nparticularly acute when banks are the main intermediaries of capital flows. The situation is even more \nprecarious  in  emerging  markets  where  the  risk  management  practices  of  the  private  sector  are \nunderdeveloped,  the  capacity  of  regulators  to  supervise  the  finance  sector  are  limited,  and  the \nfinancial markets are thin. \n \nAnother potential microeconomic distortion arises from the real sector where aspects such as \nimperfect  competition,  externalities  or  wage  rigidity,  may  result  in  inappropriate  private  sector \nadjustment even if the finance sector is functioning well (Fernandez-Arias and Montiel 1996). Such \nstatic distortions may lead to the choice of a wrong technology and access to foreign capital will \nmagnify the problem (Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart 1994). Meanwhile, in the event of a sudden \ncapital outflow, these distortions would induce exchange rate overshooting, making the economic \nadjustment more difficult. \n \nThis discussion is based on literature in the 1990s. The review of Kawai and Takagi (2010) \npresents  more  or  less  the  same  issues.  They  list  three  types  of  risks  that  can  be  conceptually \nconsidered (Kawai and Takagi 2010, 51): \n \nMacroeconomic risks. Capital inflows could accelerate the growth of credit (or even create \nloss of monetary control), cause the real exchange rate to appreciate, cause inflation, and \naffect other macroeconomic variables in a way inconsistent or incompatible with immediate \ndomestic  policy  objectives,  such  as  price  stability,  exchange  rate  stability,  and  export \npromotion. \n \nFinancial stability risk. Capital inflows could push up equity and other asset prices, reduce the \nquality of assets, and adversely affect the maturity and currency composition of the balance \nsheets of the private sector (particularly banks and corporations), thereby contributing to \ngreater financial fragility. \n \n ", "6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \nRisk  of  capital  flow  reversal. Capital inflows could reverse themselves suddenly, with a \npotential for the depletion of reserves or sharp currency depreciation. \n \nD.  Some Empirical Evidence \n \nDespite the theoretical and intuitive arguments in favor of greater capital mobility, some studies have \nquestioned the benefits of capital flows on empirical grounds. In one study, an indicator of capital \naccount liberalization was included as an explanatory variable for economic growth (Rodrik 1998). The \nconclusion reached was that the data provided no evidence that countries without capital controls \nhave grown faster, invested more, or experienced lower inflation. \n \nAnother study used capital flows directly as an explanatory variable (Levine and Carkovic \n1999). The authors applied more sophisticated econometric techniques to account for simultaneity, \ncountry-specific effects and the inclusion of lagged dependent variables as regressors. The study \nfound that the exogenous components of FDI flows and portfolio flows did not exert a positive \ninfluence  on  economic  growth.  The  conclusion  is  consistent  with  microeconomic  studies  that \ngenerally suggest that FDI does not boost economic growth primarily because of the absence of \nevidence of positive spillovers running from foreign-owned to domestic-owned firms. However, Reisen \nand Soto (2001) examined a panel data of 44 countries over 1986\u20131997 and found that FDI (as well as \nequity) inflows, but not any other type of capital inflows, are positively correlated with subsequent \neconomic growth.  \n \nThe study of Levine and Carkovic also looked at the effect of capital flows on productivity \ngrowth, which is an important determinant of the variation in long-term growth across economies. This \nanalysis, too, did not show evidence of a link. However, a separate study by Levine (1999) presented \nevidence that the entry of foreign banks\u2014a form of direct investment\u2014enhanced the efficiency of the \ndomestic  financial  system.  Meanwhile,  international  portfolio  equity  flows  were  shown  to  have \nenhanced domestic stock market liquidity. Other studies have confirmed the positive effects of both \nfinancial system efficiency and stock market liquidity on productivity and economic growth. Hence, \nthe study of Levine provided evidence of a transmission mechanism between foreign capital flows, on \nthe one hand, and economic growth, on the other. \n \nA comprehensive review by Obstfeld (2007) covers the major empirical studies of the past \ndecade. He finds that at the macro level, in particular, it is difficult to find unambiguous evidence that \nfinancial opening yields a net improvement in economic performance for emerging countries. This \ndoes not imply, however, that financial liberalization, or specifically capital account liberalization, must \nbe abandoned. There are plausible explanations why empirical work does not unambiguously show \nthat capital account liberalization is beneficial on a net basis. \n \n(i)  First, there may be threshold levels of institutional development only above which the \nbenefits exceed the costs. This could also explain why the correlation between growth \nand the use of foreign capital is strongly positive for industrial countries but not for low-\nincome countries. Other studies support this notion of a threshold effect, whereby a \ncountry\u2019s absorptive capacity must exceed a certain amount in order to exploit the \nbenefits of capital inflows (Prasad et al. 2003). \n(ii)  Second, collateral benefits of openness to foreign capital are greater at higher levels of \ndevelopment,  while  the  associated  costs  and  risks  are  greater  at  lower  levels  of \ndevelopment. ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   7 \n(iii)  Third, crude quantity-based measures of the use of foreign finance, such as the current \naccount deficit or gross inflows, may not capture the influence of foreign capital. \n \nHence, Obstfeld argues that despite the skimpy direct evidence that developing countries gain \nfrom financial globalization, they should nonetheless proceed in a cautious incremental manner. There \nis strong evidence that domestic financial development spurs growth under the right conditions, and \nthese conditions\u2014plus domestic financial development itself\u2014are likely to make capital inflows from \nabroad more productive. Moreover, in the long-term, an internationally open financial system is likely \nto be more competitive, transparent, and efficient than a closed one. \n \nAn  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  capital  flows  can  determine  whether  the \naforementioned drawbacks have materialized. In one study, key economic variables for selected Asian \nand Latin American economies were monitored using data from 1988\u20131994 (Calvo, Leiderman, and \nReinhart 1996). Some stylized facts were documented from these observations. First, a substantial \nportion of the surge in capital inflows was channeled to accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. \nSecond, in most countries, the capital inflows were associated with widening current account deficits. \nThird, there was a rise in consumption spending, which was usually driven by rising imports of durable \ngoods. Fourth, in almost all countries examined, there was rapid growth in the money supply both in \nnominal and real terms. Fifth, the surge in portfolio flows was accompanied by sharp increases in stock \nand real estate prices. Lastly, the evidence on the real exchange rate presents a mixed picture. The data \nindicate that real exchange rate appreciation was more prevalent in Latin America than in Asia. \n \nThe  stylized  facts  suggest  that  the  disadvantages  associated  with  capital  flows,  such  as \nincreased consumption and real exchange rate appreciation, are likely outcomes. Given the potential \nbenefits of capital flows, it is thus imperative for policy makers to adopt measures that minimize their \ncosts.  Strategies  for  capital  flow  management  can  be  developed  at  the  domestic,  regional,  and \ninternational levels. Policy options that exist in the domestic front can further be classified into \nmacroeconomic and microeconomic responses. \n \nE.  Policy Issues \n \nThe impact of capital flows on the exchange rate is at the heart of the discussion of appropriate policy \nresponses in emerging markets. If capital flows are driven largely by fundamentals\u2014such as a higher \nWicksellian  \u2018natural\u2019  interest  rate  or  the  Balassa-Samuelson  effect\u2014authorities  must  accept  the \ninevitability of allowing the real exchange rate to appreciate. In fact, real exchange appreciation is the \nonly sustainable response to a permanent increase in capital inflows and a fundamental revaluation of \ndomestic relative to foreign assets (Kawai and Takagi 2010). Policy makers, however, are generally \nreluctant to allow currencies to appreciate.  \n \nThree broad categories of macroeconomic measures are available to countries facing surges of \ncapital inflows, if they are not willing to allow the nominal exchange rate to appreciate: (i) sterilized \nintervention,  (ii)  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility,  and  (iii)  fiscal  tightening  (preferably  through \nexpenditure cuts). The relevant issues for each option are summarized in Table 1. More details can be \nfound in Kawai and Takagi (2010). \n \nFiscal tightening is arguably the most effective response to a surge in capital inflows because it \nleads to a decline in the absorption of real resources by the public sector to offset the impact of \nresource transfers from abroad on the domestic economy. Because the impact is on the real sector of \nthe economy, fiscal tightening should limit inflationary pressure and prevent a real appreciation of the \n ", "8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \ncurrency. Moreover, since it can reduce pressure on interest rates, it directly lowers the gains to \ninterest rate-induced capital inflows. Provided that government consumption is more intensive in the \nuse of nontradable goods, fiscal tightening would cause domestic demand to shift from nontradable \ngoods to tradable goods, and domestic production to shift from nontradable goods to tradable goods. \n \nHowever, fiscal tightening has limitations as a policy tool to deal with capital inflows: \n \n\u201cFirst,  fiscal  policy  lacks  flexibility  because  it  often  requires  parliamentary  action. \nSecond, there is a limit to how much fiscal policy can be tightened, especially in a \ndemocratic society and if there is little fiscal space to begin with. Third, fiscal tightening \nmay have the perverse effect of attracting capital flows by providing a signal that \nauthorities  are  pursuing  a  sound,  disciplined  macroeconomic  policy.  It  should  be \ncountered, however, that such a positive signaling effect is likely transitory; over time, \nsustainable fiscal policy should help attract only the most stable and committed types \nof capital.\u201d1 \n \nBecause the policy responses presented in Table 1 have their respective drawbacks, the issue \nof capital controls has remained relevant. Moreover, the experience with the AFC and other similar \ncrises has shifted the policy debate. Whereas, free flows previously dominated the analytical and \nintellectual debate, the current thinking has moved toward policy intervention. It has been observed \nthat past aversion to capital controls has seemingly been replaced with a new appreciation of its \ncontribution to economic policy as a tool for financial stability.2 \n \nHowever,  the  current  positions  \u201cseem  to  be  transitional  rather  than  conceptually  well \nfounded\u201d (Grenville 2012). The best example of this is the position of the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) which is illustrated in Figure 1. There is acceptance that temporary management of capital flows \nmay be necessary but only after all other possible measures have been exhausted. However, this new \nframework has been described as complicated, intentionally vague, and difficult to implement given \nthe absence of explicit guidelines (Gochoco-Bautista and Rhee 2013). \n \n \n                                                 \n1   Schadler (2010) as cited by Kawai and Takagi (2010), 61. \n2  Gochoco-Bautista and Rhee (2013), 1, citing Gallagher, Griffith-Jones, and Ocampo, eds.

CAPITAL FLOWS IN ASEAN+3 \n \nThis section presents updated data on the magnitude and composition of capital flows in ASEAN+3 as \nwell as their impact. The presentation will largely follow the discussion of Kawai and Lamberte (2010). \nThe data will show whether the possible drawbacks from greater capital mobility have materialized in \nASEAN+3. \n \nA.  Degree of Capital Account Openness \n \nCapital  account  openness  has  been  measured  empirically  both  in  de  jure  (based  on  laws  and \nregulations) and de facto terms. De jure openness can be more important for financial integration. One \npopular measure of de jure openness is the Chinn-Ito Index which is an index compiled based on the \nIMF\u2019s annual report on exchange rate arrangements and regulations. The index values range between \n2.5 (fully open) and \u20131.8 (fully closed).  \n \nThe degree of capital account openness varies a great deal in ASEAN+3 (Figure 2). The trend \nin Southeast Asia has been toward greater restrictiveness. The Philippines and Indonesia had positive \nvalues of the index prior to 2012. Malaysia\u2019s index turned negative after the AFC. Meanwhile, the index \nfor Thailand has become progressively more negative over time. Among the economies of ASEAN+3, \nonly  the  capital  account  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  has  become  more  open.  The  others  either \nmaintained the same level of openness (Hong Kong, China and Singapore) or the same level of \nrestrictiveness (e.g., the PRC and India). \n \nFigure 2: Degree of Openness of Capital Account, Selected Asian \nEconomies \n \nPRC\nKorea, Republic of\nThailand\nPhilippines\nMalaysia\nJapan\nSingapore\nHong Kong, China\nIndonesia\n\u20131.5 \u20131.0 \u20130.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n1995 2000 2007 2012  \n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Chinn and Ito 2008. \n ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   13 \nOne indicator of de facto openness is the ratio of the sum of stock of assets and liabilities to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP).

Magnitude of Capital Flows \n \nData in Table 3 show that net inflows to ASEAN+3 surged between 1993 and 1997 with a peak in 1995. \nThis was followed by a sharp reversal in 1998 and 1999, equivalent to a combined 3.1% of GDP. This led \nRadelet and Sachs (1999) to argue that the essence of the AFC was a huge, sudden reversal of capital \nflows, which is more prominently described as a \u201csudden stop.\u201d Net capital flows in the five hardest hit \neconomies\u2014Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand\u2014surged from \n$37.9 billion in 1994 to $97.1 billion in 1996. But in the last half of 1997, these flows suddenly reversed \ndirection, with net private capital outflows totaling $11.9 billion. Krugman (1999) succinctly states that \nthe punishment was surely disproportionate to the crime. \n \nNet capital flows surged again in 2003\u20132007. This was largely because the first 8 years of the \n21st century have been extraordinarily benign in terms of macrofinancial stability. In fact, the period \nwas often considered a new episode in economic policy making, with the world economy entering into \na \u201cgreat moderation,\u201d in which better macroeconomic management made crises a thing of the past. \nHowever, there was a sudden stop again in 2008\u20132009 in the wake of the GFC. \n \nThe level of net capital inflows to ASEAN+3 reached new highs in 2010\u20132013. The situation was \ncompounded by the massive QE by the Federal Reserve System (Fed) of the US. Between November \n2008  and  January  2013,  the  Fed  engineered  four  QE  episodes  that  resulted  in  an  expansion  of \napproximately $2.4 trillion in base money. At the same time, the yen appreciated from \u00a5104.3 per US \ndollar in September 2008 to a peak of \u00a576.36 per US dollar in January 2012, in line with its role as one of \nthe three major global currencies. Other Asian currencies also experienced substantial appreciations. \n ", "14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n \nThe Bank of Japan countered with a planned QE of $1.4 trillion over a period of 2 years beginning \nin April 2013. The ambitious scale of the operation can be gleaned from the relative size of Japan\u2019s \neconomy which is three times smaller than that of the US. Moreover, the time frame of 2 years is half that \nof the US program. In anticipation of this action from the Bank of Japan, the yen began depreciating \nbeginning late 2012 and is currently at \u00a5106.27 per US dollar. Most Asian currencies also depreciated \nduring this period. The QE of Japan injected additional liquidity into the system and net capital inflows \nsurpassed $1 trillion, equivalent to 5.3% of the GDP of 11 ASEAN+3 economies (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Magnitude of Capital Flows, ASEAN+3 \n \nItems  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000 \nCapital inflows  91.9  60.2  \u201350.9  39.7  157.1  291.5  151.5  180.3  \u2013120.8  \u2013132.8  24.9 \n% of GDP  2.3  1.3  \u20131.0  0.7  2.5  4.1  2.2  2.8  \u20132.1  \u20132.1  0.4 \nCapital outflows  97.4  91.2  23.8  99.0  187.0  265.2  81.8  304.1  51.3  \u201386.8  111.0 \n% of GDP  2.4  2.0  0.5  1.8  3.0  3.7  1.2  4.8  0.9  \u20131.3  1.6 \nNet inflows  \u20135.5  \u201331.0  \u201374.7  \u201359.4  \u201329.8  26.2  69.7  \u2013123.8  \u2013172.1  \u201346.0  \u201386.2 \n% of GDP  \u20130.1  \u20130.7  \u20131.5  \u20131.1  \u20130.5  0.4  1.0  \u20131.9  \u20133.0  \u20130.7  \u20131.2 \n \nTable 3   continued \nItems  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nCapital inflows  3.3  14.3  171.9  393.7  301.7  347.2  724.1  \u2013170.1  \u2013238.9  550.1  586.1  499.3  889.1 \n% of GDP  0.1  0.2  2.4  4.9  3.6  3.9  7.3  \u20131.5  \u20132.0  3.9  3.6  2.9  5.1 \nCapital outflows  32.2  51.5  59.1  261.5  346.2  402.0  845.4  21.1  \u2013305.2  410.7  352.5  653.8  588.6 \n% of GDP  0.5  0.8  0.8  3.3  4.1  4.5  8.5  0.2  \u20132.5  2.9  2.2  3.8  3.4 \nNet inflows  \u201328.9  \u201337.3  112.8  132.2  \u201344.5  \u201354.8  \u2013121.3  \u2013191.2  66.2  139.4  233.6  \u2013154.5  300.5 \n% of GDP  \u20130.4  \u20130.6  1.6  1.7  \u20130.5  \u20130.6  \u20131.2  \u20131.7  0.5  1.0  1.4  \u20130.9  1.7 \nASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea; GDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes: BPM6 data from 2005 onwards, BPM5 data prior to 2005.

Composition \n \nFigure 3 presents the composition of net inflows to 11 ASEAN+3 economies as a percentage of GDP. \nFDI became significant sometime in the middle of the 1990s. By the late 1990s up to the present, there \nwere many years when FDI accounted for more than half of net inflows. \n \nMeanwhile, portfolio equity inflows increased after the AFC. There was a sharp increase in \n1999 after most Asian economies reduced barriers to investment on equity markets to recapitalize \nailing banks and nonfinancial corporations (Kawai and Lamberte 2010). There was a brief lull between \n2000\u20132002 due to the bursting of the information technology bubble and the subsequent recession \nin the US. Equity inflows then contributed significantly to the surge of net capital inflows during the \nperiod 2003\u20132007.  \n \nDebt securities inflows have been a relatively small component of net capital inflows to \n11 ASEAN+3  economies.  One  of  the  causes  of  the  AFC  was  the  so-called  double  mismatch\u2014\na currency mismatch and maturity mismatch\u2014in bank balance sheets. A local bond market would be ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   15 \nthe natural environment to develop long-term, local currency denominated debt instruments that \nwould provide a more stable and reliable financing framework. This will be discussed in greater detail in \nsection V. The inflow of debt securities increased substantially in 2006\u20132007, particularly in the \nRepublic of Korea and Malaysia, but the momentum was halted by the GFC. \n \nQuite interestingly, both the AFC and the GFC are characterized by large negative flows of \n\u201cother investment.\u201d3 This type of flows or investments can readily be withdrawn by nonresidents. Apart \nfrom the smaller scale of the reversal in net inflows during the GFC, one reason why the economic \nimpact was less compared with the AFC was the continued influx of FDI. The latter has been at a \nrelatively stable level from 2005\u20132013. \n \nFigure 3: Financial Inflows, ASEAN+3 \n(% of GDP) \n \n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u20132\n\u20134\n\u20136\n\u20138\n1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nFDI PI: Equity PI: Debt OI (inc derivatives)  \nASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the \nRepublic of Korea; FDI = foreign direct investment; GDP = gross domestic product; PI = portfolio \ninvestment; OI = other investment. \nNotes: Used BPM6 data from 2005 onwards, BPM-5 data prior to 2005.

Capital Flow Wave Pattern: Surge, Stop, Withdrawal, and Retrenchment \n \nIt is useful to classify gross inflows into \u201csurges\u201d when there is a sharp increase in inflows, and \u201cstops\u201d \nwhen there is a sharp decrease in inflows (Appendix 1). For gross outflows, \u201cflight\u201d and \u201cretrenchment\u201d \nare used when outflows indicate a sharp increase and decrease, respectively. It is also useful to break \ndown the flows into three types: (i) \u201cequities\u201d\u2014consisting of direct investment and equity portfolio, \n(ii) \u201cdebt\u201d\u2014comprising of debt securities and others including derivatives, and (iii) \u201cbank\u201d flows.

The REER then began to appreciate for most of the economies \nin response to the QE. This experience underlies the volatility of capital flows. Meanwhile, Thorbecke \n(2012) reports that the Japanese REER appreciated by 30% between June 2007 and March 2009. At \nthe same time, Japanese real exports fell 40%, industrial production dropped 35%, and the Nikkei \nindex lost more than 80% of its value. Thorbecke (2012), as summarized in Thorbecke (2013), \npresents  empirical  evidence  showing  that  the  appreciation  of  the  yen  caused  exports  to  fall \nsignificantly, especially for the automobile sector. \n \nOne of the more significant changes since the AFC has been the accumulation of huge foreign \nexchange reserves by selected economies in ASEAN+3 (Table 4). For example, the PRC\u2019s reserves \nexceeded $3 trillion in 2011, equivalent to 43.7% of its GDP. As discussed earlier, foreign reserve \naccumulation is one measure to stem the appreciation of an economy\u2019s currency. Some economies \nalso heightened their reserve accumulation to protect themselves from sudden stops in capital inflows. \nThe  large  holdings  of  international  reserves  could  be  considered  excessive  for  some  of  these \neconomies (Gagnon 2014). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is preparing a policy note on the \nestablishment of a new investment tool/vehicle to further support the development of the local \ncurrency bond markets in the region with the use of foreign exchange reserves. The investment tool is \ndesigned to leverage investment from global institutional investors to help broaden investor base, \nimprove market liquidity, and reduce the risk associated with the sudden reversal of capital flows in the \nASEAN+3 region. \n \nTable 4: Foreign Exchange Reserves Net of Gold, Selected Asian Economies  \n \nLevel, $ billion  1990  1995  2000  2005  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nPRC  29.6  75.4  168.3  821.5  2,866.1  3,202.8  3,331.1  3,839.5 \nHong Kong, China  24.6  55.4  107.5  124.2  268.6  285.3  317.3  311.1 \nIndonesia  7.5  13.7  28.5  33.1  92.9  106.5  108.8  96.4 \nJapan  78.5  183.2  354.9  834.3  1,061.5  1,258.2  1,227.1  1,237.2 \nKorea, Republic of  14.8  32.7  96.1  210.3  291.5  304.3  323.2  341.6 \nMalaysia  9.8  23.8  28.3  69.9  104.9  131.8  137.8  133.4 \nPhilippines  0.9  6.4  13.1  15.9  55.4  67.3  73.5  75.7 \nSingapore  27.8  68.8  80.0  116.0  225.5  237.5  259.1  272.9 \nThailand  13.3  36.0  32.0  50.7  167.5  167.4  173.3  161.3 \nProportion of GDP, %  1990  1995  2000  2005  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nPRC  8.3  10.4  14.0  36.4  48.3  43.7  40.5  41.6 \nHong Kong, China  31.9  38.3  62.6  68.4  117.5  114.8  120.8  113.5 \nIndonesia  6.5  6.8  17.3  11.6  13.1  12.6  12.4  11.1 \nJapan  2.5  3.4  7.5  18.2  19.3  21.3  20.7  25.2 \nKorea, Republic of  5.2  5.8  17.1  23.4  26.6  25.3  26.4  26.2 \nMalaysia  22.2  26.8  30.2  48.7  42.4  45.6  45.2  42.7 \nPhilippines  2.1  8.6  16.2  15.5  27.7  30.0  29.4  27.8 \nSingapore  71.4  78.3  83.4  91.0  95.4  86.7  90.3  91.6 \nThailand  15.6  21.4  26.1  28.7  52.5  48.4  47.4  41.7 \nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People's Republic of China. \nSource: Authors' calculations using data from the IMF, International Financial Statistics; the World Bank, World Development Indicators;  \nand CEIC (accessed 9 October 2014). \n \n ", "20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \nThe growth of money supply was fairly stable for selected economies of ASEAN+3 after the \nAFC (Table 5).

Between 2003 and 2007, Indonesia, India, and the PRC experienced relatively large price \nhikes in equity markets. Other economies also recorded increases in stock prices. The GFC disrupted \nthe upward trend because of the global liquidity crunch and increased risks in global equity markets. \nThe QE strategy of the US, however, brought about a resurgence in equity prices. Indonesia and India \nremained in the forefront. The equity market in the PRC, however, lost steam owing to concerns about \nfuture economic growth, tighter money supply, and the cooling down of the property market. Thailand \nand the Philippines are the two other economies with strong growth in equity prices after the GFC. \nSharply rising equity prices likely indicate positive asset bubbles when market prices exceed the \nfundamental value. Since stocks in most of these economies are few, capital inflows lead to a surge in \ndemand, which in turn raises equity prices to levels not supported by fundamentals. Property prices are \nsubject to the same risk. The danger lies in an abrupt swing in the mispricing of risk: from a large \nunderpricing of risk to a significant overpricing of risk which happened in both the AFC and the GFC.

This was aggravated by statements of then US Fed \nChairman  Bernanke  that  tapering  might  start  reducing  new  asset  purchases  by  $20  billion  in \nSeptember 2013; end the QE completely by mid-2014; and raise interest rates afterward.  \n \nIn  the  regressions,  recent  financial  volatility  can  be  explained  by  the  interplay  of  the \nexpectation on the US Fed policy rate (as reflected in the US Federal Funds Futures (FFF) contract) \nand global risk variables. Both the FFF expectations and global risks declined from the second half of \n2012 to April 2013\u2014a period when portfolio inflows to emerging markets also became strong and, in \nmany cases, contributed to currency appreciation. From the end of May to mid-September 2013, the \nFFF rose significantly from a downward trend (due to the QE), while global risks remained stable or did \nnot  decline.  Note  that  the  FFF  declined  in  September  with  the  tapering  postponement  to \napproximately where it was before the jitters began. The evidence of market overreaction to US Fed \ntapering jitters in May to September 2013 can therefore be seen in (i) the steeper negative slope \ncoefficient for the FFF variable revealed by the regressions on the nominal effective exchange rate and \nthe price index of stocks open to foreign investors and (ii) the temporary spike in the FFF variable \nduring the period.  \n \n ", "26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \nThe model predicts that an improving global economy\u2014especially if it is quite strong and \npermanent\u2014will most likely prevent a repeat of the panic during the first tapering fear period from \n23 May 2013 to 18 September 2013, as most economies will benefit with the increase in world trade \nand the strengthening of global financial markets. This is especially true since the risk perception \nvariable exerts a stronger (with higher significance level) effect on the equity and exchange rate \nvariables. \n \nOn the other hand, it appears that there was herd mentality driving capital inflows (due to the \nQE itself) and outflows (tapering fears). Strong capital outflows, significant currency depreciation, and \nincreases  in  bond  yields  hit  economies  with  strong  macro  fundamentals,  such  as  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines,  and  Thailand,  during  the  tapering  fears  from  May  to  September  2013  (Figure  8). \nEconomies with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals\u2014such as India and Indonesia\u2014barely coped \nwith the outflows during the same period. They suffered temporary mini crises with unusually sharp \ncurrency depreciation, alarmingly strong increases in bond yields, huge capital outflows, and reserve \nlosses. Jacking up interest rates and imposing capital controls proved ineffective. These economies \nwere saved when the tapering was postponed. When the tapering was announced in December, there \nwas some brief market turbulence; but that ended a week after the late January 2014 announcement \nwas made.  \n \nThe announcement on 19 March 2014 changed the rules again as the new US Fed Chair Janet \nYellen dropped the 6.5% unemployment threshold, hinted  an end to the QE by the fall of 2014, and \nhinted a sooner-than-expected increase in interest rates 6 months later\u2014in the spring of 2015 instead \nof June 2015 as markets expected. Thus, market volatility occurred right after the announcement. But \nthe fears seemed to have died down in succeeding days even amid the Ukraine\u2013Russian Federation \ngeopolitical crisis and the fear of a major slowdown in the PRC.  \n \nQE  tapering  is  inevitable  once  the  US  and  other  major  economies  recover  sufficiently. \nEmerging markets must readjust after the exaggerated inflows and currency appreciation that came as \na result of the QE. It is clear that a strong recovery in advanced economies will be good for Asia\u2019s \nexport-oriented economies, and Japan\u2019s continuing QE may help tame any rise in global interest rates.  \n \nHowever,  financial  markets  remain  highly  sensitive  to  any  news  of  future  interest  rate \nincreases. Any hint that this would happen will again bring exaggerated fears and rumblings in the \nmarkets, with possible irrational panic and herd mentality. Thus, regional cooperation initiatives must \nbe ready, in case market overreaction reappears as Fed tapering brings the QE to an end and leads to a \nrise in global interest rates. At the height of the US Fed tapering fears, cooperation in the region \nincreased at least bilaterally. The PRC, at the peak of tapering fears in early September 2013, called on \nAsian economies to create more currency swap deals to facilitate capital flows. At around the same \ntime,  India  and  Japan  decided  to increase  their  currency  swap  arrangement  from  $15  billion  to \n$50 billion.  More  coherent  and  multilateral  regional  cooperation  and  initiatives  will  enhance  the \nprotection of economies vulnerable to global external shocks and sharp capital outflows. Equally \nimportant, economies with weaker macroeconomic fundamentals must commit to implement clear \nand meaningful structural reforms, as soon as possible, to offset any market overreaction.  \n \nThe market turmoil associated with last year\u2019s US Fed tapering episode flashed warning signals \nto economies with weak macroeconomic fundamentals\u2014like large current account or fiscal deficits, \nunsustainable debt, and high inflation. India and Indonesia took the necessary initial steps toward \nstructural reform after being hit hard by the first tapering fears. This also explains why they were less \naffected when tapering was actually announced in December 2013 and January 2014. ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   27 \nEconometric estimation suggests that the US QE taper variable triggers capital outflow from \nthe region, although this is partly offset by improvement in global risk conditions. Had the global risk \nconditions been moving in the negative territory, the region would have experienced greater capital \noutflow. More importantly, it seems that a market overreaction was evident. \n \nB.  Analysis of Global and Regional Spillover and Contagion Effects \nAzis, Mitra, and Baluga (2013) analyzed the nature of global and regional spillover and contagion \neffects using bivariate Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. \nTheir  results  show  that  while  Asian  government  bond  returns  and  volatilities  are  influenced  by \ndynamics of their own markets, contagion effects from the Lehman and eurozone crises were also \nsignificant in some countries  (Tables 8 and 9; Appendix 3 for the methodology). In particular, the \nshock spillovers in 2008\u20132009 following the Lehman collapse affected six Asian markets\u2014the PRC, \nThailand, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, India, and the Philippines, whereas spillovers from the \neurozone  crisis  in  2011  affected  four  markets\u2014the  PRC,  Thailand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and \nIndonesia. The strongest shock spillovers during the eurozone crisis were in the PRC. In fact, the shock \nspillover coefficients throughout emerging Asia were generally higher during the 2008\u20132009 GFC \nthan during the 2011 eurozone crisis, except for the PRC. \n \nTable 8: Shock and Volatility Spillovers  \n(coefficients significant at 5% level) \n \n  Shock Spillover  Volatility Spillover \nLehman Collapse  Eurozone Debt Crisis  Lehman Collapse  Eurozone Debt Crisis \nAsian  Asian  Asian  Asian \nSource Market  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient \nUS treasury bond  \n(10-year)  Malaysia  0.1013                   \n   Thailand  0.0523                   \n   PRC  0.0149                   \nUS high-yield corporate \nbond  Malaysia  0.4867        PRC  0.8546       \nKorea, \n   Republic of  0.3875                   \n   India  0.2541                   \n   Philippines  0.2021                   \nGerman bunds (10-\nyear)        PRC  0.0139        India  0.0007 \n         Thailand  0.0092             \n         Indonesia  0.0053             \nKorea, \n           Republic of  0.0011             \nEU composite government  \nbond (10-year)     PRC  0.1619        Japan  0.8064 \nKorea,  \n                       Republic of  0.0869 \n                     Thailand  0.0353 \nEU high-yield corporate \nbond        PRC  0.0956        Philippines  1.9797 \n         Thailand  0.0426        Thailand  0.3600 \nEU = European Union, PRC = People's Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Azis, Mitra, and Baluga 2013. \n   \n ", "28   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \nTable 9: Shock and Volatility Persistence  \n(coefficients significant at 5% level) \n \n  Own Shock Persistence  Own Volatility Persistence \n   Lehman Collapse  Eurozone Debt Crisis  Lehman Collapse  Eurozone Debt Crisis \nAsian  Asian  Asian  Asian \nSource Market  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient  Market  Coefficient \nUS treasury bond  \n(10-year)  Thailand  0.3013        Japan  0.9905       \n   Indonesia  0.1384        Philippines  0.8849       \nKorea, \n   India  0.1303          Republic of  0.8808       \n   PRC  0.1281        Indonesia  0.8416       \nKorea,  \n     Republic of  0.0883        PRC  0.7849       \n   Philippines  0.0843        India  0.7128       \n               Thailand  0.6589       \n               Malaysia  0.5795       \nUS high-yield corporate \nbond  Thailand  0.3969        Indonesia  0.8464       \n   India  0.2888        Philippines  0.8207       \nKorea, \n   PRC  0.1352          Republic of  0.7942       \n   Indonesia  0.1343        Thailand  0.6674       \n   Philippines  0.1198        Malaysia  0.6556       \n   Malaysia  0.0580        PRC  0.5574       \nKorea,  \n     Republic of  0.0480        India  0.5315       \nKorea,  \nGerman bunds (10-year)        Indonesia  0.3037          Republic of  0.8562 \n         Malaysia  0.1359        PRC  0.8340 \n         Philippines  0.0923        India  0.8159 \nKorea, \n           Republic of  0.0880        Malaysia  0.7330 \n         India  0.0840        Indonesia  0.7185 \n         Japan  0.0821        Thailand  0.5692 \n         PRC  0.0638             \nEU composite government  \nbond (10-year)     Indonesia  0.1694        Philippines  0.8859 \n         India  0.1194        Thailand  0.8331 \n         Malaysia  0.0846        PRC  0.8161 \n         Philippines  0.0633        Indonesia  0.8016 \nKorea, \n           Republic of  0.0559        India  0.7984 \n         Thailand  0.0337        Malaysia  0.7455 \nKorea,  \n                       Republic of  0.6476 \nEU high-yield corporate  Korea,  \nbond        PRC  0.2155          Republic of  0.8649 \n         Indonesia  0.2010        India  0.8373 \n         Malaysia  0.1535        Malaysia  0.7918 \n         Japan  0.0920        Indonesia  0.7606 \n         India  0.0799        PRC  0.6928 \n         Philippines  0.0653        Japan  0.5501 \nKorea, \n           Republic of  0.0469             \nEU = European Union, PRC = People's Republic of China, US = United States. \nSource: Azis, Mitra, and Baluga 2013. ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   29 \nDuring the 2008\u20132009 crisis, the most significant shock spillovers came from the US high-\nyield corporate bond market, which affected local bond markets in the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, \nIndia, and the Philippines. Similarly, there were shock spillovers from high-yielding EU corporate bond \nmarkets into local bond markets in the PRC and Thailand, and from the EU composite bond index into \nthe PRC. In terms of volatility spillovers, perturbations in high-yield US corporate bond markets \nsignificantly affected local bond markets in the PRC in the 2008\u20132009 crisis; whereas during the \neurozone crisis, volatile EU corporate (financial) bonds significantly affected markets in the Philippines \nand Thailand. These results highlight the uncertainty surrounding the transmission of spillovers from \nthe ongoing debt crisis in the eurozone to Asia\u2019s local currency bond markets. Such transmissions \nimply that Asian authorities should be prepared for any possible disruptive impacts of spillovers from \nmature markets (Azis, Mitra, and Baluga 2013).  \n \nMore recent analysis of regional spillover suggests that the role of shock spillover from Japan \nseems to be getting stronger, while that of the US has weakened (Table 10). 4 However, this varies \ndepending on the variable and regional group under consideration.

The main areas for consideration are policies to influence the composition \nof capital flows toward a greater share of FDI, macroprudential policies to support financial stability, \nexchange rate coordination to reduce the resistance of policy makers to currency appreciation, and \nregional financial cooperation to address possible externalities in capital flows. \n \nMost of these policies are derived from country experiences and literature reviews. Those that \nrelate to the process of regional cooperation in Asia are discussed in a separate section. Capital \ncontrols are a subset of macroprudential polices.

This \nsection looks into how the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) can be structured to attract more \nFDI into Southeast Asia.5 \n \nThe removal of regulatory and legal barriers to international capital flows and the participation \nof foreign investors in domestic firms and financial markets will lead to more FDI, but significant \nincreases in FDI can be realized only if the most important sectors are opened up and member states \nimprove  their  core  business  environment.  This  requires  that  member  states  implement \ncomplementary policies that help improve the investment climate. \n \nIndividual ASEAN countries are facing the huge challenge of improving their competitiveness. \nAs many experts have noted, a large market is a powerful draw for investors, but multinational \ncorporations  serving  global  markets  increasingly  look  for  world-class  infrastructure;  skilled  and \nproductive workers; innovative capabilities; and an agglomeration of efficient suppliers, competitors, \nsupport  institutions,  and  services.  To  be  successful,  the  implementation  of  the  AEC  must  be \naccompanied by complementary policies and programs, especially at the national level. For example, \nmember states would do well to: \n \n(i)  continue  implementing  reforms  under  the  AEC  and  the  ASEAN  Comprehensive \nInvestment Area (ACIA) commensurate with improvements in their domestic business \nenvironment, including economic regulations, corporate governance, and labor policies; \n(ii)  develop logistics infrastructure and strengthen legal systems to increase FDI inflows; and \n(iii)  devise,  unilaterally  and  collectively,  structural  adjustment  and  reform  assistance \nprograms as well as capacity building measures to help those who could be adversely \naffected by reforms. \n \nIn a comprehensive study of the impact of the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) on FDI inflows \nto ASEAN, Plummer (2007) concludes that the AIA has had a generally positive effect and has helped \nopen up sectors and reduce barriers to investment. To strengthen and enhance the AIA, the author \nproposes the following actions: \n \nIntroduce collective measures to be taken by all the ASEAN member states and encourage \nindividual  member  states  to  lower  transaction  costs  and  strengthen  market  factors  to  facilitate \ninvestment and promote regional production networks. \n \n(i)  Widen  the  scope  of  industries  by  transferring  Mode  3  services  from  the  ASEAN \nFramework Agreement on Services (AFAS) to the AIA. \n(ii)  Combine  the  AIA,  the  1987  Agreement  for  the  Promotion  and  Protection  of \nInvestments,  and  appropriate  provisions  of  bilateral  investment  treaties  into  a \ncomprehensive \u201cAIA-Plus\u201d agreement. (The AIA was eventually expanded to ACIA). \n                                                 \n5  The discussion is lifted from Aldaba, Yap, and Petri (2009), 106\u2013108. \n ", "32   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n(iii)  Harmonize  national  provisions  on  equity  ownership,  land  tenure,  nondiscriminatory \ntaxation, movement of skilled labor, and financial flows at the ASEAN regional level to \nensure national treatment. \n(iv)  Consolidate timeframes for actions. \n(v)  Identify and then remove investment impediments, using specific procedures, and within \na specific timeframe. \n(vi)  Reduce the number of industries and sectors under the sensitive list and review those \ncovered, with a view toward a phaseout. \n(vii)  Make  the  AIA-Plus  an  integral  part  of  the  AEC,  as  its  provisions  would  cover \ninvestments, services, capital flows, and skilled labor associated with investment. \n(viii) Establish a mechanism for monitoring progress. \n(ix)  Expand  the  mandate  of  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  and  strengthen  its  technical  and \nanalytical capabilities. \n \nThese recommendations were made several years ago but most of them remain relevant in the \nbuild up toward the establishment of the AEC at the end of 2015. \n \nB.  Macroprudential Policies \n \nPotential costs of capital inflows can be minimized. Macroprudential policy can act as a safeguard for \nfinancial stability, in particular to deal with the credit and asset price cycles driven by global capital \nflows  (Zhang  and  Zoli  2014).  The  experience  with  both  the  AFC  and  the  GFC  showed  that \nmacroprudential policy should be implemented in order to prevent financial volatility from overcoming \nsound macroeconomic fundamentals. Zhang and Zoli (2014) find that over time, Asian economies \nappear to have made greater use of macroprudential tools, especially housing-related measures, than \ntheir counterparts in other regions. Their analysis suggests that macroprudential policy and capital flow \nmeasures have helped curb housing price growth, equity flows, credit growth, and bank leverage. The \ninstruments  that have been particularly effective in this regard include loan-to-value ratio caps, \nhousing tax measures, and foreign currency-related measures. These are similar to the findings of \nMolnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai (2013). \n \nFigure 3 shows the level and composition of capital inflows into 11 ASEAN+3 economies. The \ncomposition affects the degree of volatility of capital flows and therefore, the risk of \u201csudden stops\u201d \n(section III, and Figures 4 and 5). The higher share of FDI during the GFC episode compared with the \nAFC is an important factor in explaining why the ASEAN+3 economies were not as hard hit by the \nGFC. Moreover, it is believed that the behavior of domestic investors during periods of financial stress \nis more stabilizing than that of foreign investors (Jeanne 2014). To influence both the composition and \nlevel of capital flows, macroprudential policies have to be put in place. But with the advent of greater \nfinancial integration, capital controls\u2014a form of macroprudential policy\u2014must be endorsed at the \ninternational level in order to be effective (Grenville 2012). In the absence of such an endorsement, for \nexample from the IMF, regional cooperation on capital controls is a second best solution. Regional \ncooperation on macroprudential policy can also address possible policy spillovers, (e.g., cross-border \nimpacts  of  blanket  guarantees  of  deposit  insurance,  capital  control  measures,  or  adoption  of \nmacroprudential policies), which could have side effects on capital flows that could be destabilizing for \nother economies in the region (Kawai and Morgan 2014).  \n \nAnother reason that macroprudential policies have become important is because the specific \ncause of a crisis becomes different with each episode. Macroprudential policies can reduce systemic \nrisk by reducing excessive capital flows. However, macroprudential policies have to be implemented ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   33 \nwith caution. For one thing, Azis (2014) argues that monetary policy has to take into account the \nmacroeconomic effects emanating from macroprudential policy, and vice versa. This is related to one \nof  the  building  blocks  of  macroprudential  policy,  which  consists  of  designing  a  set  of  internally \nconsistent macroeconomic policies involving both monetary and fiscal policies (Brunschwig et al. \n2011). One argument is that reasonable prudential policies may not suffice to maintain financial \nstability if they are not supported by practical monetary policies. For example, raising credit standards \nwill not effectively contain excessive leverage if very low interest rates are maintained for so long that \nthey foment excessive risk-taking. \n \nC.  Capital Controls \n \nThe main issue with regard to capital controls is their effectiveness. This will depend largely on the nature \nof the flows, the structure of the economy, and the capacity of the economic authorities. The study of \nMolnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai (2013) provides a useful empirical analysis for the Asia and Pacific \nregion. It has two main objectives: (i) to assess the degree of countries\u2019 openness to capital flows and its \nvariation across countries and over time and (ii) to investigate what types of factors\u2014including different \ntypes of controls on the flow of capital\u2014drive sudden changes in various types of inflows and outflows. \nThe major findings are as follows (Molnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai 2013, 32\u201334):  \n \nTargeted controls appear effective. Capital inflow bonanzas on the portfolio account can \nbest  be  prevented  by  not  allowing  residents  to  sell,  issue,  or  purchase  bonds  abroad  or \nnonresidents to sell or issue equities in the domestic market. Selling or issuing bonds abroad by \nresidents is mostly in larger quantities due to the fixed costs of issuance and the economies of \nscale; therefore, restricting this activity is clearly a way to avoid large and sudden inflows. A \nsimilar explanation may hold for foreign equity issues in the domestic market. To avoid debt \nportfolio inflow bonanzas, the key is to limit the inflow  of money market and collective \ninvestment instruments. Among the inflow measures, it is the sale or issuance abroad of \nmoney market or collective investment instruments by residents that are shown to be effective \nto avoid debt portfolio investment booms.  \n \nThe policy environment matters. Previous inflows of the respective type of capital have an \nindependent explanatory power in determining inflow bonanzas. That is, increasing inflows \nmay be a warning sign of a coming boom. Conversely, the stock of inflows appears to have a \nnegative impact on the probability of an inflow bonanza in the case of equities and positive in \nthe case of cross-border credit, though in this latter case, only for large inflows. The stock of \ninflows  does  not  appear  to  affect  the  probability  of  portfolio  investment  inflow  booms. \nPrevious growth performance of the domestic economy increases the probability of equity \ninflow booms, but not of other types of capital. Global risk appetite also makes inflow booms \nmore likely in the case of overall inflows, equity portfolio investment and cross-border lending. \nIn the case of financial credit bonanzas, the depth of the financial system is an important \ndeterminant of bonanzas\u2014deeper financial markets are less  prone to experience volatile \ninflows. This finding has direct policy implications\u2014the deepening of financial markets can \nreduce the probability of volatile flows; or, without deep financial markets, it may be hazardous \nto open up the capital account to cross-border flows. \n \nControlling resident flows appears more effective. The pattern emerged from the analyses \nof the determinants of the probability of inflow bonanzas suggests that control measures \ntargeting residents may be more effective than those targeting nonresidents. In particular, \nrestricting the sale or issuance of equities, bonds, money market instruments and collective \n ", "34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \ninvestment instruments abroad by residents, appeared effective in reducing the probability of \ninflow surges.  \n \nIn  addition,  limiting  the  purchase  of  bonds,  money  market  instruments  and  collective \ninvestment  instruments  by  residents  also  seems  to  effectively  reduce  the  probability  of  inflow \nbonanzas that is more puzzling. While the sale or purchase of such instruments is an outflow from the \nbalance of payments\u2019 point of view, the restriction of purchasing such instruments may affect the \nprobability of sudden inflows by inhibiting the ability of domestic investors to repatriate large amounts \nof funds previously invested in these instruments owing to, for instance, heightening of global risk \naversion or urgent repatriation needs related to the domestic economic environment or business \noperations. In contrast, restricting flows of foreign-owned capital appears to work only in a few cases, \nsuch as controlling collective investment instruments, in particular, their sale locally by nonresidents \nand the sale and issuance of bonds by nonresidents. \n \nAnother proposal on the implementation of capital controls has been provided by Gochoco-\nBautista and Rhee (2013). They suggest that the absence of persistent current account imbalances be \na precondition to the use of capital controls. This is anchored on the principle that a country\u2019s \nsovereign right to use all available tools and implement policies that they deem best should be \nrespected, as long as there are no substantial negative externalities on other countries. \n \nD.  Exchange Rate Coordination Has to Be Reconsidered \n \nOne reason for the concern over currency appreciation is that policy makers are concerned that \ndomestic firms will lose competitiveness either in the domestic or global markets. The exchange rate \nalso influences the current account and was a key factor in the AFC. It will be useful if the exchange \nrate can be part of the monitoring and surveillance process in Asia. There need not even be reference \nto  a  long-term  goal  of  a  single  currency.  Exchange  rate  coordination  can  be  conducted  at  a \nrudimentary level. What is important is to determine if there are sizable changes in the REERs that may \nlead to imbalances; or else, macroeconomic imbalances can cause excessive exchange rate volatility. \n \nThis issue was examined recently by Kawai and Pontines (2014). They too find that since \n2000, the PRC authorities and those of most East Asian currencies have increased their exchange rate \nflexibility against the US dollar. They also consider how greater regional monetary and currency \ncoordination could help to achieve intra-East Asian exchange rate stability. Given that the renminbi \noperates on a standard drawing right (SDR) basket system (comprising the US dollar, euro, pound \nsterling, and yen) and most other East Asian currencies on an SDR+ basket system (comprising the \nsame currencies plus an emerging East Asian currency such as the renminbi), achieving intraregional \nexchange rate stability may be difficult. For a start, the PRC would have to reduce the weight of the US \ndollar in its dollar-dominant SDR basket system and increase exchange rate flexibility substantially if \nsignificant capital account liberalization is to be achieved. The study suggests that a transition to \ngreater convergence of exchange rate regimes would have to begin with similar managed floating \nregimes based on an SDR or SDR+ basket and then move to an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) basket \nonce sufficient economic and structural convergence has been achieved among the economies. \n \nThis study does not recommend any particular approach to exchange rate coordination. What \nis important is to resurrect this issue and make it part of the agenda of either the Economic Review and \nPolicy Dialogue (ERPD) or the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), or both. \n \n ", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   35 \nE.  Regional Financial Cooperation \n \nAn effective policy agenda for financial liberalization focuses on maximizing the gains and minimizing \nthe risks associated with financial development. Such an agenda would entail adoption of policy \nmeasures at all levels: domestic, regional, and international. A major issue in this section is how regional \nfinancial cooperation can facilitate the transition to financial openness, including capital account \nliberalization. ADB (2008) identifies the major weaknesses in any given financial regime to be: \n \n(i)  insufficient market opening and capital account liberalization; \n(ii)  limited and varying degrees of transparency, financial regulation, financial supervision, \nand governance; \n(iii)  inadequacies in risk management in financial firms and markets; and \n(iv)  the  heterogeneity  of  supervisory,  accounting  and  auditing  rules,  and  regulatory \nframeworks across countries. \n \nA  prioritized  agenda  for  countries  deepening  their  financial  development  would  include: \n(i) strengthening the banking sector primarily by improving its regulation and supervision; (ii) adoption \nof international norms and standards; and (iii) promotion of capital markets, especially local currency \nbond markets, to create the liquidity and innovative financial products required to attract a broader \nand more diversified investor base. \n \nCan regional financial cooperation in Asia advance the development of the financial system \nand if so, how? The main avenue is through the development of the local bond market, which would be \nthe natural environment to develop long-term, local currency-denominated debt instruments that \nwould provide a more stable and reliable financing framework. Many Asian economists and policy \nmakers argued that an integrated Asian bond market would be valuable in achieving such a liability \nstructure  (Ito  and  Park  2004).  Following  this  view,  Asian  authorities  initiated  various  regional \ninitiatives to strengthen and deepen local currency bond markets. The monetary authorities of East \nAsia  launched  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI),  which  focuses  on  the  supply  side  or \ninfrastructure  of  bond  markets,  including  clearing  and  settlement  systems,  rating  agencies,  and \ndenomination currencies.  \n \nMeanwhile, the Executives' Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks launched the Asian \nBond Fund in 2003 to promote the development of national and regional bond markets by directly \ncreating bond funds. The Asian Bond Fund framework has made local currency bonds more attractive \nto investors and helped develop deeper and more liquid national bond markets. It has also encouraged \nregulatory and tax reforms\u2014for instance, prompting some national governments to offer withholding \ntax exemptions on investment income to nonresident investors and others to loosen capital controls. \n \nSince 2008, ASEAN+3 has focused on four key areas in developing the local currency bond \nmarkets (LCBMs) under ABMI, namely: (i) promoting issuance of local currency bonds (LCBs), \n(ii) facilitating the demand of LCBs, (iii) improving the regulatory framework, and (iv) improving \nrelated infrastructure for bond markets. \n \nThe establishment of the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) was a measure \nintended to promote the issuance of LCBs. The CGIF is an important outcome of the ABMI that has \nbeen gradually developed since 2005 through policy dialogue, close coordination, and collaboration \nbetween ASEAN+3 and ADB. The finance ministers endorsed the creation of a credit guarantee and \n ", "36   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \ninvestment  mechanism  as  a  trust  fund  of  ADB. The  establishment  of  the  CGIF  trust  fund  was \napproved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in April 2010, with an initial capital of $700 million. The CGIF \nseeks to promote the development of Asian bond markets by providing guarantees for investors that \nmake it easier for firms to issue local currency bonds with longer maturities. Longer term, it is expected \nto promote the harmonization of standards and practices for bond issuance and help channel Asia\u2019s \nsavings to finance long-term investment in local currencies, notably in regional infrastructure and other \nkey areas. This, in turn, will promote regional financial market integration, make Asia less vulnerable to \nexternal shocks, and boost economic growth. CGIF is expected to issue several credit guarantees for \nbonds issued within the region in 2014. There could be a new call for capital increase as CGIF has \nalready increased its leverage ratio from 1 to 2.5. \n \nTo facilitate the demand for LCBs, ASEAN+3 has established and funded the operations of \nwww.asianbondsonline.adb.org and the publication of the Asian Bond Monitor in order to provide \ninformation on the development of LCBMs in the region to market participants. A study on Broadening \nInvestor Base for LCBMs in ASEAN+2 (Japan was excluded) was also undertaken to provide policy \nrecommendations to member countries on measures to broaden investor base for LCBs to help \nminimize the impact of reversal of capital flows on member countries. \n \nASEAN+3 established the Asian Bond Market Forum (ABMF) in 2010 as a common platform \nto foster standardization of market practices and harmonization of regulations relating to cross-border \nbond transactions in the region.  To provide information on market regulations and practices in 11 \nASEAN+3 economies, a bond market guide is provided in www.asianbondsonline.adb.org. ABMF is \nalso developing an  ASEAN+3 Multi-currency Bond Issuance Framework, a common regional bond \nissuance program to allow qualified issuers from any country in ASEAN+3 to issue LCBs in any \nASEAN+3  currency  in  the  ASEAN+3  region.  ABMF  is  also  working  toward  streamlining  bond \ntransaction flows, including more simplified disclosure requirements. \n \n ", " \nAPPENDIXES \n \nAppendix 1: Methodology for Identifying Capital Flow Wave Episodes \n \nThe methodology for identifying the episodes is adopted from the Capital Flow Waves: Surges, Stops, \nFlight, and Retrenchment paper by Forbes and Warnock (2011).

", "Managing Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues\nGlobal capital flows into emerging markets, including those in Asia, continue to be volatile. These capital \nflows generate both benefits and costs. The latter are associated with episodes of currency and banking \ncrises like the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial and economic crisis. Recent data show \nthat the main impact of capital flows on the economies of East Asia is reflected in real effective exchange \nrates, equity prices, and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. In particular, econometric results show \nthe strong linkages between the United States bond markets and those in Asia, particularly the adverse \nimpact of quantitative easing tapering on Asian economies. These findings support the important role of \nmacroprudential policy, which can be implemented in the context of regional cooperation in order to reduce \nnegative spillovers across economies in Asia.\nMAnAgIng CApItAl FlOws \nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nIn AsIA: An OvervIew OF \nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty.
