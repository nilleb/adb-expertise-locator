These \ncapital flows generate both benefits and costs. The latter are associated with episodes of currency and \nbanking  crises  like  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  and  the  2008  global  financial  and  economic  crisis. \nPolicy responses can be implemented to minimize the costs. At the same time, policy responses should \nvary depending on whether \u201cpull\u201d factors or \u201cpush\u201d factors dominate the capital flows. Data show that \nthe main impact of capital flows on economies of East Asia is reflected in real effective exchange rates, \nequity  prices,  and  accumulation  of  foreign  exchange  reserves.  If  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  are  dominant,  policy \nmakers  should  allow  real  exchange  rates  to  appreciate  in  the  long-term.  Three  broad  categories  of \nmacroeconomic  measures  are  available  to  countries  facing  surges  of  capital  inflows,  if  they  are  not \nwilling  to  allow  the  nominal  exchange  rate  to  appreciate:  (i)  sterilized  intervention,  (ii)  greater \nexchange rate flexibility, and (iii) fiscal tightening (preferably through expenditure cuts). However, all \nof them have major drawbacks. Instead, capital controls or, more generally, macroprudential policy can \nbe  considered.  Other  policy  recommendations  include  measures  to  encourage  foreign  direct \ninvestment,  as  this  type  of  capital  flow  is  more  stable  and  beneficial;  exchange  rate  coordination  to \nreduce the adverse impacts of currency appreciation on the global competitiveness of domestic firms; \nand regional financial cooperation, particularly in the development of local bond markets. Recent data \nshow  the  adverse  impact  of  Quantitative  Easing  tapering  on  Asian  economies.  This  is  verified  by \neconometric results showing the strong linkages between the United States bond markets and those in \nAsia.  These  findings  enhance  the  role  of  macroprudential  policy,  which  can  be  implemented  in  the \ncontext of regional cooperation in order to reduce negative spillovers across economies in Asia. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: capital flows, exchange rates, regional cooperation, volatility \n \nJEL Classification: F31, F32, F36 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \nEconomic performance of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s  Republic of \nChina (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) countries are highly sensitive to the global \nfinancial  environment.  The  first  half  of  2013  started  with  another  quarter  of  capital  inflows  into  the \nregion.  Coupled  with  relatively  sustained  growth  of  the  ASEAN+3  economies,  the  loose  monetary \npolicies of advanced economies had been driving money into the region. However, both of these push \nand  pull  factors  gradually  lost  strength  in  the  second  quarter.  Following  Chairman  Bernanke\u2019s \nstatement  on  possible  tapering  of  the  United  States  (US)  quantitative  easing  (QE)  in  May  2013, \ninvestors  have  become  increasingly  concerned  about  an  exit  from  easy  monetary  conditions, \nnotwithstanding the announcement of an aggressive expansionary policy in Japan. Lack of clarity of in \nthe  timing  and  process  has  resulted  in  volatile  flows  of  capital,  with  and  many  of  the  ASEAN+3 \neconomies experienced outflows of capitals from the bond and equity markets, along with rising risk \npremiums.  \n \n\nTo date, the policy lever in the US has normalized and capital flows are returning to the region. \nYet  the  global  economy  still  faces  a  number  of  uncertainties  in  the  coming  years.  One  immediate \nuncertainty is the evolution of monetary and fiscal policy in advanced economies and its impact on the \nglobal economy. Another uncertainty is that all major economies\u2014the US, the European Union (EU), \nthe PRC, Japan, and emerging economies collectively\u2014are all undergoing major structural adjustments \n5  years  after  the  global  financial  crisis  (GFC).  The  impact  of  these  structural  adjustments  is  also \nuncertain. Global uncertainties will affect global liquidity conditions, and subsequently create volatile \ncapital flows to and from ASEAN+3. \n \n\nThis paper is the regional overview of a study that aims: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nto  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  dynamic  nature  of  global  liquidity\u2014the  factors \ndriving global liquidity as well as the transmission channels to the ASEAN+3 markets; and \nto  take  stock  of  lessons  learned  with  respect  to  impacts,  policies,  and  implications  of \nvolatile capital flows on the ASEAN+3 economies. \n\n(iii)  Based on lessons learned, the next task is to design policy frameworks and guidelines to \n\ndeal with future challenges in managing capital flows. \n\n \nFor this regional overview, we are interested in identifying the primary transmission channels of \nglobal  liquidity  into  the  ASEAN+3  economies.  Selected  questions  to  be  discussed  in  this  section \ninclude: \n \n\n(i)  Have all different episodes of global liquidity expansion affected the regional economies \n\n(ii)  What  were  the  transmission  channels  of  these  shocks  (i.e.,  bank  lending,  portfolio \n\n(iii)  Have  there  been  consistent  transmission  channels  across  different  episodes  of  global \n\nof the ASEAN+3? \n\nflows)? \n\nliquidity expansion? \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \nGlobal capital flows remain an important issue in international finance. In the aftermath of the 2008 \nglobal financial and economic crisis, capital flows to emerging countries surged again. There have been \nsimilar  episodes  in  the  past  3  decades,  including  one  that  culminated  in  the  1997\u20131998  East  Asian \nfinancial  crisis  (AFC).  Meanwhile,  the  GFC  was  followed  by  an  unprecedented  easing  of  monetary \npolicy  by  both  the  US  and  Japan.  This  contributed  to  concerns  about  volatile  capital  flows  and  the \nstability of the global financial system. \n \n\nThe  problems  that  have  emerged  in  the  various  episodes  are  like  a  refrain  in  a  song: \nappreciating currencies that could lead to exchange rate overshooting, pressure on asset prices, which \ncan  result  in  bubbles  that  amplify  financial  fragility  and  crisis  risk,  and  the  possibility  of  overheating, \nresulting in inflation. The macroeconomic difficulties spawned by the volatility of capital inflows have \nelicited various policy responses (IMF 2007): \n \n\n\u201cWhereas  some  countries  have  let  exchange  rates  move  upward,  in  many  cases  the \nmonetary  authorities  have  intervened  heavily  in  foreign  exchange  markets  to  resist \nheavy  currency  appreciation.  To  varying  degrees,  they  have  sought  to  neutralize  the \nmonetary  impact  of  intervention  through  sterilization,  with  a  view  to  forestalling  an \nexcessively  rapid  expansion  of  domestic  demand.  Controls  on  capital  inflows  have \nbeen  introduced  or  tightened,  and  controls  on  outflows  eased,  to  relieve  upward \npressure  on  exchange  rates.  Fiscal  policies  have  also  responded\u2014in  some  cases, \nstronger revenue growth from buoyant activity  has  been harnessed to achieve better \nfiscal  outcomes,  although  in  many  countries  rising  revenues  have  led  to  higher \ngovernment spending.\u201d \n\n \n\nAs  a  result  of  this  type  of  policy  responses,  the  typical  macro  configuration  in  emerging \nmarkets in Asia after the AFC was slower growth, less investment, current account surpluses replacing \ndeficits, and a successful management of the exchange rates to keep exports competitive, involving a \nlarge buildup in foreign exchange reserves (Grenville 2012). \n\n \nThis paper looks into the experience of the ASEAN+3 economies with regard to capital flows \nduring the period 1990 to the present. Emphasis will be on the last 3 years (2011\u20132013) since previous \nwork has covered the earlier period adequately (e.g., Kawai and Lamberte 2010). The next section will \nreview the major  issues with regard to  capital flows. Section III  will present  data that show trends  of \ncapital  flows  in  ASEAN+3  and  their  impact  for  the  period  1990\u20132013.  This  will  be  followed  by  a \ndiscussion  on  the  economic  environment  in  ASEAN+3  based  on  recent  indicators  from  the  Asia \nRegional Integration Center. The last section deals with policy issues. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHEORETICAL AND POLICY ISSUES \n\nDeterminants of Capital Flows \n\n \nA. \n \nThe surge in capital flows to emerging market economies in the past 30 years is a reflection of the rapid \nexpansion  and  integration  of  international  capital  markets  that  had  been  driven  by  economic  policy \nand  structural  changes,  and  technological  factors.  The  latter  refer  to  revolutionary  advances  in \nhandling  of  information  and  telecommunications,  and  the  emergence  of  increasingly  sophisticated \nfinancial  engineering.  These  factors  have  increased  the  speed  and  complexity  of  capital  account \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   3 \n\ntransactions.  Meanwhile,  economic  policy  and  structural  changes  from  the  standpoint  of  developing \neconomies can be categorized into two broad groups: those that are country-specific, or \u201cpull\u201d factors; \nand those that are external to the country and beyond its control, or \u201cpush\u201d factors. \n \n\nOne  set  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  were  policies  that  improved  the  relations  of  heavily  indebted \ncountries  with  external  creditors.  A  key  element  was  the  role  of  debt\u2013equity  swaps  in  increasing  the \nexpected  rate  of  return  on  domestic  investment  projects,  thereby  encouraging  foreign  direct \ninvestment (FDI) (Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart 1994). Successful price stabilization programs that \nwere accompanied by improved fiscal policy fundamentals and greater macroeconomic stability were \nalso  major  pull  factors.  Lastly,  institutional  reforms,  such  as  the  liberalization  of  the  capital  account, \nplayed a significant role in attracting capital flows. Indeed, the right to repatriate dividends and capital \nmay  have  been  the  most  important  factor  in  the  surge  of  foreign  equity  flows  to  emerging  market \neconomies (Taylor and Sarno 1997). \n\n \nGrenville  (2012)  has  a  more  intricate  view  of  pull  factors:  \u201cAs  emerging  countries  converge \ntoward the technological frontier their capital stock is being built up from modest per capita starting \nlevels, to eventually match the levels of the developed economies at some time in the future. During \nthis  transition,  productivity  will  greatly  increase  and  returns  to  capital  will  be  high:  the  Wicksellian \n\u2018natural\u2019  interest  rate  in  the  emerging  countries  will  be  substantially  higher  than  in  the  developed \neconomies. This might be expected to be the principal underlying driver of capital flows.\u201d \n\n \nAmong  the  prominent  \u201cpush\u201d  factors  were  the  decline  in  international  interest  rates  and \neconomic  recessions  in  industrialized  countries.  These  factors  reduced  profit  opportunities  in  world \nfinancial centers and drove international capital to emerging market economies. Another type of push \nfactor  was  through  contagion  effects.  Large  shifts  in  capital  flows  to  one  or  two  large  countries  in  a \nregion may have generated externalities for the smaller neighboring countries (Calvo, Leiderman, and \nReinhart 1996). \n \nIn terms of actual policy adjustments, regulatory changes in the US and Europe made it easier \nfor foreign firms to make their equity and bonds more attractive to investors. This facilitated the trend \ntoward  international  portfolio  diversification.  Meanwhile,  competition  and  rising  labor  costs  in \nindustrialized countries, along with falling transport  and communication costs, induced firms to seek \nopportunities  to  increase  efficiency  and  returns  by  producing  abroad.  The  realignment  of  major \ncurrencies contributed to this process. The result  has been a progressive globalization of production \nand the growth of FDI flows. \n\n \nA  crucial  debate  has  been  on  the  relative  importance  of  \u201cpull\u201d  and  \u201cpush\u201d  factors  in  the \nevolution of capital flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors were the primary determinants of capital flows into emerging \nmarket economies, this would support the optimistic view that the sustainability of these flows is to a \nlarge  extent a  function  of  domestic  policies  under  the  control  of  developing  countries.  On  the  other \nhand,  if  the  surge  in  capital  flows  was  mostly  a  result  of  \u201cpush\u201d  factors,  particularly  interest  rate \nmovements, this would support the view that capital flows are highly volatile because they are subject \nto factors beyond the control of policy makers (Fernandez-Arias 1996). \n \n\nThe empirical evidence has generally been mixed. Some analysts argue that the weight of the \nevidence  favors  the  push  view\u2014that  falling  US  interest  rates  have  played  a  dominant  role  in  driving \ncapital flows to developing countries (Fernandez-Arias and Montiel 1996). Other studies have shown \nthat country-specific factors\u2014e.g., the domestic credit rating and black market exchange premium\u2014\nhave  been  as  important  in  influencing  capital  flows,  particularly  portfolio  flows  (Taylor  and  Sarno \n\n \n\n\f4   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\n1997). The primacy of \u201cpull\u201d factors, however, can be questioned on several counts. Although it is true \nthat not all countries have been recipients of the new inflows, it is also true that flows have not been \nrestricted  to  countries  with  well-established  track  records  of  macroeconomic  and  structural \nadjustment. Second, country creditworthiness depends not only on domestic factors but also on the \ninternational  interest  rate.  Third,  the  significant  role  of  contagion  in  the  AFC  points  to  the  relative \nstrength  of  \u201cpush\u201d  factors.  The  variability  of  capital  flows,  particularly  to  the  ASEAN-5  countries \n(includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), was evident during the GFC \n(Grenville 2012). \n \n\nAdvantages of Greater Capital Mobility \n\nKnowledge  of  the  determinants  of  capital  flows  has  profound  implications  in  terms  of \nappropriate  policy  responses.  In  this  context,  the  overriding  objective  of  economic  managers  is  to \nmaximize the benefits of capital flows and minimize their costs. \n \nB. \n \nGreater  capital  mobility  is  generally  viewed  to  be  advantageous  to  the  process  of  economic \ndevelopment.  Capital  flows  to  emerging  market  economies  have  eased  the  domestic  savings \nconstraint, which in turn has increased investment, thereby boosting economic growth. To the extent \nthat real returns to marginal investment are lower in capital-rich countries than those in capital-scarce \ncountries,  the  movement  of  capital  from  developed  economies  to  emerging  market  economies \nimproves the efficiency of world resource allocation (Devlin, Ffrench-Davis, and Griffith-Jones 1995). \n \n\nInstead of raising the investment rate indirectly by providing more resources, capital flows may \ndo so directly in the form of FDI. This type of inflow usually brings a range of dynamic benefits such as \ntechnology, improved management practices, and greater access to international markets. \n\n \nThe  availability  of  international  capital  also  provides  an  economy  the  ability  to  smooth \nexpenditures,  especially  in  the  advent  of  adverse  exogenous  shocks.  Meanwhile,  an  open  capital \naccount for both developed and emerging market economies allows for greater portfolio diversification \nand better management of risk on the part of investors. This is one of the more common arguments at \nthe  microeconomic  level  for  capital  account  liberalization  (Devlin,  Ffrench-Davis  and  Griffith-Jones, \n1995). \n \nC. \n \nThe AFC and the GFC were painful reminders of the risks associated with more open capital accounts. \nForeign  capital  flows  may  cause  imbalances  that  threaten  macroeconomic  stability.  This  situation \nbecomes  likely  if  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  economy  falls  below  the  level  of  the  capital  inflows. \nSuch  a  disparity  arises  because  of  policy  arbitrage,  where  capital  flows  are  attracted  by  the  sound \nfundamentals  of  an  economy  causing  financial  markets  to  allocate  too  much  or  too  little  capital  to \nsome recipients at a given moment (Guitian 1998). \n \n\nDrawbacks of Greater Capital Mobility \n\nIf an economy has a flexible exchange rate regime, capital inflows will lead to an appreciation of \nthe  nominal  and  real  exchange  rates.  This  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  competitiveness  of \nexports and import-substituting industries, and result in a deterioration of the current account balance. \nThe  resource  allocation  effects  of  a  real  exchange  rate  appreciation  may  also  spawn  asset  price \nbubbles and rapid credit expansion that could jeopardize the stability of the financial system. \n\n \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   5 \n\nIn  a  fixed  exchange  rate  regime,  capital  inflows  lead  to  a  real  exchange  rate  appreciation  via \ninflationary pressure brought about by the increase in money supply and domestic credit. However, a \nfixed  exchange  rate  regime  is  more  vulnerable  when  there  is  a  net  capital  outflow.  Unless  it  has \nadequate  foreign  exchange  reserves,  the  monetary  authority  would  have  to  raise  interest  rates  to \nprotect the peg. The likely outcome would be an economic recession. \n \n\nMany factors could also undermine the efficacy of the capital inflows. The host economy may \nexperience  a  mere  substitution  of  domestic  savings  by  foreign  savings,  which  would  only  facilitate  a \nconsumption  boom.  In  order  to  avoid  this  situation,  a  relatively  high  saving  rate  must  be  attained  in \norder to generate a trade surplus that will be used to service the foreign debt incurred. But even if this \nsaving rate is attained, an insufficient amount of investment may be channeled to the tradable goods \nsector  (most  likely  because  of  the  appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate),  which  would  reduce  the \nconvertibility of the surplus to foreign currency needed to service the foreign debt. Some analysts have \nargued that even if capital inflows are channeled completely to investment, the resulting improvement \nin the growth rate is only short-term in nature unless it is accompanied by a significant improvement in \nthe economy\u2019s technology (Reisen 1998). \n\nimperfections  associated  with  asymmetric \n\n \nSince capital account inflows inherently entail financial transactions, they are also susceptible \nto  market \ninformation  and  moral  hazard.  These \nmicroeconomic distortions normally result in an inappropriate assessment of risk exposure and cause \noverborrowing,  making  the  financial  system  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks.  The  problem  becomes \nparticularly acute when banks are the main intermediaries of capital flows. The situation is even more \nprecarious  in  emerging  markets  where  the  risk  management  practices  of  the  private  sector  are \nunderdeveloped,  the  capacity  of  regulators  to  supervise  the  finance  sector  are  limited,  and  the \nfinancial markets are thin. \n\n \nAnother potential microeconomic distortion arises from the real sector where aspects such as \nimperfect  competition,  externalities  or  wage  rigidity,  may  result  in  inappropriate  private  sector \nadjustment  even  if  the  finance  sector  is  functioning  well  (Fernandez-Arias  and  Montiel  1996).  Such \nstatic  distortions  may  lead  to  the  choice  of  a  wrong  technology  and  access  to  foreign  capital  will \nmagnify  the  problem  (Calvo,  Leiderman,  and  Reinhart  1994).  Meanwhile,  in  the  event  of  a  sudden \ncapital  outflow,  these  distortions  would  induce  exchange  rate  overshooting,  making  the  economic \nadjustment more difficult. \n \n\nThis  discussion  is  based  on  literature  in  the  1990s.  The  review  of  Kawai  and  Takagi  (2010) \npresents  more  or  less  the  same  issues.  They  list  three  types  of  risks  that  can  be  conceptually \nconsidered (Kawai and Takagi 2010, 51): \n \n\nMacroeconomic  risks.  Capital  inflows  could  accelerate  the  growth  of  credit  (or  even  create \nloss  of  monetary  control),  cause  the  real  exchange  rate  to  appreciate,  cause  inflation,  and \naffect  other  macroeconomic  variables  in  a  way  inconsistent  or  incompatible  with  immediate \ndomestic  policy  objectives,  such  as  price  stability,  exchange  rate  stability,  and  export \npromotion. \n \nFinancial stability risk. Capital inflows could push up equity and other asset prices, reduce the \nquality  of  assets,  and  adversely  affect  the  maturity  and  currency  composition  of  the  balance \nsheets  of  the  private  sector  (particularly  banks  and  corporations),  thereby  contributing  to \ngreater financial fragility. \n \n\n \n\n\f6   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nRisk  of  capital  flow  reversal.  Capital  inflows  could  reverse  themselves  suddenly,  with  a \npotential for the depletion of reserves or sharp currency depreciation. \n\nSome Empirical Evidence \n\n \nD. \n \nDespite the theoretical and intuitive arguments in favor of greater capital mobility, some studies have \nquestioned  the  benefits  of  capital  flows  on  empirical  grounds.  In  one  study,  an  indicator  of  capital \naccount liberalization was included as an explanatory variable for economic growth (Rodrik 1998). The \nconclusion  reached  was  that  the  data  provided  no  evidence  that  countries  without  capital  controls \nhave grown faster, invested more, or experienced lower inflation. \n \n\nAnother  study  used  capital  flows  directly  as  an  explanatory  variable  (Levine  and  Carkovic \n1999).  The  authors  applied  more  sophisticated  econometric  techniques  to  account  for  simultaneity, \ncountry-specific  effects  and  the  inclusion  of  lagged  dependent  variables  as  regressors.  The  study \nfound  that  the  exogenous  components  of  FDI  flows  and  portfolio  flows  did  not  exert  a  positive \ninfluence  on  economic  growth.  The  conclusion  is  consistent  with  microeconomic  studies  that \ngenerally  suggest  that  FDI  does  not  boost  economic  growth  primarily  because  of  the  absence  of \nevidence of positive spillovers running from foreign-owned to domestic-owned firms. However, Reisen \nand Soto (2001) examined a panel data of 44 countries over 1986\u20131997 and found that FDI (as well as \nequity)  inflows,  but  not  any  other  type  of  capital  inflows,  are  positively  correlated  with  subsequent \neconomic growth.  \n\n \nThe  study  of  Levine  and  Carkovic  also  looked  at  the  effect  of  capital  flows  on  productivity \ngrowth, which is an important determinant of the variation in long-term growth across economies. This \nanalysis, too, did not show evidence of a link. However, a separate study by Levine (1999) presented \nevidence that the entry of foreign banks\u2014a form of direct investment\u2014enhanced the efficiency of the \ndomestic  financial  system.  Meanwhile,  international  portfolio  equity  flows  were  shown  to  have \nenhanced domestic stock market liquidity. Other studies have confirmed the positive effects of both \nfinancial  system  efficiency  and  stock  market  liquidity  on  productivity  and  economic  growth.  Hence, \nthe study of Levine provided evidence of a transmission mechanism between foreign capital flows, on \nthe one hand, and economic growth, on the other. \n \n\nA  comprehensive  review  by  Obstfeld  (2007)  covers  the  major  empirical  studies  of  the  past \ndecade. He finds that at the macro level, in particular, it is difficult to find unambiguous evidence that \nfinancial  opening  yields  a  net  improvement  in  economic  performance  for  emerging  countries.  This \ndoes not imply, however, that financial liberalization, or specifically capital account liberalization, must \nbe  abandoned.  There  are  plausible  explanations  why  empirical  work  does  not  unambiguously  show \nthat capital account liberalization is beneficial on a net basis. \n \n\n(i) \n\nFirst,  there  may  be  threshold  levels  of  institutional  development  only  above  which  the \nbenefits  exceed  the  costs.  This  could  also  explain  why  the  correlation  between  growth \nand the use of foreign capital is strongly positive for industrial countries but not for low-\nincome  countries.  Other  studies  support  this  notion  of  a  threshold  effect,  whereby  a \ncountry\u2019s  absorptive  capacity  must  exceed  a  certain  amount  in  order  to  exploit  the \nbenefits of capital inflows (Prasad et al. 2003). \n\n(ii)  Second, collateral benefits of  openness to foreign  capital are greater at higher levels of \ndevelopment,  while  the  associated  costs  and  risks  are  greater  at  lower  levels  of \ndevelopment. \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   7 \n\n(iii)  Third, crude quantity-based measures of the use of foreign finance, such as the current \n\naccount deficit or gross inflows, may not capture the influence of foreign capital. \n\n \n\nHence, Obstfeld argues that despite the skimpy direct evidence that developing countries gain \nfrom financial globalization, they should nonetheless proceed in a cautious incremental manner. There \nis strong evidence that domestic financial development spurs growth under the right conditions, and \nthese conditions\u2014plus domestic financial development itself\u2014are likely to make capital inflows from \nabroad more productive. Moreover, in the long-term, an internationally open financial system is likely \nto be more competitive, transparent, and efficient than a closed one. \n\n \nAn  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  capital  flows  can  determine  whether  the \naforementioned drawbacks have materialized. In one study, key economic variables for selected Asian \nand  Latin  American  economies  were  monitored  using  data  from  1988\u20131994  (Calvo,  Leiderman,  and \nReinhart  1996).  Some  stylized  facts  were  documented  from  these  observations.  First,  a  substantial \nportion  of  the  surge  in  capital  inflows  was  channeled  to  accumulation  of  foreign  exchange  reserves. \nSecond, in most countries, the capital inflows were associated with widening current account deficits. \nThird, there was a rise in consumption spending, which was usually driven by rising imports of durable \ngoods. Fourth, in almost all countries examined, there was rapid growth in the money supply both in \nnominal and real terms. Fifth, the surge in portfolio flows was accompanied by sharp increases in stock \nand real estate prices. Lastly, the evidence on the real exchange rate presents a mixed picture. The data \nindicate that real exchange rate appreciation was more prevalent in Latin America than in Asia. \n\nPolicy Issues \n\n \nThe  stylized  facts  suggest  that  the  disadvantages  associated  with  capital  flows,  such  as \nincreased consumption and real exchange rate appreciation, are likely outcomes. Given the potential \nbenefits of capital flows, it is thus imperative for policy makers to adopt measures that minimize their \ncosts.  Strategies  for  capital  flow  management  can  be  developed  at  the  domestic,  regional,  and \ninternational  levels.  Policy  options  that  exist  in  the  domestic  front  can  further  be  classified  into \nmacroeconomic and microeconomic responses. \n \nE. \n \nThe impact of capital flows on the exchange rate is at the heart of the discussion of appropriate policy \nresponses  in  emerging  markets.  If  capital  flows  are  driven  largely  by  fundamentals\u2014such  as  a  higher \nWicksellian  \u2018natural\u2019  interest  rate  or  the  Balassa-Samuelson  effect\u2014authorities  must  accept  the \ninevitability of allowing the real exchange rate to appreciate. In fact, real exchange appreciation is the \nonly sustainable response to a permanent increase in capital inflows and a fundamental revaluation of \ndomestic  relative  to  foreign  assets  (Kawai  and  Takagi  2010).  Policy  makers,  however,  are  generally \nreluctant to allow currencies to appreciate.  \n \n\nThree broad categories of macroeconomic measures are available to countries facing surges of \ncapital  inflows,  if  they  are  not  willing  to  allow  the  nominal  exchange  rate  to  appreciate:  (i)  sterilized \nintervention,  (ii)  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility,  and  (iii)  fiscal  tightening  (preferably  through \nexpenditure cuts). The relevant issues for each option are summarized in Table 1. More details can be \nfound in Kawai and Takagi (2010). \n\n \nFiscal tightening is arguably the most effective response to a surge in capital inflows because it \nleads  to  a  decline  in  the  absorption  of  real  resources  by  the  public  sector  to  offset  the  impact  of \nresource transfers from abroad on the domestic economy. Because the impact is on the real sector of \nthe economy, fiscal tightening should limit inflationary pressure and prevent a real appreciation of the \n\n \n\n\f8   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\ncurrency.  Moreover,  since  it  can  reduce  pressure  on  interest  rates,  it  directly  lowers  the  gains  to \ninterest rate-induced capital inflows. Provided that government consumption is more intensive in the \nuse  of  nontradable  goods,  fiscal  tightening  would  cause  domestic  demand  to  shift  from  nontradable \ngoods to tradable goods, and domestic production to shift from nontradable goods to tradable goods. \n \n\nHowever, fiscal tightening has limitations as a policy tool to deal with capital inflows: \n\n\u201cFirst,  fiscal  policy  lacks  flexibility  because  it  often  requires  parliamentary  action. \nSecond,  there  is  a  limit  to  how  much  fiscal  policy  can  be  tightened,  especially  in  a \ndemocratic society and if there is little fiscal space to begin with. Third, fiscal tightening \nmay  have  the  perverse  effect  of  attracting  capital  flows  by  providing  a  signal  that \nauthorities  are  pursuing  a  sound,  disciplined  macroeconomic  policy.  It  should  be \ncountered, however, that such a positive signaling effect is likely transitory; over time, \nsustainable fiscal policy should help attract only the most stable and committed types \nof capital.\u201d1 \n\n \n\n \n\nBecause the policy responses presented in Table 1 have their respective drawbacks, the issue \nof  capital  controls  has  remained  relevant.  Moreover,  the  experience  with  the  AFC  and  other  similar \ncrises  has  shifted  the  policy  debate.  Whereas,  free  flows  previously  dominated  the  analytical  and \nintellectual debate, the current thinking has moved toward policy intervention. It has been observed \nthat  past  aversion  to  capital  controls  has  seemingly  been  replaced  with  a  new  appreciation  of  its \ncontribution to economic policy as a tool for financial stability.2 \n\n \nHowever,  the  current  positions  \u201cseem  to  be  transitional  rather  than  conceptually  well \nfounded\u201d (Grenville 2012). The best example of this is the position of the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) which is illustrated in Figure 1. There is acceptance that temporary management of capital flows \nmay be necessary but only after all other possible measures have been exhausted. However, this new \nframework  has  been  described  as  complicated,  intentionally  vague,  and  difficult  to  implement  given \nthe absence of explicit guidelines (Gochoco-Bautista and Rhee 2013). \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Schadler (2010) as cited by Kawai and Takagi (2010), 61. \n2   Gochoco-Bautista and Rhee (2013), 1, citing Gallagher, Griffith-Jones, and Ocampo, eds.

The presentation will largely follow the discussion of Kawai and Lamberte (2010). \nThe data will show whether the possible drawbacks from greater capital mobility have materialized in \nASEAN+3. \n \n\nDegree of Capital Account Openness \n\nA. \n \nCapital  account  openness  has  been  measured  empirically  both  in  de  jure  (based  on  laws  and \nregulations) and de facto terms. De jure openness can be more important for financial integration. One \npopular measure of de jure openness is the Chinn-Ito Index which is an index compiled based on the \nIMF\u2019s annual report on exchange rate arrangements and regulations. The index values range between \n2.5 (fully open) and \u20131.8 (fully closed).  \n \n\nThe degree of capital account openness varies a great deal in ASEAN+3 (Figure 2). The trend \nin Southeast Asia has been toward greater restrictiveness. The Philippines and Indonesia had positive \nvalues of the index prior to 2012. Malaysia\u2019s index turned negative after the AFC. Meanwhile, the index \nfor Thailand has become progressively more negative over time. Among the economies of ASEAN+3, \nonly  the  capital  account  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  has  become  more  open.  The  others  either \nmaintained  the  same  level  of  openness  (Hong  Kong,  China  and  Singapore)  or  the  same  level  of \nrestrictiveness (e.g., the PRC and India). \n \n\nFigure 2: Degree of Openness of Capital Account, Selected Asian \nEconomies \n \n\nPRC\n\nKorea, Republic of\n\nThailand\n\nPhilippines\n\nMalaysia\n\nJapan\n\nSingapore\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nIndonesia\n\n\u20131.5\n\n\u20131.0\n\n\u20130.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2007\n\n2012\n\n \n\n \n \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using Chinn and Ito 2008. \n\n \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   13 \n\nOne indicator of de facto openness is the ratio of the sum of stock of assets and liabilities to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP).

This led \nRadelet and Sachs (1999) to argue that the essence of the AFC was a huge, sudden reversal of capital \nflows, which is more prominently described as a \u201csudden stop.\u201d Net capital flows in the five hardest hit \neconomies\u2014Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand\u2014surged  from \n$37.9 billion in 1994 to $97.1 billion in 1996. But in the last half of 1997, these flows suddenly reversed \ndirection, with net private capital outflows totaling $11.9 billion. Krugman (1999) succinctly states that \nthe punishment was surely disproportionate to the crime. \n \n\nNet capital flows surged again in 2003\u20132007. This was largely because the first 8 years of the \n21st  century  have  been  extraordinarily  benign  in  terms  of  macrofinancial  stability.  In  fact,  the  period \nwas often considered a new episode in economic policy making, with the world economy entering into \na  \u201cgreat  moderation,\u201d  in  which  better  macroeconomic  management  made  crises  a  thing  of  the  past. \nHowever, there was a sudden stop again in 2008\u20132009 in the wake of the GFC. \n\n \nThe level of net capital inflows to ASEAN+3 reached new highs in 2010\u20132013. The situation was \ncompounded by the massive QE by the Federal Reserve System (Fed) of the US. Between November \n2008  and  January  2013,  the  Fed  engineered  four  QE  episodes  that  resulted  in  an  expansion  of \napproximately  $2.4  trillion  in  base  money.  At  the  same  time,  the  yen  appreciated  from  \u00a5104.3  per  US \ndollar in September 2008 to a peak of \u00a576.36 per US dollar in January 2012, in line with its role as one of \nthe three major global currencies. Other Asian currencies also experienced substantial appreciations. \n\n \n\n\f14   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\n \nThe Bank of Japan countered with a planned QE of $1.4 trillion over a period of 2 years beginning \nin  April  2013.  The  ambitious  scale  of  the  operation  can  be  gleaned  from  the  relative  size  of  Japan\u2019s \neconomy which is three times smaller than that of the US. Moreover, the time frame of 2 years is half that \nof  the  US  program.  In  anticipation  of  this  action  from  the  Bank  of  Japan,  the  yen  began  depreciating \nbeginning  late  2012  and  is  currently  at  \u00a5106.27  per  US  dollar.  Most  Asian  currencies  also  depreciated \nduring this period. The QE of Japan injected additional liquidity into the system and net capital inflows \nsurpassed $1 trillion, equivalent to 5.3% of the GDP of 11 ASEAN+3 economies (Table 3). \n \n\nTable 3: Magnitude of Capital Flows, ASEAN+3 \n\nItems \n\nCapital inflows \n\n% of GDP \n\nCapital outflows \n\n% of GDP \n\nNet inflows \n\n% of GDP \n\n1990 \n\n91.9 \n\n2.3 \n\n97.4 \n\n2.4 \n\n\u20135.5 \n\n\u20130.1 \n\n1991 \n\n60.2 \n\n1.3 \n\n91.2 \n\n2.0 \n\n\u201331.0 \n\n\u20130.7 \n\n1992 \n\n\u201350.9 \n\n\u20131.0 \n\n23.8 \n\n0.5 \n\n1993 \n\n39.7 \n\n0.7 \n\n99.0 \n\n1.8 \n\n1994 \n\n157.1 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.0 \n\n\u201374.7 \n\n\u201359.4 \n\n\u201329.8 \n\n\u20131.5 \n\n\u20131.1 \n\n\u20130.5 \n\n1995 \n\n291.5 \n\n4.1 \n\n3.7 \n\n26.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n187.0 \n\n265.2 \n\n1996 \n\n151.5 \n\n2.2 \n\n81.8 \n\n1.2 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n180.3 \n\n\u2013120.8 \n\n\u2013132.8 \n\n2.8 \n\n304.1 \n\n4.8 \n\n\u20132.1 \n\n51.3 \n\n0.9 \n\n\u20132.1 \n\n\u201386.8 \n\n\u20131.3 \n\n24.9 \n\n0.4 \n\n111.0 \n\n1.6 \n\n69.7 \n\n\u2013123.8 \n\n\u2013172.1 \n\n\u201346.0 \n\n\u201386.2 \n\n1.0 \n\n\u20131.9 \n\n\u20133.0 \n\n\u20130.7 \n\n\u20131.2 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3   continued \n\nItems \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\nCapital inflows \n\n% of GDP \n\nCapital outflows \n\n% of GDP \n\nNet inflows \n\n% of GDP \n\n3.3 \n\n0.1 \n\n32.2 \n\n0.5 \n\n14.3 \n\n0.2 \n\n51.5 \n\n0.8 \n\n\u201328.9 \n\n\u20130.4 \n\n\u201337.3 \n\n\u20130.6 \n\n2.4 \n\n59.1 \n\n0.8 \n\n171.9 \n\n393.7 \n\n301.7 \n\n347.2 \n\n724.1 \n\n\u2013170.1 \n\n\u2013238.9 \n\n4.9 \n\n3.6 \n\n3.9 \n\n7.3 \n\n261.5 \n\n346.2 \n\n402.0 \n\n845.4 \n\n\u2013305.2 \n\n410.7 \n\n352.5 \n\n653.8 \n\n588.6 \n\n3.3 \n\n4.1 \n\n4.5 \n\n8.5 \n\n2.9 \n\n2.2 \n\n3.8 \n\n3.4 \n\n112.8 \n\n132.2 \n\n\u201344.5 \n\n\u201354.8 \n\n\u2013121.3 \n\n\u2013191.2 \n\n139.4 \n\n233.6 \n\n\u2013154.5 \n\n300.5 \n\n1.6 \n\n1.7 \n\n\u20130.5 \n\n\u20130.6 \n\n\u20131.2 \n\n\u20131.7 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.4 \n\n\u20130.9 \n\n1.7 \n\n\u20131.5 \n\n21.1 \n\n0.2 \n\n\u20132.0 \n\n\u20132.5 \n\n66.2 \n\n0.5 \n\n2010 \n\n550.1 \n\n3.9 \n\n2011 \n\n586.1 \n\n3.6 \n\n2012 \n\n499.3 \n\n2.9 \n\n2013 \n\n889.1 \n\n5.1 \n\nASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea; GDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes: BPM6 data from 2005 onwards, BPM5 data prior to 2005.

By the late 1990s up to the present, there \nwere many years when FDI accounted for more than half of net inflows. \n \n\nMeanwhile,  portfolio  equity  inflows  increased  after  the  AFC.  There  was  a  sharp  increase  in \n1999  after  most  Asian  economies  reduced  barriers  to  investment  on  equity  markets  to  recapitalize \nailing banks and nonfinancial corporations (Kawai and Lamberte 2010). There was a brief lull between \n2000\u20132002 due to the bursting of the information technology bubble and the subsequent recession \nin  the  US.  Equity  inflows  then  contributed  significantly  to  the  surge  of  net  capital  inflows  during  the \nperiod 2003\u20132007.  \n\n \nDebt  securities  inflows  have  been  a  relatively  small  component  of  net  capital  inflows  to \n11 ASEAN+3  economies.  One  of  the  causes  of  the  AFC  was  the  so-called  double  mismatch\u2014\na currency mismatch and maturity mismatch\u2014in bank balance sheets. A local bond market would be \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   15 \n\nthe  natural  environment  to  develop  long-term,  local  currency  denominated  debt  instruments  that \nwould provide a more stable and reliable financing framework. This will be discussed in greater detail in \nsection  V.  The  inflow  of  debt  securities  increased  substantially  in  2006\u20132007,  particularly  in  the \nRepublic of Korea and Malaysia, but the momentum was halted by the GFC. \n\n \nQuite  interestingly,  both  the  AFC  and  the  GFC  are  characterized  by  large  negative  flows  of \n\u201cother investment.\u201d3 This type of flows or investments can readily be withdrawn by nonresidents. Apart \nfrom  the  smaller  scale  of  the  reversal  in  net  inflows  during  the  GFC,  one  reason  why  the  economic \nimpact  was  less  compared  with  the  AFC  was  the  continued  influx  of  FDI.  The  latter  has  been  at  a \nrelatively stable level from 2005\u20132013. \n\nFigure 3: Financial Inflows, ASEAN+3 \n(% of GDP) \n\n \n\n \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20138\n\n0\n9\n9\n1\n\n1\n9\n9\n1\n\n2\n9\n9\n1\n\n3\n9\n9\n1\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\nFDI\n\nPI: Equity\n\nPI: Debt OI (inc derivatives)\n\n \nASEAN+3 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the \nRepublic  of  Korea;  FDI  =  foreign  direct  investment;  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product;  PI  =  portfolio \ninvestment; OI = other investment. \nNotes: Used BPM6 data from 2005 onwards, BPM-5 data prior to 2005.

For gross outflows, \u201cflight\u201d and \u201cretrenchment\u201d \nare used when outflows indicate a sharp increase and decrease, respectively. It is also useful to break \ndown  the  flows  into  three  types:  (i)  \u201cequities\u201d\u2014consisting  of  direct  investment  and  equity  portfolio, \n(ii) \u201cdebt\u201d\u2014comprising of debt securities and others including derivatives, and (iii) \u201cbank\u201d flows.

More so, \nthe  volatility  of  bank-led  flows  occurred  most  frequently.  This  capital  flow  wave  pattern  poses  more \ndifficult  challenges  to  policy  makers  in  terms  of  dealing  with  capital  flow  surge,  stop,  flight,  and \nretrenchment, and maintain financial and macro stability.   \n \n\nThe episodes for each type of capital flow are enumerated below.  \n\nFDI inflows stand out as a very robust type of flow.  \n\n(i) \n(ii)  Equity flows are very volatile. In terms of period, it seems that equities have contributed \nto the most number of stop episodes during the dot-com bubble (Q4 2000), the GFC \n(Q4 2006\u2013Q1 2007, Q1\u2013Q3 2008), and post-GFC (Q3\u2013Q4 2011).  \n\n(iii)  Debt-led inflows have shown persistent flight during post-GFC (Q4 2009\u2013Q2 2010). \n(iv)  Banking flows have contributed to several surge, stop, flight and retrenchment episodes \n\nfrom 1996\u20132013. \n\nFigure 4: Surge\u2013Stop Episodes in Capital Inflows, Selected Asian Economies \n \n\nFDI\n\nPortfolio equity securities\n\nQ4\n1996\n\nQ2\n1999\n\nQ4\n2001\n\nQ2\n2004\nSurge\n\nQ4\n2006\nStop\n\nQ2\n2009\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ4\n1996\n\nQ2\n1999\n\nQ4\n2001\n\nQ2\n2004\nSurge\n\nQ4\n2006\nStop\n\nQ2\n2009\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nDebt\n\nBank transactions\n\nQ4\n1996\n\nQ2\n1999\n\nQ4\n2001\n\nQ2\n2004\nSurge\n\nQ4\n2006\nStop\n\nQ2\n2009\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ4\n1996\n\nQ2\n1999\n\nQ4\n2001\n\nQ2\n2004\nSurge\n\nQ4\n2006\nStop\n\nQ2\n2009\n\nQ1\n2013\n\n \n\nFDI = foreign direct investment. \nNotes: Includes Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) of selected economies of ASEAN+3 tended to appreciate \nespecially  after  2004,  with  the  notable  exception  of  Hong  Kong,  China  and  Taipei,China.  The \ncombined  effect  of  persistent  current  account  surpluses,  rising  capital  inflows,  and  accumulation  of \nforeign exchange reserves with persistent US deficits were the primary factors behind the appreciation \nof the REER (Kawai and Lamberte 2010). \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nFigure 6a: Real Effective Exchange Rates, Selected Asian Economies \n(2010 = 100) \n\nJun 1997: \nAFC\n\nMar 2000:\nDot-com\nbubble burst \n\nNov 2008: \nUS Fed QE1\n\nNov 2010: \nUS Fed QE2\n\nApr 2013: \nBOJ's QQE\n\nMay 2010: \nEU crisis\n\nSep 2012: \nUS Fed QE3\n\nMay 2013: \nQE Taper \nannounced\nDec 2013: \nQE Taper \nbegins\n\nSep 2008: \nGFC\n\n \n\nSep-96\n\nJun-99 Mar-02 Dec-04\n\nSep-07\n\nJun-10\n\nAug-14\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\n \nAFC = Asian financial crisis, BOJ = Bank of Japan, EU = European Union, GFC = global financial crisis, \nQE = quantitative easing, QQE = quantitative and qualitative easing, US Fed = United States Federal \nReserve System. \nNote: Data refer to real (CPI-based), broad indices. \nSource: Bank for International Settlements. \n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nFigure 6b: Real Effective Exchange Rates, +3 Economies and  \nHong Kong, China (2010 = 100) \n\nJun 1997: \nAFC\n\nMar 2000: \nDot-com \nbubble burst\n\nNov 2008: \nUS Fed QE1\n\nNov 2010: \nUS Fed QE2\n\nMay 2010: \nEU crisis\n\nSep 2008: \nGFC\n\nApr 2013: \nBOJ's QQE\n\nSep 2012: \nUS Fed QE3\n\nMay 2013: \nQE Taper \nannounced\nDec 2013: \nQE Taper \nbegins\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nJan-94\n\n \n\n \n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nJan-94\n\nSep-96\n\nJun-99 Mar-02 Dec-04\n\nSep-07\n\nJun-10\n\nAug-14\n\nPRC\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nJapan\n\nKorea, Republic of\n\n \n\nAFC = Asian financial crisis, BOJ = Bank of Japan, EU = European Union, GFC = global financial crisis, \nPRC = People's Republic of China, QE = quantitative easing, QQE = quantitative and qualitative \neasing, US Fed = United States Federal Reserve System. \nNotes: Data refer to real (CPI-based), broad indices.

The REER then began to appreciate for most of the economies \nin response to the QE. This experience underlies the volatility of capital flows. Meanwhile, Thorbecke \n(2012) reports that the Japanese REER appreciated by 30% between June 2007 and March 2009. At \nthe  same  time,  Japanese  real  exports  fell  40%,  industrial  production  dropped  35%,  and  the  Nikkei \nindex  lost  more  than  80%  of  its  value.  Thorbecke  (2012),  as  summarized  in  Thorbecke  (2013), \npresents  empirical  evidence  showing  that  the  appreciation  of  the  yen  caused  exports  to  fall \nsignificantly, especially for the automobile sector. \n\n \nOne of the more significant changes since the AFC has been the accumulation of huge foreign \nexchange  reserves  by  selected  economies  in  ASEAN+3  (Table  4).  For  example,  the  PRC\u2019s  reserves \nexceeded  $3  trillion  in  2011,  equivalent  to  43.7%  of  its  GDP.  As  discussed  earlier,  foreign  reserve \naccumulation  is  one  measure  to  stem  the  appreciation  of  an  economy\u2019s  currency.  Some  economies \nalso heightened their reserve accumulation to protect themselves from sudden stops in capital inflows. \nThe  large  holdings  of  international  reserves  could  be  considered  excessive  for  some  of  these \neconomies  (Gagnon  2014).  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  preparing  a  policy  note  on  the \nestablishment  of  a  new  investment  tool/vehicle  to  further  support  the  development  of  the  local \ncurrency bond markets in the region with the use of foreign exchange reserves. The investment tool is \ndesigned  to  leverage  investment  from  global  institutional  investors  to  help  broaden  investor  base, \nimprove market liquidity, and reduce the risk associated with the sudden reversal of capital flows in the \nASEAN+3 region. \n \n\nTable 4: Foreign Exchange Reserves Net of Gold, Selected Asian Economies  \n \n\nLevel, $ billion \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2005 \n\n821.5 \n\n124.2 \n\n33.1 \n\n834.3 \n\n210.3 \n\n69.9 \n\n15.9 \n\n116.0 \n\n50.7 \n\n36.4 \n\n68.4 \n\n11.6 \n\n18.2 \n\n23.4 \n\n48.7 \n\n15.5 \n\n91.0 \n\n28.7 \n\n2,866.1 \n\n3,202.8 \n\n3,331.1 \n\n3,839.5 \n\n1,061.5 \n\n1,258.2 \n\n1,227.1 \n\n1,237.2 \n\n268.6 \n\n92.9 \n\n291.5 \n\n104.9 \n\n55.4 \n\n225.5 \n\n167.5 \n\n2010 \n\n48.3 \n\n117.5 \n\n13.1 \n\n19.3 \n\n26.6 \n\n42.4 \n\n27.7 \n\n95.4 \n\n52.5 \n\n285.3 \n\n106.5 \n\n304.3 \n\n131.8 \n\n67.3 \n\n237.5 \n\n167.4 \n\n2011 \n\n43.7 \n\n114.8 \n\n12.6 \n\n21.3 \n\n25.3 \n\n45.6 \n\n30.0 \n\n86.7 \n\n48.4 \n\n317.3 \n\n108.8 \n\n323.2 \n\n137.8 \n\n73.5 \n\n259.1 \n\n173.3 \n\n2012 \n\n40.5 \n\n120.8 \n\n12.4 \n\n20.7 \n\n26.4 \n\n45.2 \n\n29.4 \n\n90.3 \n\n47.4 \n\n311.1 \n\n96.4 \n\n341.6 \n\n133.4 \n\n75.7 \n\n272.9 \n\n161.3 \n\n2013 \n\n41.6 \n\n113.5 \n\n11.1 \n\n25.2 \n\n26.2 \n\n42.7 \n\n27.8 \n\n91.6 \n\n41.7 \n\nProportion of GDP, % \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2005 \n\nPRC \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nKorea, Republic of \n\nIndonesia \n\nJapan \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nThailand \n\nPRC \n\nHong Kong, China \n\nKorea, Republic of \n\nIndonesia \n\nJapan \n\nMalaysia \n\nPhilippines \n\nSingapore \n\nThailand \n\n \n\n29.6 \n\n24.6 \n\n7.5 \n\n78.5 \n\n14.8 \n\n9.8 \n\n0.9 \n\n27.8 \n\n13.3 \n\n8.3 \n\n31.9 \n\n6.5 \n\n2.5 \n\n5.2 \n\n22.2 \n\n2.1 \n\n71.4 \n\n15.6 \n\n75.4 \n\n55.4 \n\n13.7 \n\n183.2 \n\n32.7 \n\n23.8 \n\n6.4 \n\n68.8 \n\n36.0 \n\n10.4 \n\n38.3 \n\n6.8 \n\n3.4 \n\n5.8 \n\n26.8 \n\n8.6 \n\n78.3 \n\n21.4 \n\n168.3 \n\n107.5 \n\n28.5 \n\n354.9 \n\n96.1 \n\n28.3 \n\n13.1 \n\n80.0 \n\n32.0 \n\n14.0 \n\n62.6 \n\n17.3 \n\n7.5 \n\n17.1 \n\n30.2 \n\n16.2 \n\n83.4 \n\n26.1 \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product; PRC = People's Republic of China. \nSource: Authors' calculations using data from the IMF, International Financial Statistics; the World Bank, World Development Indicators;  \nand CEIC (accessed 9 October 2014). \n\n\f20   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nThe  growth  of  money  supply  was  fairly  stable  for  selected  economies  of  ASEAN+3  after  the \nAFC (Table 5).

For  the  period,  2009\u20132013,  inflation  in  most  economies  of  ASEAN+3  has  been  relatively  low. \nIndia\u2019s relatively high inflation during this period is largely due to the high cost of food owing to supply \nbottlenecks and the rise in rural incomes. Meanwhile, Indonesia had a bout with relatively high inflation \nfrom 2000 to 2008. Part of this was due to the reduction in fuel subsidies. Many economies also saw a \nsurge in inflation in 2008\u2014the reason for the increase in the average inflation for the period 2005\u2013\n2008\u2014because of the increases in the prices of oil, food, and other commodities in the global market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   21 \n\nTable 6: Inflation, Selected Asian Economies  \n(%) \n \n\n  \n\n  \nPRC \nHong Kong, China \nIndonesia \nJapan \nKorea, Republic of \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nSingapore \nThailand \n\nAnnual Average \n\n1991\u201394 \n\n1995\u201399  2000\u201304  2005\u201308 \n\n2009  2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n12.2 \n9.6 \n8.8 \n1.7 \n6.7 \n4.1 \n10.6 \n2.8 \n4.6 \n\n5.2 \n4.0 \n20.5 \n0.4 \n4.4 \n3.5 \n7.0 \n1.0 \n5.1 \n\n1.1 \n\u20132.3 \n8.0 \n\u20130.5 \n3.2 \n1.5 \n3.8 \n0.8 \n1.7 \n\n3.5 \n2.3 \n9.9 \n0.3 \n3.1 \n3.5 \n5.8 \n2.5 \n4.2 \n\n\u20130.7 \n0.6 \n4.8 \n\u20131.3 \n2.8 \n0.6 \n4.2 \n0.6 \n\u20130.8 \n\n3.3 \n2.3 \n5.1 \n\u20130.7 \n3.0 \n1.7 \n3.8 \n2.8 \n3.3 \n\n5.4 \n5.3 \n5.4 \n\u20130.3 \n4.0 \n3.2 \n4.6 \n5.3 \n3.8 \n\n2.7 \n4.1 \n4.3 \n0.0 \n2.2 \n1.7 \n3.2 \n4.5 \n3.0 \n\n2.6 \n4.4 \n6.4 \n0.4 \n1.3 \n2.1 \n3.0 \n2.4 \n2.2 \n\nPRC = People's Republic of China. \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using data from the World Bank, World Development Indicators (accessed 3 October 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\nApart  from  the  REER,  the  greatest  impact  of  capital  flows  seems  to  be  on  equity  prices \n(Figure 7). Between 2003 and 2007, Indonesia, India, and the PRC experienced relatively large price \nhikes in equity markets. Other economies also recorded increases in stock prices. The GFC disrupted \nthe upward trend because of the global liquidity crunch and increased risks in global equity markets. \nThe QE strategy of the US, however, brought about a resurgence in equity prices. Indonesia and India \nremained in the forefront. The equity market in the PRC, however, lost steam owing to concerns about \nfuture economic growth, tighter money supply, and the cooling down of the property market. Thailand \nand  the  Philippines  are  the  two  other  economies  with  strong  growth  in  equity  prices  after  the  GFC. \nSharply  rising  equity  prices  likely  indicate  positive  asset  bubbles  when  market  prices  exceed  the \nfundamental value. Since stocks in most of these economies are few, capital inflows lead to a surge in \ndemand, which in turn raises equity prices to levels not supported by fundamentals. Property prices are \nsubject  to  the  same  risk.  The  danger  lies  in  an  abrupt  swing  in  the  mispricing  of  risk:  from  a  large \nunderpricing of risk to a significant overpricing of risk which happened in both the AFC and the GFC. In \nboth cases, a large negative asset price bubble spilled over to Asia (Filardo 2011). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nFigure 7: Stock Price Indexes, Selected Asian Economies \n(3 Jan 2000 = 100) \n\n \n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nJan-00\n\nSep-03\n\nMay-07\n\nJan-11\n\nSep-14\n\nPRC\n\nJapan\n\nPhilippines\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nKorea, Republic of\n\nSingapore\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\n \n\n \nNote: Time series is from 3 January 2000 to 30 September 2014.  \nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations using data from Bloomberg (accessed 8 October 2014).  \n\n \n \n\nV. \n\nCAPITAL FLOWS: RECENT TRENDS IN ASEAN+3 \n\n \nSince May 2013, the tightening of interest rates in the US, what is popularly known as US QE Tapering, \nhas ushered in a period of capital flow reversal which had significant implications for key economies in \nASEAN+3.  This  brief  discussion  will  characterize  the  nature  of  liquidity  and  capital  flows  to  the \nASEAN+3 economies.

Then,  the \nannouncement of a possible US QE tapering spawned market turmoil that saw equity markets tumble, \nexchange  rates  depreciate,  and  bond  yields  rise  (Figure  8).  However,  these  erratic  market  behaviors \nbecame more orderly as the US started to unwind their QE with clearer forward guidance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   23 \n\nFigure 8.

The results show the \nsignificant role played by expected increases in the US Fed interest rate, which led to (i) a decrease in \nforeign  capital  inflows  to  be  invested  in  emerging  market  equities;  (ii)  a  depreciation  of  Asian \ncurrencies; and (iii) a rise in domestic bond yields (Table 7).  \n\nTable 7: Drivers of Capital Flows, Panel Data Regression Using Five Asian Economies \n\nDependent Variables \n\nPCERt \n\nPCNEERt \n\nPCS&Pt \n\nCBondYt \n\n\u20130.34*** \n\n\u20131.58*** \n\n\u20136.40*** \n\n\u20132.06 \n\n0.02 \n\n0.06 \n\n0.39 \n\n0.37 \n\n0.34 \n\n\u20130.38*** \n\n0.30 \n\n*** \n\n0.37*** \n\n\u20130.76** \n\n\u20130.10* \n\n\u20132.87* \n\n\u20130.07 \n\n\u20131.19 \n\n\u20133.95*** \n\n\u201325.23*** \n\n\u201322.71*** \n\n\u20134.09*** \n\n\u201316.33*** \n\n0.03 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.24 \n\n0.24 \n\n\u20130.36* \n\n0.27 \n\n*** \n\n  \n\n0.06 \n\n0.52 \n\n0.74 \n\n1.63 \n\n1.44 \n\n\u20131.04 \n\n0.19 \n\n*** \n\n0.08* \n\n0.5 \n\n0.72 \n\n1.58 \n\n1.40 \n\n\u20130.98 \n\n0.21 \n\n*** \n\n0.01 \n\n0.38*** \n\n0.32** \n\n  \n\n0.00 \n\n\u20130.05 \n\n\u20130.02 \n\n\u20130.08 \n\n\u20130.25 \n\n0.06 \n\n0.09 \n\n*** \n\n***significant at 1%, **significant at 5%, *significant at 10%. \nNotes: \n1.

This was aggravated by statements of then US Fed \nChairman  Bernanke  that  tapering  might  start  reducing  new  asset  purchases  by  $20  billion  in \nSeptember 2013; end the QE completely by mid-2014; and raise interest rates afterward.  \n\n \nIn  the  regressions,  recent  financial  volatility  can  be  explained  by  the  interplay  of  the \nexpectation on the US Fed policy rate (as reflected in the US Federal Funds Futures (FFF) contract) \nand global risk variables. Both the FFF expectations and global risks declined from the second half of \n2012 to April 2013\u2014a period when portfolio inflows to emerging markets also became strong and, in \nmany cases, contributed to currency appreciation. From the end of May to mid-September 2013, the \nFFF rose significantly from a downward trend (due to the QE), while global risks remained stable or did \nnot  decline.  Note  that  the  FFF  declined  in  September  with  the  tapering  postponement  to \napproximately where it was before the jitters began. The evidence of market overreaction to US Fed \ntapering  jitters  in  May  to  September  2013  can  therefore  be  seen  in  (i)  the  steeper  negative  slope \ncoefficient for the FFF variable revealed by the regressions on the nominal effective exchange rate and \nthe  price  index  of  stocks  open  to  foreign  investors  and  (ii)  the  temporary  spike  in  the  FFF  variable \nduring the period.  \n\n \n\n\f26   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\nThe  model  predicts  that  an  improving  global  economy\u2014especially  if  it  is  quite  strong  and \npermanent\u2014will  most  likely  prevent  a  repeat  of  the  panic  during  the  first  tapering  fear  period  from \n23 May 2013 to 18 September 2013, as most economies will benefit with the increase in world trade \nand  the  strengthening  of  global  financial  markets.  This  is  especially  true  since  the  risk  perception \nvariable  exerts  a  stronger  (with  higher  significance  level)  effect  on  the  equity  and  exchange  rate \nvariables. \n\n \nOn the other hand, it appears that there was herd mentality driving capital inflows (due to the \nQE itself) and outflows (tapering fears). Strong capital outflows, significant currency depreciation, and \nincreases  in  bond  yields  hit  economies  with  strong  macro  fundamentals,  such  as  Malaysia,  the \nPhilippines,  and  Thailand,  during  the  tapering  fears  from  May  to  September  2013  (Figure  8). \nEconomies  with  weaker  macroeconomic  fundamentals\u2014such  as  India  and  Indonesia\u2014barely  coped \nwith  the  outflows  during  the  same  period.  They  suffered  temporary  mini  crises  with  unusually  sharp \ncurrency  depreciation,  alarmingly  strong  increases  in  bond  yields,  huge  capital  outflows,  and  reserve \nlosses.  Jacking  up  interest  rates  and  imposing  capital  controls  proved  ineffective.  These  economies \nwere saved when the tapering was postponed. When the tapering was announced in December, there \nwas some brief market turbulence; but that ended a week after the late January 2014 announcement \nwas made.  \n \n\nThe announcement on 19 March 2014 changed the rules again as the new US Fed Chair Janet \nYellen dropped the 6.5% unemployment threshold, hinted  an end to the QE by the fall of 2014, and \nhinted a sooner-than-expected increase in interest rates 6 months later\u2014in the spring of 2015 instead \nof June 2015 as markets expected. Thus, market volatility occurred right after the announcement. But \nthe  fears  seemed  to  have  died  down  in  succeeding  days  even  amid  the  Ukraine\u2013Russian  Federation \ngeopolitical crisis and the fear of a major slowdown in the PRC.  \n \n\nQE  tapering  is  inevitable  once  the  US  and  other  major  economies  recover  sufficiently. \nEmerging markets must readjust after the exaggerated inflows and currency appreciation that came as \na  result  of  the  QE.  It  is  clear  that  a  strong  recovery  in  advanced  economies  will  be  good  for  Asia\u2019s \nexport-oriented economies, and Japan\u2019s continuing QE may help tame any rise in global interest rates.  \n \n\nHowever,  financial  markets  remain  highly  sensitive  to  any  news  of  future  interest  rate \nincreases.  Any  hint  that  this  would  happen  will  again  bring  exaggerated  fears  and  rumblings  in  the \nmarkets, with possible irrational panic and herd mentality. Thus, regional cooperation initiatives must \nbe ready, in case market overreaction reappears as Fed tapering brings the QE to an end and leads to a \nrise  in  global  interest  rates.  At  the  height  of  the  US  Fed  tapering  fears,  cooperation  in  the  region \nincreased at least bilaterally. The PRC, at the peak of tapering fears in early September 2013, called on \nAsian  economies  to  create  more  currency  swap  deals  to  facilitate  capital  flows.  At  around  the  same \ntime,  India  and  Japan  decided  to  increase  their  currency  swap  arrangement  from  $15  billion  to \n$50 billion.  More  coherent  and  multilateral  regional  cooperation  and  initiatives  will  enhance  the \nprotection  of  economies  vulnerable  to  global  external  shocks  and  sharp  capital  outflows.  Equally \nimportant,  economies  with  weaker  macroeconomic  fundamentals  must  commit  to  implement  clear \nand meaningful structural reforms, as soon as possible, to offset any market overreaction.  \n \n\nThe market turmoil associated with last year\u2019s US Fed tapering episode flashed warning signals \nto  economies  with  weak  macroeconomic  fundamentals\u2014like  large  current  account  or  fiscal  deficits, \nunsustainable  debt,  and  high  inflation.  India  and  Indonesia  took  the  necessary  initial  steps  toward \nstructural reform after being hit hard by the first tapering fears. This also explains why they were less \naffected when tapering was actually announced in December 2013 and January 2014. \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   27 \n\nEconometric  estimation  suggests  that  the  US  QE  taper  variable  triggers  capital  outflow  from \nthe region, although this is partly offset by improvement in global risk conditions. Had the global risk \nconditions  been  moving  in  the  negative  territory,  the  region  would  have  experienced  greater  capital \noutflow. More importantly, it seems that a market overreaction was evident. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Global and Regional Spillover and Contagion Effects \n\nAzis,  Mitra,  and  Baluga  (2013)  analyzed  the  nature  of  global  and  regional  spillover  and  contagion \neffects using bivariate Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. \nTheir  results  show  that  while  Asian  government  bond  returns  and  volatilities  are  influenced  by \ndynamics  of  their  own  markets,  contagion  effects  from  the  Lehman  and  eurozone  crises  were  also \nsignificant  in  some  countries    (Tables  8  and  9;  Appendix  3  for  the  methodology).  In  particular,  the \nshock spillovers in 2008\u20132009 following the Lehman collapse affected six Asian markets\u2014the PRC, \nThailand,  Malaysia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  India,  and  the  Philippines,  whereas  spillovers  from  the \neurozone  crisis  in  2011  affected  four  markets\u2014the  PRC,  Thailand,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and \nIndonesia. The strongest shock spillovers during the eurozone crisis were in the PRC. In fact, the shock \nspillover  coefficients  throughout  emerging  Asia  were  generally  higher  during  the  2008\u20132009  GFC \nthan during the 2011 eurozone crisis, except for the PRC. \n

Similarly, there were shock spillovers from high-yielding EU corporate bond \nmarkets into local bond markets in the PRC and Thailand, and from the EU composite bond index into \nthe  PRC.  In  terms  of  volatility  spillovers,  perturbations  in  high-yield  US  corporate  bond  markets \nsignificantly  affected  local  bond  markets  in  the  PRC  in  the  2008\u20132009  crisis;  whereas  during  the \neurozone crisis, volatile EU corporate (financial) bonds significantly affected markets in the Philippines \nand Thailand. These results highlight the uncertainty surrounding the transmission of spillovers from \nthe  ongoing  debt  crisis  in  the  eurozone  to  Asia\u2019s  local  currency  bond  markets.  Such  transmissions \nimply that Asian authorities should be prepared for any possible disruptive impacts of spillovers from \nmature markets (Azis, Mitra, and Baluga 2013).  \n\n \nMore recent analysis of regional spillover suggests that the role of shock spillover from Japan \nseems  to  be  getting  stronger,  while  that  of  the  US  has  weakened  (Table  10).  4  However,  this  varies \ndepending  on  the  variable  and  regional  group  under  consideration.  For  equity  returns,  intraregional \nspillovers or in own-country spillovers, in the case of the PRC, seem to be more dominant. For bond \nyield  differentials,  the  influence  of  Japan  is  indeed  stronger,  but  not  in  the  PRC.  Meanwhile,  for \nexchange rate movements, the US influence has declined and this was offset by an increase in Japan\u2019s \nshare, but only among the newly industrialized economies (includes Hong Kong, China; the Republic \nof  Korea;  and  Singapore  or  NIE-3).  Intraregional  exchange  rate  movements  were  more  dominant \namong ASEAN-4. \n \n\n \n\nTable 10: Vector Autoregression Analysis: Share of Growth Variance Due to Each Economy  \n(%) \n \n\nUS \n\nJapan \n\nASEAN-4 \n\nNIE-3 \n\nPRC \n\n10-Month \nAverage \n\nEquities \n\nASEAN-4 \n\nNIE-3 \n\nPRC \n\n2005\u20132009 \n2010\u20132014 \n\n2005\u20132009 \n\n2010\u20132014 \n\n2005\u20132009 \n\n2010\u20132014 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n47.8 \n\n21.7 \n\n47.3 \n\n40.9 \n\n20.1 \n\n25.5 \n\n37.8 \n\n70.8 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n47.2 \n\n55.1 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  \n\n77.2 \n\n71.8 \n\ncontinued on next page\n\n                                                 \n4   A Vector Autoregressive model is used for generating the variance decompositions for ASEAN-4, the NIE-3, and the PRC. \nMonthly data divided into two periods, January 2005 to December 2009 and January 2010 to August 2014, were used for \nequity  returns  and  5-year  government  bond  yields  data.

Policy recommendations \non  how  to  manage  capital  flows  are  therefore  designed  to  maximize  benefits  or  minimize  costs  of \ngreater financial integration. The main areas for consideration are policies to influence the composition \nof  capital  flows  toward  a greater  share  of  FDI,  macroprudential  policies  to  support  financial  stability, \nexchange  rate  coordination  to  reduce  the  resistance  of  policy  makers  to  currency  appreciation,  and \nregional financial cooperation to address possible externalities in capital flows. \n \n\nMost of these policies are derived from country experiences and literature reviews. Those that \nrelate  to  the  process  of  regional  cooperation  in  Asia  are  discussed  in  a  separate  section.  Capital \ncontrols  are  a  subset  of  macroprudential  polices.  However,  they  generate  a  lot  of  debate  on  their \neffectiveness.  The policy recommendations based on the study of Molnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai \n(2013) are also presented in a separate section. \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   31 \n\n \nIncrease Foreign Direct Investment and Its Share in Capital Inflows \n\nA. \n \nStandard measures to attract more FDI relate to better physical infrastructure, higher quality of human \ncapital,  and  improved  governance.  This  topic  has  been  analyzed  and  discussed  extensively.  This \nsection  looks  into  how  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC)  can  be  structured  to  attract  more \nFDI into Southeast Asia.5 \n \n\nThe removal of regulatory and legal barriers to international capital flows and the participation \nof  foreign  investors  in  domestic  firms  and  financial  markets  will  lead  to  more  FDI,  but  significant \nincreases in FDI can be realized only if the most important sectors are opened up and member states \nimplement \nimprove  their  core  business  environment.  This \ncomplementary policies that help improve the investment climate. \n\nrequires  that  member  states \n\n \nIndividual ASEAN countries are facing the huge challenge of improving their competitiveness. \nAs  many  experts  have  noted,  a  large  market  is  a  powerful  draw  for  investors,  but  multinational \ncorporations  serving  global  markets  increasingly  look  for  world-class  infrastructure;  skilled  and \nproductive  workers;  innovative  capabilities;  and  an  agglomeration  of  efficient  suppliers,  competitors, \nsupport  institutions,  and  services.  To  be  successful,  the  implementation  of  the  AEC  must  be \naccompanied by complementary policies and programs, especially at the national level. For example, \nmember states would do well to: \n \n\n(i) \n\ncontinue  implementing  reforms  under  the  AEC  and  the  ASEAN  Comprehensive \nInvestment Area (ACIA) commensurate with improvements in their domestic business \nenvironment, including economic regulations, corporate governance, and labor policies; \n(ii)  develop logistics infrastructure and strengthen legal systems to increase FDI inflows; and \n(iii)  devise,  unilaterally  and  collectively,  structural  adjustment  and  reform  assistance \nprograms  as  well  as  capacity  building  measures  to  help  those  who  could  be  adversely \naffected by reforms. \n\n \n\nIn a comprehensive study of the impact of the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) on FDI inflows \nto ASEAN, Plummer (2007) concludes that the AIA has had a generally positive effect and has helped \nopen  up  sectors  and  reduce  barriers  to  investment.  To  strengthen  and  enhance  the  AIA,  the  author \nproposes the following actions: \n \n\nIntroduce  collective  measures  to  be  taken  by  all  the  ASEAN  member  states  and  encourage \nindividual  member  states  to  lower  transaction  costs  and  strengthen  market  factors  to  facilitate \ninvestment and promote regional production networks. \n \n\n(i)  Widen  the  scope  of  industries  by  transferring  Mode  3  services  from  the  ASEAN \n\nFramework Agreement on Services (AFAS) to the AIA. \n\n(ii)  Combine  the  AIA,  the  1987  Agreement  for  the  Promotion  and  Protection  of \ninto  a \n\nInvestments,  and  appropriate  provisions  of  bilateral \ncomprehensive \u201cAIA-Plus\u201d agreement. (The AIA was eventually expanded to ACIA). \n\ninvestment  treaties \n\n                                                 \n5   The discussion is lifted from Aldaba, Yap, and Petri (2009), 106\u2013108. \n\n \n\n\f32   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\n(iii)  Harmonize  national  provisions  on  equity  ownership,  land  tenure,  nondiscriminatory \ntaxation,  movement  of  skilled  labor,  and  financial  flows  at  the  ASEAN  regional  level  to \nensure national treatment. \n\n(iv)  Consolidate timeframes for actions. \n(v) \n\nIdentify and then remove investment impediments, using specific procedures, and within \na specific timeframe. \n\n(vi)  Reduce  the  number  of  industries  and  sectors  under  the  sensitive  list  and  review  those \n\ncovered, with a view toward a phaseout. \n\n(vii)  Make  the  AIA-Plus  an  integral  part  of  the  AEC,  as  its  provisions  would  cover \n\ninvestments, services, capital flows, and skilled labor associated with investment. \n\n(viii)  Establish a mechanism for monitoring progress. \n(ix)  Expand  the  mandate  of  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  and  strengthen  its  technical  and \n\nanalytical capabilities. \n\n \n\nThese recommendations were made several years ago but most of them remain relevant in the \n\nMacroprudential Policies \n\nbuild up toward the establishment of the AEC at the end of 2015. \n \nB. \n \nPotential costs of capital inflows can be minimized. Macroprudential policy can act as a safeguard for \nfinancial  stability,  in  particular  to  deal  with  the  credit  and  asset  price  cycles  driven  by  global  capital \nflows  (Zhang  and  Zoli  2014).  The  experience  with  both  the  AFC  and  the  GFC  showed  that \nmacroprudential policy should be implemented in order to prevent financial volatility from overcoming \nsound  macroeconomic  fundamentals.  Zhang  and  Zoli  (2014)  find  that  over  time,  Asian  economies \nappear to have made greater use of macroprudential tools, especially housing-related measures, than \ntheir counterparts in other regions. Their analysis suggests that macroprudential policy and capital flow \nmeasures have helped curb housing price growth, equity flows, credit growth, and bank leverage. The \ninstruments  that  have  been  particularly  effective  in  this  regard  include  loan-to-value  ratio  caps, \nhousing  tax  measures,  and  foreign  currency-related  measures.  These  are  similar  to  the  findings  of \nMolnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai (2013). \n \n\nFigure 3 shows the level and composition of capital inflows into 11 ASEAN+3 economies. The \ncomposition  affects  the  degree  of  volatility  of  capital  flows  and  therefore,  the  risk  of  \u201csudden  stops\u201d \n(section III, and Figures 4 and 5). The higher share of FDI during the GFC episode compared with the \nAFC  is  an  important  factor  in  explaining  why  the  ASEAN+3  economies  were  not  as  hard  hit  by  the \nGFC. Moreover, it is believed that the behavior of domestic investors during periods of financial stress \nis more stabilizing than that of foreign investors (Jeanne 2014). To influence both the composition and \nlevel of capital flows, macroprudential policies have to be put in place. But with the advent of greater \nfinancial  integration,  capital  controls\u2014a  form  of  macroprudential  policy\u2014must  be  endorsed  at  the \ninternational level in order to be effective (Grenville 2012). In the absence of such an endorsement, for \nexample  from  the  IMF,  regional  cooperation  on  capital  controls  is  a  second  best  solution.  Regional \ncooperation on macroprudential policy can also address possible policy spillovers, (e.g., cross-border \nimpacts  of  blanket  guarantees  of  deposit  insurance,  capital  control  measures,  or  adoption  of \nmacroprudential policies), which could have side effects on capital flows that could be destabilizing for \nother economies in the region (Kawai and Morgan 2014).  \n \n\nAnother reason that macroprudential policies have become important is because the specific \ncause of a crisis becomes different with each episode. Macroprudential policies can reduce systemic \nrisk  by  reducing  excessive  capital  flows.  However,  macroprudential  policies  have  to  be  implemented \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   33 \n\nwith  caution.  For  one  thing,  Azis  (2014)  argues  that  monetary  policy  has  to  take  into  account  the \nmacroeconomic effects emanating from macroprudential policy, and vice versa. This is related to one \nof  the  building  blocks  of  macroprudential  policy,  which  consists  of  designing  a  set  of  internally \nconsistent  macroeconomic  policies  involving  both  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  (Brunschwig  et  al. \n2011).  One  argument  is  that  reasonable  prudential  policies  may  not  suffice  to  maintain  financial \nstability if they are not supported by practical monetary policies. For example, raising credit standards \nwill not effectively contain excessive leverage if very low interest rates are maintained for so long that \nthey foment excessive risk-taking. \n \nC. \n \nThe main issue with regard to capital controls is their effectiveness. This will depend largely on the nature \nof the flows, the structure of the economy, and the capacity of the economic authorities. The study of \nMolnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai (2013) provides a useful empirical analysis for the Asia and Pacific \nregion. It has two main objectives: (i) to assess the degree of countries\u2019 openness to capital flows and its \nvariation across countries and over time and (ii) to investigate what types of factors\u2014including different \ntypes of controls on the flow of capital\u2014drive sudden changes in various types of inflows and outflows. \nThe major findings are as follows (Molnar, Tateno, and Supornsinchai 2013, 32\u201334):  \n \n\nCapital Controls \n\nTargeted  controls  appear  effective.  Capital  inflow  bonanzas  on  the  portfolio  account  can \nbest  be  prevented  by  not  allowing  residents  to  sell,  issue,  or  purchase  bonds  abroad  or \nnonresidents to sell or issue equities in the domestic market. Selling or issuing bonds abroad by \nresidents is mostly in larger quantities due to the fixed costs of issuance and the economies of \nscale;  therefore,  restricting  this  activity  is  clearly  a  way  to  avoid  large  and  sudden  inflows.  A \nsimilar  explanation  may  hold  for  foreign  equity  issues  in  the  domestic  market.  To  avoid  debt \nportfolio  inflow  bonanzas,  the  key  is  to  limit  the  inflow  of  money  market  and  collective \ninvestment  instruments.  Among  the  inflow  measures,  it  is  the  sale  or  issuance  abroad  of \nmoney market or collective investment instruments by residents that are shown to be effective \nto avoid debt portfolio investment booms.  \n \nThe  policy  environment  matters. Previous  inflows of the respective type of capital have an \nindependent  explanatory  power  in  determining  inflow  bonanzas.  That  is,  increasing  inflows \nmay be a warning sign of a coming boom. Conversely, the stock of inflows appears to have a \nnegative impact on the probability of an inflow bonanza in the case of equities and positive in \nthe case of cross-border credit, though in this latter case, only for large inflows. The stock of \ninflows  does  not  appear  to  affect  the  probability  of  portfolio  investment  inflow  booms. \nPrevious  growth  performance  of  the  domestic  economy  increases  the  probability  of  equity \ninflow booms, but not of other types of capital. Global risk appetite also makes inflow booms \nmore likely in the case of overall inflows, equity portfolio investment and cross-border lending. \nIn  the  case  of  financial  credit  bonanzas,  the  depth  of  the  financial  system  is  an  important \ndeterminant  of  bonanzas\u2014deeper  financial  markets  are  less  prone  to  experience  volatile \ninflows.  This  finding  has  direct  policy  implications\u2014the  deepening  of  financial  markets  can \nreduce the probability of volatile flows; or, without deep financial markets, it may be hazardous \nto open up the capital account to cross-border flows. \n \nControlling resident flows appears  more  effective. The pattern emerged from the analyses \nof  the  determinants  of  the  probability  of  inflow  bonanzas  suggests  that  control  measures \ntargeting  residents  may  be  more  effective  than  those  targeting  nonresidents.  In  particular, \nrestricting  the  sale  or  issuance  of  equities,  bonds,  money  market  instruments  and  collective \n\n \n\n\f34   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\ninvestment instruments abroad by residents, appeared effective in reducing the probability of \ninflow surges.  \n \nIn  addition,  limiting  the  purchase  of  bonds,  money  market  instruments  and  collective \ninvestment  instruments  by  residents  also  seems  to  effectively  reduce  the  probability  of  inflow \nbonanzas that is more puzzling. While the sale or purchase of such instruments is an outflow from the \nbalance  of  payments\u2019  point  of  view,  the  restriction  of  purchasing  such  instruments  may  affect  the \nprobability of sudden inflows by inhibiting the ability of domestic investors to repatriate large amounts \nof  funds  previously  invested  in  these  instruments  owing  to,  for  instance,  heightening  of  global  risk \naversion  or  urgent  repatriation  needs  related  to  the  domestic  economic  environment  or  business \noperations. In contrast, restricting flows of foreign-owned capital appears to work only in a few cases, \nsuch  as  controlling  collective  investment  instruments,  in  particular,  their  sale  locally  by  nonresidents \nand the sale and issuance of bonds by nonresidents. \n\nExchange Rate Coordination Has to Be Reconsidered \n\n \nAnother proposal on the implementation of capital controls has been provided by Gochoco-\nBautista and Rhee (2013). They suggest that the absence of persistent current account imbalances be \na  precondition  to  the  use  of  capital  controls.  This  is  anchored  on  the  principle  that  a  country\u2019s \nsovereign  right  to  use  all  available  tools  and  implement  policies  that  they  deem  best  should  be \nrespected, as long as there are no substantial negative externalities on other countries. \n \nD. \n \nOne  reason  for  the  concern  over  currency  appreciation  is  that  policy  makers  are  concerned  that \ndomestic firms will lose competitiveness either in the domestic or global markets. The exchange rate \nalso influences the current account and was a key factor in the AFC. It will be useful if the exchange \nrate can be part of the monitoring and surveillance process in Asia. There need not even be reference \nto  a  long-term  goal  of  a  single  currency.  Exchange  rate  coordination  can  be  conducted  at  a \nrudimentary level. What is important is to determine if there are sizable changes in the REERs that may \nlead to imbalances; or else, macroeconomic imbalances can cause excessive exchange rate volatility. \n \n\nThis  issue  was  examined  recently  by  Kawai  and  Pontines  (2014).  They  too  find  that  since \n2000, the PRC authorities and those of most East Asian currencies have increased their exchange rate \nflexibility  against  the  US  dollar.  They  also  consider  how  greater  regional  monetary  and  currency \ncoordination  could  help  to  achieve  intra-East  Asian  exchange  rate  stability.  Given  that  the  renminbi \noperates  on  a  standard  drawing  right  (SDR)  basket  system  (comprising  the  US  dollar,  euro,  pound \nsterling,  and  yen)  and  most  other  East  Asian  currencies  on  an  SDR+  basket  system  (comprising  the \nsame currencies plus an emerging East Asian currency such as the renminbi), achieving intraregional \nexchange rate stability may be difficult. For a start, the PRC would have to reduce the weight of the US \ndollar in its dollar-dominant SDR basket system and  increase exchange rate  flexibility  substantially  if \nsignificant  capital  account  liberalization  is  to  be  achieved.  The  study  suggests  that  a  transition  to \ngreater  convergence  of  exchange  rate  regimes  would  have  to  begin  with  similar  managed  floating \nregimes  based  on  an  SDR  or  SDR+  basket  and  then  move  to  an  Asian  Currency  Unit  (ACU)  basket \nonce sufficient economic and structural convergence has been achieved among the economies. \n \n\nThis study does not recommend any particular approach to exchange rate coordination. What \nis important is to resurrect this issue and make it part of the agenda of either the Economic Review and \nPolicy Dialogue (ERPD) or the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), or both. \n \n \n\n\fManaging Capital Flows in Asia: An Overview of Key Issues   |   35 \n\nRegional Financial Cooperation \n\nE. \n \nAn effective policy agenda for financial liberalization focuses on maximizing the gains and minimizing \nthe  risks  associated  with  financial  development.  Such  an  agenda  would  entail  adoption  of  policy \nmeasures at all levels: domestic, regional, and international. A major issue in this section is how regional \nfinancial  cooperation  can  facilitate  the  transition  to  financial  openness,  including  capital  account \nliberalization. ADB (2008) identifies the major weaknesses in any given financial regime to be: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\ninsufficient market opening and capital account liberalization; \nlimited  and  varying  degrees  of  transparency,  financial  regulation,  financial  supervision, \nand governance; \ninadequacies in risk management in financial firms and markets; and \nthe  heterogeneity  of  supervisory,  accounting  and  auditing  rules,  and  regulatory \nframeworks across countries. \n\n \n\nA  prioritized  agenda  for  countries  deepening  their  financial  development  would  include: \n(i) strengthening the banking sector primarily by improving its regulation and supervision; (ii) adoption \nof international norms and standards; and (iii) promotion of capital markets, especially local currency \nbond  markets,  to  create  the  liquidity  and  innovative  financial  products  required  to  attract  a  broader \nand more diversified investor base. \n\n \nCan  regional  financial  cooperation  in  Asia  advance  the  development  of  the  financial  system \nand if so, how? The main avenue is through the development of the local bond market, which would be \nthe  natural  environment  to  develop  long-term,  local  currency-denominated  debt  instruments  that \nwould  provide  a  more  stable  and  reliable  financing  framework.  Many  Asian  economists  and  policy \nmakers  argued  that  an  integrated  Asian  bond  market  would  be  valuable  in  achieving  such  a  liability \nstructure  (Ito  and  Park  2004).  Following  this  view,  Asian  authorities  initiated  various  regional \ninitiatives  to  strengthen  and  deepen  local  currency  bond  markets.  The  monetary  authorities  of  East \nAsia  launched  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI),  which  focuses  on  the  supply  side  or \ninfrastructure  of  bond  markets,  including  clearing  and  settlement  systems,  rating  agencies,  and \ndenomination currencies.  \n\n \nMeanwhile, the Executives' Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks launched the Asian \nBond  Fund  in  2003  to  promote  the  development  of  national  and  regional  bond  markets  by  directly \ncreating bond funds. The Asian Bond Fund framework has made local currency bonds more attractive \nto investors and helped develop deeper and more liquid national bond markets. It has also encouraged \nregulatory and tax reforms\u2014for instance, prompting some national governments to offer withholding \ntax exemptions on investment income to nonresident investors and others to loosen capital controls. \n\n \nSince  2008,  ASEAN+3  has  focused  on  four  key  areas  in  developing  the  local  currency  bond \nmarkets  (LCBMs)  under  ABMI,  namely:  (i)  promoting  issuance  of  local  currency  bonds  (LCBs), \n(ii) facilitating  the  demand  of  LCBs,  (iii)  improving  the  regulatory  framework,  and  (iv)  improving \nrelated infrastructure for bond markets. \n\n \nThe  establishment  of  the  Credit  Guarantee  and  Investment  Facility  (CGIF)  was  a  measure \nintended to promote the issuance of LCBs. The CGIF is an important outcome of the ABMI that has \nbeen  gradually  developed  since  2005  through  policy  dialogue,  close  coordination,  and  collaboration \nbetween ASEAN+3 and ADB. The finance ministers endorsed the creation of a credit guarantee and \n\n \n\n\f36   |   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 464 \n\ninvestment  mechanism  as  a  trust  fund  of  ADB.  The  establishment  of  the  CGIF  trust  fund  was \napproved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in April 2010, with an initial capital of $700 million. The CGIF \nseeks to promote the development of Asian bond markets by providing guarantees for investors that \nmake it easier for firms to issue local currency bonds with longer maturities. Longer term, it is expected \nto promote the harmonization  of standards and practices for bond issuance and help channel Asia\u2019s \nsavings to finance long-term investment in local currencies, notably in regional infrastructure and other \nkey areas. This, in turn, will promote regional financial market integration, make Asia less vulnerable to \nexternal shocks, and boost economic growth. CGIF is expected to issue several credit guarantees for \nbonds  issued  within  the  region  in  2014.  There  could  be  a  new  call  for  capital  increase  as  CGIF  has \nalready increased its leverage ratio from 1 to 2.5. \n\n \nTo  facilitate  the  demand  for  LCBs,  ASEAN+3  has  established  and  funded  the  operations  of \nwww.asianbondsonline.adb.org  and  the  publication  of  the  Asian  Bond  Monitor  in  order  to  provide \ninformation on the development of LCBMs in the region to market participants. A study on Broadening \nInvestor  Base  for  LCBMs  in  ASEAN+2  (Japan  was  excluded)  was  also  undertaken  to  provide  policy \nrecommendations  to  member  countries  on  measures  to  broaden  investor  base  for  LCBs  to  help \nminimize the impact of reversal of capital flows on member countries. \n\n \nASEAN+3 established the Asian Bond Market Forum (ABMF) in 2010 as a common platform \nto foster standardization of market practices and harmonization of regulations relating to cross-border \nbond  transactions  in  the  region.    To  provide  information  on  market  regulations  and  practices  in  11 \nASEAN+3  economies,  a  bond  market  guide  is  provided  in  www.asianbondsonline.adb.org.  ABMF  is \nalso  developing  an    ASEAN+3  Multi-currency  Bond  Issuance  Framework,  a  common  regional  bond \nissuance  program  to  allow  qualified  issuers  from  any  country  in  ASEAN+3  to  issue  LCBs  in  any \nASEAN+3  currency  in  the  ASEAN+3  region.  ABMF  is  also  working  toward  streamlining  bond \ntransaction flows, including more simplified disclosure requirements. \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAPPENDIXES \n\nAppendix 1: Methodology for Identifying Capital Flow Wave Episodes \n\n \nThe methodology for identifying the episodes is adopted from the Capital Flow Waves: Surges, Stops, \nFlight, and Retrenchment paper by Forbes and Warnock (2011).

The simple model used is based on Robin Koepke\u2019s (2013) paper written for the International \nInstitute of Finance. The key explanatory variable representing the QE tapering is the expected US Fed \npolicy rate reflected in the US FFF contract maturing by end-December 2015.8 The other key variable \nis \u201cperceived global risk,\u201d as measured by the changes in the spread of BBB-rated US corporate bonds \nover  the  US  10-year  treasury  rate.9  The  growth  of  industrial  production  in  the  PRC\u2014lagged  one \nperiod\u2014was also included in the regression.  \n\n \nCountry dummies were used in the fixed effect panel regressions. The model assumes there is \na stronger slope coefficient for the key variable of expected FFF rate during the period from 23 May \n2013  to  18  September  2013.  Because  the  regressions  use  monthly  data,  the  dummy  \u201ctaper1\u201d  would \ninclude the months of June 2013 to September 2013.10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6   J.

ADB Economics Working Paper Series. \n\n7   The S&P Investable Funds is a composite price index per country made up mostly of equities open to foreign investors. \n8   The  expected  US  Fed  policy  rate  is  computed  as  100  minus  the  average  daily  US  FFF  contract  price  for  the  delivery \nmonth\u2014for  example,  a  6.5%  rate  equals  a  93.50  contract  price.  It  acts  as  a  forecast  of  the  average  monthly  level  of  the \nFederal funds rate. It is postulated that if the QE is expected to continue as is, there would be low expected future interest \nrates, and investors will have a stronger risk appetite to invest in emerging market portfolios. On the other hand, if the QE is \nexpected to be tapered by significant amounts, there would be significantly higher future interest rates, and investors will \nreduce their risk appetite to invest in emerging market portfolios. \n\n9   A  BBB-rated  corporation  refers  to  a  corporate  entity  seen  to  have  adequately  weakened  during  adverse  economic \nconditions. Thus, the spread between this and the rate of the least risky bond\u2014the US 10-year treasury note\u2014is seen as a \nmeasure of the perceived risk to a medium investment-grade firm. \n\n10  A change in the dummy from May 2013 to September 2013 showed almost the same results as the regressions presented in \n\nthe table. \n\n\fAppendixes   |   39 \n\nAppendix 3: Methodology \n\n \nBivariate and Multivariate GARCH  \n \nThe methodology for identifying the  episodes is adopted from The Threat  of Financial  Contagion to \nEmerging Asia\u2019s Local Bond Markets: Spillovers from Global Crises paper by Azis et al. (2013). \n \n\nThe  paper  employed  multivariate  Generalized  Autoregressive  Conditional  Heteroskedastic \n(GARCH)  models  with  a  Baba-Engle-Kraft-Kroner  specification  to  show  significant  shock  and \nvolatility spillovers from the US and the EU bond markets into Asian local currency bond markets. The \nanalysis was extended to show indirect spillovers within domestic asset markets and across economies. \nDaily data was divided into three periods: (i) precrisis period (July 2005\u2013August 2008), (ii) Lehman \ncollapse  period  (September  2008\u2013March  2009),  and  (iii)  peak  of  eurozone  debt  crisis  (September \n2011\u2013May 2012). Week-on-week returns on the 5-year US Treasury bond yields, 5-year German bund \nyields, 5-year EU composite government bond yields were used, US high-yield corporate bond yields \n(with  a  Baa  rating  from  Moody\u2019s),  and  EU  high-yield  corporate  bond  yields  (mainly  finance  sector \nbonds)  were  used  to  determine  the  direct  transmission  from  advanced  economies  to  the  Asian \neconomies\u2019 5-year government bond yields. Asian economies include the PRC, Indonesia, the Republic \nof  Korea,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand.

These capital \nflows generate both benefits and costs. The latter are associated with episodes of currency and banking \ncrises like the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial and economic crisis. Recent data show \nthat the main impact of capital flows on the economies of East Asia is reflected in real effective exchange \nrates, equity prices, and accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. In particular, econometric results show \nthe strong linkages between the United States bond markets and those in Asia, particularly the adverse \nimpact of quantitative easing tapering on Asian economies. These findings support the important role of \nmacroprudential policy, which can be implemented in the context of regional cooperation in order to reduce \nnegative spillovers across economies in Asia.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, \nit remains home to the majority of the world\u2019s poor.
