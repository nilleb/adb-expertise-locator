The primary objective of RETA\n5860 was to strengthen the system of collection of environment statistics. Among\nothers, the RETA assisted these countries to prepare a Framework for\nDevelopment of Environment Statistics (FDES) and to publish a Compendium\nof Environment Statistics (CES). The present paper makes use of the material\ncontained in each country\u2019s FDES and CES. Other sources have been used as\nwell, including information obtained during the various workshops and training\nprograms and additional research produced by Asian Development Bank (ADB),\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Economic\nCommission for Europe (ECE), and other international institutions. The paper\nis intended to serve several purposes. First, it provides an up-to-date assessment\nof environmental conditions relating to air and water. Second, major flaws and\ngaps in the existing national statistical systems are identified and discussed and\nsome tentative priorities for improvement are suggested. Some of the evidence\npresented in the paper is compelling. Hopefully, these results will serve as a\ncatalyst for national statisticians and environment officials to continue their efforts\nto improve environment statistics in the region.\n48", "I. INTRODUCTION\nE\nfforts to improve environmental conditions in Central Asia1 must overcome some daunting\nchallenges. First, the present governments of these countries have inherited a unique\nset of problems from their predecessors. A major concern is the steady deterioration of water\nreservoirs in the region, especially the Aral Sea Basin. Other prominent issues are the potential\ndangers posed by radioactivity and deposits of hazardous wastes in certain areas and the threat\nof desertification. The origin of these problems can be traced back to policy decisions made decades\nago, but the need for an effective response is urgent.\nSecond, countries throughout the region have experienced a depression much deeper and\nmore prolonged than in other transition economies (see Table 1). The depression began in 1990,\nshortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Levels of economic activity continued to fall until\nthe mid-1990s. Growth eventually resumed but the pace of the recovery has been excruciatingly\nslow. So far, just two of the five countries in this study (Mongolia and Uzbekistan) have regained\nground in the past decade. In Tajikistan, the latest estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) is\nlittle more than half that recorded ten years ago while in Kyrgyzstan the current figure is less\nthan three quarters of the value in 1991. The duration and depth of this depression, coupled with\nthe need to introduce programs of economic reform and modernization, have severely curbed\npolicymakers\u2019 ability to address their environmental problems.\nTable 1.

They must\nfind ways to overcome the harsh environmental legacy of the past, and must do in a period of\nfinancial stringency, economic uncertainty, and institutional turmoil. The latest data on air and\nwater pollution is summarized in the following pages. The discussion also looks at the statistical\nsystems in the five countries and identifies the more important weaknesses and shortcomings.\nII. AIR POLLUTION AND RELATED STATISTICAL ISSUES\nThe pattern of air pollution in Central Asia differs in certain respects from that in most\nother emerging economies. The main reason for this distinction is the region\u2019s prolonged and deep\neconomic recession. This section begins by reviewing the latest evidence on long-term trends in\naerial emissions, including some of the more important spatial characteristics of the problem. Attention\nthen turns to methods of data collection and systems to monitor air quality. The section concludes\nwith an examination of the weaknesses and inherent problems in current systems of air\nmanagement.\nA. Long-term Trends in Aerial Emissions\nRecent figures for air emissions from stationary and mobile sources are shown in Table 2.2\nDuring the 1990s, the volume of emissions fell substantially in Kazakhstan (52 percent) and the\nKyrgyz Republic (70 percent). In Tajikistan, emissions from stationary sources dropped by 74 percent\nduring the same period although in Uzbekistan the decline was just 13 percent between 1995\nand 2000. The relative importance of the two sources also differs among the countries. In\nKazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, most emissions come from stationary sources while mobile sources\nare the major polluter in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\nThe overriding determinant of the changes occurring during the 1990s was the economic\ncollapse after the breakup of the Soviet Union. A precipitous drop in industrial activity and associated\ninputs such as energy was the main reason for the lower levels of emissions. By mid-decade, all\neconomies had stabilized, albeit at much lower levels of output. Since then, GDP levels have been\ngradually rising (see Table 1) and the volume of air emissions has either fallen very little or increased\nmodestly.\n2 Although Mongolia reports a fall in air emissions during the 1990s, no data is available at the national level.\n  A set of estimates for Ulaanbaatar has been constructed from information provided in the country\u2019s\n  compendiumand can be found in Table A1.\n2", "Section II\nAir Pollution and Related Statistical Issues\nThe picture is much the same when the volume of emissions is related to the level of GDP.\nBoth Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan report a fall in emissions per unit of GDP throughout the 1990s.\nHowever, annual changes during the last few years of the decade reveal no clear trend. In\nKyrgyzstan, the volume of emissions per unit of GDP actually rose during the decade and partial\ndata for Tajikistan suggests that the same occurred in that country.3\nTable 2.

The emissions of some pollutants tend to rise over time while the\nsignificance of others diminishes. At the same time, the macroeconomic relationship between the\nlevel of economic activity and the volume of emissions should change. Additional investment allows\nthe introduction of new technologies that are not just more efficient but also cleaner than their\npredecessors. Meanwhile, the share of heavy industry in total output tends to fall as services and\nnew industries spring up. When these types of structural changes are reinforced by an effective\nprogram of environmental protection, the links between the level of economic activity and the volume\nof pollution will (hopefully) become weaker.\nHow do these stylistic features fit with the evidence for Central Asia? Table 3 shows the\nvolume of various pollutants released into the atmosphere by stationary sources.4\nTable 3.

Sulfur dioxide has consistently been the major source\nof air pollution in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, carbon monoxide generally accounts for the bulk\nof air emissions in Tajikistan, and dust and sulfur dioxide are the principal sources in Kyrgyzstan.\nTable 4 compares short-term changes in pollution levels with the corresponding changes\nin GDP. The abrupt decline in economic activity during the first half of the 1990s is clearly reflected\nby a reduction in all pollutants. That result is to be expected since many enterprises were closed\nand large tracts of industrial capacity were scrapped during this period. But in later years there\nis no evidence that the historical relationship between positive rates of economic growth and higher\nvolumes of emissions has weakened\u2014despite all the structural changes occurring during the first\nhalf of the 1990s. This experience differs from that of several ex-Soviet economies in East and\nCentral Europe. In the latter countries, a \u201cdecoupling\u201d between these two variables has been observed\nin the years since independence (see Box 1).\n5", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nBox 1. Evidence of Environmental Decoupling in East Europe\nDecoupling occurs when a particular environmental measure is found to be stable or\ndecreasing while the associated economic force is growing. The OECD has developed a number\nof indicators to track any changes in the relationship between these two variables over time.\nFor example, at the national level the growth rate for emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen\noxides can be compared with the growth rate of GDP. If GDP displays positive growth, \u201cabsolute\ndecoupling\u201d is said to occur when the growth rate of the environmental variable is zero or\nnegative, that is, the pressure on the environment is either stable or falling. \u201cRelative\ndecoupling\u201d occurs when the growth of the environmental variable is positive, but less than the\ngrowth of GDP. The graph below shows some recent evidence of decoupling for ex-Soviet\neconomies in East Europe. Similar calculations could not be carried out for Central Asian\ncountries for two reasons. First, when the level of economic activity is falling, the indicators do\nnot necessarily imply a positive development for society as a whole. Second, the time period\navailable to measure these trends is too brief and the data too fragmented to produce a reliable\nset of estimates.\nEstimates of Decoupling for Sulfur Oxide and Nitrogen Oxide\nin Selected Countries, 1990-1998a\nNitrogen Oxide / GDP Sulfur Oxide / GDP\nCzech Republic\nHungary\nPoland\nSlovak Republic\nNo decoupling 0 Decoupling No decoupling 0 Decoupling\nNote:The measure is defined as 1-(EP/DF) end of period/(EP/DF) start of period where EP=environmental\npressure and DF=driving force.

First, many of the industrial enterprises that have managed to continue operations\nrely on outdated technologies and processing equipment that are poorly maintained. Second, private\n7", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\ndwellers and some industrial enterprises (including thermal power stations) have reverted to using\nsolid fuels of local origin with a high caloric value and sulfur content. Third, the air pollution\nabatement technologies found in many enterprises are either obsolete and inefficient or not used\nat all. Fourth, when the economies of the region began to recover, idle capacity was simply returned\nto service without incorporating new technologies or improved systems of abatement. Finally, new\ninvestment remains at a very low level throughout the region, and in some countries is nonexistent.\nThe lack of capital denies enterprises access to new technologies that are generally not only more\nefficient but also cleaner. Instead, capital-starved firms have been forced to introduce cost-saving\nmeasures that are second-best and entail substantial environmental costs.\nB. Spatial Characteristics\nDescribing air pollution in Central Asia would not be complete without considering the\nspatial characteristics of the problem. Specific data for all five countries may be obtained from\nthe authors. In Kazakhstan, emissions have fallen over time but the air quality in the most polluted\nregions has not improved appreciably. The three provinces (Karagandinskaya, Pavlodarskaya,)\nand Voctochno-Kazakhstankaya) with the highest pollution levels accounted for 64 percent of\nthe national total in 1990 and 74 percent in 2000.5\nRecent data on the quality of air in Kazakhstan\u2019s major cities is shown in Table 5. Estimates\nare expressed in terms of the IZA5 index, a measure commonly used during the Soviet era. The\nindex records the exceedences of five representative pollutants, together with their toxicity classes.\nThe air is considered polluted if the index is higher than 5. Nine of the cities in the table report\nexcessive levels of pollution in 2000 and in six cities the index has consistently exceeded the acceptable\nmaximum over the past ten years. In each case a small group of specific industries and firms\u2014\ntypically nonferrous metallurgy plants, coal-fired power plants, producers of building materials,\nand petroleum refining operations\u2014account for a disproportionate amount of total emissions. In\nthe most polluted cities, the average concentrations of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide,\nand toxic hydrocarbons have been rising each year and regularly exceed the corresponding\nmaximum permissible contaminations (MPCs). More generally, air quality in most of Kazakhstan\u2019s\ncities has improved but high concentrations of many pollutants are still a matter of considerable\nconcern in many locations.\n5 The volume of pollution in the three provinces fell from 3 million tons in 1990 to 1.8 million tons in 2002.\n8", "Section II\nAir Pollution and Related Statistical Issues\nTable 5.

Not surprisingly, Bishkek appears\nto be the most heavily polluted, accounting for 34-37 percent of the country\u2019s total pollution by\nstationary sources throughout the 1990s. When measured in terms of per capita emissions, pollution\nlevels in Bishkek are about 2.5 times the national average. However, the data in Table 6 indicates\nproblems in other cities as well. Data from other studies support this view, showing that average\nannual concentrations of dust, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exceeded\nnational standards (MPCs) in several cities during the 1990s (ECE 2001, chapter 7).\nTable 6.

One drawback is\nthe small number of stations in operation and the simplicity of the criteria used to determine their\nlocation. Averages are also computed from a very few observations and sometimes combine data\nfrom stations located in markedly different environments.6 Another reason for concern is that\nthe measurements themselves are performed manually according to somewhat antiquated methods\nthat were used in the former Soviet Union. Finally, the national standards maximum allowable\nconcentrations (MACs) are not comparable with international standards set by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) because different averaging times and statistical expressions are employed.\nLess is known about the quality of air in Mongolia. However, a limited amount of information\nis supplied in the country\u2019s CES and this has been used to construct a set of estimates for the\ncapital city, Ulaanbaatar. Approximately 30 percent of the country\u2019s population lives in Ulaanbaatar\nbut the volume of air emissions in 2000 was more than 147,000 tons. This figure is roughly\nequivalent to the reported total for the entire country of Uzbekistan in the same year.\nAnecdotal evidence offers several reasons for the poor quality of air. First, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s\nthermal power stations and coal-fired boiler heating stations are equipped with extremely\nrudimentary pollution control devices. Second, a large majority of the population depends on highly\ninefficient, coal-using stoves for heating and cooking. A third source of pollution is the transportation\nsector. The number of automobiles in Mongolia is rising rapidly, although the country\u2019s fleet of\nvehicles is ancient and its highway systems are not designed for the present levels of traffic.\nMoreover, there is apparently no program for the regulation of emissions and no incentives to\nupgrade the vehicle fleet.\nThere is limited information on the spatial distribution of air pollutants in Tajikistan but\ndata reported in the CES show that the bulk of all emissions is concentrated in one region and\nan overwhelming proportion\u2014more than 76 percent of the countrywide total\u2014occur in just one\ncity, Tursun-Zade. These statistics, however, are presumably estimates and must be treated with\ngreat caution.7 More details reported elsewhere in the CES indicate that MPCs were exceeded\nin Dushanbe in 1999-2000 for hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, sulfur, formaldehyde, nitrogen\ndioxide, and ozone. An accurate picture of the spatial distribution in the country is not possible\nbut the bits of data that are available are sufficient to suggest the existence of serious problems\nin specific locations and/or regions.\nIn Uzbekistan where air quality was monitored in 39 cities and towns, approximately\n40 percent of all emissions from stationary sources occur in the Tashkent oblast and that share\nhas been rising steadily since 1995. The situation is worst near industrial zones where the maximum\n6 In at least some cases, for example, annual average values have been computed from no more than 225-250\nobservations taken over the course a year from several stations.\n7 In fact, monitoring activities have been sharply reduced in recent years and are now carried out in only two cities,\nDushanbe and Kurgan-Tube.\n10", "Section II\nAir Pollution and Related Statistical Issues\nhourly concentrations of pollutants are reported to significantly exceed national standards. Chemical\nand metal industries are among the most prolific polluters. These industries have plants located\naround Almalyk, Chirchik, Samarkand, and Fergana where the highest levels of emissions are\nreported. About 1,500 of all stationary air pollution sources (3 percent of the total) are not equipped\nwith dust and acid gas controls while existing equipment is reported to be functioning with an\nefficiency rate not higher than 70 percent.\nC. Methods of Data Collection\nIn general, any national program to assess air quality employs several methods in\ncombination. These may include:\n(i) a network of monitoring stations;\n(ii) one or more models that can be used for interpolation and prediction; and\n(iii) a set of emission inventories developed through estimation (for example, using emission\nfactors), and direct measurement of emissions from large industrial point sources.\nThe combined use of these tools can yield reliable indications of air quality. Rudimentary versions\nof each method can be found in Central Asia, but their application and efficacy leaves much to\nbe desired.\nThe monitoring systems currently in operation around the region are far less robust than\nthey were a decade ago. The data in Table 7 summarizes the main features for each of the five\ncountries included in this study. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have the most comprehensive systems\nbut all countries\u2014even those with very meager capabilities\u2014have had to scale back their operations\nin recent years. Monitoring networks in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan are especially limited.\nIn fact, the combined number of stations currently in operation in these three countries is fewer\nthan in either Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. Issues such as sampling methods or the criteria used\nto determine the location of stations are of little consequence when monitoring capabilities are\nso limited. More importantly, the data being produced in these circumstances are too incomplete\nand imprecise to be used by policymakers or environmental specialists.\nAlthough the monitoring systems in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are the most extensive,\nthe quality of the data is still suspect. In Kazakhstan, the number of sites monitored, types of\npollutants, and frequency of sampling have all been scaled back in recent years. In Almaty, only\ntwo of 13 stations were actually functioning in 1999 and at present five are in operation. No\ninformation is available on the situation in Uzbekistan but other observers have noted that the\nnumber of stations is inadequate and that equipment is obsolete. Accordingly, questions have been\nraised about the quality of the data (ECE 2001, 71-72).\n11", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nTable 7.

Authorities have also been forced to reduce the number of pollutants\nthat are monitored. Frequently, the indexes that are subsequently produced using the reduced\nset of pollutants are simply presented alongside earlier estimates calculated on the basis of the\noriginal set. The result is that the new index typically shows an improvement in conditions but\nthis is a statistical anomaly owing to the reduced coverage.\n13", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nThe inability to maintain an adequate network of monitoring stations is apparent when\nexamining the data on mobile sources of pollution\u2014mainly traffic-related emissions. Traffic, along\nwith energy and heavy industry, is a major source of air pollution in all five countries. There are\ngood reasons to suspect that the volume of traffic emissions has been increasing rapidly (see Box 2).\nThe fact that traffic emissions are highly concentrated in urban areas adds to the severity of the\nproblem. In order to supplement the scanty information gathered by monitoring, statisticians\nestimate vehicle emissions on the basis of quantities of fuels sold at service stations. A reliable\nset of results would require detailed information on characteristics such as the vintage of the vehicle\nfleet, kilometers driven, driving patterns, and other indicators that do not exist.\nBox 2. The Growing Problem of Traffic-related Emissions\nTraffic reportedly accounts for 60-90 percent of air emissions in many Central Asian cities\nand as much as 90 percent of emissions of lead. Moreover, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting\nthat the volume of traffic-related emissions in urban areas has been rising, even in periods\nwhen total emissions have fallen. There are several reasons for the problem. First, the number\nof passenger cars is growing exponentially. In Mongolia, the number of automobiles rose over\n450 percent between 1990 and 2000. A large but unknown increase is also reported in\nKyrgyzstan and in Kazakhstan\u2014the country with the largest fleet of passenger cars\u2014where the\nnumber rose by 24 percent in 1990-2000. The number of cars per capita is low but has also been\ngrowing at a staggering pace. Second, the average age of each country\u2019s vehicle fleet is old\n(considerably more than ten years) and poorly maintained. In Kyrgyzstan, inspections have\nshown that up to 40 percent of vehicles exceed the standards for toxicity and smoke emissions,\nwhile in Kazakhstan spot checks revealed that emissions of about 80 percent of cars are 2-3\ntimes higher than the national standard. Third, existing procedures for inspection and\nenforcement of standards are haphazard and widely flaunted. For example, the illegal practice\nof introducing lead additives to commercial petrol is a region-wide problem. It occurs even in\nKazakhstan, a country which produces its own petrol, of which as much as 80 percent is lead-\nfree. The illegal use of lead additives is estimated to add as much as one gram of lead per liter\nof fuel. Finally, the new cars imported into the region usually come with catalytic converters but\nmany are removed after reaching the local market.\nIn the case of stationary sources, countries generally rely on the enterprises themselves\nto report emission values. Independent inspections are conducted and pollution limits are determined\nby law, with fees and fines sometimes levied. However, few countries (if any) have sufficient\nmanpower and expertise to carry out a thorough program of inspections.8 Statisticians are often\nforced to resort to a \u201cbottom-up\u201d method of estimation to determine total pollution by stationary\nsources. Their calculations are based on the annual reports that operators of emission sources are\nobliged to provide to authorities, and there is a strong likelihood of underestimation.\n8 In Bishkek, for example, there are only eight inspectors to control 800 point sources, with an average of 40 controls\nper month (ECE 2000b, 95).\n14", "Section II\nAir Pollution and Related Statistical Issues\nD. Systems of Air Management\nThere is growing pressure for Central Asian countries to improve their management systems\nand bring them more closely in line with the guidelines recommended by the WHO. If the economic\nrecovery in the region gains strength, levels of air pollution will inevitably grow and so, too, will\nthe need to modernize and upgrade national standards and emission limits. Statisticians can expect\nthat the demands placed on them will increase significantly over the next decade.\nTable 8 summarizes the main features of the air management systems in use today. All\ncountries share several common characteristics. Much of the legal framework is either inherited\nfrom the Soviet era or consists of new laws modeled on earlier Soviet legislation and standards.\nThe systems are also decentralized with local authorities playing a key role in enforcing legislation.\nThis arrangement, too, is reminiscent of the Soviet approach when the oblast and city environmental\nprotection departments fulfilled similar tasks. Standards and emission limits are set in terms of\nthe MPCs for each pollutant, with the methods of determining these limits closely following the\nearlier Soviet techniques. Finally, enterprises are obligated to monitor their own emissions and\nreport the results to regulators. Inspections by state and/or local authorities are another essential\npart of this reporting procedure. Fines and other penalties can be imposed, though these can vary\nfrom one oblast to another.\nFrom this description it is clear that the standards and emission limits employed in the\nSoviet era, known as GOST, are an integral part of the air management system.9 The continued\nreliance on GOST has several drawbacks. These criteria are sometimes less strict than those\nemployed in the European Union (EU) or in the United States and have not been updated since\nSoviet times. Nor are they comparable with internationally adopted guidelines and generally\naccepted limits such as those advocated by WHO.10\nThe large number of MPCs that have been officially adopted is another source of problems.\nIn Kazakhstan, about 1500 pollutants are included in the air management system, though it is\npossible to monitor only a few. Similarly, Uzbekistan\u2019s legal framework identifies 457 harmful\nsubstances but the statistical coverage is again incomplete.11 The capabilities of the region\u2019s air\nmanagement systems are easily overwhelmed and there is a need for some rationalization. This\nwould require that a reduced number of pollutants be assigned a high priority and that the means\nfor proper monitoring must be ensured. Modernization of the systems is also urgent. The GOST\nstandards and emissions limits have not been updated and therefore do not reflect the requirements\nand technologies currently in use in major polluting industries such as transport and energy.\n 9 GOST was the main organization involved in the development and approval of standards in the former Soviet\nUnion.\n10 Comparisons between GOST and the standards adopted by WHO or the EU are complicated because the MPCs\nused in the Soviet system are not set on an annual basis.\n11 Uzbekistan does carry out a special series of inspections each year, measuring the concentration of air pollutants\nin 136 settlements around the country. However, only four to 39 different pollutants are measured, depending\nupon the nearby industrial facilities.\n15", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nTable 8.

Other approaches could reduce the inspection\nburden (which is substantial) and prove to be a more effective means of ensuring that the best\navailable technologies will be adopted (see Box 3). Yet another weakness of the current system\nof emission control is that firms may comply with the required MPC in ways that do not yield an\nactual reduction in emissions\u2014for example, by simply raising the smokestack or negotiating an\nextension to the diameter of the protective sanitary zone. Finally, many firms lack the equipment\nto monitor their own emissions and their use of air-source sampling is rare. The rough estimates\nthey make when reporting to authorities (often using emission factors based on energy and material\ninputs) raise many doubts about accuracy and place a greater burden on statisticians.\nBox 3. Setting Emission Limits in Kazakhstan\nEmission limits for each stationary source are determined according to methods inherited\nfrom the Soviet era. The procedure relies mainly on inspections. Limits are set on a case-by-\ncase basis according to MPCs and dispersion models that were also adapted from the Soviet\nperiod. One drawback is that MPCs exist for about 1,500 substances. Some are more stringent\nthan WHO guidelines but enforcement can be lax, even if the limits are exceeded for long periods\nof time. Moreover, only few of the 1,500 pollutants are actually monitored. Another weakness\nis that the procedure can be very time-consuming, requiring that local authorities evaluate the\ntechnical properties of each individual enterprise. Finally, emission permits must be issued every\nyear and fees vary from one oblast to another.\nIn contrast, most western countries determine emission limits on the basis of the\ntechnology in use. This approach encourages use of the best available technologies, which are\ngenerally cleaner as well as more efficient than alternatives. Uniform emission fees are generally\nset for the whole country, although local authorities usually have the option of reducing fees if\nthe firm is willing to invest in cleaner technologies or abatement techniques. Finally, the western\napproach provides a transparent set of conditions for potential investors.\nThe development of completely satisfactory systems of air management may still be some\nyears off but at least some steps to modernize and rationalize existing systems are needed now.\nEven this intermediate move will have significant repercussions for environment statisticians,\ninvolving numerous improvements in monitoring practices, estimation methods, and other\nprocedures.\n17", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nIII. WATER RESOURCES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nConcerns about the quality and availability of water have a long history in Central Asia.\nBoth problems are man-made to a large extent. During the Soviet era, many heavy industries\nwere established in the region. This subsector eventually became as large as that in many\nindustrialized countries, but without the equivalent environmental safeguards and controls. As\na result, large amounts of hazardous material were released into the environment, leaving\ngroundwater and major rivers heavily polluted. Water shortages can be attributed in part to the\nambitious schemes for development of the agricultural sector. This section examines latest data\non water quantity and quality; the monitoring networks and statistical systems that support water\nmanagement in the region; and  issues on water supply that are at the heart of transborder disputes.\nA. Water Supply\nAn idea of how water resources are distributed around the region is found in Table 9. The\npercentage of the population with access to improved water sources is greater than in most other\ndeveloping countries (with the exception of Tajikistan). Mongolia has the largest per capita resources\nbut this figure is misleading since 95 percent of all surface water flows out of the country. At the\nother end of the spectrum is Uzbekistan with freshwater resources that are only 5-7 percent of\nthose in neighboring countries. Uzbekistan\u2019s water shortages are underlined by the fact that\nwithdrawals are several times greater than its total water resources.12 Finally, the pivotal role\nof irrigation is apparent in the data for agricultural withdrawals. This use accounts for a\ndisproportionate share of all freshwater withdrawals in all countries except Mongolia.\nTable 9. Water Supply and Uses by Country, 2000\nAccess to Improved Water Sources Freshwater Total Agricultural\nResources Freshwater Withdrawal\nTotal Urban Rural per Withdrawals (percent of\nPopulation Population Population Capita (percent of total\n(percent) (percent) (percent) (in m3) total water freshwater\nresources) withdrawal)\nKazakhstan 91 98 82 7342 30.7 81\nKyrgyzstan 77 98 66 9559 21.7 94\nMongolia 60 77 30 14632 1.2 53\nTajikistan 53a 90a 20a 12763 14.9 92\nUzbekistan 85 96 78 668 356.1 94\nNote: a 1994.\nSource: Kazakhstan Agency on Statistics (2001); Kyrgyz Republic National Statistical Committee (2001); State\nCommittee on Statistics of the Republic of Tajikistan (2001); State Department of Statistics (2002).\n12 The low figure for Mongolia (1.2 percent) is again misleading since such a large portion of all freshwater resources\nflow out of the country.\n18", "Section III\nWater Resources and Information Systems\nMore details with regard to the water systems of each country are found in Table 10. First,\nthe distribution of water resources within each country is highly uneven with some areas subject\nto severe water constraints. Second, the effects of shortages are compounded by the poor quality\nof water in some parts of each country. Water quality in these areas is generally unsuitable for\nhuman consumption or irrigation (see Box 4). Third, because surface water is the primary source\nof supply, each country\u2019s network of rivers plays a critical role. The transborder character of all\nwater systems means that existing agreements on water allocation are a critical determinant of\nsupplies.\nTable 10.

Water Quality\nData on water quality is generally inferior to that referring to water supplies. The main\nreason for this disparity is that water shortages are immediately recognizable and tend to receive\nhigh priority in any statistical program. Problems of water quality are not so readily apparent\nand generally receive less emphasis. The consequences of this distinction are probably accentuated\nby other statistical shortcomings discussed later in this section. Thus, any assessment of water\nquality in Central Asia must necessarily be tentative and less than complete.\n20", "Section III\nWater Resources and Information Systems\nBox 4. Water Quality and Quantity in Specific Provinces and Communities\nThe availability of drinking water is an especially serious issue in Mongolia. Supplies are\nlimited even in Ulaanbaatar and other urban centers but the problem is most acute for the ger\ncommunity, which receives only about 10 liters per day/person. This amount is far below the\nsuggested requirements for refugee camps (16 liters per day/person). In Kyrgyzstan, nearly 600\nvillages with more than 700,000 inhabitants 22 percent of the rural population\u2014have no access\nto piped water. Over half these villages are in the Osh region where there are no shallow\nunderground water sources. As a result, these communities rely on untreated surface water,\nincluding that from irrigation canals. Tests of tap water conducted in Kazakhstan in 1999\nshowed that in one province (East Kazakhstan) 47 percent of samples exceeded microbiological\nstandards. In three other provinces, 20-26 percent of all samples did not meet chemical\nstandards. A similar round of tests was conducted in Uzbekistan in 2000. Microbiological\nstandards were breached on average by 10-14 percent of all samples in most provinces, and in\none month 69 percent of the samples for one province were unsatisfactory. In the same series\nof tests, chemical quality standards were breached by 70 percent of the samples in the Uzbek\nprovince of Karakalpakstan. More generally, over 30 percent of the population drink and use\nwater that does not meet national and international quality standards.\nSome of the available evidence is found in Table 11. Based on this information, problems\nof water quality appear to be most severe in Uzbekistan and least serious in Kyrgyzstan. In general,\nCentral Asia\u2019s problems of water quality are perhaps more acute than those faced in most other\ndeveloping countries outside Africa.\nA more general assessment is given in the second column of Table 11. Water quality varies\nsignificantly within each country. Not surprisingly, problems are most serious for consumers in\nsmall towns and rural areas. The quality of water in urban areas (especially the largest cities)\nis somewhat better. Groundwater is heavily polluted in some countries and several large rivers\nin the region are known to be extremely polluted.\nDuring the 1990s, the incidence of water-related diseases was also increasing in most\ncountries. Such a trend is an ominous one, suggesting that water quality may actually be\ndeteriorating over time.\nAt least one important reason for the poor quality of water is indicated in the third column\nof Table 11. The water treatment plants currently in operation throughout the region are obsolete\nand poorly maintained. In fact, many do not function and others can no longer meet national\nstandards. In some of the worse cases, countries report that no more than a third of all existing\ntreatment plants are capable of operating on a regular basis and that funds for maintenance have\nnot been provided for more than ten years.\nThe broader consequences of a long-term deterioration in water quality should not be\nunderestimated. Figure 1 shows disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to air pollution and\nwater and sanitation in several countries. Central Asian countries especially Tajikistan,\n21", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan pay a very heavy price owing to a lack of clean drinking water\nand urban sanitation. Within the region, the health burden inflicted by water-related problems\nis probably greater than that attributed to air pollution.\nC. Monitoring Operations and Statistical Systems\nThe statistical systems in each country are remarkably elaborate, and to simplify the\ndiscussion, three crucial characteristics are singled out for attention here. They include:\n(i) division of statistical responsibilities among various institutions,\n(ii) extent of monitoring operations, and\n(iii) related statistical procedures.\nTable 11.

The table indicates which institutions regulate\nand monitor water resources and provides a brief description of their tasks.13 The network of\ninstitutional links in each country is surprisingly complex, particularly in view of the rather modest\nscope of each program. Such an intricate (and somewhat unrealistic) division of labor creates\norganizational problems for statisticians. For example, it becomes very difficult to agree on a\nstatistical strategy that will meet users\u2019 needs and government priorities. Moreover, even if such\na strategy could be agreed, it would probably not be possible to organize the data in a way that\nwould yield a satisfactory information system. The existing responsibilities for water statistics and\ninformation systems are simply too widely dispersed among ministries and their functions overlap\n(see Box 5).\nFigure 1.

Insufficient information was available to\ndraw up a similar list of institutions in Mongolia or Tajikistan.\n24", "Section III\nWater Resources and Information Systems\nThe lack of any clear-cut statistical plan may simply reflect the fact that policymakers have\nyet to devise an overall strategy for dealing with water resources and have not clearly specified\ntheir own priorities. But in any case, the absence of a more coherent approach is hard to justify\nin a period of financial stringency when there is an urgent need to reduce duplication and bolster\nefficiency.\nBox 5. Water Monitoring Systems in Kyrgyzstan\nResponsibilities for monitoring are spread across a number of institutions. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s\nState Agency for Meteorology (Hydromet) in the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP)\nmonitors the quantity and quality surface water. In 1991, Hydromet operated a nationwide\nnetwork of about 180 stations and relied on two laboratories to test samples using traditional\nwet chemistry. Today, it monitors only on the Chu River and conducts occasional tests of Lake\nIssyk-Kul following an accidental discharge of cyanides in 1998. The State Committee for\nGeology and Mineral Resources, also in the MEP, monitors groundwater quality and quantity but\nits activities have been scaled back since 1995 (see Table 10). The Ministry of Health monitors\nthe quality of drinking water. The Environmental Monitoring Department of the MEP monitors\nthe purification performances of municipal waste-water treatment plants and major industrial\nenterprises. The Department has an office and laboratory in each oblast. Its inspectors are\nresponsible for enforcing 1,200 water standards, although the laboratories can test for only 20.\nThe data accumulated by the Department is neither processed nor transmitted to others, being\nused only for inspection purposes. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources monitors the\nquantity and quality of groundwater and surface water in irrigated areas; it tracks the release\nof pesticides, fertilizers, and minerals; and is responsible for a number of trans-border issues.\nLicenses for water abstraction are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources,\nwhile the MEP grants permits for water discharges and collects fines and fees for these\ndischarges. In 1998, a compulsory reporting system for all water users and dischargers (public\nand private) was introduced. Emitters must conduct their own monitoring operations within 500\nmeters of the point of discharge. The results of self-monitoring are to be checked regularly by\nthe central inspection laboratory of the MEP, but that procedure has been interrupted owing to\na lack of funds.\nThere is no evidence that these overlapping responsibilities are a source of major problems,\nbut a simpler organization would probably produce more efficient results in this period of fi-\nnancial stringency. The present division of labor also makes it very difficult to implement an\nintegrated strategy for water monitoring or to construct an information system for water re-\nsources that would be demand-driven and adequately reflect the government\u2019s priorities.\nTable 12 describes the monitoring networks in four of the five countries and notes several\nstatistical deficiencies. Monitoring activities were drastically scaled back during the first half of\nthe 1990s and there is no evidence that the downward trend has been reversed in recent years.\nMuch of the equipment in use today is obsolete and poorly maintained, and a number of laboratories\nhave either been closed or no longer have the ability to conduct the required analysis. At the same\ntime, the scope of data collection has been reduced. Drinking water and large portions of national\n25", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nwater systems are no longer monitored in some areas, groundwater is rarely monitored (even though\nthe use of these supplies is growing), and the frequency of sampling has been curtailed.\nThe ability of governments to enforce regulations has also been seriously diminished. Most\ncountries require emitters to monitor their own discharges. However, the number of inspections\nperformed by the government has declined and some laboratories can no longer evaluate the results\ncollected by enterprises. Meanwhile, the equipment and procedures used to monitor self emissions\nis just as antiquated as that used by government agencies.\nProblems are no less acute when attention turns to methods and statistical procedures.\nFor example, the data collected is seldom dispersed to other government bodies or even processed\nby the collector. The use of MPCs and dispersion models introduced during the Soviet era is still\ncommon practice, but these tools are not appropriate today. Collection procedures have also become\nhaphazard, jeopardizing the spatial and temporal comparability of results, even between different\nregions in the same country.\nNot surprisingly, current programs are riddled with data gaps. Quality is not monitored\nin some cities where a large portion of the population depends on untreated drinking water. Most\nof the data being collected apparently refers to point sources of pollution while little information\nexists on pollution from diffuse sources. Only a limited amount of data is compiled on waste-water\ndischarges (either by emitters or the government) and concerns about the accuracy and reliability\nof the available statistics apply to all countries.\nIn general, none of the five countries have a statistical program that can support the work\nof policy makers or allow for the systematic analysis of water resources. An overall strategy for\nwater statistics in each country is clearly needed, including the creation of information systems\nthat will integrate all the disparate parts. This step, however, will not be effective unless it is\naccompanied by a series of other improvements, many of them at local and provincial level. The\nspatial coverage of monitoring operations is too limited and must be expanded, although the number\nof topics and indicators that are considered could be reduced in some instances. The quality of\nthe data to be processed is also insufficient and improvements in statistical methods will be essential.\nD. Transborder Issues\nSeveral thousand rivers run through two or more of the five countries included in this\nstudy. With such an intricate system, disagreements can be expected in times of scarcity, but the\nexisting schemes of water allocation are a source of additional disputes. These agreements\u2014which\nwere drawn up in Soviet times\u2014are not compatible with today\u2019s political and economic realities.\nDuring the Soviet period, intensive, large-scale farming operations were launched. They are\nsupported by an extensive system of water infrastructure, including extensive irrigation facilities\nand a series of reservoirs and dams. Today, the water needs of agriculture account for 80-95 percent\nannual freshwater withdrawals in all countries but Mongolia (see Table 9). Little water remains\nto meet the requirements of emerging industries, to satisfy the demands of a population that is\nincreasingly concerned with matters of health and sanitation, or to generate hydroelectric power.\n26", "Section III\nWater Resources and Information Systems\nTable 12.

The major tributaries are the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers, which\nbegin in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan respectively. The agreement on water sharing in the Basin\npits the countries that are upstream (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) against those located downstream\n(Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan).14 The upstream countries are poor in energy\nresources and wish to use their water for hydroelectricity generation when heating needs are\ngreatest. As a result, the two countries prefer to release water through their dams in the winter.\nIn contrast, the downstream countries require huge amounts of water for irrigation during the\nvegetation period in the summer.\nAnother contentious issue is the quality of water once it reaches the downstream countries.\nIn the mountainous areas upstream, the water is virtually free from pollution. But in the middle\nand lower reaches of the Aral Basin, both the Amu-Darya and the Syr-Darya are heavily polluted,\nbreaching MACs for hardness, sulfates, chlorides, phenol, and silicon. The rivers are also heavily\nmineralized in this stretch, with a salt content ranging from 1-2 grams per liter. A third source\nof dispute is that the water agreements assign responsibility for maintaining the reservoirs and\ndams to the country where these facilities are located. The upstream countries (mainly Kyrgyzstan)\nbear almost all this financial burden and argue that the agreements do not provide fair compensation\nfrom the water users located downstream.\nFinally, the plight of the Aral Sea and the surrounding coastal areas can be largely\nattributed to the ambitious schemes for irrigation and farming that were introduced after 1960,\nalong with the supporting transborder agreements for water allocation. The ECE describes the\nAral Sea crisis as \u201cone of the biggest environmental and human catastrophes in recorded history\u201d,\naffecting about 35 million people living in the Basin (see ECE 2001, chapter 4). In order to produce\ncash crops such as cotton and rice, massive irrigation systems were constructed. Since 1960, the\ntotal irrigated area in the Aral Sea Basin has increased from 3 million to 8 million hectares and\nthe use of mineral fertilizers has risen between three fold 3 and six fold. Meanwhile, a series of\ncanals and dams was built which greatly reduce the two rivers\u2019 discharges into the Aral Sea. Before\n1960, average annual discharges varied between 50 to 60 km3. The volume of discharges fell to\n20-30 km3 a year during 1960-1980 and averaged only 5 km3 water per year in the 1990s. There\nhave also been years in which practically no water has reached the Aral Sea.\nThe severity of problems involving both the quantity and quality of water in the Aral Sea\nBasin cannot be overemphasized. Disagreements between the neighboring countries have become\nmore frequent and acrimonious since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Numerous regional\nagreements on transboundary watercourses are in place, but their focus is on the quantity of water\navailable and the amounts allocated to each country.

The\namount of available relevant data is extremely limited and subject to all the qualifications noted\npreviously in this section. One of the main reasons for the lack of empirical evidence is that\ngovernments have apparently been unable to agree on a system of joint monitoring, the need\nfor joint control over polluting activities, or even a common statistical methodology for determining\nthe natural background concentration of pollutants in watercourses that cross national\nboundaries.15 The information to be derived from such activities would be essential in developing\nan overall strategy for management of transboundary watercourses.\nIV. HIGHLIGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nCentral Asia\u2019s economic misfortunes have had a dramatic impact on the region\u2019s environment\nand seriously undermined its statistical capabilities. The five countries included in this study have\nonly recently emerged from one of the most serious economic depressions in modern times. Even\ntoday, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the worst-hit economies is still 30-40 percent below\nlevels recorded in 1990.\nData on air pollution in the region reveals a mixed set of long-term trends. The volume\nof aerial emissions fell in the first half of the 1990s in all countries and in many of the region\u2019s\nlarger cities. In later years, the level has stabilized or risen slightly. These trends closely track\nchanges in the macroeconomic situation. The recent increase in air emissions is not pronounced,\nbut the upward trend has some worrying implications. In other parts of the world, for example,\nlong-term changes in economic structure have usually led to a fall in aerial emissions as new and\ncleaner types of industries have displaced older, dirtier operations. The economies of Central Asia\nhave undergone some drastic structural changes since 1990, but the indicators examined in this\npaper reveal no similar pattern of adjustment in patterns of air pollution.\nThere are several pieces of evidence that support this conclusion. First, there has been\nno change in the relative importance of specific pollutants over time. Such a result would be expected\nas economies modernize and the composition of output evolves. In Central Asia, however, the\nmaterials that account for the bulk of aerial emission today are the same as in the late 1980s.\nSecond, the data do not suggest any change in the historical relationship between rates of economic\ngrowth and emission levels. This result differs from the experience of other countries, including\n15 A number of regional groups, committees and funds are working to improve the Aral Sea Basin\u2019s environment.\nTheir goals include: rehabilitation of disaster zones, improvements in the management of scarce water resources,\nand contributions to related activities involving planning and implementation of new programs. Much of this\nwork, however, must be carried on without an adequate statistical base.\n31", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nmost of ex-Soviet economies in East and Central Europe. In those countries, the OECD observed\na \u201cdecoupling\u201d between the two variables in the years since independence.16\nData on the spatial distribution of air pollution indicates some reduction in the volume\nof aerial emissions since 1990. Indexes of air quality in almost all major cities and provinces (oblasts)\nsuggest that the air is somewhat cleaner than it was ten years ago. Emission levels, however,\nare still well above permissible limits in many cases. In fact, the air pollution indexes for some\ncities have consistently exceeded the acceptable maximum during the past decade, even though\npollution levels have gradually been falling.\nThe general impression that emerges from this review is that reductions in air pollution\nare predominately due to the economic contraction during the first half of the 1990s and the\nweakness of the recovery in subsequent years. Several reasons are offered for this rather\ndiscouraging conclusion. First, most of the enterprises that have continued to operate rely on obsolete\nproduction technologies and equipment that is poorly maintained. Second, a large number of\nhouseholds and industrial enterprises have reverted to the use of solid fuels of local origin with\na high caloric value and sulfur content. Third, the air pollution abatement technologies found\nin many enterprises are antiquated and inefficient or are not used at all. Finally, new investment\nremains at a very low level throughout the region. The shortage of capital denies enterprises access\nto new production technologies that are generally not only more efficient but also cleaner.\nThe economic depression may have temporarily halted the rise in aerial emissions, but at\nthe same time it has weakened statisticians\u2019 ability to measure pollution and track changes in\nair quality. Some of the more important shortcomings that are noted in this paper are the following:\n(i) The number of stations used to monitor air quality has been significantly reduced,\nand in some countries now represents no more than a token effort. In several\ninstances, countries have also been forced to discontinue parts of their monitoring\nprograms and to reduce the number of observations per station.\n(ii) The sampling procedures used in several countries are questionable. Only a few\nobservations may be used to compute annual values and primary data from stations\noperating in widely disparate conditions is sometimes combined.\n(iii) None of the five countries are able to collect sufficient data on mobile sources of\npollution.\n(iv) The legal framework for the statistical programs is inherited from the Soviet era.\nStandards and emission limits are determined on the basis of Soviet methods that\nare out of data and do not reflect current technologies.\n(v) The number of pollutants that are officially included in some monitoring programs\nis too large. With such limited facilities, it is possible to monitor only a few pollutants\nand programs should be rationalized.\n16 Decoupling is defined to occur when GDP is growing at a positive rate while the growth of the environmental\nvariable (for example, the volume of emissions of a particular pollutant) increases at a slower pace or even declines.\n32", "Section IV\nHighlights and Conclusions\nClearly, the quality and coverage of the region\u2019s air statistics is poor and has deteriorated\nfurther in recent years. Nor is the data sufficiently reliable or comprehensive to be of much use\nto policymakers. In some areas, the air quality already poses serious threats to public health and\nthe situation could quickly deteriorate if the economic recovery in the region continues. In their\npresent state, the statistical systems around the region are ill equipped to cope with this prospect.\nThere are clear differences in the long-term trends for air and water pollution in the region.\nWhile air pollution declined in the 1990s, problems relating to water resources are proving to be\nmuch more permanent\u2014and probably more serious. Water quality is often unsuitable, either for\nhuman consumption or irrigation. Water shortages are equally acute, and made worse because\nthe distribution of water resources in each country is highly uneven.\nThe statistics collected on water quality are not adequate to track long-term changes. Nor\nare they sufficiently comprehensive to measure variations in quality in large water bodies.\nHowever, the available piecemeal information gives no reasons for complacency. In some of the\nregion\u2019s major river systems, the contamination of surface water along long stretches is found to\nbe several hundred times greater than the permissible limits. In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,\nportions of several rivers are extremely polluted with mercury, oil, heavy metals, fluorine, pesticides,\nradioactive contamination, and other toxic substances. About two fifths of the population in\nTajikistan presently relies on untreated water taken directly from rivers, canals and irrigation\nditches. Groundwater is also heavily polluted in many locations (particularly in parts of Kazakhstan\nand Uzbekistan). As much as 40 percent of all fresh groundwater is unsuitable for drinking in\nsome oblasts and the percentage has been rising since the mid-1990s. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s\ndependence on underground water sources is growing.\nThere is indirect evidence suggesting that the region pays a heavy price for the deterioration\nin water quality. For example, the incidence of water-borne diseases such as malaria, acute intestinal\ninfection, and bacterial dysentery is on the rise in several countries. According to other data presented\nin this study, the health burden inflicted by water-related problems is several times greater than\nthat attributed to air pollution for most countries in Central Asia.\nOne reason for the poor quality is that many water-treatment systems are near collapse.\nA significant number are no longer operational and others cannot meet government standards.\nThe problem is largely due to a lack of funds. In the worst case, water treatment systems have\napparently received no funds for maintenance or repair in more than ten years. The situation\nis no better for sewage systems is certain countries.\nProblems of water supply are closely linked to regional agreements on water allocation\nand are the focus of a continuing dispute between neighboring countries. These schemes for water\nallocation\u2014which were drawn up in Soviet times\u2014are no longer compatible with today\u2019s political\nand economic realities. They were part of a grander plan that included large-scale farming\noperations, an extensive system of irrigation facilities, and a series of reservoirs and dams.\nSince 1960, the total irrigated area in the Aral Sea Basin has increased from 3 million\nto 8 million hectares and the application of mineral fertilizers has risen between three and six\nfold. The consequences have been well documented in other studies. The Aral Sea crisis is estimated\nto affect about 35 million people living in the Basin. By the 1990s, the average annual volume\n33", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nof discharges into the Aral Sea had decreased to just 5 km3, compared with 50-60 km3 per year\nin the early 1960s. The long-term decline in discharges is a result of the huge amounts of withdrawals\nthat occur as the rivers make their way to the Aral Sea. Almost all these withdrawals are to feed\nirrigation systems in the Aral Basin. In fact, agriculture now accounts for 80-95 percent annual\nfreshwater withdrawals in all countries but Mongolia. Very little water remains for other users\nincluding industry, households, and hydroelectric power.\nIssues pertaining to problems of water quality and supply must rank high on the\npolicymakers\u2019 agenda. However, the statistical systems that are meant to supply these officials\nwith the information required to properly managed water resources are woefully inadequate. Some\nof the more critical shortcomings include the following:\n(i) Monitoring operations on long stretches of national water systems have been\ndiscontinued, groundwater is rarely monitored, and the frequency of sampling has\nbeen curtailed.\n(ii) Countries still employ the same standards, dispersion models, and statistical\nmethodologies that were used during the Soviet era. These tools are no longer\nappropriate and their use casts doubts on the reliability of the data.\n(iii) Collection procedures have become haphazard, jeopardizing the spatial and temporal\ncomparability of results, even between different regions in the same country.\n(iv) A significant portion of the data that is still being collected by monitoring stations\nis neither processed nor exchanged with other institutions. This information is rarely\nfor decision-making purposes.\n(v) Existing regional agreements on transboundary watercourses focus almost\nexclusively on water supplies and the amounts allocated to each country. Cooperation\non matters relating to the quality of water in shared watercourses has made little\nprogress. Governments have apparently been unable to agree on the need for joint\nmonitoring of shared watercourses, the importance of joint control over polluting\nactivities, or even a common methodology for determining the natural background\nconcentration of pollutants in watercourses crossing national boundaries.\n(vi) There have been few attempts to introduce policies that encourage water\nconservation, although there is much scope for improvement here. Existing\nprocedures for inspection and enforcement would not be equal to this task in any\ncase.\n(vii) The division of labor between institutions working in the field of water resources\nis unnecessarily complex with overlapping responsibilities. These circumstances make\nit difficult to formulate an efficient statistical strategy and hinder the development\nof comprehensive information systems to serve the needs of regulators and\npolicymakers.\n34", "Section IV\nHighlights and Conclusions\nIn conclusion, water shortages and problems of water quality have reached a very serious\nstate for most of the countries in this study. At the same time, the region\u2019s statistical systems are\nin disrepair and generally unable to produce the information that policymakers need if they are\nto address these problems. Without remedial action, water problems will worsen, jeopardizing public\nhealth and undermining the region\u2019s incipient economic recovery.\n35", "ERD Working Paper No. 36\nENVIRONMENT STATISTICS IN CENTRAL ASIA: PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS\nAppendix\nTable A1.
