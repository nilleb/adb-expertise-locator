 and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  have  always  played  a  marginal  role  in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s economy due to the economy\u2019s reliance on oil and this sector\u2019s being under \nthe influence of large entrepreneurs. According to statistical data for 2016, the share of \nSMEs in value added in the economy was 6.4% while that in total production output in \nthe economy and employment, respectively, was 9.2% and 18.5%.  \n\nThe problem regarding SME access to finance in Azerbaijan is urgent. The devaluation \nof the Azerbaijan manat in 2015 has become one of the determining factors impacting \nthe  country\u2019s  financial  system.  The  deterioration  of  the  currency  exposure  due  to  the \nsharp devaluation and a significant increase in problem loans have presented serious \nchallenges to the banking sector. The reduced resource potential of the bank sector is \none of the key factors curbing SME access to finance. At the same time, capital market \nin Azerbaijan does not serve as a source of funding for SMEs. Factors that hamper SMEs \nin accessing finance are high interest rates for all business, heavy lending terms, and \nlack of lending institutions\u2019 interest in providing finance to regions. \n\nThe  importance  of  increasing  financial  inclusivity  and  financial  literacy  has  recently \nbecome urgent in Azerbaijan. The levels of accessibility for the country\u2019s population and \nentrepreneurs,  including  SMEs,  to  services  offered  by  financial  institutions  are  not \ndesirable. The existing strategies to enhance financial literacy and financial inclusivity \nare defined by the \u201cPrimary Directions of Strategic Roadmaps for National Economy and \nMain  Sectors  of  Economy\u201d  adopted  in  2016.  Ensuring  SMEs  effective  and  favorable \naccess to finance has been included in core strategic targets in the Roadmaps.  \n\nSince there is no official statistical database on SME finance, it is difficult to define the \ndistribution of lending by value chains. The survey conducted among the banks holding \n50% of the market share found that they are more interested in financing trade or the \nfood service sector, which is the final stage of a product or service. A small proportion of \nlending institutions prefer agriculture financing. One of the key global value chain areas \nthe  Azerbaijani  economy  participates  in  is  the  agrarian  sector.  The  non-oil  sectors \ndominated by SMEs are trade and agriculture. The agricultural sector contributes to the \ncreation  of  a  value  chain  across  the  country  through  various  crops  and  livestock \nproducts.  The  government\u2019s  recent  legislative  and  institutional  initiatives  are  aimed  at \nensuring SME finance. \n\n1.  THE ROLE OF SMES IN THE ECONOMY  \n\nAND SME FINANCE \n\n1.1  Breakdown of Azerbaijan\u2019s Economy (Shares of GDP  \nand Employment) and Growth Performance by Sector \n(Agriculture, Manufacturing, Services) \n\nAzerbaijan has passed through different stages of economic development for the past \n27 years, since it regained independence in 1991. Although the first post-Soviet decade \n(1991\u22122001) was marked by both crisis and stability situations, the country experienced \nrapid economic growth in subsequent years. From 2005 onwards in particular, an inflow \nof large oil revenues to the country under production sharing agreements (PSAs), signed \nwith  foreign  oil  majors  in  the  previous  10  years,  had  served  as  a  major  catalyst  for \neconomic development. \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nAzerbaijan had an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 of AZN70.1 billion \n(USD41 billion). \n\nFigure 1: Azerbaijan GDP Growth Rate Over Previous Year (%) \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic. \n\n \n\nThe  first  years,  when  the  government  generated  much  higher  revenues,  saw  a  more \nrapid growth rate, with GDP growth having ranged from 26.4% in 2005 to 34.5% in 2016 \nrelative to the previous period. The economy, though at a lower rate, continued to grow \nduring the period prior to the global oil price drop towards the end of 2014, with real GDP \ngrowth ranging from 0.1% in 2011 to 5.8% in 2013. However, the economic growth rate \nhas declined significantly, driven by lower oil prices in the past three years.  \n\nAnalysis  of  statistical  data  found  that  the  share  of  the  hydrocarbon  sector  in  GDP \nformation now stands at roughly 35%. Although the industrial sector, as a whole, has the \nhighest  share  in  GDP  formation  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  (40%  for  2017),  the  entire \nindustry  accounts  for  only  8.5%  of  total  employment.  Nevertheless,  all  service  fields \n(trade, tourism and restaurant, all types of social and household services, transport and \ncommunication services, government services) in total account for the dominant share \n(about 44%) of GDP formation. \n\nAlthough the agriculture sector has a very high specific weight (36.3%) in employment, \nonly 5.6% of the economy\u2019s GDP is generated through this sector. \n\nAs  a  whole,  because  of  the  severe  imbalance  between  this  sector\u2019s  employment  and \nvalue  added,  overall  labor  productivity  in  the  agriculture  sector  is  extremely  low.  At \npresent,  agricultural  value  added  per  worker  is  about  25  times  less  than  that  in  the  \nnon-agricultural sector. The construction sector accounts for 9.5% of GDP and 7.2% of \nemployment. In 2017, about 4.8 million people (50%) were employed.  \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nFigure 2: Share of the Main Sectors of the Economy in GDP Formation \nand Employment Generation (as percentage of total)1 \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic. \n\n \n\n1.2  Role of SMEs in the Economy by Sector  \n\n(GDP and Employment Shares) \n\nthese  SMEs,  20.9 \n\nThe  role  of  SMEs  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy,  notably  in  its  expansion  in  recent  years,  \nis too insignificant. In 2016, SMEs, which numbered 191.7 thousand, accounted for 95% \nlegal  entities  and  \nof  all  businesses.  Of \n170.8  thousand  were  individual  entrepreneurs.  Small  entrepreneurs  dominate  in  \nthe  overall  number  of  SMEs  in  Azerbaijan,  while  the  number  of  medium-sized \nentrepreneurs is moderate. Small entrepreneurs account for the bulk of SMEs\u201497.9% \n(187.6 thousand)\u2014with medium entrepreneurs reaching 2.1% (4.1 thousand). According \nto the Cabinet of Ministers decision dated 5 June 2015, small enterprises in Azerbaijan \nare  defined  as \nrevenue  \nof  less  than  200  thousand  manats,  and  medium  enterprises  as  those  with  less  than  \n125 employees and annual revenue of less than 1.250 million manats.2  \n\nthan  25  employees  and  annual \n\nthousand  were \n\nthose  with \n\nless \n\nHowever,  the  position  of  SMEs  in  the  economy  does  not  reflect\u2019the  share  of  their \nbusiness units.3  \n\nAccording to statistical data for 2016, the share of SMEs in value added in the economy \nwas  6.4%  while  that  in  total  production  output  in  the  economy  and  employment, \nrespectively,  was  9.2%  and  18.5%. \nthe  data  by  sectors  \nof  the  economy,  SMEs  primarily  continue  to  provide  the  dominant  share  of  the  \nservices sector.  \n\nIf  we  consider \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   All data taken from Azerbaijan\u2019s State Statistical Committee national accounts. https://www.stat.gov.az/ \n\nsource/system_nat_accounts/ and labor market https://www.stat.gov.az/source/labour/ databases.  \n\n2   http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/30115.  \n3   https://www.stat.gov.az/source/entrepreneurship/. \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nFigure 3: Number of SMEs in Major Economic Indicators (%) \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic. \n\n \n\nThe  share  of  SMEs  in  trade,  transport,  communications,  construction,  industry,  and \nagriculture, respectively, comprises 62.8%, 15.8%, 13.1%, 2.3%, 1.3%, and 1.1%. \n\nFigure 4: Share of SMEs in Product Output and Turnover of Services by Sector4 \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic. \n\n \n\nThere are no official data for the share of SMEs in the country\u2019s total exports, which is \none  of  the  important  economic  indicators.  However,  our  assessment  based  on  the \nanalysis of data on the export structure shows that the actual indicator does not exceed \n5\u22126%.  In  2017,  Azerbaijan\u2019s  total  exports  stood  at  $13.8  billion,  of  which  89%,  or  \n$12.3 billion, came from the oil and gas sectors. SMEs are totally excluded from oil and \ngas exports. Therefore, the assessment was carried out on the basis of non-oil export \nfor  Analysis  of  Economic  Reforms  and \nindicators.  According \n\nthe  Center \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4   Data taken from the Azerbaijan\u2019s State Statistical Committee Business Division: https://www.stat.gov.az/ \n\nsource/entrepreneurship/. \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nCommunication (CAERC) under the President of Azerbaijan Republic, out of the total \nnon-oil  exports  of  $1.54  billion  in  2017,  $821.3  million,  or  53%,  fell  to  the  share  \nof 20 large state- or private-sector subjects of entrepreneurial activity. The remainder of \nexports worth $712.7 million was provided by other SMEs, accounting for only 5% of the \ncountry\u2019s total exports.5  \n\n1.3  Country\u2019s Sources of Finance for SMEs \n\nThe impact of macro-economic conditions to ensure SMEs access to financial resources \nis  conditioned  by  the  quality  of  the  financing  structure.  Preserving  the  stability  of  the \nnational currency, the Azerbaijan manat exchange rate for more than a decade, and its \ndevaluation  by  more  than  50%  in  2015,  has  become  one  of  the  determining  factors \nimpacting the country\u2019s financial system over the last three years. The deterioration of \nthe currency exposure due to the sharp devaluation and a significant increase in problem \nloans presented serious challenges to the banking sector. This particularly contributed \nsubstantially to the decrease in the banking sector\u2019s assets and a worsening of the banks\u2019 \nfinancial performance. \n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s  bank  assets  decreased  by  about  AZN7  billion  (20%)  during  2015\u22122017, \nwhile  loans  declined  at  a  rate  of  50%  (AZN10  billion)  due  to  write-offs  of  \nnon-performing loans (NPLs) and the closure a third of the banks. At the same time, the \nratio  of  bank  assets  to  GDP  in  2015  and  2017  decreased  from  64.2  to  39.8%.  The \ndownward tendency of the share of loans in the structure of bank assets also remains \ndominant. This indicator stood at around 70% in 2013\u22122014, falling to 41.5% at the end \nof  2017.  The  reduced  resource  potential  of  the  bank  sector  is  one  of  the  key  factors \ncurbing SMEs\u2019 access to financing. Since the debt and securities market in Azerbaijan \ndo  not  serve  as  a  source  of  funding  for  SMEs,  the  banking  sector  is  a  sole  and \nindispensable  resource  for  them.  From  this  point  of  view,  negative  processes  in  the \nbanking sector have a direct impact on SMEs (Figure 5.) \n\nFigure 5: 2015\u22122017 Bank Assets (millions of manats)6 \n\nSource: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5   http://iqtisadiislahat.org/store//media/documents/ixrac_icmali/2018/yanvar/Export_Review_2018-1.pdf. \n6   Figure made on the basis of Central Bank and Financial Market Supervisory Authority data.  \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nAlthough the securities market in Azerbaijan has expanded significantly in recent years, \nthis segment of the financial market has no impact on SMEs, because their experience \nof attracting resources through various financial intermediaries and debt instruments has \nnot  yet  arisen  in  practice.  The  securities  market  mainly  trades  government  securities \n(short-term bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and short-term notes issued by the \nCentral Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan (CBAR) and partly corporate securities issued \nby  large  state-owned  companies  or  belonging  to  the  banking  sector.  In  2017,  for \nexample,  the  market  grew  12%,  compared  to  2016,  to  15.7  billion  manats.  The \ngovernment securities market increased from 836.2 million to 6.1 billion manats (+7.3 \ntimes),  and  the  derivative  financial  instruments  market  was  33.8%  up  to  5.9  billion \nmanats. The corporate securities market amounted to 3.7 billion manats. The corporate \nsecurities market accounted for 44% of shares and 56% of the bond segment. \n\n1.4  Key Aspects of Country\u2019s Financial Situation, Regulatory \nFramework, Tax Regimes and Financial Infrastructure \n\nThe heavy reliance of the economy on oil money is a key factor affecting the country\u2019s \nfinancial system. This dependence is crucial in ensuring both the stability-oriented fiscal \npolicy and balance of payments equilibrium. One of the lessons learned from the years \n2015\u22122016  is  that  due  to  its  dependence  on  oil  revenues,  it  is  becoming  difficult  to \nbalance  the  budget  with  the  sharp  decline  in  oil  prices  on  the  world  markets,  and \nalongside  the  growth  of  the  budget  deficit.  And  due  to  the  dependence  of  Azerbaijan \nexports on oil, it is also a challenge to ensure the balance of payments equilibrium with \nthe sharp decline in oil prices on the world markets. A decrease in currency revenues \nincreases the risk of macroeconomic instability in the country by creating a deficit in the \noverall balance of payments. \n\nSteps  have  been  taken  in  recent  years  towards  the  establishment  of  a  legal  basis  \nfor SMEs and the provision of an institutional environment in Azerbaijan. The key related \nlaws  governing  their  activities  are  the  Law  on  Entrepreneurship  and  the  Law  \non  State  Support  for  Small  Business.  The  latter  states  that  the  state  assists  small \nentrepreneurship  support,  the  development  of  small  entrepreneurship  programs  and \nimplementation of these programs, creating favorable conditions for small business to \nacquire financial, material, scientific, and technical information resources.7  \n\nThe  Law  on  Entrepreneurship  will  establish  principles  for  entrepreneurship  activities \nenvisaging  common  rights  and  obligations,  licenses  and  special  permits  for  all \nentrepreneurship subjects.8 \n\nIn  addition,  tax  and  customs  laws  will  establish  legal  provisions  that  regulate  the  tax \nregime  and  financial  reporting  for  SMEs.  The  Tax  Code  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic 9 \ncreates legal opportunities for SMEs to become simplified taxpayers. First, according to \nthe  Tax  Code,  agricultural  producers  and  industrial  agricultural  producers  are  exempt \nfrom  all  taxes,  except  for  land  tax.  According  to  official  statistics,  more  than  90%  of \nagricultural products is provided by natural entrepreneurs, small enterprises and family \nfarms  whose  turnovers  are  insignificant.  So,  it  is  SMEs  that  take  advantage  of  large-\nscale tax privileges in the agrarian sector, while non-agrarian SMEs are entitled to pay \nsimplified tax, which is a combination of several taxes. \n\n                                                 \n7   http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/3849. \n8   http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/7920. \n9   http://www.e-qanun.az/code/12. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nUnder Article 219.5 of the Tax Code, SMEs as legal entities paying simplified tax shall \nnot pay VAT, profit tax and property tax, and as individuals involved in entrepreneurial \nactivity  without  the  creation  of  a  legal  entity,  profit  tax  or  VAT  on  subject  activity. \nIndividual entrepreneurs who have received investment promotion documents and other \nSMEs also obtain tax privileges according to the Tax Code. According to the privileges, \nthese entities are fully exempt from land and property taxes, from taxes for imports of \nmachinery, technological equipment and facilities for seven years from the date of receipt \nof the Investment Promotion Certificate, while legal entities are exempt from profit tax \nand individual entrepreneurs are exempt from 50% of profit tax. \n\nUnder Decision No. 401 of the Cabinet of Ministers, 6 October 2016,10 SMEs, capable \nof exporting non-oil products, have the opportunity to access export promotion financing \nbased on the value of the products they sell abroad.  \n\nSteps have been taken in recent years to create important mechanisms in Azerbaijan \nsuch as important elements of the financial infrastructure and to support SMEs\u2019 access \nto financial resources. Since March 2018, for example, SMEs can obtain extracts of data \nfrom  the  real  estate  registry  through  the  State  Agency for  Public  Service  and  Social \nInnovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan (ASAN) service centers, \nthus enhancing the ability to receive loans using real estate as collateral. In March 2017, \n\u2018the process was simplified for SMEs willing to take out a loan against their real estate. \nThus, according to the new rules, the owner can obtain a certificate for the registered \nrights on the property and their restriction on the state register via the Electronic Notary \nInformation System in real time. \n\nfinancial  system \n\nFinally, with the entry into force, in October 2016, of the law regulating the activities of \ncredit bureaus, an important financial institution, which is essential for SMEs, began to \noperate. Under Article 1 of this law, \u201cthe purposes are improvement of opportunities of \naccess to financial services for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities by the forming \nof  a  long-term  information  base  about  the  accomplishment  of  the  financial  liabilities, \nstrengthening of financial discipline in debt relations and support to ensuring stability of \nthat  play  a  \nthe \ncrucial  role  as  a  database  in  giving  an  objective  and  comprehensive  idea  of  SMEs \ninvolved in resource allocation, as well as providing funding to resource applicants as \nsoon as possible. After the adoption of the law, in December 2017 the first credit bureau \nwas established in Azerbaijan by eight commercial banks. Since May 2018, the Bureau \nhas been exchanging information with 120 organizations, including the Central Bank, 30 \nbanks  and  14  banks  under \nliquidation,  47  non-bank  credit  organizations,  \n22  insurance  companies,  3  mobile  operators  and  3  communal  service  operators. \nAzerbaijan  Credit  Bureau  LLC  offers  three  types  of  services:  1)  credit  report;  \n2) issuance of personal credit rating; 3) issuance of credit histories.12 \n\nthe  country.\u201d 11  It \n\ninstitutions \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nis \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n10  http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/33870. \n11  http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/34274. \n12  https://www.acb.az/. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\n2.  STATUS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR SMES \n\nThe importance of financial inclusion has recently become real in Azerbaijan. In general, \naccess  of  the  business  sectors,  including  SMEs,  to  the  services  offered  by  financial \ninstitutions is not at a desirable level, which is also confirmed by the results of studies \ncarried  out  by  both  international  financial  institutions  (e.g.,  World  Bank)  and  local \nresearch organizations (e.g., Center for Support for Economic Initiatives).13  \n\n2.1  Financial Inclusion and Bank Accounts \n\nIn  Azerbaijan,  it  is  mainly  bank  and  non-bank  credit  organizations  and  insurance \ncompanies that provide services that serve financial inclusion. Focusing on micro small \nenterprises and households in urban and rural areas, these services cover such sectors \nas trade, service, industry, and agriculture. One of the key elements of financial inclusion \nis  the  creation  of  necessary  service  infrastructure,  including  the  equal  distribution  of \ncredit institutions across the regions of the country. The closer businesses are to financial \nservices, the greater the accessibility of such services will be. Although there were once \na number of credit organizations and branches, the devaluation in 2015 had a negative \nimpact on the country\u2019s financial sector. In 2014, there were 45 banks, 752 branches, \nand 162 departments. There were also 157 non-banking credit organizations with their \n287 branches and 999 departments in that period.14 As a result of the devaluation, their \nnumber has dropped significantly over the past three years. According to the Financial \nMarket Supervision Authority,15 by the end of 2017, the number of banks in Azerbaijan \ndecreased to 30, the number of branches to 509, and the number of departments to 142. \nThere  are  223  branches  and  1,112  divisions  of  123  non-bank  credit  organizations.  In \ngeneral,  the  significant  decline  in  the  number  of  credit  institutions  has  worsened  the \nSMEs\u2019 access to financial services. \n\nTable 1: Number of Active Azerbaijani Banks \n\nBanks \n\nNumber of banks \nBanks with foreign capital, including: \n  with the share of foreign capital ranging from 50 to 100%  \n  with the share of foreign capital not exceeding 50%  \n  local branches of foreign banks \nLocal bank branches \n\n2014 \n45 \n23 \n8 \n13 \n2 \n752 \n\n2017 \n30 \n15 \n8 \n7 \n2 \n509 \n\nChange \n(+ Increase, \n\u2013 Decrease) \n\u201315 \n\u20138 \n0 \n\u20136 \n0 \n\u2013243 \n\nSource:  Central  Bank  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan,  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Authority  of  the  Republic  \nof Azerbaijan. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13  http://edf.az/ts_general/azl/ksid/downloads/maliyye_elchatanligi_aliyev_samir.pdf. \n14  Azerbaijan  Republic  Central  Bank  Statistical  bulletin,  \u211612 \n\nhttps://www.cbar.az/assets/3687/-_BULLETEN_12_-_2014_AZERI_OK.pdf. \n\n15  https://www.fimsa.az/en/2017-ci%20il. \n\n(178),  12/2014,  2017,  Baku. \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nThe increasing number of bank customers on the background of the declining number of \ncredit  institutions  has  negatively  affected  the  quality  of  banking  services.  While  \nthe  number  of  customers  per  bank  was  114  thousand  in  2014, 16  with  a  total  of  \n311.8 thousand bank accounts, this figure was 192 thousand people and 537 thousand \naccounts in 2017. In 2017, a customer had an average of 2.3 accounts (2.8 in 2014). \nAccording  to  the  official  information 17 of  the  CBAR,  by  the  end  of  2017,  of  the  total \nnumber of the bank clients, 231.5 thousand (168.9 thousand in 2014) were individual \nlegal  entities  \nin  entrepreneurship,  and  86.8 \nentrepreneurs  engaged \n(96.5 thousand in 2014). \n\nthousand \n\nFigure 6: Number of Bank Accounts (2013\u22122017) (in thousands) \n\nSource: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \n\n \n\nOf  all  these  accounts,  13.3  million  (10.5  million  in  2014)  were  current  and  \n345.8  thousand  (in  2014,  658.2  thousand)  deposit  accounts.  Individuals  with \nentrepreneurship activities accounted for 244.4 thousand (184.4 thousand), legal entities \nfor 169.4 thousand (175.6 thousand) of the current accounts. Unfortunately, there are \nalmost  no  statistical  databases  regarding  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  in \nAzerbaijan, which  prevents  the  identification  of  the  share  of  SMEs  in  these  accounts. \nAssuming that Individuals engaged in entrepreneurship represent SMEs, we can think \nof 231,500 as SME accounts. However, it is difficult to determine the share of SMEs in \nrelation to bank accounts and deposit accounts of legal entities. \n\n2.2  Access to Credit \n\nAs  per  the  survey  findings  of  the  World  Bank  (WB)  with  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises in 2014, high interest rates coupled with complicated procedures are among \nthe key factors limiting their access to credit, which is one of the key elements of financial \ninclusion. In addition, the high level of collateral for bank loans, which is the main source \nof financing for SMEs, limits access to finance. \n\n                                                 \n16  https://www.cbar.az/assets/3687/-_BULLETEN_12_-_2014_AZERI_OK.pdf. \n17  Azerbaijan  Republic  Central  Bank  Statistical  bulletin,  \u211607 \n\nhttps://www.cbar.az/assets/4715/Statistik_b%C3%BClleten_2018_iyul_PDF.pdf. \n\n(220),  07/2018,  2017,  Baku. \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nIn the annual Doing Business report, prepared jointly by the WB and the International \nFinance  Corporation  (IFC),  which  reflects  the  business  environment  affordability \nassessment, entrepreneurs\u2019 access to credit has been dwindling in recent years. In the \n\u201cDoing  Business  2018\u201d  report,  Azerbaijan  was  ranked  low  in  terms  of  the  ease  of \nborrowing. In general, in the last 10 years, the level of access to credit has steadily been \ndeteriorating. While Azerbaijan was ranked 15th out of 183 countries in 2010, this figure \nhas fallen to 122nd place among 190 countries in 2018. Getting Credit explores two sets \nof issues\u2014the strength of credit reporting systems and the effectiveness of collateral and \nbankruptcy laws in facilitating lending. The lack of private credit bureaus in Azerbaijan \nalso significantly worsens its position in the credit obtaining index.  \n\nin  cooperation  with \n\nAccording  to  the  results  of  the  Business  Environment  and  Enterprise  Performance \nSurvey (BEEPS), conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD) \nis  one  of  \nthe  major  obstacles  to  business  development.  The  results  of  the  survey,  in  which  \n390  enterprises,  including  SMEs,  were  also  surveyed,  reflect  the  year  2013.  Of  the \nsurveyed  local  enterprises,  21.7%  of  small  businesses  operating  in  the  country  and \n21.6% of medium businesses raised access to finance as the main problem. \n\nthe  access \n\nthe  WB, \n\nfinance \n\nto \n\nSMEs  in  Azerbaijan  are  mainly  looking  at  banks  and  non-bank  credit  institutions  for \nloans. Entrepreneurs mainly use loans as sources of external funding. \n\nThe result of the BEEPS survey shows that about half of the SMEs do not need credit. \nAccording to the survey, bank loans are the dominant source of external funding for the \nSMEs, and alternative external sources of financing have not yet been developed. Of the \nbusinesses surveyed, 14.7% small businesses and 14.6% medium businesses reported \nhaving a credit line (Table 2). \n\nAs  can  be  seen  from  Table  2,  more  than  85%  of  small  and  medium-sized \nentrepreneurship  loans  (small  85.7%,  medium  97.2%)  are  collateral  based,  the  value  \nof which is more than twice as much as the value of the loan. This makes up 258.5% \nand  262.3%  of  collateral  in  the  loan  portfolio  for  small  and  medium  enterprises, \nrespectively. For comparison, these figures for Europe and Central Asia, respectively, \nare 197.9% and 189.8%, on average, while the world average is 217.5% and 198%.18  \n\nAt least three quarters of SMEs are financed through their internal funds. In the absence \nof internal funding, a quarter of SMEs attract bank funds for investment financing. SMEs \nalmost never finance themselves through equity financing.  \n\n\u201cThe SME Policy Index: Eastern Partners Countries 2016\u201d Report19 by the Organisation \nfor  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development (OECD)  says  that  as  in  other  Eastern \nPartnership  (EaP)  countries,  the  issue  of  access  to  finance  is  a  problem  for  SMEs  in \nAzerbaijan. According to the report, Azerbaijan\u2019s position on the SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nwas 2.70 out of 5 points, which is the worst indicator among the EaP countries. According \nto the methodology of the organization, this level indicates that there are good bases for \nimplementing policies in the field, but they are not put into practice. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18  Enterprise Surveys (http://www.enterprisesurveys.org), The World Bank. \n19  SME Policy Index: Eastern Partner Countries 2016.

With \nlimited resources, they prefer only less risky, less profitable, but more reliable spheres, \nthe reason for which is the difficulty of attracting funds from external sources. Both the \nhigh cost of resources and the enterprises\u2019 transparency problems limit their ability to \nattract financial resources externally. It is only those businesses that want to expand that \nare interested in external sources. \n\nThe results of the BEEPS survey show that approximately 51.4% of SMEs do not need \ncredit. Qabus Research and Consulting Company (QRCC), together with the Centre for \nMedia  and  Public  Initiatives  (CMPI),  conducted  a  survey  among  200  SMEs  in  order  \nto study their access to credit in Azerbaijan and the results suggest that when financial \nresources  are  needed,  it  is  credit  institutions  that  entrepreneurs  go  to  the  most.  \nForty-five  percent  of  SMEs  use  bank  and  5%  non-bank  loans.  The  share  of \nentrepreneurs  who  approach  their  friends  or  acquaintances  trying  to  get  interest-free \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nfunds  is  42.5%.  Only  a  small  percentage  of  respondents  (2.5%)  were  forced  to  seek \nfunding through pawnshops, which have the highest interest rates in the country.20 \n\nAlthough monthly, quarterly and annual statistical bulletins of entrepreneurship subjects \nare prepared in Azerbaijan, there is no statistical database on the share of SMEs in this \nlending. In response to the official inquiry addressed to the CBAR and the FIMSA, they \nsaid that no such statistics were recorded. \n\nThe following instruments of external funding sources for small and medium businesses, \nwhich  are  applied \nform  \nor another: \n\nin  world  practice,  are  used \n\nin  Azerbaijan \n\nin  one \n\nFinancial resources (loans) attracted from credit institutions. SMEs in Azerbaijan \nare  mostly  focused  on  banks  and  non-bank  credit  institutions  for  financial  resources. \nSMEs in Azerbaijan mainly use loans as sources of external funding. \n\nNo official information on SME lending is available in official statistical reports released \nby  the  banking  sector.  And  neither  is  such  information  provided  in  the  quarterly  and \nannual  financial  statements  disclosed  by  commercial  banks  in  accordance  with  the \nlegislation. For this reason, it is impossible to obtain reliable information on the level of \nlending to SMEs and on the specific weight of loans granted to SMEs from certain types \nof economic activity in aggregate loans used across sectors of the economy. With this in \nview, as part of the research, inquiries were sent to banks to evaluate SMEs\u2019 access to \nlending resources. The inquiries were submitted to the banks holding almost 70% market \nshare. \n\nIn  2017,  the  banks  holding  55%  of  the  total  assets  and  42%  of  the  aggregate  loan \nportfolio  in  the  banking  sector  responded  to  the  inquiries.  The  analysis  of  the  results \nreveals  that  the  loans  the  banks  allocated  to  SMEs  amounted  to  AZN433.8  million \n(10.2%).  \n\nThe  statistical  analysis  of  credit  investments  for  the  years  2013\u22122017  shows  that  the \ndeterioration of banks\u2019 assets as a result of the devaluation in 2015 resulted in restricted \nlending to them. According to the WB, private sector crediting (domestic credit to private \nsector)  dropped \nit  had  a  25.2%  share  \nin  GDP.  This  restriction  led  to  a  decrease  in  lending  and,  thus  a  difficulty  for  \nSME financing.  \n\nto  16.4% \n\nin  2017,\n\n while \n\n21\n\nLending  to  small  and  medium  businesses  (trade  and  services,  agriculture  and \nprocessing, transport and communications, construction and property) has diminished \nover time. While the credit investments demonstrated growth before the devaluation, this \nbegan to decline after it (Figure 7). \n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the total amount of credit lending in the country increased by 41% \nfrom 15.4 billion to 21.7 billion AZN. During this period, trade and service sector lending \ngrew  by  42.3%,  the  construction  and  property  sector  by  29.7%,  industry  and \nmanufacturing by 28.3%, and the transportation and communication sector by 188.2%. \nAgriculture and processing sector lending decreased only by 30.1%. In the aftermath of \nthe devaluation, falls were observed in the amount of credit lending both in the country \nand in separate sectors, with the total amount of lending decreasing by 46.3%. Thus, \nafter the devaluation, credit investments in the trade and services sectors declined by \n34.5%,  agriculture  and  manufacturing  by  15.7%,  construction  and  property  by  82%, \n\n                                                 \n20  Interest  Rate  Trends  in  Post-Soviet  Economies:  2005\u22122011.

However, this disclosure shows only the \ntotal lending. Our research shows that nearly all of the trade and services in Azerbaijan, \nmost of the agricultural and processing, construction and property, and a certain portion \nof transport and communications, belong to SMEs. The trend described in Figure 7 also \nincludes the pattern of SME lending. \n\nFactoring and forfeiting. These services are not a widely spread practice of financing \nin Azerbaijan\u2019s financial system and play a minor role in the financing of SMEs. Venture \ncapital,  which  is  the  main  source  for  start-ups,  has  recently  become  an  interesting \nsource of funding in Azerbaijan. \n\nLeasing.  The  challenges  of  long-term  investment  financing  for  SMEs  remains \nproblematic in our country, especially now when bank loans are difficult to obtain. While \nthere are a few leasing companies operating in Azerbaijan, this service has not yet been \ndeveloped. In Azerbaijan, leasing services are regulated by special legislation, and there \nis no control over their activities.  \n\nCapital market financing. In Azerbaijan, there is little experience in terms of attracting \nalternative financial resources to credits for SMEs in the form of the issuance of shares \nand  bonds.  These  sources  are  usually  used  by  large  companies.  The  volume  of  the \nsecurities market in 2017 amounted to about 15.7 billion manat, 3.7 billion manat of which \nis  accounted  for  by  the  corporate  securities  market.  Large  enterprises  are  the  major \nshareholders of corporate securities market and corporate bonds. Except for arbitrary \ncases, SMEs are not interested in attracting funds from this market. \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\n2.3  Financial Institutions Involved \n\nFinancial institutions  involved  in  the  financing and  financial  inclusion  of  SMEs  include \nregulatory  and  supervisory  agencies  (CBAR,  FIMSA),  state-owned  funds  providing \ngovernment  financial  support,  and  credit  institutions  and  bureaus  providing  financial \nsupport to business entities (Scheme 1). \n\nScheme 1: Financial institutions \n\n \n\nThe CBAR and FIMSA mainly regulate, control, and coordinate the financial market. \n\nThe experience of the Credit Bureau is new in Azerbaijan. The first credit bureau was \nestablished in December 2017 by eight banks together.22 The office has not yet started \nto operate. At present, the functions of the Credit Bureau are operated by the Centralized \nCredit Registry Service, which had initially been established within the CBAR and later \ntransferred to the FIMSA. \n\nThe other market participants are state funds. Just as in international practice, there are \na number of institutions in Azerbaijan providing state support, including funding for the \ndevelopment of SMEs. These institutions are as follows: \n\n\u2022  Entrepreneurship Development Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan23 \n\n\u2022  State Agency for Agricultural Credits24 \n\n\u2022  State Fund for Development of Information Technology 25 \n\n\u2022  Azerbaijan Mortgage and Credit Guarantee Fund26 \n\nThe  main  feature  of  these  funds  is  that  their  credit  resources  that  they  give  out  are \nsecured at the expense of funds allocated from the state budget. At the same time, the \nloans provided by these institutions are concessional and are a lot less expensive than \nthe other loans on the market. \n\n                                                 \n22  https://www.azernews.az/business/124329.html. \n23  No 222 Presidential decree of 31.07.2018, National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support was revoked \n\nand public legal entity called Entrepreneurship Development Fund was established in its place. \n\n24  Regulations on the State Agency on Agricultural Credits under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic \n\nof Azerbaijan.

The government has created an appropriate legislative framework for the \nexpansion  of  non-cash  operations  and  has  taken  steps  to  create  an  appropriate \ninfrastructure. Within this framework, the number of Point of Sale (POS) terminals has \nbeen  increased  for  non-cash  operations,  with  the  payments  for  state  services  made \nelectronically  available.  The  development  of  Internet  and  mobile  banking  by  banks \nimproved the access of SMEs to banking services. According to the official information \nof  the  CBAR, 27  the  number  of  bank  payment  cards  increased  from  5.67  million  to  \n5.8 million during 2013\u22122017 years, with the volume of transactions on bank cards rising \nfrom AZN1,149 million to AZN1,546 million and the number of POS terminals increasing \nfrom 33.3 to 65.5 thousand during this period. \n\nHowever, despite the purpose of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u201cOn Non-Cash \nPayments,\u201d  adopted  on  16  December  2016,  to  promote  non-cash  payments  in  the \ncountry,  it  has  been  hampered  by  several  restrictions.  According  to  the  law,  the  total \namount of taxable transactions by the taxpayers engaged in trading or public catering \nactivities  exceeding  200,000  manat  during  the  calendar  year  is  30,000  manats,  and \nactivities of the other taxpayers exceeding a total amount of 15,000 thousand manats \nare only to be paid non-cash.

Over the past five years, Azerbaijani banks have spent about \n300 million manat on financial technologies, 49.8% of which was spent on purchasing \nnew  programs. 28  The  so-called  \u201cregulatory  sandboxes\u201d  mechanism  is  not  used  in \nAzerbaijan,  and  this  significantly  limits  the  possibility  of  the  appearance  of  fintech \ncompanies  on  the  market.  Innovative  and  prospective  start-ups  are  forced  to  leave \nAzerbaijan due to the lack of legislation.

FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS \n\nOF SME ENTREPRENEURS \n\n3.1  Assessments of Financial Literacy \n\nAs per the approach of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD), financial literacy is a set of skills of financial consumers to understand financial \nproducts  and  concepts  to  improve  their  well-being,  evaluate  their  financial  risks  and \nopportunities, make informed choices and take other effective steps. In many countries, \nthere are state programs or strategies for financial literacy, and at the same time, work \nis  being  done  to  add  financial  literacy  to  the  training  program.  Central  banks  and \ncommercial  banks  are  conducting  campaigns  for  different  target  groups.  In  some \ncountries, there are even financial literacy advisory centers. \n\nFinancial  literacy  of  the  population  of  consumers  of  financial  services,  including \nentrepreneurs,  is  not  yet  at  the  desirable  level.  Although  there  are  no  fundamental \nassessments conducted in this area, the results of surveys conducted by international \norganizations reveal the necessity of continuing financial literacy initiatives.  \n\nUnlike the local organization, the assessments done by foreign institutions capture the \ncurrent reality with regard to financial literacy. \n\nIn  2014,  S&P\u2019s  Ratings  Services  and  the  World  Bank  Development  Research  Group \nproduced the Global Financial Literacy Ranking as a result of the survey conducted with \n150,000 people (over the age of 15) in 140 countries. Azerbaijan was ranked 65th out of \n144 countries, implying that 36% of the population in Azerbaijan are financially literate. \nFor comparison, according to the said report, the financial literacy levels in Kazakhstan \nare  40%  (ranked  49th),  in  Uzbekistan  21%  (ranked  126th),  in  Kirgizia  19%  (ranked \n134th), and Tajikistan 17% (ranked 139th).32 \n\nIn order to assess the financial literacy of the population, the WB surveyed the population \nover 18 years in Azerbaijan as part of the Financial Capability and Consumer Protection \nsurvey.33 Since the survey was conducted in 2009 and 2016, it was possible to compare \nthe levels of financial literacy of the population. The answers show that although there \nwas  an  upward  trend  in  a  range  of  financial  knowledge  (inflation  and  computing \nknowledge),  a  backward-trending  knowledge  (compound  interest  rate)  has  also  been \nobserved. According to the assessment, the lowest score is about the ordinary interest \nrate  (35.4)  and  the  highest  score  in  the  correct  distribution  of  ordinary  shares  (89.8). \nAccording to the methodology of the assessment, the lowest score is 0, the highest score \nis 100. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n32  https://www.theatlas.com/charts/VJDhtA8Xe. \n33  http://responsiblefinance.worldbank.org/surveys/demand/exploreeconomies/azerbaijan/2016#financial-\n\nknowledge. \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nTable 3: Key Financial Knowledge Indicators \n\nIndicators \n\nPercent of adults with understanding of inflation \nPercent of adults with understanding of simple interest \nPercent of adults with understanding of compound \ninterest \nPercent of adults who can think in real monetary values \n(money illusion) \nPercent of adults correctly calculating a simple division \nPercent of adults with basic numeracy skills (to identify \nbetter bargains) \nPercent of adults with basic numeracy skills (APRs) \nPercent of adults with deposit insurance awareness \n\n2009 \n45.8 \n \n46.2 \n\n61.7 \n\n \n78.1 \n\n52.3 \n5.8 \n\nSource: World Bank. \n\nAzerbaijan \n\n2016 \n67 \n35.4 \n45.7 \n\nWorld \n51.5 \n42.3 \n35 \n\nEast Asia \nand Pacific \n38.9 \n69.2 \n58.7 \n\n89.8 \n78.6 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n50.5 \n\n88.2 \n70.1 \n\n41.2 \n11.3 \n\n96.8 \n86 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n3.2  Existence of Financial Education Strategy \n\nThe  government  has  never  had  a  long-term  strategy  in  the  field  of  financial  literacy.  \nAt  present,  the  existing  strategies  to  increase  financial  literacy  are  reflected  in  the \n\u201cNational Road Map and Strategic Road Map on major sectors of the economy\u201d approved \nby the Presidential Decree of 6 December 2016. The three components of the Strategic \nRoad Map are highlighted in the development of financial literacy. \n\n\u2022  Enhancing financial literacy has been identified as one of the five strategic goals \nin the Strategic Road Map on the development of financial services in the \nRepublic  of  Azerbaijan.  The  country\u2019s  financial  services  sector  has  been \nanalyzed in the form of SWOT analysis in the Road Map, with the low financial \nliteracy indicated as one of the weak sides of the sector. Therefore, enhancing \nthe financial literacy of consumers and strengthening the protection of their rights \nis considered as one of the priority steps to be taken. \n\n\u2022  The Strategic Road Map on the production and processing of agricultural \nproducts in the Republic of Azerbaijan argues that the low level of financial \nliteracy of agricultural producers has led to the smaller share of loans provided to \nthe agricultural sector in the total economy. Financial literacy is included among \none of the priority activities \u201cImproving financing mechanisms in the agricultural \nsector\u201d to serve the strategic goal of \u201cfacilitating access to finance.\u201d According to \nthe map, the financial literacy of agricultural producers, including SMEs, will have \nincreased and their access to finance on favorable terms will be provided. \n\n\u2022  The Strategic Road Map on the production of consumer goods at the level \nof  small  and  medium  entrepreneurship  in  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  has \nincluded activities related to the improved financial literacy of SMEs under the \nStrategic  Objective  of  \u201censuring  the  effective  and  efficient  access  to  financial \nresources of SME subjects.\u201d The map indicates that as a result of the increased \nfinancial literacy of SMEs, they will be more competitive, which, in turn, will have \na positive impact on the proper use of financial resources. \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\n3.3  Institutions Involved (Both Public and Private) \n\nCBAR was the first to subscribe to the initiative of financial literacy, implementing various \nfinancial  literacy  projects  since  2010.  The  Ministry  of  Education  and  the  Azerbaijan \nLibrary Confederation are the partners of the CBAR in Financial Literacy. On the other \nhand,  the  external  organizations  joining  the  process  include  the  OECD,  International \nFederation of Library Associations (IFLA), American Resource Centre (ARC), Germany \nInternational Cooperation Society (GIZ), PricewaterhouseCoopers Global (PWC), WB, \nGerman Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC). 34 \n\nthe \n\nlevel  of  small  and  medium  entrepreneurship \n\nDifferent  public  authorities  and  public  legal  entities  are  responsible  for  implementing \nactivities to increase financial literacy envisaged in the \u201cNational Road Map and Strategic \nRoad Map for Major Sectors of the Economy.\u201d The Strategic Road Map for production of \nconsumer  goods  at \nin  \nthe Republic of Azerbaijan shows the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Education, the \nFIMSA,  and  the  Small  and  Medium  Business  Development  Agency  as  the  main \nimplementers of the financial literacy of SMEs in the years 2017\u22122020. The CBAR and \nthe  FIMSA  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  \u201cIdentification  of  Directions  \nto  Strengthen  Financial  Literacy\u201d  envisaged  in  the  Strategic  Road  Map  on  the \ndevelopment of financial services in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The main implementer \nof \u201cIncreasing the Financial Literacy of Agricultural Producers\u201d envisaged in the Strategic \nRoad Map for the production and processing of agricultural products in the Republic of \nAzerbaijan, which is to be implemented during 2017\u22122020, is the Ministry of Agriculture, \nas well as the Ministry of Economy, FIMSA and Local Authorities. \n\nAlong  with  public  bodies,  there  are  banks,  higher  education  institutions,  and  public \nunions involved in this process. Azerbaijan Banks Association (ABA), Azerbaijan Micro-\nFinance Association (AMFA), together with the CBAR, implement projects on \u201cFinancial \nLiteracy\u201d now and then. \n\n3.4  Target Groups and Programs \n\nThe  main  target  groups  of  the  Financial  Literacy  project,  initiated  by  the  CBAR,  are \nstudents,  the  broader  population,  journalists  specializing  in  economics,  employees  \nof  the  CBAR,  bank  employees  and  students  studying  banking.  In  addition,  the  target \ngroups of events held by banks and associations are housewives, entrepreneurs who \nhave  started  their  business,  young  scholars,  and  teachers.  Currently,  there  are  no \nspecial programs to promote financial literacy among SMEs.  \n\n3.5  Types of Programs \n\nSeminars,  trainings,  round  tables,  printed  materials,  video  clips,  and  competitions  are \nused as the tools for increasing financial literacy. For instance, e-learning materials were \ndeveloped  and  a  total  of  25  events  were  held  in  2012  under  the  framework  \nof  increasing  financial  literacy.  A  \u201cBanks  for  Schools,  Schools  Banks\u201d  week  was \norganized in cooperation with commercial banks, and trainings were held for commercial \nbanks  and  teachers  with  varying  approaches. 35  In  2013,  the  second  International \nSavings  Day  in  Azerbaijan  and  later,  the  Financial  Literacy  Month  in  November  were \nheld as the continuation of this. Issues such as central banking, credits, savings, credit \ncards, and others were discussed with necessary explanations in those events, covering \n\n                                                 \n34  https://en.cbar.az/lpages/finance-edu/about-the-project/. \n35  Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan 2012 Annual Report. www.cbar.az. \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nabout  10,000  schoolchildren,  young  families,  and  the  broader  public.  In  addition,  the \n\u201cActual Annual Interest Rate\u201d calculator was prepared and posted on play.google.com in \npartnership with the SBFIC.36 \n\n3.6  General Financial Education \n\nIn recent years, various educational events (trainings, seminars, etc.) have been held in \nAzerbaijan to increase financial literacy. Secondary and higher education institutions are \nalso  involved  in  this  process.  Activities  related  to  increasing  financial  literacy  in \neducational  institutions  are  limited  to  project  activities.  Except  for  economics-specific \nuniversities, subjects that focus on increasing the level of financial literacy are not taught \nin other higher and secondary education institutions. \n\n3.7  Debt Management Programs \n\nn Azerbaijan, SMEs have both payable and receivable debts. However, unlike payables, \nofficial  statistics  on  the  receivables  are  not  disclosed.  More  than  90%  of  SMEs  are \nindividual entrepreneurs and family businesses without an accounting system in place \nand,  therefore,  no  accurate  accounting  of  enterprises\u2019  receivables  is  done.  The \nreceivables  of  SMEs  arise  from  the  non-payment  for  the  products  and  services  that \nSMEs sell. A number of entities are unable to meet their obligations to other institutions, \nincluding credit institutions, because they cannot obtain their receivables, and thus face \nthe  risk  of  default.  Such  a  conclusion  is  made  on  the  basis  of  the  discussions  with \nentrepreneurs within the framework of the study. \n\nUnlike  receivable  debts,  there  are  statistics  on  payable  debts  of  SMEs.  Due  to  the \ndevaluation  of  the  country  in  2015,  the  volume  of  loans  received  from  the  financial \ninstitutions  of  the  SMEs  has  increased  up  to  double,  which  has  created  difficulties  in \nrepaying them. No program on the repayment of such loans has been made. To repay \ndebts, credit institutions have to set up individual programs with their SME clients. \n\nThere is no single strategy in the country to manage either payables or receivables. \n\n3.8  Assessment of Effectiveness \n\nIt is important to conduct an appropriate assessment to measure the level of financial \nliteracy.  Unfortunately,  there  are  no  such  exams  held  in  Azerbaijan  except  for  a  \nfew  cases.  While  the  results  of  the  \u201cFinancial  Literacy  Survey\u201d 37  conducted  with  \n1,200 respondents in the eight economic regions of the country in 2009 allowed for the \nbasis of comparisons, no second survey was carried out later, which would have allowed \nan evaluation of the situation. \n\nNot only the implemented projects, but also the economic hardships experienced in the \nfinancial sector of the country in 2014\u22122016 also played an important role in enhancing \nthe financial literacy of SMEs. The devaluation of the national currency, the closure of \nbanks, the increased risk of non-repayment of deposits, the bank\u2019s preference for foreign \ncurrency loans, and other threats raised entrepreneurs\u2019 interest in economic issues, with \na  growing  readership  of  economic  news  in  the  mass-media,  and  the  number  of \n\n                                                 \n36  Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan 2013 Annual Report. www.cbar.az. \n37  FINAL  REPORT  Results  of  the  Financial  Literacy  Survey  December  30,  2009  Baku,  Azerbaijan. \n\nfile:///D:/Rakurs/Sorgu/Financial_Literacy_Survey_Report_ENG.pdf. \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\neconomically  active  portals  (fins.az,  finans.az,  fed.az.  kommersant.az)  starting  to \nincrease. \n\n4.  BARRIERS TO SME FINANCE \n\n4.1  Supply Side \n\nFactors hindering SMEs\u2019 access of to finance can be summarized as follows: \n\nHigh interest rates. A high interest rate on credits is among the factors which enfeebles \nthe access to credit resources for SMEs. According to the CBAR, the annual interest rate \nfor  loans  up  to  one  year  is  17.75%  in  national  currency,  7.75%  in  foreign  currencies, \n19.5% and 11% between 1 and 3 years, and 14.31% and 11.65%, respectively, on loans \nbetween 3 to 5 years.38 In fact, interest rates for bank loans are higher than the official \nones. \n\nThe  main  reason  for  higher  annual  interest  rates  on  credit  is  due  to  higher  rates  for \nresources, in particular deposits, drawn by the banks. The share of deposits in total bank \nliabilities ranged from 75% to 78% between 2015 and 2018.39 Therefore, a higher annual \ninterest  rate  for  deposits  gives  rise  to  higher  interest  rate  on  credit.  According  to  the \nCBAR, 40  the  annual  interest  rate  for  deposits  in  AZN  is  11%\u221212%,  while  hitting \n14%\u221215% at some banks, thus causing higher lending interests.  \n\nQabus  Research  and  Consulting Company  (QRCC)  and  Centre  for  Media  and  Public \nInitiatives (CMPI) held a survey41 on SMEs\u2019 access to loans, with 38% of respondents \nciting a high interest rate as the reason why they had not applied to credit institutions. \nUp to 85% of the entrepreneurs surveyed had an average annual interest rate of over \n20% for their loans. \n\nCredit  institutions not interested  in  financing  the region. The  official  data  suggest \nthat  in  2017  Baku  had  the  highest  concentration  of  the  country\u2019s  credit  resources \n(83%). Overall,  in 2010\u22122013,  Baku\u2019s  share  in  total  credits  was  87%. Annual  interest \nrates  on  loans  continue  to  grow,  despite  the  slowdown  in  the  capital  from  region  to \nregion. In  Baku,  annual  interest  rates  (10.3%)  are  lower  than  the  national  average \n(11.8%). However, in some regions, such as the Lankaran and Aran economic regions, \nthe annual interest rate is even higher than 22%.42 \n\nHarsh terms of credit. Failure to get credit within the required amount and time is one \nof the common problems facing SMEs. In QRCC\u2019s and CMPI\u2019s survey,43 entrepreneurs \nhave  raised  this  problem. The  analysis  of  the  survey  results  showed  that  31.5%  \nof  the  respondents were  able  to  take as  much  credit  as required,  while  the  others \ncomplained  about  the  small-size  (29.6%),  short-term  (10.2%),  and  high  interest  rates \n(25%) of loans.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n38  https://www.cbar.az/assets/4495/STATISTIK_BULLETEN_2017_DEKABR.pdf. \n39  Azerbaijani Banks in 2018.

Baku-2012 QRCC and CMPI. \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nIn  addition,  SMEs  are  not  encouraged  to  deal  with  financial  institutions  due  to  the \nexcessively high level of collateral requirements and much higher loan rates proposed \nby banks. It is also clear from the responses of banks surveyed that 94% of loans issued \nto SMEs in 2017 were secured by collateral and 6% were unsecured. \n\nHigh risk in the economy. The analysis of the CBAR and FIMSA shows that the share \nof  loans  in  the  structure  of bank  sector  assets has  been  decreasing  in  recent  years; \ndespite reaching a peak of 73.5% in 2013 the ratio of bank loans to assets started to \ndecline in the following years, dropping to 41.1% in 2017.  \n\nThe sharp decline in the ratio of loans to assets demonstrates the increasingly limited \nparticipation of the banking sector in the economic and real sector development. High \nrisk in the economy leads banks to invest up to 60% of their assets in securities or the \nCBAR\u2019s depositary auctions. The increased share of troubled loans to 14% points to a \nhigh risk in the economy. \n\nPreference  toward  loans  in  foreign  currency. The  expectations  of  devaluation \naccelerated the dollarization of the banking sector as of the end of 2014, with the banks \nsqueezing their loans in national currency and preferring loans in foreign currency. As a \nresult, the share of foreign currency in total lending increased from 27% in 2014 to 49.4% \nby  the  end  of  2015  when  the  devaluation  occurred. In  the  following  years, this  figure \ndropped slightly to 40.9% by the end of 2017 due to the relative stability of the national \ncurrency. Currently, the dollarization level in trade and the service sector is 43.8%, in the \nindustrial  and  manufacturing sector  52.1%,  in  the  Construction  and  property sector \n24.4%, in transport and the communications sector 85.8%, and 19.4% in agriculture. The \nlow level of dollarization in agriculture is due to the recent increase in the preferential \nloans provided by the state to this sector. \n\nLack  of  interest  in  leasing.  Leasing  services  are  poorly  developed,  and  SMEs  \nstill  rely  on  state-run  \u201cAgroleasing\u201d  Open  Joint-stock  Company, 44  working  on  more \nfavorable  terms.  Private  leasing  companies  operating  in  Azerbaijan  chiefly  lease  out \nconsumer  goods  (automobiles,  domestic  appliances,  furniture,  etc.).  Current  leasing \ninterest rates are higher than bank loans and they are not profitable for entrepreneurs. \n\nSMEs  access  to  finance  in  Azerbaijan  is  limited  and  the  \u201cStrategic  Road  Map  for \nmanufacture  of  consumer  goods  by  small  and  medium  enterprises\u201d  adopted  by  the \nGovernment  in  December  2016  provides  detailed  explanations  on  the  problem.45 The \ndocument notes that 51% of SMEs operating in Azerbaijan point to the issue of access \nto finance as the most serious obstacle to business development. The Road Map also \nemphasizes  that  the  low  level  of  cash  management  capabilities  in  SMEs  and  weak \ncorporate  governance  make  banks  less  attractive  to  provide  lending  to  SMEs.  As  a \nresult, there is a high rate of denial of loans for SMEs in Azerbaijan. The government \nacknowledges  in  its  Road  Map  that  in  2016,  one  quarter  of  the  loan  applications  in  \nthe  agricultural  sector,  and  36%  of  micro-business  lending  applications  were  refused  \nby banks. \n\nAnalysis of the surveys as part of the study also shows that banks restrictedly use loan \nfinancing  mechanisms, such  as  letters  of  credit  and  guarantees  (about 10\u221215%  of all \nloans). The banks\u2019 responses show that about 90% of loans to SMEs are ordinary loans \nsecured by collateral. As external security mechanisms do not work effectively, SMEs\u2019 \npersonal assets (more than 30% of all loans are provided on these terms), or machinery \nand mechanisms at their disposal (about 27%), or their real estate (23%) are used as a \n\n                                                 \n44  http://agrolizing.gov.az/en. \n45  https://azertag.az/store/files/Strateji_yol_xeritesi/Ki%C3%A7ik_v%C9%99_orta_sahibkarl%C4%B1q_s% \nC9%99viyy%C9%99sind%C9%99_istehlak_mallar%C4%B1n%C4%B1n_istehsal%C4%B1na_dair.pdf  \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nguarantee for collateral. In other words, according to a third-party warranty, SMEs at best \ncan obtain about 10% of the loan available. \n\nInsolvency. The devaluation that took place in 2015 worsened the solvency of SMEs \nborrowing  in  foreign  currency. A  more  than  twofold  increase  in  monthly  payments  in \nforeign currency due to the devaluation, on the one hand, and the deteriorating turnover \ndue  to  the  slowing  sales,  on  the  other,  restricted  the  ability  of  SMEs  to  repay  their \ndebts. Banks restructured the debt repayments by prolonging the repayment periods and \nreducing the annual interest rates of loans. However, this did not solve the problem, and \nthe  volume  of  troubled  loans  kept  increasing. The  insolvency  to  repay  the  incumbent \nloans and the prolonged periods of the old loans limited entrepreneurs\u2019 ability to receive \nnew loans. \n\n4.2  Demand Side \n\nLow financial literacy of entrepreneurs. The low level of awareness of entrepreneurs \nabout  the  range  of  financial  services, coupled  with  their inaccurate and  untimely  loan \napplications  ultimately  reduce  their  access  to  credit  resources. The  results  of  our  \nin-depth  interviews  with  entrepreneurs  in  the  research  process  indicate  that  many  of \nthem are  unaware  of  the  state funds  providing  preferential  loans. For  example,  \nthe QRCC and CMPI survey46 shows that 73.1% of entrepreneurs reported that they had \nnot  applied \nthem explaining  \nthat  they  had  had  no  information  on  preferential  loans. Our  interviews  also  show  that \nentrepreneurs do not have the basic knowledge of the capital market, and only see bank \nloans as a source of finance. \n\nthe  state\u2019s  preferential \n\nloans,  with  53.9%  of \n\nfor \n\nLow financial transparency. Low  financial  transparency  in  the  activities  of  SMEs \ncomplicates their access to finance. For example, in Azerbaijan, there is no experience \nin attracting financial resources from bonds. These sources are usually used by large \ncompanies. While the minimum annual interest rate of 16%\u221217% of the country\u2019s loans \nis  low,  attracting  funds  is  even  cheaper  than  that. The inability  of SMEs  to comply \nwith the financial standards, or the lack of accountability in some cases, deprives them \nof being a participant in the equity market and it is because of the lack of transparency \nin financial accountability that SMEs cannot attract resources from abroad. \n\n4.3  Institutional Aspects \n\nAlthough there  is  a  certain  institutional  environment  providing for  SMEs\u2019  access \nto finance, some institutional mechanisms do not function properly or  exist at all. One \nsuch mechanism is the real estate registration and its participation in lending by acting \nas a guarantee mechanism. \n\nAccording  to  the  Civil  Code  and  other  legislation,  the  rights  acquired  through  the \nagreements over land plots and other real estate are subject to state registration.

As a  rule,  real  estate \nis required as a credit guarantee. \u2019It is mostly cars and gold products that are required \nas collateral. The practice of movable property as collateral is not a widespread practice \nin Azerbaijan. \n\nCurrently, there are difficulties in obtaining guaranteed credits in Azerbaijan. As part of \nthe  study  and  in-depth  interviews, focus-group  discussions held  with  entrepreneurs \nand professionals in the banking sector show that the collateral requirements of credit \ninstitutions are quite tough. These requirements mainly include the following: \n\n\u2022  Real estate (house, premise, land) is accepted as collateral \n\n\u2022  Real estate has to be based in the capital city of the country \n\n\u2022  The amount of loan offered to a customer cannot exceed 50% of the market value \n\nof the collateral \n\n\u2022  Real estate must be state-registered and included in the state registry  \n\nThe  complexity  of  the  current  collateral  mechanisms  leads  the  bank  to  apply  harsh \nconditions  to  their  customers  to  insure  themselves. Our  research  suggests  that  the \nprocess of obtaining the right to sell the collateral for a non-repaid loan takes between 6 \nmonths to 2 years, which is due to the uncertainty in the relationship between the banks \nand the customer caused by law and the unfair judicial system.  \n\nThe  adoption of  the  Law of  the Republic  of  Azerbaijan  \u201cEncumbrance  of  Movable \nProperty\u201d on 2 May 2017 created the possibility of movable property obtaining collateral \nstatus.  According  to  the  law, operated  by  the  FIMSA,  the  state  registry  of  the \nEncumbrance of Movable Property was established. Under the bill, along with cars as \ncollateral, equipment, goods and cattle, goods in circulation, as well as movable assets \nsuch  as  receivables,  will  be accepted  as  collateral. The  mechanism  has  just  been \ncreated and is not used in lending yet. \n\n4.4  Regulatory Factors \n\nInsolvency issues in Azerbaijan are regulated by the law on Insolvency and bankruptcy \nadopted on 13 June 1997. Under the law, the debtor becomes insolvent when he or she \ncan\u2019t repay the loans. The debtor is considered to be insolvent only when it is announced \neither by him/herself, the court, or lenders.  \n\nUnder  the  law, the  bankruptcy process  may  be  initiated  by  the  enterprise through  \nan  appropriate decision without  the  court\u2019s involvement. As  soon  as  bankruptcy  is \nannounced,  the  debtor  loses  their  right  to  dispose  of  any  of  the  property as  part  of \ncarrying out business activities or for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations. The debtor \ncan  issue  such  orders only  with  the  permission  from  the  court, property  administrator \nand temporary property administrator. \n\nThe amendments made to the law created more opportunities for the debtor to recover \nfrom bankruptcy. According to the change, the lender or debtor can appeal to the court \nat  any  time  to  suspend  the  bankruptcy  process  in  order  to  look  at  the  possibility  of \nrecovery. The  debtor\u2019s  recovery  should  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  plan  of \nrecovery within the maximum duration of 24 months, as determined by law. \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nThe  law applies  to  all  legal  entities  (excluding  banks  and  public  entities)  and  to  all  \nprofit  and  non-profit  organizations. At  present,  there  is  no  legal  basis  for  individuals  \nto  declare  their  insolvency.  The  Law  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  on  Insolvency  and \nBankruptcy does not prevent entrepreneurs from obtaining finance, yet it is incapable of \naddressing existing problems. \n\nAccording  to  the  Doing  Business  2018 report,  Azerbaijan  ranks  47th  out  of  190  on  \nthe  Resolving  Insolvency  Indicator. 47  According  to  the  report,  lenders can  get  only \n40.2 cents of each 1 dollar from an insolvent entity. \n\n4.5  Cultural Aspects \n\nThe  complicated  access of  SMEs to financial resources  is  also  explained  by  the  \ndeep-rooted  mentality  and  attitudes  of  people. First  of  all,  the  requirements  arising  \nfrom  the  religious  narratives  limit  financial  sources  for  entrepreneurs. As  an  Islamic \ncountry, a group  of entrepreneurs  in  Azerbaijan may  refuse  to take  loans  from  banks  \nby referring to Sharia law, which states that interest is forbidden. The existing banking \nlegislation  does  not  support  Islamic  banking  in  the  country,  as  a  result  of  which \nentrepreneurs  susceptible  to  religious  demands  are  left  without  bank  loans.  Although \nAzerbaijan is a Moslem country, the financial legislation, and statements by government \nofficials, exclude any initiatives or intentions regarding the implementation of the Islamic \nfinancial system.  \n\nAnother  cultural  aspect  with  a  negative  impact  on  business  financing  is  the  lack  \nin \nthe  society \nof  an  unambiguous  attitude  of \nentrepreneurship.  In  surveys  conducted, 48 the  negative  attitudes  (of  their  family  and \npeople around them, etc.) towards women in business is raised as an obstacle.  \n\ntowards  women\u2019s  engagement \n\n4.6  Gender Issues \n\nGender  disparity  in  financing  the  SMEs  is  blatantly  prevalent. Since  women\u2019s \nentrepreneurship is part of the overall entrepreneurship, women are faced with the same \nfinancial  problems  as  SMEs are. The survey results  held  with  women  show  \nthat  the  problem  of  access  to finance  is  reported  to  be  the  main  factor  hindering \nbusinesses.49  \n\nThere  is  no  gender  analysis  of  access  to  credit  resources  available  in  the  official \nstatistical  data,  including  statistical  bulletins  of  the  CBAR  and  the  FIMSA.  According  \nto  the results  of  the  representative  statistical  survey \u201dGender  issues  in  the  production \nand  sale  of  agricultural  products\u201d conducted by  the  State  Statistical  Committee  of  \nthe  Azerbaijan  Republic  (SSCAR)  in 2012, 50 women  account  for  only  25.8%  of  the \nhouseholds receiving loans from financial institutions, while Global Findex argues that \nthe share of women receiving loans from financial institutions was 15%.51  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n47  http://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/azerbaijan#DB_ri. \n48  The  Current  Situation  on  Women\u2019s  Socio-economic  Empowerment  \u2013  Baseline  Analysis.

STATUS OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL VALUE \n\nCHAINS IN THE COUNTRY \n\nFor Azerbaijan, whose economy is dependent on resources, it is key to develop value \nchains  on  the  basis  of  non-resource  spheres  in  accordance  with  the  diversification \nstrategy. The government has precisely targeted the economic diversification in its road \nmap for the prospective development of the economy adopted in late 2016, and identified \nareas,  such  as  the  agrarian  sector,  food  industry,  tourism,  financial  services,  and \ninformation technologies, as key sectors. \n\nA value chain is a set of activities that an organization in a specific industry carries out \nto deliver a valuable product or service for its customers. The value chain of a finished \nproduct  (service)  sometimes  runs  through  a  full  range  of  activities\u2014including  design, \nproduction, transportation, marketing, distribution, storage, etc., which are separate links \nin this chain.  \n\nThe concept of a \u201cglobal value chain\u201d is used in relation to commodities and services that \nare  the  object  of  international  trade.  Countries  contribute  to  the  process  of  creating  a \nglobal value chain in a different way. The participation of countries in the creation of a \nglobal value chain occurs either through the import of some components of products or \nservices they export, or the export of various raw materials and components for goods \nand services produced in different countries. \n\nThe  service  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  ensuring  the  Azerbaijan  economy\u2019s \nparticipation  in  the  global  value  chain.  In  2017,  the  services  sector  (including \nconstruction) accounted for 55% of value added in the economy. However, according to \nthe  Government\u2019s  Road  Map,  only  3%  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  SMEs  are  able  to  earn  export \nrevenues. Given that all SMEs are concentrated in the non-oil sector and non-oil exports \naccount for only 2% of GDP, it is clear that export revenues from SMEs are very small in \nthe  tourism  sector.  It  should  also  be  taken  into  account  that  the  activities  of  SMEs  in \nAzerbaijan  are  mostly  focused  on  manufacturing  products  of  low  and  medium \ntechnological  levels  of  the  value  chain.  This  includes  primarily  agrarian  products,  the \nfood  industry  and  construction  industry,  which  do  not  require  high  technological \nprocesses.  \n\nThe level of participation of any country in global value chains is directly dependent on \nthe  potential  for  the  national  economy\u2019s  diversification.  The  more  the  economy  is \ndiversified, the more sectors are involved in the creation of added value; the economy \nproduces  more  products  and  services;  to  release  products  and  services  in  the  same \nsector,  raw  materials  and  materials  of  other  sectors  are  consumed  in  the  form  of \nintermediate  products.  In  this  respect,  the  priority  area  for  economic  diversification \nshould play the role of locomotive for the development of other sectors and form a new \ndemand for their products. Diversification of the economy can take place on the basis of \nproduct development, which replaces imports on the basis of large domestic demand, \n\n                                                 \n52  National Entrepreneurship Support Fund \u2212 2012\u22122016 years annual reports. www.anfes.az. \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nand diversification of exports on the basis of areas where the country has comparative \nadvantages. \n\nAzerbaijan\u2019s non-oil exports for 2017  totaled US$1.538 million, accounting for 11% of \ntotal exports.

This  is  due  to  exports  of  various  agricultural  and \nagro-industrial  products.  The  total  volume  of  agricultural  and  agrarian-industrial \nproduction exported from Azerbaijan constituted $658.9 million \u2212 $502 million, or 76% of \nexports, consisted of fresh fruit and vegetables.54  \n\n                                                 \n53  Database on Azerbaijan\u2019s foreign trade structure: https://www.stat.gov.az/source/trade/. \n54  Data obtained from the State Statistical Committee publication on \u201cForeign Trade Relations of Azerbaijan \n\n\u2212 2018.\u201d Source: https://www.stat.gov.az/source/trade/. \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nThe  agricultural  sector  participates  in  the  formation  of  value  chain  across  the  country \nthrough both the production of various crops and livestock production. According to the \nresults  of  2017,  the  aggregate  output  of  the  agricultural  sector  at  the  actual  prices  is \nAZN6.580 billion. AZN3.561 billion or 54.1% of this amount is due to of cattle-breeding, \nand AZN3.019 billion or 45.9% is due to plant-growing production. \n\nBased on official statistics, the bulk of agricultural products is provided by small farms. \nThus, AZN5.935 billion, or 90%, of the AZN6.580 billion worth of agricultural production \nwas provided by family-farmer and households of individual entrepreneurship subjects \nin 2017. There is no information in official sources on the exact portion and distribution \nof aggregate loans made available to the agricultural sector among the small, medium-\nsized, and large entrepreneurs. Only information on the total volume of loans allocated \nto agriculture is disclosed. According to the information provided by the CB, only 3.7%, \nor  AZN29.2  million,  of  the  loans  for  the  whole  economy  was  assigned  to  agricultural \nproducers. \n\nThere is clearly currently some concern regarding the development level of these sectors \nand what they can contribute to the economy in the future. What remain serious problems \nin  particular  are  the  extensive  growth  of  the  agrarian  sector,  the  smaller  size  of  the \nagricultural area  per  capita  (about 0.45  hectares),  the  non-use  of  cooperative  models \nand  the  fragmented  distribution  of  land  plots  among  800,000  farmers,  the  weak \ndevelopment of the processing industry that would purchase the crops of local farmers \nat the right time and at affordable prices, and exporting the bulk of their value chain as \nraw  materials  and  intermediate  products  at  lower  prices  without  entering  the  stage  of \nprocessing.  \n\nThe  extensive  expansion  of  the  agrarian  sector  manifests  itself  primarily  in  low \nproductivity.  Azerbaijan  now  lags  behind  developed  countries,  producing  around  four \ntimes less in both cattle breeding and crop production. \n\nThe  number  of  food  industry  enterprises  in  the  country  is  extremely  limited  and  their \nprocessing capacity is insignificant. Most of them fail to contribute to the formation of a \nglobal value chain because they lack the capacity to export. For comparison, it is worth \nmentioning that the number of enterprises specialized in meat processing in Azerbaijan \nis less than 50 and the number of wine factories is less than 20. However, in Moldova, \nwhose  economy  is  4\u22125  times  smaller  than  Azerbaijan,  the  number  of  specialized  \nmeat-processing enterprises and wine plants is 200 and 50, respectively. \n\n5.2  The Potential of the Processing Industry for Establishing  \n\nValue Chains  \n\nThe extractive industry constitutes a significant part of Azerbaijan\u2019s industry. According \nto  official  statistics,  only  27.5%,  or  AZN8.9  billion,  of  industrial  production  with  a  \nvalue  of  AZN32.3  billion  was  generated  in  the  processing  industry.  And  66%  of  the \nprocessing  industry  was  provided  by  two  areas\u2014food  products  (including  beverage \nproduction) and oil products processing. The food industry in Azerbaijan has no potential \nto  create  a  large  value  chain;  intermediate  products  formed  mainly  in  the  agricultural \nsector and raw materials are directly converted to end-products through the processing \nindustry.  \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nTable 5: 2017 Industry Structure in Azerbaijan55 \n\nFields and Sectors  \n\nShare of Industries, % \n\nAll industries  \n  Extractive industries  \n    Food industry (including tobacco) \n    Petroleum products processing  \n    Chemical industry  \n    Metallurgy industry  \n    Energy power sector  \n    Production of building materials \n    Other  \n\n100 \n\n70.3 \n8.2 \n6.4 \n1.3 \n1.2 \n4.6 \n1.7 \n6.3 \n\nSource: State Statistical Committee of the Azerbaijan Republic. \n\nOther sectors of the processing industry hold very little portion in overall industry. The \nshare  of  textiles,  apparel  and  leather  products  (including  footwear  production) \nmanufacturing  in  the  total  industrial  output  is  slightly  above  0.5%.  The  share  of \nconstruction  materials  in  the  total  industrial  production  is  1.3%,  that  of  the  chemical \nindustry 1.2% and the metallurgy industry 1%. \n\nIn 2017 exports of processing industry products amounted to $3.1 billion. \n\nThe share of small entrepreneurs is insignificant in the processing industry. In 2016, only \n3% out of the products of the processing industry, which totals AZN8.9 billion in actual \nprices, was provided by small enterprises. In turn, small entrepreneurs produced 3.4% \nof food processing industry products and 16% of construction materials. However, small \nentrepreneurs  dominate  in  terms  of  the  number  of  enterprises.  Thus,  out  of  1,777 \nindustry,  1,058  were  small  and  \nenterprises  operating \n719 large and medium-sized enterprises. \n\nthe  processing \n\nin \n\n5.3  Opportunities to Participate in the Global Value Chains \n\nthrough the Services Sector  \n\nThere has been a steady increase in the tourism sector in Azerbaijan in recent years. \nThis  growth  was  particularly  strong  between  2010  and  2015.  The  number  of  tourism \nenterprises in Azerbaijan increased by 4.5%, while employment within the tourism sector \nrose by 6% a year. The number of tourists rose by 8.5% during the period. According to \nthe  World  Tourism  and  Travel  Council,  the  tourism  sector  in  Azerbaijan  accounts  for \n2.8% of direct GDP and 2.6% of employment, which is slightly different from the average \n3% of GDP in the world and 3.6% of direct employment. This means there is potential \nfor further development.56 \n\n Only the tourism sector has the potential to develop the value chain both domestically \nand  globally.  According  to  official  statistics,  the  total  turnover  of  the  country\u2019s  export  \nof tourism services as of 2017 stood at around $2.5 billion. However, this figure was 1.3 \nbillion in 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n55  Azerbaijan\u2019s industry statistical database: https://www.stat.gov.az/source/industry/. \n56  \u201cPrimary  Directions  of  Strategic  Roadmaps  for  National  Economy  and  Main  Sectors  of  Economy\u201d \n\nhttp://www.e-qanun.az/framework/34254. \n\n28 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nThe  development  of  the  tourism  sector,  in  particular  improving  its  export  potential,  is \namong the government\u2019s main targets. Nevertheless, this sector should first be able to \ncompete with the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the region, in particular, Turkey \nand Georgia. Natural conditions in these two countries are perfect for tourism activities. \nIn particular, Georgia\u2019s tourist arrivals have grown by three times, with tourist numbers \nbeing  over  twice  as  large  as  that  country\u2019s  population  over  the  past  five  years.  But \nAzerbaijani tourism grew only by 22%. Azerbaijan in this situation will be able to shape \nthe  competitive  tourism  sector  by  improving  the  quality  of  its  tourism  infrastructure, \ncreating  favorable  prices  and  applying  simplified  visa  procedures  under  the  same \nconditions for all countries. \n\nIn 2017, there were 16,795 SMEs in the tourism sector, accounting for 10% of the total \nnumber of SMEs. Their total turnover stood at 817 million manats, accounting for 15% \nof SMEs total product and service turnover. According to official data, SMEs accounted \nfor 48.5% of the tourism sector.57  \n\n6.  VALUE CHAIN FINANCING ANALYSIS \n\nThe share of SMEs in lending is appropriate to their role in the economy. Thus, the share \nof SMEs in the economy is slightly above 6%, and about 10% of all loans are provided \nto them. This picture is similar across sectors of the economy. Trade is the sector with \nthe highest share of SMEs and 63% of total turnover in this area is provided by SMEs. \nIn turn, 42.4% of the loans provided to SMEs are used by the trade sector.  \n\nIn agricultural production, SMEs account for 1.1%, and 3.6% of SME loans had been \nused by this sector. Although the share of the said sector in value added is less than 5%, \nnearly 25% of all loans provided to SMEs went to that sector. But the exports from this \nsector significantly exceed those from other areas. In 2017, the tourism sector generated \n$3  billion  in  export  revenues  for  the  country,  while  the  total  export  revenue  of  SMEs \nacross  all  sectors  of  the  economy  is  substantially  less  than  that.  According  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  road  map,  only  3%  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  SMEs  are  able  to  earn  export \nrevenues. Given that all SMEs are concentrated in the non-oil sector and non-oil exports \naccount for only 2% of GDP, it is clear that export revenues from SMEs are very small in \nthe  tourism  sector.  It  should  also  be  taken  into  account  that  the  activities  of  SMEs  in \nAzerbaijan  are  mostly  focused  on  manufacturing  products  of  low  and  medium \ntechnological  levels  of  the  value  chain.  This  includes  primarily  agrarian  products,  the \nfood  industry,  and  the  construction  industry,  which  do  not  require  high  technological \nprocesses. According to the banks surveyed, the services sector accounts for 77% of all \nloans  issued  to  SMEs,  while  the  agrarian  sector  accounts  for  3.6%,  construction \nmaterials for 2.2%, the construction sector for 1.1%, and the food industry for 0.6%. \n\nThe statistical data available to evaluate the level of SME financing through the value \nchain  in  Azerbaijan  need  sharpening  in  order  to  conduct  in-depth  research.  Now  let\u2019s \nlook  at  how  the  information  on  the  value  chain  financing  scheme  is  disclosed  in  the \ncontext of agriculture.  \n\nFirst, and most typical in agriculture, the actors and especially farmers self-finance their \noperations through savings. The analysis of interviews with 270 farmers from across all \nregions  of  the  country  between  2015  and  2016  as  part  of  the  project,  Azerbaijan \n\n                                                 \n57  https://www.stat.gov.az/source/entrepreneurship/ \u201cSmall and Medium Entrepreneurship in Azerbaijan.\u201d \n\n29 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nAgricultural  Finance  Facility (AAFF),58 showed  that  40.4%  of  respondents  self-finance \ntheir operations. One of the mechanisms for self-financing is the establishment of credit \nunions. Under the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Credit Unions, the Credit Union \ncan be constituted by not less than 11 individual and (or) juridical persons in the statutory \norder. According to official figures, 54 credit unions are functioning in Azerbaijan.59 There \nis no database on the volume of resources required for credit unions.  \n\nSince  cooperatives  as  well  as  the  network  of  credit  cooperatives  created  jointly  by \nfarmers have not been formed in rural areas across Azerbaijan, self-financing has still to \nbe developed. The reason for this was reported to be the lack of a legal framework to \nestablish agrarian cooperatives until recently. The law on agriculture cooperation was \nadopted  only  in  2017,  but  the  government\u2019s  action  plan  on  the  development  of \ncooperation in 2018. As the result of this policy it should be expected some improvement \non this sector next years  \n\nSecond, value chain financing is informal. Of the farmers interviewed within the AAFF \nproject,60 19.3% said they had borrowed money from family members, 4.3% from friends \nand 0.2% from pawnbrokers. Examples also include input suppliers who sell fertilizer to \nfarmers on credit, or commodity traders who supply cash advances so rural storekeepers \ncan acquire commodities from farmers. \n\nThird, it is a formal financing mechanism in the form of credit and technical support from \nstate,  international,  and  private  financial  institutions.  With  financial  support  from  the \nWorld  Bank  (IBRD),  the  government  of  Azerbaijan  implemented  the  Agricultural \nCompetitiveness  Improvement  Project  (ACIP)  61 to  facilitate  the  access  of  agricultural \nproducers to markets by enhancing selected value chains, which is one of its targets.  \nIn  the  process  of  implementing  the  project  with  the  total  cost  of  $53.25  million,  an \ninformation-propaganda  campaign  was  conducted \nin  \n30  districts,  and  conceptual  documents  for  agribusiness  value  chains  for  various \nmanufacturing  enterprises  (engaged  in  dried  fruits,  meat  processing,  etc.)  operating  \nin several districts (Barda, Samukh) were prepared and submitted to the World Bank for \napproval.  The  banks,  as  part  of  the  project,  offered  to  finance  the  same  value  \nchain  through  authorized  banks.  Another  project,  the  AAFF,  is  a  joint  project  of  the \nEuropean Union and EBRD. Within the project, up to US$40 million had been allocated \nto partner financial institutions to provide lending to entrepreneurs or individuals in the \nagrarian sector. \n\nfor  potential  participants \n\nThe above-mentioned funding mechanisms in the agrarian sector are present in any form \nat  each  stage  of  the  value  chain  from  field  to  table.  Farmers  mostly  seek  to  \nself-finance  their  operations  \u2212  or,  if  that  is  not  possible,  go  to  financial  institutions.  \nAt the same time, they seek to benefit from the state\u2019s favourable financial and technical \nsupport. \n\nAt the input supply stage, technical support is provided by processing enterprises and \nthe state (through Aqrolizinq ASC). For example, a sugar-producing company supplies \nfarmers with seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, and the costs incurred are deducted from \nthe value of the product to be sold in the future.

POLICIES TO PROMOTE SME FINANCE \n\n7.1  Relevant Contents of National Strategy \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Economic  Development \n\nFinancing entrepreneurs, including SME operations, has been reflected in the Law on \nEntrepreneurship  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan,  dated  15  December  1992.  The  \nlaw also envisages the activity of the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support (NFES) \nat \nfinancing  \nto  entrepreneurship  activities.  Under  the  Presidential  Decree  on  Improving  the \nMechanism  of  State  Support  for  the  Development  of  Entrepreneurship  in  Azerbaijan, \ndated  31  July2018,  NFES  was  liquidated  and  the  public  legal  entity  Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Fund was established under the Ministry of Economy. \n\nto  provide \n\nin  order \n\nThe  Law  on  State  Support  for  Small  Entrepreneurship  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan, \nadopted  4  June  1999,  stipulates  small  enterprises\u2019  access  to  concessional  financing  \nas  the  main  directions  of  state  aid.  The  scope  of  this  law  is  limited  to  small \nentrepreneurship. \n\n\u201cPrimary Directions of Strategic Roadmaps for National Economy and Main Sectors of \nEconomy\u201d  was  endorsed  under  a  Presidential  Decree  on  6  December,  2016.  The \nroadmaps focus on 11 major sectors of the economy, three of which, mentioned below, \nenvisage increasing SMEs\u2019 access to financial sources and implementing mechanisms \nfor state support to financing.  \n\n1)  One of the five strategic targets in the \u201cStrategic Road Map for manufacture of \nconsumer goods by SMEs\u201d is to grant SMEs effective and favorable access to \nfinancing. It identifies four priority areas to achieve strategic targets: \n\n\u2022  Conduct reforms to solve winding-up and insolvency issues \n\u2022  Create SME Loan Guarantee Fund \n\u2022 \n\nImprove activities related to property issues and boost access to finance \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n64  http://abad.gov.az/en/about. \n\n32 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\n2)  One  of  the  five  strategic  targets  in  the  \u201cStrategic  Road  Map  for  manufacture  \nof  agricultural  products\u201d  is  to  provide  simplified  access  for  SMEs  to  financing \nopportunities. It identifies three priority areas to achieve strategic targets: \n\nImprove mechanisms for financing agriculture \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Boost agricultural insurance \n\u2022  Promote agricultural investments  \n\n3)  One of the five strategic targets in the \u201cStrategic Road Map for financial services\u201d \nis  to  develop  the  financial  markets.  It  identifies  three  priority  areas  to  achieve \nstrategic targets: \n\n\u2022  Create favorable environment for emitters and financial intermediaries; \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nIncrease access of investors to financial markets; \nIncrease active participation in inter-bank exchange market \n\nThe establishment of mechanisms and institutions to improve SME finance in Azerbaijan \nis currently carried out in accordance with the strategic targets of these Road Maps. \n\nFinancial inclusion is one of the priorities of the \u201cStrategic Road Map for the development \nof financial services in the Republic of Azerbaijan.\u201d The document notes that improving \nthe  access  to  finance  for  micro,  small  and  medium  enterprises  (MSMEs)  can  help  to \nincrease \nprovide  \na more productive distribution of resources in separate companies and across the whole \ncountry.  \n\nopportunities \n\nemployment \n\nproductivity, \n\nincrease \n\nand \n\nWomen\u2019s entrepreneurship is one of the main targets of the development in the Strategic \nRoad  Map  for  manufacture  of  consumer  goods  by  SMEs.\u201d Creating  incentive \nmechanisms for  the  development  of  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship, the  development  of \ninformation  support,  creation  of  business  incubators,  organizations,  associations,  and \nprofessional organizations are measures to be taken within the Road Map.  \n\nthe  prospects  of \n\nthe  money  market  and  partly \n\nThe development of financial services is also among the strategic goals of the Azerbaijan \ngovernment.  The  financial  services  market  plays  an  important  role  in  economic \ndevelopment, both in terms of access to essential financial resources of the economy or \nthe  formation  of  corporate  governance  culture  to  ensure  the  economy\u2019s  efficiency,  as \nwell as ensuring its participation in the global value chain through the domestic service \nmarkets. The strategic targets defined by the government in the Road Map are largely \nthe  \nassociated  with \nstock  market.  However,  the  formation  of  a  financial  market  that  supports  sustainable \neconomic development depends on the mutual activities and parallel development of the \nmonetary  and  capital  markets.  The  money  market  carries  out  the  accumulation  and \ndistribution  of  free  cash  as  a  debt  in  the  short  term,  and  serves  as  an  exchange  of \nresources. In the capital market, resources serve as a capital that increases their value, \nwhich is a \u201clong money\u201d market. But, for example, no strategic objectives, priorities and \nrelevant  indicators  have  been  reflected  in  the  said  Road  Map  for  the  development  of \nprivate  investment  funds  and  private  pension  funds,  which  are  very  important  capital \nmarket institutions. However, the number of investment funds and private pension funds \nto be formed potentially in the country for the next 20 years, as well as their possible \ncapitalization level, could be defined as target indicators. The Law on Labor Pensions \n(adopted in 2006), which provides legal opportunities for the creation of private pension \nfunds in the country, has been in effect for 11 years and the Law on Investment Funds \n(adopted in 2010) for 7 years. However, neither investment funds nor private pension \nfunds have been created in the country over the past period. Despite the fact that there \nis a separate law governing the activities of investment funds, the lack of capital markets \nand the lack of interest in companies to become a stock company are the main reasons \n\n33 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nfor the creation of investment funds. The main reason for the absence of private pension \nfunds is the low level of formal employment (33%). Records for employees of the public \nsector with a two-third  share of official employment are  maintained through the state-\nowned pension fund. \n\n7.2  Level of Policy, National or Otherwise \n\nThe regulatory acts regulating the enhancement of SMEs\u2019 access to financial resources \nare part of the country\u2019s national legislation and their implementation is mandatory in line \nwith  the  legislation.  The  Strategic  Road  Maps,  which  focus  on  the  development  \nof  various  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  the  financing  of  SMEs,  cover  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic outlook until 2020, long-term outlook by 2025 and target outlook \nfor the period after 2025. \n\n7.3  Institutions Involved \n\n\u201cThe  Strategic  Road  Map  for  manufacture  of  consumer  goods  by  SMEs\u201d  specifies  \nthe  institutions  providing  financial  services  for  SMEs.  They  are:  Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment  Fund  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan  (EDF),65 the  Azerbaijan  Export  and \nInvestment  Promotion  Foundation  (AZPROMO),  the  State  Agency  for  Agricultural \nCredits (SAAC), the State Fund for Development of \u0130nformation Technologies under the \nMinistry of Communications and High Technologies of the Republic of Azerbaijan (see: \nsection \u201c2.3. Financial Institutions Involved\u201d for more details). \n\nIn  addition,  the  state  bodies  such  as  CBAR,  FIMSA,  the  Ministry  of  Taxes,  the  State \nCustoms Committee, and the Ministry of Finance have been involved in the process. \n\nThe  Agency  for  Development  of  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  of  Azerbaijan  was \ncreated  under  a  Presidential  Decree  on  Further  Improving  the  Management  of  \nSmall-  and  Medium-sized  Businesses,  dated  28  December2017.  According  to  the \nDecree, the Agency will support the development of small and medium-sized businesses \nin the country and provide a range of, in particular, financial, services to the SMEs. To \nthat end, SME houses, State\u2212Entrepreneur Partnership Development Centre as well as \nSME development funds will be created under the Agency.66 \n\n7.4  Specific Strategies \n\nSupport for trade finance. Trade finance has developed in Azerbaijan in recent years, \nwith  its  products  offered  by  only  a  limited  number  of  banks.  There  are  no  specific \nstrategies that support trade finance in Azerbaijan. \n\nInterest  rate  subsidies.  One  of  the  requirements  in  the  \u201cStrategic  Road  Map  for \nmanufacture of consumer goods by SMEs\u201d is to establish the credit guarantee fund. In \naccordance  with  this,  \u201cAzerbaijan  Republic  Credit  Guarantee  Fund  Open  Joint  Stock \nCompany\u201d  was  created  under  a  Presidential  Decree,  dated  29  November  2017.  The \nlegislation was amended under another Presidential Decree dated 25 December 2017 \nand the Azerbaijan Mortgage and Credit Guarantee Fund CJSC was established through \nthe  merger  of  the  Azerbaijan  Mortgage  Fund  and  the  Credit  Guarantee  Fund. 67 The \nFund\u2019s  major  objective \nfor  manat  \nto  provide  guarantees \nis \n                                                 \n65  The  public  legal  entity  Entrepreneurship  Development  Fund  was  renamed  from  the  National  Fund  for \n\nto  entrepreneurs \n\nEntrepreneurship Support on 21 July 2018. \n\n66  http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/37470. \n67  http://mcgf.az/?/en/mainpage//. \n\n34 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nloans  taken  from  authorized  banks,  and  grant  subsidies  for  a  part  of  the  interest \ncalculated on these loans. The Rules \u201cOn Subsidizing interest rates on loans received \nby  entrepreneurs  in  manats\u201d  were  approved  under  a  Presidential  Decree,  dated  \n29 November 2017. According to the Rules, the amount of secured loans is AZN30,000 \nto AZN5,000,000. The interest subsidy term for loans of up to three years is 8% per year \nand 10% for loans of over three years. Notably, the interest subsidy is provided for loans \nwith annual interest rates not exceeding 20%. The interest rate subsidy does not apply \nto concessional loans provided through the government\u2019s financial resources. \n\nSince  its  launch,  entrepreneurs  have  received  AZN17.5  million  in  loans  thanks  to  \nthe guarantees issued by the Fund. At present, a system of automation of guarantee and \ninterest subsidy provision is created to simplify the access of entrepreneurs, including \nSMEs,  to  lending  and  to  secure  the  transparency  and  efficiency  during  the  appeal \nprocess. The electronic system will be put into operation in the second quarter of 2019.68  \n\nCredit  databases.  Loans  in  Azerbaijan  had  been  long  governed  by  the  Centralized \nCredit Registry (CCR), which was established under the CBAR in 2005. The nature of \ndata submissions and submission procedures for the CCR are governed by the Law of \nAzerbaijan  On  Banks  (Article  35.4)  and  the  Law  of  Azerbaijan  On  Non-bank  Credit \nInstitutions (Article 22.1). Currently, the CCR is operating within the FIMSA.69  \n\nOn 28 October 2016, the Law on Credit Bureaus was adopted, paving the way for the \ncreation  of  a  legal  base  for  private  credit  bureaus.  In  December  2017,  eight  banks \ndecided to establish the first private bureau \u2013 the Azerbaijan Credit Bureau LLC (ACB),70 \nwhich started functioning on 15 January 2018 and providing access to debt obligation \ndetails to data users from 6 March 2018. The CCR no longer provides users\u2019 access to \ndata, pursuant to Article 23.3 of the Law On Credit Bureaus of Azerbaijan from 1 April \n2018. \n\n7.5  Assessment of Effectiveness, Gaps, Issues \n\nIn Azerbaijan, SMEs have not been marked as target groups in legislative acts related \nto business financing until recent years. Although the objective of EDF at the Ministry of \nEconomy is to finance SMEs, its major beneficiaries have been large and medium-sized \nenterprises. In addition, in particular, small enterprises have been unable to access the \nconcessional lending source provided by the government. Moreover, the Fund has not \ngiven  sufficient  priority  to  attention  to  SME  finance  since  it  operates  as  a  public  legal \nentity endorsed under the Presidential Decree, dated 31 July 2018. \n\nSmall enterprises have been outside areas of special state concern in Azerbaijan. The \nLaw on State Support for Small Entrepreneurship of the Republic of Azerbaijan, adopted \n4 June 1999, stipulates small enterprises\u2019 access to concessional financing as the main \ndirections of state aid, yet its implementation has not been ensured.  \n\nThe  document  \u201cPrimary  Directions  of  Strategic  Roadmaps  for  National  Economy  and \nMain Sectors of Economy,\u201d endorsed under a Presidential Decree on 6 December 2016, \nas  a  legal  framework,  was  geared  to  supporting  some  mechanisms.  A  number  of \nlegislative acts were adopted to ensure the creation of the lending base and guarantee \nmechanism in accordance with the Road Maps. The law on Encumbrance of Movable \nProperty  has  been  adopted  to  increase  the  accessibility  of  SMEs  to  secured  loans, \nbecause  a  lack  of  a  unified  system  for  the  registry  of  movable  property  had  hindered \n\n                                                 \n68  http://mcgf.az/post/563. \n69  https://www.fimsa.az/en/centralized-credit-registry. \n70  https://www.azernews.az/business/124329.html. \n\n35 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\nAliyev \n\nfinancial institutions in lending more funds to small enterprises secured by their movable \nassets. The World Bank 71 reports that of SME assets in Azerbaijan, only 22% are land \nand  property,  while  34  and  44%  are  accounts  receivable,  and  plant  and  equipment, \naccordingly. \n\nThe State Registry of the Encumbrance [of Movable Property] has been operating since \n15 March 2018, introduced by the law. The Registry was established to enhance SMEs\u2019 \naccessibility to financing and enable them to take loans through any movable property \nas collateral. The Registry\u2019s activity is still limited.  \n\nIn  general,  the  institutions  \u2212  including  the  Credit  Guarantee  Fund,  Azerbaijan  Credit \nBureau,  the  Registry  of  the  Encumbrance  of  Movable  Property\u2014geared  to  increasing \nSME finance have been recently established and therefore the scope of their activities \nis limited. So, at this early stage, it is premature to assess the efficiency of their work.  \n\n8.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n8.1  Conclusions \n\nAlthough  the  number  of  SMEs  in  Azerbaijan  is  increasing,  their  contribution  to  the \ncountry\u2019s economy is insignificant. One of the factors that hampers the development of \nSMEs is their poor access to finance. While assessing the business environment in the \ncountry,  both  international  and  local  organizations  point  to  the  difficulty  SMEs  face  in \nattracting finance to enhance their business. \n\nThe SMEs in Azerbaijan mainly prefer bank loans as external funding sources. However, \nhigh  loan  rates,  the  severity  of  conditions,  a  shortage  of  the  required  amount,  and \nreduced grace periods weaken SMEs\u2019 access to this kind of finance. The experience of \nsecuring finance from the alternative securities market is not at the level of small and \nmedium enterprises. A lack of SME interest in transparency and accountability limits their \nability to benefit from financial market sources. \n\nState  support  mechanisms  have  been  established  in  the  country  to  ensure  SME \ndevelopment  and  finance,  resulting  in  the  functioning  of  a  number  of  institutions. \nHowever,  these  institutions  are  unable  to  fully  support  the  finance  required  by  \nthe market. On the other hand, large enterprises are gradually driving SMEs out of state \nsupport. \n\nOne of the key areas of the Azerbaijan economy\u2019s participation in the global value chain \nis the agrarian sector. However, our surveys found that the banks are most interested in \nfinancing the trade or food service, which are the end stage in the value chain. Although \nthe financial institutions established by the state prefer to issue preferential loans for the \nagricultural sector, the share of the agrarian sector in total lending is low because of the \nhigh risk in the sector. \n\nA preference of banks for secured loans, the lack of full functioning of movable property\u2019s \ncollateral mechanism, and shortcomings in this mechanism as a whole, reduce SMEs\u2019 \naccess to secured loans. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n71  https://mpcr.fimsa.az/en/about. \n\n36 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 973 \n \n\n8.2  Recommendations \n\nAliyev \n\nIt  would  be  appropriate  to  initiate  the  following  steps  to  increase  SMEs\u2019  access  \nto finance: \n\n\u2022  Apply Islamic banking through providing support to the development of Islamic \nfinancial  mechanisms  and  institutions  by  amending  the  existing  legislation.  It \nshould be approved by separate legislation, such as a Law on Islamic Banking or \ncan  be  included  in  a  special  section  of  the  Law  on  Banking  to  allow  credit \norganizations to conduct Islamic banking; \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nImprove the collateral mechanism in the banking sector to facilitate SMEs\u2019 \naccess to lending. This involves improving the process of pledging property and \ndecreasing its term, including the number of court procedures.  \n\nImplement a mechanism for venture financing to meet risks SME innovative \nstart-ups may be exposed to. The legislative framework is being improved to \ndevelop  start-ups,  and  to  stimulate  innovative  investment.
