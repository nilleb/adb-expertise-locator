He elaborated principles for defining genera and species of organisms and a uniform \nsystem for naming them: binomial (two-name) nomenclature\u2014the first part is the genus, followed by the \nspecies. He is considered one of the fathers of modern ecology.\n3   Of course, almost anything\u2014animate objects, concepts, events, inanimate objects, places, properties, and \nrelationships\u2014can be classified according to some taxonomic scheme. Some have explained that the human \nmind naturally organizes its knowledge of the world with such constructs, themselves shaped by local cultural \nand social systems.", "Knowledge \nSolutions\nThe idea that information can be depicted \nFigure: Simple Taxonomy Development Cycle\nas a tree is an old chestnut.4 With the advent \nof the internet, however, the need to classify  Engage\nand categorize it has become even more ur- Stakeholders\ngent: beyond parent\u2013child hierarchies, taxo- Clarify\nSecure\nPurpose\nnomic schemes can now depict networks of  Governance\nand Scope\nrelationships as well as the intensity of these.5 \nTaxonomies will always matter because they \nRefine Determine\nhelp categorize information.

What is more, it can be \nPilot Design\nclassified with ease in myriad categories. (A \nTaxonomy Approach\nbook can only be placed in one place on a \nshelf.) Hence, organizations must move from  Collect and\nnurturing trees to managing windswept piles of  Categorize\nleaves under the watchful eye of the Semantic \nSource: Author\nWeb.6 (Tags mean that users regulate informa-\ntion. Much as search engines do, this provides clues about what content has been deemed useful.) They must \nnow work with taxonomies7 every day to maximize the value and capability of their business, or function \nunsustainably under par for lack of ability to index, retrieve, organize, and help navigate knowledge assets. \nTaxonomy work is strategic work.\nIt's All About Context and Sense Making\nTaxonomies are not artifacts for safekeeping: they adapt and change in coevolution with the efforts of users to \nmake sense of ambiguity, emergence, and uncertainty in their environment.8 (Therefore, effective taxonomies \nare extensible over time.) To begin, however, context drives information needs, which in turn spur the identi-\nfication, creation, storage, sharing, and use of content. Logically, then, the availability of (or need for) content \ncoupled with the information-seeking behaviors of users should influence the design and upkeep of taxonomies. \nNext, values or terms from the taxonomies must be applied to content.9 (Logically, values or terms from the \ntaxonomies should also be applied to staff profile pages.) And, as knowledge of information-seeking behaviors \nis garnered and staff profile pages expand, it becomes possible to both refine taxonomies and tag knowledge \n4   The proverbial tree of knowledge bore many fruits: from hierarchies of organisms to offices and departments, we have fashioned life in tree-\nlike ways, expediently forgetting that classification systems are neither value-free nor objectively true. \n5   In Web 2.0 applications, tag (or word) clouds lead to collections of items that are associated with a particular tag. (Here, the notion of \nfolksonomy is important: a folksonomy is a type of distributed system of categorization for ascribing and managing tags to online items \nsuch as images, videos, bookmarks, and text. Typically, users freely select tags from a chosen set of keywords, category names, or metadata. \nExamples of folksonomy systems are Delicious and Flickr, available at www.delicious.com and www.flickr.com, respectively.) Admittedly, low-\nquality tags are no replacement for formal systems: however, it may well be their emergent quality and openness that makes folksonomy \ntagging so useful; the tags that users select and attach can always be refined. There is also scope for improving tag literacy; the community \nwould need to set rules and agree on standards for tags.\n6   Rendering taxonomy web-based is inevitable and desirable in equal measure. The Semantic Web is a group of methods and technologies \nthat would allow machines to understand the meaning, or \u201csemantics\u201d, of information on the internet. Beyond Web 2.0\u2019s participatory \ntechnologies and social networks, the vision of the Semantic Web, aka Web 3.0, is to link metadata in such ways that it can easily be \nprocessed by machines on a global scale. It lies where computers, not humans, generate new information.\n7   These Knowledge Solutions use the term \u201ctaxonomy\u201d inclusively to refer to any classified collection of elements, be it descriptive\u2014meaning \nlabeled or tagged, or navigational\u2014that is, aimed at facilitating the discovery of information through browsing. (Ontologies, which are \nused to reason about the properties of a domain and may be used to describe it, and mind maps, which involve considerable human \ninterpretation, lie at the polar extremes of formality and potential for inference.)\n8   That is a function of the organizational context, organizational knowledge, inter- and intra-organizational relationships, and the external \nenvironment. Taxonomy must be structured around people (both at the individual and at the community levels), their ideas and activities, \nand the information systems and technologies that are available to them.\n9   In most instances, one can directly apply values or terms from taxonomies through metadata tags or by adding properties to files. One can \nalso apply metadata tags indirectly by storing values or terms separately from content but by providing a pointer to that. (Content registries, \nmetadata registries, and library catalogs are examples of indirect application.)\n2", "Taxonomies for Development\nworkers with metadata to identify them to other users and \u201cpush\u201d what data, information, and knowledge \nwill help them create situational awareness and understanding in complicated or complex situations so that \nthey may make decisions.10 \nTable: Essential Steps to Taxonomy Design\nAssign Roles (and Associated Responsibilities)\n\u2022  The role of a governance board is to define strategy and appropriate types of content.\n\u2022  The function of a taxonomy team, comprising 6\u201312 members, is to ensure the value of content placement and \nmetadata.\n\u2022  Content owners prepare content and apply metadata.\n\u2022  Content managers edit and approve content.\nKnow Your Content\n\u2022  Clean out obsolete content.\n\u2022  Strive for topical taxonomy, with attention to scope, use, complexity, and scalability.\n\u2022  Give every item one correct categorization.\n\u2022  Accept that items can be organized in multiple categories.\n\u2022  Minimize the number of \u201cclicks\u201d.\n\u2022  Build in flexibility and redundancy.\n\u2022  Understand that it takes time to tag (or re-tag) content.\nBefore Getting Started, Understand Your\n\u2022  Business context and priorities\n\u2022  Knowledge workers\n\u2022  Content\n\u2022  Clients, audiences, and partners\n\u2022  Information systems and technologies\n\u2022  Limitations\nGet Started\n\u2022  Seek inspiration from existing taxonomic schemes: much taxonomy, unitary or not, already resides on the \ninternet.\n\u2022  Focus on primary, top-level concepts.\n\u2022  Keep the taxonomy broad, simple, shallow, and elegant.\n\u2022  Decide on standards values or terms that can be applied logically and consistently across different types of \nitems.

A vital ingredient of that is a taxonomy with which to classify data, information, and knowledge in \nan ordered system that indicates natural relationships. In 2004, Knowledge Management in ADBb characterized \nthe variety of knowledge products and services that ADB provides to its developing member countries and \nother stakeholders as (i) formal knowledge products and services, that are programmed as such and targeted \nat clients, audiences, and partners; and (ii) knowledge by-products derived from delivering loans or other \nactivities.c To note, the framework document did not consider what data, information, and knowledge\u2014\nincluding their flows\u2014ADB rests on, that must be continuously enriched and facilitated to operate ADB itself \nas a learning organization. \nMore recent documents, expressly Enhancing Knowledge Management under Strategy 2020: Plan of \nAction for 2009\u20132011d and the attendant Knowledge Management Results Framework,e are testimony to \nthe fact that ADB feels it can manage knowledge better, ultimately to the benefit of its developing member \ncountries. However, in spite of noteworthy recent accomplishments, a sense of dissatisfaction remains due \nto the drive for unremitting improvement that is inherent to any knowledge strategy. One area of concern is \nADB\u2019s knowledge taxonomy, which many if not all consider unrepresentative, unwieldy,  and, frankly, unin-\nformative.f With rapid changes in the demand for ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services in countries such \nas the People\u2019s Republic of China and India but elsewhere in general, ADB must think hard about how best \nto classify, describe, and map its most precious resource. (ADB\u2019s core assets might be described as financing, \nknowledge, and convening power.) Fast-transforming information systems and technologies, including the \nadvent of Web. 2.0 and the Semantic Web, leave it no choice.\na  Applications are well-nigh innumerable. They include policy and strategy formulation, strategic communication, business process \nformulation and implementation, corporate reporting, managing for results, staff learning and development, country partnership \nstrategy formulation, policy dialogue, lending and nonlending activities, partnership building, effective knowledge management, \nproject administration, and monitoring and evaluation for learning and accountability.\nb   ADB. 2004. Knowledge Management in ADB. Manila. Available: www.adb.org/knowledge-management/knowledge-framework.asp\nc  ADB\u2019s classification echoes a tendency to prioritize value-generating types of knowledge, specifically, the expertise that enables an \norganization to achieve its goals.\nd   Available: www.adb.org/knowledge-management/action-plan.asp.

The framework document is reproduced in ADB. 2010. \nCrafting a Knowledge Management Results Framework. Manila. Available: www.adb.org/documents/information/knowledge-solutions/\ncrafting-a-knowledge-management-results-framework.pdf\nf   If taxonomies classify, describe, and map knowledge domains, taxonomy work is what one must do to achieve that outcome. The list \nof activities includes listing, creating and modifying categories, standardizing, mapping, representing, discovering native vocabularies \nand categories, and negotiating common terms. From this perspective, the classification proposed in Knowledge Management in \nADB is unsophisticated. The application of taxonomies to organizations is more than the mere cataloging or indexing of documents. \nThis is evident from the distinction between information management\u2014which is the collection and management of information \nfrom one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more audiences\u2014and knowledge management\u2014which \ncomprises a range of strategies and practices to identify, create, store, share, and use knowledge to support decisions and related tasks. \nFrom this, Patrick Lambe distinguishes three kinds of taxonomies: (i) objective taxonomies, usually of physical things, e.g., biological \nspecies, books; (ii) \u201cembedded\u201d taxonomies of how an organization has always done things (and often taken that for granted); and \n(iii) negotiated taxonomies based on stakeholder agreement or social negotiation. He sees that different kinds of taxonomies can (i) \nstructure and organize (both things and processes), (ii) establish common ground, (iii) span boundaries between groups, (iv) help \nin sense making, and (v) aid in the discovery of risk and opportunity.

Neal-Schuman Publishers.\n4 5 ", "Taxonomies for Development\nIn 2010, the Knowledge Management Center in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nin ADB brainstormed on a possible classification of knowledge. It intuited that ADB\u2019s knowledge falls into \nfour categories that marry tacit and explicit forms:\n\u2022\t Lending and Nonlending Operations Knowledge. This is largely tacit, even if official knowledge \nproducts are strictly codified and there is much potential to better learn before, during, and after \nimplementation in more explicit ways.\n\u2022\t Sector and Thematic Knowledge. This is largely tacit, but communities and networks of practice \nincreasingly offer ways to make that know-how explicit. More and more, strategic partnerships include \nknowledge components too.\n\u2022\t Research Knowledge. This is primarily explicit. However, staff also hold a wealth of tacit research \nknow-how in their subject areas and research methods, as well as insights about how their work fits into \nthe wider development context.\n\u2022\t Business and Corporate Knowledge. This is primarily explicit know-how about the corporate \nframework,  for  example,  operational  policies,  operational  procedures,  project  administration \ninstructions, and business processes. Much codified project-management knowledge lies in databases. \nTacit \u201cstreet-wise\u201d knowledge also exists.\nThe study of ADB\u2019s knowledge taxonomy purports to explore, recommend, and draw implications from \na classification of knowledge products and services that improves ADB\u2019s organizational efficiency from \ninternal and external perspectives.

Who provides it and how does it arrive? \nHow is it improved and reused? What happens to new knowledge that is created? What hinders ADB from doing more, better, faster? \nHow can knowledge flows (therefore) be improved?\nj   Since staff numbers and the range of subject matters in ADB are high, the approach to the conduct of interviews will involve a mix of \nrepresentative interviews and the use of an online questionnaire.\nk   Gaps in the suggested categories can be elicited through the online questionnaire.\n5", "Knowledge \nSolutions\napproach to the study will focus on a series of interviews that will address the challenge from two angles:\n\u2022   Using a typical decision as a starting point, tracking back to the factors that influence it to understand \nwhere ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services fit.\n\u2022   Using ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services as starting points, tracking forward to understand the \nways in which these are used and influence the work of ADB staff and other users of the said knowledge \nproducts and services.\nWithin the context of assessing the influence of knowledge on policy and practice, these methods tend to \nunderestimate and overestimate, respectively, the state of affairs. Hence, by approaching the topic from both \nperspectives, it will be possible to work toward a balanced understanding based on triangulation of findings \nfrom interviewees (as well as between interviewees).\nTo cover the first angle, questions will draw on good practice for understanding real-world decision-\nmaking, as seen in works such as those of Cynthia Kurtz and David Snowdenl and Gary Klein,m as well \nas a decision making typology recently developed for a study of how the United Kingdom\u2019s Department \nfor International Development learns from research and evaluations. Questions will be fairly open to delve \ninto how interviewees typically approach decisions in a real-world context, in order to draw out the ways \nin which they use different knowledge products and services in their everyday work. The interviews will \nbe sensitive to a number of theoretical issues in this area that should aid the analysis, for example: differ-\nent phases of policy decision making (e.g., agenda formulation, implementation, and evaluation); decision \nregimes (e.g., routine, incremental, fundamental, and emergent); and learning styles (e.g., activist, reflector, \ntheorist, and pragmatist).\nTo cover the second angle, questions will be developed around a \u201ctheory of change\u201d concerning how \nknowledge is used in ADB. This approach is suitable for understanding complex issues and involves identi-\nfying expectations about how ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services are expected to contribute to lesson \nlearning and, eventually, better practice; through what processes and mechanisms; and with what inter-\nmediate outcomes. Analyzing whether these processes are functioning, or whether different intermediate \noutcomes are occurring, will help analyze the relevance and usefulness of the current knowledge taxonomy, \nand will provide crucial insights into how that could be improved\u2014or how the current taxonomy might be \nbetter employed.\nWhere possible, the interviews will identify a few examples of ADB knowledge products and services, \nor particular policy processes, and delve into these in slightly more depth to provide examples in the final \nreport. This approach will help deliver some components of a knowledge audit, viz., knowledge needs analy-\nsis and knowledge flow analysis\u2014but not knowledge mapping nor a knowledge inventory. The knowledge \ninventory and mapping will need to be taken from the literature and provided by ADB. It is this inventory \n(and its knowledge taxonomy) that will be under review during the study.\nl   Cynthia Kurtz and David Snowden. 2003.
