INTRODUCTION \nIncreasing inequality has been a very serious concern for many people including policy \nmakers  and  researchers  in  the  world.  Thomas  Piketty\u2019s  book  titled  Capital  in  the \nTwenty-First  Century,1 which  analyzes  the  growing  asset  inequality  in  developed \ncountries, sold over 1.5 million copies (as of January 2015) throughout the world. One \nof the most contentious issues in the United States (US) Presidential election is the \ngrowing income gap between the rich and the poor. According to Saez (2015), the \nshare of income held by the richest 1% of the population in total increased from 8.95% \nin 1978 to 21.24% in 2014 in the US. \nIncreasing inequality has been a serious issue in the developing countries as well. The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of the China (PRC) and India, two rapidly growing giant economies, \nhave  been  reported  to  experience  substantial  increases  in  inequality.  In  terms  of \neconomic growth, the PRC and India have been regarded as successful cases, but in \nterms of quality of economic growth they appear to suffer from various problems such \nas growing inequality and environmental problems. It is not only the PRC and India that \nare faced with growing inequality but other developing countries as well.  \nAchieving  equitable  and  balanced  growth  is  important  for  the  people,  society,  and \ngovernment. Growing inequality would lead to social unrest and political instability, \nwhich in turn would undermine economic growth. Indeed, recognizing the importance of \nreversing the trend of increasing inequality in developing countries, the United Nations \nhas included reducing inequality as one of 17 sustainable development goals.2 \nWhile the world has been witnessing growing inequality in recent decades, it is also \nexperiencing  rapid  globalization  of  economic  activities  through  the  means  of \ninternational trade and international investment, particularly in the form of foreign direct \ninvestment  (FDI).  The  share  of  trade  (exports+imports)  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  (trade\u2013GDP  ratio)  for  developing  and  developed  countries  increased  more  \nor less continuously from the late 1960s through 2014 (Figure 1). Specifically, the \ntrade\u2013GDP ratios for the developing and developed countries increased from 29.9 and \n36.9% in 1980 to 51.3 and 45.7% in 2000, respectively, and then further to 55.2% and \n55.3% in 2014. Major drivers of the increase in trade\u2013GDP ratios include trade and FDI \nliberalization,  and  reduction  in  transportation  costs  by  technological  progress  and \nderegulation in transportation services sectors.3  \nGrowing inequality and rapid globalization have been observed in tandem, as such \nglobalization has often been accused of worsening inequality. Indeed, anti-globalists, \nmany  of  whom  are  concerned  with  growing  inequality,  have  held  a  number  of \ndemonstrations against the meetings organized by the World Trade Organization, the \nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations as \nwell  as  developed  countries  such  as  G-7  Summits, which  are  considered  to  have \npromoted globalization.  \n   \n                                              \n1  Its original French version was published in 2013.

We analyze the impacts of \ninternational trade  on inequalities from the following perspectives.5 In section  2 we \nexamine the impacts of international trade from the global perspective. Specifically,  \nwe first analyze inequalities between developing and developed countries, and then \nglobal inequalities, which are measured as if the world is treated as one country or one \nentity. In section 3 we turn to within-country income inequality, while in section 4 we \nanalyze wage inequality, which is a major component of income inequality, in depth.  \nIn  section  5  regional  inequalities  within countries  are  examined.  The  final  section, \nsection 6,  concludes  the  paper  by  summarizing the  findings  and  providing  several \npolicy implications. \n2.  INEQUALITY FROM THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE \nInequality from the global perspective can be examined in several ways. One may \ncompare an average per capita income of a country with that of another country, and \nexamine if the gap has widened or narrowed over time. In this approach the unit of \ncomparison is a country or a group of countries such as developing and developed \ncountries. Another approach is to consider all the people in the world as individuals  \nor  world  citizens  and  measure  inequality  among  those  individuals.  The  measured \ninequality may be considered as the global inequality. In this section both approaches \nare used to find out about inequality in the world. One may find that global inequality be \n                                              \n4  For developing countries, consumption rather than income is a better indicator of measuring inequality \nbecause many households are engaged in self-employment and self-consumption, which are not \ncaptured by the statistics on income. But most studies use income or wage statistics rather than \nconsumption statistics because of the limited availability of consumption data. \n5  See Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) and Goldberg (2015) for a survey of the literature. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \ndecomposed into cross-country equality, which will be investigated in section 2.1 and \nwithin-country inequality, which will be examined in section 3. \n2.1  Inequality between Developing and Developed Countries \nInequality between the rich (developed) countries and the poor (developing) countries \nhas  been  a  contentious  issue  for  many  decades.  International  trade  has  been \nconsidered to play an important role in influencing this inequality. Some observers \nargue that developing countries are exploited by developed countries as developing \ncountries are trapped in a trading system where developing countries export primary \nproducts such as natural resources to developed countries while developing countries \nimport industrial products from developed countries. And the terms of trade of primary \nproducts  vis-\u00e0-vis  industrial  products  tend  to  worsen  over  time  (Prebisch\u2013Singer \nHypothesis).6 According to this view, trade widens inequality between the developed \nand developing countries. \nHowever, there has been a totally opposing view, which argues that trade is an engine \nof economic growth,7 thus trade can reduce the inequality between the developed and \ndeveloping countries, if developing countries successfully expand trade. Expansion of \nexports enables the developing countries to earn foreign exchange, with which they \ncan import raw materials, intermediate goods, capital goods, technology, and other \nitems, which can be used to promote economic growth. Export expansion also enables \nexporting firms to gain benefits from economies of scale  and improve productivity, \nthereby contributing to economic growth. \nAs seen in the above discussions, in theory the impacts of trade on economic growth \ncan be positive and negative. In light of this observation, we review the  empirical \nstudies that examined the impacts of trade on economic growth with a focus on the \nrelationship between developing and developed countries. \nDollar (2005) compares per capita GDP growth rates of the developing and developed \ncountries  from  the  1960s  through  1990s  for  about  100  countries  using  the  data \nobtained from the Penn World Tables. He found that per capita growth rates gradually \ndeclined in developed countries while accelerating in developing countries. During the \n1960s  growth  of  OECD  countries  was  about  twice  as  fast  as  that  of  developing \ncountries.  During  the  1970s  and  1980s  growth  of  developed  countries  declined \nsignificantly while growth of developing countries remained more or less at around the \nsame  level.  The  1990s  saw  a  dramatic  increase  in  growth  rate  of  the  developing \ncountries while growth rate of the developed countries continued to decline. Indeed, the \ngrowth rate of developing countries was twice as high as that of developed countries in \nthe 1990s. \nA similar pattern of the reversal of GDP per capita growth rates between developed \nand developing countries in the 1990s can be seen in Figure 2. The data are taken \nfrom the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators. After a substantial decline from \nthe 1970s to the 1980s, GDP per capita growth rate of the developing countries began \nto increase in the 1990s and then it increased remarkably in the 2000s. By contrast, \nGDP per capita growth rate of the OECD countries declined continuously from the \n1980s to 2014. Indeed, there is a wide divergence in the average annual GDP per \ncapita growth rates for the 2000\u20132014 period between the developing  countries at \n4.5% and OECD countries at 0.9%. These developments of GDP per capita growth for \n                                              \n6  On the Prebisch\u2013Singer hypothesis and its validity, see, for example, Harvey et al. (2010). \n7  See, for example, the World Bank (1993). \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \ndeveloping and developed countries resulted in the narrowing of the GDP per capita \ngap between them. GDP per capita of developed countries was 24 times as high as \nthat of developing countries in 1970, but the gap declined to 15 times in 2014. \nFigure 2: GDP per Capita Growth Rates for Developed and Developing Countries \n \nSource: Computed from the World Bank, World Development Indicators on line (accessed 16 April 2016). \nA  comparison  of  per  capita  GDP  growth  of  developing  and  developed  countries \nrevealed that inequality between them declined in recent decades, especially in the \n2000s. Recognizing the increasing trend of trade\u2013GDP ratio during the period shown in \nthe previous section, one may argue that trade contributed to the rise in per capita \nGDP growth rates, particularly for the developing counties, thus contributing to the \nnarrowing gap. The validity of this assertion has to be examined by conducting rigorous \nstatistical analyses. A number of empirical studies have been conducted to examine \nthe impacts of foreign trade on economic growth during the last 2 decades, but no \nconclusive evidence has been presented yet. We review several important studies on \nthis subject below.8 \n                                              \n8  The issue of the impact of trade on economic growth has also been analyzed from the trade policy \nperspectives. For such studies, the main issue is whether trade liberalization promotes economic \ngrowth. There have been a large number of empirical studies on this issue. The results from growth \nregression analyses vary depending on the indicators of trade policy, types of regressions methods, \nperiods of analysis, and others. Sachs and Warner (1995), which is one of the most influential papers \non this issue, found that trade liberalization promoted economic growth. Wacziarg and Welch (2008) \nextended the Sachs and Warner study by dealing with criticisms and showed positive impacts of trade \nliberalization on economic growth. For critical discussions of the previous studies based on growth \nregressions, see, for example, Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) and Rodriguez (2007), which did not find \ngrowth promoting effect of trade liberalization. Major criticisms include incorrect indicators of trade policy \nand  inappropriate  econometric  treatment.  Some opponents  of  growth  regressions, which include \nSrinivasan and Bhagwati (1999), advocate country-level case studies. The result of country case \nstudies such as Krueger (1978) in general support outward-orientation trade policy for achieving \neconomic growth. It should be noted that the study of trade policy on economic growth and the study of \ntrade openness (trade/GDP) on economic growth are closely related but their meaning is different. One \nobvious reason for the difference is that trade liberalization, say reduction in tariff rates, does not \nnecessarily increase trade/GDP ratio because the tariff rate is only one factor among many such as the \nexchange rate that affect trade/GDP ratio. \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nA  typical  growth  regression  has  growth  rate  in  terms  of  per  capita  GDP  as  the \ndependent variable and it has its initial level and a wide variety of control variables \nincluding trade and investment as explanatory variables. One of the early studies was \nthe  World  Bank  (1993).  Using  the  data  covering  88  countries  for  1960\u201385,  they \nconducted a regression analysis of the determinants of real per capita GDP growth and \nfound that trade\u2013GDP ratio had a significantly positive impact. Many studies found \nsignificant positive correlations between per capita GDP growth rate and trade\u2013GDP \nratio.9 However, several econometric problems concerning growth regression including \nthe problems of endogeneity and correlated individual effects were pointed out.10 \nSeveral studies were undertaken that dealt with these problems. Frankel and Romer \n(1999) investigated the impact of international trade on per capita income by dealing \nwith the endogeneity problem in that countries whose incomes are high for reasons \nother than trade may trade more. Analyzing the data from 150 countries for 1985 by \nusing the instrumental variable estimation method, Frankel and Romer found that trade \nhas a positive impact on income, although the estimated coefficient was moderately \nstatistically significant. Dollar and Kraay (2004) conducted a regression analysis by \nadopting instrumental variables estimation to deal with endogeneity problem and by \ntaking the differences of the variables to deal with the problem of correlated individual \neffects. In their analysis, the explanatory variables include lagged growth, changes  \nin trade volumes, and changes in policy and non-policy variables affecting growth.11 \nThe results of the estimation analyzing the growth rates in the 1980s and the 1990s for \nroughly  100  countries  found  that  the  change  in  trade  volume  had  a  positive  and \nsignificant impact on growth.  \nDespite several attempts to deal with the problems raised by the critics, these authors \ndo  not  seem  to  be  successful  in  dealing  with  the  problems  raised  by  the  critics. \nRodriguez (2007) reviewed some major studies including Dollar and Kraay (2004) and \nfound that these studies did not deal with the problems successfully. Rodriguez asserts \nthat one of the reasons why it is so hard to reach definitive conclusions regarding the \ntrade\u2013growth  link  is  the  complex  web  of  interrelationships  that  is  involved  in  the \ndetermination of a nation\u2019s income. Rodriguez pointed out geography and institutions, \nwhich would affect trade as well as economic growth. As such, these factors need to be \nconsidered in the regression analysis. Another issue that Rodriguez raised is the period \nof analysis. Using the more recent data covering the 1990\u20132003 period rather than the \n1980s  and  1990s  as  in  the  earlier  studies,  Rodriguez  preformed  a  first-difference \nregression analysis, similar to the approach adopted by Dollar and Kraay (2004). He \nalso added more control variables such as those associated with institutions, and he \nfound that trade/GDP ratio to be mostly positive but statistically insignificant. \nA brief survey of the previous studies on the impacts of trade on economic growth \nrevealed that the strong positive impacts found in early studies turned out to be not \nrobust. The results  of the survey  are not  encouraging for the proponents of trade \npromoting policies. There still remains a need for further analysis on the impacts of \ntrade and economic growth. A recent study on the impacts of trade on poverty in Africa \nby Goff and Singh (2013) shows possible perspectives that need to be considered for \ndiscerning the impacts of trade on growth. Analyzing the panel data covering 30 African \ncountries over the period 1981\u20132010, they found that impacts of trade on poverty were \nnegative, meaning that trade increases poverty, but trade is found to reduce poverty in \ncountries where financial sectors are deep, education levels are high, and governance \n                                              \n9  See Winters (2004) for a survey. \n10  See Caselli, Esquivel and Lefort (1996) on these points. \n11  Specifically, institutional quality government consumption, monetary policy, and political stability. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nis strong. These findings point to the need for accompanying policies/institutions to \ntrade promoting policies, to achieve economic growth. With these policies, reallocation \nof resources from less productive sectors to more promising sectors will be enhanced, \nto result in economic growth \nAlthough  the  previous  empirical  studies  analyzing  macroeconomic  variables  have \nshown mixed results of the impacts of trade on economic growth, various reasons for \npossible positive impacts have been pointed out in the discussions on this issue. One \nof the most important reasons is productivity enhancing effects of trade, i.e., exports \nand imports. This relationship was detected in earlier studies using macro as well as \nsectoral  data  but  the  lack  of  appropriate  theory  and  necessary  data  precluded \nresearchers from establishing the causal relationships empirically.12 It was the advent \nof the heterogeneous firm and trade model, developed by Melitz (2003), and availability \nof  firm-level  data,  that  enabled  researchers  to  discern  how  aggregate  economy  is \naffected by an  expansion in trade  and/or trade liberalization. Several studies have \nfound that exporting resulted in an improvement in productivity of exporting firms, or the \npresence of the \u201clearning by exporting\u201d effect.13 The sources of productivity enhancing \neffect of exporting firms may include economies of scale and acquisition of advanced \ntechnology in foreign market, which may be obtained by exporting. Increased imports \nare found to contribute to increase productivity of local firms. Amiti and Konings (2007) \nargued  that  trade  liberalization  in  Indonesia  raised  productivity  of  local  firms  as  it \nenabled local firms to use a greater variety of imported intermediate inputs. We will \ncome back to this issue, when we discuss wage inequality.  \n2.2  Global Inequality \nIn section 2.1 we saw that inequality between the developing and developed countries \nin terms of per capita GDP narrowed in recent decades. In this section we examine \nhow  global  inequality  changed  in  recent  decades  and  examine  the  impact  of \nglobalization  on global inequality.  According to Bourguignon  and Morrisson (2002), \nglobal inequality rose from 1820 to 1980 as their estimates of the global Gini coefficient \nincreased from 50 to 65 during the 1820\u20131980 period. For the period after the 1980s, \nvarious estimates have been made with mixed results in terms of the direction of the \nchange. Bhalla (2002) estimated the global Gini coefficient and found that it declined \nfrom 67 in 1980 to 64 in 2000. Sala-i-Martin (2002) also found a decline. By contrast, \nBourguignon and Morrisson find the Gini coefficient to remain at 65.7 in 1980 and \n1992, while Milanovic (2002) finds an increase of about 3 Gini points from 62.5 in 1988 \nto 65.9 in 1993, which is followed by a decline of 1 Gini point in the next 5 years and by \nan increase of 1 point by 2002.14 Based on these calculations, Milanovic observed  \nzig-zags in Gini coefficient from the 1980s to 20002. Bourguignon (2016) reports that \nglobal inequality declined after 2000. These observations show that global inequality \nworsened from the 19th century to around 1980, but it remained about the same level \nor improved from the 1980s through around 2010. \n   \n                                              \n12  For example, see Alcal\u00e1 and Ciccone (2004). \n13  The  studies  that detected  \u201clearning  by  exporting\u201d  effect  include,  for example, Aw  et  al.  (2000),  \nGirma et al. (2004), De Loecker (2007), and Hahn and Park (2010).  \n14  This calculation is reported in Milanovic (2006). \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nThe impact of globalization  on global inequality may be analyzed by decomposing \nglobal inequality into two components\u2014inequality in mean incomes between poor and \nrich countries, and within-national income distributions. If globalization, say an increase \nin trade\u2013GDP ratio, reduces the gap in mean income between poor and rich countries \nand it reduces within-national income distributions, then global inequality is likely to be \nreduced. A casual comparison between the rich and poor countries in terms of changes \nin per capita GDP (Figure 2) and the changes in trade\u2013GDP ratios (Figure 1), show \nthat  per  capita  GDP  growth  was  accompanied  by  globalization.  Coupled  with  the \nobservation  in  the  next  section  that  the  impacts  of  globalization  on  within-national \nincome distribution are mixed, one is tempted to argue that globalization contributed to \nnarrowing  global  inequality.  However,  this  assertion  cannot  be  supported  if  one \nremembers that in section  2.1 the earliest studies have shown that the impacts of \nglobalization  on  economic  growth  are  mixed.  These  observations  and  discussions \nindicate that the impact of globalization on global inequality cannot be conclusively \ndetermined. More studies on these two issues need to be conducted to see if and how \nglobalization affected global equality/inequality. \n3.  WITHIN-COUNTRY INCOME INEQUALITY \nMany studies have found that within-country inequality increased in both developed \nand  developing  countries  in  recent  decades.15 Before  we  examine  if  globalization, \nparticularly in terms of international trade, has contributed to the increase in inequality, \nwe make an observation on the changes in trade\u2013GDP ratios and Gini coefficient for \nselected East Asian developing countries from the 1980s to 2012. It should be noted \nthat the Gini coefficient is available for a limited number of countries for certain years, \nmaking it difficult to conduct cross-country, time-series comparisons. \nFigure  3  shows  the  trade\u2013GDP  ratios  and  Gini  coefficients  for  nine  East  Asian \ncountries, for which both are readily available. Concerning the trend in the trade\u2013GDP \nratios,  all  the  countries  in  the  figure  showed  substantial  and  continuous  increase \nthrough the end of 1990s although many countries experienced a decline toward the \nend of the 1990s because of the Asian Financial crisis. Entering the 21st century, two \ndivergent  trends  appeared.  One  group  of  countries  including  Cambodia,  the  PRC, \nIndia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam continued to increase the trade\u2013GDP ratios, \nwhile  the  other  group  consisting  of  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines \nexperienced a reversal in the trend and recorded a decline in the trade\u2013GDP ratios. \nTurning to the Gini coefficient, we find that the PRC is the only country that exhibited a \nmore or less continuous and substantial increase from the early 1980s to 2010, as the \nindex increased sharply from 27.69 in 1984 to 42.06 in 2010. India, Indonesia, and Viet \nNam showed an upward trend in the 21st century after experiencing a relatively stable \ntrend.  By  contrast,  Cambodia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand  showed  a \ndownward trend in the 21st century after experiencing a slight upward trend. These \ncasual observations appear to find the strong positive correlation between trade\u2013GDP \nratio and inequality only in the case of the PRC.

Most of these \nstudies examined the impact on wage inequality rather than income inequality16.  \nWage inequality is closely related to income equality, because wage is a dominant  \npart of income for many workers. However, they are different because many people \nreceive unearned income such as profits from investments. There are relatively  \nfew studies that examine the relationship between globalization and within-country \nincome inequality at the level of country as a whole for individual countries. Several \ncross-country econometric studies have been conducted, as will be discussed below. \nOne  useful  theoretical  framework  that  may  be  applied  to  explain  the  relationship \nbetween trade and income distribution is the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem derived from \nthe Hecksher\u2013Ohlin (HO) trade model. According to the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem, \ntrade liberalization leads to an increase in the price of abundant factors relative to the \nprice of scarce factors because it expands the production and exports of abundant \nfactor-intensive  products  and  it  reduces  the  production  of  scarce  factor-intensive \nproducts as a result of an increase in imports of scare factor-intensive products. Let us \nassume that there are two types of labor\u2014skilled and unskilled labor\u2014and developing \ncountries  are  abundantly  endowed  with  unskilled  labor.  Under  such  circumstance, \ntrade  liberalization  by  developing  countries  will  expand  exports  of  unskilled  labor \nintensive  products  and  imports  of  skilled  labor  intensive  products,  which  in  turn \nincreases demand for unskilled labor and reduces demand for skilled labor. Assuming \nthat labor\u2019s income comes from wages, one could show that an expansion of foreign \ntrade would improve income distribution in developing countries as it would increase \nthe wage of unskilled workers while it would reduce the wage of skilled workers17. \nWe review the existing studies on the impacts of globalization on within-country income \ninequality. Two types of studies have been conducted. One is a country-level study and \nthe  other  is  a  cross-country  study.  Country-level  study  is  conducted  by  analyzing  \nthe trends of various variables including income distribution, globalization, employment, \ndevelopment  policies,  and  others,  while  cross-country  analysis  uses  statistical \nmethods. Let us begin with country-level studies and then turn to cross-country studies. \nGoldberg and Pavcnik (2007) analyze the impacts of globalization on within-country \ninequality in developing countries covering the period from the 1980s to around 2000. \nFor the countries analyzed by Goldberg and Pavcnik, that is, Argentina; Brazil; Chile; \nColombia; Hong Kong, China; India; and Mexico, the share of trade to GDP increased \nand income inequality measured by Gini coefficient was either stable or increased \nduring  the  1980s  and  1990s.  These  developments  are  not  consistent  with  the \nprediction of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem discussed above. Noting the difficulty  \nin establishing a causal link between expanded trade and growing inequality, partly \nbecause  of  the  difficulty  in  considering  other  factors  such  as  the  changes  in \nmacroeconomic  environment,  adoption  of  various  policy  reforms  other  than  trade \npolicy, Goldberg and Pavcnik conclude that evidence has provided little support for the \nconventional wisdom (Stolper\u2013Samuelson Theorem) that trade openness in developing \ncountries would favor the less fortunate (at least in relative terms)18. According to \nGoldberg and Pavcnik, one of the important factors that played a role for the lack of \nsupport of the conventional wisdom is constrained labor mobility that limited sectoral \nreallocation of labor. They also argue that the particular mechanisms through which \n                                              \n16  See section 4 for the discussions on globalization and wage inequality. \n17  Detailed discussions on wage inequality will be presented in section 4. \n18  Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007: 77). \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \ntrade affects income distribution are country, time, and case specific, implying the need \nfor case studies. \nMah (2013) analyzed the impact of globalization on income inequality in the PRC. \nGlobalization is captured by the trade\u2013GDP ratio and FDI inflows\u2013GDP ratio, while \nincome inequality is measured by two ratios\u2014one is the ratio defined as the average \nincome of the top 10% divided by that of the bottom 10%, and the other is the ratio \ndefined as the average income of the top 10% divided by that of the bottom 40%. \nApplying the dynamic ordinary least squares method to the time-series data covering \n1985\u20132007, Mah found that increase in trade\u2013GDP ratio had a strong positive effect on \nincome inequality regardless of the measure of income inequality, while the effect of \nFDI inflows was found to be mixed. These findings appear consistent with the casual \nobservation made earlier, showing the rising trend of trade\u2013GDP ratio and increasing \ninequality in the PRC. \nPal  and  Ghosh  (2007)  analyzed  the  trend  of  income  and  consumption  inequality  \nfrom the 1980s to early 2000s in India. Noting the mixed evidence on the direction of \nchange in income inequality during the 1990s, the period of economic reform, which \nwas obtained from various studies, they presented the studies conducted by other \nresearchers  that  showed  an  increasing  inequality  in  terms  of  expenditure  and \nconsumption during the reform period. Pal and Ghosh  argue without conducting a \nstatistical analysis that fiscal policy, financial sector reform, liberalization of foreign and \ndomestic investment, and trade liberalization all contributed to increasing inequality, as \nthey favored the allocation of fiscal as well as financial resources from the poor to the \nrich. Specifically on the impact of trade liberalization, they argue that trade liberalization \nhad negative impacts on the agricultural sector, which employs low-income workers, \nwhile  it  only  benefited  a  small  portion  of  the  manufacturing  sector,  resulting  in  \ngrowing inequality. \nAll the  studies  we  surveyed  above  did  not  support  the  prediction  of  the  Stolper\u2013\nSamuelson Theorem. The findings of Ragayah (2008) on the case of Malaysia are \ndifferent. Ragayah (2008) found that income inequality declined during the 1976\u20131990 \nperiod, but it increased after 1990. Ragayah argues that differences in the pattern of \nexports between these two periods played an important role in its impacts on income \ninequality. Rapid growth during 1976\u20131990s was largely attributable to rapid expansion \nof labor-intensive exports, which provided employment opportunity for many people, \nthereby contributing to the decline in income inequality. The situation changed as a \nlabor shortage situation emerged in the 1990s. In order to maintain its competitiveness \nin  the  global  market,  Malaysia  upgraded  her  industrialization  development  from  \none  that  is  labor-intensive  to  one  which  is  capital-  and  techonology-intensive. \nConsequently, this new development strategy altered the pattern of demand for labor \nrequired  by  the  industries  by  raising  the  demand  for  skilled  and  highly  educated \nworkers, resulting in increasing income inequality. This trend was enhanced by the \nmassive entry of unskilled foreign labor into the Malaysian economy that dampened the \nwages of unskilled labor. Ragayah\u2019s findings are very interesting and consistent with \nthe Stolper\u2013Samuleson Theorem in that globalization reduced income inequality when \nMalaysia was a low-income developing country, while globalization worsened income \ninequality when Malaysia became a middle-income country. \n   \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nLet  us  turn  to  the  cross-country  analysis.  Anderson  (2005)  provides  a  review  of  \ncross-country  econometric  studies  of  the  effect  of  openness  on  within-country \ninequality.19 The  studies  that  Anderson  reviewed  covered  the  period  up  to  the  \nmid-1990s. Specifically, he examined the results of the studies that statistically tested \nthe  validity  of  the  following  three  hypotheses:  (1)  greater  openness  raises  overall \ninequality in all countries; (2) greater openness reduces overall inequality in developing \ncountries, but increases overall inequality in developed countries; (3) the effects of \ngreater openness on overall inequality vary, depending on the factor endowments of \nthe country opening up. Reviewing the studies, Anderson came up with the following \nbroad conclusions on the three hypotheses. There is almost no support for the first \nhypothesis, while there is conflicting evidence regarding the second hypothesis. Some \nstudies find that greater openness does reduce inequality in developing countries, but \nsome studies found no significant  effect of  openness on inequality at any level  of \neconomic development. There is qualified support for the third hypothesis. Specifically, \nsome studies find that the effect of openness on inequality increases as countries\u2019 \nendowments  of  human  capital  increases.  This  finding  appears  to  indicate  that \nopenness increases inequality as the level of economic development of the country \nrises and it is consistent with the finding on Malaysia by Ragayah. One of the problems \nof  many  of  these  studies  is  the  omission  of  possibly  important  variables  such  as \ntechnology and foreign direct investment (FDI), which are likely to have impacts on \nincome inequality, in the analysis of the impacts of trade on inequality. Jaumotte et al. \n(2013) takes on this problem by explicitly introducing technology, FDI, and several \nother variables in their econometric analysis. \nJaumotte  et  al.  (2013)  conducted  a  detailed  statistical  analysis  of  the  impacts  of \nglobalization on within-country income inequality. Their data set includes 51 countries \n(20  developed  and  31  developing)  over  1981\u20132003.  They  observed  that  income \ninequality has risen in most countries from 1981 to 2003. They found that the income  \nof the poorest groups increased, suggesting that inequality increased in the upper  \nparts of the distribution in most countries. Their empirical analysis revealed that trade \nliberalization  (increase  in  trade\u2013GDP  ratio  as  well  as  a  decline  in  tariff  rates)  is \nassociated  with  lower  income  inequality,  while  increased  financial  openness  is \nassociated  with  higher  income  inequality.  The  combined  contribution  of  increasing \ntrade  and  financial  flows  to  rising  inequality  is  slightly  positive  in  the  case  of  all \ncountries and slightly negative for developing countries. It is noteworthy that exports, \nparticularly agricultural exports, contribute to reducing inequality. Tariff reductions are \nfound to reduce inequality. Jaumotte et al. argue that tariff reductions affected goods \nwhich  are  disproportionately  consumed  by  the  poor.  Among  different  types  of \ninternational financial flows, inward FDI is revealed to increase inequality. According to \nJaumotte et al., this finding may reflect the phenomenon that FDI mostly takes place in \nrelatively higher skill- and technology-intensive sectors, thereby increasing the demand \nfor, and wages of, more skilled workers. \nIn  contrast  to  the  inequality-reducing  impacts  of  trade,  Jaumotte  et  al.  found  that \ntechnological  progress  increased  inequality.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  an \nobservation that technological progress increases the demand for skilled workers. We \nwill analyze this issue more in detail in the next section on wage inequality. Based on a \ndecomposition analysis of the change in inequality based on their estimation results, \nJaumotte  et  al.  find  that  the  contribution  of  technological  progress  was  positive \n                                              \n19  The measure of inequality differs among the studies, but the Gini index and the share of the poorest \nquintile in national income are used in many studies. \n11 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \n(increasing inequality) and very large, while the contribution of globalization (trade and \nfinancial flows) was negative and very small in the case of developing countries.20 \nIn this section, we examined the impacts of globalization, particularly in the form of \nincreasing international trade, on within-country income inequality. We first observed \nsomewhat different changing patterns of trade\u2013GDP ratios and within-country income \ninequality for some countries in recent years from the patterns observed for the period \nup to the early 2000s. Some countries saw a decline in trade\u2013GDP ratios, while some \ncountries  registered  a  decline  in  within-country  income  inequality.  These  findings \nindicate the need for more empirical studies on this subject using more recent data. \nA  survey  of  empirical  studies  revealed  somewhat  different  patterns  between  the \ncountry-level studies and cross-country studies. Some country-level studies showed \nthat an increase in trade\u2013GDP ratios worsened inequality, while some country-level \nstudies did not detect significant impacts of trade on income distribution. Cross-country \nstudies found that trade improved income distribution, although the impacts are rather \nsmall. These mixed results of the impacts of trade on income inequality indicate the \nneed for more analyses. \n4.  WAGE INEQUALITY \nThe question  about globalization  and wage gap came  after  an  observation  of two \ndifferent  but  not  necessary  mutually  exclusive  facts, that  is,  an  increase  in  skilled \nintensity in many countries during the 1980s and 1990s and implementation of trade \nreforms in these countries during these periods. The two coincidentally happened at \nthe same time. Studies on Latin American countries found that skill premium in Mexico \n(Cragg and Epelbeum 1996), Colombia (Attanasio et al. 2004), Argentina (Gasparini \n2004), and Brazil (Gasparini 2003) all increased by at least 10% for a 5- or 10-year \nperiod within the 1980s and 1990s. The increase in Mexico is the largest among all and \nit suggests the strongest potential link between globalization and wage inequality; the \ncountry implemented major trade reforms in the 1980s and continued by implementing \nfurther  reforms  to  increase  FDI  and  facilitate  cross-border  outsourcing  (Cragg  and \nEpelbeum 1996).  \nIn this section we review theoretical explanations of the possible role of globalization in \naffecting  the  wage  gap  in  developing  countries  and  then  present  recent  empirical \nfindings on this relationship in developing countries. \n4.1  Increasing Wage Gap in Developing Countries:  \nTheoretical Explanations \nGoldberg and Pavcnik (2007) pointed out that the shift in demand for skilled workers is \nthe main reason for a widening wage gap, or skill premium, observed in developing \ncountries. While  the  demand-shift  mechanism  is  clear,  it  is  not  so  clear  how  the \ndemand curve shifts. There are then questions about which factors cause demand to \nshift and how this occurs.  \nThe  neoclassical  Heckscher\u2013Ohlin  (HO)  model  is  not  always  able  to  explain  the  \ntrend  and  pattern  of  skill  premium,  especially  those  in  developing  countries.  The \nStolper\u2013Samuelson theorem derived from the HO model predicts that distributional \n                                              \n20  For developed countries, contributions of globalization and technological progress were found to be \npositive. The magnitude of the contribution of technological progress is more than twice as large as that \nof globalization (Jaumotte et al. 2013) \n12 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nchanges in developing countries, which usually are endowed with unskilled workers, \nshould  favor  unskilled  workers  more  than  the  skilled  ones  in  the  event  of  trade \nliberalization. This theorem therefore predicts a lower gap in wage between skilled and \nunskilled workers. \nPrediction of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theory however contradicts the fact of increasing \nwage gap over time. There are at least three potential explanations for this according to \nGoldberg and Pavcnik (2007). First, one may extend the basic HO model, which is built \nupon two-sector and two-factor framework, to include the third factor (e.g., natural \nresource) or additional sector (non-traded goods) that requires skilled workers for the \nproduction of the sector. Further, it is assumed that natural resource complements \nskilled workers. If, suppose, a country has abundant in natural resources, the extended \nHO model predicts that trade creation in favor of an expansion in the natural resource \nsector increases the demand for skilled workers, which is translated to an increase in \nwage  of  skilled  workers.  The  demand  (and  hence  the  wage)  of  unskilled  workers \nmeanwhile declines.  \nSecond is the case where large tariff reduction is applied to unskilled labor-intensive \nsectors. In developing countries, unskilled labor-intensive sectors producing unskilled \nlabor-intensive products typically are highly protected for various reasons (mainly for \npolitical economy reasons, i.e., major source of employment). Cuts in tariffs reduce the \ndemand for unskilled workers and thus reduce the wage of the workers. Kumar and \nMishra (2008) provide some evidence from major trade liberalization in India in the \nearly 1990s, in which tariff reductions were disproportionately larger in labor-intensive \nsectors. An increase in the wage gap was observed in these sectors.  \nThird, there is a shift in the distribution of comparative advantage across countries, with \nthe  emergence  of  the  PRC  or  other  developing  countries  that  have  comparative \nadvantage  in  unskilled  workers  intensive  sectors.  This  pushes  more  advanced,  or \nmiddle-income, countries as those in Latin America in the 1980s to move their pattern \nof comparative advantage towards goods with higher skill intensity.  \nOther alternative explanations not in the context of HO model have been put forward in \nthe literature. The first is the \u2018outsourcing\u2019 or \u2018product sharing\u2019 theory of Feenstra and \nHanson  (1996,  1997).  The  theoretical  model  developed  by  Feenstra  and  Hanson \nshows that FDI increases demand for skilled labor and thus increases skill premium. \nThis model emphasizes the growing importance of trade in intermediate inputs, partly \nas a result of FDI. In the model, relative demand for skilled labor is increased because \nproduction of relatively skill-intensive intermediate inputs is shifted to these countries. \nWhile the shift can be characterized as less skill-intensive from the perspective of a \ndeveloped country, it is skill-intensive from the perspective of a developing country. \nIt is useful to make some comments on the difference between traditional trade theory \nand the one suggested by Feenstra and Hanson. The main difference comes from \ndifferent  expectations  of  how  globalization  changes  production  of  skill-intensive \nintermediate  inputs.  The  former  expects  a  decline  in  production  because  many \nintermediate inputs are replaced by imported ones. Feenstra and Hanson\u2019s theory, \nmeanwhile, predicts that domestic production is increased because now many of the \ninputs  are  produced  locally  by  \u2018outsourced\u2019  firms.  The magnitude  and  direction  of \nglobalization impact on wage premium thus depends on the changes in production of \nskill-intensive intermediate inputs.  \nThe  second  explanation  is  the  one  often  termed  skill-biased  technological  change \n(SBTC). SBTC argues that the technology used in many developing countries has \nbecome more advanced over time, inducing an increase in the demand for skilled \nworkers. The process that brings in advanced technology to these countries however is \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nnot random. It depends on openness, that is, technology transfer from overseas or \nmore developed countries is facilitated by a more open trade and/or a more liberal \ninvestment regime. Technology therefore is endogenous to openness, and this is how \nglobalization is responsible for  the skilled-bias technological change (Goldberg and \nPavcnik 2007). \nTwo mechanisms reflecting endogeneity are provided by Wood (1999) and Acemoglu \n(2003).  The  first  is  \u2018defensive  innovation\u2019  as  Wood  termed  the  response.  He \nhypothesized that intensified competition from imports may induce firms to engage in \nR&D activities that they have little incentive to undertake before trade liberalization \n(Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  2007).  The  second  mechanism,  suggested  by  Acemoglu \n(2003),  comes  from  imports  of  machinery  or  other  capital  goods  that  are \ncomplementary to skilled workers. In this model, trade liberalization reduces the price \nof the machinery and capital goods and therefore increases the imports of these goods. \nThis results in an increase in the hiring of skilled workers for the operation of the more \nadvanced technology installed by imported inputs.  \n4.2  Increasing Wage Gap: Findings of Empirical Studies  \non Developing Countries \nA recent study by Amiti and Cameron (2012) provides some support for the Stolper\u2013\nSamuelson theorem in explaining skill premium in developing countries, by examining \nthe effects of tariff reduction on wage skill premium in Indonesian manufacturing. Amiti \nand Cameron examined the effects of output and input tariffs separately, and they \nfound  that  a  cut  in  input  tariffs  reduced  skill  premium  among  firms  that  imported \nintermediate inputs. Relative demand for skilled labor was lowered because domestic \nproduction of relatively skill-intensive intermediate inputs was replaced by imports.  \nAldaba  (2013)  also  found  a  declining  wage  gap  in  the  Philippines  manufacturing  \nsector as an impact of trade liberalization introduced by the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). The finding is robust when the \nimpact was tested using effective and nominal rate of protection. Aldaba suggested \nthat,  given  more  intense  foreign  competition  after  trade  liberalization,  import-\nsubstituting firms may have decided to concentrate on the low value added stage of the \nproduction process that requires relatively less skilled workers.  \nThe results of Amiti and Cameron, which are consistent with the prediction of trade \ntheory, however are in contrast to the findings that emerged from other studies. There \nis evidence from these studies that globalization increases skill premium not only in \ndeveloped countries but also in developing countries. \nA  number  of  studies  provide  some  support  for  the  SBTC  hypothesis.  Galiani  and \nSanguinetti  (2003),  for  example,  observed  a  positive  relationship  between  import \npenetration ratio, which increased from 5.7% in early 1990s to 19% in 1999, and hourly \nearnings  of  college  graduates  in  Argentina.  An  increase  in  the  demand  of  skilled \nworkers is suggested to have come from an increase in imported goods.  \nIn  terms  of  support  for  outsourcing  theory,  Kohpaiboon  and  Jongwanich  (2013),  \nusing  plant-level  data  from  Thai  manufacturing,  examined  the  effects  of  both  the \nengagement with global production networks and the reductions in tariffs on wage skill \npremium within firms. They particularly focused on the  effects of  engagement with \nglobal  production  networks,  arguing  the  growing  concern  in  developing  countries\u2019  \npolicy makers that participating in global production sharing could trap their enterprises \nin  using  low-skilled  or  low-quality  workers  and  retarded  technology.  The  study  \nfound  that  the  engagement  with  global  production  networks  increases  wage  skill \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \npremium in skill-intensive firms, contrary to the concern of policy makers. Their finding \nsuggests  that the  firms  in  production  networks  undertake  restructuring using more \nadvanced technology.  \nThangavelu (2013) came up with findings along the same lines. Using enterprise-level \ndata of Vietnamese manufacturing, he found that firms adopting new technologies and \nrestructuring their organization, as a response to a liberalized trade and investment \nregime,  were  likely  to  experience  an  increase  in  wage  gap  between  skilled  and \nunskilled workers. \nOne may argue that the widening wage gap is partly due to an increase in exports, as a \nresult of a more open trade regime globally. Global and regional production networks \nhave  been  constructed  actively  by  multinational  corporations  in  East  Asia.  Under  \nthe production networks the magnitude of trade, both exports and imports, expanded \nsignificantly, contributing to the increased wage gap. Kohpaiboon  and  Jongwanich, \nThangavelu, and Aldaba, support this argument. All of them found that widening wage \ngap was evident in more skilled sectors, which also are export oriented sectors at the \nsame time. This is consistent with a study conducted by Bernard and Jensen (1997) \nthat observed an increase in employment of exporting plants, which in turn is found to \nhave contribed to an increase in demand for skilled labor.  \nSeveral studies confirm the hypothesis of endogenous technology in the SBTC theory. \nAttanasio et al. (2004) show for Colombia that the increase in skill intensity over the \ntime after trade liberalization was observed in all industries and the liberalization was \nfound to affect the so-called \u2018industry premium\u2019 in wage determination (the premium is \nassociated  with  anything  but  workers  or  industry  characteristics).  Their  finding  is \nconsistent with the prediction of SBTC. In addition, Attanasio et al. (2004) documented \nthat the increase in demand for skilled labor in Columbia was the largest in the sectors \nthat experienced the largest cuts in tariff. \nThe point about endogenous technology through R&D mechanism was made by Hahn \nand Choi (2013) in the case of Korean manufacturing. They examined the effects of \noutput  and  input  tariff  reductions  on  within-plant  wage  skill  premium  in  Korean \nmanufacturing plants, and they found that output tariff reduction interacts differently \nwith  plants'  R&D  and  investment  behaviors  in  affecting  skill  premium. Specifically, \noutput  tariff  reduction  increases  wage  premium  in  R&D-performing  plants  while  it \nreduces wage premium in plants making facility investments. One story behind the \nresults is that, although both R&D and facility investments may respond to changes in \nprofit  opportunities  due  to  output  tariff  reductions,  R&D  raises  relative  demand  for \nskilled workers while facility investment, an activity of increasing production capacity, \nraises the demand for unskilled workers. \nMeanwhile, for the case of the PRC, Anwar and Sun (2012) provide support for the \ncompetition  channel  that  induces  investment  in  technology  through  the  \u2018defensive \ninnovation\u2019 mechanism termed by Wood (1999). Anwar and Sun show that the extent \nof wage gap increased by about 50% over just 6 years, from 2000 to 2006, and they \nexplained much of it as an impact of competition forces from import that push firms to \nhire more skilled workers. This seems to have been facilitated by an increase in the \nproportion of private firms; in their study, private ownership variable is found to have \nbeen positively related with wage gap. \nThe competition channel  of the \u2018defensive innovation\u2019 is also found in the case of \nIndonesian manufacturing. Using data of medium and large establishments, Takii and \nNarjoko (2013) examined how greater exposure to international trade and FDI affects \nthe extent of skill premium in wage and employment intensity. They found tariff cuts \nhave led local plants with low share of imported inputs, as well as non-importing plants, \n15 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nto hire more skilled workers. This was likely a result of efficiency enhancing measures \nby plants in response to more competitive pressure from foreign competition.  \nTo sum up, evidence seems to point to rising inequality within country\u2014as a result of \nrising wage gap\u2014comes from the creation, or existence, of more sophisticated goods \nproduced domestically. Technology transfer is behind this phenomenon, working in \nvarious ways proposed by all non-traditional trade theories (i.e., subcontracting/product \nsharing  theory  and  SBTC).  Here,  unlike  traditional  trade  theory,  and  because  of \nproduction  networks  across  countries,  trade  liberalization  allows  importation  of \nadvanced machineries that eventually raise the demand of skilled workers. This is the \nkey difference; if traditional theory is adopted, importation only replaces goods initially \nproduced domestically; there is  only  a weak  element of technology transfer in the \nimportation.  Evidence  also  seems  to  indicate  that  in  countries  where  production \nnetworks are not strong, such as in Indonesia and the Philippines, trade liberalization \ntends to behave more in line with predictions of traditional theory; in these countries for \nexample, trade liberalization seems to purely substitute products, or intermediate input, \ninitially produced domestically.  \n5.  REGIONAL INEQUALITY \nWidening regional income inequality has been reported in many countries. Some of the \nmost frequently reported cases include the PRC and India. The problem of regional \ninequality is a big concern for many people, mainly because of its social and political \nimpacts. Growing regional inequality would result in imbalance in the level of economic \ndevelopment between and among the regions, which in turn would increase social and \npolitical tensions, possibly resulting in deterring overall economic growth. Globalization \nis often accused of worsening regional inequality, mainly because the timing of rapid \nglobalization coincides with growing regional inequality in several countries, including \nthe PRC and India. However, coincidence does not mean causality. In other words, we \ncannot  be  sure  if  globalization  has  deteriorated  regional  inequality,  unless  we \nundertake rigorous empirical analysis.  \nLet us briefly review what economic theory tells us about globalization and regional \ninequality. According to spatial economics, the location of economic activities is mainly \ndetermined by the benefits and costs of agglomeration and transportation costs. Think \nof a firm deciding the location of its operation. It would choose to locate in an urban \narea where many firms form agglomeration, if it thinks the benefits of agglomeration in \nthe forms of ease of access (including transportation cost) to sales and procurement \nnetworks as well as access to various kinds of information such as information on \ntechnology and market outweigh the cost of agglomeration such as traffic congestion \nand high cost of land, then a firm would locate in an urban area. If the reverse is the \ncase, then a firm would locate in a rural area.  \nRecognizing  the  forces  toward  and  against  agglomeration,  then  the  question  is  if \nglobalization  increases  forces  toward  or  against  agglomeration.  This  depends  on \nvarious  factors  including  the  kinds  of  activities  promoted  by  globalization  and  the \nlocation  of  ports  and  airports  (infrastructure),  which  become  gateways  to  connect \ndomestic economic activities to global economic activities. If globalization leads to an \nincrease  in  agricultural  production,  which  does  not  generally  gain  benefits  from \nagglomeration, then economic activities will spread to rural areas, thus contributing to \nreduction in regional inequality. On the other hand, if globalization leads to an increase \nin manufacturing production, which gains benefits from agglomeration, then economic \nactivities are likely to be clustered in urban areas, contributing to regional inequality. \n16 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nThese discussions indicate that one cannot know if globalization increases or reduces \nregional inequality a priori. The outcome depends on various factors, some of which \nwere given above. In this section we discuss the studies on the PRC, India, Brazil, \nIndonesia, and Mexico. \nZhang and Zhang (2003) observed an increase in regional inequality in the PRC from \n1986 to 1998, as the regional (provincial) Gini coefficient increased from 19 to 26, \nreflecting booming coastal regions in contrast to sluggish inland regions. Using the \nprovincial data covering the 1986\u20131998 period, Zhang and Zhang estimate a model \nthat quantitatively decomposes the effects of the following variables listed below on \nregional inequality. Their findings show the contribution of these variables as follows: \ndomestic  capital  (75.1%),  foreign  capital  (8.1%),  education  (\u20138.0%),  foreign  trade \n(11.1%), inland/coast (3.8%), and other factors (9.9%). Based on these findings, Zhang \nand  Zhang  conclude  that  globalization  through  foreign  trade  and  FDI  played  an \nimportant role in worsening regional inequality in the PRC. They argue that this finding \nis  in  contrast  to  theoretical  predictions  of  the  standard  trade  model  that  implicitly \nassumes integrated factor markets, and their finding can be explained by the fact that \nfactor markets have been rather segmented in the PRC. Because of this segmentation, \nmost gains from globalization have gone to the coastal parts of the country, leading to \nwidening regional disparity.  \nPal and Ghosh (2007) examined regional (inter-state) inequality in India from the 1980s \nthrough the early 2000s, in addition to vertical inequality discussed in section 3. They \nfound that regional inequality worsened during the 1990s. Specifically, the ratio of the \nper capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) of the richest state, Punjab, to that of \nthe poorest state, Bihar, increased from around 3 in the late 1980s to 4.7 in the early \n2000s. The inter-state Gini coefficient increased from around 16 in the late 1980s to \naround 23 in the late 1990s. Although Pal and Ghosh did not discuss explicitly the \ncauses of increasing regional inequality, they seem to argue that the same factors that \ncontributed  to  increasing  vertical  inequality  also  contributed  to  increasing  regional \ninequality. In other words, trade liberalization was argued to be one of the factors that \nled to increasing regional inequality. \nDaumal (2013) also found a substantial increase in regional inequality in India from the \n1980s to the  early 2000s. Specifically, the regional Gini coefficient increased  from  \n16.0 in 1980 to 17.7 in 1990, and to 25.6 in 2003. The trade (exports+imports)/GDP \nratio increased from 15% in 1980 to 40% in 2003. Applying the error correction model \nto the time-series data, she found that trade openness contributed positively to the \nincrease in regional inequality. This finding is consistent with the assertion made by Pal \nand Ghosh. Daumal argued that during the 1980\u20132003 period, India\u2019s exports shifted \nfrom agricultural products to manufacturing products, resulting in higher growth of the \nrich region engaged in manufacturing relative to the poor agricultural region. She also \npointed out that opening up the country in the 1990s led to high economic growth in the \ncoastal region, as an agglomeration effect was set in motion.  \nDaumal (2013) also analyzed the case of Brazil, where the trade\u2013GDP ratio increased \nfrom approximately 17% in the late 1980s to about 30% in the early 2000s. Unlike \nIndia, Brazil did not experience an increase in regional inequality. Indeed, regional \ninequality declined as the regional Gini coefficient declined from 27.3 in 1985 to 23.8  \nin  2003.  Her  time-series  analysis  showed  that  trade  openness  had  a  statistically \nsignificant negative impact on regional inequality. She attributes her finding to the fact \nthat a large part of Brazilian exports consisted of agricultural products, which are grown \nin relatively poor regions. Furthermore, she observes that trade liberalization in Brazil \nled to relocation of some industrial activities to peripheral regions. \n17 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nResosudarmo  and  Vidyattama  (2006)  analyzed  the  regional  income  disparity  in \nIndonesia. Using data covering the 1993\u20132002 period, Resosudamo and Vidyattama \nobserved that regional income disparity is quite severe compared to other developing \ncountries including the PRC and India. However, they found that there is a conditional \nconvergence in regional income per capita growth from their statistical analysis. They \nalso found that trade openness contributed positively to regional income per capita \ngrowth, resulting in reducing regional inequality. Resosudarmo and Vidyattama did not \ngive explanations for their finding. \nAroca et al. (2005) examined the changes in regional inequality over the period marked \nby trade liberalization (the accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n[GATT] in 1986 and the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement \n[NAFTA] in 1994) in Mexico. The authors observed a tremendous increase in disparity, \nwhich was realized in the form of creating several income clusters, thereby creating a \n\u201csouth\u201d (low income region) and a \u201cnorth\u201d (high income region) in Mexico. What is \nnotable is that these income clusters do not map to geographic regions, except the \nnorth  region,  which  is  directly  on  the  US  border.  They  found  that  the  substantial \ndivergence occurring in the 1985\u20132003 period is not related to the consolidation of a \nfaster growing northern block but that only the south shows covarying growth rates. \nThey  argue  that  two  likely  explanations  for  the  divergence  occurring  after  trade \nliberalization are the sustained underperformance of the southern states, beginning \nbefore  NAFTA,  which  affected  local  agricultural  industries,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  \nthe  superior  performance  of  an  emerging convergence  club  in the  north\u2013center  of  \nthe country. \nAn examination of the studies on the impact of international trade on regional inequality \nrevealed that the impacts are mixed in that in some cases  (Brazil  and Indonesia) \nexpansion in trade contributed to a reduction in regional inequality, while in some cases \n(the  PRC,  Indonesia,  and  Mexico)  trade  expansion  increased  regional  income \ninequality. The different impacts are largely attributable to the composition of trade and \nthe location of industry. If exports of agricultural products, which are grown in the poor \nregion, increase, then regional inequality will be reduced. On the other hand, if exports \nof  manufactured  products,  which  are  produced  in  the  relatively  rich  urban  region, \nincrease, then regional inequality will be increased. It was also found that limited labor \nmobility has a negative impact on regional inequality. \n6.  CONCLUDING REMARKS \nWe analyzed the impacts of globalization, particularly in the form of international trade, \non inequalities from various perspectives. In terms of theory, increased trade is shown \nto  have  both  positive  and  negative  impacts  on  inequalities.  In  terms  of  global \ninequalities, increased trade can widen or reduce the gap between developing and \ndeveloped countries, while within countries increased trade can improve or worsen \ninequalities in income, wages, and regional income disparities. \nOur  review  of  the  empirical  studies  found that  an  increase  in  trade  openness  by \ndeveloping countries appears to have contributed to narrowing the development gap \nvis-\u00e0-vis developed countries, while its impacts on income gaps between developing \ncountries  are  not  clear.  The  impacts  of  increased  trade  or  trade  liberalization  on  \nwithin-country inequalities are found to be mixed. In some cases, trade liberalization \nimproved  wage-inequality,  but  in  some  cases,  the  opposite  pattern  was  observed. \nSimilar mixed patterns are found for regional inequalities. These mixed findings are \nconsistent with the fact that theoretical predictions are also mixed. One of the problems \n18 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 675  Urata and Narjoko \n \nin empirically discerning the impacts of trade openness on inequalities is the difficulty  \nin isolating the impacts of trade on inequality when many factors other than trade, \nincluding  labor market  conditions,  inflow  of  capital,  policy  reforms, which influence \ninequalities  are  at  work.  Furthermore,  as  Goldberg  and  Pavcnik  (2007)  argue,  the \nparticular  mechanisms  through  which  globalization  affected  inequality  are  country, \ntime,  and  case  specific,  implying the  difficulty  in  obtaining  a  general  pattern.  It is \nwarranted then to conduct more empirical studies on the subject, particularly by using \nmicro-data on trade, production, employment at firm and household levels, which have \nbecome available for an increasing number of countries in recent years. \nHaving discussed the ambiguity of the impacts of trade on inequality, we have realized \nthat trade is one of many factors that affect inequality. This is particularly the case for \nthe countries where trade accounts for a small part of their economic activities. Two \nimportant factors that affect inequality include discriminatory educational systems and \nlabor market imperfection. Discriminatory educational systems that discriminate against \nthe poor and labor market regulations that limit the mobility of labor would result in \nwidening wage/income inequality. \nRecognizing the importance of ameliorating inequalities in order to achieve a stable \nsocial and political environment, which is important for achieving sustainable economic \ngrowth,  the  government  needs  to  implement  appropriate  policies  to  deal  with  the \nproblems noted above. Specifically, the government should promote human resource \ndevelopment  that  would  improve  the  quality  of  labor  by  providing  education  and \ntraining. Given the ongoing trend of increasing demand for skilled labor in developing \ncountries, an increase in the supply of skilled labor would reduce income inequality at \nleast compared with the case where the quantity of skilled labor remains constant. One \nneeds to stress the importance of well-functioning and flexible labor market, where \nworkers with improved skills can find and obtain appropriate jobs.21 \nIt is important to note that the government should implement income redistribution \npolicy  in  order  to  achieve  balanced  growth.  Specifically,  the  government  should  \nprovide  social  safety  nets  for  the  workers  that  are  negatively  impacted  by  trade \nliberalization/increased  imports.  Provision  of  social  safety  nets,  which  includes \nprovision of income compensation, and education and training, would not only reduce \nthe negative impacts on the workers but also limit worsening inequalities. Safety nets \nshould be provided temporarily not permanently, because its task is to reduce the \nadjustment cost. Finally, progressive income tax systems and inheritance tax systems \nshould be adopted to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. Having discussed \nthe need to introduce redistributive tax systems and realizing that excessively high tax \nrates would deter economic growth, the government has to apply appropriate tax rates \nthat lead to a good balance between equity and economic growth.  \n   \n                                              \n21  On these points, see Bolaky and Freund (2008), and Chang et al.
