Several \nin \nexplaining  import  demand  such  as  credit  conditions  and  business  and  consumer \nsentiment  are  also  included.  A  panel  fixed-effects  model  adjusted  for  cross-sectional \ndependence is estimated for 11 Asian economies from 1Q91 to 2Q11. The result shows \nthe import intensity of exports is the highest among all variables. Alone, however, it does \nnot  contribute  to  a  larger  fall  in  imports.  The  larger  decline  in  imports  will  be  evident  if \ninvestment  and \nother  components  of  aggregate  demand  also \nconsumption.  A  weakened  credit  condition  will  also  exacerbate  the  fall  in  imports. \nBusiness and consumer sentiment, however, does not seem to matter. In crisis periods \nmore nuanced results are evident. For example, fiscal contractions may have worsened \nthe fall in imports during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, while the fall in exports also \nhas an additional adverse impact. Business and consumer sentiment seems to have a \nlagged positive impact during the global financial crisis. \n \n \nKeywords: imports, exports, Asia, ASEAN, East Asia, crisis \n \nJEL Classification: F10, F14, F31\n\nfall,  particularly \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   1 \n\nIntroduction \n\n1. \n \nCrises  have  a  way  of  focusing  the  mind  on  phenomena  worthy  of  investigation  and \nreinvestigation. One such phenomenon is the simultaneous deterioration of global trade \nand gross domestic product (GDP) after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late  2008. \nWhat  we  witnessed  was  a  fall  in  world  trade  that  outpaced  the  decline  in  world  GDP. \nAnd as the latter is now known as \u201cthe Great Recession,\u201d the former is aptly called \u201cthe \nGreat  Trade  Collapse.\u201d  A  flurry  of  studies  has  since  investigated  the  Great  Trade \nCollapse.  Baldwin  (2009)  provides  a  collection  of  studies  looking  at  the  causes, \nconsequences and prospects of the collapse.  \n \nAn equally interesting but less studied phenomenon is the observation that imports tend \nto fall more than exports during crises. Abiad et al. (2011) find that if a particular country \nis in financial crisis\u2014defined as a banking and/or debt crisis\u2014it takes about 10 years for \nits imports to recover to trend. With hindsight, the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis did have \na  marked  impact  on  Asia\u2019s  imports,  although  not  as  long-lasting  as  Abiad  et  al.  would \nhave  predicted.  While  the  Great  Trade  collapse  was  sudden  and  severe,  its  recovery \nwas  nonetheless  swift.  Still,  many  Asian  economies  did  experience  a  sharper \ndeterioration  in  imports  than  exports.  As  such,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  analyze  what \npossibly  explains  the  larger  fall  in  imports  than exports  in  general  and  during  crises  in \nparticular.   \n \nThis  paper  investigates  the  question  by  estimating  a  panel  structural  import  demand \nfunction  that  captures  the  differential  and  time-varying  import  intensities  of  each \ncomponent  of  aggregate  demand:  consumption,  investment,  government  expenditure, \nand  exports.  In  doing  so  it  is  able  to  distinguish  how  each  component  of  aggregate \ndemand  affects  imports.  From  the  exports  estimate  in  particular,  it  will  be  able  to \nascertain whether the phenomenon of a sharper fall in imports versus exports is true. In \naddition, the time-varying nature of the parameter will be able to capture the  large and \ngrowing import intensity of exports associated with the rapid rise of vertical specialization \nin  the  region.  This  is  most  salient  given  the  special  role  Southeast  and  East  Asian \neconomies play in international production linkages with the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) at the center of global manufacturing hubs.  \n \nThe  specification  is  also  augmented  with  several  variables  commonly  identified  as \nimportant  explanatory  variables for  import  demand.  These are  business and consumer \nconfidence, credit conditions, and stocks changes. This paper examines a sample of 11 \nAsian  countries  from  1Q91  to  2Q11:  five  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN)  (Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore  and  Thailand);  the  PRC; \nHong  Kong,  China;  India;  Japan;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  and  Taipei,China.  These \ncountries are the most active participants in the region\u2019s production networks as well as \nthe  region\u2019s  biggest  trading  nations.  India  is  included  to  account  for  its  growing \nsignificance in the region\u2019s trade.   \n \nTo  preview  the  results,  it  is  found  that  exports  have  an  amplification  effect  on  imports. \nThat is when say exports fall, imports will fall as well. Yet the fall in exports alone cannot \nexplain  the  larger  fall  in  imports,  despite  being  the  single  most  important  determinant. \nThis  has  to come from  the  decline  in other  components  of  aggregate  demand,  notably \n\n \n\n\f2    |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 96  \n\nLiterature Review and Stylized Facts \n\ninvestment and consumption. In fact, a weakened credit condition is also a contributing \nfactor, although changes in stocks and business and consumer sentiment do not seem \nimportant.  That  said,  in  crisis  periods  more  nuanced  impacts  of  these  variables  are \nevident.  For  example,  destocking  seems  to  have  weakened  the  demand  for  imports \nduring  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  but  not  during  the  recent  global  financial  crisis.  And \ndeteriorating business and consumer sentiment seems to have a lagged adverse effect \non imports during crises, while changes in credit conditions do not seem to matter.  \n \nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a short literature review \nof related studies and some stylized facts of export and import performance focusing on \nthe crisis periods. Section 3 outlines the model and econometric specification. Section 4 \ndiscusses  the  data  used  and  estimation  issues.  Results  are  presented  in  Section  5. \nSection 6 concludes. \n \n \n2. \n \nSeveral  reasons  have  been  advanced  to  explain  the  Great  Trade  Collapse  with  the \ndemand factors seemingly more pertinent than the supply factors. Compositional effects \nthat arise because the share of postponables is greater in trade than in GDP appear to \nbe a key demand factor (Levchenko et al. 2009). International production linkages, which \nare  a  central  feature  of  modern  manufacturing  processes,  might  have  more  closely \nsynchronized  the  fall  in  trade  across  countries  (Freund  2009;  Bems  et  al.  2009; \nLevchenko  et  al.  2009;  Altomonte  and  Ottaviano  2009).  The  \u201cKnightian  Uncertainty\u201d  or \nthe fear of unknown that prevailed as the world tilted on the verge of financial meltdown \nand  depression  kept  consumers  and  producers  on  the  sidelines  and  reinforced  the \ncompositional  effects  (Caballero  2009;  Blanchard  2009).  On  the  supply  side  fears  of  a \ncredit  crunch,  thought  to  exacerbate  trade  flows,  fortunately  did  not  really  materialize \n(Levchenko  et  al.  2009;  Mora  and  Powers  2009).  The  crisis  also  did  not  appear  to \nmaterially threaten a country\u2019s production base, which supported the subsequent quick \ntrade  recovery.  Evidence  from  selected  countries  suggest  it  is  the  decline  in  intensive \nmargin\u2014the decline in product varieties sold\u2014that explains the bulk of the adjustment in \ntrade  flows,  rather  than  the  decline  in  extensive  margin\u2014the  decline  in  the  number  of \ntraders  selling  to  a  market  (Bernard  et  al.  2009;  Bricongne  et  al.  2009).  Protectionist \nmeasures also increased during the crisis but they covered only a small fraction of trade \nand  as  a  result  did  not  seem  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  overall  trade  flows \n(Evenett 2009). \n \nStudies that examine the relative performance of imports and exports are few. The key \nfinding  from  Abiad  et  al.  (2011)  covering  153  advanced,  developing,  and  emerging \neconomies provides an intuitively simple reason for why imports fall more than exports: if \na crisis happens in an importing country, then the importing country will buy less. (They \nalso find that if a crisis happens in the exporting country, not the importing country, then \nthe  importing  country\u2019s  imports  will  not  be  significantly  affected).  What  matters  are  the \ndestinations  where  the  goods  and  services  are  heading.  The  authors  also  conjecture \nwhy imports fall more during crises, although they do not directly test them. Tariffs do not \nseem  important  as  the  average  rates  do  not  vary  much  after  crises,  although \nantidumping  measures  tend  to  increase  but  decline  subsequently.  Exchange  rate \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   3 \n\nimports, \n\nfollowed  by \n\nvolatility, however, may be important in the short-run as it tends to rise markedly during a \ncrisis.  \n \nAnderton  and  Tewolde  (2011)  find  that  exports  are  the  most  important  component  of \naggregate  demand  driving \ninvestment,  consumption,  and \ngovernment  spending.  Their  study  is  closest  to  this  paper.  The  authors  estimate  the \nsame  structural  import  demand  function  that  separates  the  different  components  of \naggregate  demand  on  29  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development \n(OECD)  nations  from  1Q95  to  1Q09.  Business  confidence  and  credit  conditions  also \nplay a significant but much smaller role in determining import demand. During the crisis \nperiod  of  4Q08  to  1Q09,  however,  only  stock  changes  have  an  additional  significant \nadverse impact on imports.1 \n \nUnlike Anderton and Tewolde (2011), Bernard et al. (2009), who study the trade margins \nof  United  States  (US)  firms  find  that  international  supply  chains  tend  to  be  better \ninsulated  against  economic  shocks.  They  find  US  trade  with  related  party  firms  fare \nbetter  than  with  arm\u2019s  length  firms.  Based  on  the  latest  US  Census  Bureau\u2019s \nLongitudinal  Firm  Trade  Transactions  database,  which  covers  the  period  of  1992  to \n2005, they find that US exports to related party firms in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand  fell  by  4%  from  1996  to  1998,  while  to  arm\u2019s \nlength  firms  exports  fell  more  by  26%.2  Also,  the  number  of  US  arm\u2019s  length  firms \nexporting to these countries fell more sharply than the US related party firms exporting to \nthe same countries (\u201316% versus \u20137%). More stark is the improvement in the intensive \nmargin of US related party exports of 9% over the same period versus a deterioration of \nUS arm\u2019s length exports of \u20138%. Equally stark is the strength of the intensive margin in \nUS  imports  from  Asian  related  party  firms,  which  rose  26%  versus  the  decline  from \nAsian  arm\u2019s  length  party  of  \u20131%.  All  this  implies  that  US  multinationals  may  have \nadjusted  their  strategies  to  favor  related  party  firms  in  production  chains  and  that  the \nbulk of the burden of adjustment fell on arm\u2019s length firms.  \n \nAsia\u2019s  remarkable  trade  trajectory  with  the  world  is  unmistakable  (Figures  1  and  2).  It \nhas only been seriously punctuated twice, once during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis \nand again during the 2008/09 global financial crisis. (There was also a blip following the \nbursting of the US tech bubble in 2001). During these two crisis periods, import volumes \nfell more than export volumes in most economies. Hong Kong, China and the PRC were \nthe exceptions in 2008/09 because of the massive PRC fiscal stimulus program. Japan \nwas  another  exception,  with  its  imports,  which  were  already  low,  falling  less  than \nexports.  In  1997/98,  the  PRC  was  well  insulated  from  the  contagions  of  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis.3 The fall in imports during the Asian financial crisis in the most affected \n                                                 \n1 \n\nEach of the independent variable is interacted with the crisis dummy, but only the interactive dummy of \ncrisis  and  stock  changes  is  significant.  The  rest  of  the  interactive  crisis  dummies  are  not  significant, \nalthough  each  independent  variable  remains  statistically  significant  except  credit  conditions.  See \nColumn 3, Table 2 of Anderton and Tewolde (2011).  \n\n2  On  the  other  hand,  US  imports  from  Asia,  with  related-party  trade  growing  faster  than  arm\u2019s  length \ntrade,  continued  to  rise  during  this  period.  Since  US  exports  to  (imports  from)  Asia  are  equivalent  to \nAsian imports from (exports to) the US, this and the preceding findings reinforce the key finding of Abiad \net al. (2011), that is, the collapse  of Asian  domestic demand  explains the fall  in its imports during the \nAsian financial crisis.  \nIndia is an outlier in both crisis periods\u2014its exports fell more than imports.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4    |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 96  \n\ncountries  (Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand)  was  much  larger \nthan the fall in imports in these same countries during the global financial crisis. This is \nin line with Abiad et al.\u2019s (2011) key finding that a homegrown crisis has a more severe \nimpact on a country\u2019s imports.  \n \nIt does take some time for imports to recover to pre-crisis levels, but it does not take as \nlong  as  the  10  years  that  Abiad  et  al.  (2011)  found.4  In  the  case  of  the Asian  financial \ncrisis,  Indonesian  imports  took  7  years  to  recover,  while  other  countries\u2019  imports \nrecovered in 1\u20132 years. The latter group includes both the most and less crisis-affected \ncountries. For example, the Republic of Korea took only 1 year, while the Philippines and \nSingapore  took  2  years.  Hence,  it  is  not  always  true  that  imports  in  the  most  crisis-\naffected  countries  recover  slower  than  in  the  less  affected  ones.  In  contrast,  on  the \nexport side, the countries that were most affected by the Asian financial crisis, with the \nexception  of  Thailand,  continued  to  see  an  expansion  in  exports.  In  the  case  of  the \nglobal  financial  crisis,  while  imports  generally  fell  more  than  exports,  both  imports  and \nexports quickly recovered within a year from the trough in 2009.5 \n \n \n3. \n \nThe econometric specification is based on the standard import demand equation where \nimports are expressed as a function of income or aggregate demand, and relative import \nprices  as  a  measure  of  competiveness.  It  is,  however,  further  augmented  with  several \nvariables of interests.

Japan and Thailand\u2019s slow import recovery are likely due to their much weaker \ndomestic conditions. Note that the above analyses were also done using trade values, yet the stylized \nfacts remained largely true. \nThis  follows  Anderton  and  Tewolde  (2011)  who  contend  that  the  six-month  moving  average  is \nsufficiently  long  to  reduce  the  volatility  of  the  quarter-to-quarter  fluctuations  as  well  as  to  capture  the \nrecent movements in the component share.  \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   5 \n\n\u0394\n\nln\n\n\u2211\n\nadd\n\ni\n\n=\n\nadd\n\n\u2211 \u2211\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\nadd\n\ni\n\n\u239b\n\u239c\n\u239c\n\u239d\n\n\u239e\n\u239f\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n \n\u0394\n\nln\n\nadd\n\n;\n\n \n\ni\n\n \nwhere  \u03bbi  is  the  term  in  bracket  and  \u2206ln\u2211addi  comes  from  the  standard  import  demand \nfunction after separating each component of the aggregate demand:  \n \n \n\n= + \u0394\n\nadd\n\nmp\n\nln\n\nln\n\nln\n\nm\n\n\u0394\n\nk\n\n \n\n.\n\n+ \u0394\n\u03b1\n2\n\nij t\n,\n\n\u03b1\n1\n\nj t\n,\n\nj t\n,\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n\nData and Estimation Issues \n\n \nNote  changes  in  stocks  which  are  derived  from  aggregate  demand  are  included  as  a \nseparate  variable  in  order  to  analyze  how  stocking  or  destocking  affects  imports. \nBesides, changes in stocks frequently have negative values, which cannot be logged.

At \nlevels, the Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) test, the Fisher Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), and \nFisher  Phillips-Perron  (PP)  tests  generally  show  that  most  variables  are  non-stationary \n(Table  1).7  (The  null  hypothesis  of  non-stationary  is  seldom  rejected  in  favor  of  the \nalternative that some or at least one panel is stationary). One clear exception is changes \nin stocks, which are stationary. There is also some evidence that the share price index is \nstationary. Yet, intuitively, share price is typically non-stationary. It goes through periods \nof rising and falling interrupted by occasional bouts of wide swings. When the tests are \ncarried  out  at  first  differences,  the  results  show  all  variables  are  stationary  at  the  1% \nlevel.  Hence,  subsequent  estimations  will  use  variables  at  first  differences,  except \nchanges in stock, which remain at levels.   \n\n                                                 \n7 \n\nThese three tests are chosen because they can run on an unbalanced panel.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6    |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 96  \n\nThe  panel  fixed-effects  (FE)  model  with  robust  standard  errors  that  account  for  cross-\nsectional dependence between panels (Driscoll and Kraay 1998) is estimated. Pesaran\u2019s \n(2004) cross sectional independence test suggests cross-panel correlation is a problem.8  \nIn  the  standard  panel  FE  model,  cross-sectional  independence  is  assumed.  Standard \nerrors  calculated  from  the  common  techniques  such  as  ordinary  least  squares,  White \n(robust  to  autocorrelation)  or  Williams/Rogers  (robust  to  heteroskedasticity  and \nautocorrelation) are biased. Hence, statistical inferences based on such standard errors \nare invalid.9 Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors, however, are heteroskedasticity \nand autocorrelation robust to both spatial and temporal dependence.  \n \nTo  examine  the  effects  during  crises,  a  crisis  dummy  for  the  Asian  financial  crisis  and \nanother  for  the  global  financial  crisis  are  created.  Specifically,  the  focus  is  at  the \ndownturn period of the crisis, that is, the period between the pre-crisis peak to the trough \nof  the  crisis.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  recovery  period,  which  is  from  the  trough  to  the \nlevel  that  surpasses  the  pre-crisis  peak.  From  the  import  pattern  of  each  country,  the \ndownturn  period  in  the  Asian  financial  crisis  is  identified  as  4Q97  to  4Q98,  and  in  the \nglobal financial crisis from 3Q08 to 1Q09. Hence, the dummy AFC takes a value of one \nduring the former period and zero otherwise. The same applies for the dummy GFC for \nthe latter period.  \n \n \n5. \n \n5.1  Comparison of Different Estimators \n \nResults of the preferred estimator, panel FE with Driscoll and Kraay standard errors are \nfound in column 4 of Table 2. The first three columns present results of other estimators \nthat  also  serve  as  robustness  checks.  Column  1  shows  the  results  of  pooled  ordinary \nleast  squares  (OLS).  As  expected,  its  standard  errors  tend  to  be  smaller,  producing \nmore  favorable  statistical  inferences  than  the  preferred  estimator.  For  example,  the \ncoefficient  of  government  spending  is  statistically  significant  in  contrast  to  the \ninsignificant  result  in  column  four.  That  said,  the  estimated  parameters  of  the  pooled \nOLS  are  fairly  close  to  the  preferred  estimator.  Column  2  is  the  pooled  mean  group \nestimator  of  Pesaran,  Shin,  and  Smith  (1999).  Its  key  strength  is  in  estimating  non-\nstationary heterogeneous panels of large N and large T.10 In essence, it applies an error \ncorrection  type  model  to  the  panel  data,  whereby  the  intercept,  short-run  coefficients, \nand error variances are allowed to differ across groups, but the long-run coefficients are \nconstrained to be same across the groups. Its results, however, are quite different from \nother  estimators;  the  coefficients  of  the  component  aggregate  demand  exceed  1,  with \nthat of government spending being the largest. More troubling is the wrong sign of loan \n\nResults \n\n                                                 \n8 \n\n9 \n\nThe test is performed after estimating Equation (1). It rejects the null of cross sectional independence at \nthe 1% level. The absolute correlation between residuals is 0.18.  \nThe  panel  FE  model  with  Rogers  standard  errors  was  also  estimated;  interestingly  the  statistical \ninferences remained qualitative the same. The results are not presented but can be obtained from the \nauthor. \n\n10  Estimation  was  directly  done  with  variables  at  levels  via  maximum  likelihood.  In  contrast  to  large  N, \nsmall T panel where the standard FE or random effects (RE) model ignored the time series properties of \nthe data. \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   7 \n\nestimate,  which  is  statistically  significant.  Also,  although  insignificant,  the  coefficient  of \nrelative import prices is positive instead of negative.  \n \nA  common  ad  hoc  way  to  account  for  potential  endogeneity  is  to  lag  the  explanatory \nvariables  by  one  period  (Cerra  and  Saxena  2008).  This  is  done  using  the  preferred \nestimator  in  column  3.  The  results,  however,  also  differ  from  other  estimators.  In \nparticular, the coefficient of consumption is the largest and greater than 1, while that of \nexports is the smallest at 0.48. This does not quite conform to the reality of most Asian \neconomies,  which  are  exports  focused.  In  addition,  the  estimator  has  the  lowest  fit \namong the group\u2014its R2 is only 15%. An alternative but more complex way to address \npotential  endogeneity  is  to  use  the  Arellano  and  Bond  (1991)  and  Arellano  and  Bover \n(1995) generalized method-of-moment estimators. But these estimators are designed for \nlarge N, small T panels (Roodman 2006),11 unlike the panel of small N, large T used in \nthis paper. Hence, it is not applied here. \n  \n5.2 \n \n\nPreferred Estimator and Crisis Periods \n\nIn  column  4  the  estimated  coefficients  of  the  preferred  estimator  prior  to  imposing  the \ncrisis dummies all have the right sign and are statistically significant. (Only government \nspending,  changes  in  stocks,  and  share  prices  are  statistically  insignificant).  Most \nnotable  is  that  exports  have  the  highest  import-intensity  among  the  components  of \naggregate  demand,  followed  by  investment  and  consumption.  High  import-intensity  in \ninvestment  is  also  expected  as  capital  goods  are  often  imported  to  boost  productive \ncapacity.  Lending  is  also  found  to  be  a  positive  determinant  of  imports,  but  not  for \nbusiness and consumer sentiment as proxied by share prices.  \n \nColumn 5 of Table 2 presents the results of the preferred estimator with the inclusion of \nthe AFC and GFC downturn dummies. When these are included, exports still show the \nhighest import-intensity followed by investment. Both are statistically significant, although \nthis  is  not  the  case  for  consumption  and  government  spending.  Relative  import  prices \nremain  negative  and  statistically  significant,  while  lending to  the  private  sector  remains \npositive  and  significant.  In  interactive  terms,  the  Asian  financial  crisis  dummy  has  a \nsignificant impact on government spending followed by exports and changes in stocks. \n(The  g\u00d7AFC,  x\u00d7AFC,  and  s\u00d7AFC  coefficients  are  statistically  significant).  This  implies \nfiscal contractions implemented during the onset of the Asian financial crisis would have \nreduced imports more than otherwise been the case. At the same time, the weak export \nperformance  during  this  period  would  have  also  reduced  imports  even  as  domestic \ndemand  collapsed.12  Likewise,  the  process  of  destocking  during  this  downturn  period \nwould have also further depressed import demand. In contrast, these phenomena were \nrarely seen during the downturn period of the global financial crisis. Only in the case of \nthe  GFC  crisis  dummy  interacting  with  relative  import  prices  was  the  coefficient \nsignificant.  This  suggests  that  price  increases  (decreases)  during  this  period  lead  to  a \nsmaller (larger) fall in imports.13  \n                                                 \n11  For  example,  the  problem  arises  as  the  number  of  instruments  in  difference  and  system  generalized \n\nmethod of moments (GMM) becomes too unwieldy as T increases.  \n\n12  This refers to the early period of the crisis when exports in many economies did fall.  \n13  The net effect is still negative (\u20130.2606+0.1799), though it is smaller than the impact outside the global \n\nfinancial crisis period, which is \u20130.2606. \n\n \n\n\f8    |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 96  \n\nEconomic Interpretation \n\nSurprisingly, share prices tend to have a significant negative impact on imports in both \ncrisis  periods.  This  seems  counterintuitive  at  first  glance,  but  is  likely  to  reflect  the \nnatural sentiment of businesses and consumers as they remain cautious in the midst of \ngreat  uncertainty.  This  sentiment  would  be  most  pronounced  in  the  early  part  of  the \ncrisis, as the crisis dummies here measure, when businesses and consumers have little \nidea  of  when  the  situation  might  improve.  Therefore,  in  the  face  of  already  severely \nbleak  economic  and  unemployment  prospects,  their  spending  would  not  be  likely  to \nrecover  as  quickly  as  any  upswing  in  share  prices.  In  fact,  there  is  some  evidence  to \nsupport this more restrained or lagged impact of business and consumer sentiment on \nimports.  When  the  model  is  run  with  one-period  lagged  share  prices,  instead  of \ncontemporaneous  share  prices,  all  else  remains  unchanged,  the  crisis  interactive \ndummy  of  GFC  becomes  positive and  significant,  while  that  of  AFC is  still  negative  but \ninsignificant.14  \n \n5.3 \n \nTo  provide  economic  interpretation  to  the  results  in  Table  2,  the  actual  component \nelasticities  of  aggregate  demand  are  calculated  and  presented  in  Table  3.  Column  1 \nrepeats the estimates of each component of aggregate demand (\u03b11i) as found in column \n4  of  Table  2.  Columns  2\u20134  show  the  component  share  of  aggregate  demand  (\u03bbi)  at \ndifferent  time  periods:  the  beginning  of  the  sample,  the  end  of  the  sample,  and  the \naverage  of  the  whole  sample.  The  last  three  columns  are  the  component  elasticity \nobtained  by  multiplying  each  component  estimate  (\u03b11i)  from  column  1  with  the \ncorresponding component share of aggregate demand (\u03bbi) at the different time periods. \n \nA few points stand out. First, the share of exports in aggregate demand has grown most \nnoticeably  over  the  period  while  the  share  of  the  other  components  has  fallen.  It  grew \nfrom 28% in 1991 to 41% in 2011. In the OECD countries, this share grew from 25% in \n1996  to  35%  in  2008  (Anderton  and  Tewolde  2011).  This  increase  underlines  the \ngrowing  importance  of  trade  in  a  country\u2019s  output,  particularly  in  Asia.  Also,  given  that \ninternational  production  sharing  represents  the  key  driver  of  rapid  trade  expansion  in \nAsia, more so than in North America and Europe (Athukorola 2010), the high and rising \nshare  of  exports  in  Asia  highlights  the  greater  role  vertical  specialization  plays  in \ndetermining the demand for imports in Asia.  \n \nSecond, hardly surprisingly, the component elasticity of exports rose from 0.48% in 1991 \nto 0.71% in 2011. This means a one unit (percent) increase in exports increases imports \nby  0.71  unit  (percent)  in  2011.  While  this  does  not  mean  that  imports  tend  to  increase \n(decrease) more than the increase (decrease) in exports, as it is anecdotally observed, it \nstill  implies  that  both  exports  and  imports  move  in  the  same  direction.  Exports,  by \nimplication  of  international  production  linkages,  can  cushion  or  worsen  imports \ndepending  on  exports\u2019  final  demand.  Because  of  this  effect,  increased  vertical \nspecialization  is  said  to  have  closely  synchronized  trade  contraction  among  countries \nduring the global financial crisis. \n                                                 \n14 \n\nIt should not be a surprise that the interactive AFC dummy  with share prices is negative. In this case, \nthe cautious wait-and-see attitude would have lasted even longer considering the deep and protracted \nimpact of the Asian financial crisis. Separately, the lagged share price (without interacting with any crisis \ndummies) remains insignificant in this estimation. \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   9 \n\nConclusion \n\nThird,  notwithstanding  the  above,  it  is  still  true  that  imports  tend  to  change  more  than \nexports, especially when the elasticity of imports with respect to total aggregate demand \nis  considered.  While  it  is  true  that  a  one  unit  change  in  exports  does  not  lead  to  more \nthan one unit change in imports, but one unit change in aggregate demand does. (The \naverage  elasticity  of  imports  with  respect  to  total  aggregate  demand  is  1.26.  This  has \ngrown larger over time). Therefore, in times of crisis, when all components of aggregate \ndemand  tend  to  move  in  the  same  direction,  imports  will  fall  more  than  exports.  In \naddition, credit conditions may have worsened leading to a further decline in imports.  \n \n \n6. \n \nThis paper attempts to shed some light on the observed phenomenon that imports tend \nto fall more than exports, especially during crises. To do this, a standard import demand \nequation with several modifications is estimated. A key feature is the separation of the \ndifferential  and  time-varying  impact  of  aggregate  demand  broken  into  its  expenditure \ncomponents  of  consumption,  investment,  government  spending,  and  exports.  Another \naugmentation  is  the  inclusion  of  several  variables  typically  hypothesized  to  have \nimportant  influence  on  imports.  These  are  credit  conditions,  which  facilitate  trading \nactivity,  and  business  and  consumer  sentiment,  which  proxies  for  private  sector \nspending. In terms of the estimation method, a panel FE model that accounts for cross-\nsectional  dependence  is  employed.  The  standard  panel  FE  model  assumes  cross-\nsectional independence and as such produces standard errors that are biased leading to \ninvalid  statistical  inferences.  The  paper  also  tries  several  other  estimators,  one  in \nparticular that attempts to account for potential endogeneity. However, in this and other \nestimators,  the  results  do  not  always  conform  to  a priori.  An  unbalanced  panel  of  11 \nAsian economies\u2014the PRC; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; the \nPhilippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand\u2014is estimated from 1Q91 to 2Q11.  \n \nGiven that international production linkages have become an intrinsic feature of trade in \nthe region, one would expect this to be borne out in the results. This paper lends support \nto this observation, at least indirectly. First, the share of exports in aggregate demand is \nthe  only  component  that  has  grown  over  the  sample  period  to  become  the  largest. \nSecond  and  more  important  is  the  positive  relationship  found  between  exports  and \nimports. This is key because it implies that as long as the demand for exports remains \nstrong,  even  as  domestic  demand  weakens,  any  adverse  impact  on  imports  resulting \nfrom  the  latter  will  be  cushioned.  On  the  other  hand,  if  domestic  demand  and  external \ndemand  weaken  at  the  same  time,  then  the  impact  on  imports  will  be  more  severe. \nWhile the fall in exports will lead to a concomitant fall in imports, it is unlikely to be strong \nenough to cause imports to fall more than exports. What it takes is the decline in other \ncomponents  of  the  aggregate  demand  such  as  investment  and  consumption,  which \nhappens most notably during crisis periods. Import prices and credit conditions are also \nfound  to  have  a  positive  and  negative  influence  on  imports  respectively.  Changes  in \nstocks and share prices that gauge business and consumer sentiment do not seem to be \nimportant.  \n \nFocusing on the downturn period of the Asian financial crisis and global financial crisis \nreveal some interesting results. Fiscal contractions implemented during the early part of \n\n \n\n\f10    |   Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 96  \n\nthe Asian financial crisis would have exacerbated imports more than otherwise been the \ncase. Also, the fall in exports in most countries and the destocking process during this \nperiod would have  worsened the fall in imports. In contrast, none of these phenomena \nwas  evident  during  the  downturn  period  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  For  one,  most \ncountries pursued an expansionary fiscal policy early on. In addition, perhaps the greater \nprevalence  of  international  production  linkages  with  just-in-time  inventory  systems \nalleviated  the  effects  of  changes  in  stocks.  Somewhat  counterintuitive  is  the  negative \nimpact  of  share  prices  on  imports  during  both  crisis  periods.  Yet,  this  seems  to  have \nbeen due to the lagged or wait-and-see attitude of businesses and consumers during the \nearly part of the crisis. \n \n \n\n\fWhy Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During Crises?   |   11 \n\nReferences \n \n \nA.

Specifically, the ratio of the nominal GDP to real GDP is the \nGDP  deflator,  while  the  ratio  of  the  nominal  imports  to  real  imports  is  the  imports \ndeflator. In turn, real import price is taken to be the ratio of the import deflator to the GDP \ndeflator.  All  raw  data  from  the  first  column  are  sourced  from  CEIC,  except  for  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  which  are  from  Oxford  Economics.  They  are  in  local \ncurrency. To ensure they have the same unit currencies, they are expressed in millions \nof US$. For some countries in order to have a long time series that is based on the new \nbase year, the growth rates from the older series are used to extend the new series to as \nfar  back  as  possible.  This  is  done  for  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines. \nThe data used in estimations are seasonally adjusted using X12. \n \nClaims  on  the  private  sector  of  other  depository  banks  (also  known  as  deposit  money \nbanks  or  banking  institutions)  are  items  22D  from  the  IMF\u2019s  International  Financial \nStatistics  (IFS).  The  same  data  for  Taipei,China  are  sourced  from  its  central  bank. \nAgain, to have the longest series the growth rates of the older series are used to extend \nthe new series to as far back as possible.

Several important \nvariables in explaining import demand are also included. Based on a sample of 11 Asian \neconomies from 1Q91 to 2Q11, the result shows the import intensity of exports is the highest \namong all variables. Alone, however, it does not contribute to a larger fall in imports. The \nlarger decline in imports is evident if other components of aggregate demand also fall, \nparticularly investment and consumption. A weakened credit condition will also exacerbate \nthe fall in imports. Business and consumer sentiment, however, does not seem to matter.  \n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite \nthe region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion \npeople who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. \nADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\nBased in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main \n\ninstruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity \ninvestments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org/poverty\nPublication Stock No.  WPS124491 \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration\n", "Why Do Imports Fall More than Exports Especially During \nCrises?
