To manage their FX risk, they \nmay want to hedge that exposure for a period of time. They also want to be sure they can easily convert \nthe local currency to dollars upon the sale of a bond.\n\nWhile the scope of this study is ASEAN+3, it focuses on five economies in particular: the Republic of \nKorea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, which are collectively referred to as the KIMPT \neconomies.  The  other  ASEAN+3  economies  either  have  very  liquid  FX  markets  (Hong  Kong,  China; \nJapan; and Singapore) or have markets that are still embryonic (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet\u00a0 Nam).  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  warrants  a \nspecial study of its own and is beyond the scope of this study. \n\nDetailed  data  on  hedging  activity  for  the  five  KIMPT  economies  are  not  readily  available;  therefore, \nthis  report  relies  extensively  on  conversations  with  a  number  of  important  investors  and  their  service \nproviders. From these conversations, it is clear that the hedging instrument most commonly used by bond \ninvestors is the FX forward rather than the cross-currency swap. FX forward markets are generally more \nliquid and flexible, can be easily rolled over, and suit investors\u2019 need to hedge the value of a portfolio rather \nthan a series of bond cash flows. Swaps are used by investors to take a position rather than to hedge, and \nby issuers to hedge their debt servicing obligations. FX options are used sparingly.\n\n1  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\fExecutive Summary\n\nThere are a number of reasons that the KIMPT economies merit special attention:\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022 All five economies have active FX markets.\n \u2022 Under normal market conditions, cross-border bond investors can easily hedge exposures in \nthe five KIMPT currencies (Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, Philippine\u00a0peso, \nand Thai baht) in the non-deliverable forward (NDF)/offshore market. But in times of stress, \ndistortions can appear.\nIn each economy, the local authorities have put in place some form of capital controls whereby \nonshore FX and FX hedging transactions are regulated on a \u201creal demand principle\u201d basis\u2014the \ntransaction must be linked to a qualifying underlying asset or transaction. These constraints \nare driven by the need to monitor and manage capital flows in and out of the economies in \norder to limit unwanted speculation.\nFor reasons detailed in this report, many overseas investors rely on the NDF/offshore market to \nhedge their FX exposure even when they could legitimately use the onshore market because \nof their real demand.\nLocal  laws,  in  particular  bankruptcy  laws,  are  not  as  supportive  as  they  could  be  of  the \ndevelopment of the onshore FX and interest rate swap markets, and this further limits cross-\nborder investors\u2019 appetite for hedging onshore.\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022 With  the  notable  exception  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  more  recently  Malaysia,  not  all \nmeasures required for well-developed, liquid, domestic debt capital markets have been put \nin place. Liquid onshore debt capital markets are important to the development of the liquid \nonshore hedging markets. \n\nCapital controls and real demand principle regulations are designed to limit certain FX transactions and \ntherefore represent barriers that inhibit onshore FX trading and restrict onshore FX markets. \n\nThey also add complexity to the purchase, sale, and hedging of cross-border bond investments by bona \nfide  investors.  Their  impact  is  described  in  Section  4.1  of  this  report.  In  addition  to  higher  costs,  the \ncomplexity (or perceived complexity) significantly reduces the range of overseas investors, thus impacting \nthe liquidity of FX markets and local currency bond markets. \n\nThese regulations effectively fence off the onshore market from the offshore market. When liquidity is \ndivided into two pools, NDF/offshore FX and onshore FX, each pool is significantly less liquid and therefore \nmore volatile. FX volatility adds costs to investors and is not desired by regulators.\n\nThe  ideal  situation\u2014from  both  an  issuer\u2019s  and  an  investor\u2019s  perspective\u2014would  be  more  integrated \nNDF/offshore and onshore FX markets to effectively create one pool of liquidity. Reducing the barriers \nto domestic markets and making domestic debt markets more liquid would help this integration. Because \nFX markets and debt capital markets are linked, the liquidity of the debt and FX markets reinforce each \nother and thereby lower volatility.\n\nSingapore has achieved this outcome. Malaysia has moved a long way in this direction and could be a useful \nexample of an interim regulatory regime in the process of integrating NDF/offshore and onshore\u00a0markets.\n\nviii\n\n\fExecutive Summary\n\nWhile  investors  can  generally  manage  their  FX  risk  offshore  today,  this  report  attempts  to  identify  the \nmajor  issues  they  face  in  hedging  FX  risk  onshore,  and  makes  a  number  of  recommendations  toward \nmaking  onshore  markets  more  accessible  and  more  integrated  with  offshore  markets.  The  proposed \nmeasures also aim to widen the overseas investor base given that the best route to market stability is to \nhave the widest and most diversified investor base.\n\nRecommendations \n\nI. \n\n Consider  measures  that  would  make  it  easier  for  foreign  investors  to  transact  in  the  FX  and \nFX hedging markets. Consider reviewing the real demand principle regulations associated with \ncapital controls. The aim would be to reduce, as much as reasonable, barriers that separate the  \nNDF/offshore market from the onshore market in a measured and suitably sequenced program, \nwith  the  emphasis  on  making  access  easier  for  bona  fide  investors  while  simultaneously \ncontinuing to protect the currency from substantial short-term speculation:\n\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nconsider reviewing the rules on cash balances, overdrafts, and borrowings;\nconsider reviewing the rules applicable to bond investors hedging onshore; \nconsider reviewing market information flows to ensure all investors, including foreign \ninvestors, have timely and appropriate information on domestic FX market activity;\nconsider reviewing the restrictions on domestic banks that limit their participation in \nthe offshore FX and FX hedging markets;\nconsider ensuring the availability of US dollars for bond investors when they exit;\nconsider allowing offshore FX contracts to be deliverable onshore; and\ngenerally aim to lower resulting investor execution, compliance, and documentation \ncosts.\n\nII. \n\n Improve liquidity of onshore FX derivatives markets to facilitate their integration with offshore \nFX markets: \n\nconsider  taking  further  steps  to  develop  the  domestic  legal  framework  to  ensure \nsuitable treatment of derivatives and repurchases (repos) in bankruptcy in line with \nBasel\u00a0III requirements, with the long-term aim of ensuring a clean legal opinion from \nthe International Swaps and Derivatives Association and consistently suitable netting \ntreatment under Basel III; and\nconsider reviewing the domestic FX fixing process to ensure it is always transparent \nand fair to all. \n\nIII. \n\n Improve  cross-border  access  to  local  currency  government  bond  markets  and  hence  their \nliquidity, which reinforces the development of onshore FX  markets:  \n\ncontinue to implement the measures identified by the Group of Experts under the Asian \nBond  Markets  Initiative  and  those  included  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n2013 report Broadening the Investor Base for Local Currency Bonds in ASEAN+2 Countries;  \n\nix\n\n\fExecutive Summary\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nconsider exempting from domestic withholding tax income earned by cross-border \ninvestors in local currency government bonds (applicable to Indonesia, the Republic \nof Korea, and the Philippines); \nconsider reviewing the barriers that discourage offshore investors from using existing \nlinks between local central securities depositories and central banks with international \ncentral securities depositories, and other global custodians (and their equivalent), so \nthat offshore investors that choose to do so can more easily settle their bond sales \nand purchases through subaccounts offshore (applicable to Indonesia, the Republic \nof Korea, and the Philippines); \nconsider issuing larger and deeper series of government bonds; \ncontinue to promote the development of a repo market;\nconsider allowing cross-border repo of government bonds;\nconsider strengthening the primary dealer system;\ncontinue to promote the development of the domestic institutional savings sector;\ncontinue  to  promote  the  development  of  the  information  and  communication \ntechnology infrastructure that supports bond markets; \nconsider  promoting  the  use  of  the  Global  Legal  Entity  Identifier  that  will  assist \ncommunications between regulators; and\nconsider ways to reduce the cost and time needed to onboard new investors.\n\nx\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n1\nThe impediments to local currency foreign exchange (FX) and FX hedging are largely associated \n\nwith insufficient liquidity resulting from underdeveloped FX and debt capital markets, as well as \ncurrency  convertibility  constraints  imposed  by  authorities  in  the  economy  of  the  issuer.  These \nconstraints vary considerably across ASEAN+3, which comprises the 10 members of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n\nHong  Kong,  China;  Japan;  and  Singapore.  These  three  economies  have  liquid  local  currency  FX  and \nFX  hedging  markets,  and  their  currencies  are  considered  convertible.  They  have  limited  specific  FX \nregulations. For example, the only notable regulation in Singapore limits the amount of Singapore dollars \nthat certain categories of offshore borrowers can borrow from Singapore resident financial institutions for \nuse offshore. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar and is a special\u00a0case.\n\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. The \noverall size and breadth of these economies and their financial markets means that it will be some time \nbefore their markets will be liquid. The bond markets and the FX markets of these economies are in their \ninfancy. Recommendations for their development will need to be extensive, detailed, and tailored to their \nstarting point\u2014and are beyond the scope of this study. \n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China. The development of Chinese renminbi hedging markets, both onshore \nand offshore, is being managed by various government bodies in a very deliberate manner, taking into \naccount the unique characteristics of the domestic economy and its markets. The domestic authorities \nhave a well-defined path. A review of this unique and complex case is also beyond the scope of this study.\n\nThe Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. These five economies, which \nare collectively referred to in this report as the KIMPT economies, have partially convertible currencies with \nregulations that constrain onshore FX and FX hedging transactions. Regulations differ by economy, but all \nhave the common objectives of protecting the domestic currency and economy from abusive currency \nspeculation,  and  managing  unwanted  or  excessive  currency  flows.  These  regulations  are  designed  to \nrestrict certain transactions, resulting in more complicated FX risk management that warrants\u00a0review.\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\nThis report makes recommendations to improve the liquidity of onshore FX markets while taking into \naccount the need to monitor and manage cross-border capital flows. Improved liquidity in onshore FX \nmarkets  will  improve  the  liquidity  of  local  currency  bond  markets  (and  vice  versa),  and  help  integrate \nonshore and offshore markets. Improved liquidity will make these markets better able to withstand shocks \nand facilitate risk management for all.\n\nAs  statistical  data  are  not  readily  available  in  sufficient  detail,  the  report  is  based  on  discussions  that \ntook  place  in  June\u2013October  2014  and  comprised  a  broad  range  of  international  market  participants, \nrepresenting approximately 30 entities. These include the investment community (e.g., fund managers, \ninternational asset managers, and their back offices); their global bankers, both fixed income and FX; local \nand global custodians; trade associations and the service providers (e.g., law firms) that assist them; and \nvarious thought leaders. As local investors do not need FX to buy bonds in their local currency, the report \nfocuses on investors active in cross-border transactions. \n\nDiscussions with investors and their advisors revealed that many investors in Asian bonds do not hedge \ntheir FX risk. Their objective is often to get exposure to both the domestic interest rate and the FX rate. \nThose that do hedge FX risk can do so easily in offshore markets, except in times of stress. For example, \nsome implied interest rates in the Indonesian rupiah non-deliverable forward (NDF) market were negative \nin 2013 as a result of an imbalance between supply and demand. Bond investors typically hedge the value \nof their investment (not the future cash flow) using offshore FX forwards. FX forwards are more liquid and \nflexible, and suit their needs better than swaps. \n\nWhile hedging offshore is easy, hedging onshore is more complicated in the KIMPT economies because \nof  the  \u201creal  demand  principle\u201d  regulations  put  in  place  by  local  authorities  to  control  capital  flows. \nThese regulations, which generally prohibit onshore hedges that are not tied to an underlying qualifying \ntransaction, are targeted at speculators but affect all investors. The impact of these regulations on bona \nfide investors is detailed in Section 4.1. Because of their perceived complexity, the rules reduce significantly \nthe demand from smaller bona fide investors that could potentially bring stability and diversity, and reduce \nthe borrowing cost for issuers. The regulations also separate the onshore market from the offshore market.\n\nWhile  the  existence  of  offshore  markets  is  not  undesirable  per  se,  two  silos  of  liquidity  are  much  less \nliquid than one consolidated market. Therefore, integrating the onshore and offshore FX markets would \ngenerally be beneficial. To do this, the real demand principle rules may need to be updated to reflect the \ngrowth of these markets and, if possible, streamlined. Also, the development of the legal framework for \nan onshore derivatives market may need to be accelerated to make onshore markets more attractive to \nall investors and to have the widest possible range of investors. As a result, speculative and opportunistic \ninvestors will represent a smaller minority and hopefully be less disruptive. The markets, by being more \nliquid, will be more resilient.\n\nThe rest of the report is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the different investor types and \ntheir hedging behavior. In Section 3, we review the hedging instruments and markets used by investors. In \nSection\u00a04.1, we describe the impediments to onshore hedging and FX markets, and make recommendations \non how rules could be made more market-friendly and transactions less costly. In Section 4.2, we present \n\n2\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nrecommendations  for  increasing  domestic  FX  market  liquidity,  which  would  lead  to  the  improvement \nand integration of onshore and NDF/offshore FX markets. In Section 4.3, we present recommendations \nfor improving domestic government bond market liquidity. In Section 5, we conclude by summarizing the \nrecommendations.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nBond Market Investors  \nand Their Behavior\n\nIt is useful to categorize various bond market investors in order to analyze their investment and hedging \n\nbehavior.  However,  it  is  not  possible  to  obtain  volume  or  pricing  statistics  with  sufficient  granularity \nacross  Asia,  nor  even  for  the  five  focus  economies,  that  would  permit  a  detailed  analysis  of  cross-\nborder  investments,  offshore  FX,  and  FX  hedging  by  investor  category.  Some  central  banks  have  such \ninformation on their markets but generally do not release this publicly. The comments below are based \non conversations with important market participants.\n\nIndividuals.  Globally, individuals hold less than 3% of bonds directly. Individuals will generally invest in \nbonds indirectly via the institutional savings sector. While we have no statistics for cross-border investment \nby individuals into the KIMPT economies, the amounts are assumed to be small and will not be a focus \narea for this report. Also, retail investors who invest directly themselves typically do not hedge their FX \nexposure.\n\nAsian institutional savings sector. This sector includes pension funds; insurance companies; mutual funds; \ndedicated bond funds, including exchange-traded funds; and hedge funds.  The domestic institutional \nsavings  sector  based  in  one  ASEAN+3  economy  makes  relatively  limited  cross-border  investments \nin bonds issued by  other  ASEAN+3 economies. With a few exceptions, the Asian institutional savings \nsector is still in its infancy and remains domestically focused. In the case of Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia,  and  Singapore,  where  this  sector  is  more  established,  conversations  with  the  global  banks \nsuggest that the portion of overseas investment is still very modest, with the main destination for overseas \nbond investments being the deep and liquid markets in Europe and the United States (US). In addition, \nAsian institutional savings  sector  investors may not have credit approval to invest directly in all five of \nthe focus economies due to their often lower credit ratings than the more attractive European and US \ndestinations. Also, withholding tax in some of these economies may make their bonds less attractive than \nthose in developed economies without such a tax.\n\nOur research found some investments from Japan and the Republic of Korea in Malaysian bonds, and by \nsome Thai investors in Korean bonds, but reliable data are limited. We understand these investments are \nmodest relative to the size of total cross-border investments. \n\n\fBond Market Investors and Their Behavior\n\nAustralian  and  New  Zealand  institutional  investors,  such  as  superannuation  funds,  report  that  they \ninvest little in ASEAN+3 bonds, typically because their mandates are comparatively restrictive, and partly \nbecause their domestic tax systems favor investments in equities.  \n\nGiven these findings and because institutional investors outside of Asia provide the bulk of cross-border \ninvestments in Asian bonds, this report is largely based on input from such investors based in Europe and \nthe US, as well as their supporting service providers, including asset managers, banks, lawyers, custodians, \nand  trade  associations.  However,  as  a  rising  tide  raises  all  ships,  improved  FX  and  FX  hedging  markets \nwill  be  good  for  both  current  and  future  cross-border  investors  in  Asian  economies.  Therefore,  the \nrecommendations in this report will encourage more intra-Asian, cross-border investments in bonds.\n\nIt  is  useful  to  divide  the  investor  universe  into  two  broad  categories  of  selling  behavior:  cyclical  and \nstructural. Cyclical investors are short-term, more opportunistic, and driven by trading opportunities and \ntheir view of short-term relative value. They will try to sell ahead of any expected downturn in the FX or \nbond markets. Structural investors are long-term and driven by the need to diversify and pick up yield. \nThey will generally ride out anticipated downturns in market prices unless these are expected to be very \nlarge and/or permanent.\n\nIn the following subcategories, the only truly cyclical investor group is the first one: traders, hedge funds, \nand some sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). However, it is difficult for regulators to distinguish between a \ncyclical trade and a structural trade. The real demand principle regulations attempt to do this. Nevertheless, \nthe real demand principle barriers affect them all and inhibit structural investors, especially smaller ones. \nThe extent to which barriers can be ameliorated for the structural investor is described in Section 4.1.\n\nTraders at banks\u2019 trading desks and leveraged hedge funds. These are typical cyclical investors aiming \nfor an absolute return. They will trade when their view of the future value of a position is different from \nthe value in the market. They will take positions that reflect their view of the outlook for the local currency \ninterest rate and the FX rate. These traders act on both positive and negative views. These actions might \nbe of concern to regulators and therefore much of the exchange control regime is directed at limiting \ntheir  actions.  Collectively,  they  can  create  momentum  in  the  currency  markets  that  is  unwelcome.  At \ntimes, they can bet against the central bank. While these investors are opportunistic and can be seen as \nspeculators, outside crisis periods they are useful to the market as they provide liquidity. In times of stress, \nthey  will  often  buy  FX  and  bonds  when  others  are  selling,  thus  providing  needed  market  liquidity  at  a \ndifficult time.  \n\nEmerging  market  dedicated  bond  funds,  including  Exchange-Traded  Funds.  Investors  in  emerging \nmarket funds are seeking diversification  and  the higher yields offered by emerging market debt. While \nthese are structural investors, their behavior can appear cyclical in times of stress.\n\nRetail funds represent about 40% of emerging market funds. Retail investors subscribe directly to these, \nand consequently such funds are subject to changes in the expectations of retail investors. For example, \nin 2013, there was a fear that the US Federal Reserve would start the tapering of quantitative easing, which \nled  to  a  widespread  belief  that  emerging  market  bonds  would  underperform.  Retail  investors  rapidly \n\n5\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\nwithdrew  their  money  from  emerging  market  funds,  an  action  that  was  referred  to  as  \u201crisk  off.\u201d    This \nforced emerging market fund managers to sell their assets (emerging market bonds) to obtain the cash \nneeded to meet the redemption requests. As many emerging market funds sold emerging market bonds \nat the same time, emerging market bond prices dropped. Selling local currency bonds means that local \ncurrency must also be sold. Exchange rates were thus affected, further lowering the US dollar value of \nemerging market bonds, which in turn encouraged fund managers to sell even more quickly before the \nprice dropped further. The drop in prices resulted in a drop in the net asset values of emerging market \nfunds and that affected their performance, which was noticed by other retail investors, prompting further \nredemption requests by retail investors and additional bond sales and FX transactions.\n\nWhen emerging market bonds are expected to outperform other asset classes, a similar process occurs in \nreverse, with retail investors\u2019 money flowing into emerging market funds, which is referred to as \u201crisk on.\u201d \nThis is money that fund managers will need to invest.  \n\nBecause they often sell when the market is going down and buy when the market is going up, there is an \nappearance that fund managers are cyclical traders. In fact, the selling is prompted by the end investor\u2019s \nperception of the relative attractiveness of emerging market bonds, not by the fund manager\u2019s wish to \nspeculate\u2014nor, importantly, by his view of the future direction of the market. \n\nJ.P. Morgan and HSBC publish the most widely followed emerging market and Asian indices that include \nour  five  focus  economies.  A  large  number  of  funds  track  these  indices  or  a  modified  version  of  the \nindex. More than 90% of emerging market bond exchange-traded funds are passively invested as index \ntrackers  where  asset  managers  take  no  view.  Their  mandate  is  to  replicate  the  indices,  holding  all  the \nassets included in the index in identical proportions. That also means that when they face redemptions, \nfor example, they need to sell each bond in proportion to its share of the index. \n\nDepending on their mandate and their manager, funds will hedge their currency exposure. For example, \nthere are two versions of the J.P. Morgan Government Bond Index - Emerging Market Global Diversified \n(JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified)\u2014one that is hedged and one that is not hedged. In the hedged version, \na fund replicating the index would need to use 1-month NDFs at the end of each month and roll them \nforward every month. However, from our conversations with market participants, it seems that more than \n90% of the index trackers track the unhedged index and therefore will not hedge.\n\nFunds that do not track any index will have more flexibility to act on their views. They often keep an eye \non the index, but in order to outperform their peers, they will time their entry into and their withdrawal \nfrom a particular market in view of their expectations of future price movements, as well as expectations \nof redemptions and inflows into their fund. They will also try to time their hedging activity to improve \nfund performance. Their decision to hedge the FX risk (or not) will be driven by their mandate and their \nview of the FX market. As emerging market bond funds, they often need to be nearly fully invested in \nemerging market bonds. The simplest and most cost-effective way to express their views is by adjusting \nthe timing of their investment and the level of hedging. In times of stress in the FX markets and when \ninvestor redemptions are anticipated, a fund manager will anticipate that bonds need to be sold to meet \nredemption requirements and may move the hedge to 100% so as to lock in the fund\u2019s net asset value.  \n\n6\n\n\fBond Market Investors and Their Behavior\n\nEmerging  market  retail  versus  institutional  funds.  In  general,  retail  funds  will  not  hedge  their  FX  risk \nbecause the retail investor is seeking exposure to emerging markets, which includes the FX exposure. They \nwill rapidly pull out if this is no longer expected to be attractive. Institutional emerging market dedicated \nfunds will tend to be stickier than retail funds because asset allocation decisions by the investing institution \nare generally taken with a longer time horizon. They may, in comparable circumstances, stay invested in \nbonds and hedge the FX risk when this makes sense.\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  pullbacks  in  the  level  of  cross-border  investments  described  above  are \ngenerally  relatively  short-term.  The  reduction  in  cross-border  investment  in  Indonesian  government \nbonds, for example, in May\u2013August 2013, which was known as the \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d was short-lived. By \nthe end of 2013, total cross-border investment in Indonesian government bonds was back to the same \nlevel as the beginning of 2013. Similarly, the level of global cross-border investments in emerging market \ndebt in April 2014 was higher than in April 2013. The long-term trend is for an increase in investment in \nemerging market debt, simply because the aggregate amount of institutional savings is growing and they \nneed long-term, fixed-income assets to match their liabilities. Furthermore, there is reason to assume in \ncoming years that the US pension fund industry will increase its asset allocation in emerging markets. For \nevery 1% increase in allocation, the total funds available for investing in Asian emerging market debt will \nincrease by several hundred billion dollars, enough to impact these markets.\n\nConsequently, policies and measures to address these temporary changes in end-investor demand may \nnot be needed in the long run. They are often not very effective and will generally not be helpful to market \ndevelopment. The target of FX rate management should probably be to continue to keep FX rates in line \nwith medium-term economic fundamentals.\n\nGlobal crossover funds. These funds comprise a mix of developed market bonds and emerging market \nbonds.  They  invest  with  the  same  philosophy  as  emerging  market  funds,  but  have  somewhat  more \nflexibility  as  they  can  change  the  developed\u2013emerging  market  mix  depending  on  their  view  and  their \nmandate. The outlook for global bonds in general, not just emerging market bonds, will influence their \ninvestors\u2019 flows. Again, there are two broad categories\u2014the index trackers and the total return funds\u2014\nand their hedging rationale is similar to that of emerging market funds discussed above.\n\nDedicated emerging market funds and global crossover funds are usually long the local currency\u2014often \ntheir  mandate  prevents  them  from  going  short\u2014and  therefore  their  transactions  in  the  NDF/offshore \nand onshore hedging markets are generally defensive not speculative. FX regulations should be designed \nin a way that is friendly to these investors. The bond investors most likely to take speculative positions are \nbank trading desks, leveraged hedge funds, and some SWFs.\n\nCentral banks. In contrast to the Asian institutional savings sector, Asian central banks invest in regional \nbonds, although a high portion of Asian central banks\u2019 foreign reserves are still in euro-, Japanese yen-, \nand US dollar-denominated bonds. Central banks will generally invest in emerging market bonds in one \nof two ways. First, they buy bonds directly in their own name. This has the advantage of enhancing their \nrelationship with the issuing economy but the disadvantage of being difficult, for relationship reasons, to \nsell in times of market stress. Investments through this channel will therefore tend to be long-term and \n\n7\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\npart of the bank\u2019s reserve management and diversification strategy. The duration of individual investments \nwill, however, tend to be shorter (reportedly around 3 years). Central banks generally prefer markets with \nhigher-quality credit and greater liquidity. Second, they invest in European or US-based emerging market \nfunds.  This  has  the  advantage  of  anonymity  and  allows  them  to  exit  in  times  of  stress.  However,  they \nhave less direct control on where the funds are invested. They also may not benefit from the reduction in \nwithholding tax, a concession often granted to central banks and SWFs when investing directly in emerging \nmarket bonds. Central banks tend not to hedge their exposure, as the purpose of their investment is to \ndiversify their reserves.\n\nSovereign wealth funds. Many SWFs can be conservative and invest in the same manner as central banks \n(long-term, structural investors) and therefore will not hedge. Others can be aggressive and invest in the \nsame  way  as  leveraged  hedge  funds  (short-term  cyclical  investors).  Some  established  Asian  SWFs  are \naggressively investing in Asian bonds as they have easy access to relevant information, can follow markets \nclosely, and execute transactions well. These behave more like cyclical investors and may act on views and \njoin the momentum created by the banks and hedge funds.\n\n8\n\n\fGeneral Comments  \non Foreign Exchange  \nand Foreign Exchange Hedging \n\n3\nIn addition to the income from a bond, one key factor in determining the actual return on a cross-border \n\nbond investment is the exchange rate realized on exit. FX hedges are designed to reduce the risk of FX \nlosses on exit by locking in the FX rate ahead of time. \n\nTypically, bond investors will only hedge the FX exposure and keep exposure to the domestic interest rate. \nThis is because if they hedged all future cash flows from their bond investments into dollars, they would \nget a dollar rate of return much lower than comparable US Treasuries and with a higher risk. In normal \nmarket conditions, it would make more sense economically to sell the bonds.\n\nFX forwards are ideal for hedging a bond portfolio\u2019s FX exposure given that the FX exposure is the value of \nthe bonds. The realized FX rate on exit is very important; therefore, any basis risk\u2014the difference between \nthe hedging FX rate and the actual exit FX rate realized\u2014is problematic. This can occur when using an \nNDF because, as the name implies, the currency is not delivered.\n\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, it is important that the\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nonshore market has sufficient liquidity to enable the investor to purchase US dollars when the \nbond is sold,\nonshore spot FX fixing process should be transparent and fair since FX fixing is extensively \nused as a reference rate,\ninvestor can obtain the best rates available to execute FX and FX hedging transactions (good \nprice transparency through well-distributed market transaction information), and\n\n \u2022 NDF/offshore markets are liquid and integrated with liquid onshore markets so that hedges \nput in place through forwards have the minimum basis risk relative to the transacted exit FX \nrate.\n\nHedging can be done either offshore through an NDF or deliverable offshore forwards (when allowed), or \nonshore, with due consideration of the relevant regulations.\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\n3.1  Offshore Hedging Markets\n\n3.1.1  Non-Deliverable Forward/Offshore Forwards Markets\n\nThe  currencies  of  the  KIMPT  economies  are  not  fully  convertible  because  the  respective  regulatory \nauthorities have set rules that limit the free exchange of each of these currencies. The rules are generally \nmeant to limit cyclical speculation and not to discourage bona fide portfolio investment, foreign direct \ninvestment, and normal trade flows. \n\nIn practice, however, the rules restrict FX transactions and make it more difficult for investors to access \nthe onshore FX and FX hedging markets. As a result, offshore FX markets that are beyond the direct reach \nof the regulators have developed. These are NDF markets for currencies that restrict delivery to onshore \nbanks such as Indonesia, and deliverable offshore markets as is the case for Thai baht.\n\nIn general, the NDF/offshore markets of KIMPT economies are considered relatively liquid, with 20\u201330 \nbanks quoting competitive prices. They are viewed as more user-friendly than onshore markets for the \nfollowing reasons:   \n\n \u2022 Onshore  hedging  often  requires  documentary  proof  of  the  underlying  investment;  NDF/\n\noffshore markets do not. \n\n \u2022 Onshore transactions can be operationally complex to book because of the need to provide \nrequired  documentation  and  comply  with  other  regulations.  NDF/offshore  transactions \nare extremely simple administratively and will generally be preferred except when there is a \nsignificant cost difference.   \n\n \u2022 Onshore rules often restrict the hedge (e.g., it must match the underlying investment exactly \n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nand cannot be rolled over); NDF/offshore markets do not.\nBecause NDF/offshore markets are relatively liquid, often with 20\u201330 banks quoting prices, \nprice transparency is good. Particularly in times of stress, onshore pricing is not always clear.\nInvestors  may  not  be  granted  internal  approval  for  their  required  credit  lines  for  FX  with \nonshore counterparties, but will generally be able to execute NDF/offshore transactions with \ntheir main international bankers offshore.\nInvestors may not be granted credit lines by onshore counterparties, but will be granted credit \nby their regular offshore banks. These global FX lines may be collateralized by the assets of the \nfund.\n\n \u2022 Onshore laws govern onshore transactions. Not all onshore markets benefit from clean legal \nopinions on the enforceability of hedging transactions. Investors may not have the required \ninternal approval to contract in a particular jurisdiction. NDF/offshore agreements are typically \nstandard global agreements under the laws of either the United Kingdom or the US.\nFor markets that do not benefit from clean International Swap and Derivatives Association \n(ISDA) opinions, the netting of onshore derivative transactions may not always be possible. \nThis makes them less attractive.\n\n \u2022\n\n10\n\n\fGeneral Comments on Foreign Exchange and Foreign Exchange Hedging\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nRegulators have been known to change the rules onshore with a negative impact on cross-\nborder transactions. NDF/offshore transactions are not subject to this regulatory risk.\nFor  investors  with  a  base  currency  other  than  US  dollars,  NDF/offshore  cross-currency \ncontracts will generally be available while onshore cross-currency forwards may not be.\n\n \u2022 Messages in NDF/offshore markets\u2014confirmation, matching, payment, and settlement\u2014are \nformatted, which allows straight-through-processing. In onshore markets, not all parties use \nthe full suite of formatted messages, which results in more manual processing and a higher \nerror rate.\n\nTherefore, the bulk of hedging transactions for emerging market and global crossover funds for partially \nconvertible currencies are done through short-term NDFs. Typically, these will be 1 (the most active), 3, 6, \nor 12 months, and rolled over for as long as the hedge is needed. \n\nOnce  an  NDF  or  offshore  forward  market  has  been  established,  it  is  very  difficult  (and  generally  not \ndesirable)  for  the  authorities  to  close  it  because  of  all  the  aforementioned  advantages  it  provides  to \ninvestors.  In  fact,  as  we  will  argue,  increasing  offshore  market  liquidity  will  enhance  onshore  market \nliquidity if they are well linked.\n\nHowever,  in  times  of  stress  there  can  be  a  mismatch  in  the  local  currency  supply\u2013demand  balance  in \noffshore markets. When this is coupled with a restricted onshore market and a prohibition on delivery \nof offshore contracts, it can lead to distorted NDF prices. For example, at times in 2013, the Indonesian \nrupiah NDF had an implied negative interest rate. As a result, the FX hedge may not track the realized exit \nFX rate, leading to basis risk. \n\nThe choice of tenor of the hedge (e.g., 1, 3, or 6 months, or 1 year or more) and decisions on the number \nof rollovers are influenced by (i) how long the bond itself is expected to be held, (ii)\u00a0how long the hedge \nis  expected  to  stay  in  place  and  if  it  will  need  to  be  adjusted,  (iii)  the  administrative  complexity  and \ncost of rollover such as the bid\u2013offered spread and transaction costs, and (iv) the investor\u2019s view of the \nrollover\u00a0risk.  \n\nThe  purchase  of  a  bond  must  generally  be  made  with  an  onshore  local  currency  that  needs  to  be \ndelivered onshore to the custodians for settlement of the purchase. Similarly, when the bond is sold, the \nlocal currency is delivered by the buyer to the investor\u2019s local custodian onshore and must be converted \ninto  US  dollars  for  repatriation.  For  some  currencies\u2014including  the  Indonesian  rupiah,  Korean  won, \nPhilippine peso, and Thai baht\u2014such contracts can only be executed onshore. In the future, NDFs and \nnon-deliverable swaps will need to be centrally cleared. It is not yet clear how this will affect markets, but \nit may reduce liquidity.\n\n3.1.2  Offshore Foreign Exchange Swap Markets\n\nAlthough banks can offer investors the full range of hedging products, as discussed above, the preferred \ninstruments  for  short-term  hedging  of  partially  convertible  currencies  offshore  are  the  NDF  and  the \noffshore deliverable forward. \n\n11\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\nHedging is done on a portfolio basis rather than bond by bond. The investor typically hedges the market \nvalue of the portfolio, which will change with movements in domestic interest rates. This can be easily \ndone through a forward. Changes to the hedge are easy to execute. Forwards are available for tailor-made \ntenors that extend well beyond 1 year.\n\nFor hedges beyond 12 months, investors may continue to use an NDF. Alternatively, they can use offshore \nswaps, but without the exchange of principal (non-deliverable swaps). This uses fewer credit lines and less \ncapital, and is therefore more cost-effective. The lack of exchange of principal means there is no exposure \nto onshore regulations that might affect the delivery of the local currency principal.  \n\nA  standard  cross-currency  swap  is  generally  not  suitable,  as  the  quarterly  or  semi-annual  exchange  of \nperiodic payments will result in the hedging of the interest rate exposure and the FX risk, and therefore \nis equivalent to exiting a bond position. Unless an investor needs to do this for a short period, selling the \nbond would generally be easier. Swap markets are also less liquid than forward markets, and less flexible. \nMatching the periodic payments to the cash flow of the bond portfolio may be difficult.\n\nSome investors use swaps as a substitute for a bond investment, going long in the domestic currency and \nthereby taking on both FX and interest rate exposure. This might be an easy and quick way into a new \nmarket. However, due to the increased cost of swaps resulting from Basel\u00a0II and III, the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the US, and other postglobal financial crisis regulations, \nlong-term swaps are much more expensive than in the past, and therefore less attractive. Spreads above \nreference rates will be larger. For this reason, swaps beyond 1 year are not frequent, and swaps beyond \n3\u00a0years are rare.\n\nFor issuers, swaps are used to hedge their currency exposure. For example, a company in the Republic of \nKorea might issue a US dollar-denominated bond and swap the future cash flows into Korean won to have \nresulting won liabilities that cash flows from their Korean operations can service.\n\n3.1.3  Offshore Foreign Exchange Options\n\nTo guard against low-probability but high-impact changes in FX rates, rather than hedge through NDFs \nand lose potential FX gains, some investors will buy protection (hedge) via out-of-the-money (therefore \ncheap) FX options. The market for these options is typically offshore and does not involve delivery of the \nlocal currency. The amount of activity in this market is quite low relative to total cross-border investments.\n\n3.2  Onshore Hedging Markets\n\nIn Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand, the delivery of the spot FX (needed \nwhen buying or selling the bond) is limited by regulation to onshore banks. As such, using an onshore \nhedge will avoid the basis risk resulting from divergence between the NDF and the onshore market. \n\n12\n\n\fGeneral Comments on Foreign Exchange and Foreign Exchange Hedging\n\nThe  real  demand  principle  regulations  in  the  KIMPT  economies  are  designed  to  limit  access  to  the \nonshore  forward  hedging  markets  by  only  allowing  certain  FX  transactions  to  be  executed  under \ncertain circumstances. FX hedges by long-term bond investors are generally welcome, but they must \nproduce  evidence  that  the  local  currency  purchases  and  sales  are  directly  related  to  the  underlying \nbond\u00a0investment. \n\nThe rules are different for each of the five KIMPT economies. These rules are intrinsically coherent and \ninterlocking, but are not always easy to understand from afar. Although the larger foreign bond investors \ncurrently active in these economies are now familiar with the rules, new investors will need Asia-based \nassistance to make sure they fully understand their options. This assistance is not always forthcoming. The \nrules also add to the administrative complexity and cost, and tend to discourage some new investors, in \nparticular a large number of smaller investors.  \n\nGenerally,  funds  will  hedge  onshore  only  if  they  are  required  by  their  mandate  or  when  the  price  is \nsignificantly more favorable onshore and they can meet the regulatory requirements. \n\n3.2.1  Legal Issues Affecting Onshore Swaps and Other Derivatives\n\nIn an active market, many transactions will be executed between participants who are sometimes buying \nand  sometimes  selling  FX.  It  is  useful  to  be  able  to  net  the  transactions  and  their  risk  exposures,  and \nprovisions to this effect are included in international transaction documentation.\n\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, closeout-netting provisions allow the offsetting of derivative positions (e.g., \nswaps  or  forwards)  to  be  netted  off  against  each  other,  with  one  final  payment  being  made.  The  less \ndesirable alternative is for the transactions to be dealt with on a gross basis whereby each transaction \nis subject to the discretion of the bankruptcy judge. Netting is the most important risk reduction tool in \nmodern financial markets. Collateral is widely used as a risk management tool in FX hedging contracts and \ntheir treatment in bankruptcy is also important. \n\nCloseout-netting provisions and the ability to rapidly liquidate collateral are even more important in the \nBasel III environment as the absence of suitable treatment will affect banks\u2019 capital requirements for the \ntransactions. In some economies, the bankruptcy courts do not immediately recognize the concept of \ncloseout netting and do not allow immediate access to collateral. \n\nIf  the  transactions  can  be  netted  and  the  legal  opinions  received  state  that  the  netting  provisions  are \nenforceable, then the capital required to satisfy Basel requirements is only that required for a net position. \nIf  the  provisions  cannot  be  enforced,  then  the  capital  required  is  that  of  the  gross  aggregate  of  all  the \ntransactions. The domestic laws that affect netting and collateral are therefore important for onshore and \ncross-border hedging transactions. For a derivatives market to work well and be liquid, it is important that \nan appropriate legal framework is in place to ensure suitable treatment in bankruptcy.  \n\nThe legal framework is assessed by ISDA as either clean, fairly clean, or unclean. A clean legal opinion \nindicates  that  legal  enforceability  is  in  place  and  Basel  capital  relief  can  be  achieved.  A  fairly  clean \n\n13\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\nlegal opinion  means that there  remain some legal question marks with regard to enforceability. This is \ncomplicated  and  could  depend  upon  factors  such  as  type  of  counterparty,  resolution  powers,  and \nstructure of the judiciary. Basel relief might be achieved for some transactions and counterparties, but \nnot others, though generally fairly clean is considered unsatisfactory. Unclean suggests there is a lack of \nnetting certainty and exposures are generally treated on a gross basis.\n\nTable  1  summarizes  the  status  of  ISDA\u2019s  review,  as  of  June  2015,  of  the  treatment  of  closeout  netting \nand  collateral  in  bankruptcy.  ISDA  opinions  are  accepted  as  \u201cwritten  and  reasoned  legal  opinions\u201d  for \nBasel regulatory purposes.2 As evident, these treatments are less than totally satisfactory in the five focus \neconomies.  Hence,  for  risk  reduction  reasons,  investors  will  hedge  offshore  through  an  NDF  or  other \noffshore transactions, or if onshore through their onshore custodian bank (usually an international bank \nthey use globally) and will rely on the global relationship to smooth out the consequences of any\u00a0dispute.\n\nTable 1: International Swaps and Derivatives Association\u2019s Assessment  \nof Legal Framework by Economy\n\nEconomy\n\nIndonesia\nRepublic of Korea\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nThailand\nAustralia and New Zealand\nHong Kong, China\nJapan\nSingapore\nMexico\nCanada\nChile\n\nNetting\n\nFairy clean\nFairly clean\nFairly clean\nFairly clean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\n\nCollateral\n\nUnclean\nUnclean\nUnclean\nClean\nUnclean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\nClean\n\nNotes:\n1.

In cases where the \nfairly  clean  opinions  are  sufficiently  close  to  clean,  and  when  they  are  confident  that  the  judiciary  will \nfollow international precedents, they will be willing to be active onshore with contracts under local laws. \nNevertheless, there is still great value in pushing to get clean status for domestic markets.\n\n15\n\n\fReview of Measures  \nto Facilitate Foreign Exchange \nRisk Management for Bond \nInvestments\n\n4\nUnder  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI),  a  Group  of  Experts  has  done  extensive  work \n\nto  identify  barriers  to  cross-border  investments  and  made  recommendations.  This  good  work \nshould\u00a0continue.\n\nIn the five focus economies, control measures have been put in place that affect the liquidity of the FX, \nFX hedging markets, and local currency debt capital markets. While any one of these measures may be \ndeemed  to  be  relatively  harmless,  the  cumulative  impact  of  several  can  be  significant,  narrowing  the \noverseas investor base and adding to the risk or the cost of bond purchases. \n\nDomestic issuers ultimately pay the cost of these measures. They will need to offer investors a higher \nyield to offset the increased cost and/or risk, and also pay an illiquidity premium in order to attract more \ninvestors.  Put  another  way,  by  reviewing  any  unnecessary  impediments  so  they  are  less  costly,  while \nmaintaining the desired level of exchange control, the authorities in the focus economies can improve the \nliquidity of their markets, lower borrowing costs, and accelerate the development of their bond markets. \nAlso, as the reference government yield curve will be lowered, bonds issued by other domestic borrowers \nwill be at lower yields.\n\nTo  make  markets  more  resilient  to  shocks  and  reduce  the  impact  of  cyclical  investors,  it  is  useful  to \nbroaden the investor base to attract more structural investors. Making access to the FX and bond markets \neasier, especially for smaller investors, and making these markets more liquid is the best means to achieve \nthese objectives.\n\nThe review below identifies a number of the impediments and makes recommendations on how they \ncan be adjusted, while keeping in mind the need to control capital flows. Ideally, rules should be stable, \ntransparent, and changed only when making the market more liberal.   \n\nThe best approach might be to set up several focused working groups in each economy made up of local \nregulators  (e.g.,  ministry  of  finance,  central  bank,  and  financial  markets  regulator  as  appropriate)  and \nactive  market  participants  (e.g.,  sell-side;  buy-side;  and  custodians,  both  domestic  and  international). \n\n\fReview of Measures to Facilitate FX Risk Management for Bond Investments\n\nEach  working  group  could  be  focused  on  one  problem  area  and  review  the  relevant  rules  and  make \nrecommendations  to  adjust  them.  (In  some  of  the  KIMPT  economies  this  is  already  happening.)  This \nwould supplement the work being done under ABMI.\n\n4.1 \n\n Measures to Facilitate Foreign Investor \nTransactions in the Foreign Exchange  \nand Foreign Exchange Hedging Markets\n\nRecommendation 1: Consider reviewing the rules on cash balances and overdrafts\n\n \u2022 Determine if the rules for bona fide investors could be simplified. \n \u2022\n\nReview the penalties for bona fide excess balances or overdrafts to determine if they could be \nmade less draconian. \nPrior approval may not need to be sought for bona fide fails, rather just the reporting of fails ex \npost facto. \n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022 When absent, reasonable de minimis limits could be established to reduce monitoring costs.\n \u2022\n\nExisting  limits  could  be  reviewed  and  revised  upward.  The  KIMPT  markets  have  grown \nsignificantly  since  they  were  established.  Special  limits  could  be  established  for  certain \naccounts  (e.g.,  international  central  securities  depositories  [ICSDs],  global  custodians,  large \nasset managers) that reflect their underlying business. \n\nNonresident  accounts  are  subject  to  rules  that  limit  cash  balances  and/or  overdrafts  and  borrowings. \nThe purpose of these rules is to ensure that offshore speculators do not take speculative positions by \nkeeping large positive balances when they expect a currency to appreciate, or tap overdraft and other \ncredit facilities when they expect the local currency to depreciate. It is clear that any capital control regime \nneeds to prevent such speculative positions. \n\nHowever,  when  trading  is  frequent  there  can  be  failures  to  deliver  US  dollars,  the  local  currency,  or \nthe  security.  These  failures\u2014colloquially  referred  to  as  fails\u2014are  generally  the  result  of  operational  or \ncommunications mistakes, often because the delivery is at the end of a long chain of transactions and \nbecause the chain includes various cut-off times. In many cases, the fail is corrected in the following days. \nThese fails can be for bona fide reasons that have no speculative element; if all the agreed transactions \nhad been executed on time, there would have been no overdraft and no excess balance.\n\nThe  limits  on  cash  balances  and  overdrafts  require  investors  to  manage  their  accounts  carefully,  usually \nthrough one of the following solutions. The challenge or downside of each solution is included in parentheses:\n\n \u2022 When allowed, they will prefund the local currency account to ensure there is no overdraft. \n\n \u2022\n\n(They will lose 1 day\u2019s interest.)\nThey will only buy or sell the local currency when they know the sale or purchase of the bond \nis firm. (This requires careful monitoring and coordination.) \n\n17\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nThey  will  buy  the  local  currency  from  their  custodian  bank.  The  advantage  of  this  is  the \ncustodian will be able to ensure delivery of the local currency on time, as opposed to waiting \nfor a third-party FX bank. This will require the custodian to provide them with intraday, and \nsometimes overnight, US dollar credit facilities so that they can deliver the local currency even \nif the US dollars have not yet been received. (This is usually compensated through higher fees \nor poor FX rates as the custodians are in a monopoly situation.)  \nThey have an automatic sweep that converts an excess balance into US dollars at the end of \nthe day and then converts back into the local currency in question at the opening of the next \nday. (This imposes costs through additional transactions.) \n\n \u2022 A team of people monitor and manage the current accounts. (This entails additional staffing costs.)\n \u2022 We  understand  that  regulators  can  often  exercise  discretion  and,  when  forewarned  of  a \npotential  violation  of  the  rules,  will  give  transaction-by-transaction  prior  approval.  (This \nrequires Asian-based staff and costs money. Some investors, for policy reasons, will not want \nto risk that approval may not be forthcoming. Smaller investors find the approval process too \ncomplex and therefore a disincentive to investment.) \n\nThese solutions all cost money and are not always available to smaller institutional investors, who do not \nbenefit from the handholding provided to larger investors by global intermediaries with Asian capabilities. \nTherefore,  they  may  be  discouraged  from  investing  in  bonds.  Yet,  these  smaller  investors  collectively \ninvest large amounts and are very useful for market development and stability.\n\nRules in some economies could usefully be reviewed to determine whether they could be made more \nuser-friendly. In Thailand, for example, there is still a B300 million limit for cash balances in the Thai baht \nnonresident account; end-of-day balances in excess are charged a penalty of 1%. In Indonesia, these rules \nhave  been  eliminated,  except  for  balances  resulting  from  the  sale  of  Sertifikat  Bank  Indonesia.  In  the \nPhilippines, the Bangko Sentral Registration Document system used to track currency inflows to permit \nrepatriation is cumbersome, confusing, and costly.\n\nRecommendation 2: Consider reviewing the rules that limit access to the onshore hedging market\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nRules  that  restrict  onshore  hedging  impact  liquidity  and  reduce  the  flexibility  of  investors. \nOffshore investors can find it difficult to understand exactly how to comply with the rules and \nmay not have adequate information from their service providers (e.g., custodians in Thailand) \nto help them comply.  This effectively closes the derivatives market to them.\nThe rules could be reviewed with inputs from market participants. The litmus test should be \nthe bona fide nature of the hedge.\nInvestors  could  be  required  to  self-declare  the  link  between  the  bond  and  the  hedge  that \nwould be subject to audit, as is the case in Mexico, rather than provide evidence each time. \nIt would help international investors if the rules were clearly written in English and consistently \nand  transparently  enforced.  Discretionary  approvals  by  central  banks  could  be  limited  to \nunusual cases and service providers could be encouraged to more proactively assist smaller, \nnew-to-market investors in meeting the regulatory requirements for hedging.\nSome elements of Recommendation 1 could also be considered for these rules.\n\n18\n\n\fReview of Measures to Facilitate FX Risk Management for Bond Investments\n\nThere are many examples of restrictions on onshore hedging that impact liquidity and reduce the flexibility \nof investors:\n\n \u2022 A bond that has been hedged cannot be sold while the hedge is in place; the rules often state \n\n \u2022\n\nthat the notional value of the hedge cannot exceed the value of the bond.\nThe documentation required to link a hedge to the underlying investment is cumbersome and \nonerous.\n\n \u2022 Hedging on a portfolio basis is not always allowed; the hedge and the underlying investment \n\nneed to be settled on a gross payment basis\u2014netting the transactions is not allowed. \n\n \u2022 Hedges cannot always be freely rolled over. \n\nIn  Indonesia,  for  example,  although  hedging  can  be  done  on  a  portfolio  basis,  the  rules  on  how  such \nhedges can be adjusted if a part of the portfolio is sold are not clear. As a result, portfolio hedging is in \npractice done only with the custodian bank where the bonds are held, which is far from ideal.\n\nThe  reporting  obligations  associated  with  these  rules  can  be  quite  onerous.  Some  flexibility  would  be \nhelpful.\n\nRecommendation 3: Consider reviewing the flow of transaction information  \n\nIt  is  important  that  all  investors  have  access  to  timely  and  appropriate  information  on  market  activity. \nThis should include the current bids and offers, and the intraday summary of activity including prices and \nvolumes (when appropriate). This information should also be available to offshore parties.  \n\nIn  some  markets,  chat  rooms  or  their  equivalent  are  still  being  used  by  traders.  Chat  rooms  result  in \nrestricting the flow of information. We recommend actively discouraging their use.\n\nRecommendation 4: Consider reviewing the rules that limit domestic banks\u2019 activity in domestic and \noffshore FX markets \n\nWe  recommend  reviewing  restrictions  on  domestic  banks  that  limit  their  activity  in  the  onshore  and \noffshore FX markets to determine their impact. It may be that the underlying prudential objectives can be \nmet through other means that have less impact on market liquidity. \n\nA number of restrictions on domestic banks in the KIMPT economies limit liquidity\u2014thereby creating \nliquidity silos\u2014and hinder integration of onshore and offshore markets. For example, in Indonesia, the \nRepublic of Korea, and Malaysia, local banks have limits on their involvement in the offshore NDF markets. \nIn Thailand, banks are not allowed to deal in NDFs in Thai baht with nonresidents. The Republic of Korea \nhas net open position limits imposed on resident banks. In Indonesia, the net open position limits rules \nwere changed so that they now have to be respected only at the close of business.\n\n19\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\nRecommendation 5: Explore the possibility of ensuring the availability of US dollars on exit  \n\nWe recommend enabling the central bank to take steps to reassure bona fide investors that US dollars will \nalways be available even in times of crisis.\n\nBeing able to repatriate the invested funds at a fair price is not always achievable. When regulations are \ntight and market liquidity has shrunk, it can be difficult for an investor to sell the local currency proceeds \nof a bond sale at a reasonable price. For example, in September\u2013October 2013, it was at times difficult to \nfind US dollars in the onshore Indonesian market.\n\nRecommendation 6: Consider allowing offshore FX contracts to be delivered onshore\n\nIf  offshore  contracts  were  deliverable  onshore\u2014within  certain  rules,  as  they  are  in  Malaysia  and \nThailand\u2014then  the  offshore  and  the  onshore  FX  markets  would  be  closer  to  integration.  As  we  view \ncloser ties between the onshore and offshore markets as desirable, we recommend that this possibility \nbe considered.\n\n4.2   Measures to Improve Liquidity of the Onshore \n\nForeign Exchange Derivatives Market\n\nRecommendation 7: Consider reviewing domestic laws so as to determine the steps required to benefit \nfrom a clean ISDA legal opinion  \n\nWe recommend a review, possibly with input from global banks and/or ISDA, of the gap between current \nand required legislation. Based on the review, consider taking the steps required to close that gap.\n\nWhile  this  is  a  long-term  initiative,  it  is  an  important  one.  A  liquid  derivatives  market  is  an  important \ncomponent  of  an  economy\u2019s  financial  infrastructure.  But  without  appropriate  netting  and  collateral \nlegislation,  it  will  be  difficult  to  establish.  As  the  resolution  will  require  input  from  various  branches  of \ngovernment, it will require high-level support and persistence. The target is a clean ISDA opinion (or its \nequivalent) in each economy. \n\nAs  discussed  in  Section  3.2.1,  the  domestic  legal  framework  does  not  fully  support  creditor  rights  in \nderivatives transactions. The resulting legal uncertainty limits the involvement of some foreign participants \nin onshore derivatives markets, forces some investors to use the NDF/offshore market, increases risks for \ndomestic participants, and increases systemic risk.\n\nRecommendation 8: Consider continuously reviewing the FX fixing process  \n\nIt is important that onshore FX and interest rate fixings are predictable and transparent with well-defined \nand disciplined processes. \n\n20\n\n\fReview of Measures to Facilitate FX Risk Management for Bond Investments\n\nThe process for onshore FX spot fixing has not always been transparent in the KIMPT economies. In some \nmarkets, interference by authorities or undue influence by key market players has affected the credibility \nof the onshore FX fixings. Fixings are an important component of markets.\n\n4.3   Measures to Increase Cross-Border Access \nto Government Bond Markets and Improve \nLiquidity\n\nWe consider it important to take all necessary steps to improve the liquidity of local currency government \nbond markets and increase the access of foreign investors to these markets.  \n\nBarriers to cross-border investments in local currency government bonds limit market liquidity, resulting \nin poor onshore and offshore FX and interest rate swap markets.\n\nThe measures required to develop domestic capital markets will also make the onshore FX markets more \nliquid and transparent, leading to better NDF/offshore markets. \n\nThe ABMI Group of Experts touched on many of these issues in a 2010 report.3 In addition, in May\u00a02013, \nADB  published  a  report  recommending  measures  that  would  help  broaden  the  investor  base  in  local \ncurrency bond markets.4\n\nThe  key  to  attracting  the  widest  range  of  long-term,  real-money  investors\u2014and  therefore  the  most \nstable\u2014into  government  bond  markets  is  to  make  investing  in  them  easy.  It  also  must  be  easy  to  sell \ngovernment  bonds.  Improving  secondary  market  liquidity  for  government  bond  markets  is  therefore \ncritically important.\n\nIn addition to the above recommendations, the important recommendations listed below generally apply \nto improve the FX and FX hedging markets.\n\nRecommendation 9: Continue to implement the recommendations included in Part III of the ABMI \nGroup of Experts report (2010) and ADB\u2019s report on broadening the investor base in local currency \nbond markets (2013).\n\n3  ADB.

The tax has a negative impact on government \nfinances as the higher cost of debt is not offset by the tax income. \nSome investors find it difficult to use double taxation agreements. They are not often set up in \na suitable jurisdiction, and their beneficial owners are changing frequently. Unit trusts typically \ncannot use these agreements as they are not incorporated, and pension funds often cannot \nbecause many are not taxpayers.\nSome investors will not buy bonds subject to withholding tax.\nTax reporting and withholding obligations can prevent the function of links to ICSDs, and their \nequivalent, excluding a wide range of investors.\nIn  the  case  of  the  Philippines,  use  of  the  double  taxation  treaty  is  so  complex,  it  poses  an \nalmost insurmountable barrier for some overseas investors. \n\n \u2022 We  understand  that  the  Republic  of  Korea  reinstated  the  withholding  tax  in  2011  largely  to \n\n(successfully) discourage cross-border investments.\n\nRecommendation 11: Consider reviewing the barriers that inhibit foreign investment in bonds to be \nheld at ICSDs and their equivalent\n\nABMI  has  discussed  alternative  solutions  to  using  the  current  ICSDs,  including  the  creation  of  an \nAsian equivalent and links between central banks and local central securities depositories (CSDs). We \nrecommend that these efforts continue to be pursued. \n\nWe note that a number of ASEAN+3 economies have already established links with ICSDs. As interim \nmeasures,  they  provide  real  value  to  these  economies.  In  some  cases,  there  remain  impediments  that \nrestrict their use. We recommend that these restrictions be reviewed. The ICSDs and their equivalent \nmaintain their accounts onshore with the local CSD as omnibus accounts; the investors\u2019 accounts are \nsubaccounts. The existence of the subaccounts does not impact capital control measures.\n\nThe  use  of  their  accounts  at  ICSDs  significantly  simplifies  the  payment  and  settlement  process  for \noverseas investors. This is particularly valuable for smaller investors. They are not required to understand \nand comply with the real need principle and other rules as they rely on the fact that the ICSDs do. They \ncontinue to give instructions to the ICSDs in the same electronic format that they do for other markets, \nand  they  receive  reports  back  in  the  same  format.  They  do  not  need  to  open  local  currency  onshore \naccounts.  Their  approval,  control,  and  audit  processes  are  simplified.  They  can  hedge  their  exposure \noffshore.\n\n22\n\n\fReview of Measures to Facilitate FX Risk Management for Bond Investments\n\nTable 2: Domestic Central Securities Depository (CSD) Links with International Central Securities \nDepositories (ICSDs) and Their Equivalent\n\nEconomy\n\nStatus of Links\n\nRemarks\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n\nLinked via Hong Kong, China\n\nHong Kong, China\nIndonesia\n\nJapan\nRepublic of Korea\n\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\nThailand\n\nEstablished for offshore renminbi \nbonds\nEstablished\nNot currently operational\n\nEstablished\nNot currently operational\n\nEstablished\nEstablished\n\nEstablished\nEstablished\n\nWorking well.\nThere is a tax issue. Currency \ncontrols may be an impediment.\nWorking well.\nLinks worked in 2010; their re-\nestablishment should be reviewed. \nTax and account structure are \ncurrent issues that prevent their use.\nWorking reasonably well. \nTax issues and perception of \ndocumentation problems limit their \nuse.\nWorking well.\nCash balance limits have inhibited \ntheir use.\n\nSource: Author\u2019s compilation based on discussions with ICSDs.\n\nThe benefits to domestic markets should not be underestimated when links are combined with lowering \nbarriers to entry; the breadth of investors can be significantly widened. In addition, investors will find it \nmuch  easier  than  before  to  trade  with  domestic  banks  so  that  the  domestic  activity  onshore  will  also \nbroaden.  When  bonds  denominated  in  Russian  rubles  could  be  held  at  ICSDs,  domestic  turnover \ntripled,  government  borrowing  costs  were  reduced  as  yields  dropped  by  150  basis  points,  and  cross-\nborder investments grew significantly. The number of foreign institutional investors also increased very \nsignificantly, broadening the investor base. \n\nIn  Indonesia  and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  it  is  not  possible  for  offshore  investors  to  hold  their  bonds  at \nan  ICSD  or  its  equivalent  (Table  2).  We  recommend  that  taking  steps  to  set  up  these  links,  including \naddressing the tax issues, be considered. In the Philippines and Thailand, there remain some barriers that \nconstrain the use of the links. In Malaysia, the links work reasonably well, but streamlining the remaining \nreal demand principle rules may make them work better, which would be beneficial for all. We recommend \nconsidering the review and possible elimination of these remaining barriers detailed in Section 4.1.\n\nRecommendation 12: Consider introducing larger and deeper series\n\nGovernments should issue bonds that have series that are larger and therefore deeper and more liquid. \nTo\u00a0do this, governments should\n\n23\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN+3\n\n \u2022\n \u2022\n \u2022\n\nissue the same series for a longer period of time and in larger amounts;\nhave a program for retiring illiquid series; and\nconcentrate  all  sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt in one issuer rather than have different \nagencies issue their own bonds, which are not fungible with the more liquid sovereign debt.\n\nRecommendation 13: Continue to develop a repo market\n\nAuthorities  should  actively  seek  to  develop  the  government  bond  repo  market  with  the  objective  of \nhaving a liquid term repo market, with the delivery of bonds as opposed to \u201cpledge repos,\u201d so that traders \ncan short the bonds.\n\nRecommendation 14: Consider allowing cross-border repo transactions\n\nAs  an  interim  measure,  we  recommend  allowing  nonresident  investors  to  take  a  short  position  on  a \nnumber of bonds, provided the investor can show that the portfolio\u2019s overall net position is long. \n\nCurrently, nonresident investors are not allowed to take a short position in a bond or to engage in bond \nrepo transactions. The current regulations mean that foreign investors cannot reduce their bond exposure \nexcept by the outright sale of bonds they own. This, in some cases, also means they will be forced to sell \nthe local currency in order to comply with excess balance limits. It is important to note that bond repos are \ninterest rate trading transactions with no FX component.\n\nRecommendation 15: At the right time, consider establishing a primary dealer system\n\nIt is necessary to put in place a strong primary dealer system.\n\nRecommendation 16: Continue to develop the domestic institutional savings sector \n\nThis  recommendation  entails  developing  pension  funds,  insurance  companies,  and  mutual  funds,  and \nallowing them the flexibility to invest in other ASEAN+3 economies.\n\nRecommendation 17: Continue to upgrade the required information and communication technology \ninfrastructure\n\nWe recommend\n\n \u2022\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nensuring that the domestic CSDs are using SWIFT connectivity for multiple message types;\npushing key market participants to use SWIFT messaging for a broader range of message types \nto  accelerate  the  ability  for  transactions  to  be  handled  electronically  via  straight-through-\nprocessing, thereby reducing costs and errors; and\nautomating presettlement trade matching.\n\n24\n\n\fReview of Measures to Facilitate FX Risk Management for Bond Investments\n\nRecommendation 18: Consider using the Global Legal Entity Identifier\n\nThe  Global  Legal  Entity  Identifier  can  be  used  to  monitor  participants\u2019  activity  and \nimprove \ncommunications between regulators. We recommend considering making use of the Global Legal Entity \nIdentifier mandatory for local financial institutions. \n\nRecommendation 19: Consider measures to reduce the cost of onboarding new investors\n\nTo reduce onboarding costs, while maintaining global standards in antimoney laundering and know-your-\ncustomer, we recommend\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\nreviewing  the  extent  to  which  banks  and  custodians  can  rely  on  compliance  with  these \nstandards in other jurisdiction to lower ASEAN onboarding costs;  \nreviewing the possibility of an ASEAN+3 onboarding regime for the whole region, which would \nresult in needing only one review; and \nreducing  the  need  for  the  annual  submission  of  notarized  and  consularized  supporting \ndocuments.\n\n25\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we recommend the following:\n\nI. \n\nII. \n\nIII. \n\n Consider making it easier for foreign investors to transact FX and FX hedges. Consider reviewing \nthe real demand principle regulations that separate the NDF market from the onshore market \nwith  the  aim  of,  where  possible,  reducing  the  barriers  in  a  measured  and  suitably  sequenced \nprogram. The emphasis should be on making the rules simpler, clearer, and cheaper to comply \nwith, while continuing to protect the currency from the risk of substantial short-term speculation. \nConsider  reviewing  the  quality  of  information  received  by  offshore  investors  and  banks  on \ndomestic market activity. Consider ways to assure investors they can source US dollars when \nthey exit. Consider allowing offshore FX contracts to be deliverable onshore. \n\n Consider steps to make onshore FX derivatives markets more liquid and better integrated with \noffshore FX markets. Consider reviewing the domestic legal framework that affects derivatives \n(and  also  repos)  in  bankruptcy.  An  important  aim  would  be  to  ensure  suitable  treatment  of \ncloseout  netting  and  collateral  in  bankruptcy.  This  would  have  several  positive  outcomes  for \nbanks and, by extension, capital availability and market liquidity. It would enable banks to reduce \nthe capital needed to reserve against derivatives and repos in these markets from a gross basis \nto a net basis, improve the onshore liquidity of derivatives and repos, reduce systemic risks and \nhedging costs, and facilitate the development of infrastructure finance. This will generally be a \nlengthy process but, when completed, a key component of the financial market infrastructure \nwill be in place. It would also remove an important impediment to offshore investors hedging \nonshore. Consider reviewing the FX fixing process to ensure it is transparent and fair to all.\n\n At the same time, promote the further development of liquid local currency government bond \nmarkets and make it easier for foreign investors to access. Domestic market liquidity positively \nimpacts FX markets and facilitates hedging. Consider reviewing the application of withholding \ntax on income earned by foreign investors from government bonds. Also, facilitate the use of \nexisting  links  with  ICSDs  and  global  custodians  (and  their  equivalent)  so  that  settlement  of \ntrades  can  take  place  offshore  in  subaccounts;  set  up  new  links  if  required.  Consider  issuing \n\n\fConclusions\n\nlarger  and  deeper  series  of  government  bonds.  Continue  efforts  to  further  develop  the  repo \nmarket, primary dealer system, and domestic institutional investor base. Continue to invest in \nsystems and information and communication technology infrastructure to improve efficiency \nand reduce costs.\n\n27\n\n\fFacilitating Foreign Exchange Risk Management for Bond Investments in ASEAN\u0003+3\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working closely with the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN) and the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea\u2014collectively\nknown as ASEAN+3\u2014to foster the development of local currency bond markets and facilitate regional\nbond market integration under the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). ABMI was launched in 2002 to\nstrengthen the resilience of the region\u2019s financial system by developing local currency bond markets as an\nalternative source to foreign currency denominated short-term bank loans for long-term investment.\n\nBond investors typically have a long position in local currency bond markets. To manage their foreign\nexchange (FX) risk, they may want to hedge that exposure for a period of time. They also want to be sure\nthey can easily convert the local currency to dollars upon the sale of a bond. This study was undertaken\nunder ABMI and funded by the Government of Japan. It reviews the FX and FX hedging markets in\nASEAN+3 as they relate to cross-border investments in local currency bonds, and makes recommendations\nto facilitate the development of the markets and FX risk management.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people.
