Cornelli et al. \n \n1.  THE IMPORTANCE OF SME FINANCE IN ASIA1 \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  play  an  important  role  in  the  Asian \neconomy  (Table  1).  Although  estimates  vary,  several  sources  suggest  that  SMEs \naccount for over 95% of all firms, contribute to 50%\u201370% of employment, and constitute \n30%\u201360% of various countries\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP).2  \nDespite their importance to the economy, SMEs in Asia often have a difficult time \nobtaining external finance. A joint study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development and the Asian Development Bank found that SMEs in Asia trail global \npeers in access to financial services, specifically with respect to credit (OECD-ADB \n2014). In addition, they are roughly half as likely to apply for loans as global peers, and \nare also more likely to have relied on retained earnings over external financing for \ninvestment. \nOne reason for SMEs\u2019 reluctance to borrow may be due to stricter requirements from \nbanks; in Asia, SMEs are roughly 50% more likely to be required to provide collateral for \nloans. By contrast, in Europe, loans to SMEs are mainly in the form of credit lines that \nare  typically  uncollateralized.  Moreover,  most  countries  in  Europe  have  mutual \nguarantee  institutions,  which  are  non-profit  organizations  that  allow  small  firms  to \nimprove their borrowing capacity (see Columba et al. 2010 for the Italian case). Banks \nmay also be less willing to lend to SMEs in Asia as the risks and transaction costs are \nhigh relative to returns.  \nTable 1: SMEs in Asia are Highly Significant Contributors to the Economy \nSME Share of  SME Contribution \nJurisdiction  Employment (%)  to GDP (%)  Data Year \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  64.7  60.0  2011, 2013 \nHong Kong, China   47.0    2012 \nIndia   40.0  37.5  2015, 2013 \nIndonesia   97.0  60.3  2009, 2013 \nJapan   69.7  43.7  2012 \nRepublic of Korea   87.7  47.6  2012 \nMalaysia   65.0  35.9  2014 \nPhilippines   63.7  35.7  2013, 2009 \nSingapore   68.0  45.0  2012 \nTaipei,China   78.0  30.0  2011 \nThailand   80.3  39.6  2014 \nViet Nam   46.8  40.0  2012, 2011 \nGDP = gross domestic product, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \nSource: Asian Development Bank (2019). \n \n1  This paper draws on examples from specific firms. These are for illustrative purposes only. They are not \nexhaustive and do not imply any statement with regard to any firm, product, or service. \n2  According to the SME Finance Forum, SMEs comprise 98% of enterprises and employ 50% of the \nworkforce in Asia and the Pacific (Ata 2014). The Asian Development Bank estimates that SMEs account \nfor more than 96% of all Asian businesses and provide two-thirds of private sector jobs (ADB 2019). \nNotably, the definition of SMEs differs across countries. Most define them based on thresholds for \nemployment, capital, and revenue.   \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \n2.  FINTECH CREDIT AND SME FINANCING \nAgainst the backdrop of SMEs struggling to obtain conventional sources of financing, \nemerging financial technological innovations in Asia have changed traditional models \nsuch that they may help to bridge the funding gap. In recent years, fintech3 and big tech4 \nfirms have increasingly stepped in to provide funding to SMEs.  \nIn particular, fintech credit has expanded rapidly. According to data from the Cambridge \nCentre for Alternative Finance (CCAF),5 global debt-based alternative finance (fintech \ncredit)  volumes  grew  by  26%  in  2017,  from  $287  billion  in  2016  to  \n$373 billion in 2017. If big tech credit is added to that, then the growth was even more \nrapid (Figure 1), and the provision of total fintech credit stood at $543 billion globally in \n2017. Most of these volumes ($492 billion) are in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand elsewhere in Asia.  \nFigure 1: Global Volume of New Fintech and Big Tech Credit Has Grown  \nthrough 2017 \n \nLHS = left-hand scale, RHS = right-hand scale. \n1  Total fintech, defined as the sum of fintech and big tech credit divided by the sum of total fintech credit and total credit \nto the private non-financial sector. \n2  Average calculated for a selected set of countries. \nNote: Figures include estimates. \nSources: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and research partners; big tech companies\u2019 financial statements; \nFrost et al. (2019). \n   \n \n3  Fintech credit refers to credit through online (non-bank) platforms. This includes all credit activity facilitated \nby online platforms that are not operated by commercial banks (CGFS-FSB 2017; Claessens et al. 2018). \nDepending on the jurisdiction, these platforms can be referred to as peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders, loan-\nbased crowdfunders, or marketplace lenders.  \n4  A rapidly growing subset of fintech credit, which is generally not captured in standard data sources, is big \ntech credit, i.e., credit provided by large technology companies whose primary business is digital services, \nrather than financial services (Frost et al. 2019). \n5  As mentioned previously, data on big tech credit are scarce, and are not included in those from the \nCambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF). As such, volumes have been estimated based on \npublicly available data. Aggregate data on returns and net losses are generally not publicly available. \nMicrodata on losses are available to big tech firms themselves, and can be used for empirical analysis \n(Frost et al. 2019). \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \nAlthough still a small proportion of the total, fintech credit is becoming an economically \nrelevant source of finance to SMEs in certain countries around the world, including the \nPRC and other parts of the Asia and the broader Pacific region (FSB 2019b). While data \non  aggregate  SME  financing  volumes  are  not  available  for  the  PRC,  WDZJ.com \nestimates that fintech credit made up 13% of new lending to the private sector in the first \n5 months of 2018. In Australia, fintech credit volumes stood at over $1.0 billion in 2017, \nmostly in the form of business balance sheet lending, P2P funding, and invoice trading \n(CCAF 2018). In the Republic of Korea, India, and Japan, fintech credit stood at $652 \nmillion,  $220  million,  and  $190  million,  respectively,  most  of  which  was  to  small \nbusinesses (CCAF 2018).  \nFor both big tech and other fintech credit, the PRC remained by far the largest market in \n2017, with a volume of $163 billion and $321 billion, respectively (90% of the global \nvolume). In the Republic of Korea, big tech credit comprised $4.9 billion (mostly from \nKakao Bank and KBank), with other fintech credit being $653 million. While total fintech \ncredit was only 0.5% of outstanding credit at a global level in 2017, this was much higher \nin the PRC, at 3.0% (Figure 2).  \nFigure 2: Total Fintech Credit Varied by Jurisdiction in 2017 \n \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n1  Total fintech credit (including big tech credit) divided by the sum of total credit to the private non-financial sector.

Logarithmic scale.  \nSources: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance; research partners; big tech companies\u2019 financial statements; Frost et \nal. (2019). \nAs of 2018, there was evidence that fintech credit platforms are becoming economically \nrelevant in Indonesia, with Rp9.213 trillion ($650 million) in loans disbursed to 1.43 \nmillion borrowers as of July 2018 (KPMG 2018). Big tech players like Grab and Go-Jek \nalso have extensive lending in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia, including \nto car buyers. Recently, these firms have begun offering consumer credit for purchases \nin stores (Tani 2019).  \n2.1  Innovative Uses of Data in Credit Analysis \nFintech and big tech firms have a number of specific advantages compared to incumbent \nfinancial activities, including their access to data and networks (FSB 2019a; BIS 2019; \nStulz 2019); in some cases, this can allow them to adapt to the unique challenges and \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \nneeds of SMEs. Compared to banks, fintech and big tech firms have been better able to \nuse  alternative  sources  of  data  and  technology  to  supplement  traditional  credit \ninformation. This has helped SMEs previously disadvantaged by limited credit history \nand has the potential to address a key problem in many Asian countries that lack \ncomprehensive credit bureau coverage.  \nThe credit scoring approach of big tech firms may provide an advantage over incumbent \nbanks, where it is common to rely heavily on traditional information sources like audited \nfinancial statements, collateral, and loan officer judgment to approve or reject a potential \nborrower. The use of machine learning could aid the direct and rapid assessment of \ncredit  risk.  In  particular,  it  can  improve  underwriting,  draw  on  information  from \nrelationships between customers, and, in some cases, prevent human bias from entering \nthe decision. The greater data resources could open the possibility that big tech lenders \nlend  to  borrowers  who  were  previously  shut  out  of  the  formal  bank  \ncredit market. \nFigure 3: Credit Assessment for SMEs and Big Data Analytics \n \nSME= small and medium-sized enterprise. \n1 The loss rate is the volume of loans more than 30 days past due relative to the origination volume. In its use to date, the \ninternal rating of Mercado Libre is better able to predict such losses. It segments the originations into five different risk \ngroups versus the three clusters identified by the bank bureau. The size of the dots is proportional to the share of the firms \nin the rating distribution. \n2 True positive rates versus false positive rates for borrowers at different thresholds for a logistic model with (I) only the \ncredit bureau score, (II) a logistic model with the bureau score and borrowers\u2019 characteristics, and (III) a machine learning \nmodel with the Mercado Libre credit score. A random model is included for comparison purposes. The ROC curve shows \nthat the machine learning model has superior predictive power to both the credit bureau score only and the credit bureau \nscore with borrower characteristics. \nSource: Frost et al. (2019). \nAs an example from outside Asia, using data from Mercado Libre in Argentina, Frost  \net al. (2019) suggest that big tech firms\u2019 machine learning-based credit scoring applied \nto small vendors from a wide variety of platform data outperforms models based on credit \nbureau ratings and traditional borrower characteristics. As shown in Figure 3, Mercado \nLibre\u2019s internal ratings (A to E) can be compared with those of the credit bureau (low-risk \nto high-risk), which banks rely on, but augment with other borrower characteristics and \nsoft information (Figure 3, left-hand panel). For a given bureau rating (e.g., low-risk), the \nexpected loss rate is strictly in line with the internal rating, i.e., the patterns of the dots \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \nshow that the internal rating increases with expected loss. Conversely, for a given \ninternal  rating  (e.g., C,  D  or  E),  the  loss  rate  is  not  strictly  in  \nline with credit bureau risk. For example, the dot associated with internal rating D in  \nthe low-risk bureau category indicates a higher risk than the internal rating D in the \nmedium-risk  bureau  category.  Moreover,  the  internal  rating  has  a  broader  range, \ncovering losses from 0.0% to 10.2%; the bureau rating ranges from 0.7% to 2.8%.  \nMost importantly, by using the internal scoring model, Mercado Libre can provide credit \nto the profiles assessed as high-risk by the bureau. The size of the dots in the left-hand \npanel of Figure 3 is proportional to the share of the firms in the rating distribution;  \na substantial number of clients are in the credit bureau high-risk category. Because \nbanks use a mix of credit bureau information, hard information from financial statements, \nand soft information from loan officers, this segment may have much less access to \ntraditional banking services. With its more granular scoring model, Mercado Libre offers \n30% of its credit to this category. Further, the internal rating system based on machine \nlearning techniques and data obtained from the e-commerce platforms can outperform \nsimple models based on bureau score and borrower characteristics in predicting defaults \n(Figure 3, right-hand panel).  \nSimilar credit assessment models are used by fintech and big tech lenders in the Asia \nand the Pacific region, and there is evidence that these may enhance credit access; for \ninstance, Hau et al. (2018) find evidence that PRC fintech credit mitigates supply friction \nand  allows  firms  with  a  lower  credit  score  to  access  credit. 6  Fintech  credit  \nmay also serve firms that do not have access to collateral, such as new firms whose \nprimary assets are intangible intellectual property. While fintech credit may thus enhance \nfinancial  inclusion,  it  may  also  go  to  marginal  borrowers,  who  may  have  lower \ncreditworthiness.  \nWhile available evidence thus suggests that innovative uses of data can aid credit \nassessments and potentially enhance inclusion, there are questions as to whether this \nperformance is superior to bank models that also use soft information, and whether it \ncan be sustained over full business and financial cycles. In particular, many new credit \nassessment models rely on a relatively short time series of information, and have  \nnot yet been tested in a downturn (Claessens et al. 2018). Globally, policy makers \nrecognize the paradox of limited access to finance due to insufficient data on SMEs in \nan age when it is significantly more available, and note that technology is increasingly \nreconciling this paradox (Carney 2019). \n2.2  Trade Finance \nAnother  area  where  technology  can  play  a  notable  role  in  transforming  business \npractices is in trade finance. The growing importance of Asia in world trade emphasizes \nsmall businesses\u2019 need for expanded access to finance. SMEs contribute over 40% of \nexports in major economies like the PRC and India (Table 2). Asia is now responsible \nfor roughly one-third of global trade, trailing only Europe, while Asian firms account for \nroughly half of the world\u2019s supply chain exports, which involve trade in parts and \ncomponents (WTO 2016).  \n   \n \n6  Similarly, for consumer lending, Tang (2019) finds that fintech credit complements bank lending for small-\nscale loans in the US, and Jagtiani and Lemieux (2018) find that Lending Club has penetrated areas that \nare underserved by traditional banks. De Roure, Pelizzon, and Tasca (2016) find that fintech credit serves \na slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks in Germany. \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \nTable 2: Trade Finance to SMEs Has Particular Importance in Asia \nJurisdiction  SME Share of Exports (%)  Data Year \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  41.5  2011 \nIndia   42.4  2013 \nIndonesia   15.7  2013 \nRepublic of Korea  18.8  2012 \nSME = small and medium-sized enterprises. \nSource: Asian Development Bank (2019). \nDespite SMEs\u2019 existing participation in Asia\u2019s trade, their presence is restricted by access \nto finance. In an Asian Development Bank Survey, SMEs report limited funding as a \ncommon reason for refraining from trade in the global supply chain, with 60% saying that \nthey did not proceed with a trade because of lack of finance. Importantly, ADB estimates \nthat a 10% increase in trade finance is associated with a 1% increase in employment \n(ADB 2019).  \nIn trade finance, technology-driven changes to business models can expand access to \nfinancial  services  with  growth  potential  for  Asia\u2019s  SMEs  by  modernizing  inefficient \nprocesses  and  reducing  the  role  of  costly  intermediaries.  Similarly,  technological \ninnovations  have  the  potential  to  transform  invoice  financing  by  leveraging  the \ndigitalization of commerce to make accounts receivables more easily priced and traded.  \nThe complexity and paperwork-intensive nature of trade finance transactions has made \ndistributed ledger technologies (DLT) an attractive option in the Asia and the Pacific \nregion. DLT could help digitize and automate the trade supply chain and make checks \nmuch quicker, more efficient, and less costly. DLT could also improve processes via \nsmart  contracts,  which  operate  like  traditional  contracts,  but  can  be  executed \nautomatically without the need for intermediaries or paper-based processes. Using DLT \nto create single digital records for customs clearance could in principle help lower fees \nand reduce barriers to trade.  \nAccording to estimates by the World Economic Forum and Bain & Company, DLT could \nincrease new trade by $1 trillion globally (WEF and Bain 2018). In particular, the study \nshows that such use of DLT would reap material benefits in the Asia and the Pacific \nregion, which accounts for a large share of the global trade finance gap.7  \nThere have been several public and private sector initiatives that attempt to promote DLT \ntechnology in a way that would benefit SMEs. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the \nMonetary Authority of Singapore, and the People\u2019s Bank of China have actively promoted \nthe private sector using DLT to address trade finance issues (MAS 2017; King 2018). \nThese proposals aim to reduce the risk of fraud and duplicate financing; improve \noperational efficiency by allowing for verification of information by users rather than by a \nsingle trusted party; and increase the speed of transactions and reduce the need for \npaper  reconciliation  (FSB  2019c).  Moreover,  incumbent  banks  have  piloted  DLT \nsolutions to trade windows, for instance, for trade between New Zealand and the \nRepublic of Korea (ASB 2018). In Thailand, 22 banks have teamed up to form the \nBlockchain Community Initiative, whose goal is to reduce the time it takes to issue letters \nof guarantee (Lorenzo 2019). This consortium was established under the auspices of the \nBank of Thailand\u2019s regulatory sandbox. Eleven banks in India have also established a \n \n7  The World Economic Forum estimates that the global trade finance gap was around $1.5 trillion in 2017, \nof which close to 40% of this gap is attributed to the Asia and the Pacific region (WEF and Bain 2018).  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \nsimilar consortium that promotes blockchain for SME financing solutions (Manikandan \n2019). \nWhile using DLT in areas such as trade finance and letters of guarantee has the potential \nto significantly reduce processing times and overhead costs compared to conventional \nprocesses, the extent to which these advantages play out in practice has yet to be tested. \n2.3  Other Forms of Fintech Financing \nEquity crowdfunding and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are further potential sources of \nfinance to businesses, including to SMEs. Equity crowdfunding allows investors to take \nan equity stake in firms. This form of finance is especially widespread in the UK and, to \na lesser extent, the US and the PRC (Figure 4, left panel). ICOs, meanwhile, involve the \nsale of a crypto-asset (\u201ccoin\u201d) or a digital representation of value. There have been \nsignificant governance problems in this sector, including widespread dissemination of \nfraudulent information to investors in so-called \u201cwhitepapers\u201d. If these issues can be \naddressed, some authors posit the potential for ICOs to aid SME financing in the future \n(OECD 2019). ICOs raised $3.9 billion in the first 2 months of 2018, but only $285 million \nin the corresponding period in 2019 (Figure 4, right panel). \nMore generally, the use of mobile money from big tech has had a significant impact on \nfinancial  services  in  emerging  markets,  including  for  micro  SMEs.  Mobile  money \ntransactions now account for 7% of GDP in Asia, compared to close to 20% of GDP in \nsub-Saharan Africa and less than 2% of GDP in other regions (IMF 2019). While most \nuse cases are related to remittances, broader uses are increasingly common, including \nfor the payments for goods and services. In some cases, these operators also provide \nsavings, loan, and insurance products. \nFigure 4: Equity Crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offering Volumes \n \nAR = Argentina, AT = Austria, AU = Australia, BE = Belgium, BR = Brazil, CA = Canada, CL = Chile, DE = Germany,  \nES = Spain, FI = Finland, FR = France, GB = United Kingdom, ID = Indonesia, IN = India, IT = Italy, JP = Japan,  \nKR = Republic of Korea, LHS = left-hand scale, MY = Malaysia, NL = Netherlands, NO = Norway, NZ = New Zealand, \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, RHS = right-hand scale, SE = Sweden, SG = Singapore, US = United States. \n1 Top 25 countries. \n2 2017 data. \nSources: Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance; Coinschedule. \n \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G. Cornelli et al. \n \n3.  CONCLUSION \nSMEs play an important role in the Asian economy but generally have a difficult time \nobtaining external finance due to a number of factors on both the supply and demand \nside, including the lack of financial statements or insufficient documentation, higher \ndemand for collateral from Asian banks, and the limited presence of mutual guarantee \ninstitutions to mitigate asymmetric information problems. Fintech innovations in Asia \nhave changed traditional funding models, which may help bridge the funding gap. As \nshown in this paper, fintech finance has rapidly expanded in several Asian countries \nthrough online lending platforms, lending by big tech firms, and more recently, new forms \nof trade finance, equity crowdfunding, and ICOs. \nIn addition to new sources of funding, technology can also help improve access to credit \nfor  small  firms  in  Asia,  with  innovative  use  of  machine  learning  technologies  \nand data in credit analysis by fintech and big tech firms providing an advantage over \ntraditional banks. Central banks and governments in several countries are more actively \nintervening, often with the private sector, to promote new technologies to increase \nfunding opportunities for SMEs. These actions include grappling with the private and \npublic benefits and the rights related to information.  \nWhile several legal and regulatory challenges remain and the resilience of these new \nfunding models have not yet been tested in a downturn, new technologies have already \nstarted to transform SME financing.  \n   \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1027  G.
