INTRODUCTION \n\nSchneider \n\nState-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)\u2014refer  to  section  1  below  for  a  definition\u2014are \nimportant,  especially  in  an  Asian  context.  According  to  Fortune  Magazine\u2019s  (2018)  \n500 list, three out of the world\u2019s top-10 largest companies by revenues were Chinese \nSOEs:  State  Grid  (rank  2),  Sinopec  (rank  3),  and  China  National  Petroleum  (rank  4). \nDepending on the degree of direct and indirect government support, the next five ranks \ncontain  at  least  a  group  of  near-state  enterprises\u2014near-state  meaning  companies  in \nwhich  the  state  either  is  a  minor  shareholder  or  has  an  institutionalized  stake:  Royal \nDutch Shell, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, BP, and Exxon Mobil. This only leaves two of \nthe world\u2019s ten largest companies neither belonging to nor being backed by the state, \nWalmart (rank 1) and Berkshire Hathaway (rank 10). \n\nAdopting an even more restrictive understanding, SOEs\u2014companies of which the state \nis  the  majority  shareholder\u2014account  for  around  25%  of  the  Fortune  500  entries  by \nnumber of companies. Around 15% of them are in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \n5% are in other Asian countries, and 5% are in the rest of the world. Following the same \ncriterion,  in  the  list  for  the  year  2005,  SOEs  constituted  only  about  6%  of  \nthe total. \n\nSOEs not only seem to be important as an economic phenomenon; they also seem to \nbe  especially  relevant  to  economies  in  Asia.  Some  SOEs  are  not  only  economically \nimportant  but  also  play  other,  non-economic  roles,  like  attracting,  fomenting,  and \ndiffusing knowledge and education or securing the political interest of the state. In recent \nyears, successful SOEs have served as symbols of the (re-)emergence of many Asian \neconomies. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  there  are  concerns  about  SOEs\u2019  governance  structures.  The \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  published  its \nGuidelines  on  Corporate  Governance  of  State-Owned  Enterprises  as  early  as  2005, \nmost  recently  updating  them  in  2015  (OECD  2015).  In  a  2016  report,  the  same \norganization cautioned governments to strengthen their governance standards in SOEs \n(OECD 2016a). In 2017, the OECD again reminded governments that SOEs could lead \nto remarkable distortions and to unfair competition (OECD  2017). In 2018, the OECD \ncompared different practices on the governance of SOEs around the globe. It insisted on \nthe need to strengthen monitoring and reporting mechanisms (OECD 2018a). In another \nreport, it identified the independence of boards as success factors in the performance of \nSOEs (OECD 2018b), and, in yet another, it highlighted risk management as elemental \n(OECD 2016b). \n\nHowever,  not  only  international  organizations  but  also  state  agencies  are  paying \nattention to the governance structure of SOEs. An example of national evaluation\u2014in \nthe  \u201cEast\u201d  and  the  \u201cWest\u201d\u2014is  the  PRC\u2019s  State-owned  Assets  Supervision  and \nAdministration Commission (SASAC), which is advancing an agenda on the reform of \nSOEs to strengthen their governance, focusing especially on the independence of the \ninstitutions  and  their  board  members  as  well  as  on  the  economic  desiderata  that  the \nSOEs  must  fulfill  (SASAC  2018).  India  is  considering  restructuring  and  privatization \n(Khanna 2012; Mishra 2014). \n\nOn a regional level, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has published many reports on \nSOE  reform,  the  most  recent  being  its  thematic  evaluation  State-Owned  Enterprise \nEngagement and Reform (ADB 2018), in which it states that \u201cSOE reform is challenging, \nbut critical\u201d (xxii). This reform, according to the evaluation, should focus on government \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\noversight  and  the  political  independence  of  SOEs,  because  they  tend  to  improve  the \ngovernance and performance of those entities (xxv). \n\nThis  paper  is  interested  in  the  governance  of  SOEs.  With  insights  gained  from \ninstitutional  economics,  it  answers  the  following  question:  How  can  countries  reform \nSOEs  to  strengthen  their  governance?  Here,  this  paper  claims  that,  although  the \nguidelines  and  lessons  learned  that  the  above-mentioned  authors  have  identified  are \nnecessary for SOE reform, they are not sufficient. This paper asserts that, in a setting \nbased on new public management (NPM), the ownership strategy and independence are \nbuilding blocks for the good governance, and for the reform, of SOEs. \n\nAs important as this answer is, it comes with a limitation of scope. Why does the state \nset up a company under its control or of which it is the main shareholder? The answer is \neither  to  secure  strategic  sectors  or  operations  or  to  produce  goods  in  a  productive, \ninnovative, and customer-oriented way. While the first part of the last sentence follows a \npolitical  paradigm,  the  second  follows  an  institutional  paradigm,  in  this  case  NPM.  In \nanswering  the  question  about  how  to  govern  SOEs,  this  paper  limits  its  scope  to  the \nlatter, deliberately leaving questions about politics and political economy aside. In reality, \nhowever, the two paradigms come together. The last section of the main body of this text \nbriefly  addresses  this  limitation  of  scope.  Other  papers  deal  in  more  detail  with  the \ninteraction of politics and institutions regarding SOEs. \n\nThe remainder of this text proceeds as follows. After defining state-owned enterprises \nand new public management, the paper develops a framework for ownership strategy \nand independence. An examination of how the three factors\u2014new public management, \nstrategy, and independence\u2014enhance the governance of SOEs leads to its conclusion \n(reviewing its limitations) and to policy recommendations. \n\n2.  SETTING THE STAGE: SOES AND NPM \n\nThis  section  defines  SOEs  and  NPM,  thus  setting  the  stage  for  analyzing  them  as \neconomic  institutions.  Economic  institutions  are  well-established  arrangements  that  \nare part of the culture or society in which economic interaction takes place. Institutions \nare  the  \u201crules  of  the  game\u201d  when  describing  economic  interactions,  that  is,  social \nexchanges and the relevant \u201cgames.\u201d Institutions that become formal administrations are \ncalled  organizations.  In  this  sense,  the  state  and  SOEs  are  institutions-cum-\norganizations, while NPM, as a theory with normative implications, is an institution. \n\n2.1  State-Owned Enterprises \n\nGovernment  corporations,  government  business  enterprises,  government-linked \ncompanies, parastatals, public enterprises, public sector units, and enterprises are some \nof  the  names  for  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  The  name  and  the  definition  \nof  SOEs  vary  depending  on  factors  such  as:  the  level  of  government  that  owns  the \nenterprise  (central/federal,  state/regional,  or  local);  the  way  in  which  the  enterprise  \nwas founded; the position in the public administration hierarchy; the purpose of the SOE; \nthe status of the SOE (held by the state, held by a state-led or sponsored cooperative, \nor in the process of privatization); full, majority, or minority ownership of the government; \nlisting (or not) on a stock exchange; government shareholdings through vehicles such as \ngovernment  pension  funds,  asset  management  funds,  restructuring  corporations,  and \ndevelopment  lenders;  or  state-enabled  (for  example  enterprises  that  the  state  has \ngranted exclusive rights). ADB\u2019s report summarized \u201cthere is no common definition of \nSOE\u201d (ADB 2018, xii). \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nThis paper defines SOEs as enterprises of which the state has significant control through \nfull, majority, or significant minority ownership. This control can be direct or indirect, and \nthe company can operate at the central, federal, regional, or local level. This text also \nuses  the  terms  \u201cstate\u201d  and  \u201cgovernment\u201d  synonymously  to  describe  all  levels  and \nmanners of the formal organization of the political body. State refers, thus, to all branches \nof government, agencies, bodies, or official functions. \n\nThese varying names and forms of SOEs do not only occur at the conceptual level. On \nthe practical level, this differentiation provides governments with flexibility. They can set \nup SOEs according to their needs and the specifications of the markets in which they \noperate or adapt them to other constraints. On the other hand, these multiple forms may \ncomplicate  the  ownership  policy,  making  SOEs  less  transparent  and  eventually \ninsulating  them  from  the  legal  framework  applicable  to  other  companies,  including \ncompetition laws, bankruptcy provisions, or securities laws. These unintended negative \nconsequences  have  led  to  different  calls  for  reforming  SOEs,  as  the  introduction \ndescribed. Before delving into the reform as such, it is advantageous to survey briefly \nthe economic mechanism that makes SOEs attractive for governments and at the same \ntime problematic. \n\nThere are several rationales for setting up and running an SOE, constituting two groups. \nThe rationales that belong to the first group are: providing public goods (e.g., national \ndefense and public parks) and merit goods (e.g., public health and education), both of \nwhich benefit all the individuals within a society and for which collective payment through \ntax may be preferable to users paying individually; increasing access to public services, \nwhereby  the  state  could  enforce  SOEs  to  sell  certain  goods  and  services  at  reduced \nprices to targeted groups as a means of making certain services more affordable for the \npublic  good  through  cross-subsidization;  launching  new  and  emerging  industries  by \nchanneling  capital  into  SOEs  that  are,  or  can  become,  large  enough  to  achieve \neconomies of scale in sectors in which the start-up costs are otherwise significant; or \ngenerating  public  funds.  The  rationales  in  the  second  group  are:  improving  labor \nrelations,  particularly  in  \u201cstrategic\u201d  sectors;  limiting  private  and  foreign  control  in  the \ndomestic economy; encouraging economic development and industrialization; sustaining \nsectors  of  special  interest  for  the  economy,  particularly  to  preserve  employment;  or \ncontrolling the decline of sunset industries, with the state receiving ownership stakes as \npart of the enterprise restructuring. \n\nThe  rationales  belonging  to  the  first  group  are  typical  outcomes  of  NPM.  The  ones \nbelonging to the second group are political. Since this paper focuses on the first group, \na greater understanding of NPM becomes necessary. \n\n2.2  New Public Management \n\nMost OECD countries have introduced new public management (NPM) policies since the \n1980s. Policy makers and scholars have argued that NPM techniques will increase the \nefficiency in the state sector by introducing criteria from private sector management into \ntraditional methods of public administration (Christensen and L\u00e6greid 2016). NPM is an \napproach in public administration that employs the knowledge and experiences acquired \nin business management and other disciplines to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, \nand  general  performance  of  public  services  in  the  administration  of  the  state  and  its \nbureaucratic apparatus. \n\nNPM  encompasses  a  variety  of  concepts.  These  range  from  the  general  idea  of \n\u201cmodernization  of  the  public  sector\u201d  to  the  narrower  meaning  of  rationalization  of  \nthe  public  administration.  Although  universal  on  a  principle  level,  it  is  necessary  to \noperationalize  the  different  tenets  of  NPM.  Its  instantiation,  therefore,  ranges  from \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\ncomplete openness to market forces and privatization, as is the case in Taipei,China, to \nthe radical replanning of the public sector, as in New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, or \nViet Nam. It can also indicate a spectrum from cases of rapid advance toward managerial \nrunning  to  cases  of  coexistence  with  residual  links  with  more  traditional  forms  of \nbureaucratic government in accordance with predefined rules, as for example in Japan, \nthe PRC, or Malaysia (OECD 2018a). \n\nThis differentiation notwithstanding, it is possible to synthesize the basic features of NPM \ninto three fundamental elements (Christensen and L\u00e6greid 2016): \n\n1.  Redefinition  of  the  boundaries  between  state  and  market  through  privatization \n\nand externalization. \n\n2.  Reformulation  of  the  macro-structure  of  the  public  sector  by  delegating  state \n\nfunctions (at the lower organizational level) within it. \n\n3.  Redefinition of the operational rules characterizing the way in which the public \nsector carries out its functions and achieves its goals. This point consists of seven \nsub-components: \n\na.  Toning  down  of  the  ties  conditioning  the  public  sector  as  compared  with  \nthe  private  sector  \u2013  this  phenomenon  includes  the  transformation  of  state \neconomic bodies into limited companies; \n\nb.  Restructuring of activities/businesses in the public administration so that they \noperate  \u201con  a  commercial  basis,\u201d  that  is,  in  a  state  of  equilibrium  between \ncosts and revenue (corporatization); \n\nc.  Creation of a market with competition or simulated competition for public and \n\nmerit goods; \n\nd.  Devolution  of  functions  and  competences  from  the  center  toward  the \noutermost units or the lowest organizational levels within every entity in the \npublic sector; \n\ne.  Redefinition of the administrative machinery replacing the bureaucratic model \nwith  the  managerial  one,  shifting  from  formally  structured  and  law-oriented \norganization  to  management  and  efficient  breakdown  of  public  resources \naccording to the new economic role of the state\u2019s functions; \n\nf.  Deregulation of the functioning of economic and social systems; and  \n\ng.  Redefinition of citizens\u2019 roles and rights. \n\nNPM is not without controversy. Indeed, the body of criticism is growing. For example, \nHood and Dixon (2015) claimed that NPM brings little more than higher costs and more \ncomplaints. In a cautious evaluation, Dan and Pollitt (2015) asserted that NPM can work \nunder clear conditions. In their words: \u201cAn adequate degree of administrative capacity, \nsustained  reform  over  time  and  a  \u2018fitting  context\u2019  are  the  main  factors  that  \ncan  tip  the  scale  for  the  success  of  these  management  instruments.\u201d  Pollitt  and \nBouckaert (2017) examined the institutional arrangements under which NPM can work. \nHyndman  and  Lapsley  (2016)  claimed  that  NPM\u2019s  \u201cstory  continues,\u201d  especially  in  the \nmanagement of state-owned enterprises. \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\n2.3  Applying NPM to SOEs \n\nSchneider \n\nIndependent  from  its  conceptual  and  empirical  merits  or  shortcomings,  NPM  as  an \ninstitution, or as a set of normative principles, relates to SOEs and their management. \nInstitutional economics analyzes  the  role  of  normative  principles in  shaping  economic \nbehavior.  As  public  choice,  it  also  explains  how  institutions  themselves  behave  as \nrational agents maximizing their own goals. The connection of agents in institutions and \ninstitutions  as  agents  is  a  vast  area  of  work,  which  Buchanan  (2003)  especially \ndescribed. Regarding SOEs, Buchanan (1968) had already suggested how they might \nact if confronted with a dual mandate, that of providing public or merit goods and that of \nbeing entrepreneurial and making profits. \n\nNPM is a normative basis for the rules of the game; the state, however, decides which \ngame to play. In other words, while NPM is an approach to how the state produces and \ndistributes goods or organizes its processes as if they were productive and distributive \nprocesses, NPM cannot stipulate which goods, in what amount, or who receives them \nnor  which  processes  and  structure  the  state  should  have.  The  answer  to  the  \u201cwhich\u201d \nquestion is a result of political deliberation. NPM addresses the \u201chow\u201d aspect. This seems \nstraightforward,  but  it  has  an  important  consequence  from  the  point  of  view  of \ninstitutional, public choice economics. \n\nThe state sets political goals \u2013 which goods to provide \u2013 and NPM leads to an additional \ngoal \u2013 efficiency in the achievement of these goals. Note that efficiency is not a constraint \nunder which the enterprises provide these goods; it is a goal in itself. NPM wants state \nagents to maximize their efficiency, instituting a continuous process for increasing it and \nmeasuring the output of processes in terms of input. NPM measures and manages the \nefficiency of the state structure and of the individuals working in that organization. In most \ncases, increasing the efficiency of the individuals working in the structure increases the \nefficiency  of  the  organization.  A  system  following  NPM  also  rewards  the  individuals\u2019 \nenhanced performance. \n\nNPM, therefore, operates on and influences two levels, the level of the organization and \nthe level of the individuals working in the organization. Policies and instruments should \nthus address both of these levels to be effective. \n\nHow do NPM and SOEs interact conceptually? In markets and the theory of the firm, \nmake-or-buy  decisions  are  a  standard  way  of  increasing  efficiency.  Make-or-buy \ndecisions concern whether to produce a good in house or to buy it from external sources. \nTypically,  make-or-buy  decisions  weigh  the  costs  of  in-house  production  against  the \ncosts of external source commission and integration of the product. In applying NPM, \ngovernments  take  make-or-buy  decisions  regarding  the  provision  of  public  and  merit \ngoods.  Either  they  provide  the  goods  themselves  or  they  externalize  the  provision  to \nstate-owned  but  run-as-private  enterprises.  They  suppose  that  the  provision  of  the \npredetermined good via the organization of a run-as-private enterprise will bring down \nthe political and coordination costs of production as well as opening new perspectives \non the provision of the good. The set-up of an independent company with the sole task \nof providing the predetermined good thus promises to increase efficiency while delivering \non the goal that the state has set, the provision of goods. NPM, paralleling the make-or-\nbuy  decision  and  creating  the  SOE,  fulfills  both  goals,  the  one  related  to  the  political \ndesiderata and the one related to efficiency. \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nThe set-up of SOEs is not only a tool for combining these two goals. The very form of \nthe  SOE  as  such  produces  a  further  desideratum.  SOEs,  as  companies,  should  be \nfinancially self-sustaining and produce profits. Even if they are not (yet), their set-up, per \nse, presupposes that they are or should become financially self-sustaining. This triangle \nof different goals poses a problem.  If the state is to provide public or merit goods via \nSOEs,  and  if  SOEs  are  to  make  a  profit,  then  the  SOEs  would  price  their  profits  into \nthose goods. This, in turn, would mean that the goods in question are not public or merit \nbut in reality marketable and, consequently, non-state agents could provide them at an \neven lower price. The incidence of gain would at least stipulate the lowering of the pricing \npractices of the SOEs, which in turn would contradict the goal of operating at a profit. \n\nThis  is  more  than  conceptual  tension;  it is  a  challenge  for  the  management  of  SOEs. \nOften, the response is two-pronged. In their core activities, SOEs provide the goods that \nthe  state  stipulates  at  the  cost  level.  In  addition  to  providing  the  assigned  public  \nor  merit  goods,  SOEs  seek  new  business  opportunities,  for  example  entering  new \nmarkets,  offering  non-public/merit  goods,  or  expanding  their  field  of  activities.  In  their \ncore  activities,  SOEs  maximize  efficiency,  and,  in  the  additional  opportunities,  they \nmaximize profits. To ease the conceptual and managerial tension of their goals, SOEs \nbecome  hybrid  organizations.  They  are  at  the  same  time  a  state  agent  and  a  market \nagent (Bruton et al. 2015). \n\nWhile  this  approach  eases  the  tensions  of  SOEs  under  NPM,  from  the  point  of  view  \nof  institutional  or  public  choice  economics,  it  creates  problematic  incentives.  These \nperverse incentives have recently become an object of research (for example Cuervo-\nCazurra, Inkpen, and Musacchio 2014; Bruton et al. 2015; Liang, Ren, and Sun 2015; \nSchneider 2016; Daiser, Ysa, and Schmitt 2017; Guo, Huy, and Xiao 2017; Li, Xia, and \nZajac 2018). It is possible to cluster them into two groups. \n\nThe first cluster consists of perverse incentives affecting the SOE as an organization: \n\n\u2022  Whether they are too big to fail or not, SOEs enjoy a state guarantee; in some \ncases,  it  is  an  explicit  and  in  others  an  implicit  guarantee.  Regardless,  it  is \nextremely  unlikely  that  the  state  as  the  owner  of  the  SOE  would  allow  its \nliquidation. This state guarantee is comparable to insurance; the owner, however, \nexternalizes  its  premium.  This  leads  SOEs  to  expand  their  activities  in  riskier \nmarkets or to invest in less secure investments, relying on the guarantee in the \ncase of failure. At least, most SOEs do not fully internalize the value of the state \nguarantee in their internal accounting. \n\n\u2022  As entities enjoying a state guarantee, with a sovereign equity holder and often \nwith  exclusivity  if  not  a  monopoly  over  their  core  activities,  SOEs  also  aim  to \nbecome  financially  self-sustainable.  This  makes  them  more  appealing  to  non-\nstate  investors.  Because  of  this  implied  stability,  SOEs  can  raise  money  from \ndebt  at  below-average  market  rates.  This  gives  them  an  advantage  over  their \nprivate  competition,  which  ironically  leads  to  market  competition  challenging \nSOEs less, incentivizing them to be less efficient. \n\n\u2022  SOEs often cross-subsidize their activities. Under NPM, SOEs have the incentive \nto cross-subsidize from their core activities\u2014from which they cannot make profits \nbut can enjoy exclusivity and monopoly and therefore have little incentive to be \nefficient\u2014to  their  pursuit  of  additional  business  opportunities.  If  they  have  no \nmeans for cross-subsidizing or if the law forbids them to do so, this still occurs, \nalbeit  indirectly,  for  example  through  adjusting  their  overhead  costs  or  cost  of \ncapital. This, again, leads to the distortion of the competitive markets in which not \nonly SOEs but also private companies operate. \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nAn example of these incentives materializing in Asian economies is the situation in which \nChinese SOEs have easier access to capital and the capital that they access is cheaper. \nThis is the result not only of pushing banks to lend money to other SOEs but also of the \nfact that, in the banks\u2019 risk management systems, they usually rank SOEs as less risky \nthan other investments and therefore lend means at a lower price. In Japan, the postal \nsystem uses its monopoly to cross-subsidize its banking branch (ADB 2018). \n\nThe second cluster consists of those perverse incentives affecting the people who work \nin  an  SOE\u2014this  is  the  cluster  that  arises  from  NPM  influencing  not  only  the \norganizational level but also the personal level: \n\n\u2022  People  working  in  SOEs  have  an  incentive  to  show  entrepreneurialism\u2014or  \nat  least  management  performance\u2014since  the  SOEs  employ  them  not  only  \nto  provide  goods  but  also  to  run  a  company  according  to  management \nbenchmarks.  Showing  entrepreneurialism  in  an  organization  that  makes  it \npossible to underestimate costs or to externalize risks rationally entails acting on \nthe incentives shown above. This means that there are not only incentives for the \norganization but also an incentive within the organization for management agents \nto act on those incentives. This, in turn, accelerates the imbalances discussed \nabove. \n\n\u2022  SOEs  are  near-state  entities.  The  state  is  not  only  the  owner  but  also  the \nlawmaker  and  regulator.  People  change  their  roles  easily,  since  many  former \nstate employees work in SOEs and vice versa. Agents within SOEs and agents \nwithin the state have incentives to use the double role of the owner to maintain a \nlegal and regulatory environment that is favorable for SOEs. Furthermore, they \nare  motivated,  if  an  SOE  becomes  troubled,  to  change  the  legal  or  regulatory \nframework  to  maintain  the  troubled  asset.  This,  again,  accelerates  the  market \nimbalances, especially in relation to private entrepreneurs, but also expunges the \nagents\u2019 personal responsibility for their decisions, which again, negatively affects \nefficiency. \n\n\u2022  People  working  in  SOEs  have  incentives  to  act  as  entrepreneurs,  but  they  \nare  equally  motivated  to  act  as  state  agents.  This  could  lead  to  the  arbitrage  \nof  responsibility:  when  business  progresses  well,  these  agents  understand \nthemselves  as  entrepreneurs;  when  business  proceeds  badly,  they  see \nthemselves  as  state  agents.  Rewarding  managers  for  their  entrepreneurialism \nbut  not  holding  them  responsible  for  mistakes  again  provides  disincentives  \nfor efficiency. \n\nTwo examples make these incentives plausible. In Viet Nam, there is often a \u201crevolving \ndoor\u201d  between  institutions  of  the  state  and  SOEs;  this  means  that  individuals  often \nchange their place of employment between these two. In India and the Republic of Korea, \nthe  state  administration  has  often  changed  the  regulatory  rules  to  accommodate  the \nneeds of SOEs (ADB 2018).  \n\nIn sum, applying NPM to SOEs is not as straightforward as it seems. Compiled from the \nperspective of institutional, public choice economics, this brief list shows that applying \nNPM to SOEs sets perverse incentives for the organization and the individuals working \nfor it. The many calls for reforming SOEs in the \u201cEast\u201d and the \u201cWest\u201d confirm this finding. \nThe literature that the introductory section to this paper referred to indicates not only that \nsupranational  and  regional  organizations  are  concerned  about  the  many  wrong \nincentives on which SOEs act contemporarily but also that even national agencies and \nthose holding SOEs are committed to a reform. \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nThis reform, however, needs neither the entire abandonment of the SOE model nor the \nreplacement of NPM. Indeed, NPM itself can advance resources for the reform. It is the \ngoal  of  the  next  section  to  explain  how  strengthening  the  institutional  basis  that  NPM \nsets out can make SOE reform possible. \n\n3.  DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK: STRATEGY  \n\nAND INDEPENDENCE \n\nThe above-mentioned perverse incentives and imbalances occur because the \u201crules of \nthe game\u201d for SOE allow them. While committing to NPM, an ownership strategy and \nindependence can complement these institutions on which the government runs SOEs. \n\n3.1  Strategy \n\nStrategic management involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals \nand initiatives that an organization\u2019s top management adopts on behalf of owners, based \non  consideration  of  the  resources  and  an  assessment  of  the  internal  and  external \nenvironments in which the organization operates (Nag, Hambrick, and Chen 2007; Hill, \nJones, and Schilling 2014). Porter (2006) identified three principles underlying strategy: \ncreating a \u201cunique and valuable market position\u201d; making trade-offs by choosing \u201cwhat \nnot \ncompany  activities  with  \none another to support the chosen strategy. Management theory and practice often make \na  distinction  between  strategic  management  and  operational  management,  with \noperational management concerned primarily with improving efficiency and controlling \ncosts within the boundaries that the organization\u2019s strategy sets. \n\n\u201cfit\u201d  by  aligning \n\nto  do\u201d;  and \n\ncreating \n\nMost studies consider strategic management from the perspective of the enterprise\u2014\nmost SOEs do have a strategy\u2014it can also be an instrument for its owner (or owners), \nin which case they call it the ownership strategy. In this strategy, the owner answers two \nquestions: what does the owner want to achieve with the enterprise and what does the \nowner want the enterprise to achieve. Formulating an ownership strategy is the task of \nthe owner; for the enterprise that it addresses, the ownership strategy is an institution, \npart of the \u201crule of the game,\u201d or a normative basis. \n\nThis instrument is applicable to SOEs. When the state develops an ownership strategy \nfor  each  SOE  that  it  owns,  it  can  mitigate  the  problems  mentioned  above  while \nstrengthening  governance  and  even  positively  influencing  performance.  In  the  past, \nmany state owners either did not devise a comprehensive ownership strategy for their \nSOEs or limited the strategy to setting strategic goals, for example profit expectations, \nannual  growth,  or  annual  efficiency  increases.  Formulating  strategic  goals  does  not \nsuffice  as  an  ownership  strategy;  indeed,  they  even  intensify  the  perverse  incentives \ndiscussed earlier. \n\nThe ownership strategy is much more far reaching, and, as Porter (2006) stated, it is a \nbalance between what to achieve and what not to achieve, stating clear outcomes for \nboth.  For  any  specific  SOE,  the  ownership  strategy  should  consist  of  the  following \nelements  (based  on  Schedler  2008;  Schedler  and  Finger  2008;  Sonderegger  2014, \n2015; World Bank 2014): \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\n\u2022  A legal and regulatory basis, including a statement about how enterprises can \nadapt  this  basis,  which  drivers  lead  to  their  adaptation,  and  which  body  is \nresponsible  for  adapting  them;  it  is  necessary  specifically  to  exclude  the \nconcerned SOE itself from all activities relating to the adaptation of the legal and \nregulatory base for its running, except for providing information though planned \nand organized channels in a planned and organized rhythm. \n\n\u2022  Grounded on the legal and regulatory basis, a clear statement about which public \n\nor merit good(s) the government tasks the concerned SOE with providing. \n\n\u2022  An  analysis  of  the  market  environment,  especially  addressing  the  question  of \nwhether non-state, non-SEO agents can provide the same good; the analysis of \nthe market environment contains a scenario analysis about the development of \nmarkets and goods. \n\n\u2022  The  positioning  of  the  SOE  regarding  the  provision  of  the  good  that  the \ngovernment has tasked it with providing as well as the market analysis; here, a \nclear statement about how the owner adapts its ownership strategy according to \nthe  development  of  the  market  scenarios,  especially  if  the  good  becomes \nmarketable, is necessary\u2014for example, the owner could state that, in the case \nof a good becoming a marketable good, it will privatize the SOE that provides it. \n\n\u2022  The goals that the state owner wants to achieve with the SOE as well those that \nthe SOE has to achieve for the state owner; these goals should be at least clear \nand ideally measurable. \n\n\u2022  The areas of activity of the SOE, consisting of guidance in at least two areas, one \non the core activities of the SOE and another on those business opportunities \nthat the SOE can pursue additionally; this guidance is a closed list\u2014SOEs should \nnot operate outside the activities stated here. \n\n\u2022  The boundaries of activities of the SOE concerned; this section enumerates the \nactivities in which the SOE concerned cannot engage as well as the reasons for \nthe  boundaries\u2014this  is  a  deliberate  repletion  (in  negative)  of  the  point  made \npreviously: the concerned SOE can only engage in positively listed activities. \n\n\u2022  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  that  the  SOE  has  to  use  in  its \ninternal and managerial accounting; in this step, the objective of treating the cost \nof  capital  as  exogenous  is  to  diminish  the  incentive  for  externalizing  risk\u2014by \nsetting the WACC, the owner is forcing the SOE to internalize the state guarantee \nas  well  as  its  more  secured  capital  structure.  Even  if  the  SOE  finds  financial \nmeans at a lower cost than the WACC, the obligation is still to calculate with the \nWACC that the ownership strategy sets. \n\n\u2022  Human  resource-related  matters,  especially  the  obligations  of  managers  and \nemployees  as  well  as  their  personal  responsibility,  including  automatic  career \npenalties  for  creating  or  accepting  conflicts  with  the  ownership  strategy  or  for \nengaging  with  the  state  outside  the  channels  and  rhythms  that  this  strategy \nestablishes. \n\n\u2022  Risk management, especially communicating the state owner\u2019s tolerance of risk; \nthis  section  also  includes  the  SOE\u2019s  obligation  to  set  up  a  risk  management \nsystem  disclosing  and  communicating  information  related  to  risks  and  the \nmeasures that it takes to mitigate them. \n\n\u2022  Matters related to the acquisition of and cooperation with other SOEs and private \nenterprises; here, again, the concept is of a closed positive list of situations in \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nwhich acquisition and cooperation are possible\u2014situations that this list does not \nforesee do not constitute opportunities for acquisition or cooperation. \n\n\u2022  The  establishment  of  two  circles  of  reporting  and  controlling,  one  within  the \nSEO\u2014between its strategic and its operative management\u2014and one between \nthe SOE\u2019s strategic management and the owner. \n\n\u2022  Provisions  for  conflict  resolution,  especially  for  conflicts  arising  between  the \n\nownership strategy and the SOE\u2019s strategy. \n\n\u2022  Channels and rhythm for the SOE to provide information and engage in dialogue \n\nwith the owner. \n\n\u2022  Channels and rhythm for the review of the ownership strategy. \n\n3.2  Independence \n\nthe  SOE  and \n\nWhile the ownership strategy ties an SOE to its owner, independence aims to strengthen \nits organizational structure as non-state. The goal is to reduce or eliminate the political \ninfluence  on \nthe  SOE  on  politics  and  \npolicies. Vernon (1984) was among the first to research the meaning of independence in \nthe  setting  of  SOEs.  Under \ntitle  \u201cLinking  Managers  with  Ministers,\u201d  he  \nshowed that dependence is a two-way street. On the one hand, there is dependence  \nof  managers  from  the  state,  but,  on  the  other  hand,  state  agents  seek  SOEs  as \ndependent organizations. \n\ninfluence  of \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nFurther  research  has  narrowed  this  scope.  Much  of  the  subsequent  work  focused  \non  the  members  of  the  SOEs\u2019  executive  and  non-executive  boards.  The  OECD  \n(2018a, 30\u201331), after a global comparison, put forward four key takeaways with policy \nimplications. These takeaways are broadly the same as those that the World Bank (2014) \nidentified in its toolkit for SOE corporate governance. They are: \n\n\u2022  Defining  the  responsibilities  of  boards  of  directors  through  centralization  and \nprofessionalization of the ownership function: An unclear distinction between the \nrespective roles of the board and the ownership function can hinder the board \nfrom  achieving  the  key  functions  of  establishing  a  corporate  strategy  and \noverseeing  the  management.  Good  practice  calls  for  a  clear  definition  and \nfounding  in  legislation  of  the  role  of  the  board,  in  line  with  general  company  \nlaw.  Insofar  as  all  SOEs  have  boards  of  directors,  it  is  necessary  to  assign  \nSOE  boards  a  clear  mandate  and  ultimate  responsibility  for  the  company\u2019s \nperformance. \n\nrule-based  and  a  state \n\nfunction  should  supervise \n\n\u2022  Professionalizing board nomination frameworks: The nomination process should \nit  on  a  \nbe \nwhole-of-government  basis.  This  could \nfrom  \nexternal  recruitment  consultants,  establishing  databases  of  pools  of  directors, \nand  involving  the  incumbent  board.  When  SOEs  have  minority  non-state \ninvestors,  formal  legal  arrangements  should  also  ensure  their  adequate  board \nrepresentation  through  legal  provisions  or  corporate  bylaws  that  safeguard \nminority  representation  and  the  state\u2019s  active  engagement  with  shareholder \nagreements. \n\ninvolve  seeking  expertise \n\n\u2022 \n\nImproving disclosure related to board nomination and election processes: Formal \neligibility  rules  should  ensure  the  recruitment  of  suitable  and  competent  board \nmembers. These could include processes to advise or vet ministerial candidates \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nfor  board  appointment  or  actual  or  de  facto  nomination  committees  proposing \ncandidates for the ultimate decision of ministers. \n\n\u2022  Strengthening the role of SOEs in improving board efficiency and performance, \n\nsetting goals, and measuring and reporting outputs. \n\nWhile all these points are valid, from a perspective rooted in institutional, public choice \neconomics, it is advisable to return to Vernon\u2019s (1984) original research idea, looking at \nthe two-way relationship of dependence. In addition, two different levels interact here. \nThe first is the organizational independence of SOEs and the state. The second level \nconcerns  the  people  working  for  SOEs.  As  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  NPM \naffects the economic behavior of organizations and of the individuals therein. While the \nownership strategy includes provisions for the independence of the organization, these \n(and  other)  guidelines  address  the  independence  of  the  people  working  for  an  SOE. \nThese guidelines and the literature that the introduction to this paper quoted, however, \nfocus on the board of the company. While the board is important, so are other people \nwho  work  for  the  SOE.  Additionally,  state  employees  can  be  pivotal  for  maintaining \nindependence. \n\nHere,  because  of  this  broader  view  of  the  interrelation  of  SOEs  and  the  state,  the \naddressees of independence are, as the discussion of NPM asserts, the organizational \nas well as the individual level. On the organizational level, the following policies can help \nin  maintaining  not  only  the  independence  of  the  SOE  from  the  state  but  also  the \nindependence of the state from the SOE: \n\n\u2022  With the exception of those channels and rhythms that the ownership strategy \ndefines, the SOE should not maintain any contact\u2014formal or informal\u2014with the \nstate and vice versa. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf contact occurs, it is necessary to document and report it in the two circles of \ncontrolling mentioned in the ownership strategy. \n\n\u2022  When  in  contact,  for  example  through  the  channels  and  rhythms  that  the \nownership  strategy  stipulates,  the  SOE  and  the  state  must  follow  a  pre-\nestablished  agenda;  furthermore,  an  independent  agent  should  audit  the \nconformity  of  the  contact  with  the  legal  and  regulatory  base  as  well  as  with  \nthe ownership strategy. \n\n\u2022  The SOE must abstain from public affairs and lobbying activities in general. \n\n\u2022  The  SOE  must  abstain  from  marketing  activities,  at  least  in  their  core  areas  \n\nof operation. \n\nAt the level of the individuals working for or in an SOE as well as for or in the state, the \nfollowing policies should apply: \n\n\u2022  A change in employment from the state to an SOE and vice versa at any level \n\ncan only occur after a cooling down period of at least two years. \n\n\u2022  Current or former government officials, including elected officials, cannot work for \n\nan SOE or be elected or appointed to an organ of an SOE. \n\n\u2022  Current or former members of organs of an SOE, especially executive and non-\nexecutive  directors,  cannot  stand  for  election  or  be  appointed  to  any  function \nwithin the state. \n\n\u2022  Members  of  organs  of  an  SOE,  and  the  management  in  general,  should  be \n\npersonally accountable for their decisions. \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\n\u2022  The government should also implement other policies maintaining or increasing \nprofessionalism, integrity, and efficiency in the SOE, as the World Bank and the \nOECD proposed. It should broaden their scope from non-executive boards to all \nlevels of executives and managers. \n\n3.3  NPM + Strategy + Independence = A Framework  \n\nfor Governance \n\nOn an institutional level, NPM enables the pursuit of three goals: the provision of public \nor merit goods, the increase of efficiency in providing these goods, and the provision of \nthese  goods  through  an  enterprise  operating  with  profits.  NPM,  however,  does  not \nsuffice. These three goals can lead to conceptual and managerial contradictions, setting \nperverse incentives for SOEs and the people working in them, leading to moral hazards, \ncompetitive failures, and other imbalances. \n\nThis  study  claims  that,  while  NPM  can\u2014or  should\u2014serve  as  an  institutional  basis,  \ntwo  other  instruments  should  complement  this  basis  to  assure  the  balancing  of  these \nthree  goals.  These  instruments  are  an  ownership  strategy  and  independence  on  an \norganizational as well as a personal level. Different agents have already suggested these \nthem  by  broadening  \ninstruments.  This  paper,  however,  operationalizes \ntheir  scope:  the  elements  of  the  ownership  strategy  flanked  by  the  elements  of \nindependence applied to NPM create a framework that minimizes perverse incentives \nand maximizes the incentives for SOEs to pursue the three goals while balancing them. \n\n4.  LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES \n\nHaving developed the framework, it is useful to review the limitations of this model as \nwell as the challenges that it might face in its implementation. While the framework for \ngovernance that section 2 developed addresses and broadens all the desiderata that the \nrelevant  literature  has  mentioned,  the  scope  of  this  paper  still  constrains  it.  As  the \nintroduction and section 1 remarked, this paper concerned the institutional aspect of SOE \nreform. Next to this there is also a political aspect, which this paper did not address. It is \nimportant, however, to stress that only if the political aspect wishes and works for reform \ncan the institutional aspect yield positive effects. Simply said, the framework presented \nabove only works if politics backs and implements it. \n\nIt  is  worthwhile  noting  that  the  main  impediments  to  SOE  reform  that  research  has \ntackled to date arise not from the institutional set-up but from the political aspect. For \nexample, Leutert (2016), studying the PRC, identified four impediments to SOE reform \nthere.  One  was  related  to  NPM,  consolidating  hybrid  organizations,  and  three  were \nrelated  to  political  will,  aligning  mismatched  management,  untangling  managerial  and \nparty roles, and overcoming political promises. Setting up the framework mentioned in \nthis paper helps in reforming SOEs but not without the political will to match, untangle, \nand overcome politics itself. \n\nSimilar  concerns  apply  to  India,  where  network  roles\u2014party,  family,  religion,  and \nbrotherhoods\u2014are  more  important  (Bruton  et  al.  2015).  In  the  Republic  of  Korea,  the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  Viet  Nam,  SOEs  have  the  additional  task: \nhelping  to  overcome  past  and  present  conflicts.  While  conflict-solving  is  an  important \naspect,  it  adds  to  the  difficulties  of  governing  SOEs.  Conflict-solving  is  an  explicitly \npolitical and not an entrepreneurial task. Assigning this task to SOEs leads to their further \ninvolvement with and in politics (Turner, O\u2019Donnell, and Kwon 2017). \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\nWhile there is plenty of literature on reforming SOEs in Asia, there is considerably less \noutput  on  Africa  and  South  America  and  almost  none  regarding  North  America  and \nEurope (with the notable exception of Vernon and Aharoni (2014), which is, however, an \nupdate of an older study that they published in 1981. This might be an indication either \nthat SOEs are more important in an Asian context or that they are in particular need of \nreform there. On the other hand, it might also point out a blind spot in the research about \nSOE reform. While the framework developed here addresses the need for SOE reform \nin Asia and therefore relies on Asia-specific research, its formulation makes it applicable \nto other regions as well. \n\nWhile there is almost no argument against SOE reform, there is a wide variety of possible \nreforms.  Defining  which  reform  path  to  pursue  might  be  as  difficult  on  the  conceptual \nlevel as implementing the reform on the practical one. However, the main limitation of \nthe  framework  presented  here  is  the  question  left  open:  what  if  the  government  itself \ndoes not want a reform of SOEs? \n\n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATION \n\nThe following 10 theses about SOEs, their governance, and their reform conclude this \npaper (based on Schedler and Finger 2008): \n\n1.  Governments create SOEs to provide public and merit goods in organizational \n\nautonomy. \n\n2.  The function of corporate governance in SOEs is to increase their effectiveness \nand efficiency, thus creating value, while maintaining their adherence to the law \nand regulations. \n\n3.  Increased effectiveness, greater efficiency, innovation, and customer orientation \nare  the  factors  that  give  SOEs  legitimacy,  especially  in  comparison  with \nadministrative units of the state. These legitimize their set-up as enterprises. \n\n4.  The  obligation  to  provide  public  or  merit  goods  is  a  factor  that  gives  SOEs \n\nlegitimacy. This legitimizes their set-up as state-owned entities. \n\n5.  The  state  is  in  a  conflict  of  interest:  its  interest  as  owner  and  its  interest  as \n\nprovisioner of public and merit goods are never in full harmony. \n\n6.  NPM  might  exacerbate  this  conflict  of  interest  by  making  SOEs  balance  three \ngoals:  the  provision  of  the  public  or  merit  good,  increased  efficiency,  and \noperating with a profit. \n\n7.  The state can minimize this conflict of interests by devising an ownership strategy \nfor each SOE. The ownership strategy becomes part of the normative cadre for \nthe SOE. \n\n8.  Controlling  and  reporting  are  necessary  to  maintain  and  operationalize  the \n\nownership strategy. \n\n9.  The  state  can  minimize  this  conflict  of  interest  by  developing  a  policy  on \nindependence with two elements, the organizational independence of the SOE \nand the personal independence of the people working in an SOE. \n\n10. Independence  also  calls  for  the  state  to  be  independent  from  SOEs  at  the \n\norganizational as well as at the personal level. \n\nThe policy recommendation that this paper makes is the following: while NPM serves as \nan institutional basis, two other instruments should complement this basis to assure good \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\ngovernance  and  the  eradication  of  perverse  incentives.  These  instruments  are  \nan ownership strategy that the state\u2014as the owner\u2014gives to SOEs and independence \non  an  organizational  as  well  as  on  a  personal  level\u2014which  the  state  should  set  as \npolicies. \n\nThe ownership strategy of an SOE should contain the following elements: \n\n\u2022  A  legal  and  regulatory  basis  including  a  statement  about  how  enterprises  \ncan  adapt  this  basis,  which  drivers  lead  to  adaptation,  and  which  body  is \nresponsible for adapting it. \n\n\u2022  Basing on the legal and regulatory basis, a clear statement about which public or \n\nmerit good(s) the government tasks the concerned SOE with providing. \n\n\u2022  An  analysis  of  the  market  environment,  especially  addressing  the  question  of \n\nwhether non-state, non-SEO agents can provide the same good. \n\n\u2022  The  positioning  of  the  SOE  regarding  the  provisions  of  the  good  that  it  must \n\nprovide as well as the market analysis. \n\n\u2022  The goals that the state owner wants to achieve with the SOE as well those that \n\nthe SOE has to achieve for the state owner. \n\n\u2022  The  areas  of  activities  of  the  SOE\u2014the  SOE  should  not  operate  outside  the \n\nactivities stated here. \n\n\u2022  The boundaries of the SOE\u2019s activities. \n\n\u2022  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the SOE concerned. \n\n\u2022  Human resource-related matters. \n\n\u2022  Risk  management,  especially  communicating  the  state  owner\u2019s  tolerance  \n\n\u2022  Matters  related  to  acquisitions  of  and  cooperation  with  other  SOEs  and  \n\nof risk. \n\nprivate enterprises. \n\n\u2022  The  establishment  of  two  circles  of  reporting  and  controlling,  one  within  the \nSEO\u2014between its strategic and its operative management\u2014and one between \nthe SOE\u2019s strategic management and the owner. \n\n\u2022  Provisions  for  conflict  resolution,  especially  for  conflicts  arising  between  the \n\nownership strategy and the SOE\u2019s strategy. \n\n\u2022  Channels and rhythm for the SOE to provide information and engage in dialogue \n\nwith the owner. \n\n\u2022  Channels and rhythm for the review of the ownership strategy. \n\nIndependence, the second addition to NPM, consists of the following elements on the \norganizational level: \n\n\u2022  The SOE and the state should not maintain any contact\u2014formal or informal\u2014\n\nexcept for the channels that the ownership strategy stipulates. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf contact occurs, it is necessary to document and report it in the two circles of \ncontrolling mentioned in the ownership strategy. \n\n\u2022  When in contact, there is a pre-established agenda and auditing. \n\n\u2022  SOEs must abstain from involvement in public affairs. \n\n14 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nSchneider \n\n\u2022  SOEs must abstain from engaging in marketing activities. \n\nAt the individual level, independence consists of the following: \n\n\u2022  A change in employment from the state to an SOE and vice versa at any level \n\ncan only occur after a cooling down period of at least two years. \n\n\u2022  Current or former government officials, including elected officials, cannot work for \n\nan SOE or be elected or appointed to an organ of an SOE. \n\n\u2022  Current or former members of organs of an SOE, especially executive and non-\nexecutive  directors,  cannot  stand  for  election  or  be  appointed  to  any  function \nwithin the state. \n\n\u2022  Members  of  organs  of  an  SOE,  and  the  management  in  general,  should  be \n\npersonally accountable for their decisions. \n\n\u2022  Guidelines  on  professionalism,  integrity,  and  efficiency  in  SOEs  should  be \n\napplicable to all levels of executives and managers. \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 986 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nSchneider \n\nADB. 2018. \u201cState-Owned Enterprise Engagement and Reform.\u201d Accessed 5 January \n\n2019. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/evaluation-document/349826/ \nfiles/in407-18.pdf.  \n\nBruton, G.D., M.W.

The  main  assumption  is  that,  if  governments  constitute \nSOEs as \u201cmarket\u201d enterprises and allow their management to follow the logic of the \u201cmarket,\u201d \nSOEs  will  become  productive,  innovative,  and  customer-oriented.  This  paper  claims  that, \nalthough  new  public  management  is  a  necessary  condition,  it  is  not  sufficient  for  guiding  \n(or  reforming)  SOEs.  Strategic  guidance  from  the  owner  (i.e.  the  state)  as  well  as \nindependence from the government have to complement it. The strategic guidance that the \nowner  gives  to  an  SOE  has  to  address  several  areas  of  guidance.  Ideally,  it  parallels  \nthe ownership strategies that are typical of more mature family enterprises. On the other hand, \nonce the ownership strategy is in place, SOEs have to maintain their independence from the \ngovernment, that is, its owners, to avoid co-option from political goals or short-term deviations \nfrom the strategy. \n \nKeywords: SOE, governance, strategy, new public management, market imbalance, \nstrategic management, competition \n \nJEL Classification: H00, H11, M10 \n \n", " \n"]}
