The actual\ncauses lie deeper in the operation of the real, that is, the corporate sector.\nIn this context, the paper analyzes the micro behavior of individual firms.\nRisk-loving  behavior  of  revenue-maximizing  firms,  engendered  by  the\npolicy environment and the working of the financial sector, leads domestic\nproducers to expect a continuation of specific incentives and expansions\nin demand. Capacity expansion and capital increases, tools used for di-\nversification and grabbing larger market shares, are financed by raising\ndebt, resulting in high gearing ratios and making firms critically depen-\ndent on unimpeded cash flow and availability of credit. Against this micro\nbackground,  the  paper  argues  that  the  handling  of  the  crisis  was  inap-\npropriate. Since the financial sector often exhibits characteristics of a public\ngood, the paper argues for immediate recapitalization of banks through\nstate  intervention  that  rapidly  restores  credit  availability.  This  strategy,\nwhich  is  fiscally  viable,  will  revive  credit  to  the  real  sector  and  revive\ngrowth.\n\n\f1\n\nI. Introduction\n\nPopular sentiment in much of East Asia ascribes the East Asian crisis1 to sudden and\ndestabilizing withdrawal of foreign capital.2 This is the \u201cpanic\u201d view, encompassing bank\nruns, \u201cfickle\u201d investors, and \u201chot money\u201d.3 The argument is that East Asia did not exhibit\ntraditional  fundamental  weaknesses  associated  with  weak  or  \u201cwrong\u201d  macroeconomic\npolicies  that  result  in  currency  and  financial  instability.  These  countries  were  reportedly\nfollowing the \u201cright\u201d policies, hence, the East Asian miracle. Unlike the debt crisis of the\n1980s,  macroeconomic  indicators  in  East Asia  were  strong.  For  example,  precrisis  budget\ndeficits were low or nonexistent. Public debt and inflation rates were also low and invest-\nment,  savings,  and  growth  rates  (of  gross  domestic  product  [GDP])  were  high.4  In  some\nsense, this is also an explanation as to why the crisis was not generally expected, and sub-\nsequent rationalizations amounted to post-facto arguments.5 There have also been theoretical\nattempts to model self-fulfilling speculative attacks, usually with game theoretic assumptions\nabout expectations.6 However, regardless of the model, \u201cweak\u201d fundamentals are necessary\nfor  such  self-fulfilling  speculative  attacks  to  occur.\n\nGiven the comment about conventional macroeconomic indicators, \u201cweak\u201d funda-\nmentals need to be reinterpreted. By and large, the argument in the literature now runs along\nthe following lines.7 Starting in 1996, current account deficits of East Asian countries began\n\n1The  adjective  \u201cAsian,\u201d  as  opposed  to  \u201cEast Asian\u201d  or  \u201cSoutheast Asian\u201d  is  used  in  the  title  of  this\npaper, because in a geographical sense, neither East Asia nor Southeast Asia captures the geographical areas\naffected.  Subsequently  in  the  text,  we  revert  to  the  more  common  expression,  East Asia.  However,  the  five\ncountries  we  have  in  mind  are  Indonesia,  Republic  of  Korea  (henceforth  Korea),  Malaysia,  Philippines,  and\nThailand. A  currency  or  financial  crisis  can  be  interpreted  as  exhibiting  capital  outflows,  depreciating  cur-\nrencies,  failing  banks,  fall  in  asset  values,  and  loss  of  confidence  as  symptoms.  The  features  have  been  well\ndocumented  in  a  host  of  studies  listed  in  this  paper  and  elsewhere.\n\n2For Asian developing countries, net inflows on the capital account (as a share of host-country gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)  roughly  doubled  between  1984-1988  and  1989-1993  (see  Khan  and  Reinhart  1995).\n3Corsetti  and  Srinivasan  (1999)  argue  that  unlike  in  the  case  of  debates  on  the  European  Monetary\nSystem  between  1992  and  1993  or  Mexico  at  the  end  of  1994,  the  East Asian  experience  has  reduced  the  di-\nchotomy  between  \u201cpanic\u201d  and  \u201cfundamentalist\u201d  views.\n\n4In 1996, GDP growth rates were 5.5% in Thailand, 8.0% in Indonesia, 8.6% in Malaysia, 5.7% in the\nPhilippines, and 7.1% in Korea. Gross domestic investment/GDP rates were respectively 41.7, 30.8, 41.5, 23.3,\nand  38.2  percent.  Inflation  rates  measured  by  the  consumer  price  index  (CPI)  were  5.9%  in  Thailand,  7.9%\nin  Indonesia,  3.5%  in  Malaysia,  and  8.4%  and  4.9%  in  the  Philippines  and  Korea  respectively.  The  CPI  may\nof course have underestimated inflation because of controlled prices in the case of some essential commodities\nand utilities. Finally, the central government budgetary surplus as a percentage of GDP was respectively 0.9,\n0.8,  0.7,  0.3,  and  0.0  percent  (ADB  1998).\n\n5Unlike the debt crisis of the 1980s, macroeconomic imbalances did not originate in public sector fiscal\ndeficits, which may partly explain the failure to predict the East Asian crisis. In the 1990s, public sector debt\nas  a  share  of  GDP  declined  in  East Asia.\n\n6Apart  from  the  discussion  in  Corsetti  and  Srinivasan  (1999),  see  Obstfeld  (1998).\n7See, for example, Chapter 2, \u201cResponding to the East Asian Crisis\u201d, in World Bank (1999). There is\na  reason  for  using  the  adjective  \u201cnow\u201d.  For  a  while  at  least,  there  was  an  original  IMF  view  that  the  crisis\nhad been caused by deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals in the conventional sense. But this has also\nnow  converged  to  the  mainstream  diagnosis.\n\n\f2\n\nto rise. These current account deficits were sustained through short-term capital inflows in\nthe  form  of  short-term  private  debt  or  portfolio  investments,  encouraged  by  differentials\nbetween local and global yields on debt and securities. Given stable exchange rates, external\ncapital inflows were often uncovered and uncollateralized. Coupled with weaknesses in the\nfinancial  system8  and  inability  of  the  real  sector  to  efficiently  absorb  capital  flows,  an\ninvestment  bubble  began  to  build  up,  in  the  form  of  low  quality  and  speculative  invest-\nments, often with assets of doubtful value as collateral.9 Perverse expectations and a change\nin  capital  market  sentiment  triggered  a  run  on  the  currency,  which  then  spread  to  other\ncurrencies through a contagion effect.10 Once the crisis set in, private investment and personal\nconsumption  expenditure  also  contracted. A  recovery  based  on  exports  was  not  possible\nbecause credit mechanisms broke down and export prices could not be adjusted to absorb\ngreatly increased import costs. Both fiscal and monetary policies implied tradeoffs that were\nunacceptable.\n\nAgainst  this  background,  this  paper  revisits  the  causes  of  the  East Asian  crisis  to\nexamine the possibility that if the diagnosis had been different, and the structural causes\nof the crisis that existed in the corporate sector had been identified, the handling of the crisis\nwould perhaps have been more effective and have caused less social distress. We also use\nthe analyses to suggest a different approach to the handling of banking sector reforms. The\napproach suggested is based on the understanding, derived in the paper, that along with\ngovernance  weaknesses,  the  banking  sector  crisis  also  represents  a  case  of  market  failure\nand  therefore  presents  an  ideal  situation  for  public  intervention.  In  this  context,  we  take\nup  the  argument  put  forward  in  recent  writings  by  Wade  (1998)  and  attempt  to  provide\nan analytical framework for his \u201chigh debt model\u201d, extending the argument further by look-\ning at the future relevance of the Asian model of development. We conclude that the model,\nwhich is premised upon a close relationship between the corporate and the financial sec-\ntor and an active role from the government, remains valid but can be effectively used only\nwhen  some  of  the  governance  aspects  are  suitably  strengthened.  The  structure  of  the  pa-\nper is as follows. The second section is a brief review of the literature on the causes of the\ncrisis. This is done under five major heads: the current account deficit, short-term debt, the\nfinancial sector, exogenous factors, and efficiency-type arguments. These are macro argu-\nments  that  do  not  attempt  to  examine  the  structural  factors  in  the  real  sectors  that  could\nhave contributed to, or may indeed have been at the root of the crisis. Therefore, in the third\nsection, we examine firm behavior in an attempt to provide an alternative explanation as\nto why the crisis happened. The fourth section is devoted to governance type issues, with\na  focus  on  public  governance  rather  than  on  corporate  governance.  It  has  a  micro  focus,\nflowing from the discussion in the third section and can be viewed as an alternative and\nbetter way of handling the crisis. There is thus an attempt to highlight the analytical base\nof the Asian model of development and argue for its continued relevance for the region\u2019s\nfuture  growth.  Finally,  the  fifth  section  is  in  the  nature  of  a  conclusion.\n\n8The  argument  is  that  integration  into  global  financial  markets  had  not  been  backed  up  by  domes-\ntic  regulatory  institutions  as  a  prerequisite  with  usual  associated  problems  of  moral  hazard  and  adverse\nselection.\n\n9Competition  in  the  banking  sector  prevents  deposit  rates  from  dropping  and  lending  rates  from\nincreasing, thus squeezing the spreads of banks. Spreads can only be maintained by lending to high-risk bor-\nrowers,  aided  by  moral  hazard-type  problems.\n\n10One  can  factor  in  exogenous  shocks  like  the  Chinese  devaluation  (1994),  or  more  recently  the  de-\n\nvaluation  in  Taipei,China  in August  1997  or  the  recession  in  Japan.\n\n\f3\n\nII. Causes  of  the  Crisis\n\nA. Current Account  Deficit\n\nEconomists  argue  that  the  current  account  deficit,  as  a  percentage  of  GDP,  gives  a\nfair idea of a country\u2019s balance of payments (BOP). As we know, the current account deficit\nis nothing but the difference between national savings and national investment and is thus\na manifestation of excess demand. This is important for two reasons. First, it has implications\nfor  growth.  Second,  depending  on  what  is  happening  to  the  capital  account,  it  affects\nexchange rates and hence the competitiveness of an economy. With a higher current account\ndeficit,  if,  for  a  moment,  one  ignores  the  capital  account,  an  economy  that  operates  with\na fixed exchange rate runs into trouble as foreign fund managers start attacking (sell for-\nward) the \u201covervalued\u201d domestic currency.\n\nThe  Summer-IMF  hypothesis  traces  the  root  cause  of  the  East Asian  crisis  on  the\nfollowing simple hypothesis\u2014it happened because of large current account deficits in the\nregion. Large and persistent current account deficits tend to undermine the BOP position\nif any of the following happens: (a) Foreign loans are used for financing \u201cdud\u201d projects where\nthe  productivity  of  investment  is  low  relative  to  the  costs  of  borrowing;  (b)  there  is  low\nexport  diversification,  which  constrains  the  flow  of  foreign  exchange  earnings11;  and\n(c) foreign  capital  inflows  finance  domestic  consumption  rather  than  investments.\n\nTaken in isolation, the current account deficit only offers an incomplete answer. The\ncrisis started in Thailand where the current account deficit has been high since 1990, when\nit was 8.5 percent of GDP. But there is no explanation why the crisis took place only in 1997\nand  not  earlier.  The  question  therefore  is,  Does  a  high  current  account  deficit  necessarily\ntrigger a crisis? Surely the answer depends on how the current account deficit is financed,\nthat is, the composition of capital account inflows used to finance the deficit. Seen in this\nperspective and focusing only on the external sector, the crisis actually becomes a capital\naccount problem rather than a current account imbalance issue. Further, can a discussion\nof the current account deficit be delinked from the exchange rate regime? Stated differently,\nin principle a high current account deficit can trigger expectations about depreciation and\nlead to speculative attacks against a currency. But if current account deficits are not used\nto finance domestic consumption, there need not necessarily be any difficulties about ser-\nvicing future debt.12 The East Asian crisis was not a direct outcome of too much emphasis\non  present  consumption,  as  had  happened  in  Mexico.  Current  account  deficits  in  Mexico\nduring 1989-1994 were not accompanied by a commensurate increase in investments and\nwere  used  to  boost  domestic  consumption.  Unlike  Mexico,  in  East Asia  there  was  gener-\nally a fiscal surplus and high investment and saving rates.13 Domestic savings rates remained\nsubstantially higher than global averages. Since excess demand clearly reflected high levels\nof investment demand, the simple, current account based explanation for triggering the crisis\nbreaks  down.\n\n11Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) showed that countries with lower export diversification are more prone\n\nto  finance-related  crises.\n\n12The  problem  can  arise  if  external  borrowing  is  invested  in  inefficient  projects  in  the  nontradable\nsectors that do not generate income streams to service the debt. This may have taken place in some of these\ncountries, but as referred to in the next paragraph, the ICORs told a different story. However, this is clearly\na  case  of  market  and  not  public  policy  failure.\n\n13In  1994,  Mexico  had  a  current  account  deficit  to  GDP  ratio  of  6.4%  while  Thailand  had  a  deficit\n\nof  5.4  percent.  However,  the  investment/GDP  ratio  was  23.2%  in  Mexico  and  40.3%  in  Thailand.\n\n\f4\n\nIncidentally,  if  one  leaves  out  Malaysia  and  Thailand,  in  the  other  three  countries,\ncurrent  account  deficit/GDP  ratios  were  not  all  that  high.14  In  addition,  the  incremental\ncapital/output  ratios  (ICOR)15,  reflecting  the  productivity  of  investments,  were  low  as\ncompared to Mexico. For Mexico the average ICOR during 1990-1994 was about 7, whereas\nfor Thailand the average ICOR during 1991-1995 was around 5.16 Therefore, despite post-\nfacto rationalizations, it cannot be argued that the condition of weak fundamentals as stated\nabove was satisfied. There is no evidence in a country like Thailand that in general, returns\non domestic capital formation were too low to repay foreign creditors. Additional productive\ncapacity was indeed converted into extra earnings in terms of foreign currency.17 All these\nreasons  weaken  the  current  account  hypothesis  as  being  the  principal  or  even  one  of  the\nmain factors causing the crisis.\n\nB.\n\nShort-term  Debt\n\nHowever, the current account deficit can be linked not to total external debt, but short-\nterm  debt  (defined  as  debt  shorter  than  one  year  in  duration).  Such  debt  accumulation\nbecame  possible  because  of  liberalization  of  the  capital  account.18  There  was  an  increase\nin  short-term  debt  owed  by  private  financial  institutions  and  nonfinancial  corporations.\nAdmittedly, there were some cross-country variations in this. In Thailand and Republic of\nKorea (henceforth Korea), the borrowing was more by banks and nonbanking financial insti-\ntutions  that  performed  the  task  of  intermediation.  In  Indonesia,  there  was  a  lot  of  direct\nborrowing  by  nonfinancial  institutions.  Although  data  on  short-term  debt  are  at  best\nimperfect, in Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand, the short-term debt to foreign exchange re-\nserves ratio was more than 100 percent in mid-1997 (World Bank Global Economic Prospects\n1998).19 Such short-term debt often creates mismatches between currency and maturity of\n\n14In Korea, it was below 3% till 1996, when it went up to 4.8 percent. In Indonesia, it was less than\n\n3.5%  throughout.  In  the  Philippines,  it  varied  between  4.5  and  5.5  percent.\n\n15ICOR denotes additional capital required to produce an extra unit of output. Hence a lower ICOR\n\ngenerally  reflects  higher  productivity  of  investments.\n\n16ICOR  figures  are  from  Rakshit  (1997).  However,  it  is  also  true  that  ICORs  rose  in  the  1990s.  This\ncould be due to diminishing returns to capital as well as deteriorating investment quality, typical during credit\nbooms.\n\n17There  was  no  reason  to  believe  that  these  countries  would  be  unable  to  service  external  debt\nfrom export revenues. The debt service ratios (amortization and interest) as percentage of export (both goods and\nservices) revenue improved from the 1980s till 1996. In 1996 the debt service ratios were 11.5% for Thailand, 36.8%\nfor  Indonesia,  5.9%  for  Malaysia,  and  13.7%  for  the  Philippines  (Asian  Development  Bank  1997),  the  Korean\nfigure  not  being  available.  External  debt  was  thus  not  a  problem  except  for  Indonesia,  and  even  there,  the\ndebt-service ratio had improved since the late 1980s, although it had deteriorated compared to the early 1980s.\n18In  a  country  like  Korea,  there  were  controls  on  foreign  direct  investments,  but  controls  on  short-\n\nterm  borrowing  had  been  removed.\n\n19These  three  countries  were  the  worst  affected  from  the  crisis.  In  contrast,  the  Philippines  and\nMalaysia, with short-term exposures below 100%, were not that affected in relative terms. For all of East Asia\nas  an  indicative  average,  the  ratio  of  short-term  debt  to  reserves  went  up  from  100%  in  June  1994  to  134%\nin  June  1997.  There  is  also  the  point  that  gross  reserves  were  bad  indicators  of  international  liquidity,  since\nthese were not necessarily usable reserves and liabilities existed. In Thailand, there were outstanding forward\ncontracts. And in Korea, reserves were lent to commercial banks through a special fund. In a background paper\nprepared for Michel Camdessus\u2019 presentation to the Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meeting (16 January 1999,\nFrankfurt),  one  has  specific  short-term  debt  figures  for  all  five  countries  in  1996.  They  are  the  following:\nThailand\u2014total  external  debt  of  $90.5  billion,  short-term  debt  of  $37.6  billion;  Malaysia\u2014total  external  debt\nof $38.7 billion, short-term debt of $9.7 billion; Indonesia\u2014total external debt of $130.2 billion, short-term debt\nof  $28.0  billion;  Philippines\u2014total  external  debt  of  $41.9  billion,  short-term  debt  of  $7.2  billion;  Korea\u2014\ntotal  external  debt  of  $160.7  billion,  short-term  debt  of  $100.0  billion.\n\n\f5\n\nliabilities  and  assets.20  In  principle,  a  liquidity  problem  is  thus  possible  (see  Radelet  and\nSachs  1998). Yet  another  factor  can  be  clubbed  in. A  high  ratio  of  M2  money  to  reserves,\ncoupled  with  fixed  exchange  rates,  can  potentially  lead  to  a  run  on  reserves  by  residents\nbecause the residents are no longer sure of the future store of value function of their cur-\nrency  holdings  and  realize  that  government  reserves  may  not  suffice  for  supporting  the\ncurrency in circulation. This represents a loss of confidence in the government and its capacity\nto  handle  the  economic  situation.\n\nThe issue of short-term debt cannot be properly understood without making a ref-\nerence to monetary policy used to sterilize capital inflows, thus contributing to an increase\nin domestic interest rates. The increase in interest rates stimulated further capital inflows\nin a situation where global interest rates were dropping.21 More importantly, differentials\nbetween domestic and global interest rates created an incentive for foreign borrowing. Since\nexchange rates were stable (pegged to the dollar or pegged to baskets where the dollar had\na high weight), this borrowing was often unhedged.22 And since interest rates on short-term\nborrowing were lower than for long-term credit in line with the conventional yield curve,\nthere  was  a  built-in  incentive  in  favor  of  short-term  debt.23  In  an  effort  to  lower  borrow-\ning  costs,  banks  and  their  corporate  customers  preferred  loans  in  foreign  currency  and\nundertook  most  of  their  foreign  borrowing  in  short  maturities.  The  implicit  understand-\ning  was  that  these  credits  would  always  be  rolled  over  as  long  as  they  were  regularly\nserviced by corporate borrowers. Thus, in the upswing phase of the cycle, these represented\nlong-term credit at relatively cheaper interest rates. For instance, banks took recourse to short-\nterm, foreign-denominated borrowing in the interbank market to fund long-term bank loans.\nIn Indonesia, between January 1991 and June 1997, the nominal interest rate spread (local\ndeposit rate minus LIBOR rate) was 11.5 percent, with an average annual depreciation against\nthe US dollar of 3.8 percent (World Bank Global Economic Prospects 1998).24 Quite understand-\nably,  the  ratio  of  short-term  foreign  debt  to  equity  ranged  from  40  per  cent  in  Indonesia\nto almost 100 percent in Korea.25 As a contributory cause to the crisis, the case is that there\n\n20If  investor  confidence  turns  perverse,  it  may  become  difficult  to  borrow  again  from  international\n\ncapital  markets  to  meet  debt  service  obligations  or  roll  over  short-term  debt.\n\n21Low American interest rates are especially relevant. Financial volatility was perceived to be lower\nfor  East Asia  than  for  Latin America.  There  is  a  positive  correlation  between  prudent  macroeconomic  poli-\ncies  and  financial  stability.  Hausmann  and  Rojas-Suarez  (1996)  have  shown  that  volatility  of  real  exchange\nrate matters in the presence of high domestic inflation rates\u2014a direct offshoot of following imprudent monetary\npolicies. A study undertaken by BIS during 1996 arrived at the conclusion that greater financial volatility in\nemerging Latin American economies during the 1980s was because of higher rates of inflation and hence volatile\nreal exchange rates there. Higher inflation rates, by lowering real interest rates and values of bank assets, in-\ncrease volatility of domestic financial markets. The working principles of banks are characterized by borrowing\nshort and lending long. Deposits are redeemable at par, and depositors are assured of getting immediate access\nto liquidity, provided that not everyone tries to withdraw funds simultaneously. Volatility sharply alters the\nrelationship between value of bank assets and liabilities beyond the ex ante protection provided by bank capital,\nand  hence  increases  vulnerability.\n\n22Other than virtually stable exchange rates, deposit insurance and government guarantees reduced\n\n23Paradoxically, with the benefit of hindsight, interest rates did not factor in expected exchange rate\n\nsystemic  risk  further.\n\ndepreciation.\n\n24Although  not  as  sharp,  there  were  similar  interest  rate  spreads  in  the  other  countries  as  well,\n\nespecially  in  the  Philippines  and  Thailand.\n\nEconomic  Prospects  1998).\n\n25These figures are based on a database of 5,500 East Asian firms in nine countries (World Bank Global\n\n\f6\n\nwas state oversight in fully understanding the implications of high short-term private sector\ndebt.  The  complacency  was  on  account  of  the  private  nature  of  the  short-term  debt.  The\nassumption  (proved  wrong  later)  was  that  private  borrowers  would  borrow  only  if  they\ncould  ensure  that  rates  of  return  were  high  enough  to  service  their  debt.\n\nC. Fragility  of  the  Financial  Sector\n\nHigh short-term external debt by the corporate sector and high leveraging was only\none example of a broader issue of financial sector fragility. Banking history is replete with\nexamples of credit booms that led to speculative bubbles, aided by unwarranted optimism\nand mispricing of risk, especially with weak legal and supervisory structures. Between 1990\nand 1996, the ratio of bank lending to GDP grew by more than 50 percent in Thailand and\nthe Philippines. It grew by 27 percent in Malaysia and around 15 percent in Hong Kong,\nChina; Indonesia; Korea; and Singapore (Corsetti et al. 1998). While private credit to GDP\nratio increases as per capita income increases, the increases in East Asia were far higher than\nindicated by increases in per capita income alone (World Bank Global Economic Prospects 1998).\nA credit boom per se is not a problem, provided that investment decisions are sound and\nlenders  retain  confidence  in  that  soundness.  However,  it  is  not  always  possible  to  screen\ngood borrowers from bad ones.26 In the process of handling the problem of asymmetric in-\nformation  and  separating  good  borrowers  from  bad  ones,  banks  ration  their  credit.  The\nimplicit assumption in this is that investors borrowing at \u201cbank optimal\u201d27 rates of inter-\nest are safe and are less likely to invest in dud projects. But this risk-averse behavior of banks\nbroke down in East Asia thanks to the presence of implicit deposit guarantees28 and stable\nexchange rates. This made credit risk extremely underpriced and led to problems of moral\nhazard,  since  there  was  little  bank  supervision  and  no  penalty  for  managers.29  The  prac-\ntice  of  commercial  banks  to  use  market  values  of  real  estate  assets  as  collateral  for  loans\nalso  contributed  to  the  creation  of  the  credit  bubble.  In  the  slightly  longer  run,  as  high-\nyielding  projects  got  exhausted  and  excess  supply  emerged  in  the  property  sector,  banks\nbegan  to  incur  losses.30  In  Indonesia,  bad  debt  problems  surfaced  in  the  early  1990s  and\nearlier, in the mid-1980s, both Malaysia and Thailand encountered banking crises (Caprio\nand  Klingbiel  1996).\n\n26Information  asymmetry  becomes  a  more  serious  problem  during  credit  booms  (see  Gavin  and\n\nHausmann  1996).\n\n27The  interest  rate  at  which  expected  return  to  the  bank  is  maximized  (Stiglitz  and  Weiss  1981).\n28Expectations  of  a  bailout  are  not  necessarily  based  on  government  promises,  they  occur  even  if\ndeposits are not explicitly insured (see Diaz-Alejandro 1985). Balance sheets of financial companies often have\na public good character. Bank managers quickly recognize these externalities and take advantage of the situation\nof  being  either  \u201ctoo  big  to  be  closed\u201d  or  having  a  near  monopoly  in  financial  intermediation  due  to  the\nunderdevelopment  of  other  financial  sector  agents.\n\n29If  enterprise  managers  live  in  a  Baumol  kind  of  world  and  maximize  revenue  rather  than  profits,\noutput  will  be  more  than  output  in  a  profit-maximizing  framework.  Marginal  costs  do  not  enter  such  a\nmanager's  calculations  and  output  is  produced  as  long  as  the  marginal  revenue  is  positive.  Overleveraging\nis  therefore  almost  axiomatic  as  firms  try  and  produce  larger  volumes  for  capturing  larger  market  shares,\nwithout generating sufficient investment surpluses internally. Banks can be made to function in a better way\nif those who benefited from risk-taking absorb most of the associated costs. A study conducted by Weisbrod\net al. (1992) on banks in emerging economies found that the franchise value (profitability of a banking licence)\nof  banks  have  fallen  over  the  years,  compelling  them  to  venture  into  more  risky  projects.\n\n30This implies that the costs of bailout become prohibitive and sooner or later, government guarantees\n\non  deposits  will  no  longer  be  implementable,  thus  triggering  a  crisis.\n\n\f7\n\nThe moral hazard problem manifested itself in two other ways as well\u2014corporate\nand international. At the corporate level, political pressures to maintain high rates of eco-\nnomic growth led to a tradition of public guarantees to private projects, some of which were\neffectively  undertaken  under  government  control,  directly  subsidized,  or  supported  by\npolicies of directed credit to favored firms and industries (see IMF 1998). Even in the ab-\nsence  of  explicit  promises  of  \u201cbail-out\u201d,  underlying  systemic  risk  was  nonexistent.  The\ninternational  dimension  of  the  moral  hazard  problem  hinged  upon  the  behavior  of  inter-\nnational banks, which during the period leading up to the crisis, lent large amounts of money\nto domestic intermediaries, neglecting their risk management capability (McKinnon and Pill\n1994). Banks, both domestic and international, could have become complacent in their credit\nappraisal as a result of the long and sustained economic growth in these countries, that made\nthoughts  of  a  cyclical  downswing  look  remote  and  unrealistic.  Such  an  \u201cover  lending\u201d\nsyndrome reflects classic \u201cmoral hazard\u201d as all those involved firmly believe that in the case\nof financial disaster, they will be bailed out either directly by the government, or through\nindirect  IMF  and/or  other  multilateral  support. A  large  proportion  of  foreign  debt  accu-\nmulation  took  the  form  of  bank-related  short-term,  unhedged,  and  foreign-currency-\ndenominated  liabilities.\n\nAnother  feature  contributing  to  the  fragility  of  the  banking  sector  in  these  econo-\nmies was weak monitoring and supervising capabilities and practices of the central bank(s).\nIn  those  countries  central  banks  did  not  enjoy  autonomy  in  their  twin  roles  of  supervis-\ning commercial banks and maintaining monetary stability. In the absence of strong central\nbank supervision and enforcement of prudential norms, commercial banking and nonbanking\nfinancial  companies  have  been  characterized  by\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nsignificant  undercapitalization;  widespread  insider;  connected  or  directed\nlending  (Krugman  1994),  weak  credit  appraisal  and  portfolio  management\ncapacities;\n\nnonobservance  of  prudential  norms;  unsatisfactory  asset  classificiation\n(Folkerts-Landau  et  al.  1995);  and\n\n(iii)\n\ninadequate loan loss provisions.\n\nFinancial  sector  liberalization  (under  considerable  external  pressure)  comprising\ninterest rate deregulation and opening of the capital account magnified these weaknesses\nas banks were exposed to large capital inflows and more sophisticated practices of foreign\nbanks  and  financial  agents. A  financial  sector  crisis  was  precipitated  when  the  fragile  fi-\nnancial sector with all its weaknesses was exposed to an external shock in the form of export\nslowdown,  decline  in  unit  export  prices,  and  steep  hike  in  interest  rates.\n\nBank efficiency also depends on the legal framework. Inadequate legal frameworks\nmake  it  difficult  and  time-consuming  for  banks  to  seize  or  transfer  collateral  behind  de-\nlinquent  loans.  There  are  essentially  three  ways  of  dealing  with  insolvency,  liquidation,31\n\n31Liquidation  is  a  formal  court-administered  sale  of  most  or  all  of  the  assets,  usually  in  piecemeal\n\nfashion. At  the  end  of  the  process,  third  parties  become  owners  of  the  assets.\n\n\f8\n\nrescue,32 and work out.33 Whereas both liquidation and rescue are practiced in developed\ncountry  markets,  the  general  norm  throughout Asia  is  work  outs.34  The  financial  sector\nsuffered from the weak legal framework for debt recovery and calling in of collateral guar-\nantees  in  these  countries.  This  weakness  of  the  legal  infrastructure  increased  the  chances\nof bank failure as they could not successfully use the workout procedures for debt recovery.\nThe slowdown in export earnings and hike in interest rates, announced by central\nbanks to defend the currency, drove corporate borrowers and subsequently the bank them-\nselves into Ponzi game type situations.35 More good money was pushed after bad loans in\nthe hope of outlasting the cyclical downswing and avoiding a final writing-off of these bad\ndebts. Financial sector liberalization permitted this \u201cevergreening\u201d of loans by allowing banks\nto charge differential interest rates and giving them access to larger credit volumes that could\nbe  used  for  keeping  the  loans  on  the  books  as  performing  assets.  In  hindsight,  it  is  clear\nthat  given  the  underlying  weaknesses  of  the  system,  this  liberal  policy  stance  simply  al-\nlowed the bubble to become even larger before it finally burst. Kaminsky and Reinhart (1995)\nnote  that  in  18  of  25  banking  crises  in  their  sample,  the  financial  sector  had  been  liberal-\nized  during  the  preceding  five  years.  There  is  a  similar  finding  in  Demirguc-Kunt  and\nDetragiache (1998), with a cross-country sample of 53 countries during 1980 to 1995. How-\never, the likelihood of a crisis is lower when institutional environments are stronger. Hence,\nthe  sequencing  and  pace  of  financial  sector  liberalization  is  important.  Thus  interpreted,\nthe financial sector problem can be described as one of sequencing of liberalization with-\nout  strengthening  financial  systems  and  improving  corporate  governance.\n\nThe question remains, however, that not all of the financial sector assets were \u201cbad\nor high risk loans\u201d. But as the currency crisis became a full-blown financial crisis and banks\nsuffered from depositor runs, triggered in some cases by misplaced policy stance, even the\ngood and viable borrowers suffered from an acute credit crunch. This caused extensive dam-\nage to productive capacities, leading to large-scale bankruptcies and unemployment. The\ncurrency and financial crises were thus transformed into an economywide recession. The\nquestion is, How did the region\u2019s banking and financial sector, which had helped to finance\none of the longest episodes of sustained economic booms, suddenly suffer from all types\nof  terminal  illnesses  arising  from  currency  and  maturity  mismatches  and  mountains  of\nnonperforming  assets?  The  question  would  perhaps  lead  us  to  answer  another  question,\nCould the credit crunch have been prevented if the diagnosis had been correctly done and\nthe corporate sector issues distinguished from the \u201cspeculative boom in some asset markets?\u201d\nOn the other hand, as argued by some,36 the premise that the crisis was a result of current\n\n32A rescue is a formal court-administered rehabilitation, reorganization, or restructuring in an attempt\nto preserve the concern as an ongoing income-producing entity. The end result is that one or more creditors\nbecome  in  some  way  owners  of  the  enterprise  (e.g.,  debt/equity  swaps).\n\n33Work  out  describes  an  informal  process  that  does  not  involve  court  proceedings.  The  debtors  re-\n\nmain  in  possession  of  the  assets.  Creditors  accept  either  reduction  or  rescheduling  of  debts.\n\n34For  example,  in  the  absence  of  legal  norms,  both  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  completely  rely  on  in-\nformal work out methods. Within the region, Singapore is an exception to this principle and Singapore amended\nits  old  law  and  modelled  it  in  accordance  with  the  UK  Insolvency Act  of  1985.\n\n35A  Ponzi-game  is  a  situation  in  which  a  firm  must  borrow  to  meet  an  increase  in  payments  of\noutstanding  debt.  The  additional  borrowing,  however,  serves  to  increase  firm  debt  load,  worsening  the  fi-\nnancial position of the firm. The firm borrows to survive, but in doing so, makes its position more precarious.\n36The  strongest  votaries  of  this  argument  are  Sachs  and  Radelet  (see  Sachs  and  Radelet  1998  and\n\nRadelet  and  Sachs  1998).\n\n\f9\n\naccount deficits and represented classic policy failure prevented a distinction between the\ndifferent sectors and issues underlying them. This could therefore be cited as a case of using\naggregate  policy  measures  that  resulted  in  greater  than  necessary  social  welfare  loss.\n\nD. Exogenous  Factors:  Terms  of  Trade  Shock  and  Slowdown  in  Exports\n\nSince  much  of  the  East Asian  success  story  depended  on  export-led  growth,  it  is\nunderstandable that any slowdown in international trade would affect these economies more\nthan relatively insulated ones. During 1996, there was a general slowdown in world trade,\naffecting export growth from this region. The East Asian economies suffered as their main\ntrading partners, Japan and Latin America, were badly affected by this recession. Japan also\nfaced problems due to an overvalued yen. Since East Asian currencies were tied to the US\ndollar, an appreciating yen meant rising import costs from Japan. While an overvalued yen\nhelped price-sensitive exports to Japan, there were adverse effects for import-intensive exports\nto  other  regions.\n\nThe  initial  years  of  trade  surplus  and  high  export  growth  had  motivated  many  of\nthese economies to invest heavily in capacity augmentation in steel, semiconductors, elec-\ntronics,  processing,  and  assembly  industries.37 A  global  or  regional  recession  thus  meant\nexcess capacity and in this sense, the crisis went beyond the financial sector and also ex-\ntended  to  the  real  sector.  Hypothetically,  it  could  have  been  possible  to  neutralize  the\ncontraction  in  demand  either  through  rising  domestic  demand  or  by  diversifying  the  ex-\nport basket to newer items and newer markets. Unfortunately, neither of these happened.\nTherefore, with the downturn in world trade, large segments of newly added capacities in\nthe industrial sector lay idle. However, short-term capital flows continued unabated. With\nthe tradables sector in bad shape due to the export downturn, too much of investment was\ndirected into nontradable sectors with long gestation periods and relatively lower rates of\nreturn. It was also directed to speculative activities, overextended industries, overambitious\ninfrastructure projects, and inefficient government monopolies.38 There was also a deterio-\nration in the terms of trade (and hence a fall in purchasing power) due to oversupply. This\nexcess  supply  condition  tended  to  become  more  critical  as  a  result  of  US  firms  regaining\nsome  of  their  lost  market  shares  and  improving  their  competitiveness  over  the  1990s,\nincluding continued domestic demand contraction in Japan. One of the features of the Asian\ncrisis  has  therefore  been  that  economies  in  which  the  share  of  exports  to  total  industrial\nsector value added has been higher have suffered relatively more than those that are rela-\ntively  more  self-contained.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  recession  element,  there  could,  according  to  some  observers,  be\na Chinese link originating from unification of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) dual\nexchange rate system on 1 January 1994, to slackening export growth from the region. The\nunification of the exchange rate, it is argued, led to a depreciation of the Chinese yuan and\nthus contributed to an export slump in other East Asian countries. The PRC gained mar-\n\n37Quite  understandably,  this  is  linked  to  easy  availability  of  credit.\n38For example, Nikon Industries Corp., a Philippine maker of electric appliances, borrowed $150 million\n\nto  buy  parts,  but  instead,  gambled  the  money  on  local  real  estate  (see  Goldstein  1998).\n\n\f10\n\nket share in the US and Japanese markets at the expense of these countries. There is no dis-\npute regarding the depreciation of the yuan, but there is certainly some dispute regarding\nthe effect of this devaluation (see Fernald et al. 1998). There is some empirical support for\nthe proposition that the impact of the 1994 Chinese devaluation was not significant. It should\nalso be noted that even before the unification of the dual exchange rate system, most trans-\nactions were actually conducted at the depreciated market rate. The existence of common\nfactors like recession in developed economies, movements in world prices of key exports\nlike semiconductors, and movements in the yen-dollar rate may have had more of a bearing\non  Eastern Asian  exports  than  the  devaluation  of  the  yuan.\n\nE. Efficiency-type Arguments\n\nNow that the crisis has happened, there are arguments that the \u201cAsian Miracle\u201d was\nonly a \u201cmirage\u201d, or that the region\u2019s problems can be seen as penalties that it had to pay\nfor deviating from the \u201cdisciplines\u201d of the free market orthodoxy. However, barring Krugman\n(1994) and the trudging factor (labor, technology, efficiency), most arguments are post-facto\nrationalizations. And most of Krugman\u2019s ex post analysis also stress the problem of moral\nhazard  rather  than  efficiency  growth.\n\nA rapid increase in input usage, like expansion of employment, increases in education\nlevels, and massive investments in physical capital can bring about rises in output levels.\nIt is also known that growth based on expansion of inputs, rather than on growth in output\nper unit of input, is inevitably subject to diminishing returns. The original Krugman (1994)\nargument is a re-run of this simple hypothesis, where growth faltered because of declines\nin  factor  efficiency.  When  one  accounts  for  the  role  of  efficiency  in  explaining  growth  in\nEast Asia, Krugman\u2019s findings were that the contribution was negligible (also see Roubini\n1998). The higher short-run employment elasticities in the case of East Asia reflect the higher\nlabor-absorbing tendency in manufacturing activities of these economies. This implies that\nthey opted for labor-intensive modes of production, with higher production made possible\nby  siphoning  labor  from  \u201cagricultural\u201d  to  \u201cmanufacturing\u201d  and  \u201cservice\u201d  sectors.39 Tech-\nnological  growth  for  the  region  was  low  vis-a-vis  international  standards.  Secular  trends\nin total factor productivity (TFP) are fundamentally an empirical issue. But the point needs\nto be made that the empirical literature does not indicate a clear trend in TFP during the\n1990s,  with  some  studies  actually  indicating  an  increase  for  East  Asia  (see  Collins  and\nBosworth  1996  and  Sarel  1997).  That  apart,  even  if  one  accepts  the  hypothesis  of  decline\nin  TFP,  diminishing  returns  would  have  accounted  for  slowdown  of  growth  rates  in  the\nfuture,  not  immediately. And  the  actual  decline  in  growth  was  far  more  than  what  could\nhave been explained because of the TFP factor (see World Bank 1998). Perhaps we should\nalso state upfront our general skepticism about the TFP literature, where decline in TFP ef-\nfectively amounts to asserting that our power of explanation of contribution by factors of\nproduction  has  gone  up  over  time.\n\nThe above brief survey of the literature has revealed that the discussion of the causes\nof the crisis has focused almost exclusively on the macro aspects with some attention be-\ning given to governance type issues in the financial sector. There has been hardly any attempt\n\n39However,  one  should  also  mention  that  there  has  been  \"casualization\"  in  the  process,  resulting  in\n\ninadequate  insurance  benefits  or  minimum  wage  coverage.\n\n\f11\n\nto answer the question, Were there any structural factors that contributed to the crisis and\nits  timing?40  Further,  the  answer  as  to  why  the  crisis  has  been  so  much  more  protracted\nand the recovery so elusive, compared to the Mexican or any other crisis, has been given\nin terms of the financial sector fragility or the breakdown of export credit mechanisms. In\nour view, these are at best partial explanations and they need to be supplemented by a more\ncomplete analysis of firm behavior if these questions are to be addressed, an effective re-\ncovery  plan  is  to  be  put  in  place,  and  some  relevant  lessons  are  to  be  drawn  for  other\ndeveloping economies.\n\nIII. A  Firmer  View\n\nThe thrust of the arguments in the preceding section is macro. We now turn our at-\ntention  to  a  micro  and  firm-level  view  of  the  real  (export)  sector  of  the  economy,  with  a\nfew stylized examples. This is meant to be a generic framework (especially for the export\nsector) and not an explanation that cuts across all the countries and firms across the board.\nSome elements of what happened in the export sector have already been mentioned\u2014terms\nof trade shocks, erosion in competitiveness, declining export demand, and increasing over-\ncapacity in some sectors.\n\nFollowing the 1994-1995 crisis in Mexico, an export boom took place, helped by con-\ntinued expansion in Mexico\u2019s export to the United States.41 The North American Free Trade\nAgreement  (NAFTA)  also  helped  through  export-oriented  foreign  direct  investments  in\nMexico. Such an export recovery has not happened in East Asia (barring the export growth\nin  the  Philippines).42  Exports  may  have  slumped  because  of  higher  costs  of  capital  and\nimported inputs, shortage of capital, and recession. About 50 percent of East Asia\u2019s exports\ngo to Japan and East Asia, so recessionary conditions within the region have also hampered\nrecovery.  World  demand  and  prices  for  primary  commodities  like  oil,  rubber,  and  timber\nhave gone down and so have foreign currency prices of manufactured products. These have\nbrought  down  the  rate  of  growth  of  international  trade,  which  adversely  affected  export\nrecovery  in  these  countries  as  well.  But  in  the  context  of  recovery,  two  questions  need  to\nbe  asked.  First,  why  have  exports  not  responded  to  the  price  incentives  resulting  from\nexchange rate depreciation? Is there anything other than the J-curve at work? Second, why\nhas manufacturing activity in general not picked up so far and what explains the spate of\nbankruptcies in this sector across all these countries? Is the answer to these questions simply\nthat the 1996 slowdown and the subsequent nonrecovery are cyclical phenomena? Or are\nthere more deep-seated structural issues at work?43 The earlier slowdown and the expected\nrecovery are related issues. Without understanding the former, one cannot explain the latter,\nsuch  as  why,  despite  substantial  depreciation,  exports  have  not  increased.\n\n40One tentative explanation along these lines was given by Laura Tyson, former chief economic advisor\n\nto  the  US  President  (Business  Week  21  September  1998).\n\n41The  United  States  accounts  for  85%  of  Mexican  exports.\n42Capital flows into Mexico also recovered to precrisis levels within six months and in relative terms,\n\nthey  have  taken  much  longer  in  East Asia.\n\n43See  World  Bank  (1998)  for  arguments  about  the  fall  in  world  trade  growth,  yen  depreciation,  real\nexchange rate appreciation, and price declines for major export products. As will be evident, barring the last\ntwo  factors,  the  thrust  of  our  argument  in  this  section  is  different.  Even  for  price  declines,  the  explanation\nis  in  terms  of  endogenous  firm-level  behavior,  not  quite  an  exogenous  shock.\n\n\f12\n\nIn an attempt to provide an answer to the question on why East Asian exports have\nnot responded to the currency depreciation and remained sluggish in the post-crisis period,\nthe  World  Bank  (1998)  makes  the  following  generic  points  about  these  exports:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nInitially, state intervention pushed export growth through sector-specific in-\ncentives that amounted to multiple exchange rates. These were a part of the\nmuch-debated industrial policy. Subsequently, such incentives were replaced\nby generalized incentives (trade and investment regime reforms, appropriate\nexchange rates, macroeconomic policies).\n\nThere has been a shift in the composition of exports from resource-intensive\nand  labor-intensive  ones  to  more  skill-intensive  and  capital-intensive  ones.\n\nCompetition  from  low-cost  producers  (like  the  PRC)  has  \u201cpushed\u201d  such  a\nshift,44  while  foreign  direct  investments  and  relocation  of  production  bases\nfrom first generation newly industrialized countries have \u201cpulled\u201d such a shift.\n\nThe export basket has become less diversified, both in terms of composition\n(specialization in high tech products like electronics) and geographical des-\ntination  (within  the  region).\n\nThanks to standardization and mass production, even high-tech products like\nelectronics have become \u201ccommodities\u201d, with little room for product differ-\nentiation  and  branding.  They  are  thus  price-sensitive  with  high  elasticities,\nand  can  lead  to  sharp  slumps  in  market  shares.\n\nIn  electronics,  Thailand  and  Korea  developed  national  firms.  In  contrast,\nMalaysia and the Philippines relied more on international production networks\nof  multinational  firms.\n\nIn our view the generic explanations provided by the World Bank study can be better\nappreciated in a general and analytical microeconomic framework that tries to model the\nbehavior of the East Asian firm. The basic assumption underlying our attempt to build such\na model is that over the last three decades, behavior of the generic East Asian firm (with\nobviously some variations across countries and sectors) has been different from the classic\nprofit-maximizing, risk-averse Marshallian firm, which is used for policy formulation in a\ncompetitive  market  framework.  This  analytical  framework  is  presented  in  the  technical\nappendix. On the basis of the simple model and stylized examples presented in the appendix,\nthe following points can be made about the behavior of the East Asian firm. It may be noted\nthat not all these points would have been obvious without these stylized examples as some\nare  counterintuitive.\n\n44For example, given the export basket, Thailand has considerable exposure to such low-cost exports,\n\nwith  higher  labor  costs  in  Thailand  not  being  nullified  through  productivity  gains.\n\n\f13\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nA specific incentive blurs the difference between revenue maximization and\nprofit  maximization.\n\nEither  a  specific  incentive  or  revenue  maximization  leads  to  higher  domes-\ntic output (greater investments in capacity); higher aggregate output translating\ninto higher market share for the domestic firm. There is a terms of trade effect\n(export  prices  go  down).\n\nRevenue maximization does not necessarily lead to lower profits compared\nto  profit  maximization.  Depending  on  marginal  costs,  it  is  possible  for  rev-\nenue maximization to lead to higher profits initially, and lower profits later,\nthan  profit  maximization.\n\nConsider a transition from specific incentives to generalized incentives. In that\ntransition, incentive neutrality may not be ensured for all sectors, even if it\nis ensured for some sectors. For example, incentive neutrality may be ensured\nfor  newer  products  that  face  greater  competition  and  have  elastic  demand\ncurves.\n\nConsider the domestic producer \u2019s expectations on a transition from specific\nto generalized incentives. A risk-loving domestic producer and the systemic\nenvironment may have encouraged such risk-loving behavior, and presume\nthe  continuation  of  specific  incentives.\n\nConsider  a  domestic  producer \u2019s  expectations  about  a  parametric  shift  in\ndemand. A risk-loving domestic producer will presume expansions in demand.\nIn the case of profit maximization, the premium on risk taking is a function\nof  the  differential  between  domestic  and  foreign  marginal  costs.\n\n(vii)\n\nIn  an  initial  stage  of  increasing  returns  to  scale,  it  is  possible  to  pay  labor\nwages more than the value of the marginal product of labor. But if this even-\ntually switches to nonincreasing returns to scale, labor can be paid more than\nthe value of the marginal product of labor only if capital is paid less than the\nvalue  of  the  marginal  product  of  capital.\n\n(viii) With  perfect  competition  in  factor  markets,  wage  increases  in  excess  of  the\nvalue of the marginal product of labor require declines in the price of capi-\ntal  or  increases  in  capital  input.\n\n(ix) With  declining  profitability,  increases  in  capital  through  equity  become\nunviable.  Capital  increases  through  borrowing  are  possible  by  artificially\nreducing the rate of interest, such as through state intervention. These trends\nare  accentuated  if  shortages  of  skilled  labor  become  a  binding  constraint.\n\n(x)\n\nLumpiness  of  capital  inputs  implies  cycles  of  overcapacity.\n\n\f14\n\n(xi)\n\nThis  entire  strategy  of  risk-loving  behavior  and  competing  on  the  basis  of\ncapital input increases borrowing, and low rates of interest become unviable\nif the rate of interest goes up and more importantly, if there is a binding con-\nstraint  on  the  availability  of  credit.\n\nThe workings of industry-specific incentive systems as part of the industrial policy\nregime, and the implicit government guarantees and support to exporting firms including\nthe conglomerate nature of these firms of having close links to premier commercial banks\nand  nonbank  financial  companies  (some  of  which  were  captive  to  these  conglomerates)\nresulted  in  a  firm  behavior  that  could  be  characterized  as  revenue-maximizing  and  non-\nrisk averse. This revenue-maximizing behavior implied a less than normal rate of profit for\nfirms. This was acceptable to them as long as their total revenue objectives were met and\nthe firms could continue expanding their market shares. The close cooperation between the\ngovernment  and  the  corporate  sector  was  also  instrumental  in  achieving  this  growth  ob-\njective and was also premised upon its continuing success. Commercial banks could continue\nlending to these \u201cvalued clients\u201d without much reference to prudential norms such as optimal\nexposure  to  a  single  client  or  single  sector,  since  the  successful  revenue-maximizing  firm\nbehavior  implied  regular  debt-servicing  by  these  companies.  Therefore,  even  abnormally\nhigh gearing ratios were seen as acceptable because the past track record was impeccable\nand  bank  managers,  perhaps,  even  at  the  highest  levels,  were  themselves  convinced  that\nthe East Asian firm behavior with its aggressive market entry strategies based on price com-\npetition and market share expansion was an all-winning formula. In this understanding they\nwere supported not only by the national authorities but saw strong reinforcement from mul-\ntilateral development banks and foreign investors. Multilateral institutions praised the Asian\nmiracle, and even more importantly, private foreign investors poured money into these firms\nin ever increasing volumes, unmindful of gearing ratios, debt servicing capabilities, and the\nrather  shallow  technological  and  skill  capabilities  of  the  borrowing  firms.\n\nThe making of the financial crisis was thus inherent in the firm behavior, and sup-\nported  and  overseen  by  national  governments  through  fame  and  funds.  These  revenue\nmaximizing and nonrisk-averse firms built up large and diversified asset portfolios within\ndomestic and foreign markets. Their capacity expansion and market entry strategies were\nbased  not  on  deepening  the  firm\u2019s  technological  capabilities  or  maintaining  high  (wage-\nadjusted) real productivity levels but on access to \u201ccheaper and unconstrained\u201d\u2019 supply of\nresources  that  enabled  them  to  successfully  grab  larger  market  shares. As  long  as  the  in-\ndustry  and  market  selection  was  right,  the  strategy  resulted  in  rapid  growth  and  higher\nmarket capitalization. This in turn brought forth access to greater resources and the \u201cvir-\ntuous  cycle\u201d  continued  with  gearing  ratios  and  stock  markets  valuations  rising  to  dizzy\nheights. The entire strategy was premised upon the continued success of revenue maximi-\nzation  and  market  share  expansion  by  exporting  firms  that  did  not  visualize  a  demand\nconstraint  as  they  were  operating  in  global  markets.\n\nThe strategy became infeasible with the demand slowdown in Japan, emergence of\nmassive excess capacity in some of the main export industries, sharp decline in unit values,\nand rising interest rates that raised debt servicing obligations. The change in the policy stance\nin some countries from specific to general industrywide incentives also implied that resources\nso far available to meet the industry-specific conditions were no longer available. The gov-\nernment oversight and support that was also an essential component of this strategy also\n\n\f15\n\nbecame greatly diluted due to the particular circumstances in each of the crisis-affected coun-\ntries. Korea effectively gave up the industrial policy stance after joining the OECD and also\nintroduced wide-ranging financial sector liberalization. Coordination with the chaebols, earlier\ndone  on  a  regular  basis  at  the  highest  levels  of  government,  was  also  greatly  weakened.\nThe government\u2019s desire to establish Thailand as a financial center and its taking over some\nof the financial business expected to shift away from Hong Kong, China after 1997 led to\naccelerated financial sector liberalization without the necessary strengthening of central bank\ncapabilities.  In  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  the  change  in  government\u2013industry  relationship,\nthough less marked, also took place as the governments tried to adopt the dominant mantra\nof minimal government intervention and financial sector liberalization. All this implied that\nfirms were free to pursue their private objective of maximizing growth and total revenues\nwithout any external policy constraint that could introduce social and broader policy con-\nsiderations  into  their  behavior.  The  advantage  of  a  government  agency  overseeing  the\nindividual firm strategies and combining it with a broader sector or national strategy was\nthus lost. In the absence of such coordination, individual firm behavior went beyond the\nfeasible realm. Unrelated and unwarranted diversification took place. As competition from\nUS and Chinese firms increased and expansion in tradable sectors became more difficult,\nfirms invested more heavily into nontradable sectors where returns were even lower, ges-\ntation periods longer, and resource requirements higher. The resulting currency and maturity\nmismatches and the liquidity crunch has by now been well-documented. We wish to point\nout  only  that  signs  of  the  impending  crisis  would  have  been  visible  much  earlier  if  gov-\nernment agencies and foreign investors had cared to look for them in the corporate sectors\nrather than in the macro variables like the current account and fiscal deficit where all at-\ntention was focused.\n\nCommercial banks and foreign investors, unable to see the shift in the policy regime\nand sure of the implicit government oversight and guarantee, continued with their relaxed\nlending stance to the corporate sector in these countries. When the external shock came in\nthe form of declining export growth rates, falling unit prices, and higher interest rates, the\nfirms and commercial banks, as stated earlier, were driven to Ponzi game type situations\nuntil the bubble finally burst. The necessary micro foundations of the Asian crisis can thus\nbe  seen  to  lie  in  the  behavior  of  the Asian  conglomerates  and  banks.  The  sufficient  con-\ndition was the change in government policy that permitted the externalities from individual\nfirm behavior to go unchecked in the precrisis period. The strong government goal in the\nearlier decades had served to keep these externalities in check and to reconcile private goals\nwith  social  objectives.\n\nIV. Role  of  Government  in  Bank  Restructuring\nin  Crisis-affected  Economies\n\nThese  micro  results  thus  emphasize  risk-loving  behavior  in  the  presence  of  uncer-\ntainty  (with  risk  neutralized  by  the  state),  expectations  about  continuation  of  incentives,\ncompetition  on  the  basis  of  state  intervention  in  capital  markets,  and  overinvestments  in\ncapacity in a Baumol-type revenue maximizing world. In such a framework, a credit squeeze\nrobs the firm of its competitive strategy. Restoring credit flows is thus crucially important\nin  any  rehabilitation  program.\n\n\f16\n\nThe aftermath of the East Asian crisis has led to a questioning of this developmental\nrole  of  the  state  in  financial  markets.45  The  Wade  (1998)  argument  is  that  such  question-\ning is unwarranted and there are no inherent problems with Asian state capitalism. The point\nin  fact  is  stronger  and  one  can  paraphrase  it  as  follows.  Contractionary  monetary  policy\ndrove  up  interest  rates  in  an  attempt  to  restore  confidence  in  the  East Asian  economies.\nWhether interest rate increases restore confidence in any economy is debatable, but certainly\nin  the  case  of  East Asia,  it  had  perverse  results  where  interest  rates  increased  between  5\nto 10 percent (see also Stiglitz 1993, 1998a). Since there were no macro imbalances to start\nwith,  interest  rate  increases  made  the  state  of  the  financial  sector  worse  and  contributed\nto a recession. Given what we said earlier about state intervention in capital markets, the\nfinancial system in East Asia had all the characteristics of a public good with positive ex-\nternalities. More than the hike in interest rates, the starving of credit contributed to firms\ngoing bankrupt, firms that had overextended because of risk-loving behavior and revenue-\nmaximizing tendencies. Coupled with the exogenous shock, there was now an endogenous\nshock. Some firms going bankrupt contributed to the deterioration of the capital position\nof banks, in addition to interfirm debt contributing to further uncertainty (Stiglitz 1998d).\nThe resulting credit rationing for even viable firms drove them to bankruptcy. With bank-\nbased  financial  systems  and  high  leverage,  households  and  small  and  medium-sized\nenterprises that had no substitute for bank credit were also faced with a credit crunch. There\nis now sufficient evidence of this credit-crunch-induced corporate sector crisis happening\nin Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia, with the impact less sharp in Thailand and the Philippines\n(World  Bank  1998).46\n\nConsider the following quote from Stiglitz (1998d). \u201cIn medicine, we have come a\nlong way from medieval blood lettings and blaming the victims for their condition\u2026. The\nfinancial system is like the brain of the economy. In a crisis it can virtually cease to func-\ntion\u2026. In normal times we view high capital adequacy standards as a way to ensure prudent\nbanking. The point of the additional capital, however, is to provide a cushion against bad\ntimes.  If,  in  the  midst  of  a  downturn,  we  push  banks  too  quickly  toward  \u2018prudent\u2019  capi-\ntal  adequacy  ratios,  we  risk  shutting  down  the  flow  of  credit  entirely\u2026.  The  procedures\nfor handling bankruptcies in normal times and in crises should be quite different. Just as\na central concern in the time of crisis in addressing the problems of the financial sector should\nbe the preservation of the flow of credit, so too the central concern in corporation organi-\nzation  should  be  maintaining  production\u2026.  Even  a  well-managed  firm  could  easily  go\nbankrupt  simply  because  it  failed  to  plan  for  an  80  percent  devaluation  and  a  period  of\ninterest  rates  in  excess  of  100  percent.\u201d\n\nHow does one break this vicious cycle and does the East Asian model have a role\nto play in this? What is the state to do about restructuring the banking sector and restarting\ncredit  flows  to  the  corporate  sector?  We  suggest  a  rather  straightforward  but  effective\nmodality  below.\n\n45A point has been made that the earlier financial liberalization was itself a deviation from the East\nAsian  model  because  there  was  little  or  no  control  over  external  borrowing  and  little  or  no  state  guidance\nfor  investment  (Brownbridge  and  Kirkpatrick  1998).\n\n46For borrowers who depend on banks, evidence of a credit crunch can be deduced from aggregate\ncredit flows, the spread between bank lending rates and corporate bonds (reflecting the risk premium for in-\ndividual economic agents), and the spread between corporate and government bonds (a general risk premium).\nUsing this methodology, a study by Ding, Dominic, and Ferri, quoted in World Bank (1998) finds widespread\nevidence  of  a  credit  crunch  in  East Asia.\n\n\f17\n\nAs  surrogate  measures  indicative  of  the  fiscal  costs  of  bank  restructuring,  one  can\nconsider the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans.47 Official NPL to loan ratios\nare 40% in Thailand, 7.9% in Indonesia, 21.8% in Korea, 10.2% in Malaysia, and 11% in the\nPhilippines (ADB 1999).48 With comparable methodology, Standard and Poor and J.P. Morgan\ngive ratios of slightly over 40% for Indonesia, between 35 and 40% for Thailand, and be-\ntween 20 and 30% for Korea (ADB 1999). Using J.P. Morgan figures, our computations are\nshown  in  the  following  table.\n\nTable  1:  NPL  Ratios  and  Recapitalization/GDP\n\nIndonesia Malaysia\n\nPhilippines\n\nKorea\n\nThailand\n\nNPL  ratios  (%)\n\n30-35\n\n15-25\n\n8-10\n\n25-30\n\n25-30\n\nRecapitalization  needs/GDP  (%)\n\nDebt/GDP  (1996)\n\nNew  debt/GDP49\n\n19\n\n24\n\n43\n\n20\n\n36\n\n56\n\n0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\n30\n\n9\n\n39\n\n30\n\n4\n\n34\n\nIn principle, there are six not mutually exclusive ways to bring about bank restruc-\nturing. These are bailouts (supplementing bank capital with public resources), nationalization,\nassisted  mergers,  recapitalization  and  subsequent  sales,  restructuring  plans,  and  liquida-\ntion  and  payoffs  (World  Bank  1998).  There  are  tradeoffs  in  terms  of  speed,  fiscal  costs,\nincentives for bank performance, and generating confidence in the banking system. For ex-\nample, bailout and nationalization are faster, although they lead to reduced incentives for\nbank  performance.  Conversely,  confidence  in  the  banking  system  is  restored  fastest  with\nnationalization and assisted mergers. Yet another taxonomy of restructuring can be in terms\nof a market-based approach, a recapitalized-bank approach, and a government-led approach\n(World Bank 1998). In a market-based approach, enterprises are restructured, assets are sold\nto  domestic  and  foreign  investors,  and  debt  is  restructured.  Given  what  was  said  earlier\nabout  the  role  of  the  East Asian  state  in  the  financial  sector,  we  are  skeptical  about  such\na market-based approach being fast enough or restoring confidence in the banking system\nsufficiently  quickly.  In  a  recapitalized-bank  approach,  the  state  recapitalizes  banks  on  an\nex ante assessment of their losses and does not intervene in corporate sector restructuring.\nWhile such an approach can be fast, our skepticism concerns the technical ability of banks\nto  bring  about  corporate  sector  restructuring  efficiently. And  the  avowed  reduced-moral-\nhazard  advantage  of  this  approach  may  not  come  about  because  the  state  continues  to\n\n47The  costs  also  depend  on  the  importance  of  the  banking  sector  in  financial  intermediation  and\n\ncorrective  action  taken  by  the  state.\n\n48These  are  for  different  months  in  1998:  July  for  Thailand,  January  for  Indonesia,  June  for  Korea,\n\nJune  for  Malaysia,  and  November  for  the  Philippines.  The  figures  are  not  comparable.\n\n49Since the figures are from the same original J. P. Morgan source, they are identical to the ones given\n\nin  World  Bank  (1999).\n\n\f18\n\nprovide guarantees and recapitalization is never close-ended. In other words, we are in favor\nof a government-led approach, where the state takes over distressed assets from banks and\nreplaces them with government bonds.50 Banks are recapitalized and the state tries to re-\nstructure the claims and bring about corporate restructuring, with the involvement of banks.\nSince the emphasis is on speed and restoring confidence in the banking system, the gov-\nernment-led  approach  has  much  to  recommend  it.51\n\nWe  would  therefore  prefer  a  more  active  and  interventionist  role  for  the  state  in\ntackling  the  financial  sector  crisis.  The  suggestion  above  is  to  allow  the  fiscal  balance  to\ndeteriorate  temporarily  and  use  these  resources  to  put  a  large  part  of  the  banking  sector\nback  on  its  feet  quickly  so  that  the  binding  financial  constraint  on  the  real  sector  can  be\nremoved and recovery started. Are government debt to GDP levels of between 34 and 56\npercent sustainable?  We believe they are. Depending on assumptions made about the real\nrate of interest and the growth rate of the economy, such debt levels can be stabilized with\na primary fiscal surplus of around 3 percent of GDP. In the period preceding the crisis, both\nIndonesia and Thailand were able to achieve such primary fiscal surpluses.52 Our suggestion\nthus  is  for  increased  government  borrowing,  both  domestic  and  foreign,  to  finance  the\nrecapitalization of banks. These debts can then be liquidated in the next round of reforms,\nwhich would focus on privatizing of state assets, including banks that have been restored\nback to health. This strategy has the merit of quickly bringing back the banking sector to\na healthy position and restoring credit to the beleagured corporate sector. This could be con-\nsidered  the  very  basis  of  an  effective  recovery  strategy  that  minimizes  social  distress.\n\nThe  road  map  for  recovery  obviously  goes  beyond  the  financial  sector  and  also\nencompasses the corporate sector.53 Per se, most of these suggestions are unexceptionable,\nalthough  there  is  scope  for  debate  about  sequencing  capital  account  convertibility.  Other\n\n50These  securities  can  later  be  used  to  develop  a  pension  program.\n51Some elements of the government-led approach have begun to emerge in East Asia, with govern-\nment-owned  asset  management  companies  in  Indonesia,  Korea,  and  Malaysia.  But  these  asset  management\ncompanies  have  not  yet  begun  to  function  effectively.\n\n52The  magnitude  of  the  surplus  was  lower  for  Korea  and  figures  on  the  primary  balance  are  not\n\navailable  for  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines.\n\n53Broadly, the following have been proposed: (a) Close insolvent financial institutions and firms (Korea)\nand transfer assets to restructuring agencies (Indonesia, Korea, Thailand); (b) Recapitalize and merge others;\n(c) Use explicit public funds through the budget for bank restructuring; (d) Strengthen prudential regulations,\nloan classification and provisioning requirements and capital adequacy norms; (e) Liberalize foreign investment\nin  domestic  banks  (Indonesia,  Korea,  Thailand);  and  (f)  Restructure  domestic  and  external  corporate  debt\n(Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand). Quite understandably, these spill over into areas of competition policy and\ncorporate  governance,  such  as  the  following:  (a)  Liberalize  restrictive  marketing  arrangements  (Indonesia);\n(b)  Establish  competitive  procedures  for  privatization  of  government  assets  and  government  procurement\n(Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand); (c) Ban or limit use of public funds to bail out private corporations (Indonesia,\nKorea,  Malaysia,  Thailand);  (d)  Implement  bankruptcy  laws  and  exit  policies  (Indonesia,  Korea,  Thailand);\n(e) Privatize and close nonviable public enterprises (Indonesia); (f) Enforce stronger corporate disclosure stan-\ndards (Korea); and (g) Liberalize foreign direct investment policies in nonfinancial sector areas. On trade policy,\nmost of East Asia was already fairly open. There are therefore limited suggestions about reducing import duties\nand export taxes (Indonesia) and easing quantitative restrictions on imports and exports (Indonesia and Korea).\nThe suggestions mentioned above concern domestic economies. In addition, there have been discussions\nabout the future architecture of the international financial system and some debate about capital account con-\nvertibility  and  controls  (or  taxes)  on  short-term  cross-border  capital  movements.  On  the  global  financial\narchitecture, the thrust of the argument is for improvement in dissemination of information based on greater\navailability,  transparency,  and  monitoring  based  on  acceptable  international  standards.\n\n\f19\n\nissues are strengthening of national financial systems and managing international financial\ncrises (Corsetti and Srinivasan 1999). The efficiency gains from capital account convertibility\nneed not be repeated, although the apparent benefits (as opposed to current account con-\nvertibility) have been questioned in studies like Rodrik (1998), or even by Bhagwati (1998).\nThat apart, capital account convertibility also reduces the scope for discretionary monetary\nand fiscal policy at home. The flip side is the kind of argument advanced in Bhagwati (1998)\nthat the case for free trade in goods cannot necessarily be extrapolated to free financial flows,\nsince there are several distortions, informational asymmetries being one. There are two kinds\nof arguments one encounters. First, the obvious proposition is that throwing open the capital\naccount without internal systemic reform is asking for trouble. Second, the proposition that\nthere is a difference between short-term capital movements and other forms of cross-bor-\nder capital flows lends validity to the suggestion for imposing a Tobin (1978) type tax, or\nthe  Chilean  variant  for  handling  short-term  debt  or  portfolio  investments.\n\nV. Conclusion:\nIs  the Asian  Model  of  Development  Still  Relevant?\n\nOne of the perhaps inadvertent and rather peculiar fallouts has been that both the\n\u201cradical  free  marketeers\u201d  and  the  supporters  of  the  \u201cactive  state  intervention  and  indus-\ntrial policy proponents\u201d have been left looking a bit embarrassed. The former because the\nstar followers of the free and open policies have suffered the most in these crisis; the lat-\nter  on  account  of  Korea  and  Japan  having  come  a  cropper.  There  has  been  an  attempt  to\nargue that these crises have shown the inherent weaknesses of the Asian model of devel-\nopment. The model\u2019s central features include a close cooperation between the state, financial\nsector, and the corporations, which was said to have reduced financial costs and made eco-\nnomic agents less risk-averse and encouraged them to plan for longer-term goals. It is argued\nin some quarters that this fostered weak governance, all kinds of corruption, and has been\none of the main causes of the problems faced in the banking sector of all these economies.\nThere  has  been  stringent  criticism  of  government  intervention  in  the  capital  markets  as\nhaving  resulted  in  connected  lending  and  overlending,  erosion  of  prudential  norms,  and\nperversion  of  the  credit  appraisal  process.  In  our  view  this  criticism  is  only  partly  valid.\nIt should not be used to take away from the central argument that the Asian crisis essen-\ntially  represented  a  case  of  market  failure  rather  than  government  failure.\n\nOf  the  various  forms  of  state  intervention,  state  intervention  in  capital  markets  is\nof  special  interest  because  market  imperfections  can  be  significant  there,  a  point  that  has\nbeen made in Stiglitz (1993, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 1998d). Because of pervasive market im-\nperfections in capital markets, state intervention in capital markets can make these markets\nas well as the economy perform better (Stiglitz 1993). Within capital markets, the East Asian\nstate promoted savings (postal savings banks), ensured long-term credit (development banks),\nand  developed  the  financial  infrastructure  (bond  and  equity  markets).  There  was  also  fi-\nnancial  restraint  or  financial  repression  and  theoretical  arguments  that  financial  restraint\nleads to inefficient allocation, or empirical surveys linking financial repression to economic\nperformance are both suspect (Stiglitz 1993 and Stiglitz and Uy 1996). In addition to financial\nrestraint, in East Asia priority industries were given preferential access to capital (and foreign\nexchange).  There  were  also  subsidized  interest  rates,  although  access  to  credit  may  have\n\n\f20\n\nbeen more important than the price aspect.54 Note also the budgetary surpluses East Asian\ngovernments  maintained.  Since  governments  did  not  borrow,  there  was  no  market  for\ngovernment securities. There was therefore no risk-free rate that could be used as a bench-\nmark, and a market for corporate bonds did not develop. Not only did governments not\nborrow, neither did households. This also biased the system toward high debt/equity ra-\ntios. In addition to the risk-free rate, the interest rate reflects a risk premium. Apart from\ndeepening and broadening the financial market to pool risk and bring down the premium,\nstate intervention sought to bring down the risk premium through various means. Reduced\nprovisions for bankruptcy; bank holding of equity in firms, and close links between banks,\nfirms,  and  the  government  are  examples.  High  leveraging  and  the  so-called  \u201ccrony  capi-\ntalism\u201d  were  thus  part  of  the  strategy.\n\nThis is an argument that is developed strongly in Wade (1998), Wade and Veneroso\n(1998),  and  Stiglitz  (1998a),  making  the  point  that  the Anglo-American  mindset  failed  to\nappreciate  the  role  of  state  intervention  in  financial  markets  and  failed  to  differentiate\nbetween  inadequate  oversight  and  over-regulation.55  The  state  did  not  misdirect  credit;\nmisdirection of credit was done by the private sector and was an instance of market fail-\nure, which the state failed to identify as a problem sufficiently early. Almost tautologically,\nhigh debt-equity ratios make the system more vulnerable to exogenous shocks, since costs\nof debt amount to fixed levels of payment, unlike equity costs. Therefore, a linkage between\nbanks, the state and the corporate sector is necessary to reduce systemic risks, as opposed\nto bailing out firms for inappropriate judgment. The role of the state and a close working\nrelationship among the different segments of socioeconomic agents is further reinforced if\nour  explanation  of  the Asian  crisis  being  different  from  all  previous  recent  episodes  is\naccepted. This difference we have argued lies in this current crisis being a case of market\nfailure  rather  than  policy  failure  and  the  structural  reform  efforts  consequentially  being\ndirected to improving firms\u2019 competitiveness. The role of the state in addressing the problems\nin  the  financial,  essentially  banking  sector,  has  been  discussed  at  length  in  the  previous\nsection. Other than that, government attention and perhaps resources, in the initial stages\nat least, will also have to be directed at: (i) facilitating technological upgradation of the firms;\n(ii) overhauling of the education and vocational training system so as to increase the supply\nof skills that can absorb and adopt the higher levels of technologies; and (iii) creating a sys-\ntem  of  social  security  nets  that  will  minimize  the  social  costs  of  any  future  cyclical\ndownswings and exogenous shocks.\n\nIn  the  end  some  useful  lessons  can  be  drawn  from  the  above  discussion  of  an  al-\nternate and a firm-based analysis of the East Asian crisis. First, some East Asian economies\nfunctioned as economies with abundant factor endowments of capital not labor. With capital\ninputs characterized by lumpiness of investments, it means cycles of overcapacity. During\nsuch periods of overcapacity, the withdrawal of government support and a credit squeeze\non working capital can be disastrous. This has to be avoided. Second, a shift in policy re-\ngimes can only be worked out gradually and sequentially so as not to create a divergence\nbetween expectations and realities. These sudden policy shifts often result from externally\nimposed conditionalities that can lead to unnecessary social stress and welfare loss. Third,\n\n54There were restrictions on consumer credit and low interest rates transferred income from households\n\nto  firms.\n\n55Unlike  Latin America,  the  East Asian  debt  was  mostly  private.\n\n\f21\n\nthe Asian crisis shows that we should change our tendency to look for explanatory factors\nfor the crisis in macro conditions specially now when all developing, emerging, and transition\neconomies  know  the  importance  of  following  the  right  macro  policies.  Shifting  the  focus\nto the \u201creal sectors\u201d may permit more timely and appropriate action, thereby reducing overall\nwelfare loss. Fourth, the East Asian crisis does not simply reflect a governance crisis or that\nof so-called crony capitalism. As discussed in the third section, the firm behavior and the\nconcomitant government and commercial bank support was the basis for sustained and un-\nprecedented growth in these economies. Although some strengthening of financial sector\nregulation,  monitoring,  and  supervisory  capability  is  certainly  called  for,  it  is  simply  ex-\npedient  and  perhaps  counterproductive  to  characterize  the  crisis  as  resulting  from  poor\ncorporate and financial sector governance. Let us not forget that until July 1997, the same\nunderlying model was being studied across universities and in research departments of most\nfinancial institutions for its relevance to not only developing but also developed economies.\nFifth and finally, one of the most important objectives of government policy in the\nnear future will also be to ensure that the cooperation between the state and other segments\nof  the  economy  is  increasingly  transparent  and  accountable.  In  short,  strengthening  the\nsystem of governance will remain one of the important priorities of public policy, but not\nthe only one. The transaction costs of a weak governance system are difficult to quantify,\nbut the costs of lack of financial resources to the firms and their inability to achieve high\nrates of growth are easily quantified as slower or negative economic growth and increas-\ning social distress. The Asian model of development with strengthened governance systems\ncould provide the most effective means of taking Asia back on a high and sustained growth\npath.  Public  intervention  is  warranted  to  address  market  failure.\n\n\f22\n\nTechnical Appendix\n\nMC\n\nAC\n\nAC1\n\nP\n\nP1\n\nS\n\nO\n\nQ1\n\nMR1\n\nQ\n\nMR\n\nAR1\n\nAR\n\nAt the firm level, the framework we envision is the following. AR is the average revenue curve and\nMR is the marginal revenue curve.1 MC is the marginal cost curve. A profit maximizing firm chooses an\noutput level OQ determined by point S, with a price corresponding to OP. If the average cost curve is AC,\nsuch a firm can be intramarginal, with zero profits. Through state intervention in the form of incentives\n(subsidies), the average cost curve can be driven down to AC\u2019. For simplicity, the MC curve is assumed to\nremain  unchanged  in  the  diagram,  but  this  is  purely  an  artifice.  The  subsidy  is  a  \u201cfixed  cost\u201d  type  of\nsubsidy, meaning the firm is no longer intramarginal. However, if there is a downward parametric shift in\ndemand (AR\u2019 and MR\u2019), despite the subsidy, the firm can once again become intramarginal. Note that in\nthis  diagram,  when  the  behavior  of  other  firms  is  not  considered2,  a  Baumol-type  revenue-maximizing\nfirm will have a higher level of output than OQ (when the demand curve is AR) and a firm that ought not\nto  be  intramarginal  can  end  up  with  zero  or  negative  profits.  However,  this  is  no  longer  the  case  if  the\nmarket structure is that of an oligopoly.\n\nWe now represent strands of the argument through the following stylized examples.\n\nThe Basic Structure\n\nTo bring in oligopoly, we postulate a market demand curve given as p = a - bq, p being the price and q\nthe aggregate output. If there are n firms (j=1,\u2026n), q = \u03a3 qj. The cost function for the jth firm is Cj = cj qj, cj\nbeing the marginal cost and there being no fixed costs. There are thus differential cost structures across\nfirms. Profits for the jth firm are \u03a0\n\nj = (a \u2013 bq) qj  - cj qj = (a \u2013 bq - cj ) qj .\n\nWe now think of two producers, a domestic one (subscripted 1) and a foreign one (subscripted 2) and\nexamine the noncooperative equilibrium. There is no product differentiation and the domestic and foreign\nproducts are perfect substitutes for each other in the global market.\n\n1Therefore, one is not working in a perfectly competitive framework. Nor is the firm a monopolist.\n2For example, when the firm is a monopolist.\n\n\f23\n\nWhen both producers are profit maximizers, on solving the equations for profit maximization, we\nobtain the following: q1 = (a \u2013 2c1 + c2)/3b, q2 = (a + c1 - 2c2)/3b, q = (2a \u2013 (c1 + c2))/3b, P1 = (a \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9b.3\np = (a + c1 + c2)/3.\n\nNote that q1 > q2 as c2 > c1 . As long as the marginal costs of the domestic producer are lower than\nthose of the foreign producer, the domestic producer will have a more than 50 percent share of the market.\nIn the special case when cost functions are identical, q1 = q2 = (a \u2013c)/3b and both producers have an equal\nmarket share. P1 = (a \u2013c)2 / 9b.\n\nWe  can  now  introduce  a  subsidy  or  incentive  to  the  domestic  producer  (without  a  corresponding\nsubsidy  to  the  foreign  producer).  This  subsidy  can  either  be  lump  sum  (K),  or  one  that  is  a  function  of\noutput (t), the former being identified with generalized liberalization and the latter being identified with\nsector-specific treatment. When the incentive (t) is a function of output, it effectively amounts to artificially\nbringing down c1 since marginal costs become (c1 \u2013 t). If t is large enough and actually equal to c1, there is\nno difference between profit maximization and revenue maximization. Any such t reduces the difference\nbetween revenue maximization and profit maximization. The implications are obvious: q1 goes up (greater\ninvestments in capacity), q2 goes down, the domestic producer\u2019s market share goes up and so do profits.\nAggregate output goes up and the price declines (terms of trade effect). When the subsidy is lump sum,\nnothing changes except the domestic producer\u2019s profits. These now become  P1 = (a \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9b + K.\n\nIf the domestic producer is a revenue maximizer (in the absence of incentives) and the foreign pro-\nducer is a profit maximizer, in solving the equations, we obtain the following: q1 = (a + c2)/3b, q2 = (a - 2c2)/\n3b, q = (2a -c2)/3b, P1 = (a \u2013 3c1 + c2)(a + c2)/9b . p = (a + c2)/3. Compared to profit maximization, one gets the\nintuitive result that as q1 goes up (greater investments in capacity), q2 goes down and the domestic producer\u2019s\nmarket  share  increases.  Overall  output  goes  up  and  the  price  declines  (terms  of  trade  effect).  If  one  ex-\ntrapolates on the basis of a monopoly, one also gets a result that is not intuitive. Compared to profit maxi-\nmization, P1 does not necessarily go down as a result of revenue maximization. Simplifying the results,\nrevenue maximization leads to lower profits than profit maximization only if 4c1 > (a + c2). If the inequality\nis  reversed,  somewhat  paradoxically,  revenue  maximization  leads  to  higher  profits.  Consider  a  scenario\nwhere marginal costs change over time, with c1 going up (higher labor costs) and c2 coming down as other\ncountries  \u201ccatch  up\u201d.  It  is  then  possible  that  revenue  maximization  leads  to  higher  profits  initially,  and\nlower profits beyond a certain point in time.\n\nIf there is a subsidy with revenue maximization, nothing changes, except that the domestic producer\nobtains larger profits. This is regardless of whether the subsidy is specific or lump sum. In the process, it is\npossible to delay the reduced profits that revenue maximization may lead to eventually.\n\nEither profit maximization (with an output-specific subsidy) or revenue maximization can thus lead\nto higher levels of output, expansion in capacity, larger market shares, and deterioration in terms of trade.\nDepending on what is happening to marginal costs, revenue maximization can lead to higher profits than\nprofit maximization initially, but lower profits thereafter.\n\nMultiple Products or Markets\n\nLet us now think of two products the domestic producer can produce, X and Y. These can be inter-\npreted either as two products or two different markets. For example, the same product may be sold to an\nold market X or a new market Y. Alternatively, an old product X or a new product Y may be sold to the\nsame  market.  In  general,  one  can  have  combinations  of  old  and  new  products  and  markets.  There  is  a\nforeign producer (subscripted 2) who competes in X and there is a foreign producer (subscripted 3) who\ncompetes in Y. There is of course nothing to prevent 2 and 3 from being identical. For profit maximization,\nthe following needs no explanation.\n\n3In this instance, the profit of the second producer can be obtained by symmetry. But throughout, we will only be interested\nin the profits of the domestic producer. When the number of firms increases, there will be a profit squeeze. But that is not an aspect\nwe wish to focus on.\n\n\f24\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nY\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX \u2013 t1\n\nY + c3)/3.\n\nY = (aY \u2013 2c1\n\nX = (aX \u2013 2c1\n\nX = (aX \u2013 2c1\n\nX = (aX \u2013 2(c1\n\nX  = (aX  \u2013  2(c1\n\nY + c3)/3bY, q2 = (aY + c1\n\nX + c2)/3bX, q2 = (aX + c1\n\nX - 2c2)/3bX, qX = (2aX \u2013 (c1\n\nX = (aX \u2013 2c1\n + c3))/\n\n + c2))/3bX, \u03a0\nY - 2c3)/3bY, qY = (2aY \u2013 (c1\n\nX) + c2)2/9bX  and profits from Y are \u03a0\n\nX + c2)/3 and q1\nY + c3)2/9bY , pY = (aY + c1\n\nY) + c3)2/9bY. With a lump sum incentive (K) that is uniform for both X and Y, profits from X are \u03a0\nX + c2)2/9bX  + K and profits from Y are \u03a0\nY = (aY \u2013 2c1\n\nWe have q1\n+ c2)2/9bX , pX = (aX + c1\n3bY, \u03a0\nY = (aY \u2013 2c1\n1\nWe now move from a regime of output-specific incentives to generalized incentives. With an output-\nspecific incentive, profits from X are \u03a0\nY = (aY \u2013 2(c1\nY\nX = (aX\n\u2013 t1\n1\nY+ c3)2/9bY + K. Assume that the transition from\n\u2013 2c1\nX + c2)2/\noutput-specific incentives to lump sum incentives is incentive-neutral for X, so that  P1\n9bX   +  K  is  greater  than  P1\nX)  +  c2)2/9bX.  The  producer  does  not  lose  as  a  result  of  the\nX  \u2013  t1\ntransition. Does this necessarily imply that the transition is also incentive-neutral for Y?  Clearly not. There\nY + c3)2/9bY  + K is greater than \u03a0\nis no way to establish that \u03a0\nY) + c3)2/9bY.\nConsider a simple instance of this general framework. The same product is exported to two markets\nX and Y, so the marginal costs are identical for X and Y. The initial output incentive is such that it com-\npletely neutralizes marginal costs, c1 is equal to t. Since it is the same product, the foreign producer is the\nsame in both markets. Given these conditions, with incentive neutrality in X we have, (aX \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9bX  +\nK is greater than (aX + c2)2/9bX. This reduces to K > 4c1 (aX \u2013 c1 + c2)/9bX. For similar incentive neutrality in\nY, this must guarantee K > 4c1 (aY \u2013 c1 + c2)/9bY. It is evident that this is not necessarily the case. The answer\ndepends on the demand functions for X and Y. Since X is a developed market, aX is presumably greater\nthan aY, the demand curve for X is \u201coutside\u201d the demand curve for Y. If the slopes of the demand curves are\nidentical, incentive neutrality for X then guarantees incentive neutrality for Y. But the demand curves need\nnot have the same slopes. If the demand curve for X is steeper (greater product differentiation and rela-\ntively inelastic demand curve) and the demand curve for Y is flatter (reduced product differentiation and\nrelatively elastic demand curve), then incentive neutrality for X does not guarantee incentive neutrality for\nY. In the transition from specific to generalized incentives, incentive neutrality may not have been ensured\nfor  newer  products  that  face  greater  competition  and  have  elastic  demand  curves.  This  hinders  export\ndiversification.\n\nY = (aY \u2013 2(c1\n\nY = (aY \u2013 2c1\n\nY \u2013 t1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIncentive Transition\n\nConsider now a transition from specific incentives to generalized incentives with three possible sce-\nnarios: first, a system with no specific incentives and a lump sum incentive of K; second, a system where\nthe specific incentive is 0.5c1; and third, a system where the specific incentive is c1. From what has been\nsaid earlier, with a profit-maximizing domestic producer, the following table needs no explanation.\n\nq1\nq2\nQ\n\nP\n\u03a0\n\n1\n\nK, t=0\n\nK=0, t=0.5c1K=0, t=c1\n\n(a \u2013 2c1 + c2)/3b\n(a + c1 - 2c2)/3b\n(2a \u2013 (c1 + c2))/3b\n(a + c1 + c2)/3\n(a \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9b + K\n\n(a \u2013 c1 + c2)/3b(a + c2)/3b\n(2a + c1 - 4c2)/6b(a \u2013 2c2)/3b\n(4a \u2013 (c1 + 2c2))/6b(2a \u2013 c2)/3b\n(2a + c1 + 2c2)/6(a + c2)/3\n(a \u2013 c1 + c2)2/9b(a + c2)2/9b\n\n\f25\n\nThe problem becomes interesting because there is uncertainty in the system. The incentive regime can\nbe any of the three above, but the domestic producer does not know which one of these it is going to be. For\nsimplicity\u2019s sake, let us presume the foreign producer has perfect knowledge. In the following table, the\nrows represent the choice of the producer, while the columns represent the actual incentive regime. The\nnorth-west to south-east diagonal elements are the familiar ones. But the entries in the other cells have to\nbe worked out as the producer has made a \u201cwrong\u201d output decision.\n\n\u03a0\n\n1  values\n\nK, t=0\n\nK=0, t=0.5c1\n\nK=0, t=c1\n\nK, t=0\nK=0, t=0.5c1\nK=0, t=c1\n\n(a \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9b + K\n(a-c1+c2)(2a-5c1+2c2)/18b + K\n(a+c2)(a-3c1+c2)/9b +K\n\n(a-2c1+c2)(2a-c1+2c2)/18b *\n(a \u2013 c1 + c2)2/9b\n(a+c2)(2a-3c1+2c2)/18b\n\n(a-2c1+c2)(a+c1+c2)/9b\n(a-c1+c2)(2a+c1+2c2)/18b\n(a + c2)2/9b **\n\nIt is impossible to determine maximin and maximax values without setting bounds on K. The deduc-\ntion is simplest when K is within the bounds q1c1 > K > (q1c1)/2, q1 being the actual level of output produced\nby the domestic producer. The maximax value is indicated by ** and the maximin value is indicated by *.4\nA risk-averse domestic producer will choose the maximin value and assume that a specific incentive does\nnot  exist.  Instead,  there  is  a  generalized  or  lump  sum  incentive.  But  if  there  is  no  particular  reason  to\nassume that this is a zero sum game and if the systemic environment has encouraged risk-loving behavior,\nthe maximax value will be chosen. The domestic producer\u2019s behavior is then predicated on the assump-\ntion that a full specific incentive exists.\n\nParametric Shift in Demand\n\nLet  us  now  consider  a  parametric  shift  in  demand.  Given  the  demand  function  p  =  a-  bq,  such  a\nparametric shift can be either in a or in b. We consider a parametric shift in a, an analogous deduction is\npossible for changes in b. The parametric shift in demand results in a getting transformed to la. If \u03bb > 1, the\ndemand curve shifts outward. If \u03bb < 1, the demand curve shifts inward and if  \u03bb =1, the demand curve is\nunchanged.  For  purposes  of  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  foreign  producer  does  not  expect  a  shift  in\ndemand and therefore, q2 is fixed at (a+c1-2c2)/3b. It is obvious that a profit-maximizing domestic producer\nwill now choose an output level given as (a \u2013 2c1 + c2)/3b + (\u03bb - 1)a/2b. If \u03bb > 1, domestic and aggregate\noutput is increased. If \u03bb < 1, domestic and aggregate output is decreased and if  \u03bb =1, domestic and aggre-\ngate output is unchanged. At such a level of generality it is impossible to be more specific. Therefore, let us\nconsider three special cases with \u03bb =2,  \u03bb =1 and \u03bb =1/2.\n\nThe following table needs no explanation.\n\n\u03bb = 2\n\n\u03bb = 1\n\n\u03bb = \u00bd\n\nq1\nq2\nQ\nP\n\n(5a \u2013 4c1 + 2c2)/6b\n(a + c1 - 2c2)/3b\n(7a \u2013 2c1 - 2c2)/6b\n(5a + 2c1 + 2c2)/6\n\n(a \u2013 2c1 + c2)/3b\n(a + c1 - 2c2)/3b\n(2a \u2013 (c1 + c2))/3b\n(a + c1 + c2)/3\n\n(a \u2013 8 c1 +4 c2)/12b\n(a + c1 \u2013 2c2)/3b\n(5a \u2013 4 c1 \u2013 4 c2)/12b\n(a + 4c1 + 4c2 )/12\n\n4Technically, this maximin value is subject to the condition that a+c2>c1. This is acceptable, as without this condition being\n\nsatisfied, the domestic producer's profits will be negative.\n\n\f26\n\nWhen \u03bb = 2, output expands. But p also increases because of the shift in the demand curve, a reverse\nterms of trade effect. Similarly, when \u03bb = \u00bd, output contracts and p declines. As in the preceding example,\nwe introduce uncertainty into the system with the requirement that the domestic producer does not know\nthe value of \u03bb. The incentive parametric shift in demand can be any of the three, but the domestic producer\ndoes not know which one of these it is going to be. In the following table, the rows represent the assump-\ntion of the producer, while the columns represent the actual state of demand.\n\n\u03a0\n\n1  values\n\n\u03bb = 2\n\n\u03bb = 1\n\n\u03bb = \u00bd\n\n\u03bb = 2\n\u03bb = 1\n\u03bb = \u00bd\n\n(5a \u2013 4c1 +2c2)2/36b **\n(a-2c1+c2)(4a-2c1+c2)/9b5\n(a-8c1+4c2)(19a-8c1+4c2)/144b\n\n(5a-4c1+2c2)(-a-4c1+2c2)/36b\n(a \u2013 2c1 + c2)2/9b\n(a- 8c1 +4c2)(7a-8c1+4c2) /144b\n\n(5a-4c1+2c2)(-2a-2c1+c2)/18b\n(a-2c1+c2)(-a-4c1+2c2)/18b\n(a \u20138c1 + 4c2)2/144b *\n\nThe maximax value is indicated by ** and the maximin value is indicated by *. A risk-averse domestic\nproducer will choose the maximin value and assume that there will be a downward parametric shift in\ndemand. But if there is no particular reason to assume that this is a zero sum game and if the systemic\nenvironment  has  encouraged  risk-loving  behavior,  the  maximax  value  will  be  chosen.  The  domestic\nproducer\u2019s behavior is then predicated on the assumption that there will be an expansion in demand. The\ngap between the maximax and maximin values varies positively with a and c2 and inversely with c1 and b.\nIn that sense, the premium on risk taking is higher if the foreign marginal cost is high or if the domestic\nmarginal cost is low. But if foreign marginal costs decline or if domestic marginal costs rise, the premium\non risk taking goes down.\n\nThe producer can of course be a revenue maximizer rather than a profit maximizer. It is easily checked\nthat even in that case, a risk-averse domestic producer will assume a contraction in demand (with a payoff\nof (a + 4c2)2/144b) and a risk-loving domestic producer will assume an expansion in demand (with a payoff\nof  (5a + 2c2)2/36b). In this case, the premium on risk varies positively with a and c2 and inversely with b.\n\nK and L Inputs\n\nTo develop a capital market argument, let us now visualize two inputs, capital (K) and labor (L). As\nbefore, the domestic producer is subscripted 1. With profit-maximizing behavior on the part of the domes-\ntic producer, we have the following conditions on L1 and K1:\n\nP(1- 1/e)dq1/dL1 = w1(1+1/eL) and P(1-1/e)dq1/dK1 = k1(1+1/eK), where e is the elasticity of market\ndemand, w1 is the wage rate, k1 is the price of capital, eL is the elasticity of  wages with respect to labor\ninput, and eK is the elasticity of the price of capital with respect to capital input.\n\nLet  us  now  assume  perfect  competition  in  product  and  factor  markets.  With  increasing  returns  to\nscale,  it  is  possible  to  pay  labor  wages  that  are  greater  than  the  value  of  the  marginal  product  of  labor,\nwithout paying capital at a price lower than the value of the marginal product of capital. However, if there\nare nonincreasing returns to scale, this is no longer possible. In such circumstances, state intervention can\nlead to a price of capital that is lower than the value of the marginal product. With revenue-maximizing\nbehavior, the labor input will be up to the point where the marginal product of labor is zero.\n\nHowever,  perfect  competition  in  product  and  factor  markets  is  not  a  plausible  assumption.  With\nimperfect competition, the link between say, wages and value of marginal product of labor, breaks down.\nHowever,  even  if  there  is  imperfect  competition  in  product  markets  (with  perfect  competition  in  factor\nmarkets), we still have \u03b4q1/\u03b4L1/\u03b4q1/\u03b4K1 = w1/k1 . The point is a simple one. Assume that conditions in the\nforeign country do not change, but there is an increase in wages relative to the marginal product of labor in\n\n5This cell's payoff is interesting because depending on demand conditions, it shows that the payoff from being wrong can\n\nsometimes be greater than the payoff from being right.\n\n\f27\n\nthe home country. This requires exogenous changes in the price of capital,6 or increases in K1. Consider\ninvestment given by the expression \u2206K1/K1. This is a direct function of the rate of profit or \u03a0\n1/k1K1. Capital\ninput increases can contribute to a fall in the rate of profit because of diminishing returns to capital input.\nThese effects are accentuated if the domestic producer maximizes revenue rather than profit. As the rate of\nprofit declines, it may become difficult to finance investment through equity. However investments can\nalso be driven by borrowing and \u2206K1/K1 is also an inverse function of the rate of interest, r1.7 Thus inter-\npreted, capital market distortions through reductions in the rate of interest to below equilibrium levels are\nnot inadvertent distortions, but the only way to sustain competitive advantage. These arguments also hold\nif  there  are  imperfections  in  factor  markets,  with  the  caveat  being  the  relevant  elasticities  become  addi-\ntional variables.\n\n6Exogenous because of perfect competition in factor markets. TFP increases is another possibility to neutralize wage increases.\n7Had intermediation possibilities not existed, retained earnings would have been the only option.\n\n\f28\n\nBibliography\n\nAsian  Development  Bank,  1997.
