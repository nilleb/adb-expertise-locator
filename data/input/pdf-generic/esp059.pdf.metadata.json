The actual\ncauses lie deeper in the operation of the real, that is, the corporate sector.\nIn this context, the paper analyzes the micro behavior of individual firms.\nRisk-loving behavior of revenue-maximizing firms, engendered by the\npolicy environment and the working of the financial sector, leads domestic\nproducers to expect a continuation of specific incentives and expansions\nin demand. Capacity expansion and capital increases, tools used for di-\nversification and grabbing larger market shares, are financed by raising\ndebt, resulting in high gearing ratios and making firms critically depen-\ndent on unimpeded cash flow and availability of credit. Against this micro\nbackground, the paper argues that the handling of the crisis was inap-\npropriate. Since the financial sector often exhibits characteristics of a public\ngood, the paper argues for immediate recapitalization of banks through\nstate intervention that rapidly restores credit availability. This strategy,\nwhich is fiscally viable, will revive credit to the real sector and revive\ngrowth.", "1\nI. Introduction\nPopular sentiment in much of East Asia ascribes the East Asian crisis1 to sudden and\ndestabilizing withdrawal of foreign capital.2 This is the \u201cpanic\u201d view, encompassing bank\nruns, \u201cfickle\u201d investors, and \u201chot money\u201d.3 The argument is that East Asia did not exhibit\ntraditional fundamental weaknesses associated with weak or \u201cwrong\u201d macroeconomic\npolicies that result in currency and financial instability. These countries were reportedly\nfollowing the \u201cright\u201d policies, hence, the East Asian miracle. Unlike the debt crisis of the\n1980s, macroeconomic indicators in East Asia were strong. For example, precrisis budget\ndeficits were low or nonexistent. Public debt and inflation rates were also low and invest-\nment, savings, and growth rates (of gross domestic product [GDP]) were high.4 In some\nsense, this is also an explanation as to why the crisis was not generally expected, and sub-\nsequent rationalizations amounted to post-facto arguments.5 There have also been theoretical\nattempts to model self-fulfilling speculative attacks, usually with game theoretic assumptions\nabout expectations.6 However, regardless of the model, \u201cweak\u201d fundamentals are necessary\nfor such self-fulfilling speculative attacks to occur.\nGiven the comment about conventional macroeconomic indicators, \u201cweak\u201d funda-\nmentals need to be reinterpreted. By and large, the argument in the literature now runs along\nthe following lines.7 Starting in 1996, current account deficits of East Asian countries began\n1The adjective \u201cAsian,\u201d as opposed to \u201cEast Asian\u201d or \u201cSoutheast Asian\u201d is used in the title of this\npaper, because in a geographical sense, neither East Asia nor Southeast Asia captures the geographical areas\naffected. Subsequently in the text, we revert to the more common expression, East Asia. However, the five\ncountries we have in mind are Indonesia, Republic of Korea (henceforth Korea), Malaysia, Philippines, and\nThailand. A currency or financial crisis can be interpreted as exhibiting capital outflows, depreciating cur-\nrencies, failing banks, fall in asset values, and loss of confidence as symptoms. The features have been well\ndocumented in a host of studies listed in this paper and elsewhere.\n2For Asian developing countries, net inflows on the capital account (as a share of host-country gross\ndomestic product (GDP) roughly doubled between 1984-1988 and 1989-1993 (see Khan and Reinhart 1995).\n3Corsetti and Srinivasan (1999) argue that unlike in the case of debates on the European Monetary\nSystem between 1992 and 1993 or Mexico at the end of 1994, the East Asian experience has reduced the di-\nchotomy between \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cfundamentalist\u201d views.\n4In 1996, GDP growth rates were 5.5% in Thailand, 8.0% in Indonesia, 8.6% in Malaysia, 5.7% in the\nPhilippines, and 7.1% in Korea. Gross domestic investment/GDP rates were respectively 41.7, 30.8, 41.5, 23.3,\nand 38.2 percent. Inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) were 5.9% in Thailand, 7.9%\nin Indonesia, 3.5% in Malaysia, and 8.4% and 4.9% in the Philippines and Korea respectively. The CPI may\nof course have underestimated inflation because of controlled prices in the case of some essential commodities\nand utilities. Finally, the central government budgetary surplus as a percentage of GDP was respectively 0.9,\n0.8, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.0 percent (ADB 1998).\n5Unlike the debt crisis of the 1980s, macroeconomic imbalances did not originate in public sector fiscal\ndeficits, which may partly explain the failure to predict the East Asian crisis. In the 1990s, public sector debt\nas a share of GDP declined in East Asia.\n6Apart from the discussion in Corsetti and Srinivasan (1999), see Obstfeld (1998).\n7See, for example, Chapter 2, \u201cResponding to the East Asian Crisis\u201d, in World Bank (1999). There is\na reason for using the adjective \u201cnow\u201d. For a while at least, there was an original IMF view that the crisis\nhad been caused by deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals in the conventional sense. But this has also\nnow converged to the mainstream diagnosis.", "2\nto rise. These current account deficits were sustained through short-term capital inflows in\nthe form of short-term private debt or portfolio investments, encouraged by differentials\nbetween local and global yields on debt and securities. Given stable exchange rates, external\ncapital inflows were often uncovered and uncollateralized. Coupled with weaknesses in the\nfinancial system8 and inability of the real sector to efficiently absorb capital flows, an\ninvestment bubble began to build up, in the form of low quality and speculative invest-\nments, often with assets of doubtful value as collateral.9 Perverse expectations and a change\nin capital market sentiment triggered a run on the currency, which then spread to other\ncurrencies through a contagion effect.10 Once the crisis set in, private investment and personal\nconsumption expenditure also contracted. A recovery based on exports was not possible\nbecause credit mechanisms broke down and export prices could not be adjusted to absorb\ngreatly increased import costs. Both fiscal and monetary policies implied tradeoffs that were\nunacceptable.\nAgainst this background, this paper revisits the causes of the East Asian crisis to\nexamine the possibility that if the diagnosis had been different, and the structural causes\nof the crisis that existed in the corporate sector had been identified, the handling of the crisis\nwould perhaps have been more effective and have caused less social distress. We also use\nthe analyses to suggest a different approach to the handling of banking sector reforms. The\napproach suggested is based on the understanding, derived in the paper, that along with\ngovernance weaknesses, the banking sector crisis also represents a case of market failure\nand therefore presents an ideal situation for public intervention. In this context, we take\nup the argument put forward in recent writings by Wade (1998) and attempt to provide\nan analytical framework for his \u201chigh debt model\u201d, extending the argument further by look-\ning at the future relevance of the Asian model of development. We conclude that the model,\nwhich is premised upon a close relationship between the corporate and the financial sec-\ntor and an active role from the government, remains valid but can be effectively used only\nwhen some of the governance aspects are suitably strengthened. The structure of the pa-\nper is as follows. The second section is a brief review of the literature on the causes of the\ncrisis. This is done under five major heads: the current account deficit, short-term debt, the\nfinancial sector, exogenous factors, and efficiency-type arguments. These are macro argu-\nments that do not attempt to examine the structural factors in the real sectors that could\nhave contributed to, or may indeed have been at the root of the crisis. Therefore, in the third\nsection, we examine firm behavior in an attempt to provide an alternative explanation as\nto why the crisis happened. The fourth section is devoted to governance type issues, with\na focus on public governance rather than on corporate governance. It has a micro focus,\nflowing from the discussion in the third section and can be viewed as an alternative and\nbetter way of handling the crisis. There is thus an attempt to highlight the analytical base\nof the Asian model of development and argue for its continued relevance for the region\u2019s\nfuture growth. Finally, the fifth section is in the nature of a conclusion.\n8The argument is that integration into global financial markets had not been backed up by domes-\ntic regulatory institutions as a prerequisite with usual associated problems of moral hazard and adverse\nselection.\n9Competition in the banking sector prevents deposit rates from dropping and lending rates from\nincreasing, thus squeezing the spreads of banks. Spreads can only be maintained by lending to high-risk bor-\nrowers, aided by moral hazard-type problems.\n10One can factor in exogenous shocks like the Chinese devaluation (1994), or more recently the de-\nvaluation in Taipei,China in August 1997 or the recession in Japan.", "3\nII. Causes of the Crisis\nA. Current Account Deficit\nEconomists argue that the current account deficit, as a percentage of GDP, gives a\nfair idea of a country\u2019s balance of payments (BOP). As we know, the current account deficit\nis nothing but the difference between national savings and national investment and is thus\na manifestation of excess demand. This is important for two reasons. First, it has implications\nfor growth. Second, depending on what is happening to the capital account, it affects\nexchange rates and hence the competitiveness of an economy. With a higher current account\ndeficit, if, for a moment, one ignores the capital account, an economy that operates with\na fixed exchange rate runs into trouble as foreign fund managers start attacking (sell for-\nward) the \u201covervalued\u201d domestic currency.\nThe Summer-IMF hypothesis traces the root cause of the East Asian crisis on the\nfollowing simple hypothesis\u2014it happened because of large current account deficits in the\nregion. Large and persistent current account deficits tend to undermine the BOP position\nif any of the following happens: (a) Foreign loans are used for financing \u201cdud\u201d projects where\nthe productivity of investment is low relative to the costs of borrowing; (b) there is low\nexport diversification, which constrains the flow of foreign exchange earnings11; and\n(c) foreign capital inflows finance domestic consumption rather than investments.\nTaken in isolation, the current account deficit only offers an incomplete answer. The\ncrisis started in Thailand where the current account deficit has been high since 1990, when\nit was 8.5 percent of GDP. But there is no explanation why the crisis took place only in 1997\nand not earlier. The question therefore is, Does a high current account deficit necessarily\ntrigger a crisis? Surely the answer depends on how the current account deficit is financed,\nthat is, the composition of capital account inflows used to finance the deficit. Seen in this\nperspective and focusing only on the external sector, the crisis actually becomes a capital\naccount problem rather than a current account imbalance issue. Further, can a discussion\nof the current account deficit be delinked from the exchange rate regime? Stated differently,\nin principle a high current account deficit can trigger expectations about depreciation and\nlead to speculative attacks against a currency. But if current account deficits are not used\nto finance domestic consumption, there need not necessarily be any difficulties about ser-\nvicing future debt.12 The East Asian crisis was not a direct outcome of too much emphasis\non present consumption, as had happened in Mexico. Current account deficits in Mexico\nduring 1989-1994 were not accompanied by a commensurate increase in investments and\nwere used to boost domestic consumption. Unlike Mexico, in East Asia there was gener-\nally a fiscal surplus and high investment and saving rates.13 Domestic savings rates remained\nsubstantially higher than global averages. Since excess demand clearly reflected high levels\nof investment demand, the simple, current account based explanation for triggering the crisis\nbreaks down.\n11Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) showed that countries with lower export diversification are more prone\nto finance-related crises.\n12The problem can arise if external borrowing is invested in inefficient projects in the nontradable\nsectors that do not generate income streams to service the debt. This may have taken place in some of these\ncountries, but as referred to in the next paragraph, the ICORs told a different story. However, this is clearly\na case of market and not public policy failure.\n13In 1994, Mexico had a current account deficit to GDP ratio of 6.4% while Thailand had a deficit\nof 5.4 percent. However, the investment/GDP ratio was 23.2% in Mexico and 40.3% in Thailand.", "4\nIncidentally, if one leaves out Malaysia and Thailand, in the other three countries,\ncurrent account deficit/GDP ratios were not all that high.14 In addition, the incremental\ncapital/output ratios (ICOR)15, reflecting the productivity of investments, were low as\ncompared to Mexico. For Mexico the average ICOR during 1990-1994 was about 7, whereas\nfor Thailand the average ICOR during 1991-1995 was around 5.16 Therefore, despite post-\nfacto rationalizations, it cannot be argued that the condition of weak fundamentals as stated\nabove was satisfied. There is no evidence in a country like Thailand that in general, returns\non domestic capital formation were too low to repay foreign creditors. Additional productive\ncapacity was indeed converted into extra earnings in terms of foreign currency.17 All these\nreasons weaken the current account hypothesis as being the principal or even one of the\nmain factors causing the crisis.\nB. Short-term Debt\nHowever, the current account deficit can be linked not to total external debt, but short-\nterm debt (defined as debt shorter than one year in duration). Such debt accumulation\nbecame possible because of liberalization of the capital account.18 There was an increase\nin short-term debt owed by private financial institutions and nonfinancial corporations.\nAdmittedly, there were some cross-country variations in this. In Thailand and Republic of\nKorea (henceforth Korea), the borrowing was more by banks and nonbanking financial insti-\ntutions that performed the task of intermediation. In Indonesia, there was a lot of direct\nborrowing by nonfinancial institutions. Although data on short-term debt are at best\nimperfect, in Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand, the short-term debt to foreign exchange re-\nserves ratio was more than 100 percent in mid-1997 (World Bank Global Economic Prospects\n1998).19 Such short-term debt often creates mismatches between currency and maturity of\n14In Korea, it was below 3% till 1996, when it went up to 4.8 percent. In Indonesia, it was less than\n3.5% throughout. In the Philippines, it varied between 4.5 and 5.5 percent.\n15ICOR denotes additional capital required to produce an extra unit of output. Hence a lower ICOR\ngenerally reflects higher productivity of investments.\n16ICOR figures are from Rakshit (1997). However, it is also true that ICORs rose in the 1990s. This\ncould be due to diminishing returns to capital as well as deteriorating investment quality, typical during credit\nbooms.\n17There was no reason to believe that these countries would be unable to service external debt\nfrom export revenues. The debt service ratios (amortization and interest) as percentage of export (both goods and\nservices) revenue improved from the 1980s till 1996. In 1996 the debt service ratios were 11.5% for Thailand, 36.8%\nfor Indonesia, 5.9% for Malaysia, and 13.7% for the Philippines (Asian Development Bank 1997), the Korean\nfigure not being available. External debt was thus not a problem except for Indonesia, and even there, the\ndebt-service ratio had improved since the late 1980s, although it had deteriorated compared to the early 1980s.\n18In a country like Korea, there were controls on foreign direct investments, but controls on short-\nterm borrowing had been removed.\n19These three countries were the worst affected from the crisis. In contrast, the Philippines and\nMalaysia, with short-term exposures below 100%, were not that affected in relative terms. For all of East Asia\nas an indicative average, the ratio of short-term debt to reserves went up from 100% in June 1994 to 134%\nin June 1997. There is also the point that gross reserves were bad indicators of international liquidity, since\nthese were not necessarily usable reserves and liabilities existed. In Thailand, there were outstanding forward\ncontracts. And in Korea, reserves were lent to commercial banks through a special fund. In a background paper\nprepared for Michel Camdessus\u2019 presentation to the Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meeting (16 January 1999,\nFrankfurt), one has specific short-term debt figures for all five countries in 1996. They are the following:\nThailand\u2014total external debt of $90.5 billion, short-term debt of $37.6 billion; Malaysia\u2014total external debt\nof $38.7 billion, short-term debt of $9.7 billion; Indonesia\u2014total external debt of $130.2 billion, short-term debt\nof $28.0 billion; Philippines\u2014total external debt of $41.9 billion, short-term debt of $7.2 billion; Korea\u2014\ntotal external debt of $160.7 billion, short-term debt of $100.0 billion.", "5\nliabilities and assets.20 In principle, a liquidity problem is thus possible (see Radelet and\nSachs 1998). Yet another factor can be clubbed in. A high ratio of M2 money to reserves,\ncoupled with fixed exchange rates, can potentially lead to a run on reserves by residents\nbecause the residents are no longer sure of the future store of value function of their cur-\nrency holdings and realize that government reserves may not suffice for supporting the\ncurrency in circulation. This represents a loss of confidence in the government and its capacity\nto handle the economic situation.\nThe issue of short-term debt cannot be properly understood without making a ref-\nerence to monetary policy used to sterilize capital inflows, thus contributing to an increase\nin domestic interest rates. The increase in interest rates stimulated further capital inflows\nin a situation where global interest rates were dropping.21 More importantly, differentials\nbetween domestic and global interest rates created an incentive for foreign borrowing. Since\nexchange rates were stable (pegged to the dollar or pegged to baskets where the dollar had\na high weight), this borrowing was often unhedged.22 And since interest rates on short-term\nborrowing were lower than for long-term credit in line with the conventional yield curve,\nthere was a built-in incentive in favor of short-term debt.23 In an effort to lower borrow-\ning costs, banks and their corporate customers preferred loans in foreign currency and\nundertook most of their foreign borrowing in short maturities. The implicit understand-\ning was that these credits would always be rolled over as long as they were regularly\nserviced by corporate borrowers. Thus, in the upswing phase of the cycle, these represented\nlong-term credit at relatively cheaper interest rates. For instance, banks took recourse to short-\nterm, foreign-denominated borrowing in the interbank market to fund long-term bank loans.\nIn Indonesia, between January 1991 and June 1997, the nominal interest rate spread (local\ndeposit rate minus LIBOR rate) was 11.5 percent, with an average annual depreciation against\nthe US dollar of 3.8 percent (World Bank Global Economic Prospects 1998).24 Quite understand-\nably, the ratio of short-term foreign debt to equity ranged from 40 per cent in Indonesia\nto almost 100 percent in Korea.25 As a contributory cause to the crisis, the case is that there\n20If investor confidence turns perverse, it may become difficult to borrow again from international\ncapital markets to meet debt service obligations or roll over short-term debt.\n21Low American interest rates are especially relevant. Financial volatility was perceived to be lower\nfor East Asia than for Latin America. There is a positive correlation between prudent macroeconomic poli-\ncies and financial stability. Hausmann and Rojas-Suarez (1996) have shown that volatility of real exchange\nrate matters in the presence of high domestic inflation rates\u2014a direct offshoot of following imprudent monetary\npolicies. A study undertaken by BIS during 1996 arrived at the conclusion that greater financial volatility in\nemerging Latin American economies during the 1980s was because of higher rates of inflation and hence volatile\nreal exchange rates there. Higher inflation rates, by lowering real interest rates and values of bank assets, in-\ncrease volatility of domestic financial markets. The working principles of banks are characterized by borrowing\nshort and lending long. Deposits are redeemable at par, and depositors are assured of getting immediate access\nto liquidity, provided that not everyone tries to withdraw funds simultaneously. Volatility sharply alters the\nrelationship between value of bank assets and liabilities beyond the ex ante protection provided by bank capital,\nand hence increases vulnerability.\n22Other than virtually stable exchange rates, deposit insurance and government guarantees reduced\nsystemic risk further.\n23Paradoxically, with the benefit of hindsight, interest rates did not factor in expected exchange rate\ndepreciation.\n24Although not as sharp, there were similar interest rate spreads in the other countries as well,\nespecially in the Philippines and Thailand.\n25These figures are based on a database of 5,500 East Asian firms in nine countries (World Bank Global\nEconomic Prospects 1998).", "6\nwas state oversight in fully understanding the implications of high short-term private sector\ndebt. The complacency was on account of the private nature of the short-term debt. The\nassumption (proved wrong later) was that private borrowers would borrow only if they\ncould ensure that rates of return were high enough to service their debt.\nC. Fragility of the Financial Sector\nHigh short-term external debt by the corporate sector and high leveraging was only\none example of a broader issue of financial sector fragility. Banking history is replete with\nexamples of credit booms that led to speculative bubbles, aided by unwarranted optimism\nand mispricing of risk, especially with weak legal and supervisory structures. Between 1990\nand 1996, the ratio of bank lending to GDP grew by more than 50 percent in Thailand and\nthe Philippines. It grew by 27 percent in Malaysia and around 15 percent in Hong Kong,\nChina; Indonesia; Korea; and Singapore (Corsetti et al. 1998). While private credit to GDP\nratio increases as per capita income increases, the increases in East Asia were far higher than\nindicated by increases in per capita income alone (World Bank Global Economic Prospects 1998).\nA credit boom per se is not a problem, provided that investment decisions are sound and\nlenders retain confidence in that soundness. However, it is not always possible to screen\ngood borrowers from bad ones.26 In the process of handling the problem of asymmetric in-\nformation and separating good borrowers from bad ones, banks ration their credit. The\nimplicit assumption in this is that investors borrowing at \u201cbank optimal\u201d27 rates of inter-\nest are safe and are less likely to invest in dud projects. But this risk-averse behavior of banks\nbroke down in East Asia thanks to the presence of implicit deposit guarantees28 and stable\nexchange rates. This made credit risk extremely underpriced and led to problems of moral\nhazard, since there was little bank supervision and no penalty for managers.29 The prac-\ntice of commercial banks to use market values of real estate assets as collateral for loans\nalso contributed to the creation of the credit bubble. In the slightly longer run, as high-\nyielding projects got exhausted and excess supply emerged in the property sector, banks\nbegan to incur losses.30 In Indonesia, bad debt problems surfaced in the early 1990s and\nearlier, in the mid-1980s, both Malaysia and Thailand encountered banking crises (Caprio\nand Klingbiel 1996).\n26Information asymmetry becomes a more serious problem during credit booms (see Gavin and\nHausmann 1996).\n27The interest rate at which expected return to the bank is maximized (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981).\n28Expectations of a bailout are not necessarily based on government promises, they occur even if\ndeposits are not explicitly insured (see Diaz-Alejandro 1985). Balance sheets of financial companies often have\na public good character. Bank managers quickly recognize these externalities and take advantage of the situation\nof being either \u201ctoo big to be closed\u201d or having a near monopoly in financial intermediation due to the\nunderdevelopment of other financial sector agents.\n29If enterprise managers live in a Baumol kind of world and maximize revenue rather than profits,\noutput will be more than output in a profit-maximizing framework. Marginal costs do not enter such a\nmanager's calculations and output is produced as long as the marginal revenue is positive. Overleveraging\nis therefore almost axiomatic as firms try and produce larger volumes for capturing larger market shares,\nwithout generating sufficient investment surpluses internally. Banks can be made to function in a better way\nif those who benefited from risk-taking absorb most of the associated costs. A study conducted by Weisbrod\net al. (1992) on banks in emerging economies found that the franchise value (profitability of a banking licence)\nof banks have fallen over the years, compelling them to venture into more risky projects.\n30This implies that the costs of bailout become prohibitive and sooner or later, government guarantees\non deposits will no longer be implementable, thus triggering a crisis.", "7\nThe moral hazard problem manifested itself in two other ways as well\u2014corporate\nand international. At the corporate level, political pressures to maintain high rates of eco-\nnomic growth led to a tradition of public guarantees to private projects, some of which were\neffectively undertaken under government control, directly subsidized, or supported by\npolicies of directed credit to favored firms and industries (see IMF 1998). Even in the ab-\nsence of explicit promises of \u201cbail-out\u201d, underlying systemic risk was nonexistent. The\ninternational dimension of the moral hazard problem hinged upon the behavior of inter-\nnational banks, which during the period leading up to the crisis, lent large amounts of money\nto domestic intermediaries, neglecting their risk management capability (McKinnon and Pill\n1994). Banks, both domestic and international, could have become complacent in their credit\nappraisal as a result of the long and sustained economic growth in these countries, that made\nthoughts of a cyclical downswing look remote and unrealistic. Such an \u201cover lending\u201d\nsyndrome reflects classic \u201cmoral hazard\u201d as all those involved firmly believe that in the case\nof financial disaster, they will be bailed out either directly by the government, or through\nindirect IMF and/or other multilateral support. A large proportion of foreign debt accu-\nmulation took the form of bank-related short-term, unhedged, and foreign-currency-\ndenominated liabilities.\nAnother feature contributing to the fragility of the banking sector in these econo-\nmies was weak monitoring and supervising capabilities and practices of the central bank(s).\nIn those countries central banks did not enjoy autonomy in their twin roles of supervis-\ning commercial banks and maintaining monetary stability. In the absence of strong central\nbank supervision and enforcement of prudential norms, commercial banking and nonbanking\nfinancial companies have been characterized by\n(i) significant undercapitalization; widespread insider; connected or directed\nlending (Krugman 1994), weak credit appraisal and portfolio management\ncapacities;\n(ii) nonobservance of prudential norms; unsatisfactory asset classificiation\n(Folkerts-Landau et al. 1995); and\n(iii) inadequate loan loss provisions.\nFinancial sector liberalization (under considerable external pressure) comprising\ninterest rate deregulation and opening of the capital account magnified these weaknesses\nas banks were exposed to large capital inflows and more sophisticated practices of foreign\nbanks and financial agents. A financial sector crisis was precipitated when the fragile fi-\nnancial sector with all its weaknesses was exposed to an external shock in the form of export\nslowdown, decline in unit export prices, and steep hike in interest rates.\nBank efficiency also depends on the legal framework. Inadequate legal frameworks\nmake it difficult and time-consuming for banks to seize or transfer collateral behind de-\nlinquent loans. There are essentially three ways of dealing with insolvency, liquidation,31\n31Liquidation is a formal court-administered sale of most or all of the assets, usually in piecemeal\nfashion. At the end of the process, third parties become owners of the assets.", "8\nrescue,32 and work out.33 Whereas both liquidation and rescue are practiced in developed\ncountry markets, the general norm throughout Asia is work outs.34 The financial sector\nsuffered from the weak legal framework for debt recovery and calling in of collateral guar-\nantees in these countries. This weakness of the legal infrastructure increased the chances\nof bank failure as they could not successfully use the workout procedures for debt recovery.\nThe slowdown in export earnings and hike in interest rates, announced by central\nbanks to defend the currency, drove corporate borrowers and subsequently the bank them-\nselves into Ponzi game type situations.35 More good money was pushed after bad loans in\nthe hope of outlasting the cyclical downswing and avoiding a final writing-off of these bad\ndebts. Financial sector liberalization permitted this \u201cevergreening\u201d of loans by allowing banks\nto charge differential interest rates and giving them access to larger credit volumes that could\nbe used for keeping the loans on the books as performing assets. In hindsight, it is clear\nthat given the underlying weaknesses of the system, this liberal policy stance simply al-\nlowed the bubble to become even larger before it finally burst. Kaminsky and Reinhart (1995)\nnote that in 18 of 25 banking crises in their sample, the financial sector had been liberal-\nized during the preceding five years. There is a similar finding in Demirguc-Kunt and\nDetragiache (1998), with a cross-country sample of 53 countries during 1980 to 1995. How-\never, the likelihood of a crisis is lower when institutional environments are stronger. Hence,\nthe sequencing and pace of financial sector liberalization is important. Thus interpreted,\nthe financial sector problem can be described as one of sequencing of liberalization with-\nout strengthening financial systems and improving corporate governance.\nThe question remains, however, that not all of the financial sector assets were \u201cbad\nor high risk loans\u201d. But as the currency crisis became a full-blown financial crisis and banks\nsuffered from depositor runs, triggered in some cases by misplaced policy stance, even the\ngood and viable borrowers suffered from an acute credit crunch. This caused extensive dam-\nage to productive capacities, leading to large-scale bankruptcies and unemployment. The\ncurrency and financial crises were thus transformed into an economywide recession. The\nquestion is, How did the region\u2019s banking and financial sector, which had helped to finance\none of the longest episodes of sustained economic booms, suddenly suffer from all types\nof terminal illnesses arising from currency and maturity mismatches and mountains of\nnonperforming assets? The question would perhaps lead us to answer another question,\nCould the credit crunch have been prevented if the diagnosis had been correctly done and\nthe corporate sector issues distinguished from the \u201cspeculative boom in some asset markets?\u201d\nOn the other hand, as argued by some,36 the premise that the crisis was a result of current\n32A rescue is a formal court-administered rehabilitation, reorganization, or restructuring in an attempt\nto preserve the concern as an ongoing income-producing entity. The end result is that one or more creditors\nbecome in some way owners of the enterprise (e.g., debt/equity swaps).\n33Work out describes an informal process that does not involve court proceedings. The debtors re-\nmain in possession of the assets. Creditors accept either reduction or rescheduling of debts.\n34For example, in the absence of legal norms, both Indonesia and Malaysia completely rely on in-\nformal work out methods. Within the region, Singapore is an exception to this principle and Singapore amended\nits old law and modelled it in accordance with the UK Insolvency Act of 1985.\n35A Ponzi-game is a situation in which a firm must borrow to meet an increase in payments of\noutstanding debt. The additional borrowing, however, serves to increase firm debt load, worsening the fi-\nnancial position of the firm. The firm borrows to survive, but in doing so, makes its position more precarious.\n36The strongest votaries of this argument are Sachs and Radelet (see Sachs and Radelet 1998 and\nRadelet and Sachs 1998).", "9\naccount deficits and represented classic policy failure prevented a distinction between the\ndifferent sectors and issues underlying them. This could therefore be cited as a case of using\naggregate policy measures that resulted in greater than necessary social welfare loss.\nD. Exogenous Factors: Terms of Trade Shock and Slowdown in Exports\nSince much of the East Asian success story depended on export-led growth, it is\nunderstandable that any slowdown in international trade would affect these economies more\nthan relatively insulated ones. During 1996, there was a general slowdown in world trade,\naffecting export growth from this region. The East Asian economies suffered as their main\ntrading partners, Japan and Latin America, were badly affected by this recession. Japan also\nfaced problems due to an overvalued yen. Since East Asian currencies were tied to the US\ndollar, an appreciating yen meant rising import costs from Japan. While an overvalued yen\nhelped price-sensitive exports to Japan, there were adverse effects for import-intensive exports\nto other regions.\nThe initial years of trade surplus and high export growth had motivated many of\nthese economies to invest heavily in capacity augmentation in steel, semiconductors, elec-\ntronics, processing, and assembly industries.37 A global or regional recession thus meant\nexcess capacity and in this sense, the crisis went beyond the financial sector and also ex-\ntended to the real sector. Hypothetically, it could have been possible to neutralize the\ncontraction in demand either through rising domestic demand or by diversifying the ex-\nport basket to newer items and newer markets. Unfortunately, neither of these happened.\nTherefore, with the downturn in world trade, large segments of newly added capacities in\nthe industrial sector lay idle. However, short-term capital flows continued unabated. With\nthe tradables sector in bad shape due to the export downturn, too much of investment was\ndirected into nontradable sectors with long gestation periods and relatively lower rates of\nreturn. It was also directed to speculative activities, overextended industries, overambitious\ninfrastructure projects, and inefficient government monopolies.38 There was also a deterio-\nration in the terms of trade (and hence a fall in purchasing power) due to oversupply. This\nexcess supply condition tended to become more critical as a result of US firms regaining\nsome of their lost market shares and improving their competitiveness over the 1990s,\nincluding continued domestic demand contraction in Japan. One of the features of the Asian\ncrisis has therefore been that economies in which the share of exports to total industrial\nsector value added has been higher have suffered relatively more than those that are rela-\ntively more self-contained.\nIn addition to the recession element, there could, according to some observers, be\na Chinese link originating from unification of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) dual\nexchange rate system on 1 January 1994, to slackening export growth from the region. The\nunification of the exchange rate, it is argued, led to a depreciation of the Chinese yuan and\nthus contributed to an export slump in other East Asian countries. The PRC gained mar-\n37Quite understandably, this is linked to easy availability of credit.\n38For example, Nikon Industries Corp., a Philippine maker of electric appliances, borrowed $150 million\nto buy parts, but instead, gambled the money on local real estate (see Goldstein 1998).", "10\nket share in the US and Japanese markets at the expense of these countries. There is no dis-\npute regarding the depreciation of the yuan, but there is certainly some dispute regarding\nthe effect of this devaluation (see Fernald et al. 1998). There is some empirical support for\nthe proposition that the impact of the 1994 Chinese devaluation was not significant. It should\nalso be noted that even before the unification of the dual exchange rate system, most trans-\nactions were actually conducted at the depreciated market rate. The existence of common\nfactors like recession in developed economies, movements in world prices of key exports\nlike semiconductors, and movements in the yen-dollar rate may have had more of a bearing\non Eastern Asian exports than the devaluation of the yuan.\nE. Efficiency-type Arguments\nNow that the crisis has happened, there are arguments that the \u201cAsian Miracle\u201d was\nonly a \u201cmirage\u201d, or that the region\u2019s problems can be seen as penalties that it had to pay\nfor deviating from the \u201cdisciplines\u201d of the free market orthodoxy. However, barring Krugman\n(1994) and the trudging factor (labor, technology, efficiency), most arguments are post-facto\nrationalizations. And most of Krugman\u2019s ex post analysis also stress the problem of moral\nhazard rather than efficiency growth.\nA rapid increase in input usage, like expansion of employment, increases in education\nlevels, and massive investments in physical capital can bring about rises in output levels.\nIt is also known that growth based on expansion of inputs, rather than on growth in output\nper unit of input, is inevitably subject to diminishing returns. The original Krugman (1994)\nargument is a re-run of this simple hypothesis, where growth faltered because of declines\nin factor efficiency. When one accounts for the role of efficiency in explaining growth in\nEast Asia, Krugman\u2019s findings were that the contribution was negligible (also see Roubini\n1998). The higher short-run employment elasticities in the case of East Asia reflect the higher\nlabor-absorbing tendency in manufacturing activities of these economies. This implies that\nthey opted for labor-intensive modes of production, with higher production made possible\nby siphoning labor from \u201cagricultural\u201d to \u201cmanufacturing\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d sectors.39 Tech-\nnological growth for the region was low vis-a-vis international standards. Secular trends\nin total factor productivity (TFP) are fundamentally an empirical issue. But the point needs\nto be made that the empirical literature does not indicate a clear trend in TFP during the\n1990s, with some studies actually indicating an increase for East Asia (see Collins and\nBosworth 1996 and Sarel 1997). That apart, even if one accepts the hypothesis of decline\nin TFP, diminishing returns would have accounted for slowdown of growth rates in the\nfuture, not immediately. And the actual decline in growth was far more than what could\nhave been explained because of the TFP factor (see World Bank 1998). Perhaps we should\nalso state upfront our general skepticism about the TFP literature, where decline in TFP ef-\nfectively amounts to asserting that our power of explanation of contribution by factors of\nproduction has gone up over time.\nThe above brief survey of the literature has revealed that the discussion of the causes\nof the crisis has focused almost exclusively on the macro aspects with some attention be-\ning given to governance type issues in the financial sector. There has been hardly any attempt\n39However, one should also mention that there has been \"casualization\" in the process, resulting in\ninadequate insurance benefits or minimum wage coverage.", "11\nto answer the question, Were there any structural factors that contributed to the crisis and\nits timing?40 Further, the answer as to why the crisis has been so much more protracted\nand the recovery so elusive, compared to the Mexican or any other crisis, has been given\nin terms of the financial sector fragility or the breakdown of export credit mechanisms. In\nour view, these are at best partial explanations and they need to be supplemented by a more\ncomplete analysis of firm behavior if these questions are to be addressed, an effective re-\ncovery plan is to be put in place, and some relevant lessons are to be drawn for other\ndeveloping economies.\nIII. A Firmer View\nThe thrust of the arguments in the preceding section is macro. We now turn our at-\ntention to a micro and firm-level view of the real (export) sector of the economy, with a\nfew stylized examples. This is meant to be a generic framework (especially for the export\nsector) and not an explanation that cuts across all the countries and firms across the board.\nSome elements of what happened in the export sector have already been mentioned\u2014terms\nof trade shocks, erosion in competitiveness, declining export demand, and increasing over-\ncapacity in some sectors.\nFollowing the 1994-1995 crisis in Mexico, an export boom took place, helped by con-\ntinued expansion in Mexico\u2019s export to the United States.41 The North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) also helped through export-oriented foreign direct investments in\nMexico. Such an export recovery has not happened in East Asia (barring the export growth\nin the Philippines).42 Exports may have slumped because of higher costs of capital and\nimported inputs, shortage of capital, and recession. About 50 percent of East Asia\u2019s exports\ngo to Japan and East Asia, so recessionary conditions within the region have also hampered\nrecovery. World demand and prices for primary commodities like oil, rubber, and timber\nhave gone down and so have foreign currency prices of manufactured products. These have\nbrought down the rate of growth of international trade, which adversely affected export\nrecovery in these countries as well. But in the context of recovery, two questions need to\nbe asked. First, why have exports not responded to the price incentives resulting from\nexchange rate depreciation? Is there anything other than the J-curve at work? Second, why\nhas manufacturing activity in general not picked up so far and what explains the spate of\nbankruptcies in this sector across all these countries? Is the answer to these questions simply\nthat the 1996 slowdown and the subsequent nonrecovery are cyclical phenomena? Or are\nthere more deep-seated structural issues at work?43 The earlier slowdown and the expected\nrecovery are related issues. Without understanding the former, one cannot explain the latter,\nsuch as why, despite substantial depreciation, exports have not increased.\n40One tentative explanation along these lines was given by Laura Tyson, former chief economic advisor\nto the US President (Business Week 21 September 1998).\n41The United States accounts for 85% of Mexican exports.\n42Capital flows into Mexico also recovered to precrisis levels within six months and in relative terms,\nthey have taken much longer in East Asia.\n43See World Bank (1998) for arguments about the fall in world trade growth, yen depreciation, real\nexchange rate appreciation, and price declines for major export products. As will be evident, barring the last\ntwo factors, the thrust of our argument in this section is different. Even for price declines, the explanation\nis in terms of endogenous firm-level behavior, not quite an exogenous shock.", "12\nIn an attempt to provide an answer to the question on why East Asian exports have\nnot responded to the currency depreciation and remained sluggish in the post-crisis period,\nthe World Bank (1998) makes the following generic points about these exports:\n(i) Initially, state intervention pushed export growth through sector-specific in-\ncentives that amounted to multiple exchange rates. These were a part of the\nmuch-debated industrial policy. Subsequently, such incentives were replaced\nby generalized incentives (trade and investment regime reforms, appropriate\nexchange rates, macroeconomic policies).\n(ii) There has been a shift in the composition of exports from resource-intensive\nand labor-intensive ones to more skill-intensive and capital-intensive ones.\n(iii) Competition from low-cost producers (like the PRC) has \u201cpushed\u201d such a\nshift,44 while foreign direct investments and relocation of production bases\nfrom first generation newly industrialized countries have \u201cpulled\u201d such a shift.\n(iv) The export basket has become less diversified, both in terms of composition\n(specialization in high tech products like electronics) and geographical des-\ntination (within the region).\n(v) Thanks to standardization and mass production, even high-tech products like\nelectronics have become \u201ccommodities\u201d, with little room for product differ-\nentiation and branding. They are thus price-sensitive with high elasticities,\nand can lead to sharp slumps in market shares.\n(vi) In electronics, Thailand and Korea developed national firms. In contrast,\nMalaysia and the Philippines relied more on international production networks\nof multinational firms.\nIn our view the generic explanations provided by the World Bank study can be better\nappreciated in a general and analytical microeconomic framework that tries to model the\nbehavior of the East Asian firm. The basic assumption underlying our attempt to build such\na model is that over the last three decades, behavior of the generic East Asian firm (with\nobviously some variations across countries and sectors) has been different from the classic\nprofit-maximizing, risk-averse Marshallian firm, which is used for policy formulation in a\ncompetitive market framework. This analytical framework is presented in the technical\nappendix. On the basis of the simple model and stylized examples presented in the appendix,\nthe following points can be made about the behavior of the East Asian firm. It may be noted\nthat not all these points would have been obvious without these stylized examples as some\nare counterintuitive.\n44For example, given the export basket, Thailand has considerable exposure to such low-cost exports,\nwith higher labor costs in Thailand not being nullified through productivity gains.", "13\n(i) A specific incentive blurs the difference between revenue maximization and\nprofit maximization.\n(ii) Either a specific incentive or revenue maximization leads to higher domes-\ntic output (greater investments in capacity); higher aggregate output translating\ninto higher market share for the domestic firm. There is a terms of trade effect\n(export prices go down).\n(iii) Revenue maximization does not necessarily lead to lower profits compared\nto profit maximization. Depending on marginal costs, it is possible for rev-\nenue maximization to lead to higher profits initially, and lower profits later,\nthan profit maximization.\n(iv) Consider a transition from specific incentives to generalized incentives. In that\ntransition, incentive neutrality may not be ensured for all sectors, even if it\nis ensured for some sectors. For example, incentive neutrality may be ensured\nfor newer products that face greater competition and have elastic demand\ncurves.\n(v) Consider the domestic producer\u2019s expectations on a transition from specific\nto generalized incentives. A risk-loving domestic producer and the systemic\nenvironment may have encouraged such risk-loving behavior, and presume\nthe continuation of specific incentives.\n(vi) Consider a domestic producer\u2019s expectations about a parametric shift in\ndemand. A risk-loving domestic producer will presume expansions in demand.\nIn the case of profit maximization, the premium on risk taking is a function\nof the differential between domestic and foreign marginal costs.\n(vii) In an initial stage of increasing returns to scale, it is possible to pay labor\nwages more than the value of the marginal product of labor. But if this even-\ntually switches to nonincreasing returns to scale, labor can be paid more than\nthe value of the marginal product of labor only if capital is paid less than the\nvalue of the marginal product of capital.\n(viii) With perfect competition in factor markets, wage increases in excess of the\nvalue of the marginal product of labor require declines in the price of capi-\ntal or increases in capital input.\n(ix) With declining profitability, increases in capital through equity become\nunviable. Capital increases through borrowing are possible by artificially\nreducing the rate of interest, such as through state intervention. These trends\nare accentuated if shortages of skilled labor become a binding constraint.\n(x) Lumpiness of capital inputs implies cycles of overcapacity.", "14\n(xi) This entire strategy of risk-loving behavior and competing on the basis of\ncapital input increases borrowing, and low rates of interest become unviable\nif the rate of interest goes up and more importantly, if there is a binding con-\nstraint on the availability of credit.\nThe workings of industry-specific incentive systems as part of the industrial policy\nregime, and the implicit government guarantees and support to exporting firms including\nthe conglomerate nature of these firms of having close links to premier commercial banks\nand nonbank financial companies (some of which were captive to these conglomerates)\nresulted in a firm behavior that could be characterized as revenue-maximizing and non-\nrisk averse. This revenue-maximizing behavior implied a less than normal rate of profit for\nfirms. This was acceptable to them as long as their total revenue objectives were met and\nthe firms could continue expanding their market shares. The close cooperation between the\ngovernment and the corporate sector was also instrumental in achieving this growth ob-\njective and was also premised upon its continuing success. Commercial banks could continue\nlending to these \u201cvalued clients\u201d without much reference to prudential norms such as optimal\nexposure to a single client or single sector, since the successful revenue-maximizing firm\nbehavior implied regular debt-servicing by these companies. Therefore, even abnormally\nhigh gearing ratios were seen as acceptable because the past track record was impeccable\nand bank managers, perhaps, even at the highest levels, were themselves convinced that\nthe East Asian firm behavior with its aggressive market entry strategies based on price com-\npetition and market share expansion was an all-winning formula. In this understanding they\nwere supported not only by the national authorities but saw strong reinforcement from mul-\ntilateral development banks and foreign investors. Multilateral institutions praised the Asian\nmiracle, and even more importantly, private foreign investors poured money into these firms\nin ever increasing volumes, unmindful of gearing ratios, debt servicing capabilities, and the\nrather shallow technological and skill capabilities of the borrowing firms.\nThe making of the financial crisis was thus inherent in the firm behavior, and sup-\nported and overseen by national governments through fame and funds. These revenue\nmaximizing and nonrisk-averse firms built up large and diversified asset portfolios within\ndomestic and foreign markets. Their capacity expansion and market entry strategies were\nbased not on deepening the firm\u2019s technological capabilities or maintaining high (wage-\nadjusted) real productivity levels but on access to \u201ccheaper and unconstrained\u201d\u2019 supply of\nresources that enabled them to successfully grab larger market shares. As long as the in-\ndustry and market selection was right, the strategy resulted in rapid growth and higher\nmarket capitalization. This in turn brought forth access to greater resources and the \u201cvir-\ntuous cycle\u201d continued with gearing ratios and stock markets valuations rising to dizzy\nheights. The entire strategy was premised upon the continued success of revenue maximi-\nzation and market share expansion by exporting firms that did not visualize a demand\nconstraint as they were operating in global markets.\nThe strategy became infeasible with the demand slowdown in Japan, emergence of\nmassive excess capacity in some of the main export industries, sharp decline in unit values,\nand rising interest rates that raised debt servicing obligations. The change in the policy stance\nin some countries from specific to general industrywide incentives also implied that resources\nso far available to meet the industry-specific conditions were no longer available. The gov-\nernment oversight and support that was also an essential component of this strategy also", "15\nbecame greatly diluted due to the particular circumstances in each of the crisis-affected coun-\ntries. Korea effectively gave up the industrial policy stance after joining the OECD and also\nintroduced wide-ranging financial sector liberalization. Coordination with the chaebols, earlier\ndone on a regular basis at the highest levels of government, was also greatly weakened.\nThe government\u2019s desire to establish Thailand as a financial center and its taking over some\nof the financial business expected to shift away from Hong Kong, China after 1997 led to\naccelerated financial sector liberalization without the necessary strengthening of central bank\ncapabilities. In Malaysia and Indonesia the change in government\u2013industry relationship,\nthough less marked, also took place as the governments tried to adopt the dominant mantra\nof minimal government intervention and financial sector liberalization. All this implied that\nfirms were free to pursue their private objective of maximizing growth and total revenues\nwithout any external policy constraint that could introduce social and broader policy con-\nsiderations into their behavior. The advantage of a government agency overseeing the\nindividual firm strategies and combining it with a broader sector or national strategy was\nthus lost. In the absence of such coordination, individual firm behavior went beyond the\nfeasible realm. Unrelated and unwarranted diversification took place. As competition from\nUS and Chinese firms increased and expansion in tradable sectors became more difficult,\nfirms invested more heavily into nontradable sectors where returns were even lower, ges-\ntation periods longer, and resource requirements higher. The resulting currency and maturity\nmismatches and the liquidity crunch has by now been well-documented. We wish to point\nout only that signs of the impending crisis would have been visible much earlier if gov-\nernment agencies and foreign investors had cared to look for them in the corporate sectors\nrather than in the macro variables like the current account and fiscal deficit where all at-\ntention was focused.\nCommercial banks and foreign investors, unable to see the shift in the policy regime\nand sure of the implicit government oversight and guarantee, continued with their relaxed\nlending stance to the corporate sector in these countries. When the external shock came in\nthe form of declining export growth rates, falling unit prices, and higher interest rates, the\nfirms and commercial banks, as stated earlier, were driven to Ponzi game type situations\nuntil the bubble finally burst. The necessary micro foundations of the Asian crisis can thus\nbe seen to lie in the behavior of the Asian conglomerates and banks. The sufficient con-\ndition was the change in government policy that permitted the externalities from individual\nfirm behavior to go unchecked in the precrisis period. The strong government goal in the\nearlier decades had served to keep these externalities in check and to reconcile private goals\nwith social objectives.\nIV. Role of Government in Bank Restructuring\nin Crisis-affected Economies\nThese micro results thus emphasize risk-loving behavior in the presence of uncer-\ntainty (with risk neutralized by the state), expectations about continuation of incentives,\ncompetition on the basis of state intervention in capital markets, and overinvestments in\ncapacity in a Baumol-type revenue maximizing world. In such a framework, a credit squeeze\nrobs the firm of its competitive strategy. Restoring credit flows is thus crucially important\nin any rehabilitation program.", "16\nThe aftermath of the East Asian crisis has led to a questioning of this developmental\nrole of the state in financial markets.45 The Wade (1998) argument is that such question-\ning is unwarranted and there are no inherent problems with Asian state capitalism. The point\nin fact is stronger and one can paraphrase it as follows. Contractionary monetary policy\ndrove up interest rates in an attempt to restore confidence in the East Asian economies.\nWhether interest rate increases restore confidence in any economy is debatable, but certainly\nin the case of East Asia, it had perverse results where interest rates increased between 5\nto 10 percent (see also Stiglitz 1993, 1998a). Since there were no macro imbalances to start\nwith, interest rate increases made the state of the financial sector worse and contributed\nto a recession. Given what we said earlier about state intervention in capital markets, the\nfinancial system in East Asia had all the characteristics of a public good with positive ex-\nternalities. More than the hike in interest rates, the starving of credit contributed to firms\ngoing bankrupt, firms that had overextended because of risk-loving behavior and revenue-\nmaximizing tendencies. Coupled with the exogenous shock, there was now an endogenous\nshock. Some firms going bankrupt contributed to the deterioration of the capital position\nof banks, in addition to interfirm debt contributing to further uncertainty (Stiglitz 1998d).\nThe resulting credit rationing for even viable firms drove them to bankruptcy. With bank-\nbased financial systems and high leverage, households and small and medium-sized\nenterprises that had no substitute for bank credit were also faced with a credit crunch. There\nis now sufficient evidence of this credit-crunch-induced corporate sector crisis happening\nin Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia, with the impact less sharp in Thailand and the Philippines\n(World Bank 1998).46\nConsider the following quote from Stiglitz (1998d). \u201cIn medicine, we have come a\nlong way from medieval blood lettings and blaming the victims for their condition\u2026. The\nfinancial system is like the brain of the economy. In a crisis it can virtually cease to func-\ntion\u2026. In normal times we view high capital adequacy standards as a way to ensure prudent\nbanking. The point of the additional capital, however, is to provide a cushion against bad\ntimes. If, in the midst of a downturn, we push banks too quickly toward \u2018prudent\u2019 capi-\ntal adequacy ratios, we risk shutting down the flow of credit entirely\u2026. The procedures\nfor handling bankruptcies in normal times and in crises should be quite different. Just as\na central concern in the time of crisis in addressing the problems of the financial sector should\nbe the preservation of the flow of credit, so too the central concern in corporation organi-\nzation should be maintaining production\u2026. Even a well-managed firm could easily go\nbankrupt simply because it failed to plan for an 80 percent devaluation and a period of\ninterest rates in excess of 100 percent.\u201d\nHow does one break this vicious cycle and does the East Asian model have a role\nto play in this? What is the state to do about restructuring the banking sector and restarting\ncredit flows to the corporate sector? We suggest a rather straightforward but effective\nmodality below.\n45A point has been made that the earlier financial liberalization was itself a deviation from the East\nAsian model because there was little or no control over external borrowing and little or no state guidance\nfor investment (Brownbridge and Kirkpatrick 1998).\n46For borrowers who depend on banks, evidence of a credit crunch can be deduced from aggregate\ncredit flows, the spread between bank lending rates and corporate bonds (reflecting the risk premium for in-\ndividual economic agents), and the spread between corporate and government bonds (a general risk premium).\nUsing this methodology, a study by Ding, Dominic, and Ferri, quoted in World Bank (1998) finds widespread\nevidence of a credit crunch in East Asia.", "17\nAs surrogate measures indicative of the fiscal costs of bank restructuring, one can\nconsider the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans.47 Official NPL to loan ratios\nare 40% in Thailand, 7.9% in Indonesia, 21.8% in Korea, 10.2% in Malaysia, and 11% in the\nPhilippines (ADB 1999).48 With comparable methodology, Standard and Poor and J.P. Morgan\ngive ratios of slightly over 40% for Indonesia, between 35 and 40% for Thailand, and be-\ntween 20 and 30% for Korea (ADB 1999). Using J.P. Morgan figures, our computations are\nshown in the following table.\nTable 1: NPL Ratios and Recapitalization/GDP\nIndonesia Malaysia Philippines Korea Thailand\nNPL ratios (%) 30-35 15-25 8-10 25-30 25-30\nRecapitalization needs/GDP (%) 19 20 0 30 30\nDebt/GDP (1996) 24 36 \u2014 9 4\nNew debt/GDP49 43 56 \u2014 39 34\nIn principle, there are six not mutually exclusive ways to bring about bank restruc-\nturing. These are bailouts (supplementing bank capital with public resources), nationalization,\nassisted mergers, recapitalization and subsequent sales, restructuring plans, and liquida-\ntion and payoffs (World Bank 1998). There are tradeoffs in terms of speed, fiscal costs,\nincentives for bank performance, and generating confidence in the banking system. For ex-\nample, bailout and nationalization are faster, although they lead to reduced incentives for\nbank performance. Conversely, confidence in the banking system is restored fastest with\nnationalization and assisted mergers. Yet another taxonomy of restructuring can be in terms\nof a market-based approach, a recapitalized-bank approach, and a government-led approach\n(World Bank 1998). In a market-based approach, enterprises are restructured, assets are sold\nto domestic and foreign investors, and debt is restructured. Given what was said earlier\nabout the role of the East Asian state in the financial sector, we are skeptical about such\na market-based approach being fast enough or restoring confidence in the banking system\nsufficiently quickly. In a recapitalized-bank approach, the state recapitalizes banks on an\nex ante assessment of their losses and does not intervene in corporate sector restructuring.\nWhile such an approach can be fast, our skepticism concerns the technical ability of banks\nto bring about corporate sector restructuring efficiently. And the avowed reduced-moral-\nhazard advantage of this approach may not come about because the state continues to\n47The costs also depend on the importance of the banking sector in financial intermediation and\ncorrective action taken by the state.\n48These are for different months in 1998: July for Thailand, January for Indonesia, June for Korea,\nJune for Malaysia, and November for the Philippines. The figures are not comparable.\n49Since the figures are from the same original J. P. Morgan source, they are identical to the ones given\nin World Bank (1999).", "18\nprovide guarantees and recapitalization is never close-ended. In other words, we are in favor\nof a government-led approach, where the state takes over distressed assets from banks and\nreplaces them with government bonds.50 Banks are recapitalized and the state tries to re-\nstructure the claims and bring about corporate restructuring, with the involvement of banks.\nSince the emphasis is on speed and restoring confidence in the banking system, the gov-\nernment-led approach has much to recommend it.51\nWe would therefore prefer a more active and interventionist role for the state in\ntackling the financial sector crisis. The suggestion above is to allow the fiscal balance to\ndeteriorate temporarily and use these resources to put a large part of the banking sector\nback on its feet quickly so that the binding financial constraint on the real sector can be\nremoved and recovery started. Are government debt to GDP levels of between 34 and 56\npercent sustainable?  We believe they are. Depending on assumptions made about the real\nrate of interest and the growth rate of the economy, such debt levels can be stabilized with\na primary fiscal surplus of around 3 percent of GDP. In the period preceding the crisis, both\nIndonesia and Thailand were able to achieve such primary fiscal surpluses.52 Our suggestion\nthus is for increased government borrowing, both domestic and foreign, to finance the\nrecapitalization of banks. These debts can then be liquidated in the next round of reforms,\nwhich would focus on privatizing of state assets, including banks that have been restored\nback to health. This strategy has the merit of quickly bringing back the banking sector to\na healthy position and restoring credit to the beleagured corporate sector. This could be con-\nsidered the very basis of an effective recovery strategy that minimizes social distress.\nThe road map for recovery obviously goes beyond the financial sector and also\nencompasses the corporate sector.53 Per se, most of these suggestions are unexceptionable,\nalthough there is scope for debate about sequencing capital account convertibility. Other\n50These securities can later be used to develop a pension program.\n51Some elements of the government-led approach have begun to emerge in East Asia, with govern-\nment-owned asset management companies in Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia. But these asset management\ncompanies have not yet begun to function effectively.\n52The magnitude of the surplus was lower for Korea and figures on the primary balance are not\navailable for Malaysia and the Philippines.\n53Broadly, the following have been proposed: (a) Close insolvent financial institutions and firms (Korea)\nand transfer assets to restructuring agencies (Indonesia, Korea, Thailand); (b) Recapitalize and merge others;\n(c) Use explicit public funds through the budget for bank restructuring; (d) Strengthen prudential regulations,\nloan classification and provisioning requirements and capital adequacy norms; (e) Liberalize foreign investment\nin domestic banks (Indonesia, Korea, Thailand); and (f) Restructure domestic and external corporate debt\n(Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand). Quite understandably, these spill over into areas of competition policy and\ncorporate governance, such as the following: (a) Liberalize restrictive marketing arrangements (Indonesia);\n(b) Establish competitive procedures for privatization of government assets and government procurement\n(Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand); (c) Ban or limit use of public funds to bail out private corporations (Indonesia,\nKorea, Malaysia, Thailand); (d) Implement bankruptcy laws and exit policies (Indonesia, Korea, Thailand);\n(e) Privatize and close nonviable public enterprises (Indonesia); (f) Enforce stronger corporate disclosure stan-\ndards (Korea); and (g) Liberalize foreign direct investment policies in nonfinancial sector areas. On trade policy,\nmost of East Asia was already fairly open. There are therefore limited suggestions about reducing import duties\nand export taxes (Indonesia) and easing quantitative restrictions on imports and exports (Indonesia and Korea).\nThe suggestions mentioned above concern domestic economies. In addition, there have been discussions\nabout the future architecture of the international financial system and some debate about capital account con-\nvertibility and controls (or taxes) on short-term cross-border capital movements. On the global financial\narchitecture, the thrust of the argument is for improvement in dissemination of information based on greater\navailability, transparency, and monitoring based on acceptable international standards.", "19\nissues are strengthening of national financial systems and managing international financial\ncrises (Corsetti and Srinivasan 1999). The efficiency gains from capital account convertibility\nneed not be repeated, although the apparent benefits (as opposed to current account con-\nvertibility) have been questioned in studies like Rodrik (1998), or even by Bhagwati (1998).\nThat apart, capital account convertibility also reduces the scope for discretionary monetary\nand fiscal policy at home. The flip side is the kind of argument advanced in Bhagwati (1998)\nthat the case for free trade in goods cannot necessarily be extrapolated to free financial flows,\nsince there are several distortions, informational asymmetries being one. There are two kinds\nof arguments one encounters. First, the obvious proposition is that throwing open the capital\naccount without internal systemic reform is asking for trouble. Second, the proposition that\nthere is a difference between short-term capital movements and other forms of cross-bor-\nder capital flows lends validity to the suggestion for imposing a Tobin (1978) type tax, or\nthe Chilean variant for handling short-term debt or portfolio investments.\nV. Conclusion:\nIs the Asian Model of Development Still Relevant?\nOne of the perhaps inadvertent and rather peculiar fallouts has been that both the\n\u201cradical free marketeers\u201d and the supporters of the \u201cactive state intervention and indus-\ntrial policy proponents\u201d have been left looking a bit embarrassed. The former because the\nstar followers of the free and open policies have suffered the most in these crisis; the lat-\nter on account of Korea and Japan having come a cropper. There has been an attempt to\nargue that these crises have shown the inherent weaknesses of the Asian model of devel-\nopment. The model\u2019s central features include a close cooperation between the state, financial\nsector, and the corporations, which was said to have reduced financial costs and made eco-\nnomic agents less risk-averse and encouraged them to plan for longer-term goals. It is argued\nin some quarters that this fostered weak governance, all kinds of corruption, and has been\none of the main causes of the problems faced in the banking sector of all these economies.\nThere has been stringent criticism of government intervention in the capital markets as\nhaving resulted in connected lending and overlending, erosion of prudential norms, and\nperversion of the credit appraisal process. In our view this criticism is only partly valid.\nIt should not be used to take away from the central argument that the Asian crisis essen-\ntially represented a case of market failure rather than government failure.\nOf the various forms of state intervention, state intervention in capital markets is\nof special interest because market imperfections can be significant there, a point that has\nbeen made in Stiglitz (1993, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 1998d). Because of pervasive market im-\nperfections in capital markets, state intervention in capital markets can make these markets\nas well as the economy perform better (Stiglitz 1993). Within capital markets, the East Asian\nstate promoted savings (postal savings banks), ensured long-term credit (development banks),\nand developed the financial infrastructure (bond and equity markets). There was also fi-\nnancial restraint or financial repression and theoretical arguments that financial restraint\nleads to inefficient allocation, or empirical surveys linking financial repression to economic\nperformance are both suspect (Stiglitz 1993 and Stiglitz and Uy 1996). In addition to financial\nrestraint, in East Asia priority industries were given preferential access to capital (and foreign\nexchange). There were also subsidized interest rates, although access to credit may have", "20\nbeen more important than the price aspect.54 Note also the budgetary surpluses East Asian\ngovernments maintained. Since governments did not borrow, there was no market for\ngovernment securities. There was therefore no risk-free rate that could be used as a bench-\nmark, and a market for corporate bonds did not develop. Not only did governments not\nborrow, neither did households. This also biased the system toward high debt/equity ra-\ntios. In addition to the risk-free rate, the interest rate reflects a risk premium. Apart from\ndeepening and broadening the financial market to pool risk and bring down the premium,\nstate intervention sought to bring down the risk premium through various means. Reduced\nprovisions for bankruptcy; bank holding of equity in firms, and close links between banks,\nfirms, and the government are examples. High leveraging and the so-called \u201ccrony capi-\ntalism\u201d were thus part of the strategy.\nThis is an argument that is developed strongly in Wade (1998), Wade and Veneroso\n(1998), and Stiglitz (1998a), making the point that the Anglo-American mindset failed to\nappreciate the role of state intervention in financial markets and failed to differentiate\nbetween inadequate oversight and over-regulation.55 The state did not misdirect credit;\nmisdirection of credit was done by the private sector and was an instance of market fail-\nure, which the state failed to identify as a problem sufficiently early. Almost tautologically,\nhigh debt-equity ratios make the system more vulnerable to exogenous shocks, since costs\nof debt amount to fixed levels of payment, unlike equity costs. Therefore, a linkage between\nbanks, the state and the corporate sector is necessary to reduce systemic risks, as opposed\nto bailing out firms for inappropriate judgment. The role of the state and a close working\nrelationship among the different segments of socioeconomic agents is further reinforced if\nour explanation of the Asian crisis being different from all previous recent episodes is\naccepted. This difference we have argued lies in this current crisis being a case of market\nfailure rather than policy failure and the structural reform efforts consequentially being\ndirected to improving firms\u2019 competitiveness. The role of the state in addressing the problems\nin the financial, essentially banking sector, has been discussed at length in the previous\nsection. Other than that, government attention and perhaps resources, in the initial stages\nat least, will also have to be directed at: (i) facilitating technological upgradation of the firms;\n(ii) overhauling of the education and vocational training system so as to increase the supply\nof skills that can absorb and adopt the higher levels of technologies; and (iii) creating a sys-\ntem of social security nets that will minimize the social costs of any future cyclical\ndownswings and exogenous shocks.\nIn the end some useful lessons can be drawn from the above discussion of an al-\nternate and a firm-based analysis of the East Asian crisis. First, some East Asian economies\nfunctioned as economies with abundant factor endowments of capital not labor. With capital\ninputs characterized by lumpiness of investments, it means cycles of overcapacity. During\nsuch periods of overcapacity, the withdrawal of government support and a credit squeeze\non working capital can be disastrous. This has to be avoided. Second, a shift in policy re-\ngimes can only be worked out gradually and sequentially so as not to create a divergence\nbetween expectations and realities. These sudden policy shifts often result from externally\nimposed conditionalities that can lead to unnecessary social stress and welfare loss. Third,\n54There were restrictions on consumer credit and low interest rates transferred income from households\nto firms.\n55Unlike Latin America, the East Asian debt was mostly private.", "21\nthe Asian crisis shows that we should change our tendency to look for explanatory factors\nfor the crisis in macro conditions specially now when all developing, emerging, and transition\neconomies know the importance of following the right macro policies. Shifting the focus\nto the \u201creal sectors\u201d may permit more timely and appropriate action, thereby reducing overall\nwelfare loss. Fourth, the East Asian crisis does not simply reflect a governance crisis or that\nof so-called crony capitalism. As discussed in the third section, the firm behavior and the\nconcomitant government and commercial bank support was the basis for sustained and un-\nprecedented growth in these economies. Although some strengthening of financial sector\nregulation, monitoring, and supervisory capability is certainly called for, it is simply ex-\npedient and perhaps counterproductive to characterize the crisis as resulting from poor\ncorporate and financial sector governance. Let us not forget that until July 1997, the same\nunderlying model was being studied across universities and in research departments of most\nfinancial institutions for its relevance to not only developing but also developed economies.\nFifth and finally, one of the most important objectives of government policy in the\nnear future will also be to ensure that the cooperation between the state and other segments\nof the economy is increasingly transparent and accountable. In short, strengthening the\nsystem of governance will remain one of the important priorities of public policy, but not\nthe only one. The transaction costs of a weak governance system are difficult to quantify,\nbut the costs of lack of financial resources to the firms and their inability to achieve high\nrates of growth are easily quantified as slower or negative economic growth and increas-\ning social distress. The Asian model of development with strengthened governance systems\ncould provide the most effective means of taking Asia back on a high and sustained growth\npath. Public intervention is warranted to address market failure.", "22\nTechnical Appendix\nMC\nP AC\nP1\nAC1\nS\nO Q1MR1 Q MR AR1 AR\nAt the firm level, the framework we envision is the following. AR is the average revenue curve and\nMR is the marginal revenue curve.1 MC is the marginal cost curve. A profit maximizing firm chooses an\noutput level OQ determined by point S, with a price corresponding to OP. If the average cost curve is AC,\nsuch a firm can be intramarginal, with zero profits. Through state intervention in the form of incentives\n(subsidies), the average cost curve can be driven down to AC\u2019. For simplicity, the MC curve is assumed to\nremain unchanged in the diagram, but this is purely an artifice. The subsidy is a \u201cfixed cost\u201d type of\nsubsidy, meaning the firm is no longer intramarginal. However, if there is a downward parametric shift in\ndemand (AR\u2019 and MR\u2019), despite the subsidy, the firm can once again become intramarginal. Note that in\nthis diagram, when the behavior of other firms is not considered2, a Baumol-type revenue-maximizing\nfirm will have a higher level of output than OQ (when the demand curve is AR) and a firm that ought not\nto be intramarginal can end up with zero or negative profits. However, this is no longer the case if the\nmarket structure is that of an oligopoly.\nWe now represent strands of the argument through the following stylized examples.\nThe Basic Structure\nTo bring in oligopoly, we postulate a market demand curve given as p = a - bq, p being the price and q\nthe aggregate output. If there are n firms (j=1,\u2026n), q = \u03a3 q. The cost function for the jth firm is C = c q, c\nj j j j j\nbeing the marginal cost and there being no fixed costs. There are thus differential cost structures across\nfirms. Profits for the jth firm are \u03a0 = (a \u2013 bq) q - c q = (a \u2013 bq - c ) q .\nj j   j j j j\nWe now think of two producers, a domestic one (subscripted 1) and a foreign one (subscripted 2) and\nexamine the noncooperative equilibrium. There is no product differentiation and the domestic and foreign\nproducts are perfect substitutes for each other in the global market.\n1\nTherefore, one is not working in a perfectly competitive framework. Nor is the firm a monopolist.\n2\nFor example, when the firm is a monopolist.", "23\nWhen both producers are profit maximizers, on solving the equations for profit maximization, we\nobtain the following: q  = (a \u2013 2c  + c )/3b, q  = (a + c  - 2c )/3b, q = (2a \u2013 (c + c ))/3b, P  = (a \u2013 2c  + c )2/9b.3\n1 1 2 2 1 2 1  2 1 1 2\np = (a + c  + c )/3.\n1 2\nNote that q  > q  as c  > c  . As long as the marginal costs of the domestic producer are lower than\n1 2 2 1\nthose of the foreign producer, the domestic producer will have a more than 50 percent share of the market.\nIn the special case when cost functions are identical, q = q  = (a \u2013c)/3b and both producers have an equal\n1  2\nmarket share. P  = (a \u2013c)2 / 9b.\n1\nWe can now introduce a subsidy or incentive to the domestic producer (without a corresponding\nsubsidy to the foreign producer). This subsidy can either be lump sum (K), or one that is a function of\noutput (t), the former being identified with generalized liberalization and the latter being identified with\nsector-specific treatment. When the incentive (t) is a function of output, it effectively amounts to artificially\nbringing down c since marginal costs become (c  \u2013 t). If t is large enough and actually equal to c , there is\n1  1 1\nno difference between profit maximization and revenue maximization. Any such t reduces the difference\nbetween revenue maximization and profit maximization. The implications are obvious: q  goes up (greater\n1\ninvestments in capacity), q  goes down, the domestic producer\u2019s market share goes up and so do profits.\n2\nAggregate output goes up and the price declines (terms of trade effect). When the subsidy is lump sum,\nnothing changes except the domestic producer\u2019s profits. These now become  P  = (a \u2013 2c  + c )2/9b + K.\n1 1 2\nIf the domestic producer is a revenue maximizer (in the absence of incentives) and the foreign pro-\nducer is a profit maximizer, in solving the equations, we obtain the following: q  = (a + c )/3b, q  = (a - 2c )/\n1 2 2 2\n3b, q = (2a -c )/3b, P  = (a \u2013 3c  + c )(a + c )/9b . p = (a + c )/3. Compared to profit maximization, one gets the\n2 1 1 2 2 2\nintuitive result that as q  goes up (greater investments in capacity), q  goes down and the domestic producer\u2019s\n1 2\nmarket share increases. Overall output goes up and the price declines (terms of trade effect). If one ex-\ntrapolates on the basis of a monopoly, one also gets a result that is not intuitive. Compared to profit maxi-\nmization, P  does not necessarily go down as a result of revenue maximization. Simplifying the results,\n1\nrevenue maximization leads to lower profits than profit maximization only if 4c  > (a + c ). If the inequality\n1 2\nis reversed, somewhat paradoxically, revenue maximization leads to higher profits. Consider a scenario\nwhere marginal costs change over time, with c going up (higher labor costs) and c  coming down as other\n1  2\ncountries \u201ccatch up\u201d. It is then possible that revenue maximization leads to higher profits initially, and\nlower profits beyond a certain point in time.\nIf there is a subsidy with revenue maximization, nothing changes, except that the domestic producer\nobtains larger profits. This is regardless of whether the subsidy is specific or lump sum. In the process, it is\npossible to delay the reduced profits that revenue maximization may lead to eventually.\nEither profit maximization (with an output-specific subsidy) or revenue maximization can thus lead\nto higher levels of output, expansion in capacity, larger market shares, and deterioration in terms of trade.\nDepending on what is happening to marginal costs, revenue maximization can lead to higher profits than\nprofit maximization initially, but lower profits thereafter.\nMultiple Products or Markets\nLet us now think of two products the domestic producer can produce, X and Y. These can be inter-\npreted either as two products or two different markets. For example, the same product may be sold to an\nold market X or a new market Y. Alternatively, an old product X or a new product Y may be sold to the\nsame market. In general, one can have combinations of old and new products and markets. There is a\nforeign producer (subscripted 2) who competes in X and there is a foreign producer (subscripted 3) who\ncompetes in Y. There is of course nothing to prevent 2 and 3 from being identical. For profit maximization,\nthe following needs no explanation.\n3\nIn this instance, the profit of the second producer can be obtained by symmetry. But throughout, we will only be interested\nin the profits of the domestic producer. When the number of firms increases, there will be a profit squeeze. But that is not an aspect\nwe wish to focus on.", "24\nWe have q X = (aX \u2013 2c X + c )/3bX, q  = (aX + c X - 2c )/3bX, qX = (2aX \u2013 (c X+ c ))/3bX, \u03a0 X = (aX \u2013 2c X\n1 1 2 2 1 2 1   2 1 1\n+ c )2/9bX , pX = (aX + c X + c )/3 and q Y = (aY \u2013 2c Y + c )/3bY, q  = (aY + c Y - 2c )/3bY, qY = (2aY \u2013 (c Y+ c ))/\n2 1 2 1 1 3 2 1 3 1   3\n3bY, \u03a0 Y = (aY \u2013 2c Y + c )2/9bY , pY = (aY + c Y + c )/3.\n1 1 3 1 3\nWe now move from a regime of output-specific incentives to generalized incentives. With an output-\nspecific incentive, profits from X are \u03a0 X = (aX \u2013 2(c X \u2013 t X) + c )2/9bX  and profits from Y are \u03a0 Y = (aY \u2013 2(c Y\n1 1 1 2 1 1\n\u2013 t Y) + c )2/9bY. With a lump sum incentive (K) that is uniform for both X and Y, profits from X are \u03a0 X = (aX\n1 3 1\n\u2013 2c X + c )2/9bX  + K and profits from Y are \u03a0 Y = (aY \u2013 2c Y+ c )2/9bY + K. Assume that the transition from\n1 2 1 1 3\noutput-specific incentives to lump sum incentives is incentive-neutral for X, so that  P X = (aX \u2013 2c X + c )2/\n1 1 2\n9bX  + K is greater than P X = (aX \u2013 2(c X \u2013 t X) + c )2/9bX. The producer does not lose as a result of the\n1 1 1 2\ntransition. Does this necessarily imply that the transition is also incentive-neutral for Y?  Clearly not. There\nis no way to establish that \u03a0 Y = (aY \u2013 2c Y + c )2/9bY  + K is greater than \u03a0 Y = (aY \u2013 2(c Y \u2013 t Y) + c )2/9bY.\n1 1 3 1 1 1 3\nConsider a simple instance of this general framework. The same product is exported to two markets\nX and Y, so the marginal costs are identical for X and Y. The initial output incentive is such that it com-\npletely neutralizes marginal costs, c  is equal to t. Since it is the same product, the foreign producer is the\n1\nsame in both markets. Given these conditions, with incentive neutrality in X we have, (aX \u2013 2c  + c )2/9bX  +\n1 2\nK is greater than (aX + c )2/9bX. This reduces to K > 4c  (aX \u2013 c  + c )/9bX. For similar incentive neutrality in\n2 1 1 2\nY, this must guarantee K > 4c  (aY \u2013 c  + c )/9bY. It is evident that this is not necessarily the case. The answer\n1 1 2\ndepends on the demand functions for X and Y. Since X is a developed market, aX is presumably greater\nthan aY, the demand curve for X is \u201coutside\u201d the demand curve for Y. If the slopes of the demand curves are\nidentical, incentive neutrality for X then guarantees incentive neutrality for Y. But the demand curves need\nnot have the same slopes. If the demand curve for X is steeper (greater product differentiation and rela-\ntively inelastic demand curve) and the demand curve for Y is flatter (reduced product differentiation and\nrelatively elastic demand curve), then incentive neutrality for X does not guarantee incentive neutrality for\nY. In the transition from specific to generalized incentives, incentive neutrality may not have been ensured\nfor newer products that face greater competition and have elastic demand curves. This hinders export\ndiversification.\nIncentive Transition\nConsider now a transition from specific incentives to generalized incentives with three possible sce-\nnarios: first, a system with no specific incentives and a lump sum incentive of K; second, a system where\nthe specific incentive is 0.5c ; and third, a system where the specific incentive is c . From what has been\n1 1\nsaid earlier, with a profit-maximizing domestic producer, the following table needs no explanation.\nK, t=0 K=0, t=0.5c K=0, t=c\n1 1\nq (a \u2013 2c  + c )/3b (a \u2013 c  + c )/3b(a + c )/3b\n1 1 2 1 2 2\nq (a + c  - 2c )/3b (2a + c  - 4c )/6b(a \u2013 2c )/3b\n2 1 2 1 2 2\nQ (2a \u2013 (c + c ))/3b (4a \u2013 (c + 2c ))/6b(2a \u2013 c )/3b\n1  2 1  2 2\nP (a + c  + c )/3 (2a + c  + 2c )/6(a + c )/3\n1 2 1 2 2\n\u03a0 (a \u2013 2c  + c )2/9b + K (a \u2013 c  + c )2/9b(a + c )2/9b\n1 1 2 1 2 2", "25\nThe problem becomes interesting because there is uncertainty in the system. The incentive regime can\nbe any of the three above, but the domestic producer does not know which one of these it is going to be. For\nsimplicity\u2019s sake, let us presume the foreign producer has perfect knowledge. In the following table, the\nrows represent the choice of the producer, while the columns represent the actual incentive regime. The\nnorth-west to south-east diagonal elements are the familiar ones. But the entries in the other cells have to\nbe worked out as the producer has made a \u201cwrong\u201d output decision.\n\u03a0  values K, t=0 K=0, t=0.5c K=0, t=c\n1  1 1\nK, t=0 (a \u2013 2c  + c )2/9b + K (a-2c +c )(2a-c +2c )/18b * (a-2c +c )(a+c +c )/9b\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nK=0, t=0.5c (a-c +c )(2a-5c +2c )/18b + K (a \u2013 c  + c )2/9b (a-c +c )(2a+c +2c )/18b\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nK=0, t=c (a+c )(a-3c +c )/9b +K (a+c )(2a-3c +2c )/18b (a + c )2/9b **\n1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2\nIt is impossible to determine maximin and maximax values without setting bounds on K. The deduc-\ntion is simplest when K is within the bounds q c  > K > (q c )/2, q  being the actual level of output produced\n1 1 1 1 1\nby the domestic producer. The maximax value is indicated by ** and the maximin value is indicated by *.4\nA risk-averse domestic producer will choose the maximin value and assume that a specific incentive does\nnot exist. Instead, there is a generalized or lump sum incentive. But if there is no particular reason to\nassume that this is a zero sum game and if the systemic environment has encouraged risk-loving behavior,\nthe maximax value will be chosen. The domestic producer\u2019s behavior is then predicated on the assump-\ntion that a full specific incentive exists.\nParametric Shift in Demand\nLet us now consider a parametric shift in demand. Given the demand function p = a- bq, such a\nparametric shift can be either in a or in b. We consider a parametric shift in a, an analogous deduction is\npossible for changes in b. The parametric shift in demand results in a getting transformed to la. If \u03bb > 1, the\ndemand curve shifts outward. If \u03bb < 1, the demand curve shifts inward and if  \u03bb =1, the demand curve is\nunchanged. For purposes of simplicity, we assume that the foreign producer does not expect a shift in\ndemand and therefore, q  is fixed at (a+c -2c )/3b. It is obvious that a profit-maximizing domestic producer\n2 1 2\nwill now choose an output level given as (a \u2013 2c  + c )/3b + (\u03bb - 1)a/2b. If \u03bb > 1, domestic and aggregate\n1 2\noutput is increased. If \u03bb < 1, domestic and aggregate output is decreased and if  \u03bb =1, domestic and aggre-\ngate output is unchanged. At such a level of generality it is impossible to be more specific. Therefore, let us\nconsider three special cases with \u03bb =2,  \u03bb =1 and \u03bb =1/2.\nThe following table needs no explanation.\n\u03bb = 2 \u03bb = 1 \u03bb = \u00bd\nq (5a \u2013 4c  + 2c )/6b (a \u2013 2c  + c )/3b (a \u2013 8 c  +4 c )/12b\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2\nq (a + c  - 2c )/3b (a + c  - 2c )/3b (a + c  \u2013 2c )/3b\n2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nQ (7a \u2013 2c - 2c )/6b (2a \u2013 (c + c ))/3b (5a \u2013 4 c  \u2013 4 c )/12b\n1  2 1  2 1 2\nP (5a + 2c  + 2c )/6 (a + c  + c )/3 (a + 4c  + 4c  )/12\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n4\nTechnically, this maximin value is subject to the condition that a+c2>c1. This is acceptable, as without this condition being\nsatisfied, the domestic producer's profits will be negative.", "26\nWhen \u03bb = 2, output expands. But p also increases because of the shift in the demand curve, a reverse\nterms of trade effect. Similarly, when \u03bb = \u00bd, output contracts and p declines. As in the preceding example,\nwe introduce uncertainty into the system with the requirement that the domestic producer does not know\nthe value of \u03bb. The incentive parametric shift in demand can be any of the three, but the domestic producer\ndoes not know which one of these it is going to be. In the following table, the rows represent the assump-\ntion of the producer, while the columns represent the actual state of demand.\n\u03a0  values \u03bb = 2 \u03bb = 1 \u03bb = \u00bd\n1 \n\u03bb = 2 (5a \u2013 4c  +2c )2/36b ** (5a-4c +2c )(-a-4c +2c )/36b (5a-4c +2c )(-2a-2c +c )/18b\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n\u03bb = 1 (a-2c +c )(4a-2c +c )/9b5 (a \u2013 2c  + c )2/9b (a-2c +c )(-a-4c +2c )/18b\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n\u03bb = \u00bd (a-8c +4c )(19a-8c +4c )/144b (a- 8c  +4c )(7a-8c +4c ) /144b (a \u20138c  + 4c )2/144b *\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nThe maximax value is indicated by ** and the maximin value is indicated by *. A risk-averse domestic\nproducer will choose the maximin value and assume that there will be a downward parametric shift in\ndemand. But if there is no particular reason to assume that this is a zero sum game and if the systemic\nenvironment has encouraged risk-loving behavior, the maximax value will be chosen. The domestic\nproducer\u2019s behavior is then predicated on the assumption that there will be an expansion in demand. The\ngap between the maximax and maximin values varies positively with a and c  and inversely with c  and b.\n2 1\nIn that sense, the premium on risk taking is higher if the foreign marginal cost is high or if the domestic\nmarginal cost is low. But if foreign marginal costs decline or if domestic marginal costs rise, the premium\non risk taking goes down.\nThe producer can of course be a revenue maximizer rather than a profit maximizer. It is easily checked\nthat even in that case, a risk-averse domestic producer will assume a contraction in demand (with a payoff\nof (a + 4c )2/144b) and a risk-loving domestic producer will assume an expansion in demand (with a payoff\n2\nof  (5a + 2c )2/36b). In this case, the premium on risk varies positively with a and c  and inversely with b.\n2 2\nK and L Inputs\nTo develop a capital market argument, let us now visualize two inputs, capital (K) and labor (L). As\nbefore, the domestic producer is subscripted 1. With profit-maximizing behavior on the part of the domes-\ntic producer, we have the following conditions on L  and K :\n1 1\nP(1- 1/e)dq /dL  = w (1+1/e ) and P(1-1/e)dq /dK  = k (1+1/e ), where e is the elasticity of market\n1 1 1 L 1 1 1 K\ndemand, w  is the wage rate, k  is the price of capital, e  is the elasticity of  wages with respect to labor\n1 1 L\ninput, and e  is the elasticity of the price of capital with respect to capital input.\nK\nLet us now assume perfect competition in product and factor markets. With increasing returns to\nscale, it is possible to pay labor wages that are greater than the value of the marginal product of labor,\nwithout paying capital at a price lower than the value of the marginal product of capital. However, if there\nare nonincreasing returns to scale, this is no longer possible. In such circumstances, state intervention can\nlead to a price of capital that is lower than the value of the marginal product. With revenue-maximizing\nbehavior, the labor input will be up to the point where the marginal product of labor is zero.\nHowever, perfect competition in product and factor markets is not a plausible assumption. With\nimperfect competition, the link between say, wages and value of marginal product of labor, breaks down.\nHowever, even if there is imperfect competition in product markets (with perfect competition in factor\nmarkets), we still have \u03b4q /\u03b4L /\u03b4q /\u03b4K = w /k  . The point is a simple one. Assume that conditions in the\n1 1 1 1  1 1\nforeign country do not change, but there is an increase in wages relative to the marginal product of labor in\n5\nThis cell's payoff is interesting because depending on demand conditions, it shows that the payoff from being wrong can\nsometimes be greater than the payoff from being right.", "27\nthe home country. This requires exogenous changes in the price of capital,6 or increases in K . Consider\ninvestment given by the expression \u2206K /K . This is a direct function of the rate of profit or \u03a0 /k1K . Capital\n1 1 1 1 1\ninput increases can contribute to a fall in the rate of profit because of diminishing returns to capital input.\nThese effects are accentuated if the domestic producer maximizes revenue rather than profit. As the rate of\nprofit declines, it may become difficult to finance investment through equity. However investments can\nalso be driven by borrowing and \u2206K /K  is also an inverse function of the rate of interest, r .7 Thus inter-\n1 1 1\npreted, capital market distortions through reductions in the rate of interest to below equilibrium levels are\nnot inadvertent distortions, but the only way to sustain competitive advantage. These arguments also hold\nif there are imperfections in factor markets, with the caveat being the relevant elasticities become addi-\ntional variables.\n6\nExogenous because of perfect competition in factor markets. TFP increases is another possibility to neutralize wage increases.\n7\nHad intermediation possibilities not existed, retained earnings would have been the only option.", "28\nBibliography\nAsian Development Bank, 1997.
