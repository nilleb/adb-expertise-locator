INTRODUCTION \nThe reemergence of Asia as an economic powerhouse in recent decades owes much to the \nexpansion of its international trade. International trade even played a critical role in the \nregion\u2019s recovery from the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis. Asia\u2019s trade expansion has in turn \nbeen facilitated and encouraged by the development of supporting infrastructure, including \nboth physical (hard) and institutional (soft) infrastructure, and logistics services. From 1975 \nto 1995, developing Asia\u2019s port capacity increased from 3 million to 62 million TEU,1 an \naverage annual growth of over 15%. Airfreight shipments in the region increased roughly \n14% annually during the same period, from less than 2 billion to more than 30 billion ton-\nkilometers. Investment in infrastructure has been complemented in turn, and spurred, by \nforeign and domestic investment in productive capacity as well as by structural reforms that \nimprove the environment for investment, production, and trade.  \nInfrastructure services can reduce distribution margins, narrowing the gap between prices \nfaced by producers and consumers, thereby facilitating welfare improvements for both. On \nthe supply side, the expansion or improvement in quality of infrastructure services can lower \nmarginal  costs,  raising  the  minimum  efficient  scale  of  production,  transportation,  or \nmarketing. These lower costs and greater economies of scale raise the potential for initial or \nincreased sales to export markets, as well as domestic sales. Indeed, a significant part of \ninfrastructure\u2019s  contribution  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Asia  comes  through  its \nfacilitation  of  international  trade  expansion.  It  expands  both  the  scope  for  domestic \nabsorption  and  supply  to  export  markets,  while  stimulating  linkages  with  and  between \ndifferent sectors and industries, and providing incentives for innovation.  \nAsia is benefiting from market-driven integration, where large trade and foreign investment \nflows respond to infrastructure development, outward-oriented policies, and incorporation \ninto international production networks and regional cooperation frameworks. Both Asian and \nnon-Asian  multinational  corporations  have  developed  international  supply  chains  linking \ndifferent parts of the region and openness to foreign direct investment (FDI) has become the \nnorm. Financial integration has supported these developments by increasing access to credit \nand  innovative  financial  instruments.  Tariffs  and  quotas  have  been  reduced  through \nsuccessive rounds of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade (succeeded by the World Trade Organization [WTO]) and the recent plethora of \nbilateral and regional trade agreements. But infrastructure in many Asian countries is still \ninefficient,  if  not  inadequate.  Inability  to  transport  goods  and  people  efficiently  or  an \ninadequate power supply to operate machinery smoothly leads to microeconomic as well as \nmacroeconomic  imbalances.  In  this  economic  environment,  infrastructure-induced \nreductions in trade costs have become relatively more important than direct policy barriers \nas sources of further cost savings (Brooks, Roland-Holst, and Zhai 2005). \nEfficient infrastructure services lower transaction costs, raise value added, and increase \npotential profitability while increasing and expanding linkages to global supply chains and \ndistribution networks for producers, and a country that is more deeply involved in global \nproduction networks will likely benefit more from trade-related infrastructure investment than \none that is not. In a study incorporating threshold effects, Francois and Manchin (2006) \nfound that infrastructure is a key determinant not only of export levels, but also of the \nlikelihood  of  exporting  at  all.  Investments  in  expanding  and  upgrading  transport  and \ntelecommunications infrastructure figure prominently in this regard.  \nWhile trade and logistics infrastructure often evokes images of large-scale physical projects, \nsoft  (or  institutional)  infrastructure  is  equally  important.  A  supporting  environment  of \npredictable legal and judicial rights and procedures, equitable and enforceable competition \npolicy, and a sound but not unduly restrictive regulatory framework are crucial for physical \ninfrastructure investment to be efficient. Financial services, including financial intermediation, \n                                                 \n1 TEU is a standard measure of shipping volume and represents a twenty-foot equivalent unit. \n1 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nrisk management opportunities, and payment and clearing services are especially important \nfor facilitating international trade. Bond markets capable of supplying long term finance in \nlocal currencies ideally play a central role in infrastructure finance, but are still in an early \nstage of development in most of Asia.  \nCooperative efforts to broaden, deepen, and strengthen these markets throughout the region \nin support of greater trade are expanding dramatically. The international externalities that \narise as infrastructure services support cross-border trade flows indicate an important role \nfor regional cooperation to incorporate and maximize social benefits (Maur 2008). Regional \ncooperation in trade and logistics strengthens regional economic growth and integration, \nallowing  greater  regional  investment  in  cross-border  infrastructure  projects.  This  can \nperpetuate a virtuous cycle. \nII.  RECENT TRENDS IN ASIA\u2019S AGGREGATE TRADE2 \nExports from developing Asia and the Pacific accounted for about 24% of the world total in \n2005. East Asia alone accounted for more than 16% of world exports. Consequently, much \nof the dynamism of Asia\u2019s trade, and the impacts of infrastructure development and regional \ncooperation, can be seen by focusing on East Asia,3 a dynamic region in terms of trade and \neconomic growth. This region\u2019s economies have continued to become more exposed to \ninternational trade over the last decade, with merchandise exports increasing from 34% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to 42% in 2005, even while GDP was growing rapidly.  \nTable 1 presents the export value of East Asia and major comparator country groups for \nselected years over 1990 to 2005, along with their market shares in global trade. The \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is included both with the rest of East Asia and as a \ncomparator since it has been playing a particularly prominent role.  \nEast Asian exports accounted for over one fifth of the world\u2019s total exports in 2005. The \ngrowth in world market share of East Asian exports (from 13.0% in 1990 to 21.7% in 2005) \ncame mostly from East Asian intraregional trade (from 4.2% in 1990 to 9.1% in 2005 as \nshares  of  world  exports)  and  from  the  trade  between  PRC  and  the  other  East  Asian \neconomies (from 0.8% in 1990 to 2.9% in 2005 as shares of world exports). It was far \ngreater  than  that  for  any  of  the  comparator  groups.  The  export  value  of  East  Asian \nintraregional trade grew by 13.4% from 1990 to 2005, while East Asia\u2019s exports to PRC grew \nfaster, by 17.8% in the same period. In contrast, the world market share of North American \nTrade Free Agreement\u2019s (NAFTA) exports rose by no more than three percentage points \nfrom 1990 to 2000 and declined more than four percentage points from 2000 to 2005. The \nrelative importance of the European Union (EU) (15) was declining from 1990 to 2000 before \nslightly increasing from 2000 to 2005.  \nThe table shows that PRC is playing a more and more important role in world trade and in \nEast Asia trade. The share of PRC\u2019s exports in East Asia rose from less than 15% in 1990 to \nover 35% in 2005. The reemergence of PRC as an international trading power has had a \nmajor impact on the other economies of Asia, both as a competitor in world markets and as \na dynamic and growing market for the other Asian economies. \n                                                 \n2 Jinkang Zhang contributed substantially to this section. \n3 East Asia in this section refers to: Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Republic \nof Korea; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Myanmar; Philippines; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; Viet Nam.

Half of \nworld trade takes place between partners less than 3,000 kilometers apart (Berthelon and \nFreund 2004). Even so, for Asia only 1\u20135% of trade by value is with land-neighboring \ncountries. For trade with non-adjacent partners, nearly all merchandise trade moves via \nocean and air transport modes. The 10-fold decline in air shipping prices since the late \n1950s means that the cost of speed has fallen dramatically. Since the marginal cost of air \nshipping cargo per additional mile is falling rapidly, over time the average air shipment is \ntraversing a greater distance and the average ocean shipment is getting shorter (Hummels \n2007). \nIII.  INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRADE COSTS \nThe quantity of infrastructure investment, the quality of infrastructure services, and logistics \ncoordination of those services, influence trade performance (see e.g., Limao and Venables \n2001; Clark, Dollar, and Micco 2004). This occurs through impacts on pecuniary transaction \ncosts, loss, damage and spoilage to goods in transit, and timeliness of delivery, among other \nfactors.  \nNordas and Piermartini (2004) highlight four central aspects of the relationship between \ninfrastructure and trade transaction costs: \n1.  Direct monetary outlays on communications, business travel, freight, insurance, \nand logistics services are affected by the quality of infrastructure and the cost and \nquality of related services. \n2.  Timeliness, even more than freight rates, is likely to be influenced by geography \nand infrastructure. \n3.  Risk of damaged cargo and resulting increased losses and insurance costs is \nhigher when infrastructure quality is poor. \n4 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \n4.  Lack  of  access  to  transport  or  telecommunication  services  can  have  a  high \nopportunity cost, limiting market access and reducing the likelihood of realizing the \nfull benefits of trade. \nThe relative weights of different categories of trade costs that reflect different infrastructure \nservices can be surprising. As De (forthcoming 2009a) notes, in 2005 the ocean freight rate \nfor importing a container to India was about two thirds greater than for exporting. At the \nsame time, ocean freight for importing a container to PRC from six Asian countries was far \nlower than for exporting. Auxiliary shipping charges (documentation fees, container handling \ncharges, government taxes and levies, etc.) may account for much of this difference and are \nsometimes greater than the ocean freight charges, particularly where shipments experience \ncongestion at ports or borders. On average, auxiliary shipping charges outweigh terminal \nhandling charges across countries and commodities in Asia, with variation in such charges \ncontributing  significantly  to  variations  in  trade  costs.  Improvement  in  logistics  services, \nincluding cross-country coordination, may help to lower both the average cost and the \nvariability. This highlights one area of potential for regional cooperation in strengthening soft \ninfrastructure to contribute to lowering trade costs.  \nThe composition of freight charges also varies significantly across countries and commodity \ncategories. De finds that the share of total freight charges accounted for by inland freight is \nsometimes less than that of ocean freight, but is frequently greater. The actual balance \ndepends on the country, suggesting an inland focus for trade-related infrastructure priorities \nin those countries where the inland share is greater. A 10% reduction in transport costs \n(expressed as an ad valorem tax equivalent) would boost Asia\u2019s trade by about 3\u20134%  from \nwhat it would otherwise be. When trade is differentiated by commodity groups, the weight to \nvalue ratio is found to be the major determinant of transport cost, suggesting that road, rail, \nand sea may be the increasing order of modal preference for transporting heavier cargos.  \nHummels and Skiba (2004) similarly found that a 10% increase in the ratio of product weight \nto value results in a 4% increase in ad valorem shipping costs. Hummels (2007) notes that \nfrom 1960\u20132004, the real value of trade in manufactures grew about 1.5% per year faster \nthan the weight of non-bulk cargoes. If bulk commodities are included in the calculation, the \nreal value of all trade grew 1.8% faster per year than the weight of all trade. \nNote that an important component of transportation costs is the time cost involved. This is \nparticularly critical for perishable or other time-sensitive goods. Hummels (2001) found that \nthe time cost of one day in transit for US imports is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff rate of \n0.8%, implying the equivalent of a 16% tariff on an average trans-Pacific shipment of 20 \ndays. Clearly, improvements in infrastructure services that reduce delays in border crossing \nprocedures, transit times, or ports will influence a country\u2019s propensity to trade. Costs related \nto the time elapsed between the perception of demand and subsequent supply of products to \nthe  relevant  retailer(s)  can  also  figure  prominently  (Nordas  and  Piermartini  2004). \nDevelopments in containerization and multimodal transport networks with corresponding \nlogistics support are contributing to quicker delivery times and the growth in air shipments. \nWhen growth is very rapid, congestion results as the increase in traffic induced by the \neconomic growth outpaces the expansion of transportation infrastructure services. Ma and \nZhang (forthcoming 2009) find this to be the current situation in PRC. Sea port congestion \nthere results from the long neglect of access transport and port facilities infrastructure. Six \npercent of the world\u2019s rail lines struggle to move one-fourth of the world\u2019s rail freight turnover, \nand only 2% of the country\u2019s highway network is expressways. \nCongestion has been rising most notably at the port of Shanghai, as inefficiencies from \noverloading the physical infrastructure are compounded by a lack of collaboration among \ndifferent  stakeholders.  In  terms  of  soft  infrastructure,  reliability  of  trade  facilitation  and \nadministrative procedures at customs are crucial, including rationalization of the customs \ntransit  system  in  order  to  reduce  inspection  time  and  simplify  declarations  and  the \ndocumentation process. Meanwhile, Shanghai\u2019s congestion is reducing its competitiveness \n5 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nrelative to nearby ports in neighboring economies, endangering its status as a hub and \ngateway to international markets and suppliers. In recent years, the number of transshipped \ncontainers from Shanghai via Hong Kong, China have accounted for as much as 20% of the \ntotal container throughput of Shanghai.  \nLimited infrastructure connections to western regions in PRC result in high trade costs for \ninland regions and impede regionally balanced growth. As land and labor costs rise near \ncoasts,  investors  look  to  locate  production  facilities  farther  inland.  However,  they  are \nhampered by insufficient or poor quality infrastructure connections that raise transportation \ncosts to and from those areas. This has led to a shift in infrastructure policy emphasis to give \ngreater weight to hinterland access. Railway construction is crucial for inland provinces, \nwhere a greater share of production is of bulk commodities. At the same time, the lack of a \nseamless logistics management system adds to delays in use of multimodal transportation \nsystems in inland areas, where they may be most valuable. \nInfrastructure inland from the border can have as much effect on the length and variability of \ntime-to-market as freight services between countries. This is especially true in large or \nlandlocked countries, and the proliferation of inland dry ports has evolved partly in response. \nLimao  and  Venables  (2001)  found  that  domestic  infrastructure  explains  about  40%  of \ntransport  costs  for  coastal  countries,  while  domestic  and  transit  country  infrastructure \ntogether  account  for  an  estimated  60%  of  transport  costs  for  landlocked  countries. \nFurthermore, land transport is about seven times more costly than sea transport over similar \ndistances, and estimates of the elasticity of trade flows with respect to transport costs range \nfrom -2 to -3.5, suggesting that lowering a landlocked country\u2019s trade costs by 10% through \nregional cooperation for infrastructure development could increase its exports by over 20%. \nDe (forthcoming 2009b) finds that inland transport cost is the major component of overall \ntrade transportation costs in South Asia, accounting for about 88% of the total. Inland costs \nare very high across South Asian countries, except in Sri Lanka, and vary across goods and \ncountries, being even higher when countries are landlocked. Land border crossings are \novercrowded, and greater policy attention to efficiency concerns could easily reduce delays \nand  monetary  costs.  Complex  border-crossing  requirements  expand  possibilities  for \ncorruption and have encouraged sharp growth in informal trade. The border effects in South \nAsia and its low share of intraregional trade argue strongly for cooperative improvements in \nsoft infrastructure complemented by inland transportation infrastructure, to raise exporters\u2019 \ncompetitiveness. \nIV.  EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF TRADE COSTS \nEmpirical assessments of trade costs are most frequently derived through estimation of a \ngravity equation. An excellent survey of trade cost estimation can be found in Anderson and \nvan Wincoop (2004). They estimated that the tax equivalent of representative international \ntrade costs is about 74% for industrialized countries, including 21% transportation costs and \n44% border-related costs.4 Costs for developing countries can be much higher. \nDe (2008) estimates a modified gravity equation for eight sectors in 10 Asian countries, \ncontrolling for distance, to examine the effects of both policy and non-policy barriers to trade. \nIn this framework, infrastructure quality and transport costs, along with tariffs, are found to be \nthe main determinants of cross-country variations in trade flows. Infrastructure interventions \nthat reduce the costs of international trade are therefore crucial for the region to fully realize \nthe gains from recent and prospective trade policy liberalization. \nThere is often skepticism as to the extent to which the benefits of trade-related infrastructure \nin developing countries accrue to the poor. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is \na poor, landlocked, rugged, mountainous country with generally low quality roads. The \n                                                 \n4 The costs are not simply additive. The total is 1.44*1.21-1=0.74. \n6 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \npoorest people often reside far from urban centers and are the most disadvantaged by the \nhigh transport costs resulting from bad roads. Inadequate or substandard roads present an \nobstacle to realizing the potential benefits for rural residents from recent economic reforms \nand  international  trade.  Menon  and  Warr  (2008)  use  a  general  equilibrium  modeling \napproach to assess the impact of rural road improvements on the incidence of poverty. They \ndifferentiate rural villages into three categories based on the quality of road access available: \n(i) no vehicular access, (ii) dry season only access, and (iii) all weather access. Although \nroad improvement in all three categories reduces poverty, the type of road improvement \ndetermines the magnitude of the impact. When areas with no vehicle access are provided \nwith dry season access roads, the reduction in poverty incidence is about 17 times that \nwhich occurs when roads suitable only for dry season access are upgraded to all weather \naccess roads, and the effect on GDP is about six times as great. Thus, enabling transport of \ntraded goods for households without initial road access is highly pro-poor compared to road \nimprovement for households already having dry season road access to markets.  \nThe  way  in  which  road  infrastructure,  whether  domestic  or  cross  border,  affects  trade \noperates  mainly  through  reductions  in  transport  costs,  which  also  underlie  the  poverty \nimpact. Furthermore, reductions in transport costs have an indirect positive impact on FDI \ninflows by reducing transaction costs in intra-firm vertical integration that is designed to \nexploit  countries\u2019  comparative  cost  advantages.  Increases  in  FDI,  in  turn,  can  further \nincrease regional trade, and add to the direct effect of reduced transport costs achieved \nthrough  improvements  in  road  infrastructure  near  border  areas.  When  such  gains  are \npresent, this reduces tendencies towards production agglomeration. If the advantages of \nproduction  integration  across  economies  outweigh  those  from  agglomeration,  then \nreductions in transport costs make FDI complementary to trade. This defines a virtuous cycle \nof cross-border infrastructure development, trade, and investment that fosters increased \ntrade and economic growth. \nEdmonds and Fujimura (2008) investigate the impacts of infrastructure development on \ntrade and FDI, focusing on both domestic and cross-border infrastructure in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). They estimate gravity models using panel data from 1981 to \n2003 for trade and FDI flows between each pair of the six GMS countries. The results show \nthat the quality of road infrastructure in border areas between economies has a positive and \nstatistically significant relationship with trade flows between them, and that this relationship \nis particularly strong when both cross-border and general domestic road infrastructure are \nincluded in the estimates. They also find that cross-border roads have distinct effects from \ndomestic road infrastructure, suggesting that investments in cross-border infrastructure have \nan independent and important role to play in the promotion of regional trade and may \ntherefore justify cooperative development of this infrastructure. \nCross-border  road  infrastructure  was  estimated  to  have  a  positive  but  not  statistically \nsignificant association with FDI. The weak relationship could be due to data shortcomings, \nsince the number of countries reporting FDI flows at disaggregated levels is limited. Despite \nthese data limitations, there is some evidence of a positive trade-FDI nexus in which FDI \ncontributes to export growth from FDI-recipient economies.  \nV.  TRADE FACILITATION \nReductions in trade costs resulting from infrastructure improvements or expansion are one \nform of trade facilitation, but trade facilitation can be defined in many ways. In the context of \nthe WTO, it primarily refers to simplifying or speeding up administrative documentation \nprocedures at border crossings. In broader usage, it includes measures taken by both public \nand private sectors, reduction in nontariff barriers, and improvements in physical facilities to \nsmooth the movement of shipments by reducing time in transit. Thus, it may encompass \nboth hard and soft infrastructure that facilitates trade. \n7 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nDee, Findlay and Pomfret (2008) include all factors affecting time and money costs of \nmoving goods across international borders in the scope of trade facilitation. The success of \nreforms to facilitate trade depends on their impact on both rent-creating and cost-creating \ninfluences. Use of price-cost margins to measure performance helps identify rent-creating \nbarriers,  while  use  of  cost  or  productivity  as  performance  measures  can  identify  cost-\ncreating barriers. The identification is important in designing policy responses since the \ntreatment effect (as rent-raising or cost-raising) can dominate other factors in the estimated \nheight of trade barriers. They use antimonde estimation, in which a measure of economic \nperformance is estimated for the counterfactual case with no nontariff barriers in a market to \nquantify the extent to which nontariff barriers lead to vertical shifts in demand or supply \ncurves with consequent effects on costs and prices. \nAmong different indicators of infrastructure services\u2019 contributions to trade, port efficiency \nhas the  largest influence,  reflecting  the fact  that the  vast  bulk  of  trade  (by  weight)  is \ntransported by sea. Infrastructure improvements that raise port efficiency from the 25th to the \n75th  percentile  can  reduce  shipping costs  by  more  than  10% (Clark  et  al.  2004).  The \ndominance of sea freight over land transport and the associated cost savings emphasize the \nimportance of transit arrangements for landlocked countries attempting to compete in global \nmarkets, as well as the importance of improving port efficiency in countries with amenable \ncoastal areas.  \nIncreasing  port  efficiency  complements  technological  changes  in  shipping  that  yield \neconomies of scale. Larger, faster ships and containerization reduce average shipment time \nat sea and in ports. Estimates by Hummels (2007) show that increasing the share of trade \nthat is containerized by 1% lowers shipping costs from 3\u201313%. In addition, trade growth \nalong  a  particular  shipping  route  promotes  entry,  with  new  competition  driving  down \ntransportation markups. In 2006 one out of six importer-exporter pairs was served by a \nsingle liner service; over half were served by three or fewer (Hummels et al. 2007). Service \nalso becomes more frequent, facilitating timely delivery, and a densely traded route allows \nfor effective use of hub and spoke arrangements, in which small container vessels feed \nshipments  into  a  hub  where  containers  are  aggregated  into  much  larger  and  faster \ncontainerships for longer hauls. \nHaveman et al. (forthcoming 2009) show for a subsample of Asian ports that specific \ninfrastructure investments are highly correlated with reductions in port costs. While Penang \n(Malaysia) currently has the lowest costs of ports studied, Mumbai experienced the greatest \nimprovement in relative costs between 1997 and 2005. Operating with a new harbor, wharf, \nor terminal is estimated to decrease port costs by 2% while procurement of a new crane \ndecreases port costs 1%. Increasing the number of berths at ports or deepening channels \nhave less effect.  \nNot  only  do  investments  in  port  infrastructure,  and  especially  the  procurement  of  new \ncranes, lower costs and raise efficiency for current trade flows, they can also increase port \ncapacity  to  handle  new  flows  and  influence  the  composition  of  trade.  Port  costs  vary \nsignificantly across products even at a single port, and new infrastructure can, for example, \ndifferentially influence the costs for loading/unloading containers versus bulk commodities. \nStandardized containers yield cost savings by allowing goods to be packed once and moved \nover long distances via a combination of transport modes\u2014truck, rail, ocean liner, rail, then \ntruck  again\u2014without  being  unpacked  and  repacked.  Given  the  inherent  advantages  in \ncontainerization for certain product categories, relevant port infrastructure developments can \nreduce unit costs further as the container share of trade rises.  \nChanges  in  the  composition  of  trade,  mode  of  product packing  (container  or  bulk,  for \nexample), and the capacity expansion effect of new port infrastructure all influence the \npotential profitability, and hence bankability, of port infrastructure investments. In planning \nport expansion or improvement projects, both the efficiency and capacity effects need to be \naccounted for in projecting potential benefits. This is true for sea-, dry-, and airports. \n8 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) is an increasingly productive complement \nto physical transportation infrastructure. The quality of communication infrastructure services \nis not only strongly correlated with search costs, but also with costs of entering into contracts \nwith suppliers, monitoring implementation of those contracts, and monitoring the location and \nstatus of shipments.  \nFink, Matoo, and Neagu (2002) find that the cost of making a telephone call has a significant \nand negative effect on bilateral trade flows. In addition, the costs of telecommunications \nhave a greater effect on trade of differentiated products than on trade of homogeneous \nproducts, highlighting the value of ICT infrastructure at the dynamic extensive margin of \ntrade. In particular, as the number of smaller shipments of a wider variety of higher value \nadded products rises, the demand for ICT infrastructure services rises. \nThe  same  is  true  as  growth  in  trade  of  services  outpaces  merchandise  trade  growth. \nInfrastructure, especially telecommunications infrastructure, is particularly important for trade \nin  services,  where  the  main  services  traded  (banking  and  business  services, \ncommunications, etc.) are highly dependent on well-developed infrastructure in both the \nexporting and importing countries (Nicoletti, Golub, Hajkova, Mirza, and Yoo 2003). Given \nthe huge value of ICT infrastructure demanded, it is fortunate that ICT is an infrastructure \nsector which the private sector is especially adept at innovating, expanding, and financing, \nwhile the need for mutually interfacing logistics services at both ends of the trade route \npoints to an area for regional cooperation to capitalize on informational externalities in \nenhancing trade. \nVI.  OVERVIEW OF ASIA\u2019S INFRASTRUCTURE \nGiven the importance of transportation, energy, and ICT infrastructure in Asia\u2019s trade and \nregional cooperation, this section briefly reviews the status of these infrastructure areas. \nA.  Transport Infrastructure \nTransport infrastructure development varies across countries in the region. Some countries \nshow a progressive pattern while others suffer a declining trend. In 2004, developing Asia\u2019s \ntotal road network covered 7.4 million kilometers, of which 65.3% was paved (Appendix \nTable A.1).5 While East and Southeast Asia have improved the coverage of paved roads, \nCentral and West Asia, which had the highest proportion of paved roads to total road \nnetwork  in  1996,  experienced  a  decline.  From  1996  to  2004,  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia \nsuffered a steep decline in coverage of paved roads, from 93.9% to 49.4% and from 93.5% \nto  39.4%,  respectively  (Appendix  Table  A.2),  mainly  due  to  poor  maintenance  and \ninsufficient budget for upgrading existing road networks. As of 2005, approximately 50\u201370% \nof  road  networks  in  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia  were  in  poor  condition  and  required \nrehabilitation (Ziyadov 2008; World Bank 2008). On the other hand, East and Southeast \nAsian economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, China improved the coverage of \npaved roads to 100%. Several countries with a low proportion of initial paved roads did not \nshow any improvement.  \nAlthough East and Southeast Asia are increasing their coverage of paved roads, the quality \nof road network is still much lower than in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries. Figure 2 shows that Asia has significantly lower road length \nper one million people (perhaps reflecting higher population density in Asia) road density per \n1,000km2 of land than the OECD average. \n                                                 \n5 This excludes the Pacific due to lack of data. \n9 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nFigure 2: Road Network Indicators, by Region, 1996 and 2004  \n2\nRoad per 1,000km  of land area\n1800\n1600\n1400\ns 1200\nr\ne\nt 1000\ne\nm\n800\no\nKil 600\n400\n200\n0\nEast Asia Central and South Asia Southeast Other OECD World\nWest Asia developing\nRoad per 1 million people, by region, 1996 and 2004\n25000\n20000\ns\ner 15000\nt\ne\nm\nilo 10000\nK\n5000\n0\nEast Asia Central and South Asia Southeast Other OECD World\nWest Asia developing\n1996 2004\n \nSource: World Development Indicators 2007 \nThe  region\u2019s  rail  network  totaled  182  thousand  kilometers,  or  around  two  fifths  of  the \nOECD\u2019s 472 thousand kilometers in 2005 (Appendix Table A.3).

This \nindicates that limited new rail routes were created while existing routes were not maintained. \nArmenia, Georgia, Pakistan and Viet Nam experienced declines in kilometers of rail routes. \nCommon reasons for the poor maintenance are insufficient budget, lack of awareness of the \nfull potential benefits of railways, and inadequate management of railway authorities.  \nThe volume of goods transported by railway increased dramatically worldwide during 1996\u2013\n2005,  with  Asia  recording  an  increase  of  about  50%  (Appendix  Table  A.3).  Among \nsubregions,  Central  and  West  Asian  rail  transport  grew  the  highest  at  85%.  Data  by \nindividual country shows a varying trend (Appendix Table A.5). Hong Kong, China\u2019s goods \ntransported  by rail  decreased  by more  than  four times  while  Mongolia and  Azerbaijan \nincreased rail freight by about four times. Hong Kong, China\u2019s fall in the volume of rail freight \nmay reflect less concentrated flows of bulk raw materials or fewer long-distance routes which \ngive rise to heavy rail freight flows, and good infrastructure for other modes of transportation \nfor its international trade. Conversely, railways are the main transportation mode for trade in \n11 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nheavy bulk commodities from landlocked countries like Mongolia, where an increase in the \nvolume of rail freight mainly reflects an increase in the volume of trade.  \nAir transport increased faster in Asia than in the rest of the world during 1996\u20132005. Goods \nand passengers carried by air doubled in the region, with the highest increase (about three-\nfold) taking place in East Asia (Appendix Table A.4). Central and West Asia and the Pacific \nlag behind the other subregions in terms of airport infrastructure, as shown in the individual \ncountry data provided in Table A.6. Several countries in Central and West Asia and the \nPacific such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands had low and \ndeclining air transport.  \nSea  transport,  by  which  most  merchandise  moves  internationally,  also  increased \ndramatically in the region in recent years (Appendix Table A.7). The world\u2019s largest three \nshipbuilding countries are Republic of Korea (1); Japan (2) and PRC (3), accounting for \napproximately 86% of the world total (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) 2005). Appendix Table A.7 illustrates the increasing trend \nin sea transportation across countries.  \nIn general, transport infrastructure has been improving in the region over the last few \ndecades. However, transportation of people and goods across different types of transport \nmodes is not evenly developed in many Asian and Pacific countries (UNESCAP 2006). \nCountries with maritime coastlines are more oriented towards their major seaports and \ninternal  land  transport  systems  are  not  always  properly  linked,  due  to  a  lack  of \ncomprehensive policies joining different transportation modes and logistics networks.  \nB.  Energy Infrastructure \nIn 2004, the region (excluding Pacific due to lack of data) produced 4,057 billion kWh of \nelectric power and consumed 3,630 billion kWh of electricity (Appendix Table A.8). Although \nboth electricity production and consumption almost doubled the levels of 1996, Asia still \nremains  below  OECD  levels.  Figure  4  illustrates  the  level  of  per  capita  electricity \nconsumption by region.  \nFor individual countries, Appendix Tables A.9 and A.10 demonstrate a wide diversity of \nelectricity production and consumption balances in the region. Economies such as Hong \nKong, China; Republic of Korea; and Singapore have electricity consumption per capita of \nmore than 5000 kWh while Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and \nMyanmar experience less than 500 kWh of electricity consumption per capita. In terms of \nelectric power production, PRC alone generates more than half the region\u2019s total electricity.  \n12 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nFigure 4: Electric Power Consumption Per Capita, KWh \nElectric power consumption per capita, kWh\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\nh\nW 6,000\nk\n4,000\n2,000\n0\nEast Asia Central and South Asia Southeast Other OECD World\nWest Asia Asia developing\n1996 2004\n \nSource: World Development Indicators 2007 \nIn 2004, the region produced 24% of the world\u2019s electricity, up by seven percentage points \nfrom the 1996 level (Appendix Table A.10). However, by subregion only East Asia accounted \nfor a notable increase in electric power production, while other regions showed a minor \nincrease or no change in their world shares.  \nIn terms of energy resources, the region has considerable fossil fuel resources, accounting \nfor 7%, 12%, and 32% of global oil, natural gas, and coal reserves, respectively, in 2006 \n(Table 2). However, some countries are net exporters while others are net importers. Central \nand West Asia has substantial oil and natural gas reserves whereas East and South Asian \ncountries are endowed with rich reserves in coal. The largest reserves are concentrated in a \nfew countries, with PRC, Kazakhstan, and India together accounting for 98% of the total coal \nreserves in the region in 2006 and Kazakhstan alone having almost the half the region\u2019s oil \nreserves (Appendix Table A.15).  \nTable 2: Proven Energy Reserves, by percentage, 2006 \n   Region  Oil  Gas  Coal \nDeveloping Asia  7  12  32 \n  East Asia  1  1  13 \n  Central and West  4  6  5 \n  The Pacific  ..  0  .. \n  South Asia  0  1  13 \n  Southeast Asia  1  4  1 \nOther developing  87 80 32 \nOECD  6  9  37 \n         \nWorld  100  100  100 \nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported.

Most of the energy production and consumption occurred in East Asia and to a lesser \nextent in South Asia, due to high demand for energy in the larger emerging economies such \nas PRC and India. Asia\u2019s energy infrastructure therefore faces a critical challenge to meet \nincreasing demand for energy and imported energy or fuel is likely to become increasingly \nimportant in planning for infrastructure facilities.  \nTable 3: Total Energy Production and Consumption, by percentage, 2001 \n      Total Energy  \n   Region  Production  Consumption \nDeveloping Asia  23 25 \n  East Asia  11 13 \n  Central and West  3 2 \n  South Asia  5 6 \n  Southeast Asia  4 4 \n       \nWorld  100 100 \nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported.

Both export and import shares of fossil fuels \nincreased from their 1990 levels. By subregion, Southeast Asia exported almost half of \nAsia\u2019s fuel exports while East Asia\u2019s energy imports accounted for half of Asia\u2019s total energy \nimports. But the pattern differs by type of fossil fuel (Appendix Tables A.16\u2013A.19). \nTable 4: Total Fossil Fuel Trade, Thousand Tons of Oil Equivalent \n   Region  Exports    Imports   \n      1990  2003   1990 2003   \nDeveloping Asia  9 13   11 20   \n  East Asia  2 3   4 9   \n  Central and West  0 3   0 1   \n  South Asia  0 0   2 3   \n  Southeast Asia  7 7   5 6   \nOther developing  59 59   12 15   \nOECD  31 28   77 66   \n               \nTotal  100 100   100 100   \nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported.

Kazakhstan, with the \ngreatest oil reserves in the region, alone constituted approximately 20% of Asia\u2019s total oil \nexports. Almost all of the region\u2019s natural gas exports occurred from Central, West, and \nSoutheast Asia, with Turkmenistan and Indonesia contributing 33% and 32%, respectively. \nOn the other hand, East Asia took up half of developing Asia\u2019s natural gas imports (Appendix \nTable A.21). East and Southeast Asia were the main source of coal exports, accounting for \nabout 90% of Asia\u2019s coal exports in 2003. While a major coal exporter, East Asia also \nimports  65%  of  Asia\u2019s  coal  imports,  of  which  Republic  of  Korea  alone  imports  50% \n(Appendix Table A.22).  \n14 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nThe share in energy consumption of industry declined in the world over recent years while \nthat in transportation remained more or less the same. The transportation sector in Asia \nuses less energy than the world average but, in absolute terms, the twofold growth of energy \nconsumption in transportation in Asia was the highest in the world, compared to the world \naverage of around 1.3\u20131.7 times during 1990\u20132003 (Appendix Table A.23). \nAsian and Pacific countries need to invest in electricity generating capacity and transmission \nand distribution networks to sustain their current growth rates. The region has considerable \ncommercial  and  renewable  energy  resources.  This  provides  an  opportunity  for  trans-\nboundary energy cooperation in utilizing these resources to achieve shared benefits for the \ncountries involved. There are also further opportunities to increase generation of electric \npower using natural gas or hydropower in the region.  \nC.  ICT Infrastructure \nA total of 1.2 billion people in the region subscribed to telephone service in 2005, almost \nnine times that in 1996 (Appendix Table A.11). Despite this dramatic increase, the region still \nlags  behind  OECD  levels.  East  Asia  showed  the  highest  telephone  density  among \nsubregions whereas the Pacific had the lowest at 119 subscribers, about eight times lower \nthan the East Asia\u2019s level (Appendix Table A.11). Except for East Asia, all subregions \nsuffered lower telephone density than non-Asian developing counterparts. The pattern also \nholds when comparing telephone coverage by mobile and fixed line phones.  \nThe number of internet users has increased dramatically all over the world, increasing 10 \ntimes  during  1996\u20132005  (Appendix  Table  A.12).  The  average  increase  in  Asia  was  a \nremarkable more than 200 times during the period whereas OECD countries experienced \nonly a four times increase. However, some quality indicators such as internet users per \n1,000 people, secure internet servers, and internet speed are still much lower in developing \nAsia than in OECD countries (Appendix Table A.13).  \nVII.  SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE \nIn addition to the administrative aspects of trade facilitation, other forms of soft infrastructure \ninfluence international trade. These include (among others) availability of adequate credit \nand foreign exchange at reasonable rates, a reliable system of legal recourse, effective \ncompetition policy, and the capacity of existing human capital to process exchanges. Indeed, \nsoft infrastructure may often be more important than physical infrastructure for increasing \ntrade and its profitability.  \nInefficient  or  burdensome  institutional  structures,  bureaucracy,  and  policy  may  lead  to \nreduced or foregone gains from international trade. During 2006\u20132007, most developing \nAsian countries were actively reforming their trade policies, with India being the top reformer. \nIndia introduced an online declaration system for imports and exports, reducing the time to \ntrade (World Bank 2007). On average, producers in the region spend about one month to \nexport whereas exporting takes only 10 days for their OECD counterparts. By subregion, \nCentral and West Asia is still costlier than the rest of Asia although some countries such as \nArmenia are continuously reforming to make trading across borders easier (Table 5). The \npattern is similar for importing, with time and cost to import being slightly higher than \nexporting in the region (Table A.14).  \n15 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nTable 5: Costs of Exporting, by Region, 2006\u20132007 \n   Region  Documents for Import   Time for Import   Cost to Import  \n      (number)  (days)  (US$ per container) \nDeveloping Asia and the \nPacific       \n  East Asia  7  25  1,224 \n  Central and West  11  58  2,511 \n  The Pacific  8  28  1,112 \n  South Asia  9  28  1,318 \n  Southeast Asia  8  24  828 \nOther developing  8  33  1,522 \nOECD1  5  10  997 \n         \nWorld2  8  30  1,430 \nNote: 1 Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, and Republic of Korea are not included  \nin OECD average as they are grouped into developing countries.

Sea port competitiveness may suffer from \npoor physical infrastructure such as inadequate channel depth, shortage of berths, and \nlimited cargo handling equipment, storage and transit areas, but it may also suffer from \nlimitations in soft infrastructure, such as labor skills, regulation, bureaucracy, and other \ninstitutional factors affecting port capacity utilization. Lack of direct competition between \nports controlled by the same government authority is also a critical factor. \nExploiting complementarity of hard and soft infrastructure raises overall trade and economic \nperformance. This is especially noticeable in the case of networks. Many communication and \ninfrastructure services that are important for economic development and trade expansion \nexhibit network externalities. Infrastructure networks exhibiting service externalities include \ntelephones, railways, and water supply systems (for more information,  see Laffont and \nTirole 2000). In the presence of such externalities, the maximum amount that consumers are \nwilling to pay for a good or service depends in part on the number of other consumers who \nalso purchase the item in question. This interrelationship calls for consideration of these \nnetwork systems\u2019 governance in competition policy.  \nInfrastructure improvements generally have the positive effect on competition of applying \nequally to both foreign and domestic entrants. This is particularly true when infrastructure \nimprovements are complemented by effective competition policy that constrains monopoly \npower and removes barriers to entry (Brooks 2005). Hummels et al. (2007) demonstrate that \nocean liners charge freight rates that are much higher for goods whose import demand is \nrelatively inelastic, indicating that shipping firms were likely exercising market power. \nVIII.  INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRADE PATTERNS \nA notable feature of developing Asia\u2019s intraregional trade is the growing volume of shipments \nof  parts  and  components  across  national  borders.  Fragmentation  of  production  supply \nchains and sourcing raw and intermediate inputs from wherever costs (including incurred \ntrade costs) are lowest has yielded benefits for both producers and consumers, as well as \ntax revenues for government budgets. To compete for larger shares in these benefits, \ncountries have been striving to lower their costs by increasing the quantity and quality of \n16 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \ninfrastructure services to support the production, distribution, and international trade of a \nwidening array of intermediate goods and services. \nHummels (forthcoming 2009) looks at four types of recent changes in the composition of \ntrade and their effects on demand for transportation: (1) changes in the ratio of weight to \nvalue of traded goods, (2) demand for timeliness and the shift towards increased air shipping, \n(3) new trade flows (both of products and geographical routes) and variation in the size of \nshipments,  and  (4)  production  fragmentation.  The  relationships  are  complex  since  the \ndevelopments  are  interlinked.  For  example,  declining  weight/value  ratios  and  vertical \nspecialization in the fragmentation of new production supply chains generate new trade \nflows and patterns which spur the rapid growth in Asian air cargo shipments. \nWhen infrastructure development lowers the marginal cost of trade, there can be increases \nin exports at both the extensive and intensive margins. The expansion at the extensive \nmargin (of new products, to new destinations), typically through small shipments from small \nfirms, influences the types of infrastructure demanded differently than does the deepening of \nexisting trade flows. This is especially true for transportation infrastructure demand. ICT may \nalso be of particular importance in establishing and consolidating new markets. When the \nnew markets are inland, air transport may be a viable alternative to a combination of sea and \nland freight to avoid and reduce potential port congestion, noting that the shipping time \nsavings are positively correlated with the shipping distances involved.  \nFigure 5: Intraregional Trade (% of total exports) \n60.0%\n50.0%\n40.0%\n30.0%\n20.0%\n10.0%\n0.0%\nSub-Saharan East Asia (15) SAARC MERCOSUR (10)\nAfrica*\n* 1998\n1995 2003\n \nSources: World Bank African Database 2005, Asian Development Bank 2006, International Monetary Fund, Direction \nof Trade Statistics 2006. \nAs infrastructure expanded in Asia, particularly in East Asia, trade costs fell and altered the \ncomparative  advantages  of  countries  in  the  region,  making  greater  fragmentation  of \nproduction  supply  chains  possible  and  spurring  the  region\u2019s  intraregional  trade  in \nintermediate products. The subsequent economic integration in East Asia is sharply higher \nthan in other developing regions (Figure 5). When inputs are being sourced from wherever \ncosts are lowest and the production process increasingly dispersed geographically, then \ntimeliness and reliability of delivery become critical factors and the influence of both physical \nand institutional infrastructure services is even more apparent. In support of its production \nfragmentation, East Asia\u2019s performance again stands out relative to other developing regions \n(Table 6). \n17 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nTable 6: Border Trade Costs \n Item  Sub-Saharan East Asia  South Asia  Latin America \nAfrica  & Caribbean \nDocuments for export  8.2  6.9  8.1  7.3 \n(number) \nTime for export  40  23.9  34.4  22.2 \nCost to export (US$ per  1,561  885  1,236  1,068 \ncontainer) \nDocuments for import  12.2  9.3  12.5  9.5 \n(number) \nTime for import (days)  51.5  25.9  41.5  27.9 \nCost to import (US$ per  1,947  1,037  1,495  1,226 \ncontainer) \nSource: World Bank 2008. \nInfrastructure  influences  not  only  absolute,  but  comparative,  advantage.  Differences \nbetween countries in the quality of infrastructure services help to explain differences in total \nfactor productivity. These impacts on productivity vary across sectors, depending on how \nintensively each sector uses infrastructure services and how reliant it is on good quality \ninfrastructure  services  (and  the  availability  of  alternative  production  processes).  Thus, \npatterns of specialization and trade are determined in part by the influence of infrastructure \nservice quality on comparative advantage. Moreover, limitations in factor endowments may \nbe  mitigated  by  infrastructure  services,  also  affecting  the  dynamics  of  comparative \nadvantage.  Under  different  conditions,  infrastructure  services  may  serve  either  as \ncomplements to, or substitutes for, physical inputs. The significance of factor endowments in \ndetermining comparative advantage may thus be modified by infrastructure development \n(Brooks and Leuterio 1997; Yeaple and Golub 2002).  \nThe surge in oil prices during 2008 raised shipping (and therefore import) costs, shifting the \nbalance in favor of domestic producers and inflation. Such changes as this can have a \ndouble or greater impact on products in international supply chains as both imported inputs \nand exported final products register higher prices. For example, PRC steel exported to the \nUS and produced with iron ore imported from Brazil would be hit twice by higher fuel \ncharges. The impact is greater where the goods (or their imported components) are shipped \nby air or have a high weight-to-value ratio and therefore where fuel accounts for a higher \nshare of freight costs. \nMalaysia is a prime example of a country where the government has actively promoted \ninfrastructure  development  in  order  to  strengthen  its  competitive  and  comparative \nadvantage.  Since  the  mid-1980s,  Malaysia  has  pursued  a  FDI-led,  export-oriented \ndevelopment strategy, with FDI contributing to the economy\u2019s integration in global production \nnetworks. As Tham, Devadason, and Heng (forthcoming 2009) point out, foreign firms have \nbeen attracted to Malaysia as a key link in global supply chains by the country\u2019s competitive \nlocational advantages, which in turn are closely linked to its infrastructure development and \nresulting high quality services. Institutional infrastructure at the macroeconomic level, in the \nform of exchange rate policy, has also played an important role. \nTham et al. elucidate the role of infrastructure in attracting export-oriented FDI by observing \nFDI\u2019s sectoral and locational pattern and through interviews with local managers of foreign \nfirms\u2019 subsidiaries involved in international trade. The location of FDI is shown to be biased \ntoward  areas  with  relatively  good  infrastructure  and  amenities.  Thus,  infrastructure \nimprovements increase the chances of attracting FDI, which in Asia has frequently been \ndirected toward export sectors, in turn, influencing patterns and quantities of imported raw \nmaterials and intermediate inputs.  \n18 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nAmiti and Javorcik (2006) find that market and supplier access are the most important \nfactors affecting foreign entry, and have about four times as great an effect as production \ncosts on choice of foreign investment location. In particular they find that in PRC, access to \nmarkets and suppliers within the province of entry matters more than access to the rest of \nthe country, consistent with observed market fragmentation. An increase of one standard \ndeviation in the number of sea berths is found to increase foreign entry by about 11%, while \na  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  length  of  rail  lines  increases  it  by  7%.  This \nreinforces the observation that provinces with more developed ports, and to a lesser extent a \nmore  developed  rail  network,  tend  to  attract  greater  FDI  flows.  Over  time,  however, \ncongestion,  security  concerns,  connectivity  of  airports,  and  delays  in  processing  trade \ndocumentation may reduce the positive impact of infrastructure on lowering trade costs for \nforeign investors. \nIX.  LOGISTICS \nSuccessful production and trade networks demand superior logistics services and centers \nsuch as Singapore; Taipei,China; Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Thailand; \nand  PRC  have  built  well  developed  logistics  systems  to  facilitate  international  and \nintraregional trade. However, these logistics systems are still evolving and will come under \nincreasing strains as concentrations of economic activities expand inland. While East Asia\u2019s \ninternational logistics performs relatively well compared to other developing regions, South \nAsia\u2019s does not. And even East Asia\u2019s performance is still well behind that of high income \ncountries (Figure 6). \nFigure 6: International Logistics Performance Index \nLPI\nAll high income countries\nSouth Asia\nSub-Saharan Africa\nMiddle East & North Africa\nLatin America & Caribbean\nEast Asia & Pacific\nEurope & Central Asia\n2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n \nNote: International LPI mainly reflects infrastructure, customs, international shipments, logistics competence, tracking \n& tracing, domestic logistics costs, timeliness, etc. \nSource: World Bank 2007a. \nReducing process time and its variability in fragmented production processes depends on \nintegrated logistics infrastructure. This can be crucial in sectors such as fashion clothing or \nauto parts where the use of just-in-time production and delivery processes are widespread. \nSeveral country specific studies suggest that inland locations would impose a large logistic \nburden: for example, almost 63% of the cost of transporting goods from Chongqing in the \nPRC to the west coast of the US is incurred before the goods arrive at the PRC port for \nexport (Carruthers and Bajpai 2002). The deficiencies of Central Asian transport systems\u2014\nhigh costs coupled with low quality transport and logistics services\u2014have meant that close \nto 20% of the value of traded goods is accounted for by transport costs. A 20% reduction in \nlogistics costs would increase the trade to GDP ratio by more than 10% in Cambodia, Lao \n19 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nPDR, and PRC; over 15% in Mongolia; and by more than 20% in Papua New Guinea \n(Carruthers and Bajpai 2002).  \nThe  challenges  of  providing  efficient  logistical  support  rise  as  countries  move  into \nprogressively more complex and higher-value manufacturing, and as production processes \nbecome increasingly fragmented. As new countries and regions join these supply chains and \nAsian  production  networks  expand  over  a  larger  and  more  diffuse  space,  logistics \nrequirements  become  more  sophisticated  and  demanding,  increasing  pressure  on \nunderlying infrastructure, both hard and soft. Already there is a premium on timeliness and \nreliability of delivery, care and security in handling and transporting, and certification and \nstandardization of product quality. Both the quantity and quality of logistics services in trade \ncreate  competitiveness  and  value  added.  Freight-forwarding,  warehousing,  storage, \npackaging, shipping services, and ICT infrastructure services are becoming increasingly \nimportant.  \nAs supply chains have fragmented both domestically and internationally, managing and \ncoordinating the various steps in a production process must now be complemented by \nmanaging and coordinating the service links between those steps, often at great distance. \nMinimizing monetary and time costs while ensuring reliability of delivery service depends on \nthe services of efficient logistics systems. \nThe  linkage  between  the  quality  of  logistics  and  type  of  commodity  being  transported \ninvolves three factors (Arnold forthcoming 2009). First is the value of the commodity per \nshipment unit, e.g., per metric ton or twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). Second is the shelf \nlife of the commodity, reflecting physical deterioration or volatility of demand. The third factor \nis the scheduling requirements of the importers, such as just-in-time manufacturers, or \nretailers with coordinated national sales programs. \nX.  PORT AND MODAL CHOICE \nAsian infrastructure has expanded quickly to support the region\u2019s rapid trade growth and \neconomic integration relative to other developing regions (Figure 7 and Table 7). However, \nthe growth has not always been smooth and symmetric. Just as the financial balance of \ntrade  flows  is  frequently  uneven,  so  is  the  physical  balance  of  the  volumes  shipped. \nUnbalanced  international  trade  volume  creates  additional  costs  for  managing  shipping \ncapacity, utilization of infrastructure adjacent to port areas, and cargo clearance, as well as \npossible macroeconomic imbalances. With berth space in ports now a constraining factor in \nAsia\u2019s trade expansion, exploiting complementarities with other modes of transportation \ninfrastructure becomes an urgent priority. At the same time, changes in production and trade \npatterns are affecting modal usage. For example, greater shipments of goods with higher \nvalue per unit weight and sharply higher reward for timeliness of delivery are reducing the \nrelative importance of sea transportation vis-\u00e0-vis air, although sea shipments still dominate \noverall. \n20 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nFigure 7: Paved Roads \n60\n50\n40\nal\not\nT\nof \nge  30\na\nnt\ne\nc\ner\nP\n20\n10\n0\n1990 1999-2003\nEast Asia & Pacific Latin America & Caribbean South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa\n \nSource: World Bank 2007b. \nTable 7: Intraregional Comparisons \n      Africa East  South  LAC \nAsia  Asia \nMerchandise Trade (% of  2005  57.8 74.6 31.2  44.2\nGDP) \nGross Fixed Capital Formation  2004  18.4 33.8 22.9  19.5\n(% of GDP) \nGross Domestic Savings (% of  2004  17.9 37.9 20.1  23.8\nGDP) \nCumulative inward FDI flows  1990\u20132005  125.0 1340.0 65.0  725.0\n(billions US$) \nIntra-regional Trade Shares*  2003  12.2 55.0 6.0  15.0\n(%)  \nInfrastructure     \nElectricity Consumption  2003  513.0 1184.3 393.9  1614.5\n(kWh per capita) \nFixed Line and Mobile  2004  90.6 431.7 75.3  496.0\nSubscribers (per 1,000) \nInternet Users (per 1,000)  2005  29.0 88.6 49.0  156.1\nElectric Power  2003  12.0 7.3 26.4  16.1\nTransmission and \nDistribution Losses (% of \noutput) \nPaved Roads (% of total)  1999\u20132003  12.5 32.3 53.9  26.8\nSource: World Bank 2007b. \n21 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nAir cargo involving Asian nations has grown much faster than at the global level, with \nespecially rapid growth involving intra-Asian international flights. The rapid growth in Asian \nair cargo is driven by declining weight/value ratios of products shipped and steep declines in \nthe price of air cargo. For air shipping, average revenue per ton-kilometer shipped dropped \nby a factor of 10 between 1955 and 2004, largely due to technological advances (Hummels \n2007).  In  addition,  four  factors  seem  especially  important:  rising  incomes,  vertical \nspecialization/fragmentation of production, entry into new markets (often on a trial basis), \nand trade between geographically remote locations. \nHigher income consumers in higher income countries demand higher quality imports. Rising \nincomes affect demand for air transport in three ways. First, higher quality goods have \nhigher prices and therefore transportation cost is a lower ad-valorem share of the delivered \nprice. Second, as consumers grow richer, so does their willingness to pay for particular \nproduct characteristics. That offers incentive for producers to manufacture to specification, \nand to adjust production and shipments quickly and flexibly. Third, delivery speed is itself an \nimportant aspect of product quality for many consumers, and demand for timely delivery will \nrise as income grows (Hummels forthcoming 2009).  \nCargo owners\u2019 port choice is influenced by distance and time to ports, shipping routes and \nintended destination(s), and total costs. Indirect trade-offs in regulatory compliance and \nenforcement, and between port location and security of delivery (and quality of delivered \nproduct), also influence choices of ports and modes of transportation. \nProducers generally choose a port that is consistent with minimum distribution cost including \ntime effectiveness, regulatory requirements, and unscheduled costs, as well as monetary \ncosts.  Patunru  et  al.  (forthcoming  2009)  explore  exporters\u2019  assessments  of  sea  port \ncompetitiveness in the context of the Indonesian archipelago, where roughly 90% of external \ntrade (and much of domestic trade) passes through sea ports. Competition may be in the \nform of inter-port, intra-port, or intra-terminal competition. Comparing Tanjung Perak Port in \nSurabaya  and  Tanjung  Emas  Port  in  Semarang,  their  analysis  considers  captive  and \ncontestable hinterlands and port-choice decision making by exporters in the contestable \nhinterlands. They find that exporters concerned with raw materials distribution are more \nlikely to exhibit the \u201ctrade follows the ships\u201d principle, where exporters are attracted to use \nports with shipping routes that best reach the desired markets. Regions more dominated by \nservice sector exports generally exhibit the \u201cships follow the trade\u201d principle, in which ships \nare routed to serve those regions.  \nWhile port performance is crucial to the Indonesian archipelago, capitalizing on the links and \ncomplementarities between different modes of transportation can boost trade substantially. \nAir and sea ports can move more goods, particularly in containerized shipping, when served \nby efficient rail and road networks, ICT infrastructure, and storage yards. Improvements in \ninfrastructure service efficiency can lead to cost savings equivalent to moving production to \nlocations thousands of kilometers closer to trading partners.  \nMa and Zhang (forthcoming 2009) find that in recent years PRC exporters have experienced \nfluctuating trends in freight and insurance costs for ocean trade but a steady decrease in \nthose for air cargo. In 2002, the ad valorem costs of air freight and insurance fell below those \nof sea freight and insurance, and have remained lower since. Over the period from 1990 to \n2004, the share of air cargo was relatively constant in terms of weight but about tripled in \nterms of value. Their analysis finds that relative to the country\u2019s average trade with the rest \nof the world, PRC\u2019s exports are lower and declining in terms of the weight-to-value ratio \nwhile imports are higher and increasing (reflecting the rise in imports of raw materials). Like \nMalaysia,  PRC  is  expanding  port  infrastructure  partly  as  a  means  to  attract  FDI  from \npotential exporters and thereby increase both trade and competitiveness. \n22 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nXI.  TRADE-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND REGIONAL COOPERATION \nInfrastructure services can yield positive externalities. For example, developing a new road \ninfrastructure project to relieve congestion in port access produces advantages not only for \nthe users of the project but also for users of other roads where congestion is lessened as a \nresult  of  the  new  project.  Even  non-users  gain  through  reduction  of  pollution  and \nimprovement of the natural environment, and the country  as a whole benefits through \nreduction of oil consumption or oil imports as well as increased trade benefits. \nEfforts to take advantage of economies of scale in production, procurement, or marketing, \nlead firms to look beyond national borders for both trade and investment opportunities. \nPromoting  efficient  financial  intermediation,  coordinating  and  promoting  regional  public \ngoods, reducing macroeconomic vulnerability to shocks, and strengthening security ties offer \ngovernments  similar  incentives  to  design,  develop,  and  manage  regional  infrastructure \ncooperation and integration. In this context, infrastructure is one of the \u201cthree I\u2019s,\u201d along with \nincentives and institutions, that are key determinants of overall growth and the magnitude \nand productivity of capital inflows as economies liberalize (Hill 2004).  \nAs  production  services  become  increasingly  fragmented  and  traded  internationally, \ncooperation among the economies participating in those production networks becomes more \ncrucial to maintain or raise an individual host country industry\u2019s competitiveness in supplying \nthose services. Regional infrastructure coordination can lower infrastructure costs and limit \nenvironmental and other negative social impacts, while still contributing to trade expansion. \nIn the case of the GMS, special forums have been established to coordinate transport, \ntelecommunications,  and  electric  power  infrastructure  developments,  particularly  for  the \ndevelopment of cross-country economic corridors (Asian Development Bank [ADB] 2006).  \nInfrastructure not only fosters economic growth, but also strengthens inclusiveness and \nreduces poverty. Especially, infrastructure investment that reduces trade costs facilitates \nregional economic integration through trade and investment expansion, which motivates \nregional  cooperation,  including  cooperation  in  infrastructure  development,  generating  a \nvirtuous cycle. A simple depiction of the relationships is presented in Figure 8.6 \nFigure 8: Changes in Comparative Advantages \nRegional \nCooperation\nTrade  Trade \nInfrastructure\nCosts Flows\nChanges in \nComparative \nAdvantage\nRegional \nIntegration\n \n                                                 \n6 I am grateful to Peter Rimmer for helpful suggestions in refining this diagram. \n23 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nThe diversity of Asian economies, combined with infrastructure expansion and enhancement \nto lower trade costs, has helped the region to capitalize on global patterns of production \nfragmentation,  expanding  intraregional  trade,  and  diversification  of  development \nopportunities.  The  impacts  of  trade-related  infrastructure  are  now  being  leveraged  by \ncoordination  across  borders  in  a  wide  variety  of  institutional  architectures  and  trade \nagreements. In this evolving international context, the role of harmonizing and strengthening \nsoft infrastructure stands out as an essential partner for enhanced physical infrastructure. \nSupported by a conducive policy environment and internalizing regional spillover effects \nthrough  cooperative  arrangements,  the  expansion,  improvement,  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure services is reducing trade costs and facilitating trade expansion, regional \nintegration, and economic growth and development. \nWeiss (2008) presents a framework for considering the role of infrastructure in regional \ncooperation. He utilizes a modified formulation of the effective rate of protection to flexibly \nquantify the empirical significance of trade cost barriers that are broader than the familiar \ntariffs and quotas. Infrastructure investments and interventions, both hard and soft, are then \nseen to be instruments to reduce trade costs and thereby stimulate closer intraregional \ntrading linkages. In this manner, the height of barriers posed by different types of trade costs \nsuggests  a  rough  ranking  of  priorities  for  infrastructure  development  to  reduce  these \nbarriers, which vary across countries. \nFactors like high freight costs, delays in customs clearance, unofficial payments, slow port \nlanding and handling, and poor governance create barriers to trade. Institutional bottlenecks \n(administrative, legal, financial, regulatory, and other logistics infrastructure), information \nasymmetries,  and  discretionary  powers  that  give  rise  to  rent  seeking  activities  by \ngovernment officials at various steps of trade transactions also impose costs. These costs \ncan be lowered through cooperation that facilitates trade logistics for merchandise and \nservices in both inbound and outbound shipments. \nAt the international level, cooperation through preferential trade and investment agreements \nthat strengthen structural reforms and increase the attractiveness of a location for foreign \ninvestment can leverage domestic policy actions and their impacts on growth, equity and \nefficiency, and may help to reduce corruption. Cross-border cooperation in building and \nmaintaining soft infrastructure can therefore lead synergistically to a reduction in trade costs \nand  stimulate  further  investment  in  physical  infrastructure,  trade,  production  and \nemployment, and growth.  \nXII.  CONCLUSIONS \nOver the next few decades, developing Asian economies are expected to make up most of \nthe fastest growing markets in the world. An important part of this growth will come through \ntrade  expansion,  regional  integration  through  the  fragmentation  of  production  networks \nacross national borders, and the broadening and deepening of international capital flows to \nsupport this trade and production expansion.  \nMajor advances have been made in Asia in the provision of trade-related infrastructure. \nHowever, further infrastructure development is required to sustain current economic growth \nand regional integration. A joint ADB\u2013Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)\u2013\nWorld Bank (2005) study estimated that a huge amount\u2014more than US$200 billion per \nyear\u2014is needed to fund estimated needs in infrastructure. New or improved roads, power \nplants, communications facilities, and water and sanitation systems are urgently needed in \ndeveloping countries across the region. The PRC alone is expected to require about 80% of \nthe total investment. Relative to their size, many smaller and poorer developing countries in \nthe region also face severe bottlenecks that call for large investments in infrastructure.  \nInternational trade is growing in value and shrinking in weight per unit value. Exports are \nexpanding most notably at the extensive margin, diversifying across new markets with \n24 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nsmaller flows, and fragmented production networks are becoming the norm. Each of these \ntrends puts emphasis on speed, flexibility, and information. Cross-border infrastructure that \nfacilitates  the  expansion  of  trade  along  these  lines  will  boost  a  country\u2019s  export \ncompetitiveness and its efficient integration into the global economy (Hummels forthcoming \n2009). \nThe demand for information and related services such as finance and telecommunications \ncan be expected to grow faster than the demand for transportation of goods and people. \nSimilarly, as the density of economic activity increases with population and income growth, \nand  modern  flexible  manufacturing  practices  spread  and  move  production  closer  to \nconsumers, there is likely to be an increasing demand for short-haul relative to long-haul \ntransportation  and  facilitating  infrastructure  investments  in  both  the  domestic  and \ninternational contexts.  \nEfforts to expand and enhance infrastructure services will reduce costs of doing business in \nAsia, of achieving economies of scale, and of international trade, helping to maximize growth \nand  the  benefits  of  regional  trade  and  investment  integration.  At  the  same  time, \ninfrastructure improvements, complemented by trade expansion, will attract and facilitate \ngreater  investment  in  productive  capacity,  expand  access  to  markets  and  employment \nopportunities for the poor, and broaden the range of consumer choice for Asia\u2019s billions. \n25 ", "ADBI Working Paper 128    Brooks \n \nAPPENDIX \nTable A.1: Road Transport, by Region, 1996 and 2004 \nRoad Transport           \n      Paved Roads     Total Roads Network \n  Region   % of Total Roads    Thousand Kilometers \n      1996 2004    1996  2004\n             \nDeveloping Asia and the \nPacific  49.1 65.3   5,407.9  7,385.1\n  East Asia  58.7 83.9   1,319.1  2,022.1\n  Central and West Asia  75.0 68.6   579.0  598.4\n  The Pacific  23.7 ..   27.9  ..\n  South Asia  41.1 46.0   2,673.7  3,745.3\n  Southeast Asia  47.2 62.5   808.2  1,019.4\nOther developing  40.6 46.4   7,531.9  ..\nOECD1  81.4 79.9   11,300.0  14,000.0\n             \nWorld2  47.6 55.5    24,300.0  ..\nNote: 1 Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, and Republic of Korea are not included \nin OECD average as they are grouped into developing countries.
