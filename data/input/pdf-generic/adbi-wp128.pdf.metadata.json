International  trade  even  played  a  critical  role  in  the \nregion\u2019s  recovery  from  the  1997\u20131998  financial  crisis.  Asia\u2019s  trade  expansion  has  in  turn \nbeen  facilitated  and  encouraged  by  the  development  of  supporting  infrastructure,  including \nboth physical (hard) and institutional (soft) infrastructure, and logistics services. From 1975 \nto  1995,  developing  Asia\u2019s  port  capacity  increased  from  3  million  to  62  million  TEU,1 an \naverage  annual  growth  of  over  15%.  Airfreight  shipments  in  the  region  increased  roughly \n14%  annually  during  the  same  period,  from  less  than  2  billion  to  more  than  30  billion  ton-\nkilometers.  Investment  in  infrastructure  has  been  complemented  in  turn,  and  spurred,  by \nforeign and domestic investment in productive capacity as well as by structural reforms that \nimprove the environment for investment, production, and trade.  \n\nInfrastructure  services  can  reduce  distribution  margins,  narrowing  the  gap  between  prices \nfaced  by  producers  and  consumers,  thereby  facilitating  welfare  improvements  for  both.  On \nthe supply side, the expansion or improvement in quality of infrastructure services can lower \nmarginal  costs,  raising  the  minimum  efficient  scale  of  production,  transportation,  or \nmarketing. These lower costs and greater economies of scale raise the potential for initial or \nincreased  sales  to  export  markets,  as  well  as  domestic  sales.  Indeed,  a  significant  part  of \ninfrastructure\u2019s  contribution  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Asia  comes  through  its \nfacilitation  of  international  trade  expansion.  It  expands  both  the  scope  for  domestic \nabsorption  and  supply  to  export  markets,  while  stimulating  linkages  with  and  between \ndifferent sectors and industries, and providing incentives for innovation.  \n\nAsia  is  benefiting  from  market-driven integration,  where  large  trade  and  foreign  investment \nflows  respond  to  infrastructure  development,  outward-oriented  policies,  and  incorporation \ninto international production networks and regional cooperation frameworks. Both Asian and \nnon-Asian  multinational  corporations  have  developed  international  supply  chains  linking \ndifferent parts of the region and openness to foreign direct investment (FDI) has become the \nnorm. Financial integration has supported these developments by increasing access to credit \nand  innovative  financial  instruments.  Tariffs  and  quotas  have  been  reduced  through \nsuccessive rounds of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade  (succeeded  by  the  World  Trade  Organization  [WTO])  and  the  recent  plethora  of \nbilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements.  But  infrastructure  in  many  Asian  countries  is  still \ninefficient,  if  not  inadequate.  Inability  to  transport  goods  and  people  efficiently  or  an \ninadequate power supply to operate machinery smoothly leads to microeconomic as well as \nmacroeconomic \ninfrastructure-induced \nreductions  in  trade  costs  have  become  relatively  more  important  than  direct policy  barriers \nas sources of further cost savings (Brooks, Roland-Holst, and Zhai 2005). \n\nthis  economic  environment, \n\nimbalances. \n\nIn \n\nEfficient  infrastructure  services  lower  transaction  costs,  raise  value  added,  and  increase \npotential  profitability  while  increasing  and  expanding  linkages  to  global  supply  chains  and \ndistribution  networks  for  producers,  and  a  country  that  is  more  deeply  involved  in  global \nproduction networks will likely benefit more from trade-related infrastructure investment than \none  that  is  not.  In  a  study  incorporating  threshold  effects,  Francois  and  Manchin  (2006) \nfound  that  infrastructure  is  a  key  determinant  not  only  of  export  levels,  but  also  of  the \nlikelihood  of  exporting  at  all.  Investments  in  expanding  and  upgrading  transport  and \ntelecommunications infrastructure figure prominently in this regard.  \n\nWhile trade and logistics infrastructure often evokes images of large-scale physical projects, \nsoft  (or  institutional)  infrastructure  is  equally  important.  A  supporting  environment  of \npredictable  legal  and  judicial  rights  and  procedures,  equitable  and  enforceable  competition \npolicy,  and  a  sound  but  not  unduly  restrictive  regulatory  framework  are  crucial  for  physical \ninfrastructure investment to be efficient. Financial services, including financial intermediation, \n                                                 \n1 TEU is a standard measure of shipping volume and represents a twenty-foot equivalent unit. \n\n 1\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nrisk management opportunities, and payment and clearing services are especially important \nfor  facilitating  international  trade.  Bond  markets  capable  of  supplying  long  term  finance  in \nlocal  currencies  ideally  play  a  central  role  in  infrastructure  finance,  but  are  still  in  an  early \nstage of development in most of Asia.  \n\nCooperative efforts to broaden, deepen, and strengthen these markets throughout the region \nin  support  of  greater  trade  are  expanding  dramatically.  The  international  externalities  that \narise  as  infrastructure  services  support  cross-border  trade  flows  indicate  an  important  role \nfor regional cooperation to incorporate and maximize social benefits (Maur 2008). Regional \ncooperation  in  trade  and  logistics  strengthens  regional  economic  growth  and  integration, \nallowing  greater  regional  investment  in  cross-border  infrastructure  projects.  This  can \nperpetuate a virtuous cycle. \n\nII. \n\nRECENT TRENDS IN ASIA\u2019S AGGREGATE TRADE2 \n\nExports from developing Asia and the Pacific accounted for about 24% of the world total in \n2005. East Asia alone accounted for more than 16% of world exports. Consequently, much \nof the dynamism of Asia\u2019s trade, and the impacts of infrastructure development and regional \ncooperation, can be seen by focusing on East Asia,3 a dynamic region in terms of trade and \neconomic  growth.  This  region\u2019s  economies  have  continued  to  become  more  exposed  to \ninternational  trade  over  the  last  decade,  with  merchandise  exports  increasing  from  34%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to 42% in 2005, even while GDP was growing rapidly.  \n\nTable  1  presents  the  export  value  of  East  Asia  and  major  comparator  country  groups  for \nselected  years  over  1990  to  2005,  along  with  their  market  shares  in  global  trade.  The \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  is  included  both  with  the  rest  of  East  Asia  and  as  a \ncomparator since it has been playing a particularly prominent role.  \n\nEast  Asian  exports  accounted  for  over  one  fifth  of  the  world\u2019s  total  exports  in  2005.  The \ngrowth in world market share of East Asian exports (from 13.0% in 1990 to 21.7% in 2005) \ncame  mostly  from  East  Asian  intraregional  trade  (from  4.2%  in  1990  to  9.1%  in  2005  as \nshares  of  world  exports)  and  from  the  trade  between  PRC  and  the  other  East  Asian \neconomies  (from  0.8%  in  1990  to  2.9%  in  2005  as  shares  of  world  exports).  It  was  far \ngreater  than  that  for  any  of  the  comparator  groups.  The  export  value  of  East  Asian \nintraregional trade grew by 13.4% from 1990 to 2005, while East Asia\u2019s exports to PRC grew \nfaster, by 17.8% in the same period. In contrast, the world market share of North American \nTrade  Free  Agreement\u2019s  (NAFTA)  exports  rose  by  no  more  than  three  percentage  points \nfrom 1990 to 2000 and declined more than four percentage points from 2000 to 2005. The \nrelative importance of the European Union (EU) (15) was declining from 1990 to 2000 before \nslightly increasing from 2000 to 2005.  \n\nThe table shows that PRC is playing a more and more important role in world trade and in \nEast Asia trade. The share of PRC\u2019s exports in East Asia rose from less than 15% in 1990 to \nover  35%  in  2005.  The  reemergence  of  PRC  as  an  international  trading  power  has  had  a \nmajor impact on the other economies of Asia, both as a competitor in world markets and as \na dynamic and growing market for the other Asian economies. \n\n                                                 \n2 Jinkang Zhang contributed substantially to this section. \n3 East Asia in this section refers to: Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; PRC; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Republic \n\nof Korea; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Myanmar; Philippines; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; Viet Nam.

The  annual  growth  rate  of \nEast  Asian  intraregional  trade  from  1990  to  2005  was  13.4%  versus  10.4%  for  its  extra-\nregional  trade,  and  exceeded  the  growth  of  intraregional  trade  for  NAFTA  (9.0%),  EU  (15) \n(5.4%), and Mercado Comun del Sur (MERCOSUR) (11.5%). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 3\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nFigure 1 shows world market share changes for five major regions\u2019 exports.

The dollar value of intraregional \ntrade  in  East  Asia  is  now  slightly  larger  than  that  in  NAFTA,  and  although  both  regions \nexperienced increases in world market shares over 1990 to 2005, growth was faster in East \nAsia.  \n\nFigure 1: Intra-regional Trade of Major Regions, 1990\u20132005 \n\n \n\n[Bubble size indicates the \nvalue of intra-regional trade \ni ]\n\n ASEAN \n\n East Asia (15) \n\n MERCOSUR \n\n   7.7% - World trade growth for merchandised exports (1990\u20132005)\n\nNAFTA \n\nEurope Union (15)\n\n16.0\n\n14.0\n\n12.0\n\n10.0\n\n8.0\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n \nl\n\ni\n\na\nn\no\ng\ne\nr\n-\na\nr\nt\nn\n\n \n\nI\n \nf\no\ne\nt\na\nr\n \nh\nt\nw\no\nr\ng\n\n \nl\na\nu\nn\nn\nA\n\n \n)\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\u2013\n0\n9\n9\n1\n(\n \n\ns\nt\nr\no\np\nx\nE\n\n-12.0 \n\n-10.0 \n\n-8.0 \n\n-6.0\n\n-4.0\n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\nChange in the world market share of intra-regional exports (1990\u20132005)\n\n \n\nSource: UN Comtrade data. \n\nRoughly a quarter of world trade occurs between countries sharing a common border. Half of \nworld  trade  takes  place  between  partners  less  than  3,000  kilometers  apart  (Berthelon  and \nFreund  2004).  Even  so,  for  Asia  only  1\u20135%  of  trade  by  value  is  with  land-neighboring \ncountries.  For  trade  with  non-adjacent  partners,  nearly  all  merchandise  trade  moves  via \nocean  and  air  transport  modes.  The  10-fold  decline  in  air  shipping  prices  since  the  late \n1950s means  that the  cost  of  speed  has  fallen dramatically. Since  the  marginal  cost  of  air \nshipping  cargo  per  additional  mile  is  falling  rapidly,  over  time  the  average  air  shipment  is \ntraversing a greater distance and the average ocean shipment is getting shorter (Hummels \n2007). \n\nIII. \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND TRADE COSTS \n\nThe quantity of infrastructure investment, the quality of infrastructure services, and logistics \ncoordination of those services, influence trade performance (see e.g., Limao and Venables \n2001; Clark, Dollar, and Micco 2004). This occurs through impacts on pecuniary transaction \ncosts, loss, damage and spoilage to goods in transit, and timeliness of delivery, among other \nfactors.  \n\nNordas  and  Piermartini  (2004)  highlight  four  central  aspects  of  the  relationship  between \ninfrastructure and trade transaction costs: \n\n1.  Direct  monetary  outlays  on  communications,  business  travel,  freight,  insurance, \nand logistics services are affected by the quality of infrastructure and the cost and \nquality of related services. \n\n2.  Timeliness,  even  more  than  freight  rates,  is  likely  to  be  influenced  by  geography \n\nand infrastructure. \n\n3.  Risk  of  damaged  cargo  and  resulting  increased  losses  and  insurance  costs  is \n\nhigher when infrastructure quality is poor. \n\n 4\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\n4.  Lack  of  access  to  transport  or  telecommunication  services  can  have  a  high \nopportunity cost, limiting market access and reducing the likelihood of realizing the \nfull benefits of trade. \n\nThe relative weights of different categories of trade costs that reflect different infrastructure \nservices can be surprising. As De (forthcoming 2009a) notes, in 2005 the ocean freight rate \nfor  importing  a  container  to  India  was  about  two  thirds  greater  than  for  exporting.  At  the \nsame time, ocean freight for importing a container to PRC from six Asian countries was far \nlower than for exporting. Auxiliary shipping charges (documentation fees, container handling \ncharges, government taxes and levies, etc.) may account for much of this difference and are \nsometimes greater than the ocean freight charges, particularly where shipments experience \ncongestion  at  ports  or  borders.  On  average,  auxiliary  shipping  charges  outweigh  terminal \nhandling charges across countries and commodities in Asia, with variation in such charges \ncontributing  significantly  to  variations  in  trade  costs.  Improvement  in  logistics  services, \nincluding  cross-country  coordination,  may  help  to  lower  both  the  average  cost  and  the \nvariability. This highlights one area of potential for regional cooperation in strengthening soft \ninfrastructure to contribute to lowering trade costs.  \n\nThe composition of freight charges also varies significantly across countries and commodity \ncategories. De finds that the share of total freight charges accounted for by inland freight is \nsometimes  less  than  that  of  ocean  freight,  but  is  frequently  greater.  The  actual  balance \ndepends on the country, suggesting an inland focus for trade-related infrastructure priorities \nin  those  countries  where  the  inland  share  is  greater.  A  10%  reduction  in  transport  costs \n(expressed as an ad valorem tax equivalent) would boost Asia\u2019s trade by about 3\u20134%  from \nwhat it would otherwise be. When trade is differentiated by commodity groups, the weight to \nvalue ratio is found to be the major determinant of transport cost, suggesting that road, rail, \nand sea may be the increasing order of modal preference for transporting heavier cargos.  \n\nHummels and Skiba (2004) similarly found that a 10% increase in the ratio of product weight \nto value results in a 4% increase in ad valorem shipping costs. Hummels (2007) notes that \nfrom  1960\u20132004,  the  real  value  of  trade  in  manufactures  grew  about  1.5%  per  year  faster \nthan the weight of non-bulk cargoes. If bulk commodities are included in the calculation, the \nreal value of all trade grew 1.8% faster per year than the weight of all trade. \n\nNote  that  an  important  component  of  transportation  costs  is the  time  cost involved. This  is \nparticularly critical for perishable or other time-sensitive goods. Hummels (2001) found that \nthe time cost of one day in transit for US imports is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff rate of \n0.8%,  implying  the  equivalent  of  a  16%  tariff  on  an  average  trans-Pacific  shipment  of  20 \ndays. Clearly, improvements in infrastructure services that reduce delays in border crossing \nprocedures, transit times, or ports will influence a country\u2019s propensity to trade. Costs related \nto the time elapsed between the perception of demand and subsequent supply of products to \nthe  relevant  retailer(s)  can  also  figure  prominently  (Nordas  and  Piermartini  2004). \nDevelopments  in  containerization  and  multimodal  transport  networks  with  corresponding \nlogistics support are contributing to quicker delivery times and the growth in air shipments. \n\nWhen  growth  is  very  rapid,  congestion  results  as  the  increase  in  traffic  induced  by  the \neconomic  growth  outpaces  the  expansion  of  transportation  infrastructure  services.  Ma  and \nZhang (forthcoming 2009) find this to be the current situation in PRC. Sea port congestion \nthere  results  from  the  long neglect  of  access  transport  and  port  facilities infrastructure.  Six \npercent of the world\u2019s rail lines struggle to move one-fourth of the world\u2019s rail freight turnover, \nand only 2% of the country\u2019s highway network is expressways. \n\nCongestion  has  been  rising  most  notably  at  the  port  of  Shanghai,  as  inefficiencies  from \noverloading  the  physical  infrastructure  are  compounded  by  a  lack  of  collaboration  among \ndifferent  stakeholders.  In  terms  of  soft  infrastructure,  reliability  of  trade  facilitation  and \nadministrative  procedures  at  customs  are  crucial,  including  rationalization  of  the  customs \ntransit  system  in  order  to  reduce  inspection  time  and  simplify  declarations  and  the \ndocumentation  process.  Meanwhile,  Shanghai\u2019s  congestion  is  reducing  its  competitiveness \n\n 5\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nrelative  to  nearby  ports  in  neighboring  economies,  endangering  its  status  as  a  hub  and \ngateway to international markets and suppliers. In recent years, the number of transshipped \ncontainers from Shanghai via Hong Kong, China have accounted for as much as 20% of the \ntotal container throughput of Shanghai.  \n\nLimited  infrastructure  connections  to  western  regions  in  PRC  result  in  high  trade  costs  for \ninland  regions  and  impede  regionally  balanced  growth.  As  land  and  labor  costs  rise  near \ncoasts,  investors  look  to  locate  production  facilities  farther  inland.  However,  they  are \nhampered  by  insufficient  or  poor  quality  infrastructure  connections  that  raise  transportation \ncosts to and from those areas. This has led to a shift in infrastructure policy emphasis to give \ngreater  weight  to  hinterland  access.  Railway  construction  is  crucial  for  inland  provinces, \nwhere a greater share of production is of bulk commodities. At the same time, the lack of a \nseamless  logistics  management  system adds  to  delays  in  use  of  multimodal  transportation \nsystems in inland areas, where they may be most valuable. \n\nInfrastructure inland from the border can have as much effect on the length and variability of \ntime-to-market  as  freight  services  between  countries.  This  is  especially  true  in  large  or \nlandlocked countries, and the proliferation of inland dry ports has evolved partly in response. \nLimao  and  Venables  (2001)  found  that  domestic  infrastructure  explains  about  40%  of \ntransport  costs  for  coastal  countries,  while  domestic  and  transit  country  infrastructure \ntogether  account  for  an  estimated  60%  of  transport  costs  for  landlocked  countries. \nFurthermore, land transport is about seven times more costly than sea transport over similar \ndistances, and estimates of the elasticity of trade flows with respect to transport costs range \nfrom -2 to -3.5, suggesting that lowering a landlocked country\u2019s trade costs by 10% through \nregional cooperation for infrastructure development could increase its exports by over 20%. \n\nDe  (forthcoming  2009b)  finds  that  inland  transport  cost  is  the  major  component  of  overall \ntrade transportation costs in South Asia, accounting for about 88% of the total. Inland costs \nare very high across South Asian countries, except in Sri Lanka, and vary across goods and \ncountries,  being  even  higher  when  countries  are  landlocked.  Land  border  crossings  are \novercrowded, and greater policy attention to efficiency concerns could easily reduce delays \nand  monetary  costs.  Complex  border-crossing  requirements  expand  possibilities  for \ncorruption and have encouraged sharp growth in informal trade. The border effects in South \nAsia and its low share of intraregional trade argue strongly for cooperative improvements in \nsoft  infrastructure  complemented  by  inland  transportation  infrastructure,  to  raise  exporters\u2019 \ncompetitiveness. \n\nIV. \n\nEMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF TRADE COSTS \n\nEmpirical  assessments  of  trade  costs  are  most  frequently  derived  through  estimation  of  a \ngravity equation. An excellent survey of trade cost estimation can be found in Anderson and \nvan  Wincoop  (2004).  They  estimated  that  the  tax  equivalent  of  representative  international \ntrade costs is about 74% for industrialized countries, including 21% transportation costs and \n44% border-related costs.4 Costs for developing countries can be much higher. \n\nDe  (2008)  estimates  a  modified  gravity  equation  for  eight  sectors  in  10  Asian  countries, \ncontrolling for distance, to examine the effects of both policy and non-policy barriers to trade. \nIn this framework, infrastructure quality and transport costs, along with tariffs, are found to be \nthe main determinants of cross-country variations in trade flows. Infrastructure interventions \nthat reduce the costs of international trade are therefore crucial for the region to fully realize \nthe gains from recent and prospective trade policy liberalization. \n\nThere is often skepticism as to the extent to which the benefits of trade-related infrastructure \nin developing countries accrue to the poor. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is \na  poor,  landlocked,  rugged,  mountainous  country  with  generally  low  quality  roads.  The \n\n                                                 \n4 The costs are not simply additive. The total is 1.44*1.21-1=0.74. \n\n 6\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\npoorest people often reside far from urban centers and are the most disadvantaged by the \nhigh transport costs resulting from bad roads. Inadequate or substandard roads present an \nobstacle to realizing the potential benefits for rural residents from recent economic reforms \nand  international  trade.  Menon  and  Warr  (2008)  use  a  general  equilibrium  modeling \napproach to assess the impact of rural road improvements on the incidence of poverty. They \ndifferentiate rural villages into three categories based on the quality of road access available: \n(i)  no  vehicular  access,  (ii)  dry  season  only  access,  and  (iii)  all  weather  access.  Although \nroad  improvement  in  all  three  categories  reduces  poverty,  the  type  of  road  improvement \ndetermines  the  magnitude  of  the  impact.  When  areas  with  no  vehicle  access  are  provided \nwith  dry  season  access  roads,  the  reduction  in  poverty  incidence  is  about  17  times  that \nwhich  occurs  when  roads  suitable  only  for  dry  season  access  are  upgraded  to  all  weather \naccess roads, and the effect on GDP is about six times as great. Thus, enabling transport of \ntraded goods for households without initial road access is highly pro-poor compared to road \nimprovement for households already having dry season road access to markets.  \n\nThe  way  in  which  road  infrastructure,  whether  domestic  or  cross  border,  affects  trade \noperates  mainly  through  reductions  in  transport  costs,  which  also  underlie  the  poverty \nimpact.  Furthermore,  reductions  in  transport  costs  have  an  indirect  positive  impact  on  FDI \ninflows  by  reducing  transaction  costs  in  intra-firm  vertical  integration  that  is  designed  to \nexploit  countries\u2019  comparative  cost  advantages.  Increases  in  FDI,  in  turn,  can  further \nincrease  regional  trade,  and  add  to  the  direct  effect  of  reduced  transport  costs  achieved \nthrough  improvements  in  road  infrastructure  near  border  areas.  When  such  gains  are \npresent,  this  reduces  tendencies  towards  production  agglomeration.  If  the  advantages  of \nproduction \nthen \nreductions in transport costs make FDI complementary to trade. This defines a virtuous cycle \nof  cross-border  infrastructure  development,  trade,  and  investment  that  fosters  increased \ntrade and economic growth. \n\nintegration  across  economies  outweigh \n\nfrom  agglomeration, \n\nthose \n\nEdmonds  and  Fujimura  (2008)  investigate  the  impacts  of  infrastructure  development  on \ntrade  and  FDI,  focusing  on  both  domestic  and  cross-border  infrastructure  in  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS).  They  estimate  gravity  models  using  panel  data  from  1981  to \n2003 for trade and FDI flows between each pair of the six GMS countries. The results show \nthat the quality of road infrastructure in border areas between economies has a positive and \nstatistically significant relationship with trade flows between them, and that this relationship \nis  particularly  strong  when  both  cross-border  and  general  domestic  road  infrastructure  are \nincluded  in the estimates. They also find that  cross-border  roads have distinct effects from \ndomestic road infrastructure, suggesting that investments in cross-border infrastructure have \nan  independent  and  important  role  to  play  in  the  promotion  of  regional  trade  and  may \ntherefore justify cooperative development of this infrastructure. \n\nCross-border  road  infrastructure  was  estimated  to  have  a  positive  but  not  statistically \nsignificant  association  with  FDI.  The  weak  relationship  could  be  due  to  data shortcomings, \nsince the number of countries reporting FDI flows at disaggregated levels is limited. Despite \nthese  data  limitations,  there  is  some  evidence  of  a  positive  trade-FDI  nexus  in  which  FDI \ncontributes to export growth from FDI-recipient economies.  \n\nV. \n\nTRADE FACILITATION \n\nReductions  in  trade  costs  resulting  from  infrastructure improvements  or  expansion  are  one \nform of trade facilitation, but trade facilitation can be defined in many ways. In the context of \nthe  WTO,  it  primarily  refers  to  simplifying  or  speeding  up  administrative  documentation \nprocedures at border crossings. In broader usage, it includes measures taken by both public \nand private sectors, reduction in nontariff barriers, and improvements in physical facilities to \nsmooth  the  movement  of  shipments  by  reducing  time  in  transit.  Thus,  it  may  encompass \nboth hard and soft infrastructure that facilitates trade. \n\n 7\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nDee,  Findlay  and  Pomfret  (2008)  include  all  factors  affecting  time  and  money  costs  of \nmoving goods across international borders in the scope of trade facilitation. The success of \nreforms  to  facilitate  trade  depends  on  their  impact  on  both  rent-creating  and  cost-creating \ninfluences.  Use  of  price-cost  margins  to  measure  performance  helps  identify  rent-creating \nbarriers,  while  use  of  cost  or  productivity  as  performance  measures  can  identify  cost-\ncreating  barriers.  The  identification  is  important  in  designing  policy  responses  since  the \ntreatment effect (as rent-raising or cost-raising) can dominate other factors in the estimated \nheight  of  trade  barriers.  They  use  antimonde  estimation,  in  which  a  measure  of  economic \nperformance is estimated for the counterfactual case with no nontariff barriers in a market to \nquantify  the  extent  to  which  nontariff  barriers  lead  to  vertical  shifts  in  demand  or  supply \ncurves with consequent effects on costs and prices. \n\nAmong  different  indicators  of  infrastructure  services\u2019  contributions  to  trade,  port  efficiency \nhas  the  largest  influence,  reflecting  the  fact  that  the  vast  bulk  of  trade  (by  weight)  is \ntransported by sea. Infrastructure improvements that raise port efficiency from the 25th to the \n75th  percentile  can  reduce  shipping  costs  by  more  than  10%  (Clark  et  al.  2004).  The \ndominance of sea freight over land transport and the associated cost savings emphasize the \nimportance of transit arrangements for landlocked countries attempting to compete in global \nmarkets,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  improving  port  efficiency  in  countries  with  amenable \ncoastal areas.  \n\nIncreasing  port  efficiency  complements  technological  changes  in  shipping  that  yield \neconomies of scale. Larger, faster ships and containerization reduce average shipment time \nat sea and in ports. Estimates by Hummels (2007) show that increasing the share of trade \nthat  is  containerized  by  1%  lowers  shipping  costs  from  3\u201313%.  In  addition,  trade  growth \nalong  a  particular  shipping  route  promotes  entry,  with  new  competition  driving  down \ntransportation  markups.  In  2006  one  out  of  six  importer-exporter  pairs  was  served  by  a \nsingle liner service; over half were served by three or fewer (Hummels et al. 2007). Service \nalso  becomes  more  frequent,  facilitating  timely  delivery,  and  a  densely  traded  route  allows \nfor  effective  use  of  hub  and  spoke  arrangements,  in  which  small  container  vessels  feed \nshipments  into  a  hub  where  containers  are  aggregated  into  much  larger  and  faster \ncontainerships for longer hauls. \n\nHaveman  et  al.  (forthcoming  2009)  show  for  a  subsample  of  Asian  ports  that  specific \ninfrastructure investments are highly correlated with reductions in port costs. While Penang \n(Malaysia) currently has the lowest costs of ports studied, Mumbai experienced the greatest \nimprovement in relative costs between 1997 and 2005. Operating with a new harbor, wharf, \nor  terminal  is  estimated  to  decrease  port  costs  by  2%  while  procurement  of  a  new  crane \ndecreases  port  costs  1%.  Increasing  the  number  of  berths  at  ports  or  deepening  channels \nhave less effect.  \n\nNot  only  do  investments  in  port  infrastructure,  and  especially  the  procurement  of  new \ncranes, lower costs and raise efficiency for current trade flows, they can also increase port \ncapacity  to  handle  new  flows  and  influence  the  composition  of  trade.  Port  costs  vary \nsignificantly across products even at a single port, and new infrastructure can, for example, \ndifferentially  influence  the  costs  for  loading/unloading  containers  versus  bulk  commodities. \nStandardized containers yield cost savings by allowing goods to be packed once and moved \nover long distances via a combination of transport modes\u2014truck, rail, ocean liner, rail, then \ntruck  again\u2014without  being  unpacked  and  repacked.  Given  the  inherent  advantages  in \ncontainerization for certain product categories, relevant port infrastructure developments can \nreduce unit costs further as the container share of trade rises.  \n\nChanges  in  the  composition  of  trade,  mode  of  product  packing  (container  or  bulk,  for \nexample),  and  the  capacity  expansion  effect  of  new  port  infrastructure  all  influence  the \npotential  profitability,  and  hence  bankability,  of  port  infrastructure  investments.  In  planning \nport expansion or improvement projects, both the efficiency and capacity effects need to be \naccounted for in projecting potential benefits. This is true for sea-, dry-, and airports. \n\n 8\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) is an increasingly productive complement \nto physical transportation infrastructure. The quality of communication infrastructure services \nis not only strongly correlated with search costs, but also with costs of entering into contracts \nwith suppliers, monitoring implementation of those contracts, and monitoring the location and \nstatus of shipments.  \n\nFink, Matoo, and Neagu (2002) find that the cost of making a telephone call has a significant \nand  negative  effect  on  bilateral  trade  flows.  In  addition,  the  costs  of  telecommunications \nhave  a  greater  effect  on  trade  of  differentiated  products  than  on  trade  of  homogeneous \nproducts,  highlighting  the  value  of  ICT  infrastructure  at  the  dynamic  extensive  margin  of \ntrade.  In  particular,  as  the  number  of  smaller  shipments  of  a  wider  variety  of  higher  value \nadded products rises, the demand for ICT infrastructure services rises. \n\nthe  main  services \n\nThe  same  is  true  as  growth  in  trade  of  services  outpaces  merchandise  trade  growth. \nInfrastructure, especially telecommunications infrastructure, is particularly important for trade \nin  services,  where \n(banking  and  business  services, \ncommunications,  etc.)  are  highly  dependent  on  well-developed  infrastructure  in  both  the \nexporting  and  importing  countries  (Nicoletti,  Golub,  Hajkova,  Mirza,  and  Yoo  2003).  Given \nthe  huge  value  of  ICT  infrastructure  demanded,  it  is  fortunate  that  ICT  is  an  infrastructure \nsector which the private sector  is  especially adept at innovating, expanding, and financing, \nwhile  the  need  for  mutually  interfacing  logistics  services  at  both  ends  of  the  trade  route \npoints  to  an  area  for  regional  cooperation  to  capitalize  on  informational  externalities  in \nenhancing trade. \n\ntraded \n\nVI. \n\nOVERVIEW OF ASIA\u2019S INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nGiven  the  importance  of  transportation,  energy,  and  ICT  infrastructure  in  Asia\u2019s  trade  and \nregional cooperation, this section briefly reviews the status of these infrastructure areas. \n\nA. \n\nTransport Infrastructure \n\nTransport infrastructure development varies across countries in the region. Some countries \nshow a progressive pattern while others suffer a declining trend. In 2004, developing Asia\u2019s \ntotal  road  network  covered  7.4  million  kilometers,  of  which  65.3%  was  paved  (Appendix \nTable  A.1).5 While  East  and  Southeast  Asia  have  improved  the  coverage  of  paved  roads, \nCentral  and  West  Asia,  which  had  the  highest  proportion  of  paved  roads  to  total  road \nnetwork  in  1996,  experienced  a  decline.  From  1996  to  2004,  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia \nsuffered a steep decline in coverage of paved roads, from 93.9% to 49.4% and from 93.5% \nto  39.4%,  respectively  (Appendix  Table  A.2),  mainly  due  to  poor  maintenance  and \ninsufficient budget for upgrading existing road networks. As of 2005, approximately 50\u201370% \nof  road  networks  in  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia  were  in  poor  condition  and  required \nrehabilitation  (Ziyadov  2008;  World  Bank  2008).  On  the  other  hand,  East  and  Southeast \nAsian  economies  such  as  Singapore  and  Hong  Kong,  China  improved  the  coverage  of \npaved roads to 100%. Several countries with a low proportion of initial paved roads did not \nshow any improvement.  \n\nAlthough East and Southeast Asia are increasing their coverage of paved roads, the quality \nof  road  network  is  still  much  lower  than  in  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries. Figure 2 shows that Asia has significantly lower road length \nper one million people (perhaps reflecting higher population density in Asia) road density per \n1,000km2 of land than the OECD average. \n\n                                                 \n5 This excludes the Pacific due to lack of data. \n\n 9\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nFigure 2: Road Network Indicators, by Region, 1996 and 2004  \n\nRoad per 1,000km2 of land area\n\nEast Asia Central and\n\nSouth Asia\n\nOECD\n\nWorld\n\nWest\n\nSoutheast\nAsia\n\nOther\ndeveloping\n\nRoad per 1 million people, by region, 1996 and 2004\n\ns\nr\ne\nt\ne\nm\no\nl\ni\n\nK\n\n1800\n\n1600\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\ns\nr\ne\nt\ne\nm\no\nl\ni\n\nK\n\n25000\n\n20000\n\n15000\n\n10000\n\n5000\n\n0\n\nEast Asia Central and\n\nSouth Asia\n\nOECD\n\nWorld\n\nWest\n\nSoutheast\nAsia\n\nOther\ndeveloping\n\n1996\n\n2004\n\nSource: World Development Indicators 2007 \n\nThe  region\u2019s  rail  network  totaled  182  thousand  kilometers,  or  around  two  fifths  of  the \nOECD\u2019s  472  thousand  kilometers  in  2005  (Appendix  Table  A.3).

This \nindicates that limited new rail routes were created while existing routes were not maintained. \nArmenia, Georgia, Pakistan and Viet Nam experienced declines in kilometers of rail routes. \nCommon reasons for the poor maintenance are insufficient budget, lack of awareness of the \nfull potential benefits of railways, and inadequate management of railway authorities.  \n\nThe volume of goods transported by railway increased dramatically worldwide during 1996\u2013\n2005,  with  Asia  recording  an  increase  of  about  50%  (Appendix  Table  A.3).  Among \nsubregions,  Central  and  West  Asian  rail  transport  grew  the  highest  at  85%.  Data  by \nindividual  country shows a  varying  trend (Appendix Table  A.5). Hong Kong, China\u2019s goods \ntransported  by  rail  decreased  by  more  than  four  times  while  Mongolia  and  Azerbaijan \nincreased rail freight by about four times. Hong Kong, China\u2019s fall in the volume of rail freight \nmay reflect less concentrated flows of bulk raw materials or fewer long-distance routes which \ngive rise to heavy rail freight flows, and good infrastructure for other modes of transportation \nfor its international trade. Conversely, railways are the main transportation mode for trade in \n\n 11\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nheavy bulk commodities from landlocked countries like Mongolia, where an increase in the \nvolume of rail freight mainly reflects an increase in the volume of trade.  \n\nAir transport increased faster in Asia than in the rest of the world during 1996\u20132005. Goods \nand passengers carried by air doubled in the region, with the highest increase (about three-\nfold) taking place in East Asia (Appendix Table A.4). Central and West Asia and the Pacific \nlag behind the other subregions in terms of airport infrastructure, as shown in the individual \ncountry  data  provided  in  Table  A.6.  Several  countries  in  Central  and  West  Asia  and  the \nPacific  such  as  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Marshall  Islands,  and  Solomon  Islands  had  low  and \ndeclining air transport.  \n\ntransport,  by  which  most  merchandise  moves \n\nSea \nincreased \ndramatically  in  the  region  in  recent  years  (Appendix  Table  A.7).  The  world\u2019s  largest  three \nshipbuilding  countries  are  Republic  of  Korea  (1);  Japan  (2)  and  PRC  (3),  accounting  for \napproximately 86% of the world total (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) 2005). Appendix Table A.7 illustrates the increasing trend \nin sea transportation across countries.  \n\ninternationally,  also \n\nIn  general,  transport  infrastructure  has  been  improving  in  the  region  over  the  last  few \ndecades.  However,  transportation  of  people  and  goods  across  different  types  of  transport \nmodes  is  not  evenly  developed  in  many  Asian  and  Pacific  countries  (UNESCAP  2006). \nCountries  with  maritime  coastlines  are  more  oriented  towards  their  major  seaports  and \ninternal  land  transport  systems  are  not  always  properly  linked,  due  to  a  lack  of \ncomprehensive policies joining different transportation modes and logistics networks.  \n\nB. \n\nEnergy Infrastructure \n\nIn  2004,  the  region  (excluding  Pacific  due  to  lack  of  data)  produced  4,057  billion  kWh  of \nelectric power and consumed 3,630 billion kWh of electricity (Appendix Table A.8). Although \nboth  electricity  production  and  consumption  almost  doubled  the  levels  of  1996,  Asia  still \nremains  below  OECD  levels.  Figure  4  illustrates  the  level  of  per  capita  electricity \nconsumption by region.  \n\nFor  individual  countries,  Appendix  Tables  A.9  and  A.10  demonstrate  a  wide  diversity  of \nelectricity  production  and  consumption  balances  in  the  region.  Economies  such  as  Hong \nKong,  China;  Republic  of  Korea;  and  Singapore  have  electricity  consumption  per  capita  of \nmore  than  5000  kWh  while  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  India,  Nepal,  Sri  Lanka,  Indonesia,  and \nMyanmar  experience  less  than  500  kWh  of  electricity  consumption  per  capita.  In  terms  of \nelectric power production, PRC alone generates more than half the region\u2019s total electricity.  \n\n 12\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nFigure 4: Electric Power Consumption Per Capita, KWh \n\nElectric power consumption per capita, kWh\n\nh\nW\nk\n\n12,000\n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\nEast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nCentral and\nWest Asia\n\nSoutheast\nAsia\n\nOther\ndeveloping\n\nOECD\n\nWorld\n\n1996\n\n2004\n\n \n\nSource: World Development Indicators 2007 \n\nIn 2004, the region produced 24% of the world\u2019s electricity, up by seven percentage points \nfrom the 1996 level (Appendix Table A.10). However, by subregion only East Asia accounted \nfor  a  notable  increase  in  electric  power  production,  while  other  regions  showed  a  minor \nincrease or no change in their world shares.  \n\nIn terms of energy resources, the region has considerable fossil fuel resources, accounting \nfor  7%,  12%,  and  32%  of  global  oil,  natural  gas,  and  coal  reserves,  respectively,  in  2006 \n(Table 2). However, some countries are net exporters while others are net importers. Central \nand West Asia has substantial oil and natural gas reserves whereas East and South Asian \ncountries are endowed with rich reserves in coal. The largest reserves are concentrated in a \nfew countries, with PRC, Kazakhstan, and India together accounting for 98% of the total coal \nreserves in the region in 2006 and Kazakhstan alone having almost the half the region\u2019s oil \nreserves (Appendix Table A.15).  \n\nTable 2: Proven Energy Reserves, by percentage, 2006 \n\n   Region \nDeveloping Asia \nEast Asia \n \nCentral and West \n \nThe Pacific \n \nSouth Asia \n \n \nSoutheast Asia \nOther developing \nOECD \n \n \nWorld \n\nGas \n12 \n1 \n6 \n0 \n1 \n4 \n80\n9 \n \n100 \n\nCoal \n32 \n13 \n5 \n.. \n13 \n1 \n32 \n37 \n \n100 \n\nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported. The world total is based on data \nfor 48 countries. \n\nSource: World Resources Institute, Energy and Resources Database 2008. \n\nDespite  its  energy  resources,  developing  Asia  is  a  net  importer  of  energy,  accounting  for \nabout 23% of world energy production and 25% of world energy consumption in 2001 (Table \n\nOil \n7 \n1 \n4 \n.. \n0 \n1 \n87\n6 \n \n100 \n\n 13\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\n3).  Most  of  the  energy  production  and  consumption  occurred  in  East  Asia  and  to  a  lesser \nextent in South Asia, due to high demand for energy in the larger emerging economies such \nas  PRC  and  India.  Asia\u2019s  energy  infrastructure  therefore  faces  a  critical  challenge  to  meet \nincreasing demand for energy and  imported energy or fuel  is likely to become  increasingly \nimportant in planning for infrastructure facilities.  \n\nTable 3: Total Energy Production and Consumption, by percentage, 2001 \n\n  \n\n  \n   Region \nDeveloping Asia \nEast Asia \n \nCentral and West \n \nSouth Asia \n \nSoutheast Asia \n \n \n \nWorld \n\nTotal Energy  \n\nProduction \n\nConsumption \n\n23\n11\n3\n5\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n100\n\n25 \n13 \n2 \n6 \n4 \n\n100 \n\nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported.

Both  export  and  import  shares  of  fossil  fuels \nincreased  from  their  1990  levels.  By  subregion,  Southeast  Asia  exported  almost  half  of \nAsia\u2019s fuel exports while East Asia\u2019s energy imports accounted for half of Asia\u2019s total energy \nimports. But the pattern differs by type of fossil fuel (Appendix Tables A.16\u2013A.19). \n\nTable 4: Total Fossil Fuel Trade, Thousand Tons of Oil Equivalent \n\n  \n\nImports \n\nExports \n\n \n   Region \n2003  \n  \n13  \nDeveloping Asia \n3  \n  East Asia \n3  \n  Central and West \n0  \n  South Asia \n7  \n  Southeast Asia \n59  \nOther developing \n28  \nOECD \n \n \n \nTotal \n100  \nNote: Regional aggregates are calculated based on data for counties who reported.

Kazakhstan,  with  the \ngreatest  oil  reserves  in  the  region,  alone  constituted  approximately  20%  of  Asia\u2019s  total  oil \nexports.  Almost  all  of  the  region\u2019s  natural  gas  exports  occurred  from  Central,  West,  and \nSoutheast  Asia,  with Turkmenistan  and Indonesia  contributing  33%  and  32%,  respectively. \nOn the other hand, East Asia took up half of developing Asia\u2019s natural gas imports (Appendix \nTable A.21). East and Southeast Asia were the main source of coal exports, accounting for \nabout  90%  of  Asia\u2019s  coal  exports  in  2003.  While  a  major  coal  exporter,  East  Asia  also \nimports  65%  of  Asia\u2019s  coal  imports,  of  which  Republic  of  Korea  alone  imports  50% \n(Appendix Table A.22).  \n\n 14\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nThe share in energy consumption of industry  declined in the world over recent years while \nthat  in  transportation  remained  more  or  less  the  same.  The  transportation  sector  in  Asia \nuses less energy than the world average but, in absolute terms, the twofold growth of energy \nconsumption  in  transportation  in  Asia  was  the  highest  in  the  world,  compared  to  the  world \naverage of around 1.3\u20131.7 times during 1990\u20132003 (Appendix Table A.23). \n\nAsian and Pacific countries need to invest in electricity generating capacity and transmission \nand distribution networks to sustain their current growth rates. The region has considerable \ncommercial  and  renewable  energy  resources.  This  provides  an  opportunity  for  trans-\nboundary energy cooperation in utilizing these resources to achieve shared benefits for the \ncountries  involved.  There  are  also  further  opportunities  to  increase  generation  of  electric \npower using natural gas or hydropower in the region.  \n\nC. \n\nICT Infrastructure \n\nA  total  of  1.2  billion  people  in  the  region  subscribed  to  telephone  service  in  2005,  almost \nnine times that in 1996 (Appendix Table A.11). Despite this dramatic increase, the region still \nlags  behind  OECD  levels.  East  Asia  showed  the  highest  telephone  density  among \nsubregions whereas the Pacific had the lowest at 119 subscribers, about eight times lower \nthan  the  East  Asia\u2019s  level  (Appendix  Table  A.11).  Except  for  East  Asia,  all  subregions \nsuffered lower telephone density than non-Asian developing counterparts. The pattern also \nholds when comparing telephone coverage by mobile and fixed line phones.  \n\nThe  number  of  internet  users  has  increased  dramatically  all  over  the  world,  increasing  10 \ntimes  during  1996\u20132005  (Appendix  Table  A.12).  The  average  increase  in  Asia  was  a \nremarkable  more  than  200  times  during  the  period  whereas  OECD  countries  experienced \nonly  a  four  times  increase.  However,  some  quality  indicators  such  as  internet  users  per \n1,000 people, secure internet servers, and internet speed are still much lower in developing \nAsia than in OECD countries (Appendix Table A.13).  \n\nVII. \n\nSOFT INFRASTRUCTURE \n\nIn addition to the administrative aspects of trade facilitation, other forms of soft infrastructure \ninfluence  international  trade.  These  include  (among  others)  availability  of  adequate  credit \nand  foreign  exchange  at  reasonable  rates,  a  reliable  system  of  legal  recourse,  effective \ncompetition policy, and the capacity of existing human capital to process exchanges. Indeed, \nsoft  infrastructure  may  often  be  more  important  than  physical  infrastructure  for  increasing \ntrade and its profitability.  \n\nInefficient  or  burdensome  institutional  structures,  bureaucracy,  and  policy  may  lead  to \nreduced  or  foregone  gains  from  international  trade.  During  2006\u20132007,  most  developing \nAsian countries were actively reforming their trade policies, with India being the top reformer. \nIndia introduced an online declaration system for imports and exports, reducing the time to \ntrade  (World  Bank  2007).  On  average,  producers  in  the  region  spend  about  one  month  to \nexport  whereas  exporting  takes  only  10  days  for  their  OECD  counterparts.  By  subregion, \nCentral and West Asia is still costlier than the rest of Asia although some countries such as \nArmenia  are  continuously  reforming  to  make  trading  across  borders  easier  (Table  5).  The \npattern  is  similar  for  importing,  with  time  and  cost  to  import  being  slightly  higher  than \nexporting in the region (Table A.14).  \n\n 15\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nTable 5: Costs of Exporting, by Region, 2006\u20132007 \n\nDocuments for Import  \n(number) \n\nTime for Import  \n(days) \n\nCost to Import  \n(US$ per container) \n\nRegion \n  \n\n  \n  \nDeveloping Asia and the \nPacific \n \n \n \n \n \nOther developing \nOECD1 \n \n \nWorld2 \n\nEast Asia \nCentral and West \nThe Pacific \nSouth Asia \nSoutheast Asia \n\n \n7 \n11 \n8 \n9 \n8 \n8 \n\n5 \n \n\n8 \n\n \n25 \n58 \n28 \n28 \n24 \n33 \n\n10 \n \n\n30 \n\n \n1,224 \n2,511 \n1,112 \n1,318 \n828 \n1,522 \n\n997 \n \n\n1,430 \n\nNote: 1 Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, and Republic of Korea are not included  \nin OECD average as they are grouped into developing countries. Other 23 OECD economies are included.  \n\n2 The world aggregates were estimated based available data from 179 countries. \n\nSource: World Bank 2008 \n\nIn the case of Indonesia, Patunru, Nurridzki, and Rivayani (forthcoming 2009) find that soft \ninfrastructure  plays  a  vital  role  in  constraining  port  efficiency,  more  so  than  hard \ninfrastructure,  although  the  two  are  interlinked.  Sea  port  competitiveness  may  suffer  from \npoor  physical  infrastructure  such  as  inadequate  channel  depth,  shortage  of  berths,  and \nlimited  cargo  handling  equipment,  storage  and  transit  areas,  but  it  may  also  suffer  from \nlimitations  in  soft  infrastructure,  such  as  labor  skills,  regulation,  bureaucracy,  and  other \ninstitutional  factors  affecting  port  capacity  utilization.  Lack  of  direct  competition  between \nports controlled by the same government authority is also a critical factor. \n\nExploiting complementarity of hard and soft infrastructure raises overall trade and economic \nperformance. This is especially noticeable in the case of networks. Many communication and \ninfrastructure  services  that  are  important  for  economic  development  and  trade  expansion \nexhibit  network  externalities.  Infrastructure  networks  exhibiting  service  externalities  include \ntelephones,  railways,  and  water  supply  systems  (for  more  information,    see  Laffont  and \nTirole 2000). In the presence of such externalities, the maximum amount that consumers are \nwilling to pay for a good or service depends in part on the number of other consumers who \nalso  purchase  the  item  in  question.  This  interrelationship  calls  for  consideration  of  these \nnetwork systems\u2019 governance in competition policy.  \n\nInfrastructure  improvements  generally  have  the  positive  effect  on  competition  of  applying \nequally  to  both  foreign  and  domestic  entrants.  This  is  particularly  true  when  infrastructure \nimprovements  are  complemented  by  effective  competition  policy  that  constrains  monopoly \npower and removes barriers to entry (Brooks 2005). Hummels et al. (2007) demonstrate that \nocean  liners  charge  freight  rates  that  are  much  higher  for  goods  whose  import  demand  is \nrelatively inelastic, indicating that shipping firms were likely exercising market power. \n\nVIII. \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND TRADE PATTERNS \n\nA notable feature of developing Asia\u2019s intraregional trade is the growing volume of shipments \nof  parts  and  components  across  national  borders.  Fragmentation  of  production  supply \nchains  and  sourcing  raw  and  intermediate  inputs  from  wherever  costs  (including  incurred \ntrade costs) are lowest  has  yielded benefits for  both producers and  consumers, as  well as \ntax  revenues  for  government  budgets.  To  compete  for  larger  shares  in  these  benefits, \ncountries  have  been  striving  to  lower  their  costs  by  increasing  the  quantity  and  quality  of \n\n 16\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\ninfrastructure  services  to  support  the  production,  distribution,  and  international  trade  of  a \nwidening array of intermediate goods and services. \n\nHummels  (forthcoming  2009)  looks  at  four  types  of  recent  changes  in  the  composition  of \ntrade  and  their  effects  on  demand  for  transportation:  (1)  changes  in  the  ratio  of  weight  to \nvalue of traded goods, (2) demand for timeliness and the shift towards increased air shipping, \n(3)  new  trade  flows  (both  of  products  and  geographical routes)  and  variation  in  the  size  of \nshipments,  and  (4)  production  fragmentation.  The  relationships  are  complex  since  the \ndevelopments  are  interlinked.  For  example,  declining  weight/value  ratios  and  vertical \nspecialization  in  the  fragmentation  of  new  production  supply  chains  generate  new  trade \nflows and patterns which spur the rapid growth in Asian air cargo shipments. \n\nWhen infrastructure development lowers the marginal cost of trade, there can be increases \nin  exports  at  both  the  extensive  and  intensive  margins.  The  expansion  at  the  extensive \nmargin (of new products, to new destinations), typically through small shipments from small \nfirms, influences the types of infrastructure demanded differently than does the deepening of \nexisting trade flows. This is especially true for transportation infrastructure demand. ICT may \nalso  be  of  particular  importance  in  establishing  and  consolidating  new  markets.  When  the \nnew markets are inland, air transport may be a viable alternative to a combination of sea and \nland  freight  to  avoid  and  reduce  potential  port  congestion,  noting  that  the  shipping  time \nsavings are positively correlated with the shipping distances involved.  \n\nFigure 5: Intraregional Trade (% of total exports) \n\n60.0%\n\n50.0%\n\n40.0%\n\n30.0%\n\n20.0%\n\n10.0%\n\n0.0%\n\n* 1998\n\nSub-Saharan\nAfrica*\n\nEast Asia (15)\n\nSAARC\n\nMERCOSUR (10)\n\n1995\n\n2003\n\n \n\nSources: World Bank African Database 2005, Asian Development Bank 2006, International Monetary Fund, Direction \nof Trade Statistics 2006. \n\nAs infrastructure expanded in Asia, particularly in East Asia, trade costs fell and altered the \ncomparative  advantages  of  countries  in  the  region,  making  greater  fragmentation  of \nproduction  supply  chains  possible  and  spurring  the  region\u2019s  intraregional  trade  in \nintermediate products. The subsequent economic integration in East Asia is  sharply higher \nthan in other developing regions (Figure 5). When inputs are being sourced from wherever \ncosts  are  lowest  and  the  production  process  increasingly  dispersed  geographically,  then \ntimeliness and reliability of delivery become critical factors and the influence of both physical \nand  institutional  infrastructure  services  is  even  more  apparent.  In  support  of  its  production \nfragmentation, East Asia\u2019s performance again stands out relative to other developing regions \n(Table 6). \n\n 17\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\n Item \n\nEast Asia \n\nSouth Asia \n\nSub-Saharan\nAfrica \n\nLatin America \n& Caribbean \n\nTable 6: Border Trade Costs \n\nDocuments for export \n(number) \n\nTime for export \n\nCost to export (US$ per \ncontainer) \n\nDocuments for import \n(number) \n\nTime for import (days) \n\nCost to import (US$ per \ncontainer) \n\nSource: World Bank 2008. \n\n8.2 \n\n40 \n\n1,561 \n\n12.2 \n\n51.5 \n\n1,947 \n\n6.9 \n\n23.9 \n\n885 \n\n9.3 \n\n25.9 \n\n1,037 \n\n8.1 \n\n7.3 \n\n34.4 \n\n1,236 \n\n22.2 \n\n1,068 \n\n12.5 \n\n9.5 \n\n41.5 \n\n1,495 \n\n27.9 \n\n1,226 \n\nInfrastructure  influences  not  only  absolute,  but  comparative,  advantage.  Differences \nbetween countries in the quality of infrastructure services help to explain differences in total \nfactor  productivity.  These  impacts  on  productivity  vary  across  sectors,  depending  on  how \nintensively  each  sector  uses  infrastructure  services  and  how  reliant  it  is  on  good  quality \ninfrastructure  services  (and  the  availability  of  alternative  production  processes).  Thus, \npatterns of specialization and trade are determined in part by the influence of infrastructure \nservice quality on comparative advantage. Moreover, limitations in factor endowments may \nbe  mitigated  by  infrastructure  services,  also  affecting  the  dynamics  of  comparative \ninfrastructure  services  may  serve  either  as \nadvantage.  Under  different  conditions, \ncomplements to, or substitutes for, physical inputs. The significance of factor endowments in \ndetermining  comparative  advantage  may  thus  be  modified  by  infrastructure  development \n(Brooks and Leuterio 1997; Yeaple and Golub 2002).  \n\nThe surge in oil prices during 2008 raised shipping (and therefore import) costs, shifting the \nbalance  in  favor  of  domestic  producers  and  inflation.  Such  changes  as  this  can  have  a \ndouble or greater impact on products in international supply chains as both imported inputs \nand exported final products register higher prices. For example, PRC steel exported to the \nUS  and  produced  with  iron  ore  imported  from  Brazil  would  be  hit  twice  by  higher  fuel \ncharges. The impact is greater where the goods (or their imported components) are shipped \nby  air  or  have  a  high  weight-to-value  ratio  and  therefore  where  fuel  accounts  for  a  higher \nshare of freight costs. \n\nin  order \n\nto  strengthen \n\nMalaysia  is  a  prime  example  of  a  country  where  the  government  has  actively  promoted \ninfrastructure  development \nits  competitive  and  comparative \nadvantage.  Since  the  mid-1980s,  Malaysia  has  pursued  a  FDI-led,  export-oriented \ndevelopment strategy, with FDI contributing to the economy\u2019s integration in global production \nnetworks. As Tham, Devadason, and Heng (forthcoming 2009) point out, foreign firms have \nbeen attracted to Malaysia as a key link in global supply chains by the country\u2019s competitive \nlocational advantages, which in turn are closely linked to its infrastructure development and \nresulting high quality services. Institutional infrastructure at the macroeconomic level, in the \nform of exchange rate policy, has also played an important role. \n\nTham et al. elucidate the role of infrastructure in attracting export-oriented FDI by observing \nFDI\u2019s sectoral and locational pattern and through  interviews with  local managers of foreign \nfirms\u2019 subsidiaries involved in international trade. The location of FDI is shown to be biased \ntoward  areas  with  relatively  good  infrastructure  and  amenities.  Thus,  infrastructure \nimprovements  increase  the  chances  of  attracting  FDI,  which  in  Asia  has  frequently  been \ndirected  toward  export  sectors,  in  turn,  influencing  patterns  and  quantities  of  imported  raw \nmaterials and intermediate inputs.  \n\n 18\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nAmiti  and  Javorcik  (2006)  find  that  market  and  supplier  access  are  the  most  important \nfactors  affecting  foreign  entry,  and  have  about  four  times  as  great  an  effect  as  production \ncosts on choice of foreign investment location. In particular they find that in PRC, access to \nmarkets and suppliers  within the province of entry matters more than access to the rest of \nthe  country,  consistent  with  observed  market  fragmentation.  An  increase  of  one  standard \ndeviation in the number of sea berths is found to increase foreign entry by about 11%, while \na  one  standard  deviation  increase  in  the  length  of  rail  lines  increases  it  by  7%.  This \nreinforces the observation that provinces with more developed ports, and to a lesser extent a \nmore  developed  rail  network,  tend  to  attract  greater  FDI  flows.  Over  time,  however, \ncongestion,  security  concerns,  connectivity  of  airports,  and  delays  in  processing  trade \ndocumentation may reduce the positive  impact  of infrastructure on lowering trade  costs for \nforeign investors. \n\nIX. \n\nLOGISTICS \n\nSuccessful  production  and  trade  networks  demand  superior  logistics  services  and  centers \nsuch as Singapore; Taipei,China; Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Thailand; \nand  PRC  have  built  well  developed  logistics  systems  to  facilitate  international  and \nintraregional trade. However, these logistics systems are still evolving and will come under \nincreasing strains as concentrations of economic activities expand inland. While East Asia\u2019s \ninternational  logistics  performs  relatively  well  compared  to  other  developing  regions,  South \nAsia\u2019s  does  not.  And  even  East  Asia\u2019s  performance  is  still  well  behind  that  of  high  income \ncountries (Figure 6). \n\nFigure 6: International Logistics Performance Index \n\nAll high income countries\n\nSouth Asia\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nMiddle East & North Africa\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\nEast Asia & Pacific\n\nEurope & Central Asia\n\nLPI\n\n 19\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n \n\nNote: International LPI mainly reflects infrastructure, customs, international shipments, logistics competence, tracking \n& tracing, domestic logistics costs, timeliness, etc. \n\nSource: World Bank 2007a. \n\nReducing  process  time  and  its  variability  in  fragmented  production  processes  depends  on \nintegrated logistics infrastructure. This can be crucial in sectors such as fashion clothing or \nauto parts where the use of just-in-time production and delivery processes are widespread. \nSeveral country specific studies suggest that inland locations would impose a large logistic \nburden:  for  example,  almost  63%  of  the  cost  of  transporting  goods  from  Chongqing  in  the \nPRC  to  the  west  coast  of  the  US  is  incurred  before  the  goods  arrive  at  the  PRC  port  for \nexport (Carruthers and Bajpai 2002). The deficiencies of Central Asian transport systems\u2014\nhigh costs coupled with low quality transport and logistics services\u2014have meant that close \nto 20% of the value of traded goods is accounted for by transport costs. A 20% reduction in \nlogistics costs would increase the trade to GDP ratio by more than 10% in Cambodia, Lao \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nPDR,  and  PRC;  over  15%  in  Mongolia;  and  by  more  than  20%  in  Papua  New  Guinea \n(Carruthers and Bajpai 2002).  \n\nThe  challenges  of  providing  efficient  logistical  support  rise  as  countries  move  into \nprogressively  more  complex  and higher-value  manufacturing,  and  as production  processes \nbecome increasingly fragmented. As new countries and regions join these supply chains and \nAsian  production  networks  expand  over  a  larger  and  more  diffuse  space,  logistics \nrequirements  become  more  sophisticated  and  demanding, \nincreasing  pressure  on \nunderlying infrastructure, both hard and soft. Already there is a premium on timeliness and \nreliability  of  delivery,  care  and  security  in  handling  and  transporting,  and  certification  and \nstandardization of product quality. Both the quantity and quality of logistics services in trade \ncreate  competitiveness  and  value  added.  Freight-forwarding,  warehousing,  storage, \npackaging,  shipping  services,  and  ICT  infrastructure  services  are  becoming  increasingly \nimportant.  \n\nAs  supply  chains  have  fragmented  both  domestically  and  internationally,  managing  and \ncoordinating  the  various  steps  in  a  production  process  must  now  be  complemented  by \nmanaging  and  coordinating  the  service  links  between  those  steps,  often  at  great  distance. \nMinimizing monetary and time costs while ensuring reliability of delivery service depends on \nthe services of efficient logistics systems. \n\nThe  linkage  between  the  quality  of  logistics  and  type  of  commodity  being  transported \ninvolves  three  factors  (Arnold  forthcoming  2009).  First  is  the  value  of  the  commodity  per \nshipment unit, e.g., per metric ton or twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). Second is the shelf \nlife of the commodity, reflecting physical deterioration or volatility of demand. The third factor \nis  the  scheduling  requirements  of  the  importers,  such  as  just-in-time  manufacturers,  or \nretailers with coordinated national sales programs. \n\nX. \n\nPORT AND MODAL CHOICE \n\nAsian  infrastructure  has  expanded  quickly  to  support  the  region\u2019s  rapid  trade  growth  and \neconomic integration relative to other developing regions (Figure 7 and Table 7). However, \nthe  growth  has  not  always  been  smooth  and  symmetric.  Just  as  the  financial  balance  of \ntrade  flows  is  frequently  uneven,  so  is  the  physical  balance  of  the  volumes  shipped. \nUnbalanced  international  trade  volume  creates  additional  costs  for  managing  shipping \ncapacity, utilization of infrastructure adjacent to port areas, and cargo clearance, as well as \npossible macroeconomic imbalances. With berth space in ports now a constraining factor in \nAsia\u2019s  trade  expansion,  exploiting  complementarities  with  other  modes  of  transportation \ninfrastructure becomes an urgent priority. At the same time, changes in production and trade \npatterns  are  affecting  modal  usage.  For  example,  greater  shipments  of  goods  with  higher \nvalue  per  unit  weight  and  sharply  higher  reward  for  timeliness  of  delivery  are  reducing  the \nrelative importance of sea transportation vis-\u00e0-vis air, although sea shipments still dominate \noverall. \n\n 20\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nFigure 7: Paved Roads \n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nl\na\nt\no\nT\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n  \n\n1990\n\n1999-2003\n\nEast Asia & Pacific\n\nLatin America & Caribbean\n\nSouth Asia\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\n\nSource: World Bank 2007b. \n\nMerchandise Trade (% of \nGDP) \nGross Fixed Capital Formation \n(% of GDP) \nGross Domestic Savings (% of \nGDP) \nCumulative inward FDI flows \n(billions US$) \nIntra-regional Trade Shares* \n(%)  \nInfrastructure \n\nElectricity Consumption \n(kWh per capita) \nFixed Line and Mobile \nSubscribers (per 1,000) \nInternet Users (per 1,000) \n\nElectric Power \nTransmission and \nDistribution Losses (% of \noutput) \nPaved Roads (% of total) \n\nSource: World Bank 2007b. \n\n \n\n44.2\n\n19.5\n\n23.8\n\nTable 7: Intraregional Comparisons \n\n  \n\nAfrica\n\nEast \nAsia \n\nSouth \nAsia \n\nLAC \n\n1990\u20132005 \n\n125.0\n\n1340.0\n\n65.0 \n\n725.0\n\n12.2\n\n55.0\n\n6.0 \n\n15.0\n\n57.8\n\n18.4\n\n17.9\n\n74.6\n\n33.8\n\n37.9\n\n31.2 \n\n22.9 \n\n20.1 \n\n \n\n513.0\n\n1184.3\n\n393.9 \n\n1614.5\n\n90.6\n\n29.0\n\n12.0\n\n431.7\n\n75.3 \n\n496.0\n\n88.6\n\n7.3\n\n49.0 \n\n26.4 \n\n156.1\n\n16.1\n\n2005 \n\n2004 \n\n2004 \n\n2003 \n\n \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2003 \n\n1999\u20132003 \n\n12.5\n\n32.3\n\n53.9 \n\n26.8\n\n 21\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nAir  cargo  involving  Asian  nations  has  grown  much  faster  than  at  the  global  level,  with \nespecially  rapid  growth  involving  intra-Asian  international  flights.  The rapid  growth  in  Asian \nair cargo is driven by declining weight/value ratios of products shipped and steep declines in \nthe price of air cargo. For air shipping, average revenue per ton-kilometer shipped dropped \nby a factor of 10 between 1955 and 2004, largely due to technological advances (Hummels \n2007).  In  addition,  four  factors  seem  especially  important:  rising  incomes,  vertical \nspecialization/fragmentation  of  production,  entry  into  new  markets  (often  on  a  trial  basis), \nand trade between geographically remote locations. \n\nHigher income consumers in higher income countries demand higher quality imports. Rising \nincomes  affect  demand  for  air  transport  in  three  ways.  First,  higher  quality  goods  have \nhigher prices and therefore transportation cost is a lower ad-valorem share of the delivered \nprice.  Second,  as  consumers  grow  richer,  so  does  their  willingness  to  pay  for  particular \nproduct  characteristics.  That  offers  incentive  for  producers  to  manufacture  to  specification, \nand to adjust production and shipments quickly and flexibly. Third, delivery speed is itself an \nimportant aspect of product quality for many consumers, and demand for timely delivery will \nrise as income grows (Hummels forthcoming 2009).  \n\nCargo owners\u2019 port choice is influenced by distance and time to ports, shipping routes and \nintended  destination(s),  and  total  costs.  Indirect  trade-offs  in  regulatory  compliance  and \nenforcement,  and  between  port  location  and  security  of  delivery  (and  quality  of  delivered \nproduct), also influence choices of ports and modes of transportation. \n\nProducers generally choose a port that is consistent with minimum distribution cost including \ntime  effectiveness,  regulatory  requirements,  and  unscheduled  costs,  as  well  as  monetary \ncosts.  Patunru  et  al.  (forthcoming  2009)  explore  exporters\u2019  assessments  of  sea  port \ncompetitiveness in the context of the Indonesian archipelago, where roughly 90% of external \ntrade  (and  much  of  domestic  trade)  passes  through  sea  ports.  Competition  may  be  in  the \nform of inter-port, intra-port, or intra-terminal competition. Comparing Tanjung Perak Port in \nSurabaya  and  Tanjung  Emas  Port  in  Semarang,  their  analysis  considers  captive  and \ncontestable  hinterlands  and  port-choice  decision  making  by  exporters  in  the  contestable \nhinterlands.  They  find  that  exporters  concerned  with  raw  materials  distribution  are  more \nlikely to exhibit the \u201ctrade follows the ships\u201d principle,  where exporters  are attracted to use \nports with shipping routes that best reach the desired markets. Regions more dominated by \nservice sector exports generally exhibit the \u201cships follow the trade\u201d principle, in which ships \nare routed to serve those regions.  \n\nWhile port performance is crucial to the Indonesian archipelago, capitalizing on the links and \ncomplementarities  between  different  modes  of  transportation  can  boost  trade  substantially. \nAir and sea ports can move more goods, particularly in containerized shipping, when served \nby  efficient  rail  and  road  networks,  ICT  infrastructure,  and  storage  yards.  Improvements  in \ninfrastructure service efficiency can lead to cost savings equivalent to moving production to \nlocations thousands of kilometers closer to trading partners.  \n\nMa and Zhang (forthcoming 2009) find that in recent years PRC exporters have experienced \nfluctuating  trends  in  freight  and  insurance  costs  for  ocean  trade  but  a  steady  decrease  in \nthose for air cargo. In 2002, the ad valorem costs of air freight and insurance fell below those \nof sea freight and insurance, and have remained lower since. Over the period from 1990 to \n2004,  the  share  of  air  cargo  was  relatively  constant  in  terms  of  weight  but  about  tripled  in \nterms of value. Their analysis finds that relative to the country\u2019s average trade with the rest \nof  the  world,  PRC\u2019s  exports  are  lower  and  declining  in  terms  of  the  weight-to-value  ratio \nwhile imports are higher and increasing (reflecting the rise in imports of raw materials). Like \nMalaysia,  PRC  is  expanding  port  infrastructure  partly  as  a  means  to  attract  FDI  from \npotential exporters and thereby increase both trade and competitiveness. \n\n 22\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nXI. \n\nTRADE-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND REGIONAL COOPERATION \n\nInfrastructure services can yield positive externalities. For example, developing a new road \ninfrastructure project to relieve congestion in port access produces advantages not only for \nthe users of the project but also for users of other roads where congestion is lessened as a \nresult  of  the  new  project.  Even  non-users  gain  through  reduction  of  pollution  and \nimprovement  of  the  natural  environment,  and  the  country  as  a  whole  benefits  through \nreduction of oil consumption or oil imports as well as increased trade benefits. \n\nEfforts  to  take  advantage  of  economies  of  scale  in  production,  procurement,  or  marketing, \nlead  firms  to  look  beyond  national  borders  for  both  trade  and  investment  opportunities. \nPromoting  efficient  financial  intermediation,  coordinating  and  promoting  regional  public \ngoods, reducing macroeconomic vulnerability to shocks, and strengthening security ties offer \ngovernments  similar  incentives  to  design,  develop,  and  manage  regional  infrastructure \ncooperation and integration. In this context, infrastructure is one of the \u201cthree I\u2019s,\u201d along with \nincentives  and  institutions,  that  are  key  determinants  of  overall  growth  and  the  magnitude \nand productivity of capital inflows as economies liberalize (Hill 2004).  \n\nincreasingly \n\nfragmented  and \n\ninternationally, \nAs  production  services  become \ncooperation among the economies participating in those production networks becomes more \ncrucial to maintain or raise an individual host country industry\u2019s competitiveness in supplying \nthose services. Regional  infrastructure  coordination  can  lower  infrastructure  costs and  limit \nenvironmental and other negative social impacts, while still contributing to trade expansion. \nIn  the  case  of  the  GMS,  special  forums  have  been  established  to  coordinate  transport, \ntelecommunications,  and  electric  power  infrastructure  developments,  particularly  for  the \ndevelopment of cross-country economic corridors (Asian Development Bank [ADB] 2006).  \n\ntraded \n\nInfrastructure  not  only  fosters  economic  growth,  but  also  strengthens  inclusiveness  and \nreduces  poverty.  Especially,  infrastructure  investment  that  reduces  trade  costs  facilitates \nregional  economic  integration  through  trade  and  investment  expansion,  which  motivates \nregional  cooperation,  including  cooperation  in  infrastructure  development,  generating  a \nvirtuous cycle. A simple depiction of the relationships is presented in Figure 8.6 \n\nFigure 8: Changes in Comparative Advantages \n\nInfrastructure\n\nTrade \nCosts\n\nTrade \nFlows\n\nChanges in \nComparative \nAdvantage\n\nRegional \nIntegration\n\nRegional \nCooperation\n\n 23\n\n                                                 \n6 I am grateful to Peter Rimmer for helpful suggestions in refining this diagram. \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nintraregional \n\nThe diversity of Asian economies, combined with infrastructure expansion and enhancement \nto  lower  trade  costs,  has  helped  the  region  to  capitalize  on  global  patterns  of  production \nfragmentation,  expanding \ntrade,  and  diversification  of  development \nopportunities.  The  impacts  of  trade-related  infrastructure  are  now  being  leveraged  by \ncoordination  across  borders  in  a  wide  variety  of  institutional  architectures  and  trade \nagreements. In this evolving international context, the role of harmonizing and strengthening \nsoft  infrastructure  stands  out  as  an  essential  partner  for  enhanced  physical  infrastructure. \nSupported  by  a  conducive  policy  environment  and  internalizing  regional  spillover  effects \nthrough  cooperative  arrangements,  the  expansion,  improvement,  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure  services  is  reducing  trade  costs  and  facilitating  trade  expansion,  regional \nintegration, and economic growth and development. \n\nWeiss  (2008)  presents  a  framework  for  considering  the  role  of  infrastructure  in  regional \ncooperation.  He  utilizes  a  modified  formulation  of  the  effective  rate  of  protection  to  flexibly \nquantify  the  empirical  significance  of  trade  cost  barriers  that  are  broader  than  the  familiar \ntariffs and quotas. Infrastructure investments and interventions, both hard and soft, are then \nseen  to  be  instruments  to  reduce  trade  costs  and  thereby  stimulate  closer  intraregional \ntrading linkages. In this manner, the height of barriers posed by different types of trade costs \nsuggests  a  rough  ranking  of  priorities  for  infrastructure  development  to  reduce  these \nbarriers, which vary across countries. \n\nFactors  like  high  freight  costs,  delays  in  customs  clearance,  unofficial  payments,  slow  port \nlanding and handling, and poor governance create barriers to trade. Institutional bottlenecks \n(administrative,  legal,  financial,  regulatory,  and  other  logistics  infrastructure),  information \nasymmetries,  and  discretionary  powers  that  give  rise  to  rent  seeking  activities  by \ngovernment  officials  at  various  steps  of  trade  transactions  also  impose  costs.  These  costs \ncan  be  lowered  through  cooperation  that  facilitates  trade  logistics  for  merchandise  and \nservices in both inbound and outbound shipments. \n\nAt the international level, cooperation through preferential trade and investment agreements \nthat  strengthen  structural  reforms  and  increase  the  attractiveness  of  a  location  for  foreign \ninvestment  can  leverage  domestic  policy  actions  and  their  impacts  on  growth,  equity  and \nefficiency,  and  may  help  to  reduce  corruption.  Cross-border  cooperation  in  building  and \nmaintaining soft infrastructure can therefore lead synergistically to a reduction in trade costs \nand  stimulate \ntrade,  production  and \nemployment, and growth.  \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nin  physical \n\ninvestment \n\nfurther \n\nXII. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nOver the next few decades, developing Asian economies are expected to make up most of \nthe fastest growing markets in the world. An important part of this growth will come through \ntrade  expansion,  regional  integration  through  the  fragmentation  of  production  networks \nacross national borders, and the broadening and deepening of international capital flows to \nsupport this trade and production expansion.  \n\nMajor  advances  have  been  made  in  Asia  in  the  provision  of  trade-related  infrastructure. \nHowever, further infrastructure development is required to sustain current economic growth \nand  regional  integration.  A  joint  ADB\u2013Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)\u2013\nWorld  Bank  (2005)  study  estimated  that  a  huge  amount\u2014more  than  US$200  billion  per \nyear\u2014is  needed  to  fund  estimated  needs  in  infrastructure.  New  or  improved  roads,  power \nplants,  communications facilities,  and  water  and  sanitation  systems  are  urgently  needed  in \ndeveloping countries across the region. The PRC alone is expected to require about 80% of \nthe total investment. Relative to their size, many smaller and poorer developing countries in \nthe region also face severe bottlenecks that call for large investments in infrastructure.  \n\nInternational  trade  is  growing  in  value  and  shrinking  in  weight  per  unit  value.  Exports  are \nexpanding  most  notably  at  the  extensive  margin,  diversifying  across  new  markets  with \n\n 24\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nsmaller  flows,  and  fragmented  production  networks  are  becoming  the  norm. Each  of these \ntrends puts emphasis on speed, flexibility, and information. Cross-border infrastructure that \nfacilitates  the  expansion  of  trade  along  these  lines  will  boost  a  country\u2019s  export \ncompetitiveness and its efficient integration into the global economy (Hummels forthcoming \n2009). \n\nThe  demand  for  information  and  related  services  such  as  finance  and  telecommunications \ncan  be  expected  to  grow  faster  than  the  demand  for  transportation  of  goods  and  people. \nSimilarly, as the density of economic activity increases with population and income growth, \nand  modern  flexible  manufacturing  practices  spread  and  move  production  closer  to \nconsumers,  there  is  likely  to  be  an  increasing  demand  for  short-haul  relative  to  long-haul \ntransportation  and \nthe  domestic  and \ninternational contexts.  \n\ninfrastructure \n\ninvestments \n\nfacilitating \n\nin  both \n\nEfforts to expand and enhance infrastructure services will reduce costs of doing business in \nAsia, of achieving economies of scale, and of international trade, helping to maximize growth \nand  the  benefits  of  regional  trade  and  investment  integration.  At  the  same  time, \ninfrastructure  improvements,  complemented  by  trade  expansion,  will  attract  and  facilitate \ngreater  investment  in  productive  capacity,  expand  access  to  markets  and  employment \nopportunities for the poor, and broaden the range of consumer choice for Asia\u2019s billions. \n\n 25\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 128 \n \n\n \n\nBrooks \n\nTable A.1: Road Transport, by Region, 1996 and 2004 \n\nAPPENDIX \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaved Roads \n % of Total Roads \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1996\n\n49.1\n58.7\n75.0\n23.7\n41.1\n47.2\n40.6\n\n81.4\n\n \n  \n \n2004   \n \n\n65.3  \n83.9  \n68.6  \n..\n \n46.0  \n62.5  \n46.4  \n\n79.9  \n \n\n \n\n \nTotal Roads Network \nThousand Kilometers \n2004\n\n1996 \n\n \n\n \n\n5,407.9 \n1,319.1 \n579.0 \n27.9 \n2,673.7 \n808.2 \n7,531.9 \n\n7,385.1\n2,022.1\n598.4\n..\n3,745.3\n1,019.4\n..\n\n11,300.0 \n\n14,000.0\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\nRegion \n\nRoad Transport \n  \n \n  \n \nDeveloping Asia and the \nPacific \n  East Asia \n  Central and West Asia \n  The Pacific \n  South Asia \n  Southeast Asia \nOther developing \nOECD1 \n \n \nWorld2 \n\nNote: 1 Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey, and Republic of Korea are not included \nin OECD average as they are grouped into developing countries.

Efficient infrastructure services lower transaction costs, raise value added, and \nincrease potential profitability while also increasing and expanding linkages to global supply \nchains and distribution networks for producers. Asia\u2019s trade patterns are characterized by a \nhigh  degree  of  intraregional  trade,  particularly  in  parts  and  components  for  geographically \nfragmented  production  networks.  This  is  both  in  response  to,  and  with  implications  for, \nfurther infrastructure development. Logistics services play a key role and the challenges of \nproviding efficient logistical support rise as countries move into progressively more complex \nand  higher-value  manufacturing,  and  as  production  processes  become  increasingly \nfragmented. \n", "JEL Classification: F15, F13, O19 \n", " \n", " \n \n", " 1\n"]}
