One cause has been the resurgence of capital flows, which \nmakes the issue of how to manage them relevant. However, the experience with regard to \ncapital  flows  among  East  Asian  economies  is  mixed  and  the  level  of  capital  flows  to  the \nregion  is  proportionally  less  than  that  prior  to  the  1997  crisis.  Another reason  is  the  rise in \ncurrent account surpluses. The Philippines has experienced both a return of capital inflows \nand a more favorable current account balance, with the latter largely due to remittances from \noverseas  workers.  However,  like  many  other  regional  currencies,  the  appreciation  of  the \npeso is not commensurate to movements of the BOP accounts. Currencies in the region are \nreacting  primarily  to  the  general  weakness  of  the  US  dollar,  and  global  uncertainties  have \ncontributed  to  weak  investment  which  in  turn  is  another  major  reason  behind  the  current \naccount  surplus  of  several  economies  including  the  Philippines.  Policy  measures  at  the \ndomestic  level  can  focus  on  reviving  private  investment,  particularly  channeling  overseas \nremittances  to  more  productive  investment.  Meanwhile,  East  Asian  financial  and  monetary \ncooperation  can  also  result  in  a  unified  front  aimed  at  overhauling  the  unipolar  global \nfinancial system. \n\nJEL Classification: F31, F32, F37 \n\n \n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T.

Yap \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe global financial instability that was spawned by the 1997 East Asian financial crisis \ngenerated a broad consensus that the international financial architecture (IFA) had to be \nreformed.  The  proposed  reforms  had  two  wide-ranging  objectives  (Griffith-Jones  and \nOcampo,  2003):  (i)  to  prevent  currency  and  banking  crises  and  better  manage  them \nwhen they occur; and (ii) to support adequate provision of net private and public flows to \ndeveloping  countries,  particularly  low-income  ones.  Much  progress  has  been  made  in \nterms of reforming the IFA during the past ten years. However, the progress has been \nuneven and asymmetric and in certain areas patchy (Griffith-Jones and Ocampo, 2003; \nWang, 2004; Kawai, 2005; World Bank, 2005; and Kawai and Houser, 2007). \n\nFor  example,  there  have  been  many  advances  in  terms  of  regional  financial  and \nmonetary cooperation in East Asia. Just last 5 May 2007, the ASEAN+3 nations agreed \nto pool the region\u2019s vast foreign currency reserves. However, the urgency of architectural \nreform  in  the  G-7  countries  has  receded  considerably  (Wang,  2004).  This  was  echoed \nby  Sakakibara  (2003)  when  he  argued  that  the  lack  of  global  governance,  including  a \nglobal  lender  of  last  resort  and  international  financial  regulation,  is  not  likely  to  be \nremedied  anytime  soon.  As  long  as  the  structural  problems  on  the  supply  side  of \ninternational capital such as volatile capital movements and G-3 exchange rate gyrations \npersist, the East Asian countries will remain as vulnerable to future crises. \n\nThere are many  indications of the inadequacies in the reform of the IFA. For example, \nTable  1  shows  that  in  2006  aggregate  net  resource  flows  into  developing  countries \nreached  $566  billion,  the  bulk  of  which  comprised  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  and \nportfolio equity. This $94 billion in \u201chot money\u201d that poured into developing countries in \n2006 is three times the peak reached in 1997. The development is largely brought about \nby a situation of excess global liquidity, which in turn is related to the problem of global \nmacroeconomic  imbalances.  With the abundance of global liquidity, investors are  lured \ninto  emerging  markets  which  offer  higher  returns.  The  resulting  inflow  of  capital  has \ncreated  \u201cimportant  challenges  for  policymakers  because  of  their  potential  to  generate \noverheating, loss of competitiveness, and increased vulnerability to crisis\u201d (IMF, 2007a).  \n\nThe  macroeconomic  difficulties  spawned  by  the  surge  in  capital  inflows  have  elicited \nvarious policy responses (IMF, 2007a): \n\n\u201cWhereas some countries have let exchange rates move \nupward, in many cases the monetary authorities have \nintervened heavily in foreign exchange markets to resist \nheavy currency appreciation. To varying degrees, they \nhave sought to neutralize the monetary impact of \nintervention through sterilization, with a view to forestalling \nan excessively rapid expansion of domestic demand. \nControls on capital inflows have been introduced or \ntightened, and controls on outflows eased, to relieve \nupward pressure on exchange rates. Fiscal policies have \nalso responded\u2014in some cases, stronger revenue growth \nfrom buoyant activity has been harnessed to achieve better \nfiscal outcomes, although in many countries rising \nrevenues have led to higher government spending.\u201d \n\n  3\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThe chart in Figure 1 shows that recently real effective exchange rates in four of the five \ncountries  hardest  hit  by  the  1997  crisis  are  generally  following  the  same  pattern \nobserved  prior  to  July  1997.1 Meanwhile,  many  economies  in  emerging  East  Asia  are \naccumulating  reserves  beyond  the  optimal  level,  either  to  self-insure  against  financial \ncrises  or  to  prevent  nominal  and/or  real  appreciation  of  their  currencies  in  the  face  of \nincreasing capital flows (see Figure 2). The stock of foreign exchange reserves in these \neconomies rose from an average of $289.5 billion in 1990\u201395 to $2.1 trillion at the end of \n2006.  \n\nIn this paper, the experience of the Philippines with regard to managing capital inflows\u2014\nor more generally foreign exchange inflows\u2014from 1987\u20132007 is reviewed, with focus on \nthe post\u20131997 period since earlier work (Lamberte, 1995) has adequately analyzed the \nexperienced prior to the crisis. The impact of foreign exchange inflows will be analyzed \nand the policy responses, particularly those initiated by the BSP will be evaluated. The \nfindings of this paper will be input into a cross-country study of managing capital flows in \nAsia. \n\nII. \n\nMANAGING CAPITAL FLOWS: KEY ISSUES \n\nDeterminants of Capital Flows \n\nThe surge in capital flows to emerging market economies in the past 20 years or so is a \nreflection of the rapid expansion and integration of international capital markets that had \nbeen driven by economic policy and structural changes, and technological factors. The \nlatter refer to revolutionary advances in handling of information and telecommunications \nand  the  emergence  of  increasingly  sophisticated  financial  engineering.  These  factors \nhave  increased  the  speed  and  complexity  of  capital  account  transactions.  Meanwhile, \neconomic  policy  and  structural  changes  from  the  standpoint  of  developing  economies \ncan  be  categorized  into  two  broad  groups:  those  that  are  country-specific,  or  \u201cpull\u201d \nfactors;  and  those  that  are  external  to  the  country  and  beyond  its  control,  or  \u201cpush\u201d \nfactors. \n\nOne  set  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  were  policies  that  improved  the  relations  of  heavily  indebted \ncountries  with  external  creditors.  A  key  element  was  the  role  of  debt-equity  swaps  in \nincreasing  the  expected  rate  of  return  on  domestic  investment  projects,  thereby \nencouraging FDI (Calvo et al., 1994). Successful price stabilization programs that were \naccompanied  by  improved  fiscal  policy  fundamentals  and  greater  macroeconomic \nstability  were  also  major  pull  factors.  Lastly,  institutional  reforms  such  as  the \nliberalization  of  the  capital  account  played  a  significant  role  in  attracting  capital  flows. \nIndeed, the right to repatriate dividends and capital may have been the most important \nfactor  in  the  surge  of  foreign  equity  flows  to  emerging  market  economies  (Taylor  and \nSarno, 1997). \n\nAmong the prominent \u201cpush\u201d factors were the decline in international interest rates and \neconomic \nreduced  profit \nopportunities  in  world  financial  centers  and  drove  international  capital  to  emerging \nmarket  economies.  Another  type  of  push  factor  was  in  the  mode  of  contagion  effects. \n\nindustrialized  countries.  These \n\nrecessions \n\nfactors \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n1 The underlying factors are quite different, however. The sharp appreciation of REER prior to the crisis was \ndue  largely  to  the  depreciation  of  the  yen.  The  recent  appreciation  of  REER  is  due  more  to  nominal \ncurrency appreciation as a result of foreign exchange inflows and general weakness of the dollar. \n\n  4\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nLarge shifts in capital flows to one or two large countries in a region may have generated \nexternalities for the smaller neighboring countries (Calvo et al., 1996). \n\nIn terms of actual policy adjustments, regulatory changes in the US and Europe made it \neasier for foreign firms to place their equity and bonds under more attractive conditions \nto  investors.  This  facilitated  the  trend  towards  international  portfolio  diversification. \nMeanwhile,  competition  and  rising  labor  costs  in  industrialized  countries,  along  with \nfalling  transport  and  communications  costs,  induced  firms  to  seek  opportunities  to \nincrease  efficiency  and  returns  by  producing  abroad  (Rana,  1998).  The  realignment  of \nmajor  currencies  contributed  to  this  process.  The  result  has  been  a  progressive \nglobalization of production and the growth of FDI flows. \n\nA crucial debate has been on the relative importance of \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d factors in the \nevolution of capital flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors were the primary determinants of capital flows \ninto  emerging  market  economies,  this  would  support  the  optimistic  view  that  the \nsustainability of these flows is to a large extent a function of domestic policies under the \ncontrol  of  developing  countries.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  surge  in  capital  flows  was \nmostly a result of \u201cpush\u201d factors, particularly interest rate movements, this would support \nthe  view  that  the  capital  flows  are  highly  volatile  because  they  are  subject  to  factors \nbeyond the control of policymakers (Fernandez-Arias, 1996). \n\nThe empirical evidence has generally been mixed. Some analysts argue that the weight \nof  the  evidence  favors  the  push  view\u2014that  falling  US  interest  rates  have  played  a \ndominant  role  in  driving  capital  flows  to  developing  countries  (Fernandez-Arias  and \nMontiel,  1996).  Other  studies  have  shown  that  country  specific  factors\u2014e.g.  the \ndomestic credit rating and black market exchange premium\u2014have been as important in \ninfluencing  capital  flows,  particularly  portfolio  flows  (Taylor  and  Sarno,  1997).  The \nprimacy  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors,  however,  can  be  questioned  on  several  counts.  Although  it  is \ntrue  that  not  all  countries  have  been  recipients  of  the  new  inflows,  it  is  also  true  that \nflows  have  not  been  restricted  to  countries  with  well-established  track  records  of \nmacroeconomic  and  structural  adjustment.  Second,  country  creditworthiness  depends \nnot  only  on  domestic  factors  but  also  on  the  international  interest  rate.  Third,  the \nsignificant  role  of  contagion  in  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  points  to  the  relative \nstrength of \u201cpush\u201d factors. \n\nKnowledge  of  the  determinants  of  capital  flows  has  profound  implications  in  terms  of \nappropriate  policy  responses.  In  this  context,  the  overriding  objective  of  economic \nmanagers is to maximize the benefits of capital flows and minimize their costs. \n\nAdvantages of Greater Capital Mobility \n\nGreater  capital  mobility  is  generally  viewed  to  be  advantageous  to  the  process  of \neconomic  development.  Capital  flows  to  emerging  market  economies  have  eased  the \ndomestic  savings  constraint,  which  in  turn  has  increased  investment,  thereby  boosting \neconomic  growth.  To  the  extent  that  real  returns  to  marginal  investment  are  lower  in \ncapital-rich  countries  than  those  in  capital-scarce  countries,  the  movement  of  capital \nfrom  developed  economies  to  emerging  market  economies  improves  the  efficiency  of \nworld resource allocation (Devlin, Ffrench-Davis and Griffith-Jones, 1995). \n\nInstead  of  raising  the  investment  rate  indirectly  by  providing  more  resources,  capital \nflows may do so directly in the form of FDI. This type of inflow usually brings a range of \n\n  5\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\ndynamic  benefits  such  as  technology,  improved  management  practices  and  greater \naccess to international markets. \n\nThe  availability  of  international  capital  also  provides  an  economy  the  ability  to  smooth \nexpenditures  especially  in  the  advent  of  adverse  exogenous  shocks.  Meanwhile,  an \nopen  capital  account  for  both  developed  and  emerging  market  economies  allows  for \ngreater  portfolio  diversification  and  better  management  of  risk  on  the  part  of  investors. \nThis  is  one  of  the  more  common  arguments  at  the  microeconomic  level  for  capital \naccount liberalization (Devlin et al., 1995). \n\nDrawbacks of Greater Capital Mobility \n\nThe Asian financial crisis was a painful reminder of the risks associated with more open \ncapital  accounts.  Foreign  capital \nthreaten \nmacroeconomic  stability.  This  situation  becomes  likely  if  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the \neconomy falls below the level of the capital inflows. Such a disparity arises because of \npolicy  arbitrage,  where  capital  flows  are  attracted  by  the  sound  fundamentals  of  an \neconomy  causing  financial  markets  to  allocate  too  much  or  too  little  capital  to  some \nrecipients at a given moment (Guitian, 1998). \n\nflows  may  cause \n\nimbalances \n\nthat \n\nIf  an  economy  has  a  flexible  exchange  rate  regime,  capital  inflows  will  lead  to  an \nappreciation of the nominal and real exchange rates. This will have an adverse  impact \non  the  competitiveness  of  exports  and  import-substituting  industries  and  result  in  a \ndeterioration  of  the  current  account  balance.  The  resource  allocation  effects  of  a  real \nexchange  rate  appreciation  may  also  spawn  asset  price  bubbles  and  rapid  credit \nexpansion that could jeopardize the stability of the financial system. \n\nIn a fixed-exchange rate regime, capital inflows lead to a real exchange rate appreciation \nvia  inflationary  pressure  brought  about  by  the  increase  in  money  supply  and  domestic \ncredit.  However,  a  fixed-exchange  rate  regime  is  more  vulnerable  when  there  is  a  net \ncapital  outflow.  Unless  it  has  adequate  foreign  exchange  reserves,  the  monetary \nauthority would have to raise interest rates to protect the peg. The likely outcome would \nbe an economic recession. \n\nMany factors could also undermine the efficacy of the capital inflows. The host economy \nmay experience a mere substitution of domestic savings by foreign savings, which would \nonly  facilitate  a  consumption  boom.  In  order  to  avoid  this  situation,  a  relatively  high \nsaving  rate  must  be  attained  in  order  to  generate  a  trade  surplus  that  will  be  used  to \nservice the foreign debt incurred. But even if this saving rate is attained, an insufficient \namount  of  investment  may  be  channeled  to  the  tradable  goods  sector  (most  likely \nbecause  of  the  appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate),  which  would  reduce  the \nconvertibility of the surplus to foreign currency needed to service the foreign debt. Some \nanalysts  have  argued  that  even  if  capital  inflows  are  channeled  completely  to \ninvestment,  the  resulting  improvement  in  the  growth  rate  is  only  short-term  in  nature \nunless  it  is  accompanied  by  a  significant  improvement  in  the  economy\u2019s  technology \n(Reisen, 1998). \n\nSince  capital  account  inflows  inherently  entail  financial  transactions,  they  are  also \nsusceptible  to  market  imperfections  associated  with  asymmetric  information  and  moral \nhazard. These microeconomic distortions normally result in an inappropriate assessment \nof  risk  exposure  and  cause  over-borrowing,  making  the  financial  system  vulnerable  to \n\n  6\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nexogenous  shocks.  The  problem  becomes  particularly  acute  when  banks  are  the  main \nintermediaries  of  capital  flows.  The  situation  is  even  more  precarious  in  emerging \nmarkets where the risk-management practices of the private sector are underdeveloped, \nthe capacity of regulators to supervise the financial sector are limited, and the financial \nmarkets are thin. \n\nAnother  potential  microeconomic  distortion  arises  from  the  real  sector  where  aspects \nsuch as imperfect competition, externalities or wage rigidity, may result in inappropriate \nprivate sector adjustment even if the financial sector is functioning well (Fernandez-Arias \nand Montiel, 1996). Such static distortions may lead to the choice of a wrong technology \nand access to foreign capital will magnify the problem (Calvo et al., 1994). Meanwhile, in \nthe  event  of  a  sudden  capital  outflow,  these  distortions  would  induce  exchange  rate \novershooting, making the economic adjustment more difficult. \n\nSome Empirical Evidence \n\nDespite the theoretical and intuitive arguments in favor of greater capital mobility, some \nstudies have questioned the benefits of capital flows on empirical grounds. In one study, \nan indicator of capital account liberalization was included as an explanatory variable for \neconomic growth (Rodrik, 1998). The conclusion reached was that the data provided no \nevidence  that  countries  without  capital  controls  have  grown  faster,  invested  more,  or \nexperienced lower inflation. \n\nA more recent study used capital flows directly as an explanatory  variable (Levine and \nCarkovic,  1999).  The  authors  applied  more  sophisticated  econometric  techniques  to \naccount for simultaneity, country-specific effects and the inclusion of lagged dependent \nvariables as regressors. The study found that the exogenous components of FDI flows \nand portfolio flows did not exert a positive influence on economic growth. The conclusion \nis consistent with microeconomic studies that generally suggest that FDI does not boost \neconomic  growth  primarily  because  of  the  absence  of  evidence  of  positive  spillovers \nrunning from foreign-owned to domestic-owned firms.  \n\nThe study of Levine and Carkovic also looked at the effect of capital flows on productivity \ngrowth,  which  is  an  important  determinant  of  the  variation  in  long-term  growth  across \neconomies. This data, too, did not show evidence of a link. However, a separate study \nby  Levine  (1999)  presented  evidence  that  the  entry  of  foreign  banks\u2014a  form  of  direct \ninvestment\u2014enhanced  the  efficiency  of  the  domestic  financial  system.  Meanwhile, \ninternational portfolio equity flows were shown to have enhanced domestic stock market \nliquidity.  Other  studies  have  confirmed  the  positive  effects  of  both  financial  system \nefficiency  and  stock  market  liquidity  on  productivity  and  economic  growth.  Hence,  the \nstudy of Levine provided evidence of a transmission mechanism between foreign capital \nflows, on the one hand, and economic growth, on the other. \n\nThe study of Rodrik was criticized by Eichengreen (1998) as being biased. Variables that \nare negatively associated with growth but positively associated with the decision to open \nthe  capital  account  were  inadvertently  omitted.  The  study  of  Levine  and  Carkovic  and \nthe study of Levine indicate that the evidence on the impact of capital flows is generally \nmixed. Finally, it is widely accepted by economic analysts that the spectacular growth of \nseveral East Asian economies (e.g. Singapore and People\u2019s Republic of China) was due \nin no small measure to FDI. \n\n  7\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nAn  analysis  of  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  capital  flows  can  determine  whether  the \naforementioned drawbacks have materialized. In one study, key economic variables for \nselected  Asian  and  Latin  American  economies  were  monitored  using  data  from  1988\u2013\n1994  (Calvo,  Leiderman  and  Reinhart,  1996).  Some  stylized  facts  were  documented \nfrom  these  observations.  First,  a  substantial  portion  of  the  surge  in  capital  inflows  was \nchanneled to accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. Second, in most countries the \ncapital inflows were associated with widening current account deficits. Third, there was a \nrise  in  consumption  spending,  which  was  usually  driven  by  rising  imports  of  durable \ngoods.  Fourth,  in  almost  all  countries  examined,  there  was  rapid  growth  in  the  money \nsupply  both  in  nominal  and  real  terms.  Fifth,  the  surge  in  portfolio  flows  was \naccompanied by sharp increases in stock and real estate prices. Lastly, the evidence on \nthe  real  exchange  rate  presents  a  mixed  picture.  The  data  indicate  that  real  exchange \nrate appreciation was more prevalent in Latin America than in Asia. \n\nThe  stylized  facts  suggest  that  the  disadvantages  associated  with  capital  flows  (e.g. \nincreased consumption and real exchange rate appreciation) are likely outcomes. Given \nthe  potential  benefits  of  capital  flows,  it  is  thus  imperative  for  policymakers  to  adopt \nmeasures  that  minimize  their  costs.  Strategies  for  capital  flow  management  can  be \ndeveloped at the domestic, regional and international levels. Policy options that exist in \nthe  domestic  front  can  further  be  classified  into  macroeconomic  and  microeconomic \nresponses. \n\nIII. \n\nCAPITAL INFLOWS INTO THE PHILIPPINES: 1987\u20132007 \n\nTrends and Composition \n\nNet capital flows to the Philippines have been fairly steady from 1989\u20131997, except for a \nblip in 1996 when net capital flows jumped to $14.7 billion (Table 2). FDI was a constant \ncontributor although the level was much lower compared with neighboring countries with \na similar level of development, i.e. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia (Table 3). Portfolio \ninvestment  surged  in  1995  and  1996  following  the  global  trend  during  this  period. \nMeanwhile,  transactions  classified  as  \u201cother  investments\u201d  were  the  largest  source  of \nflows during this period, and this category largely explains the jump in capital inflows in \n1996. Data indicate that this was attributable mainly to the increase in net foreign assets \nof commercial banks. \n\nBetween  1998  and  2007,  which  is  the  period  after  the  East  Asian  financial  crisis,  net \ncapital flows to the Philippines fell sharply (Table 4). The only exceptions were in 1999 \nwhen  there  was  a  fairly  large  amount  of  foreign  investment  in  debt  securities,  and  in \n2005 when there was a surge in portfolio investment. In 1999, there was an increase in \nborrowers availing themselves of medium and long-term loans largely in response to the \nadverse effects of the crisis. The category \u201cother investments\u201d also increased sharply in \n2005 although this was followed by a turnaround in 2006. \n\nDespite  the  slowdown  in  capital  inflows  after  the  crisis,  foreign  exchange  inflows \nremained strong. This was largely due to remittances of Filipinos working abroad, which \nare the main component of current transfers. Net current transfers in 2006 amounted to \n$13.2  billion  which  was  11.3%  of  GDP  (Table  4).  Given  the  dominance  of  current \ntransfers, the analysis in this study should not be limited to capital flows but extended to \ncover  inflows  of  foreign  exchange.  Historical  comparison  should  be  approached  with \ncaution,  however,  since  adjustments  to  Philippine  BOP  data  have  been  applied  only \n\n  8\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nfrom  1999  to  the  present.  While  capital  account  data  are  still  loosely  comparable,  the \nsame is not true for data on current transfers. \n\nAs  a  percentage  of  GDP,  there  was  a  jump  in  current  transfers  in  2001.  This  level \nincreased  steadily  until  2006.  This  implies  that  while  remittances  are  relatively  high,  it \nwould be difficult to attribute the sharp rise in the peso\u2019s value in 2006\u20132007 to a \u201csurge\u201d \nin remittances. This issue will be discussed in more detail in Section IV. \n\nCapital  inflows  to  the  Philippines  are  largely  due  to  \u201cpush\u201d  factors.  The  ebb  and  flow \ngenerally follow global patterns, particularly in the case of portfolio flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors \nwere dominant, FDI would have been much higher. Table 1 indicates a sharp rise in FDI \nflows  to  developing  countries  from  2004  to  2006.  However,  the  direct  investments  of \nnon-residents  in  the  Philippines  amounted  to  $2,086  million  in  2006,  which  ranks  only \nsixth  among ASEAN member countries in absolute terms and eighth  as a ratio GDP, \nand is even lower than the peak of $2,287 million in 1998 (Table 3 and Table 4). \n\nMeanwhile, remittances respond to both pull and push factors. Studies have shown that \nremittances are largely pro-cyclical and driven by investment motives (Tua\u00f1o-Amador et \nal., 2007). Hence, a more conducive business environment will attract more remittances. \nThe  peso  appreciation  could  also  be  considered  a  pull  factor,  wherein  larger  dollar \nremittances are required to sustain a specific standard of living. On the other hand, the \nmain  push  factor  would  be  more  employment  opportunities  and  higher  remuneration \nabroad. In this context, it should be noted that there has been an increase in demand for \noverseas workers particularly for nurses and caregivers. \n\nImpact on the Macroeconomy: Econometric Results \n\nAs discussed in Section II, large inflows of capital can lead to accumulation of reserves, \nreal  appreciation  of  the  local  currency,  expansion  in  domestic  liquidity,  increase  in  the \nprice  level,  and  reduction  in  the  domestic  interest  rate,  which,  in  turn,  affect \nconsumption, investment and government spending. On the other hand, some of these \nvariables  constitute  the  host  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  that  determine  capital  flows\u2014such  as \nimproved macroeconomic performance and exchange rate regime\u2014that attract investor \nconfidence  and  encourage  capital  inflows.  Hence,  the  apparent  endogeneity  of  capital \ninflows and other macroeconomic variables, i.e. the tendency to appear in both the left \nand  right  side  of  the  equation,  warrants  the  use  of  a  non-structural  multi-equation \napproach  to  analyze  the  impact  of  inflows  of  capital  on  the  macroeconomy.  Possible \nmethodologies toward this end include estimation through a vector autoregression (VAR) \nmodel in case of absence of cointegration relationship among the chosen variables or a \nvector  error  correction  model  (VECM)  in  case  such  relationship  exists  among  the \nvariables.  \n\nBefore proceeding with the choice of estimation methodology, the time series properties \nof  the  variables  were  first  checked  since  estimations  of  the  nonstationary  series  are \nknown to be spurious. Given the expected impact of capital inflows in the economy, as \ndiscussed  above,  we  include,  apart  from  the  measure  of  capital  inflows\u2014using  net \ncapital  and  financial  account  of  the  Balance  of  Payments\u2014reserves,  91-day  Treasury \n(T-bill)  rate,  real  effective  exchange  rate  (REER),  M3,  consumption,  investment  and \ngovernment expenditures in the set of variables. The results of the augmented Dickey-\nFuller tests (ADF) indicate that all the variables are stationary in levels except for M3 and \nconsumption which are integrated of order two. \n\n  9\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThe  nonstationarity  of  M3  and  consumption  implies  that  it  is  legitimate  to  search  for  a \ncointegration  relationship  among  the  variables.  In  performing  cointegration  tests  using \nthe  approach  of  Johansen  (1991),  we  consider  the  foregoing  set  of  macroeconomic \nvariables.  Results  of  the  Johansen  cointegration  tests  provide  evidence  that  a  unique \ncointegrating vector exists among the abovementioned set of variables. The existence of \ncointegration  relationship  among  the  four  groupings  of  variables  warrants  the  use  of  a \nVECM, in lieu of an unrestricted VAR.2  \n\nThe  impulse  response  functions  (IRF)  derived  from  the  various  versions  of  the  VECM \ncould provide indications of the impact of capital flows on the macroeconomic variables \nincluded in the groupings. However, IRF results using Cholesky decomposition could be \nsensitive  to  the  ordering  of  the  variables  in  VECM.  Since  our  analysis  focuses  on  the \nimpact of capital flows on the macroeconomy, the measure of capital flows is placed first \nin the ordering. The surge of capital flows could lead to accumulation of reserves so the \nreserves are placed second in the ordering. Meanwhile, the central bank is expected to \nrespond  to  capital  inflow  shocks  using  its  policy  instruments  such  as  the  policy  rate \nwhich could, in turn, influence market rates (Berument and Dincer, 2004). Hence, the 91-\nday  T-bill  rate  enters  the  VECM  as  the  third  variable.  Moreover,  exchange  rates  could \nrespond to the increase in the market rates via the interest parity condition.  \n\nIn  addition,  exchange  rates  could  react  to  capital  inflows  because  the  latter  could \nincrease reserves, as argued above, and the money supply as well. Therefore, the real \nexchange rate and M3 follow the 91-day T-bill rate. Meanwhile, the resulting expansion \nin money supply could lead to an increase in the price level, hence, the consumer price \nindex (CPI) is placed next. Finally, other variables in the real and fiscal sectors react to \nchanges in the market rate and the real exchange rate so that consumption, investment \nand  government  expenditures  are  placed  at  the  end  of  the  ordering.  Although  frowned \nupon  by  practitioners,  a  dummy  variable  was  added  to  temper  the  impact  of  the  1997 \nfinancial crisis. \n\nIRF  results  from  the  VECM  indicate  that  capital  inflows,  in  aggregate, could  lead  to  an \nincrease  in  reserves,  with  the  impact  reaching  its  highest  magnitude  in  the  second \nquarter after the capital inflow shock (Figure 3). However, the impact of a positive capital \nflow  on  the  91-day  T-bill  rate  appears  insignificant.  Meanwhile,  capital  inflows  tend  to \nlead  to  a  real  appreciation  of  the  peso  against  the  basket  of  major  trading  partners\u2019 \n(MTP) currencies. Nevertheless, the positive impact of the capital inflow shock seems to \ndissipate in the second quarter after the shock so that the real exchange rate reverts to \nits  pre-shock  value  in  the  seventh  quarter  but  appears  to  appreciate  again  thereafter. \nThe broadly positive results from the impulse response functions relating to M3 and CPI \nindicate  the  capital  inflows  could  lead  to  an  expansion  in  domestic  liquidity  and  an \nincrease in inflation. Meanwhile, the impact of capital flows on consumption, investment \nand government expenditure appear insignificant.  \n\nThe  estimated  VECM  was  likewise  utilized  to  generate  IRFs  resulting  from  a  positive \nshock  to  reserves.  An  interesting  result  is  that  the  reserves  shock  leads  to  a  real \nappreciation  of  the  peso  against  the  basket  of  MTP  currencies,  which  appears  to  be \n\n                                                 \n2 The empirical results are available upon request. The four groupings refer to the types of capital flows used \nin the estimation. One is a combination of FDI and portfolio investment. The second and third are FDI and \nportfolio investment, respectively. And the fourth is remittances. \n\n 10\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\ncounterintuitive  given  the  precautionary  nature  of  reserves  in  the  Philippine  economy \n(Figure 4). Reference to this result will be made in Section VI. \n\nDifferent versions of the VECM were likewise estimated with the aggregate capital flows \nvariable replaced by its direct investments and portfolio investments components and by \ncurrent  transfers  as  well.  IRFs  derived  from  a  positive  shock  in  direct  and  portfolio \ninvestments  are  either  insignificant  or  counterintuitive. 3  This  is  due  perhaps  to  the \nvolatility of direct and portfolio investments over the 1989 Q1 to 2007 Q2 sample period \nwith coefficient of variation of 177.9 and 307.0, respectively. Meanwhile, results from the \nVECM using the current transfers  variable, which has a  coefficient of  variation of 94.3, \nindicate that a positive shock to current transfers leads to a rise in the level of reserves, \nthe  91-day  T-bill  rate,  CPI  and  government  expenditure  (Figure  5).  Generally \ninsignificant  results  were  derived  from  IRFs  relating  to  the  real  exchange  rate,  M3, \nconsumption and investment.4 Overall, capital flows and current transfers seem to have \nminimal  impact  on  the  real  sector.  This  is  likely  because  the  monetary  authority  may \nhave sterilized the impact or exchange rate movements may have diluted any potential \nreal effects. \n\n                                                 \n3 Tables and results are omitted here but are available upon request. \n4 The results are likely to change, particularly for consumption and REER, if a consistent series for current \n\ntransfers is obtained. \n\n 11\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T.

These  include  (i)  imbalances  that  threaten \nmacroeconomic  stability  become  likely  if  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  economy  falls \nbelow the level of the foreign exchange inflows; (ii) a rapid appreciation of the nominal \nand real exchange rates if the economy has a flexible exchange regime; a substitution of \ndomestic  savings  by  foreign  savings,  which  would  only  facilitate  a  consumption  boom; \n(iii) microeconomic distortions such as asymmetric information that normally result in an \ninappropriate  assessment  of  risk  exposure  and  cause  over-borrowing;  and  (iv) \ndistortions  from  the  real  sector  where  aspects  such  as  imperfect  competition, \nexternalities or wage rigidity, may result in inappropriate private sector adjustment such \nas wrong choice of technology even if the financial sector is functioning well. Meanwhile, \nin  the  event  of  a  sudden  capital  outflow,  these  distortions  would  induce  exchange  rate \novershooting, making the economic adjustment more difficult. \n\n 14\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThis section looks at the experience of the Philippines from 1987\u20132007 and determines \nwhether  the  possible  adverse  outcomes  of  surges  of  foreign  exchange  inflows  were \nrealized.  The  analysis  refers  to  the  econometric  results  in  the  previous  section  when \nrelevant. Basic macroeconomic indicators of the Philippines are shown in Table 5. This \ninvestigation  will  help  in  the  analysis  of  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  inflows  on  the \neconomy and also in the evaluation of selected policy responses. \n\nReal Sector \n\nKnowledge  of  the  range  of  impacts  of  current  transfers  and  capital  flows  on  the  real \nsector will aid policymakers in crafting measures that will optimize their use. The results \nof the VAR analysis indicate that foreign exchange flows have limited impact on the real \nsector.  The  negligible  impact  on  investment  is  not  unexpected.  The  level  of  FDI \ninvestment in the Philippines has been historically low, reaching a maximum of 3.4% in \n1998, which can even be considered an abnormal year. Moreover, the literature review \npointed out that the beneficial impact of FDI is dependent on a significant improvement \nin the economy\u2019s technology (Reisen, 1998) and some microeconomic studies generally \nsuggest that FDI does not boost economic growth primarily because of the absence of \nevidence  of  positive  spillovers  running  from  foreign-owned  to  domestic-owned  firms \n(Levine  and  Carkovic,  1999).  A  later  study  indicated  that  in  several  Southeast  Asian \neconomies including the Philippines, FDI had only direct effects while spillover effects in \nterms of technology transfer were minimal (Mirza and Giroud, 2004). \n\nHowever,  the  negligible  impact  of  current  transfers  on  investment  and  consumption  is \nnot  consistent  with  earlier  studies.  Using  a  seemingly  unrelated  regression  technique, \nLamberte  (1995)  finds  remittances  to  be  a  significant  determinant  of  personal \nconsumption  but  not  of  investment.  A  modified  form  of  his  regressions  was  estimated \nusing  data  from  1999\u20132006  (Table  6).  The  results  show  that  remittances  significantly \naffect both investment and personal consumption, but both FDI and portfolio investment \nare  insignificant.  The  reason  for  the  difference  with  Lamberte\u2019s  study  in  terms  of  the \nimpact  on  investment  may  be  the  size  of  the  remittances  and  the  behavior  of \nhouseholds.  The  latter  may  have  become  sophisticated  over  time  in  managing \nremittances, thereby using them more productively. \n\nA  study  based  on  the  2003  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (FIES)  finds \nevidence  that  households  receiving  remittances  tend  to  spend  more  conspicuously  in \nterms of consumer items but also invest more on education, housing, medical care and \ndurable  goods  (Tabuga,  2007).  The  study  shows  no  clear  relationship  between \nremittances  and  tobacco  and  alcohol.  Unfortunately,  FIES  data  do  not  include  capital \noutlays, hence the impact on investment was not considered. \n\nMeanwhile,  a  study  by  Yang  (2005)  also  used  FIES  data  but  focuses  on  the  impact  of \nexchange  rate  shocks  on  migrant  income  on  a  range  of  investment  outcomes  in \nPhilippine  households  such  as  child  schooling,  child  labor,  and  entrepreneurial  activity. \nHowever,  the  latter  does  not  cover  capital  outlays.  The  study  finds  that  favorable \nexchange  rate  movements\u2014from  the  perspective  of  the  overseas  worker\u2014lead  to \ngreater  child  schooling,  reduced  child  labor,  and  increased  educational  expenditure  in \nPhilippine households. Favorable exchange rate shocks also lead to differentially  more \nhours worked in self-employment, and to differential entry into relatively capital-intensive \nenterprises by households receiving remittances. \n\n 15\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThe empirical results in Table 6 are consistent with the BSP study (Tua\u00f1o-Amador et al., \n2007) that shows remittances to be pro-cyclical and dominated by investment  motives. \nThe analysis indicates that remittances have the potential to be a more robust source of \nsustainable  economic  growth  if  they  are  channeled  to  productive  investments.  More \nmicro-level  studies  should  be  conducted  to  determine  the  factors  that  can  bring  this \nabout.  What  would  be  suspect,  though,  is  the  negligible  impact  of  remittances  on \nconsumption based on the VAR analysis. This can be considered inconclusive until such \ntime that a consistent data series on current transfers will be extended to years prior to \n1999. \n\nWhat is driving the exchange rate? \n\nThe most controversial aspect of foreign exchange inflows, arguably, has been the sharp \nappreciation  of  many  Asian  currencies  in  nominal  and  real  terms  from  2004  up  to  the \npresent (Table 7 and Figure 1).5 The peso started appreciating sharply vis-\u00e0-vis the US \ndollar  only  in  December  2005  and  even  then  it  was  the  Asian  currency  with  the  most \nrapid appreciation during the period 2003\u201307 (Table 7). As a matter of fact, the peso had \nthe fastest nominal appreciation in 2007. Based on the literature review and econometric \nevidence,  the  knee-jerk  reaction  would  attribute  this  phenomenon  to  a  surge  in  foreign \nexchange inflows. \n\nCloser scrutiny of the data indicates, however, that foreign exchange inflows may have a \nless prominent role in the appreciation of Asian currencies than assumed. Data in Table \n8 show the ratio of balance-of-payments components to GDP during the period 2004\u201306 \nfor various Asian countries. There is no indication of a surge in current transfers among \nthem except for the Philippines. However, Singapore and Malaysia do have substantial \ncurrent  account  surpluses  but  the  Singapore  dollar  and  ringgit  have  significantly  lower \nrates of appreciation. \n\nMeanwhile, the balance in the capital and financial accounts were fairly moderate except \nfor  relatively  large  surpluses  in  the  Philippines  and  Thailand  in  2005.  Moreover,  as \nindicated  in  the  earlier  section,  there  has  been  no  jump  in  remittances  into  the \nPhilippines compared to its historical trend and even then the resulting current account \nsurplus was much lower than that of Malaysia and Singapore. Hence, while important, it \nwould  be  incorrect  to  cite  a  surge  in  foreign  exchange  inflows  as  the  primary  cause  of \nthe peso\u2019s recent sharp appreciation.  \n\nInstead, the following factors can be considered in the context of the Philippines: \n\n1.  At  the  \u201clowest\u201d  points  of  the  various  regional  currencies,  the  peso  experienced \nthe  second  largest  depreciation  in  both  nominal  and  real  terms.  Hence  it  is  but \nnatural to expect it to have a faster appreciation during the recovery period after \nthe crisis. This argument, however, is tempered by the experience of Indonesia, \nwhich  had  the  sharpest  depreciation  as  a  result  of  the  crisis,  yet  experienced  a \nnet nominal depreciation of the rupiah during the period 2003\u201307. \n\n                                                 \n5 An  empirical  study  on  the  effects  of  the  peso  appreciation  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  Tua\u00f1o-\nAmador, et al. (2007) allude to evidence of Dutch Disease in the Philippines, which is also manifest in the \ndeceleration  of  the  manufacturing  sector  simultaneously  with  the  rapid  growth  of  GDP.  Manufacturing \nsector growth fell to 3.3% in 2007 from 4.6% a year before whereas GDP growth surged to 7.3% in 2007 \ncompared  to  5.4%  in  2006.  However,  a  more  important  undertaking  would  be  to  determine  whether  the \npeso is overvalued at the current exchange rate. \n\n 16\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\n2.  Instead  of  a  drawn  out  process,  the  peso\u2019s  recovery  was  bunched  up  over  the \nperiod December 2005 to the present. This is largely explained by the prevailing \nfiscal  difficulties  up  to  that  time.  The  Philippine  government  implemented \nstringent and decisive fiscal reforms beginning in 2005 and their success boosted \ninvestor  confidence  which  was  reflected  in  the  peso\u2019s  strong  appreciation  in \n2006\u201307. \n\n3.  Compared  to  other  central  banks  in  the  region,  the  BSP  did  not  intervene  as \nmuch  in  terms  of  accumulating  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Hence  it  should  be \nexpected that the peso\u2019s appreciation should be faster. This can be gleaned from \nFigure 2 which is Graph 2 of Ho and McCauley (2007). The ratio of the change in \nforeign  exchange  reserves  to  GDP  was  extended  to  October  2007  (Figure  2A) \nand  while  the  Philippines  moved  up  in  rankings,  the  extent  of  intervention  was \nstill comparable to the past five years. However, this argument is also tempered \nby Indonesia\u2019s experience where the degree of intervention was even lower. \n\n4.  A prevailing current account surplus since 2003 has also pushed up the peso\u2019s \nvalue.  From  a  current  account  deficit  equal  to  5.3%  of  GDP  in  1998,  the \nPhilippine  economy  recorded  a  surplus  of  4.5%  of  GDP  in  2006  and  4.4%  in \n2007 (Table 5). This is largely due to a fall in the investment rate and reflected in \na  drop  in  the  ratio  of  imports  to  GDP  from  63%  in  1997  to  only  45.3%  in  2007 \n(Table  5).  The  issue  of  the  fall  in  the  investment  rate  and  its  relation  to  the \naccumulation of reserves will be discussed in Section VI. \n\nRather than surges in foreign exchange inflows, the strength of Asian currencies vis-\u00e0-\nvis the US dollar is largely attributable to the latter\u2019s overall weakness. Data in Table 7 \nshow that the US dollar depreciated by 38% against the euro during the period 2003\u201307. \nThis  is  about  10  percentage  points  higher  than  the  peso\u2019s  appreciation  against  the \ndollar.  However,  the  concept  of  \u201cdollar  weakness\u201d  has  to  be  translated  into  foreign \nexchange flows that affect the region\u2019s exchange rates. One possible explanation relates \nto the concepts of \u201cdollarization\u201d and \u201cde-dollarization.\u201d \n\nDollarization and De-Dollarization \n\nDollar  denominated  assets  held  by  residents  has  been  increasing  over  time  consistent \nwith  the  liberalization  of  the  economy.  The  relative  magnitude  of  these  assets  reflects \nthe degree of dollarization, which increased between 1990 and 2000 following the surge \nof  foreign  exchange  inflows  (Table  9).  Using  the  IMF  standard,  an  economy  is \nconsidered  highly  dollarized  if  the  ratio  of  foreign  currency  deposits  (FCDs)  to  money \nsupply  is  greater  than  30%.  The  data  show  that  the  Philippines  was  on  its  way  to \nbecoming a highly dollarized economy, but, after reaching 41% in 2000, the ratio fell to \n29.9% in 2006 and 26.4% in October 2007. \n\nThe  trend  towards  de-dollarization  can  be  partly  explained  by  the  general  decline  in \ncapital inflows after the crisis. However, at a certain point the fall in the FCD/M3 ratio is \ndriven largely by the peso appreciation. In this context, making FCD/M3 an indicator of \nde-dollarization  becomes  an  exercise  in  tautology.  Data  show  that  in  2006  and  2007 \nthere was a jump in withdrawals in FCDs (Table 9), which is a more reliable indicator of \nde-dollarization. The jump can be attributed to expectations of a peso appreciation which \nbecome self-fulfilling. Another indication of de-dollarization is the ratio of FCDs to foreign \nexchange reserves, which has fallen sharply between 2004 and 2007. The logic is that \n\n 17\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nperceptions  of  weakness  in  the  US  dollar  has  prompted  economic  agents  to  withdraw \nfrom  their  FCDs  and  convert  their  dollar  holdings  to  pesos  in  anticipation  of  its \nappreciation. This action in itself has contributed to the peso\u2019s appreciation. \n\nStock Prices \n\nForeign portfolio investment has been the main driver of the local stock market. Hence, it \nis not surprising that the surge in stock prices since 2003 has been accompanied by the \nresurgence of non-residents\u2019 investment in equity securities (Table 4 and Figure 6). The \nresults of the VECM analysis and regressions in Table 6 indicate, however, that portfolio \nflows have had an insignificant impact on investment and consumption. \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY RESPONSES \n\nThe role of policymakers is to implement measures that will mitigate the adverse impact \nof  foreign  exchange  inflows.  This  section  provides  an  inventory  of  such  measures  with \nemphasis on the role of the BSP. \n\n1987\u20131997 \n\nThe surge in the capital account that lasted between 1993 and 1997 led to a persistent \nappreciation of the peso, in nominal terms between October 1993 and November 1994, \nand  in  real  terms  between  April  1995  and  June  1997  (see  Figure  1  and  Figure  6). \nInflation, interest rates and money supply growth were generally higher prior to the crisis \n(Table  5).  In  response,  the  government  implemented  measures  that  can  be  classified \ninto  four  categories:  reducing  the  supply  of  foreign  exchange  inflows;  increasing  the \ndemand  for  foreign  exchange;  strengthening  prudential  regulations;  and  reducing  the \ncost of production for exporters. \n\nTo reduce the supply of foreign exchange in the country, the government cut back on its \nrequests for loan rescheduling under the Paris debt program. Between 1994 and 1997, \nthe  government  pre-paid  a  total  of  $1.41  billion  of  external  debt.  Meanwhile,  the  BSP \nlifted  the  restriction  on  the  repatriation  of  foreign  investments  made  under  the  debt-to-\nequity  conversion  program,  as  well  as  on  the  remittance  of  dividends,  profits  and \nearnings that are derived from such investments. It also increased the allowable outward \ninvestments that can be sourced from the banking system from $1 million to $6 million \nper investor per year. \n\nTo  increase  the  demand  for  foreign  exchange,  the  BSP  intervened  in  the  foreign \nexchange  market  by  buying  dollars.  In  some  cases  the  BSP  engaged  in  sterilized \nintervention  by  buying  dollars  in  the  market  while  concurrently  engaged  in  mopping  up \noperations by selling government securities in its portfolio to prevent the money supply \nfrom  increasing.  For  its  part,  the  national  government  advanced  the  phasedown  of  the \nforward exchange cover extended to oil firms to add to demand for foreign exchange. \n\nThe  BSP  instituted  several  measures  to  reduce  the  costs  of  production  to  exporters  to \nmaintain  their  competitiveness.  Direct  and  indirect  exporters  were  allowed  access  to \nforeign  currency  loans  offered  by  foreign  currency  deposit  units  (FCDUs).  This  led  to \nlarge  savings  in  interest  payments  on  the  part  of  exporters  since  interest  rate \ndifferentials between FCDU loans and peso denominated loans from commercial banks \nat that time ranged from 5.5\u20137 percentage points. \n\n 18\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nMonetary Board Resolution No. 1197 dated December 1, 1994 established an Exporters \nDollar Facility (EDF), and the BSP subsequently issued Circular No. 57 dated December \n19,  1994.  Under  Circular  No.  57,  qualified  banks  could  avail  themselves  of  the  EDF \nagainst the eligible dollar-denominated loans of their exporter-borrowers (both direct and \nindirect),  including  service  exporters  who  were  engaged  in  rendering  technical, \nprofessional,  and  other  services.  On  April  27,  1999,  the  BSP  issued  Circular  No.  199 \nwhereby the EDF was renamed Exporters Dollar and Yen Rediscount Facility (EDYRF). \nQualified  banks  could  avail  themselves  of  the  EDYRF  against  the  eligible  dollar-\ndenominated or yen-denominated loans of their exporter-borrowers. \n\nThe  BSP  also  added  more  loanable  funds  to  the  system  by  gradually  reducing  the \nreserve requirement on all deposit liabilities from 24% in January 1993 to 17% in August \n1994. This contributed to the decline in domestic interest rates. \n\nTo  prevent  banks  from  unduly  speculating  in  the  foreign  exchange  markets,  the  BSP \nreduced  the  oversold  position  of  banks  from  15%  of  its  unimpaired  capital  to  5%.  To \nweed  out  the  speculative  component  of  portfolio  investment,  the  BSP  imposed  a  prior \napproval requirement on all forward transactions with nonresidents. \n\n1998\u20132007 \n\nAfter the crisis, the BSP embarked on an \u201caggressive and wide-ranging reform process\u201d \nof the domestic financial system (Tetangco, 2005). One of the objectives was to increase \nthe  resilience  of  the  domestic  financial  to  volatility  of  capital  flows  and  enable  it  to \nallocate capital flows more efficiently. The BSP \u201cadopted changes in the regulatory and \nsupervisory  framework  to  be  able  to  effectively  meet  the  demands  and  challenges  of \nglobally integrated financial markets and the growing sophistication of financial products \nand  services.  This  process  of  reform  is  geared  towards  greater  commitment  to  risk \nmanagement,  strengthening  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  supervision  techniques, \npromotion  of  transparency  and  good  corporate  governance,  and  putting  in  place  the \nnecessary  infrastructure  requirements.  The  BSP,  working  closely  with  the  banking \nsector, has made important progress on these fronts.\u201d6 \n\nMeasures to improve monitoring and transparency of capital flows were also introduced. \nThe Philippines started subscribing to the IMF\u2019s Special Data Dissemination Standards \n(SDDS) in 1996. By January 2001, the Philippines was in full compliance with the SDDS \nin  the  dissemination  of  the  relevant  data  through  the  internet  in  accordance  with \nprescribed timeliness and frequency. \n\nTo  facilitate  the  adoption  of  international  norms,  the  Philippines  has  also  been \nparticipating  in  the  formulation  of  Reports  on  the  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes \n(ROSCs). These reports assess the extent to which the Philippines conforms to various \nkey international standards and codes that are relevant to the effective functioning of its \neconomic and financial system. Resulting gains in transparency are expected to enable \nmarket  participants  to  formulate  better  analysis,  forecasts  and  investment  decisions, \nthus  reducing  uncertainty  and  helping  investors  price  risk  on  a  sounder  basis.  To \ncomplement  the  activities  under  ROSCs,  the  Philippines  has  also  been  participating  in \nthe  IMF-World  Bank  Financial  Sector  Assessment  Program  (FSAP),  which  is  aimed  at \n\n                                                 \n6 Quoted from Tetangco (2005), pages 253-254. The details of the reforms are contained in the same paper. \n\n 19\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the strengths, risks and vulnerabilities of the \nfinancial system. \n\nApart  from  its  effort  at  reforming  the  domestic  financial  system,  the  BSP  also  followed \nmeasures  similar  to  those  in  1987\u20131997,  particularly  reducing  the  supply  of  foreign \nexchange  inflows  and  increasing  the  demand  for  foreign  exchange.  The  BSP's  main \napproach  has  been  to  liberalize  private  sector  capital  outflows  in  order  to  reduce  the \ninflows and reserve accumulation. This involved the following:7  \n\n1.  Encouraging \nremittances. \n\ninvestments  by  overseas  Filipinos, \n\ninitially  by \n\nfacilitating \n\n\u2022  Promoting transparency and competition in remittances through Circular no. 534 \n\n\u2022 \n\n(remittance charges disclosure).  \nImproving  payment  and  settlement  systems  by  approving  setting  up  of  local \nbank\u2019s  remittance  centers  and  branches  abroad,  authorizing  rural  banks  to \naccept  FCDs,  approving  interconnection  of  three  (3)  ATM  networks,  and \napproving  use  of  new  technologies  as  mode  of  remittance  (e.g.  internet  and \nSMS).  \n\n\u2022  Promoting financial literacy campaigns among OFs/families.  \n\n2.  Encouraging  private  sector  capital  outflows  through  further  liberalization  of \n\nforeign exchange transactions:  \n\n\u2022  Phase  1:  BSP  Circular  561  which  involves  a  symmetrical  limit  of  20%  of \nunimpaired  capital  (Oversold/Overbought  positions)  and  increased  limit  of \noutward investment by Philippine residents to $12 million/year; and BSP Circular \n565 allowing thrift banks to invest in FCD debt instruments. \n\n\u2022  Phase 2: Policy reforms contemplated under this area cover the expanded use of \nforeign  exchange  swaps;  transactions  in  which  FCDUs  of  thrift  banks/rural \nbanks/cooperatives  may  engage;  increase  in  the  allowed  foreign  exchange \npurchases by residents  from banks  for  non-trade current account purposes and \nreporting \ninvestments;  and  streamlining  of  documentation  and \noutward \nrequirements  to  further  facilitate  the  purchase  of  foreign  exchange  from  the \nbanking system for legitimate trade and non-trade transactions. \n\n3.  On  other  capital  account  transactions,  the  allowable  outward  investments  by \nresidents without prior BSP approval and registration was increased from US$6 \nmillion per investor per year to US$12 million. For purposes of purchasing foreign \nexchange \ninclude  residents\u2019 \ninvestments  in  foreign  currency-denominated  bonds  issued  by  the  National \nGovernment and other Philippine entities. The increase in the allowable limit on \noutward investments is expected to allow greater portfolio and risk diversification \nand facilitate integration with global markets. \n\ninvestments  will  now \n\nfrom  banks,  outward \n\n4.  On  current  account  transactions,  the  limit  on  allowable  foreign  exchange \npurchases by residents from banks to cover payments to foreign beneficiaries for \nnon-trade  purposes  (excluding  those  related  to  foreign  loans/foreign  currency \nloans  and  foreign  investments)  without  supporting  documents  was  increased \n\n                                                 \n7 Information was sourced from the BSP. \n\n 20\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nfrom  US$5,000  to  US$10,000.  Furthermore,  the  \u201cno-splitting\u201d  restriction  and \nnotarization requirement for applications to purchase foreign exchange were also \nlifted. These measures are expected to facilitate the rising demand by residents \nfor  foreign  exchange  to  service  non-trade  transactions  (such  as  education  of \ndependents abroad, medical care and payment of service fees) which have risen \nas  a  result  of  globalization.  Lower  transaction  costs  for  bank  clients,  including \nretail customers, are expected as a result. While the documentary requirements \nare  being  relaxed,  these  transactions  will  continue  to  be  covered  by  existing \nprovisions under the Anti-Money Laundering regulations. \n\n5.  There have also been initiatives aimed at improving the BSP\u2019s ability to offset the \neffects  of  inflows  through  proposals  to  amend  the  BSP  Charter,  the  most \nimportant of which is the proposal to allow the BSP to issue its own instruments \nlike  other  central  banks.  The  BSP  has  also  made  representations  with  the \nNational  Government  on \nthe  P40  billion  remaining \ncapitalization of the BSP.  \n\nits  subscription \n\nto \n\nA Closer Look at BSP Intervention \n\nDuring  the  period  1998\u20132007,  the  BSP  continued  to  intervene  in  the  foreign  exchange \nmarket.  The  latter  involves  the  purchase  of  foreign  currency  with  domestic  currency, \nwhich changes the monetary liabilities of the monetary authority, and thus the monetary \nstance. Typically, intervention aims at the following (IMF, 2007b): a) Influencing the level \nof  the  exchange  rate;  b)  Dampening  exchange  rate  changes;  c)  Smoothing  exchange \nrate flexibility; and d) Accumulating reserves. \n\nWhile  not  as  heavy  as  in  other  countries  (Figure  2),  based  on  a  calculated  exchange \nmarket pressure (EMP) index, the intervention was heavier after the crisis (Figure 7 and \nFigure  8).8 The  bars  in  the  figure  divide  the  exchange  market  pressure  on  the  positive \naxis into the need to allow the currency to appreciate and a rise in reserves to prevent \nthe appreciation. A useful comparison is the behavior of EMP during the surge of capital \nflows in 1996 and the surge in 2005. \n\nIn 1996, the maximum value of EMP was only 1.3 (August), while in 2005 the maximum \nvalue was 4.7 (February), even reaching 9.1  in January 2006. The chart clearly  shows \nthat  positive  changes  in  international  reserves  contributed  substantially  to  exchange \nmarket pressure.  \n\nNot  only  has  the  BSP  intervened  more  heavily  after  the  crisis,  sterilization  has \napparently been more pronounced (Table 10). The sterilization coefficient for the period \n1998\u20132007  is  much  higher  compared  to  the  coefficient  between  1987  and  1997.9 The \ncoefficient has also been steadily increasing, which can be observed by comparing the \n\n                                                 \n\ner\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c3 %\n\u03c3\n\n\u0394\n\nres\n\n8 The  EMP  is  calculated  as \n\n\u0394\n\n%\n\ner\nt\n\n+\n\n\u0394\n\nres\n\nt\n\n.  The  exchange  rate  is  defined  as  $/peso,  and  %er \n\nand  res  are  the  percentage  month-on-month  change  of  the  exchange  rate  and  international  reserves, \nrespectively. The EMP normalizes the size of the intervention, therefore making comparisons across time \nvalid. \n\n9 The sterilization coefficient is the coefficient from a regression on the contribution of net domestic assets to \n\nreserve money growth on the contribution of net foreign assets to reserve money growth. \n\n 21\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nregressions for the period 2002.1\u20132004.12, which is the period when inflation targeting \nwas  initiated,  2005.1\u20132007.8,  which  covers  a  period  of  heavy  capital  inflows,  and \n1998.1\u20132007.8. \n\nAn  important  tool  for  sterilization  beginning  in  2006  was  the  special  deposit  account \n(SDA) facility. Established in 1998, SDA is BSP\u2019s alternative to open market operations. \nBanks can place funds with the BSP under the SDA facility which is subject to interest \nrates  depending  on  the  term  of  the  placements.  Interest  rates  have  been  generally \nhigher than those in the money or interbank markets. For example, when the SDA was \nfirst opened to state firms and banks\u2019 trust units in the second quarter of 2007, it offered \nas much as 8% for the three-month tenor while the overnight placements facility stood at \n7.5%. Data in Table 5 show that the 91-day Treasury Bill rate averaged only 5.3 percent \nin 2007.   \n\nData  from  2004  onward  show  that  the  SDA  was  hardly  used  until  2006  (Figure  9).  In \nApril  2006  the  amount  in  the  SDA  jumped  to  P19.3  billion  from  just  P2.5  billion  in \nFebruary  and  P9.6  billion  in  March.  Then  in  September  2006  the  amount  in  the  SDA \nfacility increased to P49.7 billion. \n\nIn May 2007, the BSP allowed banks\u2019 placements in the SDA to be an alternative way to \ncomply with the liquidity floor requirements for government deposits. Access to the SDA \nwas likewise widened to include trust units and state firms. According to some analysts, \nthis was done to mop up excess liquidity and maintain inflation within the target levels. In \nthat same month the SDA increased sharply to P222.9 billion from only P54.2 billion in \nApril, 2007. The amount in the SDA stood at P583.3 billion as of February, 2008. \n\nBecause  of  the  surge  in  the  size  of  the  SDA,  the  BSP  decided  in  March  2008  to \nimplement immediately the following refinements in the facility: (1) the closure of existing \nwindows for the two-, three-, and six-month tenors; and (2) the reduction of the interest \nrates on the remaining tenors.  There was concern that the SDA was siphoning off funds \nfrom investment activity. \n\nVI. \n\nEVALUATION OF POLICY RESPONSES \n\nHas Intervention Worked? \n\nAs  described  earlier,  the  BSP  has  engaged  in  both  sterilized  and  unsterilized \nintervention.  A  simple  correlation  analysis  indicates  that  intervention,  as  measured  by \nthe percentage of international reserves, has limited impact on the exchange rate\u2019s level, \npercentage change, and volatility (Table 11).10 The results indicate that intervention had \na  modicum  of  success  in  reducing  exchange  rate  volatility  in  the  Philippines  between \n1993  and  1996.  Meanwhile,  intervention  prevented  a  rise  in  the  exchange  rate \n(measured  in  US$/peso)  after  the  crisis,  particularly  during  the  period  2003\u20132007.  In \nmany instances the results are counter-intuitive, i.e. the correlation coefficient is positive, \nsimilar  to  the  result  of  the  impulse  response  function  that  was  presented  in  Section  III \n(Figure 4). \n\n                                                 \n10  The  correlation  results  were  supported  by  regression  analysis  using  the  two-stage  least  squares \nprocedures  applied  by  the  IMF  (2007b)  as  described  in  Box  3.2  \u201cThe  Effectiveness  of  Intervention: \nAdditional Tests,\u201d page 39. \n\n 22\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThe empirical results differ from those reported  by the IMF  (2007b) for  the Philippines. \nHowever, the IMF study does find limited evidence of systematic links between sterilized \nintervention and exchange rates in the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Republic of Korea, \nand  Thailand.  The  general  result  is  somewhat  unexpected  given  the  low  degree  of \nsubstitutability of emerging market assets and the large size of interventions relative to \ncurrency market turnover in emerging markets. The IMF explains the results as follows: \n\n\u201cFirst, persistent structural factors may be driving the \nappreciation of the currency, obscuring any effect of \nintervention beyond a short period. Second, to the extent \nthat sterilized intervention prevents the domestic interest \nrate from adjusting (especially downwards), it would have \nlimited effects on capital flows driven by interest rate \ndifferentials, thereby failing to alleviate upward pressure on \nthe currency.\u201d \n\nSome  studies  (e.g.  Lamberte,  1995)  support  the  relatively  large  offset  coefficient  of \nsterilized  intervention  in  the  Philippines.  In  2007,  the  rate  of  appreciation  of  the  peso \nincreased  significantly  after  access  to  the  SDA  was  expanded  in  May  (Figure  9). \nHowever, as noted earlier, the persistent appreciation of the Philippine peso after 2005 \nshould also be viewed in the general context of the weak US dollar.  \n\nOn  its  part,  the  BSP  argues  that  its  intervention  policy  cannot  be  judged  by  the  size \nalone.  The  size  and  nature  of  the  shocks  and  the  economy\u2019s  financial  vulnerability \nshould also be considered. Amid higher volatility of capital flows, BSP intervention needs \nto be commensurately large to maintain orderly market conditions. The Philippine foreign \nexchange market has expanded considerably in the past decade\u2014by more than fivefold \nin  terms  of  the  daily  turnover  in  the  foreign  exchange  market\u2014and  the  gross  foreign \nexchange  flows  through  the  financial  system  have  correspondingly  also  grown  in \nmagnitude.11 \n\nMoreover,  the  BSP  has  been  accumulating  reserves  as  a  form  of  self-insurance  or \nprecautionary reserves balance, as a first line of defense against future financial crises. \nThis  becomes  more  important  in  light  of  the  debt  burden  of  the  Philippines  which \nremains  high  relative  to  its  comparators.  Intervention  should  therefore  be  adjusted  for \npassive  intervention.12 The  BSP  argues  that  the  analysis  should  therefore  distinguish \nbetween  more  permanent  flows  such  as  exports  and  remittances  and  those  driven  by \ncyclical trends (e.g., higher cross-border flows) as a result, for instance, of diversification \nby central banks and sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in Asia and the Middle East, and \nstructural portfolio adjustments in the private sector, as home bias declines worldwide. If \ncyclical  factors  are  driving  the  trends  in  the  inflows,  intervention  may  be  necessary  to \nmoderate the macroeconomic imbalances that could result from such large inflows.  \n                                                 \n11 The  views  of  the  BSP,  as  contained  in  this  paragraph  and  the  next  two,  were  expressed  by  Dr.  Cyd \nTua\u00f1o-Amador,  Managing  Director  for  Research  of  the  BSP,  during  the  ADBI  workshop  in  Tokyo  on \nDecember 11-12.  \n\n12 Dr. Tua\u00f1o-Amador cited the fact that the IMF mission recognizes that BSP needs to build up reserves. In \nthe  2006  Article  IV  consultation  report,  IMF  staff  noted  that  \u201c\u2026reserve  cover  remains  low  compared  to \nother emerging markets\u2026 Some further intervention to build reserves therefore seems justified.\u201d Former \nIMF Managing Director Rodrigo De Rato in a speech in Thailand in 2007 stated that \u201cThere is a place in \nmanaging  capital  inflows  for  intervention,  especially  where  inflows  of  capital  appear  to  be  a  short-term \nsurge  rather  than  a  long-term  trend\u201d\u2026and  that  \u201cthe  Fund  recognizes  that  intervention  can  be  an \nappropriate tool of macroeconomic management.\u201d \n\n 23\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nWhile  the  Philippines\u2019  international  reserves  have  risen  significantly  in  the  past  two \nyears, the relative size of the stock of reserves remains considerably smaller compared \nto  other  countries  in  the  region  classified  as  independent  floaters.  This  is  the  same \nobservation  made  by  Ho  and  McCauley  (2007).  The  BSP  cites  the  IMF  (2007b)  study \nwhich shows that for 2000\u20132007 the BSP\u2019s intervention has been effective in tempering \nthe  volatility  of  exchange  rate  movements.  This  is  precisely  the  principle  behind  the \nBSP\u2019s intervention policy: reducing volatilities rather than swaying the exchange rate in \none direction or changing the path of the exchange rate. \n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  money  supply  growth  in  the  third  quarter  of  2007  fell  to \n12.4% without any significant rise in interest rates (Table 5). Inflation in 2007 was only \n2.8%,  below  the  target  range  of  4-5%.  These  data  indicate  the  effectives  of  sterilized \nintervention, particularly the use of the SDA. However, intervention and the subsequent \nsterilization  have \nfacing  similar \ncircumstances.  This  is  another  reason  that  the  BSP  has  built  up  its  capital  reserves. \nThese accumulated surpluses now serve as a buffer for losses that the BSP is incurring \nin its stabilization efforts. \n\nfinancial  costs  and  other  central  banks  are \n\nHas Inflation-Targeting been Undermined by Foreign Exchange Inflows? \n\nIn  January  2002,  the  BSP  formally  shifted  to  an  inflation  targeting  framework  from  a \nmonetary aggregating targeting approach in formulating monetary policy. The shift in the \nBSP\u2019s  policy  framework  from  a  monetary  aggregate  targeting  approach  to  inflation \ntargeting  was  prompted  by  the  observation  that  the  historical  relationship  between \ninflation  and  money  supply  had  weakened,  thus  undermining  the  effectiveness  of  the \npolicy  of  targeting  monetary  aggregates.  Innovations  in  financial  products  and  financial \nmarkets, and greater financial liberalization have altered the link between money supply \nand inflation. \n\nWith  more  open  capital  accounts,  many  countries\u2014including  the  Philippines\u2014decided \nthat a flexible exchange rate framework is better suited to cushioning domestic economic \nperformance  from  external  disturbances  than  fixed  nominal  exchange  rates.  In  this \ncontext,  the  inflation  target,  rather  than  the  fixed  exchange  rate,  performs  the  role  of  a \nnominal anchor. The BSP is expected to intervene less in the foreign exchange market, \nallowing the exchange rate to absorb shocks induced by capital flows. \n\nThe  empirical  results  discussed  indicate  that  the  BSP  may  be  having  difficulty  in \nimplementing  the  inflation-targeting  framework.  Surges  in  foreign  exchange  inflows\u2014\nboth  from  the  current  and  capital  accounts\u2014seem  to  have  compelled  the  BSP  to \nintervene  in  the  exchange  rate  market  and  revert  to  targeting  monetary  aggregates. \nWhether this has reduced the effectiveness of inflation-targeting is an issue that has to \nbe analyzed and discussed carefully. \n\nA  recent  study  by  Ho  and  McCauley  (2007)  analyzes  whether  the  policy  of  countering \nforeign  exchange  inflows  with  sterilized  intervention  will  result  in  unintended  adverse \ndomestic consequences, particularly in three areas: monetary control, financial stability, \nand  central  bank  profitability  and  balance  sheet  risk.  In  the  case  of  monetary  control, \nforeign reserve accumulation may lead to a \u201ctechnical\u201d sterilization problem wherein the \ncentral banks are not able to achieve their operating targets whether they be in terms of \na  quantity  or  price.  Otherwise,  foreign  reserve  accumulation  may  \u201ccompromise  the \n\n 24\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\ngoals\u201d  of  central  banks  by  inducing  them  to  adopt  a  more  accommodative  monetary \npolicy stance than that required by their inflation objective. \n\nHo and McCauley conclude that, with perhaps the very recent and short-lived exceptions \nof India and the Philippines, it is difficult to argue that Asian central banks have technical \ndifficulties  with  sterilization  as  a  result  of  large-scale  foreign  exchange  purchases. \nEvidence  from  interest  rate  targeting  central  banks  suggests  technically  effective \nsterilization.  Meanwhile,  during  the  period  2002\u201306,  Asia  did  not  provide  evidence  that \nlarge-scale  reserve  accumulation  would  be  inflationary.  The  Philippines  did  over-shoot \nits inflation targets during this period but its intervention was not as heavy as the other \ncountries. Moreover, the relatively high inflation was attributed to supply side factors. \n\nThe  BSP  argues  that  attention  is  given  to  monetary  aggregates  because  they  have \nimportant  information  content.  Monetary  and  credit  aggregates  are  some  of  the  many \nvariables  that  are  examined  in  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  under  an  inflation \ntargeting framework, which is information intensive in its consideration of the factors that \nshould  underpin  policy  action.  There  is  a  large,  although  not  undisputed,  body  of \nevidence which  suggests that persistently high growth of money and credit aggregates \nmay provide useful \u201cearly warnings\u201d of emerging financial imbalances and may serve as \nleading indicators of pressures on aggregate demand and on inflation expectations that \nmatter for overall underlying price stability. The growth of monetary aggregates that are \nbeyond the requirements of the economy will tell in the long run on the future evolution \nof prices.13 \n\nMeanwhile, an accurate representation of BSP\u2019s treatment of the exchange rate in the IT \nframework is one where there is willingness to tolerate a significant degree of variability \nin  the  exchange  rate  and  to  be  sufficiently  disciplined  to  participate  in  the  foreign \nexchange  market  only  in  well-defined  circumstances.  As  noted  earlier,  the  BSP \nintervenes in the market only to temper wide swings in the exchange rate that can lead \nto disorderly market conditions. However, it is important to underscore that in responding \nto capital flows, the BSP follows a package of policy measures. This policy mix includes, \napart  from  exchange  rate  stability,  the  build-up  of  international  reserves  and  the \nprepayment  of  external  obligations.  It  was  pointed  out  in  Section  V  that  the  BSP  has \nbeen encouraging the shift in the borrowing mix of the government in favor of domestic \nborrowing.  Capital  account  liberalization,  specifically  through  easing  of  regulations  on \nnon-trade transactions and outward capital investments, continues to be pursued, not for \nthe sake of supporting the peso, but because of the economic gains it can bring by way \nof portfolio diversification and improved risk management.  \n\nReserve Accumulation: Another Interpretation \n\nThe relatively benign effects of reserve accumulation\u2014or central bank intervention in the \nforeign  exchange  market\u2014have  contributed  to  the  favorable  assessment  of  the  BSP, \nparticularly with regard to inflation-targeting. However, economic slack and consequently \nlow  domestic  interest  rates  in  Asia,  including  the  Philippines,  contributed  largely  to  the \nnon-manifestation  of  the  usual  effects  of  reserve  accumulation  (Ho  and  McCauley, \n2007). In this context, Ho and McCauley suggest that reserve accumulation should not \nbe viewed as an exogenous policy with consequences, but rather as a consequence of \n\n                                                 \n13 The  views  in  this  paragraph  and  the  next  were  also  expressed  by  Dr.  Tua\u00f1o-Amador  during  the  ADBI \n\nworkshop on December 11-12, 2007. \n\n 25\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nparticular  economic  circumstances.  In  particular,  the  strong  efforts  to  resist  currency \nappreciation  in  Asia  can  be  seen  as  a  response  to  weak  post-crisis  recovery  in \ninvestment (Table 12). \n\nA related view is that the accumulation of reserves is largely a consequence of the low \ninvestment  rate  which  in  turn  is  a  direct  result  of  the  uncertainty  spawned  by  the  1997 \nfinancial crisis. For example, Genberg et al. (2005) argue that: \n\n\u201cAlthough it may sound paradoxical, reforms that have \ncontributed to liberalizing and opening domestic financial \nmarkets appear to have weakened investment demand \nthroughout East Asia. Banks and other financial institutions \nhave become much more reluctant to finance long-term \nand risky investment projects out of concern for the quality \nof their asset portfolios\u2026Financial institutions, \ncorporations, and governments themselves have all been \npreoccupied with strengthening their financial positions to \ninsulate themselves against external financial shocks and \nspeculative attacks.\u201d \n\nAsian  Development  Bank  (2007)  cites  the  favorable  conditions  for  a  recovery  in \ninvestment  in  East  Asia:  strong  profits,  easy  credit  availability,  rebound  in  prices  of \nphysical  assets,  reductions  in  debt,  and  elimination  of  excess  capacity.  The  sluggish \ninvestment  performance  as  shown  in  Table  12  is  therefore  rather  surprising  and  ADB \nattributes  this  to  increased  uncertainty  and  risk.  Consistent  with  the  argument  of \nGenberg  et  al.,  the  accumulation  of  reserves  is  a  response  to  the  increase  in  risk  and \nuncertainty, which ultimately has an adverse impact on fixed investment. \n\nThe  sharp  fall  of  the  investment  rate  can  partly  explain  the  present  Philippine \nmacroeconomic  situation  wherein  the  rapid  inflow  of  foreign  exchange  is  accompanied \nby an accumulation of  reserves, an appreciating currency in nominal  and real terms, a \ncurrent account surplus, rising money supply growth, stable interest rates and inflation, \nand an improving fiscal balance. The situation is markedly different from the one prior to \nthe  crisis  when  the  inflow  of  foreign  exchange  was  accompanied  by  less  exchange \nmarket  intervention,  a  large  current  account  deficit,  a  fairly  stable  nominal  exchange \nrate,  relatively  high  inflation,  interest  rates  and  money  supply  growth,  and  a  fiscal \nsurplus. In this context, the following arguments can be made: \n\n\u2022  The  proposal  of  the  IMF  (2007a)  to  stem  currency  appreciation  through  fiscal \nrestraint  is  not  applicable  to  the  Philippines  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  fiscal \nsituation  in  the  Philippines,  while  still  vulnerable,  has  improved  markedly  in  the \npast  two  years.  And  second,  the  recommendation  of  the  IMF  for  fiscal  restraint \nwas in the context of correcting a current account deficit. \n\n\u2022  The more relevant issue for the Philippines is stimulating private investment. This \nwill  lead  to  higher  growth  of  imports  and  a  deterioration  of  the  current  account \nbalance which will then check the appreciation of the peso. \n\n\u2022  The  accumulation  of  reserves  and  subsequent  sterilization  has  not  undermined \nthe policy of inflation targeting. However, as indicated earlier the rise in reserves \nis not necessarily an \u201cintervention\u201d on the part of the BSP and may not even be a \nresult of precautionary motives on the part of economic agents. Rather, reserve \naccumulation is a direct result of weak investment growth, which is reflected in a \n\n 26\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\ncurrent account surplus. A weak investment rate puts a cap on interest rates by \nlowering  the  demand  for  credit.  The  low  interest  rate  cum  low  credit  growth \nscenario  then  provides  leeway  for  the  BSP  to  successfully  sterilize  the  rise  in \nforeign exchange reserves. Nevertheless, the scenario may change dramatically \nonce  private  investment  recovers  and  central  banks  have  to  adjust  their  policy \nstance accordingly. \n\nVII. \n\nTHE WAY FORWARD \n\nMeasures to Increase Private Investment \n\nThe first set of policy recommendations should deal with stimulating private investment \nin the Philippines. This problem has been the subject of many studies. The recent ADB \nstudy gives a succinct description of the main issues:14 \n\n\u201cFor Indonesia and the Philippines, where improvements \nhave already taken place in the macroeconomic policy \nenvironment, the key to sustaining growth is likely to lie in \nimproving the quality and performance of key institutions \nthat influence investor perceptions about uncertainties, \nrisks, and the costs of doing business\u2026In the Philippines \n(too), governance issues are to the fore. Contract \nenforcement, corruption, and crime and security are of \nparticular concern\u2026Poor infrastructure, particularly in \npower and transportation, add most to costs. Generally, the \ninstitutions of government are weak and this has slowed \nthe pace of progress. Complex rules and regulations do not \nadequately address competition issues and continue to \ncreate fertile ground for rent seeking. In a variety of \ndimensions, prospects for raising investment and \naccelerated growth will depend on the capacity of \ninstitutions to move ahead and implement the changes that \nare required to reduce uncertainty and risk.\u201d \n\nA more direct mechanism to ease pressure on the current account would be to channel \nworkers\u2019 remittances to more productive investment projects. The econometric evidence \nclearly shows a link between remittances and investment but the latter should go beyond \nhousing  and  small-scale  transportation  which  are  the  more  popular  options  at  present. \nTo facilitate more productive investment, the BSP has adopted measures to encourage \noverseas  Filipinos \nfinancial  system,  such  as  enhancing \nthe \ntransparency  and  promoting  competition  in  the  remittance  market;  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s  payment  and  settlement  systems  and  the  access  to  financial  services; \nencouraging overseas Filipinos  and  their families to increase savings and investments; \nand cultivating financial literacy among overseas Filipinos and their families. \n\nto  remit \n\nthrough \n\n                                                 \n14 A recent World Bank Study explains the dilemma of rising economic growth and declining investment. See \nA. M. Bocchi, \u201cRising growth, declining investment: the puzzle of the Philippines.\u201d Manuscript, November \n1, 2007. \n\n 27\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nThe Heart of the Matter \n\nEarlier  it  was  mentioned  that  the  progress  in  reforming  the  IFA  has  been  uneven  and \nasymmetric. This can gleaned from the Philippine case wherein emphasis has been on \nreforming the domestic financial system. Despite the substantial progress that has been \nmade, the economy is still having difficulty coping with a rapidly appreciating peso. The \nlatter is argued to be largely a result of the weak US dollar, the volatility of which over \nthe past four years is a manifestation of problems in the IFA. \n\nThe uneven and asymmetric progress in the reform of the IFA\u2014particularly the inability \n\u201cto guarantee a more coherent macroeconomic policy approach at the global level\u201d\u2014 is \na manifestation of the unipolar world of finance which has been characterized as unjust \nand  unsustainable. 15 This  is  an  extension  of  Triffin\u2019s  dilemma.  In  the  present  global \nfinancial system most of the international trade is denominated in US dollars, most of the \ninternational reserves are held in US dollars, and the US can pay for its external deficits \nby  printing  dollars  which  it  does  not  expect  to  be  redeemed  in  the  foreseeable  future. \nThe US-led private financial institutions intermediate a major part of international savings \nand  investments  and  the  US-led  international  financial  institutions  now  play  a  decisive \nrole in determining the macroeconomic policies of many developing countries. \n\nUnder the unipolar financial system, the US has been appropriating seigniorage that is \ncreated by expanding world trade and cross-border capital flows. Because the US gets \ntremendous  benefits  in  terms  of  financial  gain  and  ideological  hegemony,  it  cannot  be \nexpected to surrender these gains voluntarily through a meaningful reform of the IFA. In \nthe  unipolar  world  of  finance,  the  US  has  had  a  soft  budget  constraint  in  terms  of  its \nexternal  deficit.  The  US  has  been  able  to  combine  a  widening  current  account  deficit \nwith an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate\u2014or at least one that is relatively \nstable\u2014because  of  huge  capital  inflows.  This  has  led  to  what  has  been  referred  to  as \nthe trans-Pacific macroeconomic imbalance. \n\nHowever,  the  US  current  account  deficit  reached  $857  billion  in  2006,  equivalent  to  a \nhistorical  high  of  6.5%  of  GDP.  As  a  point  of  comparison,  the  combined  GDP  of  the \nASEAN member countries was $884 billion in 2005 and approximately $1 trillion in 2006. \nLargely  because  of  its  soft  budget  constraint,  the  US  has  become  the  world\u2019s  largest \ndebtor nation with a net foreign debt of $2.7 trillion as of 2005. Another major cause for \nconcern is that the annual balance of net income on domestic and foreign investments in \nthe  US  was  \u2013$1  billion  in  2006,  making  it  the  first  year  on  record  with  a  negative  net \nincome flow. If \u201cnet investment income\u201d continues to deteriorate, it will add to the current \naccount deficit and increase the risk of a major reduction or reversal in the capital inflows \ninto the US. \n\nIn this context, fixed investment in East Asia may actually be constrained by the need to \nsupport  the  trans-Pacific  macroeconomic  imbalance  and  prevent  the  sharp  fall  of  the \ndollar.  The  sustainability  of  the  trans-Pacific  macroeconomic  imbalance  has  been  a \nsubject of debate and there is  still  no consensus.16 However, the sharp  depreciation of \n                                                 \n15 A large part of this section is lifted from Agarwala (2004). \n16 The more appropriate term is \u201cglobal macroeconomic imbalances\u201d since the US has a deficit also with the \nEU. This issue and the possibility of East Asian investment being constrained by the need to support the \nUS dollar is discussed thoroughly in the following recently published books Global Imbalances and the US \nDebt Problem \u2013 Should Developing Countries Support the US Dollar?

Yap \n\nthe US dollar, particularly since March 2006 and a pending US economic recession may \nbe an indication of a difficult adjustment process. \n\nIn  order  to  partly  address  the  inequity  caused  by  a  unipolar  financial  system,  the \nexpanded use of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) was recommended. The introduction of \nSDRs in 1969 created a truly global money  to be used exclusively as a reserve asset, \nthus generating a more balanced distribution of seigniorage powers. Unfortunately, this \nproposal has not been implemented. A recommendation for a third allocation of SDRs, \nthough  approved  by  77%  voting  majority  of  the  IMF  in  1997,  did  not  come  into  effect \nbecause of opposition by the US Congress.  \n\nOther  recommendations  include  an  international  currency  (Mundell,  2003)  and  an \ninternational  clearing  agency  (ICA)  (D\u2019Arista,  2006).  This  ICA  could  be  based  on  a \nproposal  by  John  Maynard  Keynes  revised  to  serve  as  the  institutional  platform  for  a \nnew  global  payments  system  that  would  foster  egalitarian  interactions  and  more \nbalanced  outcomes.  The  new  ICA  would  clear  transactions  denominated  in  members\u2019 \naccounts. These clearing accounts would, in fact, constitute the international reserves of \nthe system, held for the member countries by the ICA and valued using a trade-weighted \nbasket of all members\u2019 currencies. \n\nRegional Monetary and Financial Cooperation \n\nRegional  financial  and  monetary  cooperation  in  East  Asia  is  at  a  critical  juncture.  The \nway  forward  has  tremendous  implications  for  the  IFA.  The  \u201ceasy\u201d  phase  of  the  reform \nprocess in East Asia is at its tail end. Policymakers in the region now have to agree to a \nblueprint  for  financial  sector  development  in  the  foreseeable  future,  the  long-term \nobjective  of  which  Kuroda  (2004)  succinctly  identified  as  the  establishment  of  a  single \ncurrency in East Asia. This would cover the need to channel more East Asian savings to \ninfrastructure and investment projects in the region. \n\nThe main elements of the blueprint are: (i) the structure of regional financial cooperation \nin terms of reserve pooling and exchange rate coordination; (ii) the relationship between \nregional  cooperation  and  the  domestic  financial  system,  including  required  domestic \neconomic  reforms;  (iii)  the  institutional  set-up  in  the  region  that  will  underpin \nimplementation  of  the  blueprint;  and  (iv)  the  non-economic  objectives  of  regional \nfinancial cooperation. \n\nlast \n\ntwo  elements  have \n\nThe \nimportant  political  economy  considerations.  More \nspecifically, they involve establishing a political consensus which is difficult in East Asia \ndue  to  differences  in  political  systems,  \u201chistory\u201d  issues  and  the  lack  of  mutual  trust \n(Kawai, 2005). No single economic power plays a dominant role in East Asia similar to \nthat of the US in the Western Hemisphere, nor does any bipolar relationship exist similar \nto the Franco-German alliance in Western Europe. Japan has been mired in economic \nstagnation  over  the  last  decade  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  while  recently \nemerging as an economic power, has yet to achieve full transition to a market economy \nand, more fundamentally, political transition. \n\n                                                                                                                                               \nInternational  Financial  System.  Edited  by  J.  J.  Teunissen.  Fondad,  The  Hague,  June  2007.  The  books \ncontain relevant policy recommendations on how to address the unipolar financial system. \n\n 29\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nPromoting  non-economic  objectives  highlights  the  political  economy  issues  that  are \ninvolved.  In  light  of  the  European  experience,  an  important  consideration  in  evaluating \nthe  trade-off  between  the  potential  benefits  to  be  reaped  from  exchange  rate \ncoordination  and  the  potential  costs  associated  with  the  loss  of  macroeconomic  policy \nindependence arising from the implied need for broader macroeconomic cooperation, is \nwhether the ultimate goals of financial cooperation in East Asia are wholly economic or \nalso  partly  political.  The  goal  could  ultimately  be  political  if  the  objective  of  fostering \nincreased  regional  economic  integration  is  paramount,  and  that  objective  is  itself  an \ninstrumental  one  designed  to  achieve  political  goals.  These  could  include,  as  in  the \nEuropean case:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe  desire  to  defuse  potential  regional  political  conflicts.  An  important \nassumption  driving  European  integration  was  that  enhanced  economic \ninterdependence  would  induce  European  countries  to  focus  on  common \ninterests.  \n\n(ii)  Allowing  the  region  to  speak  more  effectively  with  one  voice  in  international \naffairs. This was also an important motive in Europe, and has played a role in \nother  regional  integration  initiatives.  As  the  world  economy  becomes \nincreasingly  globalized  and  international  negotiations  on  financial  and \ncommercial issues intensify, its importance may be increasing over time. \n\nGrenville (2003) similarly points out that: \n\n\u201cRegional groupings are the principal way of addressing \nthis \u2018democratic deficit\u2019. There seems little room for debate \nthat this region is inadequately represented in many of the \nforums which determine the important issues of \nglobalization. There seems little doubt, also, that the region \npays a price for this. East Asia, with an IMF quota of less \nthan 15 percent, accounts for more than 20 percent of \nworld GDP, almost a quarter of world trade, and almost half \nof world foreign exchange reserves.\u201d \n\nIn  other  words,  the  process  of  institutionalizing  East  Asian  regional  cooperation  should \nbe a venue where common interests of the countries can be articulated. Subsequently, it \ncan be a vehicle by which these interests are pushed in the global setting.  \n\nThe inability of East Asia to effectively speak with one voice, particularly with regard to \nthe IFA, is one major reason why reform of the latter has become uneven, asymmetric, \nand  patchy.  A  case  in  point  is  the  proposed  measures  to  address  the  trans-Pacific \nmacroeconomic imbalance. Currently, policy proposals that are played up in the media \nare  focused  on  revaluing  East  Asian  currencies,  particularly  the  yuan.  However,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China is not large enough an economy to be responsible for the US \ndeficits or to be able to correct them. Between 1997 and 2004, the US current account \ndeficit deteriorated by $529 billion, and, over the same period, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina\u2019s current account position improved by only $35.6 billion (Genberg et al., 2005). A \nunited East Asian front could throw its weight towards a solution that emphasizes fiscal \nconsolidation by the US, which makes more economic sense.  \n\nAnother  important  issue  is  that  of  capital  controls,  which  have  proven  be  effective  in \nseveral  economies  (see  for  example  Epstein  et  al.,  2004).  This  is  evident  with  the \n\n 30\n\n\fADBI Discussion Paper 91 \n\n \n\nJosef T. Yap \n\nbehavior  of  the  Malaysian  ringgit  compared  to  other  currencies  in  the  region  (Figure  1 \nand Table 7). However, with the advent of greater financial integration, capital controls, \nparticularly  on  inflows,  have  to  be  endorsed  at  the  international  level  in  order  to  be \neffective (Grenville, 2007). Given that this would require IMF endorsement, international \nbacking  of  any  form  of  capital  controls  is  unlikely.  Hence,  endorsement  at  the  regional \nlevel  would  be  a  second  best  solution.  A  united  East  Asian  front  could  subsequently \nadvocate  for  fundamental  reform  of  the  IFA,  particularly  with  regard  to  its  current \nunipolar structure. \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAgarwala,  R.

Yap \n", "Abstract \n \nDuring  the  past  five  years  or  so,  most  East  Asian  economies  including  the  Philippines \nexperienced a rising level of foreign exchange reserves and rapidly appreciating currencies \nboth in nominal and real terms. One cause has been the resurgence of capital flows, which \nmakes the issue of how to manage them relevant. However, the experience with regard to \ncapital  flows  among  East  Asian  economies  is  mixed  and  the  level  of  capital  flows  to  the \nregion  is  proportionally  less  than  that  prior  to  the  1997  crisis.  Another reason  is  the  rise in \ncurrent account surpluses. The Philippines has experienced both a return of capital inflows \nand a more favorable current account balance, with the latter largely due to remittances from \noverseas  workers.  However,  like  many  other  regional  currencies,  the  appreciation  of  the \npeso is not commensurate to movements of the BOP accounts. Currencies in the region are \nreacting  primarily  to  the  general  weakness  of  the  US  dollar,  and  global  uncertainties  have \ncontributed  to  weak  investment  which  in  turn  is  another  major  reason  behind  the  current \naccount  surplus  of  several  economies  including  the  Philippines.  Policy  measures  at  the \ndomestic  level  can  focus  on  reviving  private  investment,  particularly  channeling  overseas \nremittances  to  more  productive  investment.  Meanwhile,  East  Asian  financial  and  monetary \ncooperation  can  also  result  in  a  unified  front  aimed  at  overhauling  the  unipolar  global \nfinancial system. \n", "JEL Classification: F31, F32, F37 \n", " \n"]}
