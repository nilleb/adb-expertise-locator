However, the experience with regard to \ncapital flows among East Asian economies is mixed and the level of capital flows to the \nregion is proportionally less than that prior to the 1997 crisis.

However, like many other regional currencies, the appreciation of the \npeso is not commensurate to movements of the BOP accounts. Currencies in the region are \nreacting primarily to the general weakness of the US dollar, and global uncertainties have \ncontributed to weak investment which in turn is another major reason behind the current \naccount surplus of several economies including the Philippines. Policy measures at the \ndomestic level can focus on reviving private investment, particularly channeling overseas \nremittances to more productive investment. Meanwhile, East Asian financial and monetary \ncooperation can also result  in a unified front aimed at  overhauling the unipolar global \nfinancial system. \nJEL Classification: F31, F32, F37 \n ", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T.

Yap \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThe global financial instability that was spawned by the 1997 East Asian financial crisis \ngenerated a broad consensus that the international financial architecture (IFA) had to be \nreformed. The proposed reforms had two wide-ranging objectives (Griffith-Jones and \nOcampo, 2003): (i) to prevent currency and banking crises and better manage them \nwhen they occur; and (ii) to support adequate provision of net private and public flows to \ndeveloping countries, particularly low-income ones. Much progress has been made in \nterms of reforming the IFA during the past ten years. However, the progress has been \nuneven and asymmetric and in certain areas patchy (Griffith-Jones and Ocampo, 2003; \nWang, 2004; Kawai, 2005; World Bank, 2005; and Kawai and Houser, 2007). \nFor  example,  there  have  been  many  advances  in  terms  of  regional  financial  and \nmonetary cooperation in East Asia. Just last 5 May 2007, the ASEAN+3 nations agreed \nto pool the region\u2019s vast foreign currency reserves. However, the urgency of architectural \nreform in the G-7 countries has receded considerably (Wang, 2004). This was echoed \nby Sakakibara (2003) when he argued that the lack of global governance, including a \nglobal  lender  of  last  resort  and  international  financial  regulation,  is  not  likely  to  be \nremedied  anytime  soon.  As  long  as  the  structural  problems  on  the  supply  side  of \ninternational capital such as volatile capital movements and G-3 exchange rate gyrations \npersist, the East Asian countries will remain as vulnerable to future crises. \nThere are many indications of the inadequacies in the reform of the IFA. For example, \nTable 1 shows that in 2006 aggregate net resource flows into developing countries \nreached $566 billion, the bulk of which comprised foreign direct investment (FDI) and \nportfolio equity. This $94 billion in \u201chot money\u201d that poured into developing countries in \n2006 is three times the peak reached in 1997. The development is largely brought about \nby a situation of excess global liquidity, which in turn is related to the problem of global \nmacroeconomic imbalances. With the abundance of global liquidity, investors are lured \ninto emerging markets which offer higher returns. The resulting inflow of capital has \ncreated \u201cimportant challenges for policymakers because of their potential to generate \noverheating, loss of competitiveness, and increased vulnerability to crisis\u201d (IMF, 2007a).  \nThe macroeconomic difficulties spawned by the surge in capital inflows have elicited \nvarious policy responses (IMF, 2007a): \n\u201cWhereas some countries have let exchange rates move \nupward, in many cases the monetary authorities have \nintervened heavily in foreign exchange markets to resist \nheavy currency appreciation. To varying degrees, they \nhave sought to neutralize the monetary impact of \nintervention through sterilization, with a view to forestalling \nan excessively rapid expansion of domestic demand. \nControls on capital inflows have been introduced or \ntightened, and controls on outflows eased, to relieve \nupward pressure on exchange rates. Fiscal policies have \nalso responded\u2014in some cases, stronger revenue growth \nfrom buoyant activity has been harnessed to achieve better \nfiscal outcomes, although in many countries rising \nrevenues have led to higher government spending.\u201d \n 3", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThe chart in Figure 1 shows that recently real effective exchange rates in four of the five \ncountries  hardest  hit  by  the  1997  crisis  are  generally  following  the  same  pattern \nobserved prior to July 1997.1 Meanwhile, many economies in emerging East Asia are \naccumulating reserves beyond the optimal level, either to self-insure against financial \ncrises or to prevent nominal and/or real appreciation of their currencies in the face of \nincreasing capital flows (see Figure 2). The stock of foreign exchange reserves in these \neconomies rose from an average of $289.5 billion in 1990\u201395 to $2.1 trillion at the end of \n2006.  \nIn this paper, the experience of the Philippines with regard to managing capital inflows\u2014\nor more generally foreign exchange inflows\u2014from 1987\u20132007 is reviewed, with focus on \nthe post\u20131997 period since earlier work (Lamberte, 1995) has adequately analyzed the \nexperienced prior to the crisis. The impact of foreign exchange inflows will be analyzed \nand the policy responses, particularly those initiated by the BSP will be evaluated. The \nfindings of this paper will be input into a cross-country study of managing capital flows in \nAsia. \nII.  MANAGING CAPITAL FLOWS: KEY ISSUES \nDeterminants of Capital Flows \nThe surge in capital flows to emerging market economies in the past 20 years or so is a \nreflection of the rapid expansion and integration of international capital markets that had \nbeen driven by economic policy and structural changes, and technological factors. The \nlatter refer to revolutionary advances in handling of information and telecommunications \nand the emergence of increasingly sophisticated financial engineering. These factors \nhave increased the speed and complexity of capital account transactions. Meanwhile, \neconomic policy and structural changes from the standpoint of developing economies \ncan be categorized into two broad groups: those that are country-specific, or \u201cpull\u201d \nfactors; and those that are external to the country and beyond its control, or \u201cpush\u201d \nfactors. \nOne set of \u201cpull\u201d factors were policies that improved the relations of heavily indebted \ncountries with external creditors. A key element was the role of debt-equity swaps in \nincreasing  the  expected  rate  of  return  on  domestic  investment  projects,  thereby \nencouraging FDI (Calvo et al., 1994). Successful price stabilization programs that were \naccompanied  by  improved  fiscal  policy  fundamentals  and  greater  macroeconomic \nstability  were  also  major  pull  factors.  Lastly,  institutional  reforms  such  as  the \nliberalization of the capital account played a significant role in attracting capital flows. \nIndeed, the right to repatriate dividends and capital may have been the most important \nfactor in the surge of foreign equity flows to emerging market economies (Taylor and \nSarno, 1997). \nAmong the prominent \u201cpush\u201d factors were the decline in international interest rates and \neconomic  recessions  in  industrialized  countries.  These  factors  reduced  profit \nopportunities  in  world  financial  centers  and  drove  international  capital  to  emerging \nmarket economies. Another type of push factor was in the mode of contagion effects. \n                                                 \n1 The underlying factors are quite different, however. The sharp appreciation of REER prior to the crisis was \ndue largely to the depreciation of the yen. The recent appreciation of REER is due more to nominal \ncurrency appreciation as a result of foreign exchange inflows and general weakness of the dollar. \n 4", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nLarge shifts in capital flows to one or two large countries in a region may have generated \nexternalities for the smaller neighboring countries (Calvo et al., 1996). \nIn terms of actual policy adjustments, regulatory changes in the US and Europe made it \neasier for foreign firms to place their equity and bonds under more attractive conditions \nto  investors.  This  facilitated  the  trend  towards  international  portfolio  diversification. \nMeanwhile, competition and rising labor costs in industrialized countries, along with \nfalling  transport  and  communications  costs,  induced  firms  to  seek  opportunities  to \nincrease efficiency and returns by producing abroad (Rana, 1998). The realignment of \nmajor  currencies  contributed  to  this  process.  The  result  has  been  a  progressive \nglobalization of production and the growth of FDI flows. \nA crucial debate has been on the relative importance of \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d factors in the \nevolution of capital flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors were the primary determinants of capital flows \ninto  emerging  market  economies,  this  would  support  the  optimistic  view  that  the \nsustainability of these flows is to a large extent a function of domestic policies under the \ncontrol of developing countries. On the other hand, if the surge in capital flows was \nmostly a result of \u201cpush\u201d factors, particularly interest rate movements, this would support \nthe view that the capital flows are highly volatile because they are subject to factors \nbeyond the control of policymakers (Fernandez-Arias, 1996). \nThe empirical evidence has generally been mixed. Some analysts argue that the weight \nof the evidence favors the push view\u2014that falling US interest rates have played a \ndominant role  in driving capital flows to developing countries (Fernandez-Arias and \nMontiel,  1996).  Other  studies  have  shown  that  country  specific  factors\u2014e.g.  the \ndomestic credit rating and black market exchange premium\u2014have been as important in \ninfluencing  capital  flows,  particularly  portfolio  flows  (Taylor  and  Sarno,  1997).  The \nprimacy of \u201cpull\u201d factors, however, can be questioned on several counts. Although it is \ntrue that not all countries have been recipients of the new inflows, it is also true that \nflows  have  not  been  restricted  to  countries  with  well-established  track  records  of \nmacroeconomic and structural adjustment. Second, country creditworthiness depends \nnot  only  on  domestic  factors  but  also  on  the  international  interest  rate.  Third,  the \nsignificant role of contagion in the 1997 Asian financial crisis points to the relative \nstrength of \u201cpush\u201d factors. \nKnowledge of the determinants of capital flows has profound implications in terms of \nappropriate  policy  responses.  In  this  context,  the  overriding  objective  of  economic \nmanagers is to maximize the benefits of capital flows and minimize their costs. \nAdvantages of Greater Capital Mobility \nGreater  capital  mobility  is  generally  viewed  to  be  advantageous  to  the  process  of \neconomic development. Capital flows to emerging market economies have eased the \ndomestic savings constraint, which in turn has increased investment, thereby boosting \neconomic growth. To the extent that real returns to marginal investment are lower in \ncapital-rich countries than those in capital-scarce countries, the movement of capital \nfrom developed economies to emerging market economies improves the efficiency of \nworld resource allocation (Devlin, Ffrench-Davis and Griffith-Jones, 1995). \nInstead of raising the investment rate indirectly by providing more resources, capital \nflows may do so directly in the form of FDI. This type of inflow usually brings a range of \n 5", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \ndynamic  benefits  such  as  technology,  improved  management  practices  and  greater \naccess to international markets. \nThe availability of international capital also provides an economy the ability to smooth \nexpenditures especially in the advent of adverse exogenous shocks. Meanwhile, an \nopen capital account for both developed and emerging market economies allows for \ngreater portfolio diversification and better management of risk on the part of investors. \nThis is one of the more common arguments at the microeconomic level for capital \naccount liberalization (Devlin et al., 1995). \nDrawbacks of Greater Capital Mobility \nThe Asian financial crisis was a painful reminder of the risks associated with more open \ncapital  accounts.  Foreign  capital  flows  may  cause  imbalances  that  threaten \nmacroeconomic stability. This situation becomes likely if the absorptive capacity of the \neconomy falls below the level of the capital inflows. Such a disparity arises because of \npolicy arbitrage, where capital flows are attracted by the sound fundamentals of an \neconomy causing financial markets to allocate too much or too little capital to some \nrecipients at a given moment (Guitian, 1998). \nIf  an  economy  has  a  flexible  exchange  rate  regime,  capital  inflows  will  lead  to  an \nappreciation of the nominal and real exchange rates. This will have an adverse impact \non the competitiveness of exports and import-substituting industries and result in a \ndeterioration of the current account balance. The resource allocation effects of a real \nexchange  rate  appreciation  may  also  spawn  asset  price  bubbles  and  rapid  credit \nexpansion that could jeopardize the stability of the financial system. \nIn a fixed-exchange rate regime, capital inflows lead to a real exchange rate appreciation \nvia inflationary pressure brought about by the increase in money supply and domestic \ncredit. However, a fixed-exchange rate regime is more vulnerable when there is a net \ncapital  outflow.  Unless  it  has  adequate  foreign  exchange  reserves,  the  monetary \nauthority would have to raise interest rates to protect the peg. The likely outcome would \nbe an economic recession. \nMany factors could also undermine the efficacy of the capital inflows. The host economy \nmay experience a mere substitution of domestic savings by foreign savings, which would \nonly facilitate a consumption boom. In order to avoid this situation, a relatively high \nsaving rate must be attained in order to generate a trade surplus that will be used to \nservice the foreign debt incurred. But even if this saving rate is attained, an insufficient \namount  of  investment  may  be  channeled  to  the  tradable  goods  sector  (most  likely \nbecause  of  the  appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate),  which  would  reduce  the \nconvertibility of the surplus to foreign currency needed to service the foreign debt. Some \nanalysts  have  argued  that  even  if  capital  inflows  are  channeled  completely  to \ninvestment, the resulting improvement in the growth rate is only short-term in nature \nunless it is accompanied by a significant improvement in the economy\u2019s technology \n(Reisen, 1998). \nSince  capital  account  inflows  inherently  entail  financial  transactions,  they  are  also \nsusceptible to market imperfections associated with asymmetric information and moral \nhazard. These microeconomic distortions normally result in an inappropriate assessment \nof risk exposure and cause over-borrowing, making the financial system vulnerable to \n 6", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nexogenous shocks. The problem becomes particularly acute when banks are the main \nintermediaries  of  capital  flows.  The  situation  is  even  more  precarious  in  emerging \nmarkets where the risk-management practices of the private sector are underdeveloped, \nthe capacity of regulators to supervise the financial sector are limited, and the financial \nmarkets are thin. \nAnother potential microeconomic distortion arises from the real sector where aspects \nsuch as imperfect competition, externalities or wage rigidity, may result in inappropriate \nprivate sector adjustment even if the financial sector is functioning well (Fernandez-Arias \nand Montiel, 1996). Such static distortions may lead to the choice of a wrong technology \nand access to foreign capital will magnify the problem (Calvo et al., 1994). Meanwhile, in \nthe event of a sudden capital outflow, these distortions would induce exchange rate \novershooting, making the economic adjustment more difficult. \nSome Empirical Evidence \nDespite the theoretical and intuitive arguments in favor of greater capital mobility, some \nstudies have questioned the benefits of capital flows on empirical grounds. In one study, \nan indicator of capital account liberalization was included as an explanatory variable for \neconomic growth (Rodrik, 1998). The conclusion reached was that the data provided no \nevidence that countries without capital controls have grown faster, invested more, or \nexperienced lower inflation. \nA more recent study used capital flows directly as an explanatory variable (Levine and \nCarkovic, 1999). The authors applied more sophisticated econometric techniques to \naccount for simultaneity, country-specific effects and the inclusion of lagged dependent \nvariables as regressors. The study found that the exogenous components of FDI flows \nand portfolio flows did not exert a positive influence on economic growth. The conclusion \nis consistent with microeconomic studies that generally suggest that FDI does not boost \neconomic growth primarily because of the absence of evidence of positive spillovers \nrunning from foreign-owned to domestic-owned firms.  \nThe study of Levine and Carkovic also looked at the effect of capital flows on productivity \ngrowth, which is an important determinant of the variation in long-term growth across \neconomies. This data, too, did not show evidence of a link. However, a separate study \nby Levine (1999) presented evidence that the entry of foreign banks\u2014a form of direct \ninvestment\u2014enhanced  the  efficiency  of  the  domestic  financial  system.  Meanwhile, \ninternational portfolio equity flows were shown to have enhanced domestic stock market \nliquidity.  Other  studies  have  confirmed  the  positive  effects  of  both  financial  system \nefficiency and stock market liquidity on productivity and economic growth. Hence, the \nstudy of Levine provided evidence of a transmission mechanism between foreign capital \nflows, on the one hand, and economic growth, on the other. \nThe study of Rodrik was criticized by Eichengreen (1998) as being biased. Variables that \nare negatively associated with growth but positively associated with the decision to open \nthe capital account were inadvertently omitted. The study of Levine and Carkovic and \nthe study of Levine indicate that the evidence on the impact of capital flows is generally \nmixed. Finally, it is widely accepted by economic analysts that the spectacular growth of \nseveral East Asian economies (e.g. Singapore and People\u2019s Republic of China) was due \nin no small measure to FDI. \n 7", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nAn analysis of the macroeconomic impact of capital flows can determine whether the \naforementioned drawbacks have materialized. In one study, key economic variables for \nselected Asian and Latin American economies were monitored using data from 1988\u2013\n1994 (Calvo, Leiderman and Reinhart, 1996). Some stylized facts were documented \nfrom these observations. First, a substantial portion of the surge in capital inflows was \nchanneled to accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. Second, in most countries the \ncapital inflows were associated with widening current account deficits. Third, there was a \nrise in consumption spending, which was usually driven by rising imports of durable \ngoods. Fourth, in almost all countries examined, there was rapid growth in the money \nsupply  both  in  nominal  and  real  terms.  Fifth,  the  surge  in  portfolio  flows  was \naccompanied by sharp increases in stock and real estate prices. Lastly, the evidence on \nthe real exchange rate presents a mixed picture. The data indicate that real exchange \nrate appreciation was more prevalent in Latin America than in Asia. \nThe stylized facts suggest that the disadvantages associated with capital flows (e.g. \nincreased consumption and real exchange rate appreciation) are likely outcomes. Given \nthe potential benefits of capital flows, it is thus imperative for policymakers to adopt \nmeasures that minimize their costs. Strategies for capital flow management can be \ndeveloped at the domestic, regional and international levels. Policy options that exist in \nthe domestic front can further be classified into macroeconomic and microeconomic \nresponses. \nIII.  CAPITAL INFLOWS INTO THE PHILIPPINES: 1987\u20132007 \nTrends and Composition \nNet capital flows to the Philippines have been fairly steady from 1989\u20131997, except for a \nblip in 1996 when net capital flows jumped to $14.7 billion (Table 2). FDI was a constant \ncontributor although the level was much lower compared with neighboring countries with \na similar level of development, i.e. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia (Table 3). Portfolio \ninvestment  surged  in  1995  and  1996  following  the  global  trend  during  this  period. \nMeanwhile, transactions classified as \u201cother investments\u201d were the largest source of \nflows during this period, and this category largely explains the jump in capital inflows in \n1996. Data indicate that this was attributable mainly to the increase in net foreign assets \nof commercial banks. \nBetween 1998 and 2007, which is the period after the East Asian financial crisis, net \ncapital flows to the Philippines fell sharply (Table 4). The only exceptions were in 1999 \nwhen there was a fairly large amount of foreign investment in debt securities, and in \n2005 when there was a surge in portfolio investment. In 1999, there was an increase in \nborrowers availing themselves of medium and long-term loans largely in response to the \nadverse effects of the crisis. The category \u201cother investments\u201d also increased sharply in \n2005 although this was followed by a turnaround in 2006. \nDespite  the  slowdown  in  capital  inflows  after  the  crisis,  foreign  exchange  inflows \nremained strong. This was largely due to remittances of Filipinos working abroad, which \nare the main component of current transfers. Net current transfers in 2006 amounted to \n$13.2  billion  which  was  11.3%  of  GDP  (Table  4).  Given  the  dominance  of  current \ntransfers, the analysis in this study should not be limited to capital flows but extended to \ncover inflows of foreign exchange. Historical comparison should be approached with \ncaution, however, since adjustments to Philippine BOP data have been applied only \n 8", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nfrom 1999 to the present. While capital account data are still loosely comparable, the \nsame is not true for data on current transfers. \nAs a percentage of GDP, there was a jump in current transfers in 2001. This level \nincreased steadily until 2006. This implies that while remittances are relatively high, it \nwould be difficult to attribute the sharp rise in the peso\u2019s value in 2006\u20132007 to a \u201csurge\u201d \nin remittances. This issue will be discussed in more detail in Section IV. \nCapital inflows to the Philippines are largely due to \u201cpush\u201d factors. The ebb and flow \ngenerally follow global patterns, particularly in the case of portfolio flows. If \u201cpull\u201d factors \nwere dominant, FDI would have been much higher. Table 1 indicates a sharp rise in FDI \nflows to developing countries from 2004 to 2006. However, the direct investments of \nnon-residents in the Philippines amounted to $2,086 million in 2006, which ranks only \nsixth  among ASEAN member countries in absolute terms and eighth  as a ratio GDP, \nand is even lower than the peak of $2,287 million in 1998 (Table 3 and Table 4). \nMeanwhile, remittances respond to both pull and push factors. Studies have shown that \nremittances are largely pro-cyclical and driven by investment motives (Tua\u00f1o-Amador et \nal., 2007). Hence, a more conducive business environment will attract more remittances. \nThe peso appreciation could also be considered a pull factor, wherein larger dollar \nremittances are required to sustain a specific standard of living. On the other hand, the \nmain push factor would be more employment opportunities and higher remuneration \nabroad. In this context, it should be noted that there has been an increase in demand for \noverseas workers particularly for nurses and caregivers. \nImpact on the Macroeconomy: Econometric Results \nAs discussed in Section II, large inflows of capital can lead to accumulation of reserves, \nreal appreciation of the local currency, expansion in domestic liquidity, increase in the \nprice  level,  and  reduction  in  the  domestic  interest  rate,  which,  in  turn,  affect \nconsumption, investment and government spending. On the other hand, some of these \nvariables  constitute  the  host  of  \u201cpull\u201d  factors  that  determine  capital  flows\u2014such  as \nimproved macroeconomic performance and exchange rate regime\u2014that attract investor \nconfidence and encourage capital inflows. Hence, the apparent endogeneity of capital \ninflows and other macroeconomic variables, i.e. the tendency to appear in both the left \nand  right  side  of  the  equation,  warrants  the  use  of  a  non-structural  multi-equation \napproach to analyze the impact of inflows of capital on the macroeconomy. Possible \nmethodologies toward this end include estimation through a vector autoregression (VAR) \nmodel in case of absence of cointegration relationship among the chosen variables or a \nvector  error  correction  model  (VECM)  in  case  such  relationship  exists  among  the \nvariables.  \nBefore proceeding with the choice of estimation methodology, the time series properties \nof the variables were first checked since estimations of the nonstationary series are \nknown to be spurious. Given the expected impact of capital inflows in the economy, as \ndiscussed above, we include, apart from the measure of capital  inflows\u2014using net \ncapital and financial account of the Balance of Payments\u2014reserves, 91-day Treasury \n(T-bill) rate, real effective exchange rate (REER), M3, consumption, investment and \ngovernment expenditures in the set of variables. The results of the augmented Dickey-\nFuller tests (ADF) indicate that all the variables are stationary in levels except for M3 and \nconsumption which are integrated of order two. \n 9", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThe nonstationarity of M3 and consumption implies that it is legitimate to search for a \ncointegration relationship among the variables. In performing cointegration tests using \nthe approach of Johansen (1991), we consider the foregoing set of macroeconomic \nvariables. Results of the Johansen cointegration tests provide evidence that a unique \ncointegrating vector exists among the abovementioned set of variables. The existence of \ncointegration relationship among the four groupings of variables warrants the use of a \nVECM, in lieu of an unrestricted VAR.2  \nThe impulse response functions (IRF) derived from the various versions of the VECM \ncould provide indications of the impact of capital flows on the macroeconomic variables \nincluded in the groupings. However, IRF results using Cholesky decomposition could be \nsensitive to the ordering of the variables in VECM. Since our analysis focuses on the \nimpact of capital flows on the macroeconomy, the measure of capital flows is placed first \nin the ordering. The surge of capital flows could lead to accumulation of reserves so the \nreserves are placed second in the ordering. Meanwhile, the central bank is expected to \nrespond to capital inflow shocks using its policy instruments such as the policy rate \nwhich could, in turn, influence market rates (Berument and Dincer, 2004). Hence, the 91-\nday T-bill rate enters the VECM as the third variable. Moreover, exchange rates could \nrespond to the increase in the market rates via the interest parity condition.  \nIn  addition,  exchange  rates  could  react  to  capital  inflows  because  the  latter  could \nincrease reserves, as argued above, and the money supply as well. Therefore, the real \nexchange rate and M3 follow the 91-day T-bill rate. Meanwhile, the resulting expansion \nin money supply could lead to an increase in the price level, hence, the consumer price \nindex (CPI) is placed next. Finally, other variables in the real and fiscal sectors react to \nchanges in the market rate and the real exchange rate so that consumption, investment \nand government expenditures are placed at the end of the ordering. Although frowned \nupon by practitioners, a dummy variable was added to temper the impact of the 1997 \nfinancial crisis. \nIRF results from the VECM indicate that capital inflows, in aggregate, could lead to an \nincrease in reserves, with the impact reaching its highest magnitude in the second \nquarter after the capital inflow shock (Figure 3). However, the impact of a positive capital \nflow on the 91-day T-bill rate appears insignificant. Meanwhile, capital inflows tend to \nlead to a real appreciation of the peso against the basket of major trading partners\u2019 \n(MTP) currencies. Nevertheless, the positive impact of the capital inflow shock seems to \ndissipate in the second quarter after the shock so that the real exchange rate reverts to \nits pre-shock value in the seventh quarter but appears to appreciate again thereafter. \nThe broadly positive results from the impulse response functions relating to M3 and CPI \nindicate the capital inflows could lead to an expansion in domestic liquidity and an \nincrease in inflation. Meanwhile, the impact of capital flows on consumption, investment \nand government expenditure appear insignificant.  \nThe estimated VECM was likewise utilized to generate IRFs resulting from a positive \nshock  to  reserves.  An  interesting  result  is  that  the  reserves  shock  leads  to  a  real \nappreciation of the peso against the basket of MTP currencies, which appears to be \n                                                 \n2 The empirical results are available upon request. The four groupings refer to the types of capital flows used \nin the estimation. One is a combination of FDI and portfolio investment. The second and third are FDI and \nportfolio investment, respectively. And the fourth is remittances. \n 10", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \ncounterintuitive given the precautionary nature of reserves in the Philippine economy \n(Figure 4). Reference to this result will be made in Section VI. \nDifferent versions of the VECM were likewise estimated with the aggregate capital flows \nvariable replaced by its direct investments and portfolio investments components and by \ncurrent transfers as well. IRFs derived from a positive shock in direct and portfolio \ninvestments  are  either  insignificant  or  counterintuitive.3 This  is  due  perhaps  to  the \nvolatility of direct and portfolio investments over the 1989 Q1 to 2007 Q2 sample period \nwith coefficient of variation of 177.9 and 307.0, respectively. Meanwhile, results from the \nVECM using the current transfers variable, which has a coefficient of variation of 94.3, \nindicate that a positive shock to current transfers leads to a rise in the level of reserves, \nthe  91-day  T-bill  rate,  CPI  and  government  expenditure  (Figure  5).  Generally \ninsignificant results were derived from IRFs relating to the real exchange rate, M3, \nconsumption and investment.4 Overall, capital flows and current transfers seem to have \nminimal impact on the real sector. This is likely because the monetary authority may \nhave sterilized the impact or exchange rate movements may have diluted any potential \nreal effects. \n                                                 \n3 Tables and results are omitted here but are available upon request. \n4 The results are likely to change, particularly for consumption and REER, if a consistent series for current \ntransfers is obtained. \n 11", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T.

IMPACT OF CAPITAL INFLOWS IN THE PHILIPPINES \nThe drawbacks of capital inflows\u2014which can be extended to foreign exchange inflows in \ngeneral\u2014were  discussed  in  Section  II.  These  include  (i)  imbalances  that  threaten \nmacroeconomic stability become likely if the absorptive capacity of the economy falls \nbelow the level of the foreign exchange inflows; (ii) a rapid appreciation of the nominal \nand real exchange rates if the economy has a flexible exchange regime; a substitution of \ndomestic savings by foreign savings, which would only facilitate a consumption boom; \n(iii) microeconomic distortions such as asymmetric information that normally result in an \ninappropriate  assessment  of  risk  exposure  and  cause  over-borrowing;  and  (iv) \ndistortions  from  the  real  sector  where  aspects  such  as  imperfect  competition, \nexternalities or wage rigidity, may result in inappropriate private sector adjustment such \nas wrong choice of technology even if the financial sector is functioning well. Meanwhile, \nin the event of a sudden capital outflow, these distortions would induce exchange rate \novershooting, making the economic adjustment more difficult. \n 14", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThis section looks at the experience of the Philippines from 1987\u20132007 and determines \nwhether the possible adverse outcomes of surges of foreign exchange inflows were \nrealized. The analysis refers to the econometric results in the previous section when \nrelevant. Basic macroeconomic indicators of the Philippines are shown in Table 5. This \ninvestigation will help in the analysis of the impact of foreign exchange inflows on the \neconomy and also in the evaluation of selected policy responses. \nReal Sector \nKnowledge of the range of impacts of current transfers and capital flows on the real \nsector will aid policymakers in crafting measures that will optimize their use. The results \nof the VAR analysis indicate that foreign exchange flows have limited impact on the real \nsector.  The  negligible  impact  on  investment  is  not  unexpected.  The  level  of  FDI \ninvestment in the Philippines has been historically low, reaching a maximum of 3.4% in \n1998, which can even be considered an abnormal year. Moreover, the literature review \npointed out that the beneficial impact of FDI is dependent on a significant improvement \nin the economy\u2019s technology (Reisen, 1998) and some microeconomic studies generally \nsuggest that FDI does not boost economic growth primarily because of the absence of \nevidence of positive  spillovers running from foreign-owned to domestic-owned firms \n(Levine and Carkovic, 1999). A later study indicated that in several Southeast Asian \neconomies including the Philippines, FDI had only direct effects while spillover effects in \nterms of technology transfer were minimal (Mirza and Giroud, 2004). \nHowever, the negligible impact of current transfers on investment and consumption is \nnot consistent with earlier studies. Using a seemingly unrelated regression technique, \nLamberte  (1995)  finds  remittances  to  be  a  significant  determinant  of  personal \nconsumption but not of investment. A modified form of his regressions was estimated \nusing data from 1999\u20132006 (Table 6). The results show that remittances significantly \naffect both investment and personal consumption, but both FDI and portfolio investment \nare insignificant. The reason for the difference with Lamberte\u2019s study in terms of the \nimpact  on  investment  may  be  the  size  of  the  remittances  and  the  behavior  of \nhouseholds.  The  latter  may  have  become  sophisticated  over  time  in  managing \nremittances, thereby using them more productively. \nA  study  based  on  the  2003  Family  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  (FIES)  finds \nevidence that households receiving remittances tend to spend more conspicuously in \nterms of consumer items but also invest more on education, housing, medical care and \ndurable  goods  (Tabuga,  2007).  The  study  shows  no  clear  relationship  between \nremittances and tobacco and alcohol. Unfortunately, FIES data do not include capital \noutlays, hence the impact on investment was not considered. \nMeanwhile, a study by Yang (2005) also used FIES data but focuses on the impact of \nexchange  rate  shocks  on  migrant  income  on  a  range  of  investment  outcomes  in \nPhilippine households such as child schooling, child labor, and entrepreneurial activity. \nHowever,  the  latter  does  not  cover  capital  outlays.  The  study  finds  that  favorable \nexchange  rate  movements\u2014from  the  perspective  of  the  overseas  worker\u2014lead  to \ngreater child schooling, reduced child labor, and increased educational expenditure in \nPhilippine households. Favorable exchange rate shocks also lead to differentially more \nhours worked in self-employment, and to differential entry into relatively capital-intensive \nenterprises by households receiving remittances. \n 15", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThe empirical results in Table 6 are consistent with the BSP study (Tua\u00f1o-Amador et al., \n2007) that shows remittances to be pro-cyclical and dominated by investment motives. \nThe analysis indicates that remittances have the potential to be a more robust source of \nsustainable economic growth if they are channeled to productive investments. More \nmicro-level studies should be conducted to determine the factors that can bring this \nabout.  What  would  be  suspect,  though,  is  the  negligible  impact  of  remittances  on \nconsumption based on the VAR analysis. This can be considered inconclusive until such \ntime that a consistent data series on current transfers will be extended to years prior to \n1999. \nWhat is driving the exchange rate? \nThe most controversial aspect of foreign exchange inflows, arguably, has been the sharp \nappreciation of many Asian currencies in nominal and real terms from 2004 up to the \npresent (Table 7 and Figure 1).5 The peso started appreciating sharply vis-\u00e0-vis the US \ndollar only in December 2005 and even then it was the Asian currency with the most \nrapid appreciation during the period 2003\u201307 (Table 7). As a matter of fact, the peso had \nthe fastest nominal appreciation in 2007. Based on the literature review and econometric \nevidence, the knee-jerk reaction would attribute this phenomenon to a surge in foreign \nexchange inflows. \nCloser scrutiny of the data indicates, however, that foreign exchange inflows may have a \nless prominent role in the appreciation of Asian currencies than assumed. Data in Table \n8 show the ratio of balance-of-payments components to GDP during the period 2004\u201306 \nfor various Asian countries. There is no indication of a surge in current transfers among \nthem except for the Philippines. However, Singapore and Malaysia do have substantial \ncurrent account surpluses but the Singapore dollar and ringgit have significantly lower \nrates of appreciation. \nMeanwhile, the balance in the capital and financial accounts were fairly moderate except \nfor relatively large surpluses in the Philippines and Thailand in 2005. Moreover, as \nindicated  in  the  earlier  section,  there  has  been  no  jump  in  remittances  into  the \nPhilippines compared to its historical trend and even then the resulting current account \nsurplus was much lower than that of Malaysia and Singapore. Hence, while important, it \nwould be incorrect to cite a surge in foreign exchange inflows as the primary cause of \nthe peso\u2019s recent sharp appreciation.  \nInstead, the following factors can be considered in the context of the Philippines: \n1.  At the \u201clowest\u201d points of the various regional currencies, the peso experienced \nthe second largest depreciation in both nominal and real terms. Hence it is but \nnatural to expect it to have a faster appreciation during the recovery period after \nthe crisis. This argument, however, is tempered by the experience of Indonesia, \nwhich had the sharpest depreciation as a result of the crisis, yet experienced a \nnet nominal depreciation of the rupiah during the period 2003\u201307. \n                                                 \n5 An empirical study on the effects of the peso appreciation is beyond the scope of this paper. Tua\u00f1o-\nAmador, et al. (2007) allude to evidence of Dutch Disease in the Philippines, which is also manifest in the \ndeceleration of the manufacturing sector simultaneously with the rapid growth of GDP. Manufacturing \nsector growth fell to 3.3% in 2007 from 4.6% a year before whereas GDP growth surged to 7.3% in 2007 \ncompared to 5.4% in 2006. However, a more important undertaking would be to determine whether the \npeso is overvalued at the current exchange rate. \n 16", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \n2.  Instead of a drawn out process, the peso\u2019s recovery was bunched up over the \nperiod December 2005 to the present. This is largely explained by the prevailing \nfiscal  difficulties  up  to  that  time.  The  Philippine  government  implemented \nstringent and decisive fiscal reforms beginning in 2005 and their success boosted \ninvestor confidence which was reflected in  the peso\u2019s  strong appreciation in \n2006\u201307. \n3.  Compared to other central banks in the region, the BSP did not intervene as \nmuch in terms of accumulating foreign exchange reserves. Hence it should be \nexpected that the peso\u2019s appreciation should be faster. This can be gleaned from \nFigure 2 which is Graph 2 of Ho and McCauley (2007). The ratio of the change in \nforeign exchange reserves to GDP was extended to October 2007 (Figure 2A) \nand while the Philippines moved up in rankings, the extent of intervention was \nstill comparable to the past five years. However, this argument is also tempered \nby Indonesia\u2019s experience where the degree of intervention was even lower. \n4.  A prevailing current account surplus since 2003 has also pushed up the peso\u2019s \nvalue.  From  a  current  account  deficit  equal  to  5.3%  of  GDP  in  1998,  the \nPhilippine economy recorded a surplus of 4.5% of GDP in 2006 and 4.4% in \n2007 (Table 5). This is largely due to a fall in the investment rate and reflected in \na drop in the ratio of imports to GDP from 63% in 1997 to only 45.3% in 2007 \n(Table 5). The issue of the fall in the investment rate and its relation to the \naccumulation of reserves will be discussed in Section VI. \nRather than surges in foreign exchange inflows, the strength of Asian currencies vis-\u00e0-\nvis the US dollar is largely attributable to the latter\u2019s overall weakness. Data in Table 7 \nshow that the US dollar depreciated by 38% against the euro during the period 2003\u201307. \nThis is about 10 percentage points higher than the peso\u2019s appreciation against the \ndollar. However, the concept of \u201cdollar weakness\u201d has to be translated into foreign \nexchange flows that affect the region\u2019s exchange rates. One possible explanation relates \nto the concepts of \u201cdollarization\u201d and \u201cde-dollarization.\u201d \nDollarization and De-Dollarization \nDollar denominated assets held by residents has been increasing over time consistent \nwith the liberalization of the economy. The relative magnitude of these assets reflects \nthe degree of dollarization, which increased between 1990 and 2000 following the surge \nof  foreign  exchange  inflows  (Table  9).  Using  the  IMF  standard,  an  economy  is \nconsidered highly dollarized if the ratio of foreign currency deposits (FCDs) to money \nsupply is greater than 30%. The data show that the Philippines was on its way to \nbecoming a highly dollarized economy, but, after reaching 41% in 2000, the ratio fell to \n29.9% in 2006 and 26.4% in October 2007. \nThe trend towards de-dollarization can be partly explained by the general decline in \ncapital inflows after the crisis. However, at a certain point the fall in the FCD/M3 ratio is \ndriven largely by the peso appreciation. In this context, making FCD/M3 an indicator of \nde-dollarization becomes an exercise in tautology. Data show that in 2006 and 2007 \nthere was a jump in withdrawals in FCDs (Table 9), which is a more reliable indicator of \nde-dollarization. The jump can be attributed to expectations of a peso appreciation which \nbecome self-fulfilling. Another indication of de-dollarization is the ratio of FCDs to foreign \nexchange reserves, which has fallen sharply between 2004 and 2007. The logic is that \n 17", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nperceptions of weakness in the US dollar has prompted economic agents to withdraw \nfrom  their  FCDs  and  convert  their  dollar  holdings  to  pesos  in  anticipation  of  its \nappreciation. This action in itself has contributed to the peso\u2019s appreciation. \nStock Prices \nForeign portfolio investment has been the main driver of the local stock market. Hence, it \nis not surprising that the surge in stock prices since 2003 has been accompanied by the \nresurgence of non-residents\u2019 investment in equity securities (Table 4 and Figure 6). The \nresults of the VECM analysis and regressions in Table 6 indicate, however, that portfolio \nflows have had an insignificant impact on investment and consumption. \nV.  POLICY RESPONSES \nThe role of policymakers is to implement measures that will mitigate the adverse impact \nof foreign exchange inflows. This section provides an inventory of such measures with \nemphasis on the role of the BSP. \n1987\u20131997 \nThe surge in the capital account that lasted between 1993 and 1997 led to a persistent \nappreciation of the peso, in nominal terms between October 1993 and November 1994, \nand in real terms between April 1995 and June 1997 (see Figure 1 and Figure 6). \nInflation, interest rates and money supply growth were generally higher prior to the crisis \n(Table 5). In response, the government implemented measures that can be classified \ninto four categories: reducing the supply of foreign exchange inflows; increasing the \ndemand for foreign exchange; strengthening prudential regulations; and reducing the \ncost of production for exporters. \nTo reduce the supply of foreign exchange in the country, the government cut back on its \nrequests for loan rescheduling under the Paris debt program. Between 1994 and 1997, \nthe government pre-paid a total of $1.41 billion of external debt. Meanwhile, the BSP \nlifted the restriction on the repatriation of foreign investments made under the debt-to-\nequity  conversion  program,  as  well  as  on  the  remittance  of  dividends,  profits  and \nearnings that are derived from such investments. It also increased the allowable outward \ninvestments that can be sourced from the banking system from $1 million to $6 million \nper investor per year. \nTo  increase  the  demand  for  foreign  exchange,  the  BSP  intervened  in  the  foreign \nexchange  market  by  buying  dollars.  In  some  cases  the  BSP  engaged  in  sterilized \nintervention by buying dollars in the market while concurrently engaged in mopping up \noperations by selling government securities in its portfolio to prevent the money supply \nfrom increasing. For its part, the national government advanced the phasedown of the \nforward exchange cover extended to oil firms to add to demand for foreign exchange. \nThe BSP instituted several measures to reduce the costs of production to exporters to \nmaintain their competitiveness. Direct and indirect exporters were allowed access to \nforeign currency loans offered by foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs). This led to \nlarge  savings  in  interest  payments  on  the  part  of  exporters  since  interest  rate \ndifferentials between FCDU loans and peso denominated loans from commercial banks \nat that time ranged from 5.5\u20137 percentage points. \n 18", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nMonetary Board Resolution No. 1197 dated December 1, 1994 established an Exporters \nDollar Facility (EDF), and the BSP subsequently issued Circular No. 57 dated December \n19, 1994. Under Circular No. 57, qualified banks could avail themselves of the EDF \nagainst the eligible dollar-denominated loans of their exporter-borrowers (both direct and \nindirect),  including  service  exporters  who  were  engaged  in  rendering  technical, \nprofessional, and other services. On April 27, 1999, the BSP issued Circular No. 199 \nwhereby the EDF was renamed Exporters Dollar and Yen Rediscount Facility (EDYRF). \nQualified  banks  could  avail  themselves  of  the  EDYRF  against  the  eligible  dollar-\ndenominated or yen-denominated loans of their exporter-borrowers. \nThe BSP also added more loanable funds to the system by gradually reducing the \nreserve requirement on all deposit liabilities from 24% in January 1993 to 17% in August \n1994. This contributed to the decline in domestic interest rates. \nTo prevent banks from unduly speculating in the foreign exchange markets, the BSP \nreduced the oversold position of banks from 15% of its unimpaired capital to 5%. To \nweed out the speculative component of portfolio investment, the BSP imposed a prior \napproval requirement on all forward transactions with nonresidents. \n1998\u20132007 \nAfter the crisis, the BSP embarked on an \u201caggressive and wide-ranging reform process\u201d \nof the domestic financial system (Tetangco, 2005). One of the objectives was to increase \nthe resilience of the domestic financial to volatility of capital flows and enable it to \nallocate capital flows more efficiently. The BSP \u201cadopted changes in the regulatory and \nsupervisory framework to be able to effectively meet the demands and challenges of \nglobally integrated financial markets and the growing sophistication of financial products \nand services. This process of reform is geared towards greater commitment to risk \nmanagement, strengthening of the regulatory framework and supervision techniques, \npromotion of transparency and good corporate governance, and putting in place the \nnecessary  infrastructure  requirements.  The  BSP,  working  closely  with  the  banking \nsector, has made important progress on these fronts.\u201d6 \nMeasures to improve monitoring and transparency of capital flows were also introduced. \nThe Philippines started subscribing to the IMF\u2019s Special Data Dissemination Standards \n(SDDS) in 1996. By January 2001, the Philippines was in full compliance with the SDDS \nin  the  dissemination  of  the  relevant  data  through  the  internet  in  accordance  with \nprescribed timeliness and frequency. \nTo  facilitate  the  adoption  of  international  norms,  the  Philippines  has  also  been \nparticipating in the formulation of Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes \n(ROSCs). These reports assess the extent to which the Philippines conforms to various \nkey international standards and codes that are relevant to the effective functioning of its \neconomic and financial system. Resulting gains in transparency are expected to enable \nmarket participants to formulate better analysis, forecasts and investment decisions, \nthus  reducing  uncertainty  and  helping  investors  price  risk  on  a  sounder  basis.  To \ncomplement the activities under ROSCs, the Philippines has also been participating in \nthe IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which is aimed at \n                                                 \n6 Quoted from Tetangco (2005), pages 253-254. The details of the reforms are contained in the same paper. \n 19", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the strengths, risks and vulnerabilities of the \nfinancial system. \nApart from its effort at reforming the domestic financial system, the BSP also followed \nmeasures similar to those in 1987\u20131997, particularly reducing the supply of foreign \nexchange inflows and increasing the demand for foreign exchange. The BSP's main \napproach has been to liberalize private sector capital outflows in order to reduce the \ninflows and reserve accumulation. This involved the following:7  \n1.  Encouraging  investments  by  overseas  Filipinos,  initially  by  facilitating \nremittances. \n\u2022  Promoting transparency and competition in remittances through Circular no. 534 \n(remittance charges disclosure).  \n\u2022  Improving payment and settlement systems by approving setting up of local \nbank\u2019s  remittance  centers  and  branches  abroad,  authorizing  rural  banks  to \naccept  FCDs,  approving  interconnection  of  three  (3)  ATM  networks,  and \napproving use of new technologies as mode of remittance (e.g. internet and \nSMS).  \n\u2022  Promoting financial literacy campaigns among OFs/families.  \n2.  Encouraging  private  sector  capital  outflows  through  further  liberalization  of \nforeign exchange transactions:  \n\u2022  Phase  1:  BSP  Circular  561  which  involves  a  symmetrical  limit  of  20%  of \nunimpaired  capital  (Oversold/Overbought  positions)  and  increased  limit  of \noutward investment by Philippine residents to $12 million/year; and BSP Circular \n565 allowing thrift banks to invest in FCD debt instruments. \n\u2022  Phase 2: Policy reforms contemplated under this area cover the expanded use of \nforeign  exchange  swaps;  transactions  in  which  FCDUs  of  thrift  banks/rural \nbanks/cooperatives  may  engage;  increase  in  the  allowed  foreign  exchange \npurchases by residents from banks for non-trade current account purposes and \noutward  investments;  and  streamlining  of  documentation  and  reporting \nrequirements  to  further  facilitate  the  purchase  of  foreign  exchange  from  the \nbanking system for legitimate trade and non-trade transactions. \n3.  On other capital account transactions, the allowable outward investments by \nresidents without prior BSP approval and registration was increased from US$6 \nmillion per investor per year to US$12 million. For purposes of purchasing foreign \nexchange  from  banks,  outward  investments  will  now  include  residents\u2019 \ninvestments  in  foreign  currency-denominated  bonds  issued  by  the  National \nGovernment and other Philippine entities. The increase in the allowable limit on \noutward investments is expected to allow greater portfolio and risk diversification \nand facilitate integration with global markets. \n4.  On  current  account  transactions,  the  limit  on  allowable  foreign  exchange \npurchases by residents from banks to cover payments to foreign beneficiaries for \nnon-trade purposes (excluding those related to foreign loans/foreign currency \nloans and foreign investments) without supporting documents was  increased \n                                                 \n7 Information was sourced from the BSP. \n 20", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nfrom  US$5,000  to  US$10,000.  Furthermore,  the  \u201cno-splitting\u201d  restriction  and \nnotarization requirement for applications to purchase foreign exchange were also \nlifted. These measures are expected to facilitate the rising demand by residents \nfor foreign exchange to service non-trade transactions (such as education of \ndependents abroad, medical care and payment of service fees) which have risen \nas a result of globalization. Lower transaction costs for bank clients, including \nretail customers, are expected as a result. While the documentary requirements \nare being relaxed, these transactions will continue to be covered by existing \nprovisions under the Anti-Money Laundering regulations. \n5.  There have also been initiatives aimed at improving the BSP\u2019s ability to offset the \neffects  of  inflows  through  proposals  to  amend  the  BSP  Charter,  the  most \nimportant of which is the proposal to allow the BSP to issue its own instruments \nlike  other  central  banks.  The  BSP  has  also  made  representations  with  the \nNational  Government  on  its  subscription  to  the  P40  billion  remaining \ncapitalization of the BSP.  \nA Closer Look at BSP Intervention \nDuring the period 1998\u20132007, the BSP continued to intervene in the foreign exchange \nmarket. The latter involves the purchase of foreign currency with domestic currency, \nwhich changes the monetary liabilities of the monetary authority, and thus the monetary \nstance. Typically, intervention aims at the following (IMF, 2007b): a) Influencing the level \nof the exchange rate; b) Dampening exchange rate changes; c) Smoothing exchange \nrate flexibility; and d) Accumulating reserves. \nWhile not as heavy as in other countries (Figure 2), based on a calculated exchange \nmarket pressure (EMP) index, the intervention was heavier after the crisis (Figure 7 and \nFigure 8).8 The bars in the figure divide the exchange market pressure on the positive \naxis into the need to allow the currency to appreciate and a rise in reserves to prevent \nthe appreciation. A useful comparison is the behavior of EMP during the surge of capital \nflows in 1996 and the surge in 2005. \nIn 1996, the maximum value of EMP was only 1.3 (August), while in 2005 the maximum \nvalue was 4.7 (February), even reaching 9.1 in January 2006. The chart clearly shows \nthat positive changes in international reserves contributed substantially to exchange \nmarket pressure.  \nNot  only  has  the  BSP  intervened  more  heavily  after  the  crisis,  sterilization  has \napparently been more pronounced (Table 10). The sterilization coefficient for the period \n1998\u20132007 is much higher compared to the coefficient between 1987 and 1997.9 The \ncoefficient has also been steadily increasing, which can be observed by comparing the \n                                                 \n\u03c3\n8 The EMP is calculated as \u0394%er + \u0394%er \u0394res . The exchange rate is defined as $/peso, and %er \nt \u03c3 t\n\u0394res\nand res are the percentage month-on-month change of the exchange rate and international reserves, \nrespectively. The EMP normalizes the size of the intervention, therefore making comparisons across time \nvalid. \n9 The sterilization coefficient is the coefficient from a regression on the contribution of net domestic assets to \nreserve money growth on the contribution of net foreign assets to reserve money growth. \n 21", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nregressions for the period 2002.1\u20132004.12, which is the period when inflation targeting \nwas  initiated,  2005.1\u20132007.8,  which  covers  a  period  of  heavy  capital  inflows,  and \n1998.1\u20132007.8. \nAn important tool for sterilization beginning in 2006 was the special deposit account \n(SDA) facility. Established in 1998, SDA is BSP\u2019s alternative to open market operations. \nBanks can place funds with the BSP under the SDA facility which is subject to interest \nrates depending on the term of the placements. Interest rates have been generally \nhigher than those in the money or interbank markets. For example, when the SDA was \nfirst opened to state firms and banks\u2019 trust units in the second quarter of 2007, it offered \nas much as 8% for the three-month tenor while the overnight placements facility stood at \n7.5%. Data in Table 5 show that the 91-day Treasury Bill rate averaged only 5.3 percent \nin 2007.   \nData from 2004 onward show that the SDA was hardly used until 2006 (Figure 9). In \nApril 2006 the amount in the SDA jumped to P19.3 billion from just P2.5 billion in \nFebruary and P9.6 billion in March. Then in September 2006 the amount in the SDA \nfacility increased to P49.7 billion. \nIn May 2007, the BSP allowed banks\u2019 placements in the SDA to be an alternative way to \ncomply with the liquidity floor requirements for government deposits. Access to the SDA \nwas likewise widened to include trust units and state firms. According to some analysts, \nthis was done to mop up excess liquidity and maintain inflation within the target levels. In \nthat same month the SDA increased sharply to P222.9 billion from only P54.2 billion in \nApril, 2007. The amount in the SDA stood at P583.3 billion as of February, 2008. \nBecause of the surge in the size of the SDA, the BSP decided in March 2008 to \nimplement immediately the following refinements in the facility: (1) the closure of existing \nwindows for the two-, three-, and six-month tenors; and (2) the reduction of the interest \nrates on the remaining tenors.  There was concern that the SDA was siphoning off funds \nfrom investment activity. \nVI.  EVALUATION OF POLICY RESPONSES \nHas Intervention Worked? \nAs  described  earlier,  the  BSP  has  engaged  in  both  sterilized  and  unsterilized \nintervention. A simple correlation analysis indicates that intervention, as measured by \nthe percentage of international reserves, has limited impact on the exchange rate\u2019s level, \npercentage change, and volatility (Table 11).10 The results indicate that intervention had \na modicum of success in reducing exchange rate volatility in the Philippines between \n1993  and  1996.  Meanwhile,  intervention  prevented  a  rise  in  the  exchange  rate \n(measured in US$/peso) after the crisis, particularly during the period 2003\u20132007. In \nmany instances the results are counter-intuitive, i.e. the correlation coefficient is positive, \nsimilar to the result of the impulse response function that was presented in Section III \n(Figure 4). \n                                                 \n10 The  correlation  results  were  supported  by  regression  analysis  using  the  two-stage  least  squares \nprocedures applied by the IMF (2007b) as described in Box 3.2 \u201cThe Effectiveness of Intervention: \nAdditional Tests,\u201d page 39. \n 22", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThe empirical results differ from those reported by the IMF (2007b) for the Philippines. \nHowever, the IMF study does find limited evidence of systematic links between sterilized \nintervention and exchange rates in the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Republic of Korea, \nand Thailand. The general result is somewhat unexpected given the low degree of \nsubstitutability of emerging market assets and the large size of interventions relative to \ncurrency market turnover in emerging markets. The IMF explains the results as follows: \n\u201cFirst, persistent structural factors may be driving the \nappreciation of the currency, obscuring any effect of \nintervention beyond a short period. Second, to the extent \nthat sterilized intervention prevents the domestic interest \nrate from adjusting (especially downwards), it would have \nlimited effects on capital flows driven by interest rate \ndifferentials, thereby failing to alleviate upward pressure on \nthe currency.\u201d \nSome studies (e.g. Lamberte, 1995) support the relatively large offset coefficient of \nsterilized intervention in the Philippines. In 2007, the rate of appreciation of the peso \nincreased  significantly  after  access  to  the  SDA  was  expanded  in  May  (Figure  9). \nHowever, as noted earlier, the persistent appreciation of the Philippine peso after 2005 \nshould also be viewed in the general context of the weak US dollar.  \nOn its part, the BSP argues that its intervention policy cannot be judged by the size \nalone. The size and nature of the shocks and the economy\u2019s financial vulnerability \nshould also be considered. Amid higher volatility of capital flows, BSP intervention needs \nto be commensurately large to maintain orderly market conditions. The Philippine foreign \nexchange market has expanded considerably in the past decade\u2014by more than fivefold \nin terms of the daily turnover in the foreign exchange market\u2014and the gross foreign \nexchange  flows  through  the  financial  system  have  correspondingly  also  grown  in \nmagnitude.11 \nMoreover, the BSP has been accumulating reserves as a form of self-insurance or \nprecautionary reserves balance, as a first line of defense against future financial crises. \nThis  becomes  more  important  in  light  of  the  debt  burden  of  the  Philippines  which \nremains high relative to its comparators. Intervention should therefore be adjusted for \npassive intervention.12 The BSP argues that the analysis should therefore distinguish \nbetween more permanent flows such as exports and remittances and those driven by \ncyclical trends (e.g., higher cross-border flows) as a result, for instance, of diversification \nby central banks and sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in Asia and the Middle East, and \nstructural portfolio adjustments in the private sector, as home bias declines worldwide. If \ncyclical factors are driving the trends in the inflows, intervention may be necessary to \nmoderate the macroeconomic imbalances that could result from such large inflows.  \n                                                 \n11 The views of the BSP, as contained in this paragraph and the next two, were expressed by Dr. Cyd \nTua\u00f1o-Amador, Managing Director for Research of the BSP, during the ADBI workshop in Tokyo on \nDecember 11-12.  \n12 Dr. Tua\u00f1o-Amador cited the fact that the IMF mission recognizes that BSP needs to build up reserves. In \nthe 2006 Article IV consultation report, IMF staff noted that \u201c\u2026reserve cover remains low compared to \nother emerging markets\u2026 Some further intervention to build reserves therefore seems justified.\u201d Former \nIMF Managing Director Rodrigo De Rato in a speech in Thailand in 2007 stated that \u201cThere is a place in \nmanaging capital inflows for intervention, especially where inflows of capital appear to be a short-term \nsurge  rather  than  a  long-term  trend\u201d\u2026and  that  \u201cthe  Fund  recognizes  that  intervention  can  be  an \nappropriate tool of macroeconomic management.\u201d \n 23", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nWhile the Philippines\u2019 international reserves have risen significantly in the past two \nyears, the relative size of the stock of reserves remains considerably smaller compared \nto other countries in the region classified as independent floaters. This is the same \nobservation made by Ho and McCauley (2007). The BSP cites the IMF (2007b) study \nwhich shows that for 2000\u20132007 the BSP\u2019s intervention has been effective in tempering \nthe volatility of exchange rate movements. This is precisely the principle behind the \nBSP\u2019s intervention policy: reducing volatilities rather than swaying the exchange rate in \none direction or changing the path of the exchange rate. \nIt should also be noted that money supply growth in the third quarter of 2007 fell to \n12.4% without any significant rise in interest rates (Table 5). Inflation in 2007 was only \n2.8%, below the target range of 4-5%. These data indicate the effectives of sterilized \nintervention, particularly the use of the SDA. However, intervention and the subsequent \nsterilization  have  financial  costs  and  other  central  banks  are  facing  similar \ncircumstances. This is another reason that the BSP has built up its capital reserves. \nThese accumulated surpluses now serve as a buffer for losses that the BSP is incurring \nin its stabilization efforts. \nHas Inflation-Targeting been Undermined by Foreign Exchange Inflows? \nIn January 2002, the BSP formally shifted to an inflation targeting framework from a \nmonetary aggregating targeting approach in formulating monetary policy. The shift in the \nBSP\u2019s  policy  framework  from  a  monetary  aggregate  targeting  approach  to  inflation \ntargeting  was  prompted  by  the  observation  that  the  historical  relationship  between \ninflation and money supply had weakened, thus undermining the effectiveness of the \npolicy of targeting monetary aggregates. Innovations in financial products and financial \nmarkets, and greater financial liberalization have altered the link between money supply \nand inflation. \nWith more open capital accounts, many countries\u2014including the Philippines\u2014decided \nthat a flexible exchange rate framework is better suited to cushioning domestic economic \nperformance  from  external  disturbances  than  fixed  nominal  exchange  rates.  In  this \ncontext, the inflation target, rather than the fixed exchange rate, performs the role of a \nnominal anchor. The BSP is expected to intervene less in the foreign exchange market, \nallowing the exchange rate to absorb shocks induced by capital flows. \nThe  empirical  results  discussed  indicate  that  the  BSP  may  be  having  difficulty  in \nimplementing the inflation-targeting framework. Surges in foreign exchange inflows\u2014\nboth  from  the  current  and  capital  accounts\u2014seem  to  have  compelled  the  BSP  to \nintervene in the exchange rate market and revert to targeting monetary aggregates. \nWhether this has reduced the effectiveness of inflation-targeting is an issue that has to \nbe analyzed and discussed carefully. \nA recent study by Ho and McCauley (2007) analyzes whether the policy of countering \nforeign exchange inflows with sterilized intervention will result in unintended adverse \ndomestic consequences, particularly in three areas: monetary control, financial stability, \nand central bank profitability and balance sheet risk. In the case of monetary control, \nforeign reserve accumulation may lead to a \u201ctechnical\u201d sterilization problem wherein the \ncentral banks are not able to achieve their operating targets whether they be in terms of \na  quantity  or  price.  Otherwise,  foreign  reserve  accumulation  may  \u201ccompromise  the \n 24", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \ngoals\u201d of central banks by inducing them to adopt a more accommodative monetary \npolicy stance than that required by their inflation objective. \nHo and McCauley conclude that, with perhaps the very recent and short-lived exceptions \nof India and the Philippines, it is difficult to argue that Asian central banks have technical \ndifficulties  with  sterilization  as  a  result  of  large-scale  foreign  exchange  purchases. \nEvidence  from  interest  rate  targeting  central  banks  suggests  technically  effective \nsterilization. Meanwhile, during the period 2002\u201306, Asia did not provide evidence that \nlarge-scale reserve accumulation would be inflationary. The Philippines did over-shoot \nits inflation targets during this period but its intervention was not as heavy as the other \ncountries. Moreover, the relatively high inflation was attributed to supply side factors. \nThe BSP argues that attention is given to monetary aggregates because they have \nimportant information content. Monetary and credit aggregates are some of the many \nvariables  that  are  examined  in  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy  under  an  inflation \ntargeting framework, which is information intensive in its consideration of the factors that \nshould  underpin  policy  action.  There  is  a  large,  although  not  undisputed,  body  of \nevidence which suggests that persistently high growth of money and credit aggregates \nmay provide useful \u201cearly warnings\u201d of emerging financial imbalances and may serve as \nleading indicators of pressures on aggregate demand and on inflation expectations that \nmatter for overall underlying price stability. The growth of monetary aggregates that are \nbeyond the requirements of the economy will tell in the long run on the future evolution \nof prices.13 \nMeanwhile, an accurate representation of BSP\u2019s treatment of the exchange rate in the IT \nframework is one where there is willingness to tolerate a significant degree of variability \nin  the  exchange  rate  and  to  be  sufficiently  disciplined  to  participate  in  the  foreign \nexchange  market  only  in  well-defined  circumstances.  As  noted  earlier,  the  BSP \nintervenes in the market only to temper wide swings in the exchange rate that can lead \nto disorderly market conditions. However, it is important to underscore that in responding \nto capital flows, the BSP follows a package of policy measures. This policy mix includes, \napart  from  exchange  rate  stability,  the  build-up  of  international  reserves  and  the \nprepayment of external obligations. It was pointed out in Section V that the BSP has \nbeen encouraging the shift in the borrowing mix of the government in favor of domestic \nborrowing. Capital account liberalization, specifically through easing of regulations on \nnon-trade transactions and outward capital investments, continues to be pursued, not for \nthe sake of supporting the peso, but because of the economic gains it can bring by way \nof portfolio diversification and improved risk management.  \nReserve Accumulation: Another Interpretation \nThe relatively benign effects of reserve accumulation\u2014or central bank intervention in the \nforeign exchange market\u2014have contributed to the favorable assessment of the BSP, \nparticularly with regard to inflation-targeting. However, economic slack and consequently \nlow domestic interest rates in Asia, including the Philippines, contributed largely to the \nnon-manifestation  of  the  usual  effects  of  reserve  accumulation  (Ho  and  McCauley, \n2007). In this context, Ho and McCauley suggest that reserve accumulation should not \nbe viewed as an exogenous policy with consequences, but rather as a consequence of \n                                                 \n13 The views in this paragraph and the next were also expressed by Dr. Tua\u00f1o-Amador during the ADBI \nworkshop on December 11-12, 2007. \n 25", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nparticular economic circumstances. In particular, the strong efforts to resist currency \nappreciation  in  Asia  can  be  seen  as  a  response  to  weak  post-crisis  recovery  in \ninvestment (Table 12). \nA related view is that the accumulation of reserves is largely a consequence of the low \ninvestment rate which in turn is a direct result of the uncertainty spawned by the 1997 \nfinancial crisis. For example, Genberg et al. (2005) argue that: \n\u201cAlthough it may sound paradoxical, reforms that have \ncontributed to liberalizing and opening domestic financial \nmarkets appear to have weakened investment demand \nthroughout East Asia. Banks and other financial institutions \nhave become much more reluctant to finance long-term \nand risky investment projects out of concern for the quality \nof their asset portfolios\u2026Financial institutions, \ncorporations, and governments themselves have all been \npreoccupied with strengthening their financial positions to \ninsulate themselves against external financial shocks and \nspeculative attacks.\u201d \nAsian  Development  Bank  (2007)  cites  the  favorable  conditions  for  a  recovery  in \ninvestment in East Asia: strong profits, easy credit availability, rebound in prices of \nphysical assets, reductions in debt, and elimination of excess capacity. The sluggish \ninvestment performance as shown in Table 12 is therefore rather surprising and ADB \nattributes  this  to  increased  uncertainty  and  risk.  Consistent  with  the  argument  of \nGenberg et al., the accumulation of reserves is a response to the increase in risk and \nuncertainty, which ultimately has an adverse impact on fixed investment. \nThe  sharp  fall  of  the  investment  rate  can  partly  explain  the  present  Philippine \nmacroeconomic situation wherein the rapid inflow of foreign exchange is accompanied \nby an accumulation of reserves, an appreciating currency in nominal and real terms, a \ncurrent account surplus, rising money supply growth, stable interest rates and inflation, \nand an improving fiscal balance. The situation is markedly different from the one prior to \nthe crisis when the inflow of foreign exchange was accompanied by less exchange \nmarket intervention, a large current account deficit, a fairly stable nominal exchange \nrate,  relatively  high  inflation,  interest  rates  and  money  supply  growth,  and  a  fiscal \nsurplus. In this context, the following arguments can be made: \n\u2022  The proposal of the IMF (2007a) to stem currency appreciation through fiscal \nrestraint is not applicable to the Philippines for two reasons. First, the fiscal \nsituation in the Philippines, while still vulnerable, has improved markedly in the \npast two years. And second, the recommendation of the IMF for fiscal restraint \nwas in the context of correcting a current account deficit. \n\u2022  The more relevant issue for the Philippines is stimulating private investment. This \nwill lead to higher growth of imports and a deterioration of the current account \nbalance which will then check the appreciation of the peso. \n\u2022  The accumulation of reserves and subsequent sterilization has not undermined \nthe policy of inflation targeting. However, as indicated earlier the rise in reserves \nis not necessarily an \u201cintervention\u201d on the part of the BSP and may not even be a \nresult of precautionary motives on the part of economic agents. Rather, reserve \naccumulation is a direct result of weak investment growth, which is reflected in a \n 26", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \ncurrent account surplus. A weak investment rate puts a cap on interest rates by \nlowering the demand for credit. The low interest rate cum low credit growth \nscenario then provides leeway for the BSP to successfully sterilize the rise in \nforeign exchange reserves. Nevertheless, the scenario may change dramatically \nonce private investment recovers and central banks have to adjust their policy \nstance accordingly. \nVII.  THE WAY FORWARD \nMeasures to Increase Private Investment \nThe first set of policy recommendations should deal with stimulating private investment \nin the Philippines. This problem has been the subject of many studies. The recent ADB \nstudy gives a succinct description of the main issues:14 \n\u201cFor Indonesia and the Philippines, where improvements \nhave already taken place in the macroeconomic policy \nenvironment, the key to sustaining growth is likely to lie in \nimproving the quality and performance of key institutions \nthat influence investor perceptions about uncertainties, \nrisks, and the costs of doing business\u2026In the Philippines \n(too), governance issues are to the fore. Contract \nenforcement, corruption, and crime and security are of \nparticular concern\u2026Poor infrastructure, particularly in \npower and transportation, add most to costs. Generally, the \ninstitutions of government are weak and this has slowed \nthe pace of progress. Complex rules and regulations do not \nadequately address competition issues and continue to \ncreate fertile ground for rent seeking. In a variety of \ndimensions, prospects for raising investment and \naccelerated growth will depend on the capacity of \ninstitutions to move ahead and implement the changes that \nare required to reduce uncertainty and risk.\u201d \nA more direct mechanism to ease pressure on the current account would be to channel \nworkers\u2019 remittances to more productive investment projects. The econometric evidence \nclearly shows a link between remittances and investment but the latter should go beyond \nhousing and small-scale transportation which are the more popular options at present. \nTo facilitate more productive investment, the BSP has adopted measures to encourage \noverseas  Filipinos  to  remit  through  the  financial  system,  such  as  enhancing \ntransparency  and  promoting  competition  in  the  remittance  market;  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s  payment  and  settlement  systems  and  the  access  to  financial  services; \nencouraging overseas Filipinos and their families to increase savings and investments; \nand cultivating financial literacy among overseas Filipinos and their families. \n                                                 \n14 A recent World Bank Study explains the dilemma of rising economic growth and declining investment. See \nA. M. Bocchi, \u201cRising growth, declining investment: the puzzle of the Philippines.\u201d Manuscript, November \n1, 2007. \n 27", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nThe Heart of the Matter \nEarlier it was mentioned that the progress in reforming the IFA has been uneven and \nasymmetric. This can gleaned from the Philippine case wherein emphasis has been on \nreforming the domestic financial system. Despite the substantial progress that has been \nmade, the economy is still having difficulty coping with a rapidly appreciating peso. The \nlatter is argued to be largely a result of the weak US dollar, the volatility of which over \nthe past four years is a manifestation of problems in the IFA. \nThe uneven and asymmetric progress in the reform of the IFA\u2014particularly the inability \n\u201cto guarantee a more coherent macroeconomic policy approach at the global level\u201d\u2014 is \na manifestation of the unipolar world of finance which has been characterized as unjust \nand unsustainable.15 This is an extension of Triffin\u2019s dilemma. In the present global \nfinancial system most of the international trade is denominated in US dollars, most of the \ninternational reserves are held in US dollars, and the US can pay for its external deficits \nby printing dollars which it does not expect to be redeemed in the foreseeable future. \nThe US-led private financial institutions intermediate a major part of international savings \nand investments and the US-led international financial institutions now play a decisive \nrole in determining the macroeconomic policies of many developing countries. \nUnder the unipolar financial system, the US has been appropriating seigniorage that is \ncreated by expanding world trade and cross-border capital flows. Because the US gets \ntremendous benefits in terms of financial gain and ideological hegemony, it cannot be \nexpected to surrender these gains voluntarily through a meaningful reform of the IFA. In \nthe unipolar world of finance, the US has had a soft budget constraint in terms of its \nexternal deficit. The US has been able to combine a widening current account deficit \nwith an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate\u2014or at least one that is relatively \nstable\u2014because of huge capital inflows. This has led to what has been referred to as \nthe trans-Pacific macroeconomic imbalance. \nHowever, the US current account deficit reached $857 billion in 2006, equivalent to a \nhistorical high of 6.5% of GDP. As a point of comparison, the combined GDP of the \nASEAN member countries was $884 billion in 2005 and approximately $1 trillion in 2006. \nLargely because of its soft budget constraint, the US has become the world\u2019s largest \ndebtor nation with a net foreign debt of $2.7 trillion as of 2005. Another major cause for \nconcern is that the annual balance of net income on domestic and foreign investments in \nthe US was \u2013$1 billion in 2006, making it the first year on record with a negative net \nincome flow. If \u201cnet investment income\u201d continues to deteriorate, it will add to the current \naccount deficit and increase the risk of a major reduction or reversal in the capital inflows \ninto the US. \nIn this context, fixed investment in East Asia may actually be constrained by the need to \nsupport the trans-Pacific macroeconomic imbalance and prevent the sharp fall of the \ndollar. The sustainability of the trans-Pacific macroeconomic imbalance has been a \nsubject of debate and there is still no consensus.16 However, the sharp depreciation of \n                                                 \n15 A large part of this section is lifted from Agarwala (2004). \n16 The more appropriate term is \u201cglobal macroeconomic imbalances\u201d since the US has a deficit also with the \nEU. This issue and the possibility of East Asian investment being constrained by the need to support the \nUS dollar is discussed thoroughly in the following recently published books Global Imbalances and the US \nDebt Problem \u2013 Should Developing Countries Support the US Dollar?

Yap \nthe US dollar, particularly since March 2006 and a pending US economic recession may \nbe an indication of a difficult adjustment process. \nIn  order  to  partly  address  the  inequity  caused  by  a  unipolar  financial  system,  the \nexpanded use of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) was recommended. The introduction of \nSDRs in 1969 created a truly global money to be used exclusively as a reserve asset, \nthus generating a more balanced distribution of seigniorage powers. Unfortunately, this \nproposal has not been implemented. A recommendation for a third allocation of SDRs, \nthough approved by 77% voting majority of the IMF in 1997, did not come into effect \nbecause of opposition by the US Congress.  \nOther  recommendations  include  an  international  currency  (Mundell,  2003)  and  an \ninternational clearing agency (ICA) (D\u2019Arista, 2006). This ICA could be based on a \nproposal by John Maynard Keynes revised to serve as the institutional platform for a \nnew  global  payments  system  that  would  foster  egalitarian  interactions  and  more \nbalanced outcomes. The new ICA would clear transactions denominated in members\u2019 \naccounts. These clearing accounts would, in fact, constitute the international reserves of \nthe system, held for the member countries by the ICA and valued using a trade-weighted \nbasket of all members\u2019 currencies. \nRegional Monetary and Financial Cooperation \nRegional financial and monetary cooperation in East Asia is at a critical juncture. The \nway forward has tremendous implications for the IFA. The \u201ceasy\u201d phase of the reform \nprocess in East Asia is at its tail end. Policymakers in the region now have to agree to a \nblueprint  for  financial  sector  development  in  the  foreseeable  future,  the  long-term \nobjective of which Kuroda (2004) succinctly identified as the establishment of a single \ncurrency in East Asia. This would cover the need to channel more East Asian savings to \ninfrastructure and investment projects in the region. \nThe main elements of the blueprint are: (i) the structure of regional financial cooperation \nin terms of reserve pooling and exchange rate coordination; (ii) the relationship between \nregional cooperation and the domestic financial system, including required domestic \neconomic  reforms;  (iii)  the  institutional  set-up  in  the  region  that  will  underpin \nimplementation  of  the  blueprint;  and  (iv)  the  non-economic  objectives  of  regional \nfinancial cooperation. \nThe  last  two  elements  have  important  political  economy  considerations.  More \nspecifically, they involve establishing a political consensus which is difficult in East Asia \ndue to differences in political systems, \u201chistory\u201d issues and the lack of mutual trust \n(Kawai, 2005). No single economic power plays a dominant role in East Asia similar to \nthat of the US in the Western Hemisphere, nor does any bipolar relationship exist similar \nto the Franco-German alliance in Western Europe. Japan has been mired in economic \nstagnation over the last decade and the People\u2019s Republic of China, while recently \nemerging as an economic power, has yet to achieve full transition to a market economy \nand, more fundamentally, political transition. \n                                                                                                                                               \nInternational Financial System. Edited by J. J. Teunissen. Fondad, The Hague, June 2007. The books \ncontain relevant policy recommendations on how to address the unipolar financial system. \n 29", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nPromoting  non-economic  objectives  highlights  the  political  economy  issues  that  are \ninvolved. In light of the European experience, an important consideration in evaluating \nthe  trade-off  between  the  potential  benefits  to  be  reaped  from  exchange  rate \ncoordination and the potential costs associated with the loss of macroeconomic policy \nindependence arising from the implied need for broader macroeconomic cooperation, is \nwhether the ultimate goals of financial cooperation in East Asia are wholly economic or \nalso partly political. The goal could ultimately be political if the objective of fostering \nincreased regional economic integration is paramount, and that objective is itself an \ninstrumental one designed to achieve political goals. These could include, as in the \nEuropean case:  \n(i)  The  desire  to  defuse  potential  regional  political  conflicts.  An  important \nassumption  driving  European  integration  was  that  enhanced  economic \ninterdependence  would  induce  European  countries  to  focus  on  common \ninterests.  \n(ii)  Allowing the region to speak more effectively with one voice in international \naffairs. This was also an important motive in Europe, and has played a role in \nother  regional  integration  initiatives.  As  the  world  economy  becomes \nincreasingly  globalized  and  international  negotiations  on  financial  and \ncommercial issues intensify, its importance may be increasing over time. \nGrenville (2003) similarly points out that: \n\u201cRegional groupings are the principal way of addressing \nthis \u2018democratic deficit\u2019. There seems little room for debate \nthat this region is inadequately represented in many of the \nforums which determine the important issues of \nglobalization. There seems little doubt, also, that the region \npays a price for this. East Asia, with an IMF quota of less \nthan 15 percent, accounts for more than 20 percent of \nworld GDP, almost a quarter of world trade, and almost half \nof world foreign exchange reserves.\u201d \nIn other words, the process of institutionalizing East Asian regional cooperation should \nbe a venue where common interests of the countries can be articulated. Subsequently, it \ncan be a vehicle by which these interests are pushed in the global setting.  \nThe inability of East Asia to effectively speak with one voice, particularly with regard to \nthe IFA, is one major reason why reform of the latter has become uneven, asymmetric, \nand patchy. A case in point is the proposed measures to address the trans-Pacific \nmacroeconomic imbalance. Currently, policy proposals that are played up in the media \nare focused on revaluing East Asian currencies, particularly the yuan. However, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China is not large enough an economy to be responsible for the US \ndeficits or to be able to correct them. Between 1997 and 2004, the US current account \ndeficit deteriorated by $529 billion, and, over the same period, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina\u2019s current account position improved by only $35.6 billion (Genberg et al., 2005). A \nunited East Asian front could throw its weight towards a solution that emphasizes fiscal \nconsolidation by the US, which makes more economic sense.  \nAnother important issue is that of capital controls, which have proven be effective in \nseveral economies (see for example Epstein et al., 2004). This is evident with the \n 30", "ADBI Discussion Paper 91    Josef T. Yap \nbehavior of the Malaysian ringgit compared to other currencies in the region (Figure 1 \nand Table 7). However, with the advent of greater financial integration, capital controls, \nparticularly on inflows, have to be endorsed at the international level in order to be \neffective (Grenville, 2007). Given that this would require IMF endorsement, international \nbacking of any form of capital controls is unlikely. Hence, endorsement at the regional \nlevel would be a second best solution. A united East Asian front could subsequently \nadvocate  for  fundamental  reform  of  the  IFA,  particularly  with  regard  to  its  current \nunipolar structure. \n \nReferences \nAgarwala, R.
