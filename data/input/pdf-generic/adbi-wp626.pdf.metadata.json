INTRODUCTION \nSustainable  Development  Goal  9 focuses  on the  role  of  infrastructure  to  promote \ninclusive,  sustainable  development,  and  recognizes  the  importance  of  developing \nregional and international infrastructure to achieve this objective. This paper uses an \ninternational trade perspective to examine how the development of regional, national, \nor international infrastructure can affect economic development.  \nThere is ample literature focusing on the relationships between trade and development, \ninfrastructure and development, and trade and infrastructure. Often, it suggests that \ninternational trade and investment in infrastructure promote development, and that  \nthis relationship is reinforced by the positive impact that investments in both national \nand international infrastructure have on international trade. This paper, however, aims  \nto  better  understand  why  these  positive,  reinforcing  relationships  are  not  always \nobserved. In particular, the role played by initial conditions and complementarities is \nanalyzed to explain the heterogeneity of outcomes that are observed when countries \nengage in trade reform or investments in national and international infrastructure.  \nThe objective is not to determine whether trade or infrastructure investment is good for \ndevelopment; instead, it is to inform policy makers on the timing of trade reforms or \ninvestments in infrastructure so that they can help\u2014rather than hinder\u2014development. \nThis paper also aims to identify other reforms, policies, institutions, and investments to \nensure that trade and infrastructure have a positive impact on development.1  \nFirst, the relationship between trade and economic growth is examined, both from \ntheoretical and empirical perspectives, to highlight the importance of initial conditions  \nin explaining the heterogeneity of outcomes associated with trade reforms in different \ncountries with various initial conditions. Second, the literature regarding the role played \nby investments in infrastructure in promoting trade is examined. The last section of the \npaper examines whether policy makers should invest their marginal infrastructure funds \non national or international infrastructure.  \n2.  DOES TRADE PROMOTE GROWTH? \nClassical growth theory demonstrates that decreased marginal returns to accumulation \nof  capital  result  in  declining  growth  in  a  closed  economy.  The  only  source  of  \nlong-term  growth  in  such  models  is  productivity.  Ventura  (1997)  showed  that  \nin the presence of capital accumulation and diminishing returns, international trade \nallows for long-term growth. He provided a multi-sector open economy version of the \nclassical growth model where international trade allows factor price equalization to beat \ndiminishing returns to capital, which leads to positive long-term growth without any \nneed for productivity growth.  \nThe key in Ventura\u2019s model is that as capital accumulates, the comparative advantage \nof the economy changes, which alters the composition of aggregate production per the \nRybczynski theorem. These changes in the structure of production allow the capital-\naccumulating country to beat declining marginal returns of capital, and lead to long-run \ngrowth. In other words, international trade transforms the classical growth model into \nan AK model. However, restructuring the production bundle in an economy does not \n                                                \n1  It is important to note that this paper focuses on economic growth rather than sustainable development. \nThe latter is multidimensional; trying to capture the impact of trade and infrastructure on development \nwould transform this paper into a volume by itself. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nunequivocally lead to higher growth. An example of this is provided by Matsuyama \n(1992), who showed that if trade pushes an economy toward specialization in a sector \nwith low \u201clearning\u201d or growth opportunities, this can lead to lower aggregate economic \ngrowth through a composition effect.  \nWhen a theory provides ambiguous answers, researchers turn to empirical evidence. \nAlthough  early  empirical  literature  tended  to  suggest  that  trade  liberalization  is \nassociated with higher growth, Rodr\u00edguez and Rodrik (2000) showed that most of this \nliterature was plagued with methodological issues, including the definition of trade \nreforms,  which  often  used  not  only  trade-related  reforms  but  also  macroeconomic \nreforms (e.g., Sachs and Warner 1995), and issues of endogeneity and measurement \n(e.g., Edwards 1998, Frankel and Romer 1999) leading to biased results. Moreover, \nthe use of cross-sectional data from different countries at various levels of development \nwith diverse initial conditions implicitly assumed that the response to trade reforms is \nhomogeneous, but this is unlikely.  \nWacziarg and Welch (2008) addressed most of the criticisms in Rodr\u00edguez and Rodrik \n(2000). Making use of the within-country variation in openness to trade and economic \ngrowth with a difference-in-difference estimator, they controlled for initial conditions and \nestimated  that  when  economies  open  up to  trade, gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth increases, on average, by 2 percentage points (Figure 1). They also provided \nevidence that the mechanism through which GDP grows is due to a sharp increase in \ninvestment following trade reforms.  \nFigure 1: Gross Domestic Product Growth before and after Trade Liberalization \n \ny-axis = percentage points. \nSource: Wacziarg and Welch (2008). \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nFeyrer (2009a), using a methodology similar to Frankel and Romer (1999), estimated \nan elasticity of income per capita with respect to trade of 0.5. This circumvented  \nthe  problem  in  Frankel  and  Romer  (1999),  who  used  time-invariant  geography \ndeterminants  of  bilateral  trade  to  instrument  for  aggregate  trade  when  explaining \nvariations  in  income  per  capita  across  countries,  by  using  a  measure  of  the  \ntime-varying impact of geographic distance on trade (i.e., with technological progress in \nthe international transport sector, the same geographic distance does not have the \nsame impact across time). Feyrer, therefore, instrumented international trade flows \nusing a measure of time-varying distance; this enabled using bilateral fixed effects to \ncontrol  for  time-invariant  institutional  determinants  of  income  per  capita  \n(and trade), which, as argued by Rodr\u00edguez and Rodrik (2000), are important omitted \nvariables in Frankel and Romer.2  \nThe literature is growing on firm productivity and trade liberalization, which has tended \nto show that within-firm productivity increases with trade reforms through two main \nchannels: (i) a larger variety of cheaper intermediate inputs and stronger competition, \nand (ii) a composition effect due to the exit of less-productive domestic firms (Pavcnik \n2002,  Amiti  and  Konings  2007,  Khandelwal  and  Topalova  2011).  The  growth  in \naggregate productivity through these two channels then partly explains the positive \nimpact of trade reforms on GDP growth. Similarly, the literature on exporting firms and \nproductivity has tended to show that exporting firms are more productive, but that this \nis  mainly  due  to  a  selection  effect  that  more  productive  firms  become  exporters \n(Bernard and Jensen 1999). Although most of the existing evidence is for developed \ncountries, recent empirical work using developing country data shows some evidence \nof  \u201clearning-by-exporting,\u201d  in  which  firms  become  more  productive  as  they  start \nexporting (Van Biesebroeck 2005). \nAn  issue  not  addressed  by  recent  empirical  literature  on trade  and growth  is  the \npotential heterogeneity in the impact of trade reforms on growth. It is only on average \nthat opening up to trade leads to the 2-percentage-point-higher growth in Wacziarg and \nWelch (2008) and Feyrer (2009a). Perhaps the more interesting question is why some \ncountries grow faster and others slow down when they open up to trade.3  \nFreund and Bolaky (2008) were among the first to search for systematic differences. \nTheir focus was on whether the sign and size of the impact depend on the flexibility of \nbusiness regulations in each country. To take advantage of new opportunities offered \nby trade openness, factors of production need to be reallocated from sectors with \nrelatively low productivity to sectors with relatively high productivity. For this to occur, \nbusiness regulations must ensure that firms can exit and enter sectors without facing \nlarge costs. Figure 2 illustrates the importance of entry barriers in determining the gains \nfrom trade in a two-sector model with an import-competing and exported good. Panel A \nillustrates the classic gains from trade when there are no entry costs, while panel B \nshows  the  additional  losses  associated  with  trade  when  entry  costs  do  not  allow \nresources to be redeployed from low to high productivity sectors and, as a result,  \nare unemployed.  \n                                                \n2  Feyrer (2009b) also exploited the idea that the impact of geographic distance can be time varying by \nusing the changes in maritime shipping distance resulting from the closing of the Suez Canal in 1967 \nand its reopening in 1975. He argued that the shock provoked by the opening and closing of the canal \nwas exogenous and showed that the induced changes in trade had a positive and statistically significant \nimpact on trade flows.  \n3  Important inputs into this process are early case studies of episodes of trade reforms in a selected \nnumber of developing countries (CUTS International 2008), which explained the heterogeneity of \nexperiences across countries. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nFigure 2: Gains from Trade with and without Entry Costs \n \nSource: Freund and Bolaky (2008). \nFreund  and  Bolaky  (2008)  empirically  examined  the  role  played  by  business \nregulations  in  determining  the  impact  of  trade  on  income  per  capita.  They  split \ncountries  in  their  sample  into  those  with  above-median  business  regulations  \n and  those  with  below-median  business  regulations  in  terms  \nof the flexibility granted for the entry and exit of firms. They showed that a positive \nrelationship  exists  between  trade  and  income  per  capita,  but  only  in  countries  \nwith above-median business regulations. The relationship is negative although not \nstatistically significant for countries with below-median business regulations. These \nresults  are  robust  to  the  introduction  of  control  variables,  such  as  rule  of  law,  \ndistance to the equator, a dummy indicating whether the country is landlocked, and  \npopulation size. \nChang, Kaltani and Loayza (2009) built on Freund and Bolaky (2008) in exploring how \nother types of complementarities affect the relationship between trade and growth in a \ndynamic panel containing 22 developed countries and 60 developing countries, with, \non  average,  11  observations  per  country.  Using  interaction  terms,  they  examined  \nhow the impact of trade reforms on economic growth varies depending on education \nenrollment, financial depth, inflation, telecommunications infrastructure, governance, \nlabor  market  flexibility,  and  firm  entry  and  exit  flexibility.  They  found  that  higher \neducation  enrollment,  financial  depth,  better  governance,  and  telecommunications \ninfrastructure, as well as more labor market and firm entry and exit flexibility, shift, from \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nnegative to positive, the impact on GDP growth of a one standard deviation increase  \nin  the  log  of trade-GDP  ratio. Thus,  they showed  that  initial  conditions  do matter  \nand can change the impact of trade reforms on economic growth from positive to \nstatistically insignificant or even negative. \n3.  THE ROLE OF INFRASTRUCTURE  \nAs further shown by Chang, Kaltani, and Loayza (2009), the quality of infrastructure \n(proxied  by  the  number  of  main  telephone  lines  per  capita  in  their  paper)  is  an \nimportant determinant of the impact of trade reforms on economic growth. At the \nbottom of the sample in terms of quality of infrastructure, increases in trade openness \nlead to negative growth, while at the top of the distribution, trade openness leads  \nto positive GDP growth.4  \nYet the number of telephone lines is only a partial indicator of infrastructure. Other \nliterature  has  been  examining  how  many  other  dimensions  of  hard  infrastructure  \n(e.g.,  telephone  lines  and  other  information  and  communications  technology \ninfrastructure,  ports,  and  roads)  and  soft  infrastructure  (e.g.,  border  and  transport \nefficiency,  and  the  business  and  regulatory  environment)  affect  international  trade \nflows. Most of this literature has used the empirical workhorse of studies in international \ntrade\u2014the gravity equation.  \nNord\u00e5s and Piermartini (2004) were an early example, although their results were not \nvery robust to the introduction of infrastructure variables in the gravity framework. One \nproblem with their approach is that the gravity framework is built to explain the variation \nin bilateral trade flows, and infrastructure variables are measured at the aggregate  \nlevel (i.e., the quality of the importer\u2019s port is the same no matter from whom one  \nis importing). They built a bilateral index of infrastructure that combines the levels in the \nimporting  and  exporting  country,  which  implicitly  assumed  that  they  are  perfect \nsubstitutes for each other.  \nHelble, Shepherd, and Wilson (2009) focused on how the degree of transparency in \nsetting trade policy affects bilateral trade flows among Asia-Pacific countries. However, \nthey had the same issue as Nord\u00e5s and Piermartini (2004), as transparency in trade \npolicy varies at the importer or exporter level, but they circumvented this problem by \naccepting potential bias due to the absence of multilateral resistance terms in their \ngravity specification. Their measure of transparency in trade policy partly captured \nmeasures of soft infrastructure (e.g., the degree of trade-related corruption, efficiency \nof  customs  and  border  agencies,  logistics  indicators,  as  well  as  the  degree  of \nuncertainty in trade policy), and they addressed the problem of endogeneity using the \nfact that ex-British colonies tend to have more transparent trade regimes. While the \ndegree to which this supposition\u2014being an ex-British colony satisfies the exclusion \nrestriction\u2014cannot be tested (as there is only one instrument), this is one of the rare \nstudies  that  recognized  the  problem  of  endogeneity.  Their  results  showed  that \ntransparency in trade policy setting in an importing country positively affects bilateral \ntrade flows, while exporter transparency in trade policy settings seems to have a more \nambiguous impact on trade flows (Table 1). \n   \n                                                \n4  Increases in trade openness may lead to negative GDP growth in the presence of poor infrastructure, \nbecause, as in Freund and Bolaky (2008), it is difficult to reallocate resources to more productive uses \nin the presence of poor infrastructure.  \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M.

Reference group weighting is included to \ncircumvent endogeneity problems.   \nSource: Helble, Shepherd, and Wilson (2009). \nFrancois and Manchin (2013) examined the impact of infrastructure and institutional \nquality on bilateral trade flows using a gravity setup that controlled for zero trade as \nwell as multilateral resistance using a method proposed by Baier and Bergstrand \n(2009). To control for endogeneity of infrastructure and institutional quality, they used \ntheir lagged values, like many others in the literature, but these may be inadequate \ninstruments given the important time persistence of variables such as infrastructure \nand institutions. Nevertheless, consistent with other results in the literature, they  \nfound that both infrastructure and institutional quality are important determinants of \nbilateral trade.  \nPortugal-Perez and Wilson (2012) also used the gravity framework to examine the \nimpact of hard and soft infrastructure on bilateral trade flows. They found that physical \ninfrastructure is the most robust determinant of bilateral exports, whereas the impact of \nother variables often changes sign depending on specifications or the estimators used.  \nDjankov, Freund, and Pham (2010) used a difference gravity equation to solve the \nproblem that most infrastructure variables do not have a bilateral dimension, which  \nis  the  variation  in  data  used  to  estimate  gravity  equations.5 They  found  that  soft \ninfrastructure does matter for international trade; for example, an extra day in the \nnumber of days necessary to clear customs in an exporting country leads to a 1% \nreduction in exports. They also controlled for potential reverse causality, as countries \nthat rely more on export markets may invest more on export infrastructure. To address \nthis, they used a sample of landlocked countries and instrumented the time to export \nwith the time to export in neighboring countries. Note that it is unclear that this solved \nthe potential omitted variable bias, as the time to export in neighboring countries may \nbe a direct determinant of exports in landlocked countries.  \n                                                \n5  The problem with the difference gravity equation is that results are sensitive to the choice of reference \ncountries.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nHelble (2014) focused on international transport infrastructure, examining how shipping \nand air cargo connections and frequency among Pacific countries affect their bilateral \ntrade flows. The variables of interest (i.e., direct connectivity and frequency) had a \nbilateral dimension, and the setup addressed the problem of zeroes and multilateral \nresistance as well as endogeneity using measures of direct connectivity and frequency \nfor passenger flights rather than shipping and cargo flights. The instrumental variable \nresults suggested that having a direct connection and high connection frequency have \na large and statistically significant impact on bilateral trade flows. \nThere is also recent literature on the importance of soft and hard infrastructure on \nexports at the firm level, more neatly identifying the causal effect. It also has focused \nmore on national rather than international infrastructure. One example is Volpe and \nBlyde (2013), who utilized the damage caused to roads by a Chilean earthquake (i.e., a \nnatural  experiment)  to  identify  the  impact  of  road  deterioration  on  firms\u2019  exports, \ndepending on their location. They used a difference-in-difference estimator where the \nchange  in  exports  of  firms  that  were  unaffected  by  the  earthquake  serves  as  a \ncounterfactual for those firms that were close to damaged roads. They discovered a \nlarge negative and statistically significant effect of the earthquake on firms\u2019 exports.  \nVolpe et al. (2014) used a similar empirical approach to examine the impact of shipping \ncosts on exports. Using another \u201cnatural experiment,\u201d that is, the closing of the main \nbridge  between  Argentina  and  Uruguay  due  to  an  environmental  dispute,  they \ninvestigated how the closing led to higher shipping costs and how it affected exports \nbetween the two countries. They found a very large impact; a 1% increase in shipping \ncosts caused a 7% decline in exports. \nSome literature also has focused on the impact of soft infrastructure projects related to \ncustoms efficiency on firm exports. Volpe, Carballo, and Graziano (2015) noted how \nthe functioning of customs, and in particular the time it takes to clear them, affects \nfirms\u2019 export values. In other words, they addressed a similar question as Djankov, \nFreund, and Pham (2010), but used firm-level data to identify the causal impact.6 \nEndogeneity and reverse causality, in particular, are problematic, as larger and more \nfrequent exporters may face shorter (or longer) customs delays. Utilizing Uruguayan \ncustoms data at the transaction level, they solved this problem by using the random \nallocation  of  shipments  to  expedient  customs  channels,  which  they  used  as  an \ninstrument for the time spent at customs. They found that customs delays have a \nnegative, large, and statistically significant impact on the value of export shipments. \nAn interesting point made by Carballo et al. (2016a) is that the time spent at customs is \nendogenous, as firms will choose different channels or whether to export depending on \nthe  length  and  frequency  of  customs  delays.  Therefore,  any  ranking  of  customs \nefficiency based on actual time spent at customs will be biased by a composition effect. \nMore importantly, they showed that the impact of customs delays is heterogeneous \nacross firms; in particular, new firms are more elastic to customs delays. This may be \nbecause  unexpected  delays  hurt  the  reputation  of  new  firms  more  than  that  of \nestablished firms. \nAnother question is whether export programs aimed at facilitating trade for small firms \nare effective. An example of such a program is Peru\u2019s Exporta F\u00e1cil, which allows for \nthe export of small shipments (i.e., below $2,000 and a maximum of 30 kilograms) \nthrough Peru\u2019s postal system using simplified export procedures. Carballo, Schaur, and \nVolpe (2016a) examined its impact on exports and found that the program boosts \n                                                \n6  They also had information of the actual time spent by each shipment at customs rather than the time \nreported by a few customs operators as in the World Bank Doing Business database.  \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nexports  mainly  through  the  extensive  margin,  allowing  smaller  firms  to  enter  new \nmarkets with new products. The survival rate of new exporting firms seems also to be \nmuch  larger  for  those  firms  using  the  program.  Trade  facilitation  programs  can, \ntherefore, have larger impacts on smaller firms. \nIndeed, the development of online platforms such as eBay, Alibaba, and Amazon  \nthat allow small firms to access customers in distant countries, combined with trade \nfacilitation programs such as Exporta F\u00e1cil, has the potential for making trade more \ninclusive  by  allowing  smaller,  less-productive  firms  in  various  countries  reach \ninternational customers. Lendle et al. (2016) showed that geographic distance matters \nmuch less for online platforms than offline, and that through feedback mechanisms, \nthey allow for the creation of a good reputation at a relatively low cost. This explains \nwhy small firms can access a large number of distant export markets and have higher \nsurvival rates than offline firms (Lendle et al. 2013). This literature also suggests that \nthe combination of trade facilitation programs with programs providing access to online \nplatforms to small firms in remote areas can be effective for spreading the benefits  \nof globalization where they are most needed. \nMore  generally,  the  simplification  of  customs  procedures  through  the  introduction  \nof electronic customs single windows (Carballo et al. 2016b) or implementation of \nauthorized economic operator programs (Carballo, Schaur, Volpe 2016b) that simplify \nprocedures for trustworthy firms generate increases in firms\u2019 exports along both the \nintensive and extensive margins.  \n4.  NATIONAL VERSUS INTERNATIONAL \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nAs shown by the previously reviewed literature, national and international infrastructure \ntends to have a positive impact on exports. However, should public investment in \ninfrastructure be targeted toward national or international infrastructure?  \nRecent evidence by Atkin and Donaldson (2015) suggested that the answer to this \nquestion may be country-specific. They showed that in Ethiopia and Nigeria, national \ntrade costs may be 4\u20135 times larger than in the US, implying that more priority should \nbe given to investment in national infrastructure in Ethiopia and Nigeria than in the US. \nMartin  and  Rogers  (1995)  put  forward  a  theoretical  model  of  firm  location  that \naddresses this question. National infrastructure was defined as infrastructure that helps \nnational  trade,  while  international  infrastructure  was  defined  as  the  infrastructure \nhelping international trade. The focus of their model was on GDP per capita. In their \nmodel, trade integration implied that in the presence of economies of scale, firms tend \nto locate in countries with better national infrastructure, as they offer lower costs to \nserve all markets. Better international infrastructure magnifies the industrial relocation \nof firms toward a country with better national infrastructure.  \nThis, of course, has implications for developing countries, which tend to have poor \ninfrastructure.  Investment  in  national  infrastructure  will  help  the  relocation  of firms  \nto  developing  countries,  which  become  more  attractive.  However,  investment  in \ninternational infrastructure will make it more attractive to serve the developing country \nmarket from countries with better national infrastructure. Thus, if investment in national \nand  international  infrastructure  unambiguously  makes  infrastructure-rich  countries \nmore  attractive,  this  is  not  the  case  for  countries  with  poor  infrastructure\u2014only \ninvestment in national infrastructure will make countries with poor infrastructure more \nattractive to investors.  \n8 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nThe prediction of Martin and Rogers (1995) has not been empirically tested due to  \na  measurement  problem  (i.e.,  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  between  national  and \ninternational infrastructure, as it cannot be known if the road from the firm to the port \npart of national or international infrastructure) and an endogeneity problem in trying to \nassess the impact of infrastructure on income.  \nThis paper tries to circumvent these two issues. The measurement problem is partly \nsolved  by  new  databases  with  the  measurement  of  bilateral  trade  costs  between \ncountries made available by Novy (2013) and Arvis et al. (2015), who used these data \nand the gravity framework to back out bilateral trade costs between countries. It is \nimportant to note that trade costs do not only imply bad infrastructure, but they are \naffected by bad infrastructure. Moreover, the logic of Martin and Rogers (1995) carries \nover to other determinants of national and international trade costs.  \nOne problem with the existing bilateral trade cost dataset is that the methodology only \ncaptures bilateral trade costs relative to the geometric average of national trade costs \nin an exporting and importing country. To test Martin and Rogers (1995), a measure of \ninternational trade costs relative to national trade costs in each country is needed\u2014not \none relative to the average domestic costs of an importing and exporting country.  \nThus,  this  paper  must  work  at  the  region  rather  than  country  level  to  focus  on \nintraregional (as a proxy for national) to extraregional (i.e., international) infrastructure. \nThe 22 United Nations geographical regions are used (four in the Americas, five in \nAsia, five in Africa, four in Europe, and four in the Indian Ocean), and then the ratio of \nintraregional to extraregional trade costs for each region are measured.  \nNote that this does not completely solve the problem. The intraregional trade costs now \ncapture the average intraregional trade costs relative to the geometric mean of national \ncosts within the region, which is the type of measure necessary. However, to only use \nthis measure would potentially suffer from an omitted variable bias, as extraregional \ntrade costs are excluded from the analysis. However, using the ratio of intraregional to \nextraregional trade costs is problematic, as the extraregional trade costs are actually \ngiven by the ratio of extraregional trade costs relative to the geometric mean of national \ncosts in the region and rest-of-the-world trading partners. The assumption necessary  \nis  at  the  regional  level,  the  ratio  of  national  regional  trade  costs  to  extraregional \nnational  trade  costs  is  relatively  constant  across  time  and  can  be  captured  by  a \nregional dummy.7  \nThe  endogeneity  problem  of  national  and  international  infrastructure  is  usually \naddressed by using an instrumental variable estimator, but as discussed above, it is \ndifficult to identify a variable that will be correlated with infrastructure (or trade costs) \nbut  otherwise  be  uncorrelated  with  international  trade  or  income.  The  solution  to  \nthis is not to focus on the impact of national or international infrastructure, but on the \nratio of national to international infrastructure (i.e., the ratio of international to national \ntrade costs). The idea is that if national and international infrastructure (i.e., trade \ncosts) are likely to be endogenous to economic activity, the ratio is less likely to  \nbe affected by economic activity. In other words, the identifying assumption is that \nanything that may be simultaneously affecting infrastructure and income is affecting \nnational and international infrastructure in a similar way, so it does not create an \nendogeneity problem. \n                                                \n7  Note that there is a tension with the argument here. As the region level is aggregated, country-specific \nshocks are averaged out, but because the rest of the world becomes smaller (as the unit of observation \nbecomes the region) the averaging out of specific shocks in the rest of the world becomes less effective. \nAs an alternative, the same econometric specifications are run at the country level, and then the country \nfixed effects will capture the ratio of national trade costs to rest-of-the-world national trade costs. \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M.

Olarreaga \n \ninteraction of the ratio of intraregional to extraregional trade costs are introduced with a \ndummy that signals that the ratio is above the median of the distribution, a negative, \nlarge, and statistically significant coefficient is obtained in the interaction of the relative \ncost of intraregional to extraregional trade costs, with a dummy variable indicating that \nthe region has above-median intraregional to extraregional trade costs\u2014the prediction \nof Martin and Rogers (1995). In countries where the intraregional infrastructure is \nrelatively bad, a deterioration of the ratio of intraregional to extraregional infrastructure \nhurts  growth.  Note  that  deterioration  in  the  ratio  of  intraregional  to  extraregional \ninfrastructure  can  be  achieved  by  improving  the  extraregional  infrastructure  while \nleaving the intraregional infrastructure unchanged. Thus, in countries with relatively \npoor national infrastructure relative to international infrastructure, priority should be \ngiven to investments in national infrastructure, not international infrastructure. \nIn the third column, the distribution of intraregional trade costs is used instead of the \ndistribution  of  intraregional  to  extraregional  trade  costs  to  split  the  sample  at  the \nmedian, and similar results are obtained to the ones in the second column. The reason \nfor this robustness test is that the intraregional trade costs at the regional level are not \ncontaminated by the national trade costs in the rest of the world. \nIn  the  fourth  column,  the  level  of  observation  is  the  country\u2014not  the  region.  As \ndiscussed above, the measures of international trade costs in Arvis et al. (2015) are \nactually  the  ratio  of  international  trade  costs  to  the  geometric  mean  of  national  \ntrade costs between the importer and exporter. As long as all countries are small, the \nrest-of-the-world national trade costs may be captured by the year dummies. Because \ntheir measure is the ratio of international to national cost, the inverse is taken to make \nthem  comparable  with  the  intraregional  (as  a  proxy  for  national)  to  extraregional  \n(as a proxy for international) trade costs. Results in the fourth column confirm that the \ncoefficient on the interaction is negative and statistically significant.  \nIn the fifth and sixth column, how sensitive the results are to splitting of the sample at \nthe median is tested. In the fifth column, the same is split at the 25th percentile, and in \nthe sixth column, it is at the 75th percentile. Although the coefficient on the interaction \nis always negative, it is not statistically significant, which suggests that results are not \nvery robust to the choice of threshold. This may have been expected from the Martin \nand Rogers (1995) model, which did not specify the level of threshold at which the \nchange in regime occurs. Nevertheless, these results call for some further robustness \nor confirmation that a split at the median is reasonable.  \nTo examine whether the split of the sample at the median is a reasonable assumption, \na Hansen (2000) threshold model estimation is followed, rewriting equation 1 as a  \ntwo-regime model: \n  (2) \nwhere \u03b3ln c\ud835\udc66a\ud835\udc5fp,\ud835\udc61t=ure\ud835\udefcs\ud835\udc5f +ho\ud835\udefcw\ud835\udc61 +th\ud835\udefee\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc5fr,a\ud835\udc61tlino\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5fo,\ud835\udc61f +in\ud835\udf0ctr\ufffda1re\u2212gi\ud835\udc37o\ud835\udc5fn,\ud835\udc61a\ufffdl lnto\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5fe,\ud835\udc61x+tra\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc5fre,\ud835\udc61gional trade costs affects  \nGDP per capita in a regime with relatively high intraregional to extraregional trade  \ncosts (i.e., relative poor intraregional infrastructure), and \u03c1 captures the impact on  \nGDP per capita of intraregional to extraregional trade costs when in a regime with \nrelatively  low  intraregional  to  extraregional  trade  costs  (i.e.,  a  relatively  good \nintraregional infrastructure).  \nThe threshold at which one shifts from one regime to another is estimated as follows. \nEquation 2 is estimated for all the percentiles of the distribution of intraregional to \nextraregional trade costs by constructing a new dummy   for each percentile.

For countries with \nrelatively low intraregional to extraregional trade costs, the priority should be to reduce \nextraregional trade costs by investing in extraregional trade infrastructure so that the \nratio increases and leads to increased GDP per capita. In countries with relatively high \nintraregional to extraregional trade costs, the priority should be to reduce intraregional \ntrade costs by investing in intraregional infrastructure so that the ratio declines and \nleads to increased GDP per capita. These results confirm the theoretical predictions in \nMartin and Rogers (1995). \n5.  CONCLUSION \nThe  survey  of  the  literature  on  trade,  infrastructure,  and  development  shows  that  \ntrade openness has, on average, had a positive impact on economic growth, but  \nsome important heterogeneity across countries exists in this relationship. In particular, \nhow much countries benefit from further integration into global markets depends on  \nthe initial conditions in each country. Among these initial conditions, the quality of \ninfrastructure matters. Microeconometric and macroeconometric evidence shows that \nbetter national and international infrastructure lead to higher levels of trade. This is also \ntrue for both soft and hard infrastructure associated with trade facilitation. Importantly, \ntrade facilitation programs that aim to help small exporters have a large impact along \nthe product- and market-extensive margins of small firms.  \nHowever, as theoretically shown in a location model by Martin and Rogers (1995), \nmore trade does not necessarily mean higher economic activity in a country investing \nin international infrastructure. If countries with relatively poor national infrastructure and \ntherefore higher domestic production costs invest in international infrastructure, they \nwill  help  orient  the  relocation  of  firms  toward  other  countries  with  better  national \ninfrastructure and lower costs.  \n13 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M. Olarreaga \n \nUsing data on international trade costs estimated by Arvis et al. (2015), this paper \nfurther shows that this prediction is supported by data. Increases in the ratio of national \nto international trade costs hurt GDP per capita in countries with relatively high national \nto international trade costs, but helps GDP per capita in countries with relatively low \nnational  to  international  trade  costs.  This  implies  that  in  countries  with  relatively  \npoor national infrastructure relative to international infrastructure, the priority should  \nbe given to improvements in national rather than international infrastructure. Similarly, \nin  countries  with  relatively  poor  international  infrastructure  relative  to  national \ninfrastructure, the priority should be given to improvements in international rather than \nnational infrastructure. \nAnother  implication  of  the  Martin  and  Rogers  (1995)  model  is  that  investment  in  \nsoft  infrastructure  (e.g.,  trade facilitation  programs)  that  aim  to  help exporters  are \ngrowth-enhancing as long as they promote exports, which is supported by the existing \nempirical evidence. However, it is important to note that 90% of aid-for-trade is granted \nto hard infrastructure.  \nSustainable development by definition is much broader than economic growth. The \nimpact that investment in national versus international infrastructure may have on other \ndimensions of development is questionable. The relationship is unlikely to be linear, \nand further work should explore this question. Different trade-offs on investments in \ninfrastructure must also be noted and explored: quality versus quantity, maintenance \nversus  new  infrastructure,  financing  with  user  fees  versus  subsidies,  or  universal \nservices  versus  cost  efficiency.  The  answers  to  these  questions  are  likely  to  be \ncountry- and investment-specific and depend to a large extent on the development \nobjectives of each country.   \n14 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 626  M.

The empirical literature shows that, on average, trade causes growth, but the relationship is far from homogeneous across countries since initial conditions matter. Although the empirical literature shows that investment in soft and hard infrastructure has an unambiguously positive impact on trade flows, the theoretical literature argues that priority should be given to investments in national rather than international infrastructure in countries with relatively poor national infrastructure. This paper finds that data support this prediction.", "Title": "Trade, Infrastructure, and Development"}}
