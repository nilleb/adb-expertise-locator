Along  this  line,  this  paper  examines  the  sources  of  food  price \nfluctuations  in  11  developing  Asian  countries.  The  working  model  is  a  block \nvector autoregression (VAR), and 10 variables are classified into three blocks\u2014\nworld,  region,  and  country\u2014depending  on  their  origin  and  nature.  Empirical \nevidence  shows  that  the  regional  shock  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  explaining  the \nvariations of domestic food prices, particularly at medium- to long-term horizons. \nContrary to conventional belief, the world food price shock contributes little to the \ndynamics of domestic food prices in developing Asia. The findings suggest Asian \nfood  markets  are  more  integrated  regionally  than  with  the  world  market.  The \nshort-run  movements  of  domestic  food  prices  are  accounted  for  largely  by  the \ncountry\u2019s  own  shock.  Taken  together,  our  findings  suggest  that  promoting  food \nprice stability would require efforts at the regional level as well as at the domestic \nlevel,  reflecting  the  influence  of  region-specific  factors.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \nThe  world  witnessed  dramatic  increases  in  the  prices  of  major  agricultural  commodities  from \n2006 to 2009. Commonly referred to as the global food crisis, the food price surge in 2007\u20132008 \nwas phenomenal, registering an increase of more than 60% in 2 years. The crisis did not end \nthere,  as  the  global  food  price  rose  again  sharply  in  2010\u2014surpassing  the  2008  peak  before \nmoderating a bit beginning in the last quarter of 2011. \n\n \nSurging food prices in recent years have raised concerns about food security, especially \nwith their impact on the most vulnerable, i.e., poor households and their children. The upward \ntrend of food prices is likely to persist for some time, while the increased volatility of food prices \npresents an additional challenge. \n\n \nA  number  of  studies  have  identified  the  causes  and  consequences  of  surging  food \nprices. Trostle (2008) argues that the rapid expansion in global demand, rising crude oil prices, \nthe  depreciation  of  the  United  States  (US)  dollar,  and  other  microeconomic  factors  have  all \ncontributed to rising prices. Various actions taken by both exporters and importers in an attempt \nto  moderate  domestic  food  price  inflation  have  worsened  the  situation  by  tightening  market \nconditions.  Gilbert  and  Morgan  (2010)  suggest  additional  factors\u2014namely,  rapid  economic \ngrowth, especially in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and other Asian economies, and the \nspeculative  trade  in  agricultural  commodities\u2014that  play  in  such  price  dynamics.  Headey  and \nFan (2008), however, argue in their comprehensive and critical review that the role of the PRC \nand India may not be as great as suggested because both countries are relatively self-sufficient \nin their food supply. They are also skeptical that speculation in financial markets is a cause of \nthe  current  food  price  crisis  given  the  absence  of  clear  causal  linkages  between  futures  and \nspot prices. \n\n \nRegardless of the causes of the food price increase in recent years, the implications for \nthe economy and poverty are clear. Headey and Fan (2008) note that, at the macro level, the \nelevated  global  food  prices  would  have  an  impact  on  the  size  of  food  and  fuel  import  bills, \nexchange rate movements and foreign exchange reserves, pattern of food consumption, trade \nand marketing policies, and so on. Although the net effects on the domestic economic welfare \nwould depend on whether or not the economy is a net food importer or exporter, among various \nother country-specific factors, the impact would be nonetheless very large. \n\n \nTrostle  (2008)  notes  that  at  micro  levels,  a  price  increase  in  basic  necessities  could  \nbe  lethal  for  many  lower-income  consumers.  Using  a  simulation,  Ivanic  and  Martin  (2008)  \nfind  that,  in  low-income  countries,  poor  people  are  typically  net  consumers  of  food  and  are \ndisproportionally more affected by the food price increase. Beyond the direct income effect, high \nfood  prices  can  also  affect  household  welfare  through  various  other  indirect  channels.  For \nexample,  poor  households  strapped  with  reduced  real  income  may  decide  to  forego  their \nchildren\u2019s education, thus affecting human capital development. \n\n \nA  good  understanding  of  the  determinants  of  food  price  inflation  and  its  volatility  is \nfundamental  to  designing  an  appropriate  policy  framework  to  deal  with  these  issues.  In  this \ncontext, this paper aims to identify the underlying causes of food price fluctuations in developing \nAsian countries. The paper will focus on the relative importance of external and internal factors \nin determining food prices in emerging and developing Asia. Particularly given that most of the \ncountries under consideration are small open economies, the focus of interest would be on the \ntransmission of external shocks to domestic food prices. \n\n \n\n\f2   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nThis paper adds to the previous literature that examined the integration and transmission \nmechanism  of  food  prices  between  international  and  domestic  markets.  Many  earlier  studies  \non  international  food  price  transmission  focused  on  the  movement  of  food  prices  only,  and  \ndid not go further to identify the sources of food price fluctuation. When it comes to the policy \nlevel, however, understanding the driving forces of food prices is important, as different sources \nof  food  price  fluctuation  would  require  different  policy  measures.  Further,  previous  studies  on \ndetermining  food  prices  were  largely  based  on  single-equation  approaches  or  small-scale \nsystems  typically  consisting  of  two  to  three  variables.  As  such,  they  may  be  limited  in  \nfully  reflecting  the  interaction  among  variables  and  uncovering  the  factors  underlying  the \ndetermination of food prices. \n\n \nThe  present  paper  develops  an  extended  model  that  contains  a  large  set  of \n10 international  and  domestic  variables.  The  working  model  is  a  block  vector  autoregression \n(VAR)  as  in  Cushman  and  Zha  (1997),  Zha  (1999),  Peersman  (2004),  and  Lastrapes  (2005). \nThe  10  variables  are  classified  into  three  blocks\u2014world,  regional,  and country\u2014depending  on \ntheir origin and nature. The blocks are identified using block exogeneity assumptions consistent \nwith  the  economic  theory.  By  construction,  each  country  is  subject  to  identical  world  and \nregional shocks, and this makes it possible to compare the results across countries at the same \nbase. The block exogeneity assumptions also help to conserve the degrees of freedom, which \nare desperately needed for studies like this paper having a relatively short span of time series \ndata. Once the model is structurally identified, we will be able to examine the effects and relative \nimportance  of  underlying  shocks  in  accounting  for  movements  in  domestic  food  prices.  Based \nupon the results, some policy suggestions can be drawn with a view to enhancing the stability of \nfood prices in the region. \n\n \nThe  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  discusses  our  model \nspecification  and  estimation  strategy.  In  Section  III,  the  empirical  applications  to  developing \nAsian  countries  are  presented.  Section  IV  undertakes  a  set  of  tests  to  assess  the  robustness  \nof  the  results.  In  Section  V,  the  model  is  applied  to  the  countries  in  other  regions,  and  the \nimplications are compared with those from developing Asia. Section VI concludes. \n\n \n \n\n \n\nII. MODEL SPECIFICATION \n\nSeveral econometric techniques have been employed to assess the extent to which world prices \naffect domestic prices. For example, Mundlak and Larson (1992) apply a regression technique \nfor  modeling  the  effects  of  world  agricultural  commodity  prices.  However,  this  was  criticized  \nby  later  studies  because  the  relationship  between  domestic  and  world  prices  was  analyzed  in  \na static framework. It was suggested that some dynamics be included, since price adjustments \nusually  do  not  happen  instantaneously  but  take  time.  Quiroz  and  Soto  (1995),  Baffes  and \nGardner  (2003),  and  Imai,  Gaiha,  and  Thapa  (2008)  propose  error  correction  models  to  \ntake  price  dynamics  into  account,  and  to  test  short-  and  long-run  adjustments.  A  vector  error \ncorrection  model  is  also  postulated  to  better  capture  the  dynamics  among  prices.  Conforti \n(2004)  and  Minot  (2011)  employ  a  two-variable  vector  error  correction  model  to  test  the \ninternational  transmission  of  food  prices  to  domestic  prices.  While  the  use  of  vector  error \ncorrection  models  is  certainly  rewarding,  most  of  them  are  based  on  single-equation \napproaches or small-scale systems typically consisting of two to three variables. As such, they \nmay be limited in fully reflecting interactions among variables and uncovering factors underlying \nthe determination of food prices. \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   3 \n\nThe present paper attempts to resolve this difficulty by using the block VAR framework. \nSpecifically, our VAR model contains a large set of 10 international and domestic variables, and \nexamines how and to what extent these variables affect food prices over time. The 10 variables \nare classified into three blocks\u2014world, region, and country\u2014depending their origin and nature. \nThe variables in the world block control for changes in world demand and food supply: \n\n \n1.  Oil prices have a considerable impact on the production and transportation costs of \n\nagricultural commodities, hence affecting the supply side of food. \n\n2.  World  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  reflects  the  general  conditions  of  the  world \n\neconomy, and thus the demand for food. \n\n3.  World food price should naturally reflect the balance between the world demand for \n\n4. \n\nand world supply of food. \nFood price futures have been included on the basis of previous studies, suggesting \nthat  speculative  trading  in  agricultural  commodities  may  have  played  a  role  in \nrecent food price surges. While there is a causality argument, the model can test \nwhether futures markets have contributed to stabilizing or destabilizing food prices. \n\n \nThe  regional  block  represents  the  Asian  economy,  and  includes  Asian  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) and Asian food prices. The country block comprises four domestic variables that \ncan affect food price: (i) the exchange rate against the dollar, which can affect local food prices \nby altering import prices, (ii) M1 money supply, included to reflect inflationary pressures on the \ngeneral price level, (iii) real GDP per capita, and (iv) the domestic food price. More details of the \ndata are provided in the next section. \n\n \nThe  underlying  shocks  in  the  block  VAR  model  are  identified  using  the  following \n\nrestrictions: \n\n \n1.  None of the shocks in the regional and country blocks affect variables in the world \nblock  throughout  the  whole  sample  period.  On  the  other  hand,  the  shocks  in  the \nworld  block  can  have  an  impact  on  variables  in  the  regional  and  country  blocks. \nThat  is,  the world  block is  assumed to  be  exogenous  to  the  regional  and  country \nblocks. \nThe shocks in the regional block can influence variables in the country block, while \nthe shocks in the country block cannot affect those in the regional block over the \nentire  sample  period.  The  regional  block  is  assumed  to  be  exogenous  to  the \ncountry block. \n\n2. \n\n3.  Within the block, the individual shocks are identified by assuming the Choleski-type \n\nrecursive ordering of the variables. \n\n \nBy the block exogeneity assumptions in (1) and (2), each country is subject to identical \nworld  and  regional  shocks,  and  this  feature  allows  us  to  compare  the  responses  across  the \ncountries at the same base. The model is estimated by seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), \ndeveloped by Zellner (1962), and is estimated in levels. We did not perform an explicit analysis \nof  the  long-run  behavior  of  the  economy  due  to  the  short  span  of  data.  Yet,  by  doing  the \nanalysis  in  levels,  we  allow  for  implicit  co-integrating  relationships  in  the  data  and  still  have \nconsistent estimates of the parameters (Sims, Stock, and Watson 1990; Peersman 2004). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f4   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nIII. EMPIRICAL RESULTS \n \n\nData \n\nA. \n \nEmpirical  analysis  was  undertaken  for  11  developing  Asian  countries:  the  PRC;  Hong  Kong, \nChina;  India;  Indonesia;  the  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  the  Philippines;  Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n\n \nThe sample period begins with the first quarter (Q1) of 1995, the earliest period when all \ndata are available, and ends with Q3 2011. Definitions of the data series are as follows. Starting \nfrom the variables in the world block, the oil price (POILUS) is the average of the prices of UK \nBrent,  Dubai,  and  West  Texas  Intermediate,  obtained  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF)  International  Financial  Statistics.  World  GDP  (WR_GDP)  was  obtained  by  summing  up \nthe  real  GDP  of  the  US  and  the  European  Union  (EU)  from  Global  Insight  (http://www \n.ihsglobalinsight.com)  and  accounts  for  about  50%  of  world  GDP  according  to  the  2010 \nstatistics  of  the  IMF.  For  world  food  price  (WR_FDP),  we  used  the  world  food  price  index \ncompiled  by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO;  http://www \n.fao.org).\u00a0The Dow Jones-UBS agriculture subindex (http://www.djindexes.com/commodity) was \nused to represent food price futures (FUTURE), and is depicted in Figure 1. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Food Price Futures: Dow Jones-UBS Agriculture Subindex, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\nSource: Dow Jones. http://www.djindexes.com/commodity \n\n \n \nMoving to the regional block, Asian GDP (AS_GDP) was calculated by summing up the \nreal GDPs of the 11 countries under study. The Asian food price (AS_FDP) was constructed by \napplying  the  principal  component  analysis  to  the  food  price  indexes  of  these  countries,  which \nwill  be  described  in  Section  III-B.  Finally,  the  individual  food  prices  in  the  country  block  were \nobtained from various sources: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD) for the PRC, Indonesia, and the Republic of Korea; CEIC for Hong Kong, China; India; \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   5 \n\nthe Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam; and Bloomberg for Malaysia. \nThese  variables  are  named  XX_FDP,  where  XX  is  the  two-letter  country  identifier  (e.g., \nCN_FDP for the PRC, HK_FDP for Hong Kong, China, and so on). The same naming system \napplies to the other three country variables of US exchange rates (XX_USR), M1 money supply \n(XX_MON),  and  real  GDP  (XX_GDP).  The  data  were  all  taken  from  Global  Insight.  For  each \ncountry,  real  GDP  was  divided  by  population  to  arrive  at  per  capita  values.  Quarterly  data  on \npopulation  were  obtained  by  interpolating  the  annual  series  from  World  Population  Prospects: \nThe  2010  Revision  (United  Nations  Department  of  Economics  and  Social  Affairs,  Population \nDivision  2011),  through  the  INTERPOL  procedure  in  the  econometric  software  RATS.  All \nvariables are expressed in logarithms. For each country, the block VAR model in Section II was \nestimated with a constant and a linear trend, and the lag length was set at 3 in all cases. \n \nB. \n\nFood Price Index for Asia (AS_FDP) \n \n\nFigure 2 depicts the food price indexes of the 11 Asian countries being studied. The FAO world \nprice index (WR_FDP) is also presented for comparison. It is quite apparent that the food prices \nof  most  Asian  countries  exhibit  different  patterns  from  the  world  price.  They  are  also  less \nvolatile\u2014except  for  Indonesia,  during  the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  and  Viet  Nam  since  the \nsecond half of the first decade of the 2000s. A question arises whether such deviations from the \nworld price movement are common among Asian food prices. One way of addressing this issue \nis to check composite indicators that can represent co-movements of Asian food prices. Since \nthere is no such measure available in the literature, we decided to construct one. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2A: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and the People\u2019s Republic of China,  \n1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nFigure 2B: Food Price Indexes: World; Asia; and Hong Kong, China, 1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n \n \n\nFigure 2C: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and India, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   7 \n\nFigure 2D: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and Indonesia, 1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors' calculations. \n\nFigure 2E: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and the Republic of Korea, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\n\f8   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nFigure 2F: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and Malaysia, 1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \nFigure 2G: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and the Philippines, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   9 \n\nFigure 2H: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and Singapore, 1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors' calculations \n\nFigure 2I: Food Price Indexes: World; Asia; and Taipei,China, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n\n\f10   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nFigure 2J: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and Thailand, 1995\u20132011 \n\nSource: Authors' calculations. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2K: Food Price Indexes: World, Asia, and Viet Nam, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Authors' calculations. \n\n \n \nAmong  several  methods  in  the  literature,  we  adopted  a  principal  component  analysis, \nwhich  summarizes  how  different  variables  change  in  relation  to  each  other,  and  how  they  \nare  associated.  The  principal  component  analysis  groups  together  variables  that  are  collinear  \nto  form  principal  components  capable  of  capturing  as  much  common  information  among  \nthose  variables  as  possible.

These  results  are  for  the  five  principal  components \nwith the largest eigenvalues. The remaining six components contribute virtually nothing and are \nnot  reported.  The  first  principal  component  corresponding  to  the  largest  eigenvalue  of  10.36 \naccounts for 94% of the total variation and over 90% of the variation in the individual food prices \nof all countries except Hong Kong, China (80%). The second largest eigenvalue is 0.42, and the \ncorresponding  principal  component  explains  an  additional  4%  of  the  total  variation.  Since  the \nsecond  principal  component  adds  no  significant  gain,  we  constructed  a  food  price  index  for  \nAsia  using  only  the  first  principal  component  having  the  highest  eigenvalue.  Selecting  this \nprincipal  component  is  in  compliance  with  the  convention  mentioned  earlier;  further,  it  is \nconsistent with the Kaiser criterion, which is commonly employed for determining the number of \nprincipal  components  to  retain.  The  Kaiser  criterion  recommends  that  the  components  whose \neigenvalues  are  greater  than  1  be  used  to  summarize  the  data  and  hence,  the  components \nwhose eigenvalues are less than 1 can be discarded for the sake of efficiency. \n\n \n\n\f12   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \nThe  Asian  food  price  index  generated  is  depicted  in  various  panels  of  Figure  2  along \nwith  price  indexes  in  individual  countries.  Clearly,  the  Asian  food  price  moved  in  a  noticeably \ndifferent way compared to the world price. It has risen persistently since 1995, and the values \nexhibit less volatility over the entire sample period. In particular, while the Asian food price also \nrose  during  the  2008  price  spike  and  the  recent  price  surges,  the  increase  was  much  smaller \nthan  the  world  price.  Figures  2A  to  2K  also  indicate  that  food  prices  in  individual  countries  in \nAsia moved in tandem more with the Asian food price than the world price. \n\n \nSeveral  studies  have  tried  to  explain  why  Asian  food  prices  rose  less  than  the  world \nprice.  According  to  Dawe  (2008),  the  accompanying  depreciation  of  the    dollar  neutralized  a \nconsiderable  portion  of  the  transmitted  increase  from  world  prices  to  many  Asian  markets. \nByerlee, Jayne, and Myers (2006) argue that, although low-income rice and wheat importers are \nexposed  to  world  price  shocks  the  most,  Asian  countries  are  in  a  better  position  to  weather \nworld price shocks, thanks to improved infrastructure and abundant foreign exchange reserves. \nHeadey  and  Fan  (2008)  conclude  that  the  full  transmission  of  international  prices  might  not  \ntake place since local governments aim at dampening price increases, especially in developing \ncountries. \n\n \nVariance Decompositions \n\nC. \n \nTable  2  reports  the  forecast  error  variance  decompositions  of  food  prices.  Figures  are  the \npercentage contributions of the structural shocks to the forecast error variance in the food price \nat  various  horizons.  Beginning  with  the  Asian  food  price  in  the  top  panel,  we  find  it  to  be  the \nmost influential shock, accounting for over 80% of the total variation across the horizons. On the \nother  hand,  the  world  food  price  shock  contributed  less  than  2%  of  the  price  variation.  An \nimplication is that the Asian food price as a whole is little affected by changes in the world food \nprice. The contribution of shocks to oil prices and to food price futures was also minimal. This is \nin contrast to some studies that point to oil prices and food price futures as potential causes of \nthe  food  price  surges.  Among  the  four  world  shocks,  the  world  GDP  shock  was  the  only  one \nexhibiting  some  significance  in  explaining  the  Asian  food  price.  By  construction,  none  of  the \ncountry shocks were allowed to have an impact on the Asian food price at all horizons. \n\n \nThe remaining panels report the forecast error variance decompositions for the domestic \nfood prices of 11 countries. The results appear to be similar to those for the common regional \nfood price. The world food price shock contributes virtually nothing to explaining the variation in \ndomestic food prices of most Asian countries. The same is true for the shocks to oil prices and \nfood  price  futures.  The  key  finding  is  that  the  Asian  food  price  shock  played  a  pivotal  role  in \ndetermining  domestic  food  prices.  The  evidence  is  particularly  strong  at  medium  to  long \nhorizons. The data for countries such as the PRC; India; Indonesia; Malaysia; the Philippines; \nTaipei,China;  Thailand;  and  Viet  Nam  show  that  the  Asian  food  price  shock  was  the  most \nimportant  or  equally  as  important  as  the  other  shocks  in  the  model  in  explaining  the  long-run \nvariability of their food prices. A shock to world GDP also accounted for a significant fraction of \nthe  forecast  error  variance  in  the  food  prices  of  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines, \nSingapore, and Thailand. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   13 \n\n \ne\ng\na\np\n \nt\nx\ne\nn\n \nn\no\n \nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n1\n1\n0\n2\n\u2013\n5\n9\n9\n1\n \n,\ns\ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\nd\no\no\nF\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\nm\no\nc\ne\nD\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nV\n\n \n:\n2\n\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nT\n\n \n)\n\n%\n\n(\n\n \n\n\f14   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \n\nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n \n2\n \ne\nb\na\nT\n\nl\n\ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\n\n \n\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\n\n \n\n \n\nP\nD\nF\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nl\ni\n\no\n \n\n=\n\n \n\nS\nU\nL\nI\nO\nP\n\n \n,\ns\ne\nr\nu\nt\nu\nf\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \n\n=\n\n \n\nE\nR\nU\nT\nU\nF\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n\n \n\ni\n\nn\na\ns\nA\n\n \n\n=\n\n \n\nP\nD\nG\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \n\ni\n\nn\na\ns\nA\n\n \n\n=\n\n \n\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n \n.\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\ne\n \nS\nU\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nR\nS\nU\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\nl\n\n \n,\ny\np\np\nu\ns\n \ny\ne\nn\no\nm\n \n1\nM\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nN\nO\nM\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \ny\nr\nt\n\n \n\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n\ni\n\ng\nn\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\nu\np\nm\no\nc\n \ns\nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nr\na\n \ns\ne\ns\ne\nh\nt\nn\ne\nr\na\np\n \n\nn\n\ni\n \ns\ne\nr\nu\ng\nF\n\ni\n\n \n.\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nv\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nt\ns\na\nc\ne\nr\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \no\nt\n \ns\nk\nc\no\nh\ns\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\n\nn\no\nc\n \n\ne\ng\na\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n\n \n\ne\nh\n\nt\n \ns\nt\nr\no\np\ne\nr\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nt\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\no\nN\n\n \n \n.\n0\n \nn\na\nh\nt\n \nr\ne\nt\na\ne\nr\ng\n \nt\nu\nb\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n \n1\n.\n0\n \no\nt\n \nl\na\nu\nq\ne\n \nr\no\n \nn\na\nh\nt\n \ns\ns\ne\nl\n \ns\ni\n \nt\na\nh\nt\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ns\ne\nt\no\nn\ne\nd\n \n1\n.\n\n0\n\n \n\ne\nr\nu\ng\n\ni\nf\n \n\ne\nh\nT\n\n \n.\nl\n\ne\nd\no\nm\ne\nh\n\n \n\nt\n \nf\n\no\n\n \ns\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\na\nc\n\ni\nl\n\np\ne\nr\n \np\na\nr\nt\ns\nt\no\no\nb\n \n0\n0\n5\n\n \n.\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nl\n\nl\n\na\nu\nc\na\nc\n \n\u2019\ns\nr\no\nh\nt\nu\nA\n\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   15 \n\n \n\nThe  short-run  movement  of  domestic  food  prices  was  accounted  for  largely  by  its  own \nshock  across  the  countries.  While  there  are  several  possible  reasons,  one  of  them  would  be \nassociated with the policies that governments implement in order to dampen the impact of world \nfood price changes on the domestic markets. For example, the PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam \nhave  been  imposing  restrictions  on  rice  exports  or  have  been  raising  export  taxes.  The  PRC \nand Indonesia have also reduced import barriers on food and have cut domestic food taxes. In \naddition,  the  PRC  and  Thailand  hold  considerable  amounts  of  rice  stocks  in  order  to  stabilize \nthe  market  condition  (Brahmbhatt  and  Christiaensen  2008).  The  strong  influence  of  domestic \nfood price shocks weakens as the horizon increases. \n\n \nThe  other  domestic  shocks  did  not  exhibit  a  significant  impact  on  the  food  prices.  Yet, \ntwo  notable  exceptions\u2014the  PRC  and  Hong  Kong,  China\u2014merit  discussion.  Here,  the \nexchange rate shock is shown to be the most important in accounting for the variation of their \nfood prices, while its importance appears to be minimal in all the other countries. This difference \nmay be partly due to the differences in the exchange rate systems. Unlike other economies that \nhave  adopted  floating  exchange  rates,  Hong  Kong,  China  operates  a  fixed  exchange  rate \nregime by pegging its currency to the dollar. From 1995 to 2005, the PRC currency, the yuan, \nwas  also  pegged  to  the    dollar.  In  July  2005,  the  PRC  announced  a  shift  in  its  exchange  rate \nregime to a managed float, tying the value of the yuan to a broad basket of foreign currencies. \nHowever,  the  yuan\u2019s  movement  in  relation  to  that  of  the  dollar  has  been  relatively  stable \ncompared to those of other regional currencies. The cases of the PRC and Hong Kong, China \nsuggest  that  under  the  fixed  or  managed  exchange  rate  regimes,  local  food  prices  may  be \naffected more directly by changes in the exchange rate. \n\n \nImpulse Responses \n\nD. \n \nFigure 3 shows the dynamic responses of the Asian food price to a unit change in the structural \nshocks.  Also  depicted  are  one-standard  error  confidence  bands  generated  by  500  bootstrap \nreplications of the model. The Asian food price rose significantly over all horizons in response to \na  shock  that  raised  oil  prices.  This  is  much  anticipated  because  a  rise  in  oil  prices  raises \nproduction  and  transport  costs.  The  responses  to  the  other  shocks  were  also  sensible.  A \npositive  world  GDP  shock  increased  the  demand  for  food,  leading  to  a  rise  in  the  Asian  food \nprice. The Asian food price increased significantly, given disturbances raising world and Asian \nfood  prices.  A  possible  exception  is  that  a  positive  Asian  GDP  shock  reduces  the  Asian  food \nprice at short horizons. While it is hard to reconcile, the responses are statistically insignificant \nexcept for horizons of 1 and 2 quarters. Note that, by construction, shocks in the country block \ncannot affect the Asian food price at all horizons, and hence, the responses to these shocks are \nnot presented. \n \nTo save space, the impulse responses for domestic food prices are not reported, but the \nmain findings can be summarized as follows. These responses to world and regional shocks are \nsimilar to those obtained for the Asian food price. Positive shocks to oil prices, world GDP, world \nfood prices, and Asian food prices all led to a rise in the domestic food prices of most countries. \nAn exception is the food price of Hong Kong, China, in which the responses to the Asian food \nshock  fell  significantly  after  a  short  rise.  The  Asian  GDP  shock  continued  to  produce  rather \nunappealing responses. For several countries, the domestic food prices initially declined before \nmoving up toward its long-run levels in response to a positive Asian GDP shock. These short-\nrun  responses  are  mostly  insignificant,  but  they  are  strong  and  persistent  in  Malaysia  and  the \nPhilippines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nFigure 3: Responses of Asian Food Price to Structural Shocks, 1995\u20132011 \n(Responses of Asian Food Prices to a Unit Change in Structural Variables) \n\n \n\nAS_FDP  =  Asian  food  price,  AS_GDP  =  Asian  gross  domestic  product,  FUTURE  =  food  price  futures,  POILUS  =  oil  price,  \nWR_FDP = world food price, WR_GDP = world gross domestic product. \n\nNote:  Shown  around  each  response  (in  light  gray)  is  the  one-standard  error  confidence  interval  generated  by  500 bootstrap \nreplications. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \nAs regards the responses to the country shocks, a positive shock to the exchange rate \ncaused  most  domestic  food  prices  to  rise  at  short  horizons.  This  is  intuitively  clear  since  an \nincrease  in  the  exchange  rate  represents  a  depreciation  of  domestic  currency.  The  effects \nflatten  out  as  the  horizon  increases.  The  domestic  food  prices  also  rose  in  response  to  a \npositive  money  supply  shock,  presumably  due  to  inflationary  effects.  In  Malaysia  and  the \nPhilippines,  the  responses  look  peculiar,  but  they  are  insignificant  at  almost  all  horizons.  A \npositive  shock  to  domestic  GDP  increased  the  demand  for  food  and  hence,  raised  the  food \nprice.  In  the  case  of  the  Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Taipei,China,  food  prices  fell  instead  at \nshort  horizons,  but  these  responses  are  not  statistically  significant.  The  food  price  rose  in \nresponse  to  its  own  shocks  in  all  countries,  and  the  effects  were  strong  and  statistically \nsignificant particularly at short horizons. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   17 \n\nIV. ROBUSTNESS CHECK \n\n \nDifferent model specifications can lead to different implications. It is thus important to check how \nrobust  the  results  drawn  in  Section  III  are  when  compared  to  other  model  specifications.  This \nsection  undertakes  a  set  of  experiments  to  address  robustness  issues.  The  first  experiment \nemployed an alternative measure of the Asian food price for representing common movements \nin the food prices of the Asian countries. The second experiment examined possible effects of \nthe Asian currency crisis, which hit many countries in the region during 1997\u20131998. In the final \nexperiment,  the  ordering  of  variables  in  the  country  block  was  altered  to  see  how  the  results \nwould  be  affected.  Against  these  alternative  models,  the  one  presented  in  Sections  II  and  III \nwas designated as the baseline model in the subsequent analysis. \n \nA. \n\nAn Alternative Asian Food Price Index \n \n\nAn  alternative  composite  food  price  index  for  Asia  was  constructed  by  applying  the  weighting \nprocedure of the National Bureau of Economic  Research (NBER) to the same 11 food prices. \nThe  NBER  method  has  been  widely  used  in  business  cycle  analysis  for  identifying  and \nanticipating  turning  points:  for  example,  a  list  of  economic  indicators  by  the  OECD,  the \nConference Board, and the Economic Cycle Research Institute. This measure of the Asian food \nprice (AS_FDP_NBER) is depicted in Figure 4 with the index constructed through the principal \ncomponent  analysis  (AS_FDP_PC)  for  comparison.  The  figure  shows  that  both  Asian  food \nindexes moved very closely together. \n\n \nTable 3 reports the forecast error variance decompositions of Asian and domestic food \nprices when the model is reestimated using AS_FDP_NBER as a proxy for the Asian food price \nAS_FDP.  In  comparison  to  the  baseline  model,  there  was  not  much  change  in  the  relative \ncontribution  of  the  shocks  for  explaining  the  variation  of  the  Asian  food  price.  The  Asian  food \nprice shock was the most significant, accounting for between 77% and 88% of the forecast error \nvariance at all horizons. The contribution of the world food price shock remained minimal. The \nresults  are  also  virtually  unchanged  for  the  food  prices  of  individual  countries.  In  fact,  the \ncontribution of Asian food price shocks tends to increase, with the effects particularly noticeable \nin  India,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  and  Singapore.  The  shocks  to  world  GDP  and \ndomestic  food  prices  were  less  important.  To  sum  up,  the  Asian  food  price  shock  remains \ninfluential  in  accounting  for  the  variations  of  domestic  food  prices  when  AS_FDP_NBER  is \nalternatively adopted. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \n\n \ne\ng\na\np\n \nt\nx\ne\nn\n \nn\no\n \nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n\n \n\n \n1\n1\n0\n2\n\u2013\n5\n9\n9\n1\n \n,\ns\ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\nd\no\no\nF\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\nm\no\nc\ne\nD\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nV\n\n \n:\n3\n \ne\nl\nb\na\nT\n\n \n)\n\n%\n\n(\n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   19 \n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nl\ni\n\no\n \n\n \n\n=\nS\nU\nL\nI\nO\nP\n\n \n,\ns\ne\nr\nu\nt\nu\nf\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \n\n \n\n=\nE\nR\nU\nT\nU\nF\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n \n.\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\ne\n \nS\nU\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nR\nS\nU\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\nl\n\n \n,\ny\np\np\nu\ns\n \ny\ne\nn\no\nm\n \n1\nM\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nN\nO\nM\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \ny\nr\nt\n\n \n\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n\ne\nm\ne\nh\nc\ns\n \ng\nn\ni\nt\nh\ng\ne\nw\nR\nE\nB\nN\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ng\nn\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\nc\nu\nr\nt\ns\nn\no\nc\n \nx\ne\nd\nn\ni\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ne\nh\nw\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nv\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nt\ns\na\nc\ne\nr\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \no\nt\n \ns\nk\nc\no\nh\ns\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\n\nn\no\nc\n \n\ne\ng\na\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n\n \n\ne\nh\n\nt\n \ns\nt\nr\no\np\ne\nr\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nt\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\no\nN\n\n1\n.\n0\n \ne\nr\nu\ng\ni\nf\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n.\nl\ne\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\n\ni\nl\n\ni\n\np\ne\nr\n \np\na\nr\nt\ns\nt\no\no\nb\n \n0\n0\n5\n \ng\nn\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\nu\np\nm\no\nc\n \ns\nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nr\na\n \ns\ne\ns\ne\nh\nt\nn\ne\nr\na\np\n \nn\n\ni\n \ns\ne\nr\nu\ng\nF\n\ni\n\n \n.\n\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n\ne\nh\n\nt\n \nr\no\n\nf\n \ny\nx\no\nr\np\n\n \n\na\n\n \ns\na\n\n \n\nd\ne\ns\nu\n\n \ns\n\ni\n \n)\n\nR\nE\nB\nN\n_\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n(\n\n \n.\n0\n \nn\na\nh\nt\n \nr\ne\nt\na\ne\nr\ng\n \nt\nu\nb\n \n%\n1\n.\n0\n \no\nt\n \nl\na\nu\nq\ne\n \nr\no\n\n \n\nn\na\nh\n\nt\n \ns\ns\ne\n\nl\n \ns\ni\n \nt\n\na\nh\n\nt\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n\n \n\nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\n\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ns\ne\nt\no\nn\ne\nd\n\n \n.\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nl\n\nl\n\na\nu\nc\na\nc\n \n\u2019\ns\nr\no\nh\nt\nu\nA\n\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n \n\nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n \n3\n \ne\nb\na\nT\n\nl\n\n \n\n\f20   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Asia Food Price Indexes, 1995\u20132011 \n\n \n\nAS_FDP_PC  =  Asian  food  prices  constructed  through  the  principal  component  analysis,  AS_FDP_NBER  =  Asian  food  prices \nconstructed with the National Bureau of Economic Research weighting procedure. \n\nSource: Authors\u2019 calculations. \n\n \n \nThe Role of the Asian Currency Crisis \n\nB. \n \nThe  Asian  currency  crisis  in  1997\u20131998  caused  severe  economic  downturns  in  many  Asian \neconomies. It is often argued that the resulting co-movement has exaggerated the importance \nof  regional  shocks  relative  to  world  shocks  in  explaining  economic  fluctuations  in  Asian \neconomies.  Some  also  predict  that  the  world  shocks  should  regain  influence  as  the  Asian \neconomies  recover  to  their  precrisis  levels  (Zhang,  Sato,  and  McAleer  2004;  Lee  and  \nKoh 2012). \n \n\nIn light of this, we examined whether the Asian currency crisis has affected the results \nconcerning the determination of food prices. The crisis is taken into account by augmenting the \nmodel  with  a  dummy,  which  assigns  a  value  of  1  for  the  period  of  Q3  1997\u2013Q4  1998,  and  0 \notherwise.  Estimation  results  are  provided  in  Table  4.  Across  countries,  there  is  no  visible \ndifference  in  the  variance  decompositions  of  food  prices  relative  to  those  from  the  baseline \nmodel.  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  Philippines  show  some  changes,  yet  the \neffects  were  marginal  and  not  strong  enough  to  revoke  the  main  findings.  Overall,  there  is  no \nmajor  variation  generated  when  the  model  includes  the  dummy  variable  reflecting  the  Asian \ncurrency crisis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   21 \n\n \ne\ng\na\np\n \nt\nx\ne\nn\n \nn\no\n \nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n\n \n)\n\n%\n\n(\n\n \n\n \n1\n1\n0\n2\n\u2013\n5\n9\n9\n1\n \n,\ns\ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\nd\no\no\nF\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\nm\no\nc\ne\nD\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nV\n\n \n:\n4\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nT\n\n \n\n\f22   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \n\nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n \n4\n \ne\nb\na\nT\n\nl\n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nl\ni\n\no\n \n\n \n\n=\nS\nU\nL\nI\nO\nP\n\n \n,\ns\ne\nr\nu\nt\nu\nf\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \n\n \n\n=\nE\nR\nU\nT\nU\nF\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n \n.\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\ne\n \nS\nU\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nR\nS\nU\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\nl\n\n \n,\ny\np\np\nu\ns\n \ny\ne\nn\no\nm\n \n1\nM\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nN\nO\nM\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \ny\nr\nt\n\n \n\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\na\ns\nA\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nt\nn\nu\no\nc\nc\na\n \ne\nk\na\nt\n \no\nt\n \ny\nm\nm\nu\nd\n \na\n \ns\ne\nd\nu\nc\nn\ni\n \nl\ne\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ne\nh\nw\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nv\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nt\ns\na\nc\ne\nr\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \no\nt\n \ns\nk\nc\no\nh\ns\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\n\nn\no\nc\n \n\ne\ng\na\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n\n \n\ne\nh\n\nt\n \ns\nt\nr\no\np\ne\nr\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nt\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\no\nN\n\ns\ns\ne\nl\n \ns\ni\n \nt\na\nh\nt\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ns\ne\nt\no\nn\ne\nd\n \n1\n.\n0\n \ne\nr\nu\ng\ni\nf\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n.\nl\ne\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\n\ni\nl\n\ni\n\np\ne\nr\n \np\na\nr\nt\ns\nt\no\no\nb\n \n0\n0\n5\n \ng\nn\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\nu\np\nm\no\nc\n \ns\nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\n\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n\n \n\ne\nr\na\n\n \ns\ne\ns\ne\nh\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nr\na\np\n\n \n\nn\n\ni\n \ns\ne\nr\nu\ng\nF\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n.\ns\ns\ni\nr\nc\n \ny\nc\nn\ne\nr\nr\nu\nc\n\n \n.\n\n0\n\n \n\nn\na\nh\n\nt\n \nr\ne\n\nt\n\na\ne\nr\ng\n\n \nt\n\n \n\nu\nb\n%\n1\n\n.\n\n0\n\n \n\no\n\nt\n \nl\na\nu\nq\ne\n \nr\no\n \nn\na\nh\nt\n\n \n.\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nl\n\nl\n\na\nu\nc\na\nc\n \n\u2019\ns\nr\no\nh\nt\nu\nA\n\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   23 \n\nOrdering of the Variables in the Country Block\u00a0\n\nC. \n \nThe  shocks  in  the  country  block  were  identified  by  assuming  the  Choleski-type  recursive \nordering.  Accordingly,  the  shocks  can  be  identified  differently,  and  the  model  can  produce \ndifferent results, if the ordering of the variables alters. To study this possibility, we experimented \nwith a different ordering of the variables in the country block. In the current setting, the variables \nare  ordered  by  the  exchange  rate,  money  supply,  real  GDP,  and  domestic  food  price.  All \ndomestic shocks are allowed to have contemporaneous effects on its food price. An alternative \nordering places the food price first, followed by the exchange rate, money supply, and real GDP. \nUnder this structure, the domestic food price is not affected by any of the domestic shocks other \nthan itself contemporaneously. \n \n\nThe  corresponding  forecast  error  variance  decompositions  of  domestic  food  prices  are \nreported in Table 5. Note that the alternative ordering of the variables did not affect the forecast \nerror variance decomposition of the Asian food price by the block exogeneity assumptions. The \nresults are quite straightforward to interpret. The relative contribution of the shocks in explaining \nthe  variation  in  the  food  prices  did  not  vary  much  from  the  baseline  model.  There  are  small \nchanges for India and the Philippines in that the fraction of the variation accounted for by its own \nprice  shock  somewhat  increased  at  short  horizons.  The  domestic  GDP  shock  becomes  less \nimportant.  All  this  evidence  is  weak  and  does  not  substantiate  the  fact  that  the  results  are \nsensitive to the alternative ordering of variables under consideration. \n\n \n \n\nV. ANALYZING OTHER REGIONS \n\n \nIn this section, we extend the analysis to countries in other regions to check whether and how \nthe results vary across the regions. The countries considered are Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, \nHungary,  Moldova,  Poland,  Romania,  the  Russian  Federation,  the  Slovak  Republic,  and \nUkraine  in  emerging  Europe;  Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  Colombia,  Mexico,  Paraguay,  Peru, \nUruguay, and Venezuela in Latin America; Botswana,  C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, \nNigeria, and South Africa in Sub-Saharan Africa; Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, and Turkey in \nthe  Middle  East;  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Ireland,  Italy,  the  Netherlands,  and  Spain  in  the \neurozone. Also included for comparison are the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, \nJapan, the UK, and the US. For each country, the model in Section II is estimated, and the data \ndescriptions  and  the  sample  period  are  the  same  as  in  Section  III.  The  composite  food  price \nindex for each region is constructed through the principal component analysis. \n \n\nTable  6  summarizes  the  results  of  variance  decompositions  for  the  food  prices  of  the \ndifferent  countries.  Figures  reported  are  regional  averages,  obtained  by  averaging  the \npercentage contributions of the structural shocks to the forecast error variance in the domestic \nfood  price  over  the  horizons  up  to  24  quarters,  and  then,  over  the  member  countries  in  the \nregion. We restrict the discussion to these regional averages, but the results for each member \ncountry are available upon request. Beginning with the developing Asia region, the Asian food \nprice  shock  is  the  most  important,  accounting  for  33%  of  the  variation  in  the  domestic  food \nprices.  The  domestic  food  price  shock  comes  second.  These  are  the  results  expected  in  \nSection III, in which shocks to Asian and domestic food prices were found to be the two main \ndeterminants of individual food prices for most of the developing Asian countries. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f24   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\n \ne\ng\na\np\n \nt\nx\ne\nn\n \nn\no\n \nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n\n \n\n \n1\n1\n0\n2\n\u2013\n5\n9\n9\n1\n \n,\ns\ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\nd\no\no\nF\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\ni\ns\no\np\nm\no\nc\ne\nD\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nV\n\n \n:\n5\n \ne\nl\nb\na\nT\n\n \n)\n\n%\n\n(\n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   25 \n\n \n\ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \nd\nl\nr\no\nw\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nR\nW\n\n \n\n \n\n \n,\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nl\ni\n\no\n \n\n \n\n=\nS\nU\nL\nI\nO\nP\n\n \n,\ns\ne\nr\nu\nt\nu\nf\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \n\n \n\n=\nE\nR\nU\nT\nU\nF\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\nn\na\ns\nA\n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nS\nA\n\n \n \n.\ne\nt\na\nr\n \ne\ng\nn\na\nh\nc\nx\ne\n \nS\nU\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nR\nS\nU\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\nl\n\n \n,\ny\np\np\nu\ns\n \ny\ne\nn\no\nm\n \n1\nM\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nN\nO\nM\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n \ns\ns\no\nr\ng\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nG\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n\n \n,\n\ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n\n \n\nd\no\no\n\nf\n \ny\nr\nt\n\n \n\nn\nu\no\nc\n \n=\nP\nD\nF\n_\nX\nX\n\n \n,\nt\nc\nu\nd\no\nr\np\n \nc\ni\nt\ns\ne\nm\no\nd\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\n \n.\ny\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nn\nr\ne\nt\nl\na\n \nd\ne\nr\ne\nd\nr\no\n \ne\nr\na\n \nk\nc\no\nb\n \ny\nr\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ni\n \ns\ne\nb\na\ni\nr\na\nv\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ne\nh\nw\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\np\n \nd\no\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nn\ni\n \ne\nc\nn\na\ni\nr\na\nv\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nt\ns\na\nc\ne\nr\no\nf\n \ne\nh\nt\n \no\nt\n \ns\nk\nc\no\nh\ns\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\ni\nt\n\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\n\nn\no\nc\n \n\ne\ng\na\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n\n \n\ne\nh\n\nt\n \ns\nt\nr\no\np\ne\nr\n \n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\nt\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n:\ns\ne\nt\no\nN\n\nl\n\na\nu\nq\ne\n \nr\no\n \nn\na\nh\nt\n \ns\ns\ne\nl\n \ns\n\ni\n \nt\na\nh\nt\n \nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n \nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n \ne\nh\nt\n \ns\ne\nt\no\nn\ne\nd\n \n1\n.\n0\n \ne\nr\nu\ng\ni\nf\n \ne\nh\nT\n\n \n.\nl\ne\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nh\nt\n \nf\no\n \ns\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nc\n\ni\nl\n\np\ne\nr\n \np\na\nr\nt\ns\nt\no\no\nb\n \n0\n0\n5\n \ng\nn\ns\nu\n \nd\ne\nt\nu\np\nm\no\nc\n \ns\nr\no\nr\nr\ne\n\ni\n\n \n\nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\n\nt\ns\n-\ne\nn\no\n\n \n\ne\nr\na\n\n \ns\ne\ns\ne\nh\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nr\na\np\n \nn\ni\n \ns\ne\nr\nu\ng\nF\n\ni\n\n \n.\ns\nn\no\n\ni\nt\n\nl\n\nl\n\na\nu\nc\na\nc\n \n\u2019\ns\nr\no\nh\nt\nu\nA\n\n \n:\ne\nc\nr\nu\no\nS\n\n \n.\n\n0\n\n \n\nn\na\nh\n\nt\n \nr\ne\n\nt\n\na\ne\nr\ng\n \nt\nu\nb\n \n%\n1\n.\n0\n \no\nt\n\n \n\nd\ne\nu\nn\ni\nt\nn\no\nc\n \n5\n \ne\nb\na\nT\n\nl\n\n \n\n\f26   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nTable 6: Variance Decompositions of the Food Prices for Various Regions, 1995\u20132011  \n(%) \n\nWorld \n\nShocks \nRegion \n\nRegion \nDeveloping Asia (11) \nEmerging Europe (9) \nLatin America (9) \nSub-Saharan Africa (7) \nMiddle East (5) \nEurozone (7) \nG7 (7) \n\nPOILUS \n0.03 \n0.17 \n0.14 \n0.06 \n0.06 \n0.03 \n0.03 \n\nGDP \n12.47 \n31.98 \n34.60 \n10.20 \n23.02 \n10.43 \n8.07 \n\nFDP  FUTURE  GDP \n8.08 \n0.22 \n1.01 \n3.26 \n0.67 \n4.53 \n3.96 \n0.49 \n1.44 \n1.58 \n0.23 \n0.64 \n3.41 \n0.19 \n1.03 \n3.75 \n0.39 \n0.53 \n10.88 \n0.10 \n0.30 \n\nFDP \n33.35 \n22.02 \n16.86 \n53.55 \n17.57 \n7.17 \n6.92 \n\nUSR \n9.67 \n1.36 \n2.47 \n1.52 \n21.25 \n12.98 \n0.68 \n\nCountry \n\nMON \n0.96 \n0.83 \n1.19 \n0.92 \n2.01 \n2.35 \n0.87 \n\nGDP \n6.93 \n16.56 \n14.09 \n16.42 \n12.34 \n18.98 \n28.73 \n\nFDP \n27.29 \n18.62 \n24.74 \n14.88 \n19.13 \n43.39 \n43.41 \n\nFDP  =  food  price,  FUTURE  =  food  price  futures,  GDP  =  gross domestic  product,  MON  =  M1  money  supply,  POILUS  =  oil  price, \nUSR = US exchange rate.  \n\nNotes: The table reports the regional average contribution of the shocks in explaining the variation in domestic food prices.

For  emerging \nEurope, Latin America, and the Middle East, the regional food price shock loses some strength, \nbut  remains  important  in  determining  domestic  food  prices.  In  these  cases,  the  world  GDP \nshock  is  the  most  influential,  and  the  domestic  food  price  shock  also  explains  a  significant \nportion  of  the  variation  in  food  prices.  Interestingly,  the  results  change  considerably  for  the \neurozone and G7. Only a small fraction of the variation in domestic food prices was accounted \nfor by the regional food price shock. The domestic food price shock becomes most crucial and \nexplains  over  40%  of  the  variation  in  food  prices.  The  domestic  GDP  shock  also  plays  a \nsignificant  role.  It  appears  that  the  food  prices  of  those  advanced  countries  constituting  the \neurozone  and  G7  are  determined  mostly  by  domestic  factors  on  average.  Shocks  originating \nexternally do not seem to affect the domestic food price. This is in contrast to the results from \nthe other regions where the members are mostly developing countries. The regional food price \nshock  was  an  important  factor  for  driving  domestic  food  prices.  Obviously,  it  would  be \ninteresting  to  explore  the  reasons  for  this  difference  between  advanced  and  developing \ncountries in the determination of food prices. As the topic is beyond the scope of this paper, it is \nleft for future research. \n\n \n \n\nVI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS \n\n \nSurging  food  prices  over  recent  years  have  raised  concerns  that  high  and  volatile  food  prices \nwould persist, with potentially devastating consequences on poverty. The experiences of 2008 \nand  2011  are  particularly  daunting.  Stabilizing  food  prices now  arises  as  a  major  challenge  to \nthe policy makers of many countries and is high on the global agenda. \n\n \nFor  policy  analysis,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  underlying  sources  of  food  price \nfluctuations  because  policy  should  respond  differently  according  to  these  sources.  Yet,  there \nhave  been  only  a  limited  number  of  empirical  studies  for  Asian  countries.  The  present  paper \nadds  to  the  literature  with  the  development  of  the  structural  model  that  can  identify  the \nkey  determinants  of  food  prices  for  11  developing  Asian  countries.  The  working  model  is  a  \nblock VAR, and a large set of 10 variables were classified into three blocks\u2014world, Asia, and \ncountry\u2014depending  on  their  origin  and  nature.  The  blocks  were  identified  using  block \n\n\fExamining the Determinants of Food Prices in Developing Asia   \u0406   27 \n\nexogeneity restrictions, and the structural shocks within the block were identified by assuming \nthe Choleski-type recursive ordering of the variables. \n\n \nWe also constructed a composite food price index of Asia in order to measure common \nmovements among the food prices of Asian countries. This index exhibits distinctively different \ndynamics compared to the world food price. The block VAR model produced results confirming \nthat the variation in the Asian food price is mainly accounted for by its own innovations. \n\n \nOur  empirical  results  reveal  some  interesting  findings.  First,  the  variation  in  domestic \nfood prices is mainly accounted for by the countries\u2019 own shocks, especially at short horizons. \nSecond, a shock to the common regional food price exerts a significant and large influence on \ndomestic  food  prices  across  Asia.  This  effect  is  particularly  pronounced  over  the  medium-  to \nlong-term horizons. Third, the world food price shock contributes little to the movements of both \ncommon regional food price and domestic food prices in Asia. Similarly, other world factors such \nas oil prices and food price futures appear to provide very little explanation for the variations in \nboth common regional price and the individual domestic prices of Asian countries. \n\n \nOur findings seem to confirm those of the earlier literature on the segmentation of Asian \nfood markets from the world market. A confluence of factors may be responsible for the limited \nrole of world food prices and other global factors in determining food prices in Asia. Obviously, \ndomestic food prices are influenced by interrelated factors of domestic food market conditions, \nmacroeconomic and sector policies, as well as international trade and other external factors. On \ntop  of  these,  food  prices  are  often  very  carefully  monitored  and  become  the  target  of  policy \ninterventions,  especially  in  developing  countries,  given  their  impact  on  poverty  and  household \nwelfare.  Various  subsidies  and  price  controls  on  food  have  been  observed  across  Asia,  while \ngovernments  have  intervened  in  food  markets  to  stabilize  local  food  prices.  Concerns  about \nfood security, agricultural protection, and food self-sufficiency also imply that food is not readily \ntraded. Unlike other manufactured goods, agricultural commodities tend to be subject to heavy \nprotectionist  agricultural  policies.  All  of  these  may  explain  the  limited  transmission  of  the \ninternational food price and other factors to domestic food prices in Asia. \n\n \nOn the other hand, our findings suggest that there is a strong common component in the \nmovement of domestic food prices across Asia, and that a shock in the common regional food \nprice  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  individual  domestic  food  prices.  Similar  patterns \nwere also observed for other developing regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa, and to a lesser \nextent, emerging Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. \n\n \nThe common regional component may reflect the effects of region-specific food market \nconditions, growing regional economic integration, and similar policy responses to the regionally \ncommon shocks. Many of these regions have region-specific food cultures with distinctive main \nstaples\u2014for  example,  rice  in  much  of  Asia,  wheat  in  most  of  Europe  and  the  Middle  East  to \nNorth  Africa,  white  maize  in  Eastern  and  Southern  Africa,  and  sorghum  and  millet  in  West \nAfrica\u2019s  Sahel.  The  countries  in  the  same  region  may  also  face  similar  agroclimatic  shocks. \nCommon  staples  and  shocks  could  then  cause  the  domestic  price  stabilization  policies  to \nconverge.  The  effect  of  regional  economic  integration  on  domestic  demand  conditions  cannot \nbe  ignored  either.  For  example,  while  further  assessment  is  warranted,  a  number  of  studies \nargue that the business cycles in Asian nations are more synchronized regionally than globally \n(McKinnon  and  Schnabl  2003;  IMF  2007;  Kose,  Otrok,  and  Prasad  2008;  Moneta  and  R\u00fcffer \n2009). All of these factors may be manifested in the common regional component of domestic \nfood prices. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28   \u0406   ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 370 \n\nSome  interesting  policy  implications  can  be  drawn  from  our  findings.  While  internal \nfactors play a major role in determining domestic food prices, the importance of regional factors \nsuggests  the  role  of  regional  cooperation  in  stabilizing  local  food  prices  in  many  developing \nregions, including Asia. Specifically, the findings suggest that Asian food markets are not fully \nintegrated with the world market, but rather, are integrated regionally. \n\n \nIn  the  context  of  developing  Asia,  regional  cooperation  and  integration  offer  unique \nopportunities  to  discuss  the  food  security  issue  in  a  regional  framework.  Regional  efforts  to \npromote  food  security  can  have  three  strategic  purposes:  (i)  strengthening  intraregional  trade; \n(ii) supporting national programs and initiatives for food security, and harmonizing national food \nand  agricultural  policies  where  necessary;  and  (iii)  establishing  regional  mechanisms,  such  as \nregional strategic food reserves, for the prevention and management of food crises. \n\n \nObviously,  food  security  is  not  synonymous  with  food  self-sufficiency.  The  promotion  \nof  intraregional  trade  is  crucial  to  a  stable  food  supply  for  the  region,  particularly  in  some  of  \nthe  major  regional  staples  such  as  rice.  In  this  context,  the  region\u2019s  policy  efforts  should  \nfocus  on  identifying  trade  barriers,  facilitating  trade  through  the  modernization  of  food  safety \ncontrol  systems  and  standards,  and  developing  trade  support  programs  for  major  agricultural \ncommodities. \n \nRegional  support  can  be  envisaged  to  promote  investment  in  agricultural  production \ntogether  with  appropriate  agricultural  policy  assistance.  First,  it  is  important  to  identify  areas \nrequiring technical and financial support for agricultural development and food security. Second, \nregional  policy  dialogue  and  cooperation  can  help  promote  trade  facilitation  programs  and \npressure national agricultural policies to adopt international standards. \n\n \nFinally, regional food security reserves may be considered one of the major components \nof  regional  strategies  for  preventing  and  managing  food  crisis.  The  low  level  of  food  stocks  is \noften a cause of price hikes. The level of stocks can be suboptimal if it is primarily the outcome \nof  business  decisions  made  by  private  sector  agents.  Therefore,  there  is  scope  for  policy \ninterventions to induce higher levels of stocks. Managing food security stocks is challenging and \nrequires  effective  coordination  among  various  stakeholders  at  national  and  regional  levels. \nEffective  regional  mechanisms  that  maintain  adequate  levels  of  reserves  could  help  avert  or \nameliorate the adverse effects of crises on the supply of basic food items, such as rice. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \nBaffes,  J.,  and  B.

This paper studies the factors that determine food prices, specifically focusing on the \ntransmission of external shocks to domestic prices. Using a block Vector Autoregression model, the authors \nexamine the sources of food price fluctuation in 11 developing countries in Asia. The findings suggest that \nstability in food prices would require regional as well as domestic efforts.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing \nmember countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people.
