Prior  to  the  crisis,\nThailand had embarked on a comprehensive liberal-\nization  of  domestic  financial  markets  and  capital\naccount transactions. As a result, financial institutions\nbegan to enjoy a more liberal economic environment,\nincluding increased business opportunities with the\ncorporate and household sectors as well as favorable\nfunding terms from domestic and foreign sources.\nHowever,  Thailand\u2019s  financial  system  was  not\nsufficiently sound or resilient to cope with problems\ncreated by large inflows of deposits and foreign funds\nas  well  as  the  subsequent  expansion  of  domestic\ncredit. Consequently, the credit boom and bust that\npreceded  the  baht  crisis  was  a  major  problem  for\nboth the economy and its financial system.\n\nSince  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)\nemerged on the scene in response to the baht crisis,\nfinancial system reform has steadily progressed. The\nreform plan included three broad objectives:\n\n\u2022 Resolve nonviable and problem financial inst-\n\nitutions.\n\n\u2022 Strengthen the financial sector structure.\n\u2022 Enhance the regulatory and supervisory regime.\nMost of the reform efforts in 1997-1999 focused\non the first objective, including resolving the assets\nand liabilities of the 56 closed finance companies,\nrestructuring and recapitalizing troubled commercial\nbanks,  and  resolving  bank  nonperforming  loans\n(NPLs).\n\nIn addition to financial system reform, Thailand\nalso focused on corporate sector reform in order to\nresolve serious corporate debt overhang and to create\na  robust  corporate  sector,  thereby  helping  restore\nfinancial system health. The reform strategy included\n(i)  accelerating  corporate  debt  restructuring,  (ii)\nstrengthening corporate insolvency procedures, and\n(iii) improving corporate governance.\n\nIn 1998, Thailand was in a vicious circle in which\nreal economic activity contracted more drastically\nthan  anyone  had  expected  (Figure  1);  demand\ncontraction, sharply rising NPLs, and bank capital\nshortage constrained the credit flows to the corporate\nsector, in turn contracting real economic activity even\n\nTable 1: Structure of Financial Institutions in Thailand, End-1996 (B million)\n\n\u25cb\n\nFinancial  Institution\n\nCommercial Banks\nFinance Companies\nCredit Foncier Companies\nGovernment Savings Bank\nLife Insurance Companiese\nSavings  Cooperativesf\nAgricultural  Cooperativesf\nBank  of Agr.  and Agr.

It  also\nreviews  the  progress  made  in  corporate  sector\nrestructuring precisely because of the strong linkage\nbetween  financial  sector  and  corporate  sector\nrestructuring.  It  then  specifies  pressing  policy\nconcerns and challenges and lays out some policy\noptions  for  reform.  It  concludes  by  summarizing\npolicy  lessons  from  the  financial  crisis  and  its\nresolution.\n\nFinancial System Fragility\nPrior to the Baht Devaluation\n\nOverview of the Financial System\n\nThe  financial  system  was  long  dominated  by\ncommercial banks, while finance companies gained\nsome importance in recent years.\n\nFor its level of income, Thailand had a relatively\ndeep financial sector. High economic growth and high\nsavings rates, together with substantial capital inflows,\nled to rapid growth of financial institutions\u2019 claims on\nthe private sector in the 1990s (from 83 percent of\nGDP in 1990 to 147 percent in 1996). By end-1996,\ntotal financial sector assets amounted to B8.7 trillion\n(US$340 billion) at the then prevailing exchange rate\nof  B25.61  per  US  dollar)  (Table  1).  Commercial\nbanks dominated the financial sector, accounting for\n64  percent  of  total  financial  assets,  69  percent  of\ntotal deposits (or equivalents), and 67 percent of total\ncredits extended. Finance companies were the next\nlargest group of financial institutions, accounting for\n21 percent of total assets, 19 percent of total deposits\n(or  equivalents),  and  21  percent  of  total  credits\nextended.\n\nSource:  National Economic and Social Development Board.\n\nfurther. A year later, Thailand began to show signs\nof gradual recovery, driven largely by exports and\nfiscal stimulus. Its real gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrowth is expected to recover from -10 percent in\n1998 to 3-4 percent in 1999. Nonetheless, several\ndownside risks could prolong or hamper the recovery\nprocess. These include (i) slowdown in the recovery\nof regional markets, especially Japan; (ii) deceleration\nof US economic expansion; and (iii) slow pace of\ndomestic financial and corporate restructuring.

Commercial banks could engage in a\nlarge class of normal banking businesses but were\nnot allowed to undertake securities or trust services.\nLarge  portions  of  commercial  bank  loans  were\ndirected  to  manufacturing  (27  percent)  and  trade\n(25 percent), with limited exposure to construction\nand real estate (14 percent) and personal consump-\ntion (13 percent) (Table 2).\n\nIn the finance company subsector, there were 91\n2\nfinance companies at end-1996.\n While some finance\ncompanies  were  independent,  many  originated  as\naffiliates of commercial banks to provide specialized\nservices that banks were not allowed to undertake,\nor as specialized providers of high-margin, high-risk\nconsumer finance. Finance companies could not take\ndeposits and had to fund their operations by issuing\nlarge-denomination  promissory  notes,  as  well  as\nnegotiable  certificates  of  deposit,  and  bills  of\nexchange. Loans and overdrafts from domestic and\nforeign banks were also significant sources of funds.\nFinance companies\u2019 assets at end-1996 were domi-\nnated  by  loans  (77  percent  of  total  assets)  and\nsecurities investment and receivables (18 percent).\nDue  to  commercial  banks\u2019  regulatory  and  cost\nadvantages,  finance  companies  sought  business\nopportunities  by  allocating  a  major  share  of  their\nportfolios in high-risk areas such as construction and\nreal estate (28 percent) and personal consumption\nloans  (26  percent),  including  hire  purchase  and\nfinance and securities businesses (Table 3).\n\nThe legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework\nwas such that finance companies could not effectively\ncompete  for  most  commercial  bank  mainstream\nbusinesses. As a result, they were left largely with\nmore risky activities. Compared to commercial banks,\nfinance  companies  were  restricted  from  the  busi-\nnesses of (i) mobilizing sight or time deposits, (ii)\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\noffering overdrafts or credit cards, (iii) offering credit\nfacilities related to trade finance, (iv) providing foreign\nexchange services, and (v) establishing a domestic\nbranch  network  in  the  Greater  Bangkok  area.\nFinance companies were compelled to take greater\nrisks, while being subject to less stringent prudential\nrequirements than banks.\n\nFinancial System Deregulation\n\n3\n\nThe  relaxation  of  the  upper  limit  imposed  on  the\ninterest rate in 1980 was an early attempt to dere-\ngulate  the  financial  market.\n Interest rate dere-\ngulation, however, was soon interrupted in the first\nhalf of the 1980s when the economy faced serious\nmacroeconomic  difficulties  as  well  as  a  financial\ncrisis.  The  economy  went  into  a  recession,  expe-\nrienced widening current account deficits (7 percent\nof GDP in 1981 and 1983), and saw four currency\ndevaluations in 1981-1985. Many financial institutions,\nincluding finance companies and commercial banks,\nsuffered from a large volume of bad loans not only\nbecause of the recession but also due to weak mana-\ngerial practices and an inadequate legal, regulatory,\nand supervisory framework for financial institutions.\nAlthough some institutions went bankrupt, many of\nthem were rescued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)\n4\nand  the  Bank  of  Thailand  (BoT).\n Only after the\nfinancial crisis did the financial liberalization process\nresume.\n\nComprehensive  liberalization  of  the  financial\nsystem was implemented according to schedules laid\nout in two three-year plans in the 1990s. The plans\nwere  intended  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the\nfinancial system and to increase the competitiveness\nof Thai financial institutions. The first Three-Year\nFinancial System Development Plan (1990-1992) had\nfour major objectives:\n\n\u2022 Deregulate and liberalize interest rates, foreign\nexchange transactions, and the scope of financial\ninstitutions\u2019 businesses.\n\n\u2022 Develop new financial instruments, facilities, and\n\nservices.\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN

ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n43\n\n\u2022 Improve supervision and examination of financial\ninstitutions, including the adoption of the Bank\nfor  International  Settlements  capital  adequacy\nratios (CARs); and\n\n\u2022 Develop payments systems.\nThe second Three-Year Financial System Deve-\nlopment Plan (1993-1995) aimed to (a) enhance fi-\nnancial market efficiency, (b) mobilize domestic sav-\nings through pension systems and other means, and\n(b) transform Bangkok into a regional financial cen-\nter by establishing an offshore banking center. Many\nof the goals were accomplished as scheduled. The\nthird  Financial  System  Development  Plan  (1995-\n2000), however, was put on hold as a result of the\neconomic crisis.\n\nOne of the most important outcomes of financial\nmarket deregulation was greater competition among\nfinancial institutions. Finance companies started to\ncompete  fiercely  against  commercial  banks  by\noffering financial instruments and services that were\nincreasingly  attractive  to  the  general  public  and\nforeigners. Thai commercial banks also became more\naggressively competitive with each other.\n\nFinancial market deregulation and the consequent,\nenhanced competition, however, were not matched\nby  a  commensurate  establishment  of  a  resilient\nfinancial system based on prudent management of\nassets and liabilities, reliable information disclosure,\naccounting standards, and effective supervision and\nexamination.  Policy  toward  distressed  financial\ninstitutions  was  not  always  clearly  defined.  The\ntraditional practice of extending central bank credits\nand liquidity to weak banks and finance companies\ncontinued to pose a moral-hazard risk in the financial\n 5\nmarket.\n The risk was aggravated by capital account\nliberalization, particularly through financial institutions.\n\nCapital Account Liberalization\n\nThe authorities began to liberalize international capital\nflows in the 1980s with the relaxation of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) restrictions; they then focused on\nliberalizing portfolio investment in the stock market\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nand bank loans. Liberalization of portfolio and banking\nflows was accompanied by the relaxation of foreign\n6\nexchange controls.\n\nIn the 1990s, Thailand began to substantially lib-\neralize financial capital flows and foreign exchange\ntransactions. The country accepted Article 8 of the\nIMF in 1990 and removed foreign exchange restric-\ntions on current-account-related transactions. Start-\ning in 1991, it began to relax foreign exchange re-\nstrictions  on  capital-account-related  transactions,\npromoting cross-border capital flows by financial in-\nstitutions. One important strategy for capital account\nliberalization was the establishment of the Bangkok\nInternational Banking Facility (BIBF), an offshore\nbanking center, in 1993.\n\nCapital account liberalization was driven by three\n\n7\n\nfactors:\n\n\u2022 the  need  to  attract  foreign  savings  for  capital\naccumulation and infrastructure development and\nto adopt advanced foreign technologies for more\nefficient production and management,\n\n\u2022 competitive pressure to open the domestic fin-\nancial market to foreign institutions and to liberal-\nize financial capital flows, and\n\n\u2022 bilateral and multilateral pressures to open the\n\nfinancial market.\n\nCompetitive pressure from neighboring countries\nin East Asia was responsible for the expansion of\nFDI. Foreign manufacturing firms investing directly\nin Thailand required not only adequate financing of\nworking capital, but also high-quality financial ser-\nvices, which only their home financial institutions could\nprovide.  Therefore,  to  attract  more  FDI,  Thailand\nwas compelled to allow foreign financial institutions\naccess to the domestic market and cross-border fi-\nnancial  transactions.  The  most  important  bilateral\npressure  came  from  the  US  and  Europe,  and  the\nmultilateral pressure came from liberalization require-\nments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (and later the World Trade Organization).\n\nThe  increased  openness  of  the  capital  account,\ntogether with financial market deregulation, led to a\n\n\f44\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nhigher degree of capital mobility\u2014largely reflected\nin  the  growing  importance  of  short-term  banking\nflows, portfolio investment, and nonresident baht ac-\n8\ncounts (see Table 4).\n BIBF played a crucial role in\nexpanding international bank loans. The authorities\nestablished BIBF for several purposes:\n\n\u2022 Encourage foreign-currency-denominated bank\nloans into Thailand (\u201cout-in\u201d loans) to meet the\nfunding  needs  of  Thai  firms  and  to  finance\ninfrastructure development;\n\n\u2022 Attract foreign banks with international reputa-\ntion, technology, and know-how to Bangkok so\nas to introduce more competition into the banking\nsystem  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  Thai\ncommercial banks;\n\n\u2022 Encourage  foreign  banks  to  extend  loans,  via\nBangkok, to the greater Indochina area, including\nCambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam\n(\u201cout-out\u201d loans). Partly due to regulatory and\ntax advantages, the establishment of BIBF led\nto a dramatic expansion in the volume of foreign\n9\nbank loans into Thailand.\n The fact that the Thai\nauthorities used BIBF as a stepping stone to full-\nbranch banking for foreign banks also expanded\nBIBF loans (Table 5).\n\nIn the 1990s, Thailand saw growing inflows of\nforeign capital. While they were mainly in the form\nof FDI until the early 1990s, they recently shifted to\nshort-term inflows, including bank loans. Essentially,\nthe removal of interest rate ceilings as well as capital\naccount liberalization allowed funds raised overseas\nto  become  an  increasingly  important  source  of\nfinancing domestic investment. In fact, large current\naccount deficits were increasingly financed by private\ncapital inflows, often exceeding the size of current\naccount deficits until 1996 (Figure 2).\n\n10\n\nStructural  Weaknesses\nof the Financial Sector\n\nDuring 1990-1996, the volume of financial sector\nassets grew at much faster rates than normal eco-\nnomic activity; assets of commercial banks and fin-\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nTable 4: Net Inflows of Private Financial Account, 1985\u20131998\n\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n\nItem\n\nBank\n\nCommercial Bank\nRecapitalization\n\nBIBFs\nNonbank\n\nDirect Investment\n\nForeign Direct Investment\nThai Direct Investment\n\nOther  Loans\nPortfolio Investment\nEquity  Securities\nDebt  Securities\n\nNon-Resident  Baht  Account\nTrade Credits\nOthers\n\nTotal\n\nBank\n\nCommercial Bank\nRecapitalization\n\nBIBFs\nNonbank\n\nDirect Investment\n\nForeign Direct Investment\nThai Direct Investment\n\nOther  Loans\nPortfolio Investment\nEquity  Securities\nDebt  Securities\n\nNon-Resident  Baht  Account\nTrade Credits\nOthers\n\nTotal\n\n-14,244\n-14,244\n0\n0\n19,623\n4,379\n4,402\n-23\n2,109\n3,858\n3,858\n0\n10,813\n-1,994\n458\n5,379\n\n-264.8\n-264.8\n0\n0\n364.8\n81.4\n81.8\n-0.4\n39.2\n71.7\n71.7\n0.0\n201.0\n-37.1\n8.5\n100.0\n\n-21,965\n-21,965\n0\n0\n12,546\n6,880\n6,908\n-28\n-3,334\n2,517\n2,517\n0\n9,672\n-3,606\n417\n-9,419\n\n233.2\n233.2\n0\n0\n-133.2\n-73.1\n-73.4\n0.3\n35.4\n-26.7\n-26.7\n0.0\n-102.7\n38.3\n-4.4\n100.0\n\n5,935\n5,935\n0\n0\n16,510\n4,711\n9,044\n-4,333\n-16,006\n12,862\n12,862\n0\n10,592\n3,704\n647\n22,445\n\n26.4\n26.4\n0\n0\n73.6\n21.0\n40.3\n-19.3\n-71.3\n57.3\n57.3\n0.0\n47.2\n16.5\n2.9\n100.0\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand, Monthly Bulletin, various issues.\n\nance companies increased by an average of 21 and\n30 percent per annum, respectively, while nominal\nGDP rose  by only 13 percent per year (Figure 3).\nThe  volume  of  financial  sector  credit  extended  to\nthe  private  sector,  as  a  proportion  of  GDP,  also\nexpanded significantly from 83 percent in 1990 to\n147 percent in 1996 (Figure 4).

First, although commercial banks and fin-\n\nance companies extended some proportion of loans\nto productive investment projects, they directed a siz-\nable proportion to nonproductive, and often specula-\ntive, investments such as real estate, construction,\nand consumer loans (including automobile loans, stock\npurchases, and hire purchases).\n As long as the eco-\nnomy grew at a rapid rate, there was little problem in\nrecovering such loans, but firms with unsound pro-\njects were exposed to the risk of economic slowdown\nand  the  consequent  deterioration  of  their  balance\nsheets.\n\n11\n\nFigure 4: Financial Institutions\u2019 Claims on Private\n\nFigure 5: Commercial Banks\u2019 and Finance\n\nSector and Money Supply\n\nCompanies\u2019 Claims on Private Sector\n\nPercent of GDP\n\nFinancial Institutions\u2019 Credit\nto the Private Sector\nMoney Plus Quasi-Money\n\n170\n\n150\n\n130\n\n110\n\n90\n\n70\n\n50\n\nFinance Companies\u2019\nLoan/Debenture Ratio\nCommercial Banks\u2019\nLoan/Deposit Ratio\n\nPercent\n260\n\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n1985\n\n1987\n\n1989\n\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997 1999Q2\n\n1985\n\n1987\n\n1988\n\n1991\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\nSource:  International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics.\n\nSource:  International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics.\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n47\n\nSecond, loans were directed to  corporations which\nfaced  rising  debt/equity  ratios.  Since  lending  was\nbased on collaterals rather than projected cash flows,\nthe large exposure to highly leveraged firms posed a\nrisk of asset price collapse.\n\nThird,  the  problems  on  the  asset  side  were\ncompounded by the mismanagement of the liabilities.\nCommercial banks, BIBF-based foreign banks, and\nfinance companies relied increasingly on domestic\nand  foreign borrowing to supplement the insufficient\ndeposits for extending loans. In particular, foreign\nborrowing was an important source of funding for\ncommercial  banks  and  finance  companies,  which\nextended loans not only to tradable industries but also\nto nontradable sectors. These institutions essentially\nengaged in risky maturity and currency transform-\nation, by borrowing short and often in large amounts\nof unhedged foreign currency and lending de facto\nlong in domestic currency (through regular roll-overs\nof short-term loans) to manufacturing firms and other\nnontradable business enterprises.\n\n12\n\nInadequate  regulatory  and  supervisory  frame-\nworks also contributed to the weakness of the fin-\nancial system. By end-1996, there were reportedly\nB487 billion in NPLs on the books of commercial\nbanks  (11.5  percent  of  gross  loans)  and  another\nB225 billion on the books of finance companies (15\npercent  of  gross  loans).  Most  banks  and  finance\ncompanies failed to adopt appropriate loan classifi-\ncation, resulting in vastly understated NPLs, post-\nponed loan-loss provisioning, and continued accrual\nof interest on NPLs. Regulations governing income\nrecognition on NPLs were also lenient: provisions\nwere far below what would be required to address\nthe  rising  NPL  problems.  Reported  CARs  vastly\noverstated the true capital positions of both com-\nmercial  banks  and  finance  companies  due  to  the\nlack of proper asset classification and provision. In\naddition,  auditing  and  disclosure  practices  were\nweak, resulting in underreported lending to related\nparties and single borrowers and a limited role for\nmarket discipline.\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nEarly Measures of Financial\nCrisis  Resolution\nThailand\u2019s economic conditions began to deteriorate\nvisibly from around mid-1996. Exports, formerly the\ndriving force of economic growth, experienced a 1.3\npercent yearly decline (US dollar terms) in 1996; in\nthe same year, the current account deficit expanded\nto 7.9 percent of nominal GDP. The business envi-\nronment  for  financial  institutions  also  began  to\nworsen,  with  an  increasingly  serious  oversupply\nsituation in the real estate market, stagnating share\nprices,  and  selling  of  the  baht  on  the  foreign\nexchange market. Because of the collapse of land\nand stock prices that had begun one to two years\nearlier, a few commercial banks and a large number\nof finance companies began to encounter manage-\nment  difficulties.  Financial  institutions  saw  their\nassets turning into bad loans. Some international cre-\nditor banks began to cut lending and even refused\nto roll over their cross-border loans, which in turn\naggravated the deteriorating balance sheets of banks\nand  finance  companies  and  threatened  financial\nmarket stability.\n\nThe Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) was the\nfirst  major  commercial  bank  to  experience  man-\nagement  difficulties,  mainly  due  to  fraud.  It  was\nplaced under BoT control in May 1996. Although\nBoT did not use Financial Institutions Development\nFund (FIDF) financing at first, it later resorted to it in\norder to write off part of BBC\u2019s bad loans.\n\nThe first sign of weakness in finance companies\ncame when the Thai Danu Bank (TDB) announced,\nin early March 1997, its intended takeover of Finance\nOne, the country\u2019s largest finance company, which\nhad  been  experiencing  management  difficulties.\n(Ultimately, TDB decided not to take over Finance\nOne  because  of  the  latter\u2019s  questionable  financial\nconditions.) Following this announcement, BoT made\npublic  the  names  of  10  beleaguered  finance  com-\npanies that had serious financial problems. While BoT\nalso  declared  that  other  financial  companies  were\nfinancially sound, its action sent a shock wave through\n\n\f48\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nthe market. BoT started to provide liquidity support\n13\nthrough FIDF for the troubled finance companies,\nbecause  funds  began  to  flee  institutions  that  were\nperceived as weak. The Government decided to esta-\nblish the (largely inactive) Property Loan Manage-\nment Organization in March, whose intended role\nwas to purchase problem loans secured by real estate\nfrom the portfolios of financial institutions at market\nprices, subject to certain conditions.\n\n14\n\nThe problems of finance companies came to the\nfore in mid-1997, when there was a sharp decline in\nconfidence in the entire financial system. On 27 June,\nBoT announced that it was suspending the operations\nof  16  finance  companies,  including  the  10  whose\nnames had been published earlier, and ordered them\nto restructure their management. It also declared that\nno  other  finance  companies  would  be  suspended.\nNonetheless, it again announced on 4 August that an\nadditional  42  finance  companies  were  directed  to\nsuspend their business operations\u2014amounting to a\ntotal of 58 out of 91 finance companies\u2014and that it\nwould  provide  a  \u201ctemporary  guarantee\u201d  for  the\nremaining financial institutions as well as \u201cblanket\nguarantees\u201d to eligible depositors and creditors of\nsuspended financial institutions. The suspended 58\nfinance companies were required to submit rehabili-\ntation plans by the end of October; they would remain\nsuspended  until  recapitalized,  merged  with  new\ndomestic  or  foreign  partners,  absorbed  by  a  few\n\u201ccore\u201d  finance  companies,  or  liquidated  after  the\ncompletion of the due diligence process.\n\nAfter the devaluation of the baht on 2 July 1997,\nthe business environment for financial institutions\ndeteriorated even further. The corporate borrowers\u2019\nrepayment burden on banks with foreign currency\nliabilities increased suddenly. Moreover, the corporat-\nions also came under enormous financial pressure,\nsince they had substantial foreign currency exposures\nwithout hedging against exchange risk. A high-interest\npolicy that was introduced in an attempt to maintain\nthe  value  of  the  baht  increased  the  domestic-debt\nservicing obligations of corporate debtors, thereby\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\ncausing economic activity to slow down, and triggering\nfurther  deterioration  in  the  real  estate  and  stock\nmarkets. In addition, the outbreak of the baht crisis\nwas followed by a \u201cflight to quality,\u201d as depositors\nincreasingly  shifted  their  funds  from  financially\ntroubled institutions, particularly from finance com-\npanies and weak domestic banks, to quality domestic\nbanks and foreign banks. As a result, finance com-\npanies lost large amounts of funds while commercial\nbanks gained deposits (Figure 6). However, within\nthe banking sector, seven middle- and lower-ranked\ncommercial  banks  experienced  a  decline  in  their\ndeposit  balances  at  end-1997  compared  with  end-\n1996, while the deposit balances of the leading banks\nrose.\n\nIn retrospect, the various measures taken before\nthe launching of the IMF program were piecemeal\nand half-hearted and did not stem the growing loss\nof confidence. FIDF provided nearly B400 billion in\nliquidity  support  over  several  months  prior  to  the\nsuspension of the 58 finance companies, but did not\nsucceed in arresting the financial sector crisis. Some\nmeasures inadvertently compounded the scale of the\ncrisis, increasing resolution costs for the Government\nand  raising  the  danger  of  contagion  from  finance\ncompanies to the banking sector, thus aggravating\nthe systemic financial crisis and the ensuing sharp\neconomic downturn.\n\nFigure 6: Finance Company Borrowing and\n\nCommercial Bank Deposits\n\nSource: Bank of Thailand.\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n49\n\nFinancial Sector\nRestructuring\n\nRestructuring of Finance\nCompanies\n\nOn 14 October 1997, as part of IMF\u2019s standby ar-\nrangement conditionalities, the authorities announced\na comprehensive strategy for the overall restructur-\ning of the financial sector, with six emergency de-\ncrees setting out the legal basis for this strategy. The\npackage aimed to bring Thailand\u2019s financial system\ncloser to international standards by 2000. The com-\nprehensive strategy included the following measures:\n\u2022 Establish  the  Financial  Sector  Restructuring\nAuthority  (FRA)  and  the  Asset  Management\nCompany (AMC).\n\u2013 FRA and AMC were established to provide a\nframework for the early disposal of NPLs held\nby finance companies and the reconstruction\nof the financial system.\n\n\u2013 FRA\u2019s role  was to (a) order finance companies\nwith inadequate equity or cash flow problems\nto recapitalize or merge, (b) provide guarantees\nfor  deposits  and  loans,  (c)  invest  in  finance\ncompanies in order to stabilize the payments\nsystem, (d) ease restrictions on foreign owner-\nship  of  financial  institutions  and  nominate\ndirectors, and (e) liquidate the assets of troubled\nfinance companies by offering them for sale\nto general bidders.\n\n\u2013 The role of AMC was to purchase, manage,\nrestructure, and sell the assets of failed finance\ncompanies.  In  addition  to  the  acquisition  of\nassets that could not be sold through general\nbidding by FRA, it would also buy NPLs from\nfinancial  institutions  placed  under  FIDF\nownership or control.\n\n\u2022 Announce tightened loan classification rules.\n\n\u2013 Provisioning was required for all loans more\nthan  six  months  overdue,  effective  31\nDecember 1997.\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u2013 Accrual  of  interest  on  NPLs  more  than  six\nmonths  overdue  was  prohibited,  effective  1\nJanuary 1998.\n\n\u2022 Initiate the resolution of 58 suspended finance\n\ncompanies.\n\u2013 Memoranda  of  understanding  with  all\nundercapitalized  finance  companies  (and\ncommercial  banks)  were  exchanged  with\nregard to the timetable for raising capital to a\nrequired level.\n\n\u2013 Criteria for assessing the rehabilitation plans\nand  the  reopening  of  the  suspended  finance\ncompanies were established.\n\n15\n\n\u2013 Foreign investment in finance companies (and\nbanks) was fully liberalized for 10 years, with\namounts  invested  during  this  period\npermanently  grandfathered,  so  as  to  help\nrecapitalize financial institutions.\n\n16\n\nFRA obtained and assessed the rehabilitation plans\nfrom  the  58  suspended  finance  companies.  The\ncriteria it applied were whether or not (i) capital could\nbe raised to the required level, (ii) the funds required\nfor liquidity management could be raised, and (iii)\nthe institution had the capacity to repay loans provided\nby FIDF.\n Based on FRA\u2019s recommendation made\nat the end of November, MOF and BoT announced\non 8 December that 56 out of the 58 finance com-\npanies  would  be  permanently  closed.\n  The  assets\nof the closed finance companies were transferred to\nFRA for quick disposition. FRA did not intend to\nrestructure  loans  owed  to  the  finance  companies\nbecause  it  lacked  such  an  authority  and,  instead,\n18\nsimply focused on asset disposal through auctions.\n\n17\n\nIn February 1998, FRA began auctioning off the\nassets of the 56 closed companies. Its plan was to\nbegin with the sale of noncore physical assets (ve-\nhicles, art objects, furniture, office equipment, etc.)\nand financial assets (bonds) and then move to the\nsale of core assets (hire purchase contracts, residen-\ntial mortgage loans, and business loans). At end-1999,\nproceeds from FRA\u2019s sale of core and noncore as-\nsets totaled B186 billion with the recovery rate of\n\n\f50\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nabout 28 percent of the outstanding balance (book\nvalue) of about B665 billion. The sale of noncore\nassets met with considerable success, with the aver-\nage price of 53 percent of book value, which was\nwell above FRA\u2019s own estimates. In a series of core-\nasset  auctions  that  began  in  June  1998,  FRA  has\ndisposed of B600 billion of core assets as of Novem-\nber 1999, at an average recovery rate of 25 percent\n(Table  6). There  were  multiple  bidders  for  earlier\nauctions so that AMC did not have to take up assets.\nHowever,  as  the  bidder  of  last  resort, AMC  took\npart in the March 1999 auction for the first time since\nits establishment. Since then, all in all, AMC has pur-\nchased core assets totaling B197 billion (B199 billion\nif noncore assets are included) or one third of the\ncore assets sold by FRA at an average of 17 percent\nof  face  value.\n\n19\n\nIn January 1998, the Cabinet approved the cre-\nation  of  a  fully  Government-owned  \u201cgood  bank,\u201d\nRadanasin Bank (RSB), in order to preserve the value\nof domestic assets against fire-sale prices resulting\nfrom the time constraint of liquidation process. RSB\nwas  mandated  to  purchase  and  manage  the  good\nassets of the 56 closed finance companies.\n It com-\nmenced business in March. The initial Government\nownership of RSB would later be diluted through sale\nof shares to the public. One of RSB\u2019s prominent ad-\nvantages was a clean balance sheet.\n\n 21\n\n20\n\nBoT intervened in seven finance companies with\nsolvency problems in May 1998 (see Table 7 for a\nsummary of resolution measures taken for the troubled\n\n22\n\nfinance companies).\nKrung Thai Thanakit (KTT), a\nsubsidiary of Krung Thai Bank (KTB), agreed to pur-\nchase the assets of the seven finance companies at\ntheir market value, and would be granted a bank li-\ncense. However, resolution plans for the seven finance\ncompanies were not clearly laid out.\n\n23\n\nIn August 1998, when the comprehensive financial\nsector  restructuring  program  was  announced,  an\nadditional five finance companies were identified as\nnonviable, partly because they failed to raise new\ncapital.\n BoT ordered them to write down capital\nand  to  reduce  their  value  per  share  to  one  satang\n(one hundredth of one baht).

The  approach  until  then  was\npiecemeal and gradual. In the last three months of\n1997, to restore banking system stability, BoT decided\nto require recapitalization of undercapitalized finan-\ncial  institutions.  For  this  purpose,  foreign  equity\ninvestment in financial institutions was fully liberalized\n24\nfor a period of 10 years.\n\nIn March 1998, BoT issued rules in line with inter-\nnational best practices governing loan classification\n\n25\n\nand provisioning, and interest accrual for banks and\nfinance companies (Box 1). As part of stricter rules\nof loan classification and provisioning standards, BoT\nhad required banks to set provisioning for all loans\nmore  than  six  months  overdue  (effective  31  Dec-\nember 1997) and prohibited the accrual of interest\non loans more than six months overdue (effective 1\nJanuary  1998).\n  The  period  was  subsequently  re-\nduced to three months (effective 1 July 1998), which\nwas the US standard. The authorities also announced\nthat they would continue to strengthen the financial\nsystem by (i) introducing international standards for\nloan classification and provisioning rules, which would\nbe phased in through the end of the year 2000 (end-\n2000 LCP rules);\n (ii) establishing a deposit insur-\nance scheme; and (iii) amending the bankruptcy law\nfor  expediting  foreclosure.  Essentially,  loan-loss\nprovisioning requirements were allowed to be phased\nin  progressively  through  end-2000,  as  a  form  of\nregulatory forbearance.\n\n26\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\f52\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nBox 1: BoT Loan Classification and Provisioning Rules (31 March 1998)\n\n\u25cb\n\nAsset  Classification:  As  of  1  July  1998,  all  accounts  on  which  interest  or  principal  due  have  not  been  received  within\n\n\u25cb\n\nthree months (as opposed to previous six months) from the due date, will be recorded as nonperforming.

However, the amount of provisioning needed comes into effect gradually.\n\n\u25cb\n\nFor the second half of 1998, the financial institutions must set aside 20 percent of the required provisions. The\n\n\u25cb\n\nrequirement will then increase by 20 percentage points  every six months until it fully satisfies the requirement in the\n\n\u25cb\n\nsecond half of 2000 (end-2000 loan classification and provisioning [LCP] rules).\n\nA  comprehensive  financial  sector  restructuring  program  was  announced  on  14  August  1998.  It  stated  that  financial\n\n\u25cb\n\ninstitutions that would adopt up-front the end-2000 LCP standards would be entitled to obtain public funds for Tier-1\n\nrecapitalization.\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn early 1998, four Thai commercial banks (Bang-\nkok  Metropolitan  Bank  [BMB]  in  January;  BBC,\nSiam City Bank [SCIB], and First Bangkok City Bank\n[FBCB] in February) were considered critically un-\ndercapitalized in that they were unable to meet loan-\nloss provisioning rules and recapitalization deadlines\n(see Table 8 for a summary of resolution measures\nadopted for the troubled commercial banks). By May,\nBoT had intervened in the four banks after writing\noff bad loans by reducing shareholder capital to the\nlegal minimum. BoT then converted FIDF loans to\nthese banks into equity and injected additional capi-\ntal (de facto nationalization). However, clear reso-\nlution measures with regard to the four intervened\nbanks were not announced. The remaining 11 com-\nmercial  banks  were  under  pressure  for  recapital-\nization and rehabilitation on their own.\n\nGiven the lack of promising sources of new capi-\ntal in Thailand, share issues were increasingly being\nunderwritten by foreign financial institutions. Bangkok\nBank  (BBL),  TFB,  SCIB,  and  Nakornthon  Bank\n\n(NTB) all increased their foreign ownership ratios,\nalthough they intended to keep foreign shareholdings\nbelow 50 percent for the time being. Indeed, BBL\nand  TFB  raised  Tier-1  and  Tier-2  capital  in  the\ninternational markets. There are banks with foreign\nownership  limits  above  50  percent.  Development\nBank of Singapore acquired 50.27 percent of shares\nin TDB in January 1998, while ABN-AMRO Bank\nof  the  Netherlands  acquired  a  75  percent  stake  in\nBank of Asia in June 1998.\n\nThe Financial Sector Restructuring\nProgram of 14 August 1998\n\nTo address the deteriorating conditions in the financial\nsector, MOF and BoT announced on 14 August 1998\na  comprehensive  financial  sector  restructuring\nprogram.

The availability of Tier-2 capital support would\ndecline over time to encourage early debt restruc-\nturing and new net lending.

AMCs are defined\nas financial institutions in order to allow them to bor-\nrow (excluding deposits) and to relend funds (only to\nexisting customers) as well as to give them full flex-\nibility in setting their interest rates. They provide a\nchannel for banks to separate the \u201cgood assets\u201d from\nthe \u201cbad assets\u201d, to improve the bank\u2019s balance sheets\nand asset quality, and to concentrate on future busi-\nnesses of the \u201cgood banks.\u201d\n\nResolution  of  troubled  banks  and  finance  com-\npanies.

BBC would be liquidated\nand all its performing assets and liabilities transferred\nto KTB, while its staff, branches, and nonperforming\nassets would remain in BBC, which would be turned\ninto a special financial institution owned by FIDF.\nUBB and the 12 intervened finance companies would\nbe absorbed by KTT, after full provisioning and re-\ncapitalization up to 8.5 and 8 percent, respectively,\nwhich  later  would  form  a  new  bank,  Bank  Thai\n(BTH). LTB would be taken over by RSB after full\nprovisioning and recapitalization up to 8.5 percent.\nThe Government would seek a strategic investor for\nRSB, and prepare privatization of KTB and BTH.\n\nProgress Since the 14 August 1998\nProgram\n\nCapital support facility. Thus far, private com-\nmercial banks have been reluctant to take advan-\ntage of the 14 August capital support schemes, par-\nticularly the Tier-1 scheme that would require banks\nto recognize losses upfront and to write down their\nshareholder equity, thus diluting ownership control\nand inviting Government interference, in return for\npublic  recapitalization.  While  several  banks  an-\nnounced their intention to participate, to date only\nSCIB  has  received  Tier-1  capital  support.  Of\nSCIB\u2019s recapitalization amounting to B65 billion, half\ncame from the Government under Tier-1 support,\nand  a  matching  amount  was  raised  from  private\ninvestors.\n SCIB also joined the Tier-2 capital sup-\nport scheme in the fall of 1998, to make progress\nwith  corporate  debt  restructuring,  while  Bank  of\n\n28\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n55\n\nAyudhya (BAY) has announced its interest in tak-\ning advantage of the Tier-2 scheme.\n\nOther  private  banks  have  instead  raised  capital\non their own in the form of equity, innovative Tier-1\ncapital, and Tier-2 capital. They have not applied for\nthe capital support program for fear of dilution of\nshare  ownership  and  excessive  State  interference.\nBBL, TFB, and BAY all raised about B214 billion in\ncapital  by  May  1999,  partly  in  the  form  of  quasi-\nequity instruments, such as Capital Augmented Pre-\nferred Securities (CAPS) and Stapled Limited Inter-\nest Preferred Securities (SLIPS). The issues for BBL\nand  TFB  were  successful  among  investors,  as  the\n29\nCAPS/SLIPS paid a relatively high rate of return.\nCAPS and SLIPS were also attractive to bank own-\ners because they boosted their CARs while prevent-\ning loss of control. Yet, this form of capital is expen-\nsive;  together  with  the  carrying  cost  for  the  large\namount of NPLs, it can strain banks\u2019 preprovision\nprofits and hence their capacity to maintain adequate\ncapital.\n\nIn June 1999, the 14 August capital support program\nwas  amended  to  make  it  more  attractive.  The  key\nchange was the expansion of the types of capital that\nwould qualify to match the injection of public funds to\ninclude any Tier-1 capital already raised via SLIPS\nand CAPS. The change improved market sentiment\nby signaling that public funds were available if the\nbanks  were  unable  to  raise  sufficient  capital  by\nthemselves. However, only B81 billion (27 percent of\nthe total funds available) have been utilized thus far.\nPolicy  measures  adopted  to  encourage  the\nbanks  to  set  up  private  AMCs.  The  Government\nrecently eliminated tax impediments to the establish-\nment and operation of a bank\u2019s majority-owned AMC,\nan alternative to managing the NPLs in-house. The\nBOT released a new regulation in early January 2000,\nwhich allowed (i) private banks to transfer loans to\ntheir majority-owned AMCs at net book value (book\nvalue  less  provision  currently  required  under  the\nphased-in forbearance program), and (ii) AMCs to\nengage in more activities, such as lending to borrow-\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\ners to complement a debt restructuring transaction.\nAs  a  result  several  banks  have  moved  forward  in\nusing private AMCs.  To date, 7 out of 11 Thai com-\nmercial banks have either established or expressed\ntheir intention to establish AMCs.  BBL has created\na wholly owned AMC with registered capital of B500\nmillion, which initially manages  BBL\u2019s foreclosed\nproperties. TFB has created two AMCs: Thonburi\nmanages  the  worst  one  third  of  its  NPLs  and\nChantaburi  manages  NPLs  from  Phatra  Thanakit,\nits recently closed finance company.\n SCB has ob-\ntained an approval to create a wholly owned AMC,\nChatuchak Asset Management Ltd.\n\n30\n\nThe benefit of establishing such private AMCs is\nthat it allows bank management to focus on the good\nbank and new lending, while attracting superior and\ndedicated  management  to  perform  the  specialized\ntask of resolving NPLs. The scheme enables NPLs\nto  be  valued  at  market  price,  and  requires  recap-\nitalization to cover the losses beyond existing pro-\nvisions on transferred NPLs. The current regulation\nallows the remainder of loan losses to be taken in the\nAMC, not in the bank.\n\nResolution  of  intervened  banks.  Early  in  1999,\nSCIB, BMB, and RSB increased their capital through\ndebt-to-equity swaps from FIDF, hired privatization\nadvisors,  and  began  to  prepare  the  sales  process.\nBoT  had  agreed  on  loss-sharing  or  stop-loss  gua-\nrantees on NPLs that would be applied to strategic\ninvestors interested in buying the three banks. In July\n1999, BoT intervened in another bank, NTB, which\nhad failed to negotiate with foreign strategic inves-\ntors for a buy-in, and ordered a capital write-down\nand recapitalization by FIDF.\n\nTo restore international confidence in the financial\nsystem, the Government initiated the sales process\nfor the four intervened banks by providing public\nresources.  NTB  was  the  first  bank  that  was  ac-\nquired  by  a  foreign  strategic  investor,  Standard\nChartered  Bank,  which  agreed  in  September  to\npurchase a 75 percent stake for B12.38 billion. The\ntransaction was structured so that FIDF would bear\n\n\f56\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\n85 percent of the loss and enjoy 95 percent of the\ngain on the ultimate resolution of the existing NPL\nportfolio against benchmark valuations. FIDF would\nalso cover the carrying cost, otherwise known as\nyield maintenance, of the existing NPLs until they\nwere resolved. In another transaction, United Over-\nseas Bank of Singapore (UOB) agreed in November\nto  purchase  RSB  under  another  structure:  UOB\nwould  pay  B6.5  billion  for  a  75  percent  stake  in\nRSB; RSB would have a limited time period to put\nNPLs  at  book  value  into  an  FIDF-owned  AMC;\nand UOB would receive a 0.1 percent fee to manage\nthe AMC  and  would  share  in  the AMC\u2019s  profits\nand losses\u20145 percent and 15 percent, respectively.\nBoth transaction structures were designed to post-\n\npone the sizing and recognition of losses in these\ninstitutions by FIDF, thus attracting investor inter-\nest.  The  Government  would  write  checks  to  the\npurchasers over time.\n\nBMB  and  SCIB  are  expected  to  be  sold  under\nsimilar transaction structures.\n Table 9 summarizes\ncommercial banks\u2019 status at end-June 1999 and their\nassets and estimated NPLs.\n\n31\n\nRecapitalization  and  operational  restructuring\nof  State-owned  banks.  The  Government  plans  to\nprivatize two State-owned commercial banks, KTB\nand BTH, in the next two years after they undergo\noperational restructuring and recapitalization.

In the case of KTB, the Government had\nagreed,  as  part  of  the  14  August  1998  resolution\nmeasures, to inject a total of B185 billion of capital\nas compensation for its acquisition of FBCB and per-\nforming assets of BBC. KTB announced in late 1998\nthat it had completed the first stage of its recapital-\nization, receiving B77 billion from FIDF. In August\n1999, the second stage of KTB\u2019s recapitalization, in\nthe amount of B108 billion, was approved without a\nwrite-down of existing capital. The Government then\nshifted ownership of KTB to MOF and to transfer\nsubstantial NPLs to a new AMC, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of FIDF.\n\nRestoring a Healthy Financial System\nThe  stability  of  the  financial  system  has  been  se-\nverely damaged by the crisis. Financial institutions\ncarry large NPLs on their balance sheets, continue\nto face capital shortfalls, and may pose a serious risk\nto, or even significantly delay the process of, a sus-\ntained economic recovery.

The NPL ra-\ntios were  42.8 percent for the relatively \u201chealthy\u201d\neight private banks, 69.4 percent for intervened banks\nplus KTB, and 67.2 percent for the remaining finance\ncompanies. Only foreign banks registered a low NPL\nratio at 12 percent of total loans (Table 10).\n\nIn the second half of 1999, amounts of restruc-\ntured NPLs continued to climb, and NPLs gradually\ncame  down  to  38.5  percent  of  total  loans  at  end-\n1999.\n Though the worst is over, the magnitude of\nthe problem remains large.\n\n32\n\nLarge NPLs have constrained both the financial\nsystem\u2019s capacity to maintain capital and its ability\nto lend, as many institutions have tended to preserve\n\n33\n\nless risky investment by shifting their assets from\nloans to Government securities. They have also in-\nduced  banks  and  finance  companies  to  engage  in\nrestructuring without immediately recognizing full\nlosses.\n Early resolution of NPLs is vital to restor-\ning the health of the financial system\u2019s capacity to\nmaintain  capital  and  its  ability  to  lend,  as  many\ninstitutions have tended to preserve less risky invest-\nment by shifting their assets from loans to Govern-\nment securities. They have also induced banks and\nfinance companies to engage in restructuring with-\nout immediately recognizing full losses.\n\nAlthough the Government decided not to create a\ncentralized AMC for the banking sector, it encourages\ncommercial  banks  to  establish  their  own  AMCs.\nWhile many private banks have created or are in the\n\nTable 10: Reported Nonperforming Loansa of Financial Institutions\n\n\u25cb\n\nItem\n\nJuly\n\nAugust September\n\nOctober November December\n\n\u25cb\n\n1998\nJune\n\n\u25cb\n\nTotal Commercial Banks\n\n1,832,518\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,924,842\n\n1,996,123\n\n2,149,158\n\n2,252,943\n\n2,352,674\n\n2,350,842\n\nTotal Commercial Banks\n\n5,904,212\n\n\u25cb\n\n5,802,670\n\n5,804,993\n\n5,667,830\n\n5,558,947\n\n5,479,445\n\n5,479,839\n\n     Domestic Commercial Banks\n          Private Banksb\n          State-owned and Intervened Banksc\n     Foreign Full Branch Banks\nTotal Finance Companiesd\nTotal  Financial  Institutions\n\n     Domestic Commercial Banks\n          Private Banksb\n          State-owned and Intervened Banksc\n     Foreign Full Branch Banks\nTotal Finance Companiesd\nTotal  Financial  Institutions\n\nTotal Commercial Banks\n\n     Domestic Commercial Banks\n          Private Banksb\n          State-owned and Intervened Banksc\n     Foreign Full Branch Banks\nTotal Finance Companiesd\nTotal  Financial  Institutions\n\n1,780,260\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,867,406\n\n1,936,294\n\n2,086,016\n\n2,188,168\n\n2,283,199\n\n2,276,598\n\n994,230\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,053,415\n\n1,094,923\n\n1,165,549\n\n1,221,798\n\n1,276,726\n\n1,239,944\n\n786,030\n\n\u25cb\n\n813,991\n\n841,371\n\n920,467\n\n966,370\n\n1,006,473\n\n1,036,654\n\n52,258\n\n\u25cb\n\n57,436\n\n59,829\n\n63,142\n\n64,775\n\n69,475\n\n74,244\n\n257,784\n\n268,315\n\n280,803\n\n288,987\n\n299,433\n\n313,907\n\n323,691\n\n2,090,302\n\n\u25cb\n\n2,193,157\n\n2,276,926\n\n2,438,145\n\n2,552,376\n\n2,666,581\n\n2,674,533\n\n4,959,638\n\n\u25cb\n\n4,893,742\n\n4,902,835\n\n4,829,632\n\n4,754,392\n\n4,710,959\n\n4,723,335\n\n3,293,330\n\n3,230,749\n\n3,228,600\n\n3,160,182\n\n3,096,705\n\n3,059,341\n\n3,063,267\n\n1,666,308\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,662,993\n\n1,674,235\n\n1,669,450\n\n1,657,687\n\n1,651,618\n\n1,660,068\n\n944,573\n\n\u25cb\n\n489,786\n\n\u25cb\n\n908,928\n\n487,447\n\n902,158\n\n484,339\n\n838,198\n\n478,807\n\n804,555\n\n472,691\n\n768,486\n\n469,810\n\n756,505\n\n461,365\n\n6,393,998\n\n\u25cb\n\n6,290,117\n\n6,289,332\n\n6,146,637\n\n6,031,638\n\n5,949,255\n\n5,941,205\n\n31.0\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n35.9\n\n30.2\n\n\u25cb\n\n47.2\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n5.5\n\n52.6\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n32.7\n\n33.2\n\n38.2\n\n32.6\n\n49.0\n\n6.3\n\n55.0\n\n34.9\n\n34.4\n\n39.5\n\n33.9\n\n50.3\n\n6.6\n\n58.0\n\n36.2\n\n37.9\n\n43.2\n\n36.9\n\n55.1\n\n7.5\n\n60.4\n\n39.7\n\n40.5\n\n46.0\n\n39.5\n\n58.3\n\n8.1\n\n63.4\n\n42.3\n\n42.5\n\n48.5\n\n41.7\n\n60.9\n\n9.0\n\n66.8\n\n44.8\n\n42.9\n\n48.2\n\n40.5\n\n62.5\n\n9.8\n\n70.2\n\n45.0\n\na Nonperforming loans (NPLs) are defined as loans 3 months past due.\nb Private banks are Bangkok Bank (BBL), Thai Farmers Bank (TFB), Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), Bank of Ayudhya (BAY), Thai Military Bank (TMB), Bank of Asia (BOA), Thai\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nDanu Bank (TDB), and Nakornthon Bank (NTB).

The Government may\ncreate  more  AMCs  at  the  time  of  the  sale  of  the\nremaining two intervened-in banks (BMB and SCIB).\nThe current Government policy of encouraging a pro-\nliferation of private and FIDF-supported AMCs can-\nnot be successful in cleaning up bank balance sheets\nand achieving high asset recovery unless strong gov-\nernance and transparency are maintained within the\nbank that opts to create its own AMC; it cannot be\nsuccessful unless substantial Government coordina-\ntion and financial support are provided. There are\nseveral reasons for these requirements. First, with-\nout transferring NPLs at market values, the private\n\nAMC approach would simply delay recognition of\nlosses, thus leaving the consolidated balance sheet\nimpaired.  On  the  other  hand,  to  induce  a  bank  to\nrecognize losses at the time of NPL transfer, public\nresources may need to be injected into the bank or\nAMC. Second, without clear separation of responsi-\nbilities to manage and dispose of NPLs between the\nbank and its own AMC, there is a potential risk of\nfraud  and  abuse.  Third,  while  competition  among\ncreditors, private AMCs, and FIDF-supported AMCs\nto dispose of assets quickly may benefit investors\nwho acquire the assets, there is a risk that the lack\nof coordination among the holders of NPLs to the\nsame borrower may result in lower recovery values.\nGiven the systemic nature of the bank NPL prob-\nlem, there is a greater need for strong Government\n\n1999\n\nNPLs (B million)\n\nJanuary February\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\n\u25cb\n\nAugust September\n\nOctober November December\n\n2,349,592\n\n2,530,378\n\n2,537,447\n\n2,533,796\n\n2,557,280\n\n2,482,768\n\n2,482,448\n\n\u25cb\n\n2,457,042\n\n2,361,652\n\n2,322,019\n\n2,230,042\n\n1,983,937\n\n2,271,335\n\n2,451,605\n\n2,451,987\n\n2,449,251\n\n2,472,295\n\n2,396,014\n\n2,390,809\n\n2,363,097\n\n2,279,841\n\n2,243,124\n\n2,155,841\n\n1,922,936\n\n1,281,382\n\n1,295,209\n\n1,293,788\n\n1,294,415\n\n1,302,420\n\n1,222,689\n\n1,215,086\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,208,858\n\n1,128,742\n\n1,104,572\n\n1,072,722\n\n886,898\n\n989,953\n\n1,156,396\n\n1,158,199\n\n1,154,837\n\n1,169,874\n\n1,173,325\n\n1,175,723\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,154,239\n\n1,151,098\n\n1,138,552\n\n1,083,119\n\n1,036,039\n\n78,257\n\n78,773\n\n85,460\n\n84,545\n\n84,985\n\n86,754\n\n91,639\n\n93,945\n\n81,811\n\n78,895\n\n74,201\n\n331,318\n\n170,011\n\n170,645\n\n169,188\n\n172,081\n\n168,072\n\n169,473\n\n\u25cb\n\n161,904\n\n150,150\n\n105,835\n\n102,310\n\n61,001\n\n90,030\n\n2,680,910\n\n2,700,389\n\n2,708,092\n\n2,702,984\n\n2,729,361\n\n2,650,840\n\n2,651,921\n\n\u25cb\n\n2,618,946\n\n2,511,802\n\n2,427,854\n\n2,332,352\n\n2,073,967\n\nTotal Loans (B million)\n\n5,341,347\n\n5,522,579\n\n5,497,601\n\n5,481,698\n\n5,465,696\n\n5,341,317\n\n5,358,383\n\n\u25cb\n\n5,354,064\n\n5,414,308\n\n5,383,839\n\n5,362,817\n\n5,197,943\n\n4,569,259\n\n4,755,734\n\n4,755,122\n\n4,751,874\n\n4,728,074\n\n4,651,085\n\n4,651,773\n\n\u25cb\n\n4,654,395\n\n4,704,863\n\n4,696,804\n\n4,682,370\n\n4,576,299\n\n3,048,613\n\n3,050,132\n\n3,058,031\n\n3,046,231\n\n3,041,325\n\n2,980,358\n\n2,973,859\n\n\u25cb\n\n2,972,280\n\n2,949,540\n\n2,952,308\n\n2,992,560\n\n2,893,746\n\n1,520,645\n\n1,705,602\n\n1,697,091\n\n1,705,643\n\n1,686,751\n\n1,670,728\n\n1,677,915\n\n\u25cb\n\n1,682,115\n\n1,755,323\n\n1,744,496\n\n1,689,810\n\n1,682,553\n\n772,088\n\n460,599\n\n766,845\n\n259,930\n\n742,479\n\n260,482\n\n729,824\n\n257,472\n\n737,622\n\n256,159\n\n690,232\n\n249,904\n\n706,610\n\n248,558\n\n\u25cb\n\n699,669\n\n240,840\n\n709,445\n\n241,159\n\n687,035\n\n188,651\n\n680,447\n\n187,754\n\n621,644\n\n183,106\n\n5,801,946\n\n5,782,509\n\n5,758,083\n\n5,739,170\n\n5,721,855\n\n5,591,221\n\n5,606,941\n\n\u25cb\n\n5,594,904\n\n5,655,467\n\n5,572,490\n\n5,550,571\n\n5,381,049\n\nNPLs/Total Loans (%)\n\n44.0\n\n49.7\n\n42.0\n\n65.1\n\n10.1\n\n71.9\n\n46.2\n\n45.8\n\n51.6\n\n42.5\n\n67.8\n\n10.3\n\n65.4\n\n46.7\n\n46.2\n\n51.6\n\n42.3\n\n68.2\n\n11.5\n\n65.5\n\n47.0\n\n46.2\n\n51.5\n\n42.5\n\n67.7\n\n11.6\n\n65.7\n\n47.1\n\n46.8\n\n52.3\n\n42.8\n\n69.4\n\n11.5\n\n67.2\n\n47.7\n\n46.5\n\n51.5\n\n41.0\n\n70.2\n\n12.6\n\n67.3\n\n47.4\n\n46.3\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n51.4\n\n40.9\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n70.1\n\n13.0\n\n68.2\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n47.3\n\n45.9\n\n50.8\n\n40.7\n\n68.6\n\n13.4\n\n67.2\n\n46.8\n\n43.6\n\n48.5\n\n38.3\n\n65.6\n\n11.5\n\n62.3\n\n44.4\n\n43.1\n\n47.8\n\n37.4\n\n65.3\n\n11.5\n\n56.1\n\n43.6\n\n41.6\n\n46.0\n\n35.8\n\n64.1\n\n10.9\n\n54.5\n\n42.0\n\n38.2\n\n42.0\n\n30.6\n\n61.6\n\n9.8\n\n49.2\n\n38.5\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\f60\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\ncoordination or even for centralizing resolution of\nNPL problems in a Government agency, since the\nGovernment is increasingly becoming a large holder\nof assets: it now holds, through ownership of KTB\nand BTH, 23 percent of total banking sector assets;\nit owns 31 percent if intervened-in banks BMB and\nSCIB are included.\n Through coordination or cen-\ntralization, economies of scale in asset management\ncan be exploited, consistency and transparency can\nbe maintained, and strategies to maximize recovery\nvalue  can  be  developed,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of\ndifferent creditors and individual AMCs competing\nto drive down sales value.\n\n34\n\nBank  recapitalization  needs.  BoT  recently  re-\nported that from January 1998 to July 1999, the 13\ncommercial banks raised a total of B732 billion in\nTier-1 capital. The private banks obtained B305 bil-\nlion (90 percent of their regulatory minimum Tier-1\ncapital) while three intervened banks plus three State-\nowned banks received B427 billion in Tier-1 official\nrecapitalization (53 percent of their projected recapi-\ntalization). This implies that the banking sector has\nabout two thirds of its minimum recapitalization needs,\nestimated to be B1,120 billion (assuming a 60 per-\ncent  loss  rate  on  NPLs  in  State-owned  and  inter-\nvened-in banks and a 40 percent loss rate on NPLs\nin  private  banks).  Intervened-in  and  State-owned\nbanks must raise another B360 billion and private\nbanks B30 billion to satisfy the regulatory minimum\nCAR.\n\n35\n\nAlthough private banks are now largely in comp-\nliance with phased-in capital adequacy requirements\nand  are  not  expected  to  raise  a  huge  amount  of\nadditional capital to satisfy end-2000 LCP rules, in\nreality they still face significant capital shortfalls. The\nreason is that banks\u2019 regulatory CAR requirements\ntend to understate their true capital needs. This, in\nturn, is due to several factors. First, existing loan-\nloss  coverage  is  largely  made  up  of  collateral  of\ninflated  value  and  thus  is  insufficient.  Banks  are\nrequired  to  form  provisions  against  NPLs,  net  of\ncollateral based on the book value reported by banks\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nfor regulatory purposes. Because the reported book\nvalue  of  collateral  is  overstated,  banks  would  be\nforced to write down their capital when recognizing\nthe losses on their NPLs. Second, the provisioning\nguidelines are backward-looking; loans are classified\naccording  to  the  number  of  months  payments  are\ndue rather than on the present value of future exp-\nected  cash  flows  from  the  loan,  discounted  at  the\neffective  interest  rate  on  the  loan  contract.  Under\ninternational accounting standards, the impaired loans\nwould be marked down to the present value of future\nexpected cash flows from the loan. The implication\nis  a  further  capital  shortfall.  Third,  the  regulatory\nCAR requirements underestimate the impact of both\nentry of new NPLs into the system and NPL aging\n(further deterioration of the existing NPLs) on loan-\nloss provisioning needs. With slow and inadequate\ncorporate debt restructuring, the existing NPLs tend\nto  age  into  high-risk  categories  and  some  of  the\nrestructured debts return to NPL status, thus requiring\nfurther provisioning and exacerbating capital short-\nfalls.\n\nIt is crucial that full provisioning be achieved by\nall commercial banks and finance companies, so that\nloan portfolios can be cleaned up and losses fully\nabsorbed. Hence, it is important that banks must fully\ncomplete the recapitalization process. International\nexperience suggests that rapid absorption or recog-\nnition of losses and aggressive restructuring would\naccelerate economic recovery over the medium term,\nas it facilitates real sector restructuring and restores\nbank  lending  capacity.  If  recapitalization  and  loss\nabsorption enhancement continue to be delayed, a\nfinancially  weak  banking  system  may  impede\nsustainable corporate restructuring and hamper eco-\nnomic recovery.\n\nRestructuring  of  State-owned  commercial\nbanks. State-owned commercial banks, particularly\nKTB, need to be more decisive in both operational\nrestructuring and NPL resolution. Without operational\nrestructuring, recapitalization is unlikely to improve\nthe  balance  sheet.  Managements  of  State-owned\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n61\n\nbanks are reluctant to make decisions on NPL reso-\nlution that involves loss recognition because they are\nafraid of being prosecuted for the wrongful actions of\nState employees. Although it has been affirmed that\nthe case of debt restructuring would be exempted, the\nlack of clear legal indemnity for KTB employees will\ncontinue to slow NPL resolution. Transfer of NPLs to\na newly created AMC is expected to minimize this\nproblem and accelerate the resolution process.\n\nThe Nexus of Financial and\nCorporate Restructuring\n\nCorporate  Sector  Distress\n\nA  serious  corporate  debt  problem.  In  the  first\nhalf of the 1990s, debt-financed overinvestment in a\nnumber of sectors, including construction, property\ndevelopment, and petrochemicals, had resulted in high\nleverage and reduced performance of Thai corpora-\ntions.  Debt-to-equity  ratios  for  these  sectors  grew\nsteadily over the years prior to the crisis. From 1994\nto the second quarter of 1997, the average ratio for\nall  nonfinancial  sectors  rose  from  1.5  to  2.1.  The\nsharp  baht  depreciation  that  started  in  July  1997\nmagnified the level of debt measured in the domestic\ncurrency, further raising the debt-to-equity ratios. In\naddition, high interest rates increased domestic-debt\nservicing obligations.\n\nThe  financial  position  of  the  corporate  sector\ncontinued to deteriorate throughout 1998. For the first\ntime, operating profits for 340 nonfinancial firms listed\non the Stock Exchange of Thailand, on average, fell\nbelow interest expense. As a result of accumulated\nunpaid debts and declining levels of equity, the average\ndebt-to-equity ratio of the listed firms reached 3.6 in\nthe first half of 1998. In terms of corporate distress,\nthe construction and real estate sectors were most\nseverely affected. By end-1998, NPLs measured on\na three-month basis grew to 49 percent of domestic\ncommercial  bank  loans.  Of  these,  over  two  thirds\nwere believed to require both operational and financial\nrestructuring or liquidation.

There were nearly 400,000\nclassified loans in Thailand, totaling B2.6 trillion as\nof August 1999. The distressed loan problem could\nbe divided into large, medium, small, and individual\ncases. There were roughly 700 large distressed loans\nwhich  exceeded  B500  million  each,  representing\nB930 billion (36 percent of the nation\u2019s total classified\nloans).  Medium-size  distressed  loans,  with  5,600\ncases between B50 million and B500 million per case,\nrepresented  B780  billion  (30  percent).  The  small\ndistressed loans, under B50 million per case, were\nspread over 42,600 cases and represented B560 billion\n(21 percent). Finally, there were 350,000 individual\ncases,  representing  B350  billion  (13  percent).\nAlthough  distressed  loans  existed  in  nearly  every\nbusiness sector, manufacturing and real estate were\nthe hardest hit. Because Thailand has a larger volume\nof distressed loans to SMEs than other crisis-affected\ncountries,  restructuring  Thai  corporate  debt  will\nrequire far more effort.\n\nEstablishing Institutional\nFrameworks  for  Corporate\nDebt  Restructuring\n\nThe process of corporate debt restructuring is com-\nplex and involves difficult legal, regulatory, and ad-\nministrative reforms, not to mention changes in local\nbusiness practices and financial culture. Since April\n1998, the Government has undertaken initial steps to\npromote voluntary, market-based corporate restruc-\nturing. The Government\u2019s policy response has been\nto provide\n\n\u2022 Tax and regulatory incentives to corporations and\n\nbanks;\n\n\u2022 Effective  legal  framework  for  asset  recovery\nthrough  court-based  bankruptcy,  court-super-\n\n\f62\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nvised reorganization, or enforcement of security\ninterests;\n\n\u2022 Well-structured out-of-court process for volun-\ntary debt restructuring negotiations, within the\nFramework for Corporate Restructuring in Thai-\nland; and\n\n\u2022 Regulatory  (prudential)  incentives  for  NPL\n\nresolution to banks.\n\nTax and regulatory incentives. The Government\nhas granted a full set of tax incentives for corporate\nrestructuring. The initial step was to reduce tax dis-\nincentives by giving some temporary relief, between\n1  January  1998  and  31  December  1999,  on  asset\nsales and debt restructuring by financial institution\ncreditors (including related asset transfers and sales),\nand mergers and acquisitions (corporate and finan-\ncial). The time frame was intended to induce early\naction by debtors and selected financial institution\ncreditors, while avoiding moral-hazard problems and\ncontingent liabilities in the medium term. In August\n1998, exemptions from income tax, value-added tax,\nspecific business tax, and duty stamps were provided\nin restructuring cases, where debt restructuring would\nresult in imputed income to the debtor. In September\n1998, debt write-off was allowed to be considered\nan expense, thereby reducing a financial institution\u2019s\ntax liability. Similarly, debt restructuring losses were\nalso  considered  an  expense  for  tax  purposes.  In\naddition, a tax cut on real estate transfers from 2 to\n0.01 percent has been approved.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nhas relaxed requirements for corporate rehabilitation\nby reducing the approval period from 45 to 30 days\nand making some approval criteria less stringent\u2014\nfor example, by adopting a disclosure-based over a\nmerit-based  approach  for  SMEs.

Ensuring creditor rights to enforce their legal\nclaims, through court-based bankruptcy or reorgani-\nzation procedures or both and foreclosing on collate-\nral, is an important component of the corporate debt\nrestructuring framework. Such legal arrangements act\nboth as a forced restructuring or asset recovery pro-\ncess  and  as  a  credible  threat  to  induce  voluntary\nworkouts.  The  effectiveness  would  depend  on  the\nwillingness of creditors to use the courts, which in turn\nwould  depend  on  the  effectiveness  with  which  the\ncourts would be able to process petitions, manage the\nplanning and approval process, and execute judgments.\nThe  formal  court-based  bankruptcy  and  reorg-\nanization procedures have been improved. In April\n1998, the Bankruptcy Act was amended to enable\nreorganization of potentially viable corporations. The\nreorganization  amendment  proved  workable  in  its\nearly  usage,  but  several  problems  emerged  which\nlimited  its  utility  in  resolving  large  amounts  of\ndistressed debt.\n The lack of a well-functioning pro-\ncess for exercising security rights was a key obstacle\nto rapid progress in corporate restructuring. While\nforeclosure laws predated the crisis, they suffered\nfrom numerous flaws that rendered them effectively\nunworkable.\n\n38\n\n37\n\nAs a result, in March 1999, after a long period of\ndebate, the Bankruptcy Act was further amended to\ninclude  (i)  improved  security  for  new  lending  to\nfinancially  distressed  corporations,  (ii)  voting  by\ncreditor class, (iii) rescission of related-party trans-\nfers, (iv) limits to discretion for court action, and (v)\nconversion of foreign-currency-denominated claims.\nNotably,  this  amendment  lowered  the  approval\nthreshold for a court-supervised reorganization plan\nto 50 percent of outstanding debt by number and value,\nplus a special resolution of 75 percent of the outstand-\ning debt of one creditor class by value.\n The cre-\nation of a specialized bankruptcy court, the Central\nBankruptcy  Court,  was  also  approved;  the  court\nopened in June 1999.

It also includes a 13-step timetable\nfor  the  process.\n\n42\n\nIn  October  1998,  CDRAC  was  strengthened\nthrough the appointment of a Working Group, which\nwas to facilitate and coordinate restructuring efforts\nof  200  priority  restructuring  cases  (actually  353,\nincluding  subsidiaries  and  affiliates)  identified  by\nCDRAC members. The companies covered a broad\ncross-section of Thai industry, with concentrations\nin manufacturing (48 percent), real estate (18 per-\ncent), wholesale/retail (12 percent), and construction\n(6  percent).  Their  debt  totaled  B630  billion,  each\ncompany owing roughly $39.5 million on the average.\nBy the summer of 1999, the list of target cases had\nexpanded to 702 corporations, which represent nearly\nB1.5 trillion, or 56 percent of total NPLs in Thailand.\nIn March 1999, CDRAC strengthened the volun-\ntary debt restructuring framework by developing two\ncivil contracts between parties to a restructuring plan\nthat allows CDRAC to enforce a timetable for resolu-\n\ntion, approval process, and exit procedures. The two\ncivil contracts are the Debtor-Creditor Agreement\n(DCA)  and  the  Inter-Creditor  Agreement  (ICA).\nDCA is intended to produce agreement on a restruc-\nturing plan, submission to intercreditor arbitration, or\npetitions for foreclosure or insolvency within six to\neight months. ICA is intended to facilitate intercreditor\nagreements (Box 3).\n\nRegulatory (prudential) incentives given to banks.\nTo encourage banks to restructure their holdings of\ncorporate debt, BoT relaxed classification rules for\nNPLs once the loans were restructured. For example,\nafter debt restructuring, banks were allowed to re-\nclassify \u201cdoubtful\u201d or \u201closs\u201d loans (with provisioning\nrequirements of 50 and 100 percent, respectively) as\n\u201csubstandard\u201d  (with  a  20  percent  provisioning  re-\nquirement);  once  the  debtor  properly  serviced  the\nloan for three months, the loan could be reclassified\nas \u201cnormal\u201d (with a provisioning requirement of only\n1 percent).

The public support would come in the\nform of subordinated debt.\n\nProgress  of  Corporate\nDebt  Workout\n\nRelative to the magnitude of the problem, such as\nthe size of NPLs, corporate debt restructuring has\nonly  recently  begun  to  yield  some  visible  results.\nProgress in corporate debt restructuring was slow in\n\nTable 11: Progress of Corporate Restructuring\n\n1998, with completed restructuring of only B157 bil-\nlion at end-1998. Since then, a few large manufac-\nturing firms (e.g., UCOM with $570 million of debt)\nhave restructured their debts. By the end of 1999,\nthe pace of creditor approvals of restructuring plans\nimproved, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nThe cumulative total of restructured debt reached\nB1,070 billion by end-1999, while the total amount of\ndebt in the restructuring process was at B1,120 bil-\nlion. Although the overall completion rate now stands\nat  47  percent,  the  amount  of  restructured  debt  is\nequivalent  to  52  percent  of  total  reported  NPLs\n(B2.07 trillion).

The net result is that debtors often fail to restruct-\nure their business and operations and, consequently,\ncannot  generate  sufficient  cash  flows  to  service\nrescheduled debts. The lack of quality debt restructur-\ning stems from several factors:\n\n\u2022 Private banks have avoided debt restructuring\nthat includes debt relief, partly because of the\noptimistic hope of a stronger economic rebound\nand partly because of concerns about credit dis-\ncipline (other creditors might begin demanding\nwrite-offs) and their own capital shortfalls.\n\n\u2022 State-owned  banks  fear  that  their  executives\ncould be sued for losing public funds due to debt\nrestructuring.\n\n\u2022 The  long-term  business  relationship  between\ncreditors  and  debtors  has  delayed  the  real  re-\nstructuring process because of the unwillingness\non both sides to resort to drastic measures that\nresult in loss recognition and loss of ownership.\n\u2022 The amended Bankruptcy Act has not proved\nto be fully effective in enforcing credit discipline\nand debt restructuring. As a result, the legal pro-\ncedure has not been an effective threat to alter-\nnative, voluntary out-of-court settlements.\n\n\u2022 The CDRAC framework is weak and ineffective\nin inducing voluntary settlements. Its ability to\nprovide effective mediation services, to use arbi-\ntration in disputed cases, and to impose penalties\non those who delayed the process is limited.\n\na Data refer to the debt of target cases owed to domestic commercial banks.\nSource: Bank of Thailand.\n\n44 \n\nCDRAC monitors 1,727 \u201clarge target debtors,\u201d\nof which 568 firms have signed the Debtor Creditor\nAgreement (DCR). These 1,727 cases represent over\nB2.1 trillion.\nAs of January 2000, 271 \u201clarge target\ndebtors\u201d (B704 billion or 34 percent of outstanding\ndebt) have successfully reached restructuring agree-\nments, 357 cases (B436 billion or 21 percent) are in\nrestructuring process, while 227 cases (B461 billion\nor  22  percent)  failed  to  reach  agreements  and  are\nnow in process of court action. So far, all cases com-\npleting the CDRAC process are performing accord-\ning  to  new  restructured  agreements,  and  have  not\nreverted back into NPL status.\n\n45\n\nBankruptcy progress. Through December 1999,\nunder the new and specialized Central Bankruptcy\nCourt, 441 petitions were filed, of which 416 were\nsmaller liquidation cases with a total value of B11\nbillion.\n Since the reorganization section was intro-\nduced, 37 petitions for bankruptcy reorganization have\nbeen received by the courts, of which 25 have been\naccepted  for  business  reorganization,  representing\ntotal outstanding debts of B153 billion or 42 percent\nof the B363 billion total filed. To date, 3 petitions\nhave been rejected by the court, 14 petitions are un-\nder  process,  and  8  restructuring  plans  have  been\napproved by creditors.

Further-\nmore, a stable and robust financial sector reduces\nthe risk of a systemic financial crisis in the future.\nIt is therefore important to address the overall in-\ncentive framework for the financial sector in order\nto encourage the financial system to act as a pru-\ndent and efficient intermediary of savings. Issues\npertaining to this framework include structural, le-\ngal, regulatory, supervisory, incentives, and infor-\nmation improvement.\n\nAn Inadequate Precrisis Framework\n\nSince its banking crisis in the mid-1980s, Thailand\nhad  strengthened  its  financial  system.  It  ensured\nthat the fundamentals were right by keeping real\ndeposit interest rates positive, by gradually liberal-\nizing its financial system, and by strengthening the\nsupporting institutional framework. These efforts\nwere successful in mobilizing household savings,\nintermediated mainly through banks, as demonstrated\nby the size of credit provided by the banking sector\nas a ratio of GDP. In addition, they provided fund-\ning for high private investment and contributed to\nrapid economic growth. Nonetheless, financial sec-\ntor reform was unable to secure a sound financial\nsystem. Long-festering structural weaknesses led\nto the development of many vulnerabilities from the\nmid-1990s onward, as revealed by the 1997 finan-\ncial crisis.\n\nThe  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for\nfinancial institutions was not conducive to prudent\nbanking. Although deregulation, particularly in the\nfinance company sector, had increased competition,\nresulting  in  a  decrease  in  the  franchise  value  of\nfinancial institutions, it did not motivate them to act\nprudently. The problem was worsened by scattered\nand lax supervision, by regulators who engaged in\nforbearance, and by weak overall supervisory and\nproblem recognition capacity. To compound matters,\nThailand  also  had  weak  accounting  and  auditing\n\n\f68\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nstandards, poor financial disclosure, and inadequate\ncorporate governance of financial institutions. Mar-\nket oversight was limited due to poor information, a\nconcentrated ownership structure, and cross-owner-\nship links between financial and nonfinancial enti-\nties. In addition, incentives for market oversight were\nreduced with a bailout of many weak financial insti-\ntutions following the crisis of the mid-1980s.\n\nThe resolution framework for problem financial\ninstitutions  remained  incomplete  as  the  exit  rules\n(rules governing liquidation, closure, and merger of\ninsolvent  banks  or  finance  companies)  were  not\nclearly defined, without any effective framework for\nsupervision.  The  absence  of  explicit  intervention\npowers limited the ability of the authorities to deal\npromptly and properly with financial sector distress.\nIn addition, supervision was institutionally fragmented\n(the legal powers for supervision were concentrated\nat  MOF  while  BoT  was  charged  with  the  daily\nsupervisory  authority).  As  a  result,  the  authorities\ndid not intervene in insolvent finance companies in\nthe early phase of the 1997 financial crisis. Instead,\nthey used FIDF to provide liquidity support to finance\ncompanies and resorted to the issuance of a \u201cblanket\nguarantee\u201d  for  depositors  and  creditors  to  restore\npublic confidence in the financial system.\n\nBox 4: Objectives of Financial Sector Laws\n\nImproving the Bank Supervisory\nand Regulatory Framework\nIn response to the crisis, the Government has emb-\narked on a comprehensive reform of banking super-\nvision. Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that major\nreforms  have  been  initiated,  major  weaknesses\npersist.\n\nLegal  and  legislative  changes.  A  number  of\nmodifications in the framework for financial services\nprovision are expected to be made in the near future\nthrough the following: the new Financial Institutions\nLaw, the new Central Bank Law, the new Deposit\nInsurance Law, changes in SEC and stock exchange\nlaws and regulations, as well as other regulatory and\nsupervisory  changes.  The  changes  are  significant\n(Box 4), involving a (re-)definition of the role of fi-\nnance companies, modification of minimum capital\nrequirements, and definition of the extent and mo-\ndalities of foreign ownership. The authorities are also\ncommitted to replacing the general guarantee with a\nself-financed deposit insurance scheme with limited\ncoverage, and laying down an adequate framework\nfor the timely exit of problem institutions.

There are several problems\nrelated to supervision. First, most legal powers for\nsupervision are concentrated in MOF, whereas the\nday-to-day supervision rests exclusively with the BoT.\nThis has blurred the lines of responsibility and ac-\ncountability,  and  made  the  decision  process  too\nlengthy and complex. Second, current legal provi-\nsions  do  not  provide  sufficient  guidance  or  legal\nground  to  the  supervisory  agency  to  discharge  its\nresponsibilities (e.g., lack of consolidated supervision\nor narrow definition of connected lending). Third, the\nsupervisory  agency  has  broad  discretion  to  grant\nexemptions from legal provisions or to enforce sanc-\ntions. This unlimited discretionary power\u2014combined\nwith the frequent absence of clear prudential criteria\nfor the waiver of legal provisions or for a decision if\nsanctions are to be applied\u2014has resulted in signifi-\ncant prudential forbearance, in the waiver of legal\nlimits beyond prudential consideration and in delayed\nsanctions. The new financial laws are expected to\naddress some of these weaknesses.\n\nThe clear definition of legal powers, removal of\nsupervisor discretion, development of detailed guide-\nlines, and strengthening of technical skills are intended\nto provide a regime with strict enforcement of bind-\ning rules.

Moreover, BoT\u2019s functions must be im-\nproved by greater internal communication, genuine\nacceptance of new supervisory approaches, greater\ninvolvement of junior staff, and more open discus-\nsions among the staff. Finally, more significant ex-\nternal hiring and building on the recent creation of\nthe School for Examiners will prove critical in fur-\nther strengthening BoT\u2019s supervisory capacity.\n\nAn  explicit  deposit-protection  scheme. A  key\nelement of the financial sector reform strategy is to\nphase out the August 1997 comprehensive guaran-\ntee to all depositors and to adopt a more restricted\ndeposit-protection  scheme  once  financial  markets\nstabilize. It is important that the new framework on\ndeposit  insurance  include  (i)  a  clear  institutional\nframework to manage the deposit-protection scheme;\n(ii) a funding mechanism; (iii) mandate, duties, range\nof  insured  deposits,  and  payment  modalities;  (iv)\nmonitoring and corporate governance; and (v) strict\nexit and prompt corrective action procedures.\n\nBroader  operating  environments.

Yet they\nstill fall short of the protection granted in developed\ncountries and are undermined by a weak judicial sys-\ntem. The effectiveness and transparency of the Thai\njudicial system is very poor, hindering efficiency and\nintegrity of the legal environment as it affects the\nfinancial sector. Further improvements in this area\nare  necessary.\n\nThailand has made some progress over the course\nof the crisis in moving its incentive framework in the\nfinancial sector closer to global best practice. As the\n\n\f70\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nscope for market discipline may be limited, in part\ndue  to  the  highly  concentrated  ownership  in  the\neconomy, greater reliance will, however, have to be\nplaced on improving supervision and owners\u2019 disci-\npline. Supervision can be enhanced by reducing the\namount of discretion of supervisors (through a cata-\nlogue of penalties, for example) in dealing with insti-\ntutions that are weak and undercapitalized or that do\nnot comply with the prudential regulatory framework.\nThe catalogue can also increase the roles and duties,\nincluding the legal liability, of owners, and contain\nstrict rules on early intervention in weak financial\ninstitutions.\n\nThe  Medium-term  Agenda\n\nThe current system still exhibits deficiencies and falls\nshort of international best practice in several areas.\nOver  the  medium  term,  Thailand  should  focus  its\nreform efforts in the following three areas:\n\nIncreasing  financial  sector  competitiveness.\nThailand\u2019s banking system has been highly concen-\ntrated. Partly as a result of the Government\u2019s restruc-\nturing efforts over the last year, the banking industry\ncontinues to be highly concentrated; the three larg-\nest banks accounted for over 40 percent of financial\nsystem assets at end-1998. While the degree of con-\ncentration does not differ greatly from that in some\nindustrialized countries, it has, in the past, hampered\ninnovation and diversification, and impeded the de-\nvelopment of private securities markets. The con-\ncentration has, in part, been due to limited and un-\nfair competition from other financial institutions and\nfrom a lack of substitution through other forms of\nfinancial intermediation. Most importantly, there has\nbeen  a  lack  of  a  credible  threat  of  competition\nthrough entry.\n\n47\n\nThailand has restricted entry almost completely,\nwith no new domestic banking licenses granted in\n1965-1997.\n High minimum capital requirements (in\nabsolute amounts) and limits on foreign ownership\nstill prevent the entry of new financial institutions.\nUnder the draft Financial Institutions Law, the au-\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nthorities are considering granting BoT an absolute\nauthority to prescribe conditions and grant or deny\nlicenses. BoT would need to be guided by objective\nand transparent criteria (including, at a minimum,\nthose  of  Basle  Core  Principle  3)  and  not  by  eco-\nnomic-needs tests. It should employ clear and objec-\ntive standards in assessing the applicant institution\u2019s\nownership structure and the fit-and-proper test for\nowners and managers. The existing restriction of 25\npercent foreign ownership of financial institutions\ncould be relaxed, subject to specific conditions; branch\nrestrictions on foreign banks that limit the operations\nof foreign financial institutions to one branch should\nbe removed. These are important as Thai banks need\nto upgrade their skills and institutional development.\nLower minimum capital requirements with a transpa-\nrent  process  for  reviewing  new  banking  licenses\nwould greatly enhance the contestability of the Thai\nsector. Finally, Thai banks\u2019 capacity to manage as-\nset, liabilities and risks has to be strengthened.\n\n48\n\nMoving  to  a  more  balanced  financial  system.\nRelative  to  those  in  most  other  emerging  market\neconomies  with  per  capita  incomes  similar  to\nThailand\u2019s, the Thai financial system is very deep,\nwith financial assets to GDP ratio of 150 percent.\nThe Thai system is, however, significantly bank-ori-\nented, with more than 70 percent of financial assets\nin banks, and with very limited financial intermedia-\ntion through mutual funds and other types of institu-\ntional investors. Bond and stock markets remain rela-\ntively underdeveloped, with outstanding bond mar-\nket issues accounting for 12.5 percent of GDP and\nstock market capitalization amounting to 19 percent\nof GDP as of June 1998. The equity market lacks\ntransparency and plays a limited role in corporate\ngovernance as family control over firms continues to\ndominate. The unbalanced pattern of financial inter-\nmediation has made the economy disproportionately\nmore vulnerable to internal and external shocks to\nthe  financial  sector.  Better  securities  markets  are\nneeded, as they can be a competitive force for the\nbanking  system  and  because  banks  and  securities\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n71\n\nmarkets are complementary sources of finance. The\nfunctioning of capital markets can be furthered by\nenforcing minority shareholders\u2019 rights and by im-\nproving the corporate governance framework.\n\nA  better  definition  of  the  scope  of  financial\nservices. There is a clear need to develop the med-\nium-term scope of the financial services industry. Li-\ncenses for different financial services are still frag-\nmented and the organizational structures allowed for\ndifferent types of financial activities are not neces-\nsarily optimal from either a risk or an economies-of-\nscope point of view. While it is too early to move to a\nfull-fledged integrated banking system, the authori-\nties could rationalize the various types of licenses\nprovided.\n In this context, the policy of allowing dif-\nferent types of commercial banks may need to be\nreconsidered.\n\n49\n\nWhile the finance company sector has been sig-\nnificantly restructured, the issue of the future role of\nfinance  companies  and  commercial  banks  must  be\naddressed. In an effort to further consolidate the fin-\nance company sector, BoT announced in December\n1998 that finance companies could apply for a limited\nbank license, which would permit them to undertake\nall activities allowed for commercial banks, except for\nchecking accounts. The phasing out of finance com-\npanies may be accelerated as they become restricted\nbanks, or go into securities business, or be eliminated;\nexpanding finance companies\u2019 activities does not nec-\nessarily present a long-term solution.\n\n50\n\nConcluding  Remarks\nIn 1997-1998, Thailand experienced one of the most\nsevere economic contractions in its recent history.\nThe crisis was brought about by several factors.\n\nFirst,  the  steep  baht  depreciation  caused  large\nexchange losses to Thai borrowers, particularly busi-\nness firms, which had large amounts of foreign-cur-\nrency-denominated debt. Because most of the bor-\nrowers left their debts unhedged, they saw them in-\nflate in baht terms and, consequently, faced serious\nrepayment difficulties.\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n51\n\nSecond, a severe credit crunch emerged as a result\nof the collapse of several major financial institutions in\nthe spring of 1997, suspension of 16 finance companies\nin June and 42 in August, closure of 56 finance com-\npanies in November, and loss of confidence in the fi-\nnancial system.\n For fear of possible losses of depos-\nits (or equivalents), the general public began to shift\ntheir deposits away from finance companies to com-\nmercial banks, and from small and medium-size banks\nto quality domestic or foreign banks. Financial institu-\ntions became increasingly reluctant to extend commer-\ncial loans, as they attempted to protect the quality of\nassets and to maintain sound balance sheets. Measures\nto strengthen the balance sheets of financial institu-\ntions\u2014i.e., stringent provisioning requirements against\nNPLs, prohibition of overdue interest accruals, and\ncapital adequacy requirements\u2014all made banks and\nfinance companies even more conservative in their\nlending behavior. The need for provisioning and capi-\ntal requirements became even larger as bank NPLs\ncontinued to rise in the course of the crisis.\n\nThird, difficulties in rolling over international bank\nloans made Thai commercial banks even more cau-\ntious about lending, precisely because of their subs-\ntantially reduced access to international bank loans.\nFinally, the initial, austere macroeconomic policy\nadded further deflationary pressure on the economy.\nTight monetary and fiscal policy measures weakened\nalready-shrinking aggregate demand, and the financial\nsector restructuring measures had the side effect of\naggravating the credit crunch. Although confidence\nin the baht began to be restored in early-1998 and\nfiscal policy was reversed to an expansionary stance,\nthe economy continued to contract throughout 1998.\nThailand had embarked on rapid financial market\nderegulation and capital flow liberalization in the first\nhalf of the 1990s. However, its financial system was\nnot resilient enough to adjust to an increasingly global\nenvironment:  Thai  commercial  banks  and  finance\ncompanies  borrowed  large  amounts  of  short-term\nfunds domestically as well as from abroad at attrac-\ntive terms, and aggressively extended loans for do-\n\n\f72\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nFigure 8: Consolidated Public Sector Debt\n\nmestic investment. Commercial banks and finance\ncompanies  had  not  acquired  sufficient  know-how,\nskills, expertise, or human capital to exercise pru-\ndent asset-liability management and risk controls. The\nauthorities continued to provide explicit and implicit\nguarantees to protect financial institutions or to stop\nthem from going bankrupt, thereby creating serious\nmoral-hazard problems in the financial sector. Regu-\nlation and supervision of commercial banks and fi-\nnance companies were both inadequate and lax. In\naddition,  standards  of  disclosure,  accounting,  and\nauditing were generally weak. Essentially, the precrisis\noverextension of financial activity was a fundamen-\ntal cause of the crisis.\n\nThe  most  important  lesson  is  that,  in  order  to\nmaintain a stable economy, a country that is highly\nintegrated with the rest of the world financially, such\nas  Thailand,  must  establish  a  resilient  and  robust\ndomestic financial system. That is, domestic financial\ninstitutions should be sufficiently capitalized with\nadequate  loan-loss  provisions  and  must  have  the\ncapability and expertise to prudently manage assets\nand liabilities. The authorities should maintain effective\nregulatory and supervisory framework over banks\nand nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) as well\nas  effective  disclosure  and  accounting  standards.\nThey should protect financial market integrity but not\nguarantee the solvency of individual financial ins-\ntitutions. With a resilient financial system in place,\nbanks and NBFIs can be expected to weather mac-\nroeconomic shocks and asset price gyrations. A com-\nbination of excessive capital inflows and rapid capi-\ntal outflows will then be less likely to have an ad-\nverse impact on the domestic financial system and\non economic activity in general.\n\n52\n\nOne  of  the  most  profound  consequences  of  the\nfinancial crisis has been a dramatic increase in public\nsector debt.\n Total public debt rose from B721 bil-\nlion (15.6 percent of GDP) at end-1996 to B2,140\nbillion  (42.5  percent  of  GDP)  by  the  end  of  June\n1999  (Figure  8).

In addi-\ntion, BoT received balance-of-payments support as\npart  of  the  IMF  package.  Throughout  1998,  public\nsector debt rose as the Government borrowed to fi-\nnance financial system restructuring and additional bud-\ngetary expenditures. Public debt continued to soar in\n1999 as the Government and State-owned enterprises\nborrowed to finance expenditures. By end-2000, pub-\nlic  sector  debt  is  estimated  to  reach  61  percent  of\nGDP\u2014a fourfold increase from the precrisis period.\nFrom end-1996 to mid-1999, the debt-to-GDP ra-\ntio went up by 27 percent. An estimated 3 percent-\nage points of the increase came as the direct result\nof the baht\u2019s depreciation, which inflated the domes-\ntic currency value of external debt, net of impact on\nnominal GDP. Another 13 percentage points stemmed\nfrom a rise in the public sector\u2019s external debt, largely\nthe result of Government and central bank borrowing\nfrom official sources. And the remainder\u201411 per-\ncentage points\u2014was the consequence of the FIDF\nbond issue and other related spending for financial\nsystem restructuring.\n\nThe increase in public, especially Government, debt\nwas inevitable. Although the need for fiscal stimulus\nto an ailing economy would have required a larger\nbudget deficit, there was little fiscal stimulus in 1998.\nOnly in the first quarter of 1999 did modest fiscal\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n73\n\nexpansion begin, and the actual size of the budget\ndeficit has been relatively small. What is important is\nthat the authorities responded to a systemic crisis of\nthe financial system by injecting large amounts of\npublic resources into distressed finance companies\nand commercial banks, which were financed through\nGovernment bonds. The level of public sector indebt-\nedness would be larger than even the published num-\nbers suggest if one considers the large amounts of\ncontingent liabilities the public sector has accumu-\nlated, including guarantees of all third-party liabilities\nof State-owned enterprises.\n\nServicing the public debt will increase pressure\non the Government budget, already weakened by de-\n\nclining tax revenues, high interest payments, and in-\ncreased needs for social sector protection. Budget-\nary pressure is expected to continue in FY2000, as\nthe resolution of financial system distress may re-\nquire additional cost. How public finances fare un-\nder the additional burden will depend on the trajec-\ntory of interest rates, the exchange rate, recovery of\neconomic activity, and the primary balance.

Appendix Table 4 summarizes assets and\nliabilities of commercial banks for the 1990s.\n\n2\nSee Appendix Table 3. The term \u201cfinance companies\u201d in\nthis paper includes both finance companies, and finance\nand securities companies. In 1995, finance and securities\ncompanies were required to split their finance and sec-\nurities businesses into two separate companies, but comp-\nliance was slow. Appendix Table 5 summarizes assets and\nliabilities of finance companies.\n\n3\nSee Appendix Table 6 for a chronology of major financial\nreforms.\n\n12\n\n4\nIn the wake of deteriorating financial market conditions in\n1983-1984, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank of\nThailand (BoT) established the \u201cApril 4 Lifeboat Scheme\u201d\nin 1984 to rehabilitate finance companies. As a result, the\nconditions  of  troubled  finance  companies  improved\nmarkedly. In November 1985, after a series of crises and\nbankruptcies among finance companies, the BoT established\nthe  Financial  Institutions  Development  Fund  (FIDF)  to\nprovide  liquidity  to  ailing  financial  institutions  with\nmanagement difficulties and to restore public confidence.\nSee  Johnston  (1991)  and  Vichyanond  (1994,  1995)  for\nanalyses of the financial crisis in the first half of the 1980s.\n\n5\nMcKinnon and Pill (1996) and Krugman (1998) present\nthe view that overguaranteed and underregulated financial\nintermediaries can produce moral-hazard problems and lead\nto excessive investment for the economy as a whole.\n\n6\nKawai (1997) explains the factors behind capital account\nliberalization in East Asia and its consequences. Sirivedhin\n(1997)  discusses  the  implications  of  financial  market\nderegulation and capital account liberalization for Thailand.\n\n7\nSee Fischer and Reisen (1993) and Kawai (1997).\n\n8\nA large part of nonresident baht deposits was intended\nfor investment in the Thai stock market.\n\nNote that there occurred sharp capital flow reversals in\n1997 and 1998, driven mainly by rapid outflows of banking\nsector  funds.\n\nIn terms of total lending shares, there was no relative\nincrease in lending to real-estate-related sectors. While\nthe total outstanding loans of commercial banks expanded\nby 2.2 times from end-1990 to end-1996, the balance of\nloans  to  the  real  estate  sector  grew  by  only  1.4  times.\nHowever, commercial bank funds appear to have flowed\ninto the real estate sector indirectly through finance com-\npanies affiliated to banks, or via sectors with no apparent\nlinks to real estate. In the case of finance companies, the\ntotal outstanding loans increased by 3.7 times during the\nsame period, while loans to the real estate sector rose by\n4.0 times.\n\nEconometric  evidence  suggests  that  capital  inflows\nthrough commercial banks were a major determinant of\nbank  loans  and  that  such  inflows  were  not  affected  by\ninterest rate differentials between Thailand and the rest of\nthe  world  (Kawai  and  Iwatsubo  1998).  That  is,  capital\ninflows through banks were not sensitive to the movement\nof interest rate differentials, and banks increased their loans\nonce they borrowed from abroad. Essentially, Thai banks\u2019\ndemand for foreign borrowing was interest rate inelastic.\nOn  the  other  hand,  capital  inflows  through  nonbanks,\nincluding finance companies, were positively correlated\nwith the interest rate differential. The high interest rate,\ntogether  with  the  expectation  of  stable  exchange  rates,\nattracted foreign capital to the nonbank sector.\n\nFIDF played an instrumental role in the rescue. However,\nFIDF was unable to differentiate between good and bad\nfinancial institutions. It reportedly provided liquidity at\nsubsidized rates even to sound finance companies at their\nrequest,  which  profited  by  investing  the  liquidity  else-\nwhere for higher returns. FIDF eventually injected a large\namount of liquidity into the financial system.\n\nIt was decided that the funds required for this purpose\nwould be raised through issues of Government-guaranteed\nbonds.  However,  the  Property  Loan  Management  Org-\nanization lacked financial backing due to its small capital\nand  the  fact  that  the  issues  of  bonds  and  short-term\nsecurities covered by MOF guarantees were limited to 12\ntimes its capital.\n\n10\n\n11\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n9\nThe government tried to improve the access of domestic\nentities  to  international  capital  markets  through  the\nbanking system and gave BIBF banks tax incentives and\npreferential treatment in their operations.\n\nCriteria included (i) recapitalization guidelines, with rec-\nommended capital adequacy ratios starting at 12-15 per-\ncent for the first year (higher where shareholders were\nunchanged) and declining to 10 percent in the third year,\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n75\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\nwith a concomitant introduction of the progressively more\nstringent loan classifications; (ii) FIDF conversion of its\nloans into equity permitted only after the capital of exist-\ning shareholders fully written down; and (iii) FIDF debt\neligible for repayment up to a maximum period of eight\nyears.\n\nBy the time of the closure of 56 finance companies, FIDF\nhad provided an estimated B530 billion liquidity support\nto them, and B160 billion to other finance companies.\n\nTwo finance companies that escaped closure were al-\nlowed  to  reopen  for  business  in  March  1998:  Kitnakin\nFinance and Securities and Bangkok Investment.\n\nThis  obstructed  restructuring  of  loans  owed  to  the\nintervened-in finance companies, as well as syndicated\nloans  in  which  the  finance  companies  served  as  one\ncreditor. The problem was later rectified by developing\nprocedures to accelerate the sale of syndicated loans.\n\nAbout  97  percent  of  the AMC\u2019s  assets  are  real  estate\nloans, and 70 percent of the collateral which secures these\nloans is raw land. Given the poor legal regime for debt\ncollection, the AMC\u2019s strategy for resolution of real es-\ntate-related loans consist of (i) taking title to the collateral\nin a voluntary compromise, (ii) providing the borrower\nwith a buy back option at the AMC\u2019s cost plus margin, (iii)\nseeking some new money from the borrower, and (iv) en-\ntering into a joint venture with the same borrower/devel-\noper in which that party manages the assets over time.\nThe AMC will sell loans or take legal actions over time. It\nwill sell loans or take legal actions against debtors only in\na small minority of cases because the AMC sees its man-\ndate as being supportive of its debtors. The impact this\nmay have on other debtors and creditors may further hurt\nthe banks and the credit culture.\n\nRSB  created  two  subsidiaries\u2014one  finance  company\n(Radanatun  Finance)  and  one  securities  company\n(Radanadsub Securities). The first business undertaking\nof Radanatun was the successful auction of one group of\nthe hire-purchase loans in June 1998.\n\nHowever, the assigned objective of RSB was subse-\nquently  changed  partly  due  to  the  blend  of  assets  of\nvarious qualities for the auction by FRA and partly due\nto RSB\u2019s merger with Laem Thong Bank (LTB), which\nwas intervened in August 1998. The merger with LTB\nprovided RSB with the nationwide branches that would\nhelp improve its competitive edge with other commercial\nbanks.\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\nThe seven finance companies were Nava Finance and\nSecurities,  Bangkok  Asian  Finance,  Mahatun  Finance,\nProgressive  Finance,  Erawan  Trust,  KSIT  Finance  and\nSecurities, and Union Asia Finance .\n\nThe five finance companies were Dhana Siam Finance\nand Securities, First City Investment, Vichirathanatun. Fi-\nnance, Thai Summit Finance and Securities, and Industrial\nFinance  Corporation  of  Thailand  (IFCT)  Finance  and\nSecurities.\n\nRestrictions on foreign ownership of commercial banks\nwere eased so that foreign funds could be used to rescue\nfinancial institutions. Foreign nationals can now acquire\nover 49 percent of shares in financial institutions, although\nshareholdings must be reduced to 49 percent or lower in\n10 years\u2019 time. They can also acquire over 49 percent of\nshares in finance companies, and in November 1997 the\nmaximum ratio of interlocking share ownership was raised\nfrom 10 to 49 percent.\n\nHowever, properly valued collateral could be deducted\nfrom the amount of loans when determining the amount of\nprovision.\n\nBanks were not required to pay a specified amount of\n\nloan-loss provisions all at once but in stages by 2000.\n\nOther conditions included (i) submission of a reorganiz-\nation and restructuring plan, and (ii) empowerment of the\nnew major equity investors or the Government so as to\nreplace management after existing shareholders recognized\nlosses.\n\nThe Thai Military Bank has been proposing to raise a\ntotal of B30 billion Tier-1 capital, of which about B15 bil-\nlion would come from the 14 August capital support pro-\ngram and the rest would take the form of innovative capi-\ntal instruments.\n\nEven  when  banks  book  no  earnings  in  one  year  and\nhence  pay  no  dividends  for  preferred  shares-cum-sub-\nordinated  debentures,  investors  can  receive  about  11\npercent from the investment, 6 percentage points above\ncurrent deposit rates.\n\nChantaburi is expected to take over bad assets of Phatra\nThanakit (PT) at current net book value (B30.8 billion as of\nJune 1999). Proceeds from the sale of PT\u2019s assets will be\nused to repay its B50 billion liabilities; FIDF agreed to\nprovide no more than B4.4 billion for any shortfall, byond\nwhich TFB is responsible. TFB and FIDF will split any\n\n\f76\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nChantaburi profits one-third/two-thirds respectively. This\narrangement requires TFB to take on losses in its subsid-\niary in excess of its equity investment. In July 1999, TFB\nannounced that it would transfer B80 billion in NPLs to an\nAMC and, for this purpose, raise an additional B24 billion\nin equity.\n\nA centralized AMC was used for the first time for the\nsale of RSB to carve out NPLs from intervened banks. An\ninvestor would have an option to either bid for the whole\nbank  and  enter  into  profit-and-loss  sharing  agreements\nwith the Government, as in the case of NTB, or bid for\nonly  its  good  assets  after  carving  out  bad  assets  to  an\nAMC, as in the case of the sale of RSB.\n\nThis ratio, however, does not include assets purchased\nby the AMC from the FRA or NPLs transferred to private\ncommercial banks\u2019 wholly owned AMCs.\n\nRestructuring without immediately recognizing full losses\nis further facilitated by a recent change in debt restructur-\ning rules which allows banks to classify NPLs as perform-\ning immediately after restructuring agreements.\n\nPushing this argument one step further, the Government\nmay take a more aggressive, centralized approach to NPL\nresolution. That is, it may create a centralized AMC that\nwould acquire, manage, restructure, and dispose of com-\nmercial  banks\u2019  bad  assets.  When  carving  out  the  NPLs\nfrom the banks being restructured, the AMC may replace\nthe  bad  assets  with  Government  bonds  on  the  banks\u2019\nbalance sheets. The NPLs are owned by the Government\nand may be managed by the AMC, partially contracted out\nto private managers, or even left with the banks themselves\nto service. Such a centralized AMC may be created by (i)\nconverting  FRA;  (ii)  combining  FIDF-supported  AMCs\ncreated for BBC, RSB, and KTB into one; or (iii) establishing\na new one absorbing existing public AMCs.\n\nHowever, a third of the private banks\u2019 Tier-1 capital in-\ncreases were in the form of innovative capital (Capital\nAugmented Preferred Securities or Stapled Limited Interest\nPreferred Securities), which need to be refinanced after\nfive years.\n\nNonetheless, significant legal and regulatory challenges\nremain. Among these is the requirement to purchase shares\nfor  cash,  and  then  to  have  the  debtor  use  the  cash  to\nrepay debt.\n\nFirst, because it was a new legal framework, the institu-\ntional capacity for implementation was still being deve-\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\nloped. Like the banking system, the judicial system had\nto become more acquainted with the analytical treatment\nof  distressed  corporations.  Second,  both  debtors  and\ncreditors were reluctant to use the legally binding pro-\ncess without some precedents. Finally, financial institu-\ntion creditors needed to demonstrate their ability to force\ncourt-supervised  reorganizations  and  to  replace  unco-\noperative  debtor-management  with  creditor-imposed\nplanners.\n\n38\n\nThe process of claim, judgment, execution, and collec-\ntion on security supporting a loan would often take more\nthan 5 years, and sometimes as long as 10. Debtors fre-\nquently delayed judgments by failing to respond to court\nsummons. Debtors would contest or appeal judgments,\nfurther delaying the execution. Because liquidation of col-\nlateral offered such low and uncertain returns, the \u201cfloor\nprice\u201d guiding the voluntary or formal debt restructuring\nefforts was very low\u2014the terms offered by debtors for\nrestructured debt were far below what creditors consid-\nered acceptable. The most developed bankruptcy reorgan-\nization case, Alphatec, was initially rejected by the lead\ncreditor primarily because of a low recovery rate.\n\nIn a compromise with the Senate, the time period for a\nperson to be considered bankrupt was established at three\nyears.\n\nCDRAC is chaired by the BoT governor and includes\nfive  associations  (Thai  Bankers\u2019  Association,  Foreign\nBankers\u2019  Association,  Federation  of  Thai  Industries,\nChamber  of  Commerce,  and  Association  of  Finance\nCompanies) representing creditors and debtors.\n\nThe  \u201cLondon  Approach\u201d  is  used  to  guide  voluntary\ndebt restructuring in the UK. It describes a set of principles\nunder which creditors agree to keep credit facilities in place,\nseek  out-of-court  solutions,  work  together,  share  all\nrelevant information about the debtor, and recognize the\nseniority of claims.\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\nThe 13 steps are as follows: (i) initial debtor-creditor\nmeeting; (ii) creditors meeting, appointing the lead bank;\n(iii) creditors\u2019 submission of claims; (iv) ongoing creditors\nmeeting; (v) debtor management\u2019s  submission of financial\ndata; (vi) appointment of an independent accountant; (vii)\ndebtor\u2019s  submission  of  further  information;  (viii)  plan\nsubmission; (ix) creditors meeting on the plan; (x) amend-\nments to the plan; (xi) continued examination of the plan;\n(xii) new creditors meeting, if necessary; and (xiii) decision\non whether to privately reorganize, formally reorganize, or\nliquidate.\n\n\fTHE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING IN THAILAND\n\n77\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\nFinancial institutions were required to adjust their loan-\nloss  provisions  to  the  stricter  standards  in  20  percent\nincrements,  starting  with  the  second  half  of  1998  and\nprovisioning fully by year-end 2000 (end-2000 LCP).\n\nThe amount exceeds the total NPLs in the financial sys-\ntem because CDRAC target cases also include proactive\nrestructuring of non-NPLs.\n\nThe $362 million (B14 billion) restructuring of Alphatec\nElectronics was Thailand\u2019s first approved formal reorga-\nnization plan under the 1998 reorganization amendment.\nA consumer products firm reached an agreement with\ncreditors in the first large voluntary restructuring with-\nout a major strategic investment; a telecommunications\nfirm reached an agreement with creditors in the first vol-\nuntary debt restructuring involving international bond-\nholders. A provision allowing banks to temporarily hold\nmore than 10 percent of a borrower\u2019s equity in a debt-\nequity swap was tested, as Thai Danu Bank took a re-\nported 46 percent equity position in a distressed carpet\nmanufacturer. Finally, Thai Petrochemicals reached an\nagreement with major creditors on a restructuring plan,\nwhich is now being circulated for general ratification. It\nis the country\u2019s largest restructuring case with over $3\nbillion in outstanding debt.\n\nReforms have also been initiated to enhance the role of\nthe  board  of  directors  and  audit  committees.  Although\nnew amendments to the bankruptcy and foreclosure laws\nrepresent major progress, full implementation will require\nfurther judicial reform.\n\nLast year BoT issued one new domestic banking license\nand five new licenses for branches of foreign banks: to\nRadanasin and to five foreign banks (mostly of Japanese\norigin) which converted their BIBF licenses into full for-\neign branch licenses.\n\nThai banks\u2019 average operating expenses are similar to\nthose in other East Asian economies and slightly lower\nthan those in many developed countries, except for Ja-\npan, and other developing countries. This, however, re-\n\nflects inadequate investments in risk management and in-\nternal control management systems (which are capital in-\ntensive), as has been revealed during and following the\ncrisis. As a result, costs were low, but at the expense of\nrisk management practices.\n\n49\n\nIn particular, more integrated banking would permit Thai\nbanks to fully realize informational advantages, econo-\nmies of scope, diversification benefits, and increased rev-\nenues. Moreover, as integrated banks have to report their\nactivities  on  a  consolidated  basis,  it  would  increase\ntransparency for market participants and the supervisory\nauthority. While a full-fledged integrated banking system\nhas  some  risks,  the  authorities  could  implement  policy\nmeasures to keep them to a minimum. Measures include\ncredible mechanisms to prevent the extension of the safety\nnet  for  deposit-taking  financial  institutions  to  other\nfinancial activities. The authorities also could limit, at least\ninitially, the extension of powers to engage in securities\nmarkets and other noncredit financial activities to banks\nthat have strong capital positions and the internal capacity\nto manage the associated risks appropriately.\n\nIn the past, at least, the inability of finance companies to\nraise stable, low-cost funding through deposits was one\nimportant factor in motivating them to undertake risky\ninvestments.\n\nIto and Pereira da Silva (1999) report that Thailand faced\na  typical  credit  crunch  in  the  early  phase  of  the  crisis,\nmainly because of the second and third factors.\n\nThe  public  sector  lacks  consolidated  figures  of  its\nown debt. Public sector debt is the sum of total Gov-\nernment  domestic  and  external  debt,  State-owned\nenterprise domestic and external debt, and external debt\nof monetary authorities converted to baht by the end-\nof-the-period  exchange  rate  (World  Bank  Thailand\nOffice 1999).\n\nIf Thailand generates a primary surplus of 2-3 percent of\nGDP over a period of 10 years, it can reduce the debt-to-\nGDP ratio to a sustainable level (30 to 35 percent).\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\u25cb\n\n\f78\n\nA STUDY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nReferences\n\nand Lessons.

weaknesses of the country\u2019s financial\nsystem  and  corporate  sector.  Prior  to  the  crisis,\nThailand had embarked on a comprehensive liberal-\nization  of  domestic  financial  markets  and  capital\naccount transactions. As a result, financial institutions\nbegan to enjoy a more liberal economic environment,\nincluding increased business opportunities with the\ncorporate and household sectors as well as favorable\nfunding terms from domestic and foreign sources.\nHowever,  Thailand\u2019s  financial  system  was  not\nsufficiently sound or resilient to cope with problems\ncreated by large inflows of deposits and foreign funds\nas  well  as  the  subsequent  expansion  of  domestic\ncredit. Consequently, the credit boom and bust that\npreceded  the  baht  crisis  was  a  major  problem  for\nboth the economy and its financial system.\n", "Since  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)\nemerged on the scene in response to the baht crisis,\nfinancial system reform has steadily progressed.
