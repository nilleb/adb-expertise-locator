In order\nfor policymakers to restore the dynamism of Asian firms and ensure sustained\nexport growth in the long term, it is instructive to, first, identify the sources\nof competitiveness of enterprises in this region. This paper, which provides the\ntheoretical framework to RETA 5875, develops a conceptual model to explain\nthe determinants of international competitiveness of Asian firms and offers\nresearch propositions. The model posits that international competitiveness is\naffected by the firm\u2019s human resource orientation, extent of technological\ninnovation, organizational structure, government industrial policy, access to\ncapital, as well as state of the financial market.\n30", "I.       Introduction\nT\nhe international competitiveness of Asian firms has attracted renewed world attention\nfollowing the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. For over a decade prior to the crisis,\nwestern firms looked toward their Asian counterparts to learn the secrets of their success\nin export markets. For example, the first-tier and second-tier newly industrialized economies\n(NIEs), East and Southeast Asia, experienced annual double-digit growth in merchandise exports\nfor more than a decade up to 1996.1The so-called East Asian miracle has usually been linked\nto the unique Asian model of industrial development consisting of the trilateral relationship among\nfirms, banks, and the government (Stiglitz 1996, Wade 1998). Yet, today many of these \u201conce\nsuccessful\u201d firms have either disappeared or are struggling to survive. During the financial crisis,\nmany of the crisis-affected economies experienced declining exports and severe slowdown in overall\neconomic growth (see Table 1). Thus, the apparent loss of competitiveness of the Asian corporate\nsector raises several interesting questions regarding the competitive strength of the East and\nSoutheast Asian model. Were the export success of so many firms based on superficial foundations?\nWhat were the sources of competitiveness of these firms that made them so successful in\ninternational markets?\nTable 1.

It has become\nevident that both the internal and external conditions in which Asian firms operate have changed\nrapidly not only as a result of the structural changes and reforms being undertaken in most of\nthe Asian economies in response to the crisis, but also to changes in global conditions. Domestically,\nthere is increasing pressure in many crisis-affected economies to change the government\u2019s role,\nmaking it more transparent and less interventionist. This is because previous collusion among\nfirms, banks, and governments may have led to the misallocation of investment that contributed\nto excess capacity, real estate bubbles, or both. Globally, the renewal cycle of product and process\ntechnologies is shortening, and the impact of information technologies on industries is becoming\nmore pronounced. Together, these changes require an appropriate response from Asian firms and\ngovernments if they are to restore their dynamism and provide the basis for sustaining the\ncompetitiveness of Asian enterprises. Government policies will have to be reviewed to ensure\nthat these complement the firms\u2019 efforts to restore their international competitiveness.\nIn light of the strategic significance of the export sector in most Asian economies, and\nin the context of sheer growth in exports from Asia over much of the last two decades, one would\nexpect a large volume of literature on the export competitiveness of Asian firms. Surprisingly,\nthe subject remains one of the most understudied areas of international business. There are several\nplausible explanations for this neglect. First, cross-country, firm-level data that can be readily\ncompared is difficult and expensive to obtain. Second, because international competitiveness is\na distributed field of knowledge requiring cross-functional integration of expertise, it has not\nbecome the domain of any academic discipline. Third, the resulting lack of intellectual focus has\nhampered the development of competitiveness theories suitable for fostering research, although\nrecent integration of theories from economics and business has broadened the understanding\nof the dynamics of the subject. Most existing theories of competitiveness relate to the experience\nof firms in advanced developing countries. Theories that relate specifically to small and\ntechnologically undeveloped firms in developing economies, such as in Asia, remain undeveloped.\nHence, to fill this gap in the literature, the paper draws on existing work from economics and\nbusiness to develop an integrated model reflective of the dynamics at work between the internal\nand external environment of Asian firms and their competitiveness.\nThis paper adds to the existing theoretical and methodological literature on competitiveness\nby addressing two main issues related to small underdeveloped Asian enterprises competing in\nglobal markets. The paper provides the methodological framework to the research being undertaken\nunder RETA 5875: International Competitiveness of Asian Economies: A Cross Country Study.\nFirst, the paper identifies the main determinants of international competitiveness. Second, research\npropositions are developed to offer insights for researchers interested in further exploring the\nconceptualization and measurement of competitiveness Five factors are identified as the most\ncritical for the international competitiveness of enterprises, namely, (i) technology, (ii) human\nresources, (iii) organizational structure, (iv) government, and (v) role of capital and finance. Although\nthe effects of each of these factors on the international competitiveness of firms have been\n2", "Section II\nTheoretical Consideration and Conceptual Framework\ninvestigated individually before, no attempt has been made to develop a comprehensive model\nthat  considers these factors together. Technology and human resource alone, for example, may\nhave little effect on a firm\u2019s competitiveness but can play a much more important role when\nembedded in an organization structure effectively coordinated both internally and externally.\nThus, there is a strong case for competitiveness researchers to distinguish between the complete\nsystemic view of international competitiveness and the mere adoption of traditional approaches\nof a partial framework.\nII.       Theoretical Consideration and Conceptual Framework\nThe concept of international competitiveness, although controversial,2 continues to attract\nplenty of attention from policymakers worldwide. This is perhaps the result of lack of a better\nindicator for countries to benchmark their performance. Most measures of competitiveness so\nfar have been at the national level (see for example The World Competitiveness Report, IMD 1999),\nand generally refer to the ability of a country to produce goods and services that meet the test\nof international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real income of\nits citizens (Commission on Industrial Competitiveness 1985). Because competitiveness ultimately\ndepends upon the firms in the country competing successfully in domestic and international\nmarkets, attention has recently shifted toward competitiveness at the firm level. At the firm level,\ncompetitiveness is generally understood to refer to \u201c\u2026the ability of the firm to retain and, better\nstill, expand its global market share, increase its profits and expand\u201d (OECD 1993, Clark and\nGuy 1998). According to traditional economic theory, a firm can gain competitive advantage through\ncomparative cost of production by, for example, reducing labor cost. However, recent research from\nthe management field suggest that nonprice factors are equally important determinants of\ncompetitiveness. The range of nonprice factors is diverse and include human resource endowment,\nsuch as skills; technical factors such as research and development capabilities and the ability\nto innovate; and managerial and organizational factors, both internal to the firm and externally\norganized through relationships with other bodies, customers, suppliers, public and private research\ninstitutes, and other firms (Clark and Guy 1998). Together, these factors determine the ability\nof the firm to compete successfully in international markets in the face of changing technological,\neconomic, and social environments. Export profitability and the ability of the firm to maintain\nits market share remain the ultimate indicators of international competitiveness.\nAccording to Porter (1990), four conditions that incorporate both internal and external\nfactors need to be present to allow firms compete successfully. These include (i) factor conditions,\nsuch as the availability of skilled labor and infrastructure; (ii) demand conditions for the products\n2 Krugman (1994) argues that national competitiveness is a meaningless concept and the obsession with the\nconcept is both wrong and dangerous. Porter (1990) also comes close to the position that the term competitiveness\nof a nation makes no sense and argues that a country cannot be \u201ccompetitive in all industries\u201d.\n3", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nof the industry; (iii) related and supporting industries including competitive suppliers; and (4)\nfirm strategy, structure, and rivalry. Together, these four factors create the context in which firms\nare born and compete (Porter 1990). In addition, recent research also emphasize path dependency,\nwhich relates to history and the development of features specific to a particular nation, as also\nbeing an essential determinant of competitiveness. There is a well-developed literature that ascribes\na strong role to national capabilities, characteristics, and policies in conferring technological and\ncompetitive advantage to firms, particularly in developing countries. A central aspect of this view\ninvolves networks and interactions among firms, universities, research centers, and government\norganizations comprising a national system of innovation or NSI (Bartholomew 1997) that enhance\ntheir ability to grow (Kaounides 1999). Within this framework, government policies aimed at\nstrengthening a country\u2019s NSI generally contribute to the competitive advantage of firms in that\ncountry (Aoki et al. 1997). Furthermore, the resource-based perspective of the firm (Barney 1991)\nemphasizes the ability to create entry barriers in order to discourage competitors from imitating\nand duplicating their successes. Accordingly, a firm can gain and sustain its competitiveness in\ninternational markets by its ability to leverage on organizational resources and skills that are\nvaluable and rare (Coyne 1985); nonimitable (Lippman and Rumelt 1982, Barney 1986); and\nnonsubstitutable (Barney 1991). Thus, while micro factors are important determinants of\ncompetitiveness, the nature of the external environment in which firms operate and the relationship\nfirms develop with outside organizations are increasingly being recognized as integral elements\nof competitiveness at the firm level.\nThe different theoretical explanations of competitiveness above explain the competitiveness\nof mostly large corporate firms in advanced developing countries and therefore are not entirely\nappropriate for firms in Asian developing countries. For example, the resource-based view approach\n(Barney 1991) suggest that firms derive their competitiveness by producing unique products and\nby creating entry barriers to prevent others from imitating their activities. This is not entirely\nrelevant for firms from underdeveloped countries in Asia, which are characterized as being\ngenerally small, technologically underdeveloped with unskilled workers, and operate within an\nunderdeveloped financial sector. To explain how these firms can enhance their competitiveness,\nwe borrow elements of the different theoretical perspectives above in developing a conceptual\nmodel reflective of the experience of Asian firms. In particular, our model postulates that firms\ncan enhance their competitiveness by (i) being flexible and working cooperatively with outside\norganizations, (ii) being innovative, and (iii) being human resource-oriented. To the extent that\nthe external factors facing firms are also important, we further argue that ultimately the\ncompetitiveness of firms also depends on the role the government plays in supporting business\nand industrial development. A major constraint facing Asian firms in the postcrisis period has\nbeen access to adequate financial resources. We incorporate this element in our model and argue\nthat access to capital in a well-developed and stable financial sector is crucial for firms to grow.\nThe model in Figure 1 shows the linkages between the internal and external factors\ndiscussed above. The internal factors include technology, human resource, and organizational\nstructure. The second component of the model includes external factors consisting mainly of the\n4", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nrole of the government and the nature of the financial sector. Although finance constitutes an\ninternal resource to any enterprise, the present paper considers macro financial issues and as\nsuch includes it as an external factor. Discussion of these variables and of their effect on\ninternational competitiveness is the central purpose of this section.\nFigure 1.\nAn Integrated Model of International Competitiveness of Enterprises in Asia\nInternalFactors ExternalFactors\nTechnology\nRoleofGovernment\nandICT\nFinanceandCapital\nHumanResource\nOrganizational InteractionCreates\nStructure InternationalCompetitiveness\n(higherexportprofitability,exportmarketshare)\nIII.       Sources of Competitiveness\nA. Technology as a Source of Competitiveness\nTechnology is commonly defined as know-how (Capon and Glazer, 1987) and usually refers\nto product and process technology. Product technology refers to a set of knowledge or innovations\nembodied in a product, while process technology refers to technology embedded in production\nprocesses. Besides product and process technologies, the business literature also highlights the\nimportance of management technology that takes the form of knowledge or skills with\norganizational, social, and human aspects. More recently, rapid development of electronics\ntechnology has also brought attention to the impact of information and communications technology\n(ICT) on the competitiveness of firms. For the purposes of this study we focus on how technology\ncan contribute to the competitive advantage to Asian firms. In particular, we focus on two aspects\nof technology as sources of competitiveness to Asian firms, namely: (i) innovation and technology\nstrategy and (ii) the role of ICT.\n5", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n1. Innovation and Technology Strategy\nInnovation is an interactive and dynamic process and refers to the process of learning\nand knowledge creation through complex interdependencies among technological, organizational,\nand external settings, collectively known as the national system of innovation (Nelson 1993).\nInnovation has been found to be critical in creating and sustaining competitive advantage in\nthe global markets.3 For example, it has been estimated that approximately two thirds of the\nproductivity growth of the United States (US) since the 1930s Depression can be directly or\nindirectly attributed to innovation. Today technology-based sectors generate more than 50 percent\nof US gross national product (GNP), about twice the level just a generation ago (Amin and Hagen\n1998). Similarly, in industrialized economies, more than 50 percent of long-term economic growth\nstems from technological innovations through improved productivity or new products, processes,\nor industries (Grossman 1991). It is therefore not surprising that industrialized countries, which\naccount for two thirds of global manufacturing, spend an enormously large amount of resources\non research and development (R&D) to promote innovation activities. Japan, US, and Western\nEurope alone account for about two thirds of worldwide R&D expenditure (Freeman and Hagedoorn\n1994).\nThe dominance of a few western industrialized countries in world distribution of\ntechnological capabilities implies that most developing countries for instance, remain highly\ndependent on technology transfer and interfirm technology cooperation (Freeman and Hagedoorn\n1994). It should be recognized, however, that in recent years some Asian countries (the NIEs and\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China [PRC]) have experienced rapid increases in R&D activities, and have\ndeveloped indigenous technological capabilities. Nevertheless, the reality is that only few Asian\nfirms have state-of-the-art R&D facilities similar to those found in western industrialized countries.\nThus, the majority of Asian firms continue to be highly dependent on western advanced\nindustrialized countries for their technology and have been described as \u201clatecomers and quick\nfollowers\u201d (Hobday 1995), whose strategies continually involve \u201ccatching up and keeping up\u201d\n(Mytelka 1999; see Table 1). Latecomer firms enter and acquire process technology at early stages\nand then gradually gain control over process technology through incremental process change\nto improve firm productivity and product quality. At the next stage, the quick-follower firms are\nin full command of production skills, engage in process innovation, and start to acquire product\ndesign capability. Firms at the following front runner stage begin R&D activities for process and\nproduct and develop product innovation capabilities. At the fully mature stage, firms with\ncompetitive and leading R&D capability are able to undertake advanced product and process\ninnovation. Thus, a latecomer firm travels backward along the conventional concept of the product\nlife cycle.\n3 This is mostly based on literature of economics of innovation and economics of R&D with Neo-Schumpetarian\nperspective. See Dosi et al. (1988), Best (1990), Lundvall (1995), and Foray and Freeman (1993).\n6", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nHobday\u2019s (1995) notion of a \u201chard slogging\u201d rather than a \u201cleapfrogging\u201d technological\nlatecomer has important implications for understanding the innovation mechanism and\ncompetitiveness of firms in Asia. First, the sources of innovation and the implications of a firm\nbeing innovative vary according to its stage of technological development. Mytelka (1999) argues\nthat different strategies have different objectives and requirements in terms of capabilities, critical\nknowledge, and sources of knowledge (see Table 1). Second, competitive firms can exist even farther\ninside the technological frontier as long as the firm is constantly innovative. This concept has\nobvious measurement difficulties in field studies because it is difficult to quantitatively capture\nthe innovative activities of latecomer firms at the early stages of their evolution. Since such\nactivities are closely related to quality/productivity improvements (e.g., decrease in defect, machine\ndowntime, and unit cost of production), changes in such indicators may be used as proxies to\nthe degree of innovation at the early stage, rather than the traditional proxies like volume of\nR&D expenditures, number of patents registered, etc. In this study, we will propose to use both\nsets of proxies to try and capture firm\u2019s technological dynamism.\nTable 1.

Some elements of one strategy may overlap with others.  For example, cost\nreduction and quality improvement are most sought after capabilities of latecomers too.\nSource:   Mytelka (1999).\n7", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nA recent study by the OECD, for example, argues for close user (buyer)\u2013producer relation,\nan obligational network mode rather than hierarchy, and cooperation based on trust and honesty\nwithin and between organizations to foster innovation. Most Asian firms, for example, would greatly\nbenefit from interfirm technology partnering to upgrade their technological capabilities, although\nevidence suggest that firms from developing countries are virtually locked out from interfirm\npartnerships that concentrate on joint R&D and/or new core technologies such as ICT. However,\nsome Asian firms (in PRC; Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China) have been successful in acquiring\nnew technology through strategic licensing agreements, technology sharing agreements with a\nlicensing contract, or equity joint ventures in which technology transfer is a major objective. In\nthe PRC, for example, the promotion of foreign direct investment policies with focus on technology\ntransfer through joint venture agreements has been very successful in enhancing the flow of\ntechnology from the West (Chadee and Qiu 2000). Thus, firms involved in strategic technology\npartnering with outside organizations, particularly in the West, can speed up the process of\ntechnology transfer through faster adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Privileged access\nto valuable new technology is likely to lead to enhanced international competitiveness.\nOur discussion thus far is summarized in the following propositions:\nP1: Firms that are more innovative (higher R&D expenditure, more patents, more\nnew products, etc.) are generally more competitive in international markets.\nP2: Firms that are more actively involved in technology partnering (through R&D\nalliances, joint venture agreement, licensing, contractual agreements) are more likely\nto adopt new technology and therefore be more competitive than firms less involved\nin interfirm partnering.\nP3: Firms that are at an advanced stage of technological development (quick-follower)\nare more competitive than firms that are less technologically developed (latecomer).\n2. Information and Communications Technology\nInformation and communications technology refers to the collective means of assembling\nand electronically storing, transmitting, processing, and retrieving words, numbers, images, and\nsounds. Although the use of ICT has become more widespread in recent years, empirical\ninvestigation of how it actually impacts on the international competitiveness of firms is lacking.\nAlthough it is widely accepted that ICT can enhance a firm\u2019s overall competitiveness, the fact\nthat it can also erode it is not overlooked. ICT can constitute a threat to a firm\u2019s competitiveness\nby making information and its flows cheaper, easier, and faster, thereby shortening the product\nlife cycle and lowering information-related barriers that consequently erode local market\nadvantages.\n8", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nThe importance of ICT as a source of competitiveness for firms stems from its potential\nto permeate the entire organization. Its successful application in various parts of the firm\u2019s value\nchain can result in increased labor and capital efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, and enhanced\nproduct quality. The coordination of sourcing, production, and logistics coupled with interfirm\nand intrafirm cooperation engendered in a supply chain perspective shifts channel arrangements\nfrom loosely linked business groups to coordinated enterprises focused on efficiency improvement\nand increased competitiveness through lead time reduction (Stank et al. 1999). The use of ICT\nalso allows the firm to respond rapidly to market and consumers (flexibility) by eliminating\nredundant activities and achieving a seamless flow of information, supply, and finished goods\n(Mata et al. 1995).\nICT can also be a source of competitiveness for an enterprise through its potential to deal\ndirectly with end users and respond quickly to market shifts (responsiveness). The database of\nclients, competitors, and suppliers, among others, are an important information source and may\nbe a source of significant competitive advantages. Such databases are not simply a set of\nunclassified data but rather consist of an internal structure of relations, which enables full\nadvantage to be taken of the information contained within. These databases can be mined to\nhelp plan future product lines and individual product offerings. Thus, ICT makes it possible for\nfirms to shift from a product-focused to a market-driven orientation where firms focus on market\nsignals by relying on a sophisticated ICT network.4 The outputs from these processes are enhanced\nproductivity, more competitive price, and improved quality.\nThus, ICT can be a powerful source of competitiveness for firms in international markets.\nThe extent to which Asian firms can use ICT to enhance their competitiveness depends on the\nfollowing five factors:\n(i) access to capital for investing ICT and for continuous upgrade of the stock of\ninformation technology (Freeman 1990, 1994);\n(ii) extent to which ICT is applied to traditional forms of technology (product, process,\nand management) to enhance their productivity, efficiency, flexibility, and cost structure\n(Stank et al. 1999);\n(iii) presence of a clearly defined ICT strategy (Floyd 1997, Abetti 1994, Kashlak and\nJoshi 1994);\n(iv) availability of employees with technical skills in ICT; and\n(v) extent to which managerial ICT skills are developed.\n4 For example, the application of e-commerce enables firms to find ways to be more responsive to changing market\ntrends and to conduct business activities more efficiently and more cost-effectively. Similarly, in the textile industry,\nthe application of computer-aided design technology with automated linkages to embroidery and screen printing\nproduction equipment is routinely used to lower the cost of custom products.\n9", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nThe capital needed to develop and apply ICT can sometimes be large and becomes an\nimportant constraint for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in particular. In addition,\ninvestment in ICT is generally risky and therefore borrowing capital to support ICT development\nwithin the enterprise can be costly. SMEs are also generally faced with lack of in-house skills\nnecessary to master new technology at both technical and managerial levels due to the SMEs\u2019\nweakness in competing with larger firms in recruiting and retaining IT staff. The following\npropositions are made:\nP4: Firms in which ICT strategy is an integral part of corporate strategy and which are\ncommitted to the effective use of ICT are likely to be more competitive than firms without\na clear ICT strategy.\nP5: Firms in which ICT is used widely in the various functional activities (marketing, human\nresources, planning, communication, etc.) are more competitive than firms where ICT is\nnot used widely.\nB. Importance of Human Resources\nThe importance of human resource in enhancing the performance of organizations has\nbeen widely studied. There is little disagreement on the fact that human resources constitute\nthe most important element of the \u201cbundle\u201d of resources that a firm owns, particularly with the\nincreasing importance of innovation and technology as critical sources of competitiveness. Thus,\nhuman resource management (HRM) is valued not only for its role in implementing a given\ncompetitive scenario, but also for its role in generating strategic capability (Barney 1991). HRM\nhas the potential to create firms that are more intelligent and flexible than their competitors\nin the long run and that exhibit superior levels of coordination and cooperation (Grant 1991).\nBy bringing in and developing talented staff and synerzising their contributions within the resource\nbundle of the firm, HRM can lay the basis for sustained competitive advantage (Olian et al. 1998,\nPoole and Jenkins 1996). Given the crucial importance of human resources, one would expect\nall organizations to highly value their human resources. How then can HR constitute a source\nof international competitiveness to an enterprise? In order to address this question, we focus\non two aspects of HRM in creating competitive advantage: human resource orientation and how\nit leads to specific human capital advantage, and importance of education, training, and\ndevelopment.\n1. Human Resources Orientation\nFor the purposes of this paper, the HR orientation of a firm is defined as its systematic\neffort to attract, retain, and develop competent and committed human resources (Lam and White\n1998, Wright and Snell 1991, Wright and McMahan 1992). Generally, firms with a greater HR\n10", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\norientation are likely to have more competent workers (Pfeffer 1994). Consequently they are more\nskilled and are more likely to contribute positively toward the firm\u2019s performance. The advantage\nthat a firm derives from having superior HR orientation is known as human resource advantage\nand can manifest itself in a variety of forms at all levels of the value chain. For example, HR-\noriented firms enjoy substantial cost savings by reducing employee absenteeism and turnover\nrates (Lam and White 1998) as well as benefiting from higher productivity and quality, and\nreductions in defects and turnaround time. Employee turnover is particularly costly in the sense\nthat for each termination there are additional costs of hiring and training new workers (Cascio\n1995), which reduces the price/cost competitiveness of firms. HR advantage consists of generic\nand specific advantages. Generic advantage, by their nature, are easily transferable and\nappropriated by competing organizations and as such do not last long and therefore do not\nconstitute a source of sustained competitiveness. Specific human advantage, on the other hand,\nis less transferable and not easily appropriated by competitors. These include advantages that\nthe firm derives from employees who have acquired knowledge and skills specific to one\norganization in particular and for a specific activity, including personal contacts, relations, as\nwell as other individual qualities such as reputation, experience, judgment, intelligence, or loyalty.\nSpecific human capital advantage constitutes the most important source of competitiveness to\nfirms because of their tacit nature. Hence the following proposition:\nP6: Firms with comprehensive human resource orientation (effective recruitment,\nretention, and development) are more competitive than firms without them.\n2. Education, Training, and Development\nThe importance of various forms of education, training, and development to the performance\nof firms has been extensively investigated. The question that usually arises with respect to training\nand development revolves around the issue of the extent to which the enterprise should provide\ntraining and development to its employees. It is well-established that an educated workforce\nfacilitates the adoption and diffusion of technology, contributes to a more developed national system\nof innovation, and contributes to the technological capability necessary for R&D. Although\nmanagement attitudes and capabilities are crucial determinants for the introduction of new\ntechnologies and processes, it has been argued that even unskilled workers in a modern factory\nnormally need the literacy, numeracy, and discipline required in primary and lower secondary\nschools (Wood 1994, Owens and Wood 1995). Thus, in order to be successful and to be able to\naccess and exploit new technology, firms need an educated and skilled workforce and appropriate\nmanagement capabilities. The question that arises is whether the education system in many Asian\neconomies are meeting the needs of businesses in terms of developing an entrepreneurial culture\nand providing new labor force entrants with the necessary managerial and technical skills.\nGenerally, the higher the level of education of the workforce, the higher the overall productivity\nof capital (Lucas 1988). Generally, the state provides only basic primary and secondary education\n11", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nthat develops generic skills of a public good nature. However, competitive advantage is not derived\non the basis of generic skills but rather from having employees with specific skills that are rare\nand unique. Thus, there is a strong argument for firms to provide in-house training when the\ndevelopment of specific skills is involved. Hence:\nP7: Firms with human resource programs that focus on the development of specific\nhuman capital are likely to be more competitive than those with less focus on the\ndevelopment of specific human capital.\nC. Organizational Structure\nThe debate about organizational structure has evolved around the choice of an appropriate\ndesign for firms, which allows them to derive competitive advantage. The old organizational model\ncan be described as one with extended hierarchy, narrowly segmented job design, rule-bound\nprocedures, and lack of employee autonomy and responsibility. In most Asian countries, this was\nfurther complicated by the presence of tight family control at the top that led to a high degree\nof centralization in decision making and a premium on loyalty. This model worked well in an\nenvironment characterized by stability and certainty (Peters 1988) and where employees performed\nroutine tasks. Extensive hierarchy characterized by a centralized decision making system is\nbelieved to hamper effective management and stifle innovation. It has been referred to as being\nstatic, rigid, and unable to adapt readily to change, much less anticipate it (Tiernan 1993).\nThere has been a general tendency for firms to adopt \u201cflatter\u201d and more open and\nparticipative organization structures with fewer layers. The literature suggests that flat\norganizations allow for more efficient information flows, faster communication, greater flexibility,\ngreater adaptability, and reduced costs, and encourage innovative ideas to flourish (Tiernan 1993).\nThus, flat organizational design appears to have all the dynamic elements that will survive the\nturbulent business environment. As a result, a widely accepted view has emerged that flat\norganizations are \u201cgood\u201d and hierarchical organizations are \u201cbad.\u201d However, it has also been\nsuggested that flat organizational design may simply be reflecting a Western bias (Overholt 1997).\nFirst, there is hardly any empirical evidence that proves that flat organizations outperform well-\nrun hierarchies. Second, the underlying assumptions of flat structures about relationships,\nauthority, and creativity, including characteristics such as fairness and equality are appealing\nto western cultures. But whether they fit the cultural contexts of Asian societies remains to be\ntested (Carroll et al. 1990). Third, a flat organization may be better suited for certain types of\neconomic activity (e.g., knowledge-intensive firms) but not perhaps for all industries specially\nmature industries and those involving routine jobs such as in manufacturing.\nRegardless of the organizational design issue, researchers appear to agree that flexible\nand adaptable organizations are the most successful. Flexible organizations are, by their very\ndesign, organic. They are made up of people who understand the need to constantly change and\n12", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nadapt to the changing environment in order to maintain the firm\u2019s competitiveness. They\ncontinually develop new strategies and adapt to new market realities, and then shift all aspects\nof the organization so that they are congruent with new strategies. Operational flexibility, which\npermits firms to move labor and other resources across national boundaries or business domains,\nallows them to exploit profits opportunities generated by varying country or market environments\n(Tang and Tikoo 1999, Kogut 1985). Although operational flexibility entails significant agency\nand transaction costs, it has been found to be positively related to overall firms performance (Allen\nand Pantzalis 1996, Tang and Tikoo 1999). Hence, the following proposition:\nP8: Firms with organizational designs that create greater flexibility and adaptability\nare likely to be more competitive than firms without such a structure.\nIn order to be flexible and adaptable, organizations need to be less formal and less\ncentralized (Chan and Heide 1992). Whether flexibility and adaptability can coexist with a high\ndegree of centralized decision making, as appears to be the case in some Asian economies, are\nexamined in this study. The study also examines the extent to which firms in Asia are adopting\nthe western models of organizational structures while retaining some traditional essential\ncomponents. Therefore,\nP9: Firms with less centralized and less formal structures are likely to be more\ncompetitive than those with more formal and centralized structures.\n1. Team Work and Clusters\nAnother organizational trend has been to move away from segmented and isolated\nstructures with little communication and interaction between areas and different levels, to a\nstructure where interaction and integration are seen as being essential operational practices\n(Tiernan 1993). This is achieved through team-based operations (Kanter 1983) and networks\n(Charan 1991) spanning across functional areas and hierarchies and networks. Another integrative\nand flexible organizational model is one operating on the basis of clusters (Mills 1992, Drucker\n1992) consisting of collections of workers undifferentiated by rank or job title who operate together\non a semipermanent basis with no direct reporting relationships and only a residual hierarchy\n(Tiernan 1993, Mills 1992, Drucker 1992). By its very nature, cluster-like structures have been\nfound to benefit the organization mainly through increased flexibility (in manufacturing\nenterprises) and increased creativity (in knowledge-based enterprises) because individuals are\nfreer to be more innovative, and therefore, ideas are less likely to be blocked by overloaded\nmanagers.  Clusters also facilitate both vertical and horizontal information flows and lead to\nfaster and more informed decision making.\n13", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nP10: Firms with organizational structures (such as team-based and clusters) that\npromote greater communication among employees at all levels of the organization\nare likely to be more competitive than those less oriented toward the creation and\nexchange of information.\n2. Organizational Learning and Interfirm Relationship\nIn the technologically dynamic environment, knowledge often plays a more important role\nthan a firm\u2019s tangible capital. While knowledge about products, production techniques, customers,\nand suppliers are important, the knowledge and skills required to integrate the different parts\nin the value chain have been found to be a highly inimitable skill. Within such knowledge\ndevelopment system, a distinction is often made between tacit or unarticulated knowledge and\nexplicit or codified knowledge. Tacit knowledge is not easily visible and hard to formalize, making\nit difficult to communicate and share with others (Inkpen 1998), and as such can constitute a\nmajor source of competitiveness. Given the importance of knowledge and learning, firms are\nincreasingly forming  alliances with other organizations (such as suppliers and R&D institutions\nsuch as universities) and participate in networks in order to benefit from innovations derived\nfrom tacit knowledge. Thus, interorganizational relationship is becoming an increasingly viable\noption for the creation of a sustained cooperative advantage (Ring 1996, Eisenhardt and\nSchoonhoven 1996, Lorenzoni and Liparini 1999) through idiosyncratic yet complementary\nresources combination between partnering firms (Kogut 1991). The distinctive competencies of\nexternal players, such as buyers and suppliers, are the main drivers in interfirm relationships\n(Teece and Pisano 1994; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). Research shows that superior performance\nis achieved by firms that rely on tiers of external suppliers and mobilize them to reduce\ndevelopment risk, distribution time, defect rate, and inventory while at the same time enhancing\ntheir ability for innovation and flexibility (Helper 1991, Womack et al. 1990, Nishiguchi 1994).\nThus, interfirm networks and strategic alliances can provide an effective way to organize knowledge\ntransfer and access scattered,specialized knowledge (Lorenzoni and Liparini 1999, Dyer 1996,\nInkpen 1998).\nP11: The more connections an enterprise has (with suppliers, R&D institutions,\ndesigners, etc.) and the more involved it is in networks, the greater the possibilities\nto learn from other organizations and benefit from ideas that contribute to its\ncompetitive advantage.\nAlthough it is generally recognized that interfirm relationship promotes learning through\nthe sharing of ideas, not all firms have the managerial capability to identify and successfully\nexploit interfirm relational opportunities. Thus, one of the strategic capabilities of the firm is\nits ability to integrate knowledge (Grant 1996) from different sources and to transform dispersed,\ntacit, and explicit competencies into a wide body of organizational knowledge (Nonaka 1994).\n14", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nAn important factor in determining the extent of learning taking place in networks and alliances\nis the amount of trust between partners (Inkpen 1998). Generally, relationships characterized\nby arms-length transactions, informal contracts, and a lack of codified and structured contracts\nindicate a high level of trust, a feature commonly found in Asian business networks.\nP12: The higher the amount of trust an enterprise has with its network partners\n(suppliers, subcontractors, etc), the greater the possibilities to learn, and therefore\nthe more competitive the firm is likely to be.\nD. Role of the Government and Competitiveness\nUntil the Asian financial crisis, the rapid growth and success of firms in the Asian miracle\neconomies in international markets had been attributed largely to the proactive role of their\ngovernments. The governments in most high-performing Asian economies are known to have\nactively supported their export sectors through policies aimed at creating environments conducive\nto growth and development of the export sector. However, East Asian governments have\ntraditionally intervened to supplement and stimulate the market (Aoki et al. 1997) by coordinating\neconomic activities when there is market failure or when markets do not exist at all, rather than\nreplacing it. This selective approach to industrial development has been successful because of\nthe trilateral coalition between government, institutions, and firms and has been identified as\na major factor in the rapid development of Korea (Amsden 1989) and Taipei,China (Wade 1990).\nHowever, the Asian financial crisis has cast doubts on the traditional role of the government in\nAsian countries. It has been suggested that collusion among the government, banks, and firms\nmay have even led to the crisis through the misallocation of investment, which contributed to\nexcess capacity and real estate bubbles. Thus, the controversial nature of the role of the government\nin Asia raises several important questions with regard to the nature, form, and effects of the\nrole that the government can assume in restoring the competitiveness of Asian firms in the future.\nIn order to address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature (Porter 1990, Dunning 1999,\nAoki et al. 1997, Wade 1990) on the role of the government as it relates to the competitiveness\nof Asian firms. In the following subsections we focus on three main areas where the government\ncan play a constructive and critical role in promoting the international competitiveness of Asian\nfirms. Second, we discuss the government\u2019s role as a provider of public goods. Following the market-\nenhancing view, the role of government in improving market coordination is also discussed.\n1. Industrial Policy\nIndustrial policy is the most direct measure to influence a firm\u2019s performance. The\ngovernment can directly influence the competitiveness of firms within an industry by financially\nsupporting various activities of the firm. However, because financial assistance to enterprises\ncan be viewed as subsidies, care should be taken not to subject the firm\u2019s exports to countervailing\n15", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nand antidumping duties. Thus, direct grants and tax breaks are two trade-neutral forms of\nassistance which Asian governments have used to enhance the development of specific technologies\nthat would otherwise not be realized because of certain market failures. For example, direct grants\nin the form of public funding and tax breaks have been targeted toward R&D for the development,\nadoption, and diffusion of electronics, information, and communications technology in Korea\n(Amsden 1989) and Taipei,China (Wade 1990). The provision of direct grants to support specific\nactivities involves the difficulties of deciding which sector to support and the danger of creating\nnear monopolies in the process. In this respect, tax breaks, which involve less interference in\nthe marketplace, constitute a more attractive alternative means of support. Nevertheless, the\nexperience of several East Asian economies with selective policies suggest that by and large,\ngovernments in these economies have been successful in avoiding the dangers associated with\nthe selective nature of direct grants by ensuring that the policies were flexible in adapting to\nchanging market conditions and did not permit rent seeking. Thus, by providing direct grants,\nthe government can assist firms overcome market failures and upgrade their technological\ncapabilities thereby enhancing their competitiveness.\nP13: The provision of government grants and tax incentives to stimulate the\ndevelopment of specific industries is likely to enhance the overall competitiveness\nof firms within the industry.\n2. Provision of Public Goods\nNational systems of innovations and states continue to have an important role to play\nin a global economy (Cantwell 1999). Evidence suggest that firms from countries with well-\ndeveloped NSIs are usually more innovative and competitive. These countries usually spend a\nlarger proportion of their GNP on both physical and social infrastructure through government\ninvestments in roads, bridges, port facilities, transportation networks, education, training, R&D,\nand health facilities. The creation of advanced infrastructure is an important element of\ncompetitiveness and has been linked, for example, to the rapid growth rates of selected regions\nin the PRC. Conversely, poor infrastructure acts as a deterrent for investments as it generally\nis associated with higher levels of inefficiency and higher costs structures. Hence, government\ninvestment in public infrastructure helps create an efficient and low cost transportation and\ndistribution network that in turn contributes positively to the competitive advantage of firms.\nThe provision of basic education (primary and secondary) and of adequate health care contributes\ntoward a healthy and educated labor force; an important element of competitiveness. Hence, if\nthe NSI is to be included, then industrial policy should come under it. It might be useful to include\ngood infrastructure (public goods) and political stability as variables within that.\nP14: The greater the commitment of the government in developing the NSI (through\nexpenditure on physical and social infrastructure), the more competitive firms are\nlikely to be.\n16", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\nOther types of public activities where the government can be involved to enhance the\ncompetitiveness of firms include the promotion of innovation-related networks such as regional\nsystems of innovation, university\u2013industry cooperation, and science parks. The benefits to\nuniversity\u2013industry cooperation include a stimulus to innovation by the exposure of university\nresearch to industry, the encouragement of more industrially oriented research by universities,\nand the encouragement of more industrially relevant training of young scientists and engineers\n(Clark and Guy 1998). Science parks at national or local levels comprise various firms and\ninstitutions in close proximity for the encouragement of innovation-related networks (Clark and\nGuy 1998). They provide a mechanism allowing knowledge bases (public research organizations,\nuniversities, private R&D organizations) to be exploited by firms through interactions. The benefits\nof science parks arise mainly from agglomeration (many firms, customers, and suppliers in close\nproximity); synergy (different firms interacting with each other); and firm expansion (growth of\nindividual members of the cluster). Science parks also provide a conducive environment where\nhigh technology firms can benefit from interactions with nontechnical firms (i. e., marketing and\nmanagement firms). Interfirm collaboration in R&D can also reduce cost, reduce duplication of\neffort, and provide economies of scale (Mowery and Rosenburg 1989). Such collaboration is\nparticularly beneficial to SMEs when R&D projects are large and expensive.\nP15: Government intervention aimed at promoting interfirm collaboration generally,\nleads to enhanced competitiveness.\n3. Export Market Assistance\nThe role of government in facilitating export marketing activities is becoming an\nincreasingly important determinant of competitiveness for small and medium-size firms competing\nin the global market place. The types of activities that the government may support include\ninternational market research, international market intelligence of a strategic nature, improvement\nof the national image through brand recognition particularly when consumers have strong negative\nprior beliefs about the products of a particular country, and providing assistance with market\naccess issues. Generally, small and medium-size firms do not have adequate resources, skills, and\ncapabilities to undertake such activities. In addition, small and medium-size firms selling in the\nglobal market place often face competition from well-organized multinationals with far greater\nresources to devote to advertising and marketing and to secure preferential access to markets.\nBecause firms are usually reluctant to undertake market research of a public good type, government\nassistance in developing new and existing export markets is generally beneficial, not only to export\nfirms but also to input suppliers associated with exporters. Thus, there is a strong case for public\nprovision of export assistance such as those provided in Singapore and Taipei,China where the\ngovernments are actively involved in developing foreign markets for their small and medium-\nsize enterprises.\n17", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nP16: The provision of marketing assistance (such as market intelligence, market\nresearch, trade promotion, brand development etc.) aimed at developing export\nmarkets enhances the competitiveness of firms.\nE. Importance of Capital and the Financial Sector\nThe financial resources of an enterprise constitute one of the most important determinants\nof competitiveness. The continued growth of firms depends on their ability to finance their\noperations adequately as well as on the stability of the financial sector from which capital is\nsourced. Thus, firms\u2019 access to capital from a well-developed and stable financial sector comprising\nbanking and nonbanking institutions is a prerequisite for their success in international markets.\nIt is well-known that most crisis-affected Asian countries do not have well-developed financial\nand capital markets. The banking sector in most of these countries is highly regulated and the\nnonbanking sector, such as stock markets or venture capital markets, either did not exist or were\npoorly developed (Stiglitz 2000, Stiglitz and Uy 1996). Despite this, these economies were successful\nin financing rapid growth and diversification of their industrial and corporate sectors during\nthe three decades prior to the crisis by relying almost exclusively either on self-generated funds\nor borrowing from commercial banks with which they have developed special relationships over\nthe years. Malaysia and Singapore also benefited from strong foreign direct investment flows.\nIn the context of the underdeveloped nature of the financial sector, the close relationships between\nthe firms and the banks, mediated by the government, effectively addressed market failure issues.\nThe result was not only lower costs credit (Kumar and Debroy 1999) to firms but also socializing\nthe implicit cost of risks rather than firms or banks bearing these. Thus, government intervention\nthat implicitly encouraged banks to take a longer-term view of the firms\u2019 prospects assumed the\nrole of a de facto venture capital provider thereby providing both access to capital and ensuring\nthe stability of the financial sector.\nHowever, despite the success of this model, government intervention in the financial and\ncapital market also created problems of moral hazard and adverse selection (Alm and Buckley\n1998). As a result, the region\u2019s government has been under increasing pressure for some time\nwell before the crisis to adopt more hands-off and nondiscriminatory policies toward the corporate\nsector. The crisis, which saw the near collapse of many banks, reinforced the need to implement\nstructural change toward a more \u201cwestern\u201d approach to financing business development. As a\nresult, in the postcrisis period, firms in crisis-affected countries experienced not only a shortage\nof capital, but also the reluctance of banks to lend capital without government support to business.\nExperience from western countries suggests that unimpeded access to a well-developed\nfinancial sector consisting of both banking and nonbanking institutions is generally conducive\nto growth. For example, the growth of venture capital markets has been cited as a particularly\neffective mechanism for encouraging the start-up of new technology-intensive firms in the US.\nWell-organized venture capital markets are generally absent in Asia. The role of government\nagencies like development banks, specialized sector-specific financing companies, and large\n18", "Section III\nSources of Competitiveness\ncorporations in financing the start-up of SMEs have also been cited as important sources of capital,\nparticularly in the context of SMEs operating in environments characterized by market failure.\nStock markets are also emerging as significant mechanisms for firms to mobilize financial resources\nneeded for expansion and diversification. In most developing Asian economies, stock markets\nare relatively underdeveloped and have only recently benefited from active policy support. But\nstock markets are by their very nature more suited for mobilization of resources by large and\nwell-established firms. Small firms find it either too costly or cumbersome to raise the relatively\nsmaller amounts of resources needed by them through the stock markets. Changes in regulation\nand information disclosure policies could make these stock markets a more friendly mechanism\nfor SMEs without compromising on investors\u2019 security. Operational efficiency of stock markets\nand making them more friendly to SMEs and exporting firms could contribute to making them\ninternationally competitive.\nP17: Increased access to a well-developed and stable financial sector comprising\nbanks and specialized financial institutions (such as long-term credit and\ndevelopment banks, venture capital and stock markets) contributes positively to their\noverall competitiveness.\n1. Financial Sector Stability\nA sound financial sector that ensures that capital is allocated efficiently to enterprises\nis a key determinant of firm competitiveness. Although some Asian countries have attempted\nto liberalize and deregulate their financial sectors since the early 1990s, their banking sectors\nare still weak and fragile (ADB 1998). This fragility is an important impediment to the\ncompetitiveness of firms because banks constitute a major source of financing to business in the\nabsence of well-developed aternatives. Moreover, the banking sector in many Asian countries is\nheavily concentrated and dominated by a few local banks. It has been argued that restrictions\non the number of banks are important to ensure economies of scale and to avoid unnecessary\ncompetition that may be harmful to consumers. However, the counterargument is that by restricting\nentry (of foreign banks), the banking sector is highly oligopolistic and behaves in ways that are\nnot necessarily in the best interest of businesses, particularly SMEs. A lack of competition generally\ndenies businesses access to capital at internationally competitive rates. Hence, the perception\nis that there is an urgent need for structural institutional reform that improves prudential\nregulation, competition, supervision, and the overall governance of banks in order to enhance\nthe overall efficiency and stability of this sector.\nP18: Increased competition among banks together with strict prudential regulation\nensures a stable banking system and contributes positively toward the\ncompetitiveness of firms.\n19", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nIV.       Generalization of the Model and Data\nFrom the discussion above, we specify the following econometric model to explain the\ncompetitiveness of firms:\nCOMPi = \u0192 ( TECi, HRi, ORGi, GOVi, CAPi)  (1)\nWhere COMP is a measure of competitiveness of the ith firm and TEC, HR, ORG, GOV,\nand CAP refer to the five determinants (technology, human resource, organizational structure,\ngovernment role, and capital market). The dependent variable COMP can be measured by either\ngrowth in firm market share or by growth in export profits and or earnings. Similarly, all\nexplanatory variables can be measured at the firm level. Thus, equation (1) can be expanded\nand estimated using firm level data to test propositions 1-18 above.\nMost difficulties in researching international competitiveness at the enterprise level stem\nfrom difficulties in developing satisfactory data. Most investigations of international\ncompetitiveness so far have focused at either the country level or the industry level in advanced\ndeveloped nations. This is because country and sector-level data are more readily available,\nparticularly in these countries. Firm-level data is not readily available and primary data are\noften costly and time-consuming to assemble as it involves methods such as interviews and mail\nsurveys. For this reason, scholars often find it difficult to assemble comparable cross-country and\ncross-sector data. Even where resources are available, the concepts under investigation are often\ndifficult to measure through mail surveys. For example, concepts like innovation and trust are\ndifficult to conceptualize and measure.\nThe project RETA 5875: International Competitiveness of Asian Economies: A Cross\nCountry Study involves investigating the competitiveness of firms in three industrial sectors\n(textile, automotive, and electronics) in eight Asian countries (PRC; India; Indonesia; Korea;\nPhilippines;  Singapore; Taipei,China; and Thailand). In order to ensure high-quality data for\nanalysis, mail surveys and face to face interviews will be used. It is envisaged that analysis of\ncross-section data from different sectors and countries will provide rich insights into regional\ncompetitive nature of firms both within and among sectors and countries.\nThe model developed in this paper is limited to the exploration of competitiveness of export-\noriented manufacturing enterprises from less developed countries of Asia. This simplification\nwas necessary to identify salient issues facing firms in Asia, namely their developmental stage,\nthe state of technological sophistication, and the macro environment within which they operate.\nIt is well-known, for instance, that Asian governments have traditionally played a crucial\ncoordination role in business and industrial development, and that the stock and venture capital\nmarkets in this region are generally underdeveloped. In addition, firms tend to be smaller by\nwestern standards and do not have access to adequate capital. The workforce is generally less\nskilled while firms have traditionally been hierarchical in structure. Given these characteristics,\nit is important to depart from traditional approaches in economics and management literature\n20", "Section V\nConclusion\nin building a model that explains the international competitiveness of firms under consideration.\nThe model developed in this paper should be applicable in other countries and regions (e.g., in\nSouth America) that fit the description above. Furthermore, the focus on SMEs also adds to the\nliterature in deepening our understanding of the international activities of these firms.\nV.       Conclusion\nThe main objective of this paper was to identify the main determinants of competitiveness\nof Asian firms in order to construct a comprehensive analytical framework to empirically assess\nthe extent to which different factors contribute to firm competitiveness. The project RETA 5875:\nInternational Competitiveness of Asian Economies: A Cross Country Study will present the findings\nfrom eight Asian countries (PRC; India; Indonesia; Korea; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China;\nand Thailand). The paper departs from the notion that the globalization of markets and products\ntogether with the liberalization of domestic markets have created both opportunities and threats\nto enterprises in Asia. On one hand, competitive pressure in international markets continues\nto increase while on the other hand, foreign firms are increasingly challenging the once protected\ndomestic markets of firms. Not only is the environment within which firms operate volatile but\nthe pace of change is also accelerating with rapid advances in technology, particularly in ICT.\nICT can facilitate innovation but can also erode it by making information and its flows cheaper,\neasier, and faster.\nIn this highly competitive and fast changing environment, only firms that are efficient,\nflexible, innovative, and responsive to changes can survive. The paper identifies several key internal\nand external factors that impact on the ability of enterprises to compete sucessfully in international\nmarkets. These include the role of human resource development, the organizational structure,\nas well as the technological capability of firms. We argue that generally the pursuit of dynamic\nupgrading that allows firms to maintain their competitiveness may be captured by the notion\nof learning. We suggest the need to pay more attention to certain qualitative aspects of firm\nactivities such as relations with outside agents and institutional settings in which they operate.\nThus, besides the micro determinants of competitiveness, we also put forward the importance\nof the role of the government in stimulating markets and in building a strong national system\nof innovation. The role of the government in promoting competitiveness, in particular, is emphasized\nbecause of the general misconception of the role of government in Asian countries. We take the\nview that the role of the government in Asian economies is path-dependent. This is particularly\nrelevant when considering the effects of the Asian financial crisis on the competitiveness of firms.\nA wide collection of empirical studies on East Asian economic development informs us\nof diverse developmental paths. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, we observe a general\ntrend among Asian countries to undertake western style reforms including market liberalization\nand institutional reforms similar to those under way in western industrialized countries. Although\nthe extent and pace of such reforms differ among Asian countries, several important questions\n21", "ERD Working Paper No. 4\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF ASIAN FIRMS: AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\narise with respect to these reforms. Are they generally appropriate and do they enhance the\ncompetitiveness of firms, taking into account the context within which Asian firms traditionally\noperate and compete?  The proposed framework has the potential to produce important findings\nthat can be valuable in the development of policies aimed at restoring the international\ncompetitiveness of enterprises in postcrisis Asian economies.\nReferences\nAbetti, P.
