What must policy makers do to provide \nan  ever-growing  population  with  the  access  it  needs  while  ensuring  a  healthy  and  attractive  urban  environment? \nIncreasingly,  stakeholders  have  looked  to  transport  measures  as  a  means  to  relieve  traffic  congestion,  pollution, \naccidents,  and  greenhouse  gases  and  to  improve  residents\u2019  quality  of  life.  But  even  after  vast  investments,  living \nconditions in most developing cities continue to deteriorate.\n\nMany of the reasons for this phenomenon can be traced to past transport measures. Developing cities expand rapidly, \nwith today\u2019s fringe becoming tomorrow\u2019s developed city and the day-after-tomorrow\u2019s core city. But too often, policy \nmakers have focused on here-and-now problems and done little to guide the future city. The result has been much \ninfrastructure in the city center and little development at the periphery, with projects designed to increase mobility \nrather than to foster accessibility. More quickly than anticipated, this has translated into urban sprawl, more pollution, \nlarge under-serviced areas, and inferior living conditions for poorer residents in the city.\n\nAs difficult as today\u2019s conditions may seem, however, tomorrow\u2019s challenges will be greater still. Asia\u2019s cities are expected \nto grow by over 40 million per annum in coming years; at the same time, car ownership in many cities is doubling every \n3 to 7 years and urban poverty is on the rise. The consequences for equity, political stability, and residents\u2019 quality of \nlife are threatening. The time has come to change course towards a very different and more promising direction\u2014the \ntime has come to adopt a new paradigm for sustainable urban transport.\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\n\n\fA CRISIS IN URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nTo create a paradigm for the future, we must first confront the mistakes of the past. In 2007\u2013\n2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted an in-depth study of five Asian cities: \nDhaka, Bangladesh; Changzhou and Harbin in the People\u2019s Republic of China; Kathmandu, \nNepal; and Colombo, Sri Lanka. These cities were selected as a representative sample of \ncities in the region. ADB\u2019s analysis revealed that insofar as transport was concerned, most \npolicies  were  unsustainable,  few  were  implemented  (usually  only  main  roads  within  the \ncity), and when implementation did occur, outcomes were hardly ever evaluated.\n\nIneffective  transport  planning.  Transport  planning \nwas  considered  a  task  for  the  experts.  The  black  box \nmodel disenfranchised stakeholders who had little buy-\nin and who were skeptical that new policies would be \neffective or relevant. Plans failed to prioritize subprojects \nand  were  not  resilient  enough  to  adapt  to  unforeseen \ncircumstances.\n\nADB\u2019s five-city study identified the major problems: \n\nAbsence of a city development strategy. Too often \ntransport  planning  took  place  in  a  vacuum.  Municipal \nplanners  had  not  developed  a  city  vision  or  a  spatial \nstrategy  to  establish  the  direction  in  which  the  city \nshould expand and it was unclear what transport action \nwas meant to deliver.\n\nUnsustainable  transport  policies.  All  five  cities\u2019 \ntransport  policies  had  been  developed  as  transport \nmodel black boxes, with specialists, heavily represented \nby engineers, seeking to solve the mathematical problem \nof  increasing  the  volume  of  vehicles  rather  than  the \nsocial problem of ensuring that end users could access \nservices.  Indeed,  while  much  data  had  been  collected \non vehicle flows, little was known about the movement \nof  people.  As  a  result,  transport  policies  catered  to \nincreases in traffic with large infrastructure projects that \ncaused traffic to grow even more. In addition, all policies \nwere  developed  under  highly  optimistic  assumptions \nabout  the  cities\u2019  futures  (their  economic  growth,  their \naffordability,  and  their  vehicle  increases).  Rather  than \nstress-testing  various  projects  and  strategies,  the  cities \nassumed  a  single  deterministic  future  scenario.  Dhaka \nalone attempted to consider risk. \n\nPoor sidewalks force people to walk on the road\n\nLittle  implementation.  All  plans  were  characterized \nby a disconnect between what was planned, what was \nbudgeted,  and  what  was  implemented.  Planning  had \nlittle impact, and where implementation did occur, it did \nnot affect core priorities.\n\nLittle  assessment.  In  cases  where  plans  were \nimplemented,  little  was  known  about  the  extent  to \n\n\u0018\n\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fTraffic chaos reduces efficiency and results in pedestrian\u2013vehicle conflict\n\nwhich they were successful. While some risk analysis and \nmanagement and performance assessments took place, \nplanners simply did not assess the degree to which the \nimplementation of policies resulted in the achievement \nof policy goals.\n\nfor \n\nGovernance  problems.  Too  often,  technical  studies \nwere  used  to  justify  political  decisions,  not  to  provide \nsound  advice.  As  a  result,  policies  reflected  political \ninterests  rather  than  users\u2019  interests.  In  addition, \nresponsibilities \ntransport  policy \nwere  fragmented  among  diverse  city  entities.  Only \nChangzhou had strong, empowered institutions. In the \nother  four  cities,  poorly  defined  responsibilities  at  the \ncentral government and city levels created an ambiguous \nframework  that  left  decision-making  bodies  unable  to \ndeliver on their promises.\n\nimplementing \n\nThese  observations  make  it  clear  that  these  and  other \nAsian cities face a crisis of policy, planning effectiveness, \nbudgeting,  implementation  and  governance  insofar  as \nurban transport is concerned. Focused on meeting ever-\ngrowing  demand,  many  transport  programs  failed  to \n\nattenuate  and  sometimes  even  exacerbated  problems \nof pollution, urban sprawl, poverty, and a deteriorating \nquality of life. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  cities  are  becoming  more,  not  less, \nchallenging to manage. Today\u2019s future is defined by the \nincreasing  pace  of  change,  growing  uncertainty  and \nrisk,  more  and  more  demanding  stakeholders,  and  an \never  more  urgent  policy  agenda.  Just  7  years  ago,  for \nexample, energy security, climate change, and terrorism \nwere of low priority. These issues now require extensive \nattention but are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast. \nMeanwhile, former issues have not gone away\u2014far from \nit:  poverty  alleviation  remains  ADB\u2019s  overarching  goal. \nThe core problem facing the sector is therefore that of \nmanaging  dynamic  complexity.  There  is  the  ever-\npresent danger that planners focus on the latest urgent \nproblem without adopting a balanced strategy to keep \non course. Climate change is an example: few question \nits importance, but it would be imprudent to implement \nclimate  change  mitigation  policies  without  thinking \nthrough their wider implications for urban transport and \ndevelopment.\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\n\n\fA NEW PARADIGM\n\nADB\u2019s  new  paradigm  for  sustainable  urban  transport  (SUT)  offers  the  prospect  of  much \nmore effective management of the region\u2019s cities over coming years. As formidable as the \nchallenges are, commitment and resources can empower stakeholders to make changes \nand  accomplish  what  everyone  is  clamoring  for:  place  our  cities  on  a  more  sustainable \ntrajectory. \n\nReclaiming the urban environment in Cheonggyecheon, Republic of Korea\n\nADB\u2019s SUT paradigm has five core elements:\n\n\u2022  Transport policy is defined by what works. No longer \nis  policy  the  preserve  of  the  technical  specialist: \nstakeholders\u2014including  end  users\u2014participate  in \nthe policy-making process to ensure that plans and \nprojects reflect actual needs.\n\nadaptable,  and \nimplementable.  Furthermore, \npolicy  makers  recognize  that  soft  measures  such \nas  public  transport  advertising,  internet  shopping, \ntelecommuting  and  teleconferencing,  and  better \ninformation are effective ways to influence behavior.\n\n\u2022  Land use planning is part of the solution. The erstwhile \nlink between land use and transport planning is re-\ncreated to facilitate the provision of public transport \nand reduce the need for travel.\n\n\u2022  Transport demand is managed to supply and projects \nare centered on traffic restraint and the greater use \nof public transport. No longer is road traffic capacity \nautomatically  expanded  in  response  to  demand \nforecasts. \n\n\u2022  Transport  plans  and  projects  reflect  a  wider  city \nvision  or  spatial  strategy.  They  are  also  affordable, \n\n\u2022  Policy  effectiveness  is  demonstrated  to  a  skeptical \n\nstakeholder community.\n\nTaken  together,  these  elements  comprise  a  fundamental \nchange  of  direction.  ADB\u2019s  new  paradigm  moves  from \ntechnical, opaque policy-making to participatory, evidence-\nbased  policy-making  in  which  the  transport  planning \nprofession collaborates with other stakeholders to develop \npolicies  that  balance  the  needs  of  all  sectors  of  society. \nInstead  of  reacting  to  inevitable  phenomena,  the  new \napproach is proactive and maintains constant focus on the \noverall purpose of transport planning: the development of \nsustainable and socially inclusive cities.\n\n\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\f\u201cA realistic and relatively low cost urban structure/transport strategy for newly motorizing \nAsian cities is to accept high urban densities but to try to slow motorization and aim to \nenhance non-automobile alternatives in order to prevent unacceptable local pollution \nand congestion. This strategy also helps ameliorate rapidly rising GHG (greenhouse gas) \nemissions.\u201d \n\nDr. Paul A.

Barcelona, Bogot\u00e1, Curitiba, Dublin, \nHong Kong, London, Munich, Seoul, Singapore, Stuttgart, Vancouver, Zurich\u2014cities around \nthe  world  have  developed  sustainably  in  crucial  respects.  None  did  so  by  accident,  but \nby  purposeful  action  maintained  over  time.  ADB\u2019s  analysis  found  that  all  success  stories \naddressed  three  issues:  management  (how  to  manage  the  transport  sector),  financing \n(how to fund transport projects), and policy (what projects and programs to implement). \nAlthough no single best practice turned these cities around, the experiences analyzed here \nsuggest that cities develop more sustainably when they meet the following conditions:\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nCity  leaders  must  have  the  capacity  to  address \nthe dangers that face their city. They must be able \nto marshal the political power necessary to provide \nthe  conditions  for  improvement  and  they  must \nrecognize that future development is largely in their \nhands.\n\nStakeholders  must  understand  enough  of  the \nfundamentals  of  sustainable  land  use/transport \npolicy  to  share  a  strategic  vision  of  the  role  of \ntransport. The aim is accountable management and \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\na virtuous circle of politics without politicking (often \ndemocratic control). A technocratic approach must \nbe the constant theme.\n\nCity leaders must be willing and strong enough to \nmake difficult but necessary decisions. \n\nThe  political  institutions  that  decide  on  transport \nprojects  must  have  the  authority  to  drive  those \ndecisions through. \n\nPromoting non-motorized transport and infrastructure\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\n\u0018\n\n\fBus rapid transit relieves congestion in Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\n\u2022 \n\nFinancial  realism  must  be  widespread  and \nstakeholders  must  recognize  that  improvements \nare not cheap. Citizens need to recognize that they \nmust pay more transport costs and city governments \nmust  find  ways  to  increase  municipal  income.  In \naddition,  authorities  must  demonstrate  that  funds \nare well spent.\n\n\u2022 \n\nCities  must  apply  strategic  risk  management \nprocesses  in  order  to  develop  cities  and  transport \nsystems proactively.\n\n\u2022 \n\nBecause  megaprojects  are  particularly  risky,  great \ncare must be taken in committing to and developing \nmegaprojects. City authorities must also ensure that \nthe allure of free central government financing does \nnot distort their strategic imperatives. \n\nIn  seeking  to  meet  these  conditions,  it  is  important \nthat  developing  cities  adopt  an  incremental  approach. \nJust as SUT demands pragmatism, so success requires a \nreasonable, location-specific action and implementation \nplan that recognizes that progress may be iterative rather \nthan linear, with challenges and pitfalls along the way.\n\n\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fELEMENTS Of A SUSTAINABLE URBAN \nTRANSPORT MODEL: MANAGEMENT\n\nADB\u2019s new paradigm for SUT has three components: management, financing, and policy. These \ncomponents interact with each other: management (what to do) depends upon financing (what \ncan be afforded), and both depend upon the capacity to determine the right strategy, implement \nthat strategy, and monitor performance (policy).\n\nInstitutions and Governance\n\nInsofar as management is concerned, the core theme of \nADB\u2019s  approach  is  the  creation  of  a  city  authority  with \nsubstantial  self-financing  powers  and  responsibility  for \nstrategic land use planning, transport, and environmental \nprotection in its commuter catchment area. Increasingly, \ntransport solutions require a package of measures to be \neffective. London\u2019s recent experience confirms that when \na  range  of  powers  is  vested  in  a  single  organization, \nmeasures  can  be  implemented  concurrently  and  major \nimprovements become possible. \n\nThe  organization  of  a  city  authority  as  depicted  in \nthis figure evolves slowly as the authority demonstrates \nresponsibility  and  trust  begins  to  grow.  Central \ngovernment, local government units, and, in some cases, \nmajor developers continue to play a role. Indeed, effective \n\nTransport \nStrategy and \nPrimary Transport \nNetwork\n\nCity \nDevelopment\nStrategy\n\nStrategic Land \nUse Plan\n\nEnvironmental \nProtection Plan\n\ndevelopment requires that all levels of governance have \nthe power to act and that they do in fact act together \nacross the catchment area. \n\nROLES Of DIffERENT LEVELS Of GOVERNMENT IN SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nPlanning level\n\nInstitution\n\nPolicy\n\nCentral government\n\nRole\n\nCreates an enabling environment based on accountability, \nparticipation, predictability, and transparency; confines its \nguidance to important issues; policies only change periodically\n\nDevotes considerable resources to identifying priorities, creating \na vision and developing a structured process for the entire \nurban area; guides public and private sector decision-making \nand provides the basis for sectoral planning \n\nStrategic planning\n\nCity authority\n\nDistrict/local planning\n\nLocal government unit \n(LGU)\n\nConsiders both land use and transport needs; sets minimum \nstandards that it has the means to enforce\n\nSite-specific planning\n\nLGU/developers\n\nIntegrates SUT planning into large developments and \nnegotiates with communities\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\n\n\fThe starting point to creating or reinforcing a city authority \nis a diagnostic study that looks at how the city\u2019s transport \nsector is organized and how efficient and capable are the \nagencies  involved\u2014what  they  achieve,  what  financial \nresources  they  have  at  their  disposal  and  what  principal \nissues  they  face.  The  purpose  of  the  diagnostic  study  is \nto  develop  a  realizable  vision  of  the  city  of  the  future. \n \nTranslating  that  vision  into  action  requires  commitment, \n\npolitical  will  and  pragmatic  leadership  in  a  turbulent \nenvironment.  In  their  response  to  these  challenges, \nsustainable  cities  have  shown  themselves  able  to  take \nadvantage  of  windows  of  opportunity  to  make  rapid, \npurposeful  progress.  To  prepare  for  these  occasions, \ncapacity-building is necessary. This is where partnerships \nbetween cities and international financial institutions can \nbe especially useful.\n\nA NEW SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT MODEL\nNew model\n\nOld model\n\nCharacteristic\n\nDecision-making powers Weak powers distributed across LGUs; \n\nthe central government dominates\n\nDecentralized powers\n\nStrong central government; weak or \nno city authority; weak LGUs with little \nfinancing\n\nLittle integration and competing interests\n\nIntegrated land use/ \ntransport/ \nenvironmental strategies\n\nEnabling environment\n\nGovernance\n\nOften weak; political benefits take \nprecedence over benefits to end users; \nineffective private sector participation\n\nImplementation processes are in use and \neffective measures exist to attract private \nsector participation\n\nClosed processes with little stakeholder \ninfluence; an unpredictable environment \nthat may be suborned by inappropriate \ninfluences\n\nStrong city authority with powers over the \ncommuter catchment area; as cities grow, \nthe boundaries of this area may have to be \nexpanded\n\nStrong city authority sets strategy and \ncoordinates with central government and \nLGUs; both the city authority and the LGUs \nhave financing powers\n\nCity authority has powers over multimodal \ntransport, land use, and environment \nprotection; debate of pros and cons a \nprerequisite to adoption of a strategy\n\nAn open, participatory, and accountable \napproach and a predictable environment \nunder the rule of law; competition \nand private\u2013public partnerships are \nencouraged; where beneficial, foreign \ndirect investment is attracted\n\nStrategic transport authority provides policy \nleadership and coordination; responsible \nagencies implement policies; separation of \npolicy, procurement, regulation, and the \ndelivery of services\n\nInstitutional structure\n\nNo strategic transport authority; \nduplication/omission/complex allocation of \nresponsibilities among agencies\n\nRole of international \nfinancial institutions\n\nPromote SUT policies without the necessary \nsupport/resources; technical assistance (TA) \nprojects often ineffective; many loans are for \nmajor projects; implementation delays and \ncost overruns are common\n\nLong-term partnerships with cities \ncommitted to implementing SUT policies; \nTAs provide necessary support; loans are \nfor strategic priorities; results are widely \ndisseminated\n\n\u00180\n\u00180\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fImplementation Processes\n\nMuch  of  the  gulf  between  transport  plans  and \neffective implementation can be explained by a lack of \nadequate  implementation  processes.  These  processes \nare  indispensable  features  of  sustainable  cities  and  do \nnot require more effort but rather more effective effort. \nConsiderable  planning  and  engineering  resources  are \nroutinely  deployed  in  most  developing  cities.  These \nresources need to be directed more effectively.\n\nOne  aspect  of  implementation  processes  concerns  the \nincreasing uncertainty of the future. Too often, the public \nsector in developing cities is reactive, buffeted by events, \nand struggling to keep on course. With the magnitude and \ncomplexity of risk growing by the year, it is essential that \nplayers manage how they conceptualize risk. The goal is \nfor cities and transport sector to be managed proactively. \n\nRisk  management  offers  planners  the  opportunity  to \nmove  rapidly  from  reactive  to  proactive  management, \neliminating  surprises,  identifying  emerging  trends,  and \nproviding  a  basis  for  sound  corporate  governance  and \ncontrol. \n\nThe content of transport strategy also needs to change. \nMuch  more  adaptability  can  be  built  into  transport \nprojects  than  is  current  practice.  It  is  also  possible  to \ncreate  more  resilient  plans  for  critical  infrastructure \nand  to  design  projects  that  are  fit  for  purpose  in  an \nunpredictable future. \n\nTogether with champions and institutional capacity, the \nfollowing  four  implementation  processes  are  central  to \nSUT: \n\nProcess 1: An integrated urban transport \nplanning system\n\nProcess 2: A thorough urban transport \nplanning cycle\n\nNational and city development goals are integrated and \ntransport planning is multimodal.

Objectives cover business development, housing, air \n\nquality, parking, and other aspects of civic life. Quantified performance indicators are identified for monitoring \n\npurposes and the results are made public to allow comparison between authorities. This creates pressure for \n\nimproved performance. The City of London goes to great lengths to market its performance as a way of attracting \n\nforeign investment and helping to ensure future prosperity.\n\nis vital to better policy and broad acceptance. Yet too \noften  cities  conduct  monitoring  merely  to  satisfy  the \nrequirements of international financial institutions. To \nimplement  transport  policies  effectively,  cities  must \ncommit  to  performance  monitoring  and  take  care \nto  select  indicators  that  can  be  measured  using  the \nresources available.\n\nCongestion charging in London\n\nProcess 3: A major project development \nprocedure\n\nMegaprojects such as metros, expressways, and airports \nare popular but have high opportunity costs and often \nfail to deliver the benefits expected. A successful major \nproject  development  procedure  eschews  premature \npolitical and financing commitments, allows decisions to \nbe made incrementally so as to ensure the relevance and \neffectiveness  of  the  project  as  it  becomes  operational, \noperates  in  an  enabling  environment  that  incentivizes \ncity  authorities  and  private  concessionaires  to  work  in \nthe  public  interest,  ensures  continuity  from  conception \nto use by focusing on key decisions and on operations, \nand is influenced by operator involvement at all stages \nto  keep  the  project  centered  on  operations  (its  core \npurpose).\n\nProcess 4: A transport asset and \nperformance management process\n\nThe transport system comprises valuable assets (roads, \nequipment,  etc.)  that  need  regular  maintenance, \nupgrading,  or  replacement.  Most  developing  cities \nusually ignore this task as politicians and city authorities \nprefer  to  work  on  new  projects  rather  than  on \nmundane management. An effective transport assets \nprocess  measures  and  monitors  asset  condition  and \nperformance, transport demand, and user satisfaction. \nIt also communicates results to stakeholders. In some \ninstances,  the  private  sector  operates  maintenance \nand operating concessions. This has the added benefit \nof  familiarizing  the  government  with  performance-\nbased contracting. As for performance, it is clear that \nunderstanding implementation successes and problems \n\n\u0018\u0018\n\u0018\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fPromoting more energy efficient transport\n\nELEMENTS Of A SUSTAINABLE URBAN \nTRANSPORT MODEL: fINANCING\n\nAffordability and Priorities\n\nWithout an institutional context that allows priorities to \nbe ranked against available financing, transport strategies \nhave  little  merit.  Manila,  the  Philippines,  adopted  an \ninnovative approach to address this issue. In 1982, Manila \ncreated an investment strategy for all municipal sectors: \nhighways,  public  transport,  water  supply,  sewerage \nand  sanitation,  garbage  disposal,  housing,  social \ninfrastructure,  and  others.  Based  on  past  expenditures \nand future prospects, it identified a set of projects that \ncould definitely be financed and a second set of projects \nthat  could  be  implemented  if  additional  funds  became \navailable. It used a transparent, comprehensible system \nto  separate  unambiguously  good  from  unambiguously \nbad projects and to classify the remaining projects using \n\nobjective  criteria  and  different  weights  for  different \nscenarios. It did not seek precision or attempt to dictate \noutputs in detail. The strategy established the robustness \nof each project under a range of scenarios and provided \na  basis  for  dialogue  with  government  agencies  that \nquestioned the rankings. Considerable progress was the \nresult.\u0018\n\nPrivate\u2013Public Partnerships (PPPs)\n\nA wide range of PPP modalities can deliver better projects \nat a lower (or zero) level of public support, provide new \nsources of funds, improve capacity and levels of service, \nand  ameliorate  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \n\n2  Allport, Roger J. and N. von Einsiedel.  1986.

Despite these advantages, Asia\u2019s PPP \nexperiences  have  been  much  narrower  than  elsewhere \nand have revolved around new-build megaprojects such \nas metros and expressways. To determine whether PPPs \nare  the  right  approach,  it  is  important  that  planners \nunderstand the main project risks, only use private finance \nto  transfer  risks,  expect  the  scale  of  private  finance  to \nmatch  the  risks  transferred,  and  require  private  sector \nprocurement  to  provide  better  value  than  the  public \nsector alternative.\n\nInnovative financing\n\nInnovate  financing  approaches  and  innovative  sources \nof  funding  can  be  valuable  complements  to  a  sound \nfinancing  strategy.  One  innovative  approach  consists \nof  creating  an  urban  transport  fund  that  generates \nsustainable  funding  for  transport  projects.  Another \napproach  consists  of  creating incentives and deterrents \nthat  work  together  to  promote  SUT.  With  the  United \nKingdom\u2019s Transport Innovation Fund, for example, cities \n\n\u0018\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fthat commit to a strategy to tackle congestion compete \nfor  central  government  funds  for  modal  integration \nand  improvements  to  their  public  and  non-motorized \ntransport  systems.  For  political  reasons,  governments \noffer  most  incentives  before  implementing  deterrents \nsuch  as  congestion  charging,  fuel  tax  supplements, \nvehicle registration, and/or parking fees. This ensures that \ntravelers who wish to adopt more sustainable transport \nchoices are not without alternatives. \n\nInnovative  sources  of  funding  usually  target  the \nwindfall beneficiaries of transport policies and projects. \nExamples  include  France\u2019s  employers\u2019  taxes  (versement \nde  transport),  the  revenues  of  which  are  invested  in \nnew projects; joint development projects, as in the case \nof  Hong  Kong\u2019s  MTR  Corporation;  and  tax-increment \nfinancing,  whereby  governments  earmark  a  portion  of \nthe increase in property or sales tax revenues that result \nfrom improvements to repay the costs of implementing \nthe  improvements.  Certain  climate  funds  are  poised \nto  become  another  innovative  source  of  funding  for \ntransport. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nTechnical  and  financial  planning  must  proceed \njointly  and  concurrently  to  avoid  embarking  upon \nprojects that turn out to be unaffordable.\n\nResponsibility  is  reinforced  when  city  authorities \nhave  a  major  stake  (are  at  risk)  in  major  projects. \nThis  avoids  cities  competing  for  \u201cfree\u201d  central \ngovernment  funds  that  may  distort  their  city \ndevelopment  strategy  and  undermine  good \ngovernance.\n\nCity  authorities  should  determine  the  major \nspending priorities in their cities and create flexible \nfunding  mechanisms.  Earmarking  financing  for \nspecific  activities  or  projects  reduces  planners\u2019 \nflexibility to respond to changing circumstances. \n\n\u2022  Great  care  is  required  before  committing  to \nmegaprojects.  Megaprojects  can  throw  a  city \nstrategy off course if forecasts are not realized. \n\nIn terms of financing, ADB\u2019s SUT paradigm \nadheres to the following guidelines:\n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nSUT  policies  are  not  necessarily  low-cost  and \nimprovements do not come cheaply. Citizens must \npay  more  taxes  or  user  charges  or  find  innovative \nways of increasing city income. Complete financial \nrealism is essential. If more funds become available \n(e.g.,  tax  revenues  are  increased),  then  more \nimprovements can take place. \n\nTransport  decisions  should  be  made  by  a  city \nauthority  that  has  the  power  to  raise  substantial \nrevenues.  When  the  same  body  that  decides  on \nprojects  also  finances  those  projects,  accountable \ndecision-making results. Self-financing also imposes \nprudent financial management. \n\n\u2022  Obtaining  a  credit  rating  can  help  cities  borrow \non  attractive  terms.  Credit  ratings  also  reinforce \ndisciplined  financial  planning,  as  good  ratings  are \njealously guarded. \n\nSome  cities  depend  on  loans  from  international \nfinancial  institutions  in  order  to  develop  projects. \nTo  reinforce  the  development  impact  of  these \nloans, city authorities should ensure that the loans \nincentivize good governance. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIn  large  countries  with  many  cities,  central \ngovernments  should  consider  incentivizing  city \nauthorities to adopt and implement SUT policies as \nIndia did with its National Urban Transport Policy. \n\n\u2022  While  innovative  financing  may  have  a  role  in \ntransport projects, it is unrealistic to see innovative \nfunding  as  a  guarantee  for  sound  city  transport \nfinances.\n\n\u2022 \n\nPPPs have many merits but they often require large \npublic  funding  or  in-kind  support  and  have  major \nimpacts  on  a  city.  City  authorities  should  develop \nprojects  through  to  business  case  and  decide  the \nterms of procurement with care.\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\u0018\n\n\fELEMENTS Of A SUSTAINABLE URBAN \nTRANSPORT MODEL: POLICY\n\nBefore the advent of energy efficiency and climate change as policy concerns, sustainable \ncities defined SUT policies as access-based transport planning that focused on planning for \nproximity.  To  control  traffic  congestion,  cities  combined  the  \u201ccarrot\u201d  of  public  transport \nwith  the  \u201cstick\u201d  of  demand  management.  Wright  and  Fulton  (2005)\u0018  have  shown  that \nwhen steps are added to control vehicles and fuels, this approach meets the requirements \nof energy efficiency and climate change mitigation programs. \n\nThis section discusses \u201cAvoid, Shift, Improve\u201d and other \npolicy tools that promote SUT and development.\u0018 \n\nAVOID: Reducing the Need for Travel\n\nAccessibility requires mixed land uses in dense cities where \narteries are not blocked by congestion. Historically, many \nAsian cities have measured up well to this ideal, with a range \nof services and amenities located in each neighborhood. \nIn  more  recent  times,  however,  indiscriminate  land  use \nhas  forced  residents  to  make  greater  use  of  motorized \ntransport. The remedy is judicious land use planning that \nreduces residents\u2019 need to travel and cuts back on urban \nsprawl, pollution, and congestion.\n\nSHIfT: Changing Mode Choice\n\nBoth  the  \u201cstick\u201d  of  traffic  restraint  and  the  \u201ccarrot\u201d \nof  attractive  public  transport  are  necessary  to  reduce \ntransport-related  problems.  While  it  is  rarely  politically \nfeasible  to  control  car  ownership,  controlling  car  use \nmeets  with  less  resistance.  Developing  cities  should \nimplement  parking  policies,  congestion  charging,  car \npooling  and  other  measures.  Where  these  policies  are \nnot  possible,  cities  may  consider  fuel  surcharges  with \nvehicle license duties that reflect the vehicle\u2019s impact on \nair  pollution  and  other  externalities.  The  net  revenues \nfrom  these  measures  should  be  invested  in  improving \nthe  public  transport  system  to  secure  acceptance  for \nnecessary but unpopular policies. \n\n\u201cA gallon of fuel conserved, or a ton of air \nemissions avoided due to reduced vehicle travel \n[\u2026] is worth an order of magnitude more \nthan the same energy savings and emissions \nreductions provided by increased vehicle fuel \nefficiency or shifts to alternative fuels. This \noccurs because mileage reductions also reduce \ntraffic congestion, road and parking facility \ncosts, consumer costs, accidents\u2026 pollution, and \nsprawl, and often improve mobility options for \nnon-drivers.\u201d \n\nTodd Litman, transport expert\n\nIn  addition  to  these  \u201csticks,\u201d  two  \u201ccarrots\u201d  can  set \ncities  along  a  sustainable  path.  First  is  the  introduction \nof  competition  into  the  bidding  for  supply  of  public \ntransport services. This is necessary to develop efficient, \nmarket-facing  services.  Second  is  the  early  integration \nof  bus  priority  ways,  busways,  bus  rapid  transit,  light \nrapid transit and/or metro systems into cities\u2019 expansion \nand development plans. Today, bus rapid transit systems \n(physically  segregated  busways  in  the  center  of  the \nroadway,  with  fares  prepaid  at  fast  boarding/alighting \nroad-level  platforms)  are  riding  a  wave  of  enthusiasm. \nAt the same time, no city with a metro appears to regret \nhaving gone down that path.\u0018 A sound choice between \nthese and other options rests on realistic assessments\u2014\n\n3  Wright, L. and Fulton, L. 2005.

In  medium-\nsized and low-income cities, for example, busways may \nprovide  the  basis  of  the  mass  rapid  transit  system  for \nmany  years.  If  affordability  increases  or  environmental \nconcerns  become  critical,  then  light  rapid  transit  may \nplay an important role. In the largest corridors of major \ncities, metros may be required. Secondary corridors may \nthen justify busways, light rapid transit lines, or upgraded \nsuburban rail systems. \n\nAn  integral  part  of  influencing  mode  choice  is  road \nmanagement.  In  managing  existing  roads,  planners \nmust  balance  competing  demands  from  frontagers, \npedestrians, cyclists, buses, and other traffic. Too often, \nthis equates to maximizing motorized traffic capacity to \nthe detriment of non-motorized road users. Meanwhile, \nthe  nature  and  location  of  new  roads  are  central  to \ndetermining  the  city\u2019s  development:  radial  roads  create \nribbon  development  while  road  networks  help  develop \npreviously  inaccessible  areas.  Road  networks  should \ntherefore  be  developed  to  facilitate  the  movement \nof  people  and  goods,  not  private  cars.  Road  capacity \nimprovements  should  focus  on  developmental  roads \nand strategic/missing links. Not only can these measures \ninfluence  mode  choice  and  alleviate  congestion  and \npollution, they can also lessen poverty by ensuring that \ndwellers of peripheral areas, usually the poor, have better \naccess to services.\n\nIMPROVE: Increasing the Energy Efficiency \nof Vehicles and fuel\n\nThe energy efficiency and climate change agenda require \ncontrols  on  vehicles  and  fuels.  With  these  controls  in \nplace, transport policy packages can drastically mitigate \nthe  adverse  consequences  of  motorization  by  reducing \ndistances travelled and lowering carbon dioxide emissions \nand local air pollution (nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and \nparticulate matter).\n\nAchieving  these  objectives  requires  a  combination  of \ntechnology, measures to encourage the rapid take-up of \nthe  technology,  and  regulation  that  controls  emissions \nby  ensuring  that  vehicles  are  properly  maintained. \nMovements  in  this  direction  include  the  Global  Fuel \nEconomy  Initiative  (also  known  as  the  50  by  50 \nChallenge), a program to improve fuel economy by 50% \nworldwide by the year 2050; and the European Union\u2019s \n\nadoption of the Green Paper, which promotes the use of \nclean, energy-efficient technologies, and other measures. \nWhether  Asia  will  progress  on  the  paths  advocated  in \nthese initiatives depends on the region\u2019s openness to the \nlatest technology and the replacement rate of the vehicle \nfleet in response to standards and enforcement.\n\nImplementing Integrated Land \nDevelopment \n\nIn coming years, virtually all of Asia\u2019s population increase \nwill  occur  in  urban  areas.  Asia\u2019s  cities  are  expected  to \ngrow  by  over  40  million  per  annum  at  the  same  time \nthat urban densities fall as a result of increasing wealth, \ndeclining household size and central area redevelopment. \nThe  result  is  that  most  developing  cities  are  likely  to \nat least double in size over the next 20 or so years. All \nstrategies recently developed to address this issue involve \nincreasing the quantity and the quality of new land for \ndevelopment. \n\nOne  way  to  bring  more  and  better  land  under \ndevelopment  is  through  land  use  planning.  In  most \ndeveloped  country  cities,  land  use  planning  systems \nallied  to  the  expansion  of  primary  road,  rail  and  metro \nnetworks  enabled  urban  expansion  to  proceed  in  a \ncontrolled manner. This reduced adverse environmental \nimpacts,  supplied  adequate  land  for  residential  and \nother  uses,  and  resulted  in  an  acceptable  standard  of \nphysical and social infrastructure. Most developing cities\u2019 \nplanning  systems  are  modeled  on  those  of  developed \ncountries.  Yet  minimal  enforcement,  institutional  and \ntechnical  weaknesses  within  planning  departments, \ngreater  susceptibility  to  political  intervention,  and  the \nunwillingness of land owners to submit to controls have \nrendered  these  systems  largely  ineffectual.  Changing \nthese conditions would require a sea change in attitude. \nWith the exception of the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nperhaps Viet Nam, therefore, it seems unlikely that land \nuse planning will do much to increase the availability of \nnew land for development in the short or medium term.\n \nA  more  realistic  means  of  increasing  the  quantity  and \nquality of new land for development may consist of direct \ninterventions by city governments to influence the scale, \nlocation, and type of land development that takes place. \nGovernments can construct homes; obtain land through \nexpropriation,  negotiation,  or  compulsory  purchase; \n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\u0018\n\n\fCombating urban sprawl requires integrated policy measures\n\nguide  or  regulate  land  development;  and/or  conduct \nland  pooling/land  restructuring  whereby  land  for  roads \nis obtained from owners at minimal cost in exchange for \nthe gains that accrue once land values increase. Because \na  large  proportion  of  the  land  used  by  lower  income \ngroups is developed by informal and small landowners, \ngovernment  partnerships  with  these  constituents  is \nessential.  To  maximize  success,  governments  should \nformalize  their  agreements  with  developers  and  render \nthose agreements more transparent. \n\nA  third  and  very  efficient  tool  for  securing  more  land \nfor  development  is  the  transport  network.  Without \naccess, whether by foot, cart, truck, bus or car, there is \n\nno development. Yet city authorities rarely deploy their \nauthority  to  develop  roads  as  a  means  of  managing \nthe city\u2019s growth. The first step towards redressing this \nsituation  is  to  create  links  between  what  is  planned \nand what is implemented. This requires a strong spatial \nplanning  process  that \nincludes  transport  planning \nand  has  the  full  buy-in  of  all  stakeholders:  national \nand  city  governments,  public  works  departments, \nmajor  developers,  and  civil  society.  The  second  step \nis  to  develop  area  road  networks  (both  arterial  and \nsecondary  roads)  in  fringe  areas  where  development  is \ndesirable.  Design  and  construction  guidelines  in  these \nareas should be consistent with the needs and means of \nfuture  low-income  occupiers:  if  standards  are  too  high \n\n\u0018\u0018\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fand  procedures  too  cumbersome,  they  will  be  ignored. \nPublic  transport  services  should  also  be  provided  from \nthe outset. \n\nIn  summary,  cities  that  aspire  to  sustainability  need  a \nnew  approach  to  land  use  planning  and  development \n\nthat  makes  use  of  both  incentives  and  deterrents. \nThe  incentives  are  the  approval  and  legitimization  of \ndevelopments,  increased  land  values,  and  the  provision \nof road access and infrastructure.

In recent years, urban poverty has decreased in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nby over 50% and has fallen significantly in East Central Asia. In Southeast Asia, urban \npoverty declined by just over 10% but at 34%, the incidence remains high. Yet in South \nAsia it has increased by over 20% and there has been negligible change in its incidence. \nWith the possible exception of the People\u2019s Republic of China, therefore, urban poverty is \nlikely to remain a serious issue throughout Asia for the foreseeable future. To be effective, \nSUT policies must address urban poverty. Without poverty reduction, sustainable urban \ndevelopment is impossible. \n\n\u00180\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\fADB\u2019s research shows that the residents of low-income \nresidential  areas  on  the  urban  fringe  face  particular \ntransport-related  problems:  poor  access  to  and  within \ncommunities, \ninsufficient  or  unaffordable  public \ntransport, and great distances to employers and various \nfacilities. In contrast, problems are fewer when the poor \nlive in or near central areas where public transport is widely \navailable.  Central  areas  are,  however,  more  susceptible \nto  traffic  accidents  and  air  pollution,  especially  where \npedestrian  traffic  and  informal  street  trading  activities \nare high. \n\nTransport  policies  can  target  these  problems  in  two \nprincipal  ways.  First,  geographical  targeting  consists  of \ninterventions  to  improve  accessibility  for  the  residents \nof  under-served,  poor  and  low-income  settlements  on \nthe  urban  fringe.  These  interventions  consist  mainly  of \nimproved  road  access  to  and  within  these  settlements. \nThey  could  also  include  conditions  for  public  transit \noperators  to  provide  services  to  these  areas  and \nimprovements  to  social  and  physical  infrastructure \nthat reduce residents\u2019 need to travel. It is not generally \n\nnecessary  to  disaggregate  the  travel  needs  of  the  poor \nfrom those of other low-income groups, as the differences \nbetween them are not especially marked. In many cases, \ntransport policies can be targeted at low-income groups \nin general rather than at the poor in particular. \n\nThe  second  way  that  policies  can  address  problems \nspecific to the poor is by targeting poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds  or  individuals  for  better  access  to  public \ntransport.  Examples  are  fare  concessions  for  the  poor, \nstudents, the elderly, and the disabled; improved design \nof public transport vehicles to make them accessible to \nthe disabled; and reserved seating areas for women. In \ngeneral, however, these types of measures are unfeasible \nor of low priority in the presence of limited financial or \ninstitutional capacity or little centralized regulation of bus \nservices. Furthermore, unless applied in such a way that \noperators are fully compensated for the loss of fares, they \ncan also have the perverse impact of reducing the supply \nand  quality  of  public  transport  by  lessening  operators\u2019 \nrevenues and their willingness to invest. \n\nPeople-centered transport systems\n\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n\n\u0018\u0018\n\u0018\u0018\n\u0018\u0018\n\n\fRestoring neighborhoods through pedestrian-friendly environment\n\nEven  when  not  targeted  at  the  poor,  however,  SUT \npolicies  can  benefit  low-income  residents.

Indirect \npositive  impacts  also  occur  where  improved  transport \nsystems contribute to economic growth and help create \nmore  flexible  and  larger  labor  markets.  But  transport \ninterventions  can  also  have  unintended  consequences. \nBetter  enforcement  of  emission  controls,  for  instance, \ncan make some forms of public transport less affordable. \nRoad or rail construction can cause residents to lose their \nland or their livelihood. Even regulating paratransit modes \n(e.g., rickshaws) or banning vendors from sidewalks can \nimpoverish the most vulnerable. Identifying these impacts \nin the project design phase, creating mitigation measures, \n\nand  formulating  compensation  packages  are  integral \nparts of SUT policy.

Population growth and decreasing \ndensities have led many cities to expand, and the ownership and use of private cars has vastly outstripped expectations. \nAlthough traffic congestion has long been identified as a problem, it continues to worsen in almost all of the region\u2019s \nurban areas. Citizens are becoming increasingly aware of local air pollution and are experiencing a range of associated \nhealth problems. Asia\u2019s accident rates are among the world\u2019s highest and policy makers worry about greenhouse gas \nemissions and the threat to fuel security posed by dwindling oil reserves and highly volatile fuel prices. The sector has \nawakened  to  transport\u2019s  own  \u201cinconvenient  truth,\u201d\u0018  but  traditional  policy  and  investments  make  it  ill-equipped  to \nrespond. Meanwhile, the crisis is threatening to cripple cities\u2019 ability to stimulate economic vitality, an ability that often \naccounts for as much as 70% of national gross domestic product.\n\nADB calls for the adoption of a new SUT paradigm that meets these challenges head-on. This paradigm manages \ndemand for travel to supply instead of building more and more infrastructure for the seemingly unstoppable growth in \nprivate vehicles. It calls for increased governance and broader stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process \nto ensure that projects prioritize the travel needs of the end user. And it mandates increased realism in the decision-\nmaking process, whereby institutional, financial, social, economic, and environmental considerations are given equal \nattention  to ensure inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth.\n\nThe new SUT paradigm also calls for a fundamental shift in transport policy and advocates the \u201cavoid\u2013shift\u2013improve\u201d \napproach. It argues that planners should integrate land use developments with mobility needs to minimize the need for \ntravel. They should promote energy-efficient modes of transport, particularly public transport and non-motorized transport \nsuch as bicycles and walking, and seek to strengthen vehicle and fuel technologies, exploring alternate fuel sources, and \nreducing local and global emissions. \n\nPrecedents for all of these measures exist: we have only to decide to use them. By working together, Asia\u2019s cities and \nADB can create safer, cleaner, more sustainable cities, and a better quality of urban life.\n\n6 Guggenheim, Davis. 2006. An Inconvenient Truth.

Rather than mitigate the problems, transport policies \nhave often exacerbated them. In this publication, ADB outlines a new paradigm for sustainable urban \ntransport that gives Asian cities a workable, step-by-step blueprint for reversing the trend and moving \ntoward safer, cleaner, more sustainable cities and a better quality of urban life.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the \nregion\u2019s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor: 1.8 billion people who \nlive on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is committed \nto reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and \nregional integration. \n        Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments\nfor helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees,\ngrants, and technical assistance. \n\nAsian Development Bank\n\u0018 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n\u0018\u0018\u00180 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nPublication Stock No. ARM0\u00180\u00180\u0018 \n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["\u00a9 2009 Asian Development Bank\n", "All rights reserved.

What must policy makers do to provide \nan  ever-growing  population  with  the  access  it  needs  while  ensuring  a  healthy  and  attractive  urban  environment? \nIncreasingly,  stakeholders  have  looked  to  transport  measures  as  a  means  to  relieve  traffic  congestion,  pollution, \naccidents,  and  greenhouse  gases  and  to  improve  residents\u2019  quality  of  life.  But  even  after  vast  investments,  living \nconditions in most developing cities continue to deteriorate.\n", "Many of the reasons for this phenomenon can be traced to past transport measures. Developing cities expand rapidly, \nwith today\u2019s fringe becoming tomorrow\u2019s developed city and the day-after-tomorrow\u2019s core city. But too often, policy \nmakers have focused on here-and-now problems and done little to guide the future city. The result has been much \ninfrastructure in the city center and little development at the periphery, with projects designed to increase mobility \nrather than to foster accessibility. More quickly than anticipated, this has translated into urban sprawl, more pollution, \nlarge under-serviced areas, and inferior living conditions for poorer residents in the city.\n", "As difficult as today\u2019s conditions may seem, however, tomorrow\u2019s challenges will be greater still. Asia\u2019s cities are expected \nto grow by over 40 million per annum in coming years; at the same time, car ownership in many cities is doubling every \n3 to 7 years and urban poverty is on the rise. The consequences for equity, political stability, and residents\u2019 quality of \nlife are threatening. The time has come to change course towards a very different and more promising direction\u2014the \ntime has come to adopt a new paradigm for sustainable urban transport.\n", "A NEW PARADIGM FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN TRANSPORT\n", "\u0018\n"]}
