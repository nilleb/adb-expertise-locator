But even after vast investments, living \nconditions in most developing cities continue to deteriorate.\nMany of the reasons for this phenomenon can be traced to past transport measures. Developing cities expand rapidly, \nwith today\u2019s fringe becoming tomorrow\u2019s developed city and the day-after-tomorrow\u2019s core city. But too often, policy \nmakers have focused on here-and-now problems and done little to guide the future city. The result has been much \ninfrastructure in the city center and little development at the periphery, with projects designed to increase mobility \nrather than to foster accessibility. More quickly than anticipated, this has translated into urban sprawl, more pollution, \nlarge under-serviced areas, and inferior living conditions for poorer residents in the city.\nAs difficult as today\u2019s conditions may seem, however, tomorrow\u2019s challenges will be greater still. Asia\u2019s cities are expected \nto grow by over 40 million per annum in coming years; at the same time, car ownership in many cities is doubling every \n3 to 7 years and urban poverty is on the rise.

In 2007\u2013\n2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted an in-depth study of five Asian cities: \nDhaka, Bangladesh; Changzhou and Harbin in the People\u2019s Republic of China; Kathmandu, \nNepal; and Colombo, Sri Lanka. These cities were selected as a representative sample of \ncities in the region. ADB\u2019s analysis revealed that insofar as transport was concerned, most \npolicies were unsustainable, few were implemented (usually only main roads within the \ncity), and when implementation did occur, outcomes were hardly ever evaluated.\nADB\u2019s five-city study identified the major problems:  Ineffective  transport  planning.

Population growth and decreasing \ndensities have led many cities to expand, and the ownership and use of private cars has vastly outstripped expectations. \nAlthough traffic congestion has long been identified as a problem, it continues to worsen in almost all of the region\u2019s \nurban areas. Citizens are becoming increasingly aware of local air pollution and are experiencing a range of associated \nhealth problems. Asia\u2019s accident rates are among the world\u2019s highest and policy makers worry about greenhouse gas \nemissions and the threat to fuel security posed by dwindling oil reserves and highly volatile fuel prices. The sector has \nawakened to transport\u2019s own \u201cinconvenient truth,\u201d\u0018 but traditional policy and investments make it ill-equipped to \nrespond. Meanwhile, the crisis is threatening to cripple cities\u2019 ability to stimulate economic vitality, an ability that often \naccounts for as much as 70% of national gross domestic product.\nADB calls for the adoption of a new SUT paradigm that meets these challenges head-on. This paradigm manages \ndemand for travel to supply instead of building more and more infrastructure for the seemingly unstoppable growth in \nprivate vehicles. It calls for increased governance and broader stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process \nto ensure that projects prioritize the travel needs of the end user. And it mandates increased realism in the decision-\nmaking process, whereby institutional, financial, social, economic, and environmental considerations are given equal \nattention  to ensure inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth.\nThe new SUT paradigm also calls for a fundamental shift in transport policy and advocates the \u201cavoid\u2013shift\u2013improve\u201d \napproach. It argues that planners should integrate land use developments with mobility needs to minimize the need for \ntravel. They should promote energy-efficient modes of transport, particularly public transport and non-motorized transport \nsuch as bicycles and walking, and seek to strengthen vehicle and fuel technologies, exploring alternate fuel sources, and \nreducing local and global emissions. \nPrecedents for all of these measures exist: we have only to decide to use them.
