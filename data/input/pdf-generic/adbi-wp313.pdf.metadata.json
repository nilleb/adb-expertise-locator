Being latecomers to offshoring work, the \nPRC  and  the  Philippines  have  developed  this  industry  in  cooperation  with  multinational \nenterprises (MNEs). PRC firms have worked with and upgraded within MNEs\u2019 value chains \nwithin  the  PRC  market,  while  the  Philippines  has  relied  on  MNEs  to  come  in  and  set  up \nfacilities,  with  domestic  firms  setting  up  facilities  where  lower  (knowledge)  barriers  to  entry \nprevail.  The  paper  also explores  the  ITES  industries\u2019  implications for  economic growth  and \npoverty  reduction.  ITES  industries  can  contribute  to  overall  economic  growth  and  exports, \nbut due to their small size, will generally tend to have more observable impacts on the cities \nin  which  they  are  located.  From  the  limited  case  data  available,  it  appears  that  the  ITES \nindustries  impact  on  overall  employment  and  other  economic  sectors  to  varying  degrees, \nrelative  to  other  sectors.  As  these  industries  do  not  help  the  more  impoverished  or  less \neducated, they cannot be said to be a solution for the less employable or impoverished, let \nalone to the problem of rural poverty. \n\nJEL Classification: L52, L86, O14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                              \nTschang \n\n                                                        \n\nContents \n\n \n1. \n\nIntroduction\n\n ................................................................................................................ 3\n \n\n1.1  The Beginnings of Software Outsourcing\n1.2  Major Dimensions of Industry\n1.3  Factors Explaining Why and Where Outsourcing Occurs\n\n ......................................................... 3\n \n ........................................................................... 3\n \n ................................. 5\n \n\n2. \n\nOutsourcing in the PRC and the Philippines, and a Comparison with India\n\n ................ 6\n \n\nIndia\n\n2.1  Why Examine the PRC and the Philippines?\n2.2 \n2.3  The PRC\u2019s Software and Software Outsourcing Industry\n2.4  The Philippine IT Services Industry\n2.5  Comparing the Three Cases\n\n ................................................... 7\n \n ................................................................................................................. 8\n \n ................................. 8\n \n ................................................................ 12\n \n .......................................................................... 15\n \n\n3. \n\nThe Growth and Equity Implications of IT Services Outsourcing\n\n .............................. 16\n \n\n17\n \n\n3.1  The IT Services Industry, Economic Growth, and Linkages within the Economy\n \n3.2  Effects on Employment\n3.3 \n3.4 \n\n .................................................................................. 19\n \n................................................. 20\n \n .............................................................. 21\n \n\nImplications for Regional Economic Disparity\nIT and Broader-based Development\n\n4. \n\nConclusions\n\n ............................................................................................................. 23\n \n\nReferences\n\n ......................................................................................................................... 24\n \n\nAppendix\n\n ............................................................................................................................. 27\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n1.  INTRODUCTION \n\nThis  paper  will  introduce  the  different  developmental  experiences  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC), the Philippines, and India in software and services outsourcing, and will provide a \ndiscussion of their implications for economic growth and poverty reduction in these countries. The \nsoftware  industry  has  been  considered  in  many  quarters  to  be  the  vanguard  of  a  global  trend \ntoward  the  outsourcing  of  services  by  developed  regions  and  the  development  of  new  service \nsectors  conducting  that  outsourcing  work  within  developing  regions.  In  this  paper,  software  and \ninformation technology (IT)-enabled services (ITES) outsourcing industries will be referred to as IT \nservices industries.  \n\n1.1  The Beginnings of Software Outsourcing \n\nIn  a  way,  services  outsourcing  has  been  going  on  for  decades.  The  outsourcing  of  services \nstarted  domestically  in  the  United  States  (US)  with  software;  in  particular  when  information \nsystems  were \u201coutsourced\u201d from  large  enterprises  to  \u201cproviders.\u201d  Developing  countries  like India \nonly  got  involved  in  this  type  of  work  later  (in  the  1980s),  early  on  only  augmenting  the  labor \nforces  of  US-based  companies.  Eventually,  this  \u201con-site\u201d  work  was  transferred  off  site  (or \n\u201coffshored\u201d) to India, as information technologies and infrastructure enabled the work to be done \nat a distance, and in lower-cost, remote locations. \n\nIn addition to India, a number of other countries show promise in being offshoring or outsourcing \nlocations. While outsourcing usually denotes moving work from the firm to outside its boundaries, \nbut  not  necessarily  offshore,  from  this  point  on,  outsourcing  and  offshoring  will  be  used \ninterchangeably to denote work that is moved offshore, if the outsourcing is clearly contextualized \nas being to offshore locations. These include the PRC, the Philippines, and, to some extent, Viet \nNam  and  Sri  Lanka  (in  Asia),  as  well  as  Brazil  and  Russia.  The  two  Asian  countries  that  have \nrecently  seen  some  successful  developments  in  outsourcing  are  the  PRC  and  the  Philippines. \nHowever, as we will show, for the PRC the outsourcing generally follows the original US model\u2014\noutsourcing  of  work  from  domestic  (PRC)  companies  (called  \u201cclients\u201d)  to  other  locally  based \n(foreign  and  domestic)  enterprises  (called  \u201cproviders\u201d).  Typically,  outsourcing  locations  are \ndeveloping  countries  with  large  surplus  low-wage  and  high-quality  labor  pools.  Pockets  of \noutsourcing do exist even in higher wage countries such as Malaysia and Singapore.  \n\nIn  Section  2,  the  Indian,  PRC,  and  Philippine  cases  will  be  examined.  Given  India\u2019s  seeming \ndominance in IT, one issue of interest is how the other two countries \u201cemerged,\u201d as well as how \ntheir  paths  varied  from  one  another.  The  factors  that  caused  this  \u201cemergence\u201d  of  industry  (as \nopposed to those factors that affect the growth and scaling of the industry) will also be identified. \nThe Philippine and PRC experiences will be compared to that of India where possible in order to \ndraw policy implications. Section 3 will examine the economic and equity implications of the ITES \nindustries  in  these  three  countries,  and  discuss,  among  other  elements,  employment,  linkages \nwithin the economy, and the implications for poverty reduction. \n\n1.2  Major Dimensions of Industry \n\nTable  1  illustrates  the  nature  and  relative  strengths  of  all  three  selected  countries\u2019  industries. \nWhile India\u2019s industry dwarfs those of both the PRC and the Philippines, the industry has a place \nin each country\u2019s development strategy, be it overweighted (as in the India) or part of a balanced \nportfolio of industries (as in the PRC). In 2006, the PRC\u2019s IT services\u2019 share of total exports was \njust 3.3%, as compared with India\u2019s 26.3% and the Philippines\u2019 2.5% (Deutsche Bank Research \n2009).  The  Philippine  business  services\u2019  (which  includes  IT  services)  share  of  gross  domestic \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nproduct (GDP)  rose from  1.5%  in  2004 to  2.1%  in  2008,  while  the  Indian  IT  services  equivalent \nwent from 1.2% of GDP in 1998 to 5.8% in 2009; a nearly 500% increase in 11 years (National \nAssociation of Software and Service Companies [NASSCOM] 2009).1\n \n\nTable 1: Basic Characteristics of the ITES Sectors in India, the PRC, and the Philippines \n\n \nSectoral focus \n\nOwnership \nMarket focus \nSize \n(employees)  \nRevenue  \n(2005/2006) \n \n \nRevenue \n(2008) \n\nIndia \nBalanced between \nsoftware and BPO \n\nDomestic firms \nEnglish-speaking \n2.23 million (2008) \n\nPRC \nLargely software services for \nMNEs in the PRC, some BPO (to \nJapan) \nDomestic firms \nJapan and Korea \n1.42 million (2009) \n\nThe Philippines \nLargely call centers, \nsome BPO and \nsoftware \nMultinational firms \nEnglish-speaking \n435,000 people (2008) \n\nUS$13.5 billion (2005) \n \n\nSoftware services outsourcing of \nUS$0.3 billion in 2nd\nof total domestic IT market of \nUS$1.5 billion) \n \n\n qtr, 2006 (out \n\nUS$71.7 billion (2008) \n\nUS$6.1 billion (2008) \n\nUS$2.4 billion (2005) \n\nBPO=business process outsourcing, IT=information technology, ITES=IT-enabled services, MNE=multinational enterprise, \nPRC=People\u2019s Republic of China, US$=United States dollar. \n\nSources: PRC: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2007) (based on Analysys data), People\u2019s Daily \n(2010); India: National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM (2007a, 2009, 2010); Philippines: \nCongressional Planning and Budgeting Department (2009) (note: based on Business Processing Association of the \nPhilippines data).  \n\nTable 1 also highlights the three dimensions that characterize an industrial model of development: \nownership (of firms), sectoral orientation, and market focus. \n\nOwnership:  The first  dimension  is  the  ownership  of firms,  which  conveys  information  about the \ncompetitive  advantages  and  strategies  of  firms.  A  more  important  finding  of  this  study  is  the \nobservation  that  multinational  enterprises  (MNEs)  play  substantial  but  different  roles  in  different \ncountries\u2019 industries, as will be shown in the cases of the PRC and the Philippines. In the case of \nthe PRC, while domestic firms are ostensibly trying to develop along the lines of India, MNEs also \nplay a role in supporting the growth of domestic firms. In the case of the Philippines, it is primarily \nMNEs that are creating outsourcing facilities, while domestic firms have tended to be much more \nlimited in number and capability.  \n\nSectoral  orientation:  The  second  dimension  is  the  nature  of  the  industry\u2019s  clients\u2019  sectors,  for \nexample,  software  services  or  ITES,  which  includes:  (i)  business  process  outsourcing  (BPO) \n(which  may  involve  work  from  an  array  of  other  sectors),  (ii)  call  centers,  and  (iii)  research  and \ndevelopment  (R&D)  (or  engineering)  services.  India  started  out  primarily  in  software  but  has \nbroadened its scope to include all manners of outsourcing, while the Philippines started out mainly \nin call centers, but is gradually broadening its capacity to encompass a somewhat more balanced \nindustrial  structure  containing  other  ITES  sectors  and  software.  As  with  India,  the  PRC  also \nstarted  out  in  software  outsourcing  and  is  growing  its  business  process  work,  but  the  PRC  is \ndoing so in a more limited way. Invariably, each country has broadened its sectoral composition to \ninclude outsourcing in multiple sectors. \n\nMarket  focus:  The third dimension has to do with market focus. India and the Philippines have \nfocused  primarily  on  exports. India  is gradually  developing  a growing  domestic  sector,  while  the \nPhilippines has had to contend with being a late mover. Understanding these differences will help \n\n                                                \n1 The PRC\u2019s export of IT services was reported to account for about 1.2\u20131.4% of GDP in 2006, but the data for both \nIndia and the PRC were reported to be circumspect (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 2006). \n\n \n\n4 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nus  understand  how  other  countries,  such  as  the  PRC  and  the  Philippines,  can  still  succeed  in \nthese sectors.  \n\n1.3  Factors Explaining Why and Where Outsourcing Occurs \n\nFrom  a  developmental  policy  perspective,  as  well  as  from  the  viewpoint  of  individual  firms,  the \nimportant issues  are which factors dictate the formation of an outsourcing industry, and whether \nthese  factors  and  the  \u201coutsourcing  model\u201d  they  comprise  vary  from  country  to  country.  There  is \nalready a broad literature on MNE location behavior containing studies on the software industry. \nThe  breadth  of  possible  explanatory  factors  and  conditions  include  factor-based  comparative \nadvantage (or \u201cfactor advantages\u201d), such as labor at the national and regional levels, as well as \nother firm-level sources of competitiveness and capability. The actions of government and foreign \nand domestic firms, as well as the relations between them, have also helped the growth of these \nindustries.  \n\nThree  main  types  of  factors  can  be  defined  that  influence  the  outsourcing  industry\u2019s  pattern  of \ndevelopment (including the location of the work and the emergence of domestic firms): (i) factor \nadvantages,  (ii)  firm  capabilities,  and  (iii)  the  business  environment  (including  the  role  of \ngovernment  policy  and  business  opportunities). These,  respectively,  (roughly)  equate to the key \nelements  behind  various  software  industries\u2019  development,  as  suggested  by  Arora  and \nGambardella  (2006):  (i)  comparative  advantage  (or  what  we  term  factor  advantages),  (ii)  firm \ncompetencies, and (iii) opportunities. \n\nFactor  advantages: This first type of factor, the advantage of labor supply conditions, has been \nclearly identified in studies of investment patterns as well as of industrial export competitiveness, \nincluding  those  that  relate  to  software  outsourcing  investments  (Arora  et  al.  2001;  Arora  and \nGambardella 2006; Dossani and Kenney 2003; McKinsey Global Institute 2003). Together, many \nof these studies support the common hypothesis that resources, such as labor costs and supply, \nare critical to the choice of location that the work is to be outsourced to. This rationale for foreign \ninvestment  could  be  termed  \u201cresource-seeking\u201d  behavior  in  the  conventional  international \nbusiness  vernacular,  resulting  in  many  MNEs  entering  lower-wage  countries  like  the  PRC, \ncountries  in  South  East  Asia  such  as  Malaysia,  the  Philippines  and  Singapore,  and  India.  The \noutsourcing  done  by foreign  MNEs\u2019  shared  services facilities  accounts for  on the  order  of  about \n10%  of the Indian  industry\u2019s  total,  but  is  a much larger  contributor to  the Philippine  IT  industry\u2019s \ngrowth.2\n  \n\nFirms\u2019 capabilities: The second set of factors involves firms\u2019 competencies and strategies. Using \nthis as a lens, industrial development can be understood to be the result of how individual firms \ndevelop  their  capabilities.  In  India,  the  accounts  of  how  early  firms  succeeded  through  the \ncreation of dynamic capabilities are by now a part of the industry\u2019s history (Athreye 2005). In fact, \nmost  studies  on  outsourcing tend to  define the upgrading  process  as  a simpler form  of  strategy \nthat relates to how the process and knowledge capabilities of firms are increased. Many firms use \nthe  Software  Engineering  Institute\u2019s  Capability  Maturity  Model  as  a  proxy  for  capability  (see  for \nexample, Krishnan et al. [2000]).  \n\nBusiness  environment:  This  brings  us  to  the  third  type  of  factor:  the  business  environment \n(specifically,  the  business  opportunities  presented  to  firms).  It  is  worth  pointing  out  that  India\u2019s \nearly  start  gave  its  firms  an  unparalleled  \u201cblue  sky\u201d  (i.e.,  virgin  and  unrestricted)  opportunity  for \ndeveloping  their  capabilities,  and  therefore,  India\u2019s  ITES  industry  as  a  whole. While  outsourcing \nopportunities  continue  to  grow,  India\u2019s  advantages  are  by  now,  according  to  some  observers, \n\n                                                \n2  Authors\u2019  estimate  based  on  interviews  and  statistics  from  India\u2019s  National  Association  of  Software  Services \nCompanies (NASSCOM) (http://www.nasscom.com). \n\n \n\n5 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n\u201clocked  in\u201d  by  virtue  of  its  firms\u2019  scale  and  depth  of  capability.    We  will  illustrate  how  more \ncountries are taking advantage of opportunities.  \n\nA  second  aspect  of  the  business  environment  that  may  impact  outsourcing  patterns  is  the \ngovernment  (though  it  is  more  known  for  fostering  new  heavy  industries  and  the  electronics \nindustry). The literature that has a bearing on this factor is what might be termed the literature on \npolitical economy. There has historically been a very rich literature on the East Asian electronics \nsectors  (for  example,  Amsden  [1989]  and  Hobday  [1995]).  The  government\u2019s  impact  on  the \npattern of industrialization in software was  shown in early studies of India by Heeks (1996), and \nstudies of India and Brazil by Evans (1995). The conventional wisdom, highlighted by studies of \nthe Indian software industry, is that the government had less of a direct role to play. While the role \nof the government is significant in infrastructure and education, it is not perhaps as integral to firm \nformation  for  services  outsourcing  as  it  was  in  the  electronics  sectors  of  newly  industrialized \ncountries such as Taipei,China and Singapore.  \n\nA  third  aspect  of  the  business  environment  could  be  the  industry  level,  in  terms  of  what  a  lead \nMNE firm or cluster might provide to other \u201cfollower\u201d MNEs looking to enter a particular country. \nThe account of how Texas Instruments opened the door to direct MNE software sector investment \nin  India  suggests  that  this  kind  of  leadership  or  demonstration  effect  exists  (Patibandla  and \nPeterson 2002). This is further illustrated by what recent firms like General Electric, did for R&D \nservices  (Tschang,  Amsden,  and  Sadagopan  2003).  This  is  not  always  the  case  where  strong \ndomestic  firms  exist.  For  instance,  more  recently,  domestic  firms  did  much  to  promote  the  BPO \nsector  (Dossani  and  Kenney  2003).  This  paper  will  not  focus  on  clusters  or  the  government, \nhowever,  as  the  cases  are  explored,  it  will  be  useful  to  examine  whether  these  three  sets  of \nfactors  help  to  frame  the  factors  highlighted  in  the  following  sections  as  being  responsible  for \nindustrial success. \n\n2.  OUTSOURCING IN THE PRC AND THE PHILIPPINES, AND A \n\nCOMPARISON WITH INDIA \n\nThis section of the paper focuses on the process by which new industries emerge. The question \nof  how  countries  other  than  India  are  succeeding  in  developing  outsourcing  industries  will  be \naddressed. In the two cases being explored (the PRC and the Philippines), this is done through \nthe  involvement  of  MNEs.  By  focusing  on  the  firm  level,  a  more  complete  explanation  of  how \nindustrialization occurs than is possible by looking only at what happens at the national or industry \nlevel  can  be  provided.  Individual  firms\u2019  experiences  might  actually  be  highly  differentiated  from \none another, even when they seemingly enter the same sectors, since they may focus on different \nparts of the value chain within a given sector (Athreye 2006). And yet, there is some manner of \nconvergence  among  the  firms.  Furthermore,  identifying  ownership  patterns  illustrates  how \ncountries  may  take  different  paths  to  development.  In  the  case  of  countries  with  sectors \ndisadvantaged by limited resources and size, the composition of their industries tend to be more \nMNE-led (as has been the case in the Philippines). In the case of India, and to some extent the \nPRC,  the  focus  has  been  on  domestic  firms,  though  MNEs  have  played  a  role  separate  from \ndomestic firms in India, and have played a formative role as clients for the PRC\u2019s domestic firms. \nThus, MNEs can shape different countries\u2019 outsourcing industries in at least two different ways.3\n  \n\n                                                \n3 While it will be challenging to integrate the diversity of factors outlined above into a single integrated theory, common \nfactors  can  be  highlighted  in  an  effort  to  create  an  \u201ceclectic-type\u201d  framework  not  unlike  Dunning\u2019s  (1988)  ownership, \nlocation, internalization (or better known as OLI) framework for international business strategy. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n2.1  Why Examine the PRC and the Philippines? \n\nWhile  many  countries  by  now  possess  at  least  a  few  firms  that  perform  software  or  BPO \noutsourcing, the PRC and the Philippines are often mentioned as potential contenders to India in \nthis arena, and both countries have the human resources, numbers of firms, and growth rates to \npotentially contend with India, at least in certain IT industry sectors. What will be examined in this \npaper  is  to  what  degree  each  country\u2019s  model  of  service  industry  development  has  varied  from \nthat  of  India\u2019s,  both  in  terms  of  how  the  industries  have  developed,  and  the  nature  of  their \nownership and other structures (e.g., the relationships between the different types of firms).  \n\nThe PRC represents a different aspect of industrial development from India\u2019s, shaped largely by \nits  domestic market-focused  industry.  By  virtue  of  its  huge  domestic market  and skills  base, the \nPRC has the greatest chance of developing a software industry that has the two legs\u2014domestic \nand  foreign\u2014proposed  by  Schware  (1992)  as  a  possible  balanced  strategy.  The  PRC\u2019s \ngovernment  has  a  strong  technology  policy,  which  includes  software  industry  development.  The \nPRC is known for its software expertise in terms of individual skills and abundance of manpower, \nand its domestic market for IT \u201csubstitutes\u201d for exports as an opportunity. The PRC has designs \non exports as well. The Philippines is developing strengths in both BPO and call centers. Most of \nthese centers are MNE-owned, and there is seemingly little government intervention. Even early \non,  the  Philippines  ranked  sixth  out  of  25  countries  in  a  study  on  its  attractiveness  as  an \noffshoring location (A.T. Kearney, 2004).  \n\nThe  PRC\u2019s  college  workforce  is  large  by  almost  any  measure,  with  plans  for  200,000  software \ngraduates alone each year, according to reports in 2005. A news report noted that the outsourcing \nindustry recruited 690,000 employees in 2009 (People\u2019s Daily 2010). The Philippines, one of the \nlargest  English-speaking  countries  in  the  world,  had  387,000  university  graduates  in  2003/4,  of \nwhich 86,000 were IT, math and engineering-related, and 101,000 were business and commerce \nrelated  (International  Labour  Organization  2009).  In  this  broad  sense,  the  PRC  is  unlike  most \nother  countries  due  to  its  huge  domestic  demand  and  Chinese  language  orientation,  while  the \nPhilippines  is  similar  to  many  other  countries  besides  India  in  its  initially  possessing  pockets  of \nstrength in BPO and call centers.  \n\nPatterns of Growth in the PRC and Philippine Outsourcing Industries \n\nIndustry emergence revolves around the factors that drive industry location behavior and growth. \nIn the case of the PRC, the firms studied were largely domestic firms, so the focus was somewhat \non the origins of the firms and how they have upgraded themselves technologically through their \nwork with MNEs. In the case of the Philippines, because the MNEs themselves are directly setting \nup  shared  services  facilities,  the  focus  was  on  the  decision-making  processes  involved  in \nchoosing the facility location (and the factors influencing them).  \n\nApproach \n\nThis section of the paper focuses primarily on software services firms in the PRC, and BPO and \nother ITES firms in the Philippines. Appendix 1 shows a broad outline of the sample of firms from \nboth  countries  (pseudonyms  have  been  used  to  mask  the  actual  names  of  firms).  In  the  rest  of \nthis  paper,  a  combination  of  observations  will  be  reported,  based  on  personal  interviews \nconducted  with  companies  in  the  PRC,  the  Philippines,  and  India,  as  well  as  secondary  data. \nGiven  that  the  goal  is  to  outline  a  model  that  can  be  compared  with  that  of  India,  the  following \nsection will begin with a summary of the Indian case. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n2.2 \n\nIndia \n\nThe Indian software industry now commands a large proportion of the world\u2019s attention, and many \nFortune 500 companies are clients of Indian software firms. India\u2019s head start, and in particular its \nfirms\u2019 strengths and scale, place it far ahead of most other countries\u2019 firms in terms of their ability \nto  perform  outsourced  tasks  on  everything  from  software  to  BPO  (including  accounting  and \nfinancial functions) to call center work. India is by now the undisputed leader in both the software \nservices  and  ITES  sectors  (which  include  call  centers  and  BPO).  While  the  growth  of  software \nservices took place first, it was the BPO and call center work that broadly cemented India\u2019s place \nin the newly industrializing world. While the R&D services sector has existed since the beginning, \nit has been slower to take off and has only become significant in recent years.  \n\nAs the primary beneficiaries of the global software-related outsourcing trend, India\u2019s software and \nITES  sectors  have  been  growing  rapidly.  In  2005,  the  growth  rate  was  32%,  which  reflects  not \nonly  a  scaling  up  of  capability,  but  also  a  deepening  of  capability  and  increased  value  added. \nSoftware  and  services  grew  by  27%  in  2005,  reflecting  the  maturing  (i.e.,  filling  out  of  work \nopportunities)  of  the  sector,  while  \u201cITES-BPO\u201d  grew  by  49%  (reflecting  the  enormous \nopportunities  in  the  sector),  and  the  domestic  market  grew  by  25%.  Software  services  exports \nwere US$12 billion in 2005, ITES-BPO exports were US$5.2 billion, and the domestic market was \nworth  US$4.8  billion. 4\n  At  the  same  time,  India\u2019s  software  firms  and  their  processes  continue  to \nmature. By the mid-2000s, well over 50 firms had attained Capability Maturity Model level five, the \nhighest level of process certification. The total ITES-BPO industry was estimated to have reached \nUS$71.7  billion  in  2008,  and  was  estimated  to  account  for  5.8%  of  India\u2019s  GDP.  Software  and \nservices export revenues accounted for about US$47 billion of this, and have grown at about 16\u2013\n17%  over  the  past  year  (NASSCOM  2009).  As  noted  in  Table  1,  direct  employment  for  the \nindustry was nearly 2.23 million employees in 2008.  \n\nThe growth of outsourcing in India has been said to be the result of the three factors identified by \nArora  and  Gambardella  (2006):  (i)  the  availability  of  a  skilled  labor  force  (as  is  well  known  by \nnow), (ii) the origin and growth of domestic firms and their capabilities (Athreye 2006), and (iii) the \never growing need for outsourcing, including in relation to the problems that clients encountered \nwith  the  year  2000  transition  in  computing  dates  (known  as  the  \u201cY2K\u201d  problem).  In  particular,  it \nhas been noted that the story of \u201cthe software industry (in several emerging markets)\u2026is far more \nthe story of successful firms than of successful regions\u201d (Arora and Gambardella 2006:292). Other \nfactors also play a smaller but not necessarily less important role. For instance, members of the \n\u201cIndian diaspora\u201d working for potential client firms in the US helped to create reputational effects \nwith those potential clients  and helped Indian firms to secure work with those clients (Kapur and \nMcHale 2006).  \n\nThere  continue  to  be  debates  about  the  software  and  services  sectors,  for  instance,  about \nwhether  the  rise  of  call  centers  is  as  sustainable  as  the  \u201ctechnical\u201d  work  that  accompanies \nsoftware,  and  about  social  issues  with  regards  to  having  young  people  work  night  shifts  in \neffectively lower-skilled (than their qualifications) jobs. However, based on the limited number of \ncountries that  have  large  English-speaking  populations,  it  appears  that  a  large  proportion  of the \nwork is in India to stay.  \n\n2.3  The PRC\u2019s Software and Software Outsourcing Industry  \n\nThe PRC\u2019s current software industry must be considered as the two separate sets of firms, each \nwith  its  own  history:  The  first  occurred  earlier  and  involved  domestic  software  firms  directly \n                                                \n4 This is measured using NASSCOM\u2019s definition of ITES-BPO, which is narrower than the one used by the Philippine \ngovernment, as the former\u2019s definition of ITES excludes software services and the latter\u2019s definition of ITES includes it. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nservicing  foreign  MNE  clients  which  were  themselves  providers  of  products  and  systems \nintegration  services  for  the  domestic  market.  The  second  involved  a  new  breed  of  outsourcing \nfirms that specialized in outsourcing provisions for the foreign software MNEs that are themselves \noperating in the PRC\u2019s domestic market. As shown in Table 1, the overall PRC software industry \nis small as compared to Indian software exports. While the statistics on China\u2019s software activity \nvary, one consulting firm\u2019s report recently showed the amount of PRC software exporting activity \nto be relatively small, with software outsourcing exports of US$600 million reported in 2004. This \nwas forecasted to increase to US$4.7 billion by 2009, representing a compounded annual growth \nrate of 51% (Niosi and Tschang 2009). Software exports as a proportion of total exports are also \nvery  small  in  comparison  with  India.  Nevertheless,  the  differences  between  the  PRC  model  and \nthat  of  India\u2019s\u2014in  particular,  the  PRC\u2019s  focus  on  the  domestic  economy\u2014make  it  worthwhile \nhighlighting.  \n\nThe General Development of the PRC\u2019s Software Industry \n\nThe PRC\u2019s software industry was, in the early 2000s, considered by the central government to be \nso  critical  to  industrial  development  that  it,  along  with  semiconductors,  was  promoted  as  one  of \ntwo  new  lead  sectors  (Tschang  and  Xue  2005).  Many  software  firms  first  attempted  to  work  on \neither  a  product  model  involving  some  customized  services,  or  on  a  systems  integration  model. \nHowever, for many companies, both models by now appear to have low margins and prospects \nfor growth. The road for product companies has generally been hard due to a variety of reasons, \nincluding a lack of customer IT maturity, fragmented markets, and intense competition on the low \nend  from  low-cost  domestic  imitators  and  at  the  high  end  from  well-funded  foreign  MNEs  with \nadvanced  technology  (Tschang  and  Xue  2005).5,6\n  It  was  partly  because  of  this  that  the  PRC\u2019s \nfirms  started to  see outsourcing  as  a solution.  According to  an  official from the  Beijing  Software \nIndustry Productivity Center (BSIPC), the margins from outsourcing were in the 30% range for the \nbetter PRC firms (which mirrors margins from India), as opposed to in the less than 10% range for \nproduct and systems integration companies. Thus, the outsourcers have ostensibly avoided trying \nto make products or to undertake systems integration work. \n\n2.3.1  The Emergence of Software and Services (and Emergence Factors) \n\nA Japanese Stimulus for the Export Sector \n\nOutsourcing in the form of exports of software services was already well underway in the PRC by \n2001, but in the beginning, firms were mainly focused on the Japanese market (which continues \nto  be  a  strong  market)  (Niosi  and  Tschang  2009).  With  the  rise  of  PRC  government  interest  in \noutsourcing  in  the  early  2000s,  further  efforts  were  made  to  improve  the  capability  of  the \nworkforce and firms. At that time, Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Xi\u2019an were among a \nnumber  of  cities  attempting  to  outsource  to  the  Japanese  and  US  markets.  In  2001,  one  of  the \n\n                                                \n5 There have been some product companies strong enough to compete with foreign firms in the middle or near the high \nend of the domestic market, but these companies typically compete only in the domestic market, and some were able to \nsurvive  because  of  government  contracts.  For  certain  types  of  software,  such  as  enterprise  software,  the  best  PRC \nfirms tend to service only small and medium enterprises, while for other types of software, such as personal computer-\nbased software, the best PRC firms can compete with MNEs to some degree. However, other weaknesses in the firms \nor  market  can  affect  firms\u2019  performance  (Tschang  and  Xue  2005).  Piracy  is  one  of  the  problems  that  afflict  product \nfirms. One well known product company that was interviewed in the course of this study (both in 2001 and 2006) noted \nrecently  that  their  well  known  product  was  so  heavily  pirated  that  it  became  a  money  loser,  and  that  it  was  only  the \ngovernment stepping in to require that their software be used in procurement contracts that helped to save this line of \nbusiness for them. \n6 Another problem, facing  the systems  integration  model,  relates  to  it  generally  involving lower-skilled  work,  including \ninstallation of hardware and packaged software (made by other companies) and networking. One of the largest systems \nintegrators that was interviewed earlier admitted that their profits were quite low. There have also been recent reports of \nother  systems  integrators  suffering  low  margins  (Tschang  and  Xue  2005).  According  to  one  interviewee,  these \ncompanies may also have difficulty in trying to upgrade themselves along the value chain. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nregional  government\u2019s  strategies  in  Xi\u2019an  and  other  cities  was  to  provide  Japanese  language \ntraining,  a  skill  that  many  Chinese  were  able  to  pick  up  due  to  compatibilities  in  the  written \nlanguage  scripts.7\n  At  that  time,  many  firms  were  seeking  to  imitate  the  success  of  Neusoft,  a \nShenyang-based firm that had the strongest export performance in 2001 through 2005, achieved \nalmost entirely by servicing the Japanese market. More recently, many software companies have \nbegun focusing on BPO, specifically in the Japanese and Korean markets.  \n\nThe Japanese market is of special importance for the PRC as an offshoring market. By 2006, the \nJapanese market accounted for 61% of the PRC\u2019s outsourcing revenue, versus the US market\u2019s \n22%  (Niosi  and  Tschang,  2009).Thus,  while  the  bulk  of  the  cases  examined  in  this  paper  are \nconcerned with firms that service the US MNEs in the domestic Chinese market, the size of the \nJapanese  market,  and  its  attraction  for  PRC  firms  that  want  to  service  foreign  markets  directly, \nmake it worthwhile describing the Japanese offshoring model, at least in brief. At least two large \nfirms  (Sinocom  and  Neusoft)  have  a  very  significant  presence  in  the  Japanese  software \noutsourcing market.  Sinocom  was  originally  a  conventional  systems  integrator  (along  with  many \nlarge firms that originally comprised the PRC\u2019s software industry), but according to the BSIPC, the \ncompany chose to cut all its business in the PRC in order to specialize in outsourcing to Japan. It \nbecame  the  largest  outsourcing  company  in  Beijing  by  2005,  with  Japan  comprising  90%  of  its \n8\nmarket\n. However, while companies like Sinocom are considered to be doing offshore work, they \ndo  not  service  the  end  user  directly,  but  instead  contract  their  work  from  Japanese  systems \nintegrators like Fujitsu or Hitachi who in turn service the Japanese end user client (Hitachi is also \na strategic investor in Neusoft).  \n\nWestern MNEs and \u201cDomestic Market Outsourcing\u201d in the PRC \n\nSince 2001, and especially in recent years, another outsourcing trend has emerged in the PRC. In \norder to  discuss  this trend,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  the role  of  MNEs,  particularly Western \npackage  software  and  software  services  MNEs,  and  the  PRC\u2019s  domestic  market.  This  follows \nfrom  the  drive  for  MNEs  to  enter  the  booming  PRC  market.  MNEs  have  already  dominated  the \nsoftware  sector  in  the  PRC,  including  firms  such  as  Microsoft,  Oracle,  and  BEA,  and  software \nservices and systems integration companies like IBM. According to the interviewee at the BSIPC, \nmany  of  these  foreign  MNEs  suffer  from  a  locational  disadvantage  (e.g.,  in  sourcing  labor  and \naccessing  clients)  when  trying  to  service  the  PRC  market,  especially  as  it  becomes  fragmented \nwhen viewed across cities and sectors. Relationships are vital to conducting business in the PRC \n(Saxenian  2003).  The  difficulty  of  entering  the  PRC\u2019s  market  may  be  due  to  differences  in \nstandards,  administrative  rules,  and  programs  that  exist  across  regions  and  cities. 9\n  In  this \nenvironment, MNEs need to localize products and content. On the other hand, many PRC product \nand  systems  integration  companies  do  not  have  the  capability  to  offer  higher-end  services  like \nsystems consulting and design, but do have lower-level capabilities. Thus, a convenient marriage \nwas created between MNEs and selected domestic firms that the former could outsource some of \ntheir basic work to.  \n\n                                                \n7 The PRC\u2019s government has been quite strategic in its support of software enterprises (Tschang and Xue 2005), but \nmuch of this followed an R&D investments approach. With the growing success of exports, the government has also \nfocused its efforts on promoting outsourcing. Along with its historical investments in research and education through its \nuniversities and the Chinese Academy of Sciences research institutes (both of which are sources of spin-off \ncompanies), in 2001, the PRC\u2019s national government announced plans to designate 35 universities as centers for \nsoftware engineering programs. This would provide as many as 17,500 more graduates to the labor force each year.  \n8 Author\u2019s interview with BSIPC, 2005. \n\n9 There  are  also  at  least  three  markets:  corporate,  government,  and  private.  However,  the  governmental  market  is \nstrongly  bound  by  policy  and  regulations,  and  many  software  and  systems  contracts  in  the  past  supported  domestic \nfirms.  Furthermore,  some  PRC  corporate  customers  have,  at  least  in  the  past,  been  difficult  to  sell  services  to. \nAccording to one software firm that was interviewed in 2001, many customers did not have strong IT capabilities, and \ncould not see the value in IT, let alone understand how to integrate IT into their business functions. \n\n \n\n10 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nEmergence of the New PRC Outsourcing Firms \n\nIn  order  to  compare  the  PRC  case  with  that  of  the  Philippines,  the  factors  that  caused  the \nemergence  of  the  PRC  software  sourcing  industry  will  first  be  examined.  The  origins  of  the \n(recently rapidly growing) domestic firms that service MNEs in the domestic economy are largely \nprivate,  and  none  appear  to  have  been  government  owned  or  to  have  involved  government \ninvestments.10\n As noted earlier, a key aspect of the recent PRC outsourcing pattern has been the \nway in which firms are connecting closely with foreign MNEs operating in the PRC. Most, if not all, \nof these PRC firms also aspire to get involved in the offshore services market to varying degrees. \n\nLike many PRC outsourcing companies, the new breed of private software services firms, such as \nBeyondsoft, Worksoft, and ISoftStone in Beijing, started by doing localization and testing work for \nlarger  MNEs  like  Microsoft  who  were  trying  to  enter  the  PRC.  These  three  PRC  companies  are \nnow among the largest firms serving the US MNEs in the PRC.  \n\nOne central feature in this model is the knowledge that the Chinese firms gain from working with \nMNE  clients.  This  is  similar  to  the  experience  of  Indian  firms  earlier  in  their  development,  and \nindeed of any outsourcer, be it in hardware or software. Such learning eventually helps the firms \nto  advance  up  the  value  chain.  Firms  also  note  that  MNEs  can  help  them  to  build  their \nmanagement and technical capabilities, provide training, and transfer knowledge. Indian firms with \na  presence  in  the  PRC,  like  Tata  Consultancy  Services  and  the  educational  provider  NIIT,  also \nbring management and educational approaches and know-how to the PRC, especially in the form \nof software process management skills and capabilities. \n\n2.3.2  Factors Influencing Scaling Up and Upgrading \n\nThe rapidly  growing  PRC  firms  have  had  to  engage  in  simultaneously  upgrading their  capability \n(to increase their value-added proposition) and scaling up by way of expanding their workforces \nand  business  coverage.  This  has  occurred  by  various  means.  One  strategy  has  been  to  use \nacquisitions  to  increase  their  capability  and  value  proposition  to  clients\u2014a  strategy  that  is \ncommon to firms in both India and the PRC (Niosi and Tschang 2009), as well as to those in other \ncountries.  The  factors  that  appear  to  impinge  upon  this  upgrading  can  be  loosely  classified  into \nthree types: (i) internal organization factors, such as management and organization; (ii) soft skill \nfactors; and (iii) geographic skill management factors.  \n\nIt is worth noting that the emphasis on organizational capability varies somewhat from that seen in \nthe conventional development pattern of East Asian manufacturing. In the latter, the upgrading is \nprimarily  technological, whereas  in  the  case  of software  and  other  services,  it  involves  technical \nas  well  as  organizational  capability.  Not  only  do  software  firms  have  to  develop  internal  training \nsystems to help transfer knowledge from experienced people to new employees, they also have \nto  develop  systems  to  capture  knowledge  (i.e.,  knowledge  management  systems),  as  well  as \nsystems  for  collaboration  and  handling  globally  distributed  work.  In  contrast  to  this,  smaller  and \neven  medium-sized  companies  face  another  problem  in  that  they  do  not  have  the  scale  to \ncompete for larger clients, and as a result, cannot grow.  \n\nSoft skills  and  cultural  issues  appear  to  be  a factor  of  concern  for  a  number  of firms,  especially \nwhen  dealing  with Western clients.  Chinese  language  skills might  not  be  suited to  BPO  in  other \nlanguages,  and  even  in  software,  where  technical  languages  may  be  shared,  there  are  cultural \nissues that come into play when attempting to integrate the work cultures of PRC and American \nfirms. It is notable that even Microsoft encountered problems with its PRC operation when it tried \n\n                                                \n10 In contrast, Tschang and Xue (2005) estimated that as many as a third of the largest systems integrators, and some \nnumber  of  other  firms  with  stronger  capabilities  (e.g.,  firms  engaged  in  product  development),  appear  to  have \ngovernment roots. \n\n \n\n11 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nto  merge  its  US  culture  with  the  local  culture,  and  the  company  had  to  make  multiple  attempts \nbefore they managed to work through the differences in culture.  \n\nThe  third  factor  involves  growing  by  managing  the  growth  of  facilities  located  in  multiple  labor \nmarkets\u2014in this case, across cities. Many Beijing firms have built secondary outsourcing facilities \noutside  of  Beijing  to  tap  into  the  local  labor  markets,  which  often  have  lower  labor  rates  and \nturnover.  \n\nGovernment Policy \n\nWith  the  exception  of  educational  programs  and  incentive  schemes  to  influence  where  firms \nchoose to locate, government policy has not been a major factor at the firm level, either in terms \nof  strategy  or  the  ability  of  firms  to  upgrade  and/or  increase  their  value  added.  The  firms  may \nhave benefited from local government policies to improve software talent and language capability \n(e.g.,  Japanese),  but  the  better  firms  did  not  gain  from  the  central  government\u2019s  policies  of \ntargeting selected firms for benefits.  \n\n2.4  The Philippine IT Services Industry  \n\nThe Philippine Outsourcing Industry: The Role of the Government \n\nThe  Philippine  government,  specifically  the  Board  of  Investments  (which  plays  a  key  role  in \nforeign  investments),  has  focused  on  promoting  five  ITES  sectors:  BPO  (including  engineering \ndesign),  software,  call  centers,  animation,  and  medical  transcription.  By  the  mid-2000s,  there \nwere already a number of hallmark foreign MNEs in each of the sectors, including Accenture for \nsoftware  services;  Sykes,  Convergys,  and  PeopleSupport  for  call  centers;  and  Texaco  and \nAmerican  International  Group  (AIG),  which  had  shared  services  facilities  for  their  internal  BPO \nwork. By 2008, the ITES sectors had an estimated output of US$6.2 billion and employed 430,000 \npeople  (Congressional  Planning  and  Budget  Department  2009).  Most  of  the  ITES  sectors  have \nregistered healthy, if not rapid, growth rates, with BPO as a whole growing 227% between 2004 \nand  2007.  Call  centers  have  been  growing  especially  rapidly,  with  employment  at  many  call \ncenters (including foreign MNEs like Sykes, Convergys, and PeopleSupport) growing by rates of \n100%  or  more  between  the  early  and  mid-2000s.11\n  The  MNE  impact  is  seen  across  all  ITES \nsectors, but it is in call centers, and to an increasing extent, the BPO sector, that it is most keenly \nfelt. The BPO sectors will be examined later in this study. \n\nTo give an idea of the Philippine \u201cpresence\u201d in the ITES sectors, a list of 35 providers worldwide \n(these being ones that the Gartner Group had fielded the most enquiries on from 10,000 of their \nclients)  was  examined.  Ten  of  the  13  call  centers  on  the  list  had  operations  in  the  Philippines, \nwhile three of the 14 BPO providers (some of which had integrated IT and BPO operations) had \noperations in the country. The smaller number of BPO providers operating in the Philippines might \nhave something to do with a large number of them being Indian IT firms, which tend to be India-\nfacing in their growth paths. This also suggests that the type of work that the Philippines is known \nfor  is  mainly  related  to  call  centers,  and  possibly,  that  BPO  providers\u2019  operations  (besides  the \nIndian IT firms\u2019 operations) are more spread out worldwide (Bloomberg Businessweek 2006). \n\n                                                \n11 Call  centers  are  often  set  up  and  operated  by  international  MNEs  that  specialize  in  the  industry,  and  that  have \ncodified  procedures  for  training  and  operations.  The  firms  tend  to  focus  more  on  the  language  skills  and  customer-\nfacing skills of their employees, although some degree of domain knowledge is often involved (especially for technical \nsupport).  As  one  interviewee  pointed  out,  the  view  of  Filipino  skill  advantages  tends  to  be  that  of  language  and \ncustomer-facing  mannerisms,  versus  Indian  software  process  skills.  However,  the  Filipinos  do  not  have  a  complete \nadvantage in language over India since the Philippines is also suffering a shortage of language skill qualified people, \nand since Indian call center operators can be trained for American accents (in order to service American clients). \n\n \n\n12 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nOf the five ITES sectors in the Philippines, most of the significant firms are the foreign MNEs. This \nis particularly true in the BPO, software, and animation outsourcing sectors (with the exception of \nsome  local firms  that  have  established  call  centers  and  BPO  providers,  such  as  Ayala,  SPI, the \nPhilippines Long Distance Telephone Company [that acquired SPI], and SVI  (Software Ventures \nInternational)  Connect).  A  foreign  MNE\u2019s  typical  mode  of  operation  is  to  operate  a  \u201cshared \nservices\u201d  facility  that  centralizes  its  (typically)  back-office  work  in  lower  cost  countries.  For \ninstance, Maersk, the Danish shipping firm, has located some of its shared services operations in \nManila, in addition to other shared services operations in Costa Rica, Mumbai, and Guangzhou.  \n\n2.4.1  Emergence of the BPO Sector: Factors that Influence the Location Behavior of \n\nMNEs \n\nMNEs  have  moved  BPO-related  services  to  the  Philippines  that  span  a  variety  of  corporate \nfunctions,  including  accounting  and  finance  (as  well  as  IT),  some  of  which  were  unique  to  the \nindustry the firm was in, but which also involved the specific general corporate functions of finance \nand  accounting.  The  Philippines  had  been  observed  to  have  a  fairly  broad  educational  system \ncatering to not only the vocational fields, but also to areas such as the liberal arts and business. \nThis  educational  spectrum  does  not  appear  to  have  been  a  disadvantage  for  meeting  the  ITES \nneeds of MNEs and outsourcing providers.  \n\nWhereas  the  PRC\u2019s  software  services  industry  has  largely  been  focused  on  its  own  domestic \nmarket, the Philippines has had to compete with various countries\u2014not the least of which being \nIndia\u2014to  host  MNEs  seeking  a  location  for  shared  services  BPO  facilities.  The  factors \ncontributing to an MNE\u2019s decision have been classified as follows: \n\nCost  and  skill  factors:  A variety of factors appear to influence outsourcing decisions, but while \nthe initial decision to outsource is often made for cost reasons, the actual decision to locate in the \nPhilippines  is  affected  by  a  range  of  location-based  factors,  typically  including  costs,  language \ncapability,  availability  of  skills,  and  infrastructure.  Very  often,  and  especially  recently,  firms \nconduct  an  internal  feasibility  study.  The  way  in  which  the  factors  are  related  (e.g.,  by  ranking) \nand  the manner  in  which  they  are  considered to  interact  vary  from firm  to firm,  but  they  tend to \nrevolve  around  a  desire  to  concentrate  back-office  services  in  a  small  number  of  cheaper \nlocations.  For  example, Procter  and Gamble\u2019s  human resources group  in  Manila  is  one  of three \nshared service centers worldwide (the other two being in Costa Rica and Newcastle, UK).12\n  \n\nOne  large  part  of  the  Philippines\u2019  attractiveness  to  MNEs  is  the  country\u2019s  past  investments  in \nhigher  education  and  the  resulting  surplus  pool  of  labor.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the  case  of \nbusiness  higher  education,  which  is  attractive  to  BPO  firms.  However,  firms  can  hire  human \nresources  from  a  variety  of  other  fields  as  well,  including  IT  and  the  arts,  and  retrain  them  for \nlower-level work. Having said this, the government\u2019s ability to continue this type of investment has \nbeen  severely  limited  by  its  low  resources  as  well  as  the  generally  insufficient  manpower  in  the \ngovernment agencies overseeing the industry. \n\nThe  Importance  of  History:  Looking  at  the  early  MNEs  that  located  in  the  Philippines,  one \ncommon  factor  that  emerges  is  that  an  early  familiarity  with  the  country  helped  to  make  the \ndecision. An example is the case of an MNE with one of the first shared services facilities in the \nPhilippines. The facility manager compared the Philippines with several other Asian countries on a \nvariety of factors, and in the end, a combination of English-speaking skills and trained university \ngraduates  in  the  business  disciplines  mattered  the  most.  However,  the  MNE  itself  had  a  long \ntenure in the Philippines, which helped make the country familiar and accessible to the MNE. In \n\n                                                \n12 However, in 2004, Procter and Gamble took the even more extreme step of selling off these units. The Philippine unit \ncontaining much of the staff that provided employee services support (i.e., human resources services) was sold to IBM \n(with the other units being sold to other firms). \n\n \n\n13 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\ncontrast, a highly competitive country was ruled out because the MNE had had a bad experience \nwith the government\u2019s previous policies.  \n\nSoft  Skills:  Another  important  factor  in  which  the  Philippines  is  typically  considered  to  have  a \nstrong  advantage  in  is  that  of  the  softer  skills,  that  is,  the  cultural  orientation  of  the  human \nresources.  MNE  chiefs  have  pointed  out  that  national  culture  and  the  \u201cservice  mentality\u201d  (as \nreflected  in  how  employees  deal  with  clients)  is  a  positive  aspect  of  the  country.  Another \nbeneficial aspect of the Philippines is that its cultural orientation is similar to that of the US. In fact, \none  software  outsourcing  head  noted  that  even  in  software,  some  clients  would  like  to  see \ncustomer  orientation  addressed  first,  and  only  later  would  focus  on  other  metrics.  A  number  of \nFilipino call center heads noted that they need their employees to provide more customer-friendly \nservice, and that the \u201cWestern\u201d attitude that Filipinos possess can be an advantage in attracting \nwork. Finally, commonalities in language can help attract MNEs doing BPO and call center work. \n\nIt is important to note that the success of the Philippines in these dimensions was due as much to \nother candidate locations being less competitive on one or more factors (e.g., costs, hospitality or \nservice culture, and infrastructure) as it was to the Philippines succeeding on these same factors. \nFurthermore, extenuating circumstances relating to a particular factor, or an unquantifiable factor \nlike country risk, usually determines the location selection outcome. \n\nHedging  Risk:  Finally,  officials  from  other  MNEs  interviewed  in  this  study  and  elsewhere  have \nnoted that part of their strategy is to hedge their political and country risks by locating facilities in \nboth India and the Philippines.  \n\nComparing Factors Dictating Industrial Emergence in the Philippines with those in the PRC \n\nWhat is interesting is the comparison of this set of factors to the ones seen in the PRC case. In \nthe case of the PRC, the industry emerged through MNEs already active in the PRC\u2019s market (or \nones looking to enter) that were interested in working with local providers for their own needs. In \nthe  case  of  the  Philippines,  the  MNE  is  the  central  decision  maker  in  choosing  a  location  from \namong several or more options, and as such, is much more concerned with a variety of country \nlevel factors, including the MNE\u2019s past experience with the country and/or potential location, and \nthe pool of skills. The usual issues of knowledge transfer and even acquisition (which are more of \nan issue if the services provider is a local firm, as is the case in the PRC) are less central. This is \nbecause  MNEs  already  possess  the  knowledge  and  ability  to  transfer  work  and  organizational \ncapability worldwide\u2014something that they do on a regular basis as part of their business. \n\n2.4.2  Domestic Firms in the BPO and Software Sectors \n\nIt is worth pointing out the experience of domestic providers in the Philippines for the contrast that \nit provides to that of the MNE providers. An examination of the Philippine software sector and its \nrelative  weakness  illustrates  a  contrast  with  India\u2019s.  A  combination  of  a  lack  of  skills,  of  strong \nfirms,  and  of  India\u2019s  head  start  makes  it  difficult  for  latecomer  firms  to  succeed.  There  are  a \nnumber of software firms in the Philippines (even hundreds by one estimate), but most are small, \nand  only  a  handful  are  of  reasonable  size  (i.e.,  above  a  hundred  employees).  The  absence  of \nlarge, capable IT firms in the Philippines may be due to a variety of factors, not the least of which \nis  a  problem  of  financing.  According  to  interviews  with  the  president  of  one  larger  software \nservices provider, the ability of the firm to grow has been limited by a lack of financing and its lack \nof competitiveness against already strong competition (i.e., Indian firms). \n\n \n\n14 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n  \n\n \n\n2.5  Comparing the Three Cases \n\nGeneral Discussion \n\nAs  can  be  seen from Table  2  below,  the  two  cases  illustrate two  very  different  paths  of growth, \nand in the case of the PRC, from India\u2019s path.  \n\nTable 2: Summary Comparison of the Two Cases \n\nDimension \nFocus of \nindustry \n\nMarket focus \n\nOrigins of \nindustry \n\nThe PRC \nDomestic firms engaged in software \noutsourcing. \n\nInitially focused on servicing US MNEs in \nthe PRC\u2019s domestic market (and \nJapanese clients). \nDomestic firms started independently and \nwere needed by MNEs to service the \ndomestic market. \n\nFirm-level or \nindustrial growth  \n\nWhat growth \nentails  \n\nRole of the \ngovernment \n\nDifferences with \nIndia \n\nDomestic firms essentially learn from \nMNEs as they grow, and service \nincreasing MNE needs. They aspire to \nleverage this learning in order to do work \nfor clients in the MNE\u2019s foreign markets. \nScaling by creating facilities in other PRC \ncities to absorb labor, and deepening the \ntype of work, scale, and scope (increased \nverticals). \nGovernment policy did not correctly \nidentify the new outsourcing firms so as to \nsupport them. \nThe outsourcing and/or upgrading path \nstarted with the domestic or Japanese \nmarkets. \n\nPhilippines \nMNE call centers and MNE BPO shared services \nfacilities, some local firms\u2019 call centers and BPO \nproviders. \nFocus on global shared services (some regional \nmarkets like N. America or Australia, some \nglobal). \nMNEs\u2019 initial decision to outsource for cost \nreasons. MNEs\u2019 location decisions are complex \nand not straightforward, e.g., some MNEs had \nprior history with the country, which aided \ndecision making. \nMNEs appear to follow one another once a \nmodel is \u201ctested.\u201d \n\nWidening the scope of work (i.e., adding to the \nbusiness functions encompassed, e.g., \naccounting, finance). \n\nTraditionally weak government may have helped \nat the margin. \n\nSome MNEs seek to use the Philippines as a \n\u201csecond source,\u201d while others \u201cprefer\u201d it to India \nfor various reasons. \n\nBPO=business process outsourcing, MNE=multinational enterprise, PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China, US=United States. \n\nThe  PRC  experience  illustrates  how  domestic  firms  can  leverage  the  needs  of  US  MNEs  to \nservice  their  own  (PRC)  market,  or,  in  the  case  of  firms  focusing  on  the  Japanese  market,  to \npursue  another  market  that  appears  more  open  to  firms  from  countries  that  share  common \nlinguistic characteristics. The key issue is learning, as firms appear bent on upgrading themselves \ntechnologically,  and  on  increasing  their  scale  and  complexity  of  work  through  their  interactions \nwith clients. There also appear to be significant variations in the individual PRC firms\u2019 strategies. \nEach firm appeared to be developing a specific niche based on the resources available to it and \nits  unique  collaborative  strategy.  This  suggests  that  specialization  may  provide  a  greater \nadvantage over time.  \n\nThe Philippine case illustrates an MNE-led model that is different from the PRC\u2019s approach, but is \nsimilar to the model of MNEs that have located in India. In particular, it appears that the kind of \nwork  and  shared  services facilities  that  MNEs  are  locating  in  the  Philippines  is  not that  different \nfrom the BPO done in India. However, the decision to locate in the Philippines is quite a complex \none  and  is  not  always  straightforward,  involving  not  only  locational  factors,  like  labor  and \ninfrastructure, but also past \u201chistory.\u201d Once the decision to locate in a particular country is made, \nthe ability to follow through appears not to be a problem for MNEs as they appear very capable of \ntransferring entire areas of work across borders, even from dispersed locations to a new, central \n\n15 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nfacility. The ability of a BPO facility to grow is limited only by the scale of the resources available \nwithin the country. While the facilities themselves tend to grow independently of one another, the \narrival  of  even  a  single  firm  appears  to  provide  a  signaling  effect  to  other  competitors.  The  fact \nthat  the  Philippines  is  already  becoming  known  as  a  site  for  secondary  outsourcing,  or  even \nprimary outsourcing in the case of certain \u201cverticals,\u201d is promising for the country.  \n\nIn the final analysis, it appears that there are multiple types of models, or at least circumstances, \nthat can be considered in the development of an outsourcing industry. In both cases examined in \nthis  study,  the  two  models  leveraged  the  needs  and  objectives  of  the  foreign  MNE,  so  the \ndevelopment  of  the  outsourcing  industry  does  follow  some  previous  models  of  industrialization. \nWhile  this  study  still  reinforces  the  notion  that  locational  or  factor  advantages  are  a  necessary \ncondition  for  outsourcing,  these  are  not  sufficient  in  and  of  themselves  for  explaining  location \ndecisions. Complex decision making, involving specific extenuating circumstances (in the case of \nthe  Philippines)  and  specific  firm  strategies  (in  the  case  of  the  PRC),  were  also  critical  for  the \nsuccess or growth of outsourcing industries. Both cases provide some hope that outsourcing may \nbe a trend that can benefit other latecomer countries. \n\nFinally,  another  aspect  that  can  be  addressed  is  the  role  of  policy.  The  role  of  policy  appears \nmore  basic,  being  restricted  to  education  and  infrastructure,  rather  than  affecting  industrial \nstimulation (unlike what has been said to have occurred during certain countries\u2019 experiences in \nthe \u201cEast Asian Miracle\u201d period of growth. In the software and BPO industries, the governments \nappear  weaker,  either  in  terms  of  initial  (i.e.,  resource  holding)  conditions  (in  the  case  of  the \nPhilippines), or in terms of ability to improve the industry (in the case of the PRC). Strong private \nsector forces and MNE involvement appear to be the common factors in the emerging models of \noutsourcing industry development. \n\nFrom most industry participants\u2019 perspectives, it appears that PRC software firms will continue to \nlag behind Indian ones on scale, processes, and experience for some time to come13\n.  Philippine \nsoftware firms have been doing no better, suggesting that the only way for them to \u201ccatch up\u201d to \nIndia in the near term is through call centers, BPO, and the other ITES sectors. Some of this will \nentail less sophisticated work, and may require the involvement of MNEs. In both the Philippines \nand  the  PRC,  it  appears  that  the  knowledge  that  MNEs  possess  was  an  important  factor  in  the \nBPO  sectors\u2019  success,  suggesting  that  collaboration  with  MNEs,  however  managed,  at  the \nnational or firm level, is an important factor for success. \n\n3.  THE GROWTH AND EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF IT \n\nSERVICES OUTSOURCING \n\nThis  section  will  address  the  economic  implications  of  the  services  outsourcing  industry.  The \nfocus  will  be  on  India,  with  some  collaborating  evidence  from  the  Philippines.  This  is  in  part \nbecause  data  collection  and  studies  have  been  more  widely  done  in  India,  including  some  by \nIndia\u2019s  NASSCOM.  (It  should  be  noted  that  NASSCOM  has  a  strong  advocacy  role,  so  it  may \nhave  a  dual  purpose  in  providing  these  studies.)  India\u2019s  industry  also  has  a  relatively  longer \nhistory,  allowing  the  various  economic  implications  to  be  better  discerned.  In  effect,  despite  the \ntermed  a  services-led \npresence  of  a  manufacturing  sector, \nindustrialization path (Singh 2006). Nevertheless, the trends can be expected to be similar across \ncountries with a significant outsourcing presence.  \n\nIndia\u2019s  model  has  been \n\n                                                \n13 Author\u2019s own interviews (2005) \n\n \n\n16 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\n3.1  The IT Services Industry, Economic Growth, and Linkages within \n\nthe Economy \n\nIn  the  1990s,  the  Indian  IT  services  industry  was  already  registering  a  major  impact  on  the \neconomy,  contributing  to  an  average  growth  of  services  exports  of  15%  per  year  as  compared \nwith 9% per year in the 1980s (Gordon and Gupta 2004). NASSCOM points out that the sector\u2019s \nshare of GDP rose from 1.2% in 1998 to about 6.1% in 2010, and that the share of total exports \nrose from less than 4% in 1998 to almost 26% in 2010 (NASSCOM 2010). Given the sheer size of \nits  recent  year  revenues,  the  economic  implications  of  the  IT  services  industry  in  India  are \nprofound. Even so, at least in the past, and even now in certain quarters, the Indian IT services \nindustry has been criticized for being an \u201cisland\u201d onto itself, both in terms of job creation (localized \nto  the  sector)  and  in  its  (perceived  lack  of)  linkages  to  the  rest  of  the  economy.  The  industry \ncreated  280,000  jobs  in  2000  (NASSCOM  2008),  and  this  was  expected  to  increase  to  2.23 \nmillion  in  2008,  but  this  is  still  considered  small  in  comparison  with  India\u2019s  total  population \n(NASSCOM  2009).  While  the  PRC\u2019s  total  employment  in  outsourcing  was  reported  to  be  1.42 \nmillion in 2009, the data may be misleading, as it possibly includes both the outsourcing of \u201clocal\u201d \nwork and the offshoring work done by both MNEs and domestic providers. At the same time, this \nis  spread  across  8,060  enterprises  (People\u2019s  Daily  2010).  This  gives  a  very  small  average  firm \nsize of about 176 employees per firm. Other data on firms\u2019 market shares show the same pattern, \nwith  the  firms  accounting  for  the  largest  shares  of  the  export  market\u2014Neusoft  (3.1%),  HSoft \n(2.8%),  and  Sinocom  (2.6%)\u2014also  being  on  the  small  side  (Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development 2006). \n\nOne study of India\u2019s services sectors suggests that, as a whole, they have a higher proportion of \nboth  forward  and  backward  linkages  of  a  \u201cgreater  than  average\u201d  linkage  effect  (or  stimuli  on \nupstream  and downstream  production,  respectively)  than  either the manufacturing  or  agriculture \nsectors (Singh 2006).14\n A study of the Philippine BPO sector shows a contrasting picture. Input-\noutput tables show that its forward, backward, and total-linkage indices ranked 138, 178, and 177, \nrespectively, out of 240 sectors, suggesting that the sector is neither a significant buyer of inputs \nnor  a  significant  supplier  of  outputs  within  the  economy  (Magtibay-Ramos,  Estrada,  and  Felipe \n2008).  Specifically,  the  study  found  that  the  BPO  sector  is  a  greater  consumer  of  inputs  than \noutputs,  taking  in  40  sectors\u2019  inputs  (with  banking,  electricity,  and  telecommunications  services \nbeing the most important suppliers), while providing services to only three sectors: the sector of \ntourism  known  as  tour  and  travel  agencies,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  and  banking.  The  two \nstudies  on  the  Philippine  BPO  and  Indian  IT  services  sectors  should  not  be  compared  side  by \nside, given that they are based on different measures and are measuring industries composed of \nvery different sectoral emphases and even stages of growth.  \n\nNASSCOM also estimated that the Indian IT services industry had an output multiplier of nearly \ntwo, by way of its non-wage operating expenses, capital expenditure, and consumption spending \nby its employees, which is on par with most other sectors. In contrast, the simple output multiplier \nof the Philippines\u2019 BPO sector  was 1.63 (Magtibay-Ramos, Estrada, and Felipe 2008), indicating \nthat  a  dollar\u2019s  worth  of  final  demand  in  the  BPO  sector  would  create  1.63  dollars  of  additional \noutput across the economy.\n This may be related to the limited number of sectors that the BPO \nsector  affects  downstream.  Again,  the  different  multipliers  say  as  much  about  the  differences \n\n15\n\n                                                \n14 Specifically,  using  1998\u20131999  data,  Singh  (2006)  shows  that  in  the  case  of  India\u2019s  backward  linkages,  nine  of  13 \nservices activities, versus six of 22 agricultural activities and 28 of 80 industrial activities, had relative backward index \nvalues above one (and eight of the nine services activities considerably exceeded this). He also showed that in the case \nof India\u2019s forward linkages, nine of 13 services activities, versus five of 22 agricultural activities and five of 80 industrial \nactivities, had relative forward linkage index values above one. \n15 This was estimated using the input-output tables for 2000. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nacross both countries\u2019 IT services industries as anything; for instance, that a higher percentage of \nthe Philippines\u2019 IT services workforce than India\u2019s is in call centers.  \n\nThe  same  Philippine  study  also  showed  a  compensation  coefficient  for  the  BPO  sector  of  0.31, \nmeaning  that  31%  of  the  sector\u2019s  inputs  goes  to  wages.  Coupled  with  the  higher  than  average \ncompensation in the sector16\n, this can be expected to translate into a reasonably high impact on \nthe economy by way of disposable income and spending. In fact, it appears obvious that while the \nIndian software sector is high paying, its 2 million strong workforce is not a chief contributor to the \ncountry\u2019s  50  million  strong  middle  class,  though  it  has  certainly  contributed  to  certain  cities\u2019 \nfortunes. \n\nWhen placed in this broader perspective, it does not appear that the IT services sector has any \nmore  impact  than  other  sectors  in  terms  of  linkages,  multipliers,  or  (as  will  be  shown  later) \nemployment. However, the sector has a greater than average (and increasing) impact on growth.  \n\nThe IT Services Industry\u2019s Linkages with Manufacturing \n\nIT  has  perhaps  some  of  the  greatest  remaining  potentials  for  unlocking  productivity  gains, \nincluding  that  for  developing  countries,  and  for  manufacturing.  That  IT  can  benefit  many \nmanufacturing  sectors  should  be  no  surprise,  given  that  many  MNE  manufacturers  of  products, \nincluding  General  Motors,  Huawei,  Samsung,  and  Sanyo,  have  software  arms  in  India.  Indian \nmanufacturing  firms  should  be  able  to  reap  similar  benefits,  particularly  once  they  develop  a \nstrong  internationalization  focus.  Among  the  Indian  manufacturing  sectors,  the  automobile \ncomponents sector recorded US$15.6 billion of sales in 2007, including US$2.8 billion of exports. \nYet,  despite  having  a  thriving  IT  export  sector,  a  study  found  that  in  comparison  with  other \ncountries,  India  continued  to  lag  behind  in  the  domestic  adoption  of  IT,  especially  for  the  small \nand  medium  enterprise  sectors  (NASSCOM  2007a).  The  study  showed  that  multiple  types  of \nproductivity gains could be realized from using IT, ranging from the improvement of manufacturing \nprocesses  to  the  integration  of  firms  with  their  suppliers  and  customers\u2014foreign  and  domestic \nalike.  Specific  business  processes\u2014the  most  critical  ones  being  order  receipt  and  demand \nmanagement, production planning, and order processing\u2014have not been addressed, and basic IT \nsystems, such  as  enterprise  resource  planning, have  not  been  adopted.  Among  the factors that \nimpede IT adoption, the most critical have been the difficulty of justifying IT investments internally, \nand  the  alignment  of  those  investments  with  business  goals.  In  part,  this  is  also  due  to  the \ndifferent levels of preparedness of businesses, with small and medium businesses being the least \nprepared for technological advancements. A similar finding was observed among domestic PRC \nfirms  in  the  early  stages  of  IT-enabling  work  such  as  systems  integration  (Tschang  and  Xue \n2005). The key to successful IT usage in domestic firms is the recognition that different firms are \nat different stages of development, and that, as a consequence, they have a mix of IT capabilities. \nWhen IT firms do take the trouble to understand and customize their operations for their domestic \nclients, as when the Indian firm Infosys combined some services with its banking product Finnacle \n(developed largely for its domestic clients), the results can be quite positive. \n\nAt the same time, IT can certainly benefit many organizations in the domestic sectors, including \ngovernment  and  education.  One  of  the  challenges  faced  by  Indian  IT  firms  trying  to  link  their \nexpertise to domestic needs is the difficulty of reconciling the model most of them have adopted\u2014\na high cost, high profit model that focuses on developing advanced systems\u2014with the domestic \nsectors\u2019  need for  lower cost,  customized  systems. This  has  led  to  difficulties  in recent  years,  as \nwhen the larger, export-oriented firms tried to service local contracts. One of the problems faced \nis that the current export model is predicated on a higher cost of delivery and higher value added, \n\n                                                \n16 In 2005, the average monthly compensation for the BPO sector was US$386, versus the national average of US$165 \n(Magtibay-Ramos, Estrada, and Felipe 2008). \n\n \n\n18 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nwhile the model that best suits local customers is one of higher customization and lower costs.17\n \nThe  result  is  pressure  for  the  firms  engaged  in  both  kinds  of  work  to  provide  a  lower-capability \nworkforce or even a lower quality of work to domestic clients. \n\nIt should be pointed out that not only has the Indian economy yet to realize significant productivity \ngains  from  IT  services,  it  has  also  been  limited  in  its  growth  potential  by  certain  other  industrial \nand service sectors\u2014electricity and transportation being among the most significant (Singh 2006). \nIt  has  also  been  pointed  out  that  growth  in  services  can  be  held  back  by  some  of  the  same \nconstraints  (Srinivasan  2005).  In  the  case  of  India  and  Philippines,  the  removal  of  constraints, \nsuch as the lowering of telecommunications costs, has certainly helped to unleash the potential of \nthe IT services sector. \n\n3.2  Effects on Employment \n\nThe  evidence  suggests  that  the  IT  services  sector\u2019s  output  employment  multiplier  is  positive. \nNASSCOM estimates indirect job creation in India to have been about 6.5 million in 2007 on the \nbasis of 1.6 million IT industry jobs, or a four to one ratio. This includes direct service providers, \nsuch as food catering and transport. The sector has contributed somewhat to India\u2019s rising middle \nclass,  at  least  in  the  cities  with  the  strongest  IT  clusters. 18\n  The  problematic  issue  is  whether \nservices are contributing as much to employment as they are to GDP. Singh (2006) reviewed the \nevidence for employment, which shows that in India, \u201cwhile the share of services in employment \nincreased from 20% in 1970\u201371 to 23.5% in 1999\u20132000, this was much less than the growth of \nthe  services  sector\u2019s  share  of  GDP,  which  was  from  32.1%  in  1970\u201371  to  48.5%  in  2000\u201301. \nGordon and Gupta (2004) note that, while services rose from 42% to 48% of GDP during 1990\u2013\n2000,  the  share  of  services  in  employment  actually  went  down  by  about  one  percentage  point. \nThis  point  suggests  that  while  the  services  sectors  do  provide  a  higher  labor  productivity,  they \ngenerally  do  not  have  the  concomitant  benefits  of  high  employment  effects  that  labor-intensive \nsectors can provide for developing economies (this generally being the case with IT as it is with \nother higher-skilled services sectors).  \n\nOn the other hand, in the case of the Philippines at least, it certainly seems that IT services, such \nas  BPO  and  call  centers,  have  provided  a  valid  alternative  for  reducing  unemployment  and \naddressing  the  underemployment  of  the  higher-skilled  populace.  In  the  Philippines,  the  BPO \nsector\u2019s  share  of  GDP  increased  from  0.075%  in  2000  to  2.4%  in  2005  (Magtibay-Ramos, \nEstrada,  and  Felipe  2008).  Employment  more  or  less  grew  linearly  from  99,300  in  2004,  to \n235,600 in 2006, to 435,000 in 2008 (Congressional Planning and Budget Department 2009). An \nearly  forecast  by  the  Business  Processing  Association  of  the  Philippines  showed  that  if \nemployment  in  the  sector  reached  one  million  workers  in  2010,  it  would  account  for  27%  of  all \nnew  jobs  generated.  In  2006,  call  centers  accounted  for  68%  of  the  BPO  sector\u2019s  total \nemployment, showing that job creation was highly skewed within the various IT services sectors \n(Congressional  Planning  and  Budget  Department  2009),  but  this  was  expected  to  correct  itself \nover  time  as  jobs  in  non-call  center  BPO  activities  were  increasing  at  a  faster  pace  than  call \ncenter jobs (International Labour Organization 2009). \n\nEducation, Employability, and Equity \n\nWhile  there  is  some  evidence  that  services  such  as  IT  services  can  be  a  compelling  source  of \ngrowth  and  exports,  the  evidence  for  employability  is  more  mixed.  There  is  also  significant \n\n                                                \n17 Interestingly, the firm that was most effective at building large-scale systems in India in the past was the former CMC \n(once known as the Computer Maintenance Corporation), which, among other achievements, built the Indian Railways \nautomated  ticketing  system.  CMC  attempted  to  get  into  the  higher-value  export  model  too  late,  and  ended  up  being \nacquired by one of the major software firms. \n18 Based on a conversation with Raja Mitra, independent consultant to the World Bank (4 August 2010). \n\n \n\n19 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nindication  that,  at  least  in  the  1990s  and  just  after,  only  a  relatively  small  proportion  of  Indian \nhigher  education  graduates\u2014namely  those  with  technical  skills  and  English  language  ability\u2014\nwere able to take advantage of the opportunities in the then burgeoning industry (Singh 2006). At \nthe same time, the Indian IT industry has faced a shortfall in labor supply. Some of this shortfall \ncan  be  explained  by  the fact  that the  higher  education  system  can  produce  a  limited  number  of \ngraduates. However, with 10% of Indian youth achieving a college education, a bigger issue is the \nemployability  of  those  graduates  (the  industry  currently  only  finds  one  of  four  graduates \nemployable).  In  the  mid-2000s,  in  the  early  stages  of  growth,  Philippine  call  center  heads  were \nonly choosing the top 10% of college graduates for their positions. This percentage likely went up \nover time as firms became less selective (and as supply failed to keep pace with demand), with a \npossible consequential deterioration in the quality of employees and their work. Another possible \nresult is that the bias toward the \u201cbetter\u201d educated part of the populace will enhance the disparity \nbetween  those  with  stronger  or  better-fitting  educational  backgrounds  and  those  without.  Only \nbroader economic growth will help to ameliorate this diverging trend. \n\n3.3 \n\nImplications for Regional Economic Disparity \n\nHistorically,  the  Indian  IT  industry  has  been  concentrated  in  a  handful  of  urban  locations\u2014a \nfeature  shared  by  all  other  industries.  The  success  of  Bangalore,  Hyderabad  and  other  early  IT \nindustry locations, also contributes to an inequality in incomes amongst cities. The trend however \nhas  also  been  for  firms  to  open  facilities  in  new  locations,  and  72%  of  respondents  to  a  recent \nNASSCOM  survey  reported  having  opened  offshoring  centers  in  the  so-called  \u201csecond-tier\u201d  and \n\u201cthird-tier\u201d cities (NASSCOM  and  Deloitte  2008). As firms  start to  expand  to  second-tier  cities  in \nsearch  of  labor  and  space  to  grow,  the  next  hubs  will  take  shape.  It  appears  that  the  industry \nstarted burgeoning first in Bangalore and then moved quickly into other \u201cfirst-tier\u201d cities like Noida, \nPune,  Hyderabad,  and  Chennai.  However,  judging  from  the  entry  dates  of  firms,  which  were \nbetween \u201cbefore 1980\u201d and 2001, the seven main centers reached their peak in terms of firm entry \nduring the same period: the 1992\u20131999 time frame (Athreye 2005).  \n\nWhile  poverty  is  not  directly  affected  by  industrialization  in  the  IT  services,  equity  is.  One  major \nregional issue related to equity is that of the disparity among regions. As pointed out earlier, firms \ntend  to  locate  in  clusters,  further  advantaging  those  same  clusters  in  the  process  of  doing  so. \nCertainly,  early  clusters  mattered  in  the  Indian  pattern  of  development.  By  2008,  seven  Indian \ncities accounted for 95% of IT services exports (NASSCOM 2009). Recently, an interesting case \nstudy  was  presented  by  NASSCOM  on  one  of  the  poorest  regions  of  India:  Orissa  (NASSCOM \nand Deloitte 2008). As reported by the Software Technology Parks of India authorities, the growth \nrate of of facilities (of enterprises that reported exporting) in Orissa\u2019s state capital of Bhubaneswar \nrose  from  17%  in  1999\u20132000,  to  54%  in  2005\u20132006,  to  69%  in  2006\u20132007.  As  a  result, \nBhubaneswar\u2019s demand for IT manpower was 117,000 in 2007, with 77% of the demand being for \nbachelor degrees (including bachelor equivalents) and master degrees suited to IT. The supply at \nthe time was 54,303. The companies locating in the region included some of the major Indian IT \nfirms  like  Infosys,  Satyam, Tata  Consultancy  Services,  and Wipro,  as  well  as foreign  MNEs  like \nIBM  and  Aricent.  All  of  this  contributed  to  software  exports  from  the  state  of  US$183  million  in \n2006\u20132007, a 60% rise from 2005\u20132006. The growth rate of exports from the state was in sharp \ncontrast to the national average of 28%, reflecting the new and healthy rise of the state\u2019s, and in \nparticular, its capital\u2019s, IT services industry base. It should be noted that while the pattern is very \nencouraging, it also mirrors the tendency for industrialization in early periods to increase faster (or \neven to increase at increasing rates) relative to later periods, as seen with industrial growth at the \ncountry level in India, the PRC, and elsewhere. \n\nGrowth patterns in the Philippine and PRC cases share similarities with India\u2019s experience. In the \nPhilippines,  Manila  developed  first,  and  by  the  mid-2000s,  Cebu  was  already  considered  a \n\n \n\n20 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\npreferred  second  site  for  companies  rapidly  expanding  their  call  centers.  In  2008,  together  with \nthe  government,  the  Business  Processing  Association  of  the  Philippines  listed  10  \u201cnext  wave\u201d \ncities out of 30 candidates that could be developed into hubs. Similarly, in the PRC, the first six \nexport  bases  for  IT  services  were  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Tianjin,  Dalian,  Shenzhen,  and  Xi\u2019an.  The \nPRC  and  Philippine  governments  are  both  attempting  to  broaden  the  opportunities  to  other \nregions, albeit with the addition of strategic growth policies.  \n\nThe Ancillary Benefits of Firms on Infrastructure and Services \n\nIT companies in India and elsewhere tend to collaborate with the city and regional authorities to \nimprove their educational base and public and private infrastructure. For instance, for many years \ntraffic  in  Bangalore  suffered  from  poor  road  infrastructure  and  was  limited  by  the  city\u2019s  older \nairport.  IT  industry  officials  worked  with  city  officials  to  improve  both  of  these,  though  it  can  be \nargued  that  road  infrastructure  has  still  not  caught  up  with  demand.  On  the  education  front,  as \nBangalore did not have a campus of the major engineering university system (the Indian Institutes \nof  Technology),  the  IT  industry  got  behind  a  privately  led  effort  (with  some  state  support)  to \nsponsor a new type of program\u2014the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Bangalore. \n(A  similar  effort  took  place  in  Hyderabad.)  While  IIIT  Bangalore\u2019s  enrollment  and  faculty  size  is \nmodest, the institute plays a significant role in the ecosystem in terms of providing education for \nforeign  MNE  and  local  firms  alike,  cooperative  research  with  firms,  and  contributing  to  the \nclusters\u2019 renown through its educational and research strengths. A similar bridging effect occurred \nbetween industry and educational institutions with the establishment of IIIT-Hyderabad. \n\nInvestment  in  private  infrastructure  tends  not  to  be  an  issue  for  IT  firms  and  states  as  foreign \ninvestors  do  also  get  involved.  For  instance,  the  government-linked  corporations  of  Singapore \nhave  invested  in  and  operate  software  parks  in  Bangalore,  Chennai,  and  elsewhere,  and  in  the \nPRC, many software parks have been created across the country by private investors, including a \nfew  by  the  IT  firms  themselves.  In  addition,  the  same  developmental  phenomenon  that  has \nhappened in Bangalore and other early clusters is also happening in Orissa. While there were few \ndevelopers  before  the  IT  industry\u2019s  boom,  nationally  operating  builders  came  in  to  build  private \ninfrastructure like IT parks and housing projects during that period. One firm, Satyam, contributed \nto the setting up of street lighting and the development of roads.  \n\nFor the most part, IT firms and software parks tend to be isolated and self-contained entities. It is \nin  the  IT  sector\u2019s  multiplier  effects  on  a  variety  of  other  services,  namely,  retail,  entertainment, \neducation, and medical care, that the broader economic impacts of the IT sector are more likely to \nbe felt. \n\n3.4 \n\nIT and Broader-based Development \n\nFinally, it would be remiss to examine the effects of services without considering how the broader \nIT  revolution,  consisting  of  IT  infrastructure  and  applications  of  IT,  might  actually  have  affected \nproductivity  and  the  economy  more  broadly  in  the  most  rural  of  areas.  The  evidence  has  to  be \nlooked  at  on  a  project-by-project  basis,  and  instances  of  best  practices  should  be  closely \nexamined.  Early  studies  pointed  out  the  various  models  by  which  informatization  could  help  the \nrural  economy  (e.g.,  Quibria,  Tschang,  and  Reyes-Macasaquit  [2002]),  and  indeed  certain \nbusinesses  and  the  business  models  involved,  such  as  the  Grameen  Telecom\u2014based  on \nmicroenterprise  and  the  supply  of  basic  functions,  such  as  communications,  to  rural  areas\u2014\nseemed  to  work,  while  others,  such  as  the  telecenter  approach  to  internet-enabling  populations \nand  businesses,  seemed  less  viable  as  far  as  providing  a  business-enabling function  and  value \nproposition  (Telecentre  Magazine  2008).  Some  IT  projects  such  as  the  internet  kiosk  programs \nTARAhaat and Drishtee, faced various constraints, including financing and infrastructure, as well \nas  broader  challenges relating to sustainability  and  scaling  up (Kaushik  and  Singh  2004).  Other \n\n \n\n21 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\ntechnology schemes that \u201ccustomized\u201d technology and its applications, such as various low-cost \nlaptop  or  handheld  computer  projects  and  proposals,  often  did  not  provide  sufficient  business \nimpact to the poorer populace to allow the latter to justify making these purchases. For instance, \nEncore\u2019s  Simputer  computer,  an  early  effort  to  create  a  simple  handheld  computer  with  limited \nfunctions, did not sell well. These products are effectively \u201ctechnology solutions,\u201d and while many \nattempts  to  reach  the  rural  areas  start  with  technology,  many  end  with  the  failure  of  the \ntechnology to compete or be diffused. While this failure might be the result of factors influencing \nadoption, e.g., products ill-fitted to users\u2019 actual needs, another possible cause is a factor at the \neconomic level identified by Quibria et al. (2003): that IT usage is correlated with income. In short, \nincomes  may  have  to  rise  before  IT  usage  can  take  hold  in  the  economy.  Relating  to \n\u201ctechnological  fit\u201d  is  the  interesting  recent  development  of  a  host  of  technology  entrepreneurs \ntrying to supply not simply products, but IT services and solutions to rural areas. These cater to \nneeds  identified  across  a  spectrum  of  areas,  from  applications  like  telemedicine  and  transport \nscheduling,  to  the  need  for  mobile  phones  with  local  language  functionality  and  customized \ninterfaces.  While  the  producers  of  these  are  learning  the  basics  of  the  technology  and  its \napplicability to various situations, there is possibly also a lot of learning to be done on the kinds of \nbusiness models that are suited to these settings. \n\nthe  beginning  of \n\nOther  efforts  have  sought  to  enable  rural  employment  schemes,  such  as  then  Chief  Minister  of \nAndhra  Pradesh  Chandrababu  Naidu\u2019s  schemes  at \nIndia\u2019s  software \nindustrialization,  starting  with  IT-enabling  the  rural  areas.  By  many  accounts,  the  city  with  the \nsecond  most  successful  IT  industry  after  Bangalore\u2019s  was  Andhra  Pradesh\u2019s  state  capital: \nHyderabad.  The  general  thinking  at  the  time  was  that  some  of  the  IT  offshoring  work  could  be \ndone  in  rural  areas,  but  attempts  in  Andhra  Pradesh  failed.  As  one  observation  had  it:  the \n\u201cdiversity  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  with  nearly  two  thirds  of  the  population  of  the  state  depending  on \nagriculture for  its  existence,  excludes the  possibility  of  diverse  poor  and  rural  social groups  with \ndifferent levels of skills, access, and education being able to benefit equally from these\u2026sectors\u201d \n(Dabla  2004).  Furthermore,  the  state\u2019s  focus  on  foreign  investment  and  offshoring  facilities \n(resulting  in,  for  example,  the  attraction  of  Microsoft  to  Hyderabad)  and  a  host  of  other  reasons \nmight  also  have  dictated  against  the  work  moving  to  rural  areas.  First  and  foremost  of  the \nunderlying reasons might have been the set-up cost for firms and the firms\u2019 ability to govern their \noperations.  Generally,  large  firms  need  to  create  centers  of  some  critical  mass,  which,  in  turn, \nrequire infrastructure of some critical mass. Given the need for quality assurance, and increasing \nsecurity concerns, these work dictate against the earlier hopes of development advocates of the \nwork being offshorable to literally any location. \n\nMore recently, local IT entrepreneurs have turned their attention to determining what they can do \nto supply rural areas with technologies specifically customized to their needs. Dr. Sridhar Mittar, a \nformer chief technology officer of Wipro and chief executive officer of an incubator, started such a \nprogram:  NextWealth  Entrepreneurs,  a  social  entrepreneurship  program  that  tries  to  enable \nentrepreneurs  and  create  jobs  in  the  rural  economy.  The  company  plans  to  open  40  centers  in \nthree years to employ 10,000 graduates near their (rural) homes.19\n In order to do this, it still has to \nselect  which  rural  cities  to  help.  Typically,  cites  are  selected  for  this  program  based  on  the \navailability  of  graduates  from  established  engineering  colleges  in  those  cities,  as  well  as  the \navailable infrastructure. \n\n                                                \n19 Author\u2019s interview with S.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe  author  has  sought  to  accomplish  two  objectives  in  this  paper.  The  first  was  to  highlight  the \ndifferences  and  similarities  between  three  countries\u2019  services  development  models:  India,  the \nPRC, and the Philippines. The contrast between the experiences in each country highlights subtle \nand  important  differences,  particularly  with  regard  to  latecomer  countries. The  PRC  case shows \nthat it is conceivable to have a successful latecomer in the software industry, a field in which India \nhas built a commanding lead in both technical and process capability at the firm level. However, \nPRC firms have done this  both in cooperation with foreign MNEs  to service the PRC\u2019s  domestic \nmarket,  and  also  independently  by  working  in  Japan,  a  culturally  similar  market.  The  Philippine \ncase  shows  that  a  latecomer  can  flourish  by  bringing  in  MNEs  as  providers\u2014following  a  pure \nlabor arbitrage model of operation (i.e. based on large suppliers of lower-wage but skilled labor), \nand  with  the  additional  advantages  of  similarities  between  the  workforce\u2019s  native  language  and \nthe  clients\u2019  language  of  work.  In  this  model,  one  option  for  domestic  firms  looking  to  enter  the \nindustry is to emphasize lower-skilled work at lower wages than the competitors\u2019 wages. \n\nThe second objective was to illustrate the broader implications of the IT services (i.e., outsourcing \nor offshoring) industry. As can be seen from combining the case-level and higher-level evidence \nfor India, the sector\u2019s contribution to overall GDP and exports can be considerable over time. The \nmultiplier  effects  on  output  and  employment  are  not  unlike  those  of  other  sectors.  In  a  large, \nrapidly  expanding  economy  like  India\u2019s,  the  industry\u2019s  effects  on  employment  may  be  less \nsignificant than its effects on growth. However, due to the high value added and higher wages (on \naverage),  the  effects  on  the  economy  are  greater  when  considered  on  a  per-person  basis.  In \naddition,  while  the  benefits  of  direct  employment  will  tend  to  go  to  the  highly  educated,  the \nindustry  can  still  benefit  from  the  creation  of  a  vibrant  middle  class,  at  least  in  selected  cities \nwhere  the  IT  industry  had  a  good  start.  Through  natural  evolution  and  policy  assistance,  these \nbenefits  can  also  be  brought  to  other,  secondary  cities.  Finally,  the  IT  sector  has  the  potential \n(and indeed, may be necessary) for cultivating productivity increases in domestic sectors (such as \nmanufacturing)  and  in  technologically  sophisticated  firms.  However,  as  the  case  of  India \ndemonstrates,  the  usage  of  IT  to  improve  productivity  in  other  sectors  of  the  economy,  such  as \nmanufacturing, as well as the rural parts of economies, still has a long way to go. \n\n \n\n23 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAmsden, A. 1989.

Furthermore,  given  that  the  particular \nnature of the markets and business environments in each of the countries appear to have shaped \ntheir  industries, the  study  also  aimed  to  develop  a  view  of macro  level  factors. To some  extent, \nsecondary data and literature was relied upon for providing this macro perspective.  \n\nThe  approach  to  studying  competencies  at  the  firm  level  was  a  longitudinal  study  based  on \nmultiple field visits to different firms in the PRC and the Philippines. In addition, comparisons were \ndrawn with India based on earlier fieldwork in that country. To understand the specific differences \nthat  enabled  each  industry\u2019s  growth,  each  country\u2019s  industry  was  examined  in  terms  of  the \ncomposition of its firms\u2019 origins and growth path. This approach involved the systematic collection \nof  data  using  a  set  of  semi-structured  and  open-ended  questions  about:  (i)  the  origins  of  firms \n(particularly  some  of the  earliest  and most  successful firms  by  the  time of the  interview);  (ii)  the \nnature of the markets; (iii) barriers to firms; (iv) interactions with the market and clients; and (v) the \nupgrading  path  for  the  firm  (i.e.,  the  knowledge  and  capabilities  acquired  as  the  firm  matures). \nInformation  on  basic  factors  such  as  skills,  policy,  and,  in  the  case  of  the  Philippines, \ninfrastructure and language capabilities, were also sought.  \n\nTable 3 shows the dates of visits and the interviews conducted. Each interview was between one \nand  two  hours  in  length.  The  interviews  in  the  PRC  were  conducted  with  either  a  head  of  the \ncompany  (usually  the  chief  executive  officer)  or  a  key  person  in  management  (e.g.,  a  head  of \nmarketing or business development). Interviews in the Philippines were almost all conducted with \nthe  heads  of  the  facilities.  All  of  the  interviews  were  transcribed  on  the  spot,  and  all  of  the  key \nBPO interviews were taped for later review and possible additions to the transcriptions. (Note that \nthe  names  of  all  the  firms  interviewed  were  changed  to  names  that  are  partly  descriptive  of  the \nindustries they are in.) \n\n \n\n27 \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 313                                                                                                                     Tschang \n\nTable A1: Interview Samples for PRC Software and Philippine BPO Cases \n\nCountry \n\nPRC \n\nInterview  Dates \n(approximate) \nEarly 2001 \n\nNo. and Type of Firms Interviewed  \n\nNovember 2004  2  domestic  outsourcing  firms  (B-soft  and  United \n\n29  domestic  software  firms  (6  in  outsourcing  [mostly \nsmaller  firms],  all  different  from  those  approached  on \nsucceeding visits) \n\nInnovation), subsumed into third interview sample \n3 domestic outsourcing firms (B-soft, W-soft, I-soft)** \n12  firms  (5  domestic  and  7  MNE  [mainly  call  centers \nand animation firms], as well as 2 software firms and 1 \nMNE BPO facility) \n5  firms  (all  MNE  BPO  shared  services  facilities, \ndifferent from first set of firms) \n27 firms (all but 1 performing software outsourcing [19 \ndomestic  and  8  MNE]). 2009  update  involved  about  6 \nalready  interviewed  firms  and  4  new  ones,  all  in \nsoftware and R&D services. \n\nPhilippines \n\nMay 2006 \nJune 2004 \n\nJuly 2005 \n\nIndia* \n\n2001 \n1999, \n(updated 2009)  \n\nBPO=business process outsourcing, MNE=multinational enterprise, PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China, R&D=research and \ndevelopment. \n\n*  \n\nIncluded here only for comparison purposes (first visits predated the other two cases). \n\nAdditional interview material from a government interviewer was also made available on several PRC firms \n\nNote: the interview list does not include representatives of governments and software bodies (e.g., associations), which were \napproached in each country. \n\n**  \noutsourcing to Japan. \n\nSource: Author \n\n28 \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["F.

Being latecomers to offshoring work, the \nPRC  and  the  Philippines  have  developed  this  industry  in  cooperation  with  multinational \nenterprises (MNEs). PRC firms have worked with and upgraded within MNEs\u2019 value chains \nwithin  the  PRC  market,  while  the  Philippines  has  relied  on  MNEs  to  come  in  and  set  up \nfacilities,  with  domestic  firms  setting  up  facilities  where  lower  (knowledge)  barriers  to  entry \nprevail.  The  paper  also explores  the  ITES  industries\u2019  implications for  economic growth  and \npoverty  reduction.  ITES  industries  can  contribute  to  overall  economic  growth  and  exports, \nbut due to their small size, will generally tend to have more observable impacts on the cities \nin  which  they  are  located.  From  the  limited  case  data  available,  it  appears  that  the  ITES \nindustries  impact  on  overall  employment  and  other  economic  sectors  to  varying  degrees, \nrelative  to  other  sectors.  As  these  industries  do  not  help  the  more  impoverished  or  less \neducated, they cannot be said to be a solution for the less employable or impoverished, let \nalone to the problem of rural poverty. \n", "JEL Classification: L52, L86, O14 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n"]}
