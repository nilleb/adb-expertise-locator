INTRODUCTION \n\nOh and Kim \n\nToday,  the  majority  of  countries  are  reducing  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nefficiently,  following  the  Paris  Agreement,  by  making  more  room  for  nuclear  and \nrenewable  forms  of  energy,  which  produce  little  carbon  dioxide  (Kim  2017).  The \nRepublic  of  Korea  is  the  13th  largest  country  in  economy  size,  while  it  is  9th  in \npetroleum  consumption  and  8th  in  electricity  consumption  in  the  world,  as  of  2014 \n(Greenhouse  Gas  Inventory  &  Research  Center  of  Korea  [GIR]  2017;  Korea  Energy \nAgency [KEA] 2017).  \n\nThe Republic of Korea has pursued full-scale green growth since 2008. Green finance \nnewly  emerged  in  2009,  and  the  development  of  related  policies  has  involved \ndiscussions  on  how  to  finance  green  growth  as  well  as  green  industry.  As  green \nfinance  policies,  the  Republic  of  Korea  introduced  the  environmental  information \ndisclosure  system  and  the  emission  trading  scheme  (ETS)  in  2013  and  2015, \nrespectively. The environmental information disclosure system aims to disclose mainly \ncorporate  environmental  performance  to  the  public  and  to  enable  the  public  and \ninvestors  to  understand,  assess,  and  invest  selectively  for  effectiveness  as  well  as \nefficiency. The government introduced the ETS with the purpose of effectively reducing \nthe  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  of  companies  through  the  capital  market \nmechanism. In the capital market, it launched the Korea stewardship code to boost the \nresponsible  investment  of  institutional  investors  in  2016,  and  it  anticipates  that  it  will \ncontribute  to  the  effective  GHG  reduction  of  companies  through  the  engagement \nactivities of institutional investors (UN Environment 2017).  \n\nNowadays,  the  expansion  of  renewable  energy  and  nuclear-free  electric  power \ngeneration is the subject of debate in the Republic of Korea. The government decided \nto  increase  its  renewable  energy  and  not  to  increase  the  nuclear  power  generation \nfurther  (Public  Opinion  Committee  on  Shin-Gori  Unit  5&6  2017),  as  the  public \nacceptance of nuclear electricity generation is dropping steadily because of its recent \nsafety issues (Lee and Lee 2017), and it will make efforts to accomplish the 20% share \nof  renewable  energy  in  the  total  electricity  generation  in  2030.  However,  the \ngovernment  decided  that  the  nuclear  power  generation  facility  under  construction \nwould be completed on schedule because of its high sunk cost. The safety problem is \ncrucial  in  determining  the  expansion  of  nuclear  power  generation,  though  nuclear \nenergy is particularly advantageous in the reduction of carbon dioxide: carbon dioxide \nemissions  per  capita  decrease  by  0.26\u20130.32%  as  the  share  of  nuclear  generation \nincreases  by  1%,  and  the  social  benefit  from  one  nuclear  generation  facility  is \nestimated to be KRW 13~20 trillion (Lee and Lee 2016). \n\nAnother  major  concern  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  is  fine  and  ultra-fine  dusts.  As  their \nconcentrations continue to increase and the Republic of Korea records the worst ultra-\nfine dust among the OECD countries (OECD 2017), the government produced its fine \nand  ultra-fine  dust  reduction  plan  (Korean  Government,  2016a,  2016b).  One  of  the \ncritical sources is coal-fueled thermal generation facilities: dust that occurs in firing the \ncoal  covers  the  whole  territory,  worsening  the  atmosphere  (Korean  Government \n2016a).  The  social  consensus  is  that  the  government  should  diminish  the  use  of  the \ncriticized coal-fueled thermal generation. However, coal accounts for the largest portion \namong the power generation sources in the Republic of Korea now, so the government \nis  considering  renewable  energy  sources  as  alternatives  to  coal  and  has  suggested \nfuel  conversion  from  coal  to  cleaner  sources.  In  sum,  it  is  necessary  to  develop \ntechnology  that  can  decouple  the  energy  consumption  and  fine  dust  occurrence  \nfrom  the  mid-  to  short-term  perspective  and  convert  the  production  system  from  the \n\n1 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nlong-term  perspective  (Lee  and  Lee  2017).  In  addition,  Korean  people  need  to  be \nenergy  efficient  by  strengthening  personal  norms,  such  as  moral  obligation  and \nattitudes toward environmental/climate change issues, which have a positive impact on \nefficient energy use (Kim 2016a). \n\nIn this context, this study will identify the green growth and green finance policies at the \ncountry  level  and  provide  an  understanding  of  the  role  of  green  finance  to  support  \nlow-carbon green growth along with GHG emission reduction.  \n\n2.  NATIONAL PLAN TO PREPARE  \n\nFOR CLIMATE CHANGE \n\nThe government has tried to prepare for climate change since 1998. It first established \na  master  plan  to  prepare  the  climate  change  agreement  in  1998  for  the  period  from \n1999 to 2001, and most recently it provided the third plan effective for the period from \n2005  to  2007  (KEA  2017).  The  three  plans  focused  on  constructing  the  infrastructure \nfor  GHG  emission  reduction,  and  then  the  master  plan,  aiming  to  prepare  for  climate \nchange,  substituted  them  with  the  five-year  term  2008  to  2012  (Korean  Government \n2016c).  It  first  released  the  five-year  green  growth  plan  in  2009  as  an  efficient  and \nsystematic approach to the national green growth strategy, and it provided the second \nplan in 2014. The plan developed most recently is the first climate change preparation \nmaster plan, publicly announced in December 2016.  \n\n2.1  Second Five-Year Green Growth Plan  \n\n(Office of Government Policy Coordination [OGPC] 2014) \n\nThe  first  plan  focused  on  the  systemization  of  green  growth:  it  provided  laws  and \npolicies  such  as  the  Framework  Act  on  Low-Carbon  Green  Growth,  Smart  Grid  Act, \nGreen  Building  Act,  Emission  Trading  Act,  the  plan  for  climate  change  preparation,  \nand  the  master  plan  for  sustainable  development,  established  the  Green  Growth \nCommittee  in  the  government  in  2009  to  push  the  governmental  driving  system  for \ngreen  growth,  executed  the  renewables  portfolio  standard  (RPS)  since  2012,  and \nintroduced  GHG  and  energy  target  management  in  2010.  The  reduction  of  GHG \nemissions  in  companies  under  the  GHG  and  energy  target  management  scheme \nexceeded the target for GHG emission reduction (Ministry of Environment [MoE] 2014). \nHowever,  it  showed  limitations  to  sound  performance  improvement  for  three  reasons: \n1)  the  increasing  trend  of  GHG  emissions  and  the  inactivation  of  green  industry,  \n2)  government-led  and  supply-centered  policies,  and  3)  the  shortage  of  stakeholder \ncommunication and consideration of social equality.  \n\nThe  second  plan  aimed  to  supplement  the  first  plan  and  to  settle  the  low-carbon \neconomic  and  social  structure  under  the  motto  of  inclusive  green  growth,  with  \nfive  policy  directions  for  effective  greenhouse  gas  reduction,  the  construction  of  \na  sustainable  energy  system,  the  establishment  of  a  green  prosperous  industry \necosystem,  the  embodiment  of  a  sustainable  green  society,  and  the  reinforcement  of \nglobal green collaboration.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nFor  effective  greenhouse  gas  reduction,  the  government  set  up  an  industrial  GHG \nreduction  rate  and  provided  specific  goals  for  GHG  reduction  amounts  for  industries \nsuch as steelmaking, cement manufacturing, petrochemistry, electrics and electronics, \nand  electronic  display  apparatus,  as  shown  in  Table  1  below;  as  steelmaking  and \npetrochemistry  industries  with  high  energy  consumption  introduced  or  increased  their \nfacilities, the energy efficiency worsened (Kim, Lim, and Kim 2015). \n\nTable 1: Principal Industrial Goals of GHG Reduction \n\nContent \nIndustrial GHG Reduction Rate compared \nwith Business as Usual (BAU) (in %) \n\nGHG reduction \namount \n(in thousand \ntCO2e) \n\nSteelmaking \nCement \nPetrochemistry \nElectrics and electronics \nElectronic display \napparatus \n\nSource: OGPC (2014). \n\nGoals per Annum \n2016 \n\n2015 \n\n2017 \n\n7.9 \n2,383 \n2,383 \n1,543 \n12,808 \n7,500 \n\n9.7 \n3,313 \n3,313 \n2,010 \n15,194 \n9,986 \n\n11.6 \n4,264 \n4,264 \n2,628 \n17,595 \n13,125 \n\n2014 \n\n1.7 \n\n206 \n206 \n408 \n2,356 \n1,409 \n\n2018 \n\n13.7 \n5,282 \n5,282 \n3,246 \n20,103 \n17,120 \n\nThe  government  planned  to  reduce  the  GHG  emissions  in  the  transportation  sector  \nby  constructing  a  low-carbon  green  logistics  system,  reinforcing  the  manufacturing  \nand  consumption  of  high-efficiency  and \nimproving  public \ntransportation, and enhancing power-free and carbon-free vehicle usage. \n\nlow-carbon  vehicles, \n\nThe  government  has  made  efforts  to  expand  the  distributed  power  by  inducing  \nthe  installment  of  private  electric  generators  in  industrial  complexes,  expanding  the \ncommunity  energy  supply,  and  diffusing  distributed  renewable  energies,  as  the \nnecessity  for  decentralized  electricity  power  sources  is  becoming  significant  for  \neco-friendly generation as well as the local acceptance of generation and transmission \nfacilities (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 2014, 2015; Park and Jung 2016), and \nestimates  indicate  that  distributed  power  will  account  for  at  least  a  15%  share  of  the \ntotal energy in the Republic of Korea, an increase from a 5% share in 2014, which will \nbe  able  to  offset  up  to  50  million  toe,  10%  of  the  annual  aggregated  emission \nallowance.  The  government  supports  energy  investment  of  which  the  energy-saving \neffect  turns  out  to  be  at  least  5%  in  the  energy  examination  of  an  energy-saving \ncompany (ESCO) project. \n\nAs  the  heavy  energy-consuming  economic  structure  is  continuing  despite  the \ngovernmental  efforts,  the  Republic of  Korea  needs  a  sustainable  energy  system.  The \nintention of the second plan was to expand the dissemination of renewable energy to \n11%  in  2035  from  3.18%  in  2012,  considering  the  energy  safety,  GHG  emission \nreduction,  and  so  on;  however,  the  current  government  declared  that  the  share  of \nrenewable energy will be 20% in 2030 (OGPC 2017).  \n\nThe  government  introduced  new  policies,  such  as  the  RPS  in  the  utility  sector,  the \nrenewable heat obligation (RHO) in the building construction field, and the renewable \nfuel standard (RFS) in the transportation sector in 2012, 2015, and 2016, respectively, \nin  accordance  with  the  second  plan.  For  the  dissemination  of  renewable  energy,  \nthe  government  will  reform  its  support  policy  and  expand  its  investment.  It  will  \nreform  the  previous  subsidy  support  policy  to  incentivize  support  proportional  to  the \namount  of  energy  generation.  It  will  expand  its  financial  support  to  technology \n\n3 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\ncommercialization related to energy or renewables as implemented only for production, \nfacilities, and operation.  \n\n2.2  Climate Change Preparation Master Plan  \n\n(Korean Government 2016c) \n\nthe \n\nlevel  of \n\nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change\u2019s \n\nIn  June  2015,  the  Republic  of  Korea  submitted  the  intended  national  determined \ncontributions  (INDCs)  to  the  United  Nations;  Table  2  below  illustrates  the  GHG \nemission  reduction  goal  of  a  37%  reduction  compared  with  the  BAU  in  2030  and  the \nGHG  emission  reduction  goals  of  principal  areas  (Korean  Government  2015).  The \nRepublic  of  Korea  first  set  its  national  GHG  emission  reduction  goal  to  reduce  GHG \nemissions by 30% compared with the BAU in 2020 in November 2009, which was the \nhighest \n(IPCC) \nrecommendation for developing countries and represented an expression of strong will \nregarding GHG emission reduction. Therefore, some argued that it had violated the \u201cno \nbacksliding\u201d  principle  for  the  reduction  goal:  the  Republic  of  Korea  had  originally \nplanned to reduce its emissions by 30% compared with the BAU by 2020 in its national \nmaster plan in 2014; moreover, it used the BAU that most developing countries utilize \nin  setting  the  reduction  goal.  Most  developed  countries  set  it  in  comparison  with  the \nbaseline  (Choi  2015;  National  Assembly  Research  Service  2017).  The  INDCs  of  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  are  very  ambitious  when  applying  share  indicators,  such  as  the \nshare of cumulative emissions or the share of the GDP, while they are less ambitious \nwhen applying comparative indicators, such as the per capita emissions relative to the \nworld average (Oh 2016). \n\nTable 2: GHG Emission Reduction Goals of Principal Areas \n\nArea \n\nReduction (in Million tCO2e) \n\nUtility \nIndustry \nBuilding \nNew energy industry \nTransportation \nPublic and others \nWaste \nAgriculture and cattle \nDomestic reduction \nForeign reduction \n\nSource: Korean Government (2015). \n\nReduction Rate (%) \n7.6 \n6.6 \n4.2 \n3.3 \n3 \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.1 \n25.7 \n11.3 \n\nOn  3  November  2016,  the  national  assembly  passed  the  proposal  to  ratify  the  Paris \nAgreement,  which  the  COP21  meeting  had  adopted  in  December  2015,  and  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  became  the  97th  country  to  ratify  the  Paris  Agreement  on  \n3 December 2016.  \n\nIn this context, the government established the first climate change preparation master \nplan for the next 20 years, 2017~2036, in December 2016 according to the Framework \nAct on Low-Carbon Green Growth. It suggests the mid- to long-term vision as well as \nthe  policy  direction  to  prepare  for  climate  change  effectively  and  to  convert  the \neconomic  structure  from  heavy  energy  exhaustion  to  a  low-carbon  system  at  the \n\n64.5 \n56.4 \n35.8 \n28.2 \n25.9 \n3.6 \n3.6 \n1 \n219 \n96 \n\n4 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\ncountry  level,  providing  for  a  new  climate  change  regime  to  function  positively  in  the \neconomy. As companies view the preparation for climate change as a burden and just \ncomply  passively  with  the  government\u2019s  policies,  the  government  will  make  efforts  to \nsupport  the  development  of  new  technologies  as  well  as  new  industries  intensively \nenough  for  companies  to  utilize  them  as  opportunities  for  market  leadership.  It  will \npromote the realization of a low-carbon society by inducing companies to develop and \ninvest in technologies through mid- to long-term policies for climate change preparation \nand expand the public participation.  \n\nTo achieve the national GHG reduction goal, a 37% reduction compared with the BAU \nin 2030, the master plan includes an action plan roadmap to accomplish the goal at the \ncountry level and to transit to the low-carbon policy: it raised the RPS duty rate to 7% in \n2020, and the governmental support will lie in the dissemination of renewable energy; it \nwill financially support renewable energy facilities by lowering the loan interest rate; it \nwill  promote  eco-friendly  fuel usage by  reinforcing  the  duty  rate  of  the  renewable  fuel \nmix  to  3.0%  in  2020  in  the  RFS;  and  it  will  promote  the  megawatt  market  in  which \nconsumers can sell their saved electric power to induce voluntary energy saving. \n\n3.  ENERGY MIX IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA \n\nThe  total  primary  energy  supply  (TPES)  has  increased  steadily  since  1981,  though  it \ndecreased in 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, reaching 285,478 thousand toe in \n2015, about 6.3 times the amount in 1981 (see Figure 1). In addition, the ratio of the \nTPES to the gross domestic product (GDP) has been decreasing since 1997, because \nthe  increase  rate  of  the  GDP  is  greater  than  that  of  the  TPES.  In  addition,  estimates \nshow that a 1% increase in energy consumption will increase the economic growth by \n0.093\u20130.104%  in  East  Asian  countries,  so  a  reduction  in  energy  consumption  may \nharm the economic growth (Kim 2015b). \n\nFigure 1: TPES in the Republic of Korea since 1981 \n\nData source: Korea Energy Economics Institute (KEEI) (2017). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nPetroleum  and  coal  account  for  the  largest  and  the  second-largest  share  in  the \ncomposition of energy sources in the Republic of Korea, though the share of petroleum \nis decreasing. The share of petroleum recorded a historical maximum of 62.9% in 1994 \nand  then  fell  to  38.1%  in  2015,  probably  due  to  its  high  price.  The  share  of  coal  has \nexpanded since 1994 and reached 29.7% in 2015, while it was 39.1% at its maximum \nin 1985. As Figure 2 shows, the share of coal decreased as nuclear power generation \nbecame  more  available  in  the  1980s.  Liquid  natural  gas  (LNG)  first  appeared  as  an \nenergy  source  in  1987,  and  its  share  grew  steadily  to  15.2%  in  2015.  The  share  of \nnuclear  energy  increased  from  1.36%  in  1981  to  12.1%  in  2015,  with  a  maximum  of \n16.1%  in  2005.  As  the  government  makes  efforts  to  reduce  the  share  of  coal  and \npromote the use of renewables, it anticipates that the use of coal as an energy source \nwill decline and renewable energy will experience a sudden rise. The government will \nnot  add  further  coal-fueled  thermal  generating  facilities  and  will  convert  the  existing \ncoal-fueled thermal generating facilities into LNG or other eco-friendlier fuels.  \n\nFigure 2: Shares of Energy Sources \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\n \n\nThis  study  investigated  the  energy  consumption  in  four  sectors:  industry,  residential \nand  commercial,  transportation,  and  public.  Industry  has  consumed  the  most  energy \namong  the  four  sectors  historically,  and  the  transportation  sector  and  the  residential \nand  commercial  sector  have  historically  shown  similar  energy  consumption  amounts. \nIndustry  has  experienced  rapid  growth  in  energy  consumption  due  to  the  growth  of \nenergy-intensive  industries,  such  as  steelmaking  and  petrochemistry  (International \nEnergy  Agency  2013).  In  2015,  the  energy  consumed  in  the  transportation  sector \namounted  to  40.3  million  toe  and  that  in  the  residential  and  commercial  sector  to  \n36.4  million  toe.  Since  2014,  transportation  has  consumed  more  energy  than  the \nresidential  and  commercial  area.  Petroleum  has  been  consumed  most  among  the \nenergy  sources  over  all  the  sectors  since  2001,  though  its  share  has  been \nchronologically decreasing as electric or hybrid vehicles have been disseminated. The \nshare  of  the  residential  and  commercial  area  has  declined  recently,  as  its  price  has \nbeen  so  high  that  people  have  selectively  consumed  other  cheaper  sources,  such  as \nelectricity or city gas. The share of petroleum in the transportation sector will diminish \nwith the positive diffusion of electric or hybrid vehicles after all.  \n\n6 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nFigure 3: Energy Consumption in Four Areas \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\nThe  production  amounts  of  new  and  renewable  energy  have  been  increasing \ncontinuously  so  far,  and  the  production  amount  of  renewable  energy  is  much  larger \nthan that of new energy (see Figure 4 below).1  \n\nFigure 4: New and Renewable Energy Production \n\n \n\n \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\n                                                 \n1   Renewable  energy  includes  solar  thermal,  solar  photovoltaic,  wind  power,  hydro  power,  which  has \nincluded  large-hydro  (larger  than  10  MW)  since  2003  and  excludes  pumped-storage  (hydro),  ocean, \ngeothermal, bio, which consists of bio gas, landfill gas (LFG), bio diesel, wood chips and pellets, wood \nbriquettes,  fire  wood,  waste  wood,  black  liquor,  sewage  solid  fuel,  bio-solid  refuse  fuel  (SRF),  bio \nbunkers,  and  waste,  which  includes  waste  gas,  industrial  waste,  living  waste,  municipal  solid  waste, \ncement kiln fuel, refuse-derived fuel (RDF)/refuse plastic  and paper fuel (RPF)/tire-derived fuel (TDF), \nSRF, refinery fuel oil, and  wood  waste, by energy source,  and new energy includes fuel cells and the \nintegrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) (KEEI 2017). \n\n7 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nAmong the renewable energy sources, waste took the largest share of 64.6% in 2015, \nfollowed by bio resources, and recorded 78% in 2008 as its maximum. Bio resources \nincreased to 24.9% in 2014. The share of hydro power shrank from 23.6% in 2004 to \n3.5% in 2015, because a hydro generating facility had not been developed and other \nrenewably  sourced  facilities  were  increasing.  Solar  photovoltaic  power  is  increasingly \nbeing adopted in both industry and houses.  \n\nFigure 5: Chronological Shares in Renewable Energy \n(%) \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\n \n\nIn  particular,  the  local  autonomous  bodies  and  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  central \ngovernment  offer  subsidies  for  installing  small  photovoltaic  generation  apparatus  in \nhomes.  Hydro  thermal,  ocean,  wind  power,  solar  thermal,  and  geothermal  power  do  \nnot  have  meaningful  shares  now,  though  the  adoption  of  geothermal  power  has  \nbeen increasing.  \n\nAs far as the electricity mix is concerned, the three major electricity sources are coal, \nLNG, and nuclear. Their shares in 2013 were 38.8, 24.7, and 26.8%, respectively. The \nshare  of  coal  has  increased  since  1998  to  over  30%  and  recorded  a  maximum  of \n44.6% in 2009. The share of nuclear reached its maximum of 53.1% in 1987 and then \ngradually  declined  to  26.8%  because  of  the  expansion  of  the  consumption  of  other \nsources,  such  as  coal,  LNG,  and  others.  Research  results  imply  a  31.1%  share  of \nnuclear generation in 2035 on the basis of economic costs (Cho and Park 2015). LNG \nas an alternative to coal is consumed more than ever. Its electricity generation amount \nhas increased ever since 1981. Alternative energy and district energy have shares of \n2.8%  and  2.2%,  respectively.  Incidentally,  the  share  of  hydro  electricity  generation \ngradually decreased from 6.7 to 1.7% in 2013.  \n\nPrimary  metal  and  petroleum  coal  product  manufacturing  are  inefficient  sectors \nregarding electricity, so they have the lowest electricity performance index among the \nsectors (Ku, Ju, and Jeong 2016). \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nFigure 6: Electricity Generation by Source \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\n \n\nTable 3: Electricity Generation by New and Renewable Energy \n(Unit: MWh) \n\nYear \n\n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n\nTotal \n4,533,603 \n3,950,000 \n3,899,368 \n4,394,830 \n4,227,477 \n4,617,886 \n5,889,553 \n17,345,647 \n19,498,064 \n21,437,822 \n26,882,190 \n37,078,863 \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\nRenewable Energy \n4,533,603 \n3,947,897 \n3,892,687 \n4,386,308 \n4,207,167 \n4,528,616 \n5,692,594 \n17,051,026 \n19,108,400 \n20,859,244 \n25,939,134 \n35,983,514 \n\nNew Energy \n\n\u2013 \n2,103 \n6,681 \n8,522 \n20,310 \n89,270 \n196,960 \n294,621 \n389,664 \n578,578 \n943,056 \n1,095,349 \n\nThe  electricity  generation  from  new  and  renewable  energies  is  growing  dramatically. \nThe  electricity  generated  from  renewable  energy  was  4,533,603  MWh  in  2004  but \n35,983,514  MWh  in  2015,  showing  rapid  growth.  The  year  2005  witnessed  the \nintroduction of new energy. New energy accounted for the production of 2,103 MWh in \nthe first year, and its consumption expanded to generate 1,095,349 MWh of electricity \nin  2015.  Electricity  consumers  are  the  most  sensitive  to  price  and  prefer  to  avoid  \nrisk,  greenhouse  gases,  and  fine  dust  emissions  at  the  same  time,  so,  for  new  and \nrenewable forms of energy, which entail no risk and are environmentally friendly, price \ncompetitiveness is the most important factor in improving the market acceptance, and \nthe distribution of new and renewable energy will be resolved in the mid to long term \nrather  than  in  the  short  term  (Lee  2016a).  In  the  long  run,  a  1%  increase  in  the  total \nelectricity  consumption  will  result  in  a  37.5%  increase  in  carbon  dioxide  emissions \n\n9 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nwhile  a  1%  increase  in  electricity  generation  through  renewable  energy  will  cause  a \n16.8% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions (Kim and Kim 2015). \n\nThe most utilized renewable source to generate electricity has been waste since 2011. \nIt  accounted  for  a  share  of  62.4%  of  electricity  generation  from  renewable  energy  in \n2015 and consisted of waste gas, industrial waste, living waste, solid refuse fuel (SRF), \ncement kiln fuel, and refinery fuel oil. Bio resources, such as bio gas, LFG, wood chips, \nwood pellets, black liquor, sewage solid fuel, bio-SRF, and bio bunkers, constituted the \nsecond-largest share of 15.4% in 2015 and have been more used than ever.  \n\nFigure 7: Shares of Renewable Energy in Electricity Generation \n(%) \n\nData source: KEEI (2017). \n\n \n\nThe  presence  of  RPS  works  to  the  advantage  of  solar  power  over  other  sources, \nthough  wind  power  is  the  optimal  source  for  Korean  power  producers;  furthermore, \nsolar  power  could  become  the  first  choice  of  Korean  power  producers  if  the  unit \nproduction  cost  of  solar  power  decreases  to  1.5  times  that  of  wind  power  and  \nthe  technology  investment  in  solar  power  increases  to  1.2  times  that  of  wind  power  \n(Jo, Huh, and Lee 2016). \n\nThe  plan  to  substitute  nuclear  power  and  coal  (bituminous)  with  LNG  and  renewable \nenergy increases the cost and risk of the electricity generation mix, so the increase in \nrenewable  energy  in  the  electricity  mix  causes  an  increase  in  the  cost  volatility  risk, \nnecessitating a reduction in the manufacturing unit cost (Cha 2017). To keep pace with \nthe increasing trend of renewable energy use, the direction of technology development \nshould be mainly cost reduction in manufacturing: in the photovoltaic power generation \nindustry,  core  equipment  in  ingot  and  wafer  manufacturing  has  shown  strong \ndependency  on  overseas  importation,  which  has  hurt  the  business  profit,  so  the \nlocalization  of  equipment  is  necessary  to  boost  business  and  a  reduction  in  the \nmanufacturing cost of photovoltaic cells and modules is needed through the installation \nof automated facilities. In the wind power generation industry, core components, such \nas  controllers  and  power  converters,  need  localization  with  validated  durability  and \ntrust; the energy storage system (ESS) requires the localization of core materials and \nmanufacturing cost reduction for promotion (Ahn 2017). \n\n10 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\n4.  GHG EMISSIONS IN REPUBLIC OF KOREA  \n\nThe  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventory  &  Research  Center  of  Korea  (GIR),  established  in \n2010  under  the  Framework  Act  on  Low-Carbon  Green  Growth,  manages  the  national \nGHG  emission  amount.  The  GIR  publishes  the  national  greenhouse  gas  inventory  of \nthe Republic of Korea every year to enable the public to understand the national GHG \nemissions per annum.  \n\nThe national GHG emissions in the Republic of Korea increased until 2013 but reduced \nin  2014.  The  total  GHG  emissions  in  2014  amounted  to  690.6  million  tCO2e  and \ndeclined by 0.8% compared with 2013. It was the first decline in GHG emissions at the \ncountry level since 1998, when a big decline occurred due to the Asian financial crisis.  \n\nThe energy sector played a critical role in the reduction of GHG emissions by showing \na 1.2% GHG emission reduction compared with 2013 (for details, see Table 4 below). \nThe GHG emission amount in the energy and industrial process sectors accounted for \n94.7%  of  the  total.  The  GHG  emissions  in  the  energy,  agriculture,  and  waste  sectors \nreduced  compared  with  the  previous  year  by  1.2,  2.7,  and  3.3%,  respectively,  while \nthose  in  the  industrial  process  sector  increased  by  5.0%.  This  study  calculated  the \ncompound annual growth rate (CAGR) of GHG emissions in every sector for the period \nfrom  1998  to  2014.  The  energy  sector  shows  the  highest  CAGR  among  the  five \nsectors,  3.4%,  and  the  CAGR  of  the  industrial  process  sector  is  the  second  largest, \n2.0%.  The  GHG  emissions  in  agriculture  have  reduced  with  a  CAGR  of  \u20130.6%.  The \nabsorption in land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) has fallen from 56.1 to \n42.5 million tCO2e because of the reduction of forest land (Korea Forest Service 2014).  \n\nTable 4: GHG Emissions by Sector (1998\u20132014) \n(Unit: In Million tCO2e) \n\nYear \n\n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n\nEnergy \n350.4 \n381.1 \n410.4 \n424.4 \n443.2 \n450.8 \n458.4 \n466.4 \n472.6 \n491.6 \n505.8 \n512.2 \n565.2 \n593.9 \n597.7 \n606.7 \n599.3 \n\nIndustrial \nProcess \n39.9 \n47.3 \n49.6 \n48.3 \n52.1 \n55.3 \n57.6 \n54.3 \n52.9 \n50.8 \n50.0 \n47.0 \n54.0 \n51.7 \n51.7 \n52.0 \n54.6 \n\nAgriculture \n23.6 \n22.4 \n21.8 \n21.3 \n21.1 \n20.8 \n20.9 \n21.1 \n21.2 \n21.4 \n21.5 \n22.0 \n22.4 \n21.5 \n21.9 \n21.9 \n21.3 \n\nLULUCF  Waste \n-      56.1 \n-      59.2 \n-      58.8 \n-      56.6 \n-      55.8 \n-      57.0 \n-      55.0 \n-      56.4 \n-      57.1 \n-      57.9 \n-      57.3 \n-      54.5 \n-      54.3 \n-      48.5 \n-      44.7 \n-      42.8 \n-      42.5 \n\n16.1 \n16.9 \n18.9 \n19.7 \n18.7 \n18.8 \n17.7 \n16.7 \n17.1 \n15.7 \n15.5 \n15.5 \n15.1 \n15.5 \n15.8 \n16.0 \n15.4 \n\nSource: GIR (2017). \n\nTotal GHG \nEmissions \n(except LULUCF) \n430.0 \n467.7 \n500.6 \n513.7 \n535.0 \n545.7 \n554.7 \n558.5 \n563.8 \n579.5 \n592.8 \n596.7 \n656.6 \n682.6 \n687.1 \n696.5 \n690.6 \n\n11 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nHowever, the energy sector has emitted the most GHGs among the five sectors. The \nGHG  emissions  in  the  energy  sector  represented  an  86.8%  share  of  the  total  GHG \nemissions  in  2014.  They  increased  between  1998  and  2013.  The  industrial  process \ntook a 7.9% share of the total GHG emissions in 2014. The largest share was 10.4% in \n2004, but it has been following a decreasing trajectory since then. In the energy sector, \nthe  three  principal  industries  in  GHG  emissions  are  historically  energy  generation, \nmanufacturing  and  construction,  and  transportation.  Energy  generation  accounts  for \nthe  largest  portion  among  the  specified  industries  in  GHG  emissions.  Its  share  rose \nfrom  29.9%  in  1998  to  43.5%  in  2014,  though  it  dropped  by  1.8%p  compared  with \n2013. Manufacturing and construction followed energy generation with a 32.4% share \nin 2014. They recorded the smallest share of 26.8% in 2009 and followed a decreasing \ntrend  by  2013  but  increased  by  2.4%p  in  2014.  The  third-largest  share  is  that  of  the \ntransportation  industry:  its  share  declined  from  16.4%  in  1998  to  14.8%  in  2014, \nincreased  by  2003,  and  since  then  has  continued  to  decrease.  As  the  three  sectors \nmentioned above account for about 79% of the total GHG emissions, the Republic of \nKorea can achieve a favorable reduction in GHG emissions by focusing on these three \nindustries to achieve greater effectiveness as well as efficiency in the policy.  \n\nThe  GDP  has  the  largest  effect  on  the  gross  GHG  emissions  (Kim  2015c).  The  per \ncapita GHG emissions followed an increasing trend, except for 1998, during the period \nfrom 1990 to 2013. From 1998, they increased until 2013; however, they first reduced \nby 1.2% in 2014. The rate of increase has been decreasing overall since 1998, though \nthere was a sudden rise in 2010. It fell to \u201314.7% in 1998.  \n\nFigure 8: Per Capita GHG Emissions in the Republic of Korea \n\nData source: GIR (2017). \n\n \n\n5.  GREEN FINANCE IN REPUBLIC OF KOREA  \n\n5.1  Green Management Company Finance Support System, \n\nenVinance \n\nThe  purpose  of  enVinance  is  to  promote  the  green  financing  of  commercial  banks \nthrough  preferential \ntreatment  of  companies  with  outstanding  environmental \nmanagement  activities  by  collecting  and  analyzing  the  corporate  environmental \n\n12 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\ninformation that the government owns according to the Framework Act on Low-Carbon \nGreen  Growth  and  the  Act  on  Support  of  Environmental  Technology  and  Industry.  In \nJanuary  2017,  the  government  amended  the  enforcement  regulation  of  the  Act  on \nSupport of Environmental Technology and Industry to provide the legal ground for the \nenVinance system.  \n\nThe  system  provides  environmental  performance  evaluation  reports  to  individual \nthe \ncompanies,  and  commercial  banks  utilize \nenvironmental  risk  in  the  loan  evaluation  process.  Companies  can  understand  their \nenvironmental risk state and find ways to overcome it via the evaluation report, and the \nsystem defines companies with outstanding environmental management as those with \nan  outstanding  grade  in  enVinance  or  those  that  have  received  the  grand  prize  in \nenvironmental management; they are treated preferentially and awarded extra points in \nthe policy correspondence area in the environmental policy fund evaluation process. \n\nto  assess  and \n\ninclude \n\nthem \n\nThe operator, the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI), aims to \nexpand the usefulness of enVinance for financial institutions. It is favorable for financial \ninstitutions  to  make  investment  decisions  utilizing  enVinance  rather  than  decisions  \non  corporate  loans.  Seven  Korean  commercial  banks  among  the  Korean  financial \ninstitutions  have  joined  enVinance  as  of  2017  and  have  made  efforts  to  utilize  it  in \nfinancial  products.  The  KEITI  will  expand  the  participation  of  financial  institutions  to \ninsurance companies, as until now only commercial banks have joined. The enVinance \nsystem  will  be  utilized  by  insurance  companies  for  environmental  liability  insurance, \nwhich has been obligatory for companies with heavy environmental loads since 2014.  \n\n5.2  Environmental Information Disclosure  \n\nThe  aim  is  to  construct  the  nationwide  environmental  management  infrastructure  and \nestablish  voluntary  environmental  management  by  enhancing  the  voluntary  will  to \npromote  environmental  management  at  the  corporate  level  and  promoting  the \nenvironmental communication with the public and to contribute to the green loans and \ninvestment  of  financial  institutions  by  providing  them  with  verified  environmental \ninformation. Disclosure object institutions should submit the environmental information \nof  the  previous  year  to  the  website  (www.env-info.kr)  by  June  every  year,  and  the \nsubmitted  information  will  become  available  to  the  public  every  March  following \nvalidation.  Disclosure  items  are  categorized  into  mandatory  and  voluntary  disclosure \nand vary by industry sector.  \n\nAs  of  2015,  the  number  of  registered  institutions  is  1,383,  composed  of  624 \nmanufacturers,  accounting  for  45%  of  the  total,  410  public  administration  bodies,  26 \nhygiene service institutions, 74 educational service institutions, and so on; 100% of the \nmandatory  disclosure  and  25.3%  of  the  voluntary  disclosure  have  been  implemented \nso far based on the number of voluntary disclosure items (KEITI 2017).  \n\nHowever,  some  researchers  have  stated  critically  that  manufacturers  in  various \nindustries have different features economically as well as environmentally, so it would \nbe better to be more specific regarding environmental characteristics. Some have also \nsuggested  that  the  system  needs  to  transform  certain  voluntary  disclosure  items  into \nmandatory  items  and  proposed  the  adoption  of  the  \u201ccomply  or  explain\u201d  principle \nwhereby, if an item is not related to a company, it can just explain the irrelevance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nTable 5: Mandatory and Voluntary Disclosure Items by Industry Sector \n\nManufacturer \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nPublic \nAdministration \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nEducation \nservice \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nHygiene \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nOther \nservices \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nOther \nindustries \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\nContent \n\nCorporate \noverview \n\nGreen \nmanagement \nsystem \n\nResources/ \nenergy \n\nGHG/ \nenvironmental \npollution \n\nGreen \nproducts and \nservices \n\nSocial and \nethical \nresponsibility \n\nItems \nBusiness status \n\nEnvironment-related \nawards and agreement \n\nVision, strategy, direction, \nand goal \nOrganization in full \ncharge, training and \neducation, internal \nassessment, etc. \n\nInvestment in reduction \nand technology adoption \nMaterial usage  \n\nWater consumption \n\nEnergy consumption \n\nRenewable energy \ninvestment and \ntechnology adoption \n\nInvestment in GHG \nemission reduction and \ntechnology adoption \nGHG management level \nand emission amount \nInvestment in \nenvironmental pollution \nreduction and technology \nadoption \nEnvironmental pollution \nmanagement facility and \nmonitoring system \nAir pollution material \nemissions \nWater pollution material \nemissions \nWaste generation and \nrecycling \nHazardous material usage \n\nManagement of land, \nnoise and vibration, and \nodors  \n\nInvestment in green \nproduct and service \ndevelopment and \ntechnology adoption \nEco-friendly design \n\nThird-party certification \nand type II certified \nproducts \nGreen purchase direction \nand operation \nManagement of \nenvironmental information \nof subcontractors and \nenvironmental \nperformance evaluation \nSupport for environmental \ntechnology and education \n\nEnvironment law violation \n(domestic/overseas) \nEnvironment \n(sustainability) report \npublication  \nCorrespondence with \nstakeholders following \nrequests for \nenvironmental information \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n14 \n \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cf \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cf \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u25cb \n\n\u201c\u25cf\n\n denotes a mandatory disclosure item, \u201c\u25cb\u201d denotes a voluntary disclosure item, and \u201c\u2013\u201d denotes no relevance.  \n\nSource: www.env-info.kr (accessed on 12 December 2017). \n\n\u201d\n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\n5.3  Loans from the State-Owned Environmental Fund  \n\nThe  MoE  provides  a  loan  service  from  the  state-owned  environmental  fund  for \nenvironmental  industry,  separate  from  the  utility  sector,  in  particular  new  and \nrenewable  energy.

The  total  government  subsidies  for  renewable  energy \ncumulatively amount to KRW 1.8 trillion for 55,084 cases (KEA 2017).  \n\nThe government also financially supports green homes or buildings. It defines a green \nhome as a low-energy eco-friendly home that minimizes the use of fossil fuels and the \nemission  of  GHGs  as  well  as  air  pollution  materials  through  the  adoption  of  new  and \nrenewable  energy,  such  as  solar  photovoltaic,  solar  thermal,  geothermal,  and  so  on, \nand the use of high-efficiency lights and boilers and eco-friendly insulating materials.  \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nPurpose \n\nProduction and facility \n\nBio and waste \nFacilities for homes \nOperation \n\nTable 7: Financial Support for Renewable Energy \n\nUpper Limit \n(KRW Billion) \n\nLoan Period \n\nSupport Rate \n\n10 \n\n10 \n0.1 \n1 \n\nFive-year deferment \nTen-year split payment \nThree-year deferment  \nFive-year split payment \n\nOne-year deferment \nTwo-year split payment \n\nSME: 90% \nIntermediary company: 70% \nLarge company: 40% \n(maximum) \n\nSource: http://www.knrec.or.kr/knrec/12/KNREC121915.asp (accessed on 12 December 2017). \n\nTable 8: Financial Support Performance for Renewable Energy \n\n~2010 \n54,354 \n1,143 \n\n2011 \n43 \n112 \n\n2012 \n40 \n89 \n\n2013 \n52 \n84 \n\n2014 \n245 \n128 \n\n2015 \n252 \n135 \n\n2016 \n98 \n100 \n\nTotal \n55,084 \n1,791 \n\nYear \nNo. of cases \nSubsidies \n(KRW billion) \n\nSource: KEA (2017). \n\nThe  state  of  historical  support  since  2011  shows  that  the  support  for  production  has \nreduced while the support for facilities has grown fast.

The  researchers  understand  that  the  current  policy  is  to  support  the  installation  \nof  facilities  rather  than  production  to  reduce  the  GHG  emissions  directly  as  well  as \neffectively.  \n\nThe  utilization  of  social  financing,  such  as  crowd  funding,  is  an  alternative  method  \nto  promote  the  diffusion  of  new  and  renewable  energies  by  providing  a  social  fund \n(Jung 2016). \n\nTable 9: Financial Support Amount per Renewable Energy Source  \n(Unit: KRW million) \n\n2011 \n26,668 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n3,733 \n2,935 \n1,087 \n\u2013 \n8,154 \n10,759 \n\u2013 \n79,238 \n5,894 \n111,800 \n\n2012 \n45,498 \n224 \n\u2013 \n15,305 \n13,454 \n2,730 \n477 \n13,208 \n100 \n\u2013 \n40,842 \n3,000 \n89,340 \n\n2013 \n57,218 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n23,667 \n12,683 \n3,150 \n868 \n2,955 \n13,895 \n\u2013 \n23,988 \n3,000 \n84,206 \n\n2014 \n103,367 \n\u2013 \n45,637 \n11,920 \n32,572 \n2,444 \n794 \n10,000 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n22,033 \n3,000 \n128,400 \n\n2015 \n119,000 \n200 \n49,737 \n16,593 \n15,602 \n804 \n\u2013 \n26,885 \n1,339 \n7,840 \n13,000 \n3,000 \n135,000 \n\n2016 \n92,157 \n\u2013 \n34,841 \n2,363 \n13,668 \n751 \n\u2013 \n17,174 \n8,360 \n15,000 \n4,843 \n3,000 \n100,000 \n\nTotal \n443,908 \n424 \n130,215 \n73,581 \n90,914 \n10,966 \n2,139 \n78,376 \n34,453 \n22,840 \n183,944 \n20,894 \n648,746 \n\nYear \nFacility fund \nSolar thermal \nSolar photovoltaic \nBio \nWaste \nSmall hydro \nGeothermal \nWind \nFuel cell \nESS \nProduction fund \nOperation fund \nTotal \n\nSource: KEA (2017). \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\n5.5  Emission Trading Scheme \n\nThe  government  launched  the  emission  trading  scheme  (ETS)  in  January  2015  for \neffective  as  well  as  efficient  GHG  reduction  in  the  industry  sectors.  The  Framework  \nAct on Low-Carbon Green Growth legislated in 2009 stipulates the introduction of the \n\u201ccap and trade\u201d ETS. The government implemented the ETS act in 2012. Companies \nwith  3-year  average  GHG  emissions  of  over  125,000  tCO2e  or  facilities  with  3-year \naverage  GHG  emissions  of  over  25,000  tCO2e  are  designated  ETS  objects.  There \nwere 525 companies in 25 industry sectors2 as ETS objects in January 2015 and 549 \nin  January  2017  (Kim  and  Shim  2017).  Offset  credit  is  available  so  that  entities  can \noffset  the  emission  amount  as  much  as  their  overseas  carbon  emission  reduction.  In \n2015 and 2016, the scheme certified 100 offset credits. \n\nThe Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MoSF) reallocates the GHG emissions to entities \nparticipating in the ETS every 5 years based on the 5-year GHG emission amounts, but \nit planned the second allocation 3 years after the ETS\u2019s launch, that is, in 2017 (MoSF \n2014). It publicly announced the reallocation of the emission amounts on 30 November \n2017  (MoSF  2017).  The  total  allocated  emissions  increased  by  17,631,757  Korean \nAllowance  Units  (KAUs),  consisting  of  the  increase  in  the  preallocated  emissions  of \n17,014,932 tCO2e and the reserved emissions of 616,825 tCO2e; more specifically, the \nindustry has the largest increase rate of 4.7%, much larger than 1.08% for energy and \n1.96%  for  transportation  (MoSF  2017).  However,  the  Ministry  excluded  the  city  gas \nindustry,  which  is  a  substitute  for  district  heating,  from  the  emission  trading,  equal  to \nallocating unlimited emission credits free of charge to the city gas sector, which will not \nonly be a matter of equity but will also hinder the efficient allocation of resources in the \nheating market (Oh 2017). \n\nThe closing price of the KAU has risen rapidly to about 3.6 times its initial price, from \nKRW 7,860 in February 2015 to KRW 28,000 in June 2018. It rose from KRW 8,000 to \n20,850  in  January  2017  and  from KRW  23,900  to  28,000  in June  2018,  though  there \nwere  few  transactions  by  2016.  As  time  passes,  the  pressure  to  reduce  the  GHG \nemissions  will  become  more  intense  and  the  price  will  rise  more  than  ever.  Figure  9 \nbelow  illustrates  the  closing  price  and  trading  volume  of  the  KAU  since  2017.  As \nshown, the price of the KAU has been over KRW 20,000 since February 2017, and a \nlarge demand emerged recently.  \n\nThe Korean Credit Unit (KCU) has  been transacted since April 2017 with the price of \nKRW  19,600,  and  its  price  is  KRW  21,800  as  of  29  June  2018,  which  is  much  more \nstatic than the price of the KAU (see Figure 10). The transaction of the Korean Offset \nCredit (KOC) started on 23 May 2016, at the price of KRW 18,500, and its recent price \nwas KRW 26,000. As shown, the KOC has achieved more transactions than the KAU \nand KCU so far.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   These  classified  in  accordance  with  the  second-highest  level  of  the  Korean  Standard  Industrial \n\nClassification (KSIC). \n\n17 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nFigure 9: Closing Price of KAU173 since 2017 \n\n \n\n \n\nData source: www.krx.co.kr. \n\nFigure 10: Closing Price of KCU17 (since 14 April 2017) \n\nData source: www.krx.co.kr. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3   KAU17 denotes the KAUs allocated by 2017 and transacted by June 2018.  \n\n18 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nFigure 11: Closing Price of KOC \n\nData source: www.krx.co.kr. \n\n \n\nAlong  with  the  launch  of  the  ETS,  the  government  will  assist  industries  through  tax \ndeduction and subsidies. The investment in environmental conservation facilities will be \ndeducted from the tax amount, and the government will support 50% of the cost of the \ninstallation  of  best  available  technology  (BAT)  facilities  or  manufacturing  process \nimprovements.  \n\nThe  Korea  Exchange  is  making  efforts  to  develop  the  emission  trading  market \ninformation  platform  to  provide  integrated  emission  information  that  it  will  distribute  \nto  several  agencies  in  2018.  SK  Securities  contracted  a  business  collaboration  \nto  disseminate  high-efficiency  stoves \nto  Bangladeshi  households  as  a  Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  (CDM)  project  and  import  the  certified  emission  reduction \n(CER)  in  2018  (Green  Economy  Daily  2018c).  The  expectation  is  that  this  will  save  \n2.4  million  tCO2e  of  GHG  over  five  years.  It  became  possible  as  the  government \nregulation has changed to let domestic companies import the CER of their foreign GHG \nreduction projects.  \n\nThe ETS is known as a political means to accomplish the given GHG reduction goal in \nthe  most  cost-efficient  manner;  however,  it  is  possible  in  ideal  market  conditions  with \nno  market  distortion,  and  estimates  indicate  that  the  Korean  ETS  is  weak,  with \ntransaction costs, market dominance, and price risk as market distortion factors (Shim \nand  Lee  2015).  The  Green  Growth  Committee  has  suggested  that  companies  can \npurchase  cheap  reduction  means  through  the  market  mechanism  in  the  ETS,  saving \nthe  cost  of  32%  to  56%  compared  with  target  management  (Choi  2011).  It  has \nsuggested the differentiation of criteria for companies or places of business considering \nindustrial  features  rather  than  the  current  uniform  criterion  regardless  of  the  industry \nsector  and  free  allocation  of  certified  emission  reduction  (CER)  with  the  benchmark \napproach to efficiency (Kim 2015a). The petroleum industry has improved the efficiency \nof  its  GHG  reduction  since  2013,  more  through  the  ETS  than  through  target \nmanagement (Kim and Noh 2016). The ETS can also affect the electricity market under \nthe 7th electricity supply and demand master plan: coal generation will fall if the CER \nprice rises, but, if the CER price is too high, it will cause an increase in the electricity \n\n19 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nprice  (Lee  2015a).  The  voluntary  participation  of  companies  is  essential  for  the \nsuccessful settlement of the ETS, and it is necessary for them to make investors aware \nof  their  activities  toward  climate  change  through  effective  publicity  about  climate \nchange response activities, which may lead to a positive effect on corporate value (Kim \n2016a).  It  is  important  to  include  the  basic  directions  for  the  reduction  using  the \ninternational carbon market in the preparation of the roadmap for GHG reduction in the \nRepublic of Korea in the future (Lee 2016b). \n\nTable 10: Industry Sectors of the KAU Allocation with Payment \n\nNo. \n\nIndustry Sectors \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n\nElectric Power Generation \nSlaughtering of Livestock, Processing, Preserving of Meat and Meat Products \nManufacture of Dairy Products and Edible Ice Cakes \nManufacture of Other Food Products \nManufacture of Alcoholic Beverages \nManufacture of Ice and Non-alcoholic Beverages, Production of Mineral Waters \nDyeing and Finishing Textiles \nManufacture of Wood Products  \nManufacture of Plastic Products \nManufacture of Articles of Concrete, Cement, and Plaster \nCast of Metals \nManufacture of Other Fabricated and Processed Metal Products  \nTelecommunications \nComputer Programming, Consultancy, and Related Activities  \nInformation Service Activities \nRetail Sale in Non-specialized Stores \nAccommodation \nInsurance \nReal Estate Activities with Own or Leased Property \nAdministration of Industrial and Social Policy of Community \nUniversities \nHospital Activities \nAmusement and Theme Park Operation \nAir Transport (Domestic) \nSewage, Wastewater, and Human Waste Treatment Services \nWater Supply \n\nSource: MoE (2018). \n\nIn  2018,  the  management  authority  of  the  ETS  changed  from  the  MoSF  to  the  MoE, \nand  the  MoE  announced  the  2nd  KAU  allocation  plan  on  12  July  2018.  The  major \nchanges  are  1)  allocation  with  payment  for  26  industry  sectors,  2)  expansion  of  the \napplication  of  the  BM  method  in  allocating  the  KAUs,  and  3)  more  specified  industry \nsectors from the 2nd level to the 3rd level of the KSIC. The industry sectors are more \ndetailed because several companies appeared to be disadvantaged (MoE 2018). Some \nhad criticized the class cation of the manufacturing of cement, lime, and plaster and the \nmanufacturing  of  articles  of  concrete,  ready-mixed  concrete,  and  other  cement  and \nplaster  products  in  the  3rd  level  of  the  KSIC  but  the  manufacturing  of  cement,  lime, \n\n20 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nplaster, and its products in the 2nd level, so they were originally among the industries \nfor KAU allocation with payment; with the application of the 3rd level of the KSIC, the \nmanufacturers of cement will receive their allocation of the KAU with no payment.4 To \nresolve this unfair problem, the MoE specified industries further from 25 to 63 sectors; \nit selected 26 sectors according to the 3rd level of the KSIC as the objects of the KAU \nallocation  with  payment,  as  Table  10  illustrates.  The  companies  in  the  26  industry \nsectors  should  purchase  3%  of  the  allowance,  and  it  is  estimated  that  an  additional \ncost of KRW 4.5 trillion will occur for 3 years (MoE 2018).  \n\nIn  addition,  public  financial  institutions,  such  as  the  Korea  Development  Bank,  the \nKorea  Exim  Bank,  and  the  Industrial  Bank  of  Korea,  will  take  the  role  of  market \nprovider,  5  and  14  million  tCO2e  are  set  as  slack  for  market  liquidity  and  for  market \nstability,  respectively,  and  the  application  of  the  benchmark  allocation  method  is \nexpanding  to  increase  the  allocation  of  more  KAUs  to  high-efficiency  facilities,  as  the \ngrandfathering method is disadvantageous to high-efficiency facilities (MoE 2018).  \n\n5.6  Green Bonds and Funds  \n\nA green bond is differentiated from a regular bond by its label, that is, its designation as \ngreen  from  the  issuer  or  another  entity,  which  involves  a  commitment  to  use  the \nproceeds  or  green  bonds  in  a  transparent  manner  and  to  finance  or  refinance \nexclusively green projects, assets, or business activities with an environmental benefit \n(OECD 2015). Another entity can apply a green bond label to a bond via its inclusion in \na  green  bond  index,  such  as  the  Bank  of  America  Merrill  Lynch  Green  Bond  Index, \nBarclays  MSCI  Green  Bond  Index,  S&P  Green  Bond  Index  and  Green  Project  Bond \nIndex,  and  Solactive  Green  Bond  Index,  or  through  a  tag  on  analytical  tools  that  are \nwidely used in financial markets, such as the Bloomberg Terminal (OECD 2015).  \n\nDifferent from other countries, green bonds in the Republic of Korea are not sovereign \nbonds  but  a  kind  of  public  or  corporate  bond  to  invest  in  environmental  projects  or \nrenewable energy, so the fund size is relatively small. The MoSF has announced that it \nhas no plan to issue sovereign green bonds yet, as of March 2018 (Etoday 2018).  \n\nGreen  bonds  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  are  booming  again.  They  boomed  as  the \ngovernment  announced  the  reduction  of  the  share  of  nuclear  power  generation  as  \nwell  as  the  increase  in  the  share  of  new  and  renewable  energy  in  2017.  The \nexpectation  is  that  a  large  amount  of  funds  will  be  necessary  to  expand  the  share  of \nnew  and  renewable  energy  for  several  years,  as  the  government  will  increase  the \npower generation by new and renewable energy from 17 GW in 2017 to 67 GW in 2030 \n(Construction Economy News 2017). \n\nKorean  public  institutions  have  played  an  important  role  in  issuing  green  bonds.  The \nKorea Exim Bank created a green bond of USD 500 million to invest in environmental \nimprovement  projects  as  well  as  renewable  energy  in  2013  (Green  Economy  Daily \n2013).  The  Korea  Exim  Bank  also  issued  a  green  bond  of  USD  400  million  in  March \n2018, and the Korea Development Bank, which subscribed to the Equator Principle in \nJanuary 2017, issued and listed a green bond of KRW 300 billion on the KOSPI, which \nis the first Arirang green bond (Green Economy Daily 2018b; Korea Exchange 2018). \nThe  Korea  Exchange  is  making  efforts  to  list  the  Arirang  green  bond  in  the  stock \nmarket.  The  Korea  Water  Resources  Corporation  issued  a  water  bond,  a  kind  of  \ngreen bond, of USD 300 million, which is the first water bond in Asia, in 2017 (Green \nEconomy Daily 2018a).  \n\n                                                 \n4   http://news1.kr/articles/?3358778. \n\n21 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nTable 11: Green bond Issuance in Republic of Korea \n\nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n\nIssuer  \n\nIssue Date \n\nSize \n\nListing \n\nKorea Exim Bank \n\nHyundai Capital \nKorea Development Bank \nHanjin International \nKorea Exim Bank \nKorea Water Resources Corporation \nKorea Development Bank \n\nUSD 500 million   SGX \n20 February 2013 \nUSD 400 million  SGX \n2 February 2016 \nUSD 500 million  SGX \n7 March 2016 \n27 Jun 2017 \nUSD 300 million  SGX \n25 September 2017   USD 300 million  SGX \n8 March 2018  \n8 May 2018 \n29 May 2018 \n\nUSD 400 million  TPEx, SGX \nUSD 300 million  SGX \nKRW 300 billion  KRX \n\nSGX  denotes  the  Singapore  Stock  Exchange,  TPEx  denotes  the  Taipei  Stock  Exchange,  and  KRX  denotes  the  \nKorea Exchange. \n\nSource: Korea Exchange (2018). \n\nRecently,  the  Korea  Land  &  Housing  Corporation  obtained  certification  as  a  qualified \nsocial  green  bond  issuer  by  Sustainalytics  in  2018  and  made  efforts  to  issue  a  \nsocial green bond (Dailian 2018). The Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and  \nthe  East  and  West  Power  Corporation  (EWPC)  will  try  to  create  green  bonds  of  \nUSD 500 million each. The KEPCO and EWPC will issue green bonds to invest in the \nnew  and  renewable  energy  and  ESS  (Korea  Economic  Daily  2018).  Furthermore,  the \nIndustrial  Bank  of  Korea  is  now  seeking  to  issue  a  social  bond  of  USD  500  million  \n(The bell 2018). \n\nIn the private sector, Hyundai Capital first created a green bond of USD 500 million to \nsupport  hybrid  vehicle  purchases  financially  in  2016,  and  it  received  the  award  from \nThe  Asset  for  the  best  Korean  green  bond  in  2017  (Climate  Bonds  Initiative  2018; \nDongailbo  2017).  The  Hanjin  International  Corporation  issued  a  green  bond  of  \nUSD  300  million  to  invest  in  its  own  eco-friendly  building  in  2017  (Climate  Bonds \nInitiative 2018). \n\nEstimates  indicate  that  the  green  bond  size  will  be  about  KRW  2.67  trillion  in  2018, \nwhich is larger than the total ESG bond size, KRW 2.15 trillion, issued by 2017 (Korea \nEconomic Daily 2018). In addition, green bonds are following the trend to expand their \ncoverage to the environment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG), so some \nrefer to ESG bonds. Thus, the green bond market is spreading very fast to keep pace \nwith  the  domestic  policy  to  reduce  the  nuclear  and  enhance  the  new  and  renewable \npower generation and the global trend of increasing ESG bonds. \n\nAs  far  as  green  funds  are  concerned,  the  National  Pension  Service  (NPS)  invested \nKRW  200  billion  in  two  green  private  equity  funds  (PEFs)  to  invest  in  the  domestic \ngreen  infrastructure,  such  as  renewable  energy  electricity  generation,  waste  facilities, \nand  so  forth,  in  2017  (Chosunilbo  2017),  and  the  Korea  Scientists  and  Engineers \nMutual-Aid  Association  (SEMA)  invested  KRW  40  billion  in  a  green  fund  in  which \nlargest investor is the NPS (The bell 2017). Financial institutions, in particular domestic \ninstitutions,  have  been  making  efforts  to  create  funds  related  to  new  and  renewable \nenergy,  as  the  government  has  been  trying  to  increase  the  share  of  new  and \nrenewable energy power generation to 20% of the total power generation: the Shinhan \nFinancial  Group  and  the  KB  Financial  Group  created  new  and  renewable  energy  \nblind funds with sizes of KRW 100 billion and 150 billion in 2017, respectively, and KDB \nInfra  Asset  Management  is  managing  a  solar  photovoltaic  investment  fund  sized  \nKRW 350 billion (Construction Economy News 2017).  \n\n  \n\n22 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\n5.7  Incentives for and Barriers to Green Financing  \n\nin the Republic of Korea \n\nSince  the  government  declared  the  decrease  in  nuclear  energy  and  the  increase  in \nnew  and  renewable  energy  in  2017,  green  finance  has  progressed  more  than  ever, \nfocusing  on  new  and  renewable  energy.  The  government  has  actively  implemented \nproject financing in large-sized solar photovoltaic energy generation facilities to achieve \nstable  profitability.  The  KEPCO  will  purchase  the  electricity  generated  in  the  facilities \nunder  the  preannounced  unit  price  within  the  given  years;  although  the  unit  price  is \nexperiencing a downturn, it does not greatly affect the profitability.  \n\nAlong  with  the  private  sector\u2019s  green  financing,  the  government  is  seeking  to  support \ncompanies  or  facilities  related  to  the  environment  and  energy  financially  through  loan \nprograms  with  a  low  interest  rate.  The  public  loan  program  is  suitable  for  firms  or \nfacilities  that  find  a  way  to  become  eco-friendly  or  energy  efficient.  The  current \nmainstream in green financing is still loans with a lower interest rate in the Republic of \nKorea.  Though  it  can  offer  economic  benefits  as  much  as  the  difference  between \ngeneral and preferentially treated loan interest rates, it might enable rich companies to \nbecome  richer,  because  only  rich  companies  can  drive  environmental  projects  and \nreceive  financial  support  from  the  government.  The  government  focuses  on  stability \nrather than risk taking, so it never invests in companies with potential ability but lends \nmoney to financially stable companies with preferential treatment and a lower interest \nrate.  However,  the  government  should  adopt  a  risk-taking  position  to  invest  in \ncompanies with potential business ability, despite the fact that they are not financially \nstable now.  \n\nThe  largest  barrier  to  green  financing  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  is  the  lack  of  public \ninterest  in  green  growth.  People  have  little  interest  in  the  environment  but  think  that \neconomic  growth  or  profit  is  more  important  for  now.  The  lack  of  public  interest  does \nnot cause a significant increase in corporate value as well as market efficiency in the \ncapital market. Furthermore, companies participating in the ETS have urged the MoSF \nto  extend  the  allocated  amount  before  launching  the  ETS.  Korean  companies  with \nheavy  GHG  emissions,  which  have  participated  in  the  ETS  or  GHG  emission  target \nmanagement system, should willingly make efforts to reduce the GHG emissions under \ntheir  own  plans,  which  are  stricter  than  the  national  plan.  The  MoE  (2018)  recently \nannounced  the  KAU  allocation  plan  for  2018  to  2020,  including  the  allocation  with \npayment. However, in the meantime, it cautiously anticipates opposition from industries \nregarding the allocation with payment in particular. Public interest in the environment or \nenergy  can  heal \nthis  phenomenon  by  allowing  companies  with  outstanding \nenvironmental  performance  or  GHG  emission  reduction  to  enjoy  corporate  value \nenhancement  in  the  capital  market.  Private  companies  pursuing  profits  will  seek  to \nenhance  their  corporate  value  by  positively  improving  and  disclosing  their  eco-\nfriendliness or energy efficiency.  \n\nThe  OECD  (2015)  illustrated  the  advantages  as  well  as  the  disadvantages  of  green \nbonds, as Table 12 below shows. As investors are requested to be sustainable, that is \nto say, to meet the ESG requirements, it is possible  to achieve that via green bonds, \nwhich  provide  a  fixed  income,  so  it  is  necessary  to  facilitate  the  development  of \nenvironmental projects and the creation of a green bond base for them (OECD 2015).  \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nTable 12: Advantages and Disadvantages of Green Bonds \n\nAdvantages \n\nDisadvantages \n\n\u2212 \n\n\u2212 \n\nInvestors can balance risk-adjusted financial \nreturns with environmental benefits. \n\n\u2212  Satisfy ESG requirements and green investment \n\nmandates. \nImproved risk assessment in an otherwise \nopaque fixed-income market through the use of \nproceeds reporting. \n\n\u2212  Potential use of pure-play, project, and ABD to \nhedge actively against climate policy risks in a \nportfolio that includes emission-intensive assets. \n\n\u2212  Recognized by the UNFCCC as a non-state \n\nactor: \u201cclimate action.\u201d \n\nSource: OECD (2015). \n\n\u2212  Small and nascent (and potentially less \nliquid) market with small bond sizes. \n\u2212  Lack of unified standards can raise \nconfusion and the possibility of \nreputational risk if the green integrity of a \nbond is questioned.  \n\n\u2212  Limited scope for legal enforcement of \n\ngreen integrity. \n\n\u2212  Lack of standardization can lead to \n\ncomplexities in research and a need for \nextra due diligence that may not always be \nfulfilled. \n\nThe Climate Bonds Initiative (2018) summarized the strength and barriers to the growth \nof  the  green  bond  market  in  the  Republic  of  Korea,  as  Table  13  shows.  The  capital \nmarket in has strength in the system, and the government\u2019s strong drive toward green \ngrowth is a good investment opportunity now. It should sustain this growing interest in \ngreen bonds continuously and eliminate the barriers to the growth of green finance.  \n\nTable 13: Strengths and Barriers in the Korean Green Bond Market \n\n\u2022  Strong and functioning bond market \n\u2022  Bankable projects and robust project pipeline \n\u2022  Strong investor base \n\u2022  Supportive policy on climate change \n\nStrength \n\nBarriers to \nGrowth \n\n\u2022  Lack of market awareness from issuers  \n\u2022  Lack of awareness among investors \n\u2022  Lack of market guidance or standards, which can cause confusion in the local \nmarket around the types of assets or projects that can be considered green. \nGlobally accepted standards, such as the Climate Bonds Standard, can help in \nthis regard \n\n\u2022  Slightly higher transaction costs for green bond issuers  \n\u2022  Barriers to issuing internationally are present for all bond issuers in Korea \n\nSource: Climate Bonds Initiative (2018). \n\nHowever, the small green bond market size is the most disadvantageous aspect in the \nRepublic of Korea. Green bonds require further facilitation, because a large amount of \nfunds is needed to accomplish the national goal of an increase in new and renewable \nenergy.  It  is  necessary  for  the  government  to  support  the  infrastructure  of  green  \nbonds and to promote their issuance by financially sound companies. In addition, it is \nimportant to foster domestic agencies to appraise green bonds according to the global \nstandard, and this will ease the access to the issuance of green bonds. \n\n5.8  Impact: Financing Flows and the Diffusion of Renewables \n\nThe  government  is  making  efforts  to  disseminate  renewable  energy  by  financially \nsupporting  it  through  loans  and  subsidies.  It  will  sustain  this  effort  in  the  future,  as  \nthe  economic  profit  from  renewable  energy  is  one  of  the  most  critical  factors  in  the \nrenewable  energy  business.  For  home  use  of  renewable  energy,  subsidies  are  a \nparticularly  influential  and  important  component  in  determining  the  installation  of \n\n24 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nrenewable  energy  apparatus.  A  cautious  estimate  is  that  the  subsidies  will  rise  more \nthan  ever  to  boost  the  installation  and  achieve  the  GHG  reduction  goal  in  a  shorter \nperiod than predicted.  \n\nProject  financing  has  been  popular  for  renewable  energy,  particularly  large  solar \nphotovoltaic  power  generation,  due  to  KEPCO\u2019s  stable  purchase  of  electricity  for  the \nnext 20 years. The major participants in project financing are financial institutions such \nas  banks,  insurance  companies  and  securities  companies,  and  PEFs.  As  far  as \ndistributed  solar  photovoltaic  power  generation  for  homes  is  concerned,  the  principal \nfinancial  supporter  is  the  government,  both  centrally  and  locally.  The  government \nsupports  a  maximum  of  about  90%  of  the  total  installation  cost.  However,  more \nrenewable energy generation plants are needed to meet the demand without additional \nconstruction of nuclear power generation facilities, so public and private investment in \nrenewable energy will be more active than ever.  \n\nIn  addition,  the  government  will  enhance  the  investment  in  renewable  energy \ntechnology development. The yield rate is critical, as it determines the economic profit \nlevel.  A  50%  improvement  in  the  yield  rate  can  create  a  larger  economic  profit  than \nbefore,  and  the  economic  profit  will  make  people  and  companies  competitively  adopt \nrenewable  energy  apparatus  or  facilities.  The  development  of  highly  energy-efficient \ntechnology  is  also  a  field  that  will  receive  subsidies.  Products  with  low  electricity \nconsumption  reduce  the  total  electricity  consumption  and  decrease  the  necessity  of \nadditional  power  generation  facilities.  In  the  transportation  sector,  electric  or  hybrid \nvehicles will be disseminated more to the public to diminish the petroleum dependency. \nIt  is  widely  known  that  the  petroleum  dependency  in  the  transportation  sector  is  the \ngreatest among the industry sectors. A decrease in the petroleum dependency directly \ncauses  a  GHG  emission  reduction.  Therefore,  the  government  will  make  efforts  to \npromote the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles by offering larger subsidies.  \n\n6.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nThe  Republic  of  Korea  is  the  7th-largest  emitter  of  GHGs  in  the  world;  however,  the \nKorean  environmental  and  energy  policies  are  not  well  motivated  to  reduce  the  GHG \nemissions  and  to  prepare  for  climate  change.  GHG  emissions  have  been  increasing \nproportional to economic growth, and the per capita GHG emissions are still increasing. \nIt  is  time  to  provide  a  direct  policy  to  reduce  the  GHG  emissions.  Korean  people  \nneed to be energy efficient by strengthening personal norms such as moral obligation \nand  attitudes  toward  environmental/climate  change  issues,  which  have  a  positive \nimpact  on  encouraging  people  to  use  energy  efficiently  (Kim  2016b).  Various \nsupportive plans should be provided for the energy efficiency improvement, which the \ngovernment can emphasize as a means to reduce the GHG emissions in the Republic \nof  Korea\u2019s  industrial  and  power  sector  (Lee  2016c).  In  addition  to  energy  efficiency \nR&D  investment,  a  well-balanced  combination  of  relevant  technology  diffusion  and \nwell-designed R&D programs is necessary to obtain the real effect of R&D investment \nin  energy  efficiency  (Shim  2016).  It  is  also  necessary  to  expand  the  dissemination  of \nrenewable  energy  apparatus  for  home  use  to  meet  the  goal  of  a  20%  share,  though \nthis  requires  substantial  funding.  It  is  important  to  enable  every  home  to  be \nindependent  from  the  national  electricity  distribution.  Every  entity  in  the  Republic  of \nKorea  should  have  energy  independence  at  a  certain  level,  including  persons, \ncompanies, buildings, facilities, and so forth.  \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nOh and Kim \n\nGreen  finance  is  very  conducive  to  accomplishing  the  national  goal,  in  particular  the \ndissemination of renewable energy. Until new and renewable forms of energy attain a \ncertain  level  of  economic  feasibility,  efforts  are  needed  from  the  government,  the \nmarket participants, and the public (Lee 2016a). Public financial support from the local \nand  central  government  aims  to  diffuse  the  use  of  renewable  energy  at  home,  hybrid \nand  electric  vehicles,  and  renewable  energy  facilities  for  existing  companies.  Mainly \nPEFs  and  green  bonds  have  provided  new  renewable  energy  facilities.  To  spur  the \ndissemination of renewable energy, the expansion of public financial support is crucial. \nGreen  bond  issuance  of  private  companies  has  emerged  and  needs  expansion.  The \ngovernment will provide the supportive infrastructure for the issuance of green bonds, \nsuch  as  guarantees  of  public  financial  institutions  and  tax  incentives.  It  should  foster \ngreen  bond  appraisal  agencies.  As  far  as  the  ETS  is  concerned,  it  should  avoid  a \nchange  in  the  competent  authority  to  allow  successful  and  stable  settlement.  Since \n2018, the MoE has taken charge of the ETS again, instead of the MoSF. This affects \nthe consistency of the policy. The KAU allocation plan of the MoE (2018) revealed the \nallocation with payment and mentioned that it estimates it to be about KRW 4.7 trillion \nat  its  maximum  and  that  it  will  utilize  it  to  support  financially  the  GHG  emission \nreduction  activities  of  companies  participating  in  the  ETS.  In  addition,  the  role  of  the \ngovernment  is  crucial,  as  it  allocates  the  credit  allowance  to  companies.  Proper \nallocation  can  lead  firms  to  reduce  their  GHG  emissions  effectively.  However,  loose \nallocation  decreases  their  efforts  to  reduce  their  GHG  emissions,  so  it  is  important  to \nidentify  the  appropriate  allocation  amount  to  induce  firms  to  reduce  their  GHG \nemissions  with  no  resistance.  The  government  should  use  \u201ccarrots  and  sticks\u201d \nappropriately to achieve sound congruence between the government and the firms. \n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to improve the public interest in green finance. \u201cGo green\u201d \nneeds  green  finance  as  well  as  green  purchases.  Green  finance  is  the  first  move \ntoward  a  green  public.  It  is  necessary  for  the  public  to  understand  that  their  green \nfinance  activities  can  change  the  society  and  to  participate  in  various  green  finance \nactivities.  In  particular,  investors  will  change  the  environmental  or  energy  efficiency \nperformance  of  listed  firms  if  they  tend  to  invest  in  listed  firms  with  outstanding \nenvironmental performance or energy efficiency or to withdraw their investment in listed \nfirms  with  poor  environmental  performance  or  energy  efficiency.  Financial  institutions \nshould  make  efforts  to  provide  the  public  with  various  green  finance  options,  and  the \ngovernment  should  provide  green  finance  participants  with  more  incentives.  The \ngovernment  had  provided  a  tax  exemption  incentive  for  qualified  green  deposits, \nbonds,  and  funds;  however,  no  financial  institutions  have  offered  the  public  green \nfinancial instruments with tax exemption. If there are problems in resolving in the policy, \nthe government should improve the policy enough for green financial instruments to be \nimplemented  effectively.  If  financial  institutions  are  not  willing  to  become  involved  in \ngreen  finance,  it  is  necessary  to  provide  incentives  for  the  financial  institutions  that \nintroduce the best green finance. It is time to improve the green finance policy for better \nimplementation, as people consider green finance in the Republic of Korea to be more \nsocially important to keep pace with the national energy mix plan.  \n\nThe  government  declared  that  it  would  achieve  a  20%  share  of  renewable  energy  in \nelectricity generation by 2030, though it has not provided and publicly announced the \naction  plan  yet.  The  gist  is  that  it  will  not  construct  additional  nuclear  generating \nfacilities,  although  it  will  complete  facilities  that  are  currently  undergoing  construction, \nand  that  it  will  not  add  more  coal-fueled  thermal  generating  facilities  and  will  change \nthe  fuel  from  coal  to  other  cleaner  resources.  However,  the  national  plan  for  green \nfinance  is  not  available  yet  either,  as  the  specific  action  plan  is  not  complete.  If  the \ngovernment  provides  a  specific  action  plan,  it  will  cover  the  structure  of  the  support \n \nfunction of green finance and its implementation in detail. \n\n26 \n \n\n\fADBI Working Paper 897 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nOh and Kim \n\nAhn, Na Kyung. 2017. \u201cDirection of R&D Investment through Analyzing the Value \n\nChain of New and Renewable Energy: Focusing on Photovoltaic, Wind Power \nGeneration and Fuel Cell.\u201d KETEP Insight (August).

However,  their  use  has  not  increased  dramatically,  as  the  public \nsector has taken the major role in green finance. Nowadays, green finance is expanding as \nthe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  is  making  efforts  to  change  the  energy  mix  by \ndecreasing the share of nuclear energy and increasing that of new and renewable energy. \nThe private sector is also attempting to revitalize the green finance in the Republic of Korea, \nsuch  as  commercial  banks,  private  equity  funds,  and  so  forth.  Changing  the  energy  mix \nneeds  a  huge  fund,  so  the  government  alone  cannot  be  responsible;  the  government  is \nseeking to reach this goal in combination with private firms. In this context, the motivation of \nthe Korean people to adopt eco-friendliness and energy efficiency through green financing, \npublic  or  private,  is  necessary,  together  with  industrial  support  from  the  government  or \nfinancial institutions.  \n \nKeywords:  renewable  energy,  energy  mix,  electricity  mix,  green  finance,  greenhouse  gas \n(GHG) emissions, green growth, emission trading scheme (ETS) \n \nJEL Classification: Q40, Q54, Q58 \n \n", " \n"]}
