INTRODUCTION \nToday,  the  majority  of  countries  are  reducing  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nefficiently,  following  the  Paris  Agreement,  by  making  more  room  for  nuclear  and \nrenewable  forms  of  energy,  which  produce  little  carbon  dioxide  (Kim  2017).  The \nRepublic  of  Korea  is  the  13th  largest  country  in  economy  size,  while  it  is  9th  in \npetroleum consumption and 8th in electricity consumption in the world, as of 2014 \n(Greenhouse Gas Inventory & Research Center of Korea [GIR] 2017; Korea Energy \nAgency [KEA] 2017).  \nThe Republic of Korea has pursued full-scale green growth since 2008. Green finance \nnewly  emerged  in  2009,  and  the  development  of  related  policies  has  involved \ndiscussions on how to finance green growth as well as green industry. As green \nfinance  policies,  the  Republic  of  Korea  introduced  the  environmental  information \ndisclosure  system  and  the  emission  trading  scheme  (ETS)  in  2013  and  2015, \nrespectively. The environmental information disclosure system aims to disclose mainly \ncorporate  environmental  performance  to  the  public  and  to  enable  the  public  and \ninvestors to understand, assess, and invest selectively for effectiveness as well as \nefficiency. The government introduced the ETS with the purpose of effectively reducing \nthe  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  of  companies  through  the  capital  market \nmechanism. In the capital market, it launched the Korea stewardship code to boost the \nresponsible investment of institutional investors in 2016, and it anticipates that it will \ncontribute  to  the  effective  GHG  reduction  of  companies  through  the  engagement \nactivities of institutional investors (UN Environment 2017).  \nNowadays,  the  expansion  of  renewable  energy  and  nuclear-free  electric  power \ngeneration is the subject of debate in the Republic of Korea. The government decided \nto increase its renewable energy and not to increase the nuclear power generation \nfurther  (Public  Opinion  Committee  on  Shin-Gori  Unit  5&6  2017),  as  the  public \nacceptance of nuclear electricity generation is dropping steadily because of its recent \nsafety issues (Lee and Lee 2017), and it will make efforts to accomplish the 20% share \nof  renewable  energy  in  the  total  electricity  generation  in  2030.  However,  the \ngovernment  decided  that  the  nuclear  power  generation  facility  under  construction \nwould be completed on schedule because of its high sunk cost. The safety problem is \ncrucial  in  determining  the  expansion  of  nuclear  power  generation,  though  nuclear \nenergy is particularly advantageous in the reduction of carbon dioxide: carbon dioxide \nemissions per capita decrease by 0.26\u20130.32% as the share of nuclear generation \nincreases  by  1%,  and  the  social  benefit  from  one  nuclear  generation  facility  is \nestimated to be KRW 13~20 trillion (Lee and Lee 2016). \nAnother major concern in the Republic of Korea is fine and ultra-fine dusts. As their \nconcentrations continue to increase and the Republic of Korea records the worst ultra-\nfine dust among the OECD countries (OECD 2017), the government produced its fine \nand ultra-fine dust reduction plan (Korean Government, 2016a, 2016b). One of the \ncritical sources is coal-fueled thermal generation facilities: dust that occurs in firing the \ncoal  covers  the  whole  territory,  worsening  the  atmosphere  (Korean  Government \n2016a). The social consensus is that the government should diminish the use of the \ncriticized coal-fueled thermal generation. However, coal accounts for the largest portion \namong the power generation sources in the Republic of Korea now, so the government \nis considering renewable energy sources as alternatives to coal and has suggested \nfuel  conversion  from  coal  to  cleaner  sources.  In  sum,  it  is  necessary  to  develop \ntechnology  that  can  decouple  the  energy  consumption  and  fine  dust  occurrence  \nfrom the mid- to short-term perspective and convert the production system from the \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nlong-term perspective (Lee and Lee 2017). In addition, Korean people need to be \nenergy  efficient  by  strengthening  personal  norms,  such  as  moral  obligation  and \nattitudes toward environmental/climate change issues, which have a positive impact on \nefficient energy use (Kim 2016a). \nIn this context, this study will identify the green growth and green finance policies at the \ncountry level and provide an understanding of the role of green finance to support  \nlow-carbon green growth along with GHG emission reduction.  \n2.  NATIONAL PLAN TO PREPARE  \nFOR CLIMATE CHANGE \nThe government has tried to prepare for climate change since 1998. It first established \na master plan to prepare the climate change agreement in 1998 for the period from \n1999 to 2001, and most recently it provided the third plan effective for the period from \n2005 to 2007 (KEA 2017). The three plans focused on constructing the infrastructure \nfor GHG emission reduction, and then the master plan, aiming to prepare for climate \nchange, substituted them with the five-year term 2008 to 2012 (Korean Government \n2016c). It first released the five-year green growth plan in 2009 as an efficient and \nsystematic approach to the national green growth strategy, and it provided the second \nplan in 2014. The plan developed most recently is the first climate change preparation \nmaster plan, publicly announced in December 2016.  \n2.1  Second Five-Year Green Growth Plan  \n(Office of Government Policy Coordination [OGPC] 2014) \nThe first plan focused on the systemization of green growth: it provided laws and \npolicies such as the Framework Act on Low-Carbon Green Growth, Smart Grid Act, \nGreen Building Act, Emission Trading Act, the plan for climate change preparation,  \nand  the  master  plan  for  sustainable  development,  established  the  Green  Growth \nCommittee in the government in 2009 to push the governmental driving system for \ngreen  growth,  executed  the  renewables  portfolio  standard  (RPS)  since  2012,  and \nintroduced  GHG  and  energy  target  management  in  2010.  The  reduction  of  GHG \nemissions  in  companies  under  the  GHG  and  energy  target  management  scheme \nexceeded the target for GHG emission reduction (Ministry of Environment [MoE] 2014). \nHowever, it showed limitations to sound performance improvement for three reasons: \n1)  the  increasing  trend  of  GHG  emissions  and  the  inactivation  of  green  industry,  \n2) government-led and supply-centered policies, and 3) the shortage of stakeholder \ncommunication and consideration of social equality.  \nThe second plan aimed to supplement the first plan and to settle the low-carbon \neconomic  and  social  structure  under  the  motto  of  inclusive  green  growth,  with  \nfive  policy  directions  for  effective  greenhouse  gas  reduction,  the  construction  of  \na  sustainable  energy  system,  the  establishment  of  a  green  prosperous  industry \necosystem, the embodiment of a sustainable green society, and the reinforcement of \nglobal green collaboration.  \n   \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nFor effective greenhouse gas reduction, the government set up an industrial GHG \nreduction rate and provided specific goals for GHG reduction amounts for industries \nsuch as steelmaking, cement manufacturing, petrochemistry, electrics and electronics, \nand electronic display apparatus, as shown in Table 1 below; as steelmaking and \npetrochemistry industries with high energy consumption introduced or increased their \nfacilities, the energy efficiency worsened (Kim, Lim, and Kim 2015). \nTable 1: Principal Industrial Goals of GHG Reduction \nGoals per Annum \nContent  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \nIndustrial GHG Reduction Rate compared \nwith Business as Usual (BAU) (in %)  1.7  7.9  9.7  11.6  13.7 \nGHG reduction  Steelmaking  206  2,383  3,313  4,264  5,282 \namount  Cement  206  2,383  3,313  4,264  5,282 \n(in thousand \nPetrochemistry  408  1,543  2,010  2,628  3,246 \ntCO2e) \nElectrics and electronics  2,356  12,808  15,194  17,595  20,103 \nElectronic display  1,409  7,500  9,986  13,125  17,120 \napparatus \nSource: OGPC (2014). \nThe government planned to reduce the GHG emissions in the transportation sector  \nby constructing a low-carbon green logistics system, reinforcing the manufacturing  \nand  consumption  of  high-efficiency  and  low-carbon  vehicles,  improving  public \ntransportation, and enhancing power-free and carbon-free vehicle usage. \nThe  government  has  made  efforts  to  expand  the  distributed  power  by  inducing  \nthe installment of private electric generators in industrial complexes, expanding the \ncommunity  energy  supply,  and  diffusing  distributed  renewable  energies,  as  the \nnecessity  for  decentralized  electricity  power  sources  is  becoming  significant  for  \neco-friendly generation as well as the local acceptance of generation and transmission \nfacilities (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 2014, 2015; Park and Jung 2016), and \nestimates indicate that distributed power will account for at least a 15% share of the \ntotal energy in the Republic of Korea, an increase from a 5% share in 2014, which will \nbe  able  to  offset  up  to  50  million  toe,  10%  of  the  annual  aggregated  emission \nallowance. The government supports energy investment of which the energy-saving \neffect turns out to be at least 5% in the energy examination of an energy-saving \ncompany (ESCO) project. \nAs  the  heavy  energy-consuming  economic  structure  is  continuing  despite  the \ngovernmental efforts, the Republic of Korea needs a sustainable energy system. The \nintention of the second plan was to expand the dissemination of renewable energy to \n11%  in  2035  from  3.18%  in  2012,  considering  the  energy  safety,  GHG  emission \nreduction, and so on; however, the current government declared that the share of \nrenewable energy will be 20% in 2030 (OGPC 2017).  \nThe government introduced new policies, such as the RPS in the utility sector, the \nrenewable heat obligation (RHO) in the building construction field, and the renewable \nfuel standard (RFS) in the transportation sector in 2012, 2015, and 2016, respectively, \nin  accordance  with  the  second  plan.  For  the  dissemination  of  renewable  energy,  \nthe  government  will  reform  its  support  policy  and  expand  its  investment.  It  will  \nreform the previous subsidy support policy to incentivize support proportional to the \namount  of  energy  generation.  It  will  expand  its  financial  support  to  technology \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \ncommercialization related to energy or renewables as implemented only for production, \nfacilities, and operation.  \n2.2  Climate Change Preparation Master Plan  \n(Korean Government 2016c) \nIn  June  2015,  the  Republic  of  Korea  submitted  the  intended  national  determined \ncontributions  (INDCs)  to  the  United  Nations;  Table  2  below  illustrates  the  GHG \nemission reduction goal of a 37% reduction compared with the BAU in 2030 and the \nGHG emission reduction goals of principal areas (Korean Government 2015). The \nRepublic of Korea first set its national GHG emission reduction goal to reduce GHG \nemissions by 30% compared with the BAU in 2020 in November 2009, which was the \nhighest  level  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change\u2019s  (IPCC) \nrecommendation for developing countries and represented an expression of strong will \nregarding GHG emission reduction. Therefore, some argued that it had violated the \u201cno \nbacksliding\u201d  principle  for  the  reduction  goal:  the  Republic  of  Korea  had  originally \nplanned to reduce its emissions by 30% compared with the BAU by 2020 in its national \nmaster plan in 2014; moreover, it used the BAU that most developing countries utilize \nin setting the reduction goal. Most developed countries set it in comparison with the \nbaseline (Choi 2015; National Assembly Research Service 2017). The INDCs of the \nRepublic of Korea are very ambitious when applying share indicators, such as the \nshare of cumulative emissions or the share of the GDP, while they are less ambitious \nwhen applying comparative indicators, such as the per capita emissions relative to the \nworld average (Oh 2016). \nTable 2: GHG Emission Reduction Goals of Principal Areas \nArea  Reduction (in Million tCO2e)  Reduction Rate (%) \nUtility  64.5  7.6 \nIndustry  56.4  6.6 \nBuilding  35.8  4.2 \nNew energy industry  28.2  3.3 \nTransportation  25.9  3 \nPublic and others  3.6  0.4 \nWaste  3.6  0.4 \nAgriculture and cattle  1  0.1 \nDomestic reduction  219  25.7 \nForeign reduction  96  11.3 \nSource: Korean Government (2015). \nOn 3 November 2016, the national assembly passed the proposal to ratify the Paris \nAgreement,  which  the  COP21  meeting  had  adopted  in  December  2015,  and  the \nRepublic  of  Korea  became  the  97th  country  to  ratify  the  Paris  Agreement  on  \n3 December 2016.  \nIn this context, the government established the first climate change preparation master \nplan for the next 20 years, 2017~2036, in December 2016 according to the Framework \nAct on Low-Carbon Green Growth. It suggests the mid- to long-term vision as well as \nthe  policy  direction  to  prepare  for  climate  change  effectively  and  to  convert  the \neconomic  structure  from  heavy  energy  exhaustion  to  a  low-carbon  system  at  the \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \ncountry level, providing for a new climate change regime to function positively in the \neconomy. As companies view the preparation for climate change as a burden and just \ncomply passively with the government\u2019s policies, the government will make efforts to \nsupport the development of new technologies as well as new industries intensively \nenough for companies to utilize them as opportunities for market leadership. It will \npromote the realization of a low-carbon society by inducing companies to develop and \ninvest in technologies through mid- to long-term policies for climate change preparation \nand expand the public participation.  \nTo achieve the national GHG reduction goal, a 37% reduction compared with the BAU \nin 2030, the master plan includes an action plan roadmap to accomplish the goal at the \ncountry level and to transit to the low-carbon policy: it raised the RPS duty rate to 7% in \n2020, and the governmental support will lie in the dissemination of renewable energy; it \nwill financially support renewable energy facilities by lowering the loan interest rate; it \nwill promote eco-friendly fuel usage by reinforcing the duty rate of the renewable fuel \nmix to 3.0% in 2020 in the RFS; and it will promote the megawatt market in which \nconsumers can sell their saved electric power to induce voluntary energy saving. \n3.  ENERGY MIX IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA \nThe total primary energy supply (TPES) has increased steadily since 1981, though it \ndecreased in 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, reaching 285,478 thousand toe in \n2015, about 6.3 times the amount in 1981 (see Figure 1). In addition, the ratio of the \nTPES to the gross domestic product (GDP) has been decreasing since 1997, because \nthe increase rate of the GDP is greater than that of the TPES. In addition, estimates \nshow that a 1% increase in energy consumption will increase the economic growth by \n0.093\u20130.104% in East Asian countries, so a reduction in energy consumption may \nharm the economic growth (Kim 2015b). \nFigure 1: TPES in the Republic of Korea since 1981 \n \nData source: Korea Energy Economics Institute (KEEI) (2017). \n   \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nPetroleum  and  coal  account  for  the  largest  and  the  second-largest  share  in  the \ncomposition of energy sources in the Republic of Korea, though the share of petroleum \nis decreasing. The share of petroleum recorded a historical maximum of 62.9% in 1994 \nand then fell to 38.1% in 2015, probably due to its high price. The share of coal has \nexpanded since 1994 and reached 29.7% in 2015, while it was 39.1% at its maximum \nin 1985. As Figure 2 shows, the share of coal decreased as nuclear power generation \nbecame more available in the 1980s. Liquid natural gas (LNG) first appeared as an \nenergy source in 1987, and its share grew steadily to 15.2% in 2015. The share of \nnuclear energy increased from 1.36% in 1981 to 12.1% in 2015, with a maximum of \n16.1% in 2005. As the government makes efforts to reduce the share of coal and \npromote the use of renewables, it anticipates that the use of coal as an energy source \nwill decline and renewable energy will experience a sudden rise. The government will \nnot add further coal-fueled thermal generating facilities and will convert the existing \ncoal-fueled thermal generating facilities into LNG or other eco-friendlier fuels.  \nFigure 2: Shares of Energy Sources \n \nData source: KEEI (2017). \nThis study investigated the energy consumption in four sectors: industry, residential \nand commercial, transportation, and public. Industry has consumed the most energy \namong the four sectors historically, and the transportation sector and the residential \nand commercial sector have historically shown similar energy consumption amounts. \nIndustry has experienced rapid growth in energy consumption due to the growth of \nenergy-intensive  industries,  such  as  steelmaking  and  petrochemistry  (International \nEnergy Agency 2013). In 2015, the energy consumed in the transportation sector \namounted to 40.3 million toe and that in the residential and commercial sector to  \n36.4  million  toe.  Since  2014,  transportation  has  consumed  more  energy  than  the \nresidential and commercial area. Petroleum has been consumed most among the \nenergy  sources  over  all  the  sectors  since  2001,  though  its  share  has  been \nchronologically decreasing as electric or hybrid vehicles have been disseminated. The \nshare of the residential and commercial area has declined recently, as its price has \nbeen so high that people have selectively consumed other cheaper sources, such as \nelectricity or city gas. The share of petroleum in the transportation sector will diminish \nwith the positive diffusion of electric or hybrid vehicles after all.  \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nFigure 3: Energy Consumption in Four Areas \n \nData source: KEEI (2017). \nThe  production  amounts  of  new  and  renewable  energy  have  been  increasing \ncontinuously so far, and the production amount of renewable energy is much larger \nthan that of new energy (see Figure 4 below).1  \nFigure 4: New and Renewable Energy Production \n \nData source: KEEI (2017). \n                                                 \n1  Renewable energy includes solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, wind power, hydro power, which has \nincluded large-hydro (larger than 10 MW) since 2003 and excludes pumped-storage (hydro), ocean, \ngeothermal, bio, which consists of bio gas, landfill gas (LFG), bio diesel, wood chips and pellets, wood \nbriquettes, fire wood, waste wood, black liquor, sewage solid fuel, bio-solid refuse fuel (SRF), bio \nbunkers, and waste, which includes waste gas, industrial waste, living waste, municipal solid waste, \ncement kiln fuel, refuse-derived fuel (RDF)/refuse plastic and paper fuel (RPF)/tire-derived fuel (TDF), \nSRF, refinery fuel oil, and wood waste, by energy source, and new energy includes fuel cells and the \nintegrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) (KEEI 2017). \n7 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nAmong the renewable energy sources, waste took the largest share of 64.6% in 2015, \nfollowed by bio resources, and recorded 78% in 2008 as its maximum. Bio resources \nincreased to 24.9% in 2014. The share of hydro power shrank from 23.6% in 2004 to \n3.5% in 2015, because a hydro generating facility had not been developed and other \nrenewably sourced facilities were increasing. Solar photovoltaic power is increasingly \nbeing adopted in both industry and houses.  \nFigure 5: Chronological Shares in Renewable Energy \n(%) \n \nData source: KEEI (2017). \nIn  particular,  the  local  autonomous  bodies  and  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  central \ngovernment offer subsidies for installing small photovoltaic generation apparatus in \nhomes. Hydro thermal, ocean, wind power, solar thermal, and geothermal power do  \nnot  have  meaningful  shares  now,  though  the  adoption  of  geothermal  power  has  \nbeen increasing.  \nAs far as the electricity mix is concerned, the three major electricity sources are coal, \nLNG, and nuclear. Their shares in 2013 were 38.8, 24.7, and 26.8%, respectively. The \nshare of coal has increased since 1998 to over 30% and recorded a maximum of \n44.6% in 2009. The share of nuclear reached its maximum of 53.1% in 1987 and then \ngradually declined to 26.8% because of the expansion of the consumption of other \nsources, such as coal, LNG, and others.

Companies can understand their \nenvironmental risk state and find ways to overcome it via the evaluation report, and the \nsystem defines companies with outstanding environmental management as those with \nan outstanding grade in enVinance or those that have received the grand prize in \nenvironmental management; they are treated preferentially and awarded extra points in \nthe policy correspondence area in the environmental policy fund evaluation process. \nThe operator, the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI), aims to \nexpand the usefulness of enVinance for financial institutions. It is favorable for financial \ninstitutions to make investment decisions utilizing enVinance rather than decisions  \non  corporate  loans.  Seven  Korean  commercial  banks  among  the  Korean  financial \ninstitutions have joined enVinance as of 2017 and have made efforts to utilize it in \nfinancial products. The KEITI will expand the participation of financial institutions to \ninsurance companies, as until now only commercial banks have joined.

The Framework  \nAct on Low-Carbon Green Growth legislated in 2009 stipulates the introduction of the \n\u201ccap and trade\u201d ETS. The government implemented the ETS act in 2012. Companies \nwith 3-year average GHG emissions of over 125,000 tCO e or facilities with 3-year \n2\naverage GHG emissions of over 25,000 tCO e are designated ETS objects. There \n2\nwere 525 companies in 25 industry sectors2 as ETS objects in January 2015 and 549 \nin January 2017 (Kim and Shim 2017). Offset credit is available so that entities can \noffset the emission amount as much as their overseas carbon emission reduction. In \n2015 and 2016, the scheme certified 100 offset credits. \nThe Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MoSF) reallocates the GHG emissions to entities \nparticipating in the ETS every 5 years based on the 5-year GHG emission amounts, but \nit planned the second allocation 3 years after the ETS\u2019s launch, that is, in 2017 (MoSF \n2014). It publicly announced the reallocation of the emission amounts on 30 November \n2017 (MoSF 2017). The total allocated emissions increased by 17,631,757 Korean \nAllowance Units (KAUs), consisting of the increase in the preallocated emissions of \n17,014,932 tCO e and the reserved emissions of 616,825 tCO e; more specifically, the \n2 2\nindustry has the largest increase rate of 4.7%, much larger than 1.08% for energy and \n1.96% for transportation (MoSF 2017). However, the Ministry excluded the city gas \nindustry, which is a substitute for district heating, from the emission trading, equal to \nallocating unlimited emission credits free of charge to the city gas sector, which will not \nonly be a matter of equity but will also hinder the efficient allocation of resources in the \nheating market (Oh 2017). \nThe closing price of the KAU has risen rapidly to about 3.6 times its initial price, from \nKRW 7,860 in February 2015 to KRW 28,000 in June 2018. It rose from KRW 8,000 to \n20,850 in January 2017 and from KRW 23,900 to 28,000 in June 2018, though there \nwere few transactions by 2016. As time passes, the pressure to reduce the GHG \nemissions will become more intense and the price will rise more than ever. Figure 9 \nbelow illustrates the closing price and trading volume of the KAU since 2017. As \nshown, the price of the KAU has been over KRW 20,000 since February 2017, and a \nlarge demand emerged recently.  \nThe Korean Credit Unit (KCU) has been transacted since April 2017 with the price of \nKRW 19,600, and its price is KRW 21,800 as of 29 June 2018, which is much more \nstatic than the price of the KAU (see Figure 10). The transaction of the Korean Offset \nCredit (KOC) started on 23 May 2016, at the price of KRW 18,500, and its recent price \nwas KRW 26,000.

The investment in environmental conservation facilities will be \ndeducted from the tax amount, and the government will support 50% of the cost of the \ninstallation  of  best  available  technology  (BAT)  facilities  or  manufacturing  process \nimprovements.  \nThe  Korea  Exchange  is  making  efforts  to  develop  the  emission  trading  market \ninformation platform to provide integrated emission information that it will distribute  \nto  several  agencies  in  2018.  SK  Securities  contracted  a  business  collaboration  \nto  disseminate  high-efficiency  stoves  to  Bangladeshi  households  as  a  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) project and import the certified emission reduction \n(CER) in 2018 (Green Economy Daily 2018c). The expectation is that this will save  \n2.4 million tCO e of GHG over five years. It became possible as the government \n2\nregulation has changed to let domestic companies import the CER of their foreign GHG \nreduction projects.  \nThe ETS is known as a political means to accomplish the given GHG reduction goal in \nthe most cost-efficient manner; however, it is possible in ideal market conditions with \nno  market  distortion,  and  estimates  indicate  that  the  Korean  ETS  is  weak,  with \ntransaction costs, market dominance, and price risk as market distortion factors (Shim \nand Lee 2015). The Green Growth Committee has suggested that companies can \npurchase cheap reduction means through the market mechanism in the ETS, saving \nthe  cost  of  32%  to  56%  compared  with  target  management  (Choi  2011).  It  has \nsuggested the differentiation of criteria for companies or places of business considering \nindustrial features rather than the current uniform criterion regardless of the industry \nsector and free allocation of certified emission reduction (CER) with the benchmark \napproach to efficiency (Kim 2015a). The petroleum industry has improved the efficiency \nof  its  GHG  reduction  since  2013,  more  through  the  ETS  than  through  target \nmanagement (Kim and Noh 2016). The ETS can also affect the electricity market under \nthe 7th electricity supply and demand master plan: coal generation will fall if the CER \nprice rises, but, if the CER price is too high, it will cause an increase in the electricity \n19 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nprice  (Lee  2015a).  The  voluntary  participation  of  companies  is  essential  for  the \nsuccessful settlement of the ETS, and it is necessary for them to make investors aware \nof  their  activities  toward  climate  change  through  effective  publicity  about  climate \nchange response activities, which may lead to a positive effect on corporate value (Kim \n2016a).  It  is  important  to  include  the  basic  directions  for  the  reduction  using  the \ninternational carbon market in the preparation of the roadmap for GHG reduction in the \nRepublic of Korea in the future (Lee 2016b). \nTable 10: Industry Sectors of the KAU Allocation with Payment \nNo.  Industry Sectors \n1  Electric Power Generation \n2  Slaughtering of Livestock, Processing, Preserving of Meat and Meat Products \n3  Manufacture of Dairy Products and Edible Ice Cakes \n4  Manufacture of Other Food Products \n5  Manufacture of Alcoholic Beverages \n6  Manufacture of Ice and Non-alcoholic Beverages, Production of Mineral Waters \n7  Dyeing and Finishing Textiles \n8  Manufacture of Wood Products  \n9  Manufacture of Plastic Products \n10  Manufacture of Articles of Concrete, Cement, and Plaster \n11  Cast of Metals \n12  Manufacture of Other Fabricated and Processed Metal Products  \n13  Telecommunications \n14  Computer Programming, Consultancy, and Related Activities  \n15  Information Service Activities \n16  Retail Sale in Non-specialized Stores \n17  Accommodation \n18  Insurance \n19  Real Estate Activities with Own or Leased Property \n20  Administration of Industrial and Social Policy of Community \n21  Universities \n22  Hospital Activities \n23  Amusement and Theme Park Operation \n24  Air Transport (Domestic) \n25  Sewage, Wastewater, and Human Waste Treatment Services \n26  Water Supply \nSource: MoE (2018). \nIn 2018, the management authority of the ETS changed from the MoSF to the MoE, \nand the MoE announced the 2nd KAU allocation plan on 12 July 2018. The major \nchanges are 1) allocation with payment for 26 industry sectors, 2) expansion of the \napplication of the BM method in allocating the KAUs, and 3) more specified industry \nsectors from the 2nd level to the 3rd level of the KSIC. The industry sectors are more \ndetailed because several companies appeared to be disadvantaged (MoE 2018). Some \nhad criticized the class cation of the manufacturing of cement, lime, and plaster and the \nmanufacturing of articles of concrete, ready-mixed concrete, and other cement and \nplaster products in the 3rd level of the KSIC but the manufacturing of cement, lime, \n20 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nplaster, and its products in the 2nd level, so they were originally among the industries \nfor KAU allocation with payment; with the application of the 3rd level of the KSIC, the \nmanufacturers of cement will receive their allocation of the KAU with no payment.4 To \nresolve this unfair problem, the MoE specified industries further from 25 to 63 sectors; \nit selected 26 sectors according to the 3rd level of the KSIC as the objects of the KAU \nallocation with payment, as Table 10 illustrates. The companies in the 26 industry \nsectors should purchase 3% of the allowance, and it is estimated that an additional \ncost of KRW 4.5 trillion will occur for 3 years (MoE 2018).  \nIn addition, public financial institutions, such as the Korea Development Bank, the \nKorea  Exim  Bank,  and  the  Industrial  Bank  of  Korea,  will  take  the  role  of  market \nprovider, 5 and 14 million tCO e are set as slack for market liquidity and for market \n2\nstability,  respectively,  and  the  application  of  the  benchmark  allocation  method  is \nexpanding to increase the allocation of more KAUs to high-efficiency facilities, as the \ngrandfathering method is disadvantageous to high-efficiency facilities (MoE 2018).  \n5.6  Green Bonds and Funds  \nA green bond is differentiated from a regular bond by its label, that is, its designation as \ngreen from the issuer or another entity, which involves a commitment  to use the \nproceeds  or  green  bonds  in  a  transparent  manner  and  to  finance  or  refinance \nexclusively green projects, assets, or business activities with an environmental benefit \n(OECD 2015). Another entity can apply a green bond label to a bond via its inclusion in \na green bond index, such as the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Green Bond Index, \nBarclays MSCI Green Bond Index, S&P Green Bond Index and Green Project Bond \nIndex, and Solactive Green Bond Index, or through a tag on analytical tools that are \nwidely used in financial markets, such as the Bloomberg Terminal (OECD 2015).  \nDifferent from other countries, green bonds in the Republic of Korea are not sovereign \nbonds but a kind of public or corporate bond to invest in environmental projects or \nrenewable energy, so the fund size is relatively small. The MoSF has announced that it \nhas no plan to issue sovereign green bonds yet, as of March 2018 (Etoday 2018).  \nGreen  bonds  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  are  booming  again.  They  boomed  as  the \ngovernment announced the reduction of the share of nuclear power generation as  \nwell  as  the  increase  in  the  share  of  new  and  renewable  energy  in  2017.  The \nexpectation is that a large amount of funds will be necessary to expand the share of \nnew and renewable energy for several years, as the government will increase the \npower generation by new and renewable energy from 17 GW in 2017 to 67 GW in 2030 \n(Construction Economy News 2017). \nKorean public institutions have played an important role in issuing green bonds. The \nKorea Exim Bank created a green bond of USD 500 million to invest in environmental \nimprovement projects as well as renewable energy in 2013 (Green Economy Daily \n2013). The Korea Exim Bank also issued a green bond of USD 400 million in March \n2018, and the Korea Development Bank, which subscribed to the Equator Principle in \nJanuary 2017, issued and listed a green bond of KRW 300 billion on the KOSPI, which \nis the first Arirang green bond (Green Economy Daily 2018b; Korea Exchange 2018). \nThe Korea Exchange is making efforts to list the Arirang green bond in the stock \nmarket.  The  Korea  Water  Resources  Corporation  issued  a  water  bond,  a  kind  of  \ngreen bond, of USD 300 million, which is the first water bond in Asia, in 2017 (Green \nEconomy Daily 2018a).  \n                                                 \n4  http://news1.kr/articles/?3358778. \n21 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nTable 11: Green bond Issuance in Republic of Korea \nNo.  Issuer   Issue Date  Size  Listing \n1  Korea Exim Bank  20 February 2013  USD 500 million   SGX \n2  2 February 2016  USD 400 million  SGX \n3  Hyundai Capital  7 March 2016  USD 500 million  SGX \n4  Korea Development Bank  27 Jun 2017  USD 300 million  SGX \n5  Hanjin International  25 September 2017   USD 300 million  SGX \n6  Korea Exim Bank  8 March 2018   USD 400 million  TPEx, SGX \n7  Korea Water Resources Corporation  8 May 2018  USD 300 million  SGX \n8  Korea Development Bank  29 May 2018  KRW 300 billion  KRX \nSGX denotes the Singapore Stock Exchange, TPEx denotes the Taipei Stock Exchange, and KRX denotes the  \nKorea Exchange. \nSource: Korea Exchange (2018). \nRecently, the Korea Land & Housing Corporation obtained certification as a qualified \nsocial  green  bond  issuer  by  Sustainalytics  in  2018  and  made  efforts  to  issue  a  \nsocial green bond (Dailian 2018). The Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and  \nthe  East  and  West  Power  Corporation  (EWPC)  will  try  to  create  green  bonds  of  \nUSD 500 million each. The KEPCO and EWPC will issue green bonds to invest in the \nnew and renewable energy and ESS (Korea Economic Daily 2018). Furthermore, the \nIndustrial Bank of Korea is now seeking to issue a social bond of USD 500 million  \n(The bell 2018). \nIn the private sector, Hyundai Capital first created a green bond of USD 500 million to \nsupport hybrid vehicle purchases financially in 2016, and it received the award from \nThe Asset for the best Korean green bond in 2017 (Climate Bonds Initiative 2018; \nDongailbo  2017).  The  Hanjin  International  Corporation  issued  a  green  bond  of  \nUSD 300 million to invest in its own eco-friendly building in 2017 (Climate Bonds \nInitiative 2018). \nEstimates indicate that the green bond size will be about KRW 2.67 trillion in 2018, \nwhich is larger than the total ESG bond size, KRW 2.15 trillion, issued by 2017 (Korea \nEconomic Daily 2018). In addition, green bonds are following the trend to expand their \ncoverage to the environment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG), so some \nrefer to ESG bonds. Thus, the green bond market is spreading very fast to keep pace \nwith the domestic policy to reduce the nuclear and enhance the new and renewable \npower generation and the global trend of increasing ESG bonds. \nAs far as green funds are concerned, the National Pension Service (NPS) invested \nKRW 200 billion in two green private equity funds (PEFs) to invest in the domestic \ngreen infrastructure, such as renewable energy electricity generation, waste facilities, \nand so forth, in 2017 (Chosunilbo 2017), and the Korea Scientists and Engineers \nMutual-Aid Association (SEMA) invested KRW 40 billion in a green fund in which \nlargest investor is the NPS (The bell 2017). Financial institutions, in particular domestic \ninstitutions, have been making efforts to create funds related to new and renewable \nenergy,  as  the  government  has  been  trying  to  increase  the  share  of  new  and \nrenewable energy power generation to 20% of the total power generation: the Shinhan \nFinancial  Group  and  the  KB  Financial  Group  created  new  and  renewable  energy  \nblind funds with sizes of KRW 100 billion and 150 billion in 2017, respectively, and KDB \nInfra  Asset  Management  is  managing  a  solar  photovoltaic  investment  fund  sized  \nKRW 350 billion (Construction Economy News 2017).  \n  \n22 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \n5.7  Incentives for and Barriers to Green Financing  \nin the Republic of Korea \nSince the government declared the decrease in nuclear energy and the increase in \nnew and renewable energy in 2017, green finance has progressed more than ever, \nfocusing on new and renewable energy. The government has actively implemented \nproject financing in large-sized solar photovoltaic energy generation facilities to achieve \nstable profitability. The KEPCO will purchase the electricity generated in the facilities \nunder the preannounced unit price within the given years; although the unit price is \nexperiencing a downturn, it does not greatly affect the profitability.  \nAlong with the private sector\u2019s green financing, the government is seeking to support \ncompanies or facilities related to the environment and energy financially through loan \nprograms with a low interest rate. The public loan program is suitable for firms or \nfacilities  that  find  a  way  to  become  eco-friendly  or  energy  efficient.  The  current \nmainstream in green financing is still loans with a lower interest rate in the Republic of \nKorea. Though it can offer economic benefits as much as the difference between \ngeneral and preferentially treated loan interest rates, it might enable rich companies to \nbecome richer, because only rich companies can drive environmental projects and \nreceive financial support from the government. The government focuses on stability \nrather than risk taking, so it never invests in companies with potential ability but lends \nmoney to financially stable companies with preferential treatment and a lower interest \nrate.  However,  the  government  should  adopt  a  risk-taking  position  to  invest  in \ncompanies with potential business ability, despite the fact that they are not financially \nstable now.  \nThe largest barrier to green financing in the Republic of Korea is the lack of public \ninterest in green growth. People have little interest in the environment but think that \neconomic growth or profit is more important for now. The lack of public interest does \nnot cause a significant increase in corporate value as well as market efficiency in the \ncapital market. Furthermore, companies participating in the ETS have urged the MoSF \nto extend the allocated amount before launching the ETS. Korean companies with \nheavy GHG emissions, which have participated in the ETS or GHG emission target \nmanagement system, should willingly make efforts to reduce the GHG emissions under \ntheir own plans, which are stricter than the national plan. The MoE (2018) recently \nannounced the KAU allocation plan for 2018 to 2020, including the allocation with \npayment. However, in the meantime, it cautiously anticipates opposition from industries \nregarding the allocation with payment in particular. Public interest in the environment or \nenergy  can  heal  this  phenomenon  by  allowing  companies  with  outstanding \nenvironmental  performance  or  GHG  emission  reduction  to  enjoy  corporate  value \nenhancement in the capital market. Private companies pursuing profits will seek to \nenhance  their  corporate  value  by  positively  improving  and  disclosing  their  eco-\nfriendliness or energy efficiency.  \nThe OECD (2015) illustrated the advantages as well as the disadvantages of green \nbonds, as Table 12 below shows. As investors are requested to be sustainable, that is \nto say, to meet the ESG requirements, it is possible to achieve that via green bonds, \nwhich  provide  a  fixed  income,  so  it  is  necessary  to  facilitate  the  development  of \nenvironmental projects and the creation of a green bond base for them (OECD 2015).  \n   \n23 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nTable 12: Advantages and Disadvantages of Green Bonds \nAdvantages  Disadvantages \n\u2212  Investors can balance risk-adjusted financial  \u2212  Small and nascent (and potentially less \nreturns with environmental benefits.  liquid) market with small bond sizes. \n\u2212  Satisfy ESG requirements and green investment  \u2212  Lack of unified standards can raise \nmandates.  confusion and the possibility of \n\u2212  Improved risk assessment in an otherwise  reputational risk if the green integrity of a \nopaque fixed-income market through the use of  bond is questioned.  \nproceeds reporting.  \u2212  Limited scope for legal enforcement of \n\u2212  Potential use of pure-play, project, and ABD to  green integrity. \nhedge actively against climate policy risks in a  \u2212  Lack of standardization can lead to \nportfolio that includes emission-intensive assets.  complexities in research and a need for \n\u2212  Recognized by the UNFCCC as a non-state  extra due diligence that may not always be \nactor: \u201cclimate action.\u201d  fulfilled. \nSource: OECD (2015). \nThe Climate Bonds Initiative (2018) summarized the strength and barriers to the growth \nof the green bond market in the Republic of Korea, as Table 13 shows. The capital \nmarket in has strength in the system, and the government\u2019s strong drive toward green \ngrowth is a good investment opportunity now. It should sustain this growing interest in \ngreen bonds continuously and eliminate the barriers to the growth of green finance.  \nTable 13: Strengths and Barriers in the Korean Green Bond Market \nStrength  \u2022  Strong and functioning bond market \n\u2022  Bankable projects and robust project pipeline \n\u2022  Strong investor base \n\u2022  Supportive policy on climate change \nBarriers to  \u2022  Lack of market awareness from issuers  \nGrowth  \u2022  Lack of awareness among investors \n\u2022  Lack of market guidance or standards, which can cause confusion in the local \nmarket around the types of assets or projects that can be considered green. \nGlobally accepted standards, such as the Climate Bonds Standard, can help in \nthis regard \n\u2022  Slightly higher transaction costs for green bond issuers  \n\u2022  Barriers to issuing internationally are present for all bond issuers in Korea \nSource: Climate Bonds Initiative (2018). \nHowever, the small green bond market size is the most disadvantageous aspect in the \nRepublic of Korea. Green bonds require further facilitation, because a large amount of \nfunds is needed to accomplish the national goal of an increase in new and renewable \nenergy.  It  is  necessary  for  the  government  to  support  the  infrastructure  of  green  \nbonds and to promote their issuance by financially sound companies. In addition, it is \nimportant to foster domestic agencies to appraise green bonds according to the global \nstandard, and this will ease the access to the issuance of green bonds. \n5.8  Impact: Financing Flows and the Diffusion of Renewables \nThe  government  is  making  efforts  to  disseminate  renewable  energy  by  financially \nsupporting it through loans and subsidies. It will sustain this effort in the future, as  \nthe economic profit from renewable energy is one of the most critical factors in the \nrenewable  energy  business.  For  home  use  of  renewable  energy,  subsidies  are  a \nparticularly  influential  and  important  component  in  determining  the  installation  of \n24 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nrenewable energy apparatus. A cautious estimate is that the subsidies will rise more \nthan ever to boost the installation and achieve the GHG reduction goal in a shorter \nperiod than predicted.  \nProject  financing  has  been  popular  for  renewable  energy,  particularly  large  solar \nphotovoltaic power generation, due to KEPCO\u2019s stable purchase of electricity for the \nnext 20 years. The major participants in project financing are financial institutions such \nas  banks,  insurance  companies  and  securities  companies,  and  PEFs.  As  far  as \ndistributed solar photovoltaic power generation for homes is concerned, the principal \nfinancial  supporter  is  the  government,  both  centrally  and  locally.  The  government \nsupports  a  maximum  of  about  90%  of  the  total  installation  cost.  However,  more \nrenewable energy generation plants are needed to meet the demand without additional \nconstruction of nuclear power generation facilities, so public and private investment in \nrenewable energy will be more active than ever.  \nIn  addition,  the  government  will  enhance  the  investment  in  renewable  energy \ntechnology development. The yield rate is critical, as it determines the economic profit \nlevel. A 50% improvement in the yield rate can create a larger economic profit than \nbefore, and the economic profit will make people and companies competitively adopt \nrenewable energy apparatus or facilities. The development of highly energy-efficient \ntechnology  is  also  a  field  that  will  receive  subsidies.  Products  with  low  electricity \nconsumption reduce the total electricity consumption and decrease the necessity of \nadditional power generation facilities. In the transportation sector, electric or hybrid \nvehicles will be disseminated more to the public to diminish the petroleum dependency. \nIt is widely known that the petroleum dependency in the transportation sector is the \ngreatest among the industry sectors. A decrease in the petroleum dependency directly \ncauses a GHG emission reduction. Therefore, the government will make efforts to \npromote the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles by offering larger subsidies.  \n6.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \nThe Republic of Korea is the 7th-largest emitter of GHGs in the world; however, the \nKorean environmental and energy policies are not well motivated to reduce the GHG \nemissions and to prepare for climate change. GHG emissions have been increasing \nproportional to economic growth, and the per capita GHG emissions are still increasing. \nIt is time to provide a direct policy to reduce the GHG emissions. Korean people  \nneed to be energy efficient by strengthening personal norms such as moral obligation \nand  attitudes  toward  environmental/climate  change  issues,  which  have  a  positive \nimpact  on  encouraging  people  to  use  energy  efficiently  (Kim  2016b).  Various \nsupportive plans should be provided for the energy efficiency improvement, which the \ngovernment can emphasize as a means to reduce the GHG emissions in the Republic \nof Korea\u2019s industrial and power sector (Lee 2016c). In addition to energy efficiency \nR&D investment, a well-balanced combination of relevant technology diffusion and \nwell-designed R&D programs is necessary to obtain the real effect of R&D investment \nin energy efficiency (Shim 2016). It is also necessary to expand the dissemination of \nrenewable energy apparatus for home use to meet the goal of a 20% share, though \nthis  requires  substantial  funding.  It  is  important  to  enable  every  home  to  be \nindependent from the national electricity distribution. Every entity in the Republic of \nKorea  should  have  energy  independence  at  a  certain  level,  including  persons, \ncompanies, buildings, facilities, and so forth.  \n \n25 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nGreen finance is very conducive to accomplishing the national goal, in particular the \ndissemination of renewable energy. Until new and renewable forms of energy attain a \ncertain  level  of  economic  feasibility,  efforts  are  needed  from  the  government,  the \nmarket participants, and the public (Lee 2016a). Public financial support from the local \nand central government aims to diffuse the use of renewable energy at home, hybrid \nand electric vehicles, and renewable energy facilities for existing companies. Mainly \nPEFs and green bonds have provided new renewable energy facilities. To spur the \ndissemination of renewable energy, the expansion of public financial support is crucial. \nGreen bond issuance of private companies has emerged and needs expansion. The \ngovernment will provide the supportive infrastructure for the issuance of green bonds, \nsuch as guarantees of public financial institutions and tax incentives. It should foster \ngreen bond appraisal agencies. As far as the ETS is concerned, it should avoid a \nchange in the competent authority to allow successful and stable settlement. Since \n2018, the MoE has taken charge of the ETS again, instead of the MoSF. This affects \nthe consistency of the policy. The KAU allocation plan of the MoE (2018) revealed the \nallocation with payment and mentioned that it estimates it to be about KRW 4.7 trillion \nat  its  maximum  and  that  it  will  utilize  it  to  support  financially  the  GHG  emission \nreduction activities of companies participating in the ETS. In addition, the role of the \ngovernment  is  crucial,  as  it  allocates  the  credit  allowance  to  companies.  Proper \nallocation can lead firms to reduce their GHG emissions effectively. However, loose \nallocation decreases their efforts to reduce their GHG emissions, so it is important to \nidentify  the  appropriate  allocation  amount  to  induce  firms  to  reduce  their  GHG \nemissions  with  no  resistance.  The  government  should  use  \u201ccarrots  and  sticks\u201d \nappropriately to achieve sound congruence between the government and the firms. \nFurthermore, it is necessary to improve the public interest in green finance. \u201cGo green\u201d \nneeds green finance as well as green purchases. Green finance is the first move \ntoward a green public. It is necessary for the public to understand that their green \nfinance activities can change the society and to participate in various green finance \nactivities. In particular, investors will change the environmental or energy efficiency \nperformance  of  listed  firms  if  they  tend  to  invest  in  listed  firms  with  outstanding \nenvironmental performance or energy efficiency or to withdraw their investment in listed \nfirms with poor environmental performance or energy efficiency. Financial institutions \nshould make efforts to provide the public with various green finance options, and the \ngovernment  should  provide  green  finance  participants  with  more  incentives.  The \ngovernment  had  provided  a  tax  exemption  incentive  for  qualified  green  deposits, \nbonds, and funds; however, no financial institutions have offered the public green \nfinancial instruments with tax exemption. If there are problems in resolving in the policy, \nthe government should improve the policy enough for green financial instruments to be \nimplemented effectively. If financial institutions are not willing to become involved in \ngreen finance, it is necessary to provide incentives for the financial institutions that \nintroduce the best green finance. It is time to improve the green finance policy for better \nimplementation, as people consider green finance in the Republic of Korea to be more \nsocially important to keep pace with the national energy mix plan.  \nThe government declared that it would achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in \nelectricity generation by 2030, though it has not provided and publicly announced the \naction  plan  yet.  The  gist  is  that  it  will  not  construct  additional  nuclear  generating \nfacilities, although it will complete facilities that are currently undergoing construction, \nand that it will not add more coal-fueled thermal generating facilities and will change \nthe fuel from coal to other cleaner resources. However, the national plan for green \nfinance is not available yet either, as the specific action plan is not complete. If the \ngovernment provides a specific action plan, it will cover the structure of the support \nfunction of green finance and its implementation in detail.   \n26 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 897  Oh and Kim \n \nREFERENCES \nAhn, Na Kyung. 2017. \u201cDirection of R&D Investment through Analyzing the Value \nChain of New and Renewable Energy: Focusing on Photovoltaic, Wind Power \nGeneration and Fuel Cell.\u201d KETEP Insight (August).

However, use of these schemes has not increased dramatically, as the public sector has taken the major role in green finance. Nowadays, green finance is expanding as the Government of the Republic of Korea is making efforts to change the energy mix by decreasing the share of nuclear energy and increasing that of new and renewable energy. The private sector is also attempting to revitalize green finance in the Republic of Korea, such as through commercial banks, private equity funds, and so forth. Changing the energy mix needs huge funds, so the government alone cannot be responsible; the government is seeking to reach this goal in combination with private firms. In this context, the motivation of the Korean people to adopt eco-friendliness and energy efficiency through green financing, public or private, is necessary, together with industrial support from the government or financial institutions.", "Title": "Green Finance in the Republic of Korea: Barriers and Solutions"}}
