Signs of incipient recovery near the turn of this year were quickly overthrown as \nCOVID-19 broke out in January 2020 in the region\u2019s largest economy and subsequently expanded into a \nglobal pandemic. Disruption to regional and global supply chains, trade, and tourism, and the continued \nspread of the outbreak, leave the region reeling under massive economic shocks and \ufb01 nancial turmoil. \nAcross Asia, the authorities are responding with policies to contain the outbreak, facilitate medical \ninterventions, and support vulnerable businesses and households. Assuming that the outbreak is contained \nthis year, growth is expected to recover in 2021.\n\nEspecially to face down fundamental threats such as the current medical emergency, innovation is critical \nto growth and development. As some economies in developing Asia challenge the innovation frontier, \nmany others lag. More and better innovation is needed in the region to sustain growth that is more \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable. Five key drivers of innovation are sound education, productive \nentrepreneurship, high-quality institutions, effi  cient \ufb01 nancial systems, and dynamic cities that excite \nknowledge exchange. The journey to creating an innovative society takes long-term commitment and \nhard\u00a0work.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c, \nwhile\u00a0sustaining its eff  orts to eradicate extreme poverty.

The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) \nis disrupting people\u2019s lives and interrupting business and other economic activities around \nthe world. Developing Asia will weaken tremendously due to the pandemic, considering the \nregion\u2019s deep integration with the global economy through tourism, trade, and remittances. \nPlummeting commodity prices are also placing a severe burden on some countries. \nAs\u00a0the\u00a0disease spreads and strict measures are imposed to contain it, rapidly undermining \ndomestic demand and the external environment, we forecast regional growth declining \nfrom 5.2% last year to 2.2% in 2020. Growth will rebound to 6.2% in 2021, assuming that \nthe\u00a0pandemic ends this year and activity promptly normalizes. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income \nnewly industrialized economies\u2014Hong\u00a0Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nand Taipei,China\u2014growth will drop from 5.7% to 2.4% this year before recovering to 6.7% \nnext\u00a0year.\n\nGrowth could underperform these already lowered forecasts, as the pandemic poses \ndownside risks. Outbreaks could worsen in more countries, and containing them could take \nlonger than currently projected. Our research sees global losses from COVID-19 ranging \nfrom $2.0 trillion to $4.1 trillion, equal to 2.3%\u20134.8% of global GDP. It should be noted \nthat the estimate does not take into account such factors as supply disruptions, interrupted \nremittances, urgent health-care costs, and potential financial disruptions, as well as \nlong-term effects on education and the economy.\n\nTo mitigate these losses, effective response requires decisiveness, agility, coordination, \n\nand vigilance from policy makers and institutions throughout the region and around the \nworld. The Asian Development Bank has been supporting our clients, both governments and \nthe private sector, from the early stages of the crisis and stands ready to provide further \nsupport in collaboration with other international organizations such as the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nIn the midst of such unprecedented economic disruption, innovative thinking is vital \n\nto overcome the current difficulties and rebound quickly. The ability to think up new \nsolutions is necessary to restore developing Asia to its impressive growth path over the \npast decade. With this in mind, our theme chapter discusses the strong progress Asia has \nalready made in\u00a0fostering innovation. It argues for even greater efforts to advance the \nregion\u2019s transformation from middle income to high income, while achieving more inclusive \nand sustainable growth. It highlights and explicates the crucial roles of sound education, \ninnovative entrepreneurship, strong institutions, well-developed financial markets, and \ndynamic cities in fostering innovation.\n\nI sincerely hope that Asian Development Outlook 2020, with its near-term economic \nperspective and medium- to long-term policy recommendations, will be useful for policy \nmakers in Asia and the Pacific toward developing economic and social policies to overcome \nthe crisis, and to make each country even more resilient, innovative, and inclusive. \n\nMASATSUGU ASAKAWA\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nAsian Development Outlook 2020 was prepared by staff of Asian Development \nBank (ADB) regional departments and resident missions under the guidance \nof the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD). \nRepresentatives of these departments met regularly as the Regional \nEconomic\u00a0Outlook Task\u00a0Force to coordinate and develop consistent forecasts \nfor the\u00a0region.\n\nEconomists in ERCD, led by Abdul Abiad, director of the \n\nMacroeconomics\u00a0Research Division, coordinated the production of the \npublication, assisted by Edith Lavi\u00f1a.

Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly industrialized \neconomies, growth will drop from 5.7% to 2.4% this year before recovering to \n6.7% next year. \n\nHeadline inflation accelerated in 2019 as food prices edged up but remained \nlow by historical standards. Inflation will climb further to 3.2% in 2020, but \ndeclining food prices in the latter half of the year will set the stage for easing \ninflation in 2021.\n\nDownside risks to the outlook are severe, most notably from coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19). No one can say how widely the COVID-19 pandemic \nmay spread, and containment may take longer than currently projected. \nThe\u00a0possibility of severe financial turmoil and financial crises cannot be \ndiscounted. Sharp and protracted declines in commodity prices and tourist \narrivals will challenge dependent economies across the region.\n\nIn these difficult times, when challenges to growth abound, innovation is critical \nto inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. While some economies \nin developing Asia are near or at the global innovation frontier, many others \nlag behind. The theme chapter in this report identifies five key drivers of \ninnovation that should inform policy: sound education systems, innovative \nentrepreneurship, conducive institutions, deeper capital markets, and dynamic \ncities that bring together top universities and forward-thinking firms. Asian \ncountries must first get the basics right because there are no shortcuts to an \ninnovation society. For example, strikingly, one in three 10-year-old Asians \ncannot read adequately. This suggests that the education systems of lagging \ncountries must be strengthened and reformed. The journey toward a more \ninnovative Asia thus requires long-term commitment and a lot of hard work.\n\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank\n\n\fxii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak\n\nAfter a difficult 2019, challenges mount\n\n(cid:31) Following a lackluster 2019, an incipient recovery is upended by COVID-19. \n\nGrowth in developing Asia slowed to 5.2% in 2019 from 5.9% in 2018, \nhandicapped by trade tensions, a downturn in electronics, and weak domestic \ninvestment. Just as recovery in the electronics sector and progress toward what \nwould become the \u201cphase one trade agreement\u201d between the United States \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) began to lift the region\u2019s prospects in \nlate 2019, the momentum was halted by the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19). The outbreak emerged in January 2020, severely affecting \nthe PRC and rapidly spreading across the world. The evolution of the outbreak, \nand hence this outlook, remain highly uncertain, but the baseline forecast is that \nregional growth will slow steeply to 2.2% in 2020 before recovering to 6.2% in \n2021. Excluding the newly industrialized economies, growth is seen to slow from \n5.7% in 2019 to 2.4% in 2020 and then to pick up to 6.7% in 2021.\n\n (cid:31) The external environment is worsening as the outbreak spreads. Growth in \nthe major industrial economies of the US, the euro area, and Japan had already \ndecelerated from 2.2% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2019. Signs of revival emerged in \nNovember 2019 as global trade and manufacturing trended upward for the \nfirst time in several months. But, with the COVID-19 outbreak increasingly \noverwhelming Europe and the US, economic activity in those economies is \nexpected to fall sharply as they undertake containment. Growth in the major \nindustrial economies is expected to contract by 0.3% in 2020 before recovering \nto 1.8% in 2021. \n\n (cid:31) Growth will fall substantially in the PRC this year. In 2019, US\u2013PRC \n\ntrade tensions weighed on both exports and domestic demand in the PRC. \nGDP growth slowed from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.1% in 2019. The shock from the \nCOVID-19 outbreak this year is much greater. Data for the first two months of \nthe year indicate double-digit contractions in industry, services, retail sales, and \ninvestment. As a result, growth in the PRC is forecast to slow to 2.3% in 2020 \nbefore rebounding to 7.3% in 2021. \n\n (cid:31) Growth in India will remain subdued after a disappointing 2019. India \n\nsuffered a sharp slowdown last year, from 6.1% in fiscal 2018 to 5.0%, as a credit \ncrunch that originated in the nonbanking financial sector severely hampered \nbank lending. COVID-19 has not yet spread extensively in India, but measures \nto contain the virus and a weaker global environment will whip up headwinds, \noffsetting support from corporate and personal income tax cuts as well as \nfinancial sector reforms which are meant to revive credit flows. GDP growth in \nIndia is forecast to slow further to 4.0% this year before strengthening to 6.2% in \nfiscal 2021.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n\n(cid:31) All of developing Asia\u2019s subregions will see growth weaken in 2020. Global \n\ndemand weakened by the pandemic will weigh on the 2020 outlook, particularly \nin the more open subregions and tourism-dependent economies like those in \nthe Pacific. Growth in East Asia will dip from 5.4% in 2019 to 2.0% in 2020 \nbefore reaccelerating to 6.5% in 2021. As the larger Southeast Asian economies \nwrestle with COVID-19, growth in the subregion is forecast to drop to 1.0% \nin\u00a02020 before recovering to 4.7% in 2021. Growth in Central Asia will also slow \nto 2.8% this year with lower oil prices, and the Pacific will contract by 0.3% with \ndeclining tourism, before rebounding in 2021. South Asia\u2019s growth rate is forecast \nto slow from 5.1% in fiscal 2019 to 4.1% in fiscal 2020 and reaccelerate to 6.0% \nin fiscal 2021, largely tracking recovery in India. Across Asia and the Pacific, the \nauthorities have introduced stimulus packages to support economic activity.\n\n (cid:31) Inflation will tick up on increased food prices before easing in 2021. Regional \ninflation increased from 2.5% in 2018 to 2.9% in 2019, driven mainly by rising \nfood prices, particularly pork prices in the PRC and vegetable prices in India. \nHowever, inflation has remained under control, below the 3.3% average in the \npast 10 years, which has allowed many central banks across developing Asia to \ncut policy rates to stimulate growth. Regional inflation is projected to increase \nto 3.2% in 2020, driven by pork prices in the PRC, before easing again to 2.3% \nin\u00a02021. Weakening economic activity and softening commodity prices will partly \noffset the effect of food prices. \n\n (cid:31) A widening current account surplus in 2019 and 2020 will narrow in 2021. \n\nGlobal trade tensions kept developing Asia\u2019s exports and imports in the doldrums \nin 2019, but imports fell more sharply, reflecting in part lower investment growth \nin the region. Trade growth will likely weaken even further this year as domestic \ndemand wanes and trade and supply are disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak. \nThus, the regional current account surplus for the whole of developing Asia will \nexpand only slightly from 1.5% of GDP in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020, before falling \nback to 1.4% in 2021.\n\n (cid:31) COVID-19 poses a grave threat to the regional and global outlooks. \n\nThe\u00a0forecast assumes containment of the outbreak within this year and a return \nto normal next year. But even as the epicenter of the disease has shifted to \nEurope and the US, the potential for additional outbreaks in the region and \nworldwide remains, and there is vast uncertainty about the duration and severity \nof the pandemic. Hence outcomes can be worse than forecast and growth may \nnot recover as quickly. The Special Topic in this report is an updated assessment \nof the regional and global impacts of the outbreak, and indicates substantial \ndownside risks if it spreads further in the region\u2019s economies. The possibility of \na financial crises cannot be discounted and the pandemic could also bring about \nfundamental changes to the global economy over the long term.\n\n\fxiv(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on developing Asia\u2014an update\n\n(cid:31) The rapid spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made it the \nworst pandemic in a century. The outbreak was still concentrated primarily \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) when ADB released initial estimates \nof its economic impact on 6 March. Since then the outbreak has expanded \nsignificantly, with its epicenter shifting to Europe and the United States. The use \nof containment measures such as travel bans and community quarantines has \nexpanded greatly. And data from the PRC indicate that the outbreak caused a \ndouble-digit decline in economic activity in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n (cid:31) Updated scenarios suggest a much larger impact than previously \n\nenvisioned, reflecting these new realities. The range of scenarios explored in \nthis update suggest a global cost of between $2.0 and $4.1 trillion, equivalent \nto between 2.3% and 4.8% of global GDP. The much higher estimate \nreflects its spread to Europe, the United States, and other major economies. \nDeveloping\u00a0Asia\u00a0including the PRC accounts for just 22% to 36% of the total. \nNevertheless, regional economies will be hit hard, with an impact on the PRC \nof close to 5% of\u00a0GDP. The loss to the rest of developing Asia will be between \n1.0% and 2.2% of\u00a0GDP. The estimated impact could be an underestimate, \nas additional channels such\u00a0as supply disruptions, interrupted remittances, \npossible social and financial crises, and long-term effects on health care and \neducation are excluded from the analysis. The analysis provides estimates of the \nimpact on individual economies in developing Asia, and on sectors within them, \nincluding\u00a0the additional impact on an economy if it experiences a significant \noutbreak of its own.\n\nEstimated global and regional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, under different scenarios\n\nShorter containment,  \nsmaller demand shocks\n\nLonger containment,  \nlarger demand shocks\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\nLosses,  \n$ billion\n\n2,013.0\n\n\u2002\u2002628.0\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200293.3\n\n1,291.6\n\n\u20134.8\n\n\u20135.1\n\n\u20132.2\n\n\u20135.1\n\nLosses,  \n$ billion\n\n4,090.8\n\n\u2002\u2002691.6\n\n\u2002\u2002200.1\n\n3,199.1\n\nWorld\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nDeveloping Asia excluding the PRC\n\nRest of the world\n\n\u20132.3\n\n\u20134.6\n\n\u20131.0\n\n\u20132.0\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xv\n\nOutlook by subregion\n\n(cid:31) Developing Asia will suffer a sharp slowdown in 2020 as it struggles to \ncontain COVID-19. Growth will slow in most regional economies this year, \nwith output in 9 of 46 ADB developing member countries expected to shrink. \nAggregate economic growth will decelerate to 2.2% in 2020 but reaccelerate \nto 6.2% in 2021. By subregion, deceleration will be mildest in South Asia and \nsteepest in the Pacific.\n\n (cid:31) East Asia will weaken but can expect to bounce back. The slowdown is most \nprominent in the PRC, where the global health crisis first emerged. Recession in \nHong Kong, China caused by separate stresses at home and abroad in 2019 will \ndeepen in 2020 but begin to ease as fiscal responses and stronger exports bring \nrecovery, probably beginning in 2021. Growth in the ROK and Taipei,China will \ndip this year before rising next year on public spending and resurgent exports. \nSimilarly, growth in Mongolia will decline this year as FDI inflow ebbs but will \nclimb next year as mining and investment pick up. Despite the growth slowdown \nthis year, inflation in the subregion will accelerate to 3.2% on temporarily higher \nprices for food, especially pork, in the heavily weighted PRC, and as inflation \ninches up in the ROK. In the rest of the subregion, inflation will slow in 2020 as \ndemand wanes and then quicken in 2021 as economic activity revives.\n\n (cid:31) South Asia will face a milder slowdown. Growth in South Asia will decelerate \nto 4.1% in 2020 and then recover to 6.0% in 2021, largely tracking the trend \nin the dominant Indian economy. GDP performance will remain strong in \nBangladesh, which is forecast to grow by 7.8% this year even as global demand \npulls back, and continue to accelerate in Bhutan both this year and next as a new \n5-year plan strengthens government spending, and despite lower tourist arrivals. \nMaldives and Sri Lanka are less sheltered from global efforts to limit the spread \nof COVID-19, which are forecast to cause the tourism-dominated economy \nof Maldives to contract by 3.0% in 2020 before surging back in 2021. Leaving \naside external upheaval, growth in Pakistan will slow as agriculture stagnates, \nnotably affecting cotton output, and as stabilization efforts constrain domestic \ndemand. The intended correction of macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan \nshould restore confidence in the economy and bring later benefits. Inflation in \nthe subregion will soften to 4.1% in 2020 as food inflation eases in India with \nimproved agriculture. Unusually low inflation will continue in Maldives with \nsubsidies and price controls on basic goods joined by anticipated deterioration in \ndemand. Pakistan, by contrast, will struggle this year with double-digit inflation \nfueled by escalating food prices, scheduled hikes to utility rates, and domestic \ncurrency depreciation. \n\n (cid:31) Southeast Asia will track the PRC and decelerate to 1.0% growth in 2020. \n\nAll economies in the subregion will endure a growth slowdown in 2020 because \nof COVID-19 and a consequent global slump, especially given their strong trade \nand investment ties with a slowing PRC. Thailand, the second-largest economy \nin the subregion, will likely contract by 4.8% this year, continuing a steady slide \nin recent years. Growth in the closely intertwined economies of Malaysia and \nSingapore will plummet nearly to zero in 2020, with only Malaysia enjoying a \nstrong rebound next year. Cambodia and Indonesia will see sharp deceleration, \nas will the Philippines despite expansionary government policies, which should \n\n\fxvi(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nfacilitate an upturn in 2021. Growth in Viet Nam is forecast to decelerate \nsignificantly but remain uniquely robust in the subregion. With most economies \nweakening and global oil prices softening, subregional inflation should stay tame \nat just 1.9% in 2020 and 2.2% in 2021. Counting mitigated deflation in Brunei \nDarussalam, 8 of the 11 economies will see somewhat higher inflation this year \nbecause of continued food price pressure, but inflation will slow in Myanmar and \nthe Philippines and reverse to a deflation in Thailand. \n\n (cid:31) Central Asia will decelerate under COVID-19 after steady acceleration in \n\nrecent years. Growth in the subregion will drop to 2.8% in 2020 as economies \nfalter worldwide and drag down global commodity prices. Lower petroleum prices \nand sluggish production will weaken oil exporters, with growth slowing to 0.5% \nin Azerbaijan and 1.8% in Kazakhstan, the largest economy in the subregion, \nslowed as well as by reduced public investment. Fiscal consolidation and lower \nremittances from the Russian Federation will weaken growth in Tajikistan. \nGeorgia\u2019s highly tourism- and trade-dependent economy will be particularly \nvulnerable to COVID-19 as closed borders and monetary tightening grind growth \nto a halt in 2020. Growth in Armenia, a metal producer notable for its sales to \nthe PRC, will fall sharply this year, and slower mineral exports to the PRC will \nslow growth less dramatically in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. Subregional \ninflation at 7.6% this year will be little changed as mixed projections balance out. \nMonetary tightening is expected to lower inflation in Georgia and Uzbekistan \nboth years and in Kazakhstan in 2021.\n\n (cid:31) The Pacific will be hard hit by the pandemic and resulting global slowdown. \nCombined output in the subregion is forecast to decline by 0.3% in 2020 as 5 of \nits 14 economies contract. Countries that rely heavily on tourism and commodity \nexports will be particularly vulnerable. Fiji\u2019s dependence on both will cause \nthe steepest decline, with GDP contracting by 4.9%. The Cook Islands, Palau, \nSamoa, and Vanuatu, which also have large tourist industries, will see output \nshrink this year. As restrictions on the movement of labor and capital equipment \ndelay infrastructure projects, growth will suffer in smaller economies. With only \nsubdued recovery in 2021, growth in the subregion will remain below average in \ndeveloping Asia next year. Inflation will edge down to 2.7% this year with fading \ndemand but rebound to 3.8% in 2021 on expected currency depreciation in \nPapua New Guinea, the largest economy in the subregion, and growth recovery \nin Fiji, the second largest. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xvii\n\nWhat drives innovation in Asia?\n\nInnovating for inclusive and sustainable growth \n\n(cid:31) Innovation is a complex, diverse, and multifaceted process. The term refers \nto new, significantly different products and processes that improve productivity \nand benefit users. Innovation occurs through a wide range of activities carried \nout by a variety of actors. Some innovations are game changers, such as the \nmobile phones that left landline phones to gather dust. Much more common are \nincremental innovations, such as those that create more and better features in \nmobile phones. While first-in-the-world frontier innovations like driverless cars \ngrab most of the headlines, developing Asia receives more impetus from a steady \nstream of first-in-your-market catch-up innovations. \n\n (cid:31) Asia\u2019s emergence as a middle-income region argues for more innovation. \nThe region owes its transition from low to middle income to the accumulation \nof production factors such as capital and skilled workers and to productivity \ngrowth\u2014the latter assuming a larger role in growth as economies mature \nand become heavily dependent on innovation. Middle-income countries that \nsuccessfully graduate to high income invest three times more on research and \ndevelopment (R&D) than do countries mired in the middle-income trap, and \nthey file four times more patent applications. The Republic of Korea (ROK) and \nAsia\u2019s other three newly industrialized economies are examples of economies \ninnovating their way to high income.\n\n (cid:31) Innovation can promote more inclusive and sustainable growth. Innovation \nsustains regional growth and improves its quality in an inclusive manner. Many \nbasic innovations\u2014notable examples being insecticide-treated bed nets, cost-\neffective water filters, and payments transacted through mobile phones\u2014\ncan improve the quality of life for the most disadvantaged and are often the \nbrainchildren of impoverished innovators with the keenest insights into the needs \nof these communities. Similarly, green innovations in energy, transport, and other \nareas promote a cleaner environment.\n\nLandscape of innovation in Asia\n\n(cid:31) The innovation gap is narrowing, but unevenly. While advanced economies \ninvest on average 2.5% of their GDP in R&D, developing Asia is close behind at \n2.1%, up from 0.9% in the late 1990s. Excluding the four newly industrialized \neconomies, investment in developing Asia equals 1.9% of GDP, well ahead of \n0.8% in Latin America. However, Asia\u2019s high average masks wide variation across \ncountries, with lower-income countries more likely to undertake catch-up \nadaptation than innovate at the global technology frontier.\n\n (cid:31) Evidence from firms shows that Asia already innovates a lot. Analysis of \nalmost 27,000 firms in developing Asia finds that 53% of them innovate to \nproduce new products, processes, or both. However, most innovation by firms \nimproves existing products or processes incrementally, at some distance from \nthe global technology frontier. This explains why reported innovation rates are \nhigher among firms in low-income countries with greater scope for incremental, \n\n\fxviii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\ncatch-up innovation. In the region as a whole, firms that are relatively innovative \nare usually larger, older, active exporters, or engaged in information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) or high-tech manufacturing.\n\n (cid:31) Research highlights the role of R&D, human capital, and infrastructure. \nCross-country analysis finds a positive relationship between innovation and \neconomic growth across countries, and, in developing Asia, between innovation \nand spending on R&D and human capital. The effect of human capital is \nmore pronounced and robust. A 1% increase in secondary school enrollment \nis associated with increased innovation, proxied by patent flows, by 2%. The \ncoverage and quality of energy, transport, and ICT infrastructure also correlate \npositively with innovation. The effect of human capital investment is especially \nrobust, as detailed below.\n\nFostering innovators and an innovative culture\n\n(cid:31) Evidence from firms strongly links human capital and innovation. Intuitively, \na workforce that is highly skilled and educated, especially to the tertiary level, \npowers a more innovative economy. Many innovators who achieve technological \nbreakthroughs are, after all, scientists and engineers. Analysis of firms in Asia \nthat considered three indicators of human capital\u2014workers\u2019 formal educational \nattainment, managerial experience, and training provided by firms\u2014found a \nrobust positive association between human capital and innovation. Firms that \ntrained their employees, for example, were more likely to innovate than were \nfirms that did not, by as much as 12.4 percentage points.\n\n (cid:31) Sound education systems can help create a larger pool of innovators. \nHowever, the link between education and innovation is not automatic. \nA\u00a0prerequisite for a well-educated workforce that can innovate is high-quality \neducation in literacy, numeracy, and other basic skills. Where education systems \nfail to deliver, they must be reformed thoroughly to improve the quality of \neducation in basic skills. More student-centered teaching can foster creative \nand innovative thinking. Finally, a mix of skills is needed to drive innovation. \nWhile the STEM quartet of science, technology, engineering, and math clearly \nprovide key competencies that promote innovation, other qualities critical to \ninnovation\u2014such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and grit\u2014must \nalso be nurtured.\n\n (cid:31) Strong institutions enable innovative entrepreneurs. The quality of \n\nentrepreneurship in an economy is more important for innovation than its \nquantity. A very small minority of entrepreneurs, known in the business world \nas \u201cgazelles,\u201d account for the bulk of innovation and job growth, while most \nentrepreneurs neither innovate nor create jobs. A country\u2019s ability to foster \ngazelles depends largely on its institutional conditions. Analysis of more than \n36,000 businesses in 17 Asian economies reveals that strong property rights \nand rule of law encourage entrepreneurs to formalize their businesses, and that \ngrowth in formalized businesses is associated with greater innovation. \n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xix\n\n(cid:31) Rapid advances in ICT have revolutionized the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nTechnological developments have sharply reduced the cost of innovative \nentrepreneurship. They have spawned new business models that use frontier \ntechnology platforms such as the Global Positioning System, as exemplified \nby the ride-sharing and delivery services Gojek and Grab. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, \nentrepreneurial ecosystems have emerged and multiplied all over the world \nto exploit entrepreneurial opportunities opened up by the global digital \ntransformation. This transformation is driven by relentless advances in digital \ntechnology and infrastructure, notably the internet. The transformation of \nAlibaba and Amazon into global tech giants illustrate the huge potential of digital \nentrepreneurship.\n\nConducive institutions and environment for innovators\n\n(cid:31) Intellectual protection should reflect the stage of economic development. \n\nPatents and industrial design are critical for frontier innovations and in \nhigher-income economies. Other types of intellectual property rights such as \nutility models or petty patents are better suited to the incremental catch-up \ninnovations that are important in less-developed countries. Analysis of more \nthan 7,000 firms in the ROK from 1970 to 2010 indicates that petty patents and \ntrademarks facilitated firms\u2019 growth during the country\u2019s earliest development \nstage. Design protection assumed a bigger role during the subsequent catch-up \nphase of ROK development, and patents became prominent during the most \nrecent globalized phase. Thus, property rights cannot be judged solely on \nwhether they are strong or weak. It is more important to offer the right type of \nintellectual property protection for a country\u2019s stage of development. \n\n (cid:31) Equity and other capital markets are key to financing innovation. Analysis \nof patent data by industry in 47 countries from 1997 to 2016 reveals that \nfinancial markets matter greatly to innovation in an economy. The vitality of \nboth the equity market and the debt market have positive and significant effects \non R&D efficiency, as measured by the number of patents granted. Equity and \ndebt markets also have positive and significant effects on innovation quality, \nas\u00a0measured by citations in research papers. The effect is more pronounced for \nequity markets. The implication for Asian countries is that they should continue \nto develop their capital markets.\n\n (cid:31) Evidence confirms the importance of cities as engines of innovation. \n\nInnovation tends to be concentrated in a few urban innovation hubs able to \ngenerate strong agglomeration economies. Across Asia, such concentration of \ninnovation can be seen in product innovation, process innovation, and R&D. \nThe 10 most innovative cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) account \nfor 72% of product innovation but only 55% of the urban population. In India, \nthe corresponding figures are 76% of innovation but only 43% of the urban \npopulation. Evidence shows that city size has a significant effect on innovative \nactivity, with firms in larger cities tending to be more innovative, as does the \npresence of top-tier universities. However, haphazard urbanization that causes \ntraffic congestion and other urban ills can undermine a city\u2019s potential as an \nengine of innovation and growth.\n\n\fxx(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nToward a more innovative Asia\n\n(cid:31) Asian governments can and should become catalysts for innovation. \nGovernments play a major direct role in innovative activity and sponsor a \nsubstantial share of R&D. From 1996 to 2017, government shares of R&D \nwere 23% in the PRC, 24% in the ROK, and 42% in Viet Nam. While private \nR&D typically concentrates on immediately practical commercial applications, \ngovernments tend to support basic research that can spill over in multiple \ndirections. Plenty of scope exists, however, for government-supported innovation \nto improve products and processes directly. Public sector innovation labs like \nthose in Armenia and Sri Lanka can promote experimentation and openness to \nnew approaches. \n\n (cid:31) The policy environment for innovators must evolve with the economy. \n\nEach\u00a0country has a unique national innovation system to address market failures \nwhich are inherent in innovation. Governments should play direct and leading \nroles in developing these systems at their early stages but shift to less direct, \nsupportive functions after the private sector has stepped up and assumed a \nbigger role. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on how effective active innovation \npolicies\u00a0are. Subsidies paid by Innofund, for example, through which the \nGovernment of the PRC supports R&D by smaller tech companies, seem to offer \nonly limited increments in innovative output. This observation highlights the \nneed for nuance in government interventions. \n\n (cid:31) Local policies must complement national policies to foster innovation. \n\nTo\u00a0facilitate local entrepreneurial ecosystems, local policies should adhere to \nkey\u00a0principles: (i) adopting a bottom\u2013up approach to facilitate entrepreneurship, \nmore than can be achieved with a top\u2013down hierarchical approach; \n(ii)\u00a0close\u00a0engagement with all stakeholders; (iii) nurturing communities of \nentrepreneurs, accelerators, financiers, large businesses, mentors, public \nagencies, educational institutions, and regional agencies by serving as their \nsecretariat; (iv) enabling entrepreneurs to share their knowledge gleaned from \nbusiness model experiments by promoting networking events and platforms; \nand (v) encouraging active public\u2013private interaction though systematic and \ninstitutionalized dialogue. Local policies can thus help cities and other localities \nrealize their potential to apply new technologies to incubate innovation and new \nbusiness models.\n\n\fHighlights\u2002\u2002xxi\n\nGDP growth rate and in\ufb02ation, % per year\n\nGDP growth\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nCentral Asia\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nGeorgia\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyz Republic\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nUzbekistan\n\nEast Asia\nHong Kong, China\nMongolia\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRepublic of Korea\nTaipei,China\n\nSouth Asia\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nBhutan\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\n\nSoutheast Asia\nBrunei Darussalam\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Growth decelerated from 5.9% in 2018 to 5.2% in 2019 \nas global activity softened and trade tensions mounted, the \nelectronics industry endured a global downcycle, and domestic \ninvestment weakened (Figure 1.0.1). Economic activity showed \nsigns of recovery toward the turn of 2020, but hopes were \nquickly dashed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which \nbroke out in January in the PRC and has since expanded into \na worldwide\u00a0pandemic. Disruption to regional and global \nsupply chains, trade, and tourism, and the continued spread of \nthe outbreak, have the region reeling under massive economic \nshocks and financial turmoil.\n\nHow the pandemic will evolve is unknown, leaving the \n\noutlook highly uncertain as the situation remains fluid. \nBased\u00a0on information available to 20 March, economic growth \nin the region is forecast to slow to 2.2% in 2020, with all \nsubregions weakening. Assuming that the outbreak ends within \nthis year, growth will recover to 6.2% in\u00a02021. Much of the \nexpected decline in regional growth stems from a slowdown in \nthe PRC, where growth is projected to plunge from 6.1% in 2019 \nto 2.3% in 2020 before rebounding above normal to 7.3% in 2021. \nGrowth in India is expected to decline further to 4.0% in 2020 \nbefore strengthening to 6.2% in 2021. \n\nThe gravest threat to the outlook is the global pandemic. \n\nThe\u00a0forecast assumes containment within this year and a return to \nnormal next year, but outcomes could well be worse than forecast. \nThe outbreak could spread more widely, and containing it may \ntake longer than currently projected. The possibility of financial \nturmoil and financial crises cannot be discounted. Further, \nthe global pandemic could leave permanent scars that force \nfundamental changes to the global economy over the long\u00a0term.\n\nThis section was written by Abdul Abiad, Shiela Camingue-Romance, Matteo\u00a0Lanzafame, \nMadhavi Pundit, Irfan Qureshi, Arief Ramayandi, Dennis\u00a0Sorino, and Priscille Villanueva \nof\u00a0the Economic Research and Regional\u00a0Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f4(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\n1.1\u2002 After a difficult 2019, \nchallenges mount\n\nThis report comes at a very challenging time. The COVID-19 \noutbreak that started in the PRC in early January has become \na global pandemic. Its epicenter has shifted to Europe and \nthe\u00a0US. The pandemic imposes a deep and extensive negative \nshock to the global economy, as wide-ranging containment \nmeasures enacted around the world constrain both supply and \ndemand. The Asian Development Outlook 2020 (ADO 2020) \nbaseline assumes the COVID-19 shock will be very large but \nalso temporary. However, the duration and severity of the \npandemic are subject to such extreme uncertainty at this point \nthat a scenario in which the world economy comes out of this \ncrisis fundamentally changed cannot be excluded. Recognizing \nthat any forecasts done in such a fluid environment will quickly \nbecome outdated, ADB will monitor the situation and update \nits forecasts with the release of ADO Supplements as needed.\n\n1.1.1\u2002Signs of recovery quickly overturned\nCOVID-19 has buried signs of improvement in the global \neconomy that appeared at the beginning of 2020. After weak \ngrowth in 2019, the lowest since the global financial crisis \nof 2008\u20132009, this year opened with receding uncertainties \nover the US\u2013PRC trade conflict, Brexit, and the tightening \ncycle of the US Federal Reserve. Output growth in the \nadvanced economies of the US, the euro area, and Japan had \ndecelerated from 2.2% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2019 (Figure\u00a01.1.1), \nbut toward the end of the year the downturn appeared to \nbe bottoming out, with global growth on the cusp of a mild \nrevival. Prospects for global manufacturing, as indicated \nby the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), improved \nin November for the first time in 7 months, however \nmarginally. By January of 2020, the global composite PMI \nhad risen to 52.2, its highest since March 2019 (Figure\u00a01.1.2). \nGrowth in world trade volume crossed into positive territory \nin December 2019 in tandem with signs of the US and the \nPRC deescalating their trade conflict.

The regional performance deteriorated from 5.9% \nin 2018 to 5.2% last year, with 23 of 45 Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member economies recording slower \ngrowth (Figure\u00a01.1.3). Growth in India declined from 6.1% in \nfiscal 2018 to 5.0% as domestic investment and consumption \ncollapsed under stress on nonbanking financial companies \nand a sharp slowdown in credit growth more generally \n(Figure\u00a01.1.4). Growth in the PRC decelerated from 6.7% to \n6.1% in the same period, the ongoing slowdown caused by \ntrade tensions and weakening domestic demand. Beyond the \nPRC, prolonged uncertainty from the trade conflict, weak \nglobal demand, and a downturn in the electronics cycle \nweighed on growth in the more open subregions of East and \nSoutheast Asia. Among the newly industrialized economies \n(NIEs), Hong Kong, China actually contracted for the first \ntime in a decade as domestic political tensions exacerbated \na challenging external environment. The Republic of Korea \n(ROK) and Singapore also slowed considerably. The larger \nSoutheast Asian economies slowed mildly, except Thailand, \nwhere growth fell substantially as major categories of \nmerchandise exports continued to contract. The economically \nsmaller subregions of Central Asia and the Pacific bucked the \ntrend with rising growth in 2019.\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\nConsumption remained the bulwark of growth in Asia \nin 2019, though its contribution declined in the four NIEs, \nespecially in Hong Kong, China, and in the region\u2019s two \nlargest economies, India and the PRC (Figure 1.1.5). It was \nmostly stable from 2018 to 2019 in five large Southeast Asian \neconomies (ASEAN-5). The contribution of investment to \nGDP growth has declined across the board over the past \ncouple of years in response to economic weakness and \nuncertain prospects. Net exports boosted growth in the \nNIEs, but this was only because import declines outpaced \nthose of exports, reflecting weakening investment.\nIn the PRC, trade tensions weighed on exports \nin\u00a02019, and domestic demand softened. Growth in \nthe PRC slowed from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.1% in 2019. \nOn\u00a0the\u00a0domestic front, consumption decelerated as both \nhousehold disposable income and consumption expenditure \nsoftened, reflecting a rapid increase in food prices, which \ndrove down consumers\u2019 purchasing power in real terms. \nThe\u00a0contribution of investment to growth fell with sharp \ndeceleration in manufacturing investment as domestic demand \nsoftened, external demand deteriorated, profits declined, \nand overcapacity continued to be cut in some upstream \nindustries. On the external front, imports of investment goods \nsuch as machinery and electrical equipment declined, while \ntrade tensions with the US kept export growth marginal. \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\f6(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 1.1.4\u2002 Demand-side contributions to growth, selected economies\n\nDomestic investment was a drag on many economies in 2019.\n\nConsumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nGDP growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\nASEAN-5\n\nNIEs\n\n5.2\n\n5.0\n\n4.7\n\n4.3\n\n6.2\n\n5.9\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\n4.2\n\n2.4\n\n6.7\n\n6.1\n\n6.1\n\n5.0\n\n2.9\n\n2.7\n\n2.0\n\n3.4\n\n2.7\n\n2.7\n\n0.7\n\n\u20131.2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n9\n1\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\nINO\n\nMAL\n\nPHI\n\nTHA\n\nVIE\n\nHKG\n\nROK\n\nSIN\n\nTAP\n\nPRC\n\nIND\n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; FY = \ufb01scal year; HKG = Hong Kong, China; IND = India; INO = Indonesia; MAL = Malaysia; NIEs = newly \nindustrialized economies; PHI = Philippines; PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; ROK = Republic of Korea; SIN = Singapore; TAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand;  \nVIE = Viet Nam.\nNotes: Data for India are in \ufb01scal years ending 31 March of the next year.

The government cut taxes \nand fees for corporations and incurred a sizeable budget \ndeficit as fiscal expenditure greatly outpaced revenue.\n\nA slowdown in India further weighed down regional \ngrowth in 2019. GDP growth in India fell from 6.1% in fiscal \n2018 to an estimated 5.0% in the fiscal year just finished, \nbelow its decade average of 7.0%. A steep deceleration \nin credit weighed heavily on private consumption and \ninvestment in 2019. Recent years had seen a sharp rise \nof loans from nonbanking financial companies, partly in \nresponse to lending constraints on public sector banks as \nthey cleaned their balance sheets. Then, in September\u00a02018, \none such company defaulted, which, along with declining \nasset quality across this finance segment, triggered a \nslowdown in credit growth. This\u00a0brought to the fore \nsystemic problems in the financial sector. Growth\u00a0in \nnonfood credit slumped by half from a peak of 14.6% at \nthe beginning of 2019 to 7.1% at year-end, undermining \neconomic growth (Figure 1.1.6).

A decline in manufacturing \nthat had begun in the latter part of 2018 continued through \nmuch of 2019 but appeared to turn a corner toward the \nend of the year. Industrial production in developing\u00a0Asia \ninched up in December on incipient gains in India, the PRC, \nand the NIEs, though production continued to decline in \nthe ASEAN-5 (Figure\u00a01.1.7). Then COVID-19 squelched it. \nIn January and February, PRC industrial output reversed \n6.9% growth year on year in December by contracting \ndramatically by 13.5%, the weakest reading in over 3 decades.\n\nSimilarly, the forward-looking PMI had pointed in \nearly January to expanding manufacturing in many Asian \neconomies, only to be overtaken by the COVID-19 outbreak \n(Table\u00a01.1.1). Subsequently, large and extended factory and \nservice closures in the PRC induced unprecedented \nplunges in the country\u2019s PMI readings in February: \nin\u00a0manufacturing, from 51.1 across the contraction threshold \nat 50 to 40.3, and in services, from 51.8 all the way down to \n26.5. The ROK, which has suffered Asia\u2019s worst COVID-19 \noutbreak outside of the PRC, saw its manufacturing PMI \nfall further below the 50 threshold. In Southeast Asia, the \nindex dipped slightly below 50 in Viet\u00a0Nam and Thailand \nbut stayed mostly stable and above 50 in Malaysia and the \nPhilippines. Manufacturing in Indonesia strengthened in \nFebruary after contracting for 7 consecutive months, with \nthe PMI reaching 51.9 as elections dissipated uncertainty. \nUp\u00a0to February, India\u2019s economy remained little affected by \nthe outbreak. While its manufacturing PMI dropped from an \n8-year high of 55.3 in January to 54.5 in February, its service \nindex rose from 55.5 to 57.5.\n\nRetail sales data in December showed stable consumption \n\nalongside a pickup in consumer confidence in East Asia \n(except in Hong Kong, China because of political turmoil) but \nnot in Thailand and Indonesia, where economic strains kept \nsales subdued (Figure 1.1.8). In the Philippines, sentiment \nrebounded strongly in 2019 after consumption plummeted \nthe previous year. In the PRC, retail sales shrank in January \nand February 2020 by 20.5% from the previous year, the \nfirst of such decline on record as rattled consumers stayed \naway from shops, restaurants, and other commercial \nestablishments in line with tough government containment \nrestrictions. While\u00a0the initial impact of virus containment on \neconomic activity is clear in the PRC, disruption to both supply \nand demand in other regional economies is not yet evident in \nthe monthly data.\n\n\f8(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 1.1.1\u2002 Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index, selected economies\n\nThis leading indicator pointed in early January to manufacturing expansion in many Asian economies but then nosedived in the PRC after COVID-19 struck.\n\nManufacturing purchasing managers' index, seasonally adjusted\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nQ1\n\nEconomy\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n51.5 51.6 51.0 51.1 51.1 51.0 50.8 50.6 50.0 50.1 50.2 49.7 48.3 49.9 50.8 50.2 50.2 49.4 49.9 50.4 51.4 51.7 51.8 51.5 51.1 40.3\n\n52.4 52.1 51.0 51.6 51.2 53.1 52.3 51.7 52.2 53.1 54.0 53.2 53.9 54.3 52.6 51.8 52.7 52.1 52.5 51.4 51.4 50.6 51.2 52.7 55.3 54.5\n\nIndonesia\n\n49.9 51.4 50.7 51.6 51.7 50.3 50.5 51.9 50.7 50.5 50.4 51.2 49.9 50.1 51.2 50.4 51.6 50.6 49.6 49.0 49.1 47.7 48.2 49.5 49.3 51.9\n\nMalaysiaa\n\n53.5 52.9 52.5 51.6 50.6 52.5 52.7 54.2 54.5 52.2 51.2 49.8 50.9 50.6 50.2 52.4 51.8 50.8 50.6 50.4 50.9 52.3 52.5 53.0 51.8 51.5\n\nPhilippines\n\n51.7 50.8 51.5 52.7 53.7 52.9 50.9 51.9 52.0 54.0 54.2 53.2 52.3 51.9 51.5 50.9 51.2 51.3 52.1 51.9 51.8 52.1 51.4 51.7 52.1 52.3\n\nRep. of Korea 50.7 50.3 49.1 48.4 48.9 49.8 48.3 49.9 51.3 51.0 48.6 49.8 48.3 47.2 48.8 50.2 48.4 47.5 47.3 49.0 48.0 48.4 49.4 50.1 49.8 48.7\n\nTaipei,China\n\n56.9 56.0 55.3 54.8 53.4 54.5 53.1 53.0 50.8 48.7 48.4 47.7 47.5 46.3 49.0 48.2 48.4 45.5 48.1 47.9 50.0 49.8 49.8 50.8 51.8 49.9\n\nThailand\n\n50.6 50.9 49.1 49.5 51.1 50.2 50.1 49.9 50.0 48.9 49.8 50.3 50.2 49.9 50.3 51.0 50.7 50.6 50.3 50.0 50.6 50.0 49.3 50.1 49.9 49.5\n\nViet Nam\n\n53.4 53.5 51.6 52.7 53.9 55.7 54.9 53.7 51.5 53.9 56.5 53.8 51.9 51.2 51.9 52.5 52.0 52.5 52.6 51.4 50.5 50.0 51.0 50.8 50.6 49.0\n\nService purchasing managers\u2019 index, seasonally adjusted\n\n54.7 54.2 52.3 52.9 52.9 53.9 52.8 51.5 53.1 50.8 53.8 53.9 53.6 51.1 54.4 54.5 52.7 52.0 51.6 52.1 51.3 51.1 53.5 52.5 51.8 26.5\n\n51.7 47.8 50.3 51.4 49.6 52.6 54.2 51.5 50.9 52.2 53.7 53.2 52.2 52.5 52.0 51.0 50.2 49.6 53.8 52.4 48.7 49.2 52.7 53.3 55.5 57.5\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nPRC\n\nIndia\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, Q = quarter.\na\u2002 For Malaysia, the series is adjusted by adding 3 points because historical experience suggests that values above 47 are consistent with expansion.\nNote: Pink to red indicates contraction (<50), and white to green indicates expansion (>50).\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 5 March 2020).\n\nFigure 1.1.8\u2002 Consumer confidence and retail sales, selected economies\n\nRetail sales were stable in some parts of Asia but not in others at the end of 2019, and the crippling impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PRC retail was \nalready evident in January and February data.\n\nA.

After moderating \nin\u00a02018, external demand declined last year as tensions \nemanating from the US\u2013PRC trade conflict reverberated \nacross the region through depressed aggregate demand and \ndisrupted global value chains. The ensuing fall in exports of \nprimary products and other manufactures was compounded \nby a pronounced slowdown in the electronics cycle, which \nshowed signs of bottoming out only in the second half of the \nyear (Figures\u00a01.1.10 and 1.1.11). \n\nIn line with softening global trade and economic activity, \n\nthe value of developing Asia\u2019s exports and imports trended \ndown (Figure 1.1.12). Data for January\u2013November 2019 show \nthis pattern determined by poor performance in East Asia, \nwhere all economies except Mongolia recorded negative \nexport growth, and in Southeast Asia, where only countries \nwith small regional export shares saw their exports \nincrease, as did the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and \nthe Philippines, or soar, as did Cambodia. After booming \nin 2017 and 2018, Viet Nam\u2019s exports declined by 10.5% \nin\u00a02019, dragged down by softer growth in developing Asia, \nthe market for 40% of its exports. Buttressed by healthy \ndemand for fuel and energy, export growth held up well \nin Central\u00a0Asia, while it stagnated in South Asia and the \nPacific.\n\nThe US\u2013PRC trade conflict played a significant role \nin shaping trade dynamics. Conflict escalation reached \na peak on 1 September 2019, when a new round of tariffs \ncame into force on $125 billion in PRC exports to the \nUS and $75 billion in US exports to the PRC. Soon\u00a0after, \nhowever, the two parties agreed to fresh rounds of \ntrade talks, and tensions reduced further when both \ncountries announced tariff exemptions on various types \nof imports. By\u00a0mid-October, intense negotiations brought \nan announcement of a \u201cphase one trade agreement,\u201d \nto be finalized over several weeks, and the consequent \npostponement of an additional tariff hike by the US on \n$250\u00a0billion in PRC goods scheduled for 15 October. \nOn\u00a013\u00a0December, just before another scheduled tariff \nincrease by the US, the two countries reached an agreement \non the phase one deal, and the 15\u00a0January\u00a02020 signing \noccurred 2 days after the US Treasury Department \nwithdrew its designation of the PRC as a currency \nmanipulator. \n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201340\n\nFigure 1.1.10\u2002 Exports by product category, \ndeveloping Asia\n\nBattered by trade tensions, exports fell through most of the\u00a0year, \nshowing signs of revival only in the last quarter. \n\nPrimary products in nominal terms\nManufactures in nominal terms\nPrimary products in real terms\nManufactures in real terms\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nJan\n2019\n\nNotes: Developing Asia refers here to 10 economies that provide \n90% of regional GDP.

From\u00a0the outset, this overall target appeared to be \nambitious, as did specific targets for imports of agricultural, \nmanufacturing, and energy products and services. Moreover, \nwhile likely to prevent further tariff increases over the next \n10 months, the deal left in place most of the tariffs imposed \nsince\u00a02018. As\u00a0such, despite easing concerns of further \nescalation in the short term, the phase one deal did little to \nchange the widely held view that US\u2013PRC trade relations \nwould remain jittery in the medium\u00a0term.\n\nTrade was therefore a tense topic for most of 2019, \n\ngradually becoming less so only in the last quarter of the\u00a0year. \nPRC exports to the US in 2019 plunged by 21.3%, while PRC \nimports from the US dropped by a substantial 12.9%. PRC \nimports of tariff-affected goods fell for most of 2019 but \nrecovered somewhat during the last quarter. The knock-on \neffect of trade tensions with the US, as well as a home-\ngrown economic slowdown, reduced PRC imports from \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia by 1.6% in 2019, including a 3.6% fall from the \n10 other largest economies in the region. Meanwhile, trade \nredirection away from the PRC boosted US imports from \nother countries in developing Asia by 8.5%, with the ASEAN-5 \nbenefiting the most with 12.0% growth. \n\n\f12(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 1.1.13\u2002Current account balance\n\nWith falling exports and investment reducing import volumes, current account balances \nimproved in every subregion except Central Asia.\n\n2017\n2018\n2019\n\n% of GDP\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n16.0\n\n14.3\n\n13.6\n\n1.8\n\n1.5\n\n0.7\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.3\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n1.6\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20131.5\n\n\u20131.9\n\n\u20132.0\n\n\u20132.7\n\n\u20132.2\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nCentral Asia\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nStagnant trade improved the regional current account surplus \n\nto the equivalent of 1.5% of GDP in 2019 as imports contracted \nmore than exports (Figure 1.1.13). This pattern was largely \ndetermined by the impact of the US\u2013PRC trade conflict on the \nmost import-intensive components of aggregate demand: exports \nand investment. The fall in export volumes induced by rising \ntrade tensions brought about a decline in imports of intermediate \ngoods used in reexports. Together with softening economic \nactivity, the export slump was reflected as well in lower demand \nfor investment goods, further reducing imports. Current account \nbalances consequently improved over 2019 in four of the five \nsubregions as surpluses widened in East Asia to the equivalent \nof 2.0% of aggregate GDP, in Southeast Asia to 2.5%, and in the \nPacific to 16.0%, and the deficit narrowing in South Asia to 1.5%. \nIn\u00a0Central\u00a0Asia, by contrast, the deficit worsened to 2.2%.\n\n1.1.3\u2002Renewed \ufb01nancial turbulence in Asia\nExchange rate movements in 2019 reflected dynamics in capital \nflows and the US\u2013PRC trade conflict.

Major currencies in East\u00a0Asia weakened with conflict \nescalation, while Southeast\u00a0Asian currencies strengthened as \nproduction and trade were redirected to many of these economies \n(Figure 1.1.14).

In Singapore, a stimulus package amounting to \n11% of GDP was unveiled to deal with the likely impact on the \neconomy. Key allocations were made for ramping up existing \njob support schemes and for supporting households by handing \ncash payouts based on income levels. Many other economies \nare also in the process of rolling out fiscal responses. \n\n1.1.5\u2002A dire growth outlook \nThe growth outlook for developing Asia has dimmed \nconsiderably as the region staggers under the COVID-19 \nshock. Regional economic growth is expected to slow \nsharply from 5.2% in 2019 to 2.2% in 2020 before \nrebounding to 6.2% in 2021 (Figure 1.1.17). Excluding the \nNIEs, growth will drop from 5.7% in 2019 to 2.4% in 2020 \nbefore recovering to 6.7% in 2021. \n\nCOVID-19 is expected to weaken economic activity \n\nsubstantially this year, both globally and regionally. \nBaseline\u00a0assumptions take into account confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases to 20 March, with serious outbreaks across \nnumerous countries, including the major economies of the \nUS, Europe, and the PRC. The assumption is that these \ncountries\u2019 outbreaks will come under control in 3 to\u00a06 \nmonths and that activity will gradually return to normal \n(see the Special Topic that follows, which analyzes the \nimpact of the COVID-19 outbreak under various scenario \nassumptions). In the meantime, economic activity is \nexpected to fall sharply as countries undertake containment. \nAggregate growth in the advanced economies of the \nUS, euro area, and Japan is expected to drop from 1.7% \nin\u00a02019 and contract by 0.3% in 2020, before recovering to \n1.8% in\u00a02021 (Table 1.1.3). Japan is expected to slow sharply \nfrom 0.7% growth in 2019 to 1.5% contraction in 2020 as it \nreels from, first, a sales slump following a value-added tax\u00a0hike \nin the fourth quarter of 2019 and then from the widening \nCOVID-19 outbreak, before recovering\u00a0to 0.9%\u00a0growth\u00a0in\u00a02021. \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nFigure 1.1.17\u2002 GDP growth outlook \n\nin\u00a0developing\u00a0Asia\n\nThe outlook is for growth to stumble under COVID-19 \nas\u00a0demand weakens and production stalls. \n\nDeveloping Asia\nDeveloping Asia excluding NIEs\n\n6.6\n\n6.1\n\n6.6\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n5.9\n\n5.7\n\n5.2\n\n6.7\n\n6.2\n\n2.2 2.4\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nForecast\n\nNIEs = newly industrialized economies of Hong Kong, China; \nthe\u00a0Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\f18(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 1.1.3\u2002Baseline assumptions on the international economy\n\nMajor advanced economies are set to contract this year.\n\nGDP growth (%)\n\nMajor advanced economies \n\n\u00bbUnited States\n\n\u00bbEuro area\n\n\u00bbJapan\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nADO\u00a02019 \nUpdate\n\nADO\u00a02020\n\nADO\u00a02020\n\n2021\n\nADO\u00a02019 \nUpdate\n\n1.7\n\n2.3\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.7 \n\n2.3 \n\n1.2 \uf073\n\n0.7 \uf074\n\n1.4\n\n1.9\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u20130.3 \uf074\n\n\u20020.4 \uf074\n\n\u20131.0 \uf074\n\n\u20131.5 \uf074\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n0.9\n\nBrent crude spot prices (average, $ per barrel)\n\n65.00\n\n64.03 \uf074\n\n63.00\n\n35.00 \uf074\n\n55.00\n\n\uf073 = upgraded forecast, \uf074 = downgrade forecast, no sign = unchanged.\nNote: Major industrial economies average growth rates are weighted by gross national income, Atlas method (current US$).\nSources: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov; Eurostat, http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu; Economic and \nSocial Research Institute of Japan, http://www.esri.cao.go.jp; Consensus Forecasts; Bloomberg; CEIC Data Company; Haver Analytics; World Bank, \nGlobal\u00a0Commodity Markets, http://www.worldbank.org; ADB estimates.\n\nWorsening\u00a0public health conditions and resulting mobility \nrestrictions in the US will substantially squelch economic \nactivity, which is projected to slow from 2.3% in\u00a02019 \nto\u00a00.4% in 2020 (with contraction in the second quarter) \nbefore growth recovers to reach 2.1% in 2021, helped by the \nrecently announced $2\u00a0trillion stimulus package. The euro \narea is expected to fall from 1.2% growth in 2019 to 1.0% \ncontraction in 2020. The large negative impact of COVID-19 \nwill be partly offset by policy responses, such as Germany\u2019s \n$610 billion lending program and the European Central \nBank\u2019s \u20ac750\u00a0billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program. \nGrowth\u00a0in the euro area is forecast to recover to 1.6% in 2021 \nwith exports restored and able to spur a rebound\u00a0in investment. \nOil\u00a0prices\u00a0are expected to decline from $64/barrel in 2019 to \n$35/barrel in 2020 before rebounding to $55/barrel in 2021 as \ndemand\u00a0recovers. Across most advanced economies, monetary \nand fiscal policies are expected to remain supportive to \nshore\u00a0up growth this year and\u00a0next. \n\nMuch of the expected decline in regional growth stems \nfrom a slowdown in the PRC. Growth there is projected to \nfall from 6.1% in 2019 to 2.3% in 2020 before accelerating to \n7.3% in 2021. The\u00a0dip in economic activity in the PRC reflects \nboth demand-side and supply-side domestic disruptions \nfrom\u00a0COVID-19. Data\u00a0for the first 2 months of\u00a02020 indicate \ndouble-digit contractions in industrial production and retail \nsales (Figure\u00a01.1.18), an outturn much worse than those \nwitnessed during the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998, the \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome\u00a0(SARS) epidemic of 2003, or \nthe global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. \n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak(cid:30)(cid:30)19\n\nFigure 1.1.18\u2002 PRC retail sales and industrial production\n\nDouble-digit contraction in industry and retail sales indicate a sizeable decline in the PRC economic activity. \n\nAFC\nSARS\nGFC\nCOVID-19 outbreak\n\nA.

Fiscal\u00a0policy should become more supportive. \nGovernment\u00a0spending, especially on health care, is expected \nto increase further this\u00a0year. Infrastructure investment is \nexpected to pick up from Q2, with an increase in special bond \nissues by local governments, which were higher early in\u00a02020 \nand are expected to stay high through 2021. Monetary\u00a0policy \nin the PRC will likely remain accommodative this year and \nnext through further cuts to the medium-term lending \nfacility rate and the reserve requirement ratio, as well as a \nspecial onlending program for selected industries and smaller \nenterprises.\n\nThe outlook for India remains subdued, with growth \nslowing from 5.0% in fiscal 2019 to 4.0% this year and then \nstrengthening to 6.2% next year. COVID-19 has not yet spread \nextensively in India, but containment measures including \na national lockdown and a weaker global environment will \nwhip\u00a0up headwinds with demand depressed and supply \ndisrupted. In late March, the government has taken immediate \naction to strengthen the health system and support the \npoor and vulnerable. The Reserve Bank of India has cut its \npolicy rate to the lowest ever, undertaken unconventional \nmeasures, and committed to using all instruments to fight the \npandemic. Both urban and rural consumption rebound in\u00a02021 \n\n\f20(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nsupported by reduced personal income taxes and increased \nassistance to agriculture and rural areas. Corporate tax cuts \nand increased public investment in infrastructure, including in \nthe National Infrastructure Pipeline, will revive investment. \nThe\u00a0recapitalization of state-owned banks and financial sector \nreform to revive credit promise to help alleviate much of the \nfinancial stress that has undermined growth prospects in \nprevious years.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak will take a substantial toll \non growth in all economies in East Asia this year, driving \nsubregional growth down to 2.0%. Higher growth at 6.5% \nis forecast for 2021 as the outbreak subsides. In Hong Kong, \nChina, recession will continue on faltering domestic and \nexternal demand, but fiscal measures and higher exports will \nlead recovery at 3.5% in 2021. In Taipei,China, growth will \ndip this year to 1.8% before reviving to 2.5% on recovering \nexports and public outlays\u2014as in the Republic of Korea, with \ngrowth at 1.3% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021. In Mongolia, growth \nwill fall sharply to 2.1% in 2020 on lower inflow of foreign \ndirect investment but rebound to 4.6% in 2021 as mining and \ninvestment pick up. \n\nGrowth in Southeast Asia will decelerate from 4.4% in \n\n2019 to 1.0% in 2020 before rebounding to 4.7% in 2021. \nAll\u00a011\u00a0economies in the subregion will post lower growth in \n2020 than in 2019 because of COVID-19, especially considering \nthe subregion\u2019s strong trade and investment ties with the PRC. \nIndonesia, the largest economy in the subregion, will decelerate \nfrom 5.0% in 2019 to 2.5% this year and bounce back to 5.0% \nin 2021. Tourism-dependent Thailand, the second largest \neconomy in the subregion, is forecast to reverse 2.4% expansion \nin 2019 with 4.8% contraction before recovering to 2.5% in \n2021. Similarly, GDP growth in the Philippines will decelerate \nto 2.0% this year, even as the impact of COVID-19 and the \nglobal slowdown are partly offset by government expansionary \npolicies that will help lift growth to 6.5% in 2021. Growth in \nViet Nam has stuck close to an annual pace of 7.0% in recent \nyears but will decelerate to 4.8% in 2020 before recovering to \n6.8% in\u00a02021. Cambodia, which has strong economic ties with \nthe PRC, will be unable to sustain average annual GDP growth \nabove 7.0% in recent years, slumping to 2.3% this year and \nrecovering somewhat to 5.7% in\u00a02021. Singapore will continue \nits growth slowdown that began in 2018, expanding in 2020 by \na paltry 0.2% before reviving to 2.0% in\u00a02021. \n\nCountries in South Asia are expected to be adversely \naffected to varying degrees by the economic impact of efforts \nto contain COVID-19 in 2020. Growth in South Asia is forecast \nto decelerate from 5.1% in 2019 to 4.1% in 2020 and rebound \nto 6.0% in 2021. In Bangladesh, growth will slip from 8.2% in \n2019 to 7.8% this year as major markets pull back demand for \nits fast fashion garment exports.

Growth is expected to bounce back to a high 7.5% \nin 2021 as pent-up demand is released. In Sri Lanka, ebbing \nglobal demand will stunt expansion in the tourism and garment \nindustries, slowing growth to 2.2% in 2020 before expected \nrecovery to 3.5% in 2021. In Nepal, growth is forecast to slip from \n7.1% in 2019 to 5.3% in 2020 with weakness in both agriculture \nand tourism, then strengthen to 6.4% in 2021. Growth in Bhutan \nis forecast to strengthen to 5.2% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2021 on \nhigh government expenditure under a new 5-year plan, and \ndespite depressed international tourist arrivals. In Afghanistan, \ngrowth is forecast unchanged in 2020 but picking up to 4.0% \nin\u00a02021 on improving business and consumer confidence.\n\nGrowth will slow in Central Asia in 2020 as the impact \n\nof COVID-19 reverberates, before recovering in 2021. \nHaving\u00a0accelerated to 4.9% in 2019, subregional growth is \nprojected to slow to 2.8% in 2020 as growth decelerates in all \neight economies, recovering to 4.2% in 2021 as growth picks up \nin six of them. Expansion in Kazakhstan, the region\u2019s largest \neconomy, is projected to slow to 1.8% in 2020 as oil and gas \nproduction stagnates, petroleum prices decline, and expansion \nin the economy aside from the large petroleum industry is \nenfeebled by cuts to public investment spending. An expected \nrise in oil production and government support for manufacturing \nare projected to boost growth to 3.6% in 2021.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, growth will slow to 0.5% as oil prices decline, \n\nbut higher oil and gas production will lift growth to 1.5% in \n2021. Slower expansion in hydrocarbon output and exports in \nTurkmenistan is projected to reduce growth to 6.0% in 2020 \nand 5.8% in 2021. In Uzbekistan, weaker demand and prices for \ncopper and natural gas will, along with the effects of COVID-19, \ncut growth to 4.7% in 2020, with slightly higher expansion in \nservices lifting growth to 5.8% in 2021. In Armenia,\u00a0COVID-19 \nwill slash growth from the unusually high rate of 7.6% achieved \nin 2019 to 2.2% in 2020, but the realization of structural reform \npromises to revive expansion to 4.5% in 2021. In\u00a0Georgia, \nCOVID-19 and monetary tightening are projected to slow growth \nto zero this year, picking up to 4.5% in 2021. Tajikistan\u00a0will slow \nto 5.5% growth in 2020 and 5.0% in 2021 as fiscal consolidation \nsqueezes growth in public investment and as remittances from \nthe Russian Federation decline. With growth slowing in the PRC, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic will decelerate to 4.0% growth in 2020 \ndespite higher gold output, edging up to 4.5% in\u00a02021.\n\n\f22(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nGrowth in the Pacific is projected at \u20130.3% in\u00a02020 as all \neconomies slow and COVID-19 hammers in particular those \nwith large tourism industries: the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau, \nSamoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Commodity exports\u2014mainly from \nFiji, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands\u2014will also be \nadversely affected.

In the PRC, \nhigher pork prices will push inflation to 3.6% in 2020 \nbefore it retreats to 1.9% in 2021 as those prices normalize. \nIn Hong\u00a0Kong, China and in Taipei,China, inflation will \ndecelerate in 2020 but reaccelerate in 2021 as economic \nactivity rebounds. Inflation in the ROK will edge up to 0.9% \nthis year and 1.3% next, while in Mongolia it will slow this year \nand quicken next year.\n\nAs growth slows in Southeast Asia, inflation should remain \n\ntame. Average inflation in the subregion is forecast to fall to \n1.9% in 2020 before rising to 2.2% in 2021, but with significant \ndifferences by country across the subregion.

Much of the decline in 2021 will come from \nUzbekistan, where monetary tightening is expected to reduce \ncredit sharply and slow inflation from 14.6% in 2019 to 13.0% this \nyear and 10.0% in 2021. Monetary tightening is also projected to \ntrim inflation in Georgia from 4.9% in 2019 to 4.5% this year and \n3.0% in 2021. \n\nInflation is projected to slow in Turkmenistan from 13.4% \nin 2019 to 13.0% this year and 8.0% in 2021, and in Azerbaijan \nfrom 2.6% in 2019 to 2.5% this year with slower growth, but \nrising to 3.5% in 2021 as growth recovers somewhat. Kazakhstan \nwill likely see inflation rise to 6.0% in 2020 as its currency \ndepreciates but then ease to 5.7% in 2021 with monetary \ntightening and administrative limits on markups for key food \nitems. In the Kyrgyz Republic, inflation is projected to quicken \nfrom 1.1% in 2019 to 3.5% this year before relaxing to 3.0% in \n2021, and in Tajikistan from 8.0% in 2019 to 9.0% this year \nas salaries increase before returning to 8.0% in 2021. Fiscal \nexpansion should lift inflation in Armenia from 1.4% in 2019 to \n2.8% this year before consolidation reduces it to 2.2% in\u00a02021.\n\nIn the Pacific, inflation will likely ease from 3.0% in 2019 to \n\n2.7% this year as demand wanes before rising to 3.8% in 2021. \nIt is projected to moderate in 8 of 14 subregional economies, \nexcepting the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, \nSolomon Islands, and Tuvalu. Nauru and Tonga will experience \nthe steepest falls in line with subdued global fuel prices and \ntransport costs.

With many countries introducing \nprogressively stricter lockdowns and mobility limitations, \nthe global pandemic continues to upend production, trade, \nand tourism, both within the region and with the rest of the \nworld. Aside from rapid deterioration in global PMIs, both \ncomposite and manufacturing, other leading indicators point \nto substantial suppression of global trade volume. The Services \nTrade\u00a0Barometer of the World Trade Organization released on \n11\u00a0March 2020 shows that growth in global trade in services \ncontinued to slow in late 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, with \na reading of 98.4 in September sliding further away from 100, \nthe threshold for trend growth, to 96.8 in the latest reading. \nSubcomponents in the aggregate index covered to January show \npassenger air travel falling to 93.5 and container shipping to 94.3, \nthese largest declines indicating early disruption from COVID-19. \nFurther, the Baltic Dry Index on shipping performance continued \non a downward trajectory begun in the last quarter of 2019 to \n411 in early February, its lowest reading in nearly 4 years, before \nrecovering somewhat in March. Changes in container throughput \nyear on year to January sketch a similar picture, with\u00a0Hong Kong, \nChina shrinking by 20.4%; the Republic of Korea by 2.5%; and \nTaipei,China by 7.1%. \n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) flows present a similarly \ngloomy outlook. In a special issue of Investment Trends Monitor\npublished on 8 March, the United Nations Conference on Trade \nand Development forecasts that COVID-19 will put paid previous \nprojections of marginal growth in trend FDI, bringing instead \na decline in global FDI flows by 5% in 2020, assuming the \nglobal outbreak is brought under control in the first half of the \nyear. A\u00a0worse scenario that assumes the health crisis persisting \nthroughout the year causes a 15% drop, with negative demand \neffects carrying over to 2021. While\u00a0highlighting a likely global \nslowdown in market-seeking FDI and investment projects in \nextractive industries in response to negative demand shocks, \nthe\u00a0projections also point to significant drops in efficiency-\nseeking FDI in East and Southeast Asia, in\u00a0particular the PRC, \nbecause of their high integration in global value\u00a0chains. \n\nThe report also highlights a fall in profits for foreign affiliates \nof multinational enterprises (MNEs) as a further channel through \nwhich COVID-19 will affect the outlook for FDI, considering \nthat reinvested earnings typically make up a large share of \nFDI flows. Data for the global top 5,000 multinationals as of \n8\u00a0March show earnings forecasts for 2020 revised down by an \naverage of 9% since 1\u00a0February, with the energy, automotive, \ntravel, and tourism industries particularly affected (Table\u00a01.1.4). \n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak(cid:30)(cid:30)25\n\nTable 1.1.4\u2002 Earnings revisions of the top 5000 multinational enterprises and relative importance  \n\nof\u00a0reinvested earnings in\u00a0FDI, by region\n\nThe COVID-19 shock will affect FDI \ufb02ows via a fall in reinvested earnings of MNEs.\n\nNumber of companies \nwith\u00a0earnings revision\n\nAverage earnings revision  \n(%)\n\nShare of reinvested earnings \nin FDI, 2018 (%)\n\nRegion/economy\n\nDeveloped\n\nDeveloping economies\n\nAfrica\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\n\u00bbSingapore\n\n\u00bbPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\n\u00bbRepublic of Korea\n\n\u00bbMalaysia\n\n\u00bbThailand\n\n\u00bbViet Nam\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean\n\nTransition economies\n\nTotal\n\n2,334\n\n\u2002\u2002864\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200242\n\n\u2002\u2002730\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200216\n\n\u2002\u2002259\n\n\u2002\u2002121\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200233\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200232\n\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u20028\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200292\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200228\n\n3,226\n\n61\n\n40\n\n27\n\n41\n\n...\n\n...\n\n22\n\n...\n\n72\n\n...\n\n43\n\n93\n\n52\n\n\u2002\u20136\n\n\u201316\n\n\u2002\u20131\n\n\u201318\n\n\u201330\n\n\u201326\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201310\n\n\u2002\u20136\n\n\u201310\n\n\u2002\u20139\n\n2018\n2019\n2020f\n2021f\n\n% of GDP\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20136\n\n... = data not available, FDI = foreign direct investment, MNE = multinational enterprise.\nSource: Investment Trends Monitor, UNCTAD (March 2020), https://unctad.org/en/pages/publications/Global-Investment-Trends-Monitor-(Series).aspx.\n\nThe\u00a0revision\u00a0is\u00a0much\u00a0larger for developing countries, at \n16% lower earnings, than for developed economies, at 6% \nless, and is\u00a0particularly significant\u00a0in\u00a0Asia, where earnings \nexpectations in some economies are slashed by 18%. \nAs\u00a0the\u00a0reinvested earnings component of FDI in the region \nwas 41% in 2018, these substantial downward revisions \nforetell sizeable effects on FDI from earnings losses.\n\nThe developing Asia current account surplus is projected \nto edge up slightly to the equivalent of 1.6% of aggregate\u00a0GDP \nin 2020 and fall back to 1.4% in 2021.

Other risks still come from \na range of issues, of course, from natural hazards to geopolitical \nevents. Trade conflict remains an important risk. While the \nphase one deal eased trade tensions between the PRC and the \nUS, it is only a fragile truce featuring import commitments that \nthe PRC will find more difficult to meet in the current economic \nenvironment than when the deal was negotiated. By far the most \npressing risk to the regional and global outlook comes, however, \nfrom the global COVID-19 pandemic. Forecasts here assume \ncontainment within this year and a return to normal next year. \nThe future evolution and effects of the outbreak are highly \nuncertain, however, and some of the many ways in which events \ncould unfold that are worse than the baseline are as follows.\n\nThe pandemic could easily spread more widely. \nJust\u00a0a\u00a0month before this report went to press, the PRC \nstill accounted for 93% of global cases and 97% of global \nfatalities. In just 1 month, the PRC share in the global total \nhas fallen below 20%, with at least 25 countries having more \nthan 2,000 cases each as of 27 March. The situation changes \nvery rapidly, with case counts in some countries doubling \nevery few days. Many\u00a0countries for which these forecasts \nassume no domestic outbreak could see serious outbreaks \noccurring in the near\u00a0future.\n\nCountry outbreaks could last much longer than assumed \n\nbefore containment. In the Special Topic that follows, the \nassumed range is 3\u20136 months, supported by experience in \nthe PRC and the ROK. But outbreaks in other countries \ncould last longer because governments differ in their ability \nto respond. Second-wave outbreaks cannot be ruled out. \nAnd, even after an outbreak ends, economic activity may \ntake a long time to normalize. Even in the PRC, which has \nalready started reporting days with no new local COVID-19 \ncases, activity has yet to return to normal.\n\nSevere financial turmoil and financial crises cannot \nbe discounted. Movements in equity markets, exchange \nrates, bond spreads, and volatility indexes have been sharp, \nreminiscent of the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 \nand in some cases exceeding it.

This\u00a0poses a danger, particularly in light of a \ndecade-long rise in regional debt, primarily private but some \nof it public, that has been flagged in past issues of ADO. \nOne segment that may be susceptible to tightening financial \nconditions and a worsening economic environment are small \nand medium-sized enterprises (Box\u00a01.1.1). \n\nBox 1.1.1\u2002COVID-19 attacks PRC earnings and sustainability\n\nFirms in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nhave seen their earnings plunge as the COVID-19 \nepidemic spread across the country and crippled \nthe economy. Retail and consumer spending remain \nheavily depressed, and production has struggled to \nrestart after coming nearly to a standstill at the end \nof January this year. The sectors most exposed are \nretail and consumer services, leisure and tourism, real \nestate, transportation, and utilities. Heavily affected \nas well are manufacturing firms that have suffered \ndisruption along their supply chains, notably those in \nthe automotive, electrical, and electronics industries. \nWhile most firms in affected industries suffer, earnings \nare a less stringent factor in determining the viability \nof the state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Of greater \nconcern are small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs), a growing share of which have seen their \nearnings drop to a point that they may soon be unable \nto service their debt. \n\nTo assess the vulnerability of SMEs in the PRC \nunder the two scenarios (which informed a broader \neconomic impact assessment discussed elsewhere), a \n50% reduction in affected firms\u2019 earnings is envisaged \nlasting for 3 months or, in a worst-case scenario, for \n6 months.a Considering a continuing dearth of data \nabout the impact of this crisis on specific areas in the \nPRC economy, keeping scenarios this simple allows \neasy interpretation and is best thought of as implicitly \nencompassing a range of plausible circumstances. \nThese include possible impacts in excess of a 50% \nplunge but over a shorter period or a slow recovery \nwith earnings less depressed but for a longer period, \nup to a year.\n\nThe proportion of a firm\u2019s earnings to its interest \n\npayment obligations\u2014the interest coverage ratio \n(ICR)\u2014is the metric for distinguishing firms deemed \nsustainable (ICR) from those that are not (ICR <1).b \nA ratio less than 1 signals a firm\u2019s impending liquidity \nshortage and difficulty making payments, and a risk \nthat nonperforming loan status will ensue. Aggregating \nthe debt outstanding of firms with ICRs less than 1 \nprovides a measure of total debt at risk among affected \nfirms and their economic segments. \n\nUsing the latest data available, from 2018, in the \n\nOrbis company database on PRC firms\u2019 earnings \nbefore interest and taxes, and their interest payments, \nthe ICR was computed for a sample of 4,740 SMEs.c \nIncluded\u00a0firms had financial statements, which \nexcluded all companies that did not report as well\u00a0as \nmillions of small firms across the PRC industrial \nlandscape that were not in the Orbis database. \nThus,\u00a0the sample likely underestimated the portion \nof debt at risk in the larger population of companies. \nThis\u00a0scenario analysis cannot be strictly accurate but is \na rough indicator of orders of magnitude.\n\nWith this caveat in mind, analysis found 6.4% of \nreporting SMEs\u2019 total debt outstanding at risk in 2018, \nthe baseline year (box figure). Halving firms\u2019 earnings \nfor 3 months raised this share by 1.6\u00a0percentage points \nas a greater proportion of firms\u2019 ICRs fell below 1 and \ntheir leverage added to the pile of debt that might \nnever be repaid. This relatively small increment \nsuggests a certain resilience to a 3-month shock. \nHowever, should the earnings stay compressed for \n3\u00a0months longer, 6 six months in total, a\u00a0significantly \nhigher share of firms would have trouble paying \ninterest. Debt at risk would rise by a further \n10.4\u00a0percentage point to 18.5% of total debt, or nearly \nthree times the baseline.d\n\nWhile nearly a fifth of debt could thus end up \n\njeopardized or at least problematic, most firms \nincluded in the sample seemed to be well cushioned \nagainst a temporary plunge in earnings. In the 2018 \nbaseline, they were scattered well above the ICR =\u00a01 \nline shown in the figure, with a median ICR equal \nto\u00a010 and its interquartile range spanning about\u00a04\u201353. \nThe\u00a0ICR distribution compresses somewhat as \nearnings shrink under the two scenarios, and the \nmedian falls to about 8 if the earnings ordeal lasts \nfor 6 months, but most firms\u2019 debt appears to remain \nserviceable.\n\nHowever, SME debt at risk above 18% would \n\nbe of considerable concern to policy\u00a0makers, \ninducing them to devise adequate support to \nstruggling firms to avert systemic risk from a \nresultingly sharp increase in nonperforming loans. \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f28(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nBox 1.1.1\u2002Continued\n\nSME debt at risk in affected segments, % of all debt\n\nDebt held by \ufb01rms with ICR<1 (%)\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n+10.4\n\nICR\n\n55\n\n44\n\n33\n\n22\n\n11\n\n0\n\n+1.6\n\n6.4\n\nICR = 1\n\n2018\n\n3 months\n\n6 months\n\n SMEs include \ufb01rms with fewer than 2,000 employees.\n Debt at risk is that held by \ufb01rms with ICRs < 1.\n\nICR = interest coverage ratio, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SMEs = small \nand medium-sized enterprises.\nNotes: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)   Affected industries include utilities, construction, manufacturing, retail \ntrade, transportation and warehousing, telecommunications, real estate, \nrental and leasing, accommodation, food services, and art, entertainment, \nand recreation. \n Scenarios consider a 50% fall in earnings for 3 or 6 months. \n The vertical lines represent the interquartile range of the ICR for each \nscenario, with axis on the right hand side.

Recognizing these risks, the \nPRC monetary and financial regulatory bodies took \nearly steps in late February to support SMEs. They \nessentially instructed lenders to roll over SME loans \nfalling due, not to downgrade loans with missed \npayments, and to defer by several months the reporting \nof any delinquencies to the country\u2019s credit-scoring \nsystem. These and other support measures for micro \nand small enterprises, such as a temporary waiver of \nsocial security contributions, are described in Box 3.11.1 \non page 194.\n\nWhile helping SME survival rates, these support \nmeasures are bound to weigh on the balance sheets \nof banks and providers of shadow finance, stressing \na system already struggling impaired profitability in \nSOE clients and itself.

A sharp fall in global \ndemand has already depressed oil prices beyond the lows \nreached during the global financial crisis or the commodity \nprice collapse in 2015. Travel bans around the world as of \n25\u00a0March\u00a02020 affect more than 550 million international \ntravelers, more than 40% of the total. \n\nOther adverse impacts may come through many channels. \n\nDisruption to production and trade are clearly extensive, \nbut it is very difficult at present to evaluate how they will \naffect economies, both domestically and through global \nsupply\u00a0chains. Remittance-dependent economies may \nstruggle as many migrant workers are unable to return to \ntheir countries of employment. In countries with inadequate \nsocial safety nets, large losses of jobs, wages, and wealth \ncould trigger social unrest. And, if the scale of the outbreak \nincreases to the extent that it infects a substantial portion of \nthe global population, as some experts predict, the impact on \npublic health will be significant. Even education has taken \na hit as schools around the world have closed for extended \nperiods.\n\nFinally, the pandemic has the potential to change the \n\nworld economy in fundamental ways. For starters, the \nrapid spread of the virus across countries has laid bare the \ndownside of highly integrated global production processes \nand heavy specialization, vulnerable as they are to shutdowns \non a global scale and for prolonged periods caused by \nmassive disruption to transport and trade. The outbreak \ncould thus leave permanent scars on globalization, which \nhas underpinned the rise of developing Asia. In such an \nenvironment, countries will need to rely more on internally-\ngenerated growth\u2014including through domestic innovation \nactivity such as research and development. The use of \ntechnology itself, such as technology that enables transactions \nat a distance, could also be forever changed. Even though such \nchanges will manifest only with the passage of time, what the \nCOVID-19 crisis has already made clear is the extent to which \ntechnological innovation will shape the way we do things \nand interact in the future. The\u00a0challenge for developing Asia, \nand the world as a whole, is to foster innovation to promote \nand sustain a process of inclusive growth\u2014the topic of this \nreport\u2019s theme chapter.\n\n\f30(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on \ndeveloping Asia\u2014An update\n\nThe ADB\u2019s first estimates of the economic impact of the COVID-19 \noutbreak were released in early March. Since then the outbreak \nhas become a global pandemic; the use of containment policies and \ntravel bans has proliferated; and data from the People\u2019s Republic \nof China suggest a sharp contraction there in the first quarter \nof 2020.

The analysis provides estimates of the \nimpact on individual economies in developing\u00a0Asia, and on sectors \nwithin them.\n\nThe current pandemic is the most severe in a century. \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified \nin December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The virus that \ncauses this disease is similar to the coronaviruses that \ncaused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in \n2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in \n2012. The\u00a0mortality rate is currently estimated by the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) at 3%\u20134% of those \nreported infected, but some studies put it as high as 5.7%. \nBoth figures likely overestimate the true mortality rate, \nassuming that many victims recover from undiagnosed \nand unreported cases. The true mortality rate of COVID-19 \nis likely to be significantly lower than for SARS at 10% \nor MERS at 34% but higher than for seasonal flu at 0.1% \n(Table\u00a01.2.1). What is important to the spread of the \noutbreak, however, is the COVID-19 infection rate, more \nprecisely its reproduction number, or the average number \nof new infections generated by a single infectious person. \nStudies show that it could be high, with a top estimate more \nthan double that of SARS and five times that of seasonal flu.\nThe epidemic was primarily concentrated in the PRC \nin January and February. Health officials in the PRC first \nalerted WHO of 41 unusual pneumonia cases in Wuhan on \n31\u00a0December 2019. By 23 January, the number of confirmed \ncases had reached 571, prompting the PRC to place Wuhan, \na metropolis of 11 million people, under quarantine. \n\nThis section was written by Abdul Abiad of the Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department, ADB, Manila, and Rosa Mia Arao, Reizle Platitas, \nJesson\u00a0Pagaduan, and Christian Jabagat, consultants, Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\nTable 1.2.1\u2002 Mortality and infection rates of \nCOVID-19 and other epidemics\n\nCOVID-19 has only a moderate mortality rate  \nbut is highly infectious.\n\nMortality rate, \n% of cases \ncausing death\n\nReproduction \nnumber, \nnew\u00a0infections \ngenerated per \ninfected person\n\nEbola\n\nMERS\n\nSARS\n\nCOVID-19\n\nSeasonal flu\n\n50\n\n34\n\n10\n\n3\u20135.7\n\n0.1\n\n1.5\u20132.5\n\n0.4\u20130.9\n\n3\n\n1.4\u20136.5\n\n1.3\n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, MERS = Middle\u00a0East \nrespiratory syndrome, SARS\u00a0=\u00a0severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome.\nSources: World Health Organization; Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention; Althus 2014; Baud et al. 2020; \nChoi\u00a0et al. 2018; Heymann and Shindo 2020; Liu et al. 2020; \nWu and McGoogan 2020.\n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak(cid:29)(cid:29)31\n\nFigure 1.2.1\u2002Global COVID-19 Cases\n\nCOVID-19 is now a global pandemic.\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nEurope\nUnited States\nRest of the world\n\nA.

While there \nwere cases outside of the PRC as early as 20 January in Thailand \nand 21 January in the US, at the end of February the epidemic was \nstill primarily within the PRC, which had 93% of global cases and \n97% of global fatalities. That was the data used in the ADB\u00a0Brief\nreleased on 6 March 2020, when ADB did its initial estimate of the \neconomic impact of the outbreak.1\n\nThe outbreak quickly became a global pandemic in March. \nCOVID-19 cases started rising in Iran, Italy, and the Republic\u00a0of \nKorea in the last few days of February and accelerated in\u00a0March. \nOther countries that soon started seeing rapid increases in \nCOVID-19 cases were France, Germany, Spain, and the\u00a0US \n(Figure 1.2.1, panel B). On 11 March, WHO declared the \nCOVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Cases steadily increased \nglobally through March, crossing on 27 March the half-million \nmark. By\u00a028\u00a0March, the US had surpassed Italy and the PRC in \nconfirmed cases, with Europe as a whole accounting for 54% of \nglobal cases, the US 15%, the PRC 14%, and the rest of the world \n17% (Figure\u00a01.2.1, panel A). \n\nThis ADO Special Topic updates ADB estimates of the \neconomic\u00a0impact of COVID-19. The initial ADB estimates of \neconomic impact from the COVID-19 outbreak were presented \nin an ADB Brief released on 6 March. In the month since then, \nthree important changes have occurred that necessitate an\u00a0update. \n\n\f32(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe\u00a0first is the escalation of the outbreak into a global pandemic, \nas noted above. The second is the arrival of the first hard evidence, \nfrom the PRC, of how the outbreak and resulting containment \npolicies negatively affected consumption and investment. The third \nchange is the sharp rise in the deployment of containment policies \nsuch as travel bans, border closures, and quarantines. Scenario \nassumptions have been updated to reflect these developments. \nAs\u00a0in\u00a0the 6\u00a0March ADB\u00a0Brief, the analysis here describes the various \nchannels through which economies can be affected. It explicitly lays \nout the assumptions underlying various scenarios regarding how \nthe outbreak may play out. It\u00a0then quantifies the likely magnitude of \neach scenario\u2019s economic impact. Finally, it provides details on how \nindividual economies and sectors within them will be affected. \nCOVID-19 will affect economic activity through multiple \nquantifiable channels. The channels used in this analysis include \ndeclines in domestic consumption and investment from containment \npolicies and precautionary behavior. The\u00a0induced decline in domestic \ndemand is likely to be the most important channel of economic \nimpact in economies with serious outbreaks, or in economies \nwhich implement strong containment policies preemptively even \nbefore an outbreak becomes serious. Travel bans, border closures, \nand reduced demand for travel will affect tourism, transport, and \ntrade. This\u00a0will\u00a0be important for more open and tourism-dependent \neconomies. Weaker demand in one sector can spill over to other \nsectors, both domestically or internationally, through production and \ntrade links. As in\u00a0the 6\u00a0March ADB Brief, the analysis accounts for \nand quantifies effects through these channels. \n\nMany additional channels for affects on economic activity \nare not as easily analyzed or quantified. These channels include \ndisrupted supply from production stoppages or border closures, \nwhich can affect other industries that use these intermediate \ninputs. Hard data on which sectors have seen significant supply \ndisruptions, how long the disruptions will last, and whether \nother industries have sufficient inventories is lacking. And part \nof the impact of the supply-side shock is already captured in the \nanalysis, as disruptions lead to declines in household incomes and \ncorporate profits which reduce domestic demand. Weaker global \ndemand because of the pandemic has also forced down prices for \noil and other commodities. This will slow growth in economies \nthat produce and export these products even as it lowers inflation \nin consuming economies. Remittances can be affected in many \nways, as the pandemic affects not only migrant workers\u2019 home \ncountries but also the countries where they work. But hard data \non how remittances have been affected is still lacking. The scale \nof the economic shock has roiled financial markets and tightened \nfinancial conditions, heightening the risk of financial crises. Lastly, \neconomic effects can flow directly from worsened disease incidence \nand mortality, as\u00a0well\u00a0as from forced shifts in health care spending. \nADB\u00a0is working on quantifying impact through these channels and \nwill present results in upcoming reports. \n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak(cid:29)(cid:29)33\n\nFigure 1.2.2\u2002 Economic activity in the PRC\n\nPRC data indicate sharp contraction in the  \n\ufb01rst 2 months of 2020.\n\nRetail sales\nIndustrial production in real terms\nFixed asset investment\nService production in real terms\n\n% change year on year, year-to-date\n\n\u201313.0\n\u201313.5\n\n\u201320.5\n\u201324.5\n\nJan\u2013Feb\n2019\n\nJun\n\nSep\n\nJan\u2013Feb\n2020\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company.\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201330\n\nPRC consumption and investment fell substantially \nin the first 2 months of 2020. Combined data for January \nand February indicate that retail sales in those months \nfell by 20.5% from the same period in 2019 (Figure 1.2.2). \nFixed\u00a0asset investment fell by even more, contracting by \n24.5%. Supply-side data on production in industry and \nservices also showed double-digit declines. Because January \nwas little affected by the nascent COVID-19 outbreak, most \nof the decline must have come in February, implying year \non year declines of about 40% for consumption and 50% for \ninvestment in that month. If consumption and investment \nin March made\u00a0up half the ground toward normalization \nfrom February\u2019s sharp decline, that would suggest declines \nin March year on year by about 20% in retail sales and \n25% in investment. These\u00a0figures are consistent with \navailable high-frequency proxies for economic activity in \nthe PRC, described below. If activity returns to normal in \nApril, consumption in the year as a whole is estimated to \nbe 5\u00a0percentage points below normal, and investment by \n6.25\u00a0percentage points. These are the declines in consumption \nand investment growth used for the PRC in this analysis.\n\nSince mid-March, many countries have declared states \n\nof emergency. As of 24 March, 50 countries that together \nprovide 39% of global GDP had declared a state of emergency \nin response to COVID-19, and 174 countries had enacted some \nform of school closure (Figure 1.2.3). Many countries have \ninstituted community quarantines and stay-at-home policies to \nslow virus transmission. \n\nTravel bans and border closures spread in March, hurting \ntourism-dependent economies. One of the earliest travel bans \nwas imposed on 24 January, when the PRC prohibited all \noutbound travel by tour groups, or 55% of all tourism outbound \nfrom the PRC. In late January and early February, many \ncountries also imposed bans on travel to the PRC. The\u00a0use of \ntravel bans accelerated in March as the pandemic spread to \nmany other countries. Analysis using bilateral tourist arrivals \ndata from past years suggests that current travel bans will \naffect more than 550\u00a0million international trips, or over \n40% of the total\u00a0in a typical year (Figure\u00a01.2.4). Arrivals and \ntourism receipts in many economies in developing Asia are \nthus expected to decline sharply as a result of these travel bans \nand precautionary behavior. Tourism is an important revenue \nsource in many economies in developing\u00a0Asia. International \ntourism receipts provide more than 40% of GDP in Maldives \nand Palau, for example, and total travel and tourism receipts \nincluding domestic tourism exceed 10% of GDP in almost half \nof ADB\u00a0developing member countries (DMCs).\n\n\f34(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 1.2.3\u2002Emergency declarations and school closures in response to COVID-19\n\nMany countries have imposed a state of emergency and enacted containment policies.\n\nCountries declaring a state of emergency\n\nCountries with school closures\n\nNumber of countries\n\n% of global GDP\n\nNumber of countries\n\n% of global GDP\n\nNumber\n\n% of global GDP\n\nNumber\n\n25 Mar:\n174 countries,\n98% of world GDP\n\n% of global GDP\n\n100\n\n24 Mar:\n50 countries,\n39% of global GDP\n\n48\n\n40\n\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n200\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n31 Jan 7 Feb\n\n14 Feb 21 Feb 28 Feb 6 Mar 13 Mar 20 Mar\n\n16 Feb 21 Feb 26 Feb 2 Mar 7 Mar 12 Mar 17 Mar 22 Mar\n\nSource: CICC Macro Research.\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n600\n\n450\n\n300\n\n150\n\n0\n\nLower demand will spill over to other areas through trade \n\nand production links.

High-frequency data indicate that PRC \neconomic activity began to normalize in March but is not yet \ncompletely back to normal. One such daily activity tracker, \nby\u00a0China International Capital Corporation, combines data on \ncoal consumption, labor migration, freight logistics, and urban \ntransport use. The tracker suggests that February\u00a0activity \naveraged 53% below normal, and data to 26\u00a0March show March \nactivity averaging about 21% below normal. Labor\u00a0migration, \ncoal consumption, and freight logistics indicators have returned \nto normal, but urban transportation is still far below normal \n(Figure\u00a01.2.5).\n\nThe unpredictable COVID-19 outbreak trajectory requires \nthe use of multiple scenarios. Huge uncertainties persist over \nhow quickly affected economies can get outbreaks under control \nand normalize economic activity. While\u00a0current\u00a0evidence from \nthe PRC suggests that outbreaks can be ended in 3 months, \nno guarantee exists that outbreak duration in other countries \nwill be similar. Even in the PRC, activity has not yet fully \nnormalized, as\u00a0noted above. Many\u00a0restrictions including some \ntravel bans remain, and the possibility of a resurgence in \nCOVID-19 cases cannot be ruled out. This argues for allowing \nin scenarios some variation in duration. This analysis assumes \ncontainment in 3\u00a0months in a better scenario, and in 6\u00a0months \nin a worse scenario. Outbreaks\u00a0of even longer duration are \npossible, especially in less-developed economies where capacity \nto implement required policies is more limited and health systems \nare less developed. There is also uncertainty about how deeply \ndomestic demand will decline as a result of the outbreak and \ncontainment measures. The\u00a06\u00a0March ADB Brief assumed declines \nin consumption and investment growth by 2 percentage points \nfrom normal, and that assumption is repeated here in the better \nscenario. In\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Korea and Singapore, outbreaks have \nbeen held at bay through social distancing, extensive testing, and \ncontact tracing, without resort to widespread quarantines or stay-\nat-home policies that are more deleterious to economic activity. \nAt the other end, PRC data show that declines in consumption \ngrowth could be as large as 5 percentage points and in investment \ngrowth 6.25\u00a0percentage points. The analysis thus considers two \nscenarios, with assumptions detailed in Table 1.2.2:\n\n(i)\n\nBetter scenario with shorter containment and smaller \ndemand shocks. Economies suffering serious outbreaks3\ntake 3 months to contain them, with restrictive\u00a0policies, \ntravel bans, and precautionary behavior ending shortly \nafter and economic activity normalizing. These\u00a0economies \nsee declines in consumption and investment growth \nby 2\u00a0percentage points in 2020 relative to the scenario \nwith no outbreak. The PRC is an exception, as data there \nindicate a steeper decline.\n\n\f36(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 1.2.5\u2002 PRC daily economic activity tracker and production proxies\n\nPRC activity gradually normalized in March but is not yet back to normal.\n\n2020\n2019\n2018\n\nCICC Daily Production Activity Tracker (PAT)\n\nAverage 3 weeks before the LNY = 100\n\n\u201314\n\n\u20137\n\nLNY\n\n7\n\n14\n\n21\n\n28\n\n35\n\n42\n\n49\n\n56\n\nDaily coal consumption by independent power producers\n\nLabor migration \n\nAverage 3 weeks before the LNY = 100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n26 Mar\n80.8\n\n26 Mar\n99.1\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n26 Mar\n86.2\n\n%\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n26 Mar\n100.0\n\n26 Mar\n64.9\n\n\u201314 \u20137 LNY 7\n\n14\n\n21\n\n28\n\n35\n\n42\n\n49\n\n56\n\n\u201314 \u20137 LNY 7\n\n14\n\n21\n\n28\n\n35\n\n42\n\n49\n\n56\n\nFreight logistics activity\n\nUrban transportation\n\nAverage 3 weeks before the LNY = 100\n\nAverage 3 weeks before the LNY = 100\n\n\u201314 \u20137 LNY 7\n\n14\n\n21\n\n28\n\n35\n\n42\n\n49\n\n56\n\n\u201314 \u20137 LNY 7\n\n14\n\n21\n\n28\n\n35\n\n42\n\n49\n\n56\n\nLNY = lunar new year.\nNote: The x-axis indicates days before or after the lunar new year.

Several DMCs already have more than 1,000 \nconfirmed COVID-19 cases. Some have declared a state of \nemergency and instituted containment policies such as school \nclosures, community quarantines, and stay-at-home policies \nand have shut down public transportation and nonessential \nbusinesses. These\u00a0economies will likely see substantial declines \nin\u00a0consumption and investment. In\u00a0other\u00a0DMCs, the number of \ncases remains in the hundreds or fewer, but the past 2 months \nhave shown that the situation can change quickly, and outbreaks \ncan spread rapidly. For\u00a0this\u00a0reason,\u00a0the\u00a0analysis\u00a0calculates for all \nDMCs the additional\u00a0impact of having a serious domestic outbreak. \nHere\u00a0as\u00a0well, two possibilities are considered: a\u00a0scenario\u00a0with \nshorter domestic outbreak containment and smaller demand \nshocks, and another with longer domestic outbreak containment \nand larger demand shocks. \n\n\f38(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 1.2.3\u2002Estimated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, two scenarios\n\nShorter containment, smaller demand shocks\n\nLonger containment, larger demand shocks\n\n% of GDP \n\nLosses, $ billion\n\n% of GDP \n\nLosses, $ billion\n\nWorld\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nDeveloping Asia, excluding the PRC \n\nRest of the world \n\n\u20132.3\n\n\u20134.6\n\n\u20131.0\n\n\u20132.0\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n2,013.0\n\n\u2002\u2002628.0\n\n\u2002\u2002\u200293.3\n\n1,291.6\n\n\u20134.8\n\n\u20135.1\n\n\u20132.2\n\n\u20135.1\n\n4,090.8\n\n\u2002\u2002691.6\n\n\u2002\u2002200.1\n\n3,199.1\n\nUpdated scenarios suggest global impact at $2.0 trillion\u2013\n$4.1\u00a0trillion.

In the rest of developing Asia in aggregate, the impact \nwill be 1.0%\u20132.2% of combined GDP.

Travel bans and reluctance to travel will cost \nMaldives the equivalent of 7%\u201314% of GDP (Figure 1.2.6). \n\nFigure 1.2.6\u2002Impact on individual regional economies\n\nDMCs will be affected by spillover from other countries, and they risk suffering additional losses from domestic outbreaks.\n\nBAN BHU BRU CAM FIJ HKG IND INO KAZ KYR LAO MAL MLD MON NEP PAK PHI\n\nSIN SRI\n\nTAP THA VIE\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n0.0\n\n\u20132.0\n\n\u20134.0\n\n\u20136.0\n\n\u20138.0\n\n\u201310.0\n\n\u201312.0\n\n\u201314.0\n\n\u201316.0\n\nRange of impact on DMCs\nfrom global pandemic spillover \n\nAdditional impact on DMCs\nfrom domestic outbreaks\n\nBAN = Bangladesh; BHU = Bhutan; BRU = Brunei Darussalam; CAM = Cambodia; DMC = developing member country; FIJ = Fiji; HKG = Hong Kong, China; IND\u00a0=\u00a0India; \nINO = Indonesia; KAZ = Kazakhstan; KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic; LAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; MAL = Malaysia; MLD = Maldives; MON\u00a0=\u00a0Mongolia; \nNEP\u00a0=\u00a0Nepal; PAK = Pakistan; PHI = Philippines; SIN = Singapore; SRI = Sri Lanka; TAP = Taipei,China; THA = Thailand; VIE = Viet Nam. \nNotes: Blue bars indicate the range of estimated impact from global pandemic spillover.

In many other DMCs, the impact from \nglobal spillover will be smaller. But the risk\u2014and for some \neconomies the reality\u2014is a domestic outbreak that further \ndepresses economic activity. In\u00a0these economies, the domestic \noutbreak imposes an additional impact, on top of the loss from \nspillover, equal to 2%\u20134% of GDP (Figure\u00a01.2.6). \n\nWithin economies, tourism-related sectors will be hard \n\nhit by lower global demand. Detailed results showing the \nimpact on individual economies and on sectors within them \ncan be found on the ADB website dedicated to COVID-19.4\nIn\u00a0Thailand, for\u00a0example, some 55% of spillover from the \nglobal pandemic falls on two service categories: hotels and \nrestaurants and other personal services, which could suffer \na temporary 23% employment loss under the longer scenario, \nand transport services, which could suffer a temporary 16% \nemployment loss. \n\nLimitations on this analysis may mean it underestimates \nimpact on DMCs. Channels not accounted for in this analysis \ninclude disruption to production and trade, lower commodity \nand oil prices, interrupted remittances, possible social and \nfinancial crises, and long-term effects on health care and \neducation. Each\u00a0of these channels could substantially worsen \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In less-developed \neconomies, inadequate capacity in the health system to cope or \nin the government to undertake necessary measures to contain \nthe virus or ameliorate its economic effects could mean longer \noutbreaks with more severe economic disruption. ADB analysis \nis currently under way to shed light on these issues, including \ncountry studies that account for the unique characteristics of \nits health system and institutional capacity. \n\n\f40(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nf. \n\nx = (I \u2013 A)\u20131\n\nA.

Exports \npicked up in the \ufb01rst quarter (Q1) in seasonally adjusted \nannualized terms (as assumed for all quarterly growth \nrates in this Annex unless otherwise stated). Meanwhile, \nimports fell as the effects of higher tariffs in the US trade \ncon\ufb02ict with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) started \nto kick in, the two trends generating a positive contribution \nto GDP growth from net exports (Figure A1.1). Since then, \nGDP growth slowed as global trade uncertainty caused both \ninvestment and trade to slump. With prolonged uncertainty \nin the global economy, continuing trade tensions with the \nPRC, and a strong US dollar, exports steadied but remained \nweighed down in the second half after a 5.7% fall in Q2 \n(Figure A1.2). A large drop in goods imports in Q4 meant \na substantial fall in imports for the whole year, leaving a \npositive trade balance that contributed 1.5 percentage points \nto 2.1% GDP growth in the quarter.\n\nConsumption picked up and contributed strongly to \noverall GDP growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2019 but weakened in \nQ4. This is consistent with trends in indexes for consumer \ncon\ufb01dence and retail sales, both of which, supported by steady \nwage growth throughout the year, recovered rapidly in \nQ2 and Q3 (Figure A1.3). After a strong Q1 of 2019, private \ninvestment declined as nonresidential \ufb01xed investment \ndropped in the remainder of the year. Echoing the fall in \ninvestment, the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) showed \nmostly a downward trend throughout the year (Figure A1.3). \nThe PMI managed to stay above the 50 threshold, indicating \nfuture expansion, but did so mainly on continuous expansion \noutside of manufacturing, while the manufacturing \ncomponent languished below 50 from August, indicating \ncontraction in manufacturing (Figure A1.3).\n\nData releases in early 2020 suggested that the US \n\neconomy was regaining momentum. The consumer \ncon\ufb01dence index hit 126.5 in February (2007 = 100), \nhaving increased since late 2019. This was consistent \nwith improvement in the retail sales index. Economic \ndeceleration suggested by PMI readings last year also \nreversed, with the manufacturing component bouncing \nback into expansion territory in January and February. \nThese rebounds suggested further expansion of the US \neconomy, in line with a continued strong outturn in the \nlabor market to February 2020.

In\ufb02ation is seen averaging 1.8% in 2020 \nbefore picking up to 2.1% in 2021. \n\nA spike in reported COVID-19 cases in the US since \nearly March was a game changer. Although available hard \ndata to the time of writing still indicate ongoing strength \nin economic momentum, the risk is mounting that growth \nwill be slower than expected in Q2 in the wake of pervasive \ndisruption to business. The US Federal Reserve conducted \ntwo emergency rate cuts to preempt negative economic impact \nfrom COVID-19. On 3 March, the Fed slashed the federal \nfunds rate by 50 basis points and, on 14 March, brought \nit down to the zero lower-bound, announcing as well that \nit would resume quantitative easing with the purchase of \n$500 billion in Treasury bills and $200 billion in mortgage-\nbacked securities. All these moves came on top of a national \nemergency declaration on 13 March that allows the federal \ngovernment to distribute up to $50 billion in aid to states, \ncities, and territories.\n\nMore recently, the US Federal Reserve extended the \nquantitative easing policy to buy an unlimited amount of \nbonds to suppress the cost of borrowing, and the Senate \napproved a historic $2 trillion stimulus package to deal with \nthe negative economic impact of the pandemic. With these \npolicies in place, and assuming a baseline scenario in which \nthe virus is contained relatively quickly, GDP growth in the \nUS is projected to slow to 0.4% this year before rebounding \nto 2.1% in 2021. Risks to the forecast heavily tilt to the \ndownside. If the impact of COVID-19 turns out to be much more \nsevere than anticipated, and activity stays stalled longer than \ncurrently expected, the economy may contract in 2020.\n\n%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nEuro area\nGrowth in the euro area slackened from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.2% in \n2019 (Figure A1.5).

The disappointing Q4 performance re\ufb02ected \ncontraction in the second and third largest economies in \nthe currency bloc. In France, GDP dropped by 0.2% in Q4 \nas country-wide protests slowed consumer spending and \ninventories fell. Italy\u2019s GDP declined by 1.2% in the quarter \nas policy uncertainty, sti\ufb02ed credit, muted wage growth, and \nlabor market slack dented domestic demand. In Germany, \nmeanwhile, the area\u2019s largest economy ended 2019 on a sour \nnote with scant 0.1% growth in Q4. On the upside, growth in \nSpain picked up from 1.6% in Q3 to 2.1% in Q4 on an upbeat \nexternal sector and despite disappointing domestic demand. \nEarly in the year, before the onset of COVID-19 in \nEurope, leading indicators suggested economic softness \nwould persist at least in the \ufb01rst half of 2020. After hitting \na nearly 5-year low of 100.9 in December, overall economic \nsentiment recovered to 102.6 in January and further to 103.5 \nin February, re\ufb02ecting stronger con\ufb01dence in industry and \nconstruction. However, the composite purchasing managers\u2019 \nindex failed to pick up, remaining broadly unchanged at 51.3 \nin January from 51.6 in February and still uncomfortably \nclose to the threshold at 50 that separates growth from \ndecline (Figure\u00a0A1.6). The manufacturing PMI remained \ncontractionary at 49.1 in February, but \ufb01rms\u2019 expectations \nof future output strengthened, and the ratio of orders to \ninventory surged in January to its highest in nearly 18 \nmonths, indicating that the manufacturing slump was \nbottoming out. Meanwhile, the service sector remained \nresilient albeit less positive than in 2019 at a PMI reading of \n52.6, as growth was crimped by a fall in exports.\n\nIn early March, the rapid global spread of COVID-19 \nprompted the implementation of severe mobility restrictions \nand lockdown in Italy, where the number of infections \nhas reached 53,600 as Asian Development Outlook 2020 \n(ADO\u00a02020) goes to press. By mid-March, the European \nUnion decided to close its external borders for at least 30 \ndays, and lockdown regulations were adopted in France and \nSpain, while Germany and the Netherlands also appear likely \nto tighten their currently lighter approach to containment. \nThe baseline assumptions underpinning ADO\u00a0forecasts factor in \na substantial negative shock to economic activity in the \ufb01rst half \nof 2020 in these \ufb01ve countries, which collectively contribute \nabout 80% of euro area GDP. In the absence of hard evidence \non the future evolution of the outbreak, the baseline scenario \nassumes that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will be \nlimited in other European countries. \n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\nIndex\n\n65\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n\f46\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe upshot is that growth in the euro area is forecast to \ncontract by 1.0% in 2020 as challenging domestic and external \nconditions weigh heavily on the economy. Investment is \nexpected to deteriorate signi\ufb01cantly in response to anemic \ndomestic and external demand, declining capacity utilization, \nand highly elevated uncertainty. Consumer spending is \nexpected to take a hit in the coming months from lockdown \nmeasures, worsening consumer con\ufb01dence, slow employment \ngrowth, and cooling wage in\ufb02ation. On the external front, \nexport growth is seen to be modest in line with a slowdown in \nglobal trade. \n\nAssuming a gradual weakening of domestic and external \nheadwinds and recovery in manufacturing, the currency bloc \nis poised to regain traction next year, buttressed by an ultra-\naccommodative monetary policy. Further support will likely \ncome from more expansionary \ufb01scal measures, as a widening \nstructural budget de\ufb01cit\u2014which last December the European \nCentral Bank projected rising from 1.0% in 2019 to 1.3% in 2020 \nand 1.5% in 2021\u2014is likely to be complemented by additional \ntransitory spending packages currently being formulated to \ndeal with COVID-19. Exports are projected to recover, and \ninvestment to rebound, as \ufb01rms expand production capacity, \nbuoyed by improving \ufb01nancing conditions. Growth in private \nconsumption should \ufb01nd support in low nominal bank lending \nrates and rising net worth, bene\ufb01ting as well from modest \nin\ufb02ation. Growth is thus forecast to pick up to 1.6% in 2021.\nHeadline in\ufb02ation, having climbed to 1.4% in January \n2020, edged down to 1.2% in February following a renewed \nfall in energy prices as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. \nCore in\ufb02ation, by contrast, ticked up from 1.3% in January \nto 1.4% in February (Figure A1.7). Consumer price in\ufb02ation \naveraged 1.2% in 2019, well within the European Central \nBank target of just below 2.0%. Meanwhile, in response to \neconomic disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, the \ncentral bank announced at its 12 March meeting a further \nexpansion of its asset-purchasing program and additional \nliquidity facilities. In a surprise move, the central bank \nunveiled on 18 March its Pandemic Emergency Purchase \nProgramme, endowed with \u20ac750 billion to purchase \nsecurities, both private and public. These recent actions \nfollow the central bank decision in September to loosen \npolicy for the \ufb01rst time since 2016, introducing a batch of \nnew stimulus measures: cutting the deposit rate deeper into \nnegative territory, restarting quantitative easing, and extending \nforward guidance. Policy is seen staying ultra-accommodative. \nIn keeping with the expected recession and V-shaped recovery \nto the forecast horizon, in\ufb02ation is forecast at 1.0% in 2020 and \n1.4% in 2021.\n\n%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFigure A1.7\u2002 Headline and core inflation, euro area\n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation\nCore in\ufb02ation\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Haver Analytics (accessed 14 March 2020).\n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak\u200247\n\nFigure A1.8\u2002 Demand-side contributions \nto\u00a0growth, Japan\n\nPrivate consumption\nPrivate investment\nGovernment consumption\nPublic investment\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2019\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: Economics and Social Research Institute, \nCabinet\u00a0Office, Government of Japan. http://www.esri.cao.go.jp \n(accessed\u00a09\u00a0March\u00a02020).\n\nFigure A1.9\u2002 Consumption and business \nindicators, Japan\n\nIndustrial production\nRetail sales\n\nManufacturing PMI\nConsumer con\ufb01dence\n\n% month on month\n\nIndex, >50 = better\n\n60\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nPMI = purchasing managers\u2019 index.\nNotes: A purchasing managers\u2019 index reading <50 signals \ndeterioration, >50 improvement.

Additional risks \ncould arise from worsening trade tensions with the US, the \nUS\u2013PRC trade con\ufb02ict, uncertainty surrounding a possible \ndisorderly Brexit, a slowdown in the PRC that surprised on \nthe downside, lingering weakness in manufacturing, and \nmarket concerns about debt sustainability in Italy.\n\nJapan\nWith a strong performance in the \ufb01rst half of 2019 propelled \nmainly by domestic demand, Japan accelerated economic \ngrowth from 0.3% in 2018 to 0.7%. Trade tensions and soft \nglobal demand then cooled the economy considerably in \nthe second half, with growth plunging by 7.1% in Q4 after \na sales tax hike and a destructive Typhoon Hagibis, both \nin October. Private consumption, having boosted growth \nahead of the tax increase, declined in Q4 by a sharp 10.6% \nfrom the previous quarter and dragged down GDP growth by \n6.1 percentage points. The consumption drop was more severe \nthan a 5.3% decrease after a 1997 tax hike but slightly less so \nthan a 11.4% plunge after a 2014 tax hike. Private investment \nalso dragged on growth, but net exports provided a boost if \nonly because various headwinds drove down imports more \nsharply than exports (Figure A1.8).\n\nIndustrial production weakened throughout the second \nhalf of 2019 and declined further by 2.4% in January 2020 \n(Figure A1.9). Exports continued their weakening streak \nfor 15 months, excepting a brief pickup in July last year, \nand fell by 0.6% in February 2020, mainly re\ufb02ecting low \nglobal demand for machinery and transport equipment \n(Figure A1.10). Imports fell by a sharp 13.6% in the same \nmonth, re\ufb02ecting weakness in investment. Going forward, \nproduction is likely to remain under pressure as the \nmanufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index, which improved \nmarginally around the turn of the year, deteriorated from \n48.8 in January to a 7-year low of 47.6 in February with \nthe COVID-19 outbreak disrupting supply chains and \nexports. The service sector was hard hit, possibly by a fall \nin tourism, and the purchasing managers\u2019 index for services \ntumbled from 51.0 in January to 46.7 in February, below \nthe 50 threshold indicating a contractionary trend. A slight \n2.9% rise month on month in machinery orders in January, \nfollowing on the heels of a massive 12.5% fall in December, \nsuggested that business spending was recovering, albeit \nslowly, when COVID-19 hit and derailed activity in every way. \n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\fWith production and exports weak, consumption was \n\nFigure A1.10\u2002 Trade indicators, Japan\n\nTrade balance\n\n$ billion\n\nExport growth\nImport growth\n\n%\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201316\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Haver Analytics; CEIC Data Company  \n(both accessed 18 March 2020).\n\n48\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n\u20138\n\n\u201316\n\na key growth driver in most of 2019. Then, in October, a \nnationwide sales tax hike from 8% to 10% weighed heavily \non domestic spending. Seasonally adjusted retail sales \ndived that month, as expected, but the 14.2% drop from the \nprevious month was sharper than a decline in the previous \ntax hike episode. With sales picking up in the following \n3 months amid improving consumer con\ufb01dence and low \nunemployment, the expectation was for mild economic \nrecovery in early 2020. Instead, the tax blow to consumption \nand activity was exacerbated by COVID-19. A plunge in \nthe Economy Watcher\u2019s Survey indicates bleak sentiment \nabout household activity, production, and employment. With \n30% of international tourists coming from the PRC in 2019, \nsudden strong travel restrictions hammered Japan\u2019s booming \ntourism industry in Q1 of 2020, which will aggravate the \ndomestic consumption slump.\n\nHeadline in\ufb02ation accelerated to 0.8% year on year in \nDecember 2019, likely driven in part by the sales tax hike, \nbefore falling to 0.6% in January 2020. Core in\ufb02ation, which \nexcludes fresh food and fuel, also fell, from 0.6% to 0.4%. \nAt\u00a0its most recent meeting, the Bank of Japan kept monetary \npolicy unchanged, including a short-term interest rate of \u20130.1%, \npurchases of Japanese government bonds to keep 10-year yields \nnear zero, and forward guidance that it will lower interest \nrates further if prospects worsen for meeting the price stability \ntarget. Further, measures to inject additional liquidity and ease \n\ufb01nancial conditions have been initiated.\n\nA positive start to 2020 emerged from accommodative \n\npolicies to buffer the tax hike, and an anticipated post-\nOlympics dip in public works as well as receding trade \nuncertainty. But\u00a0the virus outbreak has crimped economic \nactivity as businesses deal with disrupted supply chains \non one hand and weaker demand from anxious consumers \non the other. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 and the \nseverity of the downturn in the PRC will weigh heavily on \nJapan\u2019s external sector, on top of domestic consumption \nconstrained by outbreak containment measures, the tax \nburden, and tepid wage recovery. The postponement of the \n2020 Summer Olympics serves as an additional blow to \nlocal businesses. The\u00a0GDP forecast for 2020 is thus revised \ndown to contraction by 1.5%.  A major downside risk to the \nforecast would be a prolonged worldwide spread of COVID-19, \ndampening global demand. Once the outbreak is contained, \nadditional government stimulus and liquidity easing from the \nBank\u00a0of\u00a0Japan will support recovery. Growth is expected to \npick up in the second half of 2020 and forecast at 0.9% in 2021. \nIn\ufb02ation is projected to average 0.7% in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak\u200249\n\nFigure A1.11\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto\u00a0growth, Australia\n\nConsumption\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\nChange in inventories\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points, seasonally adjusted annualized rate\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n2019\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 11 March 2020).\n\nRecent developments and  \noutlook in nearby economies\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\nAustralia\nAs weakening investment offset improved consumption, \nGDP growth slipped from 2.2% in Q3 to 2.1% in Q4. \nConsumption, mostly household, added 1.5 percentage points \nto growth, net exports 0.4 points, and change in inventories \n0.7 points.

Unemployment fell marginally from 5.3% in \nJanuary to 5.1% in February. In\ufb02ation ticked up from 1.7% in \nQ3 of 2019 to 1.8% in Q4, still below the target of 2.0%\u20133.0% \nset by Reserve Bank of Australia, the central bank. \n\nOn 18 March 2020, the central bank announced a \ncomprehensive support package that cuts the cash rate to \n0.25%, keeps the 3-year government bond yield at 0.25% \nthrough bond acquisition, establishes a 3-year funding facility \nfor authorized deposit-taking institutions at a \ufb01xed rate of \n0.25%, and newly remunerates exchange settlement balances at \nthe central bank at 10 basis points. The government announced \nan A$17.6 billion stimulus package targeting jobs and small \nand medium-sized businesses, and a complementary program \nto support A$15 billion in lending to consumers and smaller \nbusinesses.\n\nCOVID-19 is expected to depress GDP growth in Q1 with \ndeclines in trade, tourism, and students from the PRC. If the \noutbreak intensi\ufb01es in Australia, domestic demand will likely \ntake a signi\ufb01cant hit. \n\nThe growth forecast is revised down, \ufb01rst considering \nbush\ufb01res that lasted until January 2020, and now COVID-19. \nGrowth will enjoy support, however, from accommodative \nmonetary policy.

The \nlabor market remained robust as the seasonally adjusted \nunemployment rate improved from 4.1% in Q3 to 4.0% in Q4. \n\nUnder COVID-19, domestic production will be \n\nconstricted by international and domestic plans to limit the \nspread of the virus and their severe effects on travel and trade, \naffecting both supply and demand. \n\nWhile citing several areas of strength in the New Zealand \n\neconomy, the Monetary Policy Committee agreed to cut the \ncash rate to 0.25% from 17 March 2020 to at least 12 months \nlater. It noted that an asset purchase program of government \nbonds was on the table if needed.\n\nTo halt the spread of COVID-19, a nationwide lockdown \nfrom 25 March suspended schools and nonessential services \nfor at least 4 weeks. To mitigate its economic impact, the \ngovernment announced a NZ$12.1 billion stimulus package \nthat includes wage subsidies, additional welfare payments, and \nbusiness tax breaks.

On 20 March 2020, the central bank decided to keep \nits policy rate at 6% in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a sharp \ndecline in oil prices, and the resulting constraint on in\ufb02ation. \nCOVID-19 and its consequences will slow growth in the \ncoming quarters. The economy will bene\ufb01t from a government \nresponse package and central bank measures. In January, the \nPresident announced a spending package worth the equivalent \nof 0.3%\u20130.5% of GDP to support lower-income families with \nchildren. Such social measures and the implementation of \nnational projects as scheduled should boost domestic demand. \nFurther, a $4 billion crisis fund unveiled on 16 March includes \ntax breaks for airlines and other \ufb01rms in the tourism industry. \nPreferential loans for businesses will be expanded.\n\nRisks to the outlook would be unanticipated severity in the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, delays in carrying out government projects, \ncommodity price volatility, and continuing global trade tensions. \nOn 23 March 2020, the Consensus Forecast was for GDP to \ncontract by 0.3% in 2020 and grow by 2.0% in 2021. \n\nCommodity prices\n\nOil price movements and prospects\nBrent crude \ufb01nished 2019 at $66.42/barrel, up by $13.25/\nbarrel from the end of 2018 on the expectation of better global \nconditions and deeper supply cuts by oil producers in 2020 \n(Figure A1.14). On 6 December 2019, member countries of the \nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \nand several allied oil producers agreed to rein in supply by an \nadditional 500,000 barrels/day beyond what they had agreed \nin December 2018. On top of this, Saudi Arabia volunteered to \nreduce production further by 400,000 barrels/day, bringing \nold and new output cuts to more than 2 million barrels/day \n(mbd), or 2% of global oil demand. Following this new deal, \noil prices averaged $66.74/barrel in the remaining days of \nDecember before escalated tension between the US and Iran \nfurther pushed prices above $70 in January. \n\nFigure A1.14\u2002 Brent crude spot prices\n\nSpot\nAnnual average\n\n52.71,\n8 Oct 2015\n\n26.39,\n26 Jan 2016\n\n$/barrel\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n86.09,\n3 Oct 2018\n\n69.02,\n6 Jan 2020\n\n49.73,\n24 Dec 2018\n\n24.56,\n18 Mar 2020\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Bloomberg (accessed 21\u00a0March\u00a02020).\n\n\f52\u2002\u2002Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nHowever, oil prices reversed course as concerns intensi\ufb01ed \n\nabout the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Brent \ncrude slid into bear-market territory on 3 February, its price \nfalling by 23% from its January peak. It then hovered within the \nnarrow range of $50\u2013$59/barrel for a month before breaking \nbelow the $50\u00a0mark on 5 March, the day OPEC and its allies met \nto discuss oil production cuts. After the group failed to reach a \nconsensus, and the resultant decision by Saudi Arabia to slash \nits export prices for crude and boost oil production, the Brent \ncrude oil price dropped by as much as 31% to close on 9 March \nat $32.34/barrel. Then, as countries implement more restrictive \ncontainment measures, further curtailing global oil demand, prices \ndropped below $25/barrel on 18 March, the lowest in 17 years. \nThe\u00a0Brent\u00a0crude average in the year to the third week of March \nwas $53.69/barrel.\n\nThe International Energy Agency report Oil 2020 forecasts \noil supply remaining comfortable to 2025. Oil supply from outside \nOPEC is forecast to increase by 2.1 mbd in 2020 but only 1.3 mbd in \n2021, the slowdown mainly from US production lacking incentive \nwhen oil prices are low. In its March report, the US Energy \nInformation Administration forecast US crude oil production \naveraging 13.0 mbd in 2020 and then falling to 12.7 mbd in 2021, \nthe \ufb01rst such annual decline US crude oil production since 2016.\n\nThe global economic slowdown now expected from COVID-19 \n\nwill weigh on petroleum demand. The International Energy \nAgency forecasts global oil demand falling sharply from estimated \n1.0 mbd growth in 2019 to a decline of 90,000 barrels/day in \n2020\u2014the \ufb01rst contraction since 2009. However, as government \npolicies continue to evolve, many analysts hesitate to predict \nhow much global oil consumption will fall, made cautious by \nextreme uncertainty about how long it will be before COVID-19 \nis contained and the extent of its economic impact. Demand \nconcerns and greater oversupply prospects are overpowering any \nremaining upward pressure on oil prices from agreed supply cuts, \nrenewed supply disruption in Libya, geopolitical tensions in the \nMiddle East, and the global implementation by the International \nMaritime Organization on 1\u00a0January 2020 of a 0.50% sulfur cap \nfor marine fuel. \n\nEvidence suggest that demand shocks are more persistent \nand have larger impacts on oil price movements than do supply \nshocks.  As much as geopolitically induced supply shocks may \nappear to signi\ufb01cantly move prices, historically they have failed \nto produce large and lasting price increases, especially in periods \nof weak demand and abundant spare capacity. Such shocks tend \nto be resolved in the short run by increased production elsewhere \nas higher prices induce the release of spare capacity. Barring \nfurther large and sharp changes in global oil supply and demand, \nBrent\u00a0crude prices are forecast to average $35/barrel in 2020 \nand rise to $55/barrel in 2021 as global demand improves and oil \ninventories diminish.\n\n\fAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak\u200253\n\nFigure A1.15\u2002 Food commodity price indexes\n\nFood\nEdible oil\nGrain\nOther food\n\n% change, year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: World Bank.

Prices for edible \noil retreated as harvests exceeded expectations for soybeans \nin the US and South America and palm oil in Indonesia and \nMalaysia, demand for soybeans fell in the PRC, and African \nswine fever cut demand for animal feed. Poultry prices \neased with increased production spurred mainly a decline \nin the \u201cother food\u201d price index. The grain price index, on \nthe other hand, showed an uptrend in 2019 as weather \ndisturbances, notably in Australia, the Russian Federation, \nand Ukraine, supported wheat prices and robust trade \npushed up maize prices.\n\nThe increase in food prices has continued in 2020, \nwith the index up by 5.7% in the \ufb01rst 2 months of the year. \nUpward pressure on global food prices has come from \nproduction difficulties, disrupted global supply chains, and \nhigh international demand for commodities like rice, sugar, \nand meat. These trends have been tempered, however, by \nfears of a slowdown in global demand following the outbreak \nof\u00a0COVID-19.\n\nThe increase in food prices will continue this year, albeit \nat a slower rate. The March 2020 report of the US Department \nof Agriculture estimated global grain production in the crop \nyear 2019/2020 increasing by 1.5% to reach 2,667 million tons. \nGlobal supply of the three main grains\u2014wheat, maize, and \nrice\u2014is projected to increase by 0.8% this cropping season. \nSimilarly, global supply of the 17 major edible oils is estimated \nto increase by 1.7%. This favorable production outlook \ufb01nds \nsupport from forecasts of neutral weather in the \ufb01rst half of \n2020 and low input prices because of softer oil prices. However, \nconsumption is expected to outpace production, leaving ratios \nof stock to use lower than in previous cropping seasons. The \nforecast lower ratios are comfortable but nevertheless create \nupward pressure on prices, especially as disrupted global \nsupply chains further tighten supply. On balance, the food \ncommodity price index is forecast to rise slightly by 2.0% in \nboth years to the forecast horizon. \n\nAmong several risks to these forecasts are severe worsening \n\nof the COVID-19 outbreak, trade friction, changes to domestic \nsupport policies, further depreciation of commodity exporter \ncurrencies, the ever-present potential for oil price volatility, \nand adverse weather.\n\n\f\f2\n\nWHAT DRIVES \nINNOVATION IN ASIA?\n\n\f\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?\n\nInnovation is critical to growth and development. While some \neconomies in developing Asia are near the forefront of innovation, \nmany others lag behind. This theme chapter outlines what \npolicy\u00a0makers can do to foster greater innovation.\n\nIt identifies five key drivers of innovation. The first is education, \n\nwhich is hardly surprising since innovation is an intrinsically \nhuman enterprise. In a number of Asian economies, too many \nchildren lack even the most basic literacy and numeracy skills. \nPolicy makers must therefore focus first on strengthening basic \nskills, but they must also shift to more learner-centered teaching \npractices and to broadening and diversifying the skills\u00a0mix.\n\nThe second driver is entrepreneurship. While people tend to link \n\nentrepreneurship with innovation, fewer than 1% of entrepreneurs \ncreate more than half of job growth and innovation. It is therefore \ncrucially important to design policy that facilitates the potential of \nthese productive entrepreneurial firms and thereby better harness \nthem for economic development.\n\nThe final three drivers of innovation are high-quality \n\ninstitutions, robust financial systems, and big cities. High-quality \ninstitutions, including the rule of law and strong property rights, \ngive innovative entrepreneurs the confidence they need to take \nrisks and experiment with new ideas. The evolution of intellectual \nproperty rights in the Republic of Korea suggests that different \ninstitutions and kinds of protection may matter more at different \nstages of development.\n\nA sound and efficient financial system can channel resources \nto innovators. Indeed, analysis suggests that the development of \nfinancial markets, for both equity and debt, has a positive effect \non patents. Finally,\u00a0cities can be powerful forces for promoting \ninnovative activity because they facilitate knowledge spillover \nand\u00a0dissemination. Innovation policy thus requires a nuanced, \nbottom\u2013up approach geared toward enabling local innovators.\n\nIn the end, there are no shortcuts to creating an innovative \nsociety. The journey requires long-term commitment and a lot of \nhard work.\n\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park, Elisabetta Gentile, Abdul\u00a0Abiad, \nLiming Chen, Sameer Khatiwada, Rhea Molato-Gayares, Kirsty Newman, \nMadhavi Pundit, Irfan\u00a0Qureshi, and Shu Tian.\n\n\f58(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInnovating for inclusive \nand\u00a0sustainable growth\n\nInnovations, including social innovations such as work-from-home \narrangements, can help Asian countries better cope with the \nlarge economic repercussions of COVID-19. Despite\u00a0a\u00a0universal \nconsensus that innovation is vital to long-term economic, \nsocial, and technological progress, the term is hard to define. \nInnovation\u00a0exists along a continuum that stretches from \nincremental innovations that improve existing products or \nprocesses in small but material ways to, at the other extreme, \nradical innovation that spawns the rare inventions that destroy or \nsupplant existing business models. It is not always easy to identify \nan innovation. The mapping of the human genome, for example, \nwas hailed at the time as a radical innovation to provide new \ntreatments for diseases, but it turned out to be only an incremental \nstep in that direction. Using something already known\u2014but in a \ndifferent way or at a different time or place\u2014is also an innovation. \nFinally, innovation encompasses a wide range of activities \ncarried out by a wide variety of actors: firms, governments, \nnongovernment organizations, and individuals.\n\nBecause innovation is a complex, diverse, and multifaceted \n\nconcept, it comes as no surprise that measuring it is also \ncomplicated. Survey respondents in different countries may have \ndiverse understanding of innovation, with firms in developing \ncountries perhaps considering a minor design change as a new or \nsignificantly improved product, though the same change would \ngo all but unnoticed in more advanced economies (Cirera and \nMaloney 2017).\n\nWhat is innovation?\nThe Oslo Manual 2018 defines innovation as a \u201cnew or improved \nproduct or business process (or combination thereof) that differs \nsignificantly from the firm\u2019s previous products or business \nprocesses and that has been introduced on the market or brought \ninto use by the firm.\u201d1 This is a measurable definition that forms a \nsolid basis for analysis at the level of the individual\u00a0firm.\n\nWhile a rich typology has been developed over the years \nto reflect the multifaceted nature of innovation, this chapter \nfocuses on four key concepts that are particularly relevant \nto the Asian\u00a0experience. First is the distinction between \nproduct and process innovation, which stems directly from the \ndefinition provided in the Oslo Manual 2018. Product innovation \nrefers to an improvement in the performance of a product \nor new features in a product, often visible to the customers. \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)59\n\nProcess\u00a0innovation\u00a0refers\u00a0to\u00a0an improvement in how the \nproduct is produced, which can include changes all along the \nvalue chain but is often invisible to customers.\n\nThe distinction between frontier and catch-up innovation \n\nis particularly important in developing economies. Frontier \ninnovation is defined as the first application of a specific \ninnovation in the world. It can be either radical or incremental \n(but, as mentioned above, most innovation is incremental). \nFigure\u00a02.1.1 shows that, when advanced countries push \nthe frontier of innovation, they improve global technology. \nCatch-up innovation, on the other hand, is the first application \nin a specific context, perhaps a particular country or firm, \nof an innovation that already exists elsewhere in the world. \nCatch-up innovations are crucial to improving productivity in \ndeveloping countries.\n\nFigure 2.1.1\u2002 Catch-up versus frontier innovation\n\nL, labor\n\nGlobal technology frontier\n\nB\n\nA\n\nFrontier innovations by\ntechnologically advanced\ncountries improve global\ntechnology  \n\nD\n\nC\n\nCatch-up innovations allow\ndeveloping countries to move\ntoward the global technology frontier\n\nSource: Authors.\n\nK, capital\n\nAlthough they differ slightly in their definitions, frugal \ninnovation, inclusive innovation, and bottom-of-the-pyramid \ninnovation all refer to solutions that address the needs of \nlow-income populations. They can be high-tech, such as digital \nplatforms that bring services to underserved communities, \nor low-tech, such as a terracotta clay refrigerator that keeps \nperishable food cool without electricity. They can emerge \nfrom the efforts of firms, governments, nongovernment \norganizations, or individuals.\n\n\f60(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFinally, sustainable innovation integrates consideration of \nhow environmentally, socially, and financially appropriate an \ninnovation is, from idea generation to R&D and all the way to \ncommercialization. Environmentally sustainable innovation \nincludes techniques to reduce waste, use recycled inputs and \nalternative energy sources, and reduce, reuse, and sequester \nthe greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Jeepneys and tuk-tuks\npowered by electricity or liquefied petroleum gas that promote \na cleaner environment and improve the quality of life for the \npoor are examples of innovations that are both sustainable and \ninclusive.\n\nInnovation in Asia: past and present\nDeveloping Asia has a rich tradition of innovation. In fact, \nmankind can thank the region for many innovations that have \nprofoundly affected the course of world history. The four\u00a0great \ninventions of ancient Chinese civilization\u2014papermaking, \nprinting, gunpowder, and the compass\u2014are well-known \nexamples. Another case in point is the mathematical concept of \nzero, which originated in the Indian subcontinent. Asia\u00a0began \nto fall behind the West in the 15th century, however, and the \ngap widened further with Europe\u2019s industrial revolution. \nAs\u00a0a\u00a0result, Asia needed to catch up technologically.\n\nOver the past 50 years, rapid and sustained growth, \ndevelopment, and technological progress have moved Asia \nand the Pacific much closer to the global technology frontier. \nThe region is no longer just an importer of advanced foreign \ninnovations but has increasingly become a globally significant \ninnovator. In line with its rising share of global income, the role \nof developing Asia in global innovation is clearly on the rise. \nWhile there are substantial differences across subregions and \ncountries, the region as a whole is investing more in innovative \nactivity and producing more innovative output.\n\nOne indication is that Asia\u2019s share of research and \ndevelopment (R&D) investment rose from 22% in 1996 to \n40% in 2017, according to the Global Innovation Index (2019). \nThe\u00a0shifting geography of innovation is evident in the swift rise \nof several Asian economies among the 129 economies chosen \nfor comparison and listed in the Index. In 2019, the Republic\u00a0of \nKorea (ROK) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) edged \ncloser toward inclusion in the world\u2019s top 10 innovators, \nperforming especially well in the categories patents by origin, \nindustrial designs, trademarks by origin, high-tech net exports, \nand creative goods exports. Other strong regional performers \nwere India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, \nin addition to the more advanced economies of Singapore and \nHong Kong, China.\n\nThe 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index\u2014which ranks the \n\nworld\u2019s most innovative 95 countries based on R&D spending, \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)61\n\nmanufacturing capability, and concentration of high-tech \npublic companies\u2014ranks the ROK at 2, Singapore at 3, Japan at \n12, and the PRC at 15. In the Nature Index 2019, which tracks \narticles published in 82 high-quality journals in the natural \nsciences, the PRC ranked second, after the US. The PRC holds \na similar position in Clarivate\u2019s 2019 Annual G20 Scorecard \nfor the most highly cited researchers. Interestingly, the report \nfound that, while Australia leads the pack in terms of research \noutput, Indonesia achieved a threefold increase in a decade.\n\nInnovation and economic growth and \ndevelopment: theory and evidence\nInnovation can improve productivity by extracting greater \noutput from the same inputs, thereby generating more goods \nand services and higher wages, profitability, and economic \ngrowth. Early studies that built on the seminal work of \nSolow\u00a0(1956) concluded that long-run growth comes mainly \nfrom technical change, which can be continually renewed, \nrather than from labor and capital, which suffer decreasing \nmarginal productivity.2\n\nTwo defining characteristics of technology are that its use \n\nby one firm or person in no way limits its use by another, yet \nit can be made exclusive by preventing access to those who \nhave not paid for it. This provides private firms with a strong \nincentive to innovate. These two features of new ideas generate \nhigher returns as the scale of production increases, and this is \nwhat sustains growth in the long run (Romer 1990).\n\nTo understand the nature of technical change and how \n\nit evolves over time, growth accounting exercises were \naugmented with an innovation component that found \nstrong links between R&D capital, for example, and growth \n(Griliches\u00a01980a, Mansfield 1980).\n\nThe frontier in economic thinking was further pushed by \nendogenous growth models that included other representations \nof innovation such as R&D investment by private firms, \nlearning by doing, human capital and knowledge accumulation, \nand public infrastructure (Romer 1986 and 1990, Lucas 1988, \nAghion and Howitt 1992, Barro 1990, Grossman and Helpman \n1994). These models suggest that innovation within an entity \nand positive spillover to the rest of the economy can drive \nsustainable, long-term economic growth, and that these factors \nare generated by economic incentives within the system. \nA\u00a0branch of the literature focused on the interaction between \ncompetition and innovation, as well as the critical role played \nby private firms, which have implications for a country\u2019s \nindustrial and technology policy (Aghion et al. 2005, Aghion, \nCarlin, and Schaffer 2002). The prescriptions and debates \nthat ensued from these models accommodated the observed \n\n\f62(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\ngrowth trajectories of Japan, Germany, and the US starting in \nthe 1950s and, subsequently in the 1980s, of Hong Kong, China; \nthe Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. They have \nbecome relevant more recently to the PRC. The\u00a0general pattern \nof innovation in Asian economies is an initial phase of catch-up \ninnovation with the adoption of technology to generate \nprogress and growth, followed by a later phase of growth \ndriven by their own innovation (ADB 2020).\n\nHowever, inquiry found conventional assumptions and \ntheories far removed from the experiences of other developing \neconomies grappling with social and environmental problems \nand serious scarcity of resources. This called for a different \nalignment of innovation models driven by the needs of \nlow-income and price-sensitive consumers in developing \neconomies, and a strong discourse for inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. The consensus was that, if innovation is \nhighly capital- and energy-intensive and requires superior \ninfrastructure and other networks, skilled labor, abundant \ncredit, and demand for complex products, the world\u2019s poor \nhave little hope of benefiting from innovation and its impact on \ngrowth (Chataway, Hanlin, and Kaplinsky 2014). Given massive \ndisparity in the needs and capabilities of different economies, \neven within a single region like Asia, one-size-fits-all policy \nprescriptions appear to be sorely inadequate.\n\nAs a result, links between innovation, capacity creation, and \n\ndevelopment emerged as a critical concern for policy\u00a0makers. \nSo too did complementarity in the innovation process between \nmarkets and players outside of them, such as the public sector \nand nongovernment organizations. Turning away from a focus \non technological advance as the basis of growth, research \nexplored alternate trajectories in the literature of economics \nand other fields. The existence of alternate trajectories \ncontested long-established models and upended the belief \nthat only advanced countries innovate. These\u00a0trajectories \nfeature instead strategies crafted to incorporate the \nstrengths of developing countries toward answering their \nneeds. Alternate\u00a0strategies innovate in accordance with \nindustry dynamics unique to economies with abundant \nnatural resources (Andersen, Mar\u00ecn, and Simensen 2018), \ngrassroot community action for solutions that are inclusive \nand sensitive to context (Seyfang and Smith 2007), or efforts \nto build capacity for technology adaptation, development, \nand implementation, often through incremental and frugal \ninnovations (Katz and Shapiro 1987, Wooldridge\u00a02010). \nThe\u00a0incremental and frugal innovations deployed in the near \nterm may be augmented over the longer term by institutional \nadjustments, targeted public investments, and education \n(ADB\u00a02014, Calestous and Lee 2005).\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)63\n\nWhy does innovation matter \nfor\u00a0developing\u00a0Asia?\nThe preceding discussion makes evident several clear theoretical \nand empirical links between innovation and economic \ndevelopment. At the same time, it has shown how developing Asia \nhas revived as the center of global innovation. Why then does \ninnovation matter so much for developing Asia right now?\nFirst, rapid and sustained growth has transformed \ndeveloping Asia into a region that is overwhelmingly middle \nincome, at which stage innovation assumes a larger role in \neconomic growth. Second, innovation can help improve the \nquality of growth and of life in the region by making growth \nmore inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The following \nsummarizes the importance of innovation to Asia at this stage \nin its development and the specific ways that innovation can \nsupport development in the region.\n\nInnovation plays a larger role in growth as economies reach \n\nmiddle income. Rapid and sustained growth transformed \ndeveloping Asia from a largely low-income region in 1991 \nto one overwhelmingly middle income by 2015 (ADB 2017). \nWhile\u00a0labor and capital are still necessary for growth in \nmiddle-income economies, growth in total factor productivity \nbecomes\u00a0more important to economic success. Figure\u00a02.1.2\u00a0shows \nthat growth in Asia has relied increasingly on total factor \nproductivity as it has become increasingly middle income. \nAnd\u00a0innovation\u00a0is a\u00a0vital\u00a0ingredient of productivity growth. \n\nFigure 2.1.2\u2002 Contribution to growth by factor of production in Asia, % of total\n\nCapital input\nLabor input\nHuman capital\nTFP\n\n15.0\n\n31.2\n\n60.4\n\n\u20136.6\n\n21.9\n\n12.3\n\n17.7\n\n48.2\n\n40.8\n\n9.2\n8.1\n\n41.8\n\n1970\u20131985\n\n1995\u20132005\n\n2010\u20132017\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, TFP = total factor productivity. \nNotes: Central Asia is excluded in 1970\u20131985. The 21 economies in the \ufb01rst period are Bangladesh; \nBrunei Darussalam; Cambodia; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Myanmar; Nepal; Pakistan; the People\u2019s Republic of China; \nthe Philippines; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet\u00a0Nam. \nAdded in the latter two periods are Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. In 2017, \nthese 25\u00a0economies accounted for 99% of the combined GDP of Asian\u00a0Development Bank developing \nmember economies plus Japan. \nSource: ADB 2020.\n\n\f64(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nMiddle-income\u00a0economies that graduate to high income have \nR&D establishments three times bigger than economies mired \nin the middle-income trap, for example, and they file four \ntimes more patent applications (ADB 2017). The way forward \nfor developing Asia is directed by the experience of Asian \nnewly industrialized economies (NIEs) such as the ROK, which \nleveraged innovation to transition to high income after only \n23\u00a0years in the middle-income category.\n\nInnovation can make growth inclusive and environmentally \n\nsustainable. Recognition is growing in developing Asia that \neconomic growth that manages to benefit only a small elite \nwhile degrading the environment cannot be sustained in the \nlong run. Innovation can make growth more broadly based \nand able to improve the quality of life and extend productive \nopportunities to the disadvantaged. As discussed above, \nwhile innovation tends to be associated with state-of-the-art \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence or robotics, plenty \nof inexpensive, bottom-of-the-pyramid innovations are \nable to help the poor tackle the everyday challenges of life. \nFurther, innovation to improve energy, transport, and other \ninfrastructure can contribute to a cleaner environment.\n\nImportant at all stages of development, innovation will \nvary by stage. The potential gains from innovation are large \nin terms of supplying jobs and boosting productivity, incomes, \nand economic growth. Developing Asia as a region will reap \nlarge economic benefits from innovation. But a country\u2019s stage \nof economic and technological development determines the \nnature and scope of innovation available to it. Lower-income \nAsian countries that fall far short of the global technology \nfrontier can best accelerate their development by tapping \nexisting knowledge and know-how and adapting them to local \nneeds (Figure 2.1.1). To enable themselves to do so effectively, \nthey must nurture their technology absorption capacity to \nensure its adequacy. Upper-middle-income Asian countries, \non the other hand, need to invest much more in frontier-\npushing innovation because adopting existing technology and \nknow-how offers them only diminishing returns, and they are \nable to push against the global technology frontier because \nthey are closer to it\u2014as illustrated by explosive growth in R&D \ninvestment in the PRC in recent years. Whether innovations \npush the frontier or are far from it, they serve as engines of \ntechnological, economic, and social progress.\n\nNew tech and value chains leapfrog to the global \n\ntechnology frontier. While the scope and nature of innovation \ndepends on a country\u2019s stage of development, new technologies, \nparticularly information and communication technology (ICT), \ncan accelerate the catch-up process in lower-income countries. \nDeveloping Asia is a global leader in the production and \nconsumption of ICT, which has permeated every facet of life \nin the region and supported many innovations large and small, \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)65\n\nas it will continue to do. One notable example is how quickly \nthe PRC is becoming a cashless society where you can use your \nmobile phone for every transaction, even giving alms to street \nbeggars. Asia can foster innovation by leveraging its openness \nto trade and active participation in global value chains, which \ncan be powerful channels for knowledge transfer to developing \ncountries, accelerating their catch-up and advance to the global \ntechnology frontier.\n\nInnovation is key to a better quality of life and more \ndynamic societies. While innovations make Asian firms more \nproductive, they also enhance the well-being of Asian people. \nThe advent of ICT is a powerful case in point. The internet and \nmobile phones have dramatically reduced communication costs \nfor producers and consumers alike. An innovative economy \nis often the bounty of an innovative society that encourages \nthe free and open exchange of ideas and knowledge. Further, \ninnovations and technological progress can contribute to more \ndynamic and vibrant Asian societies, in which Asians are \nconstantly asking new questions and seeking new solutions.\n\n\f66(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nLandscape of innovation\u00a0in\u00a0Asia\n\nThis section examines in more detail the current landscape \nof innovation in Asia. It begins by looking at how aggregate \ninnovation in the region stacks up against other parts of \nthe world. Data at the level of the individual firm permits \na deeper inquiry into the nature of innovation within the \nregion. For example, do firm size and export orientation \naffect the propensity to innovate among Asian firms? \nRegression\u00a0analysis\u00a0empirically reveals the determinants of \ninnovation in developing Asia. What is the effect on innovation \nin the region of human capital, for instance, or of research and \ndevelopment (R&D) and other variables? \n\nThe current state of innovation in Asia: \nan\u00a0aggregate perspective\nIn the past, developing Asia adopted innovations and superior \ntechnologies from advanced economies in Japan, the US, and \nWestern Europe to power its industrialization and economic \ngrowth. The exact mechanism through which Asian economies \nimported foreign innovations differed from country to \ncountry. Singapore leveraged foreign direct investment by \nlarge multinational corporations, for example, while the ROK \ncapitalized on domestic firms\u2019 licensing of foreign technology. \nAlthough the mechanism varied, the region imported and \nadapted more advanced foreign technology for its own needs. \nIt\u00a0remained far from the global technology frontier, and many \nof its innovations were incremental innovations. However, \ndespite relative lack of indigenous innovation, the NIEs, \nthe\u00a0PRC, and other economies were able to effectively absorb \nand use foreign innovations, and this contributed to their rapid \nand sustained growth.\n\nAfter a country reaches a certain stage of economic and \n\ntechnological development, it begins to invest in frontier \ninnovation. The experience of the NIEs fits this established \npattern of steady graduation from catch-up innovation to \nfrontier innovation. The ROK, for example, has become one \nof the most innovative economies in the world, and other \nAsian\u00a0economies, most notably the PRC, are following the path \nblazed by the ROK and other Asian NIEs. More broadly, rapid \nand sustained growth has transformed developing Asia into an \noverwhelmingly middle-income region that has achieved a lot \nof technological progress. It is therefore outdated to credit the \nstereotype of developing Asia as a region that innovates little \non its own.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)67\n\nFigure 2.2.1\u2002R&D expenditure as a share of GDP by region, 2016\n\n% of GDP\n\n3.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\nDeveloping Asia World, excluding\ndeveloping Asia\n\nWorld\n\nLatin America\nand the Caribbean\n\nOECD\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, R&D = research and development.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the World Development Indicators database.\n\nIn fact, the data indicate that developing Asia is no \nlonger at the periphery of the global innovation landscape \nbut rapidly moving toward its center. It is informative to \ncompare the region\u2019s performance with that of Latin\u00a0America, \nanother largely middle-income region that is broadly \ncomparable to developing Asia in its stage of development. \nFigure\u00a02.2.1\u00a0offers\u00a0a snapshot of innovative activity, proxied \nby R&D, in\u00a0developing\u00a0Asia, Latin America, and advanced \neconomies of the OECD in 2016. Developing Asia invests \nsubstantially more in innovation than does Latin America. \nIt still\u00a0innovates less than advanced economies, but the gap \nis small and narrowing. While developing Asia as a whole \nhas become a major player in global innovation, substantial \ndifferences exist within the region, which divides it into two \ngroups: the leading group of NIEs and the PRC, which invest \na lot in innovation, and the rest of the region, which invests \nless (Figure\u00a02.2.2).\n\nAccording to R&D data, developing Asia is no longer \n\na laggard in innovation but has become one of the \nglobal hubs of innovative activity. Further, trends for \ninnovation indicators suggest that the region has become \ntangibly more innovative in recent years (Figure 2.2.3). \nThe\u00a0magnitude of regional innovation is sizable and growing \nrapidly. The region\u2019s transformation from an innovation \nlaggard into a major innovation player is consistent \nwith its emergence as one of the three centers of gravity \nin the world economy, along with North\u00a0America and \nWestern\u00a0Europe. Technological progress has contributed to \nthe industrialization and development of many economies, \nmost notably the NIEs and the PRC, and has elevated their \ntechnological capacity to levels that enable indigenous \ninnovation that pushes the global technology frontier. \n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nJapan\n\nGermany\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPRC\n\nBrazil\n\nIndia\n\nArgentina\n\nMexico\n\nChile\n\nIndonesia\n\nFigure 2.2.2\u2002 R&D expenditure as a share of GDP \n\nin selected economies, 2016\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n% of GDP\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, \nR&D = research and development.\nNote: Data for India is for 2015.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the World Development \nIndicators database.\n\n\f68(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 2.2.3\u2002 R&D expenditure as a share of GDP, 1996\u20132017\n\nNIEs\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nOther developing Asia\nOECD\n\n% of GDP\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1996\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, NIEs = newly industrialized economies, OECD = Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, R&D = research and development.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the World Development Indicators database.\n\nLike R&D, other major indicators of innovation point to a \ngrowing footprint of developing Asia on the global innovation \nlandscape. Figure 2.2.4 shows one major input indicator for \nfrontier innovation (R&D workforce) and two major output \nindicators (patent applications by residents and scientific \npublications) for three distinct groups of economies in \ndeveloping Asia, with the wealthy Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development (OECD) as a comparator. \nThe\u00a0first column presents the indicators in absolute terms and \ndocuments the rise of the PRC as a player in global innovation. \nIn the second column, the same indicators are weighted \nby population and show that Asia\u2019s newly industrialized \neconomies (NIEs) are innovation powerhouses that outperform \nthe OECD when population size is taken into account. \nThe\u00a0figure also documents substantial disparity across the \nregion, with the rest of developing\u00a0Asia performing far below \nthe advanced economies in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nFigure 2.2.5 presents productive capability in the same \nthree groups of Asian economies and the OECD. In terms \nof economic complexity, the NIEs have outperformed the \nOECD since 2008, and the PRC is gradually catching up to it. \nWhile\u00a0the PRC and the NIEs have long been major exporters \nof high-tech manufactures, outperforming the OECD, now the \nrest of developing Asia is catching up. Asia\u2019s participation in \nglobal production networks is undoubtedly one of the factors \nthat explain this performance.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)69\n\nFigure 2.2.4\u2002Innovation gaps as measured by other indicators\n\nRest of developing Asia\nNIEs\nOECD\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nR&D researchers\n\nR&D researchers per million population\n\n1996\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\n1996\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\n2005\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\nPatent applications by residents\n\nPatent applications by residents per million population\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n7\n1\n0\n2\n\n8\n1\n0\n2\n\nScienti\ufb01c publications\n\nScienti\ufb01c publications per million population\n\n2,000,000\n\n1,500,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n500,000\n\n\u2013\n\n1,600,000\n\n1,400,000\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n\n400,000\n\n200,000\n\n\u2013\n\n500,000\n\n400,000\n\n300,000\n\n200,000\n\n100,000\n\n0\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n\u2013\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n\u2013\n\n1,600\n\n1,400\n\n1,200\n\n1,000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n\u2013\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\n\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n\n3\n1\n0\n2\n\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n5\n1\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n0\n2\n\nNIEs = newly industrialized economies (with data only for Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and Singapore), OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development, R&D = research and development.\nNote: Regional averages are weighted by gross domestic product.

As noted \nabove, most innovation in developing economies occurs well \ninside the global technology frontier. Adapting advanced \nforeign technology to specific local requirements usually does \nnot involve R&D or generate patents or licensing income. \nSuch innovation nevertheless played a major role in the past \nindustrialization and technological progress of the NIEs and \nthe PRC. Therefore, conventional measures of innovation \nsuch\u00a0as R&D and patents may significantly underestimate the \nextent of innovation in developing economies.\n\nThe current state of innovation in Asia: \na\u00a0\ufb01rm-level perspective \nAn extensive empirical literature highlights the positive impact \nof innovation in individual firms, including R&D, on firm \nperformance and productivity (Hall, Lotti, and Mairesse 2009, \nHarrison et al. 2008, Mairesse, Mohnen, and Kremp 2005, \nRaffo, L\u2019huillery, and Miotti 2008). The literature shows that \nknowledge capital investments to boost productivity do not \noccur solely in advanced countries. However, the nature of \ninnovation in developing countries is somewhat different and \nbest characterized as piecemeal improvements to processes \nor products (Cirera and Maloney 2017). This is a process of \ntechnology adoption, imitation, and adaptation that takes \nplace far from the technology frontier, where firms adopt \nincremental changes (Fagerberg, Srholec, and Verspagen 2010). \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)71\n\nWhile innovation in developing countries often occurs at \nthe margins and depends on implementing technologies and \nproducts already available elsewhere, this process can still \nenable the development of comparative advantage. However, \nlittle is known about the nature of activities and processes by \nwhich firms in developing Asia foster innovation. This section \ndescribes the extent and intensity of firm-level innovation in \ndeveloping Asia. It explores where innovation is occurring in \nthe region and examines firm characteristics associated with \nhigher innovation rates. It also examines firms\u2019 activities such \nas R&D and technology use to reveal variation in innovation \nby industry and firm characteristics. This study aims to paint \na picture of firms\u2019 innovative behavior in developing Asia and \nhow their characteristics relate to innovation.\n\nFor each economy, analysis uses the latest available\u00a0year \n\nof the World Bank Enterprise Surveys to describe the \ninnovation behavior of firms in developing Asia (Table\u00a02.2.1). \nThe survey dataset is comparable across economies and \navailable from\u00a02004. It provides the density of new business \nregistrations adjusted for population and compiles data \nprimarily from face-to-face interviews with business owners \nand top managers, as well as correspondence with participating \nbusiness registrars. The survey uses stratified random sampling \norganized by firm size, business sector, and geographic region \nwithin a country, defining innovation rates as the share of \nfirms introducing product or process innovations.3 It covers \n27\u00a0countries in developing Asia, including 26,855 firms in \nmanufacturing, retail, and other services (Table 2.2.1).4\n\nInnovation data from the Enterprise Surveys suffer from \nsubjectivity regarding what constitutes a new or significantly \nimproved product or process. A lack of follow-up questions \nto provide detail on the accuracy of answers may thus \ngive an inaccurate picture of firms\u2019 innovation activities \nand overestimate innovation rates (Cirera and Muzi 2016). \nDespite\u00a0these limitations, the survey is the most useful option \nbecause it covers a wide set of countries in developing\u00a0Asia \nand uses a standard survey questionnaire and similar \nsampling\u00a0methodology and populations of inference, which \nallow cross-country comparisons of firms. \n\nDeeper analysis of the survey data outlines the landscape of \n\ninnovation in developing Asia. Outstanding features include a \nrelatively strong degree of firm-level innovation in the region, \na tendency for innovation rates to be higher in low-income \ncountries, and a predominance of small improvements to \nexisting products, as opposed to the introduction of new \nproducts in new markets.

Product innovation is highest \nin the Pacific, East\u00a0Asia, and South Asia at more than 40%. \nThis\u00a0figure is notably lower in Central Asia at 14.6% and \nSoutheast Asia at 20.8%. \n\nCompared with product innovation, the share of firms \nthat report process innovation is higher, at 47.7% on average \nin developing Asia. At 60% or higher, this type of innovation is \nstrongest in the Pacific, South Asia, and East Asia. \n\nHigher innovation rates in low-income countries\nThe second feature is a higher rate of innovation in low-income \ncountries. Looking at innovation rates by country reveals \nthat firms in countries with lower income per capita report \nhigher innovation rates (Figure 2.2.7). As\u00a0firms that are \nfurther away from the technology frontier have lower \nproductivity, small improvements in products or processes \nmay be regarded as \u201cinnovation\u201d much more readily than in \nmore advanced\u00a0economies. Moreover, making incremental \nimprovements in products or processes is less expensive \nfor firms further away from the technology frontier, which \ntranslates in the data to higher innovation activity. \n\n\f74(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 2.2.7\u2002Innovation and GDP per capita\n\nProduct innovation\nProcess innovation\n\nLinear (product innovation)\nLinear (process innovation)\n\nFirms reporting product and/or process innovation (%)\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n%\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nNEP\n\nAFG\n\nBAN\n\nSOL\n\nIND\n\nPNG\n\nPRC\n\nTIM\n\nBHU\n\nSRI\n\nMON\n\nPHI\n\nVIE\n\nPAK\n\nKGZ\nCAM\n\nTAJ\n\nMYA\n\nLAO\n\nUZB\n\n7.5\n\nMAL\n\nKAZ\n\nGEO\n\nINO\n\nARM\n\nTHA\nAZE\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n8.0\n\n8.5\n\n9.0\n\n9.5\n\nLog GDP per capita (constant prices)\n\nAFG = Afghanistan, ARM = Armenia, AZE = Azerbaijan, BAN = Bangladesh, BHU = Bhutan, \nCAM\u00a0=\u00a0Cambodia, GDP = gross domestic product, GEO\u00a0=\u00a0Georgia, IND = India, INO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia, \nKAZ = Kazakhstan, KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic, LAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia, MON = Mongolia, MYA = Myanmar, NEP = Nepal, PAK = Pakistan, PNG\u00a0=\u00a0Papua \nNew Guinea, PHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SOL = Solomon Islands, \nSRI\u00a0=\u00a0Sri\u00a0Lanka, TAJ = Tajikistan, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, UZB = Uzbekistan, \nVIE\u00a0=\u00a0Viet\u00a0Nam. \nSource: Khatiwada and Arao, forthcoming(a).\n\nPredominance of small improvements \nto\u00a0existing\u00a0products\nA third feature, shown in Figure 2.2.8, is that, when including \nconsideration of whether a product innovation is novel in \na firm\u2019s main market, innovation rates fall substantially. \nOn\u00a0average, 33.9% of firms in developing\u00a0Asia introduced a \nnew product, but only 19.9% introduced a product that was \nalso new to the market.

As technology licensing is also lower \nin less-developed countries, the share of firms reporting their use of \nlicensed technology increases with per capita GDP (Figure 2.2.16). \nBy firm size, the share of firms that report using\u00a0technology \n\nlicensed from foreign companies is 27.0% for large firms, 13.1% \nfor medium-sized firms, and 7.5% for small firms (Figure\u00a02.2.15). \nExporting firms are twice as likely to use licensed technology as \nnon-exporters, at 26.9% versus 12.7%, and foreign-owned firms \nalmost three times as likely as domestic firms, at 37.3% versus 13.3%. \n\nFigure 2.2.15\u2002 Percentage of firms licensing foreign technology, by region, size, and industry\n\nBy region\n\nBy size\n\nBy exporting status\n\nBy ownership\n\n34.0\n\n27.0\n\n26.9\n\n37.3\n\n22.6\n\n15.5\n\n17.8\n\n11.4\n\n13.1\n\n12.7\n\n13.3\n\n7.5\n\nCentral Asia\n\nEast Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nThe Paci\ufb01c\n\nNon-exporter\n\nExporter\n\nDomestic\n\nSoutheast\nAsia\n\nSmall\n(<20)\n\nMedium\n(20\u201399)\n\nLarge\n(100 and over)\n\nForeign\nowned\n\nSource: Khatiwada and Arao, forthcoming(a).\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure 2.2.16\u2002 Scatter plot of technology licensing, by GDP per capita\n\nFirms reporting technology licensing, %\n\nTON\n\nSOL\n\nPNG\n\nCAM\n\nLAO\n\nTAJ\n\nPAK\n\nBAN\n\nNEP\n\nKGZ\n\nIND\n\nVIE\nUZB\n\nMYA\n\nAFG\n\nINO\n\nFIJ\n\nSAM\n\nTIM\n\nPHI\n\nBHU\n\nMON\n\nPRC\n\nAZE\n\nARM\nGEO\n\nTHA\n\nMAL\n\nKAZ\n\nSRI\n\n8\n\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n10\n\nLog GDP per capita, constant prices\n\nAFG = Afghanistan, ARM = Armenia, AZE = Azerbaijan, BAN = Bangladesh, BHU = Bhutan, \nCAM\u00a0=\u00a0Cambodia, FIJ = Fiji, GDP = gross domestic product, GEO\u00a0=\u00a0Georgia, IND = India, \nINO\u00a0=\u00a0Indonesia, KAZ = Kazakhstan, KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic, LAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, MAL\u00a0=\u00a0Malaysia, MON\u00a0=\u00a0Mongolia, MYA = Myanmar, NEP = Nepal, PAK = Pakistan, \nPNG\u00a0= Papua New Guinea, PHI = Philippines, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SAM = Samoa, \nSOL\u00a0= Solomon Islands, SRI = Sri Lanka, TAJ = Tajikistan, THA = Thailand, TIM = Timor-Leste, \nTON\u00a0= Tonga, UZB = Uzbekistan, VIE = Viet Nam. \nSource: Khatiwada and Arao, forthcoming(a).\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)79\n\nDeterminants of innovation in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia: country-level evidence\nAs seen above, developing Asia now invests substantially in \ninnovation and produces a significant amount of innovative \noutput. A wide array of factors can influence the environment \nfor such activity, including a country\u2019s spending on R&D, \ninvestment in human capital and infrastructure, and openness \nto trade. Clearly, identifying these factors can be very useful \nfor informing policy. This section reports the results of an \nempirical analysis that uses country-level data to identify the \ndeterminants of innovation in developing Asia (Box 2.2.1).\n\nBox 2.2.1\u2002Determinants of innovation: empirical framework\n\nQureshi et al. (forthcoming) examined the \ndeterminants of innovation in developing Asia using a \nfixed-effects panel regression framework. Innovation \nwas represented by patent flows, a commonly used \nmeasure that counts the number of patent applications \nby a country\u2019s residents. The analysis covered \nunbalanced panel data from 22 economies in the \nregion annually from 2000 to 2016. \n\nThe regression equation takes the following form:\n\nInnovit = \n\nRDi,t\u20132 + X\u2019it(cid:19)\u03b2 + ui + vi + (cid:1357)it \n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1\n\nin which the subscripts i refers to the country and \nt\u00a0to\u00a0the year. Innov is innovation as measured by \npatent flows; RD is total annual spending on R&D, \nthe key explanatory variable; X is a vector of time-\nvarying country-level control variables; ui is the \ncountry fixed effect and vi the time fixed effect; and \n(cid:1357)it is the well-behaved error term.a Note that country \nfixed effects can capture omissions at least partly \n(ADB\u00a02020, Borensztein, De Gregorio, and Lee 1998, \nSawada, Matsuda, and Kimura 2012, among others). \nVariables\u00a0were normalized by either population \nor GDP to control for the size of the economy. \nAll\u00a0variables are in natural logs.b\n\nPatent flows include only those applications filed \nby residents through the Patent Cooperation Treaty \nprocedure or with a national patent office for exclusive \nrights to an invention.c Most studies and empirical \nevidence consider patents a reliable measure of \ninnovation (Acs, Anselin, and Varga 2002). They are \nan important feature of innovation, as they protect the \nintellectual property of inventors. Bloom, Van Reenen, \nand Williams (2019) further showed that patent \ncitations can be a measurable indicator of knowledge \nspillover, as firms benefited from existing patents to \nimprove existing products or services.\n\nR&D spending proxies for knowledge accumulated \n\nover time (\u201cknowledge stock\u201d) and human capital \nin R&D. Such data can be interpreted as inputs used \nin the innovation process, with patents representing \ninnovation output. To construct R&D capital stocks, \na 20% depreciation rate was adopted here following \nUlku (2004), as recent studies suggest that the actual \nfigure may be higher than the 15% traditionally \nassumed and may vary across industries.\n\nSeveral other factors possibly influence innovation \n\napart from R&D. Higher educational attainment, for \ninstance, provides a base of highly skilled personnel \nthat firms and other institutions can employ in\u00a0R&D \n(Stern, Porter, and Furman 2000). The higher \neducation needed for innovation can be reflected by \nsecondary school enrollment, which measures the \nintensity of human capital investment. This variable \nwas therefore included in the regression to capture, \nat a broader level, the effect of human capital on a \ncountry\u2019s innovation.\n\nCountry-level control variables in the empirical \n\nmodel were trade openness, the share of imports \nof manufactures in total trade in manufactures, the \nshare of total trade with the US in national GDP, \nand measures of financial development and good \ngovernance.\n\nVarious studies have documented the role of \ntrade in technology flows and innovation across \ncountries (ADB 2020, Grossman and Helpman\u00a01991, \nRomer 2010, among others). Trade openness is self-\nexplanatory. The\u00a0share of imports of manufactured \ngoods in total trade accounted for the \u201cinternational \ntechnology spillover effect,\u201d which may increase \ndeveloping countries\u2019 innovative capacity. \n\ncontinued next page\n\n\f80(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nBox 2.2.1\u2002Continued\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0the\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0US trade in national output \ncontrolled for the effect of economic alliance with \nthe world\u2019s largest economy, given that most patent \napplications worldwide are also filed with the \nUS\u00a0Patent Office.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund\u2019s financial \n\ndevelopment index measures how developed financial \ninstitutions and markets are in terms of depth \n(size\u00a0and liquidity), access (ability of individuals and \ncompanies to tap financial services), and efficiency \n(ability of institutions to provide financial services at \nlow cost and with sustainable revenue, and the level \nof activity of financial markets). A highly developed \nfinancial system has been shown to help small \ninnovative firms find funding from venture capitalists \n(Morck and Yeung 2001). Moreover, evidence \nshows that financial constraints or \u201cfunding gaps\u201d \nfrequently mean costly R&D capital, which holds back \ninnovation (Hall and Lerner 2010, Kerr, Nanda, and \nRhodes-Kropf\u00a02014). \n\nusing index scores from the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide \nGovernance Indicators to measure institutional quality. \nThe score from 1 (worst) to 6 (best) was calculated \nfrom the normalized summation of the six dimensions \nof governance: (i) voice and accountability, (ii) political \nstability and absence of violence, (iii) government \neffectiveness, (iv) regulatory quality, (v) rule of law, \nand (vi) control of corruption (ADB 2018).\n\nThe box table reports the result of the empirical \n\nanalysis of determinants of innovation, which are \nproxied by patent flows.\n\na  This innovation function is adapted from Ulku (2004), \n\nusing a log linearized version.\n\nb  Country and year dummies have been included to \n\ncontrol for the time trend and idiosyncratic shocks. \nRobust\u00a0standard errors are clustered at the country level.\n\nc  Patent applications are preferable to patents granted to \neliminate the considerable lag between them and make \nreadily available longer time series.\n\nThe good governance variable is a normalized score \n\nGovernance index\n\nEmpirical results: determinants of patent flows\n\nDeveloping Asia\n\nDeveloping Asia  \nexcluding the \nPRC\n\nR&D stock\n\nSecondary school \nenrolment\n\nTrade openness\n\nImport of \nmanufactured\u00a0goods\n\nUS trade, % of GDP\n\nFinancial development, \nindex\n\nInfrastructure access\n\nObservations\n\nR2\n\nNumber of countries\n\nCountry FE\n\nYear FE\n\n0.215**\n(0.101)\n\n2.001***\n(0.682)\n\n\u20130.305\n(0.353)\n\n\u20130.754\n(0.685)\n\n0.127\n(0.079)\n\n0.978\n(1.409)\n\n1.883**\n(0.722)\n\n0.047\n(0.307)\n\n264\n\n0.562\n\n20\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n0.174**\n(0.079)\n\n1.096**\n(0.446)\n\n\u20130.070\n(0.287)\n\n0.151\n(0.524)\n\n0.173**\n(0.078)\n\n\u20130.530\n(0.728)\n\n2.672***\n(0.544)\n\n0.080\n(0.211)\n\n247\n\n0.521\n\n19\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1, FE = fixed effects, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, PRC\u00a0=\u00a0People\u2019s Republic of China, R&D = research and \ndevelopment, US\u00a0= United States.\nNote: Robust standard errors in parentheses.\nSource: Qureshi et al., forthcoming.\n\nThe results suggested that patent flows positively relate \nto investment in R&D in developing Asia, as well as to human \ncapital accumulation. A 1.0% increase in R&D investment \nper capita increased patent flow by 0.2% in developing\u00a0Asia. \nThe\u00a0coefficient was only slightly lower if the PRC was excluded, \nunderscoring higher innovation not only in large market \neconomies but overall, extending the findings of Ulku (2004). \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)81\n\nFindings on secondary school enrollment as a significant driver \nof patent flows in the region highlight the key role education \nplays in innovation (Raghupathi and Raghupathi\u00a02017) and the \nimportance of human capital in upgrading a nation\u2019s innovative \ncapacity (Stern, Porter, and Furman 2000, Ulku 2004).\n\nAmong trade-related variables, only the share of total \n\ntrade with the US in GDP had a significant coefficient, \nand only when the PRC was excluded from the sample for \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia. The\u00a0result possibly reflected spillover from the \nregion\u2019s high volume of trade with the US, which is the main \nsource of technological know-how for developing Asia.\n\nThe provision of infrastructure positively and significantly \n\nrelated to patent flows. This captured how infrastructure \nsuch as roads, electrical power, water supply, and information \nand communication technology connectivity complement \ninnovation. In contrast, financial development did not seem to \nbe a significant determinant of innovation.\n\nTo sum up, the evidence from empirical analysis of country-\n\nlevel data suggests that R&D investment, human capital, \nand access to infrastructure all have positive and significant \nimpact on innovation in developing Asia. The finding that a \n1.0% increase in secondary education enrolment increases \npatent flows by 2.0% reinforces the notion that innovation \nis fundamentally a human endeavor. The\u00a0next\u00a0section takes \na closer look at the role of education, human capital, and \nentrepreneurship in innovation in the region.\n\n\f82(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFostering innovators and \na\u00a0culture of innovation\n\nThe empirical evidence in the preceding section points \nto human capital having a significant role in innovation. \nThis\u00a0is\u00a0not surprising given that innovation is fundamentally \nand intrinsically a human enterprise. Indeed, the history of \nmankind is basically one of innovations, from the first fire and \nsharp-edged tools to the wheel, the compass, and the internal \ncombustion engine, and on to space rockets and the internet. \nAll these great inventions are testaments to human ingenuity. \nA\u00a0prerequisite for an innovative society is therefore a large pool \nof creative innovators who are willing to ask new questions \nand seek alternative solutions. A sound education system that \nencourages curiosity, originality, and new ways of thinking \nhelps create a pool of potential innovators. Another important \nsource of innovation is high-quality entrepreneurship as \nepitomized by Steve Jobs of Apple and Jack Ma of Alibaba. \nAs these examples illustrate, information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) has dramatically expanded opportunities for \ninnovative entrepreneurship.\n\nThis section first provides empirical evidence of the \nrelationship between human capital and innovation at the \nfirm level in developing Asia. Next, it focuses on the role of \neducation in nurturing future innovators and the critical \nchallenges that education systems in the region face in \nfulfilling that role. Finally, because innovators need the \nright entrepreneurial ecosystem to convert their ideas into \nmarketable products and services, the discussion turns \nto the basic framework and grounded assumptions of \nentrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nThe role of human capital in innovation: \nevidence from \ufb01rms\nHuman capital strengthens the capacity of a firm to absorb \nand develop new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990, \nSmith,\u00a0Collins, and Clark 2005), which makes it essential to \ninnovation, both at the frontier and catching up to it. In\u00a0fact, \neven when they use technologies and products already available \nelsewhere, firms still need a workforce with the appropriate \nskills and knowledge. While policies such as R&D tax credits \nand direct public funding may boost innovation in the short\u00a0run, \nit is more effective in the long run to increase the stock of \nhuman capital (Bloom, Van Reenen, and Williams 2019).\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)83\n\nPrevious studies found a robust positive association between \n\nhuman capital and innovation output, but their proxies for \nhuman\u00a0capital were often restricted to formal schooling (Ayyagari, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2011, Robson, Haugh, and Obeng \n2009, Toner\u00a02011). Increasing\u00a0the stock of human capital through \ntraining sponsored by firms often engenders greater innovation \n(Dostie\u00a02018). Employee schooling and the provision of training \nimprove human capital within a firm and positively influence \ninnovation output, as does slack time made available for such \ncreative activities as ideation, experimentation, and prototype \ndevelopment (van Uden, Knoben, and Vermeulen 2017).\nWhile firm-level surveys for several economies in \n\ndeveloping\u00a0Asia offer detailed information on innovative activity \nand human capital, cross-country analysis is made extremely \nchallenging by differences in survey instruments, sampling \nmethodology, and populations of reference. World\u00a0Bank Enterprise \nSurveys, on the other hand, have somewhat less detailed indicators \nof innovation and human capital, but they cover a substantial \nnumber of Asian economies. These surveys are therefore useful to \nexplore the relationship between a firm\u2019s propensity to innovate \nand its human capital, the latter proxied by employee educational \nattainment, employee training, and the industry-specific \nexperience of the top manager, which is a neglected but important \nattribute when studying innovation. Another question to explore \nis whether offering training to employees has greater impact on \nfirm-level innovation when a firm\u2019s operations are constrained \nby the inadequate skills of its workers. Box\u00a02.3.1 discusses the \nempirical specification for this analysis.\n\nBox 2.3.1\u2002The role of human capital in innovation: empirical approach\n\nThe following equation was used to estimate a linear \nprobability model of the relationship between a firm\u2019s \nhuman capital and its innovation, controlling for broad \nfirm characteristics (Model 1 in Table 2.3.1):\n\nInnovijc = \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u00b7 HCijc + (cid:576) \u00b7 Fijc + \u03b4j + (cid:592)c + (cid:1995)ijc\n\nwhere Innovijc is a binary indicator of whether firm i in \nindustry j in country c introduced either a new product \nor a new process, as defined in the Oslo Manual 2018.\n\nHCijc is a set of proxies for firm-level human\u00a0capital: \n\nthe share of employees that completed high school \n(a proxy for the stock of generic skills and basic \nknowledge available within the firm), the number \nof years of experience the top manager has accrued \nworking in the industry, and formal training \nprovided to employees, which includes classroom \nwork, seminars, lectures, workshops, audio-visual \npresentations, and demonstrations with a structured \n\nand defined curriculum. Formal training does \nnot include, however, employee orientation upon \nbeing hired or training to familiarize workers with \nequipment and machinery on the shop floor or the \nestablishment\u2019s standard operating procedures.\n\nFijc is a vector of other firm characteristics shown \n\nin the literature to affect the firm\u2019s propensity to \ninnovate, such as firm size, age (number of years in \noperation), foreign ownership, export orientation, and \nR&D; \u03b4j is industry fixed effects; and (cid:592)c is country fixed \neffects, while (cid:1995)ijc captures unobserved firm, industry, \nand country characteristics.\n\nAlso estimated is a model that includes an \n\ninteraction term capturing how employer-sponsored \ntraining can compensate for a paucity of skills \n(Model\u00a02 in Table 2.3.1).\n\nSource: Khatiwada and Arao, forthcoming(b).\n\n\f84(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 2.3.1 reports the results of the linear probability \n\nmodel in Box 2.3.1. Model 1 shows all three proxies for \nhuman capital positively and significantly associated with \nthe predicted probability of firms to introduce a new product, \nbut only employee training is positively and significantly \nassociated with the probability of implementing a new process. \nThis\u00a0finding suggests that different aspects of human capital \nmatter for product versus process innovation.\n\nTable 2.3.1\u2002Linear probability model estimates\n\nVariable\n\nWorkforce with high school education (%)\n\nNew product\n\nNew process\n\nInteraction of training and skills\u00a0constraint\n\nManager experience\n\nTraining\n\nSkills constraint\n\nMedium-sized (default: small)\n\nLarge (100+)\n\nMature (default: young)\n\nOlder\n\nForeign owned\n\nExporter\n\nIndustry FE\n\nCountry FE\n\nObservations\n\nResearch & development\n\nModel 1\n\n0.000479***\n(0.00373)\n\n0.0161***\n(0.00292)\n\n0.0771***\n(0)\n\n0.0439***\n(4.57e-06)\n\n0.0713***\n(5.95e-07)\n\n0.0258**\n(0.0259)\n\n0.0333**\n(0.0133)\n\n0.00637\n(0.711)\n\n0.00643\n(0.559)\n\n0.362***\n(0)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n20,670\n\nModel 2\n\n0.000483***\n(0.00362)\n\n0.0158***\n(0.00366)\n\n0.0650***\n(1.36e-08)\n\n\u20130.0215\n(0.274)\n\n0.0857***\n(0.000547)\n\n0.0440***\n(3.73e-06)\n\n0.0713***\n(8.20e-07)\n\n0.0266**\n(0.0239)\n\n0.0332**\n(0.0141)\n\n0.00741\n(0.666)\n\n0.00603\n(0.586)\n\n0.362***\n(0)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n20,567\n\nModel 1\n\n0.000326*\n(0.0990)\n\n0.00954\n(0.129)\n\n0.0782***\n(1.90e-08)\n\n0.0748***\n(0)\n\n0.117***\n(0)\n\n0.0161\n(0.212)\n\n0.00772\n(0.545)\n\n\u20130.0157\n(0.343)\n\n0.0270**\n(0.0109)\n\n0.376***\n(0)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n20,532\n\nModel 2\n\n0.000321\n(0.107)\n\n0.00937\n(0.145)\n\n0.0748***\n(5.18e-07)\n\n0.0269*\n(0.0937)\n\n0.0122\n(0.620)\n\n0.0741***\n(0)\n\n0.116***\n(0)\n\n0.0164\n(0.208)\n\n0.00715\n(0.577)\n\n\u20130.0155\n(0.352)\n\n0.0258**\n(0.0145)\n\n0.377***\n(0)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n20,428\n\n* = significant at 10%, ** = significant at 5%, *** = significant at 1%, FE = fixed effects.\nNotes: Robust p-values in parentheses.

This supports the argument that firm-level \ntraining can update or upgrade employees\u2019 knowledge and, \nmore importantly, provide specific knowledge not available \nin general education. The predicted probabilities of reporting \na new product were 0.048% for the share of the workforce \nwith a high school education and 1.6% for the top manager\u2019s \nexperience. The estimates were similar in magnitude for \nthe implementation of a new process but not statistically \nsignificant.\n\nThe estimated coefficients for other firm characteristics \nwere mostly in line with the literature: medium-sized and large \nfirms were more likely to report a new product or process than \nsmall firms, and firms that exported were more likely to report \na new product or process than firms that sold exclusively \non the domestic market. R&D expenditure was positively \nassociated with innovative outcomes, the predicted probability \nof a firm that spent on R&D reporting a new product being 36% \nand a new process 38%.\n\nModel 2 investigated whether employer-sponsored training \n\nwas more strongly associated with innovative activity for \nfirms reporting skills constraints. Once again, the results \nvaried between product and process innovation. For product \ninnovation, the positive and significant association between \nemployer-sponsored training and reporting a new product was \nstronger for skills-constrained firms than for firms that did \nnot face severe or very severe skills constraints. For process \ninnovation, on the other hand, the interaction was smaller \nand statistically insignificant. In sum, model 2 suggests \nthat employer-sponsored training may be a mechanism to \ncompensate for the constraints resulting from an inadequately \neducated workforce.\n\nThe conclusion is that a firm\u2019s human capital\u2014proxied by \nthe percentage of the workforce with high school education, \nmanagerial experience, and employer-sponsored training\u2014\nis positively and significantly associated with likelihood to \nengage in product innovation and, to a lesser extent, process \ninnovation, suggesting that different aspects of human capital \nmatter to different types of innovation. These findings are \nconsistent with the literature, which shows that the quality of \na firm\u2019s human capital is a key determinant of its capacity to \nabsorb new technology and knowledge (Almeida and Fernandes \n2008, Comin and Hobijn 2004, Lederman and Maloney 2003, \nKeller 2004). Additionally, the findings show that providing \ntraining to employees has more impact than other measures \nof human capital, especially for firms whose operations are \nconstrained by inadequately skilled workers.\n\n\f86(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nEducation plays a vital role \nin fostering innovation\nHuman capital has many determinants: health and nutrition; \neducation, training, and work experience; social and \ncommunication skills; habits and personality traits; and \nindividual fame and brand image. It is evident that education \nplays a fundamental role in building human capital in the \nform of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Further, \na sound education system can create a pool of potential \ninnovators by fostering inquisitiveness and creativity.\n\nUnfortunately, education often fails to deliver on its \nbasic mission to create employable graduates, let alone \nfuture innovators. The world faces a learning crisis, in \nwhich hundreds of millions of children and young people in \ndeveloping Asia today learn very little.\n\nFocus \ufb01rst on basic skills\nFigure 2.3.1 shows the estimated fraction of 10-year-olds in \na range of Asian economies who are unable to read a simple \nsentence\u2014a metric that the World Bank has termed \u201clearning \npoverty.\u201d In a number of economies, this figure is greater \nthan 50%, meaning that the majority of children do not have \neven basic literacy. Asia\u2019s learning crisis is most pronounced \nin South\u00a0Asia, where millions of children are in school but \nlearning at low levels (ASER-Pakistan 2019, ASER 2018).\n\nFigure 2.3.1\u2002Learning poverty and GDP per capita in Asian economies\n\n% learning poverty\n\n100\n\nAfghanistan\n\nPakistan\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nCambodia\n\nIndonesia\n\nArmenia\n\nThailand\n\nAzerbaijan\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\nGeorgia\n\nSri Lanka\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nMalaysia\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nViet Nam\n\nKazakhstan\n\nJapan\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nSingapore\n\n10,000\n\n20,000\n\n30,000\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n60,000\n\n70,000\n\n80,000\n\nGDP per capita ($)\n\nNote: Bubble size represents population size.

Some economies perform better in achieving \nbasic literacy in primary school but still underperform in \nsecondary school, as shown in Figure 2.3.2. In a number of \nAsian\u00a0economies, the majority of 15-year-olds do not meet even \nminimum expected proficiency in reading. However, there are \nalso examples of Asian economies performing far better than \nexpected based on their GDP per capita. Further, among the \nmore developed economies of Southeast and East Asia, one can \nfind some of the best education systems in the world.\n\nFigure 2.3.2\u2002Reading proficiency of 15-year-olds in Asian economies\n\nStudents at Level 1 or below\n\nStudents at Level 2 or above\n\nLevel 6\nLevel 5\nLevel 4\nLevel 3\nLevel 2\nLevel 1\nBelow Level 1\n\nB-S-J-Z, PRC (81%)\n\nMacau, China (88%)\n\nSingapore (95%)\n\nHong Kong, China (98%)\n\nRepublic of Korea (88%)\n\nJapan (91%)\n\nTaipei,China (92%)\n\nOECD average (88%)\n\nMalaysia (72%)\n\nBrunei Darussalam (97%)\n\nThailand (72%)\n\nBaku, Azerbaijan (46%)\n\nKazakhstan (92%)\n\nGeorgia (83%)\n\nIndonesia (85%)\n\nPhilippines (68%)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nB-S-J-Z = Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Figures in parentheses following the economy\u2019s name are the percentage of 15-year-olds covered by the sample.

However, it can be assumed that, \nif education systems are not managing to develop even these \nbasic skills, they are very unlikely to be developing higher-\norder skills such as problem solving and critical thinking.\nGiven the huge variation in learning outcomes across \ndeveloping Asia, any economy wishing to drive innovation \nthrough its education system needs to assess the current state \nof this system. Economies achieving good outcomes have a \nrange of options to foster innovation. Those where learning \noutcomes are low, on the other hand, need to acknowledge \nthis weakness and focus on improving the quality of basic \neducation. Without\u00a0basic foundational skills including literacy \nand numeracy, it\u00a0is almost impossible for students to go on and \nachieve higher learning.\n\nTo develop the education system, policy makers need to \n\nensure that learning outcomes are measured and that the \neducation system is sufficiently aligned with the goal of \nimproved learning. Facing up to the learning crisis can be \npainful for governments and societies, but if it is not done, \ncountries are left unable to embrace the innovation needed to \ndrive development.\n\nShift teaching practices to develop \ninnovation\u00a0capabilities\nInnovation requires a range of capabilities that can be grouped \ninto two categories: \u201copening capabilities\u201d and \u201cclosing \ncapabilities.\u201d5 Both kinds are needed in the general population \nand in leadership positions (Figure\u00a02.3.3).\n\nFigure 2.3.3\u2002Opening and closing innovation capabilities\n\ni\n\np\nh\ns\nr\ne\nd\na\ne\nL\n\nl\n\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nu\np\no\nP\n\n\u2022  Openness to questioning\n\n\u2022  Failure tolerance\n\n\u2022  Consultative management style\n\n\u2022  Monitoring and enforcing goal attainment\n\n\u2022  Results focus\n\n\u2022  Performance management\n\nOpening Innovation Capability\n\nClosing Innovation Capability\n\n\u2022  Creativity\n\n\u2022  Problem solving\n\n\u2022  Critical thinking\n\nSource: Newman, Gentile, and dela Cruz, forthcoming.\n\n\u2022  Grit\n\n\u2022  Perseverance  \n\n\u2022  Long-term orientation  \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)89\n\nOpening capabilities are the set of skills and approaches \nrequired to enable the generation of new ideas. Ordinarily, they \nare a range of overlapping \u201csoft skills\u201d such as creativity, problem \nsolving, evidence literacy, and critical thinking (Ueki and Guaita \nMart\u00ednez 2019, Saidi et al. 2019, Brazdauskas\u00a02015). However, \nhaving innovative people with strong opening capabilities in \nan organization is not sufficient. Also needed is an enabling \nenvironment created by leaders who possess capabilities such\u00a0as \nopenness to questioning, failure tolerance, and a consultative \nmanagement style (Barsh, Capozzi, and Davidson 2008, Burpitt \nand Bigoness 1997, Lewis, Ricard, and Klijn 2018, Fischer et\u00a0al. \n2018, Baer and Frese 2003). These\u00a0leadership attributes are \ncritical, as innovation often fails not for lack of innovative ideas \nbut because leaders have not created an environment that enables \ninnovation to flourish. Indeed, evidence exists that having people \nwith many new ideas in an organization that does not enable \ninnovation can actually hinder performance more than having no \ninnovative people at all (Baer and Frese 2003).\n\nClosing capabilities, on the other hand, are the set of \nskills and approaches needed to see an innovation through to \ncompletion. In a population, they include such attributes as grit, \nperseverance, and long-term orientation. They enable people to \npush forward the implementation of new ideas even in the face \nof challenges. In leadership, the attributes include the ability to \nmonitor and enforce goal attainment, a\u00a0strong focus on results, \nand performance management.\n\nAs innovations proceed through organizations, a gradual \nshift will see less time spent on opening processes and more time \non closing processes. This requires careful balancing by leaders \nin particular, as the approaches that enable opening may conflict \nwith those that facilitate closing (Bledow\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02009). \n\nSome of the capabilities needed for innovation are influenced \n\nby culture, so different countries need to consider where their \nstrengths and opportunities lie (Bledow\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02009). For\u00a0example, \nfailure intolerance is a particular issue in parts of Asia, where \npeople tend to harbor more fear of failure than in other parts \nof the world (OECD 2019). Indeed, a number of countries in the \nregion now explicitly nurture tolerance of failure. Recent results \nfrom Hubner et al. (forthcoming) highlights differences in the \ndistribution of innovation capabilities across Asia and the Pacific. \nThe study observed that teams in the PRC were particularly \nstrong in closing capability but weaker in opening capability, \nwhile teams in India had the opposite distribution.\n\nFor decades, education experts have discussed how \npedagogical approaches affect learning. One way to consider \nteaching approaches is to see them as a continuum running \nfrom teacher-centered approaches, which use traditional and \ndidactic\u00a0techniques to impart knowledge, to learner-centered \napproaches, which use more interactive approaches that help \nstudents direct their own learning (Weimer 2013, Brown 2003). \n\n\f90(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nLearner-centered approaches\u2014which include problem-based \nlearning, group discussions, learning by doing, individual and \ngroup assignments, discussion, experimentation, competitions, \ndebate, and games\u2014have long been advocated as means to \ndevelop opening innovation capabilities. The theory is that \nenabling students to experiment, seek out information, and \nsolve\u00a0problems imparts skills that can be applied throughout \ntheir lives.\n\nNo globally comparable data exists on teaching practice. \n\nStudies have been carried out using ratings by observers, \nteachers, or students, but it is unclear how comparable these \nscores are across cultures. Evidence from cross-cultural \ncomparisons has found that self-reported cultural values are \nnot a good indicator of cultural practices, as ratings are greatly \naffected by cultural norms (Taras et al. 2010) and the same \nproblem may affect data on teaching practice (Aldridge et al. \n2000, among others).\n\nTable 2.3.2 presents a traffic light assessment of teaching \n\npractice in selected economies in Asia and the Pacific. \nTwo indicators are chosen to assess the degree of learner-\ncenteredness in teaching practice and are graded using \nqualitative descriptions from classroom observation studies: \n\u201cgroup work and interactive learning\u201d and \u201cstimulation of \nhigher-order thinking.\u201d These teaching practices are known \nto stimulate opening innovation capabilities in students \n(Scott\u00a02015). Red indicates evidence that practice is generally \nnot present. Amber indicates either evidence that practice \nis partly present or conflicting evidence from two or more \nstudies. Green\u00a0indicates evidence that practice is often or \nusually present. Gray indicates the absence of evidence on this \npractice.\n\nThe first indicator for learning outcomes in Table\u00a02.3.2 \n\nis \u201cearly literacy,\u201d which is based on the World Bank \nLearning Poverty Indicator. Red indicates that more than \n50% of 10-year-olds are unable to read a simple text, amber \nindicates the proportion is between 10%\u201349%, and green \nindicates a proportion less than 10%. The second learning \noutcome is the average Programme for International Student \nAssessment (PISA) 2018 reading, math, and science scores, \nwith red indicating a score below 450, amber 450\u2013500, and \ngreen above 500. It\u00a0is\u00a0expected that those with high learning \noutcomes will have strong closing innovation capabilities since \nthere is a significant correlation between students\u2019 academic \nachievement and their possession of qualities like grit and \nperseverance (Kutlu, Kartal, and \u015eim\u015eek 2017, Karlen et al. 2019, \nChristopoulou et al. 2018). High\u00a0academic learning outcomes\u2014\nand therefore closing innovation capabilities\u2014can be developed \nthrough either learner-centered or teacher-centered approaches; \nhowever, by using learner-centered approaches teachers can \nalso instill opening innovation capabilities.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)91\n\nTable 2.3.2\u2002Descriptions of teaching practice in Asia and the Pacific\n\nTeaching practice\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nGroup work \nand interactive \nlearning\n\nStimulation of \nhigher-order \nthinking\n\nEarly literacy\n\nAverage \nreading, math, \nand science \nscore at age 15\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAustralia\n\nBangladesh\n\nCambodia\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nJapan\n\nMalaysia\n\nHong Kong, China\n\nPhilippines\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSingapore\n\nViet Nam\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Chinaa\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\n(cid:79)\n\na\u2002 The average reading, math, and science score at age 15 for the People\u2019s Republic of China is not representative \n\nof the country because only Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu participated in the Programme for \nInternational\u00a0Student Assessment 2018.\n\nNotes: The two indicators for teaching practice, \u201cgroup work and interactive learning\u201d and \u201cstimulation of higher-\norder thinking,\u201d were graded in the study based on qualitative descriptions from published classroom observation \nstudies.

This is consistent with other studies that \nchallenge the stereotype of Asian education as uniformly \ndidactic and dependent on rote learning (Takayama\u00a02017, \nYou\u00a02019). A number of Asian economies have teaching \npractices that are both poor quality and teacher-centered. \nDeveloping high-quality, learner-centered teaching strategies \nwill help these economies to improve both opening and closing \ninnovation capabilities. Other economies achieve high learning \noutcomes using relatively teacher-centered approaches. \nPolicy\u00a0makers in these economies may wish to promote the \nfurther evolution of teaching practice to optimize innovation \ncapabilities.\n\n\f92(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nAchieving change in pedagogical practice is notoriously \n\ndifficult (Weimer 2013). Attempts by external actors to \ntransplant learner-centered practices developed in one culture \ninto an entirely different one have usually failed to achieve the \nintended outcomes (Schweisfurth 2013). Even where learner-\ncentered rhetoric has been adopted by policy makers, this \nmay translate into a relatively superficial impact on actual \nteaching practice (You 2019, Brinkmann 2019). However, \npolicy\u00a0makers across the region have scope to consider the \ntypes of capabilities their society needs and to design culturally \nembedded approaches to teaching and learning to develop \nthem. There is nothing particularly Western about educational \npractices that can drive innovation. Cultural practices \ninfluence teaching practice across Asia and can contribute to \ndeveloping innovative capabilities. For example, Confucius \nadvocated that learners should take ownership of their learning \nand develop higher-order thinking skills, and this has had a \nstrong influence on teaching in the PRC (Tan 2015). Similarly, \nIndia celebrates jugaad, or improvisation to create solutions \nwhen constraints are harsh or resources limited. This clearly \nencourages problem solving and experimentation (Prabhu and \nJain 2015).\n\nIn recent decades, countries across Asia have exerted \nconsiderable effort to shift their educational practices toward \nstrengthening innovative capability. Singapore initiated its \nThinking Schools, Learning Nation reform in 1997 and its \nTeach Less and Learn More policy in 2006 (Takayama 2017). \nThe PRC\u00a0initiated its New Curriculum Reform in 2001 with \nthe aim of promoting \u201cpupils\u2019 creative and critical spirits and \ncapabilities\u201d (You 2019). Japan introduced initiatives designed \nto promote \u201czest for living\u201d and \u201clow pressure, room for \ngrowth\u201d in\u00a02002 (Takayama 2017). Philippine basic education \npolicy states that \u201cevery graduate of basic education shall be \nan empowered individual who has learned\u2026 the capability \nto engage in autonomous, creative, and critical thinking\u201d \n(Care\u00a0and Luo 2016).\n\nPolicy\u00a0makers need to be realistic and bear in mind that \nachieving change in pedagogical practice can be challenging. \nHowever, only by fostering new ways of teaching and by \ninvesting in new approaches in schools can Asian countries \ntackle the learning crisis and forge ahead to bolster innovative \ncapability.\n\nBroaden and diversify the skills mix\nNo single formula exists for blending school subjects to drive \ninnovation. The ability to experiment and test ideas, which \ncan be developed through effective science, technology, \nengineering, and math (STEM) teaching, is certainly \nimportant for innovation. Experts warn, however, against \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)93\n\noveremphasizing STEM subjects at the expense of those \nthat can develop creativity, such as art and design, or critical \nthinking, such as social science and humanities. In fact, the \nliterature suggests that a mix of different skills is key to\u00a0driving \ninnovation (Toner\u00a02011).\n\nInnovation in some sectors requires advanced technical \n\nskills and therefore requires graduates with qualifications \nas high as doctoral degrees (Marvel and Lumpkin 2007, \nLarson\u00a02011, Toner\u00a02011). It is almost impossible for someone \nto develop an innovative treatment for malaria, for example, \nwithout first honing advanced skills in microbiology and \npharmacology. Similarly, innovations in car manufacturing are \nlikely to come only from someone highly skilled in engineering. \nHowever, innovation in services or the public sector may \ndepend less on technical skills than on general management \nand business skills (Marvel and Lumpkin 2007, Toner 2011). \nPolicy\u00a0makers need to assess which skills are needed and \nensure the availability of mechanisms to link the tertiary \neducation provided with the needs of industry.\n\nAlso important is to maintain diversity in skills, as \ninnovation often results when different skill sets collide. \nOne\u00a0way to achieve this is for individuals to develop skills in \nmore than one area. A doctor with skills in coding may be \nexcellently prepared to identify novel approaches to digital \nhealth delivery, for example, as would an architect with \nknowledge of social development to identify and overcome \nphysical barriers to inclusion. The\u00a0advantages of developing \nmore than one area of expertise are demonstrated by a \nstudy that found students pursuing dual majors are more \ninnovative than those focused on a single major (Selznick and \nMayhew\u00a02018).\n\nSome universities are now exploring how to guide students \n\nalong more flexible learning journeys that allow them to \ndevelop skills across disciplines. In the PRC, for example, a \nnumber of prestigious universities are attempting to make \nundergraduate learning more diverse. Fudan University has \nchanged the undergraduate curriculum to allow students \nto study a broad range of subjects in their first 2 years \nbefore having to choose a specialization in their third year. \nSimilarly,\u00a0Yuanpei\u00a0College\u00a0at\u00a0Peking University requires \nstudents\u00a0to take general education courses in one of four \nareas: humanities, social issues, science, and art (Godwin and \nPickus\u00a02017). Another\u00a0approach to stimulate innovation is \nto supplement single major studies with courses specifically \ndesigned to build innovation skills (Wright et al. 2007, \nThongpravati, Maritz, and Stoddart 2016).\n\n\f94(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nEntrepreneurship and innovation \nin\u00a0developing Asia\nHow entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic \ndevelopment interact is more complex than is often thought. \nEntrepreneurs are a mixed bag, as are the teams they form \nand the new businesses they create. Most entrepreneurs are \nnot economically innovative, as few create new jobs in any \nsignificant number or have the means to be productive.\n\nA telling discovery is that only a small minority of new \nfirms in any cohort, dubbed \u201cgazelles,\u201d are responsible for \na disproportionate share of employment generation (Birch, \nHaggerty, and Parsons 1997).\n\nThis section looks closely at what determines the \nproductivity potential of entrepreneurial ecosystems. \nThe\u00a0hypothesis is that institutional conditions can shape the \nproductivity potential of new entrepreneurial firms through \ntheir impact on entry decisions and on post-entry choices \nregarding the pursuit of innovation and growth.\n\nNot all \ufb01rms are born equal\nData on entrepreneurial startups in a set of ADB developing \nmember economies show that, although only 0.4% of new \nentrepreneurial businesses had grown enough to have 250+ \nemployees within 42 months, these firms provided 44% of \nnew jobs created by this group. In contrast, 54% of all new \nbusinesses employed no more than two people and created \nonly 9% of new jobs. Obvious questions ask what drives this \nheterogeneity and whether it is possible to design policy \nmeasures that effectively help new entrepreneurial firms \nfulfill their productivity potential and thus better contribute \nto economic development. This\u00a0does not imply that micro \nfirms are unimportant. Although\u00a0their job creation is limited, \nthey nevertheless provide an important number of livelihoods, \nparticularly in situations where individuals may have few \nalternatives.\n\nNew entrepreneurial firms are defined as companies \n\nlaunched and owner-managed by individuals or groups of \nindividuals. Table\u00a02.3.3 shows that new entrepreneurial \nbusinesses vary considerably in terms of their dominant \nactivity; their patterns of innovative activity; how locationally \nspecific their activities, resources, and markets are; and their \nresulting productivity potential and ability to contribute \nto economic development. One\u00a0type of entrepreneurial \nbusiness\u00a0is worth highlighting: new\u00a0digital\u00a0ventures. \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)95\n\nTable 2.3.3\u2002New and entrepreneurial business categories\n\nDescription of the \nbusiness\n\nSpecialization and \ninnovation drivers\n\nLocation speci\ufb01city \nof activities\n\nLocation speci\ufb01city \nof demand\n\nProductivity \npotential\n\nHighly localized, \nwith local sourcing of \nresources and supplies\n\nHighly localized\n\nLow\n\nType of business\n\nLocal service \nbusinesses\n\nLow- to medium-\ntechnology small \nand medium-sized \nenterprises\n\nNew high-\ntechnology \nventures\n\nSoftware \nbusinesses\n\nDigitally enhanced \nservice businesses\n\nReputation based on \nservice quality or price, \nlocation specificity, \nbusiness premises, \npersonal relationships, \nand branding\n\nMainly through process \ninnovation in the \nform of specialized \nmanufacturing assets \nand coordinated \ninvestment when the \ninnovation requires \ncomplementary \nassets;

Established entrepreneurial businesses have \nbeen operating for longer than 42 months. Micro\u00a0businesses \nin the smallest category of 1\u20132 employees including \nowner-manager(s) evidently dominate both samples. \nAmong\u00a0baby businesses, 53.7% qualified as micro businesses. \nAmong established businesses, 53.8% did. In\u00a0contrast, \nentrepreneurial businesses with 250 or more employees \nrepresented only 0.4% of either baby businesses and \nestablished businesses. Contributions\u00a0to\u00a0employment were \ndramatically different, however. While\u00a0micro\u00a0businesses \ngenerated 8.8% of total employment if baby businesses, and \n8.7% if established businesses, baby businesses with 250+ \nemployees generated 44.1% of employment and established \nbusinesses of that size generated 43.1%.\n\nThe same skewed pattern can be observed in \nentrepreneurial businesses offering new products that \nare unfamiliar to customers (Figure 2.3.5). Among\u00a0baby \nbusinesses, 16.4% indicated that their product or service \nwas new and unfamiliar to all of their customers. \nAmong established businesses, 14.4% did. Among baby \nbusinesses, 34.2% indicated their product or service was \nnew and unfamiliar to only some of their customers. \nAmong\u00a0established businesses, 25.0% did. Nearly half of \nbaby businesses, or 49.3%, said none of their customers \nfound their product or service new or unfamiliar, as did \n61.0% of established businesses.\n\nThe survey confirmed that most new businesses are \nnot innovative. Note that the threshold for qualifying as \na \u201cproduct innovator\u201d was quite low, as it did not require \npatenting or formal investment in R&D. As most new and \nentrepreneurial businesses failed to meet even relatively \nsoft criteria for innovation, it is plain to see how growth \nimpact from new firms tends to be highly skewed within \nany\u00a0cohort.\n\n%\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nAll\nSome\nNone\n\n% of \ufb01rms\n\n100\n\nBaby businesses\n\nEstablished businesses\n\nNote: Data cover 2006\u20132016 for Bangladesh; Georgia; Hong\u00a0Kong, \nChina; India; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Malaysia; Pakistan; the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; the Philippines; the Republic of Korea; \nSingapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; Tonga; Vanuatu; and Viet Nam.\nSource: Autio, forthcoming.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)97\n\nIn a weak institutional environment, \nentrepreneurs\u00a0choose informality\nWhether or not an entrepreneurial firm has formally registered \nis a good proxy of its productivity potential because informal \nbusinesses are less likely to accumulate property and invest in \ninnovation to grow their operation. A panel regression empirically \nassesses at the country level the impact of institutions, including \nentry regulations, on informal entrepreneurial activity\u2014that is, the \ncreation of new firms without entering them on business registers. \nData\u00a0from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and World\u00a0Bank \nEnterprise Surveys are combined to construct country-level \nestimates of the population density of formal and informal entries.\nTable 2.3.4 presents the results of three estimation models \nshowing the impact on outcomes of interest from entry regulations, \nproperty rights protection, and the rule of law. Entry barriers \ninclude the number of registration procedures, the cost of \nregistration, and the minimum paid-in capital needed to start a \nbusiness in a particular country. Outcomes of interest are formal \nentry, defined as the population density of formal business \nregistrations, and informal entry, defined as the population density \nof informal business entries.\n\nThe results in Table 2.3.4 support the notion that \n\nentrepreneurs choose informality if property right protection \nand the legal environment are weak. The number of registration \nprocedures significantly influenced formal registrations but not \ncorrespondingly informal entries. Other\u00a0dimensions of entry \nregulation had no significant effect, though one should note that \nthe analysis focused on a relatively small sample of economies \nin developing Asia. The analysis nonetheless provides evidence \nsuggesting that the rules of the game affect the allocation of \nentrepreneurial effort and, therefore, the productivity potential of \nnew entrepreneurial businesses (Baumol 1996, Murphy, Schleifer, \nand Vishny 1991).\n\nA large informal sector makes formal \ufb01rms less\u00a0productive\nHigh density of informal entrepreneurial entries constitutes \nfor formally registered entrepreneurs a negative externality \nbecause unfair competition undermines their willingness to \ninnovate and grow their enterprises. This matters because \nfair market competition is a vital ingredient of innovation \n(ADB 2020). A\u00a0cross-level regression that combines data from \neconomies and firms explores the effect of the national population \ndensity of informal entrepreneurial entries and institutional \ndeterminants on the propensity of entrepreneurial\u00a0firms to \ninnovate, use new technologies,\u00a0export, and expand\u00a0employment. \nData\u00a0on\u00a0product\u00a0innovation, the use of new technology, and export \nactivity is used to measure firm-level productivity potential, \nestimating the effects separately for baby businesses less than \n42\u00a0months old and established businesses older than 42\u00a0months.\n\n\f98(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 2.3.4\u2002Institutional influences on formal and informal entrepreneurship density rates\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nFormal\n\nInformal\n\nStarting a business: number of procedures\n\nStarting a business: registration\u00a0cost\n(% per capita income)\n\nStarting a business: paid-in minimum capital \n(% per capita income)\n\nProperty right protection\u00a0\n\n\u20130.285**\n(0.102)\n\n0.002\n(0.039)\n\n0.016\n(0.039)\n\n0.120\n(0.251)\n\n\u20130.104\n(0.114)\n\n\u20130.042\n(0.112)\n\nRule of law\n\nPopulation size\u00a0\n\nPopulation growth (%)\n\nDevelopment stage\n(second quintile of GDP per capita at PPP)\n\nDevelopment stage\n(third quintile of GDP per capita at PPP)\n\nDevelopment stage\n(fourth quintile of GDP per capita at PPP)\n\nDevelopment stage\n(fifth quintile of GDP per capita at PPP)\n\nGDP growth (%)\n\nEstablished firm rate (%)\u00a0\n\nConstant\n\nObservations\n\nNumber of economies\n\n\u20130.058\n(0.392)\n\n\u20130.082\n(0.060)\n\n0.030\n(0.137)\n\n\u20130.090\n(0.180)\n\n\u20130.281\n(0.228)\n\n\u20130.453\n(0.327)\n\n\u20130.023\n(0.026)\n\n0.022\n(0.060)\n\n0.294\n(0.390)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n\u20130.120\n(0.186)\n\n0.123\n(0.127)\n\n0.584+\n(0.311)\n\n\u20130.662+\n(0.391)\n\n\u20130.573\n(0.465)\n\n\u20130.831\n(0.615)\n\n0.026\n(0.084)\n\n0.416**\n(0.130)\n\n0.316\n(0.312)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n\u20130.279**\n(0.103)\n\n0.007\n(0.041)\n\n0.003\n(0.043)\n\n0.067\n(0.080)\n\n0.242\n(0.177)\n\n\u20130.087\n(0.355)\n\n\u20130.086\n(0.063)\n\n\u20130.019\n(0.144)\n\n\u20130.107\n(0.188)\n\n\u20130.275\n(0.232)\n\n\u20130.453\n(0.330)\n\n\u20130.036\n(0.028)\n\n0.022\n(0.062)\n\n0.345\n(0.337)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n0.284\n(0.185)\n\n\u20130.137\n(0.105)\n\n0.129\n(0.115)\n\n\u20130.346**\n(0.115)\n\n\u20130.415**\n(0.159)\n\n\u20130.021\n(0.137)\n\n0.190+\n(0.101)\n\n0.923***\n(0.277)\n\n0.079\n(0.390)\n\n0.589\n(0.485)\n\n1.123\n(0.689)\n\n0.067\n(0.080)\n\n0.254*\n(0.117)\n\n\u20130.541+\n(0.327)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n0.052\n(0.076)\n\n\u20130.345**\n(0.117)\n\n\u20130.241\n(0.323)\n\n\u20130.154*\n(0.063)\n\n0.039\n(0.146)\n\n0.104\n(0.185)\n\n0.080\n(0.210)\n\n0.232\n(0.251)\n\n\u20130.023\n(0.029)\n\n0.017\n(0.066)\n\n0.049\n(0.347)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n\u20130.125\n(0.124)\n\n0.230*\n(0.107)\n\n0.906**\n(0.292)\n\n\u20130.444\n(0.354)\n\n\u20130.224\n(0.375)\n\n\u20130.254\n(0.462)\n\n0.070\n(0.086)\n\n0.365***\n(0.109)\n\n\u20130.009\n(0.271)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n0.216\n(0.183)\n\n\u20130.378\n(0.289)\n\n\u20130.133*\n(0.062)\n\n\u20130.013\n(0.152)\n\n0.034\n(0.187)\n\n0.038\n(0.209)\n\n0.185\n(0.250)\n\n\u20130.030\n(0.030)\n\n0.000\n(0.066)\n\n0.095\n(0.326)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n\u20130.401*\n(0.182)\n\n0.006\n(0.172)\n\n0.139\n(0.115)\n\n0.682*\n(0.294)\n\n\u20130.333\n(0.396)\n\n\u20130.093\n(0.436)\n\n\u20130.226\n(0.529)\n\n0.029\n(0.082)\n\n0.270*\n(0.134)\n\n0.008\n(0.296)\n\n58\n\n11\n\n* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, + p<0.10, GDP = gross domestic product, PPP = purchasing power parity.\nNotes: Standard errors in parentheses.

The\u00a0next\u00a0section examines in greater detail three \nspecific elements of the institutional environment that \ninnovators face: intellectual\u00a0property rights, financial systems, \nand urban innovation clusters.\n\n\f102(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nConducive institutions and \nenvironment for innovators\n\nThis study has examined the role of human capital in spurring \ninnovation in developing Asia, taking into account the intrinsically \nand fundamentally human nature of innovation. It\u00a0analyzed the \nrole of the education system and the entrepreneurial ecosystem \nin fostering an innovative culture that can encourage more \nAsian\u00a0innovators. Notwithstanding the central role played by \nbrilliant individuals in innovation, it takes teamwork, networking, \nand collaboration to transform innovative visions into reality. \nA\u00a0well-known example is Steve\u00a0Jobs working with Steve Wozniak \nand other friends to create Apple in a garage in a California\u00a0suburb. \nMore\u00a0fundamentally, the most successful innovators do not \ninnovate in a vacuum but rather within institutions and \nenvironments that foster innovation. Not even the greatest \ninnovative concepts can get off the ground if innovators lack \nfinancing. Success may also be unlikely in the absence of adequate \nintellectual property rights (IPRs), as an environment lacking \nprotection may deter innovators from investing time and effort \nin innovation. Yet another important dimension of the innovation \nenvironment is the availability of innovation networks, of which \nSilicon Valley is perhaps the most famous.\n\nIPRs, innovation, and performance \nas the ROK developed\nIPRs take many forms, each appropriate at a different stage of \neconomic development. The ROK is widely viewed as a benchmark \nfor innovation among developing countries because it transformed \nitself from only one among many into a highly innovative, high-\nincome economy within just a few decades. The ROK experience \ncan therefore be very informative about how IPRs evolve as an \neconomy develops and moves up the innovation ladder. It can offer \nvaluable lessons for countries in developing Asia that aspire to \nemulate ROK success in becoming a knowledge-based economy.\n\nIn such an economy, technological innovation and intellectual \n\ncapital are important determinants of economic growth. IPRs \nare among the most powerful intangible assets that determine a \nfirm\u2019s productive capacity. Lee (2013) referred to this capability to \nexplain the ROK and Asian experience in catch-up development. \nThis\u00a0approach can be considered an extension of the view \ncrediting technology, whereby the accumulated technological \ncapability of firms sustained ROK economic growth for several \ndecades (OECD\u00a01992, Hobday\u00a01995, Kim 1997).\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)103\n\nFigure 2.4.1\u2002Registration of IPRs in the Republic of Korea, 1970\u20132010\n\nPatent\nUtility model\nTrademark\nDesign\n\nThousands\n\n140\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009\n\nIPRs = intellectual property rights.\nNote: Utility model registration rapidly diminished because that process changed in 2006 into an evaluation system. At the same time, patent \nregistrations decreased because large \ufb01rms such as Samsung and LG reduced their registration of patents with the Korean Intellectual Property \nOffice. Since the mid-2000s, large ROK \ufb01rms have applied for and registered patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office instead, \nto better compete in the global market.\nSource: Lee, Kang, and Park, forthcoming.\n\nThe data resoundingly confirm the conventional wisdom \nthat the ROK engineered a spectacular transformation from \na poor developing country into one of the world\u2019s most \ninnovative economies. As latecomers and followers with \nlimited technological capacity at the outset, ROK firms \ninitially, before the 1980s, relied heavily on reverse engineering \nand imported equipment or machinery (Lee et al. 2003). \nThen,\u00a0after\u00a0accumulating sufficient technological capability, \nROK firms intensified their innovative activities, expanding \nthe number of IPR registrations each year from 8,418 in 1971 to \n145,927 in 2009 (Figure 2.4.1).\n\nA recurring debate on the relationship between IPRs \nand innovation has been whether strong or weak protection \nbetter stimulates innovation (Maskus and Penubarti 1995, \nSmith\u00a01999, Awokuse and Yin 2010). However, without \ninnovation capability, nothing is produced even with strong \nIPRs (Lee\u00a02019). Recent literature has correspondingly shifted \nfocus from the effects of strong-versus-weak IPR protection \non economic growth at different stages of development to, \ninstead, the various roles of the diverse forms of protection, \nwhich include, in addition to regular invention patents, utility \nmodels, trademarks, and design patents (Kim et\u00a0al.\u00a02012). \nConventional\u00a0patent rights alone, for example, are not \nalways effective in promoting innovation, particularly \nimitative innovation. Such\u00a0issues need to be considered in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia, which faces the challenge of managing its \ntransition from imitation to innovation.\n\n\f104(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nExisting empirical research on diverse IPR forms\nKim et al. (2012) showed that, in developing countries, simply \nstrengthening patent rights does not promote innovation and \ngrowth, which is better promoted by minor IPR\u00a0forms such\u00a0as \nutility models, often called petty patents.6 Lee\u00a0(2019)\u00a0and \nKang\u00a0et al. (2019) observed two different paths for technological \ndevelopment, one driven by patents, the other by trademarks. \nWhich path to follow depends on the nature of business, some \nof which rely more on trademarks than patents. For\u00a0instance, \ntrademarks are more important when the innovation involves \ntacit knowledge that cannot be filed as patents, or when firms \nare more oriented toward domestic markets than world markets. \nThe literature on trademarks regards them as expressions of the \nquality and variety of products (Block et al. 2015, Sandner and \nBlock 2011) and as a measure of product innovation (Mendon\u00e7a, \nPereira, and Godinho 2004). \n\nThe shift from research into the strength of IPRs toward \nthat which identifies the role of diverse forms of IPRs can be \nseen most clearly in Kim et al. (2012) and Kang et al. (2019), \nwarranting a closer look at these two studies.\n\nKim et al. (2012) exploited data at the level of the country \nand firm to empirically research the effects of IPR protection on \ninnovation and economic growth. It focused on the roles of two \ntypes of protection: patents and utility models. The\u00a0results\u00a0from \nboth datasets are complementary. First, differences in economic \ngrowth and innovation can be explained in high-income countries \nby variations in patent rights but not by utility model rights. \nSecond, the reverse is seen in middle- and low-income countries. \nThat is, utility models help a developing\u00a0country to build its \ntechnological capacity. Incremental, adaptive R&D generates \ninnovations that qualify for such utility model protection and \nprovide a foundation for becoming more sophisticated and \neventually producing patentable innovations. \n\nThese results suggest that the correct goal for developing \ncountries is not to ensure either strong or weak IPR protection, \nbut rather to determine the appropriate kind of protection for \ntheir stage of development. However, this point is seemingly \nneglected in previous research and in current policy debates \ninformed by it. Correspondingly, data on firms in the ROK show \nthat, when ROK firms still lagged technologically from 1970 \nto 1986, incremental innovations had a positive impact on firm \nperformance when controlling for other variables, but patents did \nnot have a statistically significant effect. This\u00a0finding strongly \nsupports the view that utility models are a good strategy for \ngrowth in latecomers, particularly at the early stages. \n\nIn the period 1987\u20131995, when the ROK had already acquired \n\ngreater technological and R&D capabilities, patents positively \nand significantly influenced sales growth, with utility model \napplications becoming insignificant. This\u00a0exemplifies how \na role reversal may occur after considerable technological \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)105\n\ncompetence is achieved, as firms rely less on minor innovations \nfor their performance and increasingly on patentable innovations. \nMoreover,\u00a0this suggests that utility model innovations can be \nimportant inputs toward generating future patentable innovations.\nKang et al. (2019) showed how dynamic changes in leading \nindustries were reflected in applications for different types of IPR \nprotection, with utility models and trademarks filed mostly in \nlight manufacturing until the 1980s. Faced with challenges caused \nby macroeconomic factors such as rising wages and changing \ncompetitive landscapes with the rise of new rivals, ROK firms \nturned their attention to developing technological capability, \nfrom the mid-1980s especially in information and communication \ntechnology. Corporate in-house R&D centers started to mushroom, \nand private and public R&D expenditure climbed steeply. As they \nglobalized, ROK industries departed from\u00a0the previous catch-up \nmodel based on imitative technologies and embarked on more \nadvanced innovation.\n\nThis structural transformation was fully reflected in the \n\ntransition from the early dominance of utility models and \ntrademarks to the later dominance of patents. An interesting \ndivision between patent-dominated and trademark-dominated \nindustries was observed. The former included electronics, \ninformation and communication technology, machinery, \nand automobiles, and the latter pharmaceuticals and light \nmanufacturing such as food, apparel, and leather. This pattern is \neven more visible in firm-level IPR statistics, in which trademark \ndomination tends to reflect the nature of knowledge and the \ninitially low or slow development of technological capability in \nareas such as pharmaceuticals, where firms have focused on the \ndomestic market rather than exports.\n\nThe evolving role of design in innovation: \nnew\u00a0empirical evidence\nThe assertion that different IPR forms offer more appropriate \nprotection at different development stages can best be illustrated \nby the growing importance of industrial design in ROK\u00a0innovation. \nPerhaps because design is viewed as a less important dimension \nof innovation, in contrast to a new technology, design is the most \nneglected, least analyzed IPR form in economics.\n\nDesign (or industrial design) as defined by the World \n\nIntellectual Property Organization is the ornamental or aesthetic \naspects of a product or service. Design is defined as \u201cthe\u00a0shape, \npattern, color, or any combination thereof in an article, which \nproduces an aesthetic impression on the sense of sight.\u201d \nDesign\u00a0is\u00a0an important way to add value to products and services \nand make them more competitive (Rothwell\u00a0and Gardiner 1983). \nDesigns make a product more attractive and appealing, adding \ncommercial value and facilitating marketability. In\u00a0addition, \ndesign is an important driver of innovation, acting as a bridge \n\n\f106(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nbetween technical and customer-oriented functions (Kline\u00a0and \nRosenberg 1986, Rothwell 1992, Walsh\u00a01996). Appropriate \ndesign for a user-friendly feature helps satisfy customers.\n\nProduct differentiation is often achieved through better \ndesign. Moreover, technology gaps can be overcome by design. \nThe relationship between the national economy and design \ncan be discussed in relation to the stage of development of the \nnational industrial strategy. Design is not important when the \nnational economy is underdeveloped because growth relies on \nlow wages enabling the mass production of low-cost goods. \nHowever, the importance of design increases as the economic \nstructure advances. International competitiveness can be \nmaintained only through product differentiation and quality \nimprovement achieved through technological innovation and \ndesign development.\n\nIn the ROK, examples of the relationship between product \n\ncompetitiveness and industrial design can be seen in the \nelectronics, rubber, and plastic industries.

For this purpose, the study built a \nrich firm-level panel database covering 7,094 externally \naudited firms in 22 manufacturing industries during \n1971\u20132010. The database includes data for patents \nand design for all firms in the sample, as well as their \nfinancial variables.a\n\nThe sample period is divided into three subperiods \n\nthat reflect important episodes in ROK economic \nhistory: 1971\u20131986, 1987\u20131998, and 1999\u20132010. \nSince\u00a0the\u00a0mid-1980s, the ROK has emphasized \nin-house R&D in the private sector, and considerable \npublic\u2013private joint R&D has been established to \npursue projects (Lee 2013). In 1987, extensive revision \nof patent law included the introduction of substance \npatents. The\u00a0Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 \nprecipitated major structural reform that had far-\nreaching effects on economic structure and innovative \nactivity in the ROK.\n\nTo assess the effects of IPRs on each group and \n\nperiod, the study ran system generalized method \nof moments (GMM) regression with 1-year lagged \nvariables, setting out the relationship between IPRs \nand firm performance, which was proxied by firms\u2019 \nsales growth. A full set of year dummies was included \nto account for time-dependent overall effects in \nmarkets. Full sets of industry dummies were also \nincluded to capture industry-specific variations. \nThe\u00a0empirical specification is as follows:\n\nPerformancei,t =  \u03b20 + \u03b21Performancei,t\u20131 + \n\n\u03b22Performancei,t\u20132 + \u03b23Design intensityi,t\u20131 \n+ \u03b24Patent intensityi,t\u20131 + \u03b25(Design \nintensityi,t\u20131 * Patent intensityi,t\u20131) \n+ \u03b11Advertisement Ratioi,t\u20131 + \n\u03b12R&D\u00a0intensityi,t\u20131 + \u03b13Employeesi,t\u20131 + \n\u03b14Agei,t + \u03b5it\n\nEvidence from firm-level analysis confirmed that \nsales growth was significantly associated with high \ndesign intensity. However, a positive relationship \nemerges only after firms attain a certain capability\u2014\nin\u00a0the ROK since the 1990s but not during the 1970s \nand 1980s. It should be noted that, in the early stages \nof ROK development, utility models or petty patents \nsubstantially shaped the innovation landscape. \n\nSystem GMM regression to test links between design \nand performance\n\nPeriod 1:\n1971\u20131986\n\nPeriod 2:\n1987\u20131998\n\nPeriod 3:\n1999\u20132010\n\nVariables\n\nSales growth (t\u20131)\n\nSales growth (t\u20132)\n\nDesign intensity (t\u20131)\n\nPatent intensity (t\u20131)\n\nExport sector dummy\n\nEmployees (t\u20131)\n\nFirm age (t\u20131)\n\nAdvertisement ratio \n(t\u20131)\n\nR&D intensity (t\u20131)\n\nConstant\n\nObservations\n\nAR2\n\nNumber of firms\n\n\u20130.173***\n(\u20132.926)\n\n\u20130.030**\n(\u20132.036)\n\n\u20131.108\n(\u20131.068)\n\n7.823\n(1.291)\n\n0.049\n(1.266)\n\n\u20130.109\n(\u20130.661)\n\n\u20131.026\n(\u20130.813)\n\n0.145\n(0.912)\n\n0.013***\n(2.929)\n\n7.055\n(0.654)\n\n1,880\n\n0.5805\n\n634\n\n0.027*\n(1.935)\n\n\u20130.003\n(\u20131.264)\n\n1.909\n(1.029)\n\n0.407\n(0.720)\n\n0.015***\n(2.886)\n\n\u20130.291***\n(\u20133.870)\n\n\u20130.052\n(\u20130.411)\n\n0.019***\n(3.572)\n\n0.003***\n(3.583)\n\n2.839\n(0.951)\n\n15,093\n\n0.2003\n\n2,653\n\n0.016\n(1.519)\n\n\u20130.002\n(\u20130.813)\n\n0.627***\n(2.747)\n\n0.992***\n(4.243)\n\n0.018***\n(2.977)\n\n\u20130.160***\n(\u20133.020)\n\n\u20130.414**\n(\u20132.495)\n\n0.065***\n(6.835)\n\n0.003***\n(2.874)\n\n0.131\n(0.029)\n\n38,177\n\n0.8227\n\n5,892\n\n* = p<0.10, ** = p<0.05, *** = p<0.01, AR2 = Arrelano-Bond Test \nfor second-order serial correlation, GMM = generalized method of \nmoments, R&D\u00a0=\u00a0research and development.\nNote: t-statistics in paretheses.\nSource: Lee, Kang, and Park, forthcoming.\n\nIn\u00a0the\u00a0full sample of firms, design and patent \nintensities positively contributed to firm performance \nonly in the last period. In sum, the evidence from ROK \nfirms points to a growing influence from design over \ntime, in\u00a0conjunction with a growing role for patents.\n\na The dataset is the same one used in Kang et al. (2019). \nThe IPR variables for each firm are retrieved from the \nKorean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service \n(www.kipris.or.kr), and accounting variables are data from \nthe Korea Information Service Value (www.kisvalue.com).\n\n\f108(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nPolicy implications\nSeveral policy implications can be derived from existing \nstudies and new firm-level analysis that focuses on the design\u2013\nperformance link. The evolution of ROK innovation from 1971 to \n2010 suggests that different IPR forms are more appropriate at \ndifferent development stages. During\u00a0the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0early\u00a0stage \nof development, firms\u2019 sales growth was more closely associated \nwith petty patents or utility models (Kim et\u00a0al.\u00a02012). During the \npost-1987 catch-up phase, two innovation pathways emerged: \none\u00a0oriented toward trademarks and for firms tending to sell \nmostly domestically (Kang et al. 2019), and one oriented toward \ndesign and for firms tending mostly to export. Since the 2000s \nand the globalization and maturing of the ROK economy, regular \npatents and designs have assumed greater importance.\n\nThe key takeaway for developing Asia is that industrial \ndesigns, petty patents, and trademarks can, like regular patents, \nbe effective forms of IPR protection, but at different stages or for \ndifferent industries. Finally, better design is an important way \nfor firms to differentiate their products and compete successfully \nin global markets. The rise of Samsung\u00a0Electronics as a world-\nclass tech giant underlines the high value added by design in \nthe innovation process, especially at later stages of economic \ndevelopment.\n\nFinancial architecture and innovation\nAccess to finance is indispensable to innovation, which is \ninherently costly and fraught with risk and uncertainty. \nThere\u00a0is almost no way of knowing beforehand which particular \ninnovations will turn out to be commercially successful. \nIt\u00a0is\u00a0even\u00a0more difficult to predict whether an innovator can \nturn his innovative vision into a viable reality. Yet even the \ngreatest inventions need financing to succeed. While Apple is \nwidely associated with Steve Jobs, for example, the iconic tech \ngiant would never have emerged without the bold, high-risk \ninvestment of Mike Markkula, who provided critical seed \nmoney and managerial support during Apple\u2019s embryonic phase. \nA\u00a0crucial\u00a0component of viable innovation is, therefore, a sound \nand efficient financial system that can channel resources to \naspiring innovators. \n\nThis study now takes a close look at the link between \n\nfinance and innovation through cross-country empirical analysis \n(Box\u00a02.4.2). It asks in particular whether financial intermediaries \nsuch as banks or capital markets are more conducive to \ninnovation\u2014and, if markets, what kind? Given\u00a0widely\u00a0varying \nstages of economic development in developing\u00a0Asia, an \nadditional question is whether a country\u2019s income affects \nthe analytical comparison of intermediaries versus markets. \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)109\n\nBox 2.4.2\u2002Innovation under various types of financing\n\nTo determine the influence of financial architecture \non innovation, a fixed effects panel regression was \nperformed on the following model:a\n\nyi,j,t+1 =  \u03b20 + \u03b21Equityit + \u03b22Debtit + \u03b23Bankit + \u03c1Controlsit + \n\nEquity\n\n\u03b4i,j + \u03bct + \u03b4i,j,t+1\n\nin which the subscripts i, j, and t refer to a country, \nindustry, and year.b The dependent variable yi,j,t+1 \nrepresents innovation measured in different ways: the \nquantity of innovation, measured by number of patents, \nand the quality of innovation based on how innovative \nand exclusive patents were, measured by the number \nof citations and independent claims. Equityit, Debtit, \nand Bankit are proxies for the development of \nequity markets, private debt markets, and financial \nintermediaries such as ordinary savings banks and \nother financial institutions, divided by GDP. \n\nPatent data are from the US Patent and Trademark \nOffice, and annual financial market development and \nother economy-level information are from the World \nDevelopment Indicators database and its Global \nFinancial Development database. The sample included \n47 developed and emerging economies. Each economy \nhad at least one patent granted by the US Patent and \nTrademark Office by March 2019 and a mixed financial \narchitecture, combining banks and markets, during the \nsample period 1997\u20132016.\n\nThe results showed that financial structures in an \neconomy mattered disproportionately to innovation \nby industry. In particular, the findings indicated that \nmarket-based financial systems, as represented by \nboth equity and debt markets, had a positive and \nsignificant effect on both R&D efficiency, as measured \nby the number of patents granted (box table) and \non innovation quality and exclusiveness, based \non the number of citations and claims. However, \nintermediary-based financial systems failed to \nencourage innovation and even rendered lower-quality \npatents during the period. \n\na  This analysis is based on the work of Huang and \nTian (forthcoming). That study restricted its \nsample to economies with (i) at least one patent \ngranted by the US Patent and Trademark Office \nby\u00a0March\u00a02019 and (ii) a\u00a0mixed financial architecture \nduring 1997\u20132016, using both banks and markets. \n\nFinancial architecture and innovation\n\nRelative number of patents\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n0.017***\n(2.74)\n\n0.030***\n(5.20)\n\n0.047***\n(3.36)\n\n\u20130.020\n(\u20130.81)\n\n0.041***\n(4.10)\n\n0.008\n(0.40)\n\nDebt\n\nBank\n\nLabor\n\nExport\n\nR&D\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u20130.007***\n(\u20135.03)\n\n\u20130.005***\n(\u20133.12)\n\n\u20130.005*\n(\u20131.74)\n\n\u20130.010***\n(\u20132.93)\n\nPopulation growth\n\n0.001\n(0.35)\n\n0.006*\n(1.87)\n\n\u20130.001\n(\u20130.41)\n\n0.009***\n(3.49)\n\n\u20130.049***\n(\u20134.19)\n\n\u20130.064***\n(\u20134.43)\n\n\u20130.053***\n(\u20134.98)\n\n\u20130.056***\n(\u20134.00)\n\n\u20130.009\n(\u20130.57)\n\n\u20130.021\n(\u20131.35)\n\n0.004\n(0.23)\n\n\u20130.050***\n(\u20133.01)\n\n0.126***\n(4.78)\n\n0.154***\n(5.14)\n\n0.128***\n(4.71)\n\n0.155***\n(4.88)\n\nExport to the US\n\n0.082\n(0.76)\n\n0.071\n(0.66)\n\n0.078\n(0.76)\n\n0.077\n(0.74)\n\nObservations\n\n28,841\n\n20,445\n\n28,761\n\n20,445\n\nadj.

Further,\u00a0regional economies show wide variation \nin financial development and maturity, ranging from \nglobal\u00a0financial centers such as Singapore and Hong Kong, \nChina to less developed countries with only rudimentary \ncapital markets.\n\nEmpirical analysis in this section has focused on the effect \n\nof financial architecture on innovation quantity and quality. \nBut, as much as finance can affect innovation, innovation \ncan also affect finance. Indeed, financial technology, or \nthe integration of new technology and financial services, is \ncurrently reshaping the global financial landscape. It has \npotential to become a powerful agent for financial inclusion, \nwhich can contribute to inclusive growth.\n\nFinancing modalities analyzed in this section are by \nno means complete or comprehensive. Precisely because \ninnovation is inherently risky and uncertain, financing \ninnovation has given rise to more specialized forms of \nfinancing modalities that are more capable of mobilizing \nand allocating seed money. Silicon Valley is replete with \nsophisticated mechanisms for channeling high-risk capital. \nVenture capital is perhaps the best-known example today, \nhaving been among the first to emerge. With the financial \nindustry undergoing rapid change, other revolutionary \nmechanisms are sure to follow.\n\nCities as engines of innovation\nUrban agglomeration plays an important role in fostering \ninnovation (Feldman and Audretsch 1999, O\u2019Huallachain\u00a01999). \nAs shown above, economies in developing Asia are becoming \nincreasingly innovative. At the same time, they are \nexperiencing rapid urbanization. Urban innovation clusters or \nhubs can be a powerful promoter of innovation. Silicon Valley, \nthe birthplace of the global tech industry, is perhaps the best-\nknown example. Some well-known urban innovation clusters in \ndeveloping Asia are Zhonguancun, Shenzhen, and Zhangjiang \nin the PRC; Bangalore and Hyderabad in India; and Pangyo \nTech Valley in the ROK. But is there a systematic relationship \nbetween innovation and urbanization? Most existing evidence \non the effect of urban agglomeration on innovation comes \nfrom developed economies. Systemic evidence is lacking \nas to whether urban agglomeration affects innovation, \nand if so, what the channel might be for it to occur in the \ndeveloping\u00a0world, including Asia.\n\nA few generally accepted assumptions, however, provide \n\ninsight on the issue. One is that innovation tends to be \nconcentrated in a few cities that serve as innovation\u00a0hubs. \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)111\n\nAnother is how firms in larger cities tend to be more \ninnovative. Finally, the presence of top-tier universities often \nhelps to explain host cities\u2019 disproportionate role in innovation. \nThese findings are discussed in greater detail below.\n\nEmergence of innovation hubs\nWidely recognized in the existing literature is that innovation \ntends to be highly concentrated spatially. Within a given \ncountry, there are generally a few cities that are innovation \nhubs. These hubs host a large share of the country\u2019s \ninnovative activities\u2014one that is typically disproportionate \nto its share of the country\u2019s population. For instance, Nieto \nGalindo\u00a0(2007) found that over 70% of Colombia\u2019s innovations \nwere concentrated in three main cities that together \nwere home to less than 40% of the country\u2019s population. \nIn\u00a0the\u00a0US, Moretti\u00a0(2019) showed that the top 10 innovative \ncities in computer science were home to 70% of inventors, \nin\u00a0semiconductors 79%, and in biology and chemistry 59%.\n\nTable 2.4.1\u2002 Share of urban population and innovative firms  \n\nin the 10 most innovative cities in selected countries\n\nFeature concentrated, %\n\nPRC India\n\nIndonesia Kazakhstan Malaysia\n\nUrban population\n\nProcess innovation\n\nProduct innovation\n\nR&D\n\n55\n\n64\n\n72\n\n64\n\n43\n\n70\n\n76\n\n73\n\n\u200272\n\n\u200299\n\n\u200293\n\n100\n\n67\n\n94\n\n83\n\n91\n\n70\n\n99\n\n80\n\n92\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, R&D = research and development.\nNote: The 10 most innovative cities in each country are the ones with the highest share of \nfirms that undertake process innovation. Each cell is the sum of shares of these 10 cities.\nSource: Chen, Hasan, and Jiang, forthcoming.\n\nSimilar patterns were clearly observed in Asia. Each\u00a0city\u2019s \nshare of firms reporting process innovation, product innovation, \nand R&D expenditure was calculated and then compared with \nits share of national population (Table\u00a02.4.1). A city with a \nshare of firms engaged in innovation that was higher than its \nshare of total population reflected concentration of innovation. \nIn the PRC, 10 cities were found to host 64% of the country\u2019s \nfirms involved in process innovation, 72% of firms in product \ninnovation, and 64% of firms investing in R&D, while together \naccounting for only 55% of the national population. The contrast \nis even starker in India, where the top 10 cities host 70% of \nfirms involved in process innovation, 76% in product innovation, \nand 76% undertaking R&D, while together accounting for only \n43% of the country\u2019s population.\n\n\fFigure 2.4.3\u2002 Cumulative shares of innovative firms \nversus urban population\n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nIndia\nIndonesia\nKazakhstan\nMalaysia\n\nCumulative share of R&D \ufb01rms\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nCumulative population share\n\nR&D = research and development.\nNotes: Each data point represents a natural city, or an urban \nagglomeration delineated without regard for municipal boundaries. \nNatural cities are sorted by innovative \ufb01rm share in ascending \norder.

Each data point in the figure represents one \nnatural city, and the cities are ranked by their share of \nfirms involved in each of the three innovation activities. \nAll the curves in the figure demonstrate a Lorenz-type \nconvex feature, implying consistent spatial concentration \nof innovation across different countries and innovation \nactivities. In general, curves for Malaysia and India are more \nconvex than those for the PRC, suggesting a higher degree of \ninnovation concentration in those two countries.\n\nThe figure also shows that many large cities have high \n\nshares of innovative firms, indicated by segments with \nrelatively long projections on the horizontal axis and slopes \ngreater than 45 degrees. However, some megacities are \nshown to have disproportionately low shares of innovative \nfirms, indicated by segments with long projections on \nthe horizontal axis and slopes of less than 45 degrees. \nKuala\u00a0Lumpur in Malaysia, Jakarta in Indonesia, and \nAlmaty in Kazakhstan all have shares of national population \nlarger than their shares of innovative firms.\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nGreater innovation in larger cities\nHaving established how innovation tends to concentrate \nin a few cities, how does city size affect firms\u2019 innovative \nactivities? And to what extent may this relationship be \ncausal? The\u00a0answers to these questions emerge from an \ninvestigation into the impact of urban agglomeration on a firm\u2019s \npropensity to undertake product innovation, process innovation, \nand R&D (Box\u00a02.4.3). \n\nTop-tier universities as catalysts \nof urban innovation hubs\nWhat drives the disproportionate role of cities in Asian\u00a0innovation? \nAmong a number of potential channels are economies of \nagglomeration, access to markets and finance, and the clustering \nof the different skills that engender innovation. In light of the \nprevious finding that human capital affects innovation, another \nchannel worth exploring is the role of top-tier universities, which \ntend to be highly concentrated spatially. According to ADB (2020), \nmodern technology universities are often located near universities \nand research institutes. Universities, especially the top campuses, \nare pioneers in exploring the uncharted and leaders in pushing the \nknowledge frontier. Countries often allocate abundant resources \nto their top-ranked universities to boost innovation capacity. \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)113\n\nBox 2.4.3\u2002How cities affect innovation \n\nThe econometric analysis is most appropriately \nundertaken by employing a probit model. However, \nendogeneity issues could arise in the baseline \nspecification, biasing the estimated coefficients. \nOne\u00a0concern is that a city\u2019s size and a firm\u2019s innovation \nactivities may be determined simultaneously \n(Moomaw\u00a01981). This could happen if the innovative \noutputs of firms expand production scale, thereby \nattracting more employment to a city and reversing \ncausality (Duranton 2007, 2014). Another explanation \nfor simultaneity is missing local variables that correlate \nwith both city size and innovation. For example, highly \nskilled workers at innovative firms could be attracted \nto large cities by amenities not adequately controlled \nin the regressions. \n\nThe box table shows that greater city size was still \nassociated with a higher propensity for firm innovation \neven after addressing endogeneity.a The second-stage \ncoefficients were significant at the 1% level, though the \nmarginal effects became slightly different. For process \ninnovation, if population size doubled, the predicted \npropensity for process innovation increased by \n3.14\u00a0percentage points from an average propensity of \n44.0%, or a 7.1% increase. For product innovation, the \neffect became smaller: an increase of 4.54 percentage \npoints from a predicted average propensity of 32.6%, \nor a 13.9% increase. For firm R&D, the marginal \neffect was an increase of 1.84 percentage points from \npredicted propensity of 20.9%, or an 8.8% increase. \nTo summarize, after accounting for endogeneity, \n\neconomically and statistically significant effects of \ncity size were associated with its firms\u2019 innovation \ninputs and outputs. The average propensity for firms \nto engage in process innovation, product innovation, \nand R&D increased by 1.8\u20134.5 percentage points, or \nby\u00a07%\u201314%, when city size doubled.\n\nInstrumental variable estimates of elasticities \nof\u00a0firm\u00a0innovation\u2013city population\n\nFirst-stage estimates\n\nlog Population (2010)\n\nVariables\n\nlog Population  \n(1950\u20131959)\n\nOther controls\n\nF statistic\n\nSecond-stage estimates\n\nlog Population (2010)\n\n\u00b1Marginal effect\n\n\u00b1Predicted probability\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nProcess \ninnovation\n\nProduct \ninnovation\n\n(3)\n\nFirm \nR&D\n\n.809***\n(.0118)\n\nYes\n\n.809***\n(.0116)\n\n.812***\n(.0118)\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n5,713.3\n\n5,707.6\n\n5,714.8\n\n.0796***\n(.0295)\n\n.0314***\n(.0116)\n\n.44***\n(.0114)\n\n.126***\n(.0302)\n\n.0454***\n(.011)\n\n.326***\n(.0121)\n\n.0642**\n(.0306)\n\n.0184**\n(.0087)\n\n.209***\n(.011)\n\nSector/Year/Country FE\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nObservations\n\nNumber of cities\n\nF statistic\n\n17,838\n\n18,903\n\n17,673\n\n285\n\n31.00\n\n287\n\n20.29\n\n283\n\n24.77\n\n* = p<0.1, ** = p<0.05, *** = p<0.01, FE = fixed effects, log = logarithm, \nR&D\u00a0= research and development.\nNote: Robust standard errors clustered by country in parentheses. \nSource: Chen, Hasan, and Jiang, forthcoming.\n\na  The instrument used in the estimation was the average of \na city\u2019s 1950\u20131959 population size. The instrument is quite \nstrong, with first-stage F-statistics above 5. This further \nvalidates the first condition for the instrument.\n\nAlthough patents, knowledge, and innovation produced by \nuniversities are often widely transmitted and adopted, evidence \nfrom developed countries shows that there exists a pronounced \nlocalized effect in the transfer of innovations from universities \nto firms. The presence of a university may enable localized \nknowledge spillover into firms\u2019 commercial innovations.\n\nOf the top 500 universities in developing Asia, 248 are \nfound in 99 cities in 9 countries (Table 2.4.2). The pattern \nthat emerges is a high degree of spatial concentration of \ntop\u00a0universities. First, top universities are unevenly distributed \nacross countries. Only 9 of the 25 countries in developing\u00a0Asia \nhave top universities, and 211 of them, or 85%, are located \nin only five countries: the PRC with 78, India with 64, \nMalaysia\u00a0with 25, and Pakistan and Indonesia with 22 each. \n\n\f114(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nTable 2.4.2\u2002Distribution of top universities by country\n\nNumber of \nuniversities\n\nNumber of \ncities with \ntop\u00a0universities\n\nNumber of cities \nin sample\n\nCountry\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nPakistan\n\nPhilippines\n\nPRC\n\nThailand\n\nViet Nam\n\nTotal \n\n\u2002\u20026\n\n\u200264\n\n\u200222\n\n\u200225\n\n\u200222\n\n\u2002\u20026\n\n\u200278\n\n\u200218\n\n\u2002\u20027\n\n248\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: Chen, Hasan, and Jiang, forthcoming.\n\n\u20021\n\n43\n\n\u20029\n\n10\n\n\u20025\n\n\u20022\n\n17\n\n\u20027\n\n\u20025\n\n99\n\n\u200211\n\n207\n\n\u200240\n\n\u200225\n\n\u200211\n\n\u200211\n\n\u200274\n\n\u200220\n\n\u200217\n\n416\n\nSecondly, universities are unevenly distributed across cities \nwithin a single country, more so in some countries than \nin others. Analysis found that 14 of the 25 top universities \nin Malaysia are located in Kuala Lumpur, and 12 of the\u00a018 \nin\u00a0Thailand are located in Bangkok, making them the second- \nand third-ranked cities with the most top universities in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia (after\u00a0Beijing, which hosts 20 of the 78 \ntop\u00a0universities in the PRC). By\u00a0contrast, concentration is \nless\u00a0intense in India, whose 64\u00a0top universities are distributed \nacross 43 cities, the greatest concentration being 7 universities \nin Delhi. \n\nHigh concentrations of both universities and firm \n\ninnovation suggest correlation. To investigate whether firms \nlocated in cities with a large presence of top universities are \nmore likely to innovate, a logit model was adopted with firm \ninnovation activity as the dependent variable and a university \ndummy as the main explanatory variable. To account for the \nfact that cities with large populations and amenities tend \nto be ideal location choices for both innovative firms and \nuniversities, the model controlled for city characteristics \nincluding population, temperature, and other geographic \nfactors. In addition, it controlled for fixed effects and firm \ncharacteristics that could affect innovation behavior. \n\nResults showed that correlation between innovation and \nthe presence of top universities was positive and significant. \nThe odds that firms innovate in new production processes \nwere 72% higher in cities with at least one top university than \nfor firms in cities without any top universities (Table\u00a02.4.3). \n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)115\n\nTable 2.4.3\u2002Firm performance and top university presence\n\nVariables\n\nTop university\n\nFirm characteristics\n\nCity characteristics\n\nSector/year/country FE\n\nObservations\n\nNumber of cities\n\nF statistic\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nProcess Innovation\n\nProduct Innovation\n\n1.72***\n(0.14)\n\n1.6***\n(0.134)\n\n1.77***\n(0.164)\n\n2.11***\n(0.302)\n\n1.99***\n(0.187)\n\n1.96***\n(0.181)\n\n1.71***\n(0.182)\n\n1.32*\n(0.193)\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n20,578\n\n20,374\n\n20,374\n\n20,374\n\n21,741\n\n21,496\n\n21,496\n\n21,496\n\n483\n\n44.08\n\n483\n\n45.64\n\n483\n\n29.54\n\n483\n\n27.54\n\n489\n\n54.55\n\n489\n\n24.54\n\n489\n\n20.15\n\n489\n\n17.80\n\n* = p<0.1, ** = p<0.05, *** = p<0.01, FE = fixed effects.\nNotes: Robust standard errors clustered by country are in parentheses.

The positive effect of top universities on process \ninnovation was even more pronounced after controlling \nfor city characteristics, indicating that firms in cities with \ntop\u00a0university presence were twice as likely to undertake \nprocess innovation than were firms in cities without any \ntop\u00a0university. For product innovation, the correlation was \nsmaller, with 30% greater likelihood of innovation, but \nremained significantly positive.\n\nTo conclude, both firm innovation and quality were highly \nconcentrated spatially in particular cities. Firms in cities with \ntop university presence were more likely to innovate new \nproducts and processes. Holding everything else constant, \nfirms in cities with university presence were 111% more likely \nto undertake process innovation, and 32% more likely to \nundertake product innovation. Additional analysis indicated \nthat greater top university presence is related to a higher \nlikelihood of process innovation by local firms.\n\n\f116(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nToward a more innovative Asia\n\nInnovation is an indispensable ingredient of economic growth \nand contributes greatly to improving the quality of life. \nFurther, innovation brings a tireless parade of new technologies \nthat improve on and replace old technologies. Currently, the \nFourth Industrial Revolution, epitomized by revolutionary \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous \nvehicles, robotics, nanotechnology, and 3-D printing, is creating \na palpable sense of excitement. For developing Asia, the current \nmoment is especially opportune for examining the relationship \nbetween innovation and development. The region needs more \nand better innovation both to sustain growth by fostering \nproductivity and to improve the quality of growth by making it \nmore inclusive and sustainable.\n\nIt may seem that innovation and its impact on growth \nand development are relevant mostly to relatively advanced \neconomies. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nInnovation is not limited to momentous new technologies \nthat push the global technology frontier. Much of innovation \nis incremental and marginal, which may be less glamorous \nthan self-driving cars but no less important for growth and \nthe quality of life. Encouragingly, the evidence suggests that \nfirms in less developed countries in the region are already \ndoing plenty of such innovation. Further, ICT is opening up \nplenty of opportunities for innovative entrepreneurship in \ncountries at all income levels. One prime example is Indonesia\u2019s \nGojek, which started out as a motorbike taxi-hailing service \nbut, in\u00a02017 and again in 2019, joined the Fortune list of \n50\u00a0Companies that Changed the World.\n\nMore generally, new technologies, most notably ICT, can \nenable less developed countries to leapfrog from obsolete to \nmore advanced technologies by, for example, skipping over \nfixed-line phones by going straight to mobiles. This suggests \nthat they can advance toward the global technology frontier in \nrelatively short order. But leapfrogging remains a contentious \nissue, and it obscures the much bigger point: the need to get \nthe basics right. As stated above, there is no shortcut to an \ninnovative economy and society, no escaping the need to satisfy \nbasic prerequisites for an innovative economy. For\u00a0example, \nthe exciting opportunities for innovation that ICT presents, \nespecially for creative business models tailored to the local \ncontext, can never be realized without good ICT infrastructure, \nan enabling regulatory environment, and a workforce with \nsolid numeracy and literacy, including digital\u00a0literacy.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)117\n\nThe first step on the journey to an innovative society \nmust be to nurture a workforce that is capable of absorbing \nand utilizing more advanced technology from more advanced \neconomies. This is what the NIEs did and what any aspiring \neconomy must do. In addition to the NIE experience, growing \ninnovative prowess in Viet Nam, where the education \nsystem produces superior learning outcomes as measured by \nProgramme for International Student Assessment tests, attests \nto the central importance of human capital in innovation. \nA\u00a0top\u00a0priority in this regard is to build on basic education by \ncreating a conducive entrepreneurial ecosystem that allows \ninnovative entrepreneurs to flourish.\n\nThe education system must guarantee good basic learning \n\noutcomes. Despite stories about entrepreneurs dropping out \nof school to succeed beyond imagination, it is a pipe dream to \nthink that individuals without basic literacy and numeracy can \nbecome innovators. The prerequisite of an education system that \ncan produce a large pool of innovators is to get the basics right. \nAlthough some economies in developing\u00a0Asia excel at delivering \nstrong learning outcomes, others do not. In\u00a0economies that\u00a0fail, \neducation must be reformed thoroughly with the objective \nof dramatically improving the quality of basic education. \nStrong\u00a0basic education is one thing no country can leapfrog past \nbecause even the most creative thinkers need it.\n\nA focus on learners nurtures innovators, as does an optimal \nskills mix. A growing body of robust evidence demonstrates that \nlearner-centered approaches are superior to teacher-centered \nones. Asian countries should therefore consider shifting their \nteaching practices to more student-centric approaches that \nencourage students to think for themselves. While the STEM \nquartet of science, technology, engineering, and math is certainly \nimportant for innovation, so are other subjects that develop \ncreativity, such as art and design, or critical thinking, such as \nsocial science and humanities. In fact, individuals commanding a \nmix of disparate skills are key to driving innovation.\n\nHigh-quality, innovative entrepreneurship needs favorable \n\ninstitutions. New entrepreneurial businesses constitute a \npotent force driving countries\u2019 productivity and innovation, \nparticularly now in the digital age. This effect operates through \nbusiness model innovation that challenges established industry \nincumbents. The evidence broadly indicates that strong property \nrights, impartial rule of law, and simplified entry regulations \npromote high-quality entrepreneurship. On\u00a0the other hand, \na high incidence of informal, unregistered businesses deters \ninnovative businesses through potentially unfair competition. \nThis suggests that fair competition and, more broadly, \npolicies to promote competition can also promote innovative \nentrepreneurship (Box 2.5.1). National policy should focus on \nbuilding high-quality institutions and a smooth regulatory \nregime to encourage more innovative formal entrepreneurship.\n\n\f118(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nBox 2.5.1\u2002Competition and innovation: evidence from the Republic of Korea\n\nThe quintessential example of a transition from an \neconomic model based on investment to one based on \ninnovation is the Republic of Korea (ROK). The\u00a0ROK \nsuccessfully leveraged an investment model until \nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998. From\u00a01963 \nto 1997, GDP per capita in the ROK grew at an \naverage rate of 7% per year. The pre-crisis model \nwas structured around large conglomerates, called \nchaebols. The\u00a0government supported chaebols through \nvarious means, providing preferential access to credit \nand bailout guarantees, and restricting domestic and \nforeign competition.\n\nWhile this model delivered impressive results, the \nAsian financial crisis undermined the legitimacy of the \nmodel and opened the way for reform. Reform to favor \ncompetition had already been discussed, but without \nthe catalyst of the crisis. The ROK undertook sweeping \nreform, restructuring inefficient chaebols and removing \nentry barriers for competitors and foreign investors. \nThe anti-trust agency strengthened enforcement, \npushing the number of corrective orders up by \nthreefold and financial penalties for anticompetitive \nbehavior up by a factor of 25. Foreign\u00a0direct\u00a0investment \nquadrupled from the equivalent of 0.5% of GDP to 2%. \nPro-competitive reform opened the economy to \n\ncompetition. This revived economic growth, now \ndriven by innovation rather than factor accumulation. \nIn early 1990s, the ROK filed only an eighth as many \npatent applications with the US Patent and Trademark \nOffice as did Germany. In 2012, it overtook a larger \nunited Germany in terms of US patent applications \nand, in 2015, filed 30% more of them.\n\nHow did this transformation take place? Aghion, \n\nGuriev, and Jo (2019) undertook granular analysis \nof data from firms, using the censuses of ROK \nmanufacturing firms in 1992 and 2003\u2014before and \nafter the 1998 reform\u2014to analyze firm dynamics in \nindustries formerly dominated by chaebols.\n\nThe results are consistent with the predictions of \nthe Schumpeterian growth paradigm, which states that \ndifferent types of institutions and policies promote \ngrowth at different stages of development. Before the \ncrisis, total factor productivity (TFP) was stagnating \nor even falling, especially among chaebols. But after \nreform, rapid TFP growth resumed in both chaebols \nand independent firms (box figure). TFP growth \nwas especially impressive in industries previously \ndominated by chaebols and thus most affected by \nreform. In those industries, firms outside of chaebols \nexperienced notably rapid productivity growth. \nFurther, the entry of these firms increased significantly \nin all industries after reform. \n\nData from firms on patenting activity confirm \nthat reform promoted innovation, especially among \nindependent firms. Before the crisis, chaebol firms had \nslightly faster growth in patent applications per year \nthan their independent counterparts. However, after \nthe crisis, the number of chaebol firm applications \nstopped growing, while patenting by independent \nfirms accelerated. \n\nAll in all, the ROK experience suggests that fair \ncompetition and competition policy can facilitate a \ntransition from growth led by investment to that led \nby innovation. This holds valuable lessons for the PRC \nand other middle-income Asian economies.\n\nLogarithm of total factor productivity in chaebol and independent firms in industries with high, low, and zero chaebol share\n\nHigh chaebol share industries\n\nLow chaebol share industries\n\nZero chaebol share industries\n\nLog TFP, Chaebol Firms\n\nLog TFP, Non-Chaebol Firms\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\nYear\n\nYear\n\nTFP = total factor productivity.\nNotes: The \ufb01gures are logarithms of average TFP in each industry after winsorizing the top and bottom 1% for the whole sample period in each industry category. \nIndustries are classi\ufb01ed by the average 1992\u20131997 chaebol share: high (above the 1992\u20131997 median of 20%), low (below median), and zero. Industry-level log TFPs \nare normalized by the 1992\u20131997 average = 0.\nSource: Aghion, Guriev, and Jo (2019).\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)119\n\nDigital entrepreneurs need better policies nationally \nand across the region. The focus regionally should be on \nnurturing and facilitating regional entrepreneurial ecosystems. \nKey principles include the following: (i) Adopt a bottom\u2013up, \nfacilitative approach, as opposed to a top\u2013down, hierarchical \napproach. (ii) Seek close engagement with all stakeholders. \n(iii)\u00a0Nurture close communities of entrepreneurs, accelerators, \nfinanciers, large businesses, mentors, public agencies, \neducational institutions, and regional agencies by serving as \na secretariat. (iv)\u00a0Sponsor open interaction and knowledge \nsharing among entrepreneurs regarding their business model \nexperiments by promoting networking platforms. (v) Encourage \nactive public\u2013private interactions through systematic and \ninstitutionalized dialogue.\n\nAlthough individual creativity and ingenuity are undeniably \n\nvital elements in the process, innovation occurs not in a \nvacuum but within institutions. Three key elements of an \ninnovation architecture are intellectual property rights, \nan efficient financial system, and urban innovation hubs. \nGiven the heterogeneity of Asian economies in terms of their \ninnovation capacity and stage of development, the appropriate \nnational innovation system will necessarily differ from country \nto country.\n\nDifferent types of IPR serve better at different stages of \ndevelopment. There are four types of IPR: design, trademark, \npatents on core technologies, and utility or petite patents \non incremental improvements. In the ROK, petite patents \nand trademarks initially provided the biggest impetus to \nfirm growth, with design assuming a bigger role during the \nsubsequent catch-up phase. As the ROK transformed itself into \nglobal innovation leader, patents became prominent. Therefore, \nnot only patents but also design protection and trademarks can \nbe effective forms of IPR. The ROK experience strengthens the \ncase for a nuanced approach to IPR policy. \n\nEquity and other capital markets are key to financing \n\ninnovation. Analysis of industry-level patent data from \n47\u00a0economies in 1997\u20132016 reveals that financial structures \nmatter disproportionately to innovation. More precisely, both \nequity and debt markets have positive and significant effects on \nR&D efficiency, as measured by the number of patents granted, \nbut capital markets also have a positive and significant effect \non innovation quality. The effect is more pronounced and \nrobust for equity markets. The obvious implication for Asian \neconomies is to continue to develop their capital markets.\nEvidence reconfirms the importance of cities as \n\nengines of innovation. Innovation tends to be concentrated \nin relatively few cities that serve as innovation hubs. \nAcross\u00a0Asia, the spatial concentration of innovation can be \nseen in product innovation, process innovation, and R&D. \nIn\u00a0addition, firms in larger cities tend to be more innovative. \n\n\f120(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nEven\u00a0after\u00a0accounting\u00a0for\u00a0potential\u00a0endogeneity, city size \nhas a significant effect on innovative activity. Finally, the \npresence and number of top-tier universities in a city seems to \nhave a positive impact on the propensity of the city\u2019s firms to \npursue\u00a0innovation. This finding underlines the importance of \nhigh-quality education in promoting innovation. \n\nInstitutions and policy must evolve with economic \n\ndevelopment. Each country has a unique national innovation \nsystem to cope with market failures and complement \nits successes according to its innovation capability. \nWhile\u00a0such\u00a0systems may have served innovation well in the \npast, they may stop doing so as a country\u2019s capability matures. \nThe\u00a0government should play a direct and leading role in the \nnational innovation system at early stages of development \nbut only an indirect and supportive role when the private \nsector assumes a bigger role. Yet, evidence is mixed at best \non how effective activist innovation policy is. The subsidies \nof Innofund, a PRC government fund dedicated to supporting \ntechnology-based small and medium-sized enterprises, seem \nto have only a limited effect on innovative output (Li, Liu, \nand Gentile, forthcoming). This highlights that government \nintervention needs to be nuanced.\n\nBeyond ensuring an enabling environment, governments \n\ncan catalyze. Governments play a major direct role in \ninnovation, accounting for a substantial share of R&D. \nThe\u00a0government share of economy-wide R&D from 1996 \nto 2017 was 24% in the ROK, 23% in the PRC, and 42% in \nViet\u00a0Nam. Government R&D tends to carry out basic research \nwith large potential for spillover, while private sector \nresearch centers on commercial applications (Bernanke 2011). \nThe\u00a0internet is a classic example. Although much of the basic \ntechnology came from government laboratories, the countless \ninnovations it\u00a0spawned and made the internet what it is \ncame predominantly from the private sector. Plenty of scope \nexists for innovation within the public sector to improve the \nproducts and processes offered by governments. Public sector \ninnovation labs such as those in Armenia and Sri Lanka can \npromote experimentation and openness to new approaches \n(Roth,\u00a0Mohamed Asmi, and Husar,\u00a0forthcoming).\n\nFinally, there are no short cuts to the creation of an \ninnovative society. The task is a long-term commitment \nrequiring a lot of hard work. Similarly, education systems \nthat aim to nurture innovation cannot leapfrog the stage of \ninstilling strong basic skills, notably literacy and numeracy. \nHowever, Asia\u2019s past record and robust fundamentals suggest \nthat it can and will dedicate the time and effort it takes to \nbecome a more innovative region.\n\n\fWhat drives innovation in Asia?(cid:16)(cid:16)121\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nFirst published in 1992, the Oslo Manual is the international \nreference guide for collecting and using data on innovation. \nThe most recent edition, published in 2018, considers \na broader range of innovation-related phenomena and \nthe experience gained from recent rounds of innovation \nsurveys in member countries of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and \npartner economies and organizations.\nAn increase in one input while holding other inputs \nconstant will initially increase output but then will generate \nlower returns per unit the more that one input is increased. \nIn other words, increasing one factor of production while \nkeeping the other factors constant is not productive past a \ncertain point.\nMost surveys that collect data on innovation, including \nthe World Bank Enterprise Survey, are based on the \nOslo\u00a0Manual. The Oslo Manual 2005 divides innovation \ninto four main subtypes: (i) Product innovation is \nthe introduction of a good or service that is new or \nsignificantly improved with respect to its characteristics or \nintended\u00a0uses. (ii) Process innovation is the implementation \nof a new or significantly improved production\u00a0or delivery \nmethod. (iii) Marketing innovation is the implementation \nof a new method of distribution involving\u00a0significant \nchanges in product design or packaging, placement, \npromotion, or\u00a0pricing. (iv) Organizational innovation is the \nimplementation of new firm business practices, workplace \narrangements, or external\u00a0relations.\nFive countries in the Pacific\u2014Fiji, Micronesia, Samoa, \nTonga, and Vanuatu\u2014are excluded from innovation \nvariables for lack of data.\nThese terms follow Rosing et al.

Lower  import  costs  kept \ninflation subdued, and fiscal and current account deficits narrowed. Growth is projected \nto  ease  in  2020  amid  adverse  effects  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak  but  recover  in  2021. \nInflation  and  the  current  account  deficit  are  expected  to  rise  slightly  in  2020  before \nmoderating in 2021. Boosting public investment is essential for inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth accelerated from 5.2% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2019 on strong \ngains in services, industry, and private consumption. \n\nOn the supply side, growth accelerated in industry and \nservices but not in agriculture. Growth in industry including \nconstruction almost doubled from 4.4% in 2018 to 8.6% as \nmining and quarrying recovered from a slump in 2018 and \nexpanded by 21.3%. Manufacturing rose by 12.0% on continued \ngains in processed foods, beverages, tobacco, textiles, and \nnonferrous metal products. Construction grew by 4.2%, \nreflecting higher fixed investment, both public and private. \nGrowth in services edged up from 9.4% in 2018 to 10.1% with \ngains in all subsectors but led by double-digit growth in finance, \ninsurance, health care, recreation, accommodation, and food \nservices. Adverse weather caused agriculture to contract in 2019 \nfor a fourth consecutive year, by 4.0% (Figure 3.1.1). \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption underpinned \n\nthe expansion while net exports dragged on growth, as \ndid investment including changes in inventories. Private \nconsumption grew by 12.7%, supported by recovering consumer \nconfidence, higher consumer lending, and wage increases for \nselected categories of public employees. Public consumption \nwas flat, in line with the government\u2019s conservative fiscal \nstance. Investment declined by 5.2% in 2019 as a 34.3% \nplunge in inventories offset a 4.7% rise in gross fixed capital \nformation. Exports grew at a faster rate than imports.\n\n Easing global food prices, lower import costs, and a stable \nexchange rate trimmed average annual inflation from 2.5% in \n2018 to 1.4%. Price rises for food slowed from 2.5% in 2018 to \n2.1%, for other goods from 4.5% to 1.5%, and for services from \n1.2% to 0.5%.

The central bank \nrelaxed its policy rate by 25 basis points in January 2019 to \n5.75% and again in September 2019 to 5.50%. Broad money \ngrowth accelerated from 7.4% in 2018 to 11.2% last year as \na rise in net domestic assets outpaced a drop in net foreign \nassets (Figure 3.1.3). Net domestic assets benefitted from an \n18.5% rise in credit driven by higher mortgage and consumer \nlending. The decline in net foreign assets came as those held by \ncommercial banks fell by 35.2%, more than offsetting a 39.4% \nrise in net foreign assets held by the central bank. A relatively \nstable exchange rate and attractive terms for deposits and loans \nin local currency helped reduce the share of foreign currency \nloans from 56.0% at the end of 2018 to 50.9% a year later, and \nthat of foreign currency deposits from 60.4% to 57.6%. \n\nFiscal consolidation continued in 2019. The budget deficit \n\nnarrowed from 1.8% of GDP in 2018 to 1.0%, well below \nthe 2.5% target. Higher economic growth, improved tax \nadministration, and increased nontax revenue lifted revenue \nby 16.2% to equal 23.8% of GDP. Expenditure grew at a lower \nrate of 12.2% to the equivalent of 24.8% of GDP, reflecting \nefforts to rationalize current spending and capital outlays that \nunderperformed expectations. Capital expenditure was about \n15% below target but nevertheless grew by 23.3% to equal 2.8% \nof GDP (Figure 3.1.4). \n\nThe ratio of public debt to GDP declined for a second \n\nconsecutive year, from 55.8% at the end of 2018 to 53.6% a \nyear later, as GDP growth outpaced a rise in debt (Figure \n3.1.5). External public debt grew by 4.5% to $5.8 billion, equal \nto 44.2% of GDP, while domestic public debt rose by 10.9% to \n$1.5 billion. In September 2019, Armenia successfully issued its \nthird round of eurobonds, which totaled $500 million and had a \n10-year maturity with annual interest at 4.2%. This allowed the \nredemption of $403 million from its first eurobond issue, in 2015. \n\nA smaller trade deficit in goods, relatively stable net \ntrade in services, and a moderate rise in remittances helped \nnarrow the current account deficit from the equivalent of \n9.4% of GDP in 2018 to an estimated 8.0% in 2019 (Figure \n3.1.6). The merchandise trade deficit narrowed from 14.4% of \nGDP in 2018 to 14.0% in 2019 as exports grew by an estimated \n9.7%, reflecting gains in agriculture, processed foods, other \nmanufactures, and minerals. Import growth moderated to 8.5% \nas lower imports of investment goods partly offset much higher \nvehicle imports. The services deficit narrowed, reflecting gains \nin finance and travel-related services.\n\nGross international reserves rose by 25.7% to an all-time \n\nhigh of $2.84 billion at the end of 2019, or cover for 4.9 \n\nFigure   3.1.3\u2002 Contributions to broad money \n\ngrowth\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet foreign assets \nof central bank\n\nNet foreign assets \nof deposit organizations\nNet claims on \ncentral government\nCredit to the economy\nOther items (net)\n\nPercentage points\n\nBroad money\n(M2X) growth\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Central Bank of Armenia. http://www.cba.am \n(accessed 25 February 2020).\n\nFigure   3.1.4\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\nBalance\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance. http://www.min\ufb01n.am; \nStatistical Committee of Armenia. http://www.armstat.am \n(accessed 25 February 2020).\n\nFigure   3.1.5\u2002 Public debt\n\n% of GDP\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance. http://www.min\ufb01n.am; \nStatistical Committee of Armenia. http://www.armstat.am \n(accessed 25 February 2020).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nArmenia\u2002\u2002137\n\nmonths of imports, on the combined effects of the improved \ntrade position, eurobond issuance, central bank purchases of \nforeign exchange, and public borrowing.

Industry including construction is \nprojected to grow by 1.4% in 2020 and 4.0% in 2021, supported \nby further expansion in manufacturing and in particular food \nprocessing, while expansion in mining and quarrying should \nmoderate following the strong recovery in 2019. Agriculture is \nprojected to rebound by 1.8% in 2020 and accelerate to 2.6% in \n2021, assuming favorable weather and continued government \nefforts to promote productivity and modernization through \nsubsidized loans and the introduction of crop insurance. \nConstruction is projected to expand by 3.3% in 2020 and \n4.8% in 2021 on further construction by households and \nhigher public investment. Growth in services is expected to \nmoderate to 2.6% in 2020 and before edging up to 5.6% in 2021, \nsupported mainly by finance and information technology. \nOn the demand side, consumption and investment will \n\nlead growth. Expansion in private consumption is expected \nat 3.9% in 2020 and 5.9% in 2021, supported by minimum \nwage and pension increases in January 2020, higher bank \ncredit, a moderate rise in remittances, further improvements \nin consumer sentiment, and the introduction in January 2020 \nof lower personal income tax at a flat rate of 23%, falling to \n22% in 2021. With higher spending for social services, public \nconsumption is expected to rebound in 2020 and accelerate \nslightly in 2021. Investment is also forecast to recover and \ngrow by 2.1% in 2020 and 2021, benefitting from higher \ninfrastructure spending, a cut in the profit tax rate from 20% \nto 18%, and simpler taxation of small firms. \n\nMonetary policy is expected to remain broadly \n\naccommodative.

Inflation is seen \nslowing to 2.2% in 2021. The 12-month inflation rate December \nto December is expected to remain within the central bank \ntarget band of 2.5%\u20135.5% at least to the end of 2021. \n\nHigher growth, a smaller budget deficit, and a lower ratio \n\nof debt to GDP in 2019 allowed the budget to become mildly \nexpansionary in 2020, before likely returning to a more neutral \nstance in 2021. The 2020 budget projects a fiscal deficit equal \nto 2.3% of GDP, with revenue rising to 23.9% of GDP and \nexpenditure to 26.2%. Tax revenue is projected to rise by \n9.5% to reach 22.6% of GDP as further improvements in tax \nadministration, simplified tax procedures, and a wider tax base \noffset the effects of cutting corporate profit and personal tax \nrates and raising the threshold for taxing small and medium-\nsized enterprises. Public debt will likely decline to equal \n50%\u201353% of GDP. \n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to widen to the \nequivalent of 8.6% of GDP in 2020 and narrow to 8.2% in 2021 \n(Figure 3.1.9). The merchandise trade deficit is seen widening \nto 14.6% of GDP in 2020 before narrowing to 14.2% in 2021, \nreflecting only a modest rise in domestic demand, the waning \neffects of higher vehicle reexports, higher import tariffs, and \na possible rise in the price of imported natural gas, offset \npartly by higher agricultural and mining exports. Merchandise \nexports are projected rising by 2.5% in 2020 and 7.5% in 2021, \nwith imports rising by 7.5% and 6.5%, respectively. Services are \nlikely to remain broadly unchanged, though with rising receipts \nfrom finance and from information and technology services. \nRemittances inflows can also be affected by slower growth \nprospects in Russian Federation amid decreasing oil prices. \nPublic and publicly guaranteed external debt is projected to \ndecrease slightly to the equivalent of 48.5% of GDP at the end \nof 2020 and 46.8% a year later.\n\nArmenia\u2019s major trading partners are likely to be adversely \naffected by recent developments in the global economy, including \nthe spread of COVID 19 and the sharp decline of global oil \nprices. These pose a risk to Armenia\u2019s economic outlook.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014boosting capital \nexpenditure for inclusive and  \nsustainable growth\nArmenia\u2019s upgraded fiscal framework in 2017 helped rebuild \nfiscal space while allowing higher capital spending during the \npast 3 years, which raised capital outlays from the equivalent \nof 2.5% of GDP in 2018 to 2.8% in 2019 and a projected 4.5% \nin 2020. However, capital spending fell short of its target in \n2018 and 2019 and, as a percentage of GDP, remains below the \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nArmenia\u2002\u2002139\n\naverage for upper-middle income countries. Moreover, with \ncapital outlays at less than 5.0% of GDP since 2012, the public \ncapital stock, or the value of government-owned assets, is \nestimated to have fallen by two-thirds, from the equivalent of \n160% of GDP in 2000 to 62% in 2017. While expenditure under-\nexecution can reduce public debt and deficits in the short \nrun, in the long run the under-execution of capital spending \nimposes a limit on a country\u2019s production capacity and growth \npotential. Thus, boosting capital expenditure through a sound \nprocess of public investment management is important. \n\nIn a 2019 assessment of public investment management, the \n\nInternational Monetary Fund concluded that, while Armenia \nperforms well in its adherence to fiscal rules, its budget \ncomprehensiveness, and the availability of funding, it lags in \nproject appraisal, budgeting for investment, project selection, \nand performance across the project cycle. Thus, boosting \ncapacity to plan, prioritize, and implement well-targeted capital \nspending is critical. The assessment proposed a two-stage \ngateway for project planning. The first gateway reviews project \nproposals before they are submitted to the cabinet, and the \nsecond gateway requires further review and full appraisal of \ncleared flagship projects. \n\nPlanning is important to ensure that each project\u2019s \nobjectives align with national strategic priorities. To this \nend, the government has started preparing its Armenia \nTransformation Strategy 2050 to provide an overarching \nnational strategy for five areas\u2014infrastructure, human capital, \nfinance and the economy, public administration, and justice\u2014\nand 16 sectors, with closely aligned medium-term budgeting.\nAllocating public investment to the most productive \nprojects is a key concern. To streamline and maximize \nefficiency in appraising and selecting projects, the government \nestablished in 2019 a public investment unit in the Ministry of \nEconomy. Guidelines for appraising planned projects through \ncost\u2013benefit analysis and in terms of cost-effectiveness are to \nbe introduced in 2020.\n\nAnother problem is substantial bunching of expenditure \nat the end of the year, especially for foreign-financed projects, \nwhich is a contributing cause of underspending. Addressing \nthis problem requires continued capacity development in \nproject executing and implementing agencies to better satisfy \nthe procedures and policies required by development partners \nregarding procurement, contract management, and financial \nreporting. \n\nAll of these reforms should be considered parts of a \n\nbroader effort to improve public financial management. Strong \nimplementation of reform is thus important, as envisaged by \nthe Public Financial Management Reform Strategy for 2019\u2013\n2023, approved in November 2019.\n\n\fAzerbaijan\n\nFiscal  stimulus  and  higher  gas  production  lifted  growth  in  2019  as  food  prices  boosted \ninflation. Lower oil prices narrowed the current account surplus. A further decline amid the \nCOVID-19  outbreak  will  slash  growth  in  2020  despite  higher  public  spending,  with  growth \nrecovering in 2021. Inflation is forecast to slow before it accelerates in 2021 as growth picks \nup.  The  current  account  surplus  will  narrow  in  2020  with  lower  oil  prices  and  then  widen \nin  2021  as  oil  prices  recover.  The  government  needs  to  allocate  spending  more  efficiently.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth accelerated from 1.4% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2019, with \n3.5% expansion in the three-fifths of the economy outside \nof the large petroleum industry (Figure 3.2.1). Petroleum \nexpanded by 0.4% as the Shah Deniz II field spurred a 27.7% \nrise in gas production, which offset a 3.3% decline in oil output \nattributable to maintenance at the Central Azeri oil field in \nApril and the West Chirag field in October. \n\nOn the supply side, industry reversed an average decline \nof 2.9% in 2015\u20132018 with 0.7% growth as all subsectors grew \nexcept construction, which contracted by 6.1% because of lower \npublic investment and the completion of major petroleum \nprojects. Growth in agriculture rose from 4.6% in 2018 to \n7.3%, led by an 11.7% rise in crops, mainly cereals and cotton, \nsupported by continued exemptions from taxes and duties on \nproduction inputs. Services, supplying 37% of GDP, grew by \n3.7% on gains in trade, communications, and tourism, with the \nnumber of tourists rising by 11.3%. \n\nexpanded. Private consumption benefited from rising incomes \nas salaries and pensions increased, as well as increased \nconsumer lending, while public wage increases boosted public \nconsumption. Gross fixed capital formation declined by 2.3% as \npublic investment in the petroleum industry fell.\n\nAverage annual inflation increased from 2.3% in 2018 to \n\n2.6% as prices rose by 3.8% for food, 1.2% for other goods, \nand 2.0% for services (Figure 3.2.2).

A\u00a0stable exchange rate, pegged at 1.7 Azeri manats per \n$1 since 2017, has helped keep inflation moderate, though the \naverage real effective exchange rate appreciated slightly in 2019 \n(Figure\u00a03.3.3).\n\nAs inflation remained within the central bank\u2019s target band \nof 2%\u20136%, the central bank reduced the policy rate from 9.75% \nto 7.50% in eight steps during 2019. Despite some decrease, \ndollarization in the banking sector remains high, with nearly \n34.6% of loans and 61.0% of deposits in foreign currency. \nDollarization and a shallow domestic capital market continue \nto constrain monetary policy. Credit growth accelerated from \n10.7% in 2018 to 17.5%, with loans to households rising by 31.2% \nto reach 45.6% of all lending. Broad money growth accelerated \nfrom 5.7% in the whole of 2018 to 11.1% in the 11 months from \nJanuary to November 2019 (Figure 3.2.4). The government\u2019s \nefforts to resolve nonperforming loans by paying down some \noverdue household loans helped cut the share of nonperforming \nloans from 12.1% in 2019 to 8.2%. Nevertheless, the banking \nsector remains weak, and the country\u2019s largest bank, the state-\nowned International Bank of Azerbaijan, does not yet appear \nready for privatization despite extensive restructuring. \n\nFiscal policy remained somewhat expansionary during \n\n2019. The budget deficit narrowed slightly from 0.4% of \nGDP in 2018 to 0.3%, but the deficit excluding transfers \nfrom SOFAZ remained large at 14.2% of GDP (Figure 3.2.5). \nCentral government outlays grew from 28.5% of GDP in 2018 \nto 29.9% as the government raised public sector wages and \nthe national minimum salary and compensated household \nborrowers to offset the impact of past devaluations. Improved \ntax administration helped raise revenue from 28.1% of GDP \nin 2018 to 29.6%. The government also moved to strengthen \nfiscal sustainability and reduce dependence on oil revenue by \nimplementing a new fiscal rule requiring the non-oil primary \ndeficit to decline as a percentage of GDP from 31.1% in 2019 to \n28.1% in 2022. \n\nThe current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed \n\nfrom 12.9% of GDP in 2018 to 7.3%. The trade surplus shrank \nfrom $9.6 billion a year earlier to $5.8 billion, while imported \nconstruction and transportation expanded the services deficit. \nMerchandize exports, of which hydrocarbons represent \nnearly 90%, reversed a 31.2% rise in 2018 to decline by 4.2% \nas oil export earnings fell, though non-oil exports increased \nmarginally. Higher aggregate demand boosted merchandise \nimports by 24.8%. Net foreign direct investment in first 9 \nmonths of 2019 plunged by 70% to $304 million, with most \ninvestment in petroleum. The official foreign exchange reserves \nof the central bank rose by 12.5% to a record high of $6.3 billion. \nStrategic reserves including SOFAZ assets totaled an estimated \n$49 billion at the end of 2019, with external public debt \n\nFigure 3.2.3\u2002Inflation and exchange rate\n\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nMonthly average\nexchange rate\n\n% change year on year\n\nManat/$\n\nJan\n2015\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nState\u00a0Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan; \nHaver Analytics.\n\nFigure   3.2.4\u2002 Contributions to money \n\nsupply growth\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet claims on the government\nCredit to the rest of the economy\nNet other items\nBroad money (M3) growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n-1.1\n\n-2.0\n\n9.0\n\n5.7\n\n11.1\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nNote: For 2019 data is as of November 2019.\nSource: Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nFigure   3.2.5\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n2.4\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2015\n\n2017\nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n\f142(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nestimated at $9.1 billion (Figure 3.2.6).

A decline in oil prices, amid the COVID-19 \noutbreak, will slash growth to 0.5% in 2020. A recovery in \nprices and higher oil and gas production are projected to raise \ngrowth to 1.5% in 2021 (Figure 3.2.7). Expansion in industry, \nprojected at 0.5% in 2020 and 2.0% in 2021, will come from \nstronger hydrocarbon performance, in particular higher \noutput at the Shah Deniz II gas field with the completion in \n2020 of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline to carry gas from Turkey \nto Italy. Growth in agriculture is expected to slow to 4.5% \nin 2020 and 4.0% in 2021, though continued subsidies for \nimports of fertilizer and seed should promote higher cash crop \nproduction. Services are expected to show little growth in \n2020 as the COVID-19 outbreak hits tourism and retail trade, \nbut they will expand by 1.0% in 2021 as the economy improves. \nOn the demand side, higher civil service income will fuel \npublic consumption, and a 34% increase in minimum salaries \nshould boost private consumption. Investment is expected to \nslow in 2020 as low oil income cuts public investment before \nstabilizing in 2021 as private investment picks up. Strong gas \noutput will strengthen net exports, supporting growth. \n\nFiscal policy is expected to become more expansionary in \n2020 with the budget deficit rising to at least 3.4% of GDP\u2014or \n17.2% when excluding transfers from SOFAZ\u2014as higher social \nspending and continued strong public investment boost total \nexpenditure by 10.2%. The government has budgeted AZN1.0 \nbillion to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic \nstability, the labor market, and entrepreneurship. It will approve \ncriteria to support the private sector. The budget originally \nprojected revenue, including transfers from SOFAZ, equal to \n29.4% of GDP in 2020, based on an assumed oil price of $55 \nper barrel. Actual revenue could be lower if March 2020 oil \nprices persist for the rest of the year. With changes in the tax \ncode expanding tax collections, transfers from SOFAZ were \noriginally projected to cover 47% of revenue in 2020 and 45% in \n2021. The government projected SOFAZ to receive $12.4 billion \nin revenue from export earnings in 2020, of which 91% would \nbe transferred to the budget. \n\nInflation is projected to decelerate slightly, to 2.5% in 2020, \non sluggish economic activity, and increase to 3.5% in 2021 with \nthe lagged impact of higher social spending to expand private \nconsumption (Figure 3.2.8).

A prolonged decline in \npetroleum prices may trigger exchange rate adjustments and a \nsurge in inflation, as occurred in 2016. Nevertheless, as current \nand forecast inflation remain within the target band of 2%\u20136% \n(4\u00b12%), the central bank reduced the policy rate again in \nJanuary 2020, to 7.25%. Further relaxation of monetary policy \nis possible if the exchange rate remains stable, though regulated \ninterest rates would likely contribute to faster credit growth. \nThe central bank will continue its auctions of deposits and notes \nto stabilize the monetary base, contain currency in circulation, \nand avoid creating downward pressure on the exchange rate, \nthus delaying any move toward a floating rate regime. The \ngovernment will also maintain tight control over administered \nprices to keep core inflation in check. \n\nThe current account surplus is forecast to narrow to 4.4% \n\nof GDP in 2020 and widen to 6.3% in 2021 (Figure 3.2.9). \nMerchandise imports are projected to contract by 37.8% in \n2020 as COVID-19 cuts total trade, in particular the 10% of \nimports that come from the People\u2019s Republic of China, and \nrecover by 23.5% in 2021 as domestic demand recovers and the \nsituation stabilizes. Import costs may rise if more expensive \nimports replace cheaper goods from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. Merchandise exports are projected to decline by 32.7% \nin 2020, as lower oil prices cut hydrocarbon export earnings, \nbefore rising by 24.4% in 2021 with higher gas export volumes \nand oil price recovery. Despite less income from tourism, the \ndeficit in services is expected to narrow with the completion \nof major construction services in the oil industry. Public and \npublicly guaranteed debt will remain limited in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s debt management strategy. The budget law allows \n$600 million in external borrowing in 2020. With strategic \ninternational reserves including SOFAZ assets projected to \nremain near $50 billion, Azerbaijan\u2019s external debt should \nremain sustainable over the medium term. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014creating a medium-term \nexpenditure framework for more efficient \nuse of government revenue \nSince 2008, central budget expenditure has grown steadily to \nreach AZN24.4 billion, equal to 29.9% of GDP in 2019, thanks \nto substantial revenue from petroleum exports. SOFAZ was \nestablished to promote the efficient use of this income and \nensure its availability for multiple generations. It transfers \nmoney annually to the budget to support budget expenditure, \nin particular public investment. From 2012 to 2019, transfers \nfrom SOFAZ provided on average nearly half of central budget \n\n\fFigure   3.2.10\u2002 State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan \nbudget transfers\n\n% of total revenue\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\nForecast\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\n144(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nrevenue (Figure 3.2.10). However, transfers are determined \nyear by year, not as part of a longer-term plan. \n\nBecause budgets are currently developed on an annual \ncycle, fiscal policy typically lacks a long-term, strategic focus. \nThis has contributed to the ad-hoc nature of investment \nprojects that are often poorly designed and implemented. To \naddress this problem, the government adopted in 2018 fiscal \nrules governing the use of oil revenues and creating a medium-\nterm expenditure framework (MTEF). To implement this \nframework, the government has agreed to develop strategic \nplans for each sector, including detailed costing; established an \nMTEF center at the Ministry of Finance; and identified three \nsectors\u2014agriculture, education, and environment\u2014to pilot the \nframework starting with the 2021 budget. Implementing the \nMTEF is a challenge for the government, and its success will \nrequire strong efforts from spending ministries. \n\nThe government needs to develop a medium-term \n\nstrategy linked to its main development objectives, with clear \nperformance indicators and a sound monitoring and evaluation \nframework. In addition, strong capacity for macroeconomic \nforecasting is needed to ensure sound fiscal forecasting and \naccurate identification of available fiscal resources. \n\nThe MTEF process is expected to bridge gaps between the \n\ngovernment\u2019s national strategic vision, its strategic plans for \ndifferent sectors, and the annual budgeting exercises of budget \nunits, with a focus on applying public expenditure to attain set \nobjectives. Once the government\u2019s strategic priorities are set, \nthe MTEF will guide budgetary allocations toward attaining \nthem over the medium term. Successful implementation of the \nMTEF depends on ministries\u2019 ability to translate government \nobjectives into sectoral goals and prepare detailed programs \nand procurement plans to specify realistic annual costs within \nthe framework. \n\nThe MTEF requires a strong monitoring and reporting \n\nmechanism. Modern information and communication \ntechnology should replace the outdated budget recording and \nreporting system currently used. The MTEF should bring \nstrong accountability, thereby increasing fiscal transparency \nand public understanding of budget policy. \n\nCapacity and institutional weaknesses are major hurdles \nto implementing the MTEF. Spending agencies currently lack \nthe capacity to formulate sector strategies and medium-term \naction plans. Thus, it is important that the implementation of \nthe MTEF be properly phased. MTEF implementation will be \nmore successful if done incrementally, progressively refining \nexisting systems rather than suddenly replacing them with an \nunfamiliar new process.\n\n\fGeorgia\n\nInfrastructure  spending  and  continued  export  gains  boosted  growth  in  2019.  Inflation \naccelerated  with  currency  depreciation.  Growth  is  projected  at  zero  in  2020  with \ncontinued  monetary  tightening  and  the  effects  of  COVID-19  before  recovering  in  2021 \non  stronger  demand  and  foreign  investment.  Monetary  tightening  is  projected  to  slow \ninflation  in  both  years.  Having  narrowed  in  2019,  the  current  account  deficit  will  narrow \nfurther  by  2021  with  a  continued  decline  in  imports.  Promoting  technological  innovation \nwould  spur  business  development. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth is estimated to have accelerated from 4.8% in 2018 to \n5.1% in 2019, reflecting record spending on public investment \nand a sharp rise in exports. On the supply side, service growth \naccelerated from 5.6% in 2018 to 6.8% in 2019 on strong 15.2% \nexpansion in information and communication technology; 14.1% \nin arts, entertainment, and recreation; and 9.1% in tourist-\nrelated accommodation and food services. Industry expanded \nby 2.7%, with gains in electricity and gas utilities by 5.5% and \nconstruction by 4.1%. Agriculture decreased by 1.0% on low \ninvestment in the sector (Figure 3.3.1). \n\nOn the demand side, preliminary data show growth in \npublic investment more than doubling from 9.2% in 2018 to a \nrecord 25.1%. Expansion in net exports accelerated from 11.0% \nin 2018 to 14.5% as growth slowed in consumption from 5.1% to \n2.4% and in private investment from 6.5% to 4.7%. \n\nAverage inflation nearly doubled from 2.6% in 2018 to \n4.9% with currency depreciation and prices rising sharply \ntoward year-end (Figure 3.3.2). Food prices jumped by 8.2%, \nand excise tax increases boosted prices for alcoholic beverages \nand tobacco by 16.3%. Core inflation\u2014excluding food and \nnonalcoholic beverages, tobacco, energy, and regulated utility \ntariffs\u2014was 2.0%. \n\nA sharp rise in capital spending to the equivalent of an \nestimated 7.0% of GDP widened the fiscal deficit from 0.7% of \nGDP in 2018 to 2.1% (Figure 3.3.3). This occurred despite high \ncollections of value-added tax and improved tax administration \nthat raised tax revenue by 8.7% to equal 22.8% of GDP and \ntotal revenue by 9.2% to equal 25.8% of GDP.

Public debt climbed from the equivalent \nof 44.9% of GDP in 2018 to 47.9% in part because of currency \ndepreciation. Private debt excluding intercompany lending \nrose by nearly 4 percentage points to equal 58.0% of GDP \n(Figure\u00a03.3.4). \n\nTo cope with rising inflationary pressures and currency \n\ndepreciation due to the strengthening of the US dollar and \nlower than expected foreign exchange inflows, the National \nBank of Georgia, the central bank, raised its policy rate by 250 \nbasis points to 9.0% in four steps in the period from September \nto mid-December 2019 and maintained the rate in the first \nquarter of 2020, while cutting reserve requirements on deposits \ndenominated in foreign currency by 5 percentage points to \n25% in October 2019. The lari depreciated in 2019 by 8.9% \nagainst the US dollar, 6.2% against the euro, 4.9% in nominal \neffective terms, and 5.3% in real effective terms. The currency \nlost further ground in the first quarter of 2020 due to the \nglobal rise of the US dollar and risk premium that the market is \nperceiving amid the global COVID-19 outbreak (Figure\u00a03.3.5). \nIn response, the central bank sold foreign exchange in the \namount of $193 million in the period from August 2019 to \nMarch 2020. \n\nBanks remained well capitalized, with improved asset \n\nquality and higher liquidity but less profitability. Bank \ncapital as a percentage of assets was 19.5%, the percentage of \nnonperforming loans 1.9%, and the liquid asset ratio 19.6%\u2014all \nimprovements in 2019. However, dollarization in the banking \nsystem remained high, with deposits unchanged from a year \nearlier at 61.1% and loans down from 56.1% to 54.6%. Average \ninterest rates were 11.8% for loans and 5.7% for deposits.\n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from the equivalent \n\nof 6.8% of GDP in 2018 to an historic low of 4.5% in 2019, \nthough growth in merchandise exports slowed from 22.4% \nin 2018 to an estimated 13.5%. Merchandise import growth \nplunged from 15.1% in 2018 to only 0.8% despite record high \npublic spending on infrastructure, as the lari depreciated and \noil prices fell. Growth in remittances slowed from 13.9% in \n2018 to 9.7%. Tourism revenues increased by 1.4% despite a \nban by the Russian Federation on direct flights to Georgia. \nForeign direct investment\u2014concentrated mainly in finance, \nmanufacturing, tourism, and construction, increased by 0.2% \ndespite profit repatriation and a gradual winding down of \nenergy projects. Foreign reserves rose by $72 million to $3.3 \nbillion at the end of 2019, while external debt reached the \nequivalent of 95.2% of GDP and the public portion of it 37.2%. \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch raised Georgia\u2019s credit rating at \nthe end of 2019 from BB\u2013 to BB.\n\nFigure 3.3.3\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nTax revenue\nNontax revenue and grants\nTotal expenditure\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund. www.imf.org; \nMinistry of Finance of Georgia. www.mof.ge.\n\nFigure 3.3.4\u2002 Corporate and household debt\n\nCorporate debt\nHousehold debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. http://www.nbg.gov.ge.\n\nFigure 3.3.5\u2002 Exchange rate\n\nReal effective \nexchange rate\nNominal effective\nexchange rate\n\nGEL/$\nEUR/$\n\nDec 1995=100\n\nMonthly average\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. http://www.nbg.gov.ge.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nGeorgia\u2002\u2002147\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is projected to decline to zero in 2020 as monetary \ntightening and the impact of COVID-19 constrain consumption \nand limit expansion in tourism and trade, before recovering \nto 4.5% in 2021 with higher domestic demand fueled by \nincreased bank credit to households, increased foreign direct \ninvestment, and a rebound in workers\u2019 remittances (Figure \n3.3.6). Gains in retail trade and higher government education \nspending are projected to boost services by 1.1% in 2020, and \n6.3% in 2021, with the latter reflecting an expected recovery \nin tourism. Growth in industry is projected to contract to 3.1% \nin 2020 with a slowdown in construction and manufacturing \nbefore recovering to 2.1% in 2021 with higher mining output. \nAgriculture is forecast to decline marginally by 0.7% in 2020 \nand expand by 0.4% in 2021 as investments in the sector \nstrengthen. \n\nThe introduction of administered prices on food, which \n\nrepresents 31.3% of the consumer price index, should help \nslow inflation to 4.5% in 2020 and 3.0% in 2021, the central \nbank\u2019s target (Figure 3.3.7). Fiscal policy is projected to be \nexpansionary, as the budget deficit is projected to widen \nsomewhat to 2.5% in both 2020 and 2021 with social spending \nforecast at 9.0% of GDP. This reflects phased increases in the \nbasic pension and a gradual rise in education outlays to 6.0% of \nGDP, despite savings from better targeting of social insurance \nbenefits and improved procurement practices. A revised fiscal \nframework should help minimize fiscal risks by including \ninjections to state owned enterprises and liabilities to public-\nprivate partnerships under the overall debt ceiling of 60.0% \nof GDP. However, public debt is expected to increase to 48.5% \nin 2020 and 49.5% in 2021 in part from the need to continue \nfinancing infrastructure projects (Figure 3.3.8).\n\nGeorgia\u2019s external prospects will depend heavily on \ndevelopments in its trading partners. The current account \ndeficit is projected to narrow further, to 4.4% of GDP in 2020 \nand 4.2% in 2021, with a continued decline in imports as much \nlower oil prices help trim the trade deficit by 2.5% in 2020 \nand 0.5% in 2021 (Figure 3.3.9). Exports are projected to grow \nby 3.6% in 2020 and 11.9% in 2021, with modest domestic \nexpansion and higher foreign direct investment raising imports \nby 1.1% in 2020 and 7.0% in 2021. Gross international reserves \nare expected to reach $3.5 billion in 2020 and $3.6 billion at the \nend of 2021. External debt is expected to equal 96.0% of GDP at \nthe end of 2020 and 96.5% at the end of 2021 (Figure 3.3.10). \nRisks to economic growth include greater than expected \n\nsluggishness in trading partners\u2019 economies, weaker than \nexpected domestic demand, slower growth in tourism \nrevenues, and tighter liquidity in global financial markets, in \npart reflecting the impact of COVID-19.\n\nFigure 3.3.6\u2002 GDP growth\n%\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nSources: National Statistics Office of Georgia; ADB \nestimates.\n\n0.0\n\nForecast\n\nFigure 3.3.7\u2002 Inflation\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: National Bank of Georgia. http://www.nbg.gov.ge.\n\nTable 3.3.1\u2002 Selected economic  \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20024.8\n\n\u20022.6\n\n\u20136.8\n\n\u20025.1\n\n\u20024.9\n\n\u20134.5\n\n\u20020.0\n\n\u20024.5\n\n\u20134.4\n\n\u20024.5\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20134.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n\f148(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014promoting technological \ninnovation for business development\nGeorgia has made tangible progress in creating innovative \ndigital services for business development. However, it is \nconstrained by limited mobile broadband coverage and internet \nconnectivity, especially in rural areas. Georgia has improved \nits adoption of information and communication technology \n(ICT), the third pillar of the enabling environment component \ncited in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness \nIndex 2019, where Georgia ranks 55 of 141 economies. However, \nGeorgia has made little progress in improving the technological \nsophistication of firms, ranking only 91 in innovation capability \nand 93 in entrepreneurial culture. The report highlighted slow \nprogress in university\u2013industry collaboration in research and \ndevelopment and digital skills of workforce, with research \nand development expenditure equal to only 0.3% of GDP, well \nbelow the 1.8% average for upper-middle-income countries. \nTo promote start-ups, the government has inaugurated \ntwo new agencies. The Georgian Innovation and Technology \nAgency supports competitiveness in small and medium-sized \nenterprises and promotes innovative start-ups. It also supports \ninnovation laboratories, business incubators, and new technology \nfirms. The Georgian Entrepreneurship Development Agency \nfacilitates private sector development through a variety of \nfinancial and other facilities to support start-ups during their \nincubation, especially those oriented toward exports. While \nthese efforts have helped firms advance through better use of \nICT, Georgia\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index rank remains low \nat 108 for growth in innovative companies and 120 for cluster \ndevelopment. \n\nAdvances in science and labor market analysis can help \n\nenable firms to innovate. Georgia is taking steps to integrate \nICT into school curricula. ICT is a mandatory subject and part \nof computer-based instruction and learning. In addition, ICT \nmodules are used to train teachers. The government has created \nan information system to collect and analyze labor market data \nto identify mismatches between labor skills and educational \nprograms. Despite these efforts, the local workforce needs \nfurther training, especially in ICT. \n\nThe government receives international support for \ntechnological innovation, including help in formulating a \ndevelopment strategy for broadband infrastructure and \nnarrowing the digital divide between urban and rural areas. \nSupporting dedicated and open-access digital platforms for \na variety of commercial, government, and research activities \nwould help firms integrate ICT more effectively, thereby raising \ntheir productivity. Greater openness to trade and further \ncompetition among firms would also help. \n\nFigure 3.3.8\u2002 Government gross debt and \n\ntotal external debt\n\nGovernment gross debt\nGross external debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n-9\n\n-12\n\n-15\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\nSources: Ministry of Finance of Georgia. www.mof.ge; \nInternational Monetary Fund. www.imf.org.\n\nFigure 3.3.9\u2002 Current account balance\n% of GDP\n\n5-year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of Georgia; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.3.10\u2002 Gross international reserves\n$ billion\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: National Bank of Georgia. www.nbg.gov.\nge; International Monetary Fund. www.imf.org; ADB \nestimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nGeorgia\u2002\u2002149\n\nTo make electronic commerce more trustworthy and \nviable, the government must improve its legal and regulatory \nframework for electronic commerce while creating more \nefficient mechanisms for setting taxes and tariffs. Promoting \ntechnology-oriented start-ups in business process outsourcing, \ninformation services, and computer services could help advance \ninnovation and the use of more modern technology, thereby \nmaking firms more dynamic. Doing so would require further \ninvestments in research and development, as well as reducing \nthe cost of doing business by extending computer systems \nthat link business and government. Cutting operating costs \nfor service users and other cost-cutting investments could \nallow firms to become more efficient and technologically \nsophisticated. Meanwhile, firms could do more to boost their \nown innovative capacity by, for example, offering ICT training to \nworkers. Promoting cluster development, where Georgia ranks \npoorly by international standards, could support innovative links \namong firms. \n\nThe government should continue educational reform, \nincluding measures to reform vocational education and expand \neducation in science and technology, to enhance productivity by \nincreasing the supply of workers with relevant skills. Improving \neducation and familiarity with digital technologies, particularly \nin rural areas, would make growth more broadly based and \ninclusive.\n\n\fKazakhstan\n\nExpansionary  fiscal  policy  helped  lift  growth  in  2019  with  strong  consumption  and \ninvestment.  Price  controls  and  tight  monetary  policy  trimmed  inflation.

The deficit in net \nexports is projected to expand in 2020 but narrow in 2021 as \nexports of goods and services outgrow imports. \n\nInflation is projected to accelerate to 6.0% in 2020 and edge \n\ndown to 5.7% in 2021, also as an effect of administrative and \nmonetary measures (Figure 3.4.9). In March 2020, the central \nbank raised the policy rate by 275 basis points to 12.00% to \nstabilize the national currency, which depreciated dramatically \nin the aftermath of the sharp decline in global oil prices and \nbecause of COVID-19. The government pledged to use regional \nfood stockpiles to maintain price stability. Such measures should \nhelp trim food price inflation to 6.2% in 2020 and 4.7% in 2021, \nas should greater domestic crop production and government \nlimitations on markups for staple foods. Currency depreciation \nwill likely raise inflation for other goods to 6.4% in 2020 and 6.5% \nin 2021, while prices for services should rise by 5.4% in 2020 and \n6.1% in 2021. The central bank is expected to continue issuing \nits own securities to remove excess liquidity and possibly raise \nthe policy rate further to contain inflation. Meanwhile, external \nshocks have the potential to further depreciate the tenge against \nthe US dollar, with the central bank intervening to smooth \nexchange market fluctuations. \n\nFiscal policy over the next 2 years is expected to remain \n\nexpansionary, accommodating countercyclical measures in \nresponse to COVID-19 and continued support to sustain social \nprotection. The state budget is projected to record a deficit equal \nto 3.5% of GDP in 2020 as tax receipts decline, diminishing \nthough to 2.1% of GDP in 2021 (Figure 3.4.10). The non-oil deficit \nwill expand to the equivalent of 8.7% of GDP in 2020 and subside \nto 8.2% in 2021. Revenue is projected slipping to 17.1% of GDP in \n2020 following tax breaks and the economic impact of COVID-19 \nand then recovering to 18.4% in 2021. Expenditure is forecast at \n20.6% of GDP in 2020, declining slightly to 20.5% in 2021 despite \nrising social outlays and continued programs for industrialization, \ninfrastructure, and housing. Notwithstanding the government\u2019s \nplans to reduce sovereign wealth fund transfers to the budget, \nthe rapidly deteriorating economic situation will cause a shortfall \nin tax collection, thus increasing reliance on such transfers. \nGovernment and government-guaranteed debt are projected to \nrise to 26.4% of GDP in 2020 and 27.8% in 2021, reflecting the \nhigher fiscal deficit and currency depreciation. \n\nMonetary policy over the next 2 years will focus on limiting \n\nthe rise in inflation while supporting the government\u2019s efforts \nto mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy.

The share \nof the population living below the national poverty line fell from \n44.5% in 2002 to 2.6% in 2016.

Peaking at 14.6% in 2016, \ninflation eroded savings and drove the population living below \nthe poverty line up to 4.3% in 2018. In response, the government \nbroadened its social assistance program in 2019, easing eligibility \n\nFigure 3.4.10\u2002Fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nFigure 3.4.11\u2002Current account balance\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n% of GDP\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nKazakhstan\u2002\u2002155\n\nFigure 3.4.12\u2002Social assistance\n\nSocial assistance recipients\n\n \n\nSocial assistance\n\nThousand people\n\nUSD/month, average \n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n2005\n\n2009\n\n2013\n\n2017 2019\n\nSource: Republic of Kazakhstan.

The number of social \nassistance recipients nearly quadrupled in 2018 to 2.2 million \npeople, while the average payment more than doubled (Figure \n3.4.12). In the same year, social assistance outlays jumped by 26.0%, \nexceeding a quarter of the state budget or 5.1% of GDP, while \ntransfers from the sovereign wealth fund and other state budget \nrevenue each rose by 18.0%. \n\nThe government\u2019s assistance program helped moderate the \nimpact of external shocks on the vulnerable population. However, \nthe current financing model is not sustainable over the long \nrun. Lower oil prices and stagnant production caused sovereign \nwealth fund receipts to fall by 11.0% in 2019, and they are likely to \ndeteriorate further in the near future. Wealth fund assets, estimated \nat $60 billion, provide the fiscal space needed to meet growing \nsocial obligations for some time. Eventually, however, sustaining \nthe welfare system will require the authorities to ensure some \ncombination of higher revenue, increased borrowing, and/or lower \nexpenditure from tighter eligibility requirements or smaller benefits. \nThe government is working to improve program targeting \n\nand streamlining administration. In September 2019, careful \nverification removed more than 72,000 people from social \nassistance. In 2020, eligibility became conditional on able-bodied \nfamily members seeking employment, complemented by the \nstate-run Enbek employment program. Further, the government is \nopening support centers across the country to provide advice and \nassistance to large and low-income families. \n\nOn the revenue side, the government is gradually implementing \n\nthe twice-postponed Universal Declaration of Income and \nProperty (UDIP) to facilitate compliance and reduce tax evasion. \nCivil servants will begin submitting declarations in 2021, and the \ngoal is to require declarations from all taxpayers by 2025. While \nmost of the work needed for the new system has been completed, \nimplementing the UDIP is a complex task, with success depending \non many factors, most notably proper data protection to prevent \nits misuse. The UDIP rollout is expected to help the government \nshrink the shadow economy to 15%\u201317% of GDP from current \nestimates of somewhat less than 30%, according to the Statistics \nCommittee of Kazakhstan. Also, the UDIP may improve the \ntargeting of social assistance by providing additional information \non household income. \n\nTo complement these measures, the government may decide \n\nto replace the current flat income tax with a progressive tax, \nincreasing rates for high-earning households. This system would \nleave more money with low-wage earners, who are likely to \nspend it on basic necessities, possibly increasing government tax \nreceipts overall.\n\nImproving revenue collection and the administration of the \n\nsocial assistance program should make social assistance more \nsustainable. It is preferable to increasing public debt or relying on \nadditional transfers to the budget from the sovereign wealth fund. \n\n\fKyrgyz Republic\n\nGrowth accelerated in 2019, driven by mining and manufacturing. Inflation decelerated as \nsubstantial  food  imports  held  prices  down,  and  high  gold  exports  narrowed  the  current \naccount  deficit.  Growth  is  projected  to  decelerate  in  2020  in  tandem  with  a  slowdown \nin  the  country\u2019s  main  trade  partners  amid  the  global  COVID-19  outbreak,  but  recover \nin  2021  as  gold  exports  rise.  For  a  third  consecutive  year,  the  government  is  promoting \ndevelopment  in  lagging  regions.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth in the first 3 quarters was strong, rising above \n6.0%, but it slowed during the fourth quarter (Q4) and finally \naveraged 4.5% in the full year (Figure 3.5.1). Growth outside \nthe large gold-mining industry reached 3.8%.\n\nOn the supply side, growth in industry accelerated from \n\n5.9% in 2018 to 8.1%. Although gold production slowed in Q4 \nas yields declined, steady growth in gold production in the first \n3 quarters of 2019 allowed mining growth overall to reverse \n2.1% contraction in 2018 with 18.4% growth in 2019. Growth \nin manufacturing rose from 5.1% in 2018 to 8.3% on increased \nproduction of metals, mineral products, coal, apparel, and food \nproducts. Expansion in construction rose from 7.8% in 2018 \nto 10.6% with robust investment in mining, energy, transport \ninfrastructure, and trade facilities. Growth in agriculture was \nlittle changed at 2.6%. Expansion in services was also about the \nsame in both years, at 2.9%. Transport growth jumped from \n1.2% in 2018 to 3.3%, but retail and wholesale trade growth slid \nfrom 5.7% in 2018 to 4.9% in 2019.\n\nOn the demand side, public expenditures are estimated \nto have risen as spending increased on energy and transport \ninfrastructure projects. Meanwhile, private consumption is \nestimated to have grown as wage increases in public schools \nand hospitals in Q4 of 2019 more than offset a 13.5% fall in \nremittances (Figure 3.5.2).\n\nInflation slowed from an average annual rate of 1.5% \nin 2018 to 1.1%, with prices held down by 0.3% Kyrgyz som \nappreciation versus the US dollar and substantial food imports \n(Figure 3.5.3). Food prices fell in the first half but were pushed \nup by seasonal factors in Q4. Meanwhile, prices for other goods \nincreased by 0.6%, and for services by 0.1%.

Expenditure rose from 27.7% of GDP \nin 2018 to 28.4%, but revenue rose faster, from 26.6% of GDP \nto 28.3%. The smaller deficit and higher nominal GDP cut \nexternal government debt from 48.0% of GDP at the end of \n2018 to 44.8% at the end of Q3 of 2019. Domestic government \ndebt remained less than 6.0% of GDP. \n\nDuring 2019, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, \nthe central bank, loosened monetary policy and restricted its \ncurrency interventions to smoothing excess som volatility. \nWith inflation low, the policy interest rate was cut from \n4.75% at the end of 2018 to 4.25%, supporting economic \nexpansion with strong domestic credit growth for a third \nyear in a row. The average deposit interest rate increased \nfrom January to December 2019 by 0.07 percentage points to \n4.2%, while the average lending rate fell by 0.2 percentage \npoints to 14.8%. Deposits rose by 13.4% and credit by 14.5%, \nwhile growth in broad money accelerated from 5.5% in 2018 \nto 8.8%. Nonperforming loans worsened from 7.5% of all loans \nat the end of 2018 to 8.4% a year later. Dollarization remains \nextensive but is declining, with the share of foreign currency \nloans falling from 38.0% in 2018 to 35.7%, and deposits from \n44.5% to 40.7%.\n\nThe current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed \n\nfrom the equivalent of 12.3% of GDP in 2018 to 10%. Exports \nrose by 7.5%, driven by gold exports up by 25.4%, vegetables \n44%, meat products 43%, and cement 32%. Imports fell by \n6.3%, reflecting imports of apparel and shoes down by 28%, \nsugar 26%, and chemical products 23%. Year-end international \nreserves rose from $2.1 billion in 2018 to a record high of \n$2.3 billion, or cover for 4.1 months of imports. External \ndebt, including government-guaranteed and private debt, is \nestimated to have fallen from 85.64% of GDP at the end of 2018 \nto 82.6% at the end of Q3 of 2019 (Figure 3.5.5).  \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast at 4.0% in 2020 (Figure 3.5.6). Although \ngold exports could benefit from global financial volatility, \nimport disruption under COVID-19 affecting raw materials, \nequipment, and food from the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nother countries will hold back manufacturing, construction, \nand other import-dependent industries. If the outbreak \nworsens and border closures are prolonged, growth could slow \neven further. It should then pick up to 4.5% in 2021, assuming \nrecovery in the region.\n\nOn the supply side, gold production is expected to stay \nhealthy. On the demand side, however, spending may shrink, \n\nFigure 3.5.3\u2002 Exchange rate\n\nSom/$\n\n67\n\n68\n\n69\n\n70\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nhttp://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 5 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.5.4\u2002 Monthly inflation\n\nHeadline\nFood\nNonfood\nServices\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Bulletin of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic. http://www.nbkr.kg (accessed 5 March 2020). \n\nFigure 3.5.5\u2002 External debt\n\nGovernment\nPrivate\n\n% of GDP\n\n120\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nNote: Government debt refers to both government and \ngovernment-guaranteed debt.

The \ncentral bank is expected to remain focused on maintaining price \nstability and a flexible exchange rate, and continue to intervene \nonly to smooth excessive som volatility. Inflation in 2021 is \nexpected to fall to 3.0% as conditions stabilize (Figure 3.5.7). \nThe fiscal deficit is projected to widen to the equivalent \nof 2.0%\u20133.0% of GDP in 2020 and 2021, with higher current \nspending on measures to contain COVID-2019. Nevertheless, the \ngovernment is expected to continue to restrain unprioritized \nexpenditure while improving tax policy and administration. \nOver the longer term, fiscal consolidation will remain a major \nconcern. Efforts will focus on reforming public wages, cutting \nsubsidies, improving the targeting of social benefits, broadening \nthe tax base, and strengthening tax and customs administration. \nThe aim is to keep public external debt below the equivalent of \n50% of GDP in the medium term.\n\nThe current account de\ufb01cit is expected to widen to 12.0% in \n2020, due to a fall in non-gold exports, and fall back to 10.0% in \n2021 (Figure 3.5.8).

However, the Kyrgyz Republic ranked \nonly 122 of 189 in the United Nations\u2019 Human Development \nReport 2019. Further, poverty is unevenly distributed at 20.1% in \nurban areas, and 23.7% in rural areas. About 68% of the poor are \nfound in rural areas, with Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Batken accounting \nfor 60%.\n\nLimited access to jobs is a common factor in lagging regions, \n\nespecially in remote ones. Lagging regions\u2019 share in overall \nemployment plunged from 53.1% in 2000 to 29.3% in 2018. \nTo cope, residents have moved to informal jobs elsewhere in \nthe country or emigrated to take low-skilled jobs. More than \n663,000 migrant workers are now estimated to be in the Russian \nFederation and another 150,000 in Kazakhstan. Workers\u2019 \nremittances, which equaled 12.7% of GDP in 2005, averaged \n30% in 2011\u20132016 and have stabilized at about 22%. Excluding \nremittances, poverty rates remain high, especially in the southern \nregions.\n\nAlthough increased investment could promote growth in \nlagging regions, both foreign and domestic investment currently \nremain weak. Foreign direct investment is low, equal to 9.0% \nof GDP in 2010\u20132018 and concentrated in mining. Meanwhile, \npolicy support for small and medium-sized enterprises such as \npreferential tax, financing, and regulatory treatment remains \nlimited, inhibiting their growth and competitiveness and \nhindering their adoption of new technologies and shift toward \nexport orientation. To enable more participation in global and \nregional value chains, the Kyrgyz Republic should improve its \nranking of 80 out of 190 in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2019.\nThe government\u2019s Regional Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic, \n2018\u20132022 is an integrated development program for targeted \nregions over the medium to long term. The objective is to develop \neconomically competitive clusters of small and medium-sized \nenterprises that use the local raw materials available in their \nregion. The program is expected to narrow the gap between the \nmore prosperous regions of Bishkek, Chui, and Issyk-Kul and \nother economically deprived regions: Batken, Jalal-Abad, Naryn, \nOsh, and Talas. It has identified 20 regional development centers \nor growth points, 5 or 6 of which are to be developed initially. \nSpecial attention will be paid to developing agriculture by \ncreating new irrigation projects and better maintaining existing \nones. Regional and strategic roads are being developed to \nfacilitate trade. With an improved investment climate and better \ninfrastructure, agro-industrial clusters have potential to be \ngrowth drivers. Other areas with potential are tourism, livestock \nbreeding, construction, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. \n\nThe government is implementing measures to improve the tax \n\nregime and strengthen capacity in local governments for public \n\n\f160(cid:127)(cid:127)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nadministration. The Russian\u2013Kyrgyz Development Fund and the \nGuarantee Fund have developed mechanisms to support business \nin the regions. Decentralization will be pursued. The government \nwill directly undertake infrastructure development and \nencourage private enterprise, notably in manufacturing, through \npublic\u2013private partnership. Human resource development in the \nidentified growth centers will receive priority. It is expected that \nregional development will create jobs, thus slowing migration. \nFurther development of free trade zones and industrial parks \ncan complement the development of economic corridors toward \npromoting balanced regional growth. \n\nFinally, a digital transformation program aims to promote \nthe use of information and communication technology to connect \ngovernment, businesses, and citizens. A high-tech park to promote \nthe development of a domestic tech sector and attract foreign \ninvestment has been operational for more than 5 years. \n\nAccelerating development in lagging regions and improving \n\nthe lives of their residents would (i) foster higher economic \ngrowth by diversifying the manufacturing and export base \nand promoting new growth drivers and centers to create jobs; \n(ii)\u00a0make economic growth more inclusive, improve the quality of \nbasic services such as water supply and sanitation, and enhance \nthe employability of the population through skills development; \n(iii) improve the business environment for attracting investment \ninto the regions and developing private sector activity and public\u2013\nprivate partnership; (iv) and catalyze solutions that enable the \ncountry to better leverage cross-border regional cooperation by \nutilizing potential for export and trade facilitation, agriculture \nvalue chains, and single markets in industry and services with \nother countries under the Eurasian Economic Union.\n\n\fTajikistan\n\nAcceleration across sectors and a rebound in remittances boosted growth in 2019. Higher \ndomestic  demand  lifted  inflation,  but  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed  slightly.  Lower \npublic  investment,  along  with  weak  remittances  and  foreign  direct  investment  resulting \nfrom  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  are  projected  to  slow  growth  in  2020  and  again  in  2021, \nwith  inflation  remaining  in  single  digits.

Aluminum \nproduction reversed a 6.8% plunge in 2018 to grow by 5.2%, while \ngold production rose by 26.2% to a new record (Figure 3.6.1). \nExpansion in agriculture accelerated from 4.0% in 2018 to 7.1% \non moderate gains in fruit and vegetable production and a strong \nrecovery in cotton after a drought-induced fall in output in 2018. \nGrowth in services, the largest sector (Figure 3.6.2), increased \nfrom 2.1% to 2.9% as a 6.3% rise in remittances helped expand \nretail trade by 9.6%. Construction reversed a 7.8% rise in 2018 to \nfall by 6.3%, reflecting weak demand for housing.\n\nOn the demand side, increased consumer demand boosted \n\ngrowth, though fixed capital investment reversed from a \n7.8% rise in 2018 to a 6.3% decline with less growth in public \ninvestment. Net exports fell by 4.8% as continued but slower \ngrowth in infrastructure spending boosted imports, particularly \nfor capital goods. Exports rose on higher electricity generation \nand cement production but remained lower than imports. \n\nInflation accelerated from 5.4% in 2018 to 8.0% as prices \n\nrose by 10.9% for food, 4.2% for other goods, and 5.5% for \nservices (Figure 3.6.3).

Expenditure declined from 31.9% of GDP in 2018 \nto 30.4% as outlays to complete and launch the second unit of \nRogun in September proved smaller than anticipated. Robust GDP \ngrowth, external debt repayment, and limited new borrowing \nreduced public and publicly guaranteed external debt from 38.9% \nof GDP at the end of 2018 to 36.8% a year later, with total public \ndebt declining from 47.9% of GDP in 2018 to 45.2% (Figure 3.6.5).  \nThe National Bank of Tajikistan, the central bank, struggled \nto contain monetary expansion despite setting an inflation target \nof 7% +/\u20132 percentage points and expanding sales of Treasury \nbills and central bank securities to restrain liquidity. Growth in \nbroad money tripled from 5.1% in 2018 to 16.9%, while expansion \nin private credit almost doubled from 6.5% to 12.0% (Figure \n3.6.6). Reserve money growth also jumped, from 7.0% in 2018 to \n20.1%. The central bank raised the refinancing rate from 14.00% \nto 14.75% in February 2019 before cutting it to 13.25% in June and \n12.25% in December\u2014then raised it again to 12.75% in February \n2020 to cool the economy. Efforts to combat dollarization and \ntighten foreign exchange controls trimmed the share of foreign \ncurrency deposits from 53.2% at the end of 2018 to 46.9% a year \nlater, and loans in foreign currency from 57.1% to 48.7%. \n\nImproved bank supervision helped cut nonperforming loans \n\nfrom 31.1% of total credit in 2018 to 26.1%, as did greater loan \nvolume enabled by higher remittances. The return on bank assets \nimproved marginally from 1.9% in 2018 to 2.1%, and the return \non bank equity from 7.0% to 7.7% (Figure 3.6.7). Two large banks \nremained troubled, however, and their resolution plans remain \nto be approved. In December 2019 the central bank launched \nthe National Processing Center for Remittances, which requires \ntransfer operators in the subregion and further afield to register \nand deposit remittances there.  \n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from the equivalent \n\nof 5.0% of GDP in 2018 to an estimated 4.5% last year. The \ntrade deficit widened marginally from $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion \nas export growth slowed from 10.4% in 2018 to 9.3%, but a \nslowdown in capital inputs for the Rogun hydropower project \nslashed growth in imports from 13.5% in 2018 to 6.3%. With \nsome economic growth during 2019 in the Russian Federation, \nremittances edged up from $2.6 billion in 2018 to $2.7 billion, \nequal to 33.4% of GDP.

Fiscal consolidation \nwill reduce public investment, a weak business climate will \ndiscourage private investment, and low remittances from \nsluggish growth in the Russian Federation will limit domestic \nconsumption. A pickup in private credit along with increased \nproduction and exports will support growth, as will additional \nelectricity generation and improving economic relations with \nneighboring countries (Figure 3.6.9). Downside risks stem \nfrom weakness at two large banks and several state-owned \nenterprises, along with the possibility of greater declines in \nremittances, foreign direct investment, and tourism receipts as \na result of COVID-19. \n\nOn the supply side, expansion in industry will likely \nslow as COVID-19 reduces foreign direct investment, despite \ncontinuing efforts to boost electricity generation, mining, and \nmanufacturing. Reduced activity at Rogun and expected delays \nin construction of Tajikistan\u2019s segment of a gas pipeline from \nTurkmenistan to the People\u2019s Republic of China should slow \nconstruction. Agriculture is expected to rise modestly with \nadditional area under cultivation. Growth in services will slow \nin 2020 with low remittances but recover somewhat in 2021 as \nremittances expand.\n\nOn the demand side, public investment will remain the main \n\ngrowth driver, despite a further slowdown, as a weak business \nclimate limits private investment. Private consumption will \nfall with low remittances.

Tax \nrevenue is projected to fall by 10% in 2020 as lower imports \nattributable to disruption in trade, a decline in investment \nprojects, and weaker domestic demand from the unfavorable \nexternal environment cut customs duties. Total revenue is \nforecast at 25.1% of GDP in 2020 and 25.6% in 2021. Expenditure \nis forecast equal to 29.4% of GDP in 2020 and 29.9% in 2021 \nbut could be higher with additional recapitalization of troubled \nbanks, any clearing of arrears at state-owned enterprises, or \nfaster currency depreciation, which would raise the cost of \nimports to supply investments. Although foreign assistance now \ncomes entirely through grants because of Tajikistan\u2019s high risk \nof debt distress, the authorities anticipate covering any financing \ngaps for infrastructure through external borrowing, raising \ntotal external debt\u2014all of it public\u2014to $3.5 billion, or 39.0% of \nGDP, by the end of 2021. The prospect of continued large fiscal \ndeficits from heavy investment spending risks making an already \nheavy debt burden unsustainable while weakening the external \nposition through higher imports. \n\nMonetary policy will likely aim to contain inflation and \nlimit depreciation by tightening liquidity but may be constrained \nby demand for budget financing. The central bank could raise \nthe refinancing rate if needed to limit inflation. Resources for \nlending to private firms may increase with the gradual recovery \nof the banking system. \n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to remain equal to \n\n4.5% of GDP in 2020 and narrow slightly because of slower \ngrowth to 4.2% in 2021, with continued heavy capital-intensive \nimports (Figure 3.6.11). Exports are projected to grow by \n10% annually in both 2020 and 2021 with higher electricity \ngeneration, including substantial exports of electricity to \nAfghanistan and Uzbekistan. With weak growth in the Russian \nFederation and the adverse effects of COVID-19 there and in \nother countries, remittances are projected to fall by 10% in 2020 \nand recover by 5% in 2021. Imports are expected to moderate in \n2020 and expand by 5% in 2021 with rising disposable income \nand despite continued efforts to replace imports of food and \nmanufactures with local alternatives. Reserves may fall below \nthe current level despite purchase of domestically produced \ngold to offset sales of foreign exchange aimed at stabilizing the \nexchange rate.\n\nFigure 3.6.8\u2002 Gross international reserves\n\nAmount\n\n$ billion\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nQ2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2 Q4 Q2\n2019\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: National Bank of Tajkistan.\n\nFigure 3.6.9\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Tajkistan State Statistical Agency; ADB \nestimates.\n\nFigure 3.6.10\u2002 Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n1.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming tax policy\nHeavy infrastructure spending has created pressure to \nmobilize more revenue.

Much of the burden falls on companies, for which \nthe effective tax rate including required pension and insurance \ncontributions averages 67% for a typical firm. This is more \nthan double the norm for transitional economies in Europe \nand Central Asia, according to the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness 2020 website. The unfavorable tax regime makes tax \ncompliance costly and time consuming, prompting firms to \nrelocate to neighboring countries. To improve the investment \nclimate, Tajikistan must reconsider how to make its tax policy \nmore business friendly while finding other ways to increase \nrevenue.  \n\nCurrent tax policy has unrealistic revenue collection targets \nusing reported GDP growth, which mainly reflects heavy public \nspending and overstates likely income growth at private firms. \nAt the same time, tax laws provide generous tax exemptions \nestimated to exceed 5% of GDP, but they have failed to promote \ninnovation and investment even as they distort markets and \nexcessively burden small and medium-sized enterprises. \nRetroactive tax inspections and reviews invite corruption by \nsome tax officers and have induced some investors to leave \nthe country or close or sell their businesses. At the same time, \nthe tax base has shrunk under inconsistent tax legislation, \npoor comprehension of tax provisions, and substantial tax \navoidance and evasion, creating a large informal economy while \nundermining business prospects.  \n\nThe government has begun a comprehensive process to \nintroduce a new tax code in 2021. Goals include reducing overall \nnumber of taxes, lowering corporate tax rates and providing \npreferential rates for small businesses while widening the tax \nbase and simplifying business operations. Electronic filing of \ntax returns and online payment of tax liabilities have already \nbeen introduced to simplify taxpaying and reduce corruption. \nHowever, more could be done to advance reform: reviewing tax \nexemptions to further broaden the tax base, moving from tax \ninspections toward risk-based assessment, and shifting more \nof the tax burden from income and profit to consumption. In \nparticular, tax incentives should be limited to activities with clear \nand monitorable impacts on investment, innovation, regional \ndevelopment, and/or employment generation. In addition, \nadministrative and compliance burdens should be reduced.\nMeanwhile, the government must assess how proposed \nreform will affect revenue mobilization. Reform that lightens \nadministrative burdens but reduces revenue will intensify fiscal \npressures and make it harder to finance existing expenditure \ncommitments. Unless the government wants to trim spending, \nreform will require new revenue measures, such as higher taxes \non consumption and household income, to offset lower corporate \ntaxes and boost revenue from sources other than income.\n\n\fTurkmenistan\n\nFaster  expansion  in  hydrocarbon  production  modestly  spurred  growth  in  2019.  Inflation \nremained  in  double  digits,  and  the  current  account  fell  into  a  marginal  deficit.  Growth  is \nprojected to moderate this year and next, with a corresponding decline in inflation. Robust \nimports  to  supply  government  investment  projects  are  projected  to  widen  the  current \naccount deficit in 2020 and 2021. Risk persists, given the likely global economic slowdown \ncaused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  a  fall  in  commodity  prices.  Extensive  reform  is \nneeded  to  diversify  exports  and  mitigate  vulnerability  to  commodity  price  shocks. \n\nEconomic performance\nThe government reported GDP growth rising slightly from \n6.2% in 2018 to 6.3% in 2019, driven by expansion in both \nthe large hydrocarbon industry and the rest of the economy \n(Figure 3.7.1). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nestimated that higher oil and gas output boosted growth in \nhydrocarbons from 5.4% in 2018 to 6.6%. Government support \nfor import substitution kept expansion in the rest of the \neconomy stable at 6.3%.   \n\nAccording to preliminary ADB estimates, higher gas \n\noutput boosted growth in industry from 6.0% in 2018 to 6.9%. \nExpansion in services remained at 7.0% but with gains in \nretail trade, catering, and transport. Growth in agriculture is \nestimated to have accelerated from 3.5% in 2018 to 4.0% as \ncotton and wheat harvests met government targets.  \n\nOn the demand side, higher gas exports supported growth, \nas did public investment though less so than in previous years. \nThe IMF estimated that spending cuts required by fiscal \nadjustment trimmed gross investment from 28.2% of GDP in \n2018 to 24.4% (Figure 3.7.2). Growth in private consumption \nremained sluggish as rising prices constrained real household \nincomes. \n\nNo official estimate has been released for inflation in 2019, \n\nbut the IMF projected in its October 2019 World Economic \nOutlook that average annual inflation would rise slightly \nfrom 13.2% in 2018 to 13.4%, driven mainly by credit growth \nand increases in utility tariffs and other administered prices \n(Figure 3.7.3).

It also kept the exchange \nrate fixed, limiting access to foreign exchange. Credit growth \nremained sizable, with credit rising to equal 63% of GDP. \nLending mainly entailed subsidized credit to state-owned \nenterprises in priority sectors, with some credit provided to \nprivate firms involved in import substitution. \n\nThe state budget deficit is estimated to be unchanged \nat the equivalent of 0.1% of GDP in 2019, held down by cuts \nto capital spending and consumer subsidy programs, while \nthe nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit reportedly narrowed from \n6.2% of GDP in 2018 to 5.2% (Figure 3.7.4). Revenue was \nestimated to have slipped from the equivalent of 13.5% of \nGPD in 2018 to 12.9%, and expenditure from 13.7% in 2018 to \n13.2%. The central bank financed most of the budget deficit. \nExtrabudgetary spending remained considerable.

Hydrocarbons accounted for 90.1% of all \nexports in 2018, with natural gas providing 55.2%, oil 22.6%, \nand oil products 12.3%. Most exports go to a single market, \npreviously the Russian Federation but now the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Such export concentration leaves the country \nvulnerable to commodity price shocks observed since mid-2014. \n\nEconomic diversification has been a key element of \n\nTurkmenistan\u2019s national program of socioeconomic development \nfor 2011\u20132030.

Targeted government support to \nexport-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises has, along \nwith steps to lower impediments to local private businesses, \nincreased the production of import substitutes for building \nmaterials and in light industry, mainly textiles, clothing, and \nsuch food products as meat, dairy goods, flour, and flavorings. \nThese developments have raised the share of manufacturing and \nprocessing in industry (Fig. 3.7.9). Local production now meets a \nlarge share of domestic demand, reducing the need to import.  \nMeanwhile, Turkmenistan has significant potential to \nexpand its export-oriented manufacturing and services. Greater \nparticipation in global trade would, however, require making \nthe economy more open. For that to succeed, domestic firms \nwould need to upgrade and diversify their output with new and \nmore sophisticated products. This would mean jobs with higher \nproductivity and therefore able to provide higher incomes.\n\nShifting the focus in Turkmenistan from import substitution \n\nto export promotion would require deeper institutional and \nstructural reform to overcome current obstacles to doing \nbusiness internationally, make the country more open to trade, \nand conform with international standards. This should include, \namong other measures, pursuing more efficient investment \nprojects, creating a conducive business and investment climate, \nfostering private sector activity, improving access to finance in a \nmore effective financial system, and upgrading the skills of the \nworkforce. \n\nMaking investment projects more efficient is paramount, \n\nas high investment in the past, nearly equal to half of GDP, \nhas generated only limited improvements in productivity and \ncompetitiveness except in hydrocarbons. Careful assessment of \npossible export activities outside of the hydrocarbon economy is \nneeded to gauge their potential to be competitive and viable over \nthe long term. This would depend on demand in international \nmarkets and the impact of new activities on domestic \nemployment and income. Reviewing and prioritizing current \ninvestment projects based on such assessments is important to \nguide the selection of the most efficient investments for export-\noriented production. \n\nAttracting foreign direct investment in the nonhydrocarbon \n\neconomy could help bring capital, skills, and managerial \nknow-how while providing greater access to foreign markets. \nThe major prerequisite for this is creating a business-friendly \nenvironment. \n\nReforming the investment and business climate could \nfacilitate greater foreign investment inflow and invigorate \nthe private sector. The European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development contends in its Transition Report 2019\u20132020\nthat Turkmenistan needs to improve in many institutional \ndimensions, notably governance, transparency, competitiveness, \n\n\f170(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nprivate sector development, and financial intermediation. \nLoosening the state monopoly in banking, deepening financial \nintermediation, and improving exchange rate management \nwould enhance reform and remove current disincentives for \nefficient investment and business. \n\nDeveloping human capital and a more skilled workforce \nis essential to boost labor productivity and competitiveness. \nThis requires improving the quality of education at all levels, \nespecially tertiary education, which has the most impact on \ninnovation and graduating to higher value added. According to \nthe United Nations Development Program\u2019s Human Development \nReport 2019, Turkmenistan needs to boost its tertiary education \nprograms, as only 8% of its rapidly expanding young population \nis enrolled in tertiary education. Expanding tertiary education, \nstregthening its research and development capacities for \ninnovation would help enhance productivity of the workforce. \n\nTurkmenistan would also benefit from greater data \ndissemination, closer ties with development partners, and \nmore participation in international surveys and assessments \nsuch as the Doing Business Report of the World Bank, Global \nCompetitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum, and \nPublic Investment Management Assessment framework of the \nIMF, which would help identify existing bottlenecks and suggest \nsteps to overcome them.\n\n\fUzbekistan\n\nAn  improved  business  climate  spurred  investment,  boosting  growth.  Inflation  moderated, \nand  higher  exports  narrowed  the  current  account  deficit.  Growth  is  anticipated  to  slow  in \n2020  with  lower  demand  and  prices  for  natural  gas  and  copper,  as  well  as  the  effects  of \nCOVID-19,  then  recover  in  2021  as  industry  and  agriculture  pick  up.  Monetary  tightening \nwill  trim  inflation  further  in  2020  and  2021,  and  slower  import  growth  will  narrow  the \ncurrent  account  deficit.  Inflation  must  be  contained  even  as  structural  reform  continues.\n\nFigure   3.8.1\u2002 GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture\nConstruction\nIndustry excluding construction\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n% change year on year\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n7.4\n\n6.1\n\n4.5\n\n5.4\n\n5.6\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: State Statistics Committee; ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe government reported that growth accelerated marginally \nfrom 5.4% in 2018 to 5.6% in 2019. \n\nOn the supply side, expansion in agriculture rose from 0.3% \n\nin 2018 to 2.5% as abundant water supply and price incentives \nfor cotton and wheat raised crop harvests by 3.7% and livestock \nproduction by 1.7%. Growth in construction accelerated from \n14.3% in 2018 to 19.0%, driven by housing, infrastructure \ndevelopment, and modernizing industrial facilities. Expansion \nin industry declined from 10.8% in 2018 to 6.6% as a slowdown \nin hydrocarbon production trimmed output from mining \nand quarrying by 1.0%, reversing 26.5% expansion in 2018, \nthough growth in manufacturing rose from 7.9% to 9.4%. \nGrowth in services also moderated, from 5.5% in 2018 to 5.1%, \nreflecting smaller gains in trade, accommodation, catering, \ntransportation, storage, and information and communication \n(Figure 3.8.1). \n\nOn the demand side, investment was the main growth \n\ndriver, with gross fixed capital formation jumping from \n29.9% expansion in 2018 to 33.9% on higher investment in \nmanufacturing, mining and quarrying, energy, and housing. \nAn improved investment climate boosted foreign loans and \nforeign direct investment (FDI) into modernizing machinery \nand equipment, upgrading inventories, and construction. \nGrowth in private consumption slipped from 5.9% in 2018 to \nan estimated 5.7%, but public consumption accelerated from \n4.8% to an estimated 5.5%. Wages and income were higher for \ncivil servants and workers generally, augmented by increased \nremittances and lending to households. Net exports improved \nby 4.2% as growth in exports outpaced imports. \n\nThis chapter was written by Begzod M. Djalilov of the Uzbekistan Resident \nMission, ADB, Tashkent.\n\n\f172(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInflation slowed from 17.5% in 2018 to 14.6% as tight \nmonetary policy and delayed adjustments to utility prices cut \ninflation by more than a quarter in the first 7 months of 2019 \n(Figure 3.8.2). Inflation reaccelerated during the rest of the \nyear on price increases averaging 21.6% for regulated items \nsuch as bread and electricity in the second half and with 5.5% \ndepreciation of the Uzbek sum against the US dollar in August \n2019, after the exchange rate was floated (Figure 3.8.3). \n\nThe consolidated budget reversed a surplus in 2018 equal \nto 0.5% of GDP with a 1.5% deficit. The overall fiscal balance, \ncomprising the consolidated budget balance and expenditure \non state programs financed by external borrowing and covered \nby the state budget, also showed a deficit, up from 2.5% of \nGDP a year earlier to 3.9%. Higher spending on social and \ninfrastructure development, coupled with a 39.0% increase in \nsalary expenditure, boosted total outlays by 37.0%. Revenue \nrose by 27.0%, benefiting from a broader base for value-added \ntax (VAT), the adoption of a 12% personal income tax, the \ncancellation of customs exemptions on imports beginning in \nOctober 2019, and higher reporting of taxable wages brought \nabout by stronger tax enforcement. External borrowing \nfinanced an estimated 57.1% of the deficit and domestic sources \nthe rest. \n\nDespite declining inflation, the central bank kept the policy \nrate at 16.0% as credit growth accelerated from 51.4% to 54.8%. \nLoans in foreign currency outgrew domestic currency loans \nbecause interest rates on US dollar loans averaged only 7.0% \nversus 24.4% for those denominated in Uzbek sum. Policy-\nguided lending at an average interest rate of 7.6% boosted \ncredit expansion, kept state-owned banks\u2019 share in total assets \nat 86.0%, and weakened the impact of monetary policy. \n\nGrowth in broad money accelerated slightly from 13.2% to \n13.8% (Figure 3.8.4). Broad money in Uzbek sum grew by 14.4%, \ndown from 21.7% a year earlier, while net foreign assets rose by \n12.7%, reversing 1.7% decline in 2018.\n\nIn the first half of 2019, excess demand for foreign \n\nexchange helped depreciate the sum by 2.8% despite occasional \ncentral bank intervention. With rapid credit growth fueling \nimport demand, the central bank floated the currency on 20 \nAugust, following 8.7% depreciation against the US dollar \nfrom January. Cumulative depreciation reached 14.0% during \nthe year. To avoid a run on deposits, the central bank advised \ncommercial banks to adjust interest rates on deposits, which \nin August 2019 averaged 18.0% for local currency and 5.0% for \nUS dollar deposits, and to be flexible about changing credit \nterms so that borrowers could repay loans at the new exchange \nrate. As part of structural reform, the government abolished \nfrom 1 October exemptions from customs payments, which \nencouraged importers to boost inventories of intermediate and \ncapital goods beforehand. \n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nSum/$ \n\n10,000\n\n8,000\n\n6,000\n\n4,000\n\n2,000\n\n0\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n-200\n\n-400\n\nFigure 3.8.2\u2002Monthly inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nNonfood\nServices\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: State Statistics Committee.\n\nFigure 3.8.3\u2002 Exchange rate\n\nAug\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJan\n2017\n\nAug\n\nJan\n2018\n\nAug\n\nAug\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: The Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan; \nADB estimates.\n\nFigure   3.8.4\u2002 Contributions to money \n\nsupply growth\n\nNet foreign assets\nNet domestic assets\n\nBroad money growth\n\nPercentage points\n\n% change year on year\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n-50\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: The Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia \n\nUzbekistan\u2002\u2002173\n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from 7.1% of GDP \nin 2018 to 4.2% as the trade deficit shrank from $9.3 billion \nto $8.9 billion (Figure 3.8.5). Exports of goods and services \nexpanded by 25.3%, a significant rise, albeit less than the 39.1% \nrise in 2018. Import growth slowed sharply from 42.3% in \n2018 to 13.6%, with the lesser increase coming from imports of \ncapital and intermediate goods for industry and construction. \nCross-border transfers, mainly worker remittances, rose from \n$5.1 billion a year earlier to $5.8 billion, or 10.0% of 2019 GDP. \nFDI rose from the equivalent of 6.2% of GDP in 2018 to 7.3%, \ndriven by investments in petrochemicals, cement, and textiles. \nExternal public debt climbed from 19.8% of GDP in 2018 to \n26.2%. Foreign reserves rose from $27.1 billion at the end of \n2018 to $29.2 billion a year later, providing cover for 13 months \nof imports (Figure 3.8.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is likely to slow to 4.7% in 2020 with the adverse \nimpact of COVID-19, along with lower demand and prices for \nnatural gas and copper, despite support from the government\u2019s \nstabilization measures. It is expected to reaccelerate to 5.8% \nin 2021 on higher investment and further gains in agriculture \nand industry from structural reform (Figure 3.8.7). Risks to \nstability remain from persistent inflation.\n\nOn the supply side, price liberalization for wheat and cotton \n\nand structural reform to production are expected to expand \ncrop production, boosting agriculture by 2.5% in 2020 and \n3.0% in 2021. Growth in industry will slow to 5.0% in 2020 as \nmining and quarrying output is expected to be curtailed by \nCOVID-19 and lower external demand and prices for natural \ngas and copper. With government plans to improve production \ninfrastructure and enterprise export potential, industry is \nprojected to grow by 7.0% 2021, reflecting higher domestic and \nforeign demand and further trade liberalization. Construction \nis expected to expand by 17.0% in 2020 and 15.0% in 2021 on \nhousing reform and urban infrastructure development. Higher \nwages and pensions and ongoing reform in transport and finance \nshould sustain growth in trade, transport, and banking. Thus, \nservices are expected to increase by 4.0% in 2020 and 5.5% \nin 2021, despite possible fallout in the tourism sector in the \naftermath of the global COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOn the demand side, investment will remain the key growth \ndriver, as government programs to develop urban infrastructure \nand upgrade manufacturing facilities should maintain high rates \nof fixed capital formation in 2020 and 2021. Periodic increases \nin wages coupled with slowing inflation should support private \nconsumption in 2020\u20132021 despite the adverse effect on \nremittances of currency depreciation in the Russian Federation. \nNet exports will remain negative.\n\nFigure   3.8.5\u2002 Current account components\n\nIncome\nServices\nNet exports of goods and services\nCurrent account balance\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure   3.8.6\u2002 Gross international reserves\n\nLevel\n\n$ billion\n\nImport Cover\n\nMonths of  imports\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB Estimates.\n\n$ billion\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nTable 3.8.1\u2002 Selected economic  \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20025.4\n\n17.5\n\n\u20137.1\n\n\u20025.6\n\n14.6\n\n\u20134.2\n\n\u20024.7\n\n13.0\n\n\u20134.0\n\n\u20025.8\n\n10.0\n\n\u20133.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: State Statistics Committee; ADB estimates.\n\n\f174(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInflation is anticipated slowing to 13.0% in 2020 and 10.0% \n\nFigure   3.8.7\u2002 GDP growth\n\nin 2021 (Figure 3.8.8). This reflects a gradual central bank \nshift toward inflation targeting and an expected halving of \ncredit growth to 25.0% in 2020 and 20.0% in 2021 through \nfiscal tightening coupled with joint efforts by fiscal and \nmonetary authorities to reform policy-guided lending. However, \nplanned price hikes for electricity and natural gas and further \nderegulation of prices in agriculture will maintain inflationary \npressures. \n\nBroad money is anticipated to grow by 12.0% in 2020 and \n11.0% in 2021 (Figure 3.8.9). In 2020, the central bank and the \nMinistry of Finance will jointly start reforming preferential \nlending, and by the end of 2021 all interest rates on loans will be \nat or above the central bank policy rate. To mitigate the adverse \nimpact of slower credit growth on firms, banks are advised to \nrelend credit accrued during the credit boom in 2018\u20132019 to \nefficient investment projects. In anticipation of price hikes for \nelectricity and natural gas and their impact on inflation, the \ncentral bank kept the policy rate at 16.0% after its meeting on 5 \nMarch 2020 despite an expected slowing of inflation. However, \nthe policy rate could decline if inflationary pressures and \nexpectations diminish.\n\nThe consolidated fiscal deficit is projected equal to 0.5% \nof GDP in 2020, moving to a small surplus of 0.1% of GDP in \n2021, while the overall fiscal deficit is expected to shrink to \n2.7% of GDP in 2020 and 2.1% in 2021, financed by domestic \nand external borrowing (Figure 3.8.10). A cut in the VAT rate \nto 15.0% is projected to reduce consolidated budget revenue \nfrom 27.9% of GDP in 2019 to 24.3% in 2020 before it edges back \nto 24.6% in 2021. Expenditure is projected at 24.8% of GDP \nin 2020 and 24.5% in 2021, with outlays favoring education, \nhealth care, social protection, public services, and capital \nspending for agriculture, irrigation, and tourism infrastructure. \nPotentially, the response to COVID-19 may require higher public \nexpenditure, with implications for the country\u2019s fiscal position. \nThe current account deficit is forecast to narrow further, \nto 4.0% in 2020 and 3.5% in 2021, as the expected halving of \ncredit expansion slows growth in imports of capital goods \n(Figure 3.8.11). Exports of natural gas and copper are expected \nto decline in 2020, offset by higher gold exports. In 2021, exports \nshould expand with structural reform in agriculture, improved \ninfrastructure for services and industry, and higher external \ndemand for natural gas. \n\nTo contain rapid growth in external debt, the Ministry of \nFinance has limited external borrowing under public guarantees \nto $4.0 billion in 2020, and disbursements under external loans \nto $1.5 billion. Public external debt is nevertheless expected to \nreach the equivalent of 29.5% of GDP at the end of 2020 and \n32.0% in 2021 (Figure 3.8.12).

The government \neliminated a regime of multiple exchange rates, liberalized \ncapital movement, streamlined procedures to facilitate trade \nwith neighbors, and began deregulating prices for electricity, \nnatural gas, bread, and cotton. Reform was partly to blame \nfor inflation surging from 8.8% in 2016 to 17.5% in 2018 before \nslowing to 14.6% in 2019. The government faces the challenge \nof containing double-digit inflation to mitigate the adverse \nimpact of structural reform on the population, 11.4% of whom \nlive below the national poverty line. It must do so despite \nexpected further adjustments to regulated prices and increases \nin import tariffs on such basic foodstuffs such as sugar, \nwheat, and edible oil. The dangers of high inflation include \ndiscouraging investors and undermining people\u2019s willingness to \nsave in the banking system. \n\nTo contain inflation, the central bank has instituted an \ninflation-targeting regime to attain single-digit inflation in \n2021 and 5% inflation in 2023. It adopts a base rate and interest \nrate corridor and open market operations. In addition, the \ncentral bank board has doubled to eight the number of annual \nmeetings on the policy rate. Commercial banks will play a role \nas market makers in foreign exchange, and the central bank \nwill further improve its market intervention methods using \nderivatives such as swaps, options, and futures. In 2020, the \ncentral bank and the Ministry of Finance began to unsegment \nthe credit market by reforming preferential lending, with all \nlending to be based on market rates by the end of 2021. The \ncentral bank further aims to strengthen its macroeconomic \nanalysis and forecasting and scrutinize firms\u2019 and individuals\u2019 \ninflationary expectations, while continually communicating \nmonetary policy to the public. \n\nGrowth in state budget spending is projected to slow to \n11.0% in 2020, and the cut in the VAT rate from 20% to 15% in \n2019 is expected to have a lagged impact in slowing inflation. \nIn addition, the Ministry of Finance plans to reduce external \nborrowing and keep total external debt below 45% of GDP over \nthe medium term. The government will further pursue a policy \nof developing infrastructure to expand agricultural production \nand storage capacity, and improve logistics for agriculture and \n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure   3.8.10\u2002 Fiscal components\n\nConsolidated \ufb01scal balance\n\nRevenues\nExpenditures\n\n% of GDP\n30\n\n% of GDP\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure   3.8.11\u2002 Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nForecast\n\nEstimate\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure   3.8.12\u2002 Public external debt\n\n% of GDP\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\n\f176(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nfood, which should ease seasonal shortages and price swings \nfor vegetables, meat, and cereals. \n\nIt is critical to strengthen the transmission of monetary \npolicy by further consolidating the credit market. The fiscal \nand monetary authorities should avoid market-distorting loans \nwith preferential rates to households and firms. While price \nadjustments for electricity and other utilities to eliminate past \ndistortions are inevitable in structural reform, the authorities \nshould smooth these adjustments with targeted offsets to \nmitigate their impacts on the poor and improved service \nquality to boost productivity and limit rises in production \ncosts. This requires accelerating reform in utilities such as \nstate-owned electricity suppliers. \n\nCurbing inflation also requires measures to address a lack \n\nof competition in transportation, education, and health care. \nThe government should move to facilitate competition by \npromoting private sector involvement in these industries and \nby strengthening the institutional and regulatory capacity of \nthe State Antimonopoly Committee. Finally, slowing inflation \nrequires tackling administrative barriers that escalate costs \nfor imports of consumption and intermediary goods, in \nparticular food and construction materials.

Growth moderation \ndeepened as civil unrest took a huge toll on investment \nsentiment, private consumption, and tourism-dependent \nbusinesses, especially in the second half of the year. This dealt \na severe blow to the economy already undermined by a global \neconomic slowdown and trade conflict between the US and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n\nDomestic demand weakened significantly in 2019. Falling by \n1.1% in real terms in 2019, private consumption recorded its first \ndecline in 16 years and subtracted 0.8 percentage points from \ngrowth. The volume of retail sales fell by 12.3%, and the value \nof restaurant receipts by 5.9% (Figure 3.9.2). Fixed investment \nrecorded its biggest drop in 2 decades, at 12.3%, subtracting \n2.6 percentage points from growth. Machinery and equipment \nacquisition and intellectual property licensing plunged by \n20.0%, while expenditure on buildings and construction fell by \n6.1%. Meanwhile, new public services and higher allocations for \nexisting ones pushed government consumption expenditure up \nby 5.1%, contributing 0.5 percentage points to growth. \n\nExports reversed 3.5% growth in 2018 to fall by 4.7% in real \n\nterms in 2019 amid a global economic slowdown and further \nslackening of manufacturing and trade worldwide. Exports to \nthe US worsened sharply to a double-digit decline in 2019 as US \ndemand for imports from the PRC moderated.

Exports of financial, business, and other services \nalso fell as cross-border financial and commercial activities \nweakened. Meanwhile, imports of goods and services were \nseverely hit by weakening domestic demand and plummeted \nmore sharply than exports, by 6.8% (Figure 3.9.4). The upshot \nwas net exports adding 2.3 percentage points to growth.\n\nOn the supply side, most sectors saw a significant decline in \nthe first 3 quarters of 2019 as they suffered under the prevailing \nmalaise. The exceptions were agriculture, fishing, mining, and \nquarrying, which narrowed their combined contraction from \n2.9% in the first 3 quarters of 2018 to 0.2%; information and \ncommunications, which expanded by 5.4%; and real estate, \nprofessional, and business services, which grew by 1.4%. Import \nand export, wholesale, and retail trade services were severely \nhit by the unrest, reversing 5.3% growth to plummet by 5.3%. \nAccommodation and food services were also badly buffeted in \nthe first 3 quarters of last year, plummeting from 7.0% growth \nin the same period in 2018 to contraction by 4.0%. Growth in \nthe entire services sector fell from 3.5% in the first 3 quarters \nof 2018 to 0.4% in real terms. Manufacturing output growth \nalso slowed, from 1.3% to 0.7%, in response to a weak external \nenvironment. Construction registered the biggest decline, \nreversing 5.4% growth in the first 3 quarters of 2018 to fall by \n5.8%. \n\nHeadline consumer price inflation accelerated from an \naverage of 2.4% in 2018 to 2.9% in 2019 as pressures on food \nprices continued to build, led by the disrupted supply of fresh \npork owing mainly to an outbreak of African swine fever in the \nPRC (Figure 3.9.5). Netting out the effects of all government \none-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate rose from \nan average of 2.6% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019. Average residential \nproperty prices rose by 1.5%, while residential rents retreated \nby 5.2% in December from their recent peak in August.\n\nThe current account surplus widened to equal 6.4% of GDP \n\nin the first 3 quarters of 2019, almost doubling a 3.3% surplus \nin the same period of 2018. This reflected a narrower trade \ndeficit and slight increase in net inflow of primary income, \npartly offset by a lower services surplus. The overall balance of \npayments turned around a deficit equal to 0.8% of GDP in the \nfirst 3 quarters of 2018 to record a surplus equal to 0.1% of GDP \nin the same period of 2019.

Revenues from profit tax, salaries tax, and \nstamp duties declined significantly under subdued economic \nconditions, enhanced tax concessions, and deferred tax \nassessment cycles.\n\nMonetary conditions remained broadly accommodative \nin 2019. Following a US interest rate cut in October, the Hong \nKong Monetary Authority reduced its base rate by 25 basis \npoints to 2.0% to support the local dollar peg against the US \ndollar. Domestic credit grew by 7.1% in December, and the \nbroad money supply (M2) rose by 2.8% (Figure 3.9.7). Reflecting \nongoing unrest and softening global growth, the local stock \nmarket exhibited considerable volatility last year. The Hang \nSeng Index fell by 12.1% from May to September 2019, but, \nspurred by the phase-one trade deal between the US and PRC, \nrebounded in December to rise 9.1% higher than in December \n2018 (Figure 3.9.8).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP is projected to contract further by 3.3% in 2020 as the \neconomy faces significant downward pressure from faltering \ndomestic and external demand (Figure 3.9.9). The adverse \nimpact of persistent unrest will continue to dampen consumer \nspending and investor sentiment. The COVID-19 outbreak \nwill weigh on already weak private consumption and inbound \ntourism, evidenced by sharp contraction in retail sales and \nservices receipts. The composite purchasing managers\u2019 index \nremained contractionary at 46.8 in January and plunged further \nto 33.1 in February as the COVID-19 threat snowballed, signaling \nthe sharpest deterioration of private sector conditions in more \nthan 2 decades (Figure 3.9.10). Moreover, business surveys in the \nfirst quarter of 2020 remained pessimistic and suggested broad \nand continued deterioration in investor sentiment. \n\nThe labor market has started to weaken, with the \nunemployment rate rising from 2.8% in June to 3.3% in \nDecember. Given soft global trade, weighed down by growth \nmoderation in the PRC and several other key partners, \nexports are unlikely to rise this year. In mid-January 2020, \nbusiness sentiment in the service sector remained pessimistic, \nbut services will continue to be the main driver of growth, \nsupported by trade-related and professional activities. Assuming \nthat unrest subsides and the impact of COVID-19 is contained, \ngradual recovery is forecast for all sectors later this year and \nnext year, with growth forecast at 3.5% in 2021, buttressed by \nexpansionary fiscal measures and recovery in demand, both \ndomestic and external. \n\nHeadline consumer price inflation is forecast to average \n2.0% in 2020 and 2.5 in 2021 (Figure 3.9.11).

Meanwhile, operating \nexpenditure, which increased by 22.2% in FY2019, is estimated \nto grow further by 16.9% as the government labors to stimulate \nthe economy. Recurrent expenditure on education, social \nwelfare, and health care is expected to absorb some 60% of \ngovernment recurrent expenditure. Fiscal reserves, which \nequaled 22 months of government expenditure at the beginning \nof FY2020, will drop to 16 months of expenditure by the end of \nMarch 2021. In the medium term, fiscal reserves are forecast to \napproximate 26.5% of GDP, equal to 15 months of government \nexpenditure.\n\nSharp growth moderation in the PRC beyond earlier \nforecasts will substantially slash external demand, and the \nremaining uncertainty spawned by the US\u2013PRC trade conflict \nwill dent export growth. Imports are likely to be restrained \nas well by weak domestic demand. The trade deficit will likely \nnarrow, as will the surplus in the services account with tourist \narrivals falling further under the current domestic situation \nand recent developments pertaining to the COVID-19 outbreak. \nOn the upside, the US\u2013PRC phase-one trade deal may improve \nglobal economic sentiment in the short run, providing lift to \nexternal trade for Hong Kong, China. On balance, the current \naccount surplus is forecast to equal 7.0% of GDP this year and, \nas exports and services receipts recover in 2021, narrow to 5.0% \n(Figure 3.9.12).\n\nThe two main downside risks to the outlook are deepening \npublic dissatisfaction and the sharp global economic downturn \ncaused by COVID-19. If local tensions in the city persist, \nconfidence in the economy from foreign investors and local \nresidents alike will dampen further, adding downward pressure \nto private consumption and investment, worsening labor market \npressures, and lowering output. Meanwhile, the economy\u2019s \ngeographical proximity and close economic ties with the PRC \nheighten the potential economic impact posed by the COVID-19 \nhealth crisis, weighing severely on private consumption, \ninbound tourism, investment, and perhaps even forcing business \nclosures.

High income \ninequality and relative poverty can have severe repercussions \non the political and social environment, and growing evidence \nsupports the view that they damage economic performance as \nwell. The challenge for policy makers in Hong Kong, China is to \nadopt appropriate measures to address these issues. \n\nAccording to World Bank data, gross national income per \ncapita in Hong Kong, China increased nearly ninefold from the \nearly 1980s to 2018, reaching $50,300 ($67,810 when adjusted \nfor purchasing power parity) and ranking it the fourteenth \nhighest in the world (tenth in PPP terms). Meanwhile, data from \nthe Standardized World Income Inequality Database indicate \nthat the net Gini index, a widely used index of inequality based \non disposable income after taxes and social transfers, worsened \nsteadily from 0.37 in the early 1960s to 0.41 in 2016, which is \neven further removed from the average of 0.31 for wealthy \ncountries worldwide and less equal than in other advanced \neconomies in Asia (Figure 3.9.13). Moreover, a large share of \nthe population appears not to be sharing fully in the benefits \nof prosperity. Median household income excluding foreign \ndomestic workers grew moderately by 59.3% over the past \ndecade. According to the 2018 Hong Kong Poverty Situation \nReport 2018, 613,000 households had incomes below the official \npoverty line in 2018, based on monthly household income \nbefore any government intervention, the cutoff set at 50% of \nthe median household income adjusted by household size. This \nyielded a poverty rate of 20.4%, the highest since 2010. Taking \ninto account recurrent government cash handouts, the poverty \nrate falls to 14.9% for all households but only 8.0% for working \nhouseholds. This suggests that generating more employment for \nthe poor is the most effective policy against income disparity. \nIn the short term, additional redistributive measures can \nhelp, but a sustainable solution to the multifaceted problems \nassociated with income inequality can come only from the \ncreation of more stable employment in the formal sector. \nSuch employment helps build solid foundations for social \ndevelopment and promotes civic engagement and a healthier \neconomic and political environment. These objectives cannot be \nattained by income redistribution alone.

Increasing \nthe rate at which good jobs are created is key to a long-term \nstrategy to reduce inequality and achieve inclusive growth. \n\nBoosting the number of good jobs requires improvements \nin labor productivity, a necessary prerequisite for higher real \nwages, and the provision of more stable employment and better \nworking conditions. In this respect, the local policy toolkit \nalready includes several useful measures. Subsidies encourage \nand enable small and medium-sized enterprises to innovate \ntoward greater use of labor-complementing technologies, as \nopposed to labor-substituting technologies. Tax incentives \nreward research and development. And major public co-work \nspaces and incubators foster a startup-friendly environment, in \nwhich the number of startups expanded from 2,625 in 2018 to \n3,184 in 2019.\n\nLabor market policies and training programs should focus \n\non upgrading skills in the current and future labor force. Set \nup by the government in 2002, the Continuing Education Fund \nprovides subsidies to adults who study to improve their work \nskills. Statutory bodies, including the Employees Retraining \nBoard and the Vocational Training Council, play integral roles \nin the provision of market-oriented training and retraining \nservices. The one-off Love Upgrading Special Scheme, launched \nin October 2019, provides skills-enhancing assistance free of \ncharge to underemployed or recently unemployed workers \nwith courses across 23 industries and generic skills. Eligible \ngraduates receive follow-up placement services for 3\u20136 months. \nThe Researcher Programme for holders of bachelor and \nmaster\u2019s degrees, and the Postdoctoral Hub for PhDs, aim to \nencourage these highly educated beneficiaries to pursue careers \nin innovation and technology. These initiatives provide funding \nto Cyberport, the Hong Kong Science Park, and a number of \nstartups and technology companies to employ local university \ngraduates and researchers in research and development \nprojects. Both programs have received additional funding in the \nbudget for FY2020.\n\nThe challenge for policy makers in Hong Kong, China is \nto meld these initiatives into a comprehensive and effective \nstrategy to generate good jobs for an increasing number \nof workers, by bolstering measures that work, revising or \ndiscarding the ones that do not, and continuing to innovate the \npolicy toolkit to adjust to a fast-changing global economic and \ntechnological environment. The prospects for gradually more \ninclusive growth in Hong Kong, China in the future depend in \nlarge part on the success of this strategy.\n\n\fMongolia\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  2019  as  mining  slumped  and  export  expansion  moderated.  Inflation \nedged  up,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed.  Growth  is  expected  to  fall  sharply \nin  2020  because  of  COVID-19  but  rebound  in  2021  as  the  outbreak  subsides.  In  2020, \nthe  current  account  deficit  will  widen  as  inflation  moderates,  then  2021  will  reverse  both \ntrends.  Mongolia  faces  the  policy  challenge  of  strengthening  policy  credibility  to  ensure \nfinancial  stability  in  these  uncertain  and  turbulent  times.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economic expansion that began in 2017 reached its peak \nin late 2018. Lower contributions from mining, transportation \nand manufacturing dragged growth down to 5.1% in 2019 from \n7.2% in 2018. The contribution of mining to growth declined by \n1.8 percentage points as output was lower for gold, copper, zinc, \nand fluorspar. This spilled over into other sectors, pushing down \nthe contribution of services to 2.7 points and of other industry \nto 1.2 points, for a combined drop of 0.6 points from 2018. \nAgriculture grew by 8.1% as both crops and livestock output \nrose, contributing 1.2 points (Figure 3.10.1).\n\nOn the demand side, investment contributed 6.9 percentage \n\npoints to growth, an increase of 0.6 points from 2018 as \ngovernment capital expenditure increased by 75.3%\u2014and \ndespite stabilized net foreign direct investment. Fueled by rising \nnominal incomes and recourse to credit from nonbank financial \ninstitutions, private consumption contributed 6.8 percentage \npoints to growth, while government consumption added \nanother 1.8 points. Net exports continued to be a major drag on \ngrowth, subtracting 10.4 points (Figure 3.10.2).\n\nAverage inflation increased by 0.5 percentage points to 7.3% \n\nin 2019.

The structural balance \nfell from a surplus equal to a scant 0.04% of GDP in 2018 to a \ndeficit of 1.7%, which was less than the deficit approved by the \nparliament (Figure 3.10.5). Public debt including central bank \nexternal liabilities fell by 5.4 percentage points to equal 79.1% of \nGDP.\n\nThe central bank maintained positive real interest rates \nthroughout the year, imposed consumer loan restrictions on \nbanks, increased risk weights on loans denominated in US \ndollars, required conservation buffers for tier-1 capital from \nsystemically important banks, and increased the US dollar \nreserve requirement ratio by 3 percentage points to 15%. Broad \nmoney growth slowed from 22.8% in 2018 to 7.0% last year on \nsharply lower credit growth, down from 25.8% in 2018 to 4.9%. \nNonperforming and overdue loans rose to 14.3% of the total \n(Figure 3.10.6).\n\nBased on the central bank balance of payments data, the \n\ncurrent account deficit shrank by 17.8% to equal 13.1% of \nGDP and was fully financed by net inflow of foreign direct \ninvestment (Figure 3.10.7). The merchandise trade surplus rose \nby 69.1% as export growth at 9.1% outpaced import growth \nat 2.2%. The deficit in the service account fell by 17.1% as \ntransportation, tourism, and other service receipts increased. \nDespite continued trade tensions between the US and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) dampening commodity market \nexpectations, PRC demand for coking coal and iron ore soared, \nand these two commodities accounted for 86.0% of Mongolia\u2019s \nexport growth. By contrast, copper exports decreased by 10.7%, \nmainly from lower prices. Foreign exchange reserves grew to \n$4.4 billion or cover for 5.8 months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is forecast to decelerate sharply to 2.1% in 2020 \ndespite a higher contribution from agriculture thanks to \nfavorable weather (Figure 3.10.8). The slowdown became \napparent in the second half of 2019, when fourth quarter growth \ndipped to 2.2%, making it the slowest quarter since the third \nquarter of 2016. Reduced demand for raw materials and lower \ncommodity prices caused by the PRC slowdown, and now the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, will reduce exports of coal, copper, iron ore, \nzinc, and crude oil, pushing growth down further. The outbreak, \nhaving brought a sudden temporary stop to coal exports to the \nPRC and caused a significant drop in passenger transport, will \nreduce value added in mining and dampen expansion in other \nareas. Growth will recover to 4.6% in 2021 as growth rebounds \nin the PRC and trade tensions and COVID-19 concerns ease, \n\nFigure 3.10.3\u2002Inflation\n\nFood\nNonfood\nConsumer price index\n12-month average\nThe BOM Target\n\n% \n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n\u20136\n\n\u201312\n\nMNT/$\n\n2,900\n\n2,600\n\n2,300\n\n2,000\n\n1,700\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2020 \nStatistical Information Services. http://1212.mn; Parliament \nresolution on monetary policy guidelines for 2013\u20132018; \nADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.10.4\u2002Exchange rate\n\nMonthly average\nexchange rate\n\nCentral bank bills\n\n% of M2\n\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nSources: Bank of Mongolia. 2020 Monthly statistical \nbulletin and banking sector consolidated balance sheet.\n\nTable 3.10.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20027.2 \u2002\u20025.1 \u2002\u20022.1 \u2002\u20024.6\n\nInflation\n\n\u2002\u20026.8 \u2002\u20027.3 \u2002\u20026.6 \u2002\u20027.9\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\n\u201316.8 \u201313.1 \u201313.9 \u2002\u20137.8\n\nSources: National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2020 \nStatistical Information Services. http://1212.mn; ADB \nestimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nMongolia\u2002\u2002187\n\nallowing recovery in coking coal exports, and as ore quality and \noutput improve at the Oyu Tolgoi mineral deposit.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak likely means that record \n\nexpenditure planned under the 2020 budget will not be realized, \nso contributions from government consumption and investment \nto growth are expected to decline.

These policy \ndisruptions have been hugely damaging, causing debt-servicing \ncosts to spiral by a factor of 7.8 from 2012 to 2016. \n\nMongolia now has an opportunity to buck this trend by \ndemonstrating that the latest macroeconomic improvement is \nnot just a flash in the pan but part of a new macroeconomic \npolicy framework that will be strictly followed to tackle \noutstanding macroeconomic challenges. Robust positive swings \nin primary and structural balances in recent years should be \nmaintained through strict adherence to the Fiscal Stability Law. \nFiscal policy should be consistent with broad macroeconomic \nobjectives and responsible public debt management, \ncontinuously building buffers through rising primary surpluses. \nBudget planning, forecasting, and approval should be more \nrealistic, and fiscal policy should be countercyclical. Policies on \nreprioritizing spending and implementing stimulus packages \nshould be designed with these issues in mind, to avoid possible \nfiscal cliffs, better manage cycles of boom and bust, and create \nfiscal space to boost human development and growth.\n\nFurther, the government should absorb excessive togrog \nliquidity by issuing medium-term government securities to \nfinance public investment. This would ease pressure on the \nexchange rate, which has built up from market expectations and \nexcess togrog deployed only in short-term central bank bills. \nAlso useful would be to issue securities with various maturities \nto recreate the togrog benchmark yield curve abandoned in 2017 \nand thereby facilitate the pricing of private securities. Foreign \nexchange reserves should be accumulated opportunistically\u2014\nthat is, carried out through occasional central bank \ninterventions in the foreign exchange market to smooth large \nfluctuations in the exchange rate or effect monetary policy. \nExporters should be able to sell their foreign exchange holdings \nfreely on the market and not solely to the central bank. \n\ninflation, which tends to persist in Mongolia and be highly \ndisruptive, by building strategic reserves of consumer staples. \nThese policies should be buttressed by ensuring financial sector \nstability and its smooth functioning, which requires effective \ncontrol to stop excessive risk-taking by financial institutions \nand measures to facilitate interbank and securities transactions. \nThese controls are necessary to raise confidence in the economy \nand encourage capital inflow to finance a potentially large \ngap in the external accounts.

Real growth in household \nincome moderated to 5.8%, and in consumption expenditure to \n5.5%, each down by 0.7 percentage points from 2018. Similarly, \nreal growth in retail sales of consumer goods decelerated \nfrom 6.9% in 2018 to 6.0% in 2019, mostly owing to a decline \nin car sales, which were down by 0.8% from 2018, and \nmoderation in growth of property-related purchases such\u00a0as \nhousehold appliances, furniture, and decoration materials. \nRural households\u2019 real income and consumption expenditure \nincreased faster than those of urban residents, reflecting \ngovernment efforts to revitalize rural areas and the expansion \nof online shopping (Figure 3.11.3). \n\nThe contribution of investment to growth fell from \n2.8\u00a0percentage points in 2018 to 1.9 points in 2019 because \nof the sharp deceleration in manufacturing investment as \ndomestic demand softened, profits declined, overcapacity in \nsome upstream industries continued to be cut, and external \ndemand deteriorated (Figure 3.11.4).

However, as local \ngovernments issued virtually no new special bonds in October\u2013\nDecember 2019, growth in infrastructure investment declined \nby about 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter (Q4) of \n2019, dragging infrastructure investment growth down to \nonly 3.8% in the whole year. Meanwhile, growth in real estate \ninvestment, comprising land purchases and new construction, \naccelerated marginally from 9.5% in 2018 to 9.9% in 2019. \n\nNet exports reversed their 0.5 percentage point drag on \ngrowth in 2018 to contribute 0.7 points in 2019 as merchandise \nimports declined. This mostly reflected lower imports of \ninvestment goods such as machinery and electrical equipment \nas domestic demand softened and uncertainty pertaining to \ntrade clouded the outlook for exports, while exports grew only \nmarginally. \n\nOn the supply side, services remained the main driver of \ngrowth, contributing 3.6 percentage points despite moderating \nfrom 8.0% growth in 2018 to 6.9% last year (Figure 3.11.6). \nTransport, financial services, leasing and commercial services, \nand information technology services grew quickly. Growth in \nreal estate services moderated, however, as growth in housing \nsales slowed, and retail sales similarly felt the moderation in \nconsumption expenditure. Robust service sector growth helped \nstabilize the surveyed unemployment rate in cities in a range of \n5.0%\u20135.3% during the year.\n\nconstruction and mining slipped marginally by 0.1 percentage \npoints to 2.2 points as real growth in the sector likewise \nmoderated by 0.1 percentage points to 5.7% in 2019. Strong \nincreases in high tech, mining, and raw materials partly \noffset deceleration in export-oriented manufacturing.

Producer price inflation turned negative \nin July 2019 to average \u20130.3% for the year. Prices for newly \nconstructed homes in the top 70 cities were on average 9.7% \nhigher in 2019 than a year earlier, with price increases more \npronounced in second- and third-tier cities (Figure 3.11.8).\n\nMonetary policy remained largely accommodative in 2019. \n\nSupport for banks and the real economy included several \nrounds of cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for various \ntypes of banks (Figure 3.11.9). In addition, a new pricing \nmechanism was established in August 2019 to reduce financing \ncosts for the real economy and improve the transmission of \nmonetary policy. Under the new mechanism (described in \nADO 2019 Update), banks were required to price most new \nloans according to the applicable loan prime rate, which is \nchiefly linked to the medium-term lending facility rate set by \nthe central bank plus a premium. Under the new mechanism, \nthe 1-year loan prime rate gradually declined from 4.25% on \n20\u00a0August 2019 to 4.05% on 20 February 2020 (Figure 3.11.10).\nBank loans remained the driver of credit growth to the \nreal economy in 2019.

Bank loans outstanding increased by 12.3% \nand government bonds by 14.3%, while shadow bank finance \noutstanding declined by 7.4%. Net special bond issues from \nlocal governments picked up rapidly, as did net corporate bond \nissues, but new equity financing was negligible. Broad money \n(M2) was 8.7% higher at the end of 2019 than a year earlier \n(Figure 3.11.11).\n\nDeficit spending kept fiscal policy expansionary in 2019. \nGeneral government fiscal expenditure grew by 8.1%, more \nthan double 3.8% growth in revenue. Increased spending was \nmost pronounced in education, health care, employment, and \nsocial security, while weaker revenue stemmed from slower \ngrowth, a cut in VAT effective on 1 April 2019, and earlier \nreform to personal income taxes that became effective in \ntwo phases, in October 2018 and January 2019. As a result, \nthe consolidated budget deficit of the central and local \ngovernments reached the equivalent of 4.9% of GDP in 2019 \n(Figure 3.11.12). \n\nTo support the real economy, the government cut taxes \n\nand fees for corporations. In March 2019, it announced \nCNY2\u00a0trillion in cuts to taxes and fees for enterprises.

The government also increased special bond \nissuance to finance infrastructure investment. The full 2019 \nannual quota of CNY2.15 trillion for new local government \nspecial bond issues, equal to 2.2% of GDP, was nearly reached \nby the end of September. In the remainder of 2019, local \ngovernments remained within that quota, despite being \nallowed to continue issuing new special bonds worth up to \nCNY1 trillion by using part of the 2020 quota (Figure 3.11.13).\nThe current account surplus recovered from 0.4% of \nGDP in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019 (Figure 3.11.14). While growth in \nmerchandise trade decelerated in 2019 as the trade conflict \nbetween the US and the PRC persisted, the deficit in the \nservice balance narrowed by 10.6%, reflecting lower outbound \ntourism. Following the imposition of additional US tariffs on \n$351 billion worth of imports from the PRC, export growth \nweakened with a sharp decline in merchandise exports to \nthat market (Figure 3.11.15). A decline in merchandise imports \nreflected moderating growth in domestic demand, lower \ndemand for investment goods as the escalating trade conflict \nsoured the outlook for exports, and a decline in imports \nfor processing and assembly for reexport. In sum, despite \nmerchandise exports increasing by only 0.5% in 2019, the \nsurplus in the merchandise trade balance expanded to equal \n3.3% of GDP as imports declined by 2.7%. \n\nA phase-one agreement reached with the US in \n\nmid-December 2019 brought a stop to new tariffs and reduced \nrates in some bilateral tariffs imposed earlier. The trade \nconflict had an adverse impact on foreign direct investment \n(FDI). Net FDI narrowed by half from the equivalent of 0.8% of \nGDP in 2018 to 0.4% in 2019 as investor confidence waivered. \nIn 2019, FDI inflow declined by 23.0%, outflow by only 1.1%.\nThe renminbi came under downward pressure while \n\nofficial reserves stayed broadly stable. The renminbi \ndepreciated by 1.7% in nominal terms per US dollar, from \nCNY6.86 at the end of 2018 to CNY6.98 by the end of 2019 \n(Figure 3.11.16). Depreciation was driven primarily by \nheightened uncertainty and a deteriorating outlook for the \ndomestic economy. An increase in unregistered capital outflow, \nproxied by errors and omissions in the balance of payments, \nmirrored depreciation pressure on the renminbi, with \nunregistered outflow nearly doubling to the equivalent of 1.6% \nof GDP in the first 3 quarters of 2019 from 0.9% in the same \nperiod of 2018. Official reserves increased by $54.9 billion in \n2019 and stood at $3.22 trillion by year-end.\n\nFigure 3.11.9\u2002 Reserve requirement ratios \n\nfor financial institutions\n\nLarge banks\nMedium-sized banks\nSmall banks\n\n%\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n%\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n48\n\n36\n\n24\n\n12\n\n0\n\n\u201312\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nFigure 3.11.10\u2002 Bank lending and policy rates\n\nLending rate, weighted average\n\n1-year loan prime rate\n1-year medium-term lending facility rate\n7-day central bank reverse repurchase rate\n\nJan\n2016\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; National Interbank \nFunding Center.\n\nFigure 3.11.11\u2002 Growth in broad money, credit \noutstanding, and government \nbonds outstanding\n\nBroad money (M2)\nTotal social \ufb01nancing\nBank loans\nShadow banking\nGovernment bonds\n\n% year on year\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nNote: Shadow banking comprises entrust loans, \ntrust\u00a0loans, and banks\u2019 acceptance bills.\nSources: People\u2019s Bank of China; ADB estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002193\n\nEconomic prospects\nCOVID-19 exploded in January and February 2020, disrupting \nbusiness in the PRC and upending earlier economic forecasts \n(Figure 3.11.17). The outbreak became a demand shock as \npeople stayed home. It became a supply shock as companies \nsuffered shortages of labor, with migrants unable to return \nto work from the Lunar New Year holiday, and of materials \nas supply chains faltered. Though the government took \nseveral measures to alleviate the impact on the economy \n(Box 3.11.1), economic indicators for January\u2013February 2020 \nsignal sharp GDP contraction in the Q1 of 2020 (Figure\u00a03.11.1). \nWith substantial fiscal and monetary policy support, \neconomic growth should recover in the remainder of 2020. \nNotwithstanding some local finetuning, restrictions on the \nhousing market are unlikely to be relaxed substantially. \nRestrictions on shadow banking and pollution controls will \nbe sustained. GDP growth is now expected to average 2.3% in \n2020 and then bounce back to 7.3% in 2021 (Figure 3.11.18). \nOn the demand side, consumption is expected to remain \na driver of growth despite COVID-19. Consumer staples are \nexpected to hold up fairly well, but discretionary consumer \nspending will likely take a hit as growth in household income \ndecelerates in 2020, higher prices for daily necessities weigh \non purchasing power, and housing market moderation drags on \nproperty-related spending. Government spending, especially \non health care, is expected to increase further to support the \neconomy this year and then grow moderately in 2021. \n\nInfrastructure investment is expected to pick up from Q2, \n\nreflecting an increase in new local government special bond \nissues in early 2020 (Figure 3.11.13). Government support for \nhigh technology and continued industrial upgrading should \nhelp stabilize investment in manufacturing. At the same time, \nCOVID-19 has deepened uncertainty about manufacturing \ninvestment, the investment category that plummeted furthest \nin January\u2013February 2020 (Figure 3.11.4). Growth in real \nestate investment will likely moderate in the whole of 2020 \nas weak construction in Q1 is unlikely to be fully caught up in \nthe remainder of the year. As imports of goods and services \nare expected to decline faster than exports, the contribution \nof net exports to growth is projected to stay positive in 2020 \nbut to drag on growth in 2021 as imports outpace exports. The \ncurrent account surplus is expected to increase in 2020 before \nnarrowing in 2021. \n\nOn the supply side, services will be hit hard by sharp \n\ndeceleration in domestic consumption. Value added in financial \nservices should grow solidly on increased bank profits from \nexpanded lending, but COVID-19 will hammer other services, \nespecially wholesale and retail trade, accommodation, \ntransportation, and entertainment. This trend is expected \nto reverse as COVID-19 comes under control and these \n\nFigure 3.11.12\u2002 General government fiscal \n\nrevenue and expenditure\n\nRevenue\nExpenditure\n\n% change year on year\n24\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\nQ1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nGDP = gross domestic product, Q = quarter.\nSources: Ministry of Finance; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.11.13\u2002 Local government \nspecial\u00a0bond issues\n\nNew issuance\nReplacement or\nre\ufb01nancing \n\nCNY billion\n\nNew issuance,\nyear to date\n\n% of annual quota\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n100\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\nJan\n2019\n\nApr\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nJan\n2020\n\nNote: The annual quota for new local government special \nbond issues in 2020 has yet to be approved. \nSources: Ministry of Finance; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.11.14\u2002Balance of payments\n\nErrors and omissions\nNet capital \ufb02ows other than FDI\nNet FDI\nCurrent account balance\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n$ billion\n\n150\n\n75\n\n0\n\n-75\n\n-150\n\n-225\n\nQ1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3\n2016\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2017\n\nFDI = foreign direct investment, Q = quarter.\nNote: For Q4 2019, only data on the current account and \nFDI is available.\u00a0\nSources: State Administration of Foreign Exchange; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\f194(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nBox 3.11.1\u2002Measures to counter the economic impact of COVID-19\n\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak spread in late January\u00a02020, \nthe authorities aimed to contain it by extending the Lunar \nNew Year vacation, for which people traditionally return \nto their hometowns. This meant that production could \nrestart only gradually as workers belatedly trickled back to \nwork. Tourism suffered as group tours were cancelled, as \ndid restaurants and other entertainment venues as people \navoided crowds. In addition to epidemic prevention-and-\ncontrol measures, the central and local governments acted \nto protect the economy, notably with the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n On 5 February, the State Council announced targeted \ntax cuts for some industries\u2014including medical \nsuppliers, public transportation, logistics, and home \nservices\u2014and waived the registration fee for drugs \nand medical equipment needed to contain the virus.\n On 11 February, the State Council increased the \nfront-loaded local government bond quota by \nCNY848 billion, bringing the preapproved quota to \nCNY1,848 billion: CNY1,290 billion for special bonds \nand CNY558 billion for general bonds.\n On 19 February, the State Council suspended \nemployers\u2019 social insurance contributions to cover \npensions, unemployment, and vocational injury and \ndeferred the collection of housing provident funds. \nThis excepted all companies in Hubei and small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the PRC \nfrom February to June and, for larger companies \noutside of Hubei, waived half of the payments \nfrom February to April. In addition, employers\u2019 \ncontributions to basic medical insurance were halved \nfrom February for up to 5\u00a0months.\n On 25 February, the State Council exempted smaller \ntaxpayers in Hubei from value-added tax and cut \nit from 3% to 1% for those outside Hubei, effective \nfrom 1 March to 31 May, as\u00a0well\u00a0as approved various \nmeasures to support the job\u00a0market.\n On 3 March, the State Council decided that local \ngovernments can retain a bigger proportion of fiscal \nrevenue collected for a certain period of time and \nwill receive faster allotment of transfer payments. \nAlso, further tax and fee cuts will be made to \nlogistics-related services.\n On 5 March, the State Council provided guidance on \nmedical insurance reform that, among other things, \nmandated special medical insurance payment policies \nto ensure that, during major epidemics, medical \ninstitutions treat patients before charging fees.\n\n(vii)   On 12 March, the Ministry of Commerce said it \n\nwould improve export tax rebate policies, increase \nforeign trade loans, expand coverage of short-term \nexport credit insurance, and push for lower \ninsurance premiums.\n\n(viii)  On 13 March, the National Development and \n\nReform Commission announced new measures to \nboost consumption, including encouraging local \n\n(ix) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ngovernments that have restricted car purchases to \nincrease the number of license plates available as \nappropriate.\n On 17 March, the National Development and Reform \nCommission said that the central government would \nincrease the quota for local government special \nbond issues and accelerate the development of \ninfrastructure, citing 5G networks and data centers.\n\nMonetary policy measures taken included the following:\n\n On 3 February, the central bank cut 7-day and 14-day \nreverse repo rates by 10 basis points, lowering them \nto 2.40% and 2.55%, respectively. It also injected \nsizable liquidity into the banking\u00a0system.\n On 5 February, the State Council called on banks \nto offer preferential loans at fiscally subsidized \ninterest rates below 1.6% to enterprises that produce, \ntransport, or sell medical supplies and other \nessentials. \n On 9 February, the central bank announced a special \nrelending program to support industries involved in \nepidemic prevention and control with interest rates \nnot higher than 100 basis points below the 1-year \nloan prime rate. A\u00a0quota of CNY300 billion became \navailable on 10\u00a0February for relending to selected \nbanks across 10\u00a0provinces and municipalities.\n On 17 February, the central bank cut the \nmedium-term lending facility rate by 10 basis\u00a0points. \nThe loan prime rate benchmark for pricing bank \nloans fell by the same magnitude to 4.05% on \n20\u00a0February. \n On 25 February, the State Council encouraged banks \nto defer loan payments and increase lending at \nconcessional rates to micro and small enterprises. \nState-owned banks were urged to increase lending to \nthem by 30% in the first half of 2020. The\u00a0relending \nquota through which banks can refinance their \nlending to micro businesses and SMEs from the \ncentral bank will be increased by CNY500 billion. \nPolicy banks will add a special credit quota of \nCNY350 billion for lending to such firms at \npreferential rates.\n On 1 March, the central bank and the banking \nregulator said in a joint statement that all enterprises \nin Hubei with principal or interest due from \n25\u00a0January to 30 June can apply for a delay to the \nend of Q2, as can qualified micro businesses and \nSMEs nationwide.\n\n(vii)   On 13 March, the central bank announced a targeted \ncut in the reserve requirement ratio by 50\u2013100 basis \npoints for banks that have met inclusive financing \ntargets and an additional cut of 100 basis points for \nqualified joint-stock banks. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002195\n\nsubsectors bounce back. Growth in real estate services will \nlikely moderate further in tandem with a less dynamic housing \nmarket. Manufacturing\u2014earlier poised to profit from a \nphase-one trade deal with the US\u2014is now expected to suffer \nlower domestic demand and declining exports. However, \ngovernment support will help high-tech manufacturing and \ninnovative industries continue to grow in both 2020 and 2021. \nDespite lost dynamism in the housing market, construction will \nprofit from increased infrastructure investment, but mining \nis expected to be hit by weaker demand, both domestic and \nexternal. Growth in agriculture, still suffering from African \nswine fever, should gradually stabilize and recover in 2021. \nThe outlook for the labor market remains clouded by \nCOVID-19, which puts tremendous pressure on companies, \nespecially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with \nlittle or no financial reserves. While larger companies and \nstate-owned enterprises are unlikely to lay off workers, \nthis benefit to labor in the short term will likely dent \nfirms\u2019 profitability and further increase corporate debt \n(Figure\u00a03.11.19). \n\nDespite slowing domestic growth and lower global oil \nprices, consumer price inflation is expected to surge in 2020 \nto 3.6% on higher food prices (Figure 3.11.20). Then, with \npork prices having normalized, consumer prices are forecast \nhigher in 2021 by only 1.9%. Some producer prices may rise \ntemporarily because COVID-19 has disrupted some supply \nchains, but slower growth and lower commodity prices should \ndepress producer prices on average in 2020, before they \nincrease moderately in 2021.\n\nMonetary policy is expected to become more \n\naccommodative, with the central bank likely reducing the \nmedium-term lending facility rate to further bring down \nthe loan prime rate. In addition, further targeted cuts to the \nreserve requirement ratio will provide additional liquidity to \nbanks, and the central bank will likely keep liquidity ample \nin the interbank market. Targeted measures include a special \nrelending program for certain industries and SMEs (Box 3.11.1). \nThe central bank may also cut the 1-year benchmark deposit \nrate to bolster banks\u2019 interest margins, which came under \npressure from recent reductions in the loan prime rate. \nShadow banking is unlikely to be unleashed, as this \nwould negate some of the progress made in reducing its \noutstanding amount (Figure 3.11.11). With further room \nto cut policy interest rates, but a difficult environment for \ncorporate bond issues and initial public offerings, financing \nwill increasingly come from financial institutions. Banks\u00a0are \nencouraged to continue lending to keep companies going \nand thereby preventing a sharp rise in unemployment, and \nnot worry too much about nonperforming loans. Despite \ntemporary regulatory forbearance, this will likely mean, \n\nFigure 3.11.15\u2002 Growth in PRC exports, \n\nby region or country, \nand\u00a0imports\n\nGlobal exports\nExports to Southeast Asia\nExports to the United States\nExports to the European Union\nGlobal imports\n\n% year to date\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n104\n\n102\n\n100\n\n98\n\n96\n\n94\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan-Feb\n2020\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: No breakdown by region or country is available for \nthe \ufb01rst 2 months of 2020.\nSources: General Administration of Customs; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\nFigure 3.11.16\u2002  Renminbi exchange rates\n\nReal effective\nNominal effective\n\nJan 2018 = 100\n\nCNY/USD\n\n(inverted scale)\n\n6.2\n\n6.4\n\n6.6\n\n6.8\n\n7.0\n\n7.2\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Bank for International Settlements; People\u2019s Bank \nof China; ADB estimates.\n\nTable 3.11.1\u2002 Selected economic  \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n6.7\n\n2.1\n\n0.4\n\n6.1\n\n2.9\n\n1.3\n\n2.3\n\n3.6\n\n1.6\n\n7.3\n\n1.9\n\n1.2\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: National Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\n\f196(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nat the least, more\u00a0special-mention loans, rated a notch \nabove nonperforming (Figure 3.11.21). A concern is banks \naccumulating credit risk and how to deal with it once the \neconomy has recovered.\n\nPoor access to finance will continue to challenge private \n\nfirms despite government measures in February 2020 to \nincrease lending to SMEs (Box 3.11.1). With many corporate \nbonds coming due from March 2020, private firms seeking \nlonger-term financing in the bond market are in a difficult \nposition. Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises will aim to roll \nover their short-term debt. Sales revenue growth and profits \nin industry already declined notably in 2019 (Figure\u00a03.11.5). \nMany companies may struggle to survive another year of \ndeclining revenue growth and profits in 2020 caused by \nproduction shortfalls or reduced demand for services induced \nby COVID-19. Private SMEs are particularly vulnerable, as they \nenjoy less access to bank loans than do state-owned and other \nlarger companies with better collateral and lower default rates. \nFiscal policy will likely become more supportive, including \na further increase in new local government special bond issues, \nwhich were already higher in early 2020 (Figure 3.11.13). \nWith the government aiming to shore up growth through \ninfrastructure investment, the local government special bond \nquota will very likely be fixed significantly above last year\u2019s \nCNY2.15 trillion. As government spending is expected to \naccelerate while tax revenue suffers from recent temporary \ntax cuts and slower economic growth, the consolidated \nbudget deficit looks set to expand markedly. Despite recent \nefforts by the central government to temporarily support local \ngovernment finances (Box 3.11.1), lower tax revenue will burden \nthe finances of local governments as they are not allowed to \nlevy taxes or incur debt without central government approval, \nlimiting their means to stimulate the local economy. In 2021, \nthe consolidated budget deficit is expected to retreat as growth \nin tax revenue recovers and the increase in public expenditure \nmoderates. \n\nThe current account is forecast to record surpluses equal \nto 1.6% of GDP in 2020 and 1.2% in 2021. Merchandise exports \nand imports are both expected to contract substantially in \n2020 before picking up in 2021. The service deficit is expected \nto shrink notably in 2020 in line with sharply lower outbound \ntourism before widening again in 2021. In terms of capital \nflows, FDI inflow is projected to moderate because COVID-19 \nhas roiled uncertainty stemming from the trade conflict with \nthe US, and FDI outflow will also be lower owing to tight \ncapital controls and weaker domestic growth, limiting the \nfunds available for acquisitions overseas. Despite recently \nincreased global uncertainty and volatility, some portfolio \ninflow is expected to continue as long-term foreign investors \nacquire PRC bonds and stocks to diversify their portfolios, \n\nFigure 3.11.17\u2002 COVID-19 cases in the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\n\nCon\ufb01rmed\nSuspected     \nDeaths\n\nThousands\n\n90\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJan\n19\n\nJan\n29\n\nFeb\n8\n\nFeb\n18\n\nFeb\n28\n\nMar\n9\n\nMar\n16\n\nSource: National Health Commission.\n\nFigure 3.11.18\u2002GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nFigure 3.11.19\u2002Debt structure\n\nHouseholds\nGeneral government\nNon\ufb01nancial corporations\n\n% of GDP\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2016\n\n2019\n\nSource: Bank for International Settlements.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002197\n\nprofiting from the spread between PRC and US bond yields \n(Figure 3.11.22).

The main downside risks come from COVID-19: \na new round of domestic infections or the virus spreading \nglobally could further damage both investor sentiment \nand consumer spending. Another domestic downside risk \nis to credit sustainability, if COVID-19 keeps the economy \nfrom normalizing soon. Either a substantial number of \ncompanies, especially SMEs, would face bankruptcy, or bank \nlending loosened to stabilize growth in the short run would \nburden banks with heightened credit risks. This could cause \nnonperforming loans to spike, undermining financial stability \nand leaving banks in need of recapitalization. Externally, the \ntrade conflict with the US could revive in the absence of a \ndurable deal, generating an additional obstacle to economic \nrecovery.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014further integrating into \nglobal capital markets\nBy increasingly opening its bond and equity markets to foreign \ninvestors in recent years, the PRC has enabled sizable portfolio \ninflow further spurred by its inclusion and increased weighting \nin global indexes. In 2019, the PRC saw financial assets held by \nforeign investors expand by $213.0 billion, including increases \nof $75.0 billion in bond holdings and $133.5 billion in equity \nholdings (Box 3.11.2). This flow could reverse.\n\nWith the current account surplus narrowing in the medium \n\nterm and net FDI inflow moderating, volatility in portfolio \nflows could pose a challenge. Whereas the current account \nsurplus once guaranteed foreign exchange inflow, as did rather \nstable FDI flows most of the time, portfolio flows can reverse \nquickly on changeable market sentiment. Even as the current \naccount surplus declined and net FDI inflow moderated, \nunregistered capital outflow\u2014proxied by errors and omissions \nin the balance of payments\u2014has remained sizeable despite \nstrict capital controls (Figure 3.11.23).

First, the PRC \ncapital market is large while foreign participation remains \nlow, indicating further catch-up potential. In 2018, the PRC \naccounted for 8.5% of global equity market capitalization, \naccording to the latest data from the World Federation of \nExchanges, and 12.6% of the global bond market outstanding, \naccording to data from the Bank for International Settlements. \nHowever, at the end of 2019, foreign ownership of PRC \nequities was only 4.4%, and of bonds only 3.3%. Secondly, PRC \ninclusion and stepwise increases in weighting in global bond \nand equity indexes is expected to continue, bringing further \ncapital inflow. Most of it is currently directed toward relatively \nliquid and safe central government bonds, which accounted \nfor 59.7% of foreign bond holdings in the PRC at the end of \n2019. Policy\u00a0bank bonds accounted for 22.8%, and negotiable \ncertificates of deposit 9.9% (Figure 3.11.24). \n\n% of GDP\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n\u20133\n\n\u20136\n\n\u20139\n\nFigure 3.11.23\u2002 Balance of payments: \n\nbreakdown of capital flows\n\nNet errors and omissions\nOther investments\nFinancial derivatives\nPortfolio investment\nNet FDI\nCurrent account\nChange in reserve assets\n\nQ1\n2013\n\nQ1\n2014\n\nQ1\n2015\n\nQ1\n2016\n\nQ1\n2017\n\nQ1\n2018\n\nQ1\n2019\n\nSources: State Administration of Foreign Exchange; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: East Asia \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u2002\u2002199\n\nThe way to effectively manage capital flow volatility and \npotential reversal is to strengthen financial system stability \nand deepen the domestic bond market. As PRC integration into \nthe global financial market remains limited, portfolio inflow \nis currently only marginally affected by the global financial \ncycle. Thus, domestic financial regulation and supervision \nshould be strengthened and the macroprudential policy \nframework enhanced to better reflect the expanding role of \nportfolio\u00a0flows.\n\nDeep and liquid capital markets\u2014in which financial \nderivatives, especially treasury bond futures, are available \nto foreign investors for managing risk\u2014are key to attracting \nlong-term international investors.

Weak global demand and COVID-19 \nare  expected  to  hit  growth  hard  this  year.  Consumption  will  weaken,  and  exports  and \nprivate investment will fall as support is delayed, but accommodative fiscal and monetary \npolicies  should  cushion  some  COVID-19  effects.  Factory  data  need  to  be  better  used  to \nstrengthen  manufacturing.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP slowed from 2.7% in 2018 to 2.0% in 2019, its slowest in a \ndecade, as the economy faced domestic and external headwinds \n(Figure 3.12.1). On the demand side, investment deepened 1.8% \ncontraction in 2018 with further contraction by 2.5% as gains \nfrom a fiscal stimulus package were offset by sharper reduction \nin private investment, and despite government investment \nexpanding to a 10-year high of 11.1%. Private investment \ncontraction by 6.0% reflected continued weakening in global \ntrade. Private consumption, the main engine of growth, also \nslowed, from 2.8% in 2018 to 1.9%, as declining wages and \ndeteriorating consumer confidence constrained household \nspending. Meanwhile, government consumption growth rose \nfrom 5.6% in 2018 to 6.5% on higher government subsidies and \ntransfers.\n\nGrowth in exports of goods and services moderated from \n3.5% in 2018 to 1.7% this year as the economy grappled with two \ntrade conflicts, one between the US and the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) and the other between Japan and the Republic \nof Korea (ROK) (Figure 3.12.2). A downturn in global electronics \ntrade further crimped exporters. Growth in shipments of \nsemiconductor and information technology products, metals, \nand heavy industry products languished in negative territory \nfor most of the year. Meanwhile, imports continued to contract \nas lower world crude oil prices cut the fuel import bill, and as \nsubdued domestic consumption and private investment reduced \ndemand for capital and transport goods.\n\nBy sector, growth in services slowed from 3.2% in 2018 \nto 2.7%.

Mining contracted by 1.4%, and \nconstruction by 3.0%, while growth in manufacturing fell by \nmore than half from 3.4% in 2018 to 1.4%. Manufacturing was \nhit by shrinking global trade and by structural and cyclical \nfactors but nonetheless stayed in positive territory on growth \nhigher than expected in its top two sectors: growth in computer, \nelectronic, and optical products unexpectedly picking up in the \nsecond half of the year on higher demand for electronic devices, \nand transport equipment also expanding on higher shipbuilding \norders and increased demand for automobiles in major trade \npartners. Agricultural output improved on 1.5% growth in \n2018 with expansion by 2.4% on better weather and increased \nlivestock production.\n\nAs growth decelerated, inflation fell from 1.5% in 2018 to \n0.4% last year (Figure 3.12.3). This is far below the central bank \ntarget of 2.0% and the lowest annual inflation in 6 decades. Core \ninflation, which excludes food and energy, also fell, from 1.2% a \nyear earlier to 0.7%.\n\nThe current account surplus slipped from the equivalent of \n4.5% of GDP in 2018 to 3.7% in 2019 (Figure 3.12.4). Growth in \nmerchandise exports decelerated from 10.3% in 2018 to 7.9% on \nlower external demand and subdued prices for semiconductors \nand petrochemicals. Growth in merchandise imports contracted \nby 6.0% on account of lackluster demand for consumer goods and \nintermediate inputs for production. Net foreign direct investment \ncontracted by 4.1% last year. This, combined with a sharp decline \nin net portfolio investment, narrowed the surplus in the overall \nbalance of payments to $1.5 billion, less than a tenth of the $17.5 \nbillion recorded in 2018. This small surplus raised official foreign \nexchange reserves by a modest 1.3% to $408.8 billion at the end \nof 2019.\n\nFiscal and monetary policies remained supportive of growth \nin 2019. The government introduced two supplementary budgets \nthat raised government expenditure on continuing programs to \ncreate jobs, spur innovation, and improve household incomes. As \na result, expenditure in the first 11 months of the year increased \nby 12.5%, greatly exceeding the government target for annual \nrises at 7.3% until 2022. Meanwhile, growth in government \nrevenue in the first 11 months of 2019 braked from 8.8% a year \nearlier to a scant 0.2%, largely reflecting lower corporate profits. \nAs a result, the fiscal deficit excluding social security funds \nin the consolidated balance came to W45.6 trillion, the largest \nsince 2011 and higher than the full year target of W42.3 trillion. \n\n\f202(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nWith the economy weakening and inflation low, monetary policy \nwas accommodative as the central bank cut its policy interest \nrate twice last year, first by 25 basis points in July and then by \nanother 25 basis points in October, lowering the rate to 1.25%.\n\nFigure 3.12.5\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\nEconomic prospects\nAs growth in major trade partners deteriorates, COVID-19 \nspreads around the world, and access to export markets tightens, \ngrowth is expected to slow markedly to 1.3% this year, picking up \nto 2.3% in 2021 (Figure 3.12.5). With weaker growth anticipated \nin the PRC and major advanced economies, exports are less likely \nto grow this year. Supply chain disruption from the outbreak is \nexpected to affect private investment as well, as firms cut or delay \nfacility upgrades. Meanwhile, consumption will moderate, but the \nslowdown will be tempered by continued government support, \nincluding accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. Such \nsupport and a projected recovery in global growth in 2021 should \nlift growth in the ROK to 2.3% next year.\n\nExports of goods and services are set to fall again this year. \n\nExports to the US and rest of the world picked up in the first \n2 months of the year, but exports to the PRC, the largest trade \npartner of the ROK, contracted. Meanwhile, a projected rebound \nin electronics and potential gains from the US\u2013PRC \u201cphase-\none\u201d agreement are likely to be delayed. Imports are similarly \nexpected to slow as demand for consumer and capital goods falls, \nbut they should recover toward the end of the year as business \nactivity and consumer spending recover.\n\nPrivate investment is expected to weaken in tandem with \nexports. The business confidence index fell from 77 in February \n2020 to 69 in March, signaling lower fixed investment in the \nmonths ahead as firms foresee weakening in corporate sales \nand incomes (Figure 3.12.6). New product launches and the \nestablishment of new data centers to support plans by big \ncompanies to export fifth generation content and connectivity \nhave spurred investment in information technology since the end \nof 2019. However, with factory closures in the PRC in response to \nCOVID-19 and sluggish global trade, business expansion is likely \nto pause. \n\nGrowth in private consumption is expected to soften in 2020. \n\nAfter reaching a 19-month high in January 2020, consumer \nconfidence fell below 100 in February, indicating lower household \nspending in the near term. Confidence should improve later in \nthe year as the outbreak is brought under control. A proactive \napproach to monitoring and tracing the outbreak in the ROK \nshould lessen fears of massive infection. \n\nDespite supply constraints imposed by COVID-19, declining \n\nfuel prices and price cutting on manufactures to stimulate \ndemand will keep price increases to a minimum. Inflation is \ntherefore forecast at only 0.9% this year (Figure 3.12.7).

The Nikkei purchasing managers\u2019 index slipped from an \n8-month high of 50.1 in December 2019 to below 50 in January \nand February 2020 on lower export orders, indicating lower \nproduction. A pickup in export growth to 4.5% in February, \nlargely on higher shipments of memory chips and car components \nto the US, is unlikely to impart momentum in light of a \ncontraction now expected in major advanced economies. \n\nMerchandise imports are likely to follow the same trend, \npicking up toward year-end as domestic activity rebounds. The \nservice account will likely record a larger deficit as tourism \nreceipts decline with lower tourist arrivals, while income \naccounts will shrink as the outbreak hampers corporate incomes \nand profits. As a result, the current account surplus will fall to \nthe equivalent of 2.8% of GDP this year, rising again to 3.5% in \n2021 (Figure 3.12.8).\n\nMonetary policy should remain accommodative to support \n\ngrowth. In March, the central bank slashed its benchmark \ninterest rate by 50 basis points and introduced measures to aid \nsmall companies and boost liquidity. Depending on how the \nmacroeconomic situation unfolds in the near term, the central \nbank may adjust policy further to sustain growth and keep \ninflation low. Fiscal policy too will remain expansionary with \ncontinued efforts to revitalize the economy through government \nspending and measures to contain COVID-19. On 17 March 2020, \nthe government passed a W11.7 trillion supplemental budget for \ndisease prevention and treatment and financial assistance to \naffected families and business. On 19 March, it launched a W50 \ntrillion package to ease financial burdens on smaller businesses \nand boost their liquidity\u2014doubling it to W100 trillion on 24 \nMarch to include conglomerates and big companies. Excluding \nthe additional budget and emergency package, a consolidated \nfiscal deficit equal to 3.5% to GDP is planned under the 2020 \nbudget. \n\nThe key downside risk to the outlook would be a wider \nand more protracted COVID-19 pandemic, which threatens to \ndamage economies through multiple channels. Given strong trade \nrelations between the PRC and the ROK and the role of the latter \nin global manufacturing supply chains, extended factory closures \nand lockdowns in major trade partners could exact a heavy toll \non domestic production. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014smarter manufacturing\nTo boost manufacturing, some countries have actively pursued \npolices to make production more efficient and flexible by \n\n\fFigure 3.12.9\u2002 Smartization of factories\n\n2015\n2017\n\nShare of plants (%)\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\nLevel of Smartization\n\nSource: Adapted from Kim, Minho, Sunghoon Chung and \nChangkeun Lee. 2019. \u201cSmart factory: Economic impact \nand policy implications\u201d.

Factory smartization, as some choose to call \nit, denotes the digitalization and networking of all processes, \nproducts, and resources. According to this definition, workers, \nmachines, and parts share all information relevant to production \nand have the capacity to utilize the information in the \nproduction process. For example, Nobilia, a German kitchen \nequipment maker, applies information and communication \ntechnology to automatically order, process, and assemble parts. \nFactories then digitalize all relevant information and use it \nin decision making. Smart production is widely credited with \nturning Nobilia, which has just two factories, into Europe\u2019s \nbiggest kitchen equipment manufacturer.\n\nIn the ROK, government support for factory smartization \nbegan in 2014. In the next 5 years, the government spent W414 \nbillion on subsidies for smart factories. In 2019, the government \nallocated W1 trillion in its budget for smart factories, making it a \ntop structural policies. The government has proposed a target of \n30,000 smart factories by 2022.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study by the Korean Development \nInstitute (KDI) based on survey of 1,000 ROK manufacturing \nfirms, such concerted policy support still leaves significant \nscope for making factories smarter. The survey indicated that \nthe factory smartization rate was 31% in 2015, rising to only \n37% in 2017 (Figure 3.12.9). This indicates that most factories \nstill engage in little system integration or data sharing and \nutilization. \n\nOf course, the ultimate purpose of smarter factories is to \nmake firms more productive. The KDI study confirmed that it \ndid improve factory performance. In particular, it significantly \nand positively affected daily output, which is the most \ncomprehensive performance indicator. \n\nA number of policy directions exist as options for further \nfostering smart factories in the ROK. First, government could \nstrive to acquire a longer-term and more sustainable policy \nperspective on smart factories. Rushing into smartization \nwithout adequate preparation can be costly and wasteful. \nSecond, smart factories require smart policy support. In \npractice, this means systematically linking and analyzing \nthe information gleaned from past policy experience. Third, \nretraining systems must be reconfigured to meet firms\u2019 specific \nemerging needs. Such reconfiguration would facilitate the \nreallocation of workers away from skill categories that will \nshrink as factories become smarter. Finally, smart factory policy \nshould make good use of public\u2013private partnership in place \nof top\u2013down government-led initiatives. More specifically, \nnetwork-based management platforms can link various \nstakeholders and foster their collaboration, and thus spearhead \nthe upgrading of ROK manufacturing through digitalization.\n\n\fTaipei,China\n\nGrowth remained stable in 2019, driven by domestic demand. Inflation moderated despite \nrising  food  prices,  and  the  current  account  surplus  narrowed.  Growth  is  expected  to \nmoderate  in  2020  as  COVID-19  takes  its  toll,  but  rise  in  2021  on  higher  exports  and \npublic  outlays.    Inflation  should  trend  down  this  year,  as  oil  and  other  commodity  prices \nmoderate,  but  rise  slightly  in  2021  as  demand  strengthens.

Domestic demand remained the main driver \nof growth. Gross capital formation expanded by 5.4% and \ncontributed 1.2 percentage points to GDP growth as companies \nre-shored operations back to Taipei,China, mainly from \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Private consumption \nincreased by 2.1% and added 1.1 percentage points, while \ngovernment consumption grew by only 0.1%, making its \ncontribution to GDP growth negligible. As export growth \nalmost doubled to 1.2% in real terms while import growth \nslowed by nearly half to 0.8%, net exports reversed contraction \nin the previous year to expand by 3.0% and add 0.4 points to \ngrowth (Figure 3.13.1). \n\nto 2.7% in 2019, mainly with slower expansion in wholesale \nand retail trade. Industry growth decelerated from 3.2% to \n0.6% as manufacturing moderated in line with a downturn in \nsemiconductors, while excessive rainfall caused agriculture to \ncontract, reducing to nil its contribution to growth. Services \nadded 1.6 percentage points, and industry 0.2 points, but \nsectoral contributions do not add up to GDP growth, leaving a \nstatistical discrepancy in the official data. The unemployment \nrate was unchanged at 3.7%.\n\nInflation remained subdued in 2019, falling to 0.6%, \n\nless than half of the 2018 rate. While food price inflation \nalmost doubled to 1.9% as heavy rains disrupted the supply \nof vegetables and fruit, nonfood prices dropped considerably \nas oil prices fell and the communication industry began to \nexperience more competition (Figure 3.13.2).

Exports of electrical machinery and apparatuses, \nwhich account for more than a third of merchandise exports, \ngrew faster than in the previous year. The trade surplus \nnarrowed as imports declined less than exports and the \nservice account registered a deficit despite faster growth \nthan in 2018 in investment income and net tourism receipts \n(Figure 3.13.3). The current account surplus thus narrowed \nfrom the equivalent of 11.6% of GDP in 2018 to 10.5%. Gross \nforeign exchange reserves grew by 3.5% in 2019. The local \ndollar depreciated by 2.5% against the US dollar (Figure 3.13.4). \nHowever, it appreciated by 0.4% in nominal effective terms \n(against a trade-weighted basket of currencies) and by 3.3% in \nreal effective terms (taking inflation into account).\n\nBoth fiscal and monetary policy were accommodative in \n2019. Budgetary revenue contracted by 1.2% while expenditure \nexpanded by 5.0%, reversing a central government budget \nsurplus equal to 0.1% of GDP in 2018 with a provisional deficit \nof 0.6%.

Private investment will continue to be driven by \nre-shoring from the PRC. Public investment in infrastructure \nis expected to rise, though less than in previous years, again \nbecause of base effects. Consumption spending, especially on \nservices, is expected to be depressed by COVID-19, but this \nmay be partly offset by a rise in the minimum wage at the \nstart of the year and steady employment. \n\nOn the supply side, services will continue to make the \nlargest contribution to growth this year and next.

This crimps the \nresources available for investment into either human or \nphysical capital and thereby stagnates potential output. \nRaising productivity is essential to counter a worsening \ndemographic outlook. \n\nThe government should devise incentives to encourage \n\ncompanies to take advantage of existing innovation in areas \nsuch as robotics and artificial intelligence to automate \naggressively and raise productivity. While Taipei,China has \nmore robots installed per manufacturing worker than most \nadvanced economies, it lags the leaders: in descending order, \nthe ROK, Singapore, Germany, and Japan (Figure 3.13.8). \nTaipei,China enjoys the fiscal space, meanwhile, to offer tax \nincentives to spur robot adoption across industries (Figure \n3.13.9). Public expenditure on research and development \nshould be increased to develop and enhance mechanical \ndevices and robots able to take the heavy lifting out of the \nhands of older factory workers and increase their productivity.\n\nIt should also strengthen measures that make labor \n\nmarkets more flexible and efficient: allowing easier hiring and \nfiring of employees, increasing participation, and encouraging \nthe training of women and older workers. The government has \nalready acted to provide cheaper childcare to boost fertility \nand raise female workforce participation, as well as increased \nsubsidies to employers that hire older workers, introduced a \npension reform bill that will encourage workers to remain in \nthe workforce, limited age discrimination in hiring, and set up \nan employment database for older workers. These steps can \nbe complemented by promoting flexible work arrangements to \nfacilitate part-time employment and working from home. \n\nTo address talent shortages, visa regulations for skilled \nworkers have become less restrictive, but more can be done to \nattract highly skilled foreign workers by adjusting residency \nrequirements, health insurance, taxes, and compensation. \nMore broadly, to encourage innovative start-ups and other new \nfirms, Taipei,China should improve on its rating for ease of \ndoing business, which the World Bank index puts below those \nof other high-income economies (Figure 3.13.10). In particular, \naccess to credit should be enhanced by allowing moveable \nassets to serve as collateral.\n\nFigure 3.13.8\u2002 Installed industrial robots in \n\nmanufacturing, 2017\n\nNumber per 100 employees\n\nROK SIN GER JPN USA TAP PRC Europe\n\nAsia\nAve. Ave. Ave.\n\nAmericas\n\nGER = Germany; JPN = Japan; PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof China; ROK = Republic of Korea; SIN = Singapore; \nTAP\u00a0=\u00a0Taipei,China; USA = United States.\nSource: International Federation of Robotics,  \nhttps://ifr.org/.\n\nFigure 3.13.9\u2002 Manufacturing robot stock \nin Taipei,China by industry, \n2015\n\nNonmetallic\nmineral products\nPaper & paper products\nChemical\nproducts\n\nWood & furniture\nFood, beverages, & tobacco\nGarments & textiles\n\nRubber & plastics\n\nBasic &\nfabricated metals\n\nTransport\nequipment\n\nIndustrial\nmachinery\n\nElectrical &\noptical equipment\n\nSource: International Federation of Robotics.\n\nFigure 3.13.10\u2002 Ease of doing business score, \n\n2020\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nSIN\nUSA\nUKG\nROK\nPRC\nJPN\nHKG\nGER\nTAP\n\n70\n\n74\n\n78\n\n82\n\n86\n\n90\n\nIndex\n\nGER = Germany; HKG = Hong Kong, China; JPN = Japan; \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China; ROK = Republic of \nKorea; SIN = Singapore; TAP = Taipei,China;  \nUKG\u00a0=\u00a0United Kingdom; USA = United States.\nSource: World Bank.

Inflation is expected \nto  accelerate  in  2021,  and  the  current  account  surplus  to  narrow  further  as  grant  assistance \nfalls  in  the  next  2  years.

Precipitation above average enabled recovery in \nagriculture, which provides 19% of GDP, from 0.9% decline in \n2018. Uncertainty surrounding delayed presidential elections \ncaused industry to decelerate in 2019 from strong 7.6% growth \nin 2018, and growth in services remained sluggish.\n\nBusiness confidence was further eroded by continued \nviolence that took a high toll on Afghan civilians, causing \nprivate investment to decline. Private consumption improved \nthanks to rising agricultural incomes. Public expenditure on \ndevelopment projects marginally decreased, further softening \ndomestic demand. \n\nInflation increased from 0.6% in 2018 to average 2.3% in \n2019 as the local currency, the afghani, depreciated and food \nprices reversed their steep fall in 2018 to rise by 3.8% last year \n(Figure 3.14.2). Nonfood inflation fell from 2.3% in 2018 to 0.9% \nas demand slackened.

Strong revenue growth was supported by \nimproved tax administration, higher customs revenue following \nafghani depreciation, and a surge in nontax revenues, notably a \none-off transfer of central bank profits to the Treasury. Public \nexpenditure equaled an estimated 58.0% of GDP in 2019, however, \nsubstantially widening the fiscal deficit excluding grants from \n4.5% of GDP in 2018 to 5.4%.

The trade deficit widened \nslightly from 29.0% of GDP in 2018 to 30.6%. In the first 11 months \nof 2019, exports declined by 10.4% despite afghani depreciation, \nfollowing a 25.0% decline in 2018, while strong agricultural output \ndecelerated import growth to only 0.2% in the same period. Gross \ninternational reserves rose slightly to $8.5 billion, covering more \nthan 12 months of imports (Figure 3.14.7). \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to remain unchanged at 3.0% in 2020, with \ncontinuing political uncertainty and now COVID-19 likely to \ndampen any prospects for further economic growth. Despite \nthe announcement of presidential election results, the political \nsituation remains unsettled, and proposed intra-Afghan peace \ntalks are not yet scheduled. A significant COVID-19 outbreak \nin Afghanistan has become more likely with high numbers of \nAfghans recently returning from Iran, which is suffering its own \nmajor outbreak. GDP growth is nevertheless projected to rise \nto 4.0% in 2021, supported by improved prospects for long-term \npolitical stability and security, as well as a successor to the \nExtended Credit Facility program of the International Monetary \nFund that reached completion in December 2019\u2014and despite \na gradual decline in international grants.

While pass-through from \ndepreciation adds to inflationary pressure, higher inflation is \nunlikely, given sluggish consumption growth, which will contain \nthe rise in aggregate demand. On balance, inflation should remain \nunchanged at 2.3% in 2020, then increase to 3.5% in 2021 as \neconomic activity improves and domestic demand strengthens. \n\nThe fiscal deficit is expected to increase slightly in both 2020 \n\nand 2021 as revenue declines. Grants as a percentage of GDP \nare forecast to be little changed from 2019. Domestic revenue \nwill remain at the 2019 amount as nontax revenue mobilization \nweakens\u2014and despite total revenue rising to 27.7% of GDP in 2021, \nas expected, after the implementation of value-added tax (VAT). \nExpenditure will likely rise somewhat but remain close to the 2019 \npercentage of GDP, with priority given to financing expenditure in \nresponse to COVID-19. \n\nThe current account surplus will likely narrow in 2020 and \n2021. International grants are expected to fall gradually despite \nexpected commitments at an international conference later this \nyear and strengthened partnership to support objectives under \nthe Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework. \nExports are expected to trend upward with stronger agriculture \nexports, enhanced efforts by the government to facilitate trade, and \nthe development of new trade corridors. However, export growth \nwill be insufficient to offset import growth and lower grants. \nInternational reserves are projected to remain comfortable over the \nnext 2 years at cover for nearly 12 months of imports.\n\nThe outlook is subject to significant risks. On the upside, \na successful political settlement and sustainable peace would \nopen a new window of opportunity for Afghanistan and unleash \nsignificant growth, raising business confidence and paving the \nway for prosperity and socioeconomic development. On the \ndownside, uncertainty and lower domestic demand could ensue \nfrom a prolonged period of political transition after the September \npresidential elections, delays in commencing intra-Afghan talks, \nand a steeper reduction in foreign aid than is currently expected. \nThese risks could be compounded by rising tensions in the Middle \nEast or a worsening COVID-19 outbreak in Afghanistan or Iran, \nwhich is a major trade partner and source of remittances.\n\nTable 3.14.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n2.7\n\n0.6\n\n9.6\n\n3.0\n\n2.3\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.3\n\n1.0\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n0.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.14.6\u2002Current account balance\n\nExcluding official grants\nIncluding official grants\n\n% of GDP\n\n8.4\n\n5.9\n\n9.6\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020 2021\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 21 December of the \nsame calendar year.\nSources: International Monetary Fund Article IV, \nDecember 2019; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.14.7\u2002International reserves \n\nGross international reserves\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014accelerating domestic \nrevenue growth\nAfghanistan\u2019s ratio of revenue to GDP reached an historic \nhigh of 13.8% in 2019 but remained below the ratio in most \nneighboring countries and the average in low-income economies. \nRevenue covered 51% of government expenditure, the rest \n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company; International Financial \nStatistics, IMF; Da Afghanistan Bank (accessed 18 March \n2020).\n\n\f214(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nfinanced by development partners. Indeed, as a fragile country \nin armed conflict, Afghanistan has limited revenue sources \nand weak government institutions, but daunting security and \ndevelopment needs, leaving public finances heavily dependent \non foreign assistance. This dependence is not sustainable, \nthough, so the country needs to become more self-sufficient in \nfinancing public expenditure. Accelerating domestic revenue \nmobilization is one of the most pressing policy challenges \nfacing Afghanistan.  \n\nOver the past 2 decades, Afghanistan has made notable \nprogress in building a revenue system able to help generate \nrising government revenue. Since 2016, the government has \nsuccessfully followed a strategy of boosting prospects for self-\nreliance through domestic revenue mobilization that, together \nwith foreign grant assistance, helped achieve a balanced budget \nand keep public debt low. Tax administration reform over the \nlast 2 years has made revenue collection more efficient, and \ncustoms revenue benefitted from afghani depreciation in 2019.\nWhile the past revenue collection performance benefitted \n\nfrom an expanding tax base and improved efficiency, it has \nalso increasingly relied on risky indirect and one-off measures \nthat create uncertainty. The World Bank estimates that 2019 \nnontax revenue drove revenue growth by contributing 1.3 \npercentage points to GDP, while tax revenue deducted 0.15 \npercentage points from GDP. Going forward, realizing self-\nreliance and reducing grant dependence will depend on how \nsuccessfully the government builds a sound domestic revenue \nbase by further broadening the tax base and reducing reliance \non nontax revenues. Key to revenue mobilization policy in \nthe near future is the planned adoption of VAT by early 2021. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the successful \nadministration of VAT could gradually raise revenue by up to \nthe equivalent of 1.8% of GDP, but it will be a challenge without \nresolving currently daunting political and business uncertainty. \n\nThe government should pursue structural reform as \noutlined in the Afghanistan National Peace and Development \nFramework to ensure sustained progress towards self-reliance. \nStrenuous efforts are needed to improve governance and public \nfinancial management. Policies should continue to work toward \nstrengthening revenue collection, improving customs and tax \nadministration and compliance, introducing carefully designed \nand appropriate new taxes, and improving the tax policy mix. \nIn the short term, policy actions can focus on introducing \ndigital technology into revenue collection, reinforcing \ncontrols and tax audits, strengthening antifraud measures, \nand sanctioning noncompliance. Over the medium term, \nadditional excises and property taxes should be introduced, \na fiscal regime for natural resource taxation developed, and \nenforcement and compliance strengthened.\n\n\fBangladesh\n\nGDP grew by 8.2% in fiscal 2019 on robust growth in both industry and services. Inflation \nslowed  following  a  good  crop  harvest,  and  the  current  account  deficit  narrowed  as  the \ntrade  deficit  shrank  and  remittances  expanded  further.  Growth  is  expected  to  remain \nstrong  in  fiscal  2020  and  2021.  Inflation  is  expected  to  stay  in  check,  and  the  current \naccount  deficit  will  narrow  further.  Achieving  higher  growth  requires  reform  to  better \nmobilize  domestic  resources.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth increased to 8.2% in FY2019 (ended 30 June \n2019) from 7.9% in the previous year on robust growth in \nindustry and services (Figure 3.15.1). Growth in industry \nrose from 12.1% in FY2018 to 12.7% in FY2019, reflecting \nbrisk growth in manufacturing output to supply markedly \nhigher export demand, notably to the US and some previously \nunpenetrated markets. Growth in services increased from \n6.4% to 6.8% mainly on improvements in wholesale and retail \ntrade, transport, education, and health and social services. \nAgriculture growth moderated from 4.2% to 3.9%. \n\nOn the demand side, growth in FY2019 was buoyed by \n\nrobust growth in exports. Private investment expanded, \nthough at a slower pace than a year earlier, while public \ninvestment remained steady. Total investment increased from \nthe equivalent of 31.2% of GDP in FY2018 to 31.6% as private \ninvestment increased from 23.3% of GDP to 23.5% and public \ninvestment remained unchanged at 8.0%.\n\nInflation moderated from 5.8% in the previous year to \n\naverage 5.5% in FY2019 with lower domestic rice prices \nfollowing a good harvest and lower food prices on the \ninternational market (Figure 3.15.2). While food inflation \neased, nonfood inflation moved a bit higher owing to upward \nadjustments in natural gas prices and currency depreciation.\nGrowth in broad money accelerated from 9.2% in FY2018 \n\nto 9.9% but remained well below the FY2019 monetary \n\nThis chapter was written by Jyotsana Varma, Soon Chan Hong, and Barun \nK.

Growth in private \ncredit moderated from 16.9% in FY2018 to 11.3%, well below its \n16.5% program target. Net credit to the public sector, however, \nincreased strongly to 19.8%, substantially exceeding the 10.9% \nprogram target. It reflects both an overshot budget deficit \nand measures to reduce reliance on sales of national savings \ncertificates by increasing budget financing from banks at lower \nmarket rates. \n\nBangladesh Bank, the central bank, kept its policy rates \n\nunchanged in FY2019 as inflation remained stable. With \nincreased demand for foreign exchange to pay for imports and \nfor bank financing of the budget, market liquidity tightened, \npushing the call money rate to 4.6% in June 2019 from 3.4% \na year earlier, while the yield on 91-day Treasury bills rose \nfrom 3.7% to 6.8%. The weighted average rate on new lending \nremained broadly steady in FY2019, however, declining by 20 \nbasis points to 9.7% in June, while the average deposit rate was \nunchanged at 5.5% (Figure 3.15.4). \n\nBudget revenue rose slightly from the equivalent of 9.6% \nof GDP in FY2018 to 9.9%. With national elections occurring, \ngovernment spending increased significantly from 14.3% of \nGDP to 15.4%, reflecting a rise in current spending from 7.9% \nto 8.6% and annual development spending from 5.3% to 5.8%. \nSlower growth in revenue collection and accelerated spending \npushed the overall deficit up from 4.7% of GDP to 5.5%, crossing \nthe budget ceiling of 5.0% for the first time in more than a \ndecade (Figure 3.15.5). This deviation reflected temporary \ncircumstances and not a departure from policy that has kept the \ngovernment medium- and long-term debt ratio low, amounting \nto just 29.1% of GDP in FY2019. \n\n Exports reached $39.9 billion in FY2019, reflecting growth \n\nacceleration from 6.7% a year earlier to 10.1%. Growth in \ngarment exports, accounting for over 84% of the total, rose \nfrom 8.8% to 11.5% on strong demand from the US and newly \npenetrated markets such as Australia, India, Japan, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and the Republic of Korea. Exports other \nthan garments rose by 5.8%. Imports\u2014following explosive \n25.2% expansion in FY2018\u2014grew in FY2019 by only 1.8% to \nreach $55.4 billion. Imports of petroleum products, garment \nintermediates, and construction materials grew substantially \nto support industry growth. However, imports of capital \ngoods increased slightly as investment slowed, and a good \ncrop harvest sharply reduced food import requirement. \nConsequently, the trade deficit narrowed substantially from \n$18.2 billion to $15.5 billion. Remittances markedly increased \nby 9.6% to $16.4 billion, benefitting by measures to encourage \ntransfer through official channels. \n\nSubstantial improvement in the trade deficit and strong \nremittances narrowed the current account deficit in FY2019 by \nabout half to $5.3 billion, equal to 1.7% of GDP.

Nonetheless, \nthe overall balance reversed a $857 million deficit in FY2018 \nwith a small surplus of $12 million. Central bank gross foreign \nexchange reserves including valuation adjustments decreased \nmarginally from $32.9 billion to $32.7 billion or cover for 6.0 \nmonths of imports (Figure 3.15.6). \n\nThe Bangladesh taka depreciated against the US dollar by \n\n0.9% in FY2019 as the central bank intervened, selling $2.3 \nbillion to commercial banks to tamp down excessive market \nvolatility (Figure 3.15.7). Reflecting inflation differentials, \nthe taka appreciated by 5.0% in real effective terms, eroding \ncompetitiveness.\n\nEconomic prospects\nForecasts for FY2020 and FY2021 rest on several assumptions: \npolitical calm will continue, helping to maintain consumer \nand investment confidence; exports and imports will be \ndepressed in FY2020 due to global economic slowdown, but \nwill improve in FY2021; central bank monetary policy will be \nexpansionary enough to support economic growth yet maintain \nprice stability; and the weather will be normal. The impact of \nCOVID-19 has not been included. \n\nGDP growth is expected to moderate but remain strong at \n7.8% in FY2020 as domestic demand is supported by continued \nhealthy growth in workers\u2019 remittances (Figure 3.15.8). Private \ninvestment is expected to remain subdued. Economic activity \nis forecast to accelerate in the second half of the year with \nexpanded government development spending, higher imports of \nliquefied natural gas and construction materials, favorable trends \nin power production, and the authorities pursuing policies to \nboost exports.\n\nOn the supply side, industry growth is expected to moderate \n\nto 11.5% as growth in manufacturing output slows in tandem \nwith expected zero growth in exports. Likewise, service growth \nis expected to ease to 6.5%, following the trend in industry \nand reflecting an only moderate uptake of credit in a period \nof prevailing uncertainty. However, growth in agriculture is \nexpected to pick up to 4.0% thanks to continued government \npolicy support, notably to reduce fertilizer prices and finance \nmechanization to counter labor shortages at harvest time.\n\nIn FY2021, GDP growth is expected to edge up to 8.0% as \n\na foreseen improvement in global growth permits expansion in \nboth exports and imports to pick up. Aided by continued strong \nremittances, private consumption will continue to drive growth. \nPrivate investment will revive on a stronger outlook supported \nby regulatory improvements to conditions for doing business \n\nFigure 3.15.5\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nTax revenue\nNontax revenue\nCurrent spending\nDevelopment spending\nDomestic \ufb01nancing\nForeign \ufb01nancing\n\n% of GDP\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\nBudget\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nFigure 3.15.6\u2002Foreign exchange reserves\n\nAmount\n\nMonths of imports\n\n$ billion\n\nMonths \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Bangladesh Bank. http://www.bb.org.bd.\n\nTable 3.15.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20027.9\n\n\u20025.8\n\n\u20133.5\n\n\u20028.2\n\n\u20025.5\n\n\u20027.8\n\n\u20028.0\n\n\u20025.6\n\n\u20025.5\n\n\u20131.7\n\n\u20130.8 \u20130.3\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. http://www.\nbbs.gov.bd; ADB estimates.\n\n\f218(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nand an initiative to have banks maintain their lending rates in \nsingle digits.

Bank borrowing by the government was \nstrong, reflecting FY2020 budget policy to markedly reduce the \nuse of national savings certificates from the equivalent of 3.0% \nof GDP in FY2018 to 1.0%. Private sector credit continued to \ngrow slowly with subdued import demand. Net foreign assets \nshowed a small gain.

This abrupt \nchange in fortune came in large part from a cyclical downturn \nin global apparel trade but was compounded by a lack of product \ndiversification to keep up with changes in consumer demand, as \nwell as lower prices offered by buyers and currency depreciation \nin competitor countries.

Thus, import is forecast to decline \nby only 0.5% in the whole of FY2020. However, import growth \nis projected to pick up to 7.0% in FY2021 as the government \nexpedites the completion of several large infrastructure projects. \nImports of construction materials, capital machinery, and export-\nrelated items are expected to increase sharply.\n\nThis outlook makes the trade deficit likely to moderate as a \nshare of GDP in both years. Notably, overseas worker remittances \nincreased handsomely in the first 8 months of FY2020, \ndoubling growth from 10% a year earlier to 20% (Figure 3.15.11). \nGovernment efforts are taking hold to promote money transfers \nthrough formal channels, including a 2% cash incentive, and to \ncurb the role of unauthorized intermediaries. Remittances are \ntherefore expected to grow by 16% in FY2020. Growth will then \nmoderate to 9% in FY2021 as the number of outgoing workers \ndeclines and uncertainty limits scope for increased employment \nand higher wages.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to narrow to the \n\nequivalent of 0.8% of GDP in FY2020 on these projected \ndevelopments in trade and remittances, as well as other factors \n(Figure 3.15.12). With growth in exports picking up faster than \nimports and continued healthy remittances, the FY2021 current \naccount deficit is projected lower, at only 0.3% of GDP.\n\nTo avoid excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market, \nthe central bank tackled market demand by selling $489 million \nin FY2020 to 4 March 2020. The taka depreciated by 1.1% \nagainst the US dollar in the year to the end of January 2020 but \nappreciated by 2.5% in real effective terms. \n\nThe FY2020 budget, announced in June 2019, targets a \nratio of revenue to GDP at 13.1%. Public spending is targeted at \n18.1% of GDP, with current spending at 9.6% and development \nspending at 8.5%. Revenue collection by the National Board of \nRevenue, however, grew by only 7.5% in the first 7 months of \nFY2020, suggesting revenue may fall short of its target. Weak \nrevenue collection reflects the marked decline in export and \nimport activity and complications encountered in the transition \nto a new value-added tax (VAT) regime.

The revenue to GDP ratio in Bangladesh is, at 9.9%, \nthe lowest in South Asia and much lower than the average in \ndeveloping countries worldwide (Figure 3.15.13). It undercuts \nthe country\u2019s potential to sustain high economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Revenues thus need to be raised significantly \nfrom both taxes and other sources to support much-needed \npublic expenditure on infrastructure and social development.\nTax revenue provides about 90% of total revenue, its \nmajor components being VAT, income tax, customs duties, \nand supplementary duties. Other revenue is from profits and \ndividends remitted by public institutions and administrative \nfees and charges (Table 3.15.2).\n\nTo improve tax structure and strengthen revenue \nmobilization, the authorities have adopted a number of \nmeasures in the past. Two such reforms were a sales tax at \nthe import stage and the introduction of VAT in 1991 with a \nsingle rate to replace excise duties on domestic manufactures \nand services. In addition to VAT, supplementary duties \nwere introduced on luxuries and certain other goods, to \ndiscourage consumption on various grounds. Though VAT \nand supplementary duties expanded the revenue base, the \nsystem was not comprehensive in scope and contained some \ndistortions. Reform to the customs tariff in the early 1990s \nreduced the number of rates and lowered duties, moderating \nprotection for local producers. Income tax reform rationalized \npersonal and corporate tax rates, and the introduction of \nuniversal self-assessment procedures brought more taxpayers \nwithin the tax net. Parliament enacted the Value Added \nTax and Supplementary Duty Act in 2012, but its rollout \nwas delayed, coming into effect only in July 2019 with VAT \nimplemented using several rates. The government is working \non other reform to incorporate transfer pricing into the Income \nTax Ordinance 1984 and alternative dispute resolution into \nincome tax, VAT, and custom acts; draft a new direct tax \ncode and customs act; and improve tax administration by \nautomating and digitalizing operations. \n\nDespite several attempted reforms, anticipated progress has \nbeen elusive as many of them were ad hoc. While the new VAT \nlaw addressed some deficiencies and distortions in the previous \nlaw, it retained multiple VAT rates, keeping administration \ninefficient. Income tax remains complex, depressing income \ntax collection below its potential. Only 2.2 million Bangladeshis \npay income tax despite scope to increase the number to some \n10 million by simplifying collection and refunds. Income tax \nlaw is outdated, and its administration is not automated despite \nan acute shortage of trained tax administrators. Further, \nthe tax system contains many concessions, exemptions, and \nincentives that make it unwieldy.

Comprehensive tax reforms, by \nexpanding the tax base and making resource mobilization more \nefficient would help.\n\nTo expand the tax base, the authorities can consider (i) \n\nlowering tax rates and the tax-free income threshold; (ii) \nsimplifying tax system procedures and structure by limiting \nthe number of rates, thereby fostering compliance and making \ntax administration less challenging; (iii) curbing tax exemption \npolicy to remove costly tax holidays and other incentives that \nhave been ineffective to attract new investment; (iv) tapping \nnew sources of VAT and income tax such as e-commerce and \nonline services and platforms; and (v) enforcing tax laws and \nregulations more strictly to curb leakage.\n\nTo make resource mobilization more efficient, the \n\nauthorities can consider (i) establishing modern information \ntechnology systems and automation in key compliance areas \nsuch as registration, filing, and the management of payment \nobligations, which would strengthen institutional capacity; \n(ii) improving management and governance by ensuring \nthe recruitment of competent tax and customs officials; (iii) \nadopting a risk-based audit linked to taxpayers\u2019 inherent \nrisks, to encourage compliance and improve internal control \nof tax administration; and (iv) improving human resources \nwith proper training programs on tax administration and \ncompliance.\n\n\fBhutan\n\nHigher consumption expenditure in fiscal 2019 lifted growth from its 2018 slump.

National Accounts \nStatistics, 2019. http://www.nsb.gov.bt; ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic performance\nProvisional estimates highlight an uptick in growth to 4.4% \nin fiscal year 2019 (FY2019, ended 30 June 2019) from 3.8% a \nyear earlier (Figure 3.16.1). The pickup was underpinned by \nconsumption expenditure, reflecting recent rebalancing away \nfrom growth driven by fixed investment. Growth remained \nsluggish for a second year as a substantial decline in construction \ntracked a large drop in government investment and as hydropower \nproduction, a major industry driver, suffered a marked fall.\nOn the supply side, industry contracted again, by 0.9%. \n\nConstruction in particular fell further by 5.4% with the completion \nof the Mangdechhu hydropower project and with government \ncapital expenditure much lower than average. This downdraft \nwas compounded by a decline in hydropower production for a \nsecond straight year, by over 5%, with lower water flows. Growth \nin services, at 10.4%, once again picked up the slack, underpinned \nby broad expansion in wholesale and retail trade, transportation \nand storage, and hotels and restaurants. Offsetting near stagnation \nin international tourist arrivals, a 25.0% increase in tourists from \nthe region was a key driver of services. Agriculture, a traditional \nlaggard, grew by 3.8% under targeted policy interventions.\n\nOn the demand side, investment contracted for a second \nyear, by 2.6%. This reflected a marked drop in budgetary capital \nexpenditure as the country transitioned to a new government \nand the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2019\u20132023 with spending to \nmop up spillover projects but no new ones initiated. Once again, \ndomestic demand was held aloft by consumption growth, which \naccelerated from 8.6% in FY2018 to 10.3% (Figure 3.16.2). Private \nconsumption improved on 10.1% growth a year earlier with 11.8% \nin FY2019, fueled by growth in private credit accelerating to 20.0%. \nGovernment current expenditure rose from 3.7% to 5.0%. Private \ninvestment declined again, reflecting completion at Mangdechhu \n\nThis chapter was written by Kanokpan Lao-Araya, Tshering Lhamo, and \nNyingtob Norbu of the Bhutan Resident Mission, ADB, Thimphu.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nBhutan\u2002\u2002223\n\nand a slowdown at other hydropower construction sites, but not as \nsteeply as in FY2018. Net exports deteriorated by 9.0% with a 12.7% \nfall in exports. \n\nInflation reached its lowest average in a decade at 2.8% in \nFY2019 (Figure 3.16.3). This decline reflected lower food prices as \ndomestic supply improved and import prices declined. Nonfood \ninflation rose moderately from an average of 1.8% in FY2018% to \n2.4%. Imported inflation, primarily from India and accounting for \n52% of all inflation, was low for dual reasons. In addition to lower \nprices for agricultural imports, the Indian goods and services \ntax lowered prices for other imported goods from India. That \nsaid, price transmission from India can be observed weakening \nin recent years as non-tradables assume greater significance in \ndriving nonfood inflation; notable last year were domestic services, \nparticularly hotels and restaurants, and housing, in anticipation of a \ncivil service salary raise. \n\nGovernment spending fell from the equivalent of 32.2% of GDP \n\nin FY2018 to 27.4% in FY2019, reflecting transition to a new plan \nperiod (Figure 3.16.4). The overall budget deficit rose from 0.3% of \nGDP in FY2018 to 2.2% as a decline in expenditure was outweighed \nby a revenue decline by 7.4 percentage points to 24.5% of GDP, \nmainly reflecting a very large reduction in external grants with the \nwinding up of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2014\u20132018. Tax revenue \nalso declined, from 16.6% of GDP to 15.2%, largely reflecting \nreduced receipts from state-owned enterprises. Bucking the cyclical \ncapital spending downswing, current expenditure increased by \n6.0%. \n\nThe primary mandate of monetary policy, to maintain price \n\nstability, continues to be underpinned by a parity peg with the \nIndian rupee. Broad money (M2) grew at a slower rate of 5.6% \nin FY2019, tracking lackluster growth, but still found impetus \nin an increase in net foreign assets and private credit (Figure \n3.16.5). Private sector credit remains concentrated in building and \nconstruction, and in tourism and services, with each group growing \nby over 25%. Continued rapid expansion in credit in recent years \nhas enabled a sharp worsening of nonperforming loans, from \n11.5% of all private loans outstanding in FY2018 to 16.5% in FY \n2019 . Reflecting credit developments, the risk-weighted capital \nadequacy ratio fell from 16.2% in FY2018 to 12.6%, only marginally \nmeeting the prudential requirement of 12.5%. Despite the steep \ndeterioration, Bhutan\u2019s macro-prudential requirements have been \ngenerally more stringent than international norms. Therefore, \nmacro-financial parameters are still way below levels that warrant \na corrective action. Having appreciated by 2.1% in FY2018, the \nBhutan ngultrum closely followed the Indian currency as it \ndepreciated by 7.8% against the US dollar in FY2019. \n\nThe current account deficit widened further from the \nequivalent of 19.1% of GDP in FY2018 to 22.6% (Figure 3.16.6). \nAbout 40% of this deterioration was caused by a widening net \nservices deficit, and the remainder reflected higher interest and \n\nFigure 3.16.2\u2002 Demand side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\n\nPercentage points\n\nChange in stocks\nNet exports\nGross domestic\nproduct\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 30 June of that year.\nSources: National Statistics Bureau.

A 6.6% fall \nin imports help to contain the damage. Though wider, the current \naccount deficit was covered by a slightly larger sum of capital and \nfinancial account inflows plus a very large positive errors and \nomissions.\n\nGross international reserves were, at $1.1 billion in June 2019, \n\nessentially unchanged from a year earlier and adequate to cover \n10.3 months of merchandise and service payments (Figure 3.16.7). \nPublic external debt rose from $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, reaching \nthe equivalent of 109.7% of GDP (Figure 3.16.8). Of this, 73.6% is \nrupee denominated, largely concentrated in hydropower debt. The \nremaining 26.4% in convertible currencies is mostly on concessional \nterms from multilateral development banks. Though the debt ratio \nis high, the International Monetary Fund considers Bhutan\u2019s risk of \ndebt distress only moderate because hydropower debt is essentially \nself-liquidating through electricity sale agreements.\n\n%\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is forecast to pick up to 5.2% in FY2020 on increased \nhydropower capacity, assumed normal water flow, and an \nanticipated sharp increase in government expenditure to offset \nthe dampening effect of COVID-19. A further uptick to 5.8% is \nexpected in FY2021 as the ripples from the pandemic dissipate \nand government spending remains elevated.  \n\n Industry is forecast to expand by 5.4% in FY2020, fueled by \nstrong growth in hydropower and construction revived by the large \npickup in government capital expenditure. Favored by priority \ncredit and other government initiatives, agriculture is expected \nto grow by 3.9%. Growth in services is projected to slow to 5.6%, \na steep deterioration caused by the impact of the COVID-19 on \ntourism, revenue from which is projected to decline by 30%. It \nis evident that the aggregate impacts of the pandemic will be \nmore severe than what the estimates capture. In addition to other \nsecond-round impacts caused by social distancing, demand in the \ninformal sector will probably slowdown.\n\nConsumption expenditure is expected to be a consistent growth \n\ndriver, expanding by 6.4% in FY2020 and 8.4% FY2021 mostly \non a strong increase in government consumption as moderating \nexpansion in private credit slows growth in private consumption. \nFixed investment is projected to expand by 2.0% in FY2020 and \n2.6% in FY2021, underpinned by accelerated implementation at two \nmajor hydropower projects and the development of four special \neconomic zones. \n\nFiscal policy is thus planned as expansionary. It is the main \n\ndriver of growth in the outlook, with expenditure forecast to \nincrease by 31.5% in FY2020\u2014featuring a 50.7% spike in capital \nexpenditure\u2014and then grow by 16.1% in FY2021.

Current grants \nand transfers are also expected to grow strongly to support \nnew projects as a new plan period opens. From a higher base, \nexpansion in revenue and grants will slow in FY2021. Accordingly, \nthe budget deficit is projected to widen to the equivalent of 3.5% of \nGDP in FY2020 and 6.2% in FY2021, largely financed by domestic \nand external concessional borrowings.\n\nMonetary policy is expected to remain accommodative to \nsupport private sector growth and stimulus measures. Despite \nscant global pressure on prices, inflation is projected to accelerate \nto 3.8% in FY2020 and 4.0% in FY2021 as domestic demand \nincreases. \n\nCurrent account deficits are forecast to improve slightly but \nremain high at the equivalent of 19.1% of GDP in FY2020 and 18.4% \nin FY2021, continuing to require substantial external financing. \nExports of ferrous metals are expected to improve and supplement \nincreased electricity exports. Imports are also expected to \nexpand, by 5.8% in FY2020 and 2.9% in FY2021, largely to supply \nhydropower project construction. \n\nDownside risks to the growth forecasts include a significantly \n\nlower contribution from services sector if COVID-19 impacts \nare protracted. If the pandemic constricts required supplies \nfor manufacturing and construction, this would reduce \neffectiveness of government\u2019s stimulus plan to bolster demand \nwith the possibility of additional inflation. Another risks would \nbe continuing low water flows and other technical problems \nhindering full operation of hydropower plants.  \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014enhancing agricultural \nproductivity to address regional inequality\nEquity is a pillar of Bhutan\u2019s pursuit of gross national \nhappiness. Yet, free access to social services notwithstanding, \ninequality persists as large sections of the population continue \nto depend heavily on agriculture and a large productivity gap \npersists between agriculture and other sectors of production, \naccentuating disparity between urban and rural areas and within \nregions (Figure 3.16.9).\n\nMonthly urban average expenditure is Nu45,508, but rural \n\naverage expenditure is only Nu26,937. At the district level, \nThimphu and Paro exhibit higher average urban expenditure, a \nwider range, and higher top incomes than do agrarian districts \nsuch as Dagana. Like agricultural employment, poverty is \nsignificantly higher in rural Bhutan (Table 3.16.2). Thus, tackling \ninequality must target the rural population, where 76% are stuck \nin agriculture. \n\nFigure 3.16.7\u2002 External reserves\n\nRupee reserves\nConvertible currency reserves\n\nImport cover\n\nMonths of imports\n\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending 30 June of that year\nSource: Royal Monetary Authority.

However, the rural gini coefficient is higher than that \nof the urban region which runs counter to the stylized fact \nthat disparity in urban areas should be higher given wider \ndistributional possibilities. Perhaps this is because households \non the urban periphery, who do not depend on agriculture, \nare also classified as rural. The disparity between the two is \nevident. An alternative reason could be related to shortcomings \nin the measure itself. Existing inequality measures are based on \nconsumption, not income. Consumption measures underestimate \ninequality as people consume only a portion of their income, \nwith the poor consuming a significantly larger portion. Further, \ndebt-financed consumption artificially inflates the income of \nhouseholds that take out loans, most of them in urban Bhutan. \nIncluding debt-financed consumption misleads surveyors on \nthe income of these households, causing them to underestimate \ninequality, though it could be that consumption expenditure is a \nmore accurate reflection of incomes in rural than in urban areas \nbecause rural access to credit is lower. In any case, informed \npolicy making requires a more accurate picture of inequality, \nwhich can be obtained by combining data on income taxes and \nfrom living standards surveys.\n\nInclusive growth has been impeded primarily by the \n\nchallenges of generating adequately modern employment and of \nlifting agricultural productivity. Interventions must therefore \nbe geared towards modernizing agriculture. A high priority \nshould be to promote agricultural value chains that would enable \nfarmers to integrate better with markets and other sectors. To \nrealize this a concerted drive towards commercially oriented \ninfrastructure and enabling policies is critical. In addition, \nenhancing mechanization and fostering deeper penetration of \ntechnologies will be critical. With an inherent limit to farm \nmechanization in mountainous Bhutan, interventions should \nfocus on mechanizing activities higher up the value chain \nand beyond the farm, stimulating off-farm employment. As \nfragmented landholdings deter large-scale investments in \nmechanization, exploring modalities for spreading the costs \nover larger units could offer commercially viable alternatives. \nAdditionally, more affordable technologies to monitor small \nfarms, particularly against wildlife, are also worth exploring. \n\nPublic investments thus far have focused primarily on rural \n\nconnectivity and input subsidies. In may be timely to begin \ninvesting in cold-storage facilities, enhancing and standardizing \nproducts, and promoting enabling contract. Recent efforts to \nboost agricultural productivity and rural incomes are prioritized \nlending and targeted measures to enhance commercialization, \nincluding support through financial inclusion and rural credit.\n\n\fIndia\n\nGrowth  slowed  down  last  year  as  a  credit  shortage  lowered  domestic  demand.  Inflation \nspiked  on  surging  vegetable  prices,  but  the  current  account  deficit  shrank  as  demand \nslowed. GDP growth will decline further this year owing to COVID-19 but rebound next year \non  government  initiatives  and  better  credit.  Inflation  will  decelerate  as  demand  weakens, \nthen reaccelerate as it revives. The current account deficit will narrow as global growth and \noil  prices  falter,  then  widen  as  the  economy  strengthens.\n\nFigure 3.17.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions to \n\ngrowth\n\nAgriculture\nManufacturing\nServices\nNet taxes on products\nOther industries\nGross domestic product at market prices\n\nPercentage points\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nNote: Other industries include mining and quarrying; \nconstruction; and electricity, gas, and other utilities.

Within FY2019, growth hit a 27-quarter low of 4.7% \nin the third quarter. With the COVID-19 outbreak starting in \nlate January and subsequently affecting India, the advance \nestimate of GDP growth in FY2019 is likely to be downgraded.\nAgriculture growth improved from 2.4% in FY2018 to a \nrobust 3.7% in FY2019 on improved grain output supported by \nrainfall above normal in the second half, adding 0.5 percentage \npoints to growth (Figure 3.17.1). Industry growth slowed to \n1.8%, its lowest growth rate since economic liberalization \nin FY1991, as manufacturing and construction weakened. \nWith\u00a0automobile sales down significantly, manufacturing \ngrew by only 0.9%, the slowest in more than 20 years. \nAfter\u00a0contracting in FY2018, mining recovered to grow by \n2.8%. In\u00a0sum, the contribution of industry to growth fell \nby more than half to 0.5 percentage points. With public \nadministration and other services expanding by 8.8%, service \ngrowth at 7.0% contributed 3.5 percentage points. Government \nmeasures to address financial sector stress helped growth in \nfinancial services, real estate, and other professional services \naccelerate from 6.8% in FY2018 to a robust 7.3%.\n\nOn the demand side, a decline in investment severely \ndragged down growth (Figure 3.17.2). After growing by an \nannual average of 7.2% over the past decade, gross fixed \ncapital formation contracted by 0.6% in FY2019, its worst \nshowing since FY2002. With consumer confidence sagging \nto its lowest in a decade (Figure 3.17.3), growth in private \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nThis chapter was written by Lei Lei Song of the South Asia Department, ADB, \nNew\u00a0Delhi, and Shalini Mittal, consultant, India Resident Mission, ADB, New Delhi.\n\n\f228(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nconsumption slowed from 7.2% in FY2018 to 5.3%, adding only \n3.0 percentage points to GDP growth in FY2019, the least since \nFY2009. Government consumption rose by 9.8%, contributing \n1.0 percentage point to GDP growth, as the government \nacted to support growth from the second quarter of FY2019. \nAs\u00a0domestic demand slowed, imports of goods and services fell, \nallowing net exports to improve and contribute 0.9 percentage \npoints to growth despite falling exports. \n\nThe growth slowdown in the past 3 years from a recent \nhigh of 8.3% in FY2016 reflects both cyclical and structural \nfactors. The economy had enjoyed fast growth at an annual \naverage of 7.5% from FY2013 to FY2016, driven largely by \nconsumption, both private and government. Credit from \nbanks and in particular nonbanking financial companies \n(NBFCs, including housing finance companies) supported this \nexpansion. Banks, particularly public sector banks constrained \nby high nonperforming loans (NPLs) from earlier periods, were \nnot as aggressive as before (Figure 3.17.4). NBFCs stepped up \nlending to consumers and businesses, expanding their share \nof nonfood credit (which excludes public sector loans for \nprocuring crops from farmers) from 19.0% to 22.1% in FY2013\u2013\nFY2016, with annual expansion averaging 16.3% in the period \n(Figure 3.17.5). \n\nThe growth trajectory was influenced by the \n\ndemonetization of large banknotes starting at the end of 2016 \nand the launch of a goods and services tax in mid-2017. Fueled \nby surging nonfood credit from NBFCs at 30.9%, growth in \nfinal domestic demand (private and public consumption plus \ngross capital formation) remained strong at 10.3% in FY2017. \nYet, the cash crunch induced by demonetization adversely \naffected domestic supply. As imports exploded and net exports \nsubtracted 2.8 percentage points, GDP growth declined to 7.0% \nin FY2017. \n\nStructural weakness underlay the cyclical downturn. As \nthe economy slowed, the asset quality of NBFCs deteriorated, \nwith NPLs rising from 2.4% of credit outstanding in FY2013 to \n6.1% in FY2018. This induced banks and institutional investors \nto cut their exposure to NBFCs, drying up their finance. \nA\u00a0large\u00a0NBFC defaulted on its bond obligations in September \n2018, sparking an NBFC crisis (see Policy Challenge below). \nWith banks and NBFCs stressed, a credit crunch ensured as \nthe flow of financial resources to businesses collapsed from the \nequivalent of 11.7% of GDP in FY2018 to 4.0% in the first half \nof FY2019 (Figure 3.17.6). The credit crunch directly induced a \ncontinued slowdown in FY2018 and FY2019.\n\nOther structural constraints were subdued job and \nwage growth and continued rural stress, which affected \nconsumption; inadequate infrastructure; progress of reform \nin key markets such as labor and land; and low tax revenue \nconstricting fiscal space. \n\nFigure 3.17.2\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\nNet exports\nOther investments\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product at market prices\n\nPercentage points\n12\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2016\n\n2019\n\nNotes: Other investments include valuables and changes \nin stocks.

Inflation excluding food and fuel rose slightly to \n4.2% in FY2019, with housing, health care, and education \ncontributing more than half to the increase (Figure 3.17.7).\n\nMonetary policy was accommodative as the Reserve Bank \n\nof India, the central bank, cut its policy rate by a total of 135 \nbasis points from February to October 2019. It refrained from \nfurther cuts before March 2020, citing elevated inflation. \nLending rates had come down by only 69 basis points since \nthe monetary easing cycle started, however, indicating weak \nmonetary transmission (Figure 3.17.8). With inflation above the \ntarget zone, the central bank pursued unconventional monetary \npolicy to improve both the cost and the availability of credit. \nIt introduced long-term repurchase operations with 1-year and \n3-year tenors at the policy rate and removed the quantitative \nrestriction on liquidity provisions. It\u00a0also exempted banks \ntemporarily from the cash reserve requirement for loans \nto micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), \nas well\u00a0as to finance car and home purchases; allowed the \ndeclaration of NPLs for commercial real estate to be delayed by \n1\u00a0year; and extended restructuring for stressed MSME loans. \nAs a result, bond yields fell immediately, and lending rates also \nstarted to\u00a0fall.\n\nthe central government invoked an escape clause in the \nFiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, which \nallows deviation from fiscal targets during structural reform. \nThe\u00a0fiscal deficit in FY2019 was revised up by 0.5 percentage \npoints to 3.8% (Figure 3.17.9). Fiscal stimulus equal to 0.5% of \nGDP was provided by lowering corporate tax rates. \n\nto 9.4% of GDP in FY2019, largely from shortfalls in tax \nrevenue. Budgeted to expand by 18.2% a year earlier, gross tax \nrevenue grew by only 3.8% as noncompliance and inefficient \nimplementation slowed growth in revenue from the goods \nand services tax. Further, the central government missed \nits disinvestment target with its failure to sell Air India, but \nnontax revenue still increased to equal 1.7% of GDP after the \ncentral bank transferred a dividend of $21.5 billion.\n\nThe government had little room to use fiscal policy to boost \n\neconomic activity in FY2019. Central government expenditure \ngrew less than budgeted, to equal 13.2% of GDP. Recurrent \nexpenditure was reduced to 11.5% of GDP largely through cuts to \nfood subsidies, but capital expenditure rose to equal 1.7% of GDP \nas the government pushed ahead with infrastructure projects.\n\nFigure 3.17.5\u2002 Nonfood credit growth\n\nBanks\nNonbanking \ufb01nancial companies\n\n%\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNote: Nonbanking \ufb01nancial companies include \nsystemically important \ufb01rms, some of which take deposits \nand some not, as well as housing \ufb01nance companies.

This narrowed the trade deficit despite exports \nof goods and services growing by a meager 0.9% because of \nthe global economic slowdown during the year. Rising trade \ntensions between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) did not benefit Indian exports. Their weak performance \nin a competitive manufacturing market was reflected by \ndeclining exports of textiles excluding readymade garments, \nagriculture and allied products, leather, engineering goods, and \nother manufactures.\n\nAfter growing at a robust pace over the past 2 years, the \nsurplus in service exports rose modestly by 1.7% in FY2019 \nas net receipts from financial, transport, travel, and other \nbusinesses increased despite generally weak global demand. \nRemittances, on the other hand, grew by double digits. \nOn\u00a0balance, the current account deficit shrank from the \nequivalent of 2.1% of GDP in FY2018 to 0.9% in FY2019.\n\nNet foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow remained \nhealthy at $54.1 billion in FY2019, an increase of $10.7 billion \nsupported by the opening of contract manufacturing, single-\nbrand retailing, and insurance intermediaries for FDI, among \nother liberalizations. Net foreign portfolio flow remained \npositive as investors became newly allowed to subscribe to \nlisted debt securities issued by real estate investment trusts, \nthen turned negative in March 2020 under COVID-19. \nEquity\u00a0inflow similarly grew modestly from the beginning of \nthe fiscal year in April 2019 to February 2020, as the Bombay \nStock Exchange Sensex Index rose by 9.8% over the same \n11\u00a0months of FY2018, before a substantial fall in March 2020 \n(Figure 3.17.11).\n\nThe Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 7.8% \n\nin FY2019, more than half of the decline occurring in March \n(Figure 3.17.12). In real effective terms based on consumer \nprices, however, it appreciated by 3.8% in FY2019 with the \nrecent spike in domestic inflation. The impact of appreciation \non trade competitiveness may be muted as this transitory \nquickening of inflation dissipates. India\u2019s international reserves \nincreased by $58.4 billion in FY2019 to $471.3 billion, or cover \nfor 9.3 months of imports (Figure 3.17.13).\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe COVID-19 pandemic jeopardizes global growth and \nIndia\u2019s\u00a0recovery.

Indian central and state \ngovernments have moved to contain the outbreak by closing \nborders and initiating a national lockdown from 25 March \nfor 21\u00a0days. Consumption and investment are expected to \nbe severely affected in the first quarter of FY2020, though \ndemand will recover strongly when the pandemic is eventually \ncontained in India and globally. India\u2019s low participation in \nglobal supply chains may help limit impact. The lowest oil prices \nin more than 15 years will, if sustained, benefit India as a large \noil importer and partly offset the adverse impact of COVID-19.\nEconomic growth showed signs of improvement before the \n\npandemic struck. New investment projects announced in the \nthird quarter of FY2019 were the highest in 7 quarters, with \nmore projects completed (Figure 3.17.14). The composite Nikkei \npurchasing managers\u2019 index for February 2020 remained above \n50, predicting expansion (Figure 3.17.15). In agriculture, the \narea reported sown with winter crops is higher than in FY2018, \nindicating a higher harvest to come. Industrial production grew \nin January 2020. In February, steel production rose year on year \nfor the first time in 6 months, and motor vehicle retail sales rose \nafter 11 months of decline.\n\nIn FY2020, the national lockdown and travel restrictions \n\nwill constrain economic activity. Financial market sell-offs \nand volatility may dampen consumer sentiment and investor \nconfidence, aggravating the impact. Financial conditions may \nstay strained as financial markets roil. Private consumption may \nsuffer as it did during the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 \nor even more. Gross fixed capital formation is likely to contract \nfurther as risk perception heightens and uncertainty deepens \nunder the pandemic.\n\nTo counter the impact of COVID-19, the central government \n\nhas allocated $2 billion to strengthen the health system \nand introduced a $22.5 billion (0.8% of GDP) relief package, \nincluding direct cash transfers and increased free distribution \nof food and gas to the poor and vulnerable, insurance covers \nfor health workers, welfare support for construction workers \nand support for small businesses. The central government \nhad increased capital expenditure to the equivalent of 1.8% of \nGDP in the FY2020 budget announced before the pandemic. \nTo\u00a0support an ambitious plan to invest $1.4 trillion in \ndesignated National Infrastructure Pipeline projects in the \nnext 5 years, the central government has allocated $3 billion as \nequity support to infrastructure finance companies to leverage \nmore long-term lending from the market. Central government \nexpenditure was budgeted to grow by 13.9% in FY2020.\nThe central bank on 27 March cut its policy rate by \n75\u00a0basis points to 4.4%, the lowest ever and rolled out a \nrange of measures to preserve financial stability and mitigate \nthe economic impact of COVID-19.

With inflation \nexpected to ease into the target zone soon, the central bank is \nlikely to cut policy rates further to counter financial volatility \nand support growth. The central bank has committed to using \nall instruments\u2014conventional and unconventional\u2014to fight the \npandemic.\n\nAssuming a normal monsoon in FY2020, agriculture is \nlikely to remain strong and support rural incomes. Government \nmeasures will alleviate rural distress and help revive rural \nconsumption. The FY2020 budget increased allocations to \nagriculture and rural sectors by 28.1% to equal 0.8% of GDP. \nA\u00a016-point action plan in the budget includes hikes to minimum \nsupport prices that aim to ensure a minimum 50% profit \nmargin to farmers, an ambitious target of $210 billion in credit \nto agriculture from public and private financial institutions, \nand an increased allocation to a central government program of \nconditional cash transfers to small landholders. A record high \nwinter crop in the second half of FY2019 will increase famers\u2019 \nincomes.\n\nDomestic demand will rebound strongly once the pandemic \n\npasses and full economic activity resumes. As consumer \nsentiment and investor confidence are restored, growth in \nconsumption and investment are expected to return to rates \nsimilar to before FY2019, or perhaps higher. \n\nGovernment initiatives introduced in late 2019 and in \nthe FY2020 budget will aid recovery and sustain growth in \nthe coming years. The recent budget introduced a simplified \npersonal income tax option that reduces tax rates for those \nearning less than $20,000 per year but forgoes exemptions and \ndeductions. This will increase household disposable income, \nthereby boost private consumption, and potentially expand the \ntax base. A taxpayers\u2019 charter enumerating their rights aims to \nengender more trust in government. \n\nPrivate investment, both domestic and foreign, will be \n\nencouraged by corporate tax cuts introduced in September 2019, \nwhich eased the average effective corporate tax rate including \nall surcharges from 30% to 25% and, for new manufacturing \ncompanies, to 17%. Investor sentiment should improve as well \nwith the removal of the dividend distribution tax, the extension \nof concessional corporate tax rates to new power companies, \nand tax relief introduced for start-ups.

However, this crisis requires expansionary \nfiscal policy to mitigate its effects and facilitate recovery.\n\nAfter growing by 0.5% in FY2019, exports of goods and \nservices are expected to contract in FY2020 with lower oil \nprices and global demand. Imports of goods and services are \nlikely to contract more than last year as falling oil prices reduce \nthe net oil import bill and domestic demand remains sluggish. \nThe surplus in services will decline, but the overall trade deficit \nis likely to shrink. Remittances will be hit by weak earnings \nabroad under depressed global growth and falling oil prices. \nOn\u00a0balance, the current account deficit is expected to narrow to \nthe equivalent of 0.3% of GDP in FY2020 (Figure 3.17.16).\n\nIn FY2021, exports of goods and services are expected \n\nto recover as the global economy rebounds. Exports are \nexpected\u00a0to grow at a pace similar to the 11.5% average in \nFY2016\u2013FY2018. Imports of goods and services, supported by \nrising domestic demand and oil prices, are likely to outgrow \nexports. As the trade deficit widens, the current account deficit \nis forecast to rise to equal 1.2% of GDP in FY2021.\n\nThe pandemic will slow global FDI flows in FY2020, but \nFDI flow into India is expected to rebound in FY2021 as global \nconditions improve and India remains an attractive investment \ndestination.

Reform will \nhelp. From FY2020, certain categories of government securities \nwill be fully open to nonresident investors, and the limit on \nforeign portfolio investment in corporate bonds will be raised. \nForeign exchange reserves may fall in FY2020 but are expected \nto increase in FY2021.\n\nRisks to the outlook are firmly on the downside. \nA\u00a0prolonged COVID-19 pandemic would push the global \neconomy into deep recession and further slow Indian growth. \nWere the virus to spread widely within India, economic activity \nwould be severely constrained. Failure to implement reform to \naddress structural weakness would further hamper recovery \nafter the pandemic. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening nonbank \nfinancing to support growth\nNonbanking financial companies (NBFCs) have become \nincreasingly important to financing the Indian economy, \nparticularly after 2013, as bank credit growth slowed in \nresponse to NPLs rapidly increasing to an 11.2% share of all \nloans outstanding in FY2017. Recently, NBFCs have become \nfragile, and the collapse of a large one triggered the credit \ncrunch that slowed growth in FY2019. Ensuring NBFC health \nhas become essential.\n\nComplementing regular commercial banks, NBFCs provide \n\ncredit to a wide variety of niche segments, ranging from \ninfrastructure to consumer durables. Some take deposits \n(NBFCs-D) and some not (NBFCs-ND). No new license has \nbeen issued to an NBFC-D since 1997. NBFCs-ND rely on \nmarkets and banks to raise money and are divided into those \nthat are systemically important (NBFCs-SI), with assets greater \nthan \u20b95 billion, and smaller ones. At the end of September 2019, \nthere were 82 NBFCs-D, 274 NBFCs-SI, and 9,187 others. Data \non smaller NBFCs-ND are not readily available and therefore \nnot discussed here. About 100 housing finance companies \n(HFCs) extend housing finance to individuals, cooperative \nsocieties, and corporations and lease commercial and \nresidential premises. They are also included as NBFCs after \ntheir regulation shifted from the National Housing Bank to the \ncentral bank in August 2019.\n\nNBFCs constitute the third largest segment in the Indian \n\nfinancial sector, after commercial banks and insurance \ncompanies. At the end of FY2018, NBFCs had assets of \n\u20b944.4\u00a0trillion, equal to 23.4% of GDP, with NBFCs-SI \naccounting for 60.0%, NBFCs-D 9.5%, and HFCs 30.5%. \n\nFigure 3.17.18\u2002 Borrowing by nonbanking \n\nfinancial companies\n\nPublic deposits\nDebentures\nBank borrowing\nCommercial paper\nOthers\n\n\u20b9 trillion\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nNotes: Nonbanking \ufb01nancial companies include \nsystemically important \ufb01rms, some of which take deposits \nand some not, as well as housing \ufb01nance companies.

At the end of September 2019, NBFCs had \nraised funds mainly from debentures at 37.3% of the total, bank \nborrowing at 25.4%, and commercial papers at about 5.0% \n(Figure 3.17.18).\n\nNonfood credit extended by NBFCs has registered \naverage annual growth at 20.0% since FY2013, financing \nmainly industry, housing, services, and automobile purchases \n(Figure\u00a03.17.19). As this doubled growth in bank nonfood credit, \nthe share of NBFCs in outstanding of nonfood credit increased \nfrom 19.0% in FY2013 to 26.1% in FY2018 (Figure 3.17.20). \n\nHowever, the asset quality of NBFCs has deteriorated as \nthey expanded. The NPLs of NBFCs excepting HFCs increased \nfrom 2.6% of all loans at the end of FY2013 to 6.1% just 5 years \nlater. In September 2018, one of largest NBFCs, Infrastructure \nLeasing and Finance Company (IL&FS), defaulted on its bond \nobligations. IL&FS had borrowed heavily from banks and the \ncorporate bond market, attracting investors like mutual funds, \npension funds, and corporations, and was rated highly by \ndomestic rating agencies. \n\nThe IL&FS default triggered panic in the financial \n\nmarket. Liquidity soon dried up in the entire NBFC segment \nas banks and mutual funds cut their exposure to NBFCs. \nThis dramatically cut the flow of resources from NBFCs to \nbusinesses, by 69.2% in FY2018 and a further 66.3% in the first \nhalf of FY2019. As bank credit flows fell as well, total financial \nflows to businesses plunged by 60.3% year on year in the first \nhalf of FY2019, creating the credit crunch. \n\nIn the wake of the IL&FS crisis, the central government \n\nhas moved to cushion its impact. It launched a \u20b91 trillion \npartial credit guarantee program to protect NBFC lending that \nsatisfied program criteria, and it contributed \u20b9100 billion to a \n\u20b9250 billion alternative investment fund to provide last-mile \nfunding to stalled housing developments. \n\nAs the regulator, the central bank acted to ensure the flow \nof bank lending to NBFCs: reducing risk weights on lending to \nNBFCs to make them similar to weights for other companies, \nincreasing limits on bank exposure to single-borrower NBFCs \nfrom 10% to 20% of the bank\u2019s tier-1 capital, and allowing \nbanks to lend to registered NBFCs (other than micro-finance \ninstitutions) for onlending to micro and small enterprises, to \nthe housing sector, and, as term loans only, to agriculture. \n\nThese measures have prevented further NBFC-SI failures \nand perhaps a financial crisis. Since then, banks have increased \nlending to NBFCs and improved their liquidity. Yet, bank \nlending may be skewed in favor of large and highly rated \nNBFCs. Smaller, less-established, and lower-rated NBFCs \ncontinued to struggle for funds. Bond market liquidity for \nNBFCs and HFCs remained tight. \n\n\f236(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nNBFCs carry risks inherent to their business nature. \n\nThey rely on wholesale funding and face liquidity risks \nwhen markets seize up. Their focus on particular market \nsegments concentrates risk. With less stringent regulation and \nsupervision, NBFCs tend to be excessively leveraged, and their \nlending is likely procyclical. Further, unlike banks, NBFCs \ncannot borrow from the central bank when in difficulty, and \ndeposit insurance schemes do not apply.\n\nReform is needed to address the structural issues in NBFCs. \n\nThey need to diversify funding sources by accessing broader \npools of capital, especially those with long-maturity liabilities \nsuch as pension funds and insurance companies. Debt pooling \nto securitize NBFC assets would help but would require better \ndisclosure and market transparency. Credible and reliable \nratings are crucial for attracting large pools of investments \nin NBFCs. Further regulatory intervention is necessary to \nimprove governance in rating agencies and strengthen their \ncapacity. \n\nRegulatory and supervisory oversight of NBFCs-SI in \nparticular must be enhanced, given their strong links with the \neconomy. A proper mechanism is needed to control risk and \nensure soundness, which could include regular and detailed \naudits and inspection by the regulator, new limits on liquidity \nand asset liability mismatch, and regular reviews of asset \nquality. \n\nMaking NBFC supervision more stringent and comparable \n\nto bank supervision will be a challenge for the central bank. \nWhile there are some 90 scheduled commercial banks, \nNBFCs-SI number close to 300. Supervising such a large \nnumber of entities to the same standard of coverage and \ndetail will require the central bank to significantly expand its \ncapacity. \n\n\fMaldives\n\nGrowth  slowed  in  2019  with  a  steep  fall  in  construction  and  moderation  in  tourism \nincome despite higher visitor arrivals. Policy support kept inflation minimal. Lower imports \nnarrowed the current account deficit, which remained large and is forecast higher in 2020 \nand  2021.  The  outlook  is  for  a  growth  collapse  in  2020  as  tourism  plummets  under  the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  but  then  a  revival  in  2021.

Public \nSector Investment Program spending in 2019 fell by 26% from \na year earlier, and growth in bank loans to private developers \nfor construction and real estate slowed from 22.1% in 2018 to \n9.3%. Tracking this falloff in spending, growth in imports of \nconstruction goods reversed a marked 35.6% increase in 2018 to \ndecline by 11.7%. \n\nGrowth in tourist arrivals increased from 6.8% in 2018 to \n14.7%, to reach a record of 1.7 million visitors in 2019. Arrivals \nbenefited from political stability, increased flight connections, \nthe opening of new resorts, and extensive marketing campaigns. \nEuropean tourists grew by 14.8%, accounting for almost half of \nthe increase and maintaining the highest regional market share at \n49.0%. Asian arrivals substantially recovered from a 1.0% decline \nin 2018 to expand by 13.8% in 2019. The recovery was largely \nan 83.5% expansion in Indian visitors, accounting for 34.6% of \ngrowth in arrivals. Tourist arrivals from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) reversed a 7.6% drop in 2018 to grow by a marginal \n0.3%. Although declining in recent years, visitors from the PRC \nwere 16.7% of arrivals in 2019, while the Indian share rose from \n6.1% to 9.7%. \n\nDespite higher growth in tourist arrivals and a 12.8% increase \n\nin hotel bed-nights\u2014an occupancy measure used as a proxy for \ntourism earnings\u2014preliminary estimates show growth in travel \n\nThis chapter was written by Masato Nakane of the South Asia Department, \nADB, Manila, and Abdula Ali and Macrina Mallari, consultants, South Asia \nDepartment, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f238(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nreceipts slowing sharply from 10.4% in 2018 to 4.3% in 2019, \nindicating weaker tourist spending. Apart from preliminary data, \nthe failure of income growth to match increased arrivals may \nreflect more tourists staying at the country\u2019s new mid-priced hotels \nand fewer at luxury resorts (Figure 3.18.2). \n\nFish exports in 2019 fell by 14.3% in volume terms and by 13.6% \n\nin earnings as both demand and prices fell. Financial services, \ntransportation, and communications performed well in 2019. \n\nAverage inflation remained subdued at 0.2% in 2019, owing \nmainly to the government\u2019s administrative price controls on the \nstaples rice, flour, and sugar, as well as lower global prices for \noil and food products (Figure 3.18.3). With inflationary pressure \nlow, the Maldives Monetary Authority has maintained the \naccommodative policy in force since it lowered the indicative \nmonetary policy rate in 2015. \n\nFiscal policy was expansionary. With a supplementary budget \n\napproved during the year, the budget deficit increased from the \nequivalent of 5.2% of GDP in 2018 to 5.7%. Recurrent expenditure \nincreased by 14.0%, mainly reflecting the first full year of a new \npay structure for civil servants introduced in 2018, as well as \nadditional employees recruited for newly established government \nagencies. This increase pushed growth in total expenditure, despite \nweak capital expenditure, up by 9.6%, raising expenditure as a \npercentage of GDP from 32.3% in 2018 to 33.1%. A large increase in \ngrants raised total revenue slightly to 27.4% of GDP even as weaker \neconomic growth during the year held growth in domestic revenue \nto only 2.8%. As a percentage of GDP, domestic revenue slipped \nfrom 26.1% in 2018 to 25.0% in 2019 (Figure 3.18.4). \n\nGovernment external debt including Rf11.8 billion in state loan \n\nguarantees increased to Rf33.8 billion in 2019, equal to 38.5% of \nGDP, mainly with the disbursement of guaranteed loans to state-\nowned enterprises. Government domestic debt including Rf966 \nmillion in debt guarantees rose to reach Rf33.2 billion or 37.8% \nof GDP, up from 35.8% in 2018. At the end of 2019, total public \ndebt including state guarantees was estimated to have increased \nby 12.0% to Rf67.02 billion, or 76.3% of GDP (Figure 3.18.5). \nThis development underscores an International Monetary Fund \nassessment that Maldives continues to face a high risk of public \nexternal debt distress. \n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from the equivalent \n\nof 26.1% of GDP in 2018 to an estimated 21.5% as provisional \nestimates indicate that the merchandise trade deficit reversed 27.1% \ndeterioration a year earlier with 5.5% improvement. Imports fell \nby 4.0% on lower demand for construction goods, machinery, and \nelectrical equipment as investment slackened, while exports rose \nby 7.4% as fuel reexports more than offset the drop in fish exports. \nThe current account deficit was financed by net financial account \ninflow, mainly foreign direct investment and other investment \nliabilities predominantly incurred by state-owned enterprises with \ngovernment guarantees (Figure 3.18.6). \n\n%\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n-8\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\nFigure 3.18.2\u2002 Tourism indicators\n\nTourist arrival growth\nTravel receipt growth\n\nAverage stay\n\nDays\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2020.

Preliminary numbers for February \n2020 indicate a 14% decline in tourist arrivals from February \n2019, including a 95% drop in visitors from the PRC. Notably, the \ngovernment has suspended direct flights from the PRC, some \nEuropean countries, and several other countries and all cruise \nship arrivals and has restricted entry of all persons, regardless \nof nationality, who have embarked or transited through the \ncountries with travel ban. Consequently, earnings will fall \nsubstantially, as the PRC is the largest single source market for \nMaldives, and Europe collectively supplies about half of visitors. \nInitial estimates show a wide range of possible impacts on \nthe economy from reduced tourism depending on the severity \nand duration of the contagion in Maldives\u2019 main tourist markets. \nIn terms of lost income, the impact could be in the range of $329 \nmillion\u2013$657 million, which would contract GDP by 6.2%\u201312.3%. \nThough the impact may well be near the upper end of estimates in \n2020, tourism can be expected to make a strong comeback in 2021 \nas pent-up demand is released\u2014assuming that efforts to test for \nand contain the virus succeed. \n\nSlowing in construction and real estate will likewise continue \nin 2020 as financing becomes a problem with decreased tourism \nearnings, which on average accounts for more than 50% of \ngovernment\u2019s total revenues. If the decline in tourist arrivals \nlasts, the government anticipates a shortfall in total revenues \nbetween $135.9 million and $446.6 million. Supply of construction \nmaterials is likely to be affected due to COVID-19 halting some \ninfrastructure projects such as housing. Private-led investments in \nhousing and tourism are also expected to be adversely affected. \n\nConstruction, however, is poised to recover in 2021 especially \n\nthat a number of large and high priority projects are slated to \ncommence including three bridges connecting the Greater Male\u2019 \nArea and an international port in Gulhifalhu. \n\nProspects for fisheries might be hurt as well due to COVID-19 \n\nparticularly for exports of chilled and frozen fish. The export of \nchilled yellowfin tuna to Europe has declined and it is likely to \nfollow similar trends in Asian markets in the coming months.\n\nOn balance, GDP growth is expected to contract by 3.0% in \n2020, given the bleak outlook for tourism and other sectors in the \nshadow of COVID-19, before it rebounds to 7.5% in 2021 with the \nanticipated rebound in tourism and robust construction growth.\n\nPublic \n\n% of GDP\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2020.

Consequences \nwould be suppressed tourism earnings for a second year and \nrenewed concerns about fiscal and public debt sustainability, \ngiven the country\u2019s very high debt ratio and persistently thin \nstock of usable foreign exchange reserves. \n\nDownward pressure on inflation will continue under the \ngovernment\u2019s prevailing policies to lower electricity prices and \nharmonize staple food prices across the country, and with more \nsubdued prices anticipated for oil on the world market. However, \nlate shipments of imported products disrupted by COVID-19\u2014\nespecially products from the PRC, which account for more than \n16% of  all imports\u2014may create supply shortages and push local \nprices up for a time. On balance, though, inflation is forecast to \naverage 1.0% in 2020, marginally increasing to 1.2% in 2021. \nThe current account deficit is projected to worsen to the \nequivalent of 23.0% of GDP in 2020 as tourism income dwindles. \nThe anticipated tourism recovery in 2021, though, will help \nnarrow the current account deficit that year to 22.0% of GDP. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014implementing \ndecentralized governance\nThe 2008 Constitution and the Decentralization Act 2010 \nprovide a legal framework for decentralization in Maldives. \nThe Constitution formally established the role of local councils \nin governance, and the Decentralization Act paved the way for \nthe first elections of island, atoll, and city councils in 2011.

It also created the \nWomen\u2019s Development Committee as an integral part of local \ngovernance, advancing gender inclusion. \n\nHowever, the implementation of the act and of \n\ndecentralization have been slow, mainly because local councils\u2019 \ninstitutional capacity has been weak and amendments to the act \nreturned certain devolved powers to the central government.\nIn 2018, a new government brought decentralization back \nagain to the fore as a priority of the Maldives Strategic Action \nPlan, 2019\u20132023. In December 2019, the newly\u2013elected President \nof Maldives ratified eight amendments to the Decentralization \nAct that grant more fiscal autonomy to local councils by allotting \nat least 5.0% of national revenue, or more than 4.0% of the \nbudget, to local councils as block grants, empowering them to \ncollect fees for municipal services and to borrow and manage \ndebt provided it aligns with national fiscal policy (Box 3.18.1 \nand Figure 3.18.8). They transfer municipal functions to local \ncouncils that can more efficiently and effectively deliver services \nlocally and give councils authority to manage human resources \n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.18.7\u2002 Gross international reserves\n\nTotal reserves\nUsable reserves\n\nTotal reserves\nimport coverage\nUsable reserves\nimport coverage\n\n$ million\n\nMonths of imports\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Maldives Monetary Authority. 2020.

The country\u2019s current fiscal and \ndebt circumstances leave little fiscal space to fully allocate the \nenvisaged resources to local councils. Worryingly, the power to \nborrow may further deteriorate the national debt. \n\nAs the experiences of other countries have demonstrated, \ndecentralization is not a simple or linear process. Sri Lanka\u2019s \ndevolution entailed high administrative costs arising \nfrom complexity, duplication, conflict, and fragmentation. \nDecentralization in the Philippines was constrained by a lack of \nhuman, technical, and financial capacity in local governments. \n\nMaldives would be well advised to adopt a gradual \n\napproach to decentralization, rather than devolving substantial \nfunctions all at once. The central government should start by \ndevolving a small selection of services and functions to local \ngovernments while providing proper training to strengthen \nlocal council capacity. Then devolution can build on established \nsuccess. As noted by a World Bank study, successful cases of \ndecentralization in developing countries followed an incremental \nprocess in which policies and programs were carefully designed, \norganized, and carried out to build local institutional capacity.\n\n\fNepal\n\nGrowth  accelerated  in  fiscal  2019  on  a  bumper  harvest,  buoyant  tourist  arrivals,  a  pickup \nin  remittances,  and  accelerated  private  investment.  Inflation  was  moderate,  and  the \ncurrent account deficit declined but remained large. The outlook is for moderating growth \non  adverse  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  weaker  tourism,  slowing  remittances,  and \nless  buoyant  agriculture.  The  current  account  deficit  is  expected  to  narrow,  mainly  on \nreduced  imports  as  investment  stabilizes.  The  authorities  should  strengthen  the  small \nexport  sector  by  facilitating  the  creation  of  well-considered  special  economic  zones.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth accelerated to an estimated 7.1% in fiscal year 2019 \n(FY2019, ended 16 July 2019) from 6.7% a year earlier. Strong \nrecovery in agriculture accounted for the bulk of the advance, \nbut support came as well from stepped-up tourist arrivals and \nremittances and an uptick in private investment (Figure 3.19.1). \nServices, contributing slightly over half of GDP, saw growth rise \nto 7.3% on higher remittances, which supported retail trade, and \nbuoyant tourist arrivals, which favored hotels, restaurants, and \nother tourism services. Industry, providing 15.2% of GDP, saw \ngrowth broadly unchanged at 8.1%, sustained by strengthening \nin other sectors and a stable political environment.\n\nOn the demand side, accelerated consumption expenditure \nfacilitated by remittance growth dominated spending in FY2019. \nPrivate investment, mostly in energy and services, grew by 27.0% \nto equal almost a third of GDP. Public investment increased by \nonly 5.5%, however, following a 54.2% surge in FY2018, owing to \nconstruction delays affecting national pride projects. \n\nInflation edged up from 4.2% in FY2018 to 4.6% in FY 2019 \n\n(Figure 3.19.2). Food inflation rose from 2.7% in FY2018 to \naverage 3.1% as floods and landslides in early July created food \nprice pressures, as did delayed food supply from India caused \nby strict tests for pesticide residues conducted at customs points \nalong the border. Price pressures markedly escalated in the final \nmonths of the year as food inflation accelerated in India and \nfurther intensified in the first half of FY2020. Strong demand \npushed nonfood including service inflation higher, from an \naverage of 5.3% in FY2018 to 5.9%.\n\nThe fiscal deficit, having risen to the equivalent of 6.7% \n\nof GDP in FY2018, moderated to 5.1% in FY2019 as capital \nexpenditure underperformed expectations (Figure 3.19.3).

Revenue increased by 4.2% mainly on \nhigher customs earnings from import growth and improvements \nin tax administration, notably advances in custom valuation \nprocedures, the adoption of risk-based custom clearance, and the \nimplementation of an e-payment system. \n\nGrowth in broad money (M2) supply moderated from 19.4% \nin FY2018 to 15.8% in FY2019, slowed by dwindling net foreign \nassets and only a modest rise in net domestic assets (Figure \n3.19.4). Credit to the private sector decelerated from 22.3% \ngrowth in FY2018 to 19.1% a year later, suppressed by higher \nlending rates and intermittent liquidity crunches. A contributing \ncause of these liquidity crunches was increased domestic \nborrowing since FY2018 to enable fiscal transfers to newly \ncreated subnational governments. Nepal Rastra Bank, the central \nbank, sought to address liquidity shortages by lowering the cash \nreserve ratio for banks and financial institutions. \n\nExport earnings exceeded expectations with a surge in \nexports of palm oil and jute. But with a low export base and \nrising imports of oil and other products, Nepal\u2019s large trade \ndeficit was little changed from a year earlier, at the equivalent of \n37.1% of GDP. Workers\u2019 remittances increased healthily by 7.8% \nas the Nepalese rupee depreciated against the US dollar and \nthe authorities cracked down on informal means of remitting. \nNet invisible earnings increased slightly to equal 29.4% of GDP, \nnarrowing the current account deficit slightly to 7.7% of GDP \n(Figure 3.19.5). The deficit was financed primarily by external \nborrowing but required a drawdown of foreign exchange \nreserves, shrinking them by 5.8% to $9.5 billion at the end of \nFY2019 but leaving import cover strong at 7.8 months (Figure \n3.19.6).\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is expected to moderate from 7.1% in FY2019 to \n5.3% in FY2020 for several reasons, notably the global outbreak \nof COVID-19 pandemic. The nationwide lock-down imposed \nfrom 24 March to 7 April and its subsequent effects mainly \non industry and services and potential fall in remittances will \nundermine growth prospects. Lower agricultural output, in \nparticular of rice, which supplies nearly 7% of GDP will also \ndampen growth prospects. A late monsoon, flooding in some \nareas in early July, and pest infestation in others are the main \ncauses. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has dampened mainly \nservices, constricting growth prospects. \n\nIndustrial output will slacken in response to reduced \ndomestic demand further worsened by COVID-19 pandemic. \nBoth supply and demand of industrial output, except essential \ngoods and services, have substantially dropped during this lock-\n\nFigure 3.19.3\u2002 Fiscal indicators\n\nDomestic revenue\nGrants\nRecurrent expenditure\nCapital expenditure\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n% of GDP\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n-50\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending in mid July of that year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

Major industries like cement, iron, steel, and bricks are \noperating below their full potential. Weaker demand is partly \na matter of earthquake reconstruction winding down after 2 \nfiscal years of acceleration. Further, slack budget execution in \nthe first 6 months of FY2020 has curbed demand, most notably \nfor construction materials. Capital expenditure grew by 13.2% \nin FY2020 to mid-January, down from 14.7% a year earlier, \nwhile the execution of annual capital budget fell to 15.2% from \n17.2% (Figure 3.19.7). Moreover, the limited disbursement of \nlarge allocations for national pride projects has deepened the \nslowdown.\n\nService growth will wane in FY2020 with a slowdown in \ntourist arrivals. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has markedly \nreduced tourist arrivals. January 2020 arrivals from all markets \nwere 2.0% lower than a year earlier (Figure 3.19.8). \n\nPrivate consumption growth will decelerate on diminishing \n\nremittance growth that fell to a mere 1.3% in the first half \nof the FY2020 after rising by 17.6% in the year earlier period \n(Figure 3.19.9). The remittance income will be lower in the \nfourth quarter of this fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nDomestic spending particularly on travel and recreation will \nplunge this fiscal year because of COVID-19 pandemic. The \nextent of weakening will however rest on the persistence of \nthis disease. The decline could be more if there is a wide and \nprolonged outbreak of the COVID-19. Budget execution on \nlarge infrastructure projects was sluggish in the first 6 months \nof FY2020, limiting growth in fixed investment. The midyear \nreview of the FY2020 budget envisages a deficit equal to 6.5% of \nGDP, but it will likely be lower as capital expenditure is expected \nto continue to underperform allocation. Moreover, COVID-19 has \naffected the implementation of ongoing projects. The temporary \nlockdown imposed from March 24 to 30 has further raised \nuncertainty with regard to project implementation. \n\nThe trade deficit reversed the marked 19.2% expansion in the \nfirst half of FY2019 to narrow by 5.5% in the first half of FY2020. \nAbout two-thirds of the improvement reflected reduced imports, \nespecially of vehicles and construction materials, and the balance \na strong increase in exports, in particular a surge in palm oil \nshipments to India. The improved trade balance in the period \ncombined with remittance growth, however tepid, shrank the \ncurrent account deficit from $1.3billion to $0.7 billion. Reflecting \ndevelopments to date, the full-year current account deficit is \nforecast to narrow from the equivalent of 7.7% of GDP in FY2019 \nto 5.0%, mainly reflecting slowing import growth. \n\nInflation will move up from 4.6% in FY2019 to average \n6.0%. Headline inflation averaged 6.4% in the first 6 months \nof FY2020, significantly higher than 4.2% a year earlier. \nFood\u00a0inflation increased by 10.2% in the first half of FY2020 \nwith big increases in prices for vegetables, spices, and alcoholic \nbeverages.

Prices of \nnonfood items such as clothing and footwear, furnishings and \nhousehold equipment, healthcare and education services soared \nin the first half of FY2020. Rising inflationary pressure in \nneighboring India has a direct bearing on inflation in Nepal, as \nnearly two-thirds of its international trade is with India. \n\nGDP growth at 6.4% is envisaged for FY2021, assuming a \nquick end of COVID-19 pandemic, a rapid recovery from this \ndisease, a normal monsoon and success in ongoing efforts to \nimprove the business climate. Two very large infrastructure \nprojects\u2014the 456-megawatt Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric \nProject and Gautam Buddha International Airport\u2014will underpin \ninvestment, with both expected to begin operations by FY2021. \nFurther growth stimulation is expected from higher spending by \nsubnational governments. \n\nInflation is forecast to moderate to an average of 5.5% in \n\nFY2021, assuming a better harvest, subdued oil prices, and \nmore moderate inflation in India. The current account deficit \nis expected to widen from the equivalent of 5.0% of GDP in \nFY2020 to 5.6% as imports of capital goods surge. However, \nthe deficit will be largely contained by low oil prices, a gradual \nreduction in the quantity of fuel imports as hydroelectricity \nincreasingly replaces internal combustion generators, and higher \nhydroelectricity exports to India.\n\nPossible downside risks to the outlook are natural hazards \n\nlike erratic monsoons and floods, which would depress farm \noutput and damage infrastructure. Subnational spending may \nunderperform for lack of capacity to utilize grants and execute \nprojects in provincial and local governments. Exogenous shocks \nsuch as COVID-19 may weaken global demand more than \nexpected and slash out-migration for employment, undermining \nthe outlook for narrowing the current account deficit. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014operationalizing special \neconomic zones \nSpecial economic zones (SEZs) are delineated areas in a country \nthat have distinct economic regulations and incentives that are \nmore liberal or business friendly than those generally prevailing \nin the economy. SEZs are established to promote more rapid \neconomic growth, in particularly by attracting foreign direct \ninvestment. Notably, about 70% of foreign greenfield investment \nin developing economies has been made in SEZs in recent years. \nWell-functioning SEZs could play a key role in expanding \nNepal\u2019s exports, which currently finance only 8% of imports, \nthereby reducing a large trade deficit and its risks to Nepal\u2019s \n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.19.8\u2002 Tourist arrival\n\nThousands\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Department of Immigration.\n\nFigure 3.19.9\u2002 Migrant workers and \n\nremittances\n\nNumber of migrant \nworkers\n\nWorkers\u2019 remittances\n\nThousands\n\n$ billion\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2016\n\n2019 H1\n2013\n\nH1\n2016\n\nH1\n2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending in mid July of that year.\nSources: Department of Foreign Employment; \nNepal\u00a0Rastra Bank.\n\n\f246(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nexternal position as rapid growth in remittances fades. \nExport growth is hindered by the country\u2019s poor business \nclimate, reflected in Doing Business 2020 ranking Nepal at \n94 out of 190 economies because of its lengthy processes for \ninitiating a business, registering property, and paying taxes. \nSuch\u00a0hurdles have constrained foreign investment and deterred \ndiversification, largely confining exports to primary products \nwith little value added. \n\nA well-considered SEZ can offer qualifying investors \n\nnecessary infrastructure and associated services; an \nincentivized tax regime with varying exemptions from income \ntax, excise duty, and value-added tax; and quick one-stop-\nservices for investment approvals, customs clearances, \nimmigration concerns, foreign workers\u2019 employment, banking, \nincome repatriation, and other business requirements. \n\nThe government created in 2004 what is now called \nthe Special Economic Zone Authority. The SEZ Act was \npromulgated in 2016, and SEZ regulations in 2017 (Box 3.19.1). \nThe legislation was intended to give the Special Economic \nZone Authority the means to induce greater investment by \nproviding a favorable business environment and tax incentives. \nThe authority currently operates the Bhairahawa SEZ near the \nborder with India. \n\nWhen the Bhairahawa SEZ was initiated in 2014, nearly \ntwo dozen firms applied to establish business operations in it. \nHowever, several later withdrew, and just three have begun \nproduction. The apparently unsuccessful takeoff of this initial \nSEZ is traceable to a dearth of services, notably the lack of \none-stop-services such as a customs desk, inadequate provision \nof dedicated electricity and water supplies, and muddled \ntax incentives. Various amenities such as banks, insurance \ncompanies, and a medical center are not yet established. \n\nFor industries within an SEZ to flourish and boost the \neconomy, provisions envisaged under the SEZ Act must be \neffectively implemented. Apart from one-stop-services that \nmostly importantly address administrative hurdles, the \nprovision of serviced land, water and electricity supplies, and \nconnectivity to major highways and border points are crucial to \nattracting investment in an SEZ. The experience at Bhairahawa \nindicates that higher priority needs to be placed on properly \ndeveloping SEZs and ensuring that adequate capacity and \nresources are available to the SEZ Authority to execute its \nmandate effectively.\n\nStrong coordination among stakeholders will be crucial for \n\nSEZs to succeed under Nepal\u2019s new federal system.

Growth  is  expected  to  be \nfurther  constrained  this  year  by  ongoing  stabilization  efforts,  slower  growth  in  agriculture, \nand the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, before recovering next year. The current account \nand  fiscal  deficits  will  narrow  further,  but  inflation  is  expected  to  leap  briefly  into  double \ndigits.

The slowdown reflected macroeconomic imbalances \nand faltering investment. Policy measures geared toward fiscal \nconsolidation and monetary tightening were implemented as \nprior actions agreed with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) under an Extended Fund Facility arrangement approved \nin July 2019. Slower growth spanned all sectors. Growth in \nlivestock, which contributes almost two-thirds of agricultural \noutput, accelerated slightly to 4.0% in FY2019, but agricultural \nproduction as a whole expanded by only 0.8%, owing to high \ninput costs and water shortages. The sector\u2019s contribution to \nGDP growth dropped from 0.7 percentage points in FY2018 to \nonly 0.2 points in FY2019. \n\nGrowth in industry fell markedly from 4.9% in FY2018 to \n1.4% in FY2019, sharply lowering its contribution to growth to \n2.8 percentage points. Large-scale manufacturing output fell by \n2.1% in FY2019, the first decline in a decade, because demand \nweakened and construction slumped as public development \nspending plummeted. Electricity production, by contrast, \nsurged by 40.5% as new generation projects were completed and \ncame online. The slowdown in agriculture and manufacturing, \nexacerbated by weaker demand and higher costs, caused growth \nin service output to slow from 6.2% in FY2018 to 4.7% in FY2019, \nlowering the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP growth from 3.8 \npercentage points in FY2018 to 2.8 points (Figure 3.20.1). \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption, which accounts \n\nfor 81.8% of GDP, grew more slowly in FY2019 as subdued \noutput growth translated to lower incomes. The contribution of \ntotal consumption to GDP growth thus fell from 6.1 percentage \n\nThis chapter was written by Khadija Ali and Kiyoshi Taniguchi of the Pakistan \nResident Mission, ADB, Islamabad, and Cara Tinio of the Pacific Department, \nADB, Manila. \n\n\f248(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\npoints in FY2018 to 4.1 points in FY2019. Investment contracted, \nshaving 0.9 points from growth, as uncertainty caused by \na delay in the government\u2019s decision to seek support from \nthe IMF lowered private investment, and public investment \nbegan to taper as infrastructure projects were completed. The \ncontribution of net exports, which subtracted 2.3 percentage \npoints from growth in FY2018, recovered to a 0.1 point \ncontribution in FY2019. (Figure 3.20.2) \n\nInflation accelerated from 4.7% in FY2018 to 6.8% in \nFY2019 on poor harvests, tariff increases, and Pakistan rupee \ndepreciation against the US dollar by 24.0% following the \nadoption of a more flexible exchange rate. Food price inflation \nrose to 4.6%, while inflation for other goods accelerated to 9.2% \nas tariffs on energy products were raised to manage mounting \nfiscal pressures. Inflation was estimated using rebased prices \nfrom FY2016 (Figure 3.20.3).\n\nTo counter inflation, the State Bank of Pakistan, the central \n\nbank, raised its policy interest rate by a cumulative 575 basis \npoints to 12.25% at the end of FY2019 (Figure 3.20.4). Private \nsector credit remained stable during the fiscal year at the \nequivalent of 17.3% of GDP, while government borrowing from \ncommercial banks continued to decline and be replaced mainly \nby external borrowing (Figure 3.20.5). Growth in broad money \nincreased from 9.7% in FY2018 to 11.3% in FY2019. \n\nThe consolidated federal and provincial budget deficit rose \nsharply from the equivalent of 6.5% of GDP in FY2018 to 8.9% in \nFY2019, mainly as revenue collections faltered. Revenue subsided \nfrom 15.1% of GDP in FY2018 to 12.7% in FY2019 as tax receipts, \nwhich provide over 90% of revenue, declined to the equivalent of \n11.6% of GDP because of economic deceleration, tax concessions \non personal income, and the suspension of sales and withholding \ntaxes on petroleum products and mobile phone loads. Nontax \nrevenues were halved to 1.1% of GDP in FY2019 as central bank \nprofits fell. Public spending remained stable at the equivalent of \n21.6% of GDP in FY2019 despite a rise in current expenditures \nto 18.4% of GDP as tighter monetary policy pushed up interest \npayments. Federal and provincial development spending was \ncurtailed to offset this increase (Figure 3.20.6). \n\nGross public debt climbed to equal 84.8% of GDP in FY2019, \nstill well above the 60.0% threshold mandated under the Fiscal \nResponsibility and Debt Limitation Act. Less than half of the \nincrease was traceable to the high fiscal deficit. Borrowing \nincreased during the fiscal year mainly in response to the \nsteep currency depreciation, bilateral and multilateral inflows \nto finance the deficit in the balance of payments, and planned \nborrowing from the central bank above budgetary requirements \nto provide some fiscal space for FY2020.\n\nPakistan\u2019s current account deficit narrowed from 6.3% of \nGDP in FY2018 to 4.9% in FY2019 as remittances rose by 9.7%, \nand the trade balance improved (Figure 3.20.7).

Despite currency \ndepreciation, merchandise exports also declined by 2.1%, as \nsoftening international prices forced down the prices fetched by \nkey textile products (Figure 3.20.8). \n\nThe investment needs of some energy projects under the \n\nChina\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor eased as they neared \ncompletion, which lowered financial inflow in FY2019. Foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) plunged by 52.0% to $1.7 billion. Portfolio \ninvestment recorded net outflow of $1.4 billion as the government \nretired a $1.0 billion eurobond, and private investors exited the \nequity market in anticipation of substantial currency depreciation \nand monetary tightening. Gross foreign exchange reserves fell \nby $2.5 billion to reach $7.3 billion at the end of FY2019, enough \nto cover a scant 1.5 months of imports (Figure 3.20.9). With FDI \nsubdued in FY2019, Pakistan managed to finance its current \naccount deficit and meet debt repayment obligations only with \nthe help of higher official inflows from multilateral and bilateral \npartners, including one-off payments from the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth is forecast to decelerate to 2.6% in FY2020 as \nongoing stabilization efforts further curtail economic activity. \nAgriculture is expected to see slow growth as the worst locust \ninfestation in over 2 decades damages harvests of cotton, \nwheat, and other major crops. The government has declared a \nnational emergency to combat the infestation. Modest growth is \nexpected in some export-oriented industries such as textiles and \nleather. However, large-scale manufacturing, which provides \nover half of industrial production, will likely contract, as it did \nin the first half of FY2020 when currency depreciation ran \nup production costs for some industries and forced them to \nraise their prices. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will pose \na downside risk to growth prospects as it further dampens \nconsumer demand and as private businesses are temporarily \nshutdown in efforts to control the pandemic. \n\nGrowth is expected to accelerate to 3.2% in FY2021, driven \nby a rebound in investment as macroeconomic imbalances are \ncorrected, currency depreciation is contained, and the locust \ninfestation subsides. Investment may also receive a boost from \nthe implementation of critical structural reform to improve \nenergy production and distribution and the business climate \noverall, as well as Moody\u2019s recent upgrade of Pakistan\u2019s credit \nrating outlook from negative to stable\u2014all of which should \nenhance investor confidence.\n\nInflation is projected to accelerate to 11.5% in FY2020, \n\nreflecting a sharp rise in food prices in the first part of the fiscal \n\nFigure 3.20.5\u2002 Government budget \n\nindicators\n\nTax\nNontax\nCurrent\nDevelopment\n\n% of GDP\n\nNet lending\nExternal\nBank\nNonbank\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n300\n\n225\n\n150\n\n75\n\n0\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\nR E D R E D R E D R E D R E D\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\nH1\n2019\n\nH1\n2020\n\nD = De\ufb01cit \ufb01nancing, E = Expenditure, H = half, \nR\u00a0=\u00a0Revenue.\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSource: Ministry of Finance.

A new price series \nthat tracks price movements in rural as well as urban markets \nshowed rural food inflation averaging 16.3% in the first 7 months \nof FY2020, while urban food inflation stood at 14.5%. However, \nhigh food inflation is expected to be mostly transitory, likely to \ndissipate as food supplies improve in the second half of the fiscal \nyear. Further, a drop in international oil prices forecast in the \nsecond half of FY2020 should translate to lower production and \ntransport costs for goods and services, which could be passed on \nto consumers.\n\nAfter raising the policy rate to 13.25% at the beginning \nof FY2020, the central bank reduced it in 2 steps to 11.00% \nin March 2020 following the decline in global oil prices \nand sluggish demand under COVID-19. Growth in private \nsector credit has slowed considerably. Inflation is forecast to \ndecelerate to 8.3% in FY2021 with the central bank expected to \ntake further policy action to both manage inflation and boost \neconomic activity. \n\nThe fiscal deficit is expected to narrow to 8.0% of \nGDP in FY2020 as the government continues to prioritize \nconsolidation. In the first half of FY2020, the deficit fell as \nrevenue collection rebounded from the equivalent of 6.1% of \nGDP a year earlier to 7.3%. A fall in import duties caused by \nimport contraction was compensated by the reinstatement of \nlevies on petroleum products and telecommunication services, \nthe elimination of exemptions for export-oriented industries, \nand higher profit transfers from the central bank and the \nPakistan Telecommunication Authority. On the expenditure side, \nspending increased from 8.7% of GDP in the first half of FY2019 \nto 9.6% on higher interest payments and public development \nprograms to protect public investments and support business \nactivity, particularly activity connected with construction. \nFurther, health care and other social expenditure is expected to \nbe significantly higher as the government addresses COVID-19. \nThe decline in the oil price may adversely affect government \nrevenues due to reduced petroleum tax receipts. \n\nTo finance the fiscal deficit, the government restructured \nits short-term borrowing from the central bank into long-term \nsecurities in a bid to increase the average maturity of domestic \ndebt and reduce its interest rate. Improving the primary budget \nbalance as planned will reduce public debt ratios, moving the \neconomy closer to debt sustainability as GDP growth recovers \nsomewhat in FY2021 and further in subsequent years. \nThe current account deficit is expected to continue \nnarrowing to the equivalent of 2.8% of GDP in FY2020 with \na reduction in the trade deficit resulting from currency \ndepreciation, the imposition of regulatory duties to contain \nimport demand, and continued recovery in workers\u2019 remittances \nfollowing declines in FY2016\u2013FY2018.

Modest growth in the key \nexports textiles, rice, and leather was supported by loans under \na central bank export finance scheme and long-term financing \nfacility for exporters. This was complemented by a notable \nreduction in imports restrained by higher import duties. Weaker \ndemand under COVID-19 could adversely affect exports, but \non balance exports should strengthen thanks to policy stability, \nimprovement in ease of doing business, and lagged effects of \ncurrency depreciation. Thanks primarily to the lower oil price, \nthe current account deficit is projected to narrow further to \nequal 2.4% of GDP in FY2021. \n\nFDI inflow soared by 62.5% year on year in the first half of \n\nFY2020. Short-term capital has also poured in rapidly to buy \ngovernment securities denominated in Pakistan rupees that \noffer attractive returns. Supported by these flows, international \nreserves are expected to improve to 2.2 months of import \ncoverage at the end of FY2020. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014expanding social \nprotection for inclusive growth\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the importance \nof strengthening social protection in Pakistan, especially as \nspending on social development has not kept up with the \ngrowing need. The Human Development Report 2019 ranked \nPakistan at 152 among 189 economies. Health outcomes remain \npoor, featuring one of the highest maternal mortality ratios \nin the region and the third-highest child stunting rate in the \nworld. An estimated 23 million children are out of school. While \nthe portion of the population living below the national poverty \nline declined significantly from 64.0% in 2001 to 24.3% in 2016, \nthe share of rural residents in poverty is consistently more than \ndouble that of urban residents. Gender inequality continues to \nbe pervasive, with women facing poor economic opportunity \nand restricted mostly to informal work. Limited employment \nopportunities and high out-of-pocket health care expenditure \nroutinely lock people in poverty and all too often inflict \neconomic shocks that drag them down into it. \n\nA main factor behind poverty and continued gender \n\ninequality is insufficient investment in human capital, \nespecially for women, which is further exacerbated by rapid \npopulation growth. Over 63% of the population is under the \nage of 30, and gaps in education and technical and vocational \nskills mean that significant efforts are needed to absorb the \nsizable incoming labor force effectively. Against a backdrop of \nslow growth, fiscal consolidation, and monetary tightening, a \ncomprehensive social protection strategy is crucial to promote \ninclusive growth and protect the most vulnerable. \n\n\fIn 2019, the government launched Ehsaas, a comprehensive \n\nTable 3.20.2\u2002Ehsaas Policy\n\nObjective is to reduce inequality, invest in people, \nand lift lagging districts.\n\nPillar I\u2002 Addressing elite capture and \n\nmaking\u00a0the government system \nwork\u00a0for equality\n\n\u2022\u2002 Institutional reform\n\u2022\u2002 Institutional strengthening\n\u2022\u2002 Improved performance\n\u2022\u2002 Increased transparency and accountability\n\nPillar II\u2002Safety nets\n\n\u2022\u2002 National socio-economic registry\n\u2022\u2002 Kifalat\n\u2022\u2002 Tahafuz\n\u2022\u2002 Housing for the poor\n\u2022\u2002 Protection against catastrophic health \n\nexpenditure\n\n\u2022\u2002 Welfare programs for the disabled\n\u2022\u2002 Welfare of the elderly poor\n\u2022\u2002 Labor welfare\n\u2022\u2002 Welfare of workers abroad\n\nPillar III\u2002Human capital development\n\n\u2022\u2002 Malnutrition\n\u2022\u2002 Pro-poor education initiatives\n\u2022\u2002 Health\n\nPillar IV\u2002Jobs and livelihoods\n\n\u2022\u2002 Solutions innovation challenge, prize funding, \n\nand venture capital\n\n\u2022\u2002 IT sector\n\u2022\u2002 TVET sector\n\u2022\u2002 Manpower export\n\u2022\u2002 Poor farmers\n\u2022\u2002 Poor women\n\nIT = information technology, TVET = technical and \nvocational education and training.\nSource: Government of Pakistan.\n\n252(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nprogram for social protection and poverty alleviation that, \namong other things, extends the social safety net program \ncalled the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). Since its \ninception in 2008, BISP has disbursed $3.6 billion through \nunconditional cash transfers to over 5.6 million beneficiary \nfamilies, reaching about 17% of the population. Exclusively \ntargeting poor female beneficiaries, the program provides a \nfinancial cushion to enable increased household consumption, \nimprove nutrition, and promote women\u2019s economic and political \nempowerment. Its conditional cash transfer component, \nWaseela-e-Taleem, provides financial support as well to the \nchildren of BISP beneficiaries who are enrolled and receiving a \nprimary education. \n\nThe government has demonstrated a steady commitment \n\nto social protection, including under the IMF Extended \nFund Facility arrangement, which calls for expanding social \nspending to help protect the most vulnerable. The allocated \nbudget for BISP has risen from PRs102 billion in FY2016 to \nPRs180 billion in FY2020 and has attracted additional support \nfrom international partners. Government pro-poor spending, \nincluding on social protection, was estimated to equal 9.2% of \nGDP in FY2018, but spending on education was only 2.4%, and \nhealth expenditure fell short of 1.0%. While budget allocations \nfor social protection and pro-poor programs are growing, a \ncontinuing concern is the scale of need highlighted above. \nHigher spending on social protection, including the Ehsaas \nprogram, will be crucial in responding to COVID-19 and \nthe serious implications it may have on poor and vulnerable \nsegments of the population. \n\nThe implementation of social protection programs should \n\nfocus on the quality of delivery, factoring in the context of \na large informal labor market, high rates of transient and \nvulnerable poverty, and the need to target beneficiaries \nappropriately. Technological innovations\u2014such as a \ncomprehensive, regularly updated national socioeconomic \nregistry, biometric identification systems to improve targeting, \nand digital payment mechanisms to facilitate transfers\u2014will \nhelp overcome implementation challenges as social protection \nunder Ehsaas is scaled up. Independent evaluation will be key \nto assessing Ehsaas program effectiveness over time and help \npolicy\u00a0makers formulate appropriate and timely action plans \nto improve beneficiary targeting and coordinate federal and \nprovincial efforts. \n\nThe government will need to remain committed to ensuring \n\nthe sustainability of Ehsaas even as it strives to manage the \nconsequences of COVID-19, stabilize Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic \nsituation, and implement the structural reform essential to \nlaying a foundation for inclusive growth.\n\n\fSri Lanka\n\nThe economy faced two major adverse shocks in less than 12 months\u2014terror attacks in April \n2019 and the global spread of COVID-19 from January 2020. Despite earlier signs of revival, \nthe domestic outbreak of COVID-19 in March will markedly curtail economic activity dimming \ngrowth in 2020 while adding to downside risks. However, a broad range of government policy \nactions quickly put in place should sustain households, businesses, and the overall economy. \nGreater  participation  in  global  value  chains  could  lift  and  broaden  manufacturing.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth slowed from 3.2% in 2018 to an estimated 2.6% \nin 2019 (Figure 3.21.1). Following the resolution of a political \nimpasse in the fourth quarter of 2018, growth rebounded in \nthe first quarter of 2019 but slowed in the following quarters \nafter coordinated terror attacks on Easter Sunday disrupted \neconomic activity. Other contributing factors were subdued \ngrowth in agriculture in the second half of the year and \nuncertainty over the outcome of presidential elections in \nNovember. Tourist arrival declined year on year each month \nfrom April to December 2019, adding up to an 18.0% decline \nin the whole year (Figure 3.21.2). Government promotional \ncampaigns and deep discounting sped recovery in arrivals \nfaster than earlier expected. Just as the tourist arrivals were \nreturning to normal, the global spread of COVID-19 has once \nagain buffeted arrivals, driving them down by a cumulative \n12.2% in the first 2 months of 2020.\n\nlargely because of excessive rain in the latter part of the year. \nIndustry expanded by 2.6% in 2019 as construction recovered \nto grow by 3.7% after contracting in 2018, but manufacturing \ngrowth slowed to 1.5% as consumer demand weakened. Services \ngrew at a lower rate of 2.9%, with growth sluggish in wholesale \nand retail trade and transportation, and accommodation and food \nand beverage services contracting by 4.2% as tourist arrivals \nplummeted after the Easter Sunday terror attacks. Financial \nservices showed robust growth at 7.8% in 2019 but slowed from \n11.8% in 2018 as nonperforming loans proliferated, credit growth \nweakened, and taxes and capital requirements rose. \n\nFigure 3.21.1\u2002 GDP growth by sector\n\nAgriculture, forestry, & \ufb01shing\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points \n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n2.6\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nSources: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka.\nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/ (accessed 15 March 2020); \nADB estimates.\n\nTourist arrivals\n\nThousand visitors \n\nGrowth rate\n\n% change year on year\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n300\n\n150\n\n0\n\n-150\n\n-300\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n-80\n\nFeb\n2018\n\nAug\n\nFeb\n2019\n\nAug\n\nFeb\n2020\n\nSource: Sri Lanka Tourist Development Authority. https://\nwww.sltda.gov.lk/index.html (accessed 15 March 2020).\n\nAgriculture saw growth fall from 4.0% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2019 \n\nFigure 3.21.2\u2002 Tourism indicators\n\nThis chapter was written by Eshini Ekanayake and Hasitha Nimali \nWickremasinghe of the Sri Lanka Resident Mission, ADB, Colombo.\n\n\f254(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nOn the demand side, net exports made the largest \ncontribution to GDP growth, reflecting a significant fall in \nimports (Figure 3.21.3). Having contracted in 2017 and 2018, \nconsumption expenditure returned to marginal growth at 2.1% \nas government consumption recovered. Gross fixed capital \ninvestment contracted again by 3.0%, even as construction \nrevived moderately. \n\nInflation as measured by the Colombo consumer price index \n\naveraged 4.3% in 2019 (Figure 3.21.4). While food prices were \nlower than a year earlier for much of 2019, higher administered \nprices for fuel and transport, and pass through from currency \ndepreciation in 2018 pushed nonfood inflation higher to average \nat 5.9%. This eased in the latter half of 2019 as fuel and cooking \ngas prices declined. Though food inflation averaged only 0.8%\u2014\npartly owing to a base effect but also thanks to better supplies \nof key crops\u2014supply shortages in the latter part of the year \ncaused an uptick that carried into 2020. Core inflation rose from \nan average of 3.5% in 2018 to 5.5% but moderated to 4.8% at \nend 2019 as nonfood inflation eased. Inflation measured by the \nnational consumer price index averaged 3.5%, slightly less than \nthe Colombo index.\n\nWith economic activity subdued, growth in private sector \ncredit weak, and inflation moderate amidst high real interest \nrates, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka eased monetary policy in \n2019 (Figure 3.21.5). From the end of 2018 to the end of January \n2020, it cut the statutory reserve ratio by 100 basis points to 5.0% \nand the standing deposit facility rate and standing lending facility \nrate by 150 basis points each to 6.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Bank \nlending rates were unresponsive in the first half of the year, \nprompting the central bank to impose a cap on deposit rates. This \nwas later replaced by a cap on lending rates as the lower cost of \nfunds had not been passed on to borrowers. Most market interest \nrates finally fell in the second half of 2019, and the weighted \naverage prime lending rate was 194 basis points lower at end of \n2019 than a year earlier (Figure 3.21.6). \n\nThe budget deficit for 2019 was 6.5% of GDP, up from 5.3% in \n2018, and the primary balance was 0.7% deficit after surpluses in \n2017 and 2018 (Figure 3.21.7). The revenue ratio fell from 13.4% \nof GDP in 2018 to 12.2% as indirect tax collection in particular \nsuffered from weak excise and VAT tax collection because of \nthe large decline in imports and subdued economic activity \nafter the terror attacks. Direct tax revenue, however, improved \nsignificantly from 2.1% of GDP in 2018 to 2.7% in 2019. In \nNovember, the new government announced tax relief measures, \nlowering the value-added tax rate from 15% to 8%, abolishing the \neconomic service charge of 0.5% and the nation-building tax of \n2%, and retracting some direct taxes introduced by the Inland \nRevenue Act. These declines were partially offset by increases in \na number of excise taxes and levies on imports. The expenditure \nratio increased marginally from 18.6% of GDP in 2018 to 18.7% \n\nFigure 3.21.3\u2002 GDP growth by demand \ncomponents\n\nConsumption\nFixed investments\nChange in stocks\nNet exports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nSources: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka.\nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/ (accessed 15 March 2020); \nADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.21.4\u2002 Inflation\n\nFood\nNonfood\nHeadline\nCore\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nFeb\n2020\n\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka.\nhttp://www.statistics.gov.lk/ (accessed 15 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.21.5\u2002Policy rates\n\nStanding deposit facility rate (repo)\nStanding lending facility rate (reverse repo)\nAverage weighted call rate\nStatutory reserve ratio\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n%\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan \n2019\n\nJul\n\nMar\n2021\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/\nen (accessed 20 March 2020).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002255\n\ndue to higher recurrent expenditure for salaries and pensions, \nwhile public investment fell further to 4.1% of GDP in 2019 from \n4.3% the previous year. In sum, the central government debt to \nGDP ratio increased from 82.9% at the end of 2018 to 83.7% a \nyear later (Figure 3.21.8).\n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from 3.2% of GDP in \n\n2018 to 2.1% as imports contracted by 10.3%, slicing the trade \ndeficit by 22.7% (Figure 3.21.9). The drop in imports reflected \nweak domestic demand, substantial currency depreciation in \n2018, and measures introduced in 2018 to curtail nonessential \nimports, though they were withdrawn in March 2019 (Figure \n3.21.10). Weak imports helped offset an 18% decline in tourism \nreceipts after the terror attacks. Worker remittances fell by \n4.2% in 2019 reflecting a structural decline as the composition \nof migrants changed in recent years. Exports grew by only \n0.4% as a strong 5.2% increase in garments exports more than \ncompensated for declines in petroleum products and agricultural \nexports, the latter accounting for a fifth of the total. \n\nThe average exchange rate for the Sri Lanka rupee \ndepreciated against the US dollar by 10%, from SLRs162.5 in \n2018 to SLRs178.8 in 2019, but by year-end rates it appreciated by \na marginal 0.6%, from SLRs182.8 to SLRs181.6 (Figure 3.21.11). \nSubdued imports and the proceeds from $4.4 billion in sovereign \nbond issues in March and June lifted reserves to $7.5 billion by \nthe end of 2019 despite sizeable debt repayment (Figure 3.21.12).\n\nEconomic prospects\nSri Lanka\u2019s prospects for recovery from 2 years of declining \ngrowth held promise at the open of 2020. Indeed, a key \nforward-looking indicator, the services purchasing managers\u2019 \nindex reached a 24-month high of 60.2 in December 2019 \n(Figure 3.21.13). However, it fell sharply to 50.2 in February \n2020 as the impact of COVID-19 to lower global growth \nand disrupt supply chains, tourism and transport became \nincreasingly evident. With the March outbreak of COVID-19 in \nSri Lanka, the ADO 2020 growth projection of 2.2% has taken \non significant downside risks\u2014emanating from the severity \nand the duration of domestic infection as well as an apparently \nintensifying economic impact of the pandemic\u2014which could \nlower growth by another 1.0-1.5 percentage points. GDP \ngrowth is expected to recover to 3.5% in 2021. If the pandemic \nis contained by mid-2020, recovery could begin toward the \nlatter part of 2020 and into 2021, driven by release of pent-up \ndemand.\n\nThe disruption caused by COVID-19 and the necessary \ncontainment measures to limit the spread of the disease will \nstunt economic activity and lower consumer and business \nconfidence, limiting household income and consumption and \nprivate sector business sales and investment through most of \n\nFigure 3.21.6\u2002 Commercial bank rates, and \nprivate sector credit growth\n\nAverage weighted \nprime lending rate\nAverage weighted \nlending rate\nAverage weighted \ndeposit rate\n\nPrivate sector\ncredit growth\n\n% change year on year \n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\nFeb\n2018\n\nAug\n\nFeb\n2019\n\nAug\n\nFeb\n2020\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/\nen (accessed 15 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.21.7\u2002 Central government finance\n\nRevenue including grants\nGovernment expenditure\nOverall balance\nPrimary balance\n\n% \n\n18\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n% GDP\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nNote: Figures exclude revenue and expendtiure transfers \nto provincial councils.\nSources: Central Bank Annual report various years; \nMinistry of Finance, Economy and Policy Development \nestimate.\n\nFigure 3.21.8\u2002 Government debt\n\n77.7\n\n78.3\n\n76.9\n\n82.9\n\n83.7\n\nDomestic\nForeign\nTotal\n\n% GDP \n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nSources: Central Bank Annual report various years; \nMinistry of Finance, Economy and Policy Development \nestimate. \n\n\f256(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\n2020. Moreover, receipt of remittances will moderate due to the \nglobal economic slowdown and lower oil prices, since about half \nof all remittances originate from the Middle East. \n\nAfter a sustained period of stressed cash flow for firms, \nprivate investment will likely be weaker than expected. Public \ninvestment is also uncertain since a full budget for 2020 will be \npassed only after the parliamentary elections, and with limited \nfiscal space, pressure to meet higher health-care expenditure \nand income support measures are likely to constrain investment \nspending. \n\nThe government, however, has quickly taken actions to \n\ncontain the spread of COVID-19 and provide economic support to \nindividuals and business adversely affected by the containment \nmeasures. On March 16, at an emergency meeting, the Central \nBank of Sri Lanka cut the statutory reserve ratio by 100 basis \npoints and cut both the standing lending facility rate and the \nstanding deposit facility rate by 25 basis points, adding to the 50 \nbasis points reduction in policy rates made in January. Financial \nsupport measures include granting a 6-month moratorium on \ndebt servicing for firms in the tourist and apparel industries and \nfor all small and medium enterprises, calling for new working \ncapital loans at 4% interest, postponing repayment on small \npersonal loans for 3 months, providing a SLRs10,000 interest-\nfree loans and weekly food assistance for Samurdhi \u2014 a poverty \nalleviation program \u2014 beneficiaries, extending the deadline for \ntax payments and utility bills, and other interventions to support \nspecific groups that are at financial risk. \n\nInflation is expected to trend higher to average 5.0% in 2020 \n\nand fall marginally lower to 4.8% in 2021. Higher food prices \nowing to a low base, tighter supply conditions, and supply-chain \ndisruptions will drive inflation. The pass-through of lower \nindirect taxes announced in November 2019, weak demand, and \nmuch lower global fuel prices will provide some offset to price \npressures in 2020. \n\nAlthough Sri Lanka has good public health infrastructure, \ngreater support required for public health services and financial \nsupport for households and business add significant new \nspending pressures for 2020. The budget deficit will be higher \nthan the 7.9% of GDP estimated by IMF in February 2020 before \nthe spread of COVID-19 into Sri Lanka. That estimate reflected \nthe fall in tax revenue from tax cuts, increase in some excise \nrates and levies, and increases in expenditure to cover arrears \naccrued in 2019. With higher required spending and tighter \nglobal liquidity conditions more deficit financing from the \ndomestic market is expected.\n\nLarger fiscal deficits will push the central government \ndomestic and external debt ratios even higher. Sri Lanka\u2019s \nexternal debt repayment obligations are already substantial, \nestimated at $17.0 billion from 2020 to 2023, with the next \neurobond maturity of $1 billion scheduled for September 2020. \n\nFigure 3.21.9\u2002 Current account components\n\nCurrent transfers\nIncome balance\nServices balance\nImports\nExports\nCurrent account balance\n\n% GDP\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n$ million\n\n1,500\n\n750\n\n0\n\n-750\n\n-1,500\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\nEstimate\n\nSources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. https://www.cbsl.gov.\nlk/en (accessed 20 March 2020); ADB estimate.\n\nFigure 3.21.10\u2002 Trade indicators\n\nTrade balance\n\nImports\n\nExports\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/\nen (accessed 20 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.21.11\u2002 Exchange rates\n\nNominal effective\nReal effective\n\nMonthly average\n\nIndex, 2010 = 100\n\nSLRs/$\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n-15\n\n-30\n\n125\n\n150\n\n175\n\n200\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/\nen (accessed 20 March 2020).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002257\n\nMoreover, the country\u2019s refinancing risk and borrowing cost \nare likely increased due to downgrading of Sri Lanka\u2019s outlook \nto negative by two rating agencies and investor retreat to safe \nhavens in times of crisis.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to widen to 2.8% \n\nof GDP in 2020 and then fall to 2.6% in 2021 on forecasted \nimprovement in exports, tourist earnings, and remittances. \nExport revenues will weaken in 2020 on reduced sales, especially \nto Europe and the US, key markets for garments and rubber \nproducts, as well as to Iran that buys about 10% of tea exports. \nService exports, including tourist and information technology \nrelated earnings, will also weaken in 2020, as will remittances on \na reduction in migrant worker departures. However, the negative \nimpact of these developments will be partially offset by lower \nimports reflecting the reduction in global oil prices and energy \ndemand, subdued domestic demand, and restrictions imposed for \n3 months in March by the Central Bank on imports of vehicles \nand non-essential consumer items. \n\nProspects for a more substantial pick-up in growth have been \ndiminished by the global spread of COVID-19 and its outbreak in \nSri Lanka which underlines preexisting downside risks for the \neconomy.

Fragmented, cross-border production remain \nsignificant, and participation in GVCs encourages technology \ntransfer, creates better jobs, and provides access to wider \nmarkets. \n\nAs standard trade statistics do not adequately track how \nmuch value each economy in a GVC adds to a product, new \nmethodologies have been developed to measure contributions. \nThese new frameworks are used to divide gross exports into \nforeign and domestic value added and \u201cpure double-counted\u201d \nterms\u2014refers to value added of a good that cross a national \nborder between two countries more than once in the GVC \nproduction process.

These measures offer a more \nrealistic view of an economy participating in GVCs. \n\nSri Lanka\u2019s backward linkages are higher than its forward \n\nlinkages, indicating that its industries tend to rely more on \nforeign intermediates than they supply to foreign producers. \nIts forward and backward GVC participation level trails that \nof Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam but is on par with South \nAsian neighbors such as Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (Figure \n3.21.14). \n\nUpstreamness, or the distance of a product from the final \n\ngood is indicated with ascending numbers, 1 denoting zero \ndistance from the final good. In 2018, Sri Lanka\u2019s upstreamness \nindexes were from 1.5 to 1.9 for its largest exporting industries, \nagriculture and clothing, which indicate that most of the \nproducts in these categories were close to final production \n(Figure 3.21.15). \n\nAnother GVC indicator commonly used is vertical \n\nspecialization, which measures a country\u2019s total foreign value \nadded (imported inputs in its exports) and the pure double-\ncounted terms. This data show that Sri Lanka\u2019s participation in \nGVCs was limited in 2017, with vertical specialization less than \n20% of its exports in all major export categories, well below \nthe rate in Malaysia, at 44% in some industries, and in Viet \nNam, at 58%. \n\nResearch by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development, identifies factors that determine a country\u2019s \nparticipation in GVCs as trade policy, which includes tariff \nstructures and trade facilitation measures, and nonpolicy \nfactors such as country size, proximity to GVC hubs, and \nincome. Sri Lanka is ranked 96 of 190 countries in trading \nacross borders in the Doing Business Index 2020, indicating \nthat it needs to improve logistical support and the efficiency \nof border agencies to facilitate greater GVC participation. \nWhile Sri Lanka is distant from the GVC hubs of Europe and \nNorth America, it can exploit proximity to GVC hubs in Asia \nby strengthening links and participating in regional trade \nagreements, which would improve its access to this market. \nRecent positive measures by Sri Lanka include building \na web-based portal to streamline and fast-track investment \napprovals and setting up a one-stop trade information portal. \nA \u201ccustoms single window\u201d based on the Automated System \nfor Customs Data World enables the electronic submission \nand processing of customs declarations and cargo manifests. \nSri Lanka\u2019s participation in the Trade Facilitation Agreement \nof the World Trade Organization provides opportunities for \nguidance in systematically improving its trade facilitation.  \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: South Asia \n\nSri Lanka\u2002\u2002259\n\nFigure 3.21.15\u2002Upstreamness by sector\n\nPulp, paper, paper products, printing, and publishing\n\n3.4\n\nWholesale trade and commission trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles\n\nMean (2018): 1.7\n\nMedian  (2018): 1.8\n\n2.7\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\nElectrical and optical equipment\n\nElectricity, gas, and water supply\n\nChemicals and chemical products\n\nCoke, re\ufb01ned petroleum, and nuclear fuel\n\nFinancial intermediation\n\nRenting of M&Eq and other business activities\n\nPost and telecommunications\n\nBasic metals and fabricated metal\n\nRubber and plastics\n\nOther nonmetallic minerals\n\nAir transport\n\nTextiles and textile products\n\nWood and products of wood and cork\n\nInland transport\n\nMining and quarrying\n\nWater transport\n\nFood, beverages, and tobacco\n\nMachinery, nec\n\nLeather, leather products, and footwear\n\nOther community, social, and personal services\n\nManufacturing, nec; recycling\n\nReal estate activities\n\nSale, maintenance, and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; retail sale of fuel\n\nOther supporting and auxiliary transport activities; activities of travel agencies\n\nAgriculture, hunting, forestry, and \ufb01shing\n\nRetail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles; repair of household goods\n\nPublic administration and defense; compulsory social security\n\nHotels and restaurants\n\nHealth and social work\n\nTransport equipment\n\nConstruction\n\nEducation\n\nSource: ADB estimates using  data from Multi-regional Input\u2013Output Table (MRIOT) Database.\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\nUpstreamness\n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.9\n\n1.9\n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n\n1.7\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n1.3\n\n1.3\n\n1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n\f\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nCambodia\n\nIndonesia\n\nMalaysia\n\nMyanmar\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nViet Nam\n\nSOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n\f\fBrunei Darussalam\n\nContinued  recovery  is  forecast  on  increased  activity  in  oil  and  gas  and  in  other  areas  and \nas  completed  projects  come  online  and  other  large  investment  projects  begin.  Exports  of \ngoods and services picked up in 2019, and growth in private consumption surged. Despite \nhigher  imports,  the  current  account  is  expected  to  stay  well  in  the  black.  With  growth \nrecovering,  the  government  should  turn  its  attention  to  tackling  youth  unemployment, \nwhich  has  worsened  in  recent  years.\n\nEconomic performance\nThe economy posted 3.9% GDP growth in 2019 on a strong \nperformance by industry as it reversed contraction in 2018 \n(Figure\u00a03.22.1). The oil and gas industry, having contracted \nby 1.1% in 2018, expanded by 4.7% in 2019. Hydrocarbon \nproduction appeared to continue its recovery in the fourth \nquarter of 2019 and, together with new downstream production \nof petroleum and chemical products, further boosted economic \nactivity. In the whole of 2019, oil production rose by 8.8% and \nnatural gas production by 2.2% (Figure 3.22.2). By contrast, \nconstruction slowed following the completion of some big \ninfrastructure projects. The service sector improved upon 0.8% \ngrowth in 2018, with substantial contributions from finance, \nwholesale and retail trade, and health services. \n\nOn the demand side, growth in private consumption surged \n\nfrom 2.2% in 2018 to a 6-year high of 5.9% in 2019 thanks \nto improved labor market conditions and lower inflation. \nFor example, domestic sales of automobiles, a key consumer \ndurable in Brunei Darussalam, rose by 6%. Similarly, increased \nglobal demand for oil and gas and reduced import growth with \nthe slowdown in infrastructure spending lifted net external \ndemand (Figure 3.22.3). However, after double-digit growth in \n2018, fixed investment contracted by 4.4% owing to reductions \nin both construction and investment by the oil industry. \nGrowth in public consumption remain muted, meanwhile, \nconstrained by government efforts to consolidate its finances.\nEven as growth picked up, inflation returned to habitual \nnegative territory as the consumer price index fell by 0.4% in \n2019. The decrease was largely attributed to lower prices for \ntransport, housing, utilities, and food. The current account \nsurplus is estimated to have widened from the equivalent \nof 7.9% of GDP in 2018 to 9.0% in 2019 with a rebound in \n\nThis chapter was written by Pilipinas Quising of the Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila, and Thiam Hee Ng of the \nSoutheast Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\nFigure 3.22.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions \nto\u00a0growth\n\nAgriculture\nNon-oil and gas industry\nOil and gas industry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n3.9\n\n1.3\n\n0.1\n\n-0.4\n\n-2.5\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 17 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.22.2\u2002 Average daily oil and \n\ngas\u00a0production\n\nNatural gas\n\nCrude oil\n\nMillion ton of oil equivalent\n\nThousand barrels\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n37\n\n34\n\n31\n\n28\n\n25\n\n150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Brunei Darussalam Ministry of Energy.\n\n\f264(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nexports following the completion of a program to repair and \nrestore aging oil and gas facilities and the start of downstream \nproduction. Consequently, international reserves increased \nslightly to $4.3 billion, providing cover for 10 months of imports.\n\nIncome from hydrocarbons through taxes, dividends, \nand royalties provided the government with revenue to fund \nrelatively large public sector projects as well as invest in \ninfrastructure. Provisional estimates to the third quarter of \nfiscal year 2019 (FY2019, ending 31 March 2020) show revenue \nreaching B$3.31\u00a0billion, more than three-fourths of the targeted \nB$4.36\u00a0billion. Conversely, expenditure may end up below \nbudget as the government continues to rein in spending.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is expected to sustain its recent recovery. On the \ndemand side, the recent uptick in private consumption should \ncontinue in the near term. With the completion of large refinery \nprojects in 2019, investment may take a breather, but exports \nof oil and petroleum products should increase. In November \n2019, the country started exporting petroleum and gas products, \nmainly automotive diesel, their value rising $205 million that \nmonth to $357 million in December (Figure 3.22.4).\n\nThe Hengyi refinery was expected to run full capacity \n\nstarting in the second half of 2020, and Brunei Fertilizer \nIndustries\u2019 ammonia and urea production plant was scheduled \nto start operation in the second quarter of 2021, though volatile \noil prices and the spread of COVID-19 have slightly dimmed the \noutlook. GDP is still forecast to continue to grow above trend, \nalbeit at a slower pace of 2.0% this year before picking up to \n3.0% next year (Figure\u00a03.22.5). \n\nGradual diversification of the production base away \nfrom oil and gas is starting to show additional green shoots. \nSeveral aquaculture projects are in the works, notably Golden \nCorporation Sdn Bhd in the marine shrimp culture, capture \nfisheries, and seafood processing, and Hiseaton Fisheries Sdn \nBhd and Barramundi Asia (B) Sdn Bhd, producing pompano and \nbarramundi fish, respectively. The opening to the public of the \n30-kilometer Temburong Bridge this year, linking the capital \nBandar Seri Begawan with the lush rainforests of Temburong, \nis expected to boost tourism in Temburong District once the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has passed. Complementing the bridge is \nthe construction of Temburong\u2019s first luxury eco-resort, which \nis slated for completion by the end of 2020. \n\nIn finance, the monetary authority has established \nregulatory requirements for the operation of a peer-to-peer \nfinancing platform to facilitate the growth and development \nof capital markets. It also established a national credit scoring \nsystem known as the Bureau Credit Score to help banks and \nfinance companies objectively assess the creditworthiness of \npotential clients.\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n-16\n\n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\nTotal\nCrude oil\nLNG\n\n$ million\n\n1,200\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.22.3\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nInvestment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 17 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.22.4\u2002 Exports of mineral fuels\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2017\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nOct\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 20 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.22.5\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: CEIC Data Company (accessed 17 March 2020); \nADB estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nBrunei Darussalam\u2002\u2002265\n\nInflationary pressure is expected to remain muted in the \n\nTable 3.22.1\u2002 Selected economic indicators \n\nnext 2 years, with little imported inflation because of low \nglobal commodity prices, and with government subsidies for \nmany products.

What is more, the unemployment rate \namong youths aged 15\u201324 increased from 28.8% in 2017 to 29.9% \nin 2018.

To develop better vocational \ntraining and education, reskilling, and the professionalization of \nmanual jobs, it established several initiatives such as the i-Ready \nApprenticeship Program and strengthened collaboration and \nengagement with industry through the Manpower Industry \nSteering Committee. These efforts are intended to ensure \nalignment between industry needs, in terms of numbers and \nqualifications, and manpower supply, and to address the current \nmismatch between general education and TVET training \nand the requirements of industry.

The  current  account  deficit  widened \nsignificantly. Growth is expected to slow sharply in 2020 as export growth eases following \npartial  suspension  by  the  European  Union  of  trade  preferences  for  Cambodia  and  as  the \nexternal environment worsens under COVID-19. Issuing government bonds in local currency \nwould  promote  the  development  of  local  capital  markets  and  domestic  investment. \n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth slowed slightly in 2019 as the economy expanded by an \nestimated 7.1% (Figure 3.23.1). Robust construction and rising \nexports of garments, footwear, and travel goods were the main \ncontributors to growth. Agriculture contracted by an estimated \n0.5% as low rainfall affected fisheries and crops. Industry \nincluding construction expanded by an estimated 11.3% and \ncontributed 4.0 percentage points to real GDP growth. The \nservice sector contribution of 2.4 percentage points to growth \nin 2019 was lower than in previous years. Strong growth in \nvisitor arrivals from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \npushed all arrivals up by 10.0% in the first 3 quarters, but \narrivals declined in the fourth quarter, following Cambodia\u2019s \ndecision to ban online gambling. In the end, growth in visitor \narrivals decelerated substantially from 10.7% in 2018 to 6.6% in \n2019 (Figure 3.23.2). \n\nInflation was subdued in most of 2019 but rose to 3.1% year \n\non year at the end of December on price increases for food. \nAcross the full year, low increases for food and continued \neasing of fuel prices saw average annual inflation decline from \n2.5% in 2018 to 1.9% in 2019. \n\nThe general government budget, which combines central \nand local government budgets, projected a deficit equal to 2.3% \nof GDP in 2019, but high revenue and low expenditure instead \ncreated a surplus at 5.3% of GDP (Figure 3.23.3). Strong tax \ncollection boosted government revenue to an estimated 25.1% \nof GDP, with expenditure initially estimated at 19.8% of GDP. \nThe estimated outcome for 2019 will be revised as new data \nbecome available.  \n\nCambodia remains a highly dollarized economy, with the \nriel accounting for only about 20% of currency in circulation. \nThe National Bank of Cambodia, the central bank, has taken \n\nThis chapter was written by Poullang Doung of the Cambodia Resident \nMission, ADB, Phnom Penh.\n\nFigure 3.23.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions to \n\ngrowth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nTaxes on products less subsidies & FISIM\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points \n\n7.0\n\n6.9\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n7.1\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nFISIM =  Financial intermediation services indirectly \nmeasured.\nSources: National Institute of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.23.2\u2002 Tourist arrivals\n\nAsia\nEurope\nAmericas\nAfrica\nMiddle East\n\nMillion arrivals\n\n% change year on year \n\nGrowth\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: Ministry of Tourism; ADB estimates. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia\u2002\u2002267\n\nmeasures to promote the use of the riel, notably requiring \nbanks to denominate at least 10% of their loan portfolios in the \nlocal currency. The central bank has sought partners to help \npromote the use of the riel for transactions. Growth in the \nmoney supply (M2) slowed from 24.0% in 2018 to 18.0% last \nyear, largely maintained by foreign currency deposits, which \naccounted for 83% of the liquidity. Growth in credit to the \nprivate sector accelerated from 23.2% in 2018 to 26.3%. This \nrapid growth in lending raised private sector credit outstanding \nfrom the equivalent of 82.8% of GDP in 2018 to 94.7%. \n\nCambodia\u2019s current account deficit widened from 12.2% of \nGDP in 2018 to an estimated 17.6% as import growth outpaced \nexports (Figure 3.23.4). The dollar value of merchandise \nexports is estimated to have grown by 13.5% as merchandise \nimports rose by an estimated 19.5% on significant increases in \nimports of construction materials, fuel, and vehicles. Buoyant \nforeign direct investment inflow\u2014recorded at $3.7 billion, a \n15.4% increase from the previous year\u2014continued to finance \nthe current account deficit. This permitted international \nreserves to accumulate to $18.8 billion in 2019, or cover for 8.8 \nmonths of imports. \n\nEconomic prospects\nGrowth is expected to slow dramatically to 2.3% in 2020 as \na direct result of the COVID-19 outbreak, low growth in the \nPRC and minor contraction in major advanced economies, \nand reduced access to export markets, before rebounding \nto 5.7% in 2021 (Figure 3.23.5). COVID-19 will hit services \nhard by reducing foreign visitor arrivals and is expected to \naffect construction and manufacturing through supply chain \ndisruption and reduced demand. The service sector is projected \nto contract by 1.7% in 2020 as tourism falls and growth in real \nestate slows. Industry growth is forecast to slow to 6.5% in \n2020 with deceleration in garment production for export and \nin construction in line with arrested growth in major advanced \neconomies and a sharp slowdown in the PRC, and in particular \nwith the curtailment of European Union trade preferences \nstarting in August 2020. Agriculture growth is expected to be \nlow at 0.5% or so in 2020, reflecting a forecast for extended hot \nweather this year and the authorities\u2019 instruction to cultivate \nonly one rice crop during the dry season. \n\nInflation is expected to remain low, averaging 2.1% in \n2020 in line with foreseen decelerating growth and lower \ninternational fuel prices. Inflation is projected to remain \nsubdued in 2021 as international fuel prices likely stay low \n(Figure 3.23.6). \n\nThe general government budget for 2020 has a deficit equal \n\nto 2.8% of GDP.

Expenditure is budgeted to rise from \n22.4% of GDP in 2019 to 26.3%. This reflects government \nplans for significant stimulus to offset the short-term impacts \nof COVID-19 and lost trade preferences. Public external debt \nrelative to GDP is anticipated to hover at about 29% in 2020, \nkeeping Cambodia at low risk of sovereign debt distress. \n\nAs the economy faces the COVID-19 threat, the central \nbank is taking several measures to increase liquidity in the \nlocal market and support businesses as they struggle under the \neffects of COVID-19. It is also promoting local currency use \nwith incentives for riel-denominated loans. The central bank \nplans to continue to support the development of equity and \nbond markets, including a forthcoming initial public offering \nfor one of Cambodia\u2019s largest banks. Over time, developing \nfinancial markets and increased use of the local currency will \ngive the central bank more channels through which to transmit \nmonetary policy.\n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to equal 19.0% of GDP \nin 2020, narrowing to 16.9% in 2021. The wider current account \ndeficit in 2020 will reflect slower growth in exports and \ndisrupted tourism. Gross international reserves are expected \nto increase to more than $20.6 billion in 2020, providing cover \nfor 9 months of imports. Reserves could come under pressure, \nthough, if the COVID-19 outbreak causes foreign direct \ninvestment to fall sharply. \n\nGrowth prospects are subject to significant downside risks, \n\nincluding export demand falling faster than expected under \ncurtailed trade preferences, disruption linked to COVID-19, \nand advanced economies falling into recession. Increased \nbank lending connected to real estate continues to pose risks \nto financial and macroeconomic stability, particularly under a \nslowdown linked to COVID-19. The outbreak and temporary \nborder closures in Southeast Asia could apply additional \npressure on consumer prices.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014developing a local bond \nmarket\nCambodia has achieved high economic growth over the \npast 2 decades to become one of the fastest-growing \neconomies in the subregion. The authorities are committed to \ndeveloping financial services to support growth and ensure \nmacroeconomic stability. \n\nLocal issues of government bonds could help diversify the \n\nnonbank financial sector and deepen local capital markets. \nGovernment bond issues would help to establish a risk-free \nbenchmark for pricing locally issued corporate bonds. \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.23.5\u2002 GDP growth\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nFigure 3.23.6\u2002 Inflation\n\n5\u2212year moving average\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nCambodia\u2002\u2002269\n\nThe development of a corporate bond market would help to \nreduce companies\u2019 reliance on bank credit while offering new \nchannels for long-term financial intermediation. This would \nsupport private sector development, diversify the nonbank \nfinancial sector, and channel domestic savings to investment, \nthus reducing reliance on foreign capital flows. Also important \nwould be to cultivate long-term institutional investors in \ngovernment bonds in addition to banks, such as insurance \ncompanies and pension funds, to deepen the market.\n\nEfforts to develop a local currency bond market face a \nparticular challenge in Cambodia, however, from its pervasive \ndollarization. The promotion of local currency bonds would be \nconsistent with the broader goal of expanding the use of the riel. \nGovernment authorities are working on a draft amendment \n\nto the Law on Government Securities that would provide \na clear legal framework and pave the way for issuing \ngovernment bonds. The development of an overarching legal \nframework could be complemented by the development of a \nroadmap for bond market development over the medium term. \nThis roadmap could be guided by analysis of the experiences \nof peer countries in the subregion. Based on these experiences, \nthe roadmap would include steps such as establishing a \ncoordination body and trade and settlement systems to \nfacilitate the development of primary and secondary markets. \n\n\fIndonesia\n\nGrowth  slowed  last  year  as  stronger  domestic  consumption  could  only  partly  offset  a \nworsening external environment and weakening domestic investment. Inflation fell, and the \ncurrent  account  deficit  narrowed.  Disruptions  from  COVID-19  and  recent  developments \nin  commodity  and  financial  markets  will  have  severe  implications  for  both  the  world  and \nIndonesia  in  2020.  Over  the  medium  and  long  term,  Indonesia  needs  to  improve  its \nproductivity  and  resilience,  not  least  through  greater  technology  adoption. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth slowed from 5.2% in 2018 to 5.0% in 2019 (Figure \n3.24.1). Stronger domestic consumption partly offset a worsening \nexternal environment and weakening domestic investment.\nOn the demand side, domestic consumption remained \nstrong, supported by robust household spending and election-\nrelated expenditure (Figure 3.24.2). Household consumption \nwas bolstered by spending on health-care and education \nservices as visits to heath facilities increased and the use of \nEdTech services grew rapidly. The labor market remained \nrobust, adding 2.5 million jobs in the 12 months to August 2019, \nthough unemployment stayed at 5.3%. With revenue receipts \nundershooting targets, the government reined in consumption, \nparticularly in the second half of the year. \n\nGrowth in fixed investment slid from 6.6% in 2018 to 4.4% \n(Figure 3.24.3). Investment in buildings and plantation agriculture \nremained strong, while investment in equipment and vehicles \ndeclined sharply. Plantation agriculture investment is set to \ncontinue, to meet the target of producing 50 million tons of palm \noil by 2024, which would entail investing $2.3 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n\nExports contracted by 0.9% in 2019, a broad decline partly \nbuffered by sustained demand for coal and palm oil. With natural \nresources accounting for a large share of Indonesia\u2019s exports, \ngrowth in mining and quarrying also performed poorly. Imports \nshrank by 7.7%, partly as several import-dependent high-tech \nmanufacturing areas slowed production.\n\nOn the supply side, growth in agriculture and industry both \nslowed (Figure 3.24.4). Growth in agriculture fell from 3.9% in \n2018 to 3.6% in 2019 as a mild drought damaged food crops. The \ndownturn in food crops was partly offset by stronger growth \nin plantations, livestock, and fisheries.

It was stoked by strengthening domestic \nconsumption and election spending by political parties. Modern \nservices such as information and communications did especially \nwell from surges in mobile phone ownership and internet usage \n(Figure 3.24.5). \n\nWith administered prices unchanged and core inflation \nstable, headline inflation continued to moderate. It averaged \n2.8% in 2019, at the lower end of the 2.5%\u20134.5% target set by \nBank Indonesia, the central bank (Figure 3.24.6). Prices for \ntransport and communications were contained, as were those \nfor housing. However, El Ni\u00f1o weather disturbances caused food \nprices to fluctuate. Exchange rate stability has been supported \nby regular central bank auctions of derivatives called domestic \nnon-deliverable forwards since late 2018. In 2019, the Indonesian \nrupiah appreciated against the US dollar by 0.6% on average, or by \n4.2% at year-end, recovering some ground lost in 2018.\n\nThe current account deficit narrowed from $30.6 billion \nin 2018, equal to 2.9% of GDP, to $30.4 billion in 2019, or 2.7% \n(Figure 3.24.7). Trade deficits persisted in services and primary \nincome, but a small surplus of $3.5 billion was recorded in goods \nas imports contracted faster than exports. Oil imports fell partly \nbecause of import controls that include a requirement that diesel \nengines burn blends with at least 20% locally produced biofuel. \nSubdued domestic investment clipped imports of capital goods. \nThe balance of payments turned a $7.1 billion deficit in 2018 \n\ninto a $4.7 billion surplus in 2019 (Figure 3.24.8). Net inflow \nof portfolio investment rose from $9.3 billion in 2018 to $21.5 \nbillion as global financial market conditions improved following \ninterest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Inflow of foreign \ndirect investment also increased, to $24.4 billion, channeled into \nutilities, transport, telecommunications, and e-commerce. In 2019, \nthe Jakarta Composite Index gradually recovered by 1.7% in line \nwith other markets in Southeast Asia. These financial inflows \nmore than offset a deficit in the current account. Foreign reserves \nstood at $129.2 billion at the end of 2019, sufficient to cover 7.3 \nmonths of imports and government external debt servicing. \nWith inflation benign and the balance of payments in \nsurplus, the central bank supported growth with four rate cuts \ntotaling 100 basis points from July to October 2019 (Figure \n3.24.9), reducing the policy rate to 5.0%. However, credit growth \nremained muted, even decelerating to 6.1% year on year in \nDecember 2019 as loans to the public sector, including state-\nowned enterprises, tailed off. \n\nThe 2019 budget set a fiscal deficit equal to 1.8% of GDP, but \nyear-end estimates indicate that it reached 2.2% of GDP as growth \n\nFigure 3.24.3\u2002 Contributions to fixed \n\ninvestment growth\n\nBuildings and structures\nMachine and equipment\nVehicles\nOther equipments\nCultivated biological resources\nIntellectual property products\nGross \ufb01xed capital formation\n\nPercentage points\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n4.4\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 13 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.24.4\u2002 Supply-side contributions to \n\ngrowth\n\nAgriculture\nManufacturing\nOther industry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points \n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 13 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.24.5\u2002 Internet and mobile phone \n\nusage\n\nPercentage of population 5 years old and above\nwho accessed the internet for the past  3 months\nPercentage of population 5 years old and above\nwho used mobile phones for the past 3 months\n\n56.9\n\n58.3\n\n59.6\n\n62.4\n\n63.5\n\n47.7\n\n39.9\n\n32.3\n\n22.0\n\n25.4\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 13 March 2020).\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n%\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\f272(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nand revenue both fell short of expectations, with revenue reaching \nonly 90.4% of the budget target.

As events unfold, Indonesia\u2019s key trade partners already \nexpect severe impacts on their economies. Domestic demand is \nlikely to weaken as business and consumer sentiment falls. GDP \ngrowth is accordingly forecast at 2.5% this year. As the global \neconomy recovers in 2021 and investment reform gains traction, \ngrowth is forecast at 5.0%.\n\nEarnings from exports of goods and services are expected to \ncontract for a second year in 2020. As the COVID-19 outbreak halts \nproduction in economies that import Indonesian commodities, \nearnings from petroleum, palm oil, and coal are likely to suffer this \nyear. Travel bans and flight cancellations will hit tourism receipts. \nTo counter flagging export growth, the government is accelerating \nlicensing and customs processing by removing regulations that \nimpose unnecessary burdens on businesses. The central bank has \nlowered rupiah reserve requirements by 50 basis points for banks \nfinancing trade. As the outbreak wanes and the global economy \nrecovers, export growth should recover in 2021.\n\nAs with exports, fixed investment is expected to remain \n\nsubdued in the near term. Leading indicators such as credit growth \nand imports of machinery and equipment continued to moderate \nin early 2020 (Figure 3.24.10). As the People\u2019s Republic of China is \nthe dominant supplier of capital goods for investment in Indonesia, \ninfrastructure projects that require imports may be put on hold \nuntil the second half of 2020, and new project approvals may \nalso be delayed. These losses may be partly offset by temporary \nmeasures to help businesses cope with impacts from the outbreak, \nincluding reductions to corporate income tax and deferred import \ntax payments for manufacturing. Fresh reform should gain traction \nin 2021 with the introduction in early 2020 of two omnibus bills \nin parliament on job creation and taxation.

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak \non consumer sentiment and spending is likely to be especially \nstrong in urban areas. Unless the government successfully contains \nthe outbreak, household spending on health care could jump, \nproductivity fall, and discretionary spending shrink. As these \nimpacts spread, jobs and worker incomes will be affected. One in \nfour jobs is in wholesale or retail trade or in accommodation and \nfood services, many of them informal. Occupations in these areas, as \nwell as in construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and transport, \nare less amenable to working from home and thus highly exposed to \nbusiness downturns. \n\nTo counter job and income losses, the government is stepping \nup efforts to ensure the timely disbursement of social transfers and \nexempting manufacturing workers with incomes below $14,000 \nper year from income tax for 6 months. Workers\u2019 incomes are also \nsupported by temporarily allowing businesses affected by COVID-19 \nto use funds from death and accidence insurance to prevent layoffs. \nAnticipating employment losses\u2014and in a bid to boost skills to \ncreate a tech-savvy workforce\u2014the government is accelerating the \nrollout of its new flagship program Kartu Pra Kerja, which provides \nyouths with training subsidies and job incentives. \n\nWith better weather and recent investment in palm oil \nplantations, growth in agriculture should hold up this year and \nnext. However, manufacturing and construction face headwinds in \n2020 from an unfavorable external environment. Growth in services \nwill moderate as consumers hold off on spending. Exceptions \nmay be information and communications as the digital economy \nfacilitates remote work and education services as online learning \nrapidly expands. \n\nInflation will likely remain within the revised central bank \ntarget range of 2%\u20134% both this year and next, forecast at 3.0% \nin 2020 and declining to 2.8% in 2021 as global and domestic \nconditions improve. The government is expected to maintain \nadministered prices for energy in the near term, while lower \ncommodity prices may further ease inflationary pressures. But \ntight food supplies and sudden currency depreciation could push \nup volatile prices for imported goods. While such increases may be \ntemporary, they could further depress household spending, which \nwill already be under pressure from the economic slowdown. \n\nThe current account deficit is forecast to equal 2.9% of GDP in \n\n2020 and 2021. While the recent drop in oil prices could prompt \ngains in the near term, improvement may be eroded as prices for \ngas, coal, palm oil, and rubber soften. With domestic demand \nexpected to wane in 2020, imports of goods and services are \nforecast to fall faster than exports, creating a small trade surplus. \nAs exports recover and fixed investment gains traction under policy \nreform in 2021, increased imports of capital goods will keep the \ncurrent account deficit unchanged from 2020.

The deficit in the primary income account is \nexpected to persist as foreign investors repatriate dividends. By \nrelying on investment inflow to finance the current account deficit, \nIndonesia remains vulnerable to global risk sentiment, particularly \nas two-thirds of equity and one-third of sovereign bonds are foreign \nheld. \n\nTo counter the economic slowdown, the central bank lowered \n\nits 7-day reverse repurchase agreement policy rate in February and \nMarch by a total of 50 basis points to 4.50%. The rupiah came under \npressure in March, prompting renewed central bank efforts to \nsupport exchange rate stability, minimize speculation, and smooth \ninvestment outflow by strengthened interventions in the bond, spot, \nand domestic non-deliverable forward markets. Interventions in the \nfirst quarter of 2020 helped preserve liquidity in the local currency \nmoney market. To alleviate foreign exchange pressures and boost \nbanks\u2019 foreign exchange liquidity, the central bank halved reserve \nrequirements for commercial banks from 8% to 4%. \n\nFiscal policy supports growth. The government has unveiled \nstimulus packages that offer incentives and subsidies for workers \nand businesses. In addition, it will maintain sizable expenditure on \ninfrastructure at 16.5% of total expenditure, equal to 2.4% of GDP. \nLower tax collection and a drop in taxes on oil production are likely \nto leave a revenue shortfall. This shortfall and heightened spending \non stimulus measures are likely to push the fiscal deficit above the \ntarget of 1.8% of GDP in the 2020 budget. \n\nRisks to the growth outlook are on the downside. External \n\nrisks would include an extended COVID-19 outbreak, further \ndeclines in commodity prices, worsened finance market volatility, \nand capital outflows from Indonesia. The combination of these \ndevelopments may result in a global recession. Domestic risks relate \nto how quickly and effectively the spread and economic impacts of \nthe COVID-19 outbreak are contained, as well as to constraints on \nfiscal policy associated with sliding revenues and reliance on capital \nmarket financing. Limitations in the health-care system could, along \nwith difficulties to enforce social distancing measures, prolong \nimpacts. If business and consumer sentiment remain subdued, \npotential second-round impacts could include bankruptcies and \nlayoffs, with the poor and vulnerable greatly exposed because of \nsocial protection gaps. Timely action is therefore required, making \nany delay in stimulus program rollout particularly critical. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014a tech-savvy and \ninnovative workforce\nGrowth in Indonesia has averaged 5% since 2015, yet much higher \ngrowth is needed for the country to achieve its ambition to join \nthe world\u2019s five largest economies by 2045.

A study by ADB and the Ministry of \nFinance, Innovate Indonesia, indicates that, if Indonesia optimized \nits adoption of new technologies to enable industry to use \nresources more efficiently, it could increase GDP per capita to \n$14,747 by 2045, putting its economy in the high-income group. \nTo exploit the benefits of new technologies, companies and \nworkers need to have the know-how to absorb and adopt them. \nHowever, the study notes, Indonesia currently lacks such workers. \nThis concern is shared across the automotive, electronics, food \nand beverage, textiles and clothing, and footwear industries. \nUsing LinkedIn data, a recent survey by the Mandiri Institute \nfound that many firms struggle to find workers with the right \ncompetencies in software and information technology services, \ninducing them to move to other countries. The share of the \npopulation in the 25\u201334 age group with a tertiary education is \nstill relatively low at 16.1%, below that of other countries in the \nGroup of 20 (Figure 3.24.12).\n\nPotential nevertheless exists for rapid technological \n\nadoption. Indonesia is projected to be among the world\u2019s largest \nproducers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \ngraduates because of rapid expansion in its population and \ntertiary education system (Figure 3.24.13). If this growing pool \nof local skills is well used, national capacity for development and \ninnovation will jump. \n\nThe government is addressing skills gaps. Enrollment in \ntechnical and vocational education is being expanded, and a \ntraining subsidy for unemployed youth has been introduced. \nFiscal incentives now encourage workforce training, as well as \nresearch and development.\n\nHowever, the challenge of growing a tech-savvy workforce \ngoes beyond expanding access to education. Indonesia needs to \nnurture knowledge and awareness of new technologies through \nan improved education and skills ecosystem that invests in \nskills for the future. To this end, firms should be encouraged to \noffer workforce training to enable workers\u2019 greater use of new \ntechnologies, while education and training providers should \nhave greater autonomy to respond to industry-specific skills \nneeds. Funding could be allocated to training programs that \naim to develop digital literacy within firms, in particular small \nand medium-sized enterprises.

Education Indicators in Focus No. 31.\n\n\fLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n\nFlooding  and  drought  in  2019  slashed  growth  in  agriculture  and  hydroelectric  generation. \nGrowth  could  decelerate  this  year  as  services  suffer  under  COVID-19  but  should  bounce \nback  next  year  as  services  recover  and  electricity  production  capacity  increases.  Inflation  rose \nsharply in the second half of last year, and the current account remained a concern. Following \nserious natural disasters in 2 successive years, fiscal reform is needed to better finance disaster \npreparedness, response, and recovery, especially as disasters worsen under climate change.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth fell from 6.2% in 2018 to 5.0% in 2019, a slowdown \nreflected in modest credit growth at 7.4% (Figure 3.25.1). \nDisasters slowed growth in both agriculture and hydroelectric \nproduction. The impact of flood, drought, and African swine \nflu on agriculture, which provides 15.5% of GDP, was mitigated, \nhowever, by increased cash crop production. Agriculture still \nreversed 1.3% growth in 2018 to contract by 0.2% last year.\nIndustry growth declined from over 7.0% in 2018 to just \n\n4.1%. Drought caused electricity generation, the backbone \nof industry, to reverse growth at 10.6% in 2018 with 3.0% \ncontraction in 2019. In contrast, robust construction growth at \n16.8%\u2014reflecting megaprojects for a railway, an expressway, and \n16 special and specific economic zones\u2014helped sustain growth \nin industry. Growth in services edged up from 7.0% in 2018 to \n7.2%, sustained by strong expansion in tourist arrivals, notably \nfrom, in descending order, Thailand, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and Viet Nam. Growth in tourist arrivals overall \naccelerated sharply from 8.5% in 2018 to 14.4% (Figure 3.25.2).\nHigher food prices and a weaker local currency raised \naverage inflation from 2.0% in 2018 to 3.3% last year (Figure \n3.25.3). A surge in rice, meat, and pork prices since the third \nquarter pushed food price inflation to 10.2% in December 2019, \nelevating overall inflation in December 2019 to 6.3% from 1.4% a \nyear earlier.\n\nExport growth softened from 18.7% in 2018 to 4.5% in \n2019. Electricity exports fell but were offset by higher exports \nof commercial agricultural produce, garments, gold, and agro-\nprocessing products (Figure 3.25.4). Import growth plunged \nfrom 6.0% in 2018 to 0.5% as Lao kip depreciation made imports \nmore expensive and as economic growth faltered.

The current account deficit \nnarrowed from the equivalent of 13.0% of GDP in 2018 to 9.5%. \nGross international reserves edged up from $873.2 million at \nthe end of 2018 to $997.3 million a year later, providing cover for \nonly 1.5 months of imports. External debt declined from 92.8% at \nthe end of 2018 to 92.2% at the end of 2019.\n\nThe fiscal deficit expanded partly because of higher \n\nspending to cope with contrary weather. As public expenditure \nfell slightly from the equivalent of 21.0% of GDP in 2018 to 20.7% \nlast year, so did revenue collection, from 16.3% of GDP to 15.7%. \nThe resulting fiscal deficit increased from 4.7% of GDP to 5.0%.\nThe central bank manages the exchange rate to stabilize \ninflation. By the end of 2019, monetary authorities had gradually \nallowed the regulated commercial bank rate of the kip to \ndepreciate against the US dollar. In the parallel market, the kip \ndepreciated by 5.8% against the dollar, reflecting the lack of \nconfidence on the local currency.\n\nEconomic prospects\nAn ongoing regional growth slowdown and the COVID-19 \noutbreak will hinder economic growth as tourist arrivals, \ninvestment, trade, and services suffer downturns. COVID-19 \nmay severely trim service growth from 7.2% in 2019 to just 1.3% \nin 2020. This will be offset in part by increases in electricity \ngeneration by at least 9,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year\u2014\n7,400 GWh from the Xayaburi Hydropower Project and 1,600 \nGWh from the Nam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project\u2014equal to \n26.0% of current total capacity. Other offsetting factors will be a \ncontinuing public construction boom and agricultural recovery \nfrom drought in 2019. Growth is forecast at 3.5% in 2020 (Figure \n3.25.5). As services recover from COVID-19 in 2021, growth \nshould rise to 6.0%.\n\nAgriculture is expected to grow by 2.5% this year and 2.7% \nin 2021, contingent on good weather and recovery in livestock \nand fishery output. Industry growth is forecast to recover to 5.7% \nin 2020 as electricity production and exports increase and then, \nwith railway construction speeding up in 2021, to rise to 6.8%. \nProvided that COVID-19 is contained this year and its impact \non tourism, transport, wholesale and retail trade, and related \nservices begins to wind down, services growth should recover to \nabout 6.4% in 2021. \n\nInflation is projected to accelerate to 4.0% in 2020 and \n\n4.5% in 2021, reflecting higher prices for food, clothing, and \ntransportation.

Revenue and grant are projected to equal 14.8% of GDP \nin 2020 and 15.5% in 2021, and expenditure to equal 20.7% and \nthen 21.0%. The budget deficit is thus expected to edge up to \n5.9% of GDP in 2020 and 5.5% in 2021 (Figure 3.25.7). \n\nDomestic risks to the growth outlook include adverse weather \n\nconditions and the slow pace of public finance management \nreform. External risks include a regional slowdown caused by \ntrade tensions between the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand uncertain global financial conditions. Risks from COVID-19 \nare viewed as both domestic and external.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014building resilience and \nfiscal buffers\nDisaster resilience in the Lao PDR is inadequate, and \nconsequent damage is frequent and substantial. Agriculture, \nwhich employs more than 70% of the population, is particularly \nvulnerable. Floods in 2018 are estimated to have cost $371 \nmillion, and flooding and drought in 2019 at least $380 million, \naffecting transport, agriculture, economic growth and stability, \nsocial welfare, government finances, and the current account.\nThe social impact of disasters includes worsened personal \n\nvulnerability while living in temporary shelters, temporary \nloss of livelihood, forced migration, increased indebtedness, \nlong-term unemployment, and malnutrition especially for \nchildren and young adults, the poor, women, and other \ndisadvantaged groups.\n\nTo create fiscal space to cope with disasters, fiscal policy \nshould aim to expand the revenue base, reduce the large fiscal \ndeficit, and ensure the proper management of public finances \nand public debt. To augment government funds for disaster \npreparedness, response, and recovery, the government should \nexplore the use of insurance, such as through the Southeast \nAsia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility.\n\nUltimately, the best way to deal with disasters is to \nbuild resilience. Climate resilience should be a feature of \nnew infrastructure design and development. Risk-informed \ndevelopment planning, budgeting, and financing to strengthen \nresilience should be considered for high-risk economic \nand geographic areas. Disaster response should be better \ncoordinated by national and local agencies, local communities, \nand development partners. The national development plan \nshould incorporate disaster risk reduction, response, and \nrecovery as crosscutting and multisectoral features.\n\nTable 3.25.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20026.2\n\n\u20025.0\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\n\u2002\u20022.0\n\n\u20023.3\n\n\u201313.0\n\n\u20139.5\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20024.0\n\n\u20139.4\n\n\u20026.0\n\n\u20024.5\n\n\u20138.1\n\nSources: Lao Statistics Bureau; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.25.6\u2002 Current account balance\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nFigure 3.25.7\u2002Fiscal indicators\n\nPublic debt\n\n% of GDP\n\nFiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nForecast\n\nNote: Fiscal balance is in reverse axis.\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; IMF \nestimates.\n\n% of GDP\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-12\n\n-18\n\n-24\n\n-30\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n0\n\n\fMalaysia\n\nWeaker  external  demand  and  domestic  investment  dragged  down  growth  in  2019.\nInflation  remained  muted,  and  the  current  account  surplus  widened  as  imports  fell  more \nsharply than exports.

Inflation will pick up slightly as it returns to trend, and \nthe  current  account  surplus  will  continue.  Preparing  the  workforce  for  the  future  requires \nmore  reform  of  general  education  and  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth dropped to 4.3% in 2019, its slowest in a decade \n(Figure 3.26.1). Growth in private consumption, the largest \ncomponent of aggregate demand, remained strong but slipped \na bit from 8.0% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2019. While employment \ngrowth, wage increases, and relatively stable consumer prices \nunderpinned buoyancy in private consumption, other factors \nthat supported consumer spending were government measures \nto counter the high cost of living, notably special pension \npayments and a doubling of grants and transfers. Robust \nconsumer spending partly offset sluggish growth in exports \nand domestic investment. Weaker global growth, trade tensions \nbetween the US and the People\u2019s Republic of China, and lower \ncommodity prices dragged down export earnings. Lackluster \ninvestment continued in 2019, partly as a result of a government \nprogram to rationalize expenditure. While private investment \nexpanded by 1.5% in 2019, government investment plunged by \nnearly 11.0%.\n\nBy sector, growth in services decelerated from 6.8% in 2018 \nto a still robust 6.1%, with consumer services especially strong. \nGrowth in industry decelerated from 3.1% in 2018 to 2.1% last \nyear. Manufacturing growth decelerated from 5.0% in 2018 \nto 3.8% in 2019 as export demand weakened, particularly for \nelectronics. Shutdowns of maturing oilfields, some but not all of \nthem planned, caused mining and quarrying output to continue \nto decline but at a slower pace than in 2018. Construction \nmirrored the sluggish investment performance on the demand \nside, growing marginally only in the final quarter of the year on \nimprovement in housing starts and civil engineering works on \nlarge transportation projects. Growth in agriculture markedly \nimproved from 0.1% in 2018 to 1.8% in 2019 (Figure 3.26.2). \n\nThis chapter was written by Thiam Hee Ng and Maria Theresa Bugayong of \nthe Southeast Asia Department, ADB, Manila.\n\nFigure 3.26.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nPublic gross \ufb01xed capital formation\nPrivate gross \ufb01xed capital formation\nChange in stocks\nImports\nExports\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n5.7\n\n5.1\n\n4.4\n\n4.7\n\n4.3\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSources: Haver Analytics; Bank Negara Malaysia. 2020. \nMonthly Statistical Bulletin.

This suggests a lack \nof wage pressure and lower domestic oil prices but also higher \nsubsidies for several commodities. A deflationary trend in 2018 \nstretched to the first quarter of 2019, but inflation slowly started \nrising in March to reach an average of 0.7% for the full year \n(Figure 3.26.3). Price increases were largest for food, housing, \nwater, electricity, furnishings, and education. Transport prices \ndeclined, however, as domestic retail fuel price ceilings were \nmaintained. Bank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, reduced its \npolicy rate in January and again in March 2020 to 2.50%, mainly \nto prevent a further slowdown in the economy. \n\nThe financial sector remains stable with banks well \ncapitalized. The share of nonperforming loans in bank \nportfolios remained low. Credit growth slowed partly as a \ndeliberate measure to manage risk arising from high household \nindebtedness and also real estate speculation. With inflation \nunder control and broad money growth decelerating from 9.1% \nat the end of 2018 to 3.5% a year later, the statutory reserve \nrequirement was lowered from 3.5% to 3.0% on 16 November \n2019 to further support domestic liquidity.\n\nGovernment revenues improved significantly in 2019, \n\nclimbing from RM236.5 billion in 2018 to  RM261.8 billion \nand rising as a percentage of GDP from 16.3% to 17.3%. The \nimprovement came primarily from Petronas nontax dividends \namounting to RM54 billion in 2019, more than twice the amount \nremitted to the government in 2018. Expenditure increased \nby 8.3% to RM314.6 billion, equal to 20.8% of GDP. Operating \nexpenditure\u2014including salaries, interest payments, grants, \ntransfers, and subsidies\u2014increased by 10.4%. By contrast, \ndevelopment expenditure contracted, falling by 0.4% due to \nrevisions and timeline adjustments in the implementation of \nmajor infrastructure projects such as Light Rapid Transit 3, \nMass Rapid Transit 2, and the East Coast Rail Link. The ratio \nof the fiscal deficit to GDP declined from 3.7% in 2018 to 3.4%. \nWith the government strengthening its efforts to simplify and \nfacilitate business procedures, Malaysia now ranks 12th among \n190 economies in the World Bank survey Doing Business 2020. \n\nExport earnings in US dollar terms declined by 4.3% in 2019 \n\nas commodity prices were generally depressed and external \ndemand weak. Exports of electronics, comprising 46% of the \ntotal, declined by nearly 5.0%, while the combined export value \nof crude oil products and liquefied natural gas declined by \n35.5% because of economic weakness in the US and the PRC, \nboth of them key markets for Malaysia\u2019s exports. The dollar \nvalue of imports declined by 5.5% in 2019.

However, \neven as external demand falls sharply, domestic demand will \ncontinue to grow, albeit with private consumption expected to \nslow after strong growth last year and with public investment \nexpected to remain sluggish. \n\nThe new administration which took office in March 2020 \n\nhas announced it will continue implementing the large scale \ninfrastructure projects announced in Budget 2020. Nevertheless, \nprivate investment is expected to continue to be sluggish with \nthe disruptions and uncertainties from the COVID-19 outbreak. \n(Figure 3.26.5). On the positive side, two policy rate cuts, in \nJanuary and March this year totaling 50 basis points, and the \nreduction in the reserve requirement by another 100 basis points \nto 2.0%, could provide a boost to investment. With the COVID-19 \noutbreak disrupting supply chains and travel, exports of goods \nand services are expected to continue to contract. GDP growth is \nthus expected to drop to 0.5% in 2020 before recovering to 5.5% \nin 2021 (Figure 3.26.6).\n\nGrowth in private consumption is expected to weaken in \n2020 with the outbreak of COVID-19 discouraging people to \ngo out. Consumption growth is expected to be supported by \ncontinued income growth, a higher minimum wage, and a low \nunemployment rate. Effective on 1 February 2020, the minimum \nwage for workers in 16 city councils and 40 municipal councils \nwas raised by about 9%. \n\nWith the number of  COVID-19 infections in Malaysia \n\npicking up in March and the imposition of a restricted movement \norder nationwide, consumption spending is expected to take \na hit especially in restaurants and hotels. A stimulus package \nannounced on 27 February 2020 could help mitigate some of the \nimpact of the COVID-19 outbreak on consumption by offering \nincentives for domestic tourism and a temporary optional \nreduction in employee contributions to the Employees Provident \nFund.

Moreover, the big drop in global oil \nprices are expected to help keep inflation well under control, at \n1.0% in 2020 and 1.3% in 2021 (Figure 3.26.7). \n\nMultiple factors will continue to weigh in on Malaysia\u2019s \nexport growth in 2020: a much weaker external environment, \nsupply chain disruption, and lower agriculture and mining output \n(Figure 3.26.8). However, a recovery in exports is seen in 2021 \nas the impact of COVID-19 fades. Meanwhile, import growth is \nexpected to remain weak as investment growth continues to lag \nand depress demand for imports of intermediate goods. The net \nresult will likely be a smaller current account surplus of 2.3% of \nGDP in 2020 and widening to 2.9% of GDP in 2021. \n\nIn response to the worsening global environment, the \ngovernment will have to strike the right balance in its fiscal \nstance between supporting economic growth and maintaining \nfiscal sustainability. Public consumption is expected to maintain \nits trend growth. A stimulus package in February totaling RM20 \nbillion included RM3.5 billion in additional federal government \nspending, RM3.5 billion in loan funds, and RM13 billion in \noptional cuts to Employees Provident Fund contributions. An \nadditional RM3.9 billion of support was announced by the new \nadministration in March 2020. Both these stimulus packages are \nexpected to counter the effects of COVID-19 on consumption and \nsupport affected businesses. \n\nRisks to the outlook tilt to the downside as the global \neconomic environment could contract further and a prolonged \nCOVID-19 crisis could place further downward pressure on \nMalaysia\u2019s growth prospects. A key domestic risk to the forecast \nwould be any delay in implementing large infrastructure projects.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014preparing the workforce \nfor the future\nThe government unveiled its Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 \nlast year with the aim of providing a decent living standard to \nall Malaysians by 2030. To achieve this vision, it has identified \neducation, including technical and vocational education \nand training (TVET), as a key enabler. This will require \nconsiderable investment in the workforce to ensure that it \nis sufficiently educated and skilled to meet the vision of a \nprosperous society. \n\nOver the years, Malaysia has made significant strides in \neducation. By 2019, it had achieved near universal primary \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMalaysia\u2002\u2002283\n\nFigure 3.26.9\u2002 Unemployment rate\n\nAll ages\nYouth\n\n% \n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2016\n\n2019\n\nNote: Youth unemployment refers to the share of the \nlabor force ages 15-24 without work but available for and \nseeking employment. \nSource: The World Bank database, https://data.worldbank.\norg/indicator (accessed 10 March 2020).\n\nschooling and had improved access to secondary schooling. The \nnumber of universities in Malaysia has expanded considerably, \nand now 21 public universities and 38 private universities churn \nout about 51,000 graduates annually. \n\nDespite these impressive achievements in the number of \n\ngraduates from institutions of higher education, there are \nconcerns that a large share of them are ill-prepared for the job \nmarket. One key challenge is reflected in the growing number \nof university graduates who are unable to find work (Figure \n3.26.9). According to a study conducted in 2018 by the Ministry \nof Education, nearly 60% of graduates remain unemployed \nfor at least a year after graduation. This partly reflects the \nview of employers that university graduates do not have the \nnecessary technical and soft skills for the job. At the same time, \nthere is considerable heterogeneity in the quality of graduates, \nencouraging some graduates to have unrealistically high \nexpectations for their salary on the basis of their degree.\nWhile there is no shortage of jobs overall, there is a \n\nproblem of skills mismatch. Most graduates prefer white \ncollar jobs, and many are unwilling to take up blue collar jobs. \nFurther, TVET is not a popular education choice for many \nstudents, with only 13% of upper secondary students choosing \nto pursue it. \n\nWith employers preferring job candidates with a \ncombination of hard skills such as analytical thinking and \nproblem solving, as well as the soft skills of communication \nand team work, it is important for the educational curricula \nto strike a good balance between the two skills sets. Existing \ngraduates can be encouraged to acquire soft skills through \nwork experience or assignment at companies. The 2020 budget \nintroduced the Graduates@Work program, through which \nthe government will offer a wage incentive of RM500 per \nmonth for two years to graduates who obtain a job after being \nunemployed for more than 12 months. Employers will receive a \nhiring incentive of up to RM300 per month for each new hire \nfor 2 years. This looks like a promising public program to help \ngraduates upgrade their soft skills on the job. \n\nReforming TVET could help make the program more \nattractive to students. Currently there are over 1,000 TVET \ninstitutes, a number that can be rationalized to strengthen \ntheir quality. These TVET institutes should work closely with \nindustry to identify skills gaps and train workers in the skills \nthey need to fill these vacancies.\n\n\fMyanmar\n\nGrowth picked up last year, the current account deficit narrowed, and inflation accelerated. \nAs COVID-19 poses an external risk in FY2020, growth is projected to slow before picking \nup again in FY2021. Inflation is forecast to ease slightly over the next 2 years. The current \naccount  deficit  will  widen  as  exports  and  service  receipts  weaken,  while  the  fiscal  deficit \nwill  remain  manageable.  Empowering  the  rural  economy  and  reducing  poverty  depend  on \ncreating  jobs  and  building  climate  change  resilience.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth picked up to 6.8% in fiscal year 2019 (FY2019, \nending 30 September 2019) from 6.4% in the previous year. \nGrowth accelerated in two sectors (Figure 3.27.1). Agriculture \ngrowth recovered from a scant 0.1% in FY2018 to 1.6% in \nFY2019, reflecting improved weather and export demand for \nsome agricultural products, notably beans, pulses, and fishery \nand livestock products. Industry grew by 8.4% in FY2019 as \ngarment manufacturing and construction expanded. Services, \non the other hand, saw growth moderate from 8.7% in FY2018 \nto 8.3% in FY2019 as growth in tourism slowed.\n\nThe pickup in GDP growth was accompanied by sharply \n\nhigher inflation, surging from 5.9% in FY2018 to 8.6% as \nprices for food and imported fuel rose. Although agricultural \nproduction expanded, higher external and internal demand \npushed up prices for some major food items despite exchange \nrate stability in 2019. \n\nAs net service receipts and export of goods increased while \n\nimports stalled with lower demand for investment goods, the \ncurrent account deficit narrowed from the equivalent of 3.7% of \nGDP in FY2018 to 3.5% in FY2019. Export growth decelerated \nto 10.0%, reflecting a fall in primary exports such as gas, rice, \nand minerals in response to weaker regional and global demand. \nHowever, acceleration in garment exports moderated the \nslowdown in exports overall (Figure 3.27.2). Meanwhile, import \ngrowth was stable at just above 7% in both FY2018 and FY2019. \nForeign direct investment (FDI) commitments expanded \n\nfrom $3.3 billion recorded from October 2017 to September \n2018 to $4.2 billion in FY2019 (Figure 3.27.3).

Yet the FY2019 budget estimated a higher \ndeficit equal to 5.0% of GDP to accommodate an intended \nincrease in capital expenditure. \n\nTo improve stability and compliance with finance rules \n\nand regulations, the government has undertaken several \nreforms: support to state-owned banks to improve their \ncorporate governance, a gradual opening of the banking and \ninsurance industries to foreign institutional investors, and \npartial relaxation of the interest rate cap on unsecured lending. \nMeanwhile, broad money supply growth slowed in the year to \nJune from 18.6% in 2018 to 12.0% in 2019.\n\nEconomic prospects\nGDP growth will likely slow significantly to 4.2% in FY2020 \nunder the COVID-19 pandemic but, if the virus is confined \nquickly, recover to 6.8% in FY2021 (Figure 3.27.4). Lower \ngrowth in FY2020 reflects how severely the COVID-19 \npandemic will hit global, regional, and local economies. \n\nThereafter, however, a pickup in industry and a gradual \n\nrebound in investment and exports should support the \nexpected recovery of GDP growth to 6.8% in FY2021. Growth \nin agriculture will decelerate to 1.3% in FY2020, reflecting \nthe potential negative impact of COVID-19 on exports of some \nprimary products.\n\nWith weaker demand and possible supply-side constraints, \n\nincluding reduced availability of intermediate goods from \ncountries affected by COVID-19, the purchasing managers\u2019 index \nfell to 49.8 in February 2020. This prompts a forecast that growth \nin industry will decelerate to 5.6% in FY2020.\n\nFurther growth in construction is expected, supported by \ncontinued reform to the legal and regulatory framework, the \nimplementation of various infrastructure projects, and efforts \nto counter a housing shortage. Moreover, the extension of \nthe European Union\u2019s generalized scheme of preferences for \ndeveloping trade partners will enable expansion in export-\noriented industries such as garments, particularly in FY2021. The \noutlook for industry thus remains positive, with growth expected \nto pick up to 8.7% in FY2021. A lower growth rate of 4.5% is \nexpected for services in FY2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic \ncould have a dramatic impact on tourism at its peak during the \ndry season, which continues to May. \n\nInflation is expected to ease only slightly to 7.5% in FY2020 \nand FY2021, reflecting continuing rises both for food and other \ngoods.

As of January 2020, FDI commitments had \nincreased from $1.3 billion a year earlier to $2.1 billion. \n\nDespite growth in garment exports and net service receipts, \nthe current account deficit is forecast to widen this year and next \nwith the anticipated deceleration in exports and tourism service \nreceipts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as \npossibly higher intermediate imports. The current account deficit \nwill thus expand to equal 4.5% of GDP in FY2020 and FY2021 \n(Figure 3.27.5). \n\nThe fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 5.2% in FY2020, \n\nmainly to accommodate a proposed increase in spending \non public services such as education, health care, and social \nprotection, as well as continued building to fill infrastructure \ndeficits (Figure 3.27.6). The Central Bank of Myanmar has \nannounced an interest rate cut by 100 basis points effective 1 \nApril 2020 to stimulate growth and safeguard the economy from \na possible fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, \ntoward remedying the economic repercussions of COVID-19, \nthe government introduced a comprehensive economic stimulus \npackage that exempts and defers taxes, and establishes a \nCOVID-19 fund to offer low-interest loans to the industries worst \naffected.\n\nGrowth prospects are subject to significant downside \nrisks, including postponed FDI and decline in export demand \nif advanced economies fall into a recession due to the impact \nof COVID-19 pandemic.  There also remains some uncertainty \nabout the direction of government economic policy during the \npolitical transition starting from a general election in late 2020.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014empowering the rural \neconomy\nFollowing the implementation of comprehensive strategies \nto address poverty, Myanmar made significant progress in \nrecent years. The national poverty rate shrank by almost half \nin little more than half a dozen years, from 42.2% in 2010 to \n24.8% in 2017 (Figure 3.27.7). Aside from poverty reduction, \nimprovements have been achieved in gender equality, \nelectricity consumption (a proxy for economic activity), and \nliving standards. However, this notable progress has been \nshadowed by a persistently higher poverty rate in rural areas. \nPoverty festers at more than twice the national rate in rural \nareas, where 70% of the population lives. \n\nTable 3.27.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20026.4\n\n\u20025.9\n\n\u20133.7\n\n\u20026.8\n\n\u20028.6\n\n\u20133.5\n\n\u20024.2\n\n\u20026.8\n\n\u20027.5\n\n\u20027.5\n\n\u20134.5 \u20134.5\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nNote: Years are presented as \ufb01scal years ending 30 \nSeptember of that year.\n Source: Central Statistical Organization; Central Bank \nof Myanmar ADB estimates.\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\nFigure 3.27.5\u2002 Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nNote: From 2015 to 2017, years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 \nMarch of next year, 2018 onwards, the \ufb01scal year is from \n1 October of the previous year to 3o September of the \ncurrent year.\nSources: Central Bank of Myanmar; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.27.6\u2002 Fiscal balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nNote: From 2015 to 2017, years are \ufb01scal years ending 31 \nMarch of next year, 2018 onwards, the \ufb01scal year is from \n1 October of the previous year to 3o September of the \ncurrent year.\nSources: Central Bank of Myanmar; ADB estimates\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nMyanmar\u2002\u2002287\n\nFigure 3.27.7\u2002 Poverty headcount ratio\n\nNational\nRural\nUrban\n\n% of population\n\n53.9\n48.2\n\n32.2\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n30.2\n24.8\n\n11.3\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\nSource: Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry.\n\nIn recent years, the government has launched many \nprojects to improve rural livelihoods, strength residents\u2019 \nskills, and upgrade transport and communications. The \ngovernment continues to support financial inclusion in rural \nareas by encouraging commercial banks to expand into the \ncountryside by opening branches, installing ATMs, and setting \nup mobile banking, as well as by providing microfinance to poor \nhouseholds. Further, the Myanmar Sustainable Development \nPlan, 2018\u20132030 underscores the need to empower local \ncommunities toward poverty reduction. \n\nIt is important to create a dynamic rural economy off the \nfarm, strengthen human capital, enhance access to credit, build \nfarm-to-market transport networks, upgrade agro-processing \nindustries, and promote ecotourism to enhance off-farm \njob opportunities. Tourism could significantly contribute to \nrural development but would require an effective industry-\nmanagement strategy, a solid legal framework, and further \nimprovement in rural infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, the government should accelerate its \nimplementation of a comprehensive action plan for reducing \ndisaster risk to ensure that disasters do not push more \nvulnerable rural residents into poverty. Facilitating the provision \nof jobs and enhancing disaster resilience are the two most \nimmediate strategies to pursue to further reduce poverty and \naddress inequality in rural areas. As government revenue is \nlimited, public sector management should be improved to \noptimize funding as much as possible. \n\n\fPhilippines\n\nGrowth  moderated  in  2019  as  investment  slowed,  but  it  remained  strong.  The  economy \nwill  slow  sharply  in  2020  under  the  impact  of  COVID-19  before  rebounding  in  2021. \nExpansionary fiscal and monetary policies will support growth recovery once the pandemic \ndissipates.  Inflation  will  remain  moderate,  and  the  current  account  deficit  relatively  small. \nGreater focus on building climate change resilience is vital in light of the country\u2019s extreme \nvulnerability  to  natural  hazards.\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic growth went through an easing phase in 2019, \ndropping below its 6.3% long-term trend to 5.9%. The primary \nreason for moderation in growth was a slump in public \nspending on infrastructure in the first half of 2019 caused by \ncongressional delay in passing the 2019 national budget. With \npublic spending catching up in the second half of the year, \neconomic growth rebounded with a strong fourth-quarter \nperformance of 6.4% year on year. \n\nOn the demand side, private consumption sustained \nhigh growth at 5.8% and contributed most to GDP growth \n(Figure 3.28.1). This was achieved through strong employment \ngeneration, which created 1.3 million new jobs and pushed \nthe unemployment rate down from 5.3% in 2018 to 5.1% \nin\u00a02019\u2014a\u00a0historic low. Remittances from overseas workers \nexpanded by 3.9%, also supporting robust consumption growth. \nWith the catch-up in budgetary spending in the second half of \nthe year, government consumption rose by 10.5% in 2019. \n\nInvestment plunged from 13.2% growth in 2018 to 0.6% \n\ncontraction in 2019, primarily reflecting a 2.4% drop in \npublic construction but also lower investment in transport \nequipment by 14.0% and in machinery by 4.1%. Partly offsetting \nthese declines was a 13.8% increase in private construction. \nWeak\u00a0external demand slashed real growth in exports of \ngoods and services from 13.4% in 2018 to 3.2%. Import growth \nslowed even more, from 16.0% to 2.1%, reflecting lower \ndemand for investment goods and components for export-\noriented manufacturing\u2014and allowing net exports to modestly \ncontribute to growth. \n\nOn the supply side, service growth accelerated from \n6.8% in 2018 to 7.1%, contributing 70% of economic growth \nin\u00a02019 (Figure 3.28.2).

Industry growth eased from 6.7% in 2018 \nto 4.9% but still generated nearly 30% of increased GDP in \n2019. Manufacturing growth slipped to 3.8% on soft external \ndemand, but food and beverages, chemicals, metal products, \nand electrical machinery posted strong gains supported by \ndomestic demand. Brisk private construction partly countered \na decline in public construction in the first half (Figure 3.28.3). \nAgriculture growth was again modest but improved from\u00a00.9% \nin 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 despite being affected by weather \ndisturbances, including drought caused by El Ni\u00f1o in the first \nhalf of the year. \n\nInflation declined throughout 2019, the average dropping \nby half from 5.2% in 2018 to 2.5%. Core inflation also slowed, \nfrom 4.2% to 3.2%, helping to ease inflation expectations \n(Figure 3.28.4). Rice prices declined on improved supply \nsince the lifting of quantitative restrictions on rice imports in \nFebruary of last year. In line with falling inflation expectations, \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the central bank, began to loosen \nits monetary policy, reducing the overnight reverse repurchase \nrate by a cumulative 75 basis points in 2019. Additionally, \nthe central bank lowered the reserve requirement ratio for \nmost banks by 100 basis points from December 2019, bringing \nthe cumulative ratio reduction to 400 basis points in 2019. \nConsequently, growth in domestic liquidity (M3) picked up to \n11.9% year on year in January 2020 from 7.9% in January 2019. \n\nFiscal policy was automatically contractionary in the first \nhalf of 2019 because of the delay in passing the national budget \n(Figure 3.28.5). With strong catch-up in public spending in \nthe second half, however, fiscal policy became expansionary \n(Figure 3.28.6). For the whole year, the fiscal budget deficit \nrose from the equivalent of 3.2% of GDP in 2018 to 3.5% in \n2019. Budget expenditure excluding interest rose by 12.3% in \n2019, peaking at 31.3% in the fourth quarter. Growth in budget \nrevenue was higher by 10.1%, primarily through higher tax \ncollection. Tax revenue as a share of GDP rose to 15.2%, the \nhighest ratio achieved in over 2 decades.

However \nnecessary, these enhanced community quarantine measures \nwill weigh heavily on domestic demand. Following a sharp \nrise in reported cases of COVID-19 and incidences of local \ntransmission, the government enforced community quarantine \nin Metro Manila on 15 March. It shortly expanded community \nquarantine to the entire island of Luzon, home to over half \nof the population and the generator of over 70% of GDP. \nMass transit systems were suspended as home quarantine \nwas imposed on households, public gatherings prohibited, \nschools suspended, and most retail establishments closed, with \nsuch exceptions as supermarkets, hospitals, and pharmacies. \nQuarantine has been enforced as well in some towns, cities, \nand provinces outside of Luzon. The schedule for lifting the \nquarantine is initially mid-April, but this will be reviewed in \nlight of changes observed in the spread of the virus. \n\nThe negative effect on domestic demand is compounded \nby the impact of the outbreak in other countries on tourism, \ntrade, and remittances. The first-round effect was a slump \nin tourism and aviation. Preliminary data show 9.8% growth \nin tourist arrivals year on year in January plunging to 41.4% \ncontraction in February after travel restrictions were imposed. \nThe\u00a0People\u2019s\u00a0Republic of China and the Republic of Korea, \nearly hotspots of COVID-19, are key markets that together \nsupplied 45% of international visitors to the Philippines in 2019 \n(Figure 3.28.8). Second-round effects that emerged as global \nsupply chains were disrupted have affected manufacturing and \nmerchandise exports. \n\nRemittances from overseas Filipino workers, equivalent \n\nto 9% of GDP, will also slow. Large flows of remittances \ncome from the US, Europe, and the Middle East, which \ncollectively supply 70% of all remittances.

Fiscal support has been announced, the first relief \npackage featuring programs to contain COVID-19 and support \naffected businesses and vulnerable workers. Further relief and \nfiscal stimulus packages are expected. In the end, the planned \nbudget deficit equal to 3.2% of GDP is likely to be significantly \nexceeded.\n\nIn 2021, a V-shape recovery is expected with growth \nreaching 6.5%, provided that the effects of the virus outbreak \ndissipate by June 2020.\n\nPublic investment and a rebound in private consumption \n\nwill be the main drivers of the economic recovery. \nPublic\u00a0construction growth is expected to be strong with key \npublic infrastructure projects under way. The government \nannounced a revised infrastructure program in November \n2019 that identified 100 projects under its Build Build Build \ninfrastructure program, many of which are to be completed \nor substantially so by 2022. The revised program includes \nseveral infrastructure projects implemented by public\u2013private \npartnerships.\n\nPrivate consumption should recover strongly. Private \ninvestment is also expected to pick up in line with higher \npublic spending on infrastructure and as lower interest \nrates stimulate investment. Acceleration in public spending \non construction will drive investment in equipment and \nmachinery, while private construction is sustained by demand \nfor office and retail space and housing. \n\nAlso ready to help lift private investment are ongoing \ngovernment reforms to ease the administrative and regulatory \nburden on businesses, championed through the recently \nestablished Anti-Red Tape Agency. Several bills currently \nunder deliberation in Congress will, when approved, be \ncatalysts for private investment. They include packages under \nthe Comprehensive Tax Reform Program and initiatives to \nease restrictions on foreign participation in some investment \nareas through amendments to the Public Services Act, Retail \nTrade Liberalization Act, and Foreign Investments\u00a0Act. \nThese\u00a0reforms\u00a0are part of the government\u2019s strategy to \nsecure an A\u00a0credit rating by 2022, to further lower the cost of \nborrowing in international and domestic credit markets.\n\nFigure 3.28.8\u2002International visitors, 2019\n\nRepublic of Korea\n24%\n\nUnited States\n13%\n\nEurope\n10%\n\nOthers\n32%\n\nPRC\n21%\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Visitor arrivals exclude overseas Filipinos.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.28.9\u2002Policy interest rate\n\n%\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nMar\n2017\n\nMar\n2018\n\nMar\n2019\n\nMar\n2020\n\nNote: Overnight reverse repurchase rate.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 20 March 2020).\n\n\f292(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInflation at 2.8% in the first 2 months of 2020 is projected \n\nto average at 2.2% in the whole year and 2.4% in 2021. \nLower\u00a0global oil prices will be countered by price pressures \ncaused by African swine fever. With inflation expected to \nremain within the central bank target range of 2.0%\u20134.0%, \nthere is room for further monetary policy expansion. \n\nThe current account deficit is projected to remain modest \nthis year. Exports of goods and services, particularly tourism, \nwill slow under the COVID-19 pandemic, though imports will \nalso be muted by sluggish domestic demand. The PRC, Japan, \nand the US are among the country\u2019s main trading partners. \n(Figure 3.28.10). Softer global oil prices should also cushion \nthe deficit. The current account deficit will widen next year as \nimports strengthen to supply more robust public investment. \nOn\u00a0balance, the current account deficit is forecast to equal \n0.3% of GDP in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021.\n\nRisks are tilted to the downside. The main downside \n\nrisk to GDP growth in 2020 comes from COVID-19 and is \ntherefore highly unpredictable. The impact on the economy \nwill be larger than currently assumed if the global outbreak is \nprolonged beyond the first half, or if there is a sustained local \ntransmission in the Philippines. Also, a less-desirable U-shape \nrecovery is possible if disrupted supply chains are not restored \nquickly, workers are not rehired immediately, or business are \nslow to restart operations. The government has space, however, \nfor further fiscal and monetary expansion to mitigate the worst \neffects of the virus outbreak and to quicken economic recovery. \nEnsuring adequate resources to health care will help to prepare \nfor the outbreak.\n\nFigure 3.28.10\u2002Main trade partners, 2019\n\nShare to total imports\nShare to total exports\n\nPRC\n\nJapan\n\nEU\n\nUnited States\n\nHong Kong, China\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n%\n\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nNote: Refers to merchandise trade.\nSource: CEIC Data Company (accessed 12 March 2020).\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014building resilience \nunder\u00a0climate change\nThe global climate crisis is among the biggest challenges \nfacing humanity in the 21st century. Rising temperatures and \nsea levels\u2014and frequent extreme weather events such as heat \nwaves, droughts, and coastal flooding\u2014have already caused \ncostly environmental damage in many countries in Asia and \nthe Pacific in recent years. It has also contributed to frequent \nlocalized viral and bacterial epidemics within communities. \nNotably high profile in Australia, prolonged drought and \nhigh summer temperatures combined to spread catastrophic \nbushfires in 2019 and 2020. \n\nThe Philippines is a negligible contributor to global \ngreenhouse gas emissions (GHG), its emissions per capita \nfar lower than global or Asian averages (Figure 3.28.11). \nHowever, the country does have a large stake in mitigating \nclimate change, as it is among the world\u2019s most vulnerable, \nsituated in a highly cyclone-prone region and experiencing \n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.28.11\u2002 Territorial carbon dioxide \nemissions\n\n2000\n2018\n\nMetric tons per capita\n\nPHI\n\nVIE\n\nINO\n\nTHA\n\nMAL\n\nINO = Indonesia, MAL = Malaysia, PHI = Philippines, \nTHA\u00a0= Thailand, VIE = Viet Nam. \nSource: Enerdata. https://www.enerdata.net/  \n(accessed 20 March 2020).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nPhilippines\u2002\u2002293\n\nFigure 3.28.12\u2002 Greenhouse gas emissions \nby sector\n\n2000\n2018\n\nMillion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nPower\ngeneration\n\nTransport Industry\n\nEnergy\n\nOthers\n\nNote: Energy includes losses from oil re\ufb01ning. \nOthers\u00a0include commerce, residences, and agriculture. \nSource: Department of Energy.\n\n19\u201322\u00a0such\u00a0storms most years. The 2019 Global Climate Risk \nIndex ranked the Philippines fifth most affected by extreme \nweather events in 1998\u20132017. As an archipelago, the Philippines \nhas extensive areas susceptible to rising sea levels, with most \nof its municipalities, home to nearly 60% of the population, \nlocated on the coast. Moreover, a significant share of the \npopulation depends on agriculture for its livelihood, and this is \nthe sector likely to be worst affected by climate change. \nThe Philippines is active in global efforts to mitigate \nclimate change. In 2015, the government announced an \nambitious contribution to the Paris Agreement of a 70% \nreduction by 2030 in GHG emissions relative to business as \nusual, conditional on adequate international support. It ratified \nthe Paris Agreement 2 years later and declared that it will \nupdate its GHG emission reduction contribution. In addition, \nthe government has implemented an array of policies and \nprograms to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, \nand sustainable public transport systems. The Department \nof Tourism is rolling out its sustainable tourism development \nprogram for local governments, with investments in sewerage \ntreatment plants, drainage, and solid waste management. \n\nThe climate challenge for the Philippines over the next \n\n30 years is to avoid potentially large increases in GHG \nemissions while growing rapidly and to invest strategically in \nclimate resilience. A good next step would be to strengthen \nits commitment to reducing GHG emissions. Some countries, \nsuch\u00a0as New Zealand, have enacted or are considering \nlegislation to lock in net zero GHG emissions by 2040 \nor\u00a02050. The Philippines could do the same, as this would \nfurther encourage investment in climate change mitigation \nand resilience. The government and private sector could \nalso consider new approaches to investments in energy, \ninfrastructure, and agriculture.\n\nThe country can promote renewable energy sources further \n\nto drive economic growth. Significant GHG mitigation can \ncome from making electricity generation less carbon intensive. \nPower generation contributes half of Philippine GHG emissions \nwith its dependence on fossil fuels (Figure 3.28.12). The use \nof coal has expanded dramatically in recent years, more than \ndoubling from 12% of the primary energy mix in 2000 to 27% \nin 2018. Setting aside transportation and concentrating on \npower generation, the share of renewables declined from 43% \nin 2000 to 23% in 2018, while the coal-fired share rose to 52%. \nShifting the energy mix back to more renewables will require \nreform to incentivize large investments in renewable power \ngeneration. A carbon tax on polluting industries could be \nstudied. \n\nThe emergence of affordable low-carbon technologies \nsuch as solar and wind power offer opportunities to scale up \ninvestments. Promoting renewable energy would facilitate \n\n\f294(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\ntechnology transfer to the Philippines. Developing local \nexpertise in renewables has potential to create a new growth \nindustry that pioneers the export of renewable energy \ntechnology, creating new manufacturing industries and jobs.\nInfrastructure programs, particularly when part of \nrecovery and reconstruction following disasters, should \nbe climate friendly and resilient. The government\u2019s Build \nBuild Build program emphasizes mass urban transportation \nsystems to help reduce GHG emissions. Such investments \ninclude expanding metro and light rail systems, a subway in \nMetro\u00a0Manila, and an inter-region rail system such as from \nNew Clark City in Central Luzon to Calamba, Laguna in \nSouth\u00a0Luzon, which could transport 700,000 passengers daily \nby 2030. These mass urban transit systems would help shrink \nthe Philippines\u2019 carbon footprint. \n\nAgriculture offers opportunities for the government to \ninvest in climate resilience, as it is the sector most vulnerable \nto changes in rainfall and weather patterns, rising sea levels, \nand more frequent outbreaks of crop pests. Institutional reform \nwill be needed in water supply. A good first step would be for \nCongress to pass a bill to consolidate under one department the \n30-plus agencies currently concerned with water. Investment \nwill be needed to secure water resources and improve \nefficiency in irrigation and other water use. Institutional \nreform will be necessary to better enable agricultural extension \nservices to transfer appropriate technologies to farmers, as \nwell as to attract private sector participation in strengthening \nlivestock and crop health systems to prevent, detect, and \nrespond to pests and diseases. An array of emerging climate-\nsmart technologies and practices are available for adoption \nsuch as solar- or wind-powered water pumps, drip irrigation, \ninnovative greenhouse technologies, and more efficient field \nmachinery. \n\n\fSingapore\n\nGrowth  last  year  slowed  to  a  10-year  low  in  this  wide  open  economy.  As  the  global \neconomy  is  likely  to  continue  to  slow  with  the  spread  of  COVID-19,  growth  is  forecast  to \nbe subdued this year, with a slight pickup in 2021. Inflation is expected to remain subdued \nand the current account surplus ample. Embracing financial technology is key to continued \ngrowth  in  this  highly  developed  hub  of  Southeast  Asia.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth decelerated to 0.7% in 2019, its lowest since 2009, \nas export-oriented industries like manufacturing and trade \nwere affected by a downswing in the global electronics cycle, \nweaker global demand, and trade tensions between the US and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Having expanded by \n8.1% in 2018, exports of goods and services contracted by 1.6% \nlast year. Domestic demand remained robust, however, partly \noffsetting the export slowdown. \n\nAll major components of domestic demand\u2014private \n\nconsumption, government consumption, and investment\u2014held \nup well. While growth in private consumption moderated from \na 4.2% rise in 2018 to 3.7% last year, government consumption \ngrowth was only a trifle slower, edging down from 2.9% in 2018 \nto 2.8%. Consumption expanded by 3.5% on steady growth in \nprivate expenditure driven by higher spending on health care, \nclothing, food, education, and recreation. Meanwhile, domestic \nfixed investment continued to decline, but with the pace of \ncontraction slowing from 3.4% in 2018 to 0.2% (Figure 3.29.1).\nBy sector, manufacturing shrank by 1.4%, dragged down \n\nmainly by weaker electronics exports. Among services, \nwholesale and retail trade declined by 2.9%, but all others \nposted positive growth. Finance and insurance, business \nservices, and the \u201cother services\u201d category were the main \ndrivers of service sector growth. Construction turned around \ncontraction by 3.5% a year earlier to grow by 2.8%, with public \nand private construction both expanding (Figure 3.29.2).\n\nAverage consumer price inflation rose marginally from \n0.4% in 2018 to 0.6%. An increase in administered prices for \nroad transportation more than offset the slight decline in \nhousing and utility prices. Transportation costs increased on \nhigher fares for public transport and on higher gasoline prices \n\nThis chapter was written by Shu Tian and Mai Lin Villaruel of the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB, Manila.\n\nFigure 3.29.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nGross capital formation\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n2019\n2018\n\nFinance and insurance\nOther services\nBusiness services\nOwnership of dwellings\nInformation & communications\nConstruction\nTransportation & storage\nAccommodation & food services\nUtilities\nOther goods industries\nManufacturing\nWholesale & retail trade\n\n-6\nSource: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

Core inflation, which \nexcludes accommodation and private road transport, rose by \n1.0% on increased costs for education, food, health care, and \nrecreation and culture (Figure 3.29.3).\n\nThe trade surplus expanded to equal 26.3% of GDP in \n2019, though both exports and imports of goods weakened \nin US dollar terms. Merchandise exports declined with the \ncontinued global slump in electronics, while merchandise \nimports contracted as those of both oil and other merchandise \nshrank. Service exports have recorded robust growth in recent \nyears and now exceed merchandise exports. Net service exports \namounted to 1.5% of GDP in 2019 as receipts in financial & \ninsurance and business services exceeded travel and transport \npayments. The current account surplus thus remained nearly \nunchanged at the equivalent of 17.0% of GDP, but the overall \nbalance of payments fell to a deficit equal to 2.3% of GDP as \nfinancial accounts ran a greater deficit owing to higher net \noutflow of portfolio investment (Figure 3.29.4).\n\nIn April 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singapore \nmaintained its policy of encouraging the modest and gradual \nappreciation of the Singapore dollar in nominal effective terms, \nbut in October it slowed the rate of appreciation slightly. The \nSingapore dollar appreciated in nominal terms against US dollar \nin the second half of the year (Figure 3.29.5). The Singapore \ninterbank offered rate had been rising since 2018 but fell by 0.22 \nbasis points from its peak in July 2019 to the end of December \n2019, which spurred higher credit growth in the second half of \nthe year (Figure 3.29.6).  \n\nThe fiscal deficit in fiscal year 2019 (FY2019, ended \n31 March 2020) was S$5.1 billion, equal to 1.0% of GDP. \nRevenue in FY2019 grew by 1.3%, driven by growth in \npersonal and corporate income tax, withholding tax, and an \nimpressive increase in statutory boards contributions. A rise \nin government expenditure reflected higher outlays on health \ncare, the environment, and economic development. Including \nnet investment returns on Singapore\u2019s reserves and special \ntransfers, however, the overall budget recorded a much lower \ndeficit in FY2019 of S$1.7 billion, equal to 0.3% of GDP\n\nEconomic prospects\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the economy showed signs of \nrecovery as GDP grew by 1.0%, supported by higher growth in \nconstruction and services.

Tourism-related services \nwill suffer in the near term as tourist numbers from the PRC, \nwhich has provided about 20.0% of the tourist arrivals in \nSingapore in recent years, and around the world are likely to \ndecline sharply.

The Ministry of Health has been granted an \nadditional budget of S$800 million to contain COVID-19, and the \ngovernment has introduced a stabilization and support package \nworth S$4.0 billion, aiming to aid businesses and boost consumer \nspending. As more economies are being affected by COVID-19, \nthese fiscal stimulus efforts may be partly offset by a greater \nextent of weakened external demand and supply chain disruption \nfrom major trading partners, hence, growth is expected at 0.2% \nin 2020 and 2.0% in 2021.\n\nInflation is expected to remain tame both this year and next, \n\nthough rising prices for food and some services will continue to \napply modest upward pressure on consumer prices, oil prices will \ndrag inflation in 2020. Low inflation allows monetary policy to \nease further to cushion the adverse effects from the COVID-19 \noutbreak.\n\nAs the PRC is a top trade partner of Singapore, external trade \n\nwill be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions brought \nabout by factory closures and weaker import demand. The trade \nis further weighed as more major trading partners are affected \nby the COVID-19.  On balance, the current account surplus is \nexpected to continue at 17% of GDP this year and next.   \n\nIn light of COVID-19, fiscal policy will likely continue to \nbe expansionary in FY2020, with the overall deficit expected \nto reach S$10.9 billion, equal to 2.1% of GDP. The government \npassed its 2020 budget with a S$5.6 billion special economic \npackage, including the above-mentioned S$800 million for \nMinistry of Health, to mitigate the economic consequences \nof COVID-19 in the short run and to bolster growth. As the \ngovernment has accumulated fiscal surpluses over the years, it \nenjoys enough fiscal space for an expansionary fiscal policy.\nRisks to the outlook include uncertainty over the scope, \nduration and impact of COVID-19, continuing trade tensions \nbetween the US and the PRC, and uncertain oil prices in light of \n\nTable 3.29.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20023.4\n\n\u20020.7\n\n\u20020.4\u2002 \u20020.6\n\n17.2\n\n17.0\n\n\u20020.2\n\n\u20020.7\n\n17.0\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20021.3\n\n17.0\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: Ministry of Trade and Industry.

Investment and adoption have soared in the past \nfew years, and the city now hosts nearly 40% of the fintech \nbusinesses in Southeast Asia. Despite trade tensions, fintech \ninvestment in Singapore continued to expand to nearly S$1 \nbillion during the first 3 quarters of 2019, a 69% increase \nover the same period in 2018 (Figure 3.29.8). Singapore \nowes its status as a leading global fintech hub partly to good \ninfrastructure, a convenient location, a favorable intellectual \nproperty regime, and a fintech-friendly policy and regulatory \nenvironment. The country now hosts more than 1,000 fintech \ncompanies and more than 40 innovation labs. \n\nSingapore\u2019s fintech development still faces some challenges. \n\nWhile it offers novel financial solutions for businesses, the \nrapid growth of fintech companies calls for more expertise \nand capacity in terms of compliance and risk-management \npractices. And, while markets in Southeast Asia present \ngood business opportunities, differences in legal systems \nand regulatory frameworks across the region may limit the \napplication and expansion of fintech solutions. Finally, while \nSingapore has a large pool of financial experts, demand is \nstill high for experts with skills in big data analysis, business \ndesign, social media, and other emerging areas. \n\nFintech companies may collaborate with traditional \n\nfinancial institutions to enhance their capacity in compliance \nand risk management, with traditional financial institutions \nbenefiting from exposure to new business models and \nhigher efficiency. They can partner as well with law firms, \ncommercial businesses, and fintech companies in other \nSoutheast Asian markets to lower cultural barriers and better \nunderstand national regulations. In addition, collaboration by \nSoutheast Asian central banks can engender a friendly regional \nregulatory environment for regional fintech companies aiming \nto tap the regional market. To increase the supply of fintech \nprofessionals, schemes to retrain workers and specially \ndesigned education programs for university students promise \nto close the supply gap over the long run.\n\n\fThailand\n\nRestrained  largely  by  slowing  exports,  Thailand  posted  paltry  growth  at  2.4%  last  year. \nGDP  growth  is  likely  to  slow  further  to  \u20134.8%  this  year  but  could  pick  up  to  2.5%  in \n2021.  Risks  to  the  growth  forecast  remain  tilted  to  the  downside  as  COVID-19  could  be \nespecially damaging to an economy heavily dependent on international trade and tourism. \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  could  benefit  from  help  in  adapting  their  business \nmodels  to  digital  technology. \n\nEconomic performance\nGDP growth plummeted from 4.2% in 2018 to 2.4% in 2019 \nas merchandise exports continued to contract (Figure\u00a03.30.1). \nExports of goods and services reversed growth in 2018 at \nmore than 3.0% to contract by 2.6% in 2019, largely reflecting \na slowdown in global trade tied to trade conflict between the \nUS and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Almost all major \ncategories of merchandise exports contracted.\n\nManufacturing export declines hit electronic components \n\nand devices, automobiles, petroleum-related products, \nand agricultural products, in particular rice and rubber. \nRice\u00a0exports were made less competitive by the local currency \nstrengthening against the US dollar. Meanwhile, exports of \nrubber declined following the implementation of the Agreed \nExport Tonnage Scheme of the International Tripartite Rubber \nCouncil, under which producers pledged to cut rubber exports \nfor 4 months beginning in April 2019.\n\nCombined exports to the European Union, the US, and \n\nJapan expanded by just 1.9%, with a 6.6% decline to the \nEuropean Union. Meanwhile, exports to other markets \ndeclined by 4.6%, dragged down by softer demand from \nSoutheast Asia. Exports of services bounced back in the second \nhalf of 2019 thanks to the return of PRC tourists, who stayed \naway after a fatal ferry accident in Phuket in July 2018; visa fee \nexemptions for tourists from India, the PRC, and Taipei,China; \nand increased flight frequencies between Thailand and the \nRussian Federation. Tourist arrivals in Thailand reached \n39.8 million in 2019, or 4.2% higher than in the previous year \n(Figure\u00a03.30.2). Meanwhile, government consumption remained \nlackluster, and growth in private investment slowed somewhat, \nfrom 4.1% in 2018 to 2.8%. \n\nThis chapter was written by Chitchanok Annonjarn of the Thailand Resident \nMission, ADB, Bangkok.\n\nFigure 3.30.1\u2002 Demand-side contributions \n\nto growth\n\nPrivate consumption\nGovernment consumption\nTotal investment\nNet exports\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.2\n\n3.4\n\n4.1\n\n2.4\n\n3.1\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Office of the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment Council. http://www.nesdc.go.th (accessed \n11 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.30.2\u2002Tourism Indicators\n\nNumber of tourists\n\nMillion visitors\n\nGrowth in the \nnumber of tourists\n\n7.5\n\n5.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.0\n\n-2.5\n\n-5.0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n%\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; CEIC \nData Company (both accessed 11 March 2020).\n\n\f300(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nWeak external demand kept investment and private \nconsumption soft, with expansion in the latter declining \nfrom 4.6% in 2018 to 4.5% last year. Meanwhile, government \nconsumption also remained subdued. Domestic demand \nwoes were made worse by a continued slowdown in private \ninvestment growth from 4.1% in 2018 to 2.8 % last year.\n\nWeak external demand and domestic consumption lowered \n\ncapacity utilization in manufacturing, inducing businesses \nto delay investment and crimping imports of capital goods. \nTo\u00a0boost sluggish domestic activity, the government introduced \neconomic stimulus measures such as soft loans for farmers, \nmore livelihood transfers to low-income earners, cash handouts \nand tax breaks to boost domestic tourist spending, and soft \nloans to small and medium-sized enterprises, but the impact \nseemed limited. Public spending recorded moderate growth, \nbut its support for economic growth faltered in the last \nquarter of 2019 owing to delays affecting investment projects \nof state-owned enterprises and the late enactment of the \nAnnual\u00a0Budget Expenditure Act for fiscal year 2020 (FY2020, \nending 30 September 2020) caused by a delay in formulating \na new government. In FY2019, the fiscal balance recorded a \nsmall deficit of 2.6% of GDP (Figure 3.30.3).\n\nAs merchandise exports contracted, merchandise imports \nfollowed suit, reversing 13.7% expansion in 2018 to decline by \n5.4% in 2019. Import contraction affected mostly imports of \nraw materials and intermediate goods, in line with broader \neconomic softening.\n\nGrowth slowed across sectors in 2019 (Figure 3.30.4). \nAgricultural output fell especially for rice and sugarcane, but \nsmaller harvests pushed up crop prices. In sum, agricultural \ngrowth sank from 5.5% expansion in 2018 to essentially\u00a0zero. \nIndustry output stagnated, and services, led by sluggish \ntourism, slowed from 4.8% expansion in 2018 to 4.0% in 2019. \nAs growth slowed, so did inflation, which edged down \n\nfrom 1.1% in 2018 to just 0.7% last year (Figure 3.30.5). \nLower\u00a0international oil prices played their part. Core inflation, \nwhich excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was even lower at \n0.5%. In\u00a0December 2019, the cabinet approved a new headline \ninflation target of 1%\u20133% for 2020, with which the Bank of \nThailand, the central bank, shaved 1 percentage point off the top \nof a target range that had been in place since 2015. The\u00a0central \nbank cited structural factors for driving down prices, including \nan aging population and technological advancements such as \nthe growth in e-commerce, which reduce costs.\n\nThe current account balance posted a larger surplus \n\nof $37.3\u00a0billion thanks to expanded surpluses in both \nmerchandise and services. The capital and financial account \nrecorded a deficit of $12.6 billion, mostly reflecting a rise in \noutward investment. The surplus in the overall balance of \npayments thus rose from $7.3 billion in 2018 to $13.6 billion. \n\nFigure 3.30.3\u2002 Fiscal balance\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of \nthat year.\nSource: Bank of Thailand, http://www.bot.or.th (accessed \n11 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.30.4\u2002 Supply-side contributions \nto\u00a0growth\n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nStatistical discrepancy\nGross domestic product\n\n3.1\n\n3.4\n\n4.1\n\n4.2\n\n2.4\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Office of the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment Council. http://www.nesdc.go.th \n(accessed\u00a011 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.30.5\u2002 Inflation and policy  \n\ninterest rate\n\nPolicy interest rate\nOverall in\ufb02ation\nCore in\ufb02ation\n\n% GDP\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n%\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.0\n\n-1.5\n\n%\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; CEIC \nData Company (both accessed 11 March 2020).\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand\u2002\u2002301\n\nInternational\u00a0reserves stood at $224.3 billion at the end of 2019, \nsufficient to cover 13\u00a0months of imports or 3.7 times short-\nterm external debt. With\u00a0a\u00a0comfortable balance of payments \nand international reserves, the Thai baht appreciated by 4.1% \nagainst the US\u00a0dollar in 2019 (Figure 3.30.6). \n\nThe central bank cut its policy rate, the 1-day repurchase \nrate, by 0.25% twice, in August and November 2019, to 1.25% \nto support growth during the slowdown and induce inflation \ntoward the target. Fiscal policy remained supportive of growth, \nwith an actual budget deficit rising from the equivalent of 2.8% \nof GDP FY2018 to 3.1%. Public debt remained sustainable at \n41.2% of GDP, only 2.7% of it held overseas.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThailand\u2019s economy is expected to remain sluggish in the \nnear term. GDP growth is projected to slow to \u20134.8% in 2020 \nand then recover to 2.5% in 2021 (Figure 3.30.7). Low growth \nwill be accompanied by benign inflation. Public debt is likely \nto remain sustainable despite more government borrowing \nfor mega infrastructure projects. The current account is seen \nto continue to remain in large surplus in 2020 with slow \neconomic activities, and narrow marginally in 2021 with \nincreased imports to supply investment projects (Table 3.30.1). \nExports of goods and services are projected to continue \n\ntheir declining trend this year, mainly because of the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, before turning around in 2021. Phase \none of the trade deal between US and PRC, signed earlier \nthis year, could help Thai exports, but it remains to be seen \nwhether or not the terms of the trade deal will actually \nbe implemented. Meanwhile, the impact of COVID-19 on \nmerchandise exports is likely to become clearer in the second \nquarter of 2020. Some exports such as electronics, automobiles, \nand chemical products are likely to suffer hits from supply \nchain disruptions in the PRC. Meanwhile, other exports\u2014\nnotably metal products, machinery, and equipment\u2014could gain \nfrom trade diversion, though probably not enough to offset \nthe impact from supply chain disruption. Exports of services \nare also expected to deteriorate in 2020 with a significant \ndecline in foreign tourists but rebound in 2021 as they return. \nGrowth in private consumption is expected to slow in 2020 as \ngrowth in household income weakens. In addition, COVID-19 \nand drought in 2020 dampen private consumption before it \nimproves in 2021 with gradual economic recovery.\n\nPrivate investment growth is projected to be negative this \n\nyear as external demand continues to decline, and business \nsentiment plunges mainly because of concern over the \nCOVID-19 outbreak. Traction should return next year as some \npublic\u2013private partnership and public investment projects that \nwere postponed in 2019 and 2020 finally begin implementation. \n\nFigure 3.30.6\u2002 Balance of payments \n\nand\u00a0exchange rate\n\nCurrent account balance\nFinancial account\nCapital account\nNet errors and omissions\nBalance of payments\n\nExchange rate\n\nTHB/USD\n\n34\n\n33\n\n32\n\n31\n\n30\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nappreciation\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2020\n\nSources: Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; CEIC \nData Company (both accessed 11 March 2020).\n\nFigure 3.30.7\u2002 GDP growth\n\n$ billion\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n%\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\n2015 2016 2017\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\nTable 3.30.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n4.2\n\n1.1\n\n5.6\n\n2.4\n\n0.7\n\n6.7\n\n\u20134.8\n\n\u20130.9\n\n\u20027.1\n\n2.5\n\n0.4\n\n6.7\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: Office of the National Economic and \nSocial Development Council. http://www.nesdc.\ngo.th; Bank of Thailand. http://www.bot.or.th; \nCEIC\u00a0Data Company (all accessed 11 March 2020); \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\fFigure 3.30.8\u2002 Inflation\n\n%\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n302(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThailand is expected to continue to benefit from government \nincentives to lure more foreign investors. In 2019, the value \nof investment applications to the Board of Investment rose \nby\u00a069.0%. Actual foreign investment should be more evident \nin\u00a02021. Merchandise imports are likely to improve with higher \ninvestment.\n\nGrowth is projected to moderate across sectors. \n\nGrowth\u00a0in\u00a0agriculture is expected to be meager, with drought \nacross nearly half of Thailand forecast to get worse in 2020. \nThe water level in the Mekong River is at its lowest since 1992, \naffecting agricultural output and farm incomes. Manufacturing \ngrowth is likely to soften this year and gradually improve \nnext year in line with economic recovery. The service sector \nis forecasted to record negative growth in 2020 as inbound \ntourism takes a substantially hit from the COVID-19 outbreak. \nSome tourism-related businesses temporarily close and lay \noff employees which threaten non-farm income. However, it \nis expected to get back on track in 2021. Low growth and the \ncollapse in oil prices should be accompanied by tame inflation, \nwhich is projected at \u20130.9% in 2020 and slightly higher at 0.4% \nin 2021, in line with economic outlook (Figure 3.30.8).\n\nOn the balance of payments, current account surplus is \nexpected to remain large in 2020-2021. It is projected to widen \nin 2020 with import collapse as a result of slow economic \nactivities. In 2021 import growth is expected to outpace that \nof exports, supported mainly by the rollout of infrastructure \nprojects which will narrow the trade surplus. Net service \nexports should post only a small surplus in 2020, given the \nimpact of COVID-19 on tourism. The current account surplus \nis projected to equal 7.1% of GDP in 2020 and 6.7% in 2021. \nThe\u00a0financial account could be balanced as Thai investors \nventure abroad more and foreign investment in Thailand also \nrises. The surplus in the overall balance of payments should \nremain comfortable, as should the country\u2019s international \nreserves (Figure 3.30.9). \n\naccommodative this year and next. The government anticipates \na FY2020 budget deficit of B469 billion, up by 4.3% from \nFY2019. However, budget expenditure is lagging because of \nprolonged negotiations to establish a coalition government. \nThis has delayed the start of new investment projects, weighing \non an already faltering economy. Any boost from the planned \nincrease in expenditure is heavily weighted toward the latter \nhalf of FY2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the central bank is expected to continue to \npursue an accommodative monetary policy to support economic \ngrowth. In February and March 2020, it cut its policy rate by \nfurther 0.50 percentage points in total to 0.75% in response to \nCOVID-19, delays in budget implementation, and severe drought. \nAs the policy interest rate is already low, the central bank may \nconsider using other measures jointly with monetary policy.\n\nFiscal and monetary policies are expected to remain \n\nFigure 3.30.9\u2002 Current account balance\n\n% of GDP\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: Asian Development Outlook database.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nThailand\u2002\u2002303\n\nRisks to the outlook tilt to the downside. The major external \n\nrisks are deeper contraction in global economic growth and \nany reheating of the trade conflict between US and the PRC. \nThe impact of COVID-19 will depend on how quickly it can be \nbrought under control. Knock-on impacts from a likely slowdown \nin inbound tourism could dent economic confidence within \nthe country for many months. Purely domestic risks to growth \ncould arise from delays in implementing the FY2020 budget or \ninfrastructure investment projects, or from prolonged\u00a0drought.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening smaller \nfirms through digital transformation\nSeveral global challenges and domestic structural issues have \nweighed on Thai economy in recent years, keeping actual \neconomic growth below potential. In response, the government \nhas actively promoted Thailand 4.0, a new economic model to \nembrace digital transformation. The private sector similarly \nrealizes the potential benefits of digital transformation, \nbut some businesses, especially small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), struggle to transition their businesses into \nthe digital phase.\n\nSMEs are considered the backbone of economic growth \nin Thailand as they account for more than 90% of enterprises \nin the country, employ some three-quarters of the national \nworkforce, and in 2018 supplied 43.0% of GDP growth \n(Figure\u00a03.30.10). However, prolonged economic uncertainty in \nthe past few years has kept SMEs from investing to improve \ntheir efficiency and productivity, adding to structural woes \nthat undermine competitiveness. \n\nSeveral forms of government support, notably soft loans, \n\nloan guarantees, and tax exemptions, could give a helping \nhand to struggling SMEs and keep them from going out of \nbusiness. However, SMEs need more than money to recover. \nThey need to transform themselves into smart SMEs, applying \nhigher technology and innovation in production processes and \nupgrading their capability to trade using online channels.\nA study conducted by Cisco Systems\u2014the information \n\ntechnology, networking, and cybersecurity giant\u2014and \nThailand\u2019s Office of Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion \nenumerated the hurdles to digital transformation that SMEs \nface: lack of customer data, digital skills and talent, and \na digital mindset. Policies should therefore provide more \nassistance toward improving SME access to technology, \nsupporting links with larger firms to enable technological \nupgrades, and improving education to equip students with \nknowledge and skills to thrive in the digital economy. \nOnce\u00a0SMEs can upgrade their capability and become more \nadvanced on a large scale, economic transformation and \nenhanced national competitiveness can follow (Figure 3.30.11).\n\nFigure 3.30.10\u2002SME expenditures\n\n41.1\n\n42.1\n\n42.4\n\n43.0\n\n43.6\n\n% of GDP\n\n46\n\n42\n\n38\n\n34\n\n30\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nQ3\n2019\n\nQ = quarter.\nSource: The Office of SME Promotion.\n\nFigure 3.30.11\u2002 Digital transformation \n\nchallenges for SMEs \nin\u00a0Thailand\n\nLack of talent\n16%\n\nLack of insight into\noperational/customer data\n18%\n\nLack of digital \nmindset\n14%\n\nOthers\n52%\n\nSME = small and medium-sized enterprise.\nSource: IDC-Cisco SMB Digital Maturity Index, 2019.\n\n\fTimor-Leste\n\nFiscal stimulus brought the economy back to growth in 2019, reversing 2 years of economic \ncontraction. Inflation eased on lower food prices, and the current account improved from \ndeficit  to  surplus,  if  only  briefly.  The  economy  is  expected  to  contract  in  2020  under \npolitical  uncertainty  and  should  pick  up  in  2021.  Improving  air  connectivity  and  reducing \ntravel costs with the rest of the world is an important enabler of economic diversification.\n\nEconomic performance\nGDP excluding the large offshore oil and gas industry \n(hereafter GDP) grew by 3.4% in 2019 (Figure 3.31.1). \nThis\u00a0return to growth was driven by modest fiscal stimulus. \nPublic spending increased by 4.3% in 2019 as a 13.2% increase \nin recurrent expenditure more than offset an 8.4% decline \nin capital and development expenditure. Public spending \nwas more evenly distributed throughout the year in 2019 \nthan in some recent years as the work of government \nwas uninterrupted by elections or the formation of a new \ngovernment, as earlier feared.\n\nWhile domestic revenue collection fell slightly, this was \noffset by high proceeds from petroleum taxes and Petroleum \nFund investments, together generating a surplus equal to 8.0% \nof GDP. Government consumption rebounded strongly in 2019, \nreversing 1.0% contraction in the previous year to expand by \n11.5%. Growth in private consumption slowed, however, from \n2.6% in 2018 to 1.9% last year. Similarly, investment contracted \ndespite ongoing work on major projects such as Tibar Bay port.\nBy sector, growth acceleration in 2019 was led largely by \nservices, which account for two-thirds of the economy and are \nclosely linked with government consumption. After contracting \nby 2.6% in 2018, the service sector posted robust 5.4% growth \nin 2019. Construction, by contrast, contracted by an estimated \n4.0% in 2019 as public investment declined, and agricultural \nproduction also shrank slightly with somewhat unfavorable \nweather.\n\nEven as GDP growth reversed a 2-year declining trend with \nfairly robust growth, inflation eased from 2.3% in 2018 to 0.9% \nin 2019, pulled down mostly by lower prices for imported food \n(Figure 3.31.3).\n\nThis chapter was written by David Freedman of the Cambodia Resident Mission, \nADB, Phnom Penh.\n\nFigure 3.31.1\u2002 Supply-side contributions \n\nto\u00a0growth\n\nAgriculture\nServices \nIndustry\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n3.1\n\n3.6\n\n3.4\n\n4.0\n\n-0.6\n\n-3.8\n\n-2.0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Statistics Timor-Leste; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.31.2\u2002 Public expenditure \n\ncomponents\n\nSalaries and wages\nGoods and services\nTransfer payments\nCapital expenditure\n\n$ million\n\n1,800\n\n1,200\n\n600\n\n0\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020 2021\nForecast\n\nSources: Timor-Leste Budget Transparency Portal; \nADB\u00a0estimates.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nTimor-Leste\u2002\u2002305\n\nA large increase in petroleum income and slight narrowing \n\nFigure 3.31.3\u2002 Inflation\n\nHeadline CPI\n\nFood\nTransport\nAlcohol & tobacco\n\nof the trade deficit moved a current account deficit equal to \n12.2% of GDP in 2018 into a surplus of 8.1%. Earnings from \ncoffee exports rose by 30.8% as export prices increased. \nWith\u00a0investment contracting and reduced imports of capital \ngoods, the trade deficit narrowed slightly. \n\nTurning to the offshore petroleum industry, a large \nincrease in petroleum income lifted the fiscal balance from a \ndeficit equal to 6.0% of GDP in 2018 into a surplus of 8.0% in \n2019. Meanwhile, though, money supply went the other way, \nreversing 3.1% growth in 2018 with 13.1% contraction last year.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is expected to contract by 2.0% in 2020 as \npolitical uncertainty weighs on government activity, and \nas measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic suppress \ndemand. GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 4.0% in 2021 \non moderate fiscal stimulus and reviving private investment.\nThe formulation of the 2020 budget was delayed by \ndisagreement within the three-party coalition that forms \nthe government. An initial proposal for $1.95 billion in \nappropriations in 2020 was submitted to the National \nParliament but then withdrawn. The budget proposal was \nrevised down and resubmitted but not approved. In the \nabsence of an approved budget, the government will make \nmonthly\u00a0appropriations equal to one-twelfth of the previous \nyear\u2019s budget.\n\nA range of measures including restrictions on international \ntravel have been introduced to control the spread of COVID-19. \nThese measures and the ongoing budget impasse will slow \nthe implementation of government programs and reduce \ndemand during the first half of this year, thus slowing growth. \nGovernment activity may pick up in the second half of 2020, \nbut the outlook is highly uncertain. More substantial stimulus \nis expected in 2021 as the government moves forward with the \nimplementation of its investment program.\n\n2019, and an infestation of fall armyworms, are expected to \nreduce the production of food and cash crops. Inflation is thus \nprojected to accelerate moderately to 1.3% in 2020 and 1.8% in \n2021 as food prices rise locally and internationally. \n\nVolatility in global bond and equity markets may affect \nthe performance of the investment portfolio of the Petroleum \nFund (Figure\u00a03.31.4). Projected lower oil prices will also hit \nfiscal and current account balances and may dampen investor \ninterest in developing new petroleum fields. The current \naccount is therefore expected to fall back into large deficits in \nthe near\u00a0term.\n\n% \n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n% \n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n20\n\n16\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Statistics Timor-Leste; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.31.4\u2002 Petroleum fund balance \nat\u00a0year-end\n\nPetroleum Fund Balance\n\nPer capita\n\n$ billion\n\n$ thousand\n\n2005\n\n2009\n\n2013\n\n2017\n\n2021\n\n2020\nForecast\n\nSources: Timor-Leste national budget documents, various \nyears; ADB estimates.\n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u2002-0.6\n\n\u2002\u20022.3\n\n-12.2\n\n3.4\n\n0.9\n\n8.1\n\n\u2002-2.0 \u2002\u20024.0\n\n\u2002\u20021.3 \u2002\u20021.8\n\n-10.5 -30.4\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: Statistics Timor-Leste; Timor-Leste Central \nBank; ADB staff estimates.\n\nA long dry season and spotty rainfall in the second half of \n\nTable 3.31.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\n\f306(cid:1)(cid:1)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014improving air \nconnectivity\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted temporary \nrestrictions on international air travel, improving air \nconnectivity for Timor-Leste and reining in unusually high \ncosts of air travel to neighboring countries will be crucial for \nachieving the country\u2019s medium-term objective of economic \ndiversification. \n\nTimor-Leste has scheduled flight services from Dili to \nAustralia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Demand for air services \nhas grown slowly, and the only route with sufficient demand \nto support daily flights by more than one airline is from Dili \nto Denpasar, on the Indonesian island of Bali (Figure 3.31.5). \nIn October 2018, competition on the Dili-Denpasar route \nceased after the Citilink airline acquired operational control \nof its rival Sriwijaya Air. Ticket prices rose immediately, and \nin January 2020 the cost per kilometer of flights between \nDili and Denpasar in Indonesia, was 2.7 times higher than \nthe equivalent cost for flights from Denpasar to Kupang in \nWest\u00a0Timor (Figure 3.31.6). \n\nThe government has committed to improving air \n\nconnectivity. It has completed a major upgrade of the airport in \nOe-Cusse Ambeno to support the development of that region\u2019s \nspecial economic zone. On the south coast, it has upgraded \nthe airport at Suai to support oil and gas developments nearby. \nThe\u00a0government also plans to upgrade the international \nairport at Dili by extending the runway, improving safety, and \ndeveloping a new terminal. These investments could help to \nattract new flight services by addressing important constraints \nsuch as flight loading restrictions but will not remove the need \nto consider changes to aviation policy. \n\nAs reducing flight costs is an immediate priority, the \ngovernment should assess whether any immediate regulatory \nchanges could reduce costs without compromising air safety \nor security. Encouraging competition on key routes such \nas Dili\u2013Denpasar is likely to be central to reducing costs. \nThe government should therefore consider embedding \nprocompetitive principles in its framework for licensing airline \noperators. With some observers proposing the establishment of \na national airline, the potential benefits and risks of this policy \nshould be weighed against alternative approaches such as the \nairline-underwriting model that has been used by some small \nisland states. \n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.31.5\u2002 Growth in air traffic\n\nCargo (kg), \nNumber of passengers\nNumber of \ufb02ights\n\nIndex, Q1 2013 = 100\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\n\nSource: Statistics Timor-Leste.\n\nFigure 3.31.6\u2002 Flight costs\n\nHigh\nLow\n\nCost per kilometer, US$ \n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nA = Bali to Kupang, B = Bali to other Indonesian\u00a0city, \nC\u00a0=\u00a0Bali to other international destinations in \nSoutheast\u00a0Asia, D = Dili to Bali, E = Dili to Darwin, \nF\u00a0=\u00a0Dili\u00a0to Singapore, G = Dili to Kupang.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from Google Flights \nas\u00a0of 13 January 2020.\n\n\fViet Nam\n\nThe  economy  remained  robust  in  2019,  with  expansion  underpinned  by  strong  domestic \ndemand,  resilient  manufacturing,  and  solid  foreign  direct  investment.  However,  growth  is \nforecast  to  decelerate  significantly  in  2020,  with  risks  to  the  downside  as  the  COVID-19 \npandemic  unfolds.  Inflation  eased  to  a  3-year  low  in  2019  but  it  is  projected  to  rise \nmoderately  in  2020  and  2021.  The  current  account  surplus  expanded  in  2019  but  will \ncontract  sharply  this  year.  Despite  the  economic  deceleration  and  the  downside  risks \nfrom  the  COVID-19,  the  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam  is  projected  to  remain  one  of  the \nhighest  in  the  region.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth recorded another stellar year, slipping only marginally \noff a record high of 7.1% in 2018 to 7.0% in 2019 (Figure \n3.32.1). On the supply side, solid growth in industry at 8.9%, \na rate sustained from 2018, and in services, improving from \n7.0% in 2018 to 7.3%, mostly offset a slowdown in agriculture. \nManufacturing expanded by 11.3%, mining rebounded from \n3.1% contraction in 2018 to grow by 1.3%, and construction \nsustained growth above 9%. Expansion in services was driven \nby tourism, banking and finance, wholesale services, and \ntransportation (Figure 3.32.2). Prolonged drought and African \nswine fever slowed growth in agriculture by nearly half, from \n3.8% in 2018 to 2.0%.\n\nOn the demand side, strong growth was led by a 7.4% rise \nin private consumption as higher incomes continued to expand \nthe middle class and inflation remained fairly stable. Public \nconsumption, meanwhile, slipped from 6.3% growth in 2018 to \n5.8% as fiscal consolidation continued.\n\nInvestment growth remained robust despite slowing \nfrom 8.2% in 2018 to 7.9%. Viet Nam attracted $38 billion in \nforeign investment, up by 7.2% over the previous year. Equity \ninvestment was $15.5 billion, 56% higher than in 2018. Inflows \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong, \nChina doubled in 2019. Disbursed foreign direct investment was, \nat $20.4 billion, 6.7% higher than in 2018 (Figure 3.32.3). These \nrobust inflows of foreign capital drove private investment as \nslow disbursement held back public investment.\n\nExports expanded to $263 billion, partly reflecting \n\ndiversion from the PRC to end run US tariffs.

The \nPRC continued to be the largest source of imports, with a 33% \nshare, followed by the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 19% and \nSoutheast Asia with 13%. \n\nInflation averaged at 2.8% in 2019, its lowest in 3 years, \nheld down by softening global fuel prices despite increases in \nadministered prices for electricity, health care, and education, \nas well as food prices pushed higher by drought and African \nswine fever (Figure 3.32.4). Strong economic fundamentals \nincluding robust foreign capital inflow supported the Viet Nam \ndong, the strength of which also tamed inflation.\n\nThe State Bank of Viet Nam, the central bank, pursued \nprudent monetary policy in 2019. Low and stable inflation \nallowed it to cut policy rates. In September 2019, it cut the \ndiscount and refinancing rates by 0.25% to support growth. \nThis first cut since July 2017 boosted market sentiment but not \nmarket liquidity, and credit growth remained under control at \nless than 14% (Figure 3.32.5). In November 2019, the central \nbank lowered interest rate caps on dong deposits of less than 6 \nmonths and on short-term dong lending to prioritized sectors. \nThe current account surplus expanded from the equivalent \n\nof 2.4% of GDP in 2018 to an estimated 5.0%, supported by a \nlarge trade surplus and stable remittances estimated at $9.3 \nbillion. Merchandise exports rose by 8%, led by a 10% increase \nfor mobile phones, electronics, and components, which comprise \n33% of exports. Merchandise imports grew by 7% to supply \nhigher production of computers, electronics, and parts\u2014and \nreflecting a 21% increase in oil imports.\n\nThe financial account surplus was estimated to equal 7.3% \n\nof GDP, boosted by large net inflows of both foreign direct \ninvestment and portfolio capital. With the current and financial \naccounts both in surplus, the overall balance of payments \namounted to a surplus estimated at 8.9% of GDP. \n\nThe stronger balance of payments enabled the central bank \nto build up international reserves, raising import coverage from \n2.7 months at the end of 2018 to 3.6 months a year later. The \ndong exchange rate against the US dollar remained stable in \n2019, but the dong appreciated by 2% against the PRC renminbi \n(Figure 3.32.6).  \n\nFiscal consolidation continued in 2019 (Figure 3.32.7). The \n\nbudget deficit narrowed from the equivalent of 3.7% of GDP \nin 2018 to an estimated 3.5%. Revenue growth rose from 5.0% \nin 2018 to 7.3%, notably from increased domestic excise tax \ncollection. Meanwhile, public expenditure growth was slashed \nfrom 15.3% in 2018 to 6.7%. Continued tightening of government \nloan guarantees combined with robust economic growth \ncontributed to further reduce the ratio of public and publicly \nguaranteed debt from a peak equal to 63.7% of GDP in 2016 to \nan estimated 54.8% in 2019. \n\n$ billion\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.32.3\u2002 Disbursement of foreign \n\ndirect investment \n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: General Statistical Office of Viet Nam. \n\nFigure 3.32.4\u2002 Inflation\n\n% change year on year \n\nyear-to-date average\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJan\n2019\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nSource: General Statistics Office of Viet Nam.\n\nFigure 3.32.5\u2002 Credit and money supply \n\ngrowth\n\nCredit\nMoney supply\n\n% change year on year\n\nJan\n2018\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nDec\n\nJan\n2019\n\nSources: State Bank of Viet Nam, General Statistic Office \nof Viet Nam; ADB estimate.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Southeast Asia \n\nViet Nam\u2002\u2002309\n\nThe resolution of nonperforming loans progressed but only \n\nFigure 3.32.6\u2002 Exchange rate\n\nCentral rate of the State Bank of Viet Nam\nUpper bound of the trading band\nLower bound of the trading band\nBlack market exchange rate\n\nslowly, their official percentage of all outstanding bank credit \nfalling to 1.9% by the end of 2019.

In Viet Nam itself, the number of COVID-19 \ninfections has continued to climb. The impact on Viet Nam could \ntherefore be severe, creating shocks to both supply and demand \nin almost every area of the economy. Growth decelerated to \n3.8% in the first quarter of 2020 from 6.8% in the corresponding \nperiod in 2019.\n\nOn the demand side, travel restrictions held down growth \nin domestic consumption in the first quarter of 2020. Growth in \nretail sales dropped to 4.7% in the first quarter of the year from \n12.0% in the same period last year. Inflow and disbursement of \nforeign direct investment have already slowed. In January and \nFebruary 2020, foreign investment registration shrank by 23.6% \nagainst a year earlier, while disbursement dropped by 5.0%. \nWith the sharp contraction in global trade, export growth is \ntherefore forecast to ease to 5.3% in 2020, and import growth \nto 4.7%, before exports recover to 7.8% growth in 2021 and \nimports to 6.8%.\n\nOn the supply side, export-oriented manufacturing managed \n\nto weather headwinds in January\u2013February with sufficient \ninventories of inputs, which prolonged supply chain disruption \nhas since exhausted. As manufacturing occupies a substantial \nshare of industry, sector expansion thus fell to 6.2% in February \n2020 from 9.2% a year earlier. The manufacturing purchasing \nmanagers\u2019 index, a leading indicator, fell from 50.6 in January \n2020 across the threshold at 50 into contractionary territory \nto 49.0 in February\u2014the first such drop in over 4 years (Figure \n3.32.9). Output fell at the fastest pace in over 6.5 years, while new \norders shrank for the first time since November 2015, partly a \nresult of lower export sales and decline of orders from economies \naffected by COVID-19.

Industry slowed to 5.1% in the first \nquarter of the year from 8.6% in the same period last year. An \nenterprise survey conducted in March by the National Advisory \nCouncil for Administrative Reform found 74% of surveyed firms \nexpecting to shut down operations temporarily if the outbreak is \nnot controlled by June 2020.\n\nequal to 0.2% of GDP this year, recovering to 1.0% surplus in \n2021. The financial account will also be hit by the outbreak. As of \n24 March 2020, the stock market index had plummeted by 31.4% \nsince the end of 2019. \n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak also harmed agriculture as the \nclosing in January of almost all land border crossings between \nthe PRC and Viet Nam froze agricultural exports. As the \noutbreak persists, demand for agricultural exports from Viet \nNam will continue to fall. Separately, agricultural production is \nsuffering severe salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta. Growth \nin agriculture dropped sharply to 0.08% in the first quarter of the \nyear from 2.7% in the same period last year. Agricultural growth \nis therefore seen to slow to 1.0% in 2020. \n\nServices have so far been the sector hardest hit by the \noutbreak. Considering its 42% share of GDP, a slowdown in \nservices will significantly dent growth. The largest impact is \nthrough lower tourism and associated services, which account \nfor 40% of sector revenue. In January\u2013February 2020, tourist \narrivals grew by only 4.8%, the lowest rate in these months \nin the past 5 years. In February, tourist arrivals fell by 37.7% \nfrom a month earlier and by 21.8% year on year. Arrivals from \nthe PRC, typically 30% of all foreign tourists, have ceased. As \nCOVID-19 spreads globally, the government has stopped issuing \nvisas and imposed temporary travel bans on tourist arrivals \nfrom all countries, sharply curtailing tourism. The International \nAir Transport Association estimates that the current extensive \nspread of the pandemic will cost Viet Nam 23% of its arriving \npassengers. Growth in services was halved to 3.2% in the first \nquarter of 2020 from 6.5% in the corresponding period in 2019. \nInflation in March dropped by 0.7% month-on-month, from \n0.2% decrease a year earlier. However, average inflation for first \nquarter of 2020 rose to 5.6%, the highest level in the same period \nduring 2016-2020, largely on higher health care and pork prices, \nthe latter of which triggered higher prices for substitute meats. \nIn the full year of 2020, inflation is expected to average at 3.3%, \nrising further to 3.5% in 2021 (Figure 3.32.10).

To support affected businesses, \nthe government unveiled on 4 March 2020 a $10.8 billion relief \npackage of debt restructuring and lowered and waived interest \nrates and fees. Subsequently, the central bank cut policy rates by \n0.5%\u20131.0%, lowered interest rate caps on dong deposits of less \nthan 6 months and on short-term dong lending to prioritized \nsectors, and instituted other measures. \n\nThe 3.4% fiscal deficit target for 2020 may now be hard to \nachieve, given reduced tax collection from incomes and export \nearnings, substantial increases in spending on health care and \nemployment funds, and a recently launched fiscal package worth \n$1.3 billion that reduces taxes and fees for affected firms and \ndefers tax payment. The fiscal deficit is therefore expected to \nwiden to the equivalent of 4.2% of GDP in 2020 before improving \nto 3.5% in 2021. \n\nDespite the potentially large impact of COVID-19, Viet Nam\u2019s \n\neconomic fundamentals remain resilient. If the outbreak is \ncontained within the first half of 2020, growth should rebound to \n6.8% in 2021 and remain strong over the medium and long term.\nDrivers of economic growth\u2014a growing middle-income \n\nclass and a dynamic private sector, notably household \nbusinesses and domestically held enterprises\u2014remain robust. \nThe middle class in Viet Nam is one of the fastest growing in \nSoutheast Asia. According to Boston Consulting Group, the \nmiddle class has doubled in size since 2014 to 33 million, or a \nthird of the population. \n\nThe business environment similarly continues to improve. \n\nThe disbursement of public investment has improved \nsignificantly, growing by nearly 18% in January\u2013February 2020 \nover the same period in 2019.

Its total trade is now \nvalued at twice its GDP, having swiftly emerged as a significant \nvalue chain hub in Southeast Asia for the manufacturing of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) hardware \n\n\fFigure 3.32.11\u2002 Net revenues of software \n\nindustry, digital content, and \nICT services \n\nSoftware industry\nDigital content\nICT-services\n\n$ billion\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nSource: Viet Nam\u2019s Ministry of Information and \nCommunications\n\n312(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nand electronics. In 2019, ICT and electronics exports were \nestimated at $91.0 billion, accounting for 34.4% of all goods \nexported. \n\nViet Nam had 38,861 ICT companies in 2018 and \n\ncurrently boasts 2,000\u20133,000 tech start-ups. Investment by \nlarge multinational companies and other foreign investors \nexplains much of this rapid growth, but local companies are \nalso growing quickly, notably in e-commerce and financial \ntechnology (fintech). For its part, the government has applied \nnew policies and regulations to encourage this development.\n\nThe growth of the digital economy provides new \n\nopportunities for knowledge-intensive employment. The net \nrevenue of firms offering software, digital content, and ICT \nservices increased from $7.7 billion in 2015 to $11.5 billion in \n2018 (Figure 3.32.11). Their combined contribution is 11.1% of \nnet revenue in the ICT industry, an important employer. The \nnumber of jobs in ICT manufacturing grew from 533,000 in \n2015 to 718,000 in 2018. In the same period, employment in the \nsoftware industry, digital content, and ICT services grew by \n36% to reach 255,000 jobs. \n\nViet Nam ranked 42 among 129 countries in the Global \nInnovation Index 2019, rubbing shoulders with top economies \nclassified as upper-middle income. This ranking reflected high \nICT exports and imports. Viet Nam has other advantages that \nshould enable it to move up in the index. It has strong primary \nand lower-secondary education, a young population, abundant \nlabor, and ample credit, with bank loans outstanding estimated \nto equal 135% of GDP in 2019. \n\nSome factors nevertheless hold back the national innovation \n\nsystem. First, gross domestic expenditure on research and \ndevelopment (R&D), both public and private, equaled only \n0.53% of GDP in 2017, far below 1.44% in Malaysia and 0.78% in \nThailand a year earlier, which clearly illustrates that Viet Nam \nneeds to step up its spending on R&D. Second, universities in \nViet Nam rank lower than in upper-middle-income countries \nin Southeast Asia in quality and quantity, as measured by \ngross enrollment ratio. Although Viet Nam compares favorably \nin the number of students in tertiary education overseas \nand has 55,000 students enrolled domestically each year in \ntertiary  ICT programs, these future graduate numbers may be \ninsufficient to meet growing demand from rapidly growing ICT \nindustries. Ensuring more and better fresh graduates is critical \nfor Viet Nam to leap ahead in technological innovation. Third, \nwhile the financial sector has grown steadily and innovative \nfintech is being adopted, the current legal framework has \nnot kept pace with the development of fintech products and \nservices. An enabling regulatory framework to nurture the \napplication of fintech would help Viet Nam to expand and \ndeepen its financial services. \n\n\fTHE PACIFIC\n\nFiji\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nVanuatu\n\nCentral Pacific economies\n\nNorth Pacific economies\n\nSouth Pacific economies\n\n\f\fFiji\n\nThe economy performed below trend in 2019 as trade partners stagnated, the government \nreined  in  spending,  and  business  confidence  dwindled,  initially  because  of  tight  liquidity \nearly  in  the  year.  Inflation  slowed  by  more  than  half.  Lower  imports  in  late  2019  and \nincreased  tourism  and  remittance  inflows  narrowed  the  current  account  deficit,  reversing \nprevious trends and allowing improved liquidity heading into 2020 and beyond. COVID-19 \nwill  significantly  hit  the  economy  as  tourist  arrivals  will  decline.\n\nEconomic performance\nAfter uninterrupted growth for the past 9 years, growth is \nestimated to have slowed from more than 3% in the previous \n2 years to only 0.7% in 2019 (Figure 3.33.1). Weaker economic \nactivity in major trade partners than in 2018 slowed growth in \nvisitor arrivals to 2.8%, the lowest since 2013 (Figure 3.33.2). \nGrowth in tourism earnings slowed from 4.5% in 2018 to 2.7%. \nIn the first half of 2019, the current account deficit expanded \nnotably as the primary income account saw significant outflow \nfrom profit and dividend repatriation. Foreign reserves and \ncommercial bank liquidity consequently fell, triggering rises in \ndeposit and lending rates. \n\nConstrained by its debt ceiling and less buoyant revenue \n\nstreams, the government announced a tighter budget for \nfiscal year 2019 (FY2019, ended 31 July 2019) than in FY2018. \nCollectively, these developments affected business confidence. \nA business survey conducted in June 2019 by the Reserve Bank \nof Fiji, the central bank, found that the number of respondents \nexpecting improved business conditions in the next 6 months \nhad dropped from 51% in December 2018 to 24%. Similarly, \npositive sentiments for the next 12 months slumped to 33% of \nrespondents, one of the lowest percentages in recent years. \n\nGrowth in private sector credit decelerated from 7.3% in 2018 \n\nto 4.6% in 2019. New lending by commercial banks declined. \nTax collections on goods and services slowed from 6.1% growth \nin 2018 to only 1.9%, while cement sales fell by 6.2%. New and \nsecond-hand vehicle registrations declined by more than 20%.  \n\nThe sugar industry improved, with cane production growth \n\naccelerating from 4.0% in 2018 to 6.5% in 2019, and sugar \nproduction reversing an 11.2% decline to grow by 5.3%.  \n\nThis chapter was written by Isoa Wainiqolo of the Pacific Subregional Office, \nADB, Suva.\n\nFigure 3.33.1\u2002 GDP growth\n\nAgriculture\nServices\nIndustry\nGross domestic product\n\n4.7 \n\n2.5 \n\n5.4 \n\n3.5 \n\n0.7 \n\n3.0 \n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n(4.9)\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.33.2\u2002 Visitor arrivals\n\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\nNorth America\n\nEurope\nAsia\n\nPaci\ufb01c islands\nOthers\n\nThousands\n\n%\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n900\n\n600\n\n300\n\n0\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nSource: Fiji Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\fThe current account deficit widened in the third quarter of \n\nFigure 3.33.3\u2002 Current account balance\n\n316(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe fiscal deficit narrowed from the equivalent of 4.4% \n\nof GDP in FY2018 to 3.4% as expenditure fell and revenue \nremained broadly stable. Public debt expanded as a ratio of \nGDP from 45.8% at the end of 2018 to 48.0% a year later. \n\n2019. Despite this, tourism receipts expanded by 2.7% year on \nyear, and personal remittances rose by 4.4% in the whole year, \nhelping to ease pressure on the external position. The current \naccount deficit equaled an estimated 4.2% of GDP in 2019 \n(Figure 3.33.3). \n\nIn response to weak demand, monetary policy remained \naccommodative throughout the year with the official policy \nrate maintained at 0.5%. Reserves coverage rose from 4.2 \nmonths of retained imports of goods and nonfactor services \nat the end of March 2019 to 5.1 months at the end of the \nyear. Annual inflation was down from 4.1% in 2018 to 1.8% \non account of benign imported inflation and weak domestic \ndemand, especially toward the end of the year.\n\nEconomic prospects\nThe economy is projected to decline by 4.9% in 2020 under \nCOVID-19. The impact is expected to extend to supply chains, \ngovernment revenue, and business and consumer confidence. \nThe government announced a supplementary budget in late \nMarch to support containment and provide relief for affected \nindustries and workers. The central bank reduced its policy rate \non 18 March to stimulate economic activity. However, stringent \ncontainment measures undertaken by Fiji\u2019s main tourist markets \nare likely to dampen economic activity in the first half of 2020. \nIf the pandemic is thus contained in its impact, the economy \nshould rebound by 3.0% in 2021, led by the private sector. \n\nTourism and air transport are expected to be the worst \nhit during this global downturn. On 20 March, Fiji Airways \nsuspended 95% of its international flights until the end of \nMay in response to travel restrictions and low demand. Other \nbusinesses that feed off tourism and transport, such as the \nwholesale and retail trade, will also struggle. \n\nInflation is expected to be low in 2020 at 1.5%, rising in \n2021 to 3.5% (Figure 3.33.4). Spare capacity vacated in 2019 \nwill likely persist into 2020, moderating expected international \nsupply disruption, with domestic inflationary pressure returning \ntoward the end of the year. Higher projected consumer prices \nin 2021 are in line with domestic growth, higher capacity \nutilization, and improved conditions in Fiji\u2019s major trade \npartners. \n\nThe external position is likely to take a hit in 2020 from \n\nlower tourism earnings, with the current account deficit \nprojected to equal 7.1% of GDP in 2020.

However, lower government revenue \nas the economy contracts and higher expenditure to counter \nCOVID-19 impacts are projected to widen the fiscal deficit to \nequal 4.2% of GDP in FY2020 and 3.5% in FY2021.  \n\nRisks to forecasts center on Fiji\u2019s worsening vulnerability \n\nto natural hazards and climate change, which could nullify \ndevelopment efforts, and on COVID-19 and its potential \ndamage to tourism. The contraction could be greater than \nforecast if travel bans in key tourist markets persist until the \nsecond half of the year .\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014strengthening domestic \ndrivers of growth\nThe government needs to strengthen and empower the private \nsector to innovate, diversify, and drive economic recovery after \nCOVID-19, while finding the right balance between investing \nin climate resilient infrastructure, limiting debt exposure, and \nbuilding fiscal buffers. \n\nTo start, Fiji needs to improve its business and investment \n\nclimate and encourage business innovation. Steps have been \ntaken in this direction. In December 2019, the government \nannounced business licensing reform with the aim of reducing \nmaximum licensing time to 2 days. It launched its bizFIJI portal \nin July 2019 to provide a centralized online platform for starting \na business and obtaining construction permits. The government\u2019s \nnew Research and Innovation Scheme for Enterprises initiative \nhas initial funding of F$500,000 to provide financial support \nto enterprises undertaking research and development in new \nor improved products, processes, or services. The central bank \nlaunched guidelines for a fintech regulatory sandbox, which \naims to encourage innovation in finance. \n\nThe success of these initiatives will be short lived, however, \n\nwithout other enablers for business growth. The Fiji National \nProductivity Masterplan, 2021\u20132036 noted that government \nprice controls on a wide range of goods reduces incentives \nfor producers to improve their quality or expand productive \ncapacity. The International Monetary Fund has advocated a \nreview of price controls. When new firms are able to operate \nin a stable regulatory environment, innovation and economies \nof scale are encouraged, costs reduced, and productivity \nenhanced. If not, new initiatives are unlikely to flourish, and \ngrowth will continue to depend on fiscal stimulus, casting \ndoubt on government debt sustainability. \n\nTable 3.33.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20024.1\n\n\u20138.9\n\n\u20020.7\n\n\u20021.8\n\n\u20134.2\n\n-4.9\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20137.1\n\n\u20023.0\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20133.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: Fiji Bureau of Statistics; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.33.5\u2002 Fiscal deficit\n\nFiscal de\ufb01cit\n\n% GDP\n\nPublic debt\n\n% GDP\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n55\n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Calendar year data for 2014; new \ufb01scal year (July-\nAugust) data for 2015 onward. 2020 and 2021 re\ufb02ects \npre-COVID-19 government forecasts.\nSource: Fiji Ministry of Economy.\n\n\fPapua New Guinea\n\nA  rebound  in  petroleum  and  mineral  production  supported  growth  and  widened  the  current \naccount surplus in 2019, but the economic picture deteriorated with the distraction of politics \nand the deferral of large investment projects. Inflation trended lower, yet an over-valued local \ncurrency and associated foreign exchange shortages continued to hold back economic activity. \nAs the fiscal balance worsens, the government faces important challenges in managing public \ndebt,  including  arrears,  contingent  liabilities,  and  state-owned  enterprise  debt.\n\nFigure 3.34.1\u2002 GDP growth \n\nMining & petroleum\nNon-mining\n\nGross domestic product\n\n9.5\n\n%\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n4.1\n\n3.5\n\n4.8\n\n-0.8\n\n%\n\n12\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n2.8\n\n0.8\n\nForecast\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nSource: ADB estimates using data from Papua New \nGuinea National Statistical Office.\n\nEconomic performance\nGrowth in 2019 was driven by a rebound in extractive \nindustries following an earthquake in 2018 (Figure 3.34.1). \nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) bounced back to grow by about \n16% in 2019, and crude oil production also jumped. Mining and \nquarrying, which provide some 10% of GDP, also rebounded, \nnotably on account of increased production at the Porgera gold \nmine and, to a lesser extent, the Ok Tedi gold and copper mine. \nThe Lihir gold mine, which was not affected by the earthquake, \nsaw volumes fall. Combined, these three mines contribute most \nmining production. Capital expenditure at a number of mining \nsites, including advanced exploration works, also stimulated \ngrowth. Meanwhile, though, a legal dispute caused advanced \nworks to be scaled down at the Wafi Golpu site in 2019. \n\nGrowth apart from minerals was weak. The resignation \n\nin May of the Prime Minister, who was facing a vote of no \nconfidence, prompted a complete change in the coalition \ngovernment and leadership. This caused some loss of economic \nmomentum, with people distracted by politics and the altered \ngovernment taking time to become established. While the \neconomic policy of the new leadership does not significantly \ndiffer from that of the old, there are some important \ndifferences, in particular new priorities on reforming state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) and increasing domestic ownership \nof mining and petroleum assets. In accordance with the second \nof these goals, the new leadership sought to renegotiate two \nnew LNG investment projects, Papua LNG and the PNG LNG \nexpansion project in the P\u2019nyang gas field. Together, these two \nprojects are set to drive the economy with projected capital \nexpenditure of over $10 billion.

Power outages were a frequent occurrence as \nwell, further affecting business conditions. Government \ncashflow remained tight during most of the year, delaying \npayments to contractors and the private sector. Government \nrevenue collection from companies in 2019 was lower than \nin 2018, confirming a subdued business environment. The \nemployment index to September 2019 registered a small decline \nin the number of jobs in the formal sector, with declines \nin construction, transport, and financial services. Private \nsector credit growth was 6.1% in the year to December 2019, \nimplying some growth in banks\u2019 loan books, but this was not \nsignificantly above inflation.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fisheries continued to expand, by \n\nan estimated 2.5% in 2019. However, the production of export \ncrops including palm oil, coffee, and cocoa probably declined \nslightly from 2018. \n\nConstruction is estimated to have declined. With the \ngovernment\u2019s tight cashflow situation during 2019, many \nprojects could not be delivered as envisaged. Weak performance \nin construction was highlighted by the construction \nemployment index, which registered a 7% decline in the number \nof jobs from December 2018 to September 2019.\n\nAverage annual inflation dropped to an estimated 3.6% in \n\n2019, reflecting slow growth and a strict policy maintained \nby the Bank of Papua New Guinea, the central bank, to limit \nits purchases of government securities (Figure 3.34.2). System \nliquidity contracted further as the central bank bought local \ncurrency with the proceeds of external loans. The inflationary \nimpact from exchange rate movement was negligible, as the \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) kina depreciated by only about 1% \nagainst the US dollar and appreciated against the Australian \ndollar by 2.7%. Communications and health care were two \nsectors that saw prices fall in 2019. \n\nThe central bank responded to falling inflation by reducing \n\nthe kina facility rate during the year from 6.25% to 5.00% \n(Figure 3.34.3). However, this policy instrument remains \nlargely ineffective for stimulating the economy for lack of \ntransmission to commercial bank lending rates. This is because \nbanks can source cheap deposits and enjoy wide lending \nspreads.\n\nThe current account posted a significant surplus again, \ndriven higher by increased LNG and gold exports, as well as a \nrising gold price (Figure 3.34.4).\n\nThe weak economy caused government finances to \n\ndeteriorate in 2019 as revenue trended lower and expenditure \n\n%\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n%\n\n6.5\n\n6.0\n\n5.5\n\n5.0\n\n4.5\n\n4.0\n\nFigure 3.34.2\u2002 Inflation  \n\n6.7\n\n6.0\n\n5.4\n\n4.7\n\n3.6\n\n4.4\n\n3.3\n\n2020 2021\nForecast\n\n2015 2016 2017\n\n2018 2019\n\nSources: Papua New Guinea National Statistical Office \n(2014-2018); ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.34.3\u2002Kina facility rate  \n\n6.25\n\n5.50\n\n5.00\n\nJan Mar May\n2019\n\nJul\n\nSep Nov\n\nJan Mar\n2020\n\nSource: Bank of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\f320(cid:141)(cid:141)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\ncontrol was poor (Figure 3.34.5).

Expenditure maintained its upward trend, however, \nreaching K16,526 million, equal to 19.5% of GDP. The public \nsector wage bill trended higher as new hires in health care \nand education continued. The resultant deficit, equal to 4.1% \nof GDP, was a significant departure from an earlier fiscal \nconsolidation strategy. Multilateral and bilateral development \npartners were the main sources of deficit financing, through \nbudget support loans.\n\nEconomic prospects\nIn the absence of major new investments in extractive industry \ncommencing in the short term, growth will remain lackluster. \nNegotiations are expected to revive on the Wafi Goplu gold \nand copper mine, but progress will depend on reaching \nsatisfactory agreements on the share of ownership and profits. \nThe project has a capital investment value of about $3 billion, \nwith production expected to begin 5 years after the start of \ninvestment.

However, \nmedia reported in February 2020 that some buyers there were \nunable to take delivery of international gas purchases and \nclaiming force majeure. \n\nOil production may expand slightly in 2020 as some \noilfields return to normal production following the 2018 \nearthquake. However, output will likely fall thereafter in line \nwith an overall declining trend in oil production as oilfields \nmature. In 2020, exploration and capital investment in the \noil industry will likely scale down in response to lower oil \nprices. Meanwhile, gold and copper production is expected to \nexpand, though some mining operations could suffer setbacks \nas COVID-19 crimps supply chains and staff movement to and \nfrom mine sites. The Ok Tedi gold and copper mine and the \nLihir gold mine are both expected to increase production in \n2020 and 2021 thanks to recent and ongoing capital investment. \nGold production is also forecast to expand at medium-sized \nmining operations, including the Hidden Valley and Kainantu \nmines. \n\nApart from extractive industries, growth is forecast to \nremain weak in 2020.

Other structural \nbottlenecks\u2014such as weak law and order, poor governance, \nand the limited availability of titled land for investment\u2014\nare not expected to improve. COVID-19 is expected to have \nwide impact in 2020, with manufacturing struggling under \ndisruption to supply chains; transportation, accommodation, \nand food services hit by restricted international travel by air \nand sea; and wholesale and retail trade hampered if imports \nof goods from the PRC and elsewhere are delayed. The public \nsector may also be affected if weaker commodity prices reduce \nrevenue and force budget cuts. PNG reported no COVID-19 \ncases to mid-March, but if the virus reaches PNG and expands \nthere, growth would be slowed beyond current projections. \nGovernment capital expenditure is budgeted to grow by \n18.8% in 2020, which could provide some stimulus, especially \nfor construction (Figure 3.34.6). However, realizing such \nexpenditure may prove difficult as the 2020 budget depends on \nsecuring significant external financing, not all of which is yet \ncertain. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, infrastructure \nprojects being built by contractors from the PRC were slowed \nor suspended in response to COVID-19. \n\nAgriculture is forecast to expand in 2020. New palm oil \nplantations may start to bear fruit within the forecast period, \nand new cocoa plantations should also begin to produce. \nHowever, COVID-19 could dent production as overseas \ndemand weakens. Meanwhile, the government has increased \nits production tax on log exports from 30% to 50%, which is \nexpected to push log production lower. In any case, demand for \nlogs is another victim of COVID-19, with some ports in the PRC \nexperiencing inventory buildup and unable to take delivery. \nInflation is forecast to maintain its downward trend in \nthe short term as the economy outside of extractive industries \nremains weak. Communication costs, which have a weighting \nof 4.5% in the consumer price index, may fall further with \nthe installation of a new fiberoptic cable to connect PNG to \nAustralia and bring faster and cheaper internet. Inflation \nis seen to rise in 2021 in line with an anticipated recovery \nin economic growth, but could pick up much faster if the \nauthorities adopt a policy of kina depreciation. Limited \ndomestic appetite for purchasing government treasuries may \nincrease pressure on the central bank to finance domestic \nsecurities, which could further add to inflationary pressures, \nbut any such financing is not expected to be significant in light \nof the central bank\u2019s own strict approach.\n\nThe current account will continue to post significant \nsurpluses, though will decline in 2020 with a lower oil price. \nLNG exports should remain steady, though could decline in \n2020 with falling global demand. About 90% of gas is sold \nunder long-term contracts linked to the oil price, and only 10% \n\n\f322(cid:141)(cid:141)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\non the spot market. Gold exports should expand with increased \nproduction, especially if the gold price stays elevated. Imports \nare not expected to pick up significantly, though they could \nincrease to supply the Wafi Golpu project if it proceeds. A \nloosening of the exchange rate may not significantly reduce \nimports, which have already fallen under foreign currency \nrationing. \n\nThe new government is planning to pursue an expansionary \n\nfiscal policy in 2020, targeting a budget deficit equal to 5.0% \nof GDP. This deficit will have to be financed almost entirely \nexternally for lack of domestic financing sources. The recent \nfall in oil and copper prices will lower government revenue, \nprobably requiring a supplementary budget with expenditure \ncuts.  \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014debt management \nCentral government debt at the end of 2019 stood at K32,535 \nmillion, equal to 38.1% of GDP. It had increased from \nK29,759 million, or 36.2% of GDP, in 2018 mainly through \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d budget support loans from multilateral \ncreditors and drawdowns from the proceeds of the \ngovernment\u2019s inaugural 10-year sovereign bond, which was \nissued toward the end of 2018. The share of external debt in \ntotal government debt increased from 39% at the end of 2018 \nto 43% a year later (Figure 3.34.7). This was consistent with \nthe government\u2019s medium-term debt strategy for 2018\u20132022 \nto lower domestic interest costs and restructure its domestic \ndebt portfolio with a view to reducing refinancing risk from \ndomestic sources (Figure 3.34.8).\n\nThe government faces important challenges in managing \n\nits public debt related to arrears, contingent liabilities, the \ndebts of SOEs, and the risks entailed in rolling over external \ncommercial loans and domestic borrowings. Regarding \narrears, during the last quarter of 2019, the government said \nit discovered relatively large amounts of public sector arrears \nin the form of unpaid bills, mainly wages, allowances, and \nunpaid invoices for its purchase of goods and services. The \nchallenge has been and continues to be how to find, verify, \nand measure the whole of these arrears, currently estimated \nto be K2,623 million in 2019, or 14% of total domestic debt last \nyear. An equally daunting challenge is to manage the fiscal \nimpact of these arrears and efficiently pay them down. In its \n2020 budget, the government committed itself to a substantial \npaydown of arrears, adding K1,050 million to its 2020 budget \ndeficit. The plan is to pay down the balance of arrears in the \nnext two budget cycles. \n\nRegarding the SOE debt situation, neither the Treasury \nnor any other department is actively monitoring them, leaving \nexact amounts unknown.

Last year the Treasury estimated these \nliabilities to be K14,134 million, with 91% of them being \nguarantees extended to external creditors. In the past, \nthe servicing of both principal and interest costs of some \nguaranteed loans has become a burden on the government \nbudget. With the absence of any procedures to manage risk, \nsuch risks can only get worse, and indeed these contingent \ncommitments may haunt the budget this year and next. \nFollowing an October 2019 amendment to the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act that raised the permissible ratio of debt to \nGDP to 45%, there is room to include some of these guaranteed \ndebts in the government\u2019s reporting of public debt. This would \nenhance transparency in government reporting and go some \nway toward allaying concern about how complete debt data \nare, which could eventually improve the government\u2019s credit \nrating. The government has now acknowledged this deficiency \nand plans to include elements of the debt that were previously \nunreported. Technical assistance in progress to help the \ngovernment manage its debt management will provide support \nin these areas.\n\n\fSolomon Islands\n\nGrowth  slowed  last  year  as  exports  and  public  investment  fell.  Inflation  eased,  and \nthe  current  account  deficit  widened.  Growth  is  expected  to  weaken  significantly  as \nconstruction  only  partly  offsets  a  decline  in  logging,  which  will  deepen  under  COVID-\n19,  intensifying  fiscal  pressure.  As  the  growth  contribution  from  logging  shrinks  over  the \nlonger  term,  reforming  the  tax  system  becomes  critically  important  to  ensure  that  it \nsupports  broad-based  growth  in  other  areas.\n\nEconomic performance\nEconomic growth is estimated to have slowed sharply from 3.9% \nin 2018 to 2.6% in 2019, mainly from reduced logging and weaker \nconstruction. From a peak in 2018, log output fell by 4% in 2019 \n(Figure 3.35.1). Major crops such as palm oil, copra, and coconut oil \nwere also down from the previous year. Growth in the fish catch \nslowed from 27% in 2018 to 8% in 2019. Weakness or contraction in \nagriculture had follow-on effects on services and manufacturing, \nwhich includes the processing of logs, fish, and other food.  \n\nIndustry subtracted from growth in 2019 as construction \nslowed. Growth in electricity consumption slowed as well, while \nimports of machinery and transport equipment dropped by 20% \nand mining exports contracted by almost 10%. \n\nServices, which contribute 60% of GDP, are dominated \n\nby wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and public \nadministration. Weakening trade caused growth in revenue from \nconsumption taxes, comprising goods and sales tax and import \nduties, to slow sharply from an average of 14.1% in 2017 and 2018 to \nonly 1.6% in 2019. \n\nGrowth in public administration slowed with a decline in \ngovernment expenditure following constraint early in the year. \nAfter a general election and the formation of a new government in \nApril, spending increased but was still down for the whole year by \nan estimated 2.9% (Figure 3.35.2). Total revenue and grants fell by \n9.0%, largely because lower log exports reduced revenue derived \nfrom duties. The fiscal deficit was estimated to equal 2.0% of GDP.\nInflation pressures eased as economic conditions became less \n\nfavorable and global commodity prices softened. Lower prices \nfor food and household items more than offset higher prices for \nutilities, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco.

Growth in private sector credit slowed in line \nwith a weaker economy. \n\nThe current account deficit widened to the equivalent of 8.5% \nof GDP in 2019 (Figure 3.35.3). Exports of goods fell, dragged down \nby lower exports of logs, agricultural products, fish, and minerals, \nwhile lower service exports tracked visitor arrivals. Imports of \ngoods rose despite lower imports of fuel and of machinery and \ntransport equipment. Imports of services jumped on higher \npayments for telecommunication and construction services \nincurred to complete the Coral Sea Cable for internet connection. \nGross official foreign reserves were 5% lower in December than a \nyear earlier but sufficient to cover 11.8 months of imports.\n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic growth is expected to slow again in 2020, as exports \nfall under COVID-19, before recovering in 2021 as construction on \nlarge infrastructure projects offsets a continuing decline in logging \n(Figure 3.35.4). Trade and travel disruption caused by COVID-19 \nis expected to delay construction on some infrastructure projects \nthat rely on imports and foreign labor, contracting industry. Public \nadministration services will remain the main contributor to \ngrowth. Expenditure on health care and COVID-19 preparedness \nare expected to expand.\n\nweaken in 2020. Logging output routinely surprises on the upside, \nbut gradual reduction seen in 2019 will likely deepen in 2020 with \nreduced demand from the People\u2019s Republic of China, the main \nmarket. As logging supplies more than two-thirds of exports, this \nwill weigh heavily on growth and have follow-on effects in other \nareas, including manufacturing, transport, and trade.  \n\nOnce the disruptions pass, construction in 2021 should \n\nstrengthen on a significant project pipeline including roads, \nwater supply and sanitation upgrades, airport rehabilitation, and \npreparations for the Tina River hydroelectricity project and the \n2023 Pacific Games. The Coral Sea Cable will improve internet \nconnectivity and create opportunities for business and government \ne-services.   \n\nWhile the 2020 budget targets a balanced budget, fiscal \npressures will intensify with higher government spending, \nparticularly on health care in response to COVID-19, combined \nwith lower revenue in line with economic weakening. The original \nbudget assumed revenue falling by 6.7% from the 2019 revised \nbudget because of reduced grants, export duties tracking lower \nlog exports, and tax collection following a doubling of the tax-free \nthreshold for personal income in January. \n\nExternal debt has risen in recent years with increased lending \n\nfrom development partners to finance large infrastructure \nprojects. It was estimated to equal 7.8% of GDP in 2019. \n\nFigure 3.35.3\u2002 Current account balance \n\nMerchandise exports\nMerchandise imports\nServices balance\nPrimary income \nbalance\nSecondary income \nbalance\n\n% of GDP\n\n% of GDP\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n-16\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Central Bank \nof Solomon Islands and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFigure 3.35.4\u2002 Supply-side contributions  \nto growth \n\nAgriculture\nIndustry\nServices\nGross domestic product\n\n3.4 \n\n2.6 \n\n3.7 \n\n3.9 \n\n2.6 \n\n2.7 \n\n1.5 \n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nEstimate\n\nForecast\n\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury, Solomon Islands National Statistics \nOffice, and International Monetary Fund.\n\nTable 3.35.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20023.9 \u2002\u20022.6 \u2002\u20021.5 \u2002\u20022.7\n\nInflation\n\n\u2002\u20023.5 \u2002\u20021.6 \u2002\u20022.0 \u2002\u20022.3\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\n\u2002\u20133.5 \u2002\u20138.5 \u2002\u20138.7 \u201312.3\n\nSources: Ministry of Finance and Treasury, Solomon \nIslands National Statistics Office; International \nMonetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\nAgriculture, logging, and fisheries\u2014a third of GDP\u2014will \n\nPercentage points \n\n\f326(cid:1)(cid:1)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInflation is expected to accelerate slightly in both 2020 and \n2021 (Figure 3.35.5).

Domestic food price inflation is set to accelerate \nwith higher import duties and goods taxes on white rice, intended \nto promote brown rice, and the expected implementation of higher \ntaxes and import duties on sugar, salt, and sugary drinks. Extended \nCOVID-19 constraint on trade could drive inflation higher. The \ncentral bank adopted an expansionary monetary policy stance in \nMarch given the subdued economic outlook.\n\nThe current account deficit is expected to widen, especially in \n2021 as log exports decline and imports rise to supply construction. \n\n%\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-6\n\nSignificant downside risk stems from COVID-19, mainly \nthrough reduced demand for Solomon Islands merchandise \nexports. A global economic slowdown sharper than currently \nassumed would severely undermine log exports and growth, \nintensifying pressure on the budget and current account.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014reforming consumption \ntaxes\nAbout 40% of domestic revenue comes from consumption \ntaxes, including a goods tax, a sales tax, and import duties. \nAs a percentage of GDP, revenue from consumption taxes \npeaked at 13.3% in 2012 and has remained below 12% since \n2015 (Figure 3.35.6). A narrow base necessitates a high tax rate. \nThis discourages compliance and creates incentives for smaller \nbusinesses to avoid formal registration and multiple taxes on their \ninputs and outputs.  \n\nThe government has agreed to introduce a value-added tax \n(VAT), which over time will replace various consumption taxes. \nWhile this change is intended to be revenue neutral, it can \ngenerate revenue more efficiently, equitably, and transparently. To \nthis end, the new VAT will need to be carefully designed, not least \nin its choice of tax base and rate structure. \n\nIt will be important to ensure adequate funding for and \n\ncapacity in the Inland Revenue Division and the Customs \nDivision of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. At the same \ntime, a continued focus on recovering tax arrears and improving \ncompliance is needed to sustain the fiscal position. Sequencing \nreforms while strengthening revenue administration and using \nappropriate technology solutions will help to address some of the \nchallenges. \n\nVAT has been introduced in several Pacific countries and has \nproved to be a stable revenue source. Any expansion of the tax base \ncan permit lower effective tax rates, and the resulting lower input \nprices can improve the business environment. Reform success \ncrucially depends on engaging the private sector and considering \nthe administrative costs that tax changes may entail. \n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n-50\n\nFigure 3.35.5\u2002Inflation\n\nOverall\nFood\nTransport\nHousing & utilities\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: A new consumer basket was introduced in 2018. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from Solomon Islands \nNational Statistics Office and the Central Bank of \nSolomon Islands.\n\nFigure 3.35.6\u2002Government revenue\n\nDomestic revenue\nGrants\nCurrent expenditure\nDevelopment spending\n\n% of GDP\n\nOverall balance\n\n% of GDP\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-5\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nEstimate\n\nNote: A new consumer basket was introduced in 2018. \nSource: ADB estimates using data from Solomon Islands \nNational Statistics Office and the Central Bank of \nSolomon Islands.\n\n\fVanuatu\n\nEconomic  growth  was  sustained  in  2019  with  public  administration  offsetting  slowdowns \nin  construction  and  tourism.  Inflation  was  little  changed  but  is  forecast  to  dip  briefly  in \n2020,  when  the  current  account  will  likely  fall  into  deficit.  The  economy  is  forecast  to \ncontract  in  2020  as  travel  restrictions  arising  from  COVID-19  undermine  tourism,  which \nshould  recover  in  2021.  As  more  workers  access  labor  mobility  schemes,  policies  must \nensure  that  benefits  are  broadly  enjoyed  and  sustainable.\n\nEconomic performance\nStrong growth in public administration, financed by higher \nspending, helped to sustain economic growth in 2019 despite \nweakness in other sectors. Setting aside kava, agriculture \nproduction declined by more than 10%. Low international \nprices and a rhinoceros beetle infestation caused copra output \nto drop. \n\nWhile tourist arrivals by air reached their highest ever \n\nin 2019, tourism growth decelerated from 6% in 2018 to 4%. \nAustralia and New Zealand, which supply more than 60% \nof air arrivals, sent fewer than in 2014, before Cyclone Pam \n(Figure 3.36.1). Arrivals on cruise ships, which contribute less \nto tourism earnings than air arrivals because of their short stay \nand onboard amenities, plummeted by almost half.\n\nConstruction slowed as government capital expenditure \n\nfell along with imports of cement and of machinery and \ntransport equipment as several infrastructure projects reached \ncompletion. \n\nRecurrent public expenditure jumped from a 3% increase \nin 2018 to almost 15% growth in 2019 on increases for goods \nand services, and for the public wage bill. This was financed \nmainly by higher revenue from honorary citizenship programs \nand value-added tax. Established to mobilize resources for \nreconstruction following Cyclone Pam, honorary citizenship \nprovided about a third of revenue in 2019, or more than value-\nadded tax (Figure 3.36.2). \n\nWith expenditure growth outpacing revenue, the fiscal \n\nsurplus narrowed slightly to equal 6.7% of GDP. Some of \nthe budget surplus was used to repay debt, including early \nrepayment. Despite this, loan drawdowns drove external debt \nup to the equivalent of 39.5% of GDP in 2019.

Increases in the export value of cocoa, beef, \nand especially kava were insufficient to offset large drops for \ncopra and coconut oil (Figure 3.36.3). \n\nEconomic prospects\nEconomic contraction is forecast in 2020 as tourism declines \nsteeply before recovering in 2021 (Figure 3.36.4). Public \nadministration growth will accelerate with increased spending, \nin particular on health care and COVID-19 preparedness. \nHowever, growth in agriculture and industry are expected to \ndecelerate in 2020 and 2021. \n\nTravel restrictions to contain COVID-19 and the global \neconomic slowdown will significantly reduce inbound tourism, \nincluding from Australia and New Zealand, the largest source \nmarkets. Further, last year\u2019s decline in arrivals aboard cruise \nships is expected to continue as current COVID-19 restrictions \nprevent cruise ships from docking. \n\nAgriculture is expected to remain weak as rhinoceros \nbeetle continues to damage copra production. Meanwhile, \nindustry is expected to slow as trade and travel disruption \nstemming from COVID-19 hamper construction on some \ninfrastructure projects that rely on imports and foreign labor. \nGovernment spending, which slowed in the first quarter of \n\n2020 as a caretaker period preceded parliamentary elections \nheld in March, is set to accelerate. The government projects \na fiscal deficit equal to 4.6% of GDP with higher current and \ncapital spending (Figure 3.36.5). The budget assumes that \n\u201cother revenues,\u201d mainly from honorary citizenship programs, \nwill be lower than in 2019. About 15% of domestic revenue is \nallocated to debt repayment, 45% of that for repaying external \ndebt ahead of schedule. \n\nInflation is expected to slow in 2020 in line with economic \n\nweakening and softer global prices for fuel and other \ncommodities, before rising in 2021 (Figure 3.36.6). If domestic \nand foreign trade are constrained by COVID-19, inflation may \nbe driven higher. The current account balance is expected to \nfall into deficit in 2020 with lower tourism receipts.

Uncertainty stems from the duration and severity \nof travel restrictions affecting tourism, a key generator \nof employment, income, and foreign exchange. Extended \ndisruption to travel and trade would mean sharper economic \ncontraction. These put significant pressure on the current \naccount as tourism receipts fall, and deteriorate the fiscal \nposition, though this may be offset by increased grants. \n\nPolicy challenge\u2014maximizing benefits \nfrom seasonal worker schemes\nIn 2018, Vanuatu contributed 40% of workers in Australia\u2019s \nSeasonal Worker Program and New Zealand\u2019s Recognized \nSeasonal Employer scheme (Figure 3.36.7). The country has \nsuccessfully leveraged its early participation, and employers\u2019 \npreference to hire return workers, to become one of the biggest \nsenders to both programs. \n\nTo contain COVID-19, the Government of Vanuatu \nsuspended new workers\u2019 participation in both schemes in \nMarch 2020, even as job prospects in tourism weaken in \nVanuatu. When travel restrictions ease, however, Vanuatu is \nlikely to continue participating in both programs.\n\nLabor mobility has enabled Vanuatu workers to earn higher \nincomes overseas while broadening their skills and experiences. \nRemittances, though much smaller than tourism and other \nexport receipts, have grown significantly. The challenge is to \nmaximize the development benefits labor mobility can offer to \nindividuals, communities, and the economy of Vanuatu. \nVanuatu has lower financial penetration than do Fiji, \n\nSamoa, or Tonga, in terms of both ownership of bank accounts \nand access to formal credit. The cost of sending remittances \nis high, constraining people\u2019s ability to channel their earnings \ninto savings and investments. In addition, workers often \nstruggle to access the superannuation they accumulate overseas \nor are unable to transfer it to their local retirement accounts. \n\nRecognizing these challenges, the government developed a \n\nfinancial inclusion strategy for 2018\u20132023. In 2019, the National \nFinancial Inclusion Council launched digital financial products \nand services, including mobile money services for remittances. \nImproving financial literacy also promises to help seasonal \nworkers use their earnings and experiences to build a more \nsustainable future when they return.\n\nTable 3.36.1\u2002 Selected economic \n\nindicators (%)\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n\u20022.8\n\n\u20022.3\n\n\u20023.5\n\n\u20022.8\n\n\u20022.4\n\n\u20022.7\n\n\u20131.0\n\n\u20021.5\n\n\u20138.7\n\n\u20022.5\n\n\u20022.0\n\n\u20138.6\n\nGDP growth\n\nInflation\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSources: National Statistics Office; International \nMonetary Fund; ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.36.6\u2002 Inflation\n\nHeadline\nTransport\nAlcohol & tobacco\nFood & beverage\nHousing utilities\n\n%\n\n8\n\n4\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSources: Vanuatu National Statistics Office; ADB \nestimates.\n\nFigure 3.36.7\u2002 Vanuatu seasonal workers, \nby destination\n\n% of all seasonal workers\nin Australia\n% of all seasonal workers\nin New Zealand\n\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\n\nThousand workers\n\n%\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2008\n\n2011\n\n2014\n\n2017 2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: Australian Department of Home Affairs; \nImmigration New Zealand. \n\n\fCentral Pacific economies\n\nPerformance  varied  in  2019.  Growth  slowed  in  Nauru  and  Tuvalu  but  quickened  in \nKiribati.  Inflation  accelerated  in  Nauru  and  Tuvalu,  while  Kiribati  fell  into  deflation.  Fiscal \nbalances  deteriorated  in  both  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu.  Growth  is  expected  to  slow  in  all  three \neconomies  in  2020  before  recovering  in  2021.  Weak  fiscal  frameworks  and  reliance  on \nexternal  revenue  make  sustainable  trust  funds  vital  to  a  secure  future,  especially  under \nrecent  financial  market  volatility.\n\nFigure 3.37.1\u2002 GDP growth\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati budget documents; Nauru budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu budget documents; Asian Development \nOutlook database; International Monetary Fund Article \nIV Reports. \n\nFigure 3.37.2\u2002 Fishing license revenue\n\nEconomic performance\nThe Central Pacific economies are Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu, \npreviously referred to in ADO as small island economies. None \ndepends heavily on tourism, which may enable them to escape \nthe worst direct impacts of COVID-19.\n\nIn Kiribati, the economy improved slightly over 2018 to \ngrow by 2.4% in 2019 (Figure 3.37.1). The improvement came \nlargely from government spending on wages and subsidies, \nwhich reversed a fiscal surplus equal to 27.2% of GDP in 2018 \nto a deficit of 8.0%. The deficit also reflected less budgetary \nsupport from development partners. Lower prices for food, \nbeverages, and tobacco brought 1.8% deflation in 2019, and the \ncurrent account surplus narrowed from the equivalent of 13.4% \nof GDP in 2018 to 7.6% as imports expanded.\n\nGrowth in Nauru slowed to 1.0% in fiscal year 2019 \n(FY2019, ended 30 June 2019) as phosphate output fell and \nactivity slowed at the Regional Processing Centre (RPC) for \nasylum seekers. Recent national account estimates suggest that \ngrowth in FY2018 was significantly higher than previously \nestimated. The fiscal surplus narrowed to equal 16.0% of GDP \nin FY2019 despite a 44.8% increase in fishing license revenue \nand higher revenue derived from the RPC (Figure 3.37.2). \nInflation jumped from 0.5% in FY2018 to 3.9% on higher \nalcohol and tobacco tariffs and with shipping disrupted in the \nport mooring system.\n\nTuvalu nearly matched 2018 growth with 4.1% expansion \n\nin 2019, aided by increased capital spending connected with \nthe Pacific Islands Forum meeting in August. Higher spending \nand a steep decline in fishing receipts spelled a fiscal deficit \nequal to 9.8% of GDP in 2019, reversing a 34.2% surplus in 2018 \n\nThis chapter was written by Lily Anne Homasi and Isoa Wainiqolo of the \nPacific Subregional Office, ADB, Suva; Jacqueline Renee Connell of the \nPacific Liaison and Coordination Office, ADB, Sydney; and Prince Cruz and \nNoel Del Castillo, consultants, Pacific Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati budget documents; Nauru budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu budget documents; Asian Development \nOutlook database; International Monetary Fund Article \nIV Reports. \n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nCentral Pacific economies\u2002\u2002331\n\nFigure 3.37.3\u2002 Fiscal balance\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\n% of GDP\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Kiribati budget documents; Nauru budget \ndocuments; Tuvalu budget documents; Asian Development \nOutlook database; International Monetary Fund Article \nIV Reports.\n\nFigure 3.37.4\u2002Current account balance\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; \nInternational Monetary Fund Article IV Reports.\n\n(Figure 3.37.3). Inflation at 3.3% in 2019 reflected new taxes on \nalcohol and tobacco, as well as demand pressures heightened \nby infrastructure investment. The current account reversed a \nsurplus equal to 4.8% of GDP in 2018 with a deficit estimated \nat 6.9%, mainly from higher imports and lower fishing revenue \n(Figure 3.37.4).\n\nEconomic prospects\nKiribati will likely see growth decelerate to 1.6% in 2020 \nbefore recovering to 1.8% in 2021. The economy is expected to \nbe sluggish in the first half of 2020 because the government \nwas unable to get approval for the 2020 budget with general \nelections coming in April 2020. COVID-19 restrictions will also \nbe a drag on construction activities. Construction on the South \nTarawa Water Supply Project, Outer Islands Infrastructure \nProject, and South Tarawa Renewable Energy Project should \nsupport growth in 2021, assuming construction contractors can \nresume activities.\n\nThe fiscal deficit is projected to narrow in 2020 to equal \n\n0.8% of GDP because of delayed budget approval but then \nwiden to 4.2% of GDP in 2021, driven by the high cost of \ninfrastructure projects and of operating subsidies for newly \npurchased aircraft for Air Kiribati. The current account surplus \nis expected to narrow to 4.0% in 2020 as fishing revenue \nstabilizes and imports expand (Figure 3.39.4). It is forecast \nto narrow further in 2021 as domestic demand rises, driven \nby large infrastructure projects and related consumption \nspending. \n\nGrowth in Nauru is forecast to slow to 0.4% in FY2020 \nand recover to 1.1% in FY2021. This forecast assumes that RPC \nactivity continues to moderate and that phosphate exports \nremain weak, while construction on a new seaport provides \nfollow-on benefits to local services. Travel and trade disruption \nstemming from COVID-19 will drag on growth in the second \nhalf of FY2020. A downside risk to the outlook would be \nextended travel restrictions that delay infrastructure projects. \nThe fiscal surplus is expected to grow to the equivalent \nof 22.7% of GDP in 2020. Although spending is budgeted to \nremain elevated, revenue from fishing license fees and the RPC \nis projected to increase. The surplus will finance contributions \nto the national trust fund, a cash buffer, and arrears reduction. \nWith RPC revenues uncertain, fiscal discipline will be critical \nin FY2021.\n\nTuvalu can expect growth to be affected by Tropical \nCyclone Tino, which struck in January 2020. Rehabilitation \nlargely financed by contingent budget support from multilateral \norganizations should, joined by a renewable energy project \nin the latter half of 2020, provide some stimulus, but growth \n\n\f332(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nFigure 3.37.5\u2002Inflation\n\nKiribati\nNauru\nTuvalu\n\nis still projected lower at 2.7% in 2020 and 3.2% in 2021. \nCOVID-19 is likely to drag on construction growth.\n\nThe government is projecting a lower fiscal deficit in 2020, \nequal to 4.3% of GDP. Expenditure is expected to be 5.1% lower \nthan the outturn in 2019, and revenue 1.5% lower. Expenditure \nis forecast to fall further by 0.6% in 2021 as revenue grows by \n4.8%, leaving a surplus equal to 2.5% of GDP. Current account \nsurpluses equal to 2.8% of GDP in 2020 and 3.4% in 2021 are \nforecast in light of a stable outlook for fishing revenue and a \ntrade balance projected to improve as capital imports ebb to a \npre-2018 level.  \n\nInflation in Nauru is forecast to decelerate in line with \nsubdued global fuel prices in 2020 and 2021, but domestic price \npressures are seen to result in a reversal of previous deflation \nin Kiribati and a slight acceleration in Tuvalu. (Figure 3.37.5). \nA risk to the inflation outlook is possibly higher transport costs \nand supply disruption caused by COVID-19.\n\n%\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014ensuring the \nsustainability of public trust funds\n\nIf well managed, public trust funds can support the financial \nneeds of developing countries. This is particularly useful in the \nPacific, where narrow economic bases typically pose long-term \nfiscal risk. Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu each has a sovereign \nwealth fund designed to provide long-term fiscal sustainability \n(Figure 3.37.6). With rising expenditure and heavy dependence \non foreign sources of revenue, these economies use trust \nfunds as fiscal buffers and their returns on investment as \nsupplementary sources of financing. However, currently weak \nfiscal frameworks can tempt governments to draw down trust \nfunds for short-term needs. \n\nWhile investment returns have been broadly favorable in \nrecent years, COVID-19 is expected to make them less so as \nglobal financial conditions tighten further. This could threaten \ntrust fund sustainability over the longer term, rendering all \nthree economies more vulnerable.\n\nKiribati established its Revenue Equalization Reserve \nFund in 1956, funding it with phosphate mining revenue to \nsmooth income from this volatile source and prepare against \nits inevitable depletion. Since 2012, most funding comes from \nwindfall fishing license fees. In December 2019, the fund \nwas worth $1.14 billion, but COVID-19 effects on financial \nmarkets drove down its nominal value in February 2020 \nby $27 million, or 2.3%. Meanwhile, considering Kiribati at \nelevated risk of debt distress, continued high spending or a \nfishery decline could force more frequent withdrawals from \nthe fund to finance fiscal deficits. The government may want \nto consider setting clear guidelines on fund use that balance \n\n2015\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019\n\n2020 2021\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nin Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year in Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.\nSources: Asian Development Outlook database; \nInternational Monetary Fund Article IV Reports.\n\nFigure 3.37.6\u2002Trust fund balances\n\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n\n% of GDP\n\n450\n\n300\n\n150\n\n0\n\nKiribati \n\nNauru\n\nTuvalu\n\nNotes: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year \nfor Nauru and coinciding with the calendar year for Kiribati \nand Tuvalu.

Its objective is to \naccumulate sufficient principal value to generate a revenue \nstream for future budget financing, replacing less sustainable \nsources. Since fund establishment, windfalls from fishing \nlicense fees and the RPC have flowed in as domestic revenue, \nabout 10% of which has usually been put into the fund. \nHowever, Nauru\u2019s economy is vulnerable to fiscal shocks, most \nimmediately a scaling-down of the RPC that could severely \ncurtail revenue. Improving expenditure management and \nprioritizing critical expenditure would help ensure continued \ngovernment contributions to the fund even if revenue falls \nover time, thereby securing the fund\u2019s longevity and ability to \nsustain future generations.\n\nThe Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) is a sovereign wealth \nfund established in 1987 through an international agreement \nwith Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and \ndesigned to ensure long-term financial viability. Proceeds \nlend the government financial autonomy in the management \nof its budget. Recent market movements threaten to reduce \nTTF transfers to the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), \nfrom which the government can draw fiscal support, speeding \nCIF depletion in the medium term. Faster fiscal consolidation \nwould maintain buffers in the CIF and alleviate uncertainty \nregarding TTF transfers. Higher taxation is an option \nworth considering to lessen short-term reliance on the TTF. \nEnsuring TTF sustainability may require the government to \nadopt a strategic intergeneration policy that provides a broad \nframework for pursuing long-term TTF objectives and ensuring \nits role in support of national development objectives.\n\n\fNorth Pacific economies\n\nMuch  higher  growth  last  year  in  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  was  fueled  largely \nby  strong  construction  funded  by  development  partners,  as  was  slightly  higher  growth \nin  the  Marshall  Islands.  Meanwhile,  Palau  returned  to  contraction  as  visitor  arrivals  fell \nfor  various  reasons.  Economic  performance  is  seen  to  weaken  in  all  three  economies  this \nfiscal year from COVID-19 impacts, with cautious recovery anticipated next year. Over the \nlonger  term,  pension  fund  reform  is  critical  to  contain  fiscal  risks.\n\nFigure 3.38.1\u2002 GDP growth in the North \n\nPacific economies\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\nMarshall Islands\nPalau\n\n% \n\n12\n\n6\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018 2019\n\n2020 2021\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of \nthat year.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and \nRepublic of Palau FY2018 Economic Briefs.\n\nEconomic performance\nFortunes diverged in the North Pacific in fiscal year 2019 \n(FY2019, ended 30 September 2019) with acceleration in the \nFederated States of Micronesia (FSM), stable growth in the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, and contraction in Palau \n(Figure 3.38.1). \n\nThe FSM saw growth recover on increased public \n\ninvestment and private sector activity following severe flooding \nin FY2018. The implementation of projects supported by \nmultilateral development partners in energy and information \nand communications technology boosted capital spending and \noffset lingering management issues that hobble infrastructure \nprojects funded through the Compact of Free Association \nwith the US. Economic activity was buoyed as well by public \nspending ahead of national elections in March 2019, after \nwhich greater policy certainty bolstered business sentiment. \nFSM fishing license revenues remained high at over $70 \n\nmillion for a third consecutive year, equaling 17% of GDP \n(Figure 3.38.2). Further, corporate income tax collection from \nforeign insurance and investment companies domiciled in the \nFSM remained elevated at over $50 million thanks to another \nlarge payment. The continued strong performance of these \nrevenue sources allowed another substantial deposit into the \nFSM Trust Fund, which at the end of FY2019 stood at $267 \nmillion, including $43 million contributed during the year and \n$12 million in investment returns.\n\nIn the Marshall Islands, growth increased only slightly \n\nin FY2019 on higher construction, fishing, and public \nadministration. Several health and sanitation projects were \nfast-tracked in response to a dengue outbreak in June, \ncontributing to growth in construction and related services. \n\nThis chapter was written by Rommel Rabanal of the Pacific Department, ADB, \nManila; and Prince Cruz, consultant, Pacific Department, ADB, Manila.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002335\n\nOther projects are to support education and sports and to build \nsea walls in Ebeye and Majuro to enhance climate change \nresilience. \n\nAfter several years of sputtering growth, agriculture \n\nexpanded for a third consecutive year. The fish catch \nrebounded from a slowdown in FY2018, and this was reflected \nin double-digit growth in exports to Japan and Taipei,China. \nCopra production was also up, by 18%.\n\nHigher grants and nontax revenues, mainly fishing license \n\nand ship registry fees, financed debt servicing, trust fund \ncontributions, and higher current expenditure on health \ncare, public administration, and subsidies to state-owned \nenterprises. A fiscal surplus, which rose from the equivalent \nof 2.5% of GDP in FY2018 to 3.0% in FY2019, was needed \nto finance higher debt servicing and to finally deliver on a \ncommitment to contribute $3 million to the state trust fund. \nGovernment debt has fallen from the equivalent of 70% of GDP \nin FY2009 to 35% in FY2018 (Figure 3.38.3)\n\nIn Palau, economic recovery in FY2018 proved to be short-\n\nlived as GDP contracted again in FY2019 in tandem with \ntourism. Visitor arrivals dropped by 22.6% in FY2019, with all \nmajor markets falling except Taipei,China. \n\nArrivals from the PRC; Hong Kong, China; and Macau, \n\nChina fell by almost half\u2014reflecting policies aiming to limit \ntravel to Palau and disruption from political unrest in Hong \nKong, China\u2014but this combined market remained the biggest, \nproviding a third of all arrivals (Figure 3.38.4). Japan, which \nwas the largest market until FY2014, remained the second \nbiggest at 22%, despite a decline of almost 20%. Arrivals \nfrom Taipei,China rose by 23.9% in FY2019, on top of a 19.6% \nincrease in FY2018.\n\nContinued contraction in tourism took its toll on the labor \n\nmarket. For the first time in a decade, employment fell in \nFY2019, mainly in hotels and restaurants, transportation, and \nretail trade. \n\nEconomic contraction would have been worse if not for \n\ninfrastructure projects funded by development partners, \nincluding under Palau\u2019s Compact of Free Association with the \nUS. These included a rural housing project, sanitation projects \nto build a sewer in Koror-Airai and a landfill in Babeldaob, and \ntransport projects to expand and upgrade the international \nairport in Airai, construct road connections in Babeldaob, and \nrenovate the port in Angaur.\n\nThe fiscal surplus narrowed sharply as revenue fell, \nmainly with a decline in arrival tax receipts, while current \nexpenditure increased. A portion of increased capital spending \nwas matched by increased grants, mainly from the US and \nTaipei,China.  \n\nInflation eased in all three economies in FY2019 as prices \n\nfor imported food and fuel declined.

Palau, however, is expected to contract \nagain in FY2020 before recovering in FY2021. Although all \nthree North Pacific economies have restricted flights because \nof COVID-19, the impact will be strongest in tourist-dependent \nPalau.\n\nIn the FSM, GDP growth is projected to slow in FY2020 \nwith the waning of election-related stimulus and construction \ndelays affecting ongoing projects (Figure 3.38.5). The start of \nnew capital projects supported by multilateral development \npartners\u2014including renewable energy investments in Kosrae \nand Yap and a maritime project to upgrade infrastructure \nand improve the safety and efficiency of ports in all four FSM \nstates\u2014will now also be largely pushed back, supporting higher \ngrowth in FY2021 as construction ramps up. \n\nA further upside to the FY2021 growth forecast is the \npotential resolution of project management issues, which \nwould unlock $200 million in unspent Compact infrastructure \ngrants. The government appears optimistic that the FSM and \nthe US will agree soon on an arrangement\u2014a strong incentive \nbeing the expiration of economic provisions under the current \nCompact in 2023. \n\nIn the Marshall Islands, economic growth is likely to \ndecelerate in FY2020 as travel and transport restrictions \ncaused by COVID-19 depress growth, notably in construction, \nagriculture and fishing, and trade. The continuing dengue \nepidemic will, along with measles, influenza, and COVID-19, \nfurther strain the public health system. Growth is seen to \nrebound in FY2021 as most restrictions are gradually eased.\nHigher current expenditure, financed by grants, would \n\nallow Marshall Islands to further fast-track projects such as \nwater supply and sewerage systems and health-care facilities \n(Figure 3.38.6). Although capital expenditure in the FY2020 \nbudget is 70% higher than a year earlier, resources are likely to \nbe diverted to health care. \n\nWith dengue cases falling at the start of the fiscal year, \n\ntravel restrictions were eased during the holiday season. \nReported dengue cases started rising again in January, \noverwhelming the country\u2019s two hospitals. A measles \noutbreak in other Pacific countries raised an alarm to boost \nimmunization. \n\nFigure 3.38.5\u2002 Supply-side contributions to \n\ngrowth in the FSM\n\nAgriculture\nServices\nIndustry\nGross domestic product\n\nPercentage points\n\n4.6\n\n2.7\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n1.6\n\n0.9\n\n0.2\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the Federated \nStates of Micronesia FY2018 Economic Review.\n\nFigure 3.38.6\u2002 Grants and current \nexpenditures in the \nMarshall\u00a0Islands\n\nCurrent expenditure\nGrants\nNontax revenues\nTaxes\nCapital expenditure\n\n% of GDP\n\n2015-2018\naverage\n\n2019-2020\nbudget\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of \nthat year.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands Economic Reviews (various years) and \nFY2019-2020 national budget.\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\n0\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nNorth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002337\n\nOverstretched fiscal resources in the Marshall Islands \nare further strained by a continuing need to service debt. \nDevelopment partners are helping to restructure old loans to \nbring down debt-servicing costs from the equivalent of 3.3% of \nGDP in FY2020. \n\nIn Palau, economic contraction is expected to continue \n\nin FY2020 with visitor arrivals falling further because of \nCOVID-19. Charter flights from the PRC were suspended in \nJanuary, while flights from other countries were discontinued \nor significantly reduced in March. Preliminary figures indicate \na 44% drop in visitor arrivals in February. \n\nPalau\u2019s economy is expected to recover in FY2021 as travel \n\nrestrictions are gradually lifted. Construction is expected to \ncontract, however, as some projects reach completion. Visitors \nfrom Japan are expected to increase with the resumption \nof twice-weekly direct Skymark charter flights, launched in \nFebruary. Skymark was set to start scheduled flights by July \n2020, but this was deferred due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nArrivals from other major markets are also expected to \nincrease with the completion of airport terminal rehabilitation \nin the second half of FY2020, though this may also be delayed. \nThe renovation should improve services, expand passenger \ncapacity, and increase revenue from concessionaires. \n\nIn response to COVID-19, Palau added $900,000 to the \n\nHospital Trust Fund and released $6.0 million from the \nemergency fund, to cover anticipated revenue shortfall. Despite \nthe increase in spending, Palau is projected to maintain fiscal \nbalance to the forecast horizon (Figure 3.38.7). Spending on \npublic wages, transfers to the pension fund, and subsidies to \nstate-owned enterprises will likely be maintained. As some \ninfrastructure projects are financed by loans, rising debt-\nservicing costs may require lower current expenditure in \nFY2021. \n\nInflation in the North Pacific is likely to remain low in \n\nFY2020, with declines in the international price of crude \noil offset by slight increases in food prices (Figure 3.38.8). \nIn\u00a0FY2021, low oil prices are seen to contain fuel and transport \ncosts, but steady increases in imported food prices are forecast \nto lift consumer price inflation marginally.\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014pension fund reform\nSignificant progress has been made in expanding social \nprotection in the Pacific. This has often been funded by \npension funds, however, which poses threats to their \nsustainability. \n\nThe FSM and Marshall Islands social security \n\nadministrations cover formal employees in both the public \nand the private sector, while Palau\u2019s Civil Service Pension \nPlan (CSPP) covers public employees and its Social Security \n\nTable 3.38.1\u2002 Selected economic  \n\nindicators (%)\n\nFederated States \nof Micronesia\n\n2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20020.2 \u2002\u20023.0 \u2002\u20021.6 \u2002\u20023.0\n\nInflation\n\n\u2002\u20021.4 \u2002\u20021.0 \u2002\u20020.5 \u2002\u20021.0\n\n\u200221.0 \u2002\u20023.3 \u2002\u20028.8 \u2002\u20021.3\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nMarshall Islands\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20023.6 \u2002\u20023.8 \u2002\u20022.5 \u2002\u20023.7\n\nInflation\n\n\u2002\u20020.8 \u2002\u20020.1 \u2002\u20020.3 \u2002\u20020.5\n\n\u2002\u20026.5 \u2002\u20027.7 \u2002\u20026.1 \u2002\u20025.1\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nPalau\n\nGDP growth\n\n\u2002\u20021.5 \u2002\u20133.1 \u2002\u20134.5 \u2002\u20021.2\n\nInflation\n\n\u2002\u20022.0 \u2002\u20020.6 \u2002\u20020.4 \u2002\u20020.8\n\n\u2002\u20139.5 \u201311.8 \u201313.5 \u201313.3\n\nCurrent acct. bal.  \n(share of GDP)\n\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nFigure 3.38.7\u2002 Fiscal surpluses in North \n\nPacific economies\n\nMarshall Islands\nFederated States of Micronesia\nPalau\n\n%\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 September of \nthat year.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and \nRepublic of Palau FY2018 Economic Briefs.\n\n\f338(cid:3)(cid:3)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nRetirement Fund (SSRF) covers private workers. The latest \nactuarial assessments show these pension funds having built \nup substantial unfunded liabilities as benefit payments have \nhistorically outstripped contributions. Unfunded liabilities are \nthe most severe in the Marshall Islands, but the funded ratio is \nlowest for Palau\u2019s CSPP (Figure 3.38.9).\n\nSocial security administrations have implemented various \nmeasures toward improving fund sustainability: raising ceilings \nfor taxable earnings, gradually increasing the retirement age, \nraising contribution rates, and cutting benefit entitlements. \nThe FSM and Palau\u2019s SSRF were the first to implement reform, \nin 2013, and have achieved some immediate gains. Unfunded \nliabilities in the FSM fell from $259 million in 2014 to $235 \nmillion in 2017, with a corresponding increase in the funded \nratio from 16% to 18%. Thanks to reform, Palau\u2019s SSRF has \nboth the lowest unfunded liabilities, at $177 million, and the \nhighest funded ratio, at 34%.  After some years of delay, the \nMarshall Islands implemented similar reform in 2017, fending \noff an imminent collapse of its fund, which is now deemed able \nto remain afloat beyond 2030. \n\nHowever, reform for Palau\u2019s CSPP remains stalled, \nand the recommendations of a 2018 actuarial study largely \nunimplemented. An audit of FY2018 concluded that the CSPP \ncould be drained as early as FY2022, making immediate \nreform of paramount importance. The 2018 actuarial study \nrecommended a balanced approach to increase contribution \nrates without sudden cuts in benefits, which can be achieved \nby introducing a defined contribution scheme to complement \nthe current defined benefit plan and gradually close the gap \nbetween contributions and benefits.\n\nOther North Pacific social security administrations can \nconsider phasing in similar defined contribution schemes to \nshore up their pension funds. More broadly, reinvigorating \nemployment growth\u2014which has been slow or stagnant in \nthe North Pacific over the past 2 decades\u2014will be critical to \npension fund sustainability over the longer-term. Strengthened \nprivate sector development and the steady creation of formal \nemployment can accelerate contributions to catch up with \nbenefit payments to retirees.\n\n%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.38.8\u2002 Inflation in the North Pacific \n\neconomies\n\nMarshall Islands in\ufb02ation\nFederated States of \nMicronesia in\ufb02ation\nPalau in\ufb02ation\n\nBrent crude price\n\n$ per barrel\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\nForecast\n\nNote: Years are \ufb01scal years ending on 30 June of that year.\nSources: ADB estimates using data from the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and \nRepublic of Palau FY2018 Economic Briefs.\n\nFigure 3.38.9\u2002 Unfunded liabilities of North \nPacific pension funds, latest \navailable year\n\nUnfunded liabilities\n(ratio to 2019 GDP)\nFunded ratio\n\nUnfunded liabilities\n\n$ million\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n-40\n\n-80\n\n%\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nMISSA\n(2014)\n\nFSMSSA\n(2017)\n\nSSRF\n(2015)\n\nCSPP\n(2018)\n\nCSPP = Civil Service Pension Plan [of Palau], FSMSSA \n= Federated States of Micronesia Social Security \nAdministration, MISSA = Marshall Islands Social Security \nAdministration, SSRF = Social Security Retirement Fund \n[of Palau].\nSources: ADB estimates using data from the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, \nand Republic of Palau FY2018 Economic Briefs; and latest \navailable pension fund actuarial reports.\n\n\fSouth Pacific economies\n\nTonga  recovered  from  a  cyclone  in  2019  as  growth  rebounded  in  Samoa  and  stayed \nstrong in the Cook Islands.

Government spending on infrastructure projects \nfell by 20% in FY2019 as implementation was delayed, but \nconstruction elsewhere continued to support growth. While \narrivals rose by only 1.2% from FY2018, tourism receipts and \ndomestic demand for tourism retail services continued to \nperform well, contributing 4.1 percentage points to GDP growth \n(Figure 3.39.2).\n\nInflation picked up from 0.1% in FY2018 to an estimated \n0.8%. High demand for imports to support tourism drove price \nincreases for food, apparel, alcohol, and tobacco.\n\nThe fiscal surplus expanded from the equivalent of 1.4% of \nGDP in FY2018 to an estimated 3.4% in FY2019 as revenue rose \nand government spending on infrastructure projects declined, \nmainly because of delayed implementation. Net debt at the end \nof June 2019 equaled 17.3% of GDP, below the government target \nof 30%.\n\nThe current account remained in surplus equal to 3.6% \nof GDP in FY2019 as growth in tourism receipts continued to \noutpace increases in imports of goods and services for domestic \nconsumption and public infrastructure projects.\n\nSamoa rebounded to 3.5% growth in FY2019 with large \ngains in general commerce and smaller contributions from \nconstruction, food and beverage manufacturing, hotels, and \nrestaurants. Visitor arrivals had another strong year, growing \nby 9.3%. Business services and the \u201cother services\u201d category \ndeclined, as did fishing.\n\nThis chapter was written by James Webb and Lily Anne Homasi of the Pacific \nSubregional Office, ADB, Suva; Rommel Rabanal of the Pacific Department, \nADB, Manila; and Noel Del Castillo, consultant, Pacific Department, ADB, \nManila.\n\n\f340(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nInflation decelerated to 2.2% with lower imported inflation \n\nand despite higher pressure on prices from local sources, \nparticularly food, nonalcoholic beverages, and, to a lesser extent, \ntransport. Alcohol and tobacco made significant contributions, \nwhile most other price categories were flat.\n\nThe fiscal surplus expanded substantially to the equivalent \nof 2.7% of GDP in FY2019 on strong revenue growth and capital \nexpenditure below expectations (Figure 3.39.3). Year-end \nexternal debt fell from the equivalent of 52.0% in FY2018 to \n46.9% in FY2019, bringing it below the debt target of 50% as \nGDP grew and Samoa paid down existing debt. The current \naccount surplus expanded from the equivalent of 0.8% of GDP \nin FY2018 to 2.3%, thanks largely to higher visitor arrivals and \ncontinued strength in remittances. \n\nTonga continued to focus on rehabilitation and recovery \nfrom Cyclone Gita. With delays affecting the rollout of major \nconstruction projects, however, gradual recovery to 3.0% growth \nin FY2019 drew support from stronger consumption supported \nby credit expansion. Fishing and agriculture were both weak, but \ntourism continued to post strong growth.\n\nInflation slowed from 7.0% in FY2018 to 4.1% as declines \nin commodity prices more than offset increased demand tied \nto government construction projects (Figure 3.39.4). The fiscal \nsurplus narrowed from the equivalent of 3.2% of GDP in FY2018 \nto 2.7% in FY2019 as growth in expenditure outpaced revenue. \nExternal debt fell from 37.7% of GDP in FY2018 to 34.1% in \nFY2019, well below the external debt target of 50%. \n\nThe current account posted a deficit equal to 6.8% of \nGDP in FY2019. While remittance inflow increased by 6.7%, \nthe merchandise trade deficit widened by 15.7% with higher \npayments for such imported goods as oil, motor vehicles, \nconstruction materials, and general goods for wholesale and \nretail trade. \n\nEconomic prospects\nThe Cook Islands economy is expected to be severely affected by \na collapse in tourist arrivals from March 2020, with economic \nactivity projected to contract by 2.2% in FY2020.

A 3.1% fiscal \ndeficit is projected for FY2021 as tax revenue collapses, especially \ncompany and value-added tax. Debt is expected  to remain \nbelow the government benchmark, at about 17.5% in FY2020 \nand FY2021, but it could increase if the government borrows \nto support additional response measures. The current account \ndeficit is projected to equal 1.2% of GDP in FY2020, reflecting \nboth higher imports and lower tourism receipts. Expected \ntourism recovery in the second half of FY2021 should leave a 1.1% \nsurplus in the current account that year.\n\nSamoa saw visitor arrivals and economic activity boosted \nby the Pacific Games in July, but the economy is expected to \ncontract by 3.0% in FY2020 from the combined effects of measles \nand COVID-19 on tourism from the second quarter of FY2020. \nFY2021 will be similarly affected, with GDP expected to grow \nby only 0.8% as tourism recovers only slowly but with positive \ncontributions from communications and agriculture.\n\nInflation is expected to slow to 2.0% in FY2020 as oil price \n\ndeclines mitigate local price pressures and disrupted supply. \nRecovery in local demand and from supply disruption are \nprojected to accelerate inflation to 2.5% in FY2021.\n\nGovernment finances are expected to fall into deficit equal to \n\n5.0% of GDP in FY2020 as revenue from commerce and tourism \ndeclines and response measures are enacted. The fiscal deficit is \nprojected to narrow to 3.5% in FY2021 with slow recovery. \n\nThe current account surplus will likely slip to deficit equal to \n1.1% of GDP in FY2020 as reduced tourism more than offsets any \nreduction in domestic demand. Remittances fell toward the end \nof 2019 but are expected to recover in the remainder of FY2020 \nand offset some losses. The current account is expected to return \nto surplus in FY2021, at 0.5% of GDP, as visitor arrivals recover \n(Figure 3.39.5).\n\nIn Tonga, a significant decline in visitor arrivals will allow \nno economic growth in FY2020. However, tourism recovery and \nfaster government implementation of rehabilitation and recovery \nfrom Cyclone Gita will provide vital support in FY2021, with the \neconomy projected to rebound with 2.5% growth.\n\nInflation is forecast lower in FY2020, then rising slightly \n\nin FY2021. A gradual rollout of infrastructure projects and \nanticipated disruption to regional supply in FY2021 will put \nupward pressure on prices despite lower global oil prices.\n\nThe fiscal surplus in FY2019 will likely turn to a deficit equal \n\nto 3.8% of GDP in FY2020 as revenue falls and expenditure \nrises, but the deficit is expected to narrow to 1.5% in FY2021 \nwith revenue recovery. Higher imports of capital goods and \nconstruction materials, combined with falling tourism and \nremittance receipts, will likely widen the current account deficit \nin FY2020 and FY2021, despite steady exports of food products to \nAustralia and New Zealand.\n\n\f342(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nBox 3.39.1\u2002Introducing Niue, the newest member of ADB\n\nOn 11 March 2019, Niue officially became the 68th \nmember country of ADB. With a population of only \n1,700 and a land area of 259 square kilometers, Niue \nis one of the smallest countries in the world. Access \nto basic services is relatively high in Niue, and so \nis gross national income per capita, at $16,500 in \n2016. However, Niue has outsized vulnerabilities and \ndevelopment challenges stemming from its very narrow \neconomic base, cost structures elevated by extreme \nremoteness, and disaster risks. \n\nAs in other South Pacific economies, tourism is a \nmain driver of economic growth, with some 10,000 \nvisitor arrivals annually and tourism receipts equal \nto about a third of annual GDP. Visitor arrivals have \nincreased by fivefold since 2005, boosted by improved \nflight connections, investment in accommodation, and \na coordinated marketing campaign. New Zealand is the \nmain source market, providing up to 80% of arrivals. \nA small agriculture sector produces honey and \nnoni juice, but exports are constrained by extreme \ndistance from major markets and limited transport \ninfrastructure. Niue is 2,800 kilometers from \nNew\u00a0Zealand and 5,800 kilometers from Australia, \nthe\u00a0two primary export destinations.\n\nOn the demand side, the public sector provides \n42% of GDP and directly employs a quarter of the \npopulation. Public spending is supported by large and \nstable annual inflows of official development assistance \nequal to three-quarters of GDP. The bulk of this \nassistance is received as an independent state in free \nassociation with New Zealand. \n\nAs with most of its Pacific peers, Niue is also \nexposed to natural hazards, particularly cyclones. \nThe\u00a0most severe cyclone in its history, Cyclone Heta \nin 2004, wrought widespread damage valued at five \n\ntimes national GDP. Most recently, Cyclone Tino \nin January\u00a02020 damaged Alofi wharf, leaving the \ncountry\u2019s only maritime transportation hub temporarily \nout of commission and disrupting fishing and business \nactivity for several weeks. \n\nGDP growth averaged 4.0% in 2013\u20132017 on solid \nexpansion in tourism (box figure). Growth accelerated \nto 6.5% in 2018 when government expenditure ramped \nup to resume the implementation of development \npartner-supported capital projects after some years \nof stagnation. Reflecting robust economic activity, \ninflation rose sharply in 2018, especially for alcoholic \nbeverages and transportation. Fiscal stimulus has \nremained substantial despite easing slightly in 2019. \nGDP growth is estimated to have slowed consequently \nin 2019, with some moderation in visitor arrival \ngrowth cited as a contributing factor. The outlook for \n2020 and 2021 will continue to depend heavily on the \nperformance of Niue\u2019s tourism industry and the pace of \ninfrastructure construction.\n\nNiue economic indicators\n\nGDP growth\nIn\ufb02ation\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n%\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n% of GDP\n32\n\n24\n\n16\n\n8\n\n0\n\n-8\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n\nSource: Statistics Niue.\n\n\fEconomic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific \n\nSouth Pacific economies\u2002\u2002343\n\nPolicy challenge\u2014addressing challenges \nto\u00a0urbanization\nA notable feature of South Pacific development is greater \nconcentration of economic activity and population in central \nareas. Migration and concentrated development have strained \nurban infrastructure and public services. They render recent \neconomic gains fragile, especially as climate risks mount and, \nif unaddressed, pose challenges to future economic growth \nand social equity. Formulating appropriate responses is now \nespecially important to support long-term economic recovery \nfrom COVID-19.\n\nAcross the board, there has been a dramatic shift from rural \n\nareas to urban centers. The population of the Samoan capital \nApia and its surrounding administrative areas has increased by \n41% over the past 3 decades, greatly outpacing 15% growth in \nthe rest of the country. Similarly, the population on Tongatapu, \nTonga\u2019s main island, has increased by 17% as other islands \nsuffered a 16% decline, and the population of Rarotonga, the \nlargest of the Cook Islands, has increased by 16%, compared \nwith a 44% decline elsewhere. The economies of these countries \nhave similarly become increasingly dominated by capital \nislands, with the service sector, which exists predominantly in \nurban areas, contributing in the past 10 years 64% of growth \nin the Cook Islands, 41% in Tonga, and 100% in Samoa (as \ngrowth and contraction in smaller sectors net out). While this \nhas improved incomes for increasingly urban populations, it has \nalso put economies at greater risk to natural hazards, with a \nlarge portion of economic activity now concentrated along the \nwaterfront in Apia and Nuku\u2019alofa, and tourist developments \ncrowded around Muri lagoon in Rarotonga.\n\nMany of these areas have developed with little or no urban \nplanning. This has commonly made it difficult and expensive to \ninstall adequate support infrastructure. Poor maintenance has \nraised costs further, with many critical utilities now requiring \nwholesale replacement to meet public demand for services. \n\nWhile institutional changes are making progress toward \nbetter planning and management, gaps in infrastructure and \npublic service delivery jeopardize the already fragile economic \ngrowth enjoyed by South Pacific economies in recent years. \nRegular flooding in the Apia urban area limits investment \nand imposes a cost burden on businesses. Sanitation issues in \nRarotonga risk spoiling the pristine beaches and lagoons that \nhave driven tourism growth. And Nuku\u2019alofa faces an extreme \nrisk of inundation under even modest sea-level rise. Economic \nlosses and opportunity costs may be substantial if these \ninfrastructure gaps go unaddressed. Fiscal resources will be \nneeded to ensure that investment goes ahead, but this priority \ncompetes with others in national budgets, including education, \nhealth care, and public administration.\n\n\f344(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\n\nThe most cost-effective approach would be to focus on \nensuring better maintenance and timely repair. One way to do \nthis is to develop infrastructure and maintenance frameworks \nto guide resourcing and sequencing efforts. It is widely shown \nthat early intervention to sustain current infrastructure is far \ncheaper than replacing irreparably damaged infrastructure \nonce it fails. Improved maintenance would reduce the cost \nof ensuring that existing infrastructure delivers the required \nservices, as well as mean less service disruption. \n\nWith a large pipeline of investment already under \nway, a focus on preemptive maintenance would limit the \nmaintenance overhang built up in the past, limiting the risk \nthat infrastructure cannot be maintained without significant \nrefurbishment. While this would avoid the capital cost \nof replacing current infrastructure stock, prudent fiscal \nmanagement would still be required to ensure the availability \nof funds for initial investments. Careful project selection is \nkey in ensuring that investments leverage the largest possible \ngrowth dividends, facilitating further revenue growth. Close \ncoordination with development partners will be essential to \nensure that investments can go ahead without sacrificing debt \nsustainability, especially in light of the fiscal and economic \nchallenges posed by COVID-19.\n\n\fSTATISTICAL APPENDIX\n\n\fStatistical notes and tables\n\nThe statistical appendix presents selected economic indicators for the \n46\u00a0developing member economies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin 18\u00a0tables. The economies are grouped into five subregions: Central Asia, \nEast\u00a0Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2015 to 2019; some have forecasts for 2020 \nand 2021.\n\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is based \non the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the data on \nbalance of payments use International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting \nstandards. Historical data were obtained from official sources, statistical \npublications, and databases, as well as the documents of ADB, the IMF, \nand the World Bank. For some economies, data for 2019 were estimated \nfrom the latest available information. Projections for 2020 and 2021 are \ngenerally ADB estimates made on the bases of available quarterly or \nmonthly data, though some projections are from governments.\n\nMost economies report by calendar year. The following record \ntheir government finance data by fiscal year: Brunei Darussalam; Fiji; \nHong\u00a0Kong, China; the Kyrgyz Republic; Singapore; Tajikistan; Thailand; \nand Uzbekistan. Reporting all variables by fiscal year are South Asian \ncountries (except for Maldives and Sri Lanka), the Cook Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, Palau, the Republic of \nMarshall Islands, Samoa, and Tonga.\n\nRegional and subregional averages or totals are provided for seven \n\ntables: A1, A2, A6, A11, A12, A13, and A14. For tables A1, A2, A6, A11, \nA12, and A14, averages were computed using weights derived from gross \nnational income (GNI) in current US dollars following the World\u00a0Bank \nAtlas method. The GNI data for 2015\u20132018 were obtained from the \nWorld Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators online. Weights for 2018 \nwere carried over through 2021. The GNI data for the Cook Islands \nand Taipei,China were estimated using the Atlas conversion factor. \nFor\u00a0Table\u00a0A13, the regional and subregional totals were computed using a \nconsistent sum, which means that if country data were missing for a given \nyear, the sum excluded that country.\n\nTables A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These tables show data on output \n\ngrowth, production, and demand. Changes to the national income \naccounts series for some countries were made to accommodate a change \n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002347\n\nin source, methodology, and/or base year. The series for Afghanistan, \nBhutan, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan reflects fiscal year data, rather \nthan calendar year data, and those for Timor-Leste reflect GDP excluding \nthe offshore petroleum sector.\n\nTable A1: Growth rate of GDP (% per year). The table shows annual \n\ngrowth rates of GDP valued at constant market prices, factor costs, or \nbasic prices. GDP at market prices is the aggregation of value added \nby all resident producers at producers\u2019 prices including taxes less \nsubsidies on imports plus all nondeductible value-added or similar taxes. \nConstant\u00a0factor cost measures differ from market price measures in \nthat they exclude taxes on production and include subsidies. Basic\u00a0price \nvaluation is the factor cost plus some taxes on production, such as \nproperty and payroll taxes, and less some subsidies, such as for labor but \nnot for products. Most economies use constant market price valuation. \nPakistan uses constant factor costs, and Fiji and Maldives use basic prices.\nTable A2: Growth rate of per capita GDP (% per year). The table \nprovides the growth rates of real per capita GDP, which is defined as GDP \nat constant prices divided by the population. Nepal uses GDP at constant \nfactor cost. Also shown are data on gross national income per capita in \nUS dollar terms (Atlas method) for 2017, sourced from the World Bank\u2019s \nWorld Development Indicators online. Data for the Cook Islands and \nTaipei,China were estimated using the Atlas conversion factor.\n\nTable A3: Growth rate of value added in agriculture (% per year).\n\nThe\u00a0table shows the growth rates of value added in agriculture at \nconstant prices and agriculture\u2019s share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. \nThe\u00a0agriculture sector comprises plant crops, livestock, poultry, fisheries, \nand forestry.\n\nTable A4: Growth rate of value added in industry (% per year).\n\nThe\u00a0table provides the growth rates of value added in industry at constant \nprices and industry\u2019s share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. This\u00a0sector \ncomprises manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and, generally, \nconstruction and utilities.\n\nTable A5: Growth rate of value added in services (% per year).\nThe\u00a0table gives the growth rates of value added in services at constant \nprices and services\u2019 share of GDP in 2017 at current prices. Subsectors \ngenerally include trade, banking, finance, real estate, and similar \nbusinesses, as well as public administration. For Malaysia, electricity, gas, \nwater supply, and waste management are included under services.\nTable A6: Inflation (% per year). Data on inflation rates are \nperiod averages. Inflation rates are based on consumer price indexes. \nThe\u00a0consumer price indexes of the following economies are for a given \ncity only: Cambodia is for Phnom Penh, the Marshall Islands for Majuro, \nSri\u00a0Lanka for Colombo, and Solomon Islands for Honiara. For Uzbekistan, \ndata from 2016 onward reflect the IMF fixed weight method of estimating \nthe consumer price index, as adopted by the government, which has \nnot revised annual average inflation data for 2014\u20132016; for this period, \nIMF\u00a0average consumer price data are used. For Brunei Darussalam, \nthere\u00a0is a series break starting 2016 because of the change in base year \nfrom 2010 to 2015 and for Indonesia, starting 2019 because of the change \nin base year from 2012 to 2018.\n\n\f348(cid:13)(cid:13)Asian Development Outlook 2019\n\nTable A7: Change in money supply (% per year). This table tracks \nannual percentage change in the end-of-period supply of broad money, M2 \nfor most economies. M2 is defined as the sum of currency in circulation \nplus demand deposits (M1) plus quasi-money, which consists of time and \nsavings deposits including foreign currency deposits. For Georgia and India, \nbroad money is M3, which adds longer-term time deposits.\n\nTables A8, A9, and A10: Government finance. These tables give \nthe revenue and expenditure transactions and the fiscal balance of the \ncentral government expressed as a percentage of GDP in nominal terms. \nWhere\u00a0full year data are not yet available, the shares to GDP are estimated \nusing available monthly or quarterly data. For Cambodia, Georgia, India, \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand Tajikistan, transactions are those reported by the general government. \nStarting from 2015 onwards, the series for Cambodia is now based on IMF\u2019s \nGovernment Finance Statistics Manual 2014 format.\n\nTable A8: Central government revenue (% of GDP). Central government \n\nrevenue comprises all nonrepayable receipts, both current and capital, \nplus grants. These amounts are computed as a percentage of GDP at \ncurrent prices. For the Republic of Korea, revenue excludes social security \ncontributions. For Kazakhstan, revenue includes transfers from the national \nfund. Grants are excluded for Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand; revenue \nfrom disinvestment is included for India; and only current revenue is \nincluded for Bangladesh.\n\nTable A9: Central government expenditure (% of GDP). Central \ngovernment expenditure comprises all nonrepayable payments to meet \nboth current and capital expenses, plus net lending. These amounts are \ncomputed as a share of GDP at current prices. For Thailand, expenditure \nrefers to budgetary expenditure excluding externally financed expenditure \nand borrowing. For Tajikistan, expenditure includes externally financed \npublic investment programs. One-time expenditures are excluded for \nPakistan.\n\nTable A10: Fiscal balance of central government (% of GDP). \n\nFiscal\u00a0balance is the difference between central government revenue and \nexpenditure. The difference is computed as a share of GDP at current \nprices. Data variation may arise from statistical discrepancy when, for \nexample, balancing items for general governments (central plus selected \nsubnational governments), and from differences between coverage \nused in individual revenue and expenditure calculations and in fiscal \nbalance calculations. For Fiji, the fiscal balance excludes loan repayment. \nFor\u00a0Georgia, fiscal balance is calculated according to the Government \nFinance Statistics Manual 2001 of the IMF. For Thailand, the fiscal balance \nis the cash balance of the combined budgetary and nonbudgetary balances. \nFor Uzbekistan, the augmented fiscal balance includes the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development. Some off-budget accounts are included \nin the computation of the fiscal balance for Turkmenistan. For Singapore, \nfiscal balance excludes special transfers (top-ups to endowment and \ntrust funds) and contributions from net investment returns, while for the \nRepublic of Korea it excludes social security-related funds.\n\n\fStatistical appendix\u2002\u2002349\n\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments. These tables \nshow annual flows of selected international economic transactions of \ncountries as recorded in the balance of payments.\n\nTables A11 and A12: Growth rates of merchandise exports and \nimports (% per year). These tables show the annual growth rates of \nexports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily \nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. \nExport data are reported free on board. Import data are reported free \non board except for the following economies, which value them based on \ncost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; Hong Kong, China; Georgia; \nIndia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Myanmar; Singapore; and \nThailand.\n\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures\u00a0in this table are based on the export and import amounts used to \ngenerate tables A11 and A12.\n\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current account \n\nbalance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, net trade in \nservices and factor income, and net transfers. The values reported are \ndivided by GDP at current prices in US dollars. For Cambodia, official \ntransfers are excluded from the current account balance.\n\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). Annual \n\naverage exchange rates are quoted as the local currency per US dollar.\n\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \n\ninternational reserves are defined as the US dollar value of holdings of \nforeign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, and \ngold at the end of a given period. For Taipei,China, this heading refers to \nforeign exchange reserves only. In some economies, the rubric is foreign \nassets plus reserves of national monetary authorities (the net foreign \nreserves of, for example, the State Bank of Pakistan) plus national funds \nfor earnings from oil or other natural resources. The data for India are as \nof 10 March 2020.\n\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million). For most economies, \n\nexternal debt outstanding includes short-, medium-, and long-term debt, \npublic and private, as well as IMF credit. For Cambodia, only public \nexternal debt is reported. Intercompany lending is excluded for Georgia. \nFor\u00a0the Kyrgyz Republic, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, the figures \nfor 2019 are as of the end of September.\n\nTable A18: Debt service ratio (% of exports of goods and services). \n\nThis\u00a0table generally presents the total debt service payments of each \neconomy, which comprise principal repayments (excluding on short-term \ndebt) and interest payments on outstanding external debt, as a percentage \nof exports of goods and services. For Cambodia, debt service refers to \nexternal public debt only. For the Philippines, exports of goods, services, \nand income are used as the denominator.

Signs of incipient recovery near the turn of this year were quickly overthrown as \nCOVID-19 broke out in January 2020 in the region\u2019s largest economy and subsequently expanded into a \nglobal pandemic. Disruption to regional and global supply chains, trade, and tourism, and the continued \nspread of the outbreak, leave the region reeling under massive economic shocks and \ufb01 nancial turmoil. \nAcross Asia, the authorities are responding with policies to contain the outbreak, facilitate medical \ninterventions, and support vulnerable businesses and households. Assuming that the outbreak is contained \nthis year, growth is expected to recover in 2021.\n\nEspecially to face down fundamental threats such as the current medical emergency, innovation is critical \nto growth and development. As some economies in developing Asia challenge the innovation frontier, \nmany others lag. More and better innovation is needed in the region to sustain growth that is more \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable. Five key drivers of innovation are sound education, productive \nentrepreneurship, high-quality institutions, effi  cient \ufb01 nancial systems, and dynamic cities that excite \nknowledge exchange. The journey to creating an innovative society takes long-term commitment and \nhard\u00a0work.\n\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\n\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c, \nwhile\u00a0sustaining its eff  orts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members\n\u201449 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, \nloans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2020\n\nWHAT DRIVES INNOVATION IN ASIA?\nSpecial Topic: The Impact of the Coronavirus Outbreak\u2014An Update\n\nAPRIL 2020\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\n\nISBN 978-92-9262-039-4\n\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["ASIAN DEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK 2020\n", "WHAT DRIVES INNOVATION IN ASIA?\nSpecial Topic: The Impact of the Coronavirus Outbreak\u2014An Update\n", "APRIL 2020\n", "ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n", "\u2002Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 IGO license (CC BY 3.0 IGO)\n", "\u00a9 2020 Asian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City, 1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nTel +63 2 8632 4444; Fax +63 2 8636 2444\nwww.adb.org\n", "Some rights reserved.
