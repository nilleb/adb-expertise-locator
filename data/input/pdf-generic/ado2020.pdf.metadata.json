Signs of incipient recovery near the turn of this year were quickly overthrown as \nCOVID-19 broke out in January 2020 in the region\u2019s largest economy and subsequently expanded into a \nglobal pandemic. Disruption to regional and global supply chains, trade, and tourism, and the continued \nspread of the outbreak, leave the region reeling under massive economic shocks and \ufb01 nancial turmoil. \nAcross Asia, the authorities are responding with policies to contain the outbreak, facilitate medical \ninterventions, and support vulnerable businesses and households. Assuming that the outbreak is contained \nthis year, growth is expected to recover in 2021.\nEspecially to face down fundamental threats such as the current medical emergency, innovation is critical \nto growth and development. As some economies in developing Asia challenge the innovation frontier, \nmany others lag. More and better innovation is needed in the region to sustain growth that is more \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable. Five key drivers of innovation are sound education, productive \nentrepreneurship, high-quality institutions, effi  cient \ufb01 nancial systems, and dynamic cities that excite \nknowledge exchange. The journey to creating an innovative society takes long-term commitment and \nhard\u00a0work.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c, \nwhile\u00a0sustaining its eff orts to eradicate extreme poverty.

The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) \nis disrupting people\u2019s lives and interrupting business and other economic activities around \nthe world. Developing Asia will weaken tremendously due to the pandemic, considering the \nregion\u2019s deep integration with the global economy through tourism, trade, and remittances. \nPlummeting commodity prices are also placing a severe burden on some countries. \nAs\u00a0the\u00a0disease spreads and strict measures are imposed to contain it, rapidly undermining \ndomestic demand and the external environment, we forecast regional growth declining \nfrom 5.2% last year to 2.2% in 2020. Growth will rebound to 6.2% in 2021, assuming that \nthe\u00a0pandemic ends this year and activity promptly normalizes. Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income \nnewly industrialized economies\u2014Hong\u00a0Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nand Taipei,China\u2014growth will drop from 5.7% to 2.4% this year before recovering to 6.7% \nnext\u00a0year.\nGrowth could underperform these already lowered forecasts, as the pandemic poses \ndownside risks. Outbreaks could worsen in more countries, and containing them could take \nlonger than currently projected. Our research sees global losses from COVID-19 ranging \nfrom $2.0 trillion to $4.1 trillion, equal to 2.3%\u20134.8% of global GDP. It should be noted \nthat the estimate does not take into account such factors as supply disruptions, interrupted \nremittances, urgent health-care costs, and potential financial disruptions, as well as \nlong-term effects on education and the economy.\nTo mitigate these losses, effective response requires decisiveness, agility, coordination, \nand vigilance from policy makers and institutions throughout the region and around the \nworld. The Asian Development Bank has been supporting our clients, both governments and \nthe private sector, from the early stages of the crisis and stands ready to provide further \nsupport in collaboration with other international organizations such as the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank.\nIn the midst of such unprecedented economic disruption, innovative thinking is vital \nto overcome the current difficulties and rebound quickly. The ability to think up new \nsolutions is necessary to restore developing Asia to its impressive growth path over the \npast decade. With this in mind, our theme chapter discusses the strong progress Asia has \nalready made in\u00a0fostering innovation. It argues for even greater efforts to advance the \nregion\u2019s transformation from middle income to high income, while achieving more inclusive \nand sustainable growth. It highlights and explicates the crucial roles of sound education, \ninnovative entrepreneurship, strong institutions, well-developed financial markets, and \ndynamic cities in fostering innovation.\nI sincerely hope that Asian Development Outlook 2020, with its near-term economic \nperspective and medium- to long-term policy recommendations, will be useful for policy \nmakers in Asia and the Pacific toward developing economic and social policies to overcome \nthe crisis, and to make each country even more resilient, innovative, and inclusive. \nMASATSUGU ASAKAWA\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank", "Acknowledgments\nAsian Development Outlook 2020 was prepared by staff of Asian Development \nBank (ADB) regional departments and resident missions under the guidance \nof the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD). \nRepresentatives of these departments met regularly as the Regional \nEconomic\u00a0Outlook Task\u00a0Force to coordinate and develop consistent forecasts \nfor the\u00a0region.\nEconomists in ERCD, led by Abdul Abiad, director of the \nMacroeconomics\u00a0Research Division, coordinated the production of the \npublication, assisted by Edith Lavi\u00f1a.

Excluding Asia\u2019s high-income newly industrialized \neconomies, growth will drop from 5.7% to 2.4% this year before recovering to \n6.7% next year. \nHeadline inflation accelerated in 2019 as food prices edged up but remained \nlow by historical standards. Inflation will climb further to 3.2% in 2020, but \ndeclining food prices in the latter half of the year will set the stage for easing \ninflation in 2021.\nDownside risks to the outlook are severe, most notably from coronavirus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19). No one can say how widely the COVID-19 pandemic \nmay spread, and containment may take longer than currently projected. \nThe\u00a0possibility of severe financial turmoil and financial crises cannot be \ndiscounted. Sharp and protracted declines in commodity prices and tourist \narrivals will challenge dependent economies across the region.\nIn these difficult times, when challenges to growth abound, innovation is critical \nto inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. While some economies \nin developing Asia are near or at the global innovation frontier, many others \nlag behind. The theme chapter in this report identifies five key drivers of \ninnovation that should inform policy: sound education systems, innovative \nentrepreneurship, conducive institutions, deeper capital markets, and dynamic \ncities that bring together top universities and forward-thinking firms. Asian \ncountries must first get the basics right because there are no shortcuts to an \ninnovation society. For example, strikingly, one in three 10-year-old Asians \ncannot read adequately. This suggests that the education systems of lagging \ncountries must be strengthened and reformed. The journey toward a more \ninnovative Asia thus requires long-term commitment and a lot of hard work.\nYasuyuki Sawada\nChief Economist\nAsian Development Bank", "xii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nAsia reels from the COVID-19 outbreak\nAfter a difficult 2019, challenges mount\n(cid:31) Following a lackluster 2019, an incipient recovery is upended by COVID-19. \nGrowth in developing Asia slowed to 5.2% in 2019 from 5.9% in 2018, \nhandicapped by trade tensions, a downturn in electronics, and weak domestic \ninvestment. Just as recovery in the electronics sector and progress toward what \nwould become the \u201cphase one trade agreement\u201d between the United States \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) began to lift the region\u2019s prospects in \nlate 2019, the momentum was halted by the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19). The outbreak emerged in January 2020, severely affecting \nthe PRC and rapidly spreading across the world. The evolution of the outbreak, \nand hence this outlook, remain highly uncertain, but the baseline forecast is that \nregional growth will slow steeply to 2.2% in 2020 before recovering to 6.2% in \n2021. Excluding the newly industrialized economies, growth is seen to slow from \n5.7% in 2019 to 2.4% in 2020 and then to pick up to 6.7% in 2021.\n(cid:31)  The external environment is worsening as the outbreak spreads. Growth in \nthe major industrial economies of the US, the euro area, and Japan had already \ndecelerated from 2.2% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2019. Signs of revival emerged in \nNovember 2019 as global trade and manufacturing trended upward for the \nfirst time in several months. But, with the COVID-19 outbreak increasingly \noverwhelming Europe and the US, economic activity in those economies is \nexpected to fall sharply as they undertake containment. Growth in the major \nindustrial economies is expected to contract by 0.3% in 2020 before recovering \nto 1.8% in 2021. \n(cid:31)  Growth will fall substantially in the PRC this year. In 2019, US\u2013PRC \ntrade tensions weighed on both exports and domestic demand in the PRC. \nGDP growth slowed from 6.7% in 2018 to 6.1% in 2019. The shock from the \nCOVID-19 outbreak this year is much greater. Data for the first two months of \nthe year indicate double-digit contractions in industry, services, retail sales, and \ninvestment. As a result, growth in the PRC is forecast to slow to 2.3% in 2020 \nbefore rebounding to 7.3% in 2021. \n(cid:31)  Growth in India will remain subdued after a disappointing 2019. India \nsuffered a sharp slowdown last year, from 6.1% in fiscal 2018 to 5.0%, as a credit \ncrunch that originated in the nonbanking financial sector severely hampered \nbank lending. COVID-19 has not yet spread extensively in India, but measures \nto contain the virus and a weaker global environment will whip up headwinds, \noffsetting support from corporate and personal income tax cuts as well as \nfinancial sector reforms which are meant to revive credit flows. GDP growth in \nIndia is forecast to slow further to 4.0% this year before strengthening to 6.2% in \nfiscal 2021.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xiii\n(cid:31) All of developing Asia\u2019s subregions will see growth weaken in 2020. Global \ndemand weakened by the pandemic will weigh on the 2020 outlook, particularly \nin the more open subregions and tourism-dependent economies like those in \nthe Pacific. Growth in East Asia will dip from 5.4% in 2019 to 2.0% in 2020 \nbefore reaccelerating to 6.5% in 2021. As the larger Southeast Asian economies \nwrestle with COVID-19, growth in the subregion is forecast to drop to 1.0% \nin\u00a02020 before recovering to 4.7% in 2021. Growth in Central Asia will also slow \nto 2.8% this year with lower oil prices, and the Pacific will contract by 0.3% with \ndeclining tourism, before rebounding in 2021. South Asia\u2019s growth rate is forecast \nto slow from 5.1% in fiscal 2019 to 4.1% in fiscal 2020 and reaccelerate to 6.0% \nin fiscal 2021, largely tracking recovery in India. Across Asia and the Pacific, the \nauthorities have introduced stimulus packages to support economic activity.\n(cid:31)  Inflation will tick up on increased food prices before easing in 2021. Regional \ninflation increased from 2.5% in 2018 to 2.9% in 2019, driven mainly by rising \nfood prices, particularly pork prices in the PRC and vegetable prices in India. \nHowever, inflation has remained under control, below the 3.3% average in the \npast 10 years, which has allowed many central banks across developing Asia to \ncut policy rates to stimulate growth. Regional inflation is projected to increase \nto 3.2% in 2020, driven by pork prices in the PRC, before easing again to 2.3% \nin\u00a02021. Weakening economic activity and softening commodity prices will partly \noffset the effect of food prices. \n(cid:31)  A widening current account surplus in 2019 and 2020 will narrow in 2021. \nGlobal trade tensions kept developing Asia\u2019s exports and imports in the doldrums \nin 2019, but imports fell more sharply, reflecting in part lower investment growth \nin the region. Trade growth will likely weaken even further this year as domestic \ndemand wanes and trade and supply are disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak. \nThus, the regional current account surplus for the whole of developing Asia will \nexpand only slightly from 1.5% of GDP in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020, before falling \nback to 1.4% in 2021.\n(cid:31)  COVID-19 poses a grave threat to the regional and global outlooks. \nThe\u00a0forecast assumes containment of the outbreak within this year and a return \nto normal next year. But even as the epicenter of the disease has shifted to \nEurope and the US, the potential for additional outbreaks in the region and \nworldwide remains, and there is vast uncertainty about the duration and severity \nof the pandemic. Hence outcomes can be worse than forecast and growth may \nnot recover as quickly. The Special Topic in this report is an updated assessment \nof the regional and global impacts of the outbreak, and indicates substantial \ndownside risks if it spreads further in the region\u2019s economies. The possibility of \na financial crises cannot be discounted and the pandemic could also bring about \nfundamental changes to the global economy over the long term.", "xiv(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nThe impact of COVID-19 on developing Asia\u2014an update\n(cid:31) The rapid spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made it the \nworst pandemic in a century. The outbreak was still concentrated primarily \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) when ADB released initial estimates \nof its economic impact on 6 March. Since then the outbreak has expanded \nsignificantly, with its epicenter shifting to Europe and the United States. The use \nof containment measures such as travel bans and community quarantines has \nexpanded greatly. And data from the PRC indicate that the outbreak caused a \ndouble-digit decline in economic activity in the first quarter of 2020.\n(cid:31)  Updated scenarios suggest a much larger impact than previously \nenvisioned, reflecting these new realities. The range of scenarios explored in \nthis update suggest a global cost of between $2.0 and $4.1 trillion, equivalent \nto between 2.3% and 4.8% of global GDP. The much higher estimate \nreflects its spread to Europe, the United States, and other major economies. \nDeveloping\u00a0Asia\u00a0including the PRC accounts for just 22% to 36% of the total. \nNevertheless, regional economies will be hit hard, with an impact on the PRC \nof close to 5% of\u00a0GDP. The loss to the rest of developing Asia will be between \n1.0% and 2.2% of\u00a0GDP. The estimated impact could be an underestimate, \nas additional channels such\u00a0as supply disruptions, interrupted remittances, \npossible social and financial crises, and long-term effects on health care and \neducation are excluded from the analysis. The analysis provides estimates of the \nimpact on individual economies in developing Asia, and on sectors within them, \nincluding\u00a0the additional impact on an economy if it experiences a significant \noutbreak of its own.\nEstimated global and regional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, under different scenarios\nShorter containment,   Longer containment,  \nsmaller demand shocks larger demand shocks\nLosses,   Losses,  \n% of GDP $ billion % of GDP $ billion\nWorld \u20132.3 2,013.0 \u20134.8 4,090.8\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \u20134.6 \u2002\u2002628.0 \u20135.1 \u2002\u2002691.6\nDeveloping Asia excluding the PRC \u20131.0 \u2002\u2002\u200293.3 \u20132.2 \u2002\u2002200.1\nRest of the world \u20132.0 1,291.6 \u20135.1 3,199.1\nGDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: ADB estimates.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xv\nOutlook by subregion\n(cid:31) Developing Asia will suffer a sharp slowdown in 2020 as it struggles to \ncontain COVID-19. Growth will slow in most regional economies this year, \nwith output in 9 of 46 ADB developing member countries expected to shrink. \nAggregate economic growth will decelerate to 2.2% in 2020 but reaccelerate \nto 6.2% in 2021. By subregion, deceleration will be mildest in South Asia and \nsteepest in the Pacific.\n(cid:31)  East Asia will weaken but can expect to bounce back. The slowdown is most \nprominent in the PRC, where the global health crisis first emerged. Recession in \nHong Kong, China caused by separate stresses at home and abroad in 2019 will \ndeepen in 2020 but begin to ease as fiscal responses and stronger exports bring \nrecovery, probably beginning in 2021. Growth in the ROK and Taipei,China will \ndip this year before rising next year on public spending and resurgent exports. \nSimilarly, growth in Mongolia will decline this year as FDI inflow ebbs but will \nclimb next year as mining and investment pick up. Despite the growth slowdown \nthis year, inflation in the subregion will accelerate to 3.2% on temporarily higher \nprices for food, especially pork, in the heavily weighted PRC, and as inflation \ninches up in the ROK. In the rest of the subregion, inflation will slow in 2020 as \ndemand wanes and then quicken in 2021 as economic activity revives.\n(cid:31)  South Asia will face a milder slowdown. Growth in South Asia will decelerate \nto 4.1% in 2020 and then recover to 6.0% in 2021, largely tracking the trend \nin the dominant Indian economy. GDP performance will remain strong in \nBangladesh, which is forecast to grow by 7.8% this year even as global demand \npulls back, and continue to accelerate in Bhutan both this year and next as a new \n5-year plan strengthens government spending, and despite lower tourist arrivals. \nMaldives and Sri Lanka are less sheltered from global efforts to limit the spread \nof COVID-19, which are forecast to cause the tourism-dominated economy \nof Maldives to contract by 3.0% in 2020 before surging back in 2021. Leaving \naside external upheaval, growth in Pakistan will slow as agriculture stagnates, \nnotably affecting cotton output, and as stabilization efforts constrain domestic \ndemand. The intended correction of macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan \nshould restore confidence in the economy and bring later benefits. Inflation in \nthe subregion will soften to 4.1% in 2020 as food inflation eases in India with \nimproved agriculture. Unusually low inflation will continue in Maldives with \nsubsidies and price controls on basic goods joined by anticipated deterioration in \ndemand. Pakistan, by contrast, will struggle this year with double-digit inflation \nfueled by escalating food prices, scheduled hikes to utility rates, and domestic \ncurrency depreciation. \n(cid:31)  Southeast Asia will track the PRC and decelerate to 1.0% growth in 2020. \nAll economies in the subregion will endure a growth slowdown in 2020 because \nof COVID-19 and a consequent global slump, especially given their strong trade \nand investment ties with a slowing PRC. Thailand, the second-largest economy \nin the subregion, will likely contract by 4.8% this year, continuing a steady slide \nin recent years. Growth in the closely intertwined economies of Malaysia and \nSingapore will plummet nearly to zero in 2020, with only Malaysia enjoying a \nstrong rebound next year. Cambodia and Indonesia will see sharp deceleration, \nas will the Philippines despite expansionary government policies, which should ", "xvi(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nfacilitate an upturn in 2021. Growth in Viet Nam is forecast to decelerate \nsignificantly but remain uniquely robust in the subregion. With most economies \nweakening and global oil prices softening, subregional inflation should stay tame \nat just 1.9% in 2020 and 2.2% in 2021. Counting mitigated deflation in Brunei \nDarussalam, 8 of the 11 economies will see somewhat higher inflation this year \nbecause of continued food price pressure, but inflation will slow in Myanmar and \nthe Philippines and reverse to a deflation in Thailand. \n(cid:31)  Central Asia will decelerate under COVID-19 after steady acceleration in \nrecent years. Growth in the subregion will drop to 2.8% in 2020 as economies \nfalter worldwide and drag down global commodity prices. Lower petroleum prices \nand sluggish production will weaken oil exporters, with growth slowing to 0.5% \nin Azerbaijan and 1.8% in Kazakhstan, the largest economy in the subregion, \nslowed as well as by reduced public investment. Fiscal consolidation and lower \nremittances from the Russian Federation will weaken growth in Tajikistan. \nGeorgia\u2019s highly tourism- and trade-dependent economy will be particularly \nvulnerable to COVID-19 as closed borders and monetary tightening grind growth \nto a halt in 2020. Growth in Armenia, a metal producer notable for its sales to \nthe PRC, will fall sharply this year, and slower mineral exports to the PRC will \nslow growth less dramatically in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. Subregional \ninflation at 7.6% this year will be little changed as mixed projections balance out. \nMonetary tightening is expected to lower inflation in Georgia and Uzbekistan \nboth years and in Kazakhstan in 2021.\n(cid:31)  The Pacific will be hard hit by the pandemic and resulting global slowdown. \nCombined output in the subregion is forecast to decline by 0.3% in 2020 as 5 of \nits 14 economies contract. Countries that rely heavily on tourism and commodity \nexports will be particularly vulnerable. Fiji\u2019s dependence on both will cause \nthe steepest decline, with GDP contracting by 4.9%. The Cook Islands, Palau, \nSamoa, and Vanuatu, which also have large tourist industries, will see output \nshrink this year. As restrictions on the movement of labor and capital equipment \ndelay infrastructure projects, growth will suffer in smaller economies. With only \nsubdued recovery in 2021, growth in the subregion will remain below average in \ndeveloping Asia next year. Inflation will edge down to 2.7% this year with fading \ndemand but rebound to 3.8% in 2021 on expected currency depreciation in \nPapua New Guinea, the largest economy in the subregion, and growth recovery \nin Fiji, the second largest. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xvii\nWhat drives innovation in Asia?\nInnovating for inclusive and sustainable growth \n(cid:31) Innovation is a complex, diverse, and multifaceted process. The term refers \nto new, significantly different products and processes that improve productivity \nand benefit users. Innovation occurs through a wide range of activities carried \nout by a variety of actors. Some innovations are game changers, such as the \nmobile phones that left landline phones to gather dust. Much more common are \nincremental innovations, such as those that create more and better features in \nmobile phones. While first-in-the-world frontier innovations like driverless cars \ngrab most of the headlines, developing Asia receives more impetus from a steady \nstream of first-in-your-market catch-up innovations. \n(cid:31)  Asia\u2019s emergence as a middle-income region argues for more innovation. \nThe region owes its transition from low to middle income to the accumulation \nof production factors such as capital and skilled workers and to productivity \ngrowth\u2014the latter assuming a larger role in growth as economies mature \nand become heavily dependent on innovation. Middle-income countries that \nsuccessfully graduate to high income invest three times more on research and \ndevelopment (R&D) than do countries mired in the middle-income trap, and \nthey file four times more patent applications. The Republic of Korea (ROK) and \nAsia\u2019s other three newly industrialized economies are examples of economies \ninnovating their way to high income.\n(cid:31)  Innovation can promote more inclusive and sustainable growth. Innovation \nsustains regional growth and improves its quality in an inclusive manner. Many \nbasic innovations\u2014notable examples being insecticide-treated bed nets, cost-\neffective water filters, and payments transacted through mobile phones\u2014\ncan improve the quality of life for the most disadvantaged and are often the \nbrainchildren of impoverished innovators with the keenest insights into the needs \nof these communities. Similarly, green innovations in energy, transport, and other \nareas promote a cleaner environment.\nLandscape of innovation in Asia\n(cid:31) The innovation gap is narrowing, but unevenly. While advanced economies \ninvest on average 2.5% of their GDP in R&D, developing Asia is close behind at \n2.1%, up from 0.9% in the late 1990s. Excluding the four newly industrialized \neconomies, investment in developing Asia equals 1.9% of GDP, well ahead of \n0.8% in Latin America. However, Asia\u2019s high average masks wide variation across \ncountries, with lower-income countries more likely to undertake catch-up \nadaptation than innovate at the global technology frontier.\n(cid:31)  Evidence from firms shows that Asia already innovates a lot. Analysis of \nalmost 27,000 firms in developing Asia finds that 53% of them innovate to \nproduce new products, processes, or both. However, most innovation by firms \nimproves existing products or processes incrementally, at some distance from \nthe global technology frontier. This explains why reported innovation rates are \nhigher among firms in low-income countries with greater scope for incremental, ", "xviii(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\ncatch-up innovation. In the region as a whole, firms that are relatively innovative \nare usually larger, older, active exporters, or engaged in information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) or high-tech manufacturing.\n(cid:31)  Research highlights the role of R&D, human capital, and infrastructure. \nCross-country analysis finds a positive relationship between innovation and \neconomic growth across countries, and, in developing Asia, between innovation \nand spending on R&D and human capital. The effect of human capital is \nmore pronounced and robust. A 1% increase in secondary school enrollment \nis associated with increased innovation, proxied by patent flows, by 2%. The \ncoverage and quality of energy, transport, and ICT infrastructure also correlate \npositively with innovation. The effect of human capital investment is especially \nrobust, as detailed below.\nFostering innovators and an innovative culture\n(cid:31) Evidence from firms strongly links human capital and innovation. Intuitively, \na workforce that is highly skilled and educated, especially to the tertiary level, \npowers a more innovative economy. Many innovators who achieve technological \nbreakthroughs are, after all, scientists and engineers. Analysis of firms in Asia \nthat considered three indicators of human capital\u2014workers\u2019 formal educational \nattainment, managerial experience, and training provided by firms\u2014found a \nrobust positive association between human capital and innovation. Firms that \ntrained their employees, for example, were more likely to innovate than were \nfirms that did not, by as much as 12.4 percentage points.\n(cid:31)  Sound education systems can help create a larger pool of innovators. \nHowever, the link between education and innovation is not automatic. \nA\u00a0prerequisite for a well-educated workforce that can innovate is high-quality \neducation in literacy, numeracy, and other basic skills. Where education systems \nfail to deliver, they must be reformed thoroughly to improve the quality of \neducation in basic skills. More student-centered teaching can foster creative \nand innovative thinking. Finally, a mix of skills is needed to drive innovation. \nWhile the STEM quartet of science, technology, engineering, and math clearly \nprovide key competencies that promote innovation, other qualities critical to \ninnovation\u2014such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and grit\u2014must \nalso be nurtured.\n(cid:31)  Strong institutions enable innovative entrepreneurs. The quality of \nentrepreneurship in an economy is more important for innovation than its \nquantity. A very small minority of entrepreneurs, known in the business world \nas \u201cgazelles,\u201d account for the bulk of innovation and job growth, while most \nentrepreneurs neither innovate nor create jobs. A country\u2019s ability to foster \ngazelles depends largely on its institutional conditions. Analysis of more than \n36,000 businesses in 17 Asian economies reveals that strong property rights \nand rule of law encourage entrepreneurs to formalize their businesses, and that \ngrowth in formalized businesses is associated with greater innovation. ", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xix\n(cid:31) Rapid advances in ICT have revolutionized the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nTechnological developments have sharply reduced the cost of innovative \nentrepreneurship. They have spawned new business models that use frontier \ntechnology platforms such as the Global Positioning System, as exemplified \nby the ride-sharing and delivery services Gojek and Grab. As\u00a0a\u00a0result, \nentrepreneurial ecosystems have emerged and multiplied all over the world \nto exploit entrepreneurial opportunities opened up by the global digital \ntransformation. This transformation is driven by relentless advances in digital \ntechnology and infrastructure, notably the internet. The transformation of \nAlibaba and Amazon into global tech giants illustrate the huge potential of digital \nentrepreneurship.\nConducive institutions and environment for innovators\n(cid:31) Intellectual protection should reflect the stage of economic development. \nPatents and industrial design are critical for frontier innovations and in \nhigher-income economies. Other types of intellectual property rights such as \nutility models or petty patents are better suited to the incremental catch-up \ninnovations that are important in less-developed countries. Analysis of more \nthan 7,000 firms in the ROK from 1970 to 2010 indicates that petty patents and \ntrademarks facilitated firms\u2019 growth during the country\u2019s earliest development \nstage. Design protection assumed a bigger role during the subsequent catch-up \nphase of ROK development, and patents became prominent during the most \nrecent globalized phase. Thus, property rights cannot be judged solely on \nwhether they are strong or weak. It is more important to offer the right type of \nintellectual property protection for a country\u2019s stage of development. \n(cid:31)  Equity and other capital markets are key to financing innovation. Analysis \nof patent data by industry in 47 countries from 1997 to 2016 reveals that \nfinancial markets matter greatly to innovation in an economy. The vitality of \nboth the equity market and the debt market have positive and significant effects \non R&D efficiency, as measured by the number of patents granted. Equity and \ndebt markets also have positive and significant effects on innovation quality, \nas\u00a0measured by citations in research papers. The effect is more pronounced for \nequity markets. The implication for Asian countries is that they should continue \nto develop their capital markets.\n(cid:31)  Evidence confirms the importance of cities as engines of innovation. \nInnovation tends to be concentrated in a few urban innovation hubs able to \ngenerate strong agglomeration economies. Across Asia, such concentration of \ninnovation can be seen in product innovation, process innovation, and R&D. \nThe 10 most innovative cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) account \nfor 72% of product innovation but only 55% of the urban population. In India, \nthe corresponding figures are 76% of innovation but only 43% of the urban \npopulation. Evidence shows that city size has a significant effect on innovative \nactivity, with firms in larger cities tending to be more innovative, as does the \npresence of top-tier universities. However, haphazard urbanization that causes \ntraffic congestion and other urban ills can undermine a city\u2019s potential as an \nengine of innovation and growth.", "xx(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nToward a more innovative Asia\n(cid:31) Asian governments can and should become catalysts for innovation. \nGovernments play a major direct role in innovative activity and sponsor a \nsubstantial share of R&D. From 1996 to 2017, government shares of R&D \nwere 23% in the PRC, 24% in the ROK, and 42% in Viet Nam. While private \nR&D typically concentrates on immediately practical commercial applications, \ngovernments tend to support basic research that can spill over in multiple \ndirections. Plenty of scope exists, however, for government-supported innovation \nto improve products and processes directly. Public sector innovation labs like \nthose in Armenia and Sri Lanka can promote experimentation and openness to \nnew approaches. \n(cid:31)  The policy environment for innovators must evolve with the economy. \nEach\u00a0country has a unique national innovation system to address market failures \nwhich are inherent in innovation. Governments should play direct and leading \nroles in developing these systems at their early stages but shift to less direct, \nsupportive functions after the private sector has stepped up and assumed a \nbigger role. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on how effective active innovation \npolicies\u00a0are. Subsidies paid by Innofund, for example, through which the \nGovernment of the PRC supports R&D by smaller tech companies, seem to offer \nonly limited increments in innovative output. This observation highlights the \nneed for nuance in government interventions. \n(cid:31)  Local policies must complement national policies to foster innovation. \nTo\u00a0facilitate local entrepreneurial ecosystems, local policies should adhere to \nkey\u00a0principles: (i) adopting a bottom\u2013up approach to facilitate entrepreneurship, \nmore than can be achieved with a top\u2013down hierarchical approach; \n(ii)\u00a0close\u00a0engagement with all stakeholders; (iii) nurturing communities of \nentrepreneurs, accelerators, financiers, large businesses, mentors, public \nagencies, educational institutions, and regional agencies by serving as their \nsecretariat; (iv) enabling entrepreneurs to share their knowledge gleaned from \nbusiness model experiments by promoting networking events and platforms; \nand (v) encouraging active public\u2013private interaction though systematic and \ninstitutionalized dialogue. Local policies can thus help cities and other localities \nrealize their potential to apply new technologies to incubate innovation and new \nbusiness models.", "Highlights\u2002\u2002xxi\nGDP growth rate and in\ufb02ation, % per year\nGDP growth In\ufb02ation\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2018 2019 2020 2021\nCentral Asia \u20024.4 \u20024.9 \u20022.8 4.2 \u20028.2 \u20027.5 \u20027.6 \u20026.3\nArmenia \u20025.2 \u20027.6 \u20022.2 4.5 \u20022.5 \u20021.4 \u20022.8 \u20022.2\nAzerbaijan \u20021.4 \u20022.2 \u20020.5 1.5 \u20022.3 \u20022.6 \u20022.5 \u20023.5\nGeorgia \u20024.8 \u20025.1 \u20020.0 4.5 \u20022.6 \u20024.9 \u20024.5 \u20023.0\nKazakhstan \u20024.1 \u20024.5 \u20021.8 3.6 \u20026.0 \u20025.3 \u20026.0 \u20025.7\nKyrgyz Republic \u20023.8 \u20024.5 \u20024.0 4.5 \u20021.5 \u20021.1 \u20023.5 \u20023.0\nTajikistan \u20027.3 \u20027.5 \u20025.5 5.0 \u20025.4 \u20028.0 \u20029.0 \u20028.0\nTurkmenistan \u20026.2 \u20026.3 \u20026.0 5.8 13.2 13.4 13.0 \u20028.0\nUzbekistan \u20025.4 \u20025.6 \u20024.7 5.8 17.5 14.6 13.0 10.0\nEast Asia \u20026.1 \u20025.4 \u20022.0 6.5 \u20022.0 \u20022.6 \u20023.2 \u20021.8\nHong Kong, China \u20022.9 \u20131.2 \u20133.3 3.5 \u20022.4 \u20022.9 \u20022.0 \u20022.5\nMongolia \u20027.2 \u20025.1 \u20022.1 4.6 \u20026.8 \u20027.3 \u20026.6 \u20027.9\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \u20026.7 \u20026.1 \u20022.3 7.3 \u20022.1 \u20022.9 \u20023.6 \u20021.9\nRepublic of Korea \u20022.7 \u20022.0 \u20021.3 2.3 \u20021.5 \u20020.4 \u20020.9 \u20021.3\nTaipei,China \u20022.7 \u20022.7 \u20021.8 2.5 \u20021.3 \u20020.6 \u20020.4 \u20020.8\nSouth Asia \u20026.1 \u20025.1 \u20024.1 6.0 \u20023.7 \u20024.9 \u20024.1 \u20024.4\nAfghanistan \u20022.7 \u20023.0 \u20023.0 4.0 \u20020.6 \u20022.3 \u20022.3 \u20023.5\nBangladesh \u20027.9 \u20028.2 \u20027.8 8.0 \u20025.8 \u20025.5 \u20025.6 \u20025.5\nBhutan \u20023.8 \u20024.4 \u20025.2 5.8 \u20023.7 \u20022.8 \u20023.8 \u20024.0\nIndia \u20026.1 \u20025.0 \u20024.0 6.2 \u20023.4 \u20024.7 \u20023.0 \u20023.8\nMaldives \u20026.9 \u20025.7 \u20133.0 7.5 \u20130.1 \u20020.2 \u20021.0 \u20021.2\nNepal \u20026.7 \u20027.1 \u20025.3 6.4 \u20024.2 \u20024.6 \u20026.0 \u20025.5\nPakistan \u20025.5 \u20023.3 \u20022.6 3.2 \u20024.7 \u20026.8 11.5 \u20028.3\nSri Lanka \u20023.2 \u20022.6 \u20022.2 3.5 \u20024.3 \u20024.3 \u20025.0 \u20024.8\nSoutheast Asia \u20025.1 \u20024.4 \u20021.0 4.7 \u20022.6 \u20022.1 \u20021.9 \u20022.2\nBrunei Darussalam \u20020.1 \u20023.9 \u20022.0 3.0 \u20021.0 \u20130.4 \u20130.2 \u20020.1\nCambodia \u20027.5 \u20027.1 \u20022.3 5.7 \u20022.5 \u20021.9 \u20022.1 \u20021.8\nIndonesia \u20025.2 \u20025.0 \u20022.5 5.0 \u20023.2 \u20022.8 \u20023.0 \u20022.8\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

The initial ADB estimates of \neconomic impact from the COVID-19 outbreak were presented \nin an ADB Brief released on 6 March. In the month since then, \nthree important changes have occurred that necessitate an\u00a0update. ", "32(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nThe\u00a0first is the escalation of the outbreak into a global pandemic, \nas noted above. The second is the arrival of the first hard evidence, \nfrom the PRC, of how the outbreak and resulting containment \npolicies negatively affected consumption and investment. The third \nchange is the sharp rise in the deployment of containment policies \nsuch as travel bans, border closures, and quarantines. Scenario \nassumptions have been updated to reflect these developments. \nAs\u00a0in\u00a0the 6\u00a0March ADB\u00a0Brief, the analysis here describes the various \nchannels through which economies can be affected. It explicitly lays \nout the assumptions underlying various scenarios regarding how \nthe outbreak may play out. It\u00a0then quantifies the likely magnitude of \neach scenario\u2019s economic impact. Finally, it provides details on how \nindividual economies and sectors within them will be affected. \nCOVID-19 will affect economic activity through multiple \nquantifiable channels. The channels used in this analysis include \ndeclines in domestic consumption and investment from containment \npolicies and precautionary behavior. The\u00a0induced decline in domestic \ndemand is likely to be the most important channel of economic \nimpact in economies with serious outbreaks, or in economies \nwhich implement strong containment policies preemptively even \nbefore an outbreak becomes serious. Travel bans, border closures, \nand reduced demand for travel will affect tourism, transport, and \ntrade. This\u00a0will\u00a0be important for more open and tourism-dependent \neconomies. Weaker demand in one sector can spill over to other \nsectors, both domestically or internationally, through production and \ntrade links. As in\u00a0the 6\u00a0March ADB Brief, the analysis accounts for \nand quantifies effects through these channels. \nMany additional channels for affects on economic activity \nare not as easily analyzed or quantified. These channels include \ndisrupted supply from production stoppages or border closures, \nwhich can affect other industries that use these intermediate \ninputs. Hard data on which sectors have seen significant supply \ndisruptions, how long the disruptions will last, and whether \nother industries have sufficient inventories is lacking. And part \nof the impact of the supply-side shock is already captured in the \nanalysis, as disruptions lead to declines in household incomes and \ncorporate profits which reduce domestic demand. Weaker global \ndemand because of the pandemic has also forced down prices for \noil and other commodities. This will slow growth in economies \nthat produce and export these products even as it lowers inflation \nin consuming economies. Remittances can be affected in many \nways, as the pandemic affects not only migrant workers\u2019 home \ncountries but also the countries where they work. But hard data \non how remittances have been affected is still lacking. The scale \nof the economic shock has roiled financial markets and tightened \nfinancial conditions, heightening the risk of financial crises. Lastly, \neconomic effects can flow directly from worsened disease incidence \nand mortality, as\u00a0well\u00a0as from forced shifts in health care spending. \nADB\u00a0is working on quantifying impact through these channels and \nwill present results in upcoming reports.

These are the declines in consumption \nand investment growth used for the PRC in this analysis.\nSince mid-March, many countries have declared states \nof emergency. As of 24 March, 50 countries that together \nprovide 39% of global GDP had declared a state of emergency \nin response to COVID-19, and 174 countries had enacted some \nform of school closure (Figure 1.2.3). Many countries have \ninstituted community quarantines and stay-at-home policies to \nslow virus transmission. \nTravel bans and border closures spread in March, hurting \ntourism-dependent economies. One of the earliest travel bans \nwas imposed on 24 January, when the PRC prohibited all \noutbound travel by tour groups, or 55% of all tourism outbound \nfrom the PRC. In late January and early February, many \ncountries also imposed bans on travel to the PRC. The\u00a0use of \ntravel bans accelerated in March as the pandemic spread to \nmany other countries. Analysis using bilateral tourist arrivals \ndata from past years suggests that current travel bans will \naffect more than 550\u00a0million international trips, or over \n40% of the total\u00a0in a typical year (Figure\u00a01.2.4). Arrivals and \ntourism receipts in many economies in developing Asia are \nthus expected to decline sharply as a result of these travel bans \nand precautionary behavior. Tourism is an important revenue \nsource in many economies in developing\u00a0Asia.

High-frequency data indicate that PRC \neconomic activity began to normalize in March but is not yet \ncompletely back to normal. One such daily activity tracker, \nby\u00a0China International Capital Corporation, combines data on \ncoal consumption, labor migration, freight logistics, and urban \ntransport use. The tracker suggests that February\u00a0activity \naveraged 53% below normal, and data to 26\u00a0March show March \nactivity averaging about 21% below normal. Labor\u00a0migration, \ncoal consumption, and freight logistics indicators have returned \nto normal, but urban transportation is still far below normal \n(Figure\u00a01.2.5).\nThe unpredictable COVID-19 outbreak trajectory requires \nthe use of multiple scenarios. Huge uncertainties persist over \nhow quickly affected economies can get outbreaks under control \nand normalize economic activity. While\u00a0current\u00a0evidence from \nthe PRC suggests that outbreaks can be ended in 3 months, \nno guarantee exists that outbreak duration in other countries \nwill be similar. Even in the PRC, activity has not yet fully \nnormalized, as\u00a0noted above. Many\u00a0restrictions including some \ntravel bans remain, and the possibility of a resurgence in \nCOVID-19 cases cannot be ruled out. This argues for allowing \nin scenarios some variation in duration. This analysis assumes \ncontainment in 3\u00a0months in a better scenario, and in 6\u00a0months \nin a worse scenario. Outbreaks\u00a0of even longer duration are \npossible, especially in less-developed economies where capacity \nto implement required policies is more limited and health systems \nare less developed. There is also uncertainty about how deeply \ndomestic demand will decline as a result of the outbreak and \ncontainment measures. The\u00a06\u00a0March ADB Brief assumed declines \nin consumption and investment growth by 2 percentage points \nfrom normal, and that assumption is repeated here in the better \nscenario. In\u00a0the\u00a0Republic of Korea and Singapore, outbreaks have \nbeen held at bay through social distancing, extensive testing, and \ncontact tracing, without resort to widespread quarantines or stay-\nat-home policies that are more deleterious to economic activity. \nAt the other end, PRC data show that declines in consumption \ngrowth could be as large as 5 percentage points and in investment \ngrowth 6.25\u00a0percentage points. The analysis thus considers two \nscenarios, with assumptions detailed in Table 1.2.2:\n(i) Better scenario with shorter containment and smaller \ndemand shocks.

In the rest of developing Asia in aggregate, the impact \nwill be 1.0%\u20132.2% of combined GDP. Considering that world \nGDP growth was just 2.4% last year, the estimated global \nimpact suggests that global recession is indeed possible unless \npolicy\u00a0makers respond swiftly and decisively.\nRegional impact will be greatest in DMCs with domestic \noutbreaks or tourism dependence. Spillover from the global \npandemic is greatest in Maldives, whose economy relies heavily \non international tourism, receipts from which provide close \nto 60% of GDP.

In many other DMCs, the impact from \nglobal spillover will be smaller. But the risk\u2014and for some \neconomies the reality\u2014is a domestic outbreak that further \ndepresses economic activity. In\u00a0these economies, the domestic \noutbreak imposes an additional impact, on top of the loss from \nspillover, equal to 2%\u20134% of GDP (Figure\u00a01.2.6). \nWithin economies, tourism-related sectors will be hard \nhit by lower global demand. Detailed results showing the \nimpact on individual economies and on sectors within them \ncan be found on the ADB website dedicated to COVID-19.4\nIn\u00a0Thailand, for\u00a0example, some 55% of spillover from the \nglobal pandemic falls on two service categories: hotels and \nrestaurants and other personal services, which could suffer \na temporary 23% employment loss under the longer scenario, \nand transport services, which could suffer a temporary 16% \nemployment loss. \nLimitations on this analysis may mean it underestimates \nimpact on DMCs.

Each\u00a0of these channels could substantially worsen \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In less-developed \neconomies, inadequate capacity in the health system to cope or \nin the government to undertake necessary measures to contain \nthe virus or ameliorate its economic effects could mean longer \noutbreaks with more severe economic disruption.

This favorable production outlook \ufb01nds \nsupport from forecasts of neutral weather in the \ufb01rst half of \n2020 and low input prices because of softer oil prices. However, \nconsumption is expected to outpace production, leaving ratios \nof stock to use lower than in previous cropping seasons. The \nforecast lower ratios are comfortable but nevertheless create \nupward pressure on prices, especially as disrupted global \nsupply chains further tighten supply. On balance, the food \ncommodity price index is forecast to rise slightly by 2.0% in \nboth years to the forecast horizon. \nAmong several risks to these forecasts are severe worsening \nof the COVID-19 outbreak, trade friction, changes to domestic \nsupport policies, further depreciation of commodity exporter \ncurrencies, the ever-present potential for oil price volatility, \nand adverse weather.", "", "2\nWHAT DRIVES \nINNOVATION IN ASIA?", "", "What drives innovation in Asia?\nInnovation is critical to growth and development. While some \neconomies in developing Asia are near the forefront of innovation, \nmany others lag behind. This theme chapter outlines what \npolicy\u00a0makers can do to foster greater innovation.\nIt identifies five key drivers of innovation. The first is education, \nwhich is hardly surprising since innovation is an intrinsically \nhuman enterprise. In a number of Asian economies, too many \nchildren lack even the most basic literacy and numeracy skills. \nPolicy makers must therefore focus first on strengthening basic \nskills, but they must also shift to more learner-centered teaching \npractices and to broadening and diversifying the skills\u00a0mix.\nThe second driver is entrepreneurship. While people tend to link \nentrepreneurship with innovation, fewer than 1% of entrepreneurs \ncreate more than half of job growth and innovation. It is therefore \ncrucially important to design policy that facilitates the potential of \nthese productive entrepreneurial firms and thereby better harness \nthem for economic development.\nThe final three drivers of innovation are high-quality \ninstitutions, robust financial systems, and big cities. High-quality \ninstitutions, including the rule of law and strong property rights, \ngive innovative entrepreneurs the confidence they need to take \nrisks and experiment with new ideas. The evolution of intellectual \nproperty rights in the Republic of Korea suggests that different \ninstitutions and kinds of protection may matter more at different \nstages of development.\nA sound and efficient financial system can channel resources \nto innovators. Indeed, analysis suggests that the development of \nfinancial markets, for both equity and debt, has a positive effect \non patents. Finally,\u00a0cities can be powerful forces for promoting \ninnovative activity because they facilitate knowledge spillover \nand\u00a0dissemination. Innovation policy thus requires a nuanced, \nbottom\u2013up approach geared toward enabling local innovators.\nIn the end, there are no shortcuts to creating an innovative \nsociety. The journey requires long-term commitment and a lot of \nhard work.\nThis chapter was written by Donghyun Park, Elisabetta Gentile, Abdul\u00a0Abiad, \nLiming Chen, Sameer Khatiwada, Rhea Molato-Gayares, Kirsty Newman, \nMadhavi Pundit, Irfan\u00a0Qureshi, and Shu Tian.", "58(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nInnovating for inclusive \nand\u00a0sustainable growth\nInnovations, including social innovations such as work-from-home \narrangements, can help Asian countries better cope with the \nlarge economic repercussions of COVID-19. Despite\u00a0a\u00a0universal \nconsensus that innovation is vital to long-term economic, \nsocial, and technological progress, the term is hard to define. \nInnovation\u00a0exists along a continuum that stretches from \nincremental innovations that improve existing products or \nprocesses in small but material ways to, at the other extreme, \nradical innovation that spawns the rare inventions that destroy or \nsupplant existing business models. It is not always easy to identify \nan innovation. The mapping of the human genome, for example, \nwas hailed at the time as a radical innovation to provide new \ntreatments for diseases, but it turned out to be only an incremental \nstep in that direction. Using something already known\u2014but in a \ndifferent way or at a different time or place\u2014is also an innovation. \nFinally, innovation encompasses a wide range of activities \ncarried out by a wide variety of actors: firms, governments, \nnongovernment organizations, and individuals.\nBecause innovation is a complex, diverse, and multifaceted \nconcept, it comes as no surprise that measuring it is also \ncomplicated. Survey respondents in different countries may have \ndiverse understanding of innovation, with firms in developing \ncountries perhaps considering a minor design change as a new or \nsignificantly improved product, though the same change would \ngo all but unnoticed in more advanced economies (Cirera and \nMaloney 2017).\nWhat is innovation?\nThe Oslo Manual 2018 defines innovation as a \u201cnew or improved \nproduct or business process (or combination thereof) that differs \nsignificantly from the firm\u2019s previous products or business \nprocesses and that has been introduced on the market or brought \ninto use by the firm.\u201d1 This is a measurable definition that forms a \nsolid basis for analysis at the level of the individual\u00a0firm.\nWhile a rich typology has been developed over the years \nto reflect the multifaceted nature of innovation, this chapter \nfocuses on four key concepts that are particularly relevant \nto the Asian\u00a0experience. First is the distinction between \nproduct and process innovation, which stems directly from the \ndefinition provided in the Oslo Manual 2018. Product innovation \nrefers to an improvement in the performance of a product \nor new features in a product, often visible to the customers. ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)59\nProcess\u00a0innovation\u00a0refers\u00a0to\u00a0an improvement in how the \nproduct is produced, which can include changes all along the \nvalue chain but is often invisible to customers.\nThe distinction between frontier and catch-up innovation \nis particularly important in developing economies. Frontier \ninnovation is defined as the first application of a specific \ninnovation in the world. It can be either radical or incremental \n(but, as mentioned above, most innovation is incremental). \nFigure\u00a02.1.1 shows that, when advanced countries push \nthe frontier of innovation, they improve global technology. \nCatch-up innovation, on the other hand, is the first application \nin a specific context, perhaps a particular country or firm, \nof an innovation that already exists elsewhere in the world. \nCatch-up innovations are crucial to improving productivity in \ndeveloping countries.\nFigure 2.1.1\u2002 Catch-up versus frontier innovation\nL, labor\nGlobal technology frontier\nB\nFrontier innovations by\ntechnologically advanced\nA countries improve global\ntechnology  \nD\nCatch-up innovations allow\nC developing countries to move\ntoward the global technology frontier\nK, capital\nSource: Authors.\nAlthough they differ slightly in their definitions, frugal \ninnovation, inclusive innovation, and bottom-of-the-pyramid \ninnovation all refer to solutions that address the needs of \nlow-income populations. They can be high-tech, such as digital \nplatforms that bring services to underserved communities, \nor low-tech, such as a terracotta clay refrigerator that keeps \nperishable food cool without electricity. They can emerge \nfrom the efforts of firms, governments, nongovernment \norganizations, or individuals.", "60(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nFinally, sustainable innovation integrates consideration of \nhow environmentally, socially, and financially appropriate an \ninnovation is, from idea generation to R&D and all the way to \ncommercialization. Environmentally sustainable innovation \nincludes techniques to reduce waste, use recycled inputs and \nalternative energy sources, and reduce, reuse, and sequester \nthe greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Jeepneys and tuk-tuks\npowered by electricity or liquefied petroleum gas that promote \na cleaner environment and improve the quality of life for the \npoor are examples of innovations that are both sustainable and \ninclusive.\nInnovation in Asia: past and present\nDeveloping Asia has a rich tradition of innovation. In fact, \nmankind can thank the region for many innovations that have \nprofoundly affected the course of world history. The four\u00a0great \ninventions of ancient Chinese civilization\u2014papermaking, \nprinting, gunpowder, and the compass\u2014are well-known \nexamples. Another case in point is the mathematical concept of \nzero, which originated in the Indian subcontinent. Asia\u00a0began \nto fall behind the West in the 15th century, however, and the \ngap widened further with Europe\u2019s industrial revolution. \nAs\u00a0a\u00a0result, Asia needed to catch up technologically.\nOver the past 50 years, rapid and sustained growth, \ndevelopment, and technological progress have moved Asia \nand the Pacific much closer to the global technology frontier. \nThe region is no longer just an importer of advanced foreign \ninnovations but has increasingly become a globally significant \ninnovator. In line with its rising share of global income, the role \nof developing Asia in global innovation is clearly on the rise. \nWhile there are substantial differences across subregions and \ncountries, the region as a whole is investing more in innovative \nactivity and producing more innovative output.\nOne indication is that Asia\u2019s share of research and \ndevelopment (R&D) investment rose from 22% in 1996 to \n40% in 2017, according to the Global Innovation Index (2019). \nThe\u00a0shifting geography of innovation is evident in the swift rise \nof several Asian economies among the 129 economies chosen \nfor comparison and listed in the Index. In 2019, the Republic\u00a0of \nKorea (ROK) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) edged \ncloser toward inclusion in the world\u2019s top 10 innovators, \nperforming especially well in the categories patents by origin, \nindustrial designs, trademarks by origin, high-tech net exports, \nand creative goods exports. Other strong regional performers \nwere India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, \nin addition to the more advanced economies of Singapore and \nHong Kong, China.\nThe 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index\u2014which ranks the \nworld\u2019s most innovative 95 countries based on R&D spending, ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)61\nmanufacturing capability, and concentration of high-tech \npublic companies\u2014ranks the ROK at 2, Singapore at 3, Japan at \n12, and the PRC at 15. In the Nature Index 2019, which tracks \narticles published in 82 high-quality journals in the natural \nsciences, the PRC ranked second, after the US. The PRC holds \na similar position in Clarivate\u2019s 2019 Annual G20 Scorecard \nfor the most highly cited researchers. Interestingly, the report \nfound that, while Australia leads the pack in terms of research \noutput, Indonesia achieved a threefold increase in a decade.\nInnovation and economic growth and \ndevelopment: theory and evidence\nInnovation can improve productivity by extracting greater \noutput from the same inputs, thereby generating more goods \nand services and higher wages, profitability, and economic \ngrowth. Early studies that built on the seminal work of \nSolow\u00a0(1956) concluded that long-run growth comes mainly \nfrom technical change, which can be continually renewed, \nrather than from labor and capital, which suffer decreasing \nmarginal productivity.2\nTwo defining characteristics of technology are that its use \nby one firm or person in no way limits its use by another, yet \nit can be made exclusive by preventing access to those who \nhave not paid for it. This provides private firms with a strong \nincentive to innovate. These two features of new ideas generate \nhigher returns as the scale of production increases, and this is \nwhat sustains growth in the long run (Romer 1990).\nTo understand the nature of technical change and how \nit evolves over time, growth accounting exercises were \naugmented with an innovation component that found \nstrong links between R&D capital, for example, and growth \n(Griliches\u00a01980a, Mansfield 1980).\nThe frontier in economic thinking was further pushed by \nendogenous growth models that included other representations \nof innovation such as R&D investment by private firms, \nlearning by doing, human capital and knowledge accumulation, \nand public infrastructure (Romer 1986 and 1990, Lucas 1988, \nAghion and Howitt 1992, Barro 1990, Grossman and Helpman \n1994). These models suggest that innovation within an entity \nand positive spillover to the rest of the economy can drive \nsustainable, long-term economic growth, and that these factors \nare generated by economic incentives within the system. \nA\u00a0branch of the literature focused on the interaction between \ncompetition and innovation, as well as the critical role played \nby private firms, which have implications for a country\u2019s \nindustrial and technology policy (Aghion et al. 2005, Aghion, \nCarlin, and Schaffer 2002). The prescriptions and debates \nthat ensued from these models accommodated the observed ", "62(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\ngrowth trajectories of Japan, Germany, and the US starting in \nthe 1950s and, subsequently in the 1980s, of Hong Kong, China; \nthe Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. They have \nbecome relevant more recently to the PRC. The\u00a0general pattern \nof innovation in Asian economies is an initial phase of catch-up \ninnovation with the adoption of technology to generate \nprogress and growth, followed by a later phase of growth \ndriven by their own innovation (ADB 2020).\nHowever, inquiry found conventional assumptions and \ntheories far removed from the experiences of other developing \neconomies grappling with social and environmental problems \nand serious scarcity of resources. This called for a different \nalignment of innovation models driven by the needs of \nlow-income and price-sensitive consumers in developing \neconomies, and a strong discourse for inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. The consensus was that, if innovation is \nhighly capital- and energy-intensive and requires superior \ninfrastructure and other networks, skilled labor, abundant \ncredit, and demand for complex products, the world\u2019s poor \nhave little hope of benefiting from innovation and its impact on \ngrowth (Chataway, Hanlin, and Kaplinsky 2014). Given massive \ndisparity in the needs and capabilities of different economies, \neven within a single region like Asia, one-size-fits-all policy \nprescriptions appear to be sorely inadequate.\nAs a result, links between innovation, capacity creation, and \ndevelopment emerged as a critical concern for policy\u00a0makers. \nSo too did complementarity in the innovation process between \nmarkets and players outside of them, such as the public sector \nand nongovernment organizations. Turning away from a focus \non technological advance as the basis of growth, research \nexplored alternate trajectories in the literature of economics \nand other fields. The existence of alternate trajectories \ncontested long-established models and upended the belief \nthat only advanced countries innovate. These\u00a0trajectories \nfeature instead strategies crafted to incorporate the \nstrengths of developing countries toward answering their \nneeds. Alternate\u00a0strategies innovate in accordance with \nindustry dynamics unique to economies with abundant \nnatural resources (Andersen, Mar\u00ecn, and Simensen 2018), \ngrassroot community action for solutions that are inclusive \nand sensitive to context (Seyfang and Smith 2007), or efforts \nto build capacity for technology adaptation, development, \nand implementation, often through incremental and frugal \ninnovations (Katz and Shapiro 1987, Wooldridge\u00a02010). \nThe\u00a0incremental and frugal innovations deployed in the near \nterm may be augmented over the longer term by institutional \nadjustments, targeted public investments, and education \n(ADB\u00a02014, Calestous and Lee 2005).", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)63\nWhy does innovation matter \nfor\u00a0developing\u00a0Asia?\nThe preceding discussion makes evident several clear theoretical \nand empirical links between innovation and economic \ndevelopment. At the same time, it has shown how developing Asia \nhas revived as the center of global innovation. Why then does \ninnovation matter so much for developing Asia right now?\nFirst, rapid and sustained growth has transformed \ndeveloping Asia into a region that is overwhelmingly middle \nincome, at which stage innovation assumes a larger role in \neconomic growth. Second, innovation can help improve the \nquality of growth and of life in the region by making growth \nmore inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The following \nsummarizes the importance of innovation to Asia at this stage \nin its development and the specific ways that innovation can \nsupport development in the region.\nInnovation plays a larger role in growth as economies reach \nmiddle income. Rapid and sustained growth transformed \ndeveloping Asia from a largely low-income region in 1991 \nto one overwhelmingly middle income by 2015 (ADB 2017). \nWhile\u00a0labor and capital are still necessary for growth in \nmiddle-income economies, growth in total factor productivity \nbecomes\u00a0more important to economic success. Figure\u00a02.1.2\u00a0shows \nthat growth in Asia has relied increasingly on total factor \nproductivity as it has become increasingly middle income. \nAnd\u00a0innovation\u00a0is a\u00a0vital\u00a0ingredient of productivity growth. \nFigure 2.1.2\u2002C  ontribution to growth by factor of production in Asia, % of total\nCapital input\nLabor input\nHuman capital\nTFP\n15.0\n21.9\n40.8\n31.2\n12.3\n17.7 9.2\n8.1\n60.4\n48.2\n41.8\n\u20136.6\n1970\u20131985 1995\u20132005 2010\u20132017\nGDP = gross domestic product, TFP = total factor productivity. \nNotes: Central Asia is excluded in 1970\u20131985.

In 2017, \nthese 25\u00a0economies accounted for 99% of the combined GDP of Asian\u00a0Development Bank developing \nmember economies plus Japan. \nSource: ADB 2020.", "64(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nMiddle-income\u00a0economies that graduate to high income have \nR&D establishments three times bigger than economies mired \nin the middle-income trap, for example, and they file four \ntimes more patent applications (ADB 2017). The way forward \nfor developing Asia is directed by the experience of Asian \nnewly industrialized economies (NIEs) such as the ROK, which \nleveraged innovation to transition to high income after only \n23\u00a0years in the middle-income category.\nInnovation can make growth inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable. Recognition is growing in developing Asia that \neconomic growth that manages to benefit only a small elite \nwhile degrading the environment cannot be sustained in the \nlong run. Innovation can make growth more broadly based \nand able to improve the quality of life and extend productive \nopportunities to the disadvantaged. As discussed above, \nwhile innovation tends to be associated with state-of-the-art \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence or robotics, plenty \nof inexpensive, bottom-of-the-pyramid innovations are \nable to help the poor tackle the everyday challenges of life. \nFurther, innovation to improve energy, transport, and other \ninfrastructure can contribute to a cleaner environment.\nImportant at all stages of development, innovation will \nvary by stage. The potential gains from innovation are large \nin terms of supplying jobs and boosting productivity, incomes, \nand economic growth. Developing Asia as a region will reap \nlarge economic benefits from innovation. But a country\u2019s stage \nof economic and technological development determines the \nnature and scope of innovation available to it. Lower-income \nAsian countries that fall far short of the global technology \nfrontier can best accelerate their development by tapping \nexisting knowledge and know-how and adapting them to local \nneeds (Figure 2.1.1). To enable themselves to do so effectively, \nthey must nurture their technology absorption capacity to \nensure its adequacy. Upper-middle-income Asian countries, \non the other hand, need to invest much more in frontier-\npushing innovation because adopting existing technology and \nknow-how offers them only diminishing returns, and they are \nable to push against the global technology frontier because \nthey are closer to it\u2014as illustrated by explosive growth in R&D \ninvestment in the PRC in recent years. Whether innovations \npush the frontier or are far from it, they serve as engines of \ntechnological, economic, and social progress.\nNew tech and value chains leapfrog to the global \ntechnology frontier. While the scope and nature of innovation \ndepends on a country\u2019s stage of development, new technologies, \nparticularly information and communication technology (ICT), \ncan accelerate the catch-up process in lower-income countries. \nDeveloping Asia is a global leader in the production and \nconsumption of ICT, which has permeated every facet of life \nin the region and supported many innovations large and small, ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)65\nas it will continue to do. One notable example is how quickly \nthe PRC is becoming a cashless society where you can use your \nmobile phone for every transaction, even giving alms to street \nbeggars. Asia can foster innovation by leveraging its openness \nto trade and active participation in global value chains, which \ncan be powerful channels for knowledge transfer to developing \ncountries, accelerating their catch-up and advance to the global \ntechnology frontier.\nInnovation is key to a better quality of life and more \ndynamic societies. While innovations make Asian firms more \nproductive, they also enhance the well-being of Asian people. \nThe advent of ICT is a powerful case in point. The internet and \nmobile phones have dramatically reduced communication costs \nfor producers and consumers alike. An innovative economy \nis often the bounty of an innovative society that encourages \nthe free and open exchange of ideas and knowledge. Further, \ninnovations and technological progress can contribute to more \ndynamic and vibrant Asian societies, in which Asians are \nconstantly asking new questions and seeking new solutions.", "66(cid:30)(cid:30)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nLandscape of innovation\u00a0in\u00a0Asia\nThis section examines in more detail the current landscape \nof innovation in Asia. It begins by looking at how aggregate \ninnovation in the region stacks up against other parts of \nthe world. Data at the level of the individual firm permits \na deeper inquiry into the nature of innovation within the \nregion. For example, do firm size and export orientation \naffect the propensity to innovate among Asian firms? \nRegression\u00a0analysis\u00a0empirically reveals the determinants of \ninnovation in developing Asia. What is the effect on innovation \nin the region of human capital, for instance, or of research and \ndevelopment (R&D) and other variables? \nThe current state of innovation in Asia: \nan\u00a0aggregate perspective\nIn the past, developing Asia adopted innovations and superior \ntechnologies from advanced economies in Japan, the US, and \nWestern Europe to power its industrialization and economic \ngrowth. The exact mechanism through which Asian economies \nimported foreign innovations differed from country to \ncountry. Singapore leveraged foreign direct investment by \nlarge multinational corporations, for example, while the ROK \ncapitalized on domestic firms\u2019 licensing of foreign technology. \nAlthough the mechanism varied, the region imported and \nadapted more advanced foreign technology for its own needs. \nIt\u00a0remained far from the global technology frontier, and many \nof its innovations were incremental innovations. However, \ndespite relative lack of indigenous innovation, the NIEs, \nthe\u00a0PRC, and other economies were able to effectively absorb \nand use foreign innovations, and this contributed to their rapid \nand sustained growth.\nAfter a country reaches a certain stage of economic and \ntechnological development, it begins to invest in frontier \ninnovation. The experience of the NIEs fits this established \npattern of steady graduation from catch-up innovation to \nfrontier innovation. The ROK, for example, has become one \nof the most innovative economies in the world, and other \nAsian\u00a0economies, most notably the PRC, are following the path \nblazed by the ROK and other Asian NIEs. More broadly, rapid \nand sustained growth has transformed developing Asia into an \noverwhelmingly middle-income region that has achieved a lot \nof technological progress. It is therefore outdated to credit the \nstereotype of developing Asia as a region that innovates little \non its own.", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)67\nFigure 2.2.1\u2002R&D expenditure as a share of GDP by region, 2016\n% of GDP\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\nDeveloping Asia World, excluding World Latin America OECD\ndeveloping Asia and the Caribbean\nGDP = gross domestic product, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, R&D = research and development.\nSource: ADB estimates using data from the World Development Indicators database.\nIn fact, the data indicate that developing Asia is no \nlonger at the periphery of the global innovation landscape \nbut rapidly moving toward its center.

As noted \nabove, most innovation in developing economies occurs well \ninside the global technology frontier. Adapting advanced \nforeign technology to specific local requirements usually does \nnot involve R&D or generate patents or licensing income. \nSuch innovation nevertheless played a major role in the past \nindustrialization and technological progress of the NIEs and \nthe PRC. Therefore, conventional measures of innovation \nsuch\u00a0as R&D and patents may significantly underestimate the \nextent of innovation in developing economies.\nThe current state of innovation in Asia: \na\u00a0\ufb01rm-level perspective \nAn extensive empirical literature highlights the positive impact \nof innovation in individual firms, including R&D, on firm \nperformance and productivity (Hall, Lotti, and Mairesse 2009, \nHarrison et al. 2008, Mairesse, Mohnen, and Kremp 2005, \nRaffo, L\u2019huillery, and Miotti 2008). The literature shows that \nknowledge capital investments to boost productivity do not \noccur solely in advanced countries. However, the nature of \ninnovation in developing countries is somewhat different and \nbest characterized as piecemeal improvements to processes \nor products (Cirera and Maloney 2017). This is a process of \ntechnology adoption, imitation, and adaptation that takes \nplace far from the technology frontier, where firms adopt \nincremental changes (Fagerberg, Srholec, and Verspagen 2010). ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:30)(cid:30)71\nWhile innovation in developing countries often occurs at \nthe margins and depends on implementing technologies and \nproducts already available elsewhere, this process can still \nenable the development of comparative advantage. However, \nlittle is known about the nature of activities and processes by \nwhich firms in developing Asia foster innovation. This section \ndescribes the extent and intensity of firm-level innovation in \ndeveloping Asia. It explores where innovation is occurring in \nthe region and examines firm characteristics associated with \nhigher innovation rates. It also examines firms\u2019 activities such \nas R&D and technology use to reveal variation in innovation \nby industry and firm characteristics. This study aims to paint \na picture of firms\u2019 innovative behavior in developing Asia and \nhow their characteristics relate to innovation.\nFor each economy, analysis uses the latest available\u00a0year \nof the World Bank Enterprise Surveys to describe the \ninnovation behavior of firms in developing Asia (Table\u00a02.2.1). \nThe survey dataset is comparable across economies and \navailable from\u00a02004. It provides the density of new business \nregistrations adjusted for population and compiles data \nprimarily from face-to-face interviews with business owners \nand top managers, as well as correspondence with participating \nbusiness registrars. The survey uses stratified random sampling \norganized by firm size, business sector, and geographic region \nwithin a country, defining innovation rates as the share of \nfirms introducing product or process innovations.3 It covers \n27\u00a0countries in developing Asia, including 26,855 firms in \nmanufacturing, retail, and other services (Table 2.2.1).4\nInnovation data from the Enterprise Surveys suffer from \nsubjectivity regarding what constitutes a new or significantly \nimproved product or process. A lack of follow-up questions \nto provide detail on the accuracy of answers may thus \ngive an inaccurate picture of firms\u2019 innovation activities \nand overestimate innovation rates (Cirera and Muzi 2016). \nDespite\u00a0these limitations, the survey is the most useful option \nbecause it covers a wide set of countries in developing\u00a0Asia \nand uses a standard survey questionnaire and similar \nsampling\u00a0methodology and populations of inference, which \nallow cross-country comparisons of firms. \nDeeper analysis of the survey data outlines the landscape of \ninnovation in developing Asia. Outstanding features include a \nrelatively strong degree of firm-level innovation in the region, \na tendency for innovation rates to be higher in low-income \ncountries, and a predominance of small improvements to \nexisting products, as opposed to the introduction of new \nproducts in new markets.

Indeed, the history of \nmankind is basically one of innovations, from the first fire and \nsharp-edged tools to the wheel, the compass, and the internal \ncombustion engine, and on to space rockets and the internet. \nAll these great inventions are testaments to human ingenuity. \nA\u00a0prerequisite for an innovative society is therefore a large pool \nof creative innovators who are willing to ask new questions \nand seek alternative solutions. A sound education system that \nencourages curiosity, originality, and new ways of thinking \nhelps create a pool of potential innovators. Another important \nsource of innovation is high-quality entrepreneurship as \nepitomized by Steve Jobs of Apple and Jack Ma of Alibaba. \nAs these examples illustrate, information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) has dramatically expanded opportunities for \ninnovative entrepreneurship.\nThis section first provides empirical evidence of the \nrelationship between human capital and innovation at the \nfirm level in developing Asia. Next, it focuses on the role of \neducation in nurturing future innovators and the critical \nchallenges that education systems in the region face in \nfulfilling that role. Finally, because innovators need the \nright entrepreneurial ecosystem to convert their ideas into \nmarketable products and services, the discussion turns \nto the basic framework and grounded assumptions of \nentrepreneurship and innovation.\nThe role of human capital in innovation: \nevidence from \ufb01rms\nHuman capital strengthens the capacity of a firm to absorb \nand develop new knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990, \nSmith,\u00a0Collins, and Clark 2005), which makes it essential to \ninnovation, both at the frontier and catching up to it. In\u00a0fact, \neven when they use technologies and products already available \nelsewhere, firms still need a workforce with the appropriate \nskills and knowledge. While policies such as R&D tax credits \nand direct public funding may boost innovation in the short\u00a0run, \nit is more effective in the long run to increase the stock of \nhuman capital (Bloom, Van Reenen, and Williams 2019).", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)83\nPrevious studies found a robust positive association between \nhuman capital and innovation output, but their proxies for \nhuman\u00a0capital were often restricted to formal schooling (Ayyagari, \nDemirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt, and Maksimovic 2011, Robson, Haugh, and Obeng \n2009, Toner\u00a02011). Increasing\u00a0the stock of human capital through \ntraining sponsored by firms often engenders greater innovation \n(Dostie\u00a02018). Employee schooling and the provision of training \nimprove human capital within a firm and positively influence \ninnovation output, as does slack time made available for such \ncreative activities as ideation, experimentation, and prototype \ndevelopment (van Uden, Knoben, and Vermeulen 2017).\nWhile firm-level surveys for several economies in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia offer detailed information on innovative activity \nand human capital, cross-country analysis is made extremely \nchallenging by differences in survey instruments, sampling \nmethodology, and populations of reference. World\u00a0Bank Enterprise \nSurveys, on the other hand, have somewhat less detailed indicators \nof innovation and human capital, but they cover a substantial \nnumber of Asian economies. These surveys are therefore useful to \nexplore the relationship between a firm\u2019s propensity to innovate \nand its human capital, the latter proxied by employee educational \nattainment, employee training, and the industry-specific \nexperience of the top manager, which is a neglected but important \nattribute when studying innovation. Another question to explore \nis whether offering training to employees has greater impact on \nfirm-level innovation when a firm\u2019s operations are constrained \nby the inadequate skills of its workers. Box\u00a02.3.1 discusses the \nempirical specification for this analysis.\nBox 2.3.1\u2002The role of human capital in innovation: empirical approach\nThe following equation was used to estimate a linear  and defined curriculum.

However, it can be assumed that, \nif education systems are not managing to develop even these \nbasic skills, they are very unlikely to be developing higher-\norder skills such as problem solving and critical thinking.\nGiven the huge variation in learning outcomes across \ndeveloping Asia, any economy wishing to drive innovation \nthrough its education system needs to assess the current state \nof this system. Economies achieving good outcomes have a \nrange of options to foster innovation. Those where learning \noutcomes are low, on the other hand, need to acknowledge \nthis weakness and focus on improving the quality of basic \neducation. Without\u00a0basic foundational skills including literacy \nand numeracy, it\u00a0is almost impossible for students to go on and \nachieve higher learning.\nTo develop the education system, policy makers need to \nensure that learning outcomes are measured and that the \neducation system is sufficiently aligned with the goal of \nimproved learning. Facing up to the learning crisis can be \npainful for governments and societies, but if it is not done, \ncountries are left unable to embrace the innovation needed to \ndrive development.\nShift teaching practices to develop \ninnovation\u00a0capabilities\nInnovation requires a range of capabilities that can be grouped \ninto two categories: \u201copening capabilities\u201d and \u201cclosing \ncapabilities.\u201d5 Both kinds are needed in the general population \nand in leadership positions (Figure\u00a02.3.3).\nFigure 2.3.3\u2002Opening and closing innovation capabilities\np \u2022  Openness to questioning \u2022  Monitoring and enforcing goal attainment\nshi \u2022  Failure tolerance \u2022  Results focus\ner\nd \u2022  Consultative management style \u2022  Performance management\na\ne\nL\nOpening Innovation Capability Closing Innovation Capability\nn\no\nati\nul\nop \u2022  Creativity \u2022  Grit\nP\n\u2022  Problem solving \u2022  Perseverance  \n\u2022  Critical thinking \u2022  Long-term orientation  \nSource: Newman, Gentile, and dela Cruz, forthcoming.", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)89\nOpening capabilities are the set of skills and approaches \nrequired to enable the generation of new ideas. Ordinarily, they \nare a range of overlapping \u201csoft skills\u201d such as creativity, problem \nsolving, evidence literacy, and critical thinking (Ueki and Guaita \nMart\u00ednez 2019, Saidi et al. 2019, Brazdauskas\u00a02015). However, \nhaving innovative people with strong opening capabilities in \nan organization is not sufficient. Also needed is an enabling \nenvironment created by leaders who possess capabilities such\u00a0as \nopenness to questioning, failure tolerance, and a consultative \nmanagement style (Barsh, Capozzi, and Davidson 2008, Burpitt \nand Bigoness 1997, Lewis, Ricard, and Klijn 2018, Fischer et\u00a0al. \n2018, Baer and Frese 2003). These\u00a0leadership attributes are \ncritical, as innovation often fails not for lack of innovative ideas \nbut because leaders have not created an environment that enables \ninnovation to flourish. Indeed, evidence exists that having people \nwith many new ideas in an organization that does not enable \ninnovation can actually hinder performance more than having no \ninnovative people at all (Baer and Frese 2003).\nClosing capabilities, on the other hand, are the set of \nskills and approaches needed to see an innovation through to \ncompletion. In a population, they include such attributes as grit, \nperseverance, and long-term orientation. They enable people to \npush forward the implementation of new ideas even in the face \nof challenges. In leadership, the attributes include the ability to \nmonitor and enforce goal attainment, a\u00a0strong focus on results, \nand performance management.\nAs innovations proceed through organizations, a gradual \nshift will see less time spent on opening processes and more time \non closing processes. This requires careful balancing by leaders \nin particular, as the approaches that enable opening may conflict \nwith those that facilitate closing (Bledow\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02009). \nSome of the capabilities needed for innovation are influenced \nby culture, so different countries need to consider where their \nstrengths and opportunities lie (Bledow\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02009). For\u00a0example, \nfailure intolerance is a particular issue in parts of Asia, where \npeople tend to harbor more fear of failure than in other parts \nof the world (OECD 2019). Indeed, a number of countries in the \nregion now explicitly nurture tolerance of failure. Recent results \nfrom Hubner et al. (forthcoming) highlights differences in the \ndistribution of innovation capabilities across Asia and the Pacific. \nThe study observed that teams in the PRC were particularly \nstrong in closing capability but weaker in opening capability, \nwhile teams in India had the opposite distribution.\nFor decades, education experts have discussed how \npedagogical approaches affect learning. One way to consider \nteaching approaches is to see them as a continuum running \nfrom teacher-centered approaches, which use traditional and \ndidactic\u00a0techniques to impart knowledge, to learner-centered \napproaches, which use more interactive approaches that help \nstudents direct their own learning (Weimer 2013, Brown 2003).

The theory is that \nenabling students to experiment, seek out information, and \nsolve\u00a0problems imparts skills that can be applied throughout \ntheir lives.\nNo globally comparable data exists on teaching practice. \nStudies have been carried out using ratings by observers, \nteachers, or students, but it is unclear how comparable these \nscores are across cultures. Evidence from cross-cultural \ncomparisons has found that self-reported cultural values are \nnot a good indicator of cultural practices, as ratings are greatly \naffected by cultural norms (Taras et al. 2010) and the same \nproblem may affect data on teaching practice (Aldridge et al. \n2000, among others).\nTable 2.3.2 presents a traffic light assessment of teaching \npractice in selected economies in Asia and the Pacific. \nTwo indicators are chosen to assess the degree of learner-\ncenteredness in teaching practice and are graded using \nqualitative descriptions from classroom observation studies: \n\u201cgroup work and interactive learning\u201d and \u201cstimulation of \nhigher-order thinking.\u201d These teaching practices are known \nto stimulate opening innovation capabilities in students \n(Scott\u00a02015).

This is consistent with other studies that \nchallenge the stereotype of Asian education as uniformly \ndidactic and dependent on rote learning (Takayama\u00a02017, \nYou\u00a02019). A number of Asian economies have teaching \npractices that are both poor quality and teacher-centered. \nDeveloping high-quality, learner-centered teaching strategies \nwill help these economies to improve both opening and closing \ninnovation capabilities. Other economies achieve high learning \noutcomes using relatively teacher-centered approaches. \nPolicy\u00a0makers in these economies may wish to promote the \nfurther evolution of teaching practice to optimize innovation \ncapabilities.", "92(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nAchieving change in pedagogical practice is notoriously \ndifficult (Weimer 2013). Attempts by external actors to \ntransplant learner-centered practices developed in one culture \ninto an entirely different one have usually failed to achieve the \nintended outcomes (Schweisfurth 2013). Even where learner-\ncentered rhetoric has been adopted by policy makers, this \nmay translate into a relatively superficial impact on actual \nteaching practice (You 2019, Brinkmann 2019). However, \npolicy\u00a0makers across the region have scope to consider the \ntypes of capabilities their society needs and to design culturally \nembedded approaches to teaching and learning to develop \nthem. There is nothing particularly Western about educational \npractices that can drive innovation. Cultural practices \ninfluence teaching practice across Asia and can contribute to \ndeveloping innovative capabilities. For example, Confucius \nadvocated that learners should take ownership of their learning \nand develop higher-order thinking skills, and this has had a \nstrong influence on teaching in the PRC (Tan 2015). Similarly, \nIndia celebrates jugaad, or improvisation to create solutions \nwhen constraints are harsh or resources limited. This clearly \nencourages problem solving and experimentation (Prabhu and \nJain 2015).\nIn recent decades, countries across Asia have exerted \nconsiderable effort to shift their educational practices toward \nstrengthening innovative capability. Singapore initiated its \nThinking Schools, Learning Nation reform in 1997 and its \nTeach Less and Learn More policy in 2006 (Takayama 2017). \nThe PRC\u00a0initiated its New Curriculum Reform in 2001 with \nthe aim of promoting \u201cpupils\u2019 creative and critical spirits and \ncapabilities\u201d (You 2019). Japan introduced initiatives designed \nto promote \u201czest for living\u201d and \u201clow pressure, room for \ngrowth\u201d in\u00a02002 (Takayama 2017). Philippine basic education \npolicy states that \u201cevery graduate of basic education shall be \nan empowered individual who has learned\u2026 the capability \nto engage in autonomous, creative, and critical thinking\u201d \n(Care\u00a0and Luo 2016).\nPolicy\u00a0makers need to be realistic and bear in mind that \nachieving change in pedagogical practice can be challenging. \nHowever, only by fostering new ways of teaching and by \ninvesting in new approaches in schools can Asian countries \ntackle the learning crisis and forge ahead to bolster innovative \ncapability.\nBroaden and diversify the skills mix\nNo single formula exists for blending school subjects to drive \ninnovation. The ability to experiment and test ideas, which \ncan be developed through effective science, technology, \nengineering, and math (STEM) teaching, is certainly \nimportant for innovation. Experts warn, however, against ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)93\noveremphasizing STEM subjects at the expense of those \nthat can develop creativity, such as art and design, or critical \nthinking, such as social science and humanities. In fact, the \nliterature suggests that a mix of different skills is key to\u00a0driving \ninnovation (Toner\u00a02011).\nInnovation in some sectors requires advanced technical \nskills and therefore requires graduates with qualifications \nas high as doctoral degrees (Marvel and Lumpkin 2007, \nLarson\u00a02011, Toner\u00a02011). It is almost impossible for someone \nto develop an innovative treatment for malaria, for example, \nwithout first honing advanced skills in microbiology and \npharmacology. Similarly, innovations in car manufacturing are \nlikely to come only from someone highly skilled in engineering. \nHowever, innovation in services or the public sector may \ndepend less on technical skills than on general management \nand business skills (Marvel and Lumpkin 2007, Toner 2011). \nPolicy\u00a0makers need to assess which skills are needed and \nensure the availability of mechanisms to link the tertiary \neducation provided with the needs of industry.\nAlso important is to maintain diversity in skills, as \ninnovation often results when different skill sets collide. \nOne\u00a0way to achieve this is for individuals to develop skills in \nmore than one area. A doctor with skills in coding may be \nexcellently prepared to identify novel approaches to digital \nhealth delivery, for example, as would an architect with \nknowledge of social development to identify and overcome \nphysical barriers to inclusion. The\u00a0advantages of developing \nmore than one area of expertise are demonstrated by a \nstudy that found students pursuing dual majors are more \ninnovative than those focused on a single major (Selznick and \nMayhew\u00a02018).\nSome universities are now exploring how to guide students \nalong more flexible learning journeys that allow them to \ndevelop skills across disciplines. In the PRC, for example, a \nnumber of prestigious universities are attempting to make \nundergraduate learning more diverse. Fudan University has \nchanged the undergraduate curriculum to allow students \nto study a broad range of subjects in their first 2 years \nbefore having to choose a specialization in their third year. \nSimilarly,\u00a0Yuanpei\u00a0College\u00a0at\u00a0Peking University requires \nstudents\u00a0to take general education courses in one of four \nareas: humanities, social issues, science, and art (Godwin and \nPickus\u00a02017). Another\u00a0approach to stimulate innovation is \nto supplement single major studies with courses specifically \ndesigned to build innovation skills (Wright et al. 2007, \nThongpravati, Maritz, and Stoddart 2016).", "94(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nEntrepreneurship and innovation \nin\u00a0developing Asia\nHow entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic \ndevelopment interact is more complex than is often thought. \nEntrepreneurs are a mixed bag, as are the teams they form \nand the new businesses they create. Most entrepreneurs are \nnot economically innovative, as few create new jobs in any \nsignificant number or have the means to be productive.\nA telling discovery is that only a small minority of new \nfirms in any cohort, dubbed \u201cgazelles,\u201d are responsible for \na disproportionate share of employment generation (Birch, \nHaggerty, and Parsons 1997).\nThis section looks closely at what determines the \nproductivity potential of entrepreneurial ecosystems. \nThe\u00a0hypothesis is that institutional conditions can shape the \nproductivity potential of new entrepreneurial firms through \ntheir impact on entry decisions and on post-entry choices \nregarding the pursuit of innovation and growth.\nNot all \ufb01rms are born equal\nData on entrepreneurial startups in a set of ADB developing \nmember economies show that, although only 0.4% of new \nentrepreneurial businesses had grown enough to have 250+ \nemployees within 42 months, these firms provided 44% of \nnew jobs created by this group. In contrast, 54% of all new \nbusinesses employed no more than two people and created \nonly 9% of new jobs. Obvious questions ask what drives this \nheterogeneity and whether it is possible to design policy \nmeasures that effectively help new entrepreneurial firms \nfulfill their productivity potential and thus better contribute \nto economic development. This\u00a0does not imply that micro \nfirms are unimportant. Although\u00a0their job creation is limited, \nthey nevertheless provide an important number of livelihoods, \nparticularly in situations where individuals may have few \nalternatives.\nNew entrepreneurial firms are defined as companies \nlaunched and owner-managed by individuals or groups of \nindividuals. Table\u00a02.3.3 shows that new entrepreneurial \nbusinesses vary considerably in terms of their dominant \nactivity; their patterns of innovative activity; how locationally \nspecific their activities, resources, and markets are; and their \nresulting productivity potential and ability to contribute \nto economic development. One\u00a0type of entrepreneurial \nbusiness\u00a0is worth highlighting: new\u00a0digital\u00a0ventures.

A panel regression empirically \nassesses at the country level the impact of institutions, including \nentry regulations, on informal entrepreneurial activity\u2014that is, the \ncreation of new firms without entering them on business registers. \nData\u00a0from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and World\u00a0Bank \nEnterprise Surveys are combined to construct country-level \nestimates of the population density of formal and informal entries.\nTable 2.3.4 presents the results of three estimation models \nshowing the impact on outcomes of interest from entry regulations, \nproperty rights protection, and the rule of law. Entry barriers \ninclude the number of registration procedures, the cost of \nregistration, and the minimum paid-in capital needed to start a \nbusiness in a particular country. Outcomes of interest are formal \nentry, defined as the population density of formal business \nregistrations, and informal entry, defined as the population density \nof informal business entries.\nThe results in Table 2.3.4 support the notion that \nentrepreneurs choose informality if property right protection \nand the legal environment are weak. The number of registration \nprocedures significantly influenced formal registrations but not \ncorrespondingly informal entries. Other\u00a0dimensions of entry \nregulation had no significant effect, though one should note that \nthe analysis focused on a relatively small sample of economies \nin developing Asia. The analysis nonetheless provides evidence \nsuggesting that the rules of the game affect the allocation of \nentrepreneurial effort and, therefore, the productivity potential of \nnew entrepreneurial businesses (Baumol 1996, Murphy, Schleifer, \nand Vishny 1991).\nA large informal sector makes formal \ufb01rms less\u00a0productive\nHigh density of informal entrepreneurial entries constitutes \nfor formally registered entrepreneurs a negative externality \nbecause unfair competition undermines their willingness to \ninnovate and grow their enterprises.

It\u00a0analyzed the \nrole of the education system and the entrepreneurial ecosystem \nin fostering an innovative culture that can encourage more \nAsian\u00a0innovators. Notwithstanding the central role played by \nbrilliant individuals in innovation, it takes teamwork, networking, \nand collaboration to transform innovative visions into reality. \nA\u00a0well-known example is Steve\u00a0Jobs working with Steve Wozniak \nand other friends to create Apple in a garage in a California\u00a0suburb. \nMore\u00a0fundamentally, the most successful innovators do not \ninnovate in a vacuum but rather within institutions and \nenvironments that foster innovation. Not even the greatest \ninnovative concepts can get off the ground if innovators lack \nfinancing. Success may also be unlikely in the absence of adequate \nintellectual property rights (IPRs), as an environment lacking \nprotection may deter innovators from investing time and effort \nin innovation. Yet another important dimension of the innovation \nenvironment is the availability of innovation networks, of which \nSilicon Valley is perhaps the most famous.\nIPRs, innovation, and performance \nas the ROK developed\nIPRs take many forms, each appropriate at a different stage of \neconomic development. The ROK is widely viewed as a benchmark \nfor innovation among developing countries because it transformed \nitself from only one among many into a highly innovative, high-\nincome economy within just a few decades. The ROK experience \ncan therefore be very informative about how IPRs evolve as an \neconomy develops and moves up the innovation ladder. It can offer \nvaluable lessons for countries in developing Asia that aspire to \nemulate ROK success in becoming a knowledge-based economy.\nIn such an economy, technological innovation and intellectual \ncapital are important determinants of economic growth. IPRs \nare among the most powerful intangible assets that determine a \nfirm\u2019s productive capacity. Lee (2013) referred to this capability to \nexplain the ROK and Asian experience in catch-up development. \nThis\u00a0approach can be considered an extension of the view \ncrediting technology, whereby the accumulated technological \ncapability of firms sustained ROK economic growth for several \ndecades (OECD\u00a01992, Hobday\u00a01995, Kim 1997).", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)103\nFigure 2.4.1\u2002Registration of IPRs in the Republic of Korea, 1970\u20132010\nPatent\nUtility model\nTrademark\nDesign\nThousands\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009\nIPRs = intellectual property rights.\nNote: Utility model registration rapidly diminished because that process changed in 2006 into an evaluation system. At the same time, patent \nregistrations decreased because large \ufb01rms such as Samsung and LG reduced their registration of patents with the Korean Intellectual Property \nOffice. Since the mid-2000s, large ROK \ufb01rms have applied for and registered patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office instead, \nto better compete in the global market.\nSource: Lee, Kang, and Park, forthcoming.\nThe data resoundingly confirm the conventional wisdom \nthat the ROK engineered a spectacular transformation from \na poor developing country into one of the world\u2019s most \ninnovative economies. As latecomers and followers with \nlimited technological capacity at the outset, ROK firms \ninitially, before the 1980s, relied heavily on reverse engineering \nand imported equipment or machinery (Lee et al. 2003). \nThen,\u00a0after\u00a0accumulating sufficient technological capability, \nROK firms intensified their innovative activities, expanding \nthe number of IPR registrations each year from 8,418 in 1971 to \n145,927 in 2009 (Figure 2.4.1).\nA recurring debate on the relationship between IPRs \nand innovation has been whether strong or weak protection \nbetter stimulates innovation (Maskus and Penubarti 1995, \nSmith\u00a01999, Awokuse and Yin 2010). However, without \ninnovation capability, nothing is produced even with strong \nIPRs (Lee\u00a02019). Recent literature has correspondingly shifted \nfocus from the effects of strong-versus-weak IPR protection \non economic growth at different stages of development to, \ninstead, the various roles of the diverse forms of protection, \nwhich include, in addition to regular invention patents, utility \nmodels, trademarks, and design patents (Kim et\u00a0al.\u00a02012). \nConventional\u00a0patent rights alone, for example, are not \nalways effective in promoting innovation, particularly \nimitative innovation. Such\u00a0issues need to be considered in \ndeveloping\u00a0Asia, which faces the challenge of managing its \ntransition from imitation to innovation.", "104(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nExisting empirical research on diverse IPR forms\nKim et al. (2012) showed that, in developing countries, simply \nstrengthening patent rights does not promote innovation and \ngrowth, which is better promoted by minor IPR\u00a0forms such\u00a0as \nutility models, often called petty patents.6 Lee\u00a0(2019)\u00a0and \nKang\u00a0et al. (2019) observed two different paths for technological \ndevelopment, one driven by patents, the other by trademarks. \nWhich path to follow depends on the nature of business, some \nof which rely more on trademarks than patents. For\u00a0instance, \ntrademarks are more important when the innovation involves \ntacit knowledge that cannot be filed as patents, or when firms \nare more oriented toward domestic markets than world markets. \nThe literature on trademarks regards them as expressions of the \nquality and variety of products (Block et al. 2015, Sandner and \nBlock 2011) and as a measure of product innovation (Mendon\u00e7a, \nPereira, and Godinho 2004). \nThe shift from research into the strength of IPRs toward \nthat which identifies the role of diverse forms of IPRs can be \nseen most clearly in Kim et al. (2012) and Kang et al. (2019), \nwarranting a closer look at these two studies.\nKim et al. (2012) exploited data at the level of the country \nand firm to empirically research the effects of IPR protection on \ninnovation and economic growth. It focused on the roles of two \ntypes of protection: patents and utility models. The\u00a0results\u00a0from \nboth datasets are complementary. First, differences in economic \ngrowth and innovation can be explained in high-income countries \nby variations in patent rights but not by utility model rights. \nSecond, the reverse is seen in middle- and low-income countries. \nThat is, utility models help a developing\u00a0country to build its \ntechnological capacity. Incremental, adaptive R&D generates \ninnovations that qualify for such utility model protection and \nprovide a foundation for becoming more sophisticated and \neventually producing patentable innovations. \nThese results suggest that the correct goal for developing \ncountries is not to ensure either strong or weak IPR protection, \nbut rather to determine the appropriate kind of protection for \ntheir stage of development. However, this point is seemingly \nneglected in previous research and in current policy debates \ninformed by it. Correspondingly, data on firms in the ROK show \nthat, when ROK firms still lagged technologically from 1970 \nto 1986, incremental innovations had a positive impact on firm \nperformance when controlling for other variables, but patents did \nnot have a statistically significant effect. This\u00a0finding strongly \nsupports the view that utility models are a good strategy for \ngrowth in latecomers, particularly at the early stages. \nIn the period 1987\u20131995, when the ROK had already acquired \ngreater technological and R&D capabilities, patents positively \nand significantly influenced sales growth, with utility model \napplications becoming insignificant. This\u00a0exemplifies how \na role reversal may occur after considerable technological ", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:28)(cid:28)105\ncompetence is achieved, as firms rely less on minor innovations \nfor their performance and increasingly on patentable innovations. \nMoreover,\u00a0this suggests that utility model innovations can be \nimportant inputs toward generating future patentable innovations.\nKang et al. (2019) showed how dynamic changes in leading \nindustries were reflected in applications for different types of IPR \nprotection, with utility models and trademarks filed mostly in \nlight manufacturing until the 1980s. Faced with challenges caused \nby macroeconomic factors such as rising wages and changing \ncompetitive landscapes with the rise of new rivals, ROK firms \nturned their attention to developing technological capability, \nfrom the mid-1980s especially in information and communication \ntechnology. Corporate in-house R&D centers started to mushroom, \nand private and public R&D expenditure climbed steeply. As they \nglobalized, ROK industries departed from\u00a0the previous catch-up \nmodel based on imitative technologies and embarked on more \nadvanced innovation.\nThis structural transformation was fully reflected in the \ntransition from the early dominance of utility models and \ntrademarks to the later dominance of patents. An interesting \ndivision between patent-dominated and trademark-dominated \nindustries was observed. The former included electronics, \ninformation and communication technology, machinery, \nand automobiles, and the latter pharmaceuticals and light \nmanufacturing such as food, apparel, and leather. This pattern is \neven more visible in firm-level IPR statistics, in which trademark \ndomination tends to reflect the nature of knowledge and the \ninitially low or slow development of technological capability in \nareas such as pharmaceuticals, where firms have focused on the \ndomestic market rather than exports.\nThe evolving role of design in innovation: \nnew\u00a0empirical evidence\nThe assertion that different IPR forms offer more appropriate \nprotection at different development stages can best be illustrated \nby the growing importance of industrial design in ROK\u00a0innovation. \nPerhaps because design is viewed as a less important dimension \nof innovation, in contrast to a new technology, design is the most \nneglected, least analyzed IPR form in economics.\nDesign (or industrial design) as defined by the World \nIntellectual Property Organization is the ornamental or aesthetic \naspects of a product or service. Design is defined as \u201cthe\u00a0shape, \npattern, color, or any combination thereof in an article, which \nproduces an aesthetic impression on the sense of sight.\u201d \nDesign\u00a0is\u00a0an important way to add value to products and services \nand make them more competitive (Rothwell\u00a0and Gardiner 1983). \nDesigns make a product more attractive and appealing, adding \ncommercial value and facilitating marketability. In\u00a0addition, \ndesign is an important driver of innovation, acting as a bridge ", "106(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nbetween technical and customer-oriented functions (Kline\u00a0and \nRosenberg 1986, Rothwell 1992, Walsh\u00a01996). Appropriate \ndesign for a user-friendly feature helps satisfy customers.\nProduct differentiation is often achieved through better \ndesign. Moreover, technology gaps can be overcome by design. \nThe relationship between the national economy and design \ncan be discussed in relation to the stage of development of the \nnational industrial strategy. Design is not important when the \nnational economy is underdeveloped because growth relies on \nlow wages enabling the mass production of low-cost goods. \nHowever, the importance of design increases as the economic \nstructure advances. International competitiveness can be \nmaintained only through product differentiation and quality \nimprovement achieved through technological innovation and \ndesign development.\nIn the ROK, examples of the relationship between product \ncompetitiveness and industrial design can be seen in the \nelectronics, rubber, and plastic industries. A case in point \nis Samsung Electronics.7 This largest chaebol, or industrial \nconglomerate, in the ROK, founded in 1969, expanded its design \ncenter, Samsung Design, from a small group into, by 1981, \na companywide R&D organization that declared in 1993 its \nrenowned \u201cnew management initiative.\u201d During this period, \ngood\u00a0design was identified by the company\u2019s leaders as the \ncritical element needed to excel in world markets. \nThe company declared 1996 \u201cthe year of design revolution\u201d \nand the time to build a unique design identity.

The evolution of ROK innovation from 1971 to \n2010 suggests that different IPR forms are more appropriate at \ndifferent development stages. During\u00a0the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0early\u00a0stage \nof development, firms\u2019 sales growth was more closely associated \nwith petty patents or utility models (Kim et\u00a0al.\u00a02012). During the \npost-1987 catch-up phase, two innovation pathways emerged: \none\u00a0oriented toward trademarks and for firms tending to sell \nmostly domestically (Kang et al. 2019), and one oriented toward \ndesign and for firms tending mostly to export. Since the 2000s \nand the globalization and maturing of the ROK economy, regular \npatents and designs have assumed greater importance.\nThe key takeaway for developing Asia is that industrial \ndesigns, petty patents, and trademarks can, like regular patents, \nbe effective forms of IPR protection, but at different stages or for \ndifferent industries. Finally, better design is an important way \nfor firms to differentiate their products and compete successfully \nin global markets. The rise of Samsung\u00a0Electronics as a world-\nclass tech giant underlines the high value added by design in \nthe innovation process, especially at later stages of economic \ndevelopment.\nFinancial architecture and innovation\nAccess to finance is indispensable to innovation, which is \ninherently costly and fraught with risk and uncertainty. \nThere\u00a0is almost no way of knowing beforehand which particular \ninnovations will turn out to be commercially successful. \nIt\u00a0is\u00a0even\u00a0more difficult to predict whether an innovator can \nturn his innovative vision into a viable reality. Yet even the \ngreatest inventions need financing to succeed. While Apple is \nwidely associated with Steve Jobs, for example, the iconic tech \ngiant would never have emerged without the bold, high-risk \ninvestment of Mike Markkula, who provided critical seed \nmoney and managerial support during Apple\u2019s embryonic phase. \nA\u00a0crucial\u00a0component of viable innovation is, therefore, a sound \nand efficient financial system that can channel resources to \naspiring innovators. \nThis study now takes a close look at the link between \nfinance and innovation through cross-country empirical analysis \n(Box\u00a02.4.2). It asks in particular whether financial intermediaries \nsuch as banks or capital markets are more conducive to \ninnovation\u2014and, if markets, what kind? Given\u00a0widely\u00a0varying \nstages of economic development in developing\u00a0Asia, an \nadditional question is whether a country\u2019s income affects \nthe analytical comparison of intermediaries versus markets.

At the same time, they are \nexperiencing rapid urbanization. Urban innovation clusters or \nhubs can be a powerful promoter of innovation. Silicon Valley, \nthe birthplace of the global tech industry, is perhaps the best-\nknown example. Some well-known urban innovation clusters in \ndeveloping Asia are Zhonguancun, Shenzhen, and Zhangjiang \nin the PRC; Bangalore and Hyderabad in India; and Pangyo \nTech Valley in the ROK. But is there a systematic relationship \nbetween innovation and urbanization? Most existing evidence \non the effect of urban agglomeration on innovation comes \nfrom developed economies. Systemic evidence is lacking \nas to whether urban agglomeration affects innovation, \nand if so, what the channel might be for it to occur in the \ndeveloping\u00a0world, including Asia.\nA few generally accepted assumptions, however, provide \ninsight on the issue. One is that innovation tends to be \nconcentrated in a few cities that serve as innovation\u00a0hubs.

Finally, the presence of top-tier universities often \nhelps to explain host cities\u2019 disproportionate role in innovation. \nThese findings are discussed in greater detail below.\nEmergence of innovation hubs\nWidely recognized in the existing literature is that innovation \ntends to be highly concentrated spatially. Within a given \ncountry, there are generally a few cities that are innovation \nhubs. These hubs host a large share of the country\u2019s \ninnovative activities\u2014one that is typically disproportionate \nto its share of the country\u2019s population. For instance, Nieto \nGalindo\u00a0(2007) found that over 70% of Colombia\u2019s innovations \nwere concentrated in three main cities that together \nwere home to less than 40% of the country\u2019s population. \nIn\u00a0the\u00a0US, Moretti\u00a0(2019) showed that the top 10 innovative \ncities in computer science were home to 70% of inventors, \nin\u00a0semiconductors 79%, and in biology and chemistry 59%.\nTable 2.4.1\u2002S hare of urban population and innovative firms  \nin the 10 most innovative cities in selected countries\nFeature concentrated, % PRC India Indonesia Kazakhstan Malaysia\nUrban population 55 43 \u200272 67 70\nProcess innovation 64 70 \u200299 94 99\nProduct innovation 72 76 \u200293 83 80\nR&D 64 73 100 91 92\nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, R&D = research and development.\nNote: The 10 most innovative cities in each country are the ones with the highest share of \nfirms that undertake process innovation.

In light of the \nprevious finding that human capital affects innovation, another \nchannel worth exploring is the role of top-tier universities, which \ntend to be highly concentrated spatially.

Currently, the \nFourth Industrial Revolution, epitomized by revolutionary \ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous \nvehicles, robotics, nanotechnology, and 3-D printing, is creating \na palpable sense of excitement. For developing Asia, the current \nmoment is especially opportune for examining the relationship \nbetween innovation and development. The region needs more \nand better innovation both to sustain growth by fostering \nproductivity and to improve the quality of growth by making it \nmore inclusive and sustainable.\nIt may seem that innovation and its impact on growth \nand development are relevant mostly to relatively advanced \neconomies. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nInnovation is not limited to momentous new technologies \nthat push the global technology frontier. Much of innovation \nis incremental and marginal, which may be less glamorous \nthan self-driving cars but no less important for growth and \nthe quality of life. Encouragingly, the evidence suggests that \nfirms in less developed countries in the region are already \ndoing plenty of such innovation. Further, ICT is opening up \nplenty of opportunities for innovative entrepreneurship in \ncountries at all income levels. One prime example is Indonesia\u2019s \nGojek, which started out as a motorbike taxi-hailing service \nbut, in\u00a02017 and again in 2019, joined the Fortune list of \n50\u00a0Companies that Changed the World.\nMore generally, new technologies, most notably ICT, can \nenable less developed countries to leapfrog from obsolete to \nmore advanced technologies by, for example, skipping over \nfixed-line phones by going straight to mobiles. This suggests \nthat they can advance toward the global technology frontier in \nrelatively short order. But leapfrogging remains a contentious \nissue, and it obscures the much bigger point: the need to get \nthe basics right. As stated above, there is no shortcut to an \ninnovative economy and society, no escaping the need to satisfy \nbasic prerequisites for an innovative economy. For\u00a0example, \nthe exciting opportunities for innovation that ICT presents, \nespecially for creative business models tailored to the local \ncontext, can never be realized without good ICT infrastructure, \nan enabling regulatory environment, and a workforce with \nsolid numeracy and literacy, including digital\u00a0literacy.", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:29)(cid:29)117\nThe first step on the journey to an innovative society \nmust be to nurture a workforce that is capable of absorbing \nand utilizing more advanced technology from more advanced \neconomies. This is what the NIEs did and what any aspiring \neconomy must do. In addition to the NIE experience, growing \ninnovative prowess in Viet Nam, where the education \nsystem produces superior learning outcomes as measured by \nProgramme for International Student Assessment tests, attests \nto the central importance of humancapital in innovation. \nA\u00a0top\u00a0priority in this regard is to build on basic education by \ncreating a conducive entrepreneurial ecosystem that allows \ninnovative entrepreneurs to flourish.\nThe education system must guarantee good basic learning \noutcomes. Despite stories about entrepreneurs dropping out \nof school to succeed beyond imagination, it is a pipe dream to \nthink that individuals without basic literacy and numeracy can \nbecome innovators. The prerequisite of an education system that \ncan produce a large pool of innovators is to get the basics right. \nAlthough some economies in developing\u00a0Asia excel at delivering \nstrong learning outcomes, others do not. In\u00a0economies that\u00a0fail, \neducation must be reformed thoroughly with the objective \nof dramatically improving the quality of basic education. \nStrong\u00a0basic education is one thing no country can leapfrog past \nbecause even the most creative thinkers need it.\nA focus on learners nurtures innovators, as does an optimal \nskills mix. A growing body of robust evidence demonstrates that \nlearner-centered approaches are superior to teacher-centered \nones. Asian countries should therefore consider shifting their \nteaching practices to more student-centric approaches that \nencourage students to think for themselves. While the STEM \nquartet of science, technology, engineering, and math is certainly \nimportant for innovation, so are other subjects that develop \ncreativity, such as art and design, or critical thinking, such as \nsocial science and humanities. In fact, individuals commanding a \nmix of disparate skills are key to driving innovation.\nHigh-quality, innovative entrepreneurship needs favorable \ninstitutions. New entrepreneurial businesses constitute a \npotent force driving countries\u2019 productivity and innovation, \nparticularly now in the digital age. This effect operates through \nbusiness model innovation that challenges established industry \nincumbents. The evidence broadly indicates that strong property \nrights, impartial rule of law, and simplified entry regulations \npromote high-quality entrepreneurship. On\u00a0the other hand, \na high incidence of informal, unregistered businesses deters \ninnovative businesses through potentially unfair competition. \nThis suggests that fair competition and, more broadly, \npolicies to promote competition can also promote innovative \nentrepreneurship (Box 2.5.1).

The focus regionally should be on \nnurturing and facilitating regional entrepreneurial ecosystems. \nKey principles include the following: (i) Adopt a bottom\u2013up, \nfacilitative approach, as opposed to a top\u2013down, hierarchical \napproach. (ii) Seek close engagement with all stakeholders. \n(iii)\u00a0Nurture close communities of entrepreneurs, accelerators, \nfinanciers, large businesses, mentors, public agencies, \neducational institutions, and regional agencies by serving as \na secretariat.

Three key elements of an \ninnovation architecture are intellectual property rights, \nan efficient financial system, and urban innovation hubs. \nGiven the heterogeneity of Asian economies in terms of their \ninnovation capacity and stage of development, the appropriate \nnational innovation system will necessarily differ from country \nto country.\nDifferent types of IPR serve better at different stages of \ndevelopment.

The ROK experience strengthens the \ncase for a nuanced approach to IPR policy. \nEquity and other capital markets are key to financing \ninnovation. Analysis of industry-level patent data from \n47\u00a0economies in 1997\u20132016 reveals that financial structures \nmatter disproportionately to innovation.

The subsidies \nof Innofund, a PRC government fund dedicated to supporting \ntechnology-based small and medium-sized enterprises, seem \nto have only a limited effect on innovative output (Li, Liu, \nand Gentile, forthcoming). This highlights that government \nintervention needs to be nuanced.\nBeyond ensuring an enabling environment, governments \ncan catalyze. Governments play a major direct role in \ninnovation, accounting for a substantial share of R&D. \nThe\u00a0government share of economy-wide R&D from 1996 \nto 2017 was 24% in the ROK, 23% in the PRC, and 42% in \nViet\u00a0Nam. Government R&D tends to carry out basic research \nwith large potential for spillover, while private sector \nresearch centers on commercial applications (Bernanke 2011). \nThe\u00a0internet is a classic example. Although much of the basic \ntechnology came from government laboratories, the countless \ninnovations it\u00a0spawned and made the internet what it is \ncame predominantly from the private sector.

The task is a long-term commitment \nrequiring a lot of hard work. Similarly, education systems \nthat aim to nurture innovation cannot leapfrog the stage of \ninstilling strong basic skills, notably literacy and numeracy. \nHowever, Asia\u2019s past record and robust fundamentals suggest \nthat it can and will dedicate the time and effort it takes to \nbecome a more innovative region.", "What drives innovation in Asia?(cid:16)(cid:16)121\nEndnotes\n1 First published in 1992, the Oslo Manual is the international \nreference guide for collecting and using data on innovation. \nThe most recent edition, published in 2018, considers \na broader range of innovation-related phenomena and \nthe experience gained from recent rounds of innovation \nsurveys in member countries of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and \npartner economies and organizations.\n2 An increase in one input while holding other inputs \nconstant will initially increase output but then will generate \nlower returns per unit the more that one input is increased. \nIn other words, increasing one factor of production while \nkeeping the other factors constant is not productive past a \ncertain point.\n3 Most surveys that collect data on innovation, including \nthe World Bank Enterprise Survey, are based on the \nOslo\u00a0Manual. The Oslo Manual 2005 divides innovation \ninto four main subtypes: (i) Product innovation is \nthe introduction of a good or service that is new or \nsignificantly improved with respect to its characteristics or \nintended\u00a0uses. (ii) Process innovation isthe implementation \nof a new or significantly improved production\u00a0or delivery \nmethod. (iii) Marketing innovation is the implementation \nof a new method of distribution involving\u00a0significant \nchanges in product design or packaging, placement, \npromotion, or\u00a0pricing. (iv) Organizational innovation is the \nimplementation of new firm business practices, workplace \narrangements, or external\u00a0relations.\n4 Five countries in the Pacific\u2014Fiji, Micronesia, Samoa, \nTonga, and Vanuatu\u2014are excluded from innovation \nvariables for lack of data.\n5 These terms follow Rosing et al.

However, capital spending fell short of its target in \n2018 and 2019 and, as a percentage of GDP, remains below the ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: Central Asia  Armenia\u2002\u2002139\naverage for upper-middle income countries. Moreover, with \ncapital outlays at less than 5.0% of GDP since 2012, the public \ncapital stock, or the value of government-owned assets, is \nestimated to have fallen by two-thirds, from the equivalent of \n160% of GDP in 2000 to 62% in 2017. While expenditure under-\nexecution can reduce public debt and deficits in the short \nrun, in the long run the under-execution of capital spending \nimposes a limit on a country\u2019s production capacity and growth \npotential. Thus, boosting capital expenditure through a sound \nprocess of public investment management is important. \nIn a 2019 assessment of public investment management, the \nInternational Monetary Fund concluded that, while Armenia \nperforms well in its adherence to fiscal rules, its budget \ncomprehensiveness, and the availability of funding, it lags in \nproject appraisal, budgeting for investment, project selection, \nand performance across the project cycle. Thus, boosting \ncapacity to plan, prioritize, and implement well-targeted capital \nspending is critical. The assessment proposed a two-stage \ngateway for project planning. The first gateway reviews project \nproposals before they are submitted to the cabinet, and the \nsecond gateway requires further review and full appraisal of \ncleared flagship projects. \nPlanning is important to ensure that each project\u2019s \nobjectives align with national strategic priorities. To this \nend, the government has started preparing its Armenia \nTransformation Strategy 2050 to provide an overarching \nnational strategy for five areas\u2014infrastructure, human capital, \nfinance and the economy, public administration, and justice\u2014\nand 16 sectors, with closely aligned medium-term budgeting.\nAllocating public investment to the most productive \nprojects is a key concern. To streamline and maximize \nefficiency in appraising and selecting projects, the government \nestablished in 2019 a public investment unit in the Ministry of \nEconomy. Guidelines for appraising planned projects through \ncost\u2013benefit analysis and in terms of cost-effectiveness are to \nbe introduced in 2020.\nAnother problem is substantial bunching of expenditure \nat the end of the year, especially for foreign-financed projects, \nwhich is a contributing cause of underspending. Addressing \nthis problem requires continued capacity development in \nproject executing and implementing agencies to better satisfy \nthe procedures and policies required by development partners \nregarding procurement, contract management, and financial \nreporting. \nAll of these reforms should be considered parts of a \nbroader effort to improve public financial management. Strong \nimplementation of reform is thus important, as envisaged by \nthe Public Financial Management Reform Strategy for 2019\u2013\n2023, approved in November 2019.", "Azerbaijan\nFiscal stimulus and higher gas production lifted growth in 2019 as food prices boosted \ninflation.

SOFAZ was \nestablished to promote the efficient use of this income and \nensure its availability for multiple generations. It transfers \nmoney annually to the budget to support budget expenditure, \nin particular public investment. From 2012 to 2019, transfers \nfrom SOFAZ provided on average nearly half of central budget ", "144(cid:4)(cid:4)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nrevenue (Figure 3.2.10).

To \naddress this problem, the government adopted in 2018 fiscal \n20\nrules governing the use of oil revenues and creating a medium-\nterm expenditure framework (MTEF). To implement this \n0\nframework, the government has agreed to develop strategic  2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nForecast\nplans for each sector, including detailed costing; established an \nSource: Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nMTEF center at the Ministry of Finance; and identified three \nsectors\u2014agriculture, education, and environment\u2014to pilot the \nframework starting with the 2021 budget. Implementing the \nMTEF is a challenge for the government, and its success will \nrequire strong efforts from spending ministries. \nThe government needs to develop a medium-term \nstrategy linked to its main development objectives, with clear \nperformance indicators and a sound monitoring and evaluation \nframework. In addition, strong capacity for macroeconomic \nforecasting is needed to ensure sound fiscal forecasting and \naccurate identification of available fiscal resources. \nThe MTEF process is expected to bridge gaps between the \ngovernment\u2019s national strategic vision, its strategic plans for \ndifferent sectors, and the annual budgeting exercises of budget \nunits, with a focus on applying public expenditure to attain set \nobjectives. Once the government\u2019s strategic priorities are set, \nthe MTEF will guide budgetary allocations toward attaining \nthem over the medium term. Successful implementation of the \nMTEF depends on ministries\u2019 ability to translate government \nobjectives into sectoral goals and prepare detailed programs \nand procurement plans to specify realistic annual costs within \nthe framework. \nThe MTEF requires a strong monitoring and reporting \nmechanism. Modern information and communication \ntechnology should replace the outdated budget recording and \nreporting system currently used. The MTEF should bring \nstrong accountability, thereby increasing fiscal transparency \nand public understanding of budget policy. \nCapacity and institutional weaknesses are major hurdles \nto implementing the MTEF. Spending agencies currently lack \nthe capacity to formulate sector strategies and medium-term \naction plans. Thus, it is important that the implementation of \nthe MTEF be properly phased. MTEF implementation will be \nmore successful if done incrementally, progressively refining \nexisting systems rather than suddenly replacing them with an \nunfamiliar new process.", "Georgia\nInfrastructure spending and continued export gains boosted growth in 2019.

Eventually, however, sustaining \nthe welfare system will require the authorities to ensure some \ncombination of higher revenue, increased borrowing, and/or lower \nexpenditure from tighter eligibility requirements or smaller benefits. \nThe government is working to improve program targeting \nand streamlining administration.

In 2020, eligibility became conditional on able-bodied \nfamily members seeking employment, complemented by the \nstate-run Enbek employment program. Further, the government is \nopening support centers across the country to provide advice and \nassistance to large and low-income families. \nOn the revenue side, the government is gradually implementing \nthe twice-postponed Universal Declaration of Income and \nProperty (UDIP) to facilitate compliance and reduce tax evasion. \nCivil servants will begin submitting declarations in 2021, and the \ngoal is to require declarations from all taxpayers by 2025. While \nmost of the work needed for the new system has been completed, \nimplementing the UDIP is a complex task, with success depending \non many factors, most notably proper data protection to prevent \nits misuse. The UDIP rollout is expected to help the government \nshrink the shadow economy to 15%\u201317% of GDP from current \nestimates of somewhat less than 30%, according to the Statistics \nCommittee of Kazakhstan. Also, the UDIP may improve the \ntargeting of social assistance by providing additional information \non household income. \nTo complement these measures, the government may decide \nto replace the current flat income tax with a progressive tax, \nincreasing rates for high-earning households. This system would \nleave more money with low-wage earners, who are likely to \nspend it on basic necessities, possibly increasing government tax \nreceipts overall.\nImproving revenue collection and the administration of the \nsocial assistance program should make social assistance more \nsustainable.

Indeed, as a fragile country \nin armed conflict, Afghanistan has limited revenue sources \nand weak government institutions, but daunting security and \ndevelopment needs, leaving public finances heavily dependent \non foreign assistance. This dependence is not sustainable, \nthough, so the country needs to become more self-sufficient in \nfinancing public expenditure. Accelerating domestic revenue \nmobilization is one of the most pressing policy challenges \nfacing Afghanistan.  \nOver the past 2 decades, Afghanistan has made notable \nprogress in building a revenue system able to help generate \nrising government revenue. Since 2016, the government has \nsuccessfully followed a strategy of boosting prospects for self-\nreliance through domestic revenue mobilization that, together \nwith foreign grant assistance, helped achieve a balanced budget \nand keep public debt low. Tax administration reform over the \nlast 2 years has made revenue collection more efficient, and \ncustoms revenue benefitted from afghani depreciation in 2019.\nWhile the past revenue collection performance benefitted \nfrom an expanding tax base and improved efficiency, it has \nalso increasingly relied on risky indirect and one-off measures \nthat create uncertainty. The World Bank estimates that 2019 \nnontax revenue drove revenue growth by contributing 1.3 \npercentage points to GDP, while tax revenue deducted 0.15 \npercentage points from GDP. Going forward, realizing self-\nreliance and reducing grant dependence will depend on how \nsuccessfully the government builds a sound domestic revenue \nbase by further broadening the tax base and reducing reliance \non nontax revenues. Key to revenue mobilization policy in \nthe near future is the planned adoption of VAT by early 2021. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the successful \nadministration of VAT could gradually raise revenue by up to \nthe equivalent of 1.8% of GDP, but it will be a challenge without \nresolving currently daunting political and business uncertainty. \nThe government should pursue structural reform as \noutlined in the Afghanistan National Peace and Development \nFramework to ensure sustained progress towards self-reliance. \nStrenuous efforts are needed to improve governance and public \nfinancial management. Policies should continue to work toward \nstrengthening revenue collection, improving customs and tax \nadministration and compliance, introducing carefully designed \nand appropriate new taxes, and improving the tax policy mix. \nIn the short term, policy actions can focus on introducing \ndigital technology into revenue collection, reinforcing \ncontrols and tax audits, strengthening antifraud measures, \nand sanctioning noncompliance. Over the medium term, \nadditional excises and property taxes should be introduced, \na fiscal regime for natural resource taxation developed, and \nenforcement and compliance strengthened.", "Bangladesh\nGDP grew by 8.2% in fiscal 2019 on robust growth in both industry and services.

Two such reforms were a sales tax at \nthe import stage and the introduction of VAT in 1991 with a \nsingle rate to replace excise duties on domestic manufactures \nand services. In addition to VAT, supplementary duties \nwere introduced on luxuries and certain other goods, to \ndiscourage consumption on various grounds. Though VAT \nand supplementary duties expanded the revenue base, the \nsystem was not comprehensive in scope and contained some \ndistortions. Reform to the customs tariff in the early 1990s \nreduced the number of rates and lowered duties, moderating \nprotection for local producers. Income tax reform rationalized \npersonal and corporate tax rates, and the introduction of \nuniversal self-assessment procedures brought more taxpayers \nwithin the tax net. Parliament enacted the Value Added \nTax and Supplementary Duty Act in 2012, but its rollout \nwas delayed, coming into effect only in July 2019 with VAT \nimplemented using several rates. The government is working \non other reform to incorporate transfer pricing into the Income \nTax Ordinance 1984 and alternative dispute resolution into \nincome tax, VAT, and custom acts; draft a new direct tax \ncode and customs act; and improve tax administration by \nautomating and digitalizing operations. \nDespite several attempted reforms, anticipated progress has \nbeen elusive as many of them were ad hoc. While the new VAT \nlaw addressed some deficiencies and distortions in the previous \nlaw, it retained multiple VAT rates, keeping administration \ninefficient. Income tax remains complex, depressing income \ntax collection below its potential. Only 2.2 million Bangladeshis \npay income tax despite scope to increase the number to some \n10 million by simplifying collection and refunds.

IL&FS had borrowed heavily from banks and the \ncorporate bond market, attracting investors like mutual funds, \npension funds, and corporations, and was rated highly by \ndomestic rating agencies. \nThe IL&FS default triggered panic in the financial \nmarket. Liquidity soon dried up in the entire NBFC segment \nas banks and mutual funds cut their exposure to NBFCs. \nThis dramatically cut the flow of resources from NBFCs to \nbusinesses, by 69.2% in FY2018 and a further 66.3% in the first \nhalf of FY2019. As bank credit flows fell as well, total financial \nflows to businesses plunged by 60.3% year on year in the first \nhalf of FY2019, creating the credit crunch. \nIn the wake of the IL&FS crisis, the central government \nhas moved to cushion its impact. It launched a \u20b91 trillion \npartial credit guarantee program to protect NBFC lending that \nsatisfied program criteria, and it contributed \u20b9100 billion to a \n\u20b9250 billion alternative investment fund to provide last-mile \nfunding to stalled housing developments. \nAs the regulator, the central bank acted to ensure the flow \nof bank lending to NBFCs: reducing risk weights on lending to \nNBFCs to make them similar to weights for other companies, \nincreasing limits on bank exposure to single-borrower NBFCs \nfrom 10% to 20% of the bank\u2019s tier-1 capital, and allowing \nbanks to lend to registered NBFCs (other than micro-finance \ninstitutions) for onlending to micro and small enterprises, to \nthe housing sector, and, as term loans only, to agriculture. \nThese measures have prevented further NBFC-SI failures \nand perhaps a financial crisis. Since then, banks have increased \nlending to NBFCs and improved their liquidity. Yet, bank \nlending may be skewed in favor of large and highly rated \nNBFCs. Smaller, less-established, and lower-rated NBFCs \ncontinued to struggle for funds. Bond market liquidity for \nNBFCs and HFCs remained tight. ", "236(cid:29)(cid:29)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nNBFCs carry risks inherent to their business nature. \nThey rely on wholesale funding and face liquidity risks \nwhen markets seize up. Their focus on particular market \nsegments concentrates risk. With less stringent regulation and \nsupervision, NBFCs tend to be excessively leveraged, and their \nlending is likely procyclical. Further, unlike banks, NBFCs \ncannot borrow from the central bank when in difficulty, and \ndeposit insurance schemes do not apply.\nReform is needed to address the structural issues in NBFCs. \nThey need to diversify funding sources by accessing broader \npools of capital, especially those with long-maturity liabilities \nsuch as pension funds and insurance companies. Debt pooling \nto securitize NBFC assets would help but would require better \ndisclosure and market transparency. Credible and reliable \nratings are crucial for attracting large pools of investments \nin NBFCs. Further regulatory intervention is necessary to \nimprove governance in rating agencies and strengthen their \ncapacity. \nRegulatory and supervisory oversight of NBFCs-SI in \nparticular must be enhanced, given their strong links with the \neconomy. A proper mechanism is needed to control risk and \nensure soundness, which could include regular and detailed \naudits and inspection by the regulator, new limits on liquidity \nand asset liability mismatch, and regular reviews of asset \nquality. \nMaking NBFC supervision more stringent and comparable \nto bank supervision will be a challenge for the central bank. \nWhile there are some 90 scheduled commercial banks, \nNBFCs-SI number close to 300. Supervising such a large \nnumber of entities to the same standard of coverage and \ndetail will require the central bank to significantly expand its \ncapacity.

Most graduates prefer white \ncollar jobs, and many are unwilling to take up blue collar jobs. \nFurther, TVET is not a popular education choice for many \nstudents, with only 13% of upper secondary students choosing \nto pursue it. \nWith employers preferring job candidates with a \ncombination of hard skills such as analytical thinking and \nproblem solving, as well as the soft skills of communication \nand team work, it is important for the educational curricula \nto strike a good balance between the two skills sets. Existing \ngraduates can be encouraged to acquire soft skills through \nwork experience or assignment at companies. The 2020 budget \nintroduced the Graduates@Work program, through which \nthe government will offer a wage incentive of RM500 per \nmonth for two years to graduates who obtain a job after being \nunemployed for more than 12 months. Employers will receive a \nhiring incentive of up to RM300 per month for each new hire \nfor 2 years. This looks like a promising public program to help \ngraduates upgrade their soft skills on the job. \nReforming TVET could help make the program more \nattractive to students.

The Department \nof Tourism is rolling out its sustainable tourism development \nprogram for local governments, with investments in sewerage \ntreatment plants, drainage, and solid waste management. \nThe climate challenge for the Philippines over the next \n30 years is to avoid potentially large increases in GHG \nemissions while growing rapidly and to invest strategically in \nclimate resilience. A good next step would be to strengthen \nits commitment to reducing GHG emissions. Some countries, \nsuch\u00a0as New Zealand, have enacted or are considering \nlegislation to lock in net zero GHG emissions by 2040 \nor\u00a02050. The Philippines could do the same, as this would \nfurther encourage investment in climate change mitigation \nand resilience. The government and private sector could \nalso consider new approaches to investments in energy, \ninfrastructure, and agriculture.\nThe country can promote renewable energy sources further \nto drive economic growth. Significant GHG mitigation can \ncome from making electricity generation less carbon intensive. \nPower generation contributes half of Philippine GHG emissions \nwith its dependence on fossil fuels (Figure 3.28.12). The use \nof coal has expanded dramatically in recent years, more than \ndoubling from 12% of the primary energy mix in 2000 to 27% \nin 2018. Setting aside transportation and concentrating on \npower generation, the share of renewables declined from 43% \nin 2000 to 23% in 2018, while the coal-fired share rose to 52%. \nShifting the energy mix back to more renewables will require \nreform to incentivize large investments in renewable power \ngeneration. A carbon tax on polluting industries could be \nstudied. \nThe emergence of affordable low-carbon technologies \nsuch as solar and wind power offer opportunities to scale up \ninvestments.

Developing local \nexpertise in renewables has potential to create a new growth \nindustry that pioneers the export of renewable energy \ntechnology, creating new manufacturing industries and jobs.\nInfrastructure programs, particularly when part of \nrecovery and reconstruction following disasters, should \nbe climate friendly and resilient. The government\u2019s Build \nBuild Build program emphasizes mass urban transportation \nsystems to help reduce GHG emissions. Such investments \ninclude expanding metro and light rail systems, a subway in \nMetro\u00a0Manila, and an inter-region rail system such as from \nNew Clark City in Central Luzon to Calamba, Laguna in \nSouth\u00a0Luzon, which could transport 700,000 passengers daily \nby 2030. These mass urban transit systems would help shrink \nthe Philippines\u2019 carbon footprint. \nAgriculture offers opportunities for the government to \ninvest in climate resilience, as it is the sector most vulnerable \nto changes in rainfall and weather patterns, rising sea levels, \nand more frequent outbreaks of crop pests. Institutional reform \nwill be needed in water supply. A good first step would be for \nCongress to pass a bill to consolidate under one department the \n30-plus agencies currently concerned with water.

First, gross domestic expenditure on research and \ndevelopment (R&D), both public and private, equaled only \n0.53% of GDP in 2017, far below 1.44% in Malaysia and 0.78% in \nThailand a year earlier, which clearly illustrates that Viet Nam \nneeds to step up its spending on R&D. Second, universities in \nViet Nam rank lower than in upper-middle-income countries \nin Southeast Asia in quality and quantity, as measured by \ngross enrollment ratio. Although Viet Nam compares favorably \nin the number of students in tertiary education overseas \nand has 55,000 students enrolled domestically each year in \ntertiary  ICT programs, these future graduate numbers may be \ninsufficient to meet growing demand from rapidly growing ICT \nindustries. Ensuring more and better fresh graduates is critical \nfor Viet Nam to leap ahead in technological innovation. Third, \nwhile the financial sector has grown steadily and innovative \nfintech is being adopted, the current legal framework has \nnot kept pace with the development of fintech products and \nservices. An enabling regulatory framework to nurture the \napplication of fintech would help Viet Nam to expand and \ndeepen its financial services.

In his budget speech, the minister of ", "Economic trends and prospects in developing Asia: The Pacific  Papua New Guinea\u2002\u2002323\nthe treasury rightly pointed out that \u201cthe financial challenges \nfacing many of these SOEs will only worsen next year when \nexpensive debt repayments fall due.\u201d \nContingent liabilities remain high, but exactly how high \nis another unknown.

With the absence of any procedures to manage risk, \nsuch risks can only get worse, and indeed these contingent \ncommitments may haunt the budget this year and next. \nFollowing an October 2019 amendment to the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act that raised the permissible ratio of debt to \nGDP to 45%, there is room to include some of these guaranteed \ndebts in the government\u2019s reporting of public debt. This would \nenhance transparency in government reporting and go some \nway toward allaying concern about how complete debt data \nare, which could eventually improve the government\u2019s credit \nrating.

Migration and concentrated development have strained \nurban infrastructure and public services. They render recent \neconomic gains fragile, especially as climate risks mount and, \nif unaddressed, pose challenges to future economic growth \nand social equity. Formulating appropriate responses is now \nespecially important to support long-term economic recovery \nfrom COVID-19.\nAcross the board, there has been a dramatic shift from rural \nareas to urban centers. The population of the Samoan capital \nApia and its surrounding administrative areas has increased by \n41% over the past 3 decades, greatly outpacing 15% growth in \nthe rest of the country. Similarly, the population on Tongatapu, \nTonga\u2019s main island, has increased by 17% as other islands \nsuffered a 16% decline, and the population of Rarotonga, the \nlargest of the Cook Islands, has increased by 16%, compared \nwith a 44% decline elsewhere. The economies of these countries \nhave similarly become increasingly dominated by capital \nislands, with the service sector, which exists predominantly in \nurban areas, contributing in the past 10 years 64% of growth \nin the Cook Islands, 41% in Tonga, and 100% in Samoa (as \ngrowth and contraction in smaller sectors net out). While this \nhas improved incomes for increasingly urban populations, it has \nalso put economies at greater risk to natural hazards, with a \nlarge portion of economic activity now concentrated along the \nwaterfront in Apia and Nuku\u2019alofa, and tourist developments \ncrowded around Muri lagoon in Rarotonga.\nMany of these areas have developed with little or no urban \nplanning. This has commonly made it difficult and expensive to \ninstall adequate support infrastructure. Poor maintenance has \nraised costs further, with many critical utilities now requiring \nwholesale replacement to meet public demand for services. \nWhile institutional changes are making progress toward \nbetter planning and management, gaps in infrastructure and \npublic service delivery jeopardize the already fragile economic \ngrowth enjoyed by South Pacific economies in recent years. \nRegular flooding in the Apia urban area limits investment \nand imposes a cost burden on businesses. Sanitation issues in \nRarotonga risk spoiling the pristine beaches and lagoons that \nhave driven tourism growth.

Improved maintenance would reduce the cost \nof ensuring that existing infrastructure delivers the required \nservices, as well as mean less service disruption. \nWith a large pipeline of investment already under \nway, a focus on preemptive maintenance would limit the \nmaintenance overhang built up in the past, limiting the risk \nthat infrastructure cannot be maintained without significant \nrefurbishment. While this would avoid the capital cost \nof replacing current infrastructure stock, prudent fiscal \nmanagement would still be required to ensure the availability \nof funds for initial investments.

Most of the tables \ncontain historical data from 2015 to 2019; some have forecasts for 2020 \nand 2021.\nThe data were standardized to the degree possible to allow \ncomparability over time and across economies, but differences in \nstatistical methodology, definitions, coverage, and practices make full \ncomparability impossible. The national income accounts section is based \non the United Nations System of National Accounts, while the data on \nbalance of payments use International Monetary Fund (IMF) accounting \nstandards. Historical data were obtained from official sources, statistical \npublications, and databases, as well as the documents of ADB, the IMF, \nand the World Bank. For some economies, data for 2019 were estimated \nfrom the latest available information.

Data variation may arise from statistical discrepancy when, for \nexample, balancing items for general governments (central plus selected \nsubnational governments), and from differences between coverage \nused in individual revenue and expenditure calculations and in fiscal \nbalance calculations. For Fiji, the fiscal balance excludes loan repayment. \nFor\u00a0Georgia, fiscal balance is calculated according to the Government \nFinance Statistics Manual 2001 of the IMF. For Thailand, the fiscal balance \nis the cash balance of the combined budgetary and nonbudgetary balances. \nFor Uzbekistan, the augmented fiscal balance includes the Fund for \nReconstruction and Development. Some off-budget accounts are included \nin the computation of the fiscal balance for Turkmenistan. For Singapore, \nfiscal balance excludes special transfers (top-ups to endowment and \ntrust funds) and contributions from net investment returns, while for the \nRepublic of Korea it excludes social security-related funds.", "Statistical appendix\u2002\u2002349\nTables A11, A12, A13, and A14: Balance of payments.

These tables show the annual growth rates of \nexports and imports of goods. Data are in million US dollars, primarily \nobtained from the balance-of-payments accounts of each economy. \nExport data are reported free on board. Import data are reported free \non board except for the following economies, which value them based on \ncost, insurance, and freight: Afghanistan; Hong Kong, China; Georgia; \nIndia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Myanmar; Singapore; and \nThailand.\nTable A13: Trade balance ($ million). The trade balance is the \ndifference between merchandise exports and merchandise imports. \nFigures\u00a0in this table are based on the export and import amounts used to \ngenerate tables A11 and A12.\nTable A14: Current account balance (% of GDP). The current account \nbalance is the sum of the balance of trade for merchandise, net trade in \nservices and factor income, and net transfers.

For Cambodia, official \ntransfers are excluded from the current account balance.\nTable A15: Exchange rates to the US dollar (annual average). Annual \naverage exchange rates are quoted as the local currency per US dollar.\nTable A16: Gross international reserves ($ million). Gross \ninternational reserves are defined as the US dollar value of holdings of \nforeign exchange, special drawing rights, reserve position in the IMF, and \ngold at the end of a given period. For Taipei,China, this heading refers to \nforeign exchange reserves only. In some economies, the rubric is foreign \nassets plus reserves of national monetary authorities (the net foreign \nreserves of, for example, the State Bank of Pakistan) plus national funds \nfor earnings from oil or other natural resources. The data for India are as \nof 10 March 2020.\nTable A17: External debt outstanding ($ million).

For Cambodia, debt service refers to \nexternal public debt only. For the Philippines, exports of goods, services, \nand income are used as the denominator. For Bangladesh, the ratio \nrepresents debt service payments on medium- and long-term loans as a \npercentage of exports of goods, nonfactor services, and overseas workers\u2019 \nremittances. For Azerbaijan, the ratio represents public and publicly \nguaranteed external debt service payments as a percentage of exports of \ngoods and nonfactor services.", "350(cid:28)(cid:28)Asian Development Outlook 2020\nTable A1\u2002Growth rate of GDP (% per year)\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\nCentral Asia 3.1 2.5 4.2 4.4 4.9 2.8 4.2\nArmenia 3.2 0.2 7.5 5.2 7.6 2.2 4.5\nAzerbaijan 1.1 \u20133.1 0.2 1.4 2.2 0.5 1.5\nGeorgia 3.0 2.9 4.8 4.8 5.1 0.0 4.5\nKazakhstan 1.2 1.1 4.1 4.1 4.5 1.8 3.6\nKyrgyz Republic 3.9 4.3 4.7 3.8 4.5 4.0 4.5\nTajikistan 6.0 6.9 7.1 7.3 7.5 5.5 5.0\nTurkmenistan 6.5 6.2 6.5 6.2 6.3 6.0 5.8\nUzbekistan 7.4 6.1 4.5 5.4 5.6 4.7 5.8\nEast Asia 6.2 6.1 6.3 6.1 5.4 2.0 6.5\nHong Kong, China 2.4 2.2 3.8 2.9 \u20131.2 \u20133.3 3.5\nMongolia 2.4 1.2 5.3 7.2 5.1 2.1 4.6\nPeople's Republic of China 7.0 6.8 6.9 6.7 6.1 2.3 7.3\nRepublic of Korea 2.8 2.9 3.2 2.7 2.0 1.3 2.3\nTaipei,China 1.5 2.2 3.3 2.7 2.7 1.8 2.5\nSouth Asia 7.3 7.6 6.8 6.1 5.1 4.1 6.0\nAfghanistan 1.5 2.3 2.7 2.7 3.0 3.0 4.0\nBangladesh 6.6 7.1 7.3 7.9 8.2 7.8 8.0\nBhutan 6.2 7.4 6.3 3.8 4.4 5.2 5.8\nIndia 8.0 8.3 7.0 6.1 5.0 4.0 6.2\nMaldives 2.9 6.3 6.8 6.9 5.7 \u20133.0 7.5\nNepal 3.3 0.6 8.2 6.7 7.1 5.3 6.4\nPakistan 4.1 4.6 5.2 5.5 3.3 2.6 3.2\nSri Lanka 5.0 4.5 3.4 3.2 2.6 2.2 3.5\nSoutheast Asia 4.7 4.9 5.3 5.1 4.4 1.0 4.7\nBrunei Darussalam \u20130.4 \u20132.5 1.3 0.1 3.9 2.0 3.0\nCambodia 7.0 6.9 7.0 7.5 7.1 2.3 5.7\nIndonesia 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.0 2.5 5.0\nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Signs of incipient recovery near the turn of this year were quickly overthrown as \nCOVID-19 broke out in January 2020 in the region\u2019s largest economy and subsequently expanded into a \nglobal pandemic. Disruption to regional and global supply chains, trade, and tourism, and the continued \nspread of the outbreak, leave the region reeling under massive economic shocks and \ufb01 nancial turmoil. \nAcross Asia, the authorities are responding with policies to contain the outbreak, facilitate medical \ninterventions, and support vulnerable businesses and households. Assuming that the outbreak is contained \nthis year, growth is expected to recover in 2021.\nEspecially to face down fundamental threats such as the current medical emergency, innovation is critical \nto growth and development. As some economies in developing Asia challenge the innovation frontier, \nmany others lag. More and better innovation is needed in the region to sustain growth that is more \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable. Five key drivers of innovation are sound education, productive \nentrepreneurship, high-quality institutions, effi  cient \ufb01 nancial systems, and dynamic cities that excite \nknowledge exchange. The journey to creating an innovative society takes long-term commitment and \nhard\u00a0work.\nAbout the Asian Development Bank\nADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c, \nwhile\u00a0sustaining its eff orts to eradicate extreme poverty.
