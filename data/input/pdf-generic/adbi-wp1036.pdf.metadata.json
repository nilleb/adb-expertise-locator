Prior to 2012, the legal \nauthority and procedure through which the state could acquire land were both unclear \nand contradictory. Lacking a legal framework that provided the process with certainty \nand  legitimacy,  land  acquisition  has  often  triggered  accusations  of  state  coercion, \nintimidation, and human rights violations. In 2012, the Indonesian legislature passed a \nlandmark bill called Law No. 2 of 2012 on Land Acquisition in the Public Interest. It \nconferred  upon  the  state  the  legal  authority  to  acquire  privately  held  land  \nfor the purpose of economic development, and it established a statutory process for  \nthe determination of compensation as well as clearly defined procedural requirements \nand deadlines for all parties involved. This has resulted in the acceleration of many long-\nstalled infrastructure projects and has ensured that the outcome of compulsory land \nacquisition is generally more equitable, though there are some deficiencies in the \nlegislation that are likely to require further reform.  \nThis paper will begin with a discussion of land use law in Indonesia, focusing on the \nhistorical reasons for land acquisition constraining development efforts. It will then move \nto a comparative analysis of two case studies, the Lombok International Airport and the \nNew Yogyakarta International Airport (NYIA). The Lombok Airport project began in the \n1990s and therefore did not use Law No. 2 of 2012, while the NYIA project began in 2014 \nunder the authority of the new law. A qualitative analysis of both projects reveals \nimportant ways in which the law has changed the process of compulsory land acquisition \nin Indonesia. As the analysis shows, the law ensures that compensation for registered \ntitleholders is fairer now than it was previously. The procedural requirements that the law \nmandates have also accelerated the process while creating mechanisms through which \ntitleholders can contest the will of the state. The paper concludes by discussing the policy \nimplications of these findings and highlighting some areas of potential reform, such as \ncompensation for non-registered titleholders and intangible losses.  \n2.  LAND USE IN INDONESIA \nA broad range of legal traditions have evolved over time throughout the Indonesian \narchipelago, including both customary legal traditions and a civil law system inherited \nfrom the Dutch (Lindsey and Santosa 2008, p. 5). Efforts to reform this system of \noverlapping customary and civil laws and eliminate redundancies have only seriously \nbeen underway since the fall of the authoritarian New Order (the Suharto years (1966\u2013\n1998) in 1998. The capacity of local courts in Indonesia still varies widely, and rulings \nare often vulnerable to political pressure or corruption rather than sound legal reasoning. \nHowever, with the judiciary now being somewhat autonomous, recent scholarship has \nfound that the institutional capacity of the courts is slowly improving and that they are \nmaking some legal decisions according to the letter of the law rather than political \nexpediency (Butt 2014). This is the context in which land use law has developed in \nIndonesia, and it highlights the importance of Law No. 2 of 2012 in bringing clarity to a \nlegal landscape that has long been confusing and contradictory.  \nBasic Agrarian Law No. 5 of 1960 governs the use of land in Indonesia. It established \nthat land is a gift from God for the benefit of the Indonesian people and that society \nempowers the state to serve as the custodian of that land and regulate its use in the \npublic interest (Hutagalung 2015). The law created a class of freehold title known as Hak \nMilik, but in practice this official title continued to overlap with customary land claims. \n1 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J. Guild \n \nPrior  to  the  post-1998  reform  era,  when  the  state  wished  to  expropriate  land  for \ndevelopment, the executive branch would selectively invoke its legal authority stemming \nfrom the Basic Agrarian Law to acquire the land that it desired. The procedure through \nwhich the state could acquire land was vague, referencing the need for consensus \nwithout specifying how to achieve it. The state was otherwise content to let customary \nlaw govern land use at the local level, and little effort was made to clarify or improve the \ntitling records (Lindsey and Santosa 2018, p 10). \nThe Basic Agrarian Law thus proved to be inadequate, with the state employing and \nenforcing it selectively throughout the country and often overwriting it with sectoral laws \nand ministerial decrees that eroded its legitimacy and did little to clarify issues of legal \nhierarchy or overlapping land titles. To complicate the statutory landscape further, \nPresident Suharto issued Presidential Decree 55 of 1993, which established a procedure \nvia executive fiat for determining and paying compensation to landowners when the state \ndeemed the use of the land to be in the public interest. The government never codified \nthis into law or ratified it in the legislature; it merely emanated from the president, who in \npractice was the final authority on judicial matters.  \nThe precise definition of public interest, as well as what constituted fair compensation, \nwas left open to interpretation, and government officials alone determined compensation, \nminimizing the participation of local landowners in the process. There was no legal \nrecourse for landowners to appeal the state\u2019s decision, and, as titling records were often \nincomplete and poorly kept, it could be difficult to establish proof of legal ownership in \nany case. In practice, landowners often felt compelled to accept whatever compensation \nthe  government  offered  under  fear  of  coercion  from  the  police  or  military. \nDecentralization  in  the  post-1998  period  further  fractured  this  system  of  \nland governance. The authority for land governance devolved to local officials, but \nquestions remained about how exactly this division of authority would work in practice \n(Hutagalung 2015). \nOne major obstacle was that the central government needed to develop and implement \na national economic agenda but had to rely on local officials to execute the details, such \nas approving land deals. This created opportunities for rent seeking at the local level and \ngenerally mismatched incentives (Nasution 2016). It resulted in a serious log jam during \nthe  presidency  of  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  (2004\u201314),  as  the  process  \nof  land  acquisition  became  so  complex  and  cumbersome  that  it  caused  major \ninfrastructure projects like toll roads to stall (Davidson 2015). \nFaced with these obstacles, and equipped with inadequate legal tools to overcome them, \nPresident Yudhoyono began recentralizing the legal authority over land governance at \nthe  national  level.  These  efforts  ultimately  produced  Law  No.  2  of  2012  on  Land \nAcquisition in the Public Interest. This law, which supersedes previous executive and \nministerial decrees in terms of legal hierarchy, was the first statutory revision to the land \nacquisition law since the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960. While it significantly enhances the \nstate\u2019s power to acquire land in the interest of national development, it contains several \nprocedural safeguards designed to protect landowners and ensure a more equitable \noutcome than previously existed.  \nLaw No. 2 of 2012 mandates several clearly defined procedural stages, including a public \noutreach and discussion period prior to the issuance of the Location Permit.1 During this \nphase, a team, which includes the head of the local branch of the Ministry of Law and \nHuman Rights as well as academics, must mediate disputes. The intention is to give civil \n \n1  An English language translation of the law can be found at http://www.flevin.com/id/lgso/translations/ \nLaws/Law%20No.%202%20of%202012%20on%20Land%20Acquisition%20for%20Public%20Interest%\n20Development.pdf. \n2 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J.

It is also possible to \nchallenge the amount of compensation at the district court level, with the option of \nappealing to the Supreme Court. Each leg of the legal process has clearly defined \ndeadlines for rendering decisions, although, given that the capabilities of courts in \ndifferent parts of the country can vary widely, this does not ensure that they will return a \ndecision on time, and previous research has described the process as a \u201cleap of faith\u201d \n(Davidson 2015, p. 152).  \nArticle 1.10 of the law states that the appraised value of the land must reflect \u201cadequate \nand fair compensation to the entitled party.\u201d An independent third party is responsible for \nappraising the land at the time of issuance of the Location Permit, and the appraisal must \ninclude valuations for the land, space above and below ground, structures, plants, and \nobjects as well as other intangible losses, such as loss of income. The law states that \ncompensation may take the form of cash payment, replacement land, resettlement, or \nshare ownership in the development project. However, the law explicitly states that cash \npayments  will  be  privileged,  and  officials  at  the  National  Land  Agency  (Badan \nPertanahan Nasional, or BPN) stated to me that almost all claims have been settled on \na cash basis, as there is a perception that land banking arrangements are too complex \nand difficult to implement in practice.2  \nLicensed appraisers must carry out the appraisals, according to the standards that the \nIndonesian Society of Appraisers (MAPPI) have established, specifically SPI 306, which \nmandates the appraisal of the land at its \u201cfair replacement value.\u201d3 The ADB conducted \na gap analysis of this standard, comparing it with the bank\u2019s own appraisal standards to \ngauge whether it conformed to best practices, and found SPI 306 to be \u201cin line with the \nreplacement  cost  principle  set  forth  in  ADB\u2019s  SPS\u201d  (ADB  2017).  SPI  306  allows \nappraisers to employ a combination of cost, income, and market valuation methods in \ndetermining the fair replacement value. As the case study below indicates, in practice, \nappraisers have relied mainly on the market value of comparable land in determining \ncompensation and have struggled to reach valuations in the more complex appraisal of \nintangible losses.  \nThe new law also guarantees that landowners retain title to their land until they receive \ncompensation (or until the government deposits the compensation with the court in the \ncase of consignment). The law is a compromise that seeks to make outcomes more \nequitable for landowners while imposing a maximum 3-year deadline on the process to \nspeed up projects, clarify procedural requirements, and improve the regulatory and \ninvestment climate. Shortly after it was passed, the law received a challenge in the \nConstitutional Court, and the Court ruled against the complainant, adding another layer \nof legitimacy. In tandem with the law, President Yudhoyono also implemented reforms \nat the National Land Agency, pushing it to update, digitize, and record land titles more \naccurately (Schreiber and Schneider 2017). The following case studies will analyze the \nimpact of these legal and bureaucratic reforms on the process of compulsory land \nacquisition in Indonesia.  \n \n2  Author interview with BPN officials in Jakarta, 22 January 2019.  \n3  The  technical  specifications  of  this  standard  can  be  accessed  here:  https://www.mappi.or.id/files/ \n1405998014-ED_Juknis_SPI-306_200714.pdf. \n3 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J. Guild \n \n3.  LOMBOK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT  \nThe Lombok International Airport in Nusa Tenggara Barat (West Nusa Tenggara or NTB) \noffers an incisive look into the process of land acquisition during the late New Order, \nprior to the existence of Law No. 2 of 2012. Beginning in 1995, the Suharto Government \nbegan developing a new international airport in Lombok. Bali was already a popular \ndestination for tourists and foreign investment, and the expectation was that the trend \nwould spill over to the neighboring island of Lombok. \nThe project commenced as a wave of investment hit the region, so the 800 hectares \ntargeted by the state-owned airport operator Angkasa Pura I for the airport was a small \nportion of the thousands of hectares that big developers were acquiring at the time. \nThese  developers,  including  Lombok  Tourism  Development  Corporation,  which \nPresident Suharto\u2019s son Bambang partially owned, were able to acquire land from locals \nat far below the market price, often using state security forces to coerce landowners into \naccepting unfavorable terms (Dibley 1996).  \nAmidst  this  general  investment  frenzy,  Angkasa  Pura  I  invoked  the  authority  of \nPresidential Decree No. 55 of 1993 to begin acquiring 800 hectares in Central Lombok \nRegency. As a Presidential Decree, in theory it had less legal authority than a law  \nthat the legislature had passed, such as the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960. In practice, \nduring the New Order, such decrees had the force of laws and the government often \nenforced them using the coercive power of the state\u2019s security apparatus. The decree \nestablished a one-sided and unilateral process for acquiring land, mandating the creation \nof a compensation team that consisted entirely of government officials and allowed the \nprovincial governor to be the final arbiter of disputes. There was no recourse for legal \nappeals, and in any event the judiciary during the New Order was a highly co-opted \nbranch of government that tended to serve the interests of the president.  \nIn  1995,  government  officials  began  carrying  out  land  acquisition  for  the  airport.  \nTeam 9, which was responsible for determining compensation, did not include any local \ncommunity members or civil society organizations. In a series of three public meetings \nheld between June and July 1995, they first offered local landowners IDR1,500 per \nsquare meter for their land. Villagers reported later, in interviews about the experience, \nthat in the third and final meeting in July, they received a take-it-or-leave-it offer of \nIDR2,000 per square meter and felt coerced into accepting these terms as state security \npersonnel accompanied Team 9. The local regent, sub-district, and village heads also \npressured landowners to accept the deal (Zaenudin 2013). \nAn investigation that the Ministry of Law and Human Rights conducted later concluded \nthat the state had coerced landowners into accepting inadequate compensation ranging \nbetween IDR2,000 and IDR2,200 per square meter and that it subjected those who \nrefused to jailing and violence (Lombok Post 2016). This inequity was compounded as \nex-landowners  watched  real  estate  values  subsequently  rise,  driven  by  rampant \nspeculation and development. In 2001, the land prices in East Lombok had reached \nIDR120,000\u2013160,000 per square meter (Fallon 2001). By 2010, the prices had reached \nUSD$20 per square meter (Cassrels 2010). As a point of comparison, IDR2,000 in 1995 \nis equivalent in value to IDR15,700 in 2018, or a little over US$1.4 \nThe issues related to the acquisition of land from the mainly Sasak ethnic community at \nbelow market value and the use of intimidation and violence soon became even more \ncomplicated when the Asian financial crisis forced the government to suspend the project \nindefinitely. The affected community, some 7,000 people, continued to occupy and live \n \n4  Calculated using historical exchange rates and assuming a rate of IDR14,500 to USD1 in 2018.  \n4 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J.

The government was intent \non continuing with the airport project and sought to clear the landowners from the area \nonce again. However, as the ex-landowners felt that the initial process of land acquisition \nhad been neither fair nor conducted in good faith, these efforts provoked an intense \nbacklash from the local community.  \nThousands of local people were strongly opposed to the project, and the confused web \nof jurisdiction and responsibilities relating to land use in the post-New Order period \nimpeded a decisive resolution. In September 2005, about 1,000 farmers turned out to \nprotest against the project in an event that the National Police had permitted. Just before \nthe event, it revoked the permit and the Central Lombok Regional Police declared the \ngathering  illegal.  In  the  scuffle  that  followed,  at  least  35  farmers  and  \ntwo police officers suffered injuries, including gunshot wounds (Detik News 2005). \nClashes between farmers and police continued into 2006, resulting in numerous injuries \n(Hakim 2006). \nIn an effort to resolve the situation, Angkasa Pura I eventually paid an additional IDR5.4 \nbillion in \u201cpeace money\u201d to local farmers as compensation for the violence that had \noccurred between 2005 and 2006. Landowners who were involved in the process have \nreported that, to them, the matter was not merely one of financial compensation and \nrelocation but was about \u201cleaving their life history\u201d (Zaenudin 2013). Construction finally \nbegan in January 2008 and finished, many months behind schedule, in October 2011. \nThe  airport  sits  on  551  hectares  of  land,  and  the  total  project  cost  was  \nIDR945.8 billion, which Angkasa Pura I primarily financed (Bustanuddin 2011).  \nThe Lombok International Airport project highlights several critical issues related to land \nacquisition  in  Indonesia  and  its  evolution  over  time.  First,  it  reveals  how,  under  \nthe New Order, the state leveraged its coercive power to serve the interests of big \ndevelopers with close ties to Suharto. The compensation that it offered to acquire land \nfor the airport project was well below the market value, and a campaign of intimidation \nas well as the perceived illegitimacy of the process ensured that farmers had little choice \nbut to accept the terms that the state offered and then watch as the land values \nappreciated rapidly in the following years.  \nThe end of the New Order, rather than providing clarity, exacerbated the confusion, as \nthe division of responsibilities between different stakeholders and levels of government \nbecame blurred, leaving no single authoritative institution or statutory process to resolve \nthe  issue  conclusively.  This  resulted  in  several  years  of  protracted  conflict,  often \nescalating into violent confrontations. In total, the project began in 1995 and finally ended \nin 2011, taking 16 years from start to finish.  \n4.  NEW YOGYAKARTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT \n(YOGYAKARTA) \nThe  New  Yogyakarta  International  Airport  (NYIA)  is  the  largest  Indonesian  airport \ndevelopment since the passage of Law No. 2 of 2012. It thus offers an excellent example \nfor comparative analysis, as it is possible to contrast the ways in which this project utilized \nthe law with the previous case to identify the impact of the new legislation on the process \nof compulsory land acquisition. The Special Administrative Area of Yogyakarta (Daerah \nIstimewa Yogyakarta or DIY) is a semi-autonomous province located adjacent to Central \n5 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J. Guild \n \nJava. It is a center of high Javanese cultural and historical significance, a major tourist \ndestination, and a highly productive agricultural area.  \nCurrently, Adisutjipto International Airport serves Yogyakarta. The airport, which is \ntechnically an air force base, has a capacity of around 1.5 million passengers. It currently \nreceives around 7 million passengers per year, placing it far over capacity. The size of \nthe runway and the lack of facilities and apron space limit both the number of flights and \nthe size of the aircraft that can land. There are currently only limited international flights \nfrom Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and no direct international flights to Australia or \nEurope.  \nTo boost tourism and commerce, the government began developing a site in the Kulon \nProgo Regency for a new international airport around 2013. It identified approximately \n587 hectares of land for acquisition for the airport, planning the future development of an \nadjacent commercial center. The expectation is that the airport will be able to handle 15 \nmillion annual passengers initially, with multi-phase plans for expansion until 2040.  \nOn 5 September 2014, the Governor of DIY, who is also the hereditary sultan, issued \nGubernatorial  Decree  Number  89/TIM/2014  authorizing  the  formation  of  a  Land \nProcurement  Preparation  Team  for  the  development  of  the  new  DIY  airport.  The \nissuance  of  this  decree  occurred,  as  Law  No.  2  of  2012  mandated,  following  a \nprocurement report from Angaksa Pura I specifying the site and size of the land needed, \na statement of purpose, the budget, the estimated land values, and a rough timeline for \nconstruction.  The  preparation  team  collected  preliminary  data  on  those  whom  the \nprocurement affected and then conducted public consultation and outreach meetings \nwith the community.  \nAccording  to  court  documents  and  media  reports,  the  outreach  period  began  on  \n23 September 2014 with a series of meetings held on successive days in the five villages \nthat the proposed project affected. These meetings were contentious. Wahana Tri \nTunggal (WTT), a farmers\u2019 association and the primary leader of the opposition, later \nclaimed  in  a  court  filing  that  police  had  blocked  members  from  attending  the  \n23 September event.5 This prompted the Regent of Kulon Progo Hasto Wardoyo to adopt \na more hands-off approach to the public consultation meetings, during which residents \nwho  could  prove  that  they  had  legal  title  to  land  in  the  area  attended  a  \none-hour informational presentation and then had to register either their agreement with \nor their opposition to the plan. Hasto referred to this as a policy of \u201cminimal handling\u201d to \navoid escalating conflict (Natalia 2014). \nOn 31 March 2015, the Governor of DIY issued the Determination of Location Permit \nbased on the report that the preparation team submitted.6 The Location Permit had an \ninitial validity of two years, with a maximum one-year extension; thus, Angkasa Pura had \nthe obligation to complete the remaining steps in the land acquisition process (including \nsettling  all  legal  challenges  via  the  court  and  appeal  process,  appraising  and \nremeasuring the site to determine fair compensation, and acquiring title to the land) \nwithin a firm 3-year window or it would lose its Location Permit. Incorporating the lessons \nlearned from a long history of delays related to land acquisition, Law No. 2 of 2012 \nensured hard deadlines for every step of the process, and, as soon as the permit was \nissued on 31 March, it triggered a 30-day countdown for affected parties to appeal the \n \n5  Putusan Nomor 07/G/2015/PTUN.YK. https://putusan.mahkamahagung.go.id/putusan/909a7284e14fb1 \n7874939530362d2757. \n6  Keputusan  Gubernur  Daerah  Istimewa  Yogyakarta  Nomor  68/KEP/2015.  http://jdih.jogjaprov.go.id/ \nstorage/1470099660skgub68-2015.pdf. \n6 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J.

The Supreme Court, \nwhich is the ultimate authority on such matters, overturned the lower court\u2019s opinion, \nallowing  the  project  to  proceed.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the  court  system  is  slowly \nprogressing toward more principled legal reasoning, but the Supreme Court since 2011 \nhas also shown general unwillingness to enter into controversial cases of judicial review, \noften taking a pro-government position on difficult cases and avoiding ones that raise \ncomplex political questions (Butt 2018). \nThis final ruling on the matter of the Location Permit\u2019s legitimacy and legal force took \nless than 4 months from start to finish and cleared the way for BPN to appoint appraisers \nto begin assessing the land and determining compensation. For disputed compensation \ndeterminations, landowners could appeal first to the District Court, then to the Supreme \nCourt, with each stage of the process being subject to hard deadlines of 15 or 30 working \ndays. Once the Supreme Court has ruled, the legal appeal process has been exhausted \nand the state agency acquiring the land can deposit the sum at the District Court on \nconsignment. Once the agency has submitted the money to the District Court, the title \ntransfers legally from the landowner to the implementing agency, which in this case is \nAngkasa Pura.8  \nAs the law requires, BPN employed third-party appraisers who determined the value of \nthe land according to MAPPI (Masyarakat Profesi Penilai Indonesia or the Indonesian \nSociety of Appraisers) standards. It did not disclose the new appraised values publicly, \nbut it is possible to ascertain a general idea of the level of compensation from public \nstatements and court records. This can then be compared with what the market value \nfor land in that area should be.  \nThe total price that AP I paid to acquire 587 hectares was approximately IDR4.1 trillion, \nan average of IDR698,466 per square meter.

The next question is whether this represents a fair value for land \nin the Kulon Progo Regency in 2015.  \nDetermining the market value of real estate in Indonesia can be challenging. While BPN \nhas taken steps in recent years to improve its record keeping and the accuracy of its \ndata, it is still a relatively opaque institution, and official sales prices in tax records are \noften unreliable as the parties frequently under-report the sales price to lower their tax \nburden (Tamtomo et al. 2008). A more accurate picture is obtainable through site visits \nand court records.  \nAn interview with a local landowner revealed that land in 2013 was selling for between \nIDR180,000 and 200,000 per square meter (Kresna 2018). Several 2016 lawsuits list the \nexpected value of land in the area at between IDR800,000 and 2 million per square \nmeter.9 During a site visit to the area in October 2018, the prices for land in proximity to \nthe airport were reported to me at between IDR1 and IDR2 million per square meter.10 \nThe table below summarizes a range of estimated land valuations:  \nTable 3: Approximate Land Values in Kulon Progo 2013\u201318 \nYear  Range (IDR) \n2013  180,000\u2013200,000 \n2015  475,175\u2013778,441 \n2016  800,000\u20132,000,000 \n2018  1,000,000\u20132,000,000 \nThe higher land prices from 2016 onward reflect inflationary pressure from speculative \nland purchases after the issuance of the airport\u2019s Location Permit.

Moreover, there is evidence that the procedural requirements \nmandated by Law No. 2 of 2012 ensured that a fair price was offered.  \nIn 2014, Angkasa Pura I estimated that it would need IDR900 billion for land acquisition \n(Sukirno 2014). This averages IDR153,322 per square meter or slightly less than the \nestimated market price in 2013. After an independent appraisal team revalued the land, \nthe  valuation  more  than  quadrupled  to  IDR4.1  trillion.  This  helps  to  explain  why \nthousands of local landowners initially resisted the project but, as the parties worked \nthrough the process, a majority eventually accepted the terms that AP I offered. By \nJanuary 2017, of the 587 hectares undergoing acquisition, the sides had failed to reach \nagreement on only 51 or about 9% (Permana 2017). Even WTT, the group that sued to \nstop the project in 2015, eventually accepted the state\u2019s improved offer terms.  \n5.  CONCLUSION AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS  \nThe comparison of these two cases reveals that Law No. 2 of 2012 has materially \nimproved the process of compulsory land acquisition in Indonesia and moved it toward \na more equitable policy framework. Table 4 summarizes these improvements: \nTable 4: Summary of Pre- and Post-Law Provisions \n  Lombok International  NYIA  \nAirport (Pre-Law No. 2 of  (Post-Law No. 2 of 2012) \n2012) \nFinancial Compensationa  IDR15,704  IDR698,466 \nLegal Appeal Mechanism  No  Yes \nEvidence of State  Yes  No \nCoercion/Intimidation \nThird-Party Appraisal Team   No  Yes \nRecognition of Non-Titleholder  No  No \nProject Length  16 years  4 yearsb \na Adjusted to 2018 currency, using the inflation index on www.inflationtool.com. \nb The Location Permit was issued in 2015 and the airport became operational in 2019. \nThe law has brought clarity to what was a confusing and often contradictory legal \nlandscape.  It  delineates  the  authority  and  responsibility  for  procedural  compliance  \nand  imposes  hard  deadlines  that  have  greatly  accelerated  project  timelines.  The \ncompletion  of  the  NYIA  took  about  4  years,  while  in  Lombok  the  process  took  \n16 years. Not only the Asian financial crisis but also the unclear lines of authority and \nlegal hierarchies that had prevailed prior to the enactment of Law No. 2 of 2012 caused \nthe delay. This effect is also present in other sectors, such as toll roads. According to toll \nroad regulator BPJT, from 2004 to 2014, approximately 250 km of toll roads entered \noperation. In the last 5 years, over 700 km have become operational largely due to the \nimpact of the law.11  \nThe law has also materially improved the terms of financial compensation, ensuring that \nthey  reflect  more  accurately  the  fair  replacement  value  based  on  market  price \nestimations. There is no credible evidence that the state used coercive force in the NYIA \nproject to compel landowners to accept terms, as was the case in Lombok. Indeed, the \n \n11  The progress of toll roads at the national level is updated regularly here: Badan Pengatur Jalan Tol, Jalan \nTol Beroperasi (Operational Toll Road Report). http://bpjt.pu.go.id/konten/progress/beroperasi. \n9 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J. Guild \n \nstaunchest opponents of the project eventually accepted the state\u2019s terms and voluntarily \nreleased the land after the law\u2019s procedural and legal safeguards ensured a fair level of \ncompensation. Although the Supreme Court ultimately overturned the case brought to \nthe State Administrative Court, the existence of a legal mechanism through which \naffected landowners can challenge the state\u2019s agenda is an important consideration and \none that previously did not exist.  \nThere are some areas that the law does not address adequately, particularly recognizing \nnon-titleholders and determining intangible losses. In the first instance, there were \ndozens of shrimp farmers in Kulon Progo who had been working on publicly owned land \nfor many years. Though they had access to and use of the land, they did not own the title \nand therefore the law did not recognize them. This is a potential shortcoming of the law, \nas official land titling in Indonesia often overlaps with customary land titles and records \nare frequently inaccurate or incomplete. Many of the shrimp farmers sued in the District \nCourt, which awarded them a partial judgment comprising sufficient capital to start a \ncomparable shrimp farm in another location.12 The Supreme Court later overturned these \ndecisions,13 but the willingness of the District Court to base its ruling on the spirit rather \nthan the strict letter of the law is a noteworthy development.  \nThere is also an issue related to compensation for intangible losses for registered \ntitleholders. In the case of the NYIA, out of 11,000 affected people, 300 refused to vacate \nthe site (Muryanto 2018). Having exhausted their legal options to appeal, police forcibly \nevicted them. According to these families, financial reparation alone was inadequate to \ncompensate them for the loss of their land. They indicated that they were fearful of losing \ntheir identity, which is closely associated with the land. They deemed the offers of \nemployment at the airport to be inadequate, as many of them enjoyed working on the \nland and expressed no interest in becoming baggage handlers or security guards. They \nwanted to be relocated to another site that was comparable to their current land and \nwhere they could reasonably replicate their current living conditions.14 The Indonesian \ngovernment was unable to meet this demand to their satisfaction.  \nThis highlights the difficulty of determining compensation for intangible losses. Officials \nat BPN confirmed in an interview that determining intangible losses is difficult and  \nthat no universally agreed standard exists for doing so, noting that the majority of \nlandowners prefer to accept cash compensation in the form of the market value of the \nland. They noted that more complex compensation schemes, such as land banking \nexchanges (i.e., replacement land-for-land) or lease-backs, are virtually unheard of in \nIndonesia due to the difficulty in implementing them. They are also still working on \nstandardizing  the  law\u2019s  implementation  across  regions  and  sectors.15 In  a  policy \nenvironment in which the judiciary and the National Land Agency are still in the process \nof developing institutional capacity, a more straightforward approach to compulsory land \nacquisition, such as the one currently being implemented under the authority of Law No. \n2 of 2012, may be the most efficient and most equitable. As these institutions continue \nto acquire experience from the implementation of a relatively straightforward legal tool, \nsuch as Law No. 2 of 2012, the chances of successfully implementing more complex \npolicies, such as land banking, are likely to improve.   \n \n12  Putusan Nomor 60/Pdt.G/2016/PN Wat.  \n13  See Putusan Nomor 3525 K/Pdt/2016, Nomor 3291 K/Pdt/2016, or Nomor 3532 K/Pdt/2016 as examples. \nThe Supreme Court ruled the same way in overturning dozens of similar cases.  \n14  Author interview with a representative from PWPP-KP, the NGO working with the remaining hold-out \nfamilies, Yogyakarta, 2 October 2018.  \n15  Author interview with BPN officials, Jakarta, 22 January 2019.  \n10 \n ", "ADBI Working Paper 1036  J.

Under the Suharto regime, land acquisition in the public interest was often coercive, with the government determining one-sided compensation and no recourse for appeal. The legal basis for this process was Presidential Decree 55/1993, which gave the provincial governor the ultimate authority to rule on the matter. A new legal framework for land acquisition, which the government enacted in 2012, redefined the basis on which the state could acquire land in the national interest. It imposed clear administrative procedures and deadlines on dispute resolution and land procurement, including a legal appeal process. Outcomes can still vary widely according to many variables, particularly the capacity of district court judges, but comparative analysis suggests that the law is moving Indonesia toward a more equitable policy framework.", "Title": "Land Acquisition in Indonesia and Law No. 2 of 2012"}}
